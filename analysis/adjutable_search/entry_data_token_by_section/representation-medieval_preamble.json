    "main_text": "\n\nThe notions of mental representation and intentionality are\nintrinsically related in contemporary philosophy of mind, since it is\nusually thought that a mental state has content or is about something\nother than itself due to its representational nature. These notions\nhave a parallel history in medieval philosophy as well and are now\nwell studied, at least up to Buridan (see, for example, in Knudsen\n1982, Tweedale 1990, Pasnau 1997, Perler 2001, Perler 2002, King 2007,\nLagerlund 2007a, Black 2010, Amerini 2011, and Klima 2015).\n\nOne reason for the interest in intentionality and representation in\nmedieval philosophy is that it has been widely recognized that Franz\nBrentano was reviving a scholastic notion when he introduced\nintentionality as \u201cthe mark of the mental\u201d (Brentano\n1874). But Brentano never used the terminology of representation to\nexplicate intentionality. This was done much later, in\npost-Wittgensteinian philosophy of mind. In later medieval philosophy,\nit was, however, standard to explain the content of a thought by\nreferring to its representational nature.\n\nThere are a variety of theories of mental representation in medieval\nphilosophy, which were intensely discussed from the twelfth century up\nto the time of Descartes. This article will briefly trace the history\nof the terminology and also give a brief outline of the main theories\ndeveloped during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\n",
