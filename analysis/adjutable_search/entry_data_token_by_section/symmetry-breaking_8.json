    "main_text": "Symmetry Breaking\n4. Symmetry Breaking\n\nA symmetry can be exact, approximate, or broken. Exact means\nunconditionally valid; approximate means valid under certain\nconditions; broken can mean different things, depending on the object\nconsidered and its context.\n\nThe study of symmetry breaking also goes back to Pierre Curie.\nAccording to Curie, symmetry breaking has the following role: for the\noccurrence of a phenomenon in a medium, the original symmetry group of\nthe medium must be lowered (broken, in today\u2019s terminology) to\nthe symmetry group of the phenomenon (or to a subgroup of the\nphenomenon\u2019s symmetry group) by the action of some cause. In\nthis sense symmetry breaking is what \u201ccreates the\nphenomenon\u201d. Generally, the breaking of a certain symmetry does\nnot imply that no symmetry is present, but rather that the situation\nwhere this symmetry is broken is characterized by a lower symmetry\nthan the original one. In group-theoretic terms, this means that the\ninitial symmetry group is broken to one of its subgroups. It is\ntherefore possible to describe symmetry breaking in terms of relations\nbetween transformation groups, in particular between a group (the\nunbroken symmetry group) and its subgroup(s). As is clearly\nillustrated in the 1992 volume by I. Stewart and M. Golubitsky,\nstarting from this point of view a general theory of symmetry breaking\ncan be developed by tackling such questions as \u201cwhich subgroups\ncan occur?\u201d, \u201cwhen does a given subgroup occur?\u201d\n\nSymmetry breaking was first explicitly studied in physics with respect\nto physical objects and phenomena. This is not surprising, since the\ntheory of symmetry originated with the visible symmetry properties of\nfamiliar spatial figures and every day objects. However, it is with\nrespect to the laws that symmetry breaking has acquired special\nsignificance in physics. There are two different types of symmetry\nbreaking of the laws: \u201cexplicit\u201d and\n\u201cspontaneous\u201d, the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking\nbeing the more interesting from a physical as well as a philosophical\npoint of view.\n",
