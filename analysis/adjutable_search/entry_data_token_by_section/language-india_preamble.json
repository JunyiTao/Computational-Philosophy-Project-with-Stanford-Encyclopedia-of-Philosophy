    "main_text": "\n\nSpeculations about the nature and function of language in India can be\ntraced to its earliest period. These speculations are multi-faceted in\nthat one detects many different strands of thought regarding language.\nSome of these speculations are about what one may call the principle\nof language, but others are about specific languages or specific uses\nof these languages. One sees speculations regarding the creation of\nlanguage as well as the role of language in the creation of the\nuniverse. Language appears in relation to gods as well as humans, and\noccupies the entire width of a spectrum from being a divinity herself\nto being a means used by gods to create and control the world, and\nultimately to being a means in the hands of the human beings to\nachieve their own religious as well as mundane purposes. Gradually, a\nwhole range of questions are raised about all these various aspects of\nlanguage in the evolving religious and philosophical traditions in\nIndia, traditions which shared some common conceptions, but thrived in\nfull-blooded disagreements on major issues. Such disagreements relate\nto the ontological nature of language, its communicative role, the\nnature of meaning, and more specifically the nature of word-meaning\nand sentence-meaning. On the other hand, certain manifestations of\nlanguage, whether in the form of specific languages like Sanskrit or\nparticular scriptural texts like the Vedas, became topics of\ncontestation between various philosophical and religious traditions.\nFinally, one must mention the epistemic role and value of language,\nits ability or inability to provide veridical knowledge about the\nworld. In what follows, I intend to provide a brief account of these\ndiverse developments in ancient, classical and medieval India. (For an\napproximate chronology of Indian philosophers, see the\n supplement.)\n",
