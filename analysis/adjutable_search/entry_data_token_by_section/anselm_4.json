    "main_text": "The Divine Nature || Proving the divine attributes\n3.1 Proving the divine attributes\n\nRecall that Anselm\u2019s intention in the Proslogion was to\noffer a single argument that would establish not only the existence of\nGod but also the various attributes that Christians believe God\npossesses. If the argument of chapter 2 proved only the existence of\nGod, leaving the divine attributes to be established piecemeal as in\nthe Monologion, Anselm would consider the Proslogion\na failure. But in fact the concept of that than which nothing greater\ncan be thought turns out to be marvelously fertile. God must, for\nexample, be omnipotent. For if he were not, we could conceive of a\nbeing greater than he. But God is that than which no greater can be\nthought, so he must be omnipotent. Similarly, God must be just,\nself-existent, invulnerable to suffering, merciful, timelessly\neternal, non-physical, non-composite, and so forth. For if he lacked\nany of these qualities, he would be less than the greatest conceivable\nbeing, which is impossible.\n\nThe ontological argument thus works as a sort of\ndivine-attribute-generating machine. Admittedly, though, the\nappearance of theoretical simplicity is somewhat misleading. The\n\u201csingle argument\u201d produces conclusions about the divine\nattributes only when conjoined with certain beliefs about what is\ngreater or better. That is, the ontological argument tells us that God\nhas whatever characteristics it is better or greater to have than to\nlack, but it does not tell us which characteristics those are. We must\nhave some independent way of identifying them before we can plug them\ninto the ontological argument and generate a full-blown conception of\nthe divine nature. Anselm identifies these characteristics in part by\nappeal to intuitions about value, in part by independent argument. To\nillustrate Anselm\u2019s method, I shall examine his discussions of\nGod\u2019s impassibility, timelessness, and simplicity.\n\nAccording to the doctrine of divine impassibility, God is invulnerable\nto suffering. Nothing can act upon him; he is in no way passive. He\ntherefore does not feel emotions, since emotions are states that one\nundergoes rather than actions one performs. Anselm does not find it\nnecessary to argue that impassibility is a perfection; he\nthinks it is perfectly obvious that \u201cit is better to be \u2026\nimpassible than not\u201d (P 6), just as it is perfectly\nobvious that it is better to be just than not-just. His intuitions\nabout value are shaped by the Platonic-Augustinian tradition of which\nhe was a part. Augustine took from the Platonists the idea that the\nreally real things, the greatest and best of beings, are stable,\nuniform, and unchanging. He says in On Free Choice of the\nWill 2.10, \u201cAnd you surely could not deny that the\nuncorrupted is better than the corrupt, the eternal than the temporal,\nand the invulnerable than the vulnerable\u201d; his interlocutor\nreplies simply, \u201cCould anyone?\u201d Through Augustine (and\nothers) these ideas, and the conception of God to which they naturally\nlead, became the common view of Christian theologians for well over a\nmillennium. For Anselm, then, it is obvious that a being who is in no\nway passive, who cannot experience anything of which he is not himself\nthe origin, is better and greater than any being who can be acted upon\nby something outside himself. So God, being that than which nothing\ngreater can be thought, is wholly active; he is impassible.\n\nNotice that Augustine also found it obvious that the eternal is better\nthan the temporal. According to Plato\u2019s Timaeus, time\nis a \u201cmoving image of eternity\u201d (37d). It is a shifting\nand shadowy reflection of the really real. As later Platonists,\nincluding Augustine, develop this idea, temporal beings have their\nexistence piecemeal; they exist only in this tiny sliver of a now,\nwhich is constantly flowing away from them and passing into\nnothingness. An eternal being, by contrast, is (to use my earlier\ndescription) stable, uniform, and unchanging. What it has, it always\nhas; what it is, it always is; what it does, it always does. So it\nseems intuitively obvious to Anselm that if God is to be that than\nwhich nothing greater can be thought, he must be eternal. That is, he\nmust be not merely everlasting, but outside time\n altogether.[2]\n\nIn addition to this strong intuitive consideration, Anselm at least\nhints at a further argument for the claim that it is better to be\neternal than temporal. He opens chapter 13 of the Proslogion\nby observing, \u201cEverything that is at all enclosed in a place or\ntime is less than that which is subject to no law of place or\ntime\u201d (P 13). His idea seems to be that if God were in\ntime (or in a place), he would be bound by certain constraints\ninherent in the nature of time (or place). His discussion in\nMonologion 22 makes the problem clear:\n\nThis, then, is the condition of place and time: whatever is enclosed\nwithin their boundaries does not escape being characterized by parts,\nwhether the sort of parts its place receives with respect to size, or\nthe sort its time suffers with respect to duration; nor can it in any\nway be contained as a whole all at once by different places or times.\nBy contrast, if something is in no way constrained by confinement in a\nplace or time, no law of places or times forces it into a multiplicity\nof parts or prevents it from being present as a whole all at once in\nseveral places or times. (M 22)\n\n\nSo at least part of the reason for holding that God is timeless is\nthat the nature of time would impose constraints upon God, and of\ncourse it is better to be subject to no external constraints.\n\nThe other part of the reason, though, is that if God were in place or\ntime he would have parts. But what is so bad about having\nparts? This question brings us naturally to the doctrine of divine\nsimplicity, which is simply the doctrine that God has no parts of any\nkind. Even for an Augustinian like Anselm, the claim that it is better\nto lack parts than to have them is less than intuitively compelling,\nso Anselm offers further arguments for that claim. In the\nProslogion he argues that \u201cwhatever is composed of\nparts is not completely one. It is in some sense a plurality and not\nidentical with itself, and it can be broken up either in fact or at\nleast in the understanding\u201d (P 18). The argument in the\nMonologion goes somewhat differently. \u201cEvery\ncomposite,\u201d Anselm argues, \u201cneeds the things of which it\nis composed if it is to subsist, and it owes its existence to them,\nsince whatever it is, it is through them, whereas those things are not\nthrough it what they are\u201d (M 17). The argument in the\nProslogion, then, seeks to relate simplicity to the intuitive\nconsiderations that identify what is greatest and best with what is\nstable, uniform, and unchanging; the argument in the\nMonologion, by contrast, seeks to show that simplicity is\nnecessary if God is to be \u2013 as the theistic proofs have already\nestablished \u2013 the ultimate source of his own goodness and\nexistence.\n",
