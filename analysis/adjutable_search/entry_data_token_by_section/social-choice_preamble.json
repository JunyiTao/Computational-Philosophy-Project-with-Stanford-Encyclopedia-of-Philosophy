    "main_text": "\n\nSocial choice theory is the study of collective decision procedures\nand mechanisms. It is not a single theory, but a cluster of models and\nresults concerning the aggregation of individual inputs (e.g., votes,\npreferences, judgments, welfare) into collective outputs (e.g.,\ncollective decisions, preferences, judgments, welfare). Central\nquestions are: How can a group of individuals choose a winning outcome\n(e.g., policy, electoral candidate) from a given set of options? What\nare the properties of different voting systems? When is a voting\nsystem democratic? How can a collective (e.g., electorate,\nlegislature, collegial court, expert panel, or committee) arrive at\ncoherent collective preferences or judgments on some issues, on the\nbasis of its members\u2019 individual preferences or judgments? How\ncan we rank different social alternatives in an order of social\nwelfare? Social choice theorists study these questions not just by\nlooking at examples, but by developing general models and proving\ntheorems.\n\nPioneered in the 18th century by Nicolas de Condorcet and Jean-Charles\nde Borda and in the 19th century by Charles Dodgson (also known as\nLewis Carroll), social choice theory took off in the 20th century with\nthe works of Kenneth Arrow, Amartya Sen, and Duncan Black. Its\ninfluence extends across economics, political science, philosophy,\nmathematics, and recently computer science and biology. Apart from\ncontributing to our understanding of collective decision procedures,\nsocial choice theory has applications in the areas of institutional\ndesign, welfare economics, and social epistemology.\n",
