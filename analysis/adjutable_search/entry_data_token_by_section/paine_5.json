    "main_text": "Political Theory || The New Order of Government\n2.4 The New Order of Government\n\nPaine\u2019s institutional suggestions in Common Sense are\nhardly fully fledged proposals. Indeed, one of the most surprising\naspects of Paine\u2019s writing is how little institutional\ndiscussion there is\u2014he is not a man for the detailed discussions\nof constitutions and legislative and executive arrangements. Even his\npiece in the summer of 1791 Answer to Four Questions on the\nLegislative and Executive Power is not especially illuminating.\nMost modern commentators tend not to notice this. Paine is clearly a\ndemocrat, he advocates democratic institutions, and he rejects those\nof monarchy and aristocracy. But such judgments are often deeply\nanachronistic. If we examine what Paine actually says, we see that his\nown perspective was one which evolved and remained inclusive in many\nareas. It seems clear that Paine was a republican\u2014but in a\nchanging and always very specific sense. In Dissertations on\nGovernment (1786) he specifies it as government directed towards\n\u2018the public good, or the good of the whole\u2019 (II, 372). In\nRights of Man (1791) he understands it as government by\nelection and representation (I, 338)\u2014a definition of republic\nthat matches closely that advocated by Madison in the Federalist\nPapers. In Rights of Man (1792) he switches back to the\nearlier formulation:\n\nWhat is called a republic is not any particular form\nof government. It is wholly characteristical of the purport, matter,\nor object for which government ought to be instituted, and on which it\nis to be employed, res-publica, the public affairs, or the public\ngood\u2026.Republican government is no other than government\nestablished and conducted for the interest of the public, as well\nindividually as collectively. (CW I, 369\u201370)\n\n\nYet he steadfastly refuses to call the form of government he is\ninterested in a \u2018democracy\u2019\u2014which he identifies with\nancient direct democracy and sees as essentially limited. The system\nhe sees as operating in America is \u2018representation ingrafted\nupon democracy\u2019 (CW I, 371). And, unlike Joel Barlow, he does\nnot use the neologism \u2018representative democracy\u2019 nor, like\nJohn Adams, \u2018representative government.\u2019 Paine thus plays\na part in the process of transforming representation from something\nthat was seen as compatible with monarchical\u2014indeed with\nabsolutist\u2014states, although it could also take more popular\nforms, often linked to a gothic feudal past\u2014into something that\nwas directly linked to the sovereignty of the people in their nations.\nBut, in many respects, he does little especially innovative. The one\nmajor impact of his work was to bring to a wide audience some of the\nthinking that he shared with both Madison and Jefferson about the\ndistinctive features of the American form of government.\n\nRights of Man (1791) is a rather mixed performance, combining\nhistorical narrative of events in France, engagement with Burke, the\nadumbration of principles, and some powerful moments of political\nrhetoric\u2014suggesting that Burke has constructed a set of tragic\npaintings by which he has \u2018outraged his own imagination\u2019\n(CW I, 258), that Burke \u2018pities the plumage but forgets the\ndying bird\u2019 (CW I, 260) and that he has worked \u2018up a tale\naccommodated to his own passions and prejudices.\u2019 He makes his\npoints about rights polemically, as he does those concerning the\nsovereignty of each generation and in drawing a distinction between\nthe constitution and the government, and his most passionate attacks\nare on the hereditary principle and its accompanying\n\u2018gibberish\u2019 of titles and distinctions\u2014\u2018the\nidea of hereditary legislators is as inconsistent as that of\nhereditary judges, or hereditary juries; and as absurd as an\nhereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man; and as ridiculous\nas an hereditary poet-laureate\u2019 (CW I, 289).\n\nIn Rights of Man (1792) Paine shifts the ground\nsubstantially. He hardly mentions events in France, and barely touches\non Burke. Instead, the revolution in America is announced as an event\nof global importance\u2014the place \u2018where the principles of\nuniversal reformation could begin\u2019 (CW I, 354). What began in\nAmerica is now seen, not as an exception, but as the trigger for a\nrenovation or the world as a whole. The relative tolerance for\nFrance\u2019s monarchy in the first part of Rights of Man is\nset aside, suggesting that Paine had not previously thought that the\nold world states could manage a representative system of the American\nform, but that he now does think this. Moreover, his old distinction\nbetween society and government is re-animated but, instead of\nemphasizing the inevitability of vice, he represents society as in\nalmost every respect sufficient unto itself: \u2018Government is no\nfurther necessary than to supply the few cases to which society and\ncivilisation (a new concept) are not conveniently competent\u2019 (CW\nI, 357\u20138). Indeed, \u2018the more perfect civilisation is, the\nless occasion has it for government, because the more does it regulate\nits own affairs, and govern itself\u2026\u2019 (CW I, 358\u20139).\nAnd, again, it is America that is the model\u2014where the country\nsubsisted with hardly any form of government throughout the revolution\nand the subsequent period. Moreover, America becomes the model for\nreform: a society that agrees articles, establishes a constitution,\nand is able periodically to revise the constitution as the collective\nact of the people. Contrasting old forms of government, based on an\nassumption of power, for the aggrandizement of itself\u2019; and the\nnew: \u2018a delegation of power, for the common benefit of the\npeople\u2019 (CW I, 363), Paine roots the new forms in the\nestablishment of a constitution and the regulation of government in\naccordance with the constitution for the good of all, seeing the\nAmerican example as one that may be spread throughout the globe.\nIndeed, Paine thinks \u2018it is too soon to determine to what extent\nof improvement government may yet be carried. For what we can foresee,\nEurope may form but one great republic, and man be free of the\nwhole\u2019 (CW I, 397). This is a hymn to representative government,\nto minimal government, and to government with the primary concern of\nprotecting the natural rights of man more effectively. It is not a\ndefense of democracy or universal suffrage. For all his\ncharacterization as a democrat he does not embrace that description;\nand there is no advocacy of universal suffrage prior to Paine\u2019s\nLetter Addressed to the Addressers, written and published in\nthe summer of 1792 shortly before he left for France. This should\nfurther alert us to the fact that, in this period, Paine\u2019s\nthinking was changing, often as rapidly as events around him\nchanged.\n",
