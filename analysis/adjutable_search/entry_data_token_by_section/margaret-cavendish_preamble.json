    "main_text": "\n\nMargaret Lucas Cavendish was a philosopher, poet, scientist,\nfiction-writer, and playwright who lived in the Seventeenth Century.\nHer work is important for a number of reasons. One is that it lays out\nan early and compelling version of the naturalism that is found\nin current-day philosophy and science. It also offers important\ninsights that bear on recent discussions of the nature and\ncharacteristics of intelligence and the question of whether or not the\nbodies that surround us are minded and intelligent. Another reason\nthat the work of Cavendish is important is that it anticipates some of\nthe central views and arguments that are more commonly associated with\nfigures like Thomas Hobbes and David Hume. She also offers novel and\ncompelling responses to questions that are central to the discussions\nof the Seventeenth Century \u2013 for example, about whether sense\nperception is by means of impressions; about whether human beings are\nfree in a libertarian or a compatibilist sense; about whether there is\nany true disorder in the natural world; about the limits of knowledge,\nand the limits of ideas and language; and about how motion is\ntransferred between bodies. In addition, she takes on important\ndebates in social and political philosophy, with a focus on issues of\nagency and authority. She asks in particular about the relation\nbetween an individual\u2019s desire to live a life with which they identify\nand the receptivity that that desire encounters in the surrounding\nenvironment.\n",
