    "main_text": "\nEpistemic Contextualism (EC) is a recent and hotly debated position. EC is roughly the view that what is expressed by a knowledge attribution \u2014 a claim to the effect that S \u201cknows\u201d that p \u2014 depends partly on something in the context of the attributor, and hence the view is often called \u2018attributor contextualism\u2019. Because such an utterance is context-dependent, so too is whether the attribution is true. The typical EC view identifies the pivotal contextual features as the attributor\u2019s practical stake in the truth of p, or the prominence in the attributor\u2019s situation of skeptical doubts about knowledge. The typical EC view has it that as the stakes rise or the skeptical doubts become more serious, the contextual standard gets more demanding. It requires S to be in a better position if the attributor\u2019s claim, \u201cS knows that p\u201d, is to express a truth. In contrast, Invariantists about knowledge hold that such factors in the attributor\u2019s context do not affect the standards that must be met by a true \u201cknowledge\u201d attribution.\nIn addition to marking an important departure from traditional epistemological assumptions, EC is claimed to provide a novel resolution to certain puzzles about knowledge\u2014not least, skeptical ones\u2014as well as to best comport with our everyday \u201cknowledge\u201d-attributing practices. What follows describes the leading forms of EC, so understood, as well as the principal arguments for and major objections to EC. Along the way, EC is situated with respect to certain other views, both kindred and competing.\n",
