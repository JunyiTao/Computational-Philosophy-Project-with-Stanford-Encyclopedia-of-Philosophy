    "main_text": "Objections to Classical Foundationalism || Regress Problems for Access Internalism\n3.1 Regress Problems for Access Internalism\n\nLaurence BonJour (1985: ch. 4) raised a highly influential objection\nto foundationalism (an objection raised before he joined the ranks of\nfoundationalists). The objection presupposed a strong form of what we\nmight call access internalism. (We discuss the internalist/externalist\ncontroversy in more detail in\n section 6\n below.) The access internalist argues, roughly, that a feature of a\nbelief or epistemic situation that makes a belief foundationally\njustified for us must be a feature to which we have actual or\npotential access. Moreover, we must have access to the fact that the\nfeature in question is relevant to the truth or probability of what we\nbelieve. Suppose some foundationalist offers an account according to\nwhich a belief B is foundationally justified only if it has\nsome characteristic X. BonJour argues that the mere fact that\nthe belief has X could not justify the believer in holding\nB. The believer would also need access to the fact that\nB has X and that beliefs of this sort are likely to\nbe true. But according to the strong access requirement BonJour\naccepts, this requires actual or potential knowledge or justified\nbelief that B has X and that beliefs of this\nsort are likely to be true. So B would need other justified\nbeliefs for its justification. B\u2019s status as a\nfoundationally justified belief is destroyed.\n\nBonJour presented the objection on the way to developing a coherence\ntheory of empirical justification. But it ultimately became obvious\nthat the objection to foundationalism was too strong. Given the\nstructure of the argument it should become evident that the coherence\ntheory (and any other theory) would be equally vulnerable to the\nargument. Just replace \u201cX\u201d with some complicated\ndescription of beliefs cohering with each other. Coherence of\none\u2019s beliefs would never be sufficient for justification, for\none would have to already be justified in believing that one\u2019s\nbeliefs were coherent and that such coherence makes one\u2019s\nbeliefs likely to be true. That might suggest to the classical\nfoundationalist that strong access internalism is a view to be\navoided.\n\nMichael Bergmann (2006: chs. 1 and 2) argues, however, that if to\navoid regress we drop the strong access requirements that are so dear\nto some internalists, we also lose the motivation for the view. As\nBergmann sees it, the attraction of internalism is its claim to be\nable to construe justification in such a way that it gives a subject\nwith a justified belief a certain assurance from the subjective\nperspective, an assurance that externalist views (discussed below)\ndon\u2019t offer. According to Bergmann, even acquaintance with truth\nbearers, truth makers and a correspondence holding between them\ndoesn\u2019t carry with it assurance unless it is accompanied by a\njustified belief that all these relations obtain. And this will take\nus again on the road to regress. Bergmann\u2019s challenge is serious\nand the traditional acquaintance theorist who rejects the strong\naccess requirement will need to convince you that acquaintance with\nthe correspondence between a fact and a thought that P can make a\ndifference to the subject\u2019s perspective on the truth of P\nwithout needing justification for thinking that the fact corresponds to\nP (see Hasan 2011 for a reply along these lines). Alternatively, the\ninternalist might attempt to convince you that the regress that comes\nwith accepting the strong access requirement is not vicious after all\n(see Fales 2014).\n",
