Early History of \u201cPhilosophy of Biology\u201d in Latin America\n2.1 First Period. Early History of \u201cPhilosophy of Biology\u201d in Latin America\n\nFrom a variety of perspectives, reflections on the philosophical\naspects of what would later come to be called biology have been made\nin Latin American throughout its history. As in other areas of\nphilosophy in Latin America, until well into the twentieth century the\nphilosophical discussion of topics involving biology was characterized\nby the \u201cideological\u201d use of biological theories, theses,\nand experimental results for ethical, political, and social goals.\n\nFor instance, during the colonial period, an early debate took place\nbetween Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas (1484\u20131566) and Juan\nGin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda (1490\u20131573) at the Council of\nValladolid (1550\u20131551) and was then taken back up by Alonso de\nla Veracruz (c.1507\u20131584). This debate was over the supposed\nrights of the Spanish monarchy over the Indigenous peoples of the\nAmericas with the ideological use of a category from natural\nphilosophy, that of race, which would later be established as a\nbiological category (Casas 1552; Veracruz 1553\u20131554). Indeed, a\nnew social hierarchy or caste system based on race was developed as a\nconsequence of European conquest and colonization. Moreover, the\nideological use of the category of race has been a constant throughout\nthe history of Latin America, continuing in the present day (see\n Section 3).\n\nThe ideological use of biological knowledge continued after most areas\nof Latin America gained their independence from European colonial\npowers early in the nineteenth century. Although reception differed\nfrom country to country, versions of positivism and Darwinism were\ninstrumental for the dominant classes to create a project of\nnation-building, usually in conjunction with an educational project\nand sometimes with policies of \u201ccivilizing\u201d the Indigenous\npopulations and encouraging more immigration from Europe. The\npolitical and ideological use of positivism and Darwinism, or of\n\u201cscientific ideologies\u201d such as Spencer\u2019s\nevolutionism or social Darwinism, and their philosophical discussion\ncharacterize the Nationalist period from the mid-nineteenth century to\nthe early twentieth century.\n\nIn addition to Latin American contributions to philosophy of biology\nfrom Comtian and Spencerian positivism, as well as Darwinian,\nHaeckelian, and Bergsonian evolutionism, there were also advances in\nrelation to biological causality (J. Blanco 1917) and Kant\u2019s\nteleological ideas (J. Blanco 1918) (see Berm\u00fadez Barrera\n2001). These ran counter to the then contemporary currents of\nvitalism, as did those that claimed the legitimacy of a mechanical or\nmechanicist biology (Laclau 1931; Braier 1931; Neuschlosz 1944) and\nanalyzed the nature and methodology of biological sciences and their\nrelationships with physical-chemical sciences or historical social\nsciences (Neuschlosz 1939, 1944, 1945).\n",
