    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || Overview\n1.1 Overview\n\nWhat good is appeal to history when it comes to evaluating the\nrationality of decisions and actions? Since the past is already over,\nisn\u2019t history simply \u201cbunk\u201d? A couple of everyday\nlocutions suggest otherwise. It is commonly held that\n\u201chistory\u201d (meaning historiography, the disciplined study\nof what happened in history) is a debunker of myths. And politicians\nare not the only people worried about \u201cthe judgment of\nhistory\u201d. Both these ideas came into play in the new\nhistorically-oriented philosophy of science that began to emerge at\nthe end of the 1950s. The \u201cnew historicists\u201d (as we may\ncall them) included Thomas Kuhn, N.R. Hanson, Mary Hesse, Imre\nLakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Stephen Toulmin, Dudley Shapere, Larry\nLaudan, Ernan McMullin, and Michael Ruse. They claimed that the\nthen-dominant positivist and Popperian accounts of science were\nthemselves bunk\u2014myths about how science is done. Some new\nhistoricists claimed to find larger units and a hitherto unnoticed\ndynamic in the time-series of the historical record\u2014long-term,\nforward-looking research programs that included evolving series of\nrelated theoretical moments. Above all, the historicists stressed the\ndepth of major historical changes and the resulting challenges to\ncumulative scientific progress. They argued that there was nothing in\nthe traditional \u201clogic of science\u201d that could rationalize\nsuch changes. The problem was to produce a new dynamical model of\nscience that would capture these patterns and rationally motivate\nthem.\n\nHistoricist philosophers did a convincing job of showing that\nhistorical evidence called the received views into question. Most\nphilosophers today accept that verdict of history. Less successful was\nthe attempt to formulate an adequate positive theory of rationality,\nboth at the first-order level of scientific methodological norms\n(e.g., \u201cReject a hypothesis that makes clearly false\npredictions\u201d or \u201cUse double-blind experimental methods\nwhen dealing with cognitive agents\u201d) and at the\nmetamethodological level, where they faced the problem of how to\nrationally select among competing theories of scientific rationality,\nwithout circularity. The disagreements here raised the question of\nwhether there is a general theory of scientific rationality\nto be found, or a need for one.\n\n(For accessible, critical summaries of the \u201cBig Systems\u201d\ndebate, see Suppe 1974, Newton-Smith 1981, McGuire 1992, and Zammito\n2004. Space limitations have forced the omission of important\ndevelopments, including the Marxist dialectical tradition, e.g., Nowak\n1980, and recent work on stance and rationality, e.g., van Fraassen\n2002, Rowbottom & Bueno 2011.) \n",
