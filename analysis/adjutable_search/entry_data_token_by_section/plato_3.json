    "main_text": "Socrates\n4. Socrates\n\nThere is one interlocutor who speaks in nearly all of Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, being completely absent only in Laws, which\nancient testimony tells us was one of his latest works: that figure is\nSocrates. Like nearly everyone else who appears in Plato\u2019s\nworks, he is not an invention of Plato: there really was a Socrates\njust as there really was a Crito, a Gorgias, a Thrasymachus, and a\nLaches. Plato was not the only author whose personal experience of\nSocrates led to the depiction of him as a character in one or more\ndramatic works. Socrates is one of the principal characters of\nAristophanes\u2019 comedy, Clouds; and Xenophon, a historian\nand military leader, wrote, like Plato, both an Apology of\nSocrates (an account of Socrates\u2019 trial) and other works in\nwhich Socrates appears as a principal speaker. Furthermore, we have\nsome fragmentary remains of dialogues written by other contemporaries\nof Socrates besides Plato and Xenophon (Aeschines, Antisthenes,\nEucleides, Phaedo), and these purport to describe conversations he\nconducted with others (see Boys-Stone and Rowe 2013). So, when Plato\nwrote dialogues that feature Socrates as a principal speaker, he was\nboth contributing to a genre that was inspired by the life of Socrates\nand participating in a lively literary debate about the kind of person\nSocrates was and the value of the intellectual conversations in which\nhe was involved. Aristophanes\u2019 comic portrayal of Socrates is at\nthe same time a bitter critique of him and other leading intellectual\nfigures of the day (the 420s B.C.), but from Plato, Xenophon, and the\nother composers (in the 390\u2019s and later) of \u201cSocratic\ndiscourses\u201d (as Aristotle calls this body of writings) we\nreceive a far more favorable impression.\n\nEvidently, the historical Socrates was the sort of person who provoked\nin those who knew him, or knew of him, a profound response, and he\ninspired many of those who came under his influence to write about\nhim. But the portraits composed by Aristophanes, Xenophon, and Plato\nare the ones that have survived intact, and they are therefore the\nones that must play the greatest role in shaping our conception of\nwhat Socrates was like. Of these, Clouds has the least value\nas an indication of what was distinctive of Socrates\u2019 mode of\nphilosophizing: after all, it is not intended as a philosophical work,\nand although it may contain a few lines that are characterizations of\nfeatures unique to Socrates, for the most part it is an attack on a\nphilosophical type\u2014the long-haired, unwashed, amoral\ninvestigator into abstruse phenomena\u2014rather than a depiction of\nSocrates himself. Xenophon\u2019s depiction of Socrates, whatever its\nvalue as historical testimony (which may be considerable), is\ngenerally thought to lack the philosophical subtlety and depth of\nPlato\u2019s. At any rate, no one (certainly not Xenophon himself)\ntakes Xenophon to be a major philosopher in his own right; when we\nread his Socratic works, we are not encountering a great philosophical\nmind. But that is what we experience when we read Plato. We may read\nPlato\u2019s Socratic dialogues because we are (as Plato evidently\nwanted us to be) interested in who Socrates was and what he stood for,\nbut even if we have little or no desire to learn about the historical\nSocrates, we will want to read Plato because in doing so we are\nencountering an author of the greatest philosophical significance. No\ndoubt he in some way borrowed in important ways from Socrates, though\nit is not easy to say where to draw the line between him and his\nteacher (more about this below in section 12). But it is widely agreed\namong scholars that Plato is not a mere transcriber of the words of\nSocrates (any more than Xenophon or the other authors of Socratic\ndiscourses). His use of a figure called \u201cSocrates\u201d in so\nmany of his dialogues should not be taken to mean that Plato is merely\npreserving for a reading public the lessons he learned from his\nteacher.\n",
