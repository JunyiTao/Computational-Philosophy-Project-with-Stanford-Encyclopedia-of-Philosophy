    "main_text": "Republic, Books II, III, X || Republic III\n3.2 Republic III\n\nIn book III Socrates expands the argument considerably. The concern\nnow is squarely with poetry that encourages virtue in the souls of the\nyoung. Courage and moderation are the first two virtues considered\nhere; the psychological and ethical effects of poetry are now\nscrutinized. The entire portrait of Hades must go, since it is neither\ntrue nor beneficial for auditors who must become fearless in the face\nof death. Death is not the worst thing there is, and all depictions of\nfamous or (allegedly) good men wailing and lamenting their misfortunes\nmust go (or at least, be confined to unimportant women and to bad men;\n387e9\u2013388a3). The poets must not imitate (see 388c3 for the\nterm) gods or men suffering any extremes of emotion, including\nhilarity, for the strong souls are not overpowered by any emotion, let\nalong any bodily desire. Nor do they suffer from spiritual conflict\n(391c). The rejection of the \u201ctragic\u201d world view becomes\nexplicit: neither poets nor prose writers should be allowed to say\nthat \u201cmany happy men are unjust, and many wretched ones just,\nand that doing injustice is profitable if one gets away with it, but\njustice is someone else\u2019s good and one\u2019s own loss.\u201d Anybody\npronouncing on any of these topics\u2014poetically or not\u2014must\nsay the opposite (392a13\u2013b6). In expanding the scope of the relevant\ndiscourse so broadly, Socrates in effect lays down requirements for\nall persuasive discourse\u2014for what he elsewhere calls\n\u201crhetoric\u201d\u2014and makes poetry a subsection\nthereof.\n\nHaving covered the issue of content, Socrates turns to the\n\u201cstyle\u201d (\u201clexis,\u201d 392c6), or as we might say,\nof the \u201cform\u201d of myth tellers or poets (Socrates again\nruns these two together). He does so in a way that marks a new\ndirection in the conversation. The issue turns out to be of deep\nethical import, because it concerns the way in which poetry\naffects the soul. Up until now, the mechanism, so to speak, has been\nvague; now it becomes a little bit clearer. Poetic myth tellers convey\ntheir thought through a narrative (diegesis) that is either\n\u201csimple\u201d (haplos) or imitative (that is,\naccomplished through \u201cmimesis\u201d). The notion of\nmimesis, missing from the Ion, now takes center\nstage. When the poet speaks in his own voice, the narrative is\n\u201csimple\u201d; when he speaks through a character, as it were\nconcealing himself behind the mask of one of his literary creations,\nthe narrative is imitative or mimetic. For then the poet is likening\nhimself to this character, and trying to make the audience believe\nthat it\u2019s the character speaking. Some poetry (comedy and tragedy are\nmentioned) proceeds wholly by imitation, another wholly by simple\nnarration (dithyrambs are mentioned), and epic poetry combines the two\nforms of narrative.\n\nWhat follows this classificatory scheme is a polemic against\nimitation. The initial thesis is that every person can do a fine job\nin just one activity only. Consequently, nobody can do a fine job of\nimitating more than one thing (for example, an actor cannot be a\nrhapsode, a comic poet cannot be a tragic poet, if any of these is\nfinely done). Imitation is itself something one does, and so one\ncannot both imitate X (say, generalship) well and also do the activity\nX in question (394e-395b). It has to be said that this thesis is set\nout with little real argument. In any case, the best souls (the\nguardians, in this case, in the city in speech) ought not imitate\nanything.\n\nAnd were they to imitate anything, every care must be taken that they\nare ennobled rather than degraded as a result. Why? If imitations\n\u201care practiced continually from youth onwards,\u201d they\n\u201cbecome established as habits and nature, in body and sounds and\nin thought\u201d (395d1\u20133). Unlike simple narrative, mimesis\nposes a particular psychic danger, because as the speaker of the\nnarrative one may take on the character of literary persona in\nquestion. It is as though the fictionality of the persona is\nforgotten; in acting out a part one acts the part, and then one begins\nto act (in \u201creal life\u201d) as the character would act. One\ndoes not actually take oneself to be the fictional character;\nrather, the \u201cmodel\u201d or pattern of response or sentiment or\nthought one has acted out when \u201cimitating\u201d the character\nbecomes enacted. There is no airtight barrier between throwing\nyourself (especially habitually) into a certain part, body and soul,\nand being molded by the part; no firm boundary, in that sense, between\nwhat happens on and off the stage. By contrast, Socrates argues, a\nsimple narration preserves distance between narrator and narrated.\n\nBefore passing onto critiques of music and gymnastic, Socrates\nconcludes this section of his critique of poetry with the stipulation\nthat a poet who imitates all things (both good and bad) in all styles\ncannot be admitted into the good\n polis.[10]\n However, a more \u201caustere\u201d poet and myth teller is\nadmissible, for he confines himself to imitating decent people (when\nhe imitates at all, presumably as infrequently as possible), thus\nspeaking pretty much in the same tone and rhythm, and who accurately\nrepresents the nature of the gods, heroes, virtue, and other issues\ndiscussed in books II and III\n (398a1\u2013b4).[11]\n\nThis critique of mimetic poetry has struck not a few readers as a bit\nstrange and obtuse, even putting aside the question of the legitimacy\nof censorship of the arts. It seems not to distinguish between the\npoet, the reciter of the poem, and the audience; no spectatorial\ndistance is allowed to the audience; and the author is allowed little\ndistance from the characters he is representing. All become the\nspeakers or performers of the poem when they say or think the lines;\nand speaking the poem, taking it on as it were, is alleged to have\nreal effects on one\u2019s dispositions.\n",
