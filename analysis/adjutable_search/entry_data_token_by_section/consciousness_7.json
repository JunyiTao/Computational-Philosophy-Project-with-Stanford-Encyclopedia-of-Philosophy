    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || First-person and third-person data\n4.1 First-person and third-person data\n\n\nThe general descriptive project will require a variety of\ninvestigational methods (Flanagan 1992). Though one might naively\nregard the facts of consciousness as too self-evident to require any\nsystematic methods of gathering data, the epistemic task is in reality\nfar from trivial (Husserl 1913).\n\n\nFirst-person introspective access provides a rich and essential\nsource of insight into our conscious mental life, but it is neither\nsufficient in itself nor even especially helpful unless used in a\ntrained and disciplined way. Gathering the needed evidence about the\nstructure of experience requires us both to become phenomenologically\nsophisticated self-observers and to complement our introspective\nresults with many types of third-person data available to external\nobservers (Searle 1992, Varela 1995, Siewert 1998)\n\n\nAs phenomenologists have known for more than a century, discovering\nthe structure of conscious experience demands a rigorous inner-directed\nstance that is quite unlike our everyday form of self-awareness\n(Husserl 1929, Merleau-Ponty 1945). Skilled observation of the needed\nsort requires training, effort and the ability to adopt alternative\nperspectives on one's experience.\n\n\nThe need for third-person empirical data gathered by external\nobservers is perhaps most obvious with regard to the more clearly\nfunctional types of consciousness such as access consciousness, but it\nis required even with regard to phenomenal and qualitative\nconsciousness. For example, deficit studies that correlate various\nneural and functional sites of damage with abnormalities of conscious\nexperience can make us aware of aspects of phenomenal structure that\nescape our normal introspective awareness. As such case studies show,\nthings can come apart in experience that seem inseparably unified or\nsingular from our normal first-person point of view (Sacks 1985,\nShallice 1988, Farah 1995).\n\n\nOr to pick another example, third-person data can make us aware of\nhow our experiences of acting and our experiences of event-timing\naffect each other in ways that we could never discern through mere\nintrospection (Libet 1985, Wegner 2002). Nor are the facts gathered by\nthese third person methods merely about the causes or bases of\nconsciousness; they often concern the very structure of phenomenal\nconsciousness itself. First-person, third-person and perhaps even\nsecond-person (Varela 1995) interactive methods will all be needed to\ncollect the requisite evidence.\n\n\nUsing all these sources of data, we will hopefully be able to\nconstruct detailed descriptive models of the various sorts of\nconsciousness. Though the specific features of most importance may vary\namong the different types, our overall descriptive project will need to\naddress at least the following seven general aspects of consciousness\n(sections 4.2\u20134.7).\n",
