    "main_text": "Politics, Part One: The Ideal Constitution || Utopianism\n4.1 Utopianism\n\n\nJust as Socrates develops an account of a virtuous, successful human \nbeing and contrasts it with several defective characters, he also \ndevelops an account of a virtuous, successful city and contrasts it \nwith several defective constitutions. So the Republic \ncontributes to political philosophy in two main ways. I will take \nthem up in turn, starting with four disputed features of Socrates\u2019 \ngood city: its utopianism, communism, feminism, and totalitarianism.\n\n\nTo sketch a good city, Socrates does not take a currently or \npreviously extant city as his model and offer adjustments (see 422e, \nand cf. Statesman 293e). He insists on starting from \nscratch, reasoning from the causes that would bring a city into being\n(369a\u2013b). This makes his picture of a good city an ideal, a utopia.\n\n\nThe Republic\u2019s utopianism has attracted many imitators, but\nalso many critics. The critics typically claim that Plato\u2019s political\nideal rests on an unrealistic picture of human beings. The ideal city\nis conceivable, but humans are psychologically unable to create and\nsustain such a city. According to this charge, then, Plato\u2019s ideal\nconstitution is a nowhere-utopia (ou-topia = \u201cno\nplace\u201d). But if \u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019, then a\nconstitution that cannot exist is not one that ought to exist. So, the\nobjection goes, Plato\u2019s ideal constitution fails to be an ideal-utopia\n(eu-topia = \u201cgood place\u201d).\n\n\nTo consider the objection, we first need to distinguish two apparently\nideal cities that Socrates describes. The first, simple city is\nsketched very briefly, and is rejected by Glaucon as a \u201ccity of\npigs\u201d though Socrates calls it \u201cthe healthy city\u201d\n(369b\u2013372e). It contains no provision for war, and no distinction\namong classes. The second, initially called by Socrates a\n\u201cfevered city\u201d and a \u201ccity of luxuries\u201d (372e)\nbut later purified of its luxuries (see especially 399e) and\ncharacterized as a beautiful city (\u201cKallipolis,\u201d 527c2), includes three\nclasses, two that guard the city and its constitution (ruling and\nauxiliary guardians) and one that produces what the city\nneeds. (At 543c\u2013d, Glaucon suggests that one might find a third city,\nas well, by distinguishing between the three-class city whose rulers\nare not explicitly philosophers and the three-class city whose rulers\nare, but a three-class city whose rulers are not philosophers cannot\nbe an ideal city, according to Socrates (473b\u2013e).  It is better to see\nBooks Five through Seven as clarifications of the same three-class\ncity first developed without full explicitness in Books Two through\nFour (cf. 497c\u2013d, 499c\u2013d).)\n\n\nThe charge of \u201cutopianism\u201d would apply well to the first city \nSocrates describes. This city resembles a basic economic model since \nSocrates uses it in theorizing how a set of people could efficiently \nsatisfy their necessary appetitive desires (Schofield 1993). At the center of his \nmodel is a principle of specialization: each person should perform \njust the task to which he is best suited. But Socrates\u2019 model makes \nno provision for reason\u2019s rule, and he later insists that no one can \nhave orderly appetitive attitudes unless they are ruled by reason \n(esp. 590c\u2013d; cf. 586a\u2013b). So the first city cannot exist, by the \nlights of the Republic\u2019s account of human nature (Barney 2001). It is a \nnowhere-utopia, and thus not an ideal-utopia.\n\n\nThis is not to say that the first city is a mistake. Socrates \nintroduces the first city not as a free-standing ideal but as the \nbeginning of his account of the ideal, and his way of starting \nhighlights two features that make the eventual ideal an ideal. One is\nthe principle of specialization. With it Socrates sketches how people\nmight harmoniously satisfy their appetitive attitudes. If reason \ncould secure a society of such people, then they would be happy, and \nreason does secure a society of such people in the third class of the\nideal city. (So the model turns out to be a picture of the producers \nin Kallipolis.) But the principle can also explain how a single \nperson could flourish, for a version of it explains the optimal \nsatisfaction of all psychological attitudes (442d\u2013444a with \n432b\u2013434c). Indeed, this principle is central to the first \u201cproof\u201d \nfor the superiority of the just life. The second feature crucial to \nSocrates\u2019 ideal enters when Glaucon insists that the first city is fit for \npigs and not human beings. He objects that it lacks \ncouches, tables, relishes, and the other things required for a \nsymposium, which is the cornerstone of civilized human life as he understands \nit (Burnyeat 1999). Glaucon is not calling for satisfaction of unnecessary appetitive\nattitudes, for the relishes he insists on are later recognized to be \namong the objects of necessary appetitive attitudes (559b). Rather, \nhe is expressing spirited indignation, motivated by a sense of what \nis honorable and fitting for a human being. He insists that there is \nmore to a good human life than the satisfaction of appetitive \nattitudes. This begins to turn Glaucon away from appetitive \nconsiderations against being just. It also completes the first city\u2019s\nintroduction of the two kinds of arguments for the superiority of the\njust life, by appealing, as the pleasure proofs do, to the \nintrinsic value of different kinds of psychological satisfaction.\n\n\nDoes the \u201cutopianism\u201d objection apply to the second city,\nwith its philosopher-rulers, auxiliary guardians, and producers? Some\nreaders would have Plato welcome the charge. As they understand\nthe Republic, Socrates sketches the second city not as an\nideal for us to strive for but as a warning against political\nutopianism or as an unimportant analogue to the good person.  There\nare a couple of passages to support this approach. At 472b\u2013473b,\nSocrates says that the point of his ideal is to allow us to judge\nactual cities and persons based on how well they approximate it. And\nat 592a\u2013b, he says that the ideal city can serve as a model\n(paradeigma) were it ever to come into\nexistence or not. But these passages have to be squared with the many in\nwhich Socrates insists that the ideal city could in fact come into\nexistence (just a few: 450c\u2013d, 456bc, 473c, 499b\u2013d, 502a\u2013c, 540d\u2013e).\nHis considered view is that although the ideal city is meaningful to\nus even if it does not exist, it could exist. Of course,\nrealizing the ideal city is highly unlikely. The widespread disrepute\nof philosophy and the corruptibility of the philosophical nature\nconspire to make it extremely difficult for philosophers to gain power\nand for rulers to become philosophers (487a\u2013502c).  Nevertheless,\naccording to what Socrates explicitly says, the ideal city is supposed\nto be realizable. The Laws imagines an impossible ideal, in\nwhich all the citizens are fully virtuous and share everything\n(739a\u2013740 with\n Plato: on utopia),\n but the Republic is more practical than that (Burnyeat 1992; cf. Griswold 1999 and Marshall 2008). So if Plato\ndoes not intend for us to think of the\nRepublic\u2019s ideal city as a serious goal worth striving for, \nsomething other than Socrates\u2019 explicit professions must reveal this \nto us. I consider this possibility in \n section 6\n below.\n\n\nBut if Socrates would not welcome the \u201cutopianism\u201d charge,\ndoes he successfully avoid it? This is not clear. It is difficult to\nshow that the ideal city is inconsistent with human nature as the\nRepublic understands it. Socrates supposes that almost all \nof its citizens\u2014not quite all (415d\u2013e)\u2014have to reach \ntheir fullest psychological potential, but it is not clear that \nanyone has to do more than this.\n\n\nNevertheless, we might make the \u201cutopianism\u201d charge stick by showing \nthat the Republic is wrong about human nature. This version \nof the criticism is sometimes advanced in very sweeping terms: \nPlato\u2019s psychology is \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d about human beings because it \nunderplays self-interest, say. In these general terms, the criticism \nis false. Socrates builds his theory on acute awareness of how \ndangerous and selfish appetitive attitudes are, and indeed of how \nself-centered the pursuit of wisdom is, as well. In fact, it might be \neasier to argue in sweeping terms that the Republic\u2019s ideal \ncity is too pessimistic about what most people are capable of, since \nit consigns most human beings to lives as slaves (433c\u2013d, cf. \n469b\u2013471c) or as citizens who are slavishly dependent upon others\u2019 \nruling (590c\u2013d). Still, more specific criticisms of Plato\u2019s \npsychology may well be tenable, and these might even show that the \nRepublic is too optimistic about the possibility of its \nideal city.\n\n\nSuch criticism should be distinguished from a weaker complaint about\nthe Republic\u2019s \u201cutopianism.\u201d One might concede to\nthe Republic its psychology, concede the\npossibility of the ideal city, and nevertheless insist that \nthe ideal city is so unlikely to come about as to be merely fanciful.\nA hard-nosed political scientist might have this sort of response. \nBut this sounds like nothing more than opposition to political theory\nproposing ideals that are difficult to achieve, and it is not clear \nwhat supports this opposition. It is not as though political \ntheorizing must propose ideas ready for implementation in order to \npropose ideas relevant to implementation. The \nRepublic\u2019s ideal can affect us very generally: we can \nconsider the unity and harmony fundamental to it, and consider \nwhether our own cities and souls should be allowed to fall short in \nunity and harmony where they do. But it can also work in more \nspecific terms: we should be able to recognize and promote the \nstrategies and policies crucial to the Republic\u2019s ideal, \nincluding careful moral education societally and habitual regulation \nof appetitive desire personally, or the equal opportunity for work \nsocietally and the development of multiple kinds of psychological \nattitudes personally.\n\n\nSo the Republic\u2019s ideal city might be objectionably \nnowhere-utopian, but the point is far from obvious. Of course, even \nif it is not nowhere-utopian, it might fail to be attractively \nideal-utopian. We need to turn to other features of the second city \nthat have led readers to praise and blame it.\n",
