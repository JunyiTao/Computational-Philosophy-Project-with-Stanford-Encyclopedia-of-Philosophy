    "main_text": "Knowledge Transmission and Generation\n2. Knowledge Transmission and Generation\n\nConsider this scenario: Gretchen knows that the bakery is closed. If\nGretchen tells you that this is the case, and if all goes well, then\nit is uncontroversial that you can acquire testimonial knowledge that\nthe bakery is closed too.\n\nNow, contrast that scenario with this one: Gretchen does not know that\nthe bakery is closed (perhaps because she simply lacks any\njustification for believing this). Nevertheless, she testifies to you\nthat the bakery is closed anyway. If you come to believe that the\nbakery is closed on the basis of Gretchen\u2019s testimony, and if\nthe bakery really is closed, then is it possible for your belief to\namount to knowledge?\n\nDepending on how the details are filled in, things are much more\ncontroversial in this second scenario. The controversy centers on the\nfollowing question:\n\n\nSecond Big Question: Can testimony generate knowledge, or can\nit merely transmit it?\n\n\nOtherwise put, can a hearer acquire testimonial knowledge that\np from a speaker who does not know that p\nthemselves?\n\nBefore moving on, two clarification points are in order. First, while\nmuch of the debate about the Transmission View has centered on whether\ntestimony can only transmit knowledge, there is also some\ndebate about whether testimony can transmit justification.\n(See, e.g., Audi [1997] who maintains that while testimony can\ngenerate justification, it can only transmit knowledge. See also\nWright 2016a for a recent discussion of other views according to which\ntestimony transmits knowledge but generates justification). Second,\ndebates about knowledge transmission bear on debates about the\nInheritance View\n (Section 3.1.2)\n and on the Individualism vs. Non-Individualism debate\n (Section 4).\n",
