    "main_text": "Conceptual issues || What is patriotism?\n1.1 What is patriotism?\n\nThe standard dictionary definition reads \u201clove of one\u2019s\ncountry.\u201d This captures the core meaning of the term in ordinary\nuse; but it might well be thought too thin and in need of fleshing\nout. In the first philosophical\u00a0book-length study of the subject,\nStephen Nathanson (1993, 34\u201335) defines patriotism as\ninvolving:\n\nSpecial affection for one\u2019s own country\nA sense of personal identification with the country\nSpecial concern for the well-being of the country\nWillingness to sacrifice to promote the country\u2019s good\n\n\nThere is little to cavil about here. There is no great difference\nbetween special affection and love, and Nathanson himself uses the\nterms interchangeably. Although love (or special affection) is usually\ngiven expression in special concern for its object, that is not\nnecessary. But a person whose love for her country was not expressed\nin any special concern for it would scarcely be considered a patriot.\nTherefore the definition needs to include such concern. Once that is\nincluded, however, a willingness to make sacrifices for one\u2019s\ncountry is implied, and need not be added as a separate component.\nIdentification with the country, too, might be thought implied in the\nphrase \u201cone\u2019s country.\u201d But the phrase is extremely\nvague, and allows for a country to be called \u201cone\u2019s\nown\u201d in an extremely thin, formal sense too. It seems that if\none is to be a patriot of a country, the country must be his in some\nsignificant sense; and that may be best captured by speaking\nof one\u2019s identification with it. Such identification is\nexpressed in vicarious feelings: in pride of one\u2019s\ncountry\u2019s merits and achievements, and in shame for its lapses\nor crimes (when these are acknowledged, rather than denied).\n\nAccordingly, patriotism can be defined as love of one\u2019s country,\nidentification with it, and special concern for its well-being and\nthat of compatriots.\n\nThis is only a definition. A fuller account of patriotism is beyond\nthe scope of this article. Such an account would say something about\nthe patriot\u2019s beliefs about the merits of his country, his need\nto belong to a group and be a part of a more encompassing narrative,\nto be related to a past and a future that transcend the narrow\nconfines of an individual\u2019s life and its mundane concerns, as\nwell as social and political conditions that affect the ebb and flow\nof patriotism, its political and cultural influence, and more.\n",
