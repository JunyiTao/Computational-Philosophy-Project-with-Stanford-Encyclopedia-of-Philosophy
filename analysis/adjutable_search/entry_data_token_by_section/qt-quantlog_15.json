Relative to\nthis ordering, the mapping \\(a\\rightarrow a'\\) is an\northocomplementation and \\(a\\binbot b\\) iff \\(a\\le b'\\). It can be\nshown that \\(a\\oplus b\\) is always a minimal upper bound for \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\), but it is generally not the least upper bound. Indeed,\nwe have the following (Foulis, Greechie and Ruttimann [1992], Theorem 2.12):\n\n\n4.3 Lemma:\n\nFor an orthoalgebra \\((\\mathbf{L},\\oplus ,0,1)\\), the following are\nequivalent:\n\n\\(a\\oplus b = a\\vee b\\), for all \\(a, b\\) in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\)\nIf \\(a\\oplus b, b\\oplus c\\), and \\(c\\oplus a\\) all exist, then so\ndoes \\(a\\oplus b\\oplus c\\)\nThe orthoposet \\((\\mathbf{L},\\le ,')\\) is orthomodular,\ni.e., for all \\(a, b\\in L\\), if \\(a\\le b\\) then \\((b \\wedge a') \\vee\na\\) exists and equals \\(b\\).\n\n\n\nAn orthoalgebra satisfying condition (b) is said to be\northocoherent. In other words: an orthoalgebra is\northocoherent if and only if finite pairwise summable subsets of\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\) are jointly summable. The lemma tells us that every\northocoherent orthoalgebra is, inter alia, an orthomodular\nposet. Conversely, an orthocomplemented poset is orthomodular iff\n\\(a\\oplus b = a\\vee b\\) is defined for all pairs with \\(a\\le b'\\) and\nthe resulting partial binary operation is associative\u2014in which\ncase the resulting structure \\((\\mathbf{L},\\oplus ,0,1)\\) is an\northocoherent orthoalgebra, the canonical ordering on which agrees\nwith the given ordering on \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). Thus, orthomodular posets\n(the framework for Mackey\u2019s version of quantum logic) are\nequivalent to orthocoherent orthoalgebras.\n\nA condition related to, but stronger than, orthocoherence is that any\npairwise compatible propositions should be jointly\ncompatible. This is sometimes called regularity. Most\nnaturally occurring orthomodular lattices and posets are regular. In\nparticular, Harding (1996, 1998) has shown that the direct-product\ndecompositions of any algebraic, relational or topological structure\ncan be organized in a natural way into a regular orthomodular\n poset.[12]\n\n\nSome version of orthocoherence or regularity was taken by Mackey and\nmany of his successors as an axiom. (Orthocoherence appears, in an\ninfinitary form, as Mackey\u2019s axiom V; regularity appears in the\ndefinition of a partial Boolean algebra in the work of Kochen and\nSpecker (1965).) However, it is quite easy to construct simple model\ntest spaces, having perfectly straightforward\u2014even\nclassical\u2014interpretations, the logics of which are not\northocoherent. There has never been given any entirely compelling\nreason for regarding orthocoherence as an essential feature of all\nreasonable physical models. Moreover, certain apparently quite\nwell-motivated constructions that one wants to perform with test\nspaces tend to destroy orthocoherence (see\n section 7).\n",
