    "main_text": "Explanation: From Formal Analyses to Material Structures || Etiological and Constitutive Explanations\n3.1 Etiological and Constitutive Explanations\nMost mechanists recognize two main aspects of mechanistic\nexplanation: etiological and constitutive. Salmon (1984) describes\nthem as two different ways of situating an explanandum phenomenon in\nthe causal nexus (see also Craver 2001b; Glennan 2009). Etiological\nexplanations reveal the causal history of the explanandum phenomenon,\nas when one says a virus explains a disease. Constitutive\nexplanations, in contrast, explain a phenomenon by describing the\nmechanism that underlies it, as when one says brain regions, muscles,\nand joints explain reaching.\nPhilosophical arguments against the covering law model often\nfocused on its inability to deal with causal, etiological\nexplanations. The model failed to deliver the right verdict on a\nvariety of problem cases precisely because it attempted to provide an\naccount of explanation without any explicit mention of causation\n(Bromberger 1966; Salmon 1984; Scriven 1959)\nNew mechanists extend these kinds of criticism to the covering law\nmodel of intertheoretic, micro-reduction. According to the covering\nlaw model of reductive explanation, a theory about parts reduces, and\nso explains, a theory about wholes when it is possible to derive the\nsecond from the first given bridge laws to connect the two (see Nagel\n1961; Schaffner 1993).\nSome mechanists argue that the covering law model of constitutive\nexplanation has problems analogous to those that beset the\ncovering-law model of etiological explanations. Action potentials\ncannot be explained by mere temporal sequences of events utterly\nirrelevant to the phenomenon, but one can derive a description of the\naction potential from descriptions of such irrelevant\nphenomena. Action potentials cannot be explained by mere patterns of\ncorrelation that are not indicative of an underlying causal\nrelation. Irrelevant byproducts of a mechanism might be correlated\nwith the behavior of the mechanism, even perfectly correlated such\nthat one could form bridge laws between levels, but would not thereby\nexplain the relationship. Merely finding a neural correlate of\nconsciousness, for example, would not, and is not taken by anyone to,\nconstitute an explanation of consciousness. So mechanists argue that\nmicro-reductive explanations must satisfy causal constraints just as\nsurely as etiological explanations must (Craver 2007).\nThe covering law model also fails to distinguish models that merely\nre-describe the phenomenon in general terms from explanations that, in\naddition to predicting aspects of the phenomenon, reveal the\nmechanisms that produce it (Craver 2006; Kaplan and Craver 2011; but\nsee Weiskopf 2011). For example, Snell\u2019s law allows one to predict how\nlight bends when passing from one medium to another, but it does not\nexplain why the light bends. New mechanists also argue that the\ncovering law model fails to distinguish predictively adequate but\nfictional models from explanatory models. Finally, mechanists argue\nthat the intertheoretic model of reduction fails to capture an\nimportant dimension of explanatory quality: depth. An implication of\nthe covering law model is that any true law statements that allow one\nto derive the explanandum law (with suitable corrections and\nassumptions) will count as a complete explanation. Yet it seems one\ncan deepen an explanation by opening black boxes and revealing how\nthings work down to whatever level one takes as relatively fundamental\nfor the purposes at hand. Such criticisms suggest that the\ncovering-law model of constitutive explanation is too weak to capture\nthe norms of explanation in the special sciences.\nOther mechanists have argued that the covering law model is too\nstrong. Philosophers of biology have long argued that there are no\nlaws of the sort the logical empiricist described in biology and other\nspecial sciences (Beatty 1995; Mitchell 1997, 2000; Woodward\n2001). One might conclude from this that there are no explanations in\nbiology (Rosenberg 1985), but such a radical conclusion is difficult to square\nwith obvious advances in understanding, e.g., protein synthesis,\naction potentials, cell signaling, and a host of other biological\nphenomena.  In such cases, one finds that scientists appeal to\nmechanisms to do the explanatory work, even in cases where nothing\nresembling a law appears to be available.\n",
