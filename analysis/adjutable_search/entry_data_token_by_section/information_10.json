    "main_text": "Building Blocks of Modern Theories of Information || Numbers\n3.3 Numbers\n\nThe simplest way of representing numbers is via a unary\nsystem. Here the length of the representation of a number is\nequal to the size of the number itself, i.e., the number\n\u201cten\u201d is represented as \u201c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d. The\nclassical Roman number system is an improvement since it contains\ndifferent symbols for different orders of magnitude (one = I, ten = X,\nhundred = C, thousand = M). This system has enormous drawbacks since\nin principle one needs an infinite amount of symbols to code the\nnatural numbers and because of this the same mathematical operations\n(adding, multiplication etc.) take different forms at different orders\nof magnitude. Around 500 CE the number zero was invented in India.\nUsing zero as a placeholder we can code an infinity of numbers with a\nfinite set of symbols (one = I, ten = 10, hundred = 100, thousand =\n1000 etc.). From a modern perspective an infinite number of position\nsystems is possible as long as we have 0 as a placeholder and a finite\nnumber of other symbols. Our normal decimal number system has ten\ndigits \u201c0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\u201d and represents the\nnumber two-hundred-and-fifty-five as \u201c255\u201d. In a binary\nnumber system we only have the symbols \u201c0\u201d and\n\u201c1\u201d. Here two-hundred-and-fifty-five is represented as\n\u201c11111111\u201d. In a hexadecimal system with 16 symbols (0, 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f) the same number can be\nwritten as \u201cff\u201d. Note that the length of these\nrepresentations differs considerable. Using this representation,\nmathematical operations can be standardized irrespective of the order\nof magnitude of numbers we are dealing with, i.e., the possibility of\na uniform algorithmic treatment of mathematical functions (addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication and division etc.) is associated with such\na position system.\n\nThe concept of a positional number system was brought to Europe by the\nPersian mathematician al-Khwarizmi (ca. 780\u2013ca. 850 CE). His\nmain work on numbers (ca. 820 CE) was translated into Latin as\nLiber Algebrae et Almucabola in the twelfth century, which\ngave us amongst other things the term \u201calgebra\u201d. Our word\n\u201calgorithm\u201d is derived from Algoritmi, the Latin\nform of his name. Positional number systems simplified commercial and\nscientific calculations.\n\nIn 1544 Michael Stifel introduced the concept of the exponent of a\nnumber in Arithmetica integra (1544). Thus 8 can be written\nas \\(2^3\\) and 25 as \\(5^2\\). The notion of an exponent immediately\nsuggests the notion of a logarithm as its inverse function: \\(\\log_b\nb^a = a\\). Stifel compared the arithmetic sequence: \n\\[\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\n\\]\n\n\nin which the term 1 have a difference of 1 with the geometric\nsequence: \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2} , 1, 2, 4, 8\n\\]\n\n\nin which the terms have a ratio of 2. The exponent notation allowed\nhim to rewrite the values of the second table as: \n\\[\n2^{-3}, 2^{-2}, 2^{-1}, 2^0 , 2^1 , 2^2, 2^3\n\\]\n\n\nwhich combines the two tables. This arguably was the first logarithmic\ntable. A more definitive and practical theory of logarithms is\ndeveloped by John Napier (1550\u20131617) in his main work (Napier\n1614). He coined the term logarithm (logos + arithmetic: ratio of\nnumbers). As is clear from the match between arithmetic and geometric\nprogressions, logarithms reduce products to sums: \n\\[\n\\log_b (xy) = \\log_b (x) + \\log_b (y)\n\\]\n\n\nThey also reduce divisions to differences: \n\\[\n\\log_b (x/y) = \\log_b (x) - \\log_b (y)\n\\]\n\n\nand powers to products:  \n\\[\n\\log_b (x^p) = p \\log_b (x)\n\\]\n\n\nAfter publication of the logarithmic tables by Briggs (1624) this new\ntechnique of facilitating complex calculations rapidly gained\npopularity.\n",
