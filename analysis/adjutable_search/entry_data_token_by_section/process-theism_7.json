    "main_text": "Divine Power and the Problem of Evil\n6. Divine Power and the Problem of Evil\n\nProcess theism provides unique, if controversial, thoughts on the\ntraditional problem of evil. Simply stated, the problem of evil comes\nto this: if God is all-powerful then God has the ability to prevent\nunjustified suffering; if God is perfectly good then God has the\nmotive to prevent unjustified suffering; but unjustified suffering\napparently exists; therefore, there is reason to believe that God is\nnot all-powerful or not perfectly good. The argument can be taken in\nat least two ways. According to one interpretation, the problem of\nevil poses a challenge to belief in God. In other words, it is a\nstepping stone towards atheism. Another interpretation is that it is a\nchallenge to rethink the attributes of God. In this case, if one\nconsiders the argument sound, it is not belief in God that one should\nabandon, but belief in certain concepts of God. Process theists\ngenerally approach the problem of evil in the spirit of the second\ninterpretation. Moreover, they point out that to assume the first\ninterpretation\u2014that the problem of evil is an argument against\nthe existence of God\u2014is an invitation to beg the question\nagainst alternative proposals about the nature of God such as process\ntheism offers.\n\nA central contention of process theism is that the problem of evil is\naggravated by flawed accounts of omnipotence commonly assumed by\ntheists and their critics. Most theists agree with Aquinas that God\ncannot bring about logically impossible states of affairs, like\ncreating a circle with unequal radii (Summa Contra Gentiles\nII, ch. 25, para. 14). This is not, Aquinas argues, a limitation on\nGod but a condition of responsible theological discourse. To say, as\nDescartes does, that God could have made such irregularly shaped\ncircles, is to utter nonsense according to Aquinas (Cottingham 1991,\n25). Whitehead remarks that some medieval and modern philosophers got\ninto the unfortunate habit of paying God \u201cmetaphysical\ncompliments\u201d\u2014that is to say, attributing properties to God\nthat seem to make the divine more worthy of devotion but that are\ncontrary to sound metaphysical reasoning (Whitehead 1925, 258).\nWhitehead\u2019s observation is more applicable to Descartes than to\nAquinas. Indeed, process theism has no quarrel with Aquinas on this\npoint. It is rather, the stronger claim that God can bring about any\nstate of affairs the description of which is not contradictory, with\nwhich process theism takes issue. It is a fair question whether\nAquinas held this view (see Summa Theologica I, Q. 25, a. 3).\nNevertheless, it is a widely accepted view of omnipotence as Griffin\nmakes clear (Griffin 1976, chapter 17). In a deliberate play on J. B.\nPhillips\u2019 classic, Your God is Too Small, Tyron Inbody\nsums up the criticism of traditional accounts of divine power by\nsaying, \u201cYour God is too big\u201d (Inbody 1997, 139).\n\nGriffin warns against what he calls \u201cthe omnipotence\nfallacy.\u201d This is the fallacy of assuming that if a state of\naffairs is logically possible\u2014that is, its description involves\nno contradiction\u2014then an omnipotent being could single-handedly\nbring it about (Griffin 1976, 263f). Griffin represents all process\ntheists in considering it a fallacy, for it is their contention that\nthere are logically possible states of affairs that no being,\nincluding God, could bring about by itself. For example, a contractual\nagreement between two individuals or parties is impossible unless each\nagrees to keep the conditions of the contract. This is expressed\ncolloquially in English by saying, \u201cIt takes two to\ntango.\u201d The example of making contracts is especially relevant\nsince it is a theme in Jewish Scripture that God enters into numerous\ncovenants with the creatures. The emphasis is invariably on the divine\ninitiative in making the covenants and on God\u2019s reliability in\nkeeping a promise; nevertheless, when \u201ccovenant\u201d is not\nsimply shorthand for God\u2019s promises, the agreements are\ntwo-sided affairs, including God\u2019s blessings and demands and\nhuman obligations. Arguably, the logic of contracts, agreements, and\ncovenants, does not change when one of the parties is divine. These\nexamples are evidence that there are logically possible states of\naffairs that require something more than the decisions of God.\n\nHartshorne argues the case as follows. Suppose X and\nY are agents who make decisions A and B,\nrespectively. The conjunction, AB, is something that neither\nX nor Y, individually, decided, even if one of\nthe agents is God. Suppose, however, for the sake of argument,\nthat this reasoning does not apply in the divine case. According to\nthis view, if X is God, then it is possible for X to\ndecide not only A, but also AB. We can imagine that\nA represents God loving an individual and B\nrepresents the individual freely accepting God\u2019s love. If God\ndecides AB then God must also bring it about that B,\nthat the individual freely accepts God\u2019s love, for this is part\nof AB. Hartshorne responds that this view divorces the\nconcept of decision making from any meaningful connection with lived\nexperience. Numerous analogies have been discussed in the literature\nfor how free creatures might be related to a deity that makes their\ndecisions\u2014the creatures as God\u2019s marionettes; as androids\nprogrammed by God; as subjects hypnotized by God; as objects of\nGod\u2019s dreaming; as characters in God\u2019s novel. Each analogy\nfaces the dilemma that either the decisions of the person are not\nfully determined (e.g., the hypnotism case) or the person is not an\nactual individual (e.g., the fictional character case). In ordinary\nlanguage, an individual that tries to control a relationship is called\nmanipulative, overbearing, or colloquially, \u201ca control\nfreak.\u201d Doubtless, it was considering this kind of analogy that\nled Hartshorne to speak of \u201cthe tyrant ideal of\npower\u201d in classical theism (Hartshorne 1984a, 11). In a similar\nvein, Whitehead speaks of the idolatry of fashioning God in the image\nof imperial rulers: \u201cThe Church gave unto God the attributes\nwhich belonged exclusively to Caesar\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 342]).\n\nJames Keller argues that the traditional concept of omnipotence can\nonly be justified by appealing to metaphysical schemes or intuitions\nthat are no better established than omnipotence itself (Keller 2007,\n131). Hartshorne goes further and says that the traditional concept of\nomnipotence was not coherent enough to be false (Hartshorne 1978, 86).\nThe denial that an individual\u2019s free decisions can be totally\ndetermined by another is what is behind the slogan\u2014often found\nin discussions of process theism\u2014that God acts by persuasion\nrather than by coercion. Whitehead attributes this idea to\nPlato\u2019s later thought, in the Sophist and the\nTimaeus, and calls it, \u201cone of the greatest\nintellectual discoveries in the history of religion\u201d (Whitehead\n1933, 213; ch. X, sec. III). Unfortunately, the slogan has often been\nmisinterpreted, even by process thinkers. It does not mean that,\naccording to Whitehead and Hartshorne, God acts only as a final cause\nand never as an efficient cause, as Griffin has shown (Griffin 1991,\n98\u201399). \u201cCoercion,\u201d in the sense intended by the\nslogan, is the ability of one actual being to unilaterally bring about\nthe decision of another actual being. In process metaphysics, no\nindividual possesses this ability. Thus, in a metaphysical sense, it\nis not only God that acts persuasively and not coercively, but every\nactual being.\n\nOf course, \u201cpersuasion\u201d and \u201ccoercion\u201d have\nmeanings in ordinary language. To persuade is to convince others to do\nsomething of their own will. To coerce is to force\none\u2019s will upon others who are unwilling. The\nitalicized phrases are important, for they demonstrate that persuasion\nand coercion presuppose the ability of the individual who is being\npersuaded or coerced to make decisions. Even in the case of coercion,\nthe person being coerced retains the power to resist, even if only\nmentally. This indicates that coercion is an inferior form of power,\nused either out of ignorance or when persuasion has failed. Cobb says,\n\u201cIn my relations with other people, such as my children, the use\nof such power is a last resort which expresses my total powerlessness\nin all ways that matter\u201d (Cobb 1969, 89). Thus, even if the\nwords \u201cpersuasive\u201d and \u201ccoercive\u201d are taken in\ntheir ordinary, non-metaphysical, senses, it makes sense to speak of\nthe supreme or eminent form of power as persuasive rather than\ncoercive.\n\nDavid Basinger presses the following objection. Coercion in the\nordinary sense may be an inferior form of power, but there is\nsometimes a moral imperative to use it, otherwise we would never have\na police force. Thus, a deity that possesses both coercive and\npersuasive power is greater than a deity that possesses only\npersuasive power (Basinger 1988). Hartshorne, who argues against\nstrict pacifism, agrees that the use of brute force can sometimes be\nmorally justified. In response to the threat of Naziism he wrote,\n\u201cFreedom must not be free to destroy freedom\u201d (Hartshorne\n1941, 173). In process theism, however, coercion in the ordinary sense\nrepresents an indirect form of power that is available only\nfor localized beings within the cosmos (Hartshorne 1948, 155). It is\nindirect in the sense that it is exerted on aggregates of actual\nentities and not on actual entities themselves, as when one person\nprevents another from performing a vicious act by restraining the\naggressor\u2019s body. God\u2019s power over aggregates is nothing\nover and above the direct persuasive power over the actual entities\nthat comprise them. Barry Whitney argues that there is a coercive\naspect of God\u2019s power in process theism insofar as the laws of\nnature are the result of a divine decision that no creature is free to\nabrogate (Whitney 1985, 99\u2013114). That there should be this form\nof divine power\u2014which is also a form of efficient\ncausation\u2014providing for an ordered world that no creature has\ndecided, is a necessary condition for any creaturely activity,\nHartshorne believes. \u201cGod decides upon the basic outlines of\ncreaturely actions, and guaranteed limits within which freedom is to\noperate. That not everything can be guaranteed does not mean that\nnothing can be\u201d (Hartshorne 1966, 206).\n\nGriffin maintains that it lies at the heart of process theism\u2019s\nanswer to the problem of evil that God\u2019s power is exerted on\nindividuals rather than aggregates (Griffin 1991, 104). Theists of a\nmore traditional bent may view this as an indication of the inadequacy\nof process metaphysics, for there is no provision for a\nrun-of-the-mill coercive power in its concept of God. The idea that\npersuasion plus coercion is a greater form of power than persuasion\nalone ignores, however, a significant difference between God and the\ncreatures. Every person has the power of persuasion and coercion (in\ntheir ordinary senses), but neither of these powers involves a\nviolation of the laws of nature. In order to attribute both forms of\npower to God seems to require that God have the power to violate the\nlaws of nature. That may not seem unreasonable since God, as\ntraditionally conceived, acts miraculously in ways that break or\nsuspend the laws of nature. Nevertheless, to speak, as Basinger does,\nof a moral imperative to act coercively is tantamount, in the divine\ncase, to demanding that the deity contravene the very laws that,\naccording to traditional theism and process theism, it imposed in the\nfirst place. There is an additional irony where the problem of evil is\nconcerned. Traditional theists fault process theists for, in effect,\nnot attributing to God the power to prevent gratuitous suffering.\nTraditional theists, on the other hand, attribute this power to God\nbut are obliged to argue that God is not at fault for not using it or\nfor using it in ways that we find utterly baffling.\n\nA hallmark of process theism is to draw attention to the value\ninherent in the twin probabilities of genuine good and evil.\nProcess thought raises the question\u2014and answers it in the\naffirmative\u2014whether a world with a probability, not merely a\npossibility, of genuine good and evil is preferable to a world without\nit. In the closing pages of Pragmatism, James raises this\nquestion by means of a thought experiment. If God asked you before the\ncreation of the universe if you would agree to be part of a world that\nwas not certain to be saved\u2014where there was real adventure and\nreal risk\u2014what would you say? James recognizes that a world\nwhere the risk of failure is real does not appeal to everyone; but he\nsays that the chances for success that it promises brings zest to life\nand makes it rational to, \u201cadd our fiat to the\nfiat of the creator\u201d (James 1907, 290\u2013291). In\nfairness, however, the freedom that makes life an adventure must be\njudged against the probabilities of debilitating diseases, natural\ndisasters, the horrors of history, and cosmic catastrophes. Freedom\nis, in Hartshorne\u2019s words, a \u201cperilous experiment.\u201d\nGeorge Shields called this \u201cthe hard problem\u201d of a\nspecifically process theodicy (2014, 33). And Hartshorne admitted that\nif he played at questioning God, it was at this point (1984, 126).\n\nHartshorne says that a universe with multiple freedom or creativity is\na universe where the non-identical twins of opportunity and risk are\ninevitable. As already noted, process theists do not believe in a God\nthat plays with loaded dice. What James\u2019s image adds to this\npicture is the idea that a world-order with the opportunity for\ngenuine good and the risk of genuine evil is of greater value\nthan a world-order devoid of these opportunities and risks.\nJames\u2019s idea also implies that, in such a world-order, the risks\nwould be real for deity. We have already seen that process theism\naffirms tragedy in God. The silver linings on this cloud are: (1) God\npreserves the universe in the divine memory which means that the\ncreatures contribute something to God; (2) God, considered as\nsuperject, has an inexhaustible capacity to bring order from chaos and\nmake fresh beginnings, providing a sense of hope amidst the ruin of\nour lives.\n\nThe problem of evil is often presented primarily as an ethical\nconcern, but there is an aesthetic dimension to the problem that is\nemphasized by process theism (cf. Whitney 1994). If a perfectly good\ndeity would have the motive to overcome discord and wickedness, it\nwould also have a motive to avoid triviality and boredom. This is\nespecially the case in the universe as conceived by process theism\nwhere feeling (prehension) is a metaphysical category. The etymology\nof \u201caesthetic\u201d is aesthesis, which means\n\u201cfeeling,\u201d and process thought emphasizes that aesthetic\nvalues are fundamentally values for an experiencing subject. Moreover,\nthe experiencing subject, in most cases, is not human. This fact is\nevident not only by looking at the contemporary world with its\ncountless varieties of species, but also when one considers the nearly\nunfathomable stretches of time on this planet when humans did not\nexist. Process theism takes the non-anthropocentric, and\nnon-relativist, stance that the experiences of non-human creatures are\nvaluable whether or not humans value them. This is not to say that all\nexperience is equally valuable\u2014the experience of a cockroach can\nhave value without being fully comparable to human experience. Process\nmetaphysics provides for an aesthetic theory that recognizes objective\ncriteria of value such as unity amid contrast and intensity amid\ncomplexity (see Dombrowksi 2004). The long process of evolution can be\ncharted on a curve of ever increasing varieties and complexities of\norganisms with augmented capacity for valuable types of experience. As\nCobb and Griffin note, the escape from triviality meant an increased\nrisk of discord, but this brings us full circle to James\u2019s\nthought experiment (Cobb and Griffin 1976, 73).\n",
