    "main_text": "Classical Period || Fallacies in arguments and missteps in debates\n3.3 Fallacies in arguments and missteps in debates\n\nThe obverse side of identifying a proper argument is identifying\nfallacious arguments. Fallacious arguments include, on the one hand,\nsyllogisms whose reasons have been identified as specious and, on the\nother hand, counter arguments, or rejoinders, identified as\ndefective.\n\nThe Caraka-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (CS 3.8.57) identifies and\nillustrates three kinds of arguments as defective. The first chapter\nof the fifth book of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 5.1) lists\nand briefly describes 24 arguments, which it designates as fallacious\nrejoinders (j\u0101ti). The fourth chapter of the\nF\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n lists and describes\ntwenty such arguments, which are either the same as, or similar to,\nthe arguments identified as fallacious rejoinders in the chapter of\nthe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra just mentioned. Surprisingly, the\nF\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n treats these\narguments as good rejoinders, as noted by Kajiyama (1989 p. 108). The\nmost interesting treatments of fallacious rejoinders are those found\nin the R\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n and in the\nV\u0101da-vidhi, where many of fallacious rejoinders have\nnames which are the same as those exemplified in the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (Ono 2020 \u00a73.2 and \u00a73.5).\n(See also Randle 1930 ch. 6.2 and Solomon 1976 ch. 5.)\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra (VS 3.1.10\u201311) and\nthe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 1.2.4\u20139) name kinds of\nspecious reasons (hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa), but give neither\nexamples nor explanations of what they are. Three kinds are listed,\nand even briefly discussed, in the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101\n(CS 3.8.57). The F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n\nmerely lists eight kinds. Three kinds are exemplified and briefly\ndiscussed both in the V\u0101da-vidhi and in the\nR\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n. (See Randle 1930 ch. 3.5 and\nSolomon 1976 ch. 7.)\n\nBesides identifying fallacious syllogisms and rejoinders, some of\nthese texts also have either extended passages or entire chapters\ndevoted to the identification of behavior in debates which, when\ndisplayed by someone, warrants his being deemed to have lost. These\nmissteps, known as grounds for defeat\n(nigraha-sth\u0101na), range from making fallacious arguments\nto infringing the rules of debate procedure. The second chapter of the\nfifth book Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 5.2) sets out 22 cases,\nas does the third chapter of the R\u00fash\u00ed\nl\u00f9n. An extended passage of the\nCaraka-sa\u1e41h\u012bta (CS 3.8.50\u201365) lists 14\ncases. Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s Hetu-vidy\u0101 has an extended\npassage which classifies them into three kinds and provides cases of\neach. (See Randle 1930 ch. 6.3 and Solomon 1976 ch. 6.)\n",
