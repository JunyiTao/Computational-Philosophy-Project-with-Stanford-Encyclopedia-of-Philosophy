Interactions and their Effect on the Threshold between Natural Selection and Random Drift\n\nThe existence of either genotype-by-environment interaction \\((\\rG\n\\times \\rE)\\) or gene-by-gene interaction (epistasis or \\(\\rG \\times\n\\rG\\)) greatly complicates the estimation of selection coefficients.\nEcological geneticists like Ford postulated interactions of the sort\nthat could change the sign of genic selection coefficients with\nchanges in the environment (including density) or in the genetic\nbackground. This kind of reversal of selective effect requires what is\nknown as a \u201ccrossing-type\u201d norm of reaction for \\(\\rG\n\\times \\rE\\) or additive-by-additive epistasis for \\(\\rG \\times \\rG\\)\n(Wade 2002). The simplest model of crossing-type \\(\\rG \\times \\rE\\),\nconsists of additive selection (i.e., genotypic fitnesses of \\(1 + 2s,\n1 + s\\), and 1 for genotypes AA, Aa, and aa, in one environment and\nthe opposite order in the second environment) in each of two\nalternative environments, \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\), with frequencies,\n\\(f_{E_1}\\) and \\(f_{E_2}\\), respectively. As the two environments\nfluctuate in frequency, spatially or temporally, the selective effect\nof an A allele changes in both magnitude and sign (see\n Fig. 2).\n Depending upon the relative frequencies of the alternative\nenvironments and the amount of gene flow or migration between them,\nthe A allele on average can be a \u201cgood\u201d gene or a\n\u201cbad\u201d gene with respect to fitness, a gene of major effect\nor minor effect on fitness, or even a neutral gene if the two\nenvironments are equally abundant. The smaller the amount of migration\nbetween the environments, the greater is the degree of local\nadaptation to each as theory and\n Ford suggested (see above).\n However, the average selective effect of the gene in the\nsense of Fisher\u2019s theory must be smaller than the average\nobservation in a particular locality at a particular time because the\nlong-term average contains both positive and negative values of \\(s\\).\nFurthermore, to the extent that the local value of \\(s\\) changes sign\nowing to continuous fluctuations in local environmental conditions,\nthe average effect on fitness A allele will also move downwards, from\nthe domain of selection to the domain of drift as Wright suggested.\nThus, the very kind of population subdivision imagined by Ford, with\nselection acting in every locality albeit in different directions,\ncreates, rather than eliminates, an increased opportunity for random\ngenetic drift. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The interaction of Random\nGenetic Drift and Natural Selection, when there is either\ngenotype-by-environment interaction or additive-by-additive epistasis\n(see text). The selective effect, \\(s\\), of a single gene changes\nmagnitude as the frequency of the alternative environments,\n\\(f_{E_1}\\) and \\(f_{E_2}\\), connected by gene flow, changes\nor as the frequency of alternative alleles, \\(p_B\\) and\n\\(p_b\\), change at an interacting locus. Thus, neither the selective\neffect of a gene nor the effective population size remains constant.\nAs a result, relative to\n Figure 1,\n the threshold boundary between the domains of Natural Selection and\nRandom Genetic Drift is greatly widened, meaning that both forces play\nmore or less equal evolutionary roles over a broad range of values of\n\\(s\\) and \\(N_e\\). Furthermore, interactions of this sort open the\npossibility that changes in the relative frequencies of alternative\nenvironments or alternative alleles at other loci can move a\ngene\u2019s selective effect from the domain of selection that of\ndrift or vice versa during the course of its evolution. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nA very similar effect on the \u201cgene\u201ds eye view\u2019 of\nselection is caused by additive-by-additive epistasis (Goodnight &\nWade 2000; Wade 2001, 2002). The simplest model of this kind of \\(\\rG\n\\times \\rG\\), with interaction between loci A and B, each with\nalternative alleles, results in an average genic selection coefficient\nacting on the A allele of \\(s(p_B - p_b)\\), where \\(p_B\\) and \\(p_b\\)\nare the frequencies of alternative alleles at the B-locus that\ninteract in the additive-by-additive model with alleles at the A\nlocus. The relative frequencies of the alternative alleles at the B\nlocus, determine whether the A allele is a \u201cgood\u201d gene or\na \u201cbad\u201d gene with respect to fitness, a gene of major\neffect or minor fitness effect, or even a neutral gene when the\nbackground alleles are equally abundant (i.e., \\(p_B = p_b)\\).\nWhenever allele frequencies of its epistatic partner change, either by\ndrift or selection, the A allele\u2019s selective effect also changes\nand, like the case of \\(\\rG \\times \\rE\\), it moves the boundary\nbetween the domains of natural selection and random drift\n (Fig. 2),\n increasing the domain of the latter at the expense of the former.\n",
