To say that\nA ought to do X (with respect to B) is to say\nthat on the available evidence A\u2019s doing X would be most\nlikely to maximize what some contextually specified person or group\nB takes to be good and to minimize what B takes to\nbe evil. But, construed as an account of what we actually mean, this\nis obviously incorrect. As Russell himself had nearly put it thirty\nyears earlier:\n\n\nIt is held that what we ought to do is that action, among all that are\npossible, which [is likely on the available evidence] to produce the\nbest results on the whole [according to some contextually specified\nstandard of goodness]; and this is regarded as constituting a\ndefinition of ought. I hold that this is not a definition,\nbut a significant proposition \u2026 It might be proved, in the\ncourse of moral exhortation, that such and such an action [is likely\non the available evidence to] have the best results [according to some\ncontextually specified standard of goodness]; and yet the person\nexhorted might inquire why he should perform the action. The exhorter\nwould have to reply: \u201cBecause you ought to do what [is likely\nto] have the best results [according to some contextually specified\nstandard of goodness].\u201d And this reply distinctly adds\nsomething. The same arguments by which good was shown to be\nindefinable can be repeated here, mutatis mutandis, to show\nthe indefinability of ought. (RoE: 101/Papers 4:\n573, somewhat modified)\n\n\nThus Russell is making exactly the same mistake that he accused Moore\nof making in 1904!\n (See above, \u00a74).\n\nAgain Russell might reply that he is not attempting to describe how we\nactually use \u201cought\u201d but making a suggestion\nabout \u201cought\u201d should be used. But if we are to ring out\nthe old \u201cought\u201d and ring in the new, we need to be assured\nthat this would be a good idea. And that requires something rather\nmore solid in the way of a cost/benefit analysis than Russell manages\nto supply.\n",
