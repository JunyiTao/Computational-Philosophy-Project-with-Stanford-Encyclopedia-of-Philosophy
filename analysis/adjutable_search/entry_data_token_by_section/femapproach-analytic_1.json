What Analytic Feminists Share with Other Feminist Philosophers\n\nOne way to encapsulate the agreement in positions and values among\nfeminist philosophers, regardless of their methodological\ninclinations, is to say that for feminist philosophers, both\nphilosophy and gender matter\u2014both are important to the\nlives of human beings. Feminists recognize that philosophy and\nphilosophers are part of the wider set of institutions of culture in\nwhich human beings live, understand themselves, and, only sometimes,\nflourish. Among the many functions of philosophy are the following: to\nhelp us to understand ourselves and our relations to each other, to\nour communities, and to the state; to appreciate the extent to which\nwe are counted as knowers and moral agents; to uncover the assumptions\nand methods of various bodies of knowledge, and so on. These kinds of\nphilosophical insights\u2014ones that concern our methods,\nassumptions, theories, and concepts\u2014can contribute to the\noppression of human beings as well as to their liberation (see, for\nexample, Langton 2000\u00a0and Vogler 1995). Given the current\nimbalances of power and privilege with which people live, philosophy\nhas social effects when it \u201cleaves everything as it is\u201d.\nWhen feminist philosophers say that traditional philosophy is already\npolitical, they are calling attention to these social effects.\nFeminists seek \u201cengaged\u201d philosophy that is potentially\nuseful to empower human beings rather than contribute to the\nperpetuation of a status quo in which people are subordinated by\ngender, race/ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, and so on. Of\ncourse, feminist philosophers disagree about the appropriate ways to\nwork this out, but they do agree that philosophy can influence lives\nand should influence them for the better.\n\nA second area of agreement among feminist philosophers is that gender\naffects not only our lives, but also philosophy itself. Feminists\ncriticize the misogyny of philosophers and the overt and covert\nsexism, androcentrism, and related forms of male bias in philosophy.\nFor example, philosophers have through the centuries made a variety of\nfalse and demeaning claims about \u201cthe nature of woman\u201d;\nthey have defined central concepts such as reason in ways that\nexcluded women of their cultures; they have made allegedly universal\nclaims about human nature, desire, or motivation that were, in fact,\nclaims more likely to be true of men of their own social class; and\nthey have believed methods and positions to be\n\u201cvalue-neutral\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d that were\ninstead promoting the interests of only the privileged groups. Once\nagain, while feminist philosophers agree on the existence of such\nkinds of male bias, they differ over the best ways to criticize it,\nthe extent to which various philosophical approaches can be\nreconstructed for feminist use, and so on. We turn to examples in\nsections five through seven below.\n\nFeminist philosophers argue that the kinds of male-biased views just\nnoted limit and distort philosophy on many levels\u2014from\nindividual concepts such as reason or autonomy to entire fields such\nas philosophy of mind. The remedy for these distortions and\nlimitations is not to substitute \u201cfemale bias\u201d for\n\u201cmale bias\u201d, but to understand the variety of roles that\ngender plays in the construction of philosophy. Feminists believe that\neven as philosophers pursue their traditional goals, the likelihood of\nprogress toward them is increased by heeding feminists\u2019 more\ninclusive and self-reflexive approach.\n\nIt is important to be clear that feminist philosophers realize that\ntraditional philosophy has been written largely by men who are\nprivileged in ways that go far beyond their gender. Feminists today\nmaintain that gender is only one facet of a complex nexus of mutually\ninfluencing axes of oppression and privilege that structure society\nand the social identities of human beings; other facets include\nrace/ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, class, and so on.\nFeminist philosophers doing \u201cintersectional analysis\u201d try\nto attend to this complexity. Although gender is only one facet, it is\nnevertheless an important one with a wide variety of implications for\nthe way we should do philosophy. Most feminists share points in common\nas they continue to critique other philosophers as well as try to\nreconstruct philosophy that is neither male-biased nor oppressive in\nany other respect. Let\u2019s briefly note a few of these points\nbefore moving on to disagreements.\n\nSince many traditional philosophers believe that their own\ntheories or methods have universal applicability, feminists find it\nappropriate to hold these philosophers\u2019 feet to the fire.\nFeminists explain that part of what it means for a moral theory or an\nepistemology to be universal is that it must be applicable to and\nusable by a full range of human beings, not just to and by members of\na dominant social group. For example, a moral theory should allow for\nmoral agency for any person regardless of social status and specific\ncomplex identity. An epistemological theory should be able to analyze\nfairly a full range of cognitive situations of a wide variety of human\nbeings. A good philosophical theory or method would systematically\ndisadvantage no one: men, women\u2014whether cis or\ntransgender\u2014as well as nonbinary individuals from any social\ngroup. For example, it would disparage no one\u2019s experiences, no\none\u2019s authority as a knower, and no one\u2019s goals as a moral\nor political agent. Such an approach postulates neither the\n\u201csameness\u201d of everyone nor the existence of \u201cgroup\ndifferences\u201d. Instead, it asks that philosophers attend to the\nfull range of human beings, including their wide variety of\nexperiences, interests and situations, when purporting to construct\n\u201cuniversally applicable\u201d theories.\nIt is dangerous to stop paying attention to gender too soon. Even\nif a feminist philosopher has a long-term goal of minimizing the\nimportance of gender, there is a risk of leaving too much unanalyzed\nif one leaps immediately from male-biased philosophy to gender-neutral\nphilosophy. Attention to the influence of gender implies a recognition\nthat philosophy is embedded in social structures and practices, so\nfeminist philosophers tend to use \u201cnaturalized\u201d or\n\u201csocialized\u201d methods to explain the \u201clocated\u201d\nor \u201csituated\u201d character of the subject who does philosophy\nas well as the objects of philosophical reflection. Of course, the\ndetails here vary widely among feminists. A related notion,\n\u201cnonideal\u201d philosophy (Mills 2005), is embraced by many\nfeminists who express the desire to produce philosophy that is\ngrounded in the material world full of human beings and institutions,\nall of which are flawed in very complex ways.\nPhilosophy must be normative at the same time it includes a\nnaturalized or socialized component. Feminist philosophers, like many\nnonfeminist philosophers, struggle to maintain the level of\nnormativity that they require in order to serve their philosophical\nand political goals. Again, details will vary concerning what level or\nkind of normativity is necessary.\n\n\nAlthough we return later to controversial aspects of these points,\nfeminist consensus is that although philosophy is a discipline that\npurports to be about and for all humanity, it has not been.\nPhilosophers have not appreciated the extent to which their theories\nand methods have underwritten and perpetuated cultures that have\nprevented the flourishing of at least half of their populations.\nPhilosophy that reflects a feminist sensibility would take account of\nthe relevance of philosophy to the lives of all human beings and\npromote the flourishing of every person. At the same time it would\nhelp philosophy to more nearly approximate its own ideals.\n",
