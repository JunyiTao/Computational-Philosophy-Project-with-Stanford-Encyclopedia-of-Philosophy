    "main_text": "Arguments for Fictionalism || The Oracle\n3.2 The Oracle\n\nSuppose a being you take to be an omniscient Oracle told you there are\nnot in fact any abstract entities; you come to believe this claim.\nWould you not go on talking as before? Wouldn\u2019t you continue to\nsay things like \u201cYou can\u2019t tile that rectangular floor\nwith 17 tiles, for 17 is a prime number\u201d and other seemingly\ncommitting sentences? And would anything really, so to speak, be or\nfeel different about your use of these sentences?\n\nIf the verdict is that we really would continue using these sentences\nas before and nothing would seem different about our use of them, then\nwe have here an argument for hermeneutic fictionalism. Surely after\nthe Oracle\u2019s pronouncement we no longer commit ourselves to the\nexistence of abstract entities. But if we are just going on as before,\nwe were not thus committing ourselves earlier either.\n\nThe Oracle argument has primarily been used in discussions of abstract\nobjects. But the strategy is clearly in principle generalizable. Take\nfor instance the moral case. Suppose an Oracle were to tell you that\nreally there are no moral facts. It can be argued that this would not\ncause you to change your practice of making moral assertions. The case\ncan be argued to be analogous with the mathematics case.\n\nSome brief remarks on the Oracle argument are in order. First, the\nOracle argument presumes that the ontological commitments of a\nspeaker\u2019s assertions are transparent to the speaker. It can\nlegitimately be denied that speakers have the relevant sort of access\nto their commitments. Second, the Oracle argument implicitly\nhighlights an important distinction. Fictionalism is often motivated\nby concerns about what we are and are not ontologically committed to.\nBut what should we focus on when gauging our ontological commitments\n\u2014 the beliefs that we have, or what commitments we take\non in our utterances? As presented, the Oracle argument in\nthe first instance speaks to what commitments we take on in our\nutterances: it does not speak directly to the question of what the\nontological commitments of our beliefs are. Third, as stated, the\nargument is obviously an argument for hermeneutic, not\nrevolutionary, fictionalism. An Oracle argument for revolutionary\nfictionalism would rather emphasize that the Oracle\u2019s statement\nwould give us no reason to abandon the discourse.\n\n(The Oracle argument is from Yablo 2000a. The thought experiment itself\nis originally from Burgess and Rosen 1997.) \n",
