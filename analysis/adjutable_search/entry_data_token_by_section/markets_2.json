    "main_text": "Arguments about markets\n3. Arguments about markets\n\nJudgments about markets are often \u201call things\nconsidered\u201d-judgments in which both defenders and critics can\nconcede certain points to one another, but hold that other arguments\noutweigh them. For the sake of clarity, the most common arguments\nabout markets are here presented along the lines of justifications and\ncriticisms. Some of these arguments apply to markets in general, some\napply to market societies, and others apply to specific markets (cf.\nalso 3.3 below). Many arguments, however, can be used on several of\nthese levels, and it depends on an author\u2019s goals how he or she\nuses them (for a book-length account of arguments for and against\nmarkets see also Buchanan 1985).\n",
