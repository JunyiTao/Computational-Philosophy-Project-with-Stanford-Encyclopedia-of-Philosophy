    "main_text": "Accounts of the Infelicity of Category Mistakes || The Presuppositional Approach\n3.4 The Presuppositional Approach\n\n\nThe fourth account of the infelicity of category mistakes is one\nthat places this in the context of a broader phenomenon\u2014that of\npresupposition failures. This account comes in several\ndifferent versions, some more semantic and some more pragmatic in\nnature. While each version can be seen as an instance of one of the\naccounts discussed above, it is instructive to discuss these various\n presuppositional accounts in\n tandem.[25]\n\n\nA widely recognized phenomenon in the study of language is that of\npresupposition. Consider the following sentences:\n\n(26)\nThe king of France is bald.\n(27)\nGeorge stopped smoking.\n(28)\nIt is Jill who murdered Jack.\n\n\n\nIt is standardly accepted that these sentences generate, respectively,\nthe presuppositions that France has a king; that George used to smoke;\nand that someone murdered Jack. What precisely this amounts to is a\nmatter of controversy in the theory of presupposition, but as a first\npass we can say that when these sentences are uttered in conversation,\nthe presupposed material is not the main point of the speaker\u2019s\nassertion and that participants in the conversation are expected to\nalready have accepted it. Moreover, when such sentences are uttered in\ncontexts where speakers do not already accept the presupposition, the\nutterance suffers from presupposition failure, and is consequently\ninfelicitous. For example, in current context, an utterance of (26)\nseems infelicitous because we all know France does not have a king,\nand an utterance of (28) is infelicitous in a context where it was not\n already commonly believed that Jack was\n murdered.[26]\n\n\nA particularly notable feature of presuppositions is that they project\ninto embedded contexts in predictable patterns. For example, it is\nstandardly accepted that if \\(s\\) presupposes \\(p\\) then not-\\(s\\)\nalso presupposes \\(p\\). Thus (29) also generates the presupposition\nthat France has a king, and is therefore equally infelicitous in\ncurrent context:\n\n(29)\nThe king of France isn\u2019t bald.\n\n\n\nMore interestingly, it is standardly accepted that if \\(s\\)\npresupposes \\(p\\) (which itself is presupposition free) then both\n\u2018\\(p\\) and \\(s\\)\u2019 and \u2018If \\(p\\) then\n\\(s\\)\u2019 are presupposition-free. This prediction accounts for\nwhy, even in contexts where participants in the conversations do not\naccept in advance that Jack was murdered, the following no longer\nsuffer from presupposition failure: \n\n(30)\nJack was murdered, and it was Jill that murdered him.\n(31)\nIf Jack was murdered, then it was Jill that\n    murdered him.\n\n\n\nThe presuppositional account of category mistakes maintains that\ncategory mistakes are infelicitous because they suffer from\npresupposition failure. Suppose, for example, that the predicate\n\u2018is green\u2019 triggers the presupposition that its subject has\na color. This means that \u2018The number two is green\u2019\ngenerates the presupposition that the number two has a color, a\npresupposition which is assumed to be false in nearly all contexts. A\nkey way to test this presuppositional hypothesis is to check it against\nthe various projection properties for presupposition, and indeed this\ntest seems to lend support to the hypothesis:\n\n(32)\n* The number two isn\u2019t green.\n(33)\nNumbers have colors, and the the number two is\n    green.\n(34)\nIf numbers have colors then the number two is\n    green.\n\n\n\nNote that (32) is just as odd as the original category mistake. By\ncontrast, while (33) and (34) may be unusual or false assertions, they\ndo not seem infelicitous in a similar manner. These projection\nproperties point to a key advantage of presuppositional accounts: they\nseem to predict a range of data on how category mistakes behave when\nembedded in complex environments. Unlike the WK account (\u00a73.2.3),\nthe presuppositional approach does not assume that every complex\nsentence with a category mistake as a constituent is infelicitous (for\nexample, it predicts that (34) is not infelicitous despite the\nembedded category mistake). On the other hand, unlike the SK and the\nsupervaluationist accounts (\u00a73.2.3), it predicts that sentences\nsuch as the following are infelicitous, given that the standard\nprojection rules for presupposition are that a conjunction inherits\nall the presuppositions of its first conjunct):\n\n(35)\n* The number two is green and Lisbon is the\n    capital of France.\n\n\n\nSo far, we have sketched the presuppositional account in very general\nterms. However, there are a variety of different ways to develop the\naccount. A first key question is how presupposition failure affects\nthe truth-value of a sentence. Category mistakes aside, the literature\non presupposition is split between views which maintain that sentences\nsuffering from presupposition failure are truth-valueless, and those\nthat maintain that while presupposition failure leads to infelicity,\nsuch sentences are nevertheless truth-valued. The former approach\nmaintains that \u2018The king of France is bald\u2019 is\ntruth-valueless, while the latter deems it to be infelicitous but\nfalse.\n\n\nAs applied to category mistakes, the former approach yields either a\nversion of the contentlessness view or of the truthvaluelessness\nview\u2014depending on whether one takes presuppositional failure to\nlead to a failure to express content or merely a failure to have a\ntruth-value. (From now on we will assume that this presuppositional\naccount is understood as a version of the truthvaluelessness view.) An\nimportant advantage of this version of the truth-valueless approach\nover the ones discussed previously is that it seems to correctly\naccount for the behavior of category mistakes embedded in complex\nsentences. However, note that the view still predicts that contentful\nsentences can lack truth-value, and more specifically that contentful\ninstances of logical tautologies (e.g. \u2018It\u2019s not the case\nthat two is green and two isn\u2019t green\u2019) can fail to be\ntrue.\n\n\nWhen we apply the latter approach - the claim that presupposition\nfailures do not lead to truth-value gaps\u2014to the case of\n category mistakes, we get a version of the pragmatic\n approach.[27]\n How does this account compare to the Gricean pragmatic account\ndiscussed above? As with other versions of the presuppositional view,\nthis account seems to fare better than the Gricean account in terms of\npredicting the behavior of category mistakes embedded in complex\nsentences. On the other hand, a significant disadvantage of the\npresuppositional account over the Gricean one is that, depending how\n the account is developed, it might require far more linguistic\n stipulations.[28]\n\n\nA second question which separates different versions of the\npresuppositional account is what kind of presuppositions are involved\nin the case of category mistakes. A natural hypothesis (endorsed by\nAsher (2011)) is that these are type presuppositions. For\nexample, we might suggest that \u2018is green\u2019 triggers the\npresupposition that its subject is a concrete object; that \u2018is\nprime\u2019 triggers the presupposition that its subject is a number;\nand that \u2018is pregnant\u2019 triggers the presupposition that\nits subject is a female. This has the advantage of supporting the\nintuition (borne in their name) that category mistakes have something\nto do with a misclassification of kinds or\ncategories. However, Magidor (2013, 139\u2013146) argues that the\npresuppositions involved are more specific that this: for example,\nthat the subject has a color in the case of \u2018is green\u2019, or\nthat it is either prime or composite in the case of\n\u2018prime\u2019. Her argument relies on discourses such as\nthese:\n\n(36)\nMathematician: you know, not only numbers, but\n    also polynomials are prime or composite. This polynomial, for\n    example, is prime.\n(37)\nDoctor: you know, we\u2019ve developed a method\n    that allows males to be pregnant too. This male, for example, is\n    pregnant.\n\n\n\nThese discourses seem entirely felicitous even though the final\nsentence in each discourse violates the proposed type presupposition.\nIn response a proponent of the type-presuppositional hypothesis might\nsuggest reverting to a different type-based hypothesis. For example, in\nresponse to (36) they might suggest that the presupposition generated\nis that the subject-term is a mathematical object. However,\nthis new proposal might be too liberal and because it fails to account\nfor why \u20182.145 is prime\u2019 is a category mistake and it might\nalso be too restrictive because it fails to account for other versions\nof the argument, where an expert suggests that a non-mathematical\n object can be prime as\n well.[29]\n So the question remains whether we can find a suitable kind to play the\nrelevant role here.\n\n\nA final question which separates different versions of the\npresuppositional account is the issue of what determines whether the\npresupposition is satisfied or not on a particular occasion. According\nto Asher (2011), the lexicon encodes the type that each lexical item\nbelongs to, and this in turn determines whether the relevant\npresupposition\u2014a type presupposition on his view\u2014is\nsatisfied. This lexical approach, however, faces similar problems to\nthose which we have seen with the meaninglessness view. The lexicon\ncannot predict that the following subject terms are of the wrong type\nin those contexts where the definite description or the demonstrative\npick out the number two:\n\n(38)\nThe thing I am thinking about is green.\n(39)\nThat is green.\n\n\n\nOne feature of the lexical approach which is worth highlighting is\nthat it sets apart the case of category mistakes from other instances\nof presupposition failures: clearly, it is not the lexicon that tells\nus whether John used to smoke, and hence whether \u2018John stopped\nsmoking\u2019 suffers from presupposition failure. This can be seen\neither as a disadvantage of the approach (because it does not\nassimilate category mistakes smoothly into the more general theory of\npresupposition) or as an advantage (because it might help explain what\nis distinctive about the infelicity associated with category\nmistakes).\n\n\nAn alternative approach, one that is applicable to presuppositions\nmore generally, is to maintain that it is worldly facts which\ndetermine whether the presupposition is satisfied or not. Thus for\nexample, \u2018John stopped smoking\u2019 suffers from\npresuppositional failure if and only if John in fact used not to smoke and\nsimilarly \u2018The thing Jill is thinking about is green\u2019\nsuffers from presupposition failure if Jill is thinking about the\nnumber two, but not if she is thinking about a table. According to a\nthird proposal, one in the spirit of Stalnaker (1973), what matters\naren\u2019t the actual facts, but rather which propositions\nare taken for granted by the participants in conversation. To\nsee how this differs from the \u2018worldly\u2019 approach, note\nthat on this Stalnakerian approach to presupposition, \u2018John\nstopped smoking\u2019 would suffer from presupposition failure in a\ncontext where participants take it for granted that John never did\nsmoke, even if they are wrong and John in fact used to smoke.\n\n\nIn so far as our primary aim is to account for the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes, this might point to an advantage of using the\nStalnakerian approach to presupposition over the worldly one. Consider\nfor example, an utterance of:\n\n(40)\nThe thing Jill is thinking about is green.\n\n\n\nThis utterance would be infelicitous in a context where participants\ntake for granted that Jill is thinking about the number two (even if\nin fact she is thinking about a table), and felicitous in a context\nwhere it is taken for granted that Jill is thinking about a table (even if in fact she is thinking about a the number two), so the\nStalnakerian view predicts that presupposition failure patterns\nexactly with the infelicity characteristic of category\nmistakes. Moreover, the Stalnakerian approach seems to be particularly\nwell-suited for explaining why the infelicity of category mistakes\nvaries across a range of contextual settings. Consider, for example,\nthe following:\n\n(41)\nThe priest is pregnant.\n\n\n\nIn contexts where it is taken for granted that priests are male, (41)\narguably functions as a category mistake. However, in other\ncontexts\u2014ones where speakers are aware of churches that ordain\nfemale priests\u2014the sentence can be entirely felicitous. And\nindeed, the Stalnakerian approach predicts that whether the sentence\nsuffers from the relevant presupposition failure depends precisely on\nwhat is taken for granted in conversation.\n\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that a presuppositional account of\ncategory mistakes which relies on the \u2018worldly\u2019 conception\ncan also account for these infelicity patterns, albeit in a more\nindirect way. The account can maintain that infelicity depends not on\nactual presupposition failure, but on being believed (perhaps falsely)\nto suffer from presupposition failure. \n\n\nWe have seen that there are various choice points for how to develop a\npresuppositional account of category mistakes. It might be thought to\nbe an advantage of the presuppositional account of category mistakes\n(on any of its versions) that it utilizes an independently motivated\nlinguistic theory. However, a significant disadvantage of utilizing\nsuch a theory is that it makes it harder for the presuppositional\napproach to account for what is distinctive about the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes, i.e., what distinguishes their infelicity from other\ncases of presupposition failure and explains why category mistakes\n form a distinctive and unified phenomenon (cf.\n \u00a71).[30]\n",
