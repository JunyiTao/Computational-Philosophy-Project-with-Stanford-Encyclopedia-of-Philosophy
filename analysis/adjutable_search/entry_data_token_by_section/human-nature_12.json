    "main_text": "Explanatory Human Properties || Abandoning Intrinsicality\n4.2 Abandoning Intrinsicality\n\nThere has, however, been a move in general philosophy of science that,\nif acceptable, would transform the relationship between the taxonomic\nand explanatory features of species. This move was influentially\ninitiated by Richard Boyd (1999a). It begins with the claim that the\nattempt to define natural kinds in terms of spatiotemporally\nunrestricted, intrinsic, necessary and sufficient conditions is a\nhangover from empiricism that should be abandoned by realist\nmetaphysics. Instead, natural kinds should be understood as kinds that\nsupport induction and explanation, where generalisations at work in\nsuch processes need not be exceptionless. Thus understood, essences of\nnatural kinds, i.e., their \u201cnatures\u201d, need be neither\nintrinsic nor be possessed by all and only members of the kinds.\nInstead, essences consist of property clusters integrated by\nstabilising mechanisms (\u201chomeostatic property clusters\u201d,\nHPCs). These are networks of causal relations such that the presence\nof certain properties tends to generate or uphold others and the\nworkings of underlying mechanisms contribute to the same effect. Boyd\nnames storms, galaxies and capitalism as plausible examples (Boyd\n1999b: 82ff.). However, he takes species to be the paradigmatic HPC\nkinds. According to this view, the genealogical character of a\nspecies\u2019 nature does not undermine its causal role. Rather, it\nhelps to explain the specific way in which the properties cohere that\nmake up the taxon\u2019s essence. Moreover, these can include\nextrinsic properties, for example, properties of constructed niches\n(Boyd 1991: 142, 1999a: 164ff.; Griffiths 1999: 219ff.; R. Wilson et\nal. 2007: 202ff.).\n\nWhether such an account can indeed adequately explain taxonomic\npractice for species taxa is a question that can be left open here\n(see Ereshefsky & Matthen 2005: 16ff.). By its own lights the\naccount does not identify conditions for belonging to a species such\nas Homo sapiens (Samuels 2012: 25f.). Whether it enables the\nidentification of factors that play the explanatory roles that the\nterm \u201chuman nature\u201d might be supposed to pick out is\nperhaps the most interesting question. Two ways in which an account of\nhuman nature might be developed from such a starting point have been\nsketched.\n\nAccording to Richard Samuels\u2019 proposal, human nature should be\nunderstood as the empirically discoverable proximal mechanisms\nresponsible for psychological development and for the manifestation of\npsychological capacities. These will include physiological mechanisms,\nsuch as the development of the neural tube, as well as environmentally\nscaffolded learning procedures; they will also include the various\nmodular systems distinguished by cognitive science, such as visual\nprocessing and memory systems (Samuels 2012: 22ff.). Like mere list\nconceptions (cf.\n \u00a73.2),\n such an account has a precedent in Hume, for whom human nature also\nincludes causal \u201cprinciples\u201d that structure operations of\nthe human mind (1739\u201340, Intro.), for example, the mechanisms of\nsympathy (III,iii,1; II,ii,6). Hume, however, thought of the relevant\ncausal principles as intrinsic.\n\nA second proposal, advanced by Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz,\nexplicitly suggests taking explanandum and explanans to be picked out\nby different uses of the expression \"human nature\". In both\ncases, the \u201cnature\u201d in question is that of the taxon, not\nof individual organisms. The former use simply refers to \u201cwhat\nhuman beings are like\u201d, where \u201chuman beings\u201d means\nall species specimens. Importantly, this characterisation does not aim\nat shared characteristics, but is open for polymorphisms both across a\npopulation and across life stages of individual organisms. The causal\nconception of human nature, what explains this spectrum of similarity\nand difference in life histories, is equated by Griffiths and Stotz\nwith the organism-environment system that supports human development.\nIt thus includes all the genetic, epigenetic and environmental\nresources responsible for varying human life cycles (Griffiths 2011:\n319; Stotz & Griffiths 2018, 66f.). It follows that explanatory\nhuman nature at one point in time can be radically different from\nhuman nature at some other point in time.\n\nGriffiths and Stotz are clear that this account diverges significantly\nfrom traditional accounts, as it rejects assumptions that human\ndevelopment has a goal, that human nature is possessed by all and only\nspecimens of the species and that it consists of intrinsic properties.\nThey see these assumptions as features of the folk biology of human\nnature that is as scientifically relevant as are folk conceptions of\nheat for its scientific understanding (Stotz 2010: 488; Griffiths\n2011: 319ff.; Stotz & Griffiths 2018: 60ff.). This raises the\nquestion as to whether such a developmental systems account should not\nsimply advocate abandoning the term, as is suggested by Sterelny\n(2018) on the basis of closely related considerations. A reason for\nnot doing so might lie in the fact that, as talk of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d is often practised with normative intent or at least\nwith normative consequences (Stotz & Griffiths 2018: 71f.), use of\nthe term to pick out the real, complex explanatory factors at work\nmight help to counter those normative uses that employ false, folk\nbiological assumptions.\n",
