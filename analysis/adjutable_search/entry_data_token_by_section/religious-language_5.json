    "main_text": "The Content of Religious Utterances || Reductionism\n2.4 Reductionism\n\nA variety of philosophical positions go by the name\n\u201creductionism\u201d but reductionist theories of language aim\nto give the truth conditions for sentences that are apparently about a\ncertain range of phenomena in terms of sentences about some other\nrange of phenomena. We can call these (following Dummett 1991: 322)\nthe disputed and reduced class of sentences\nrespectively. Commonly discussed examples include logical behaviourism\n(see Graham 2017), which reduces sentences about mental states to ones\nabout behaviour, and temporal reductionism (see Markosian 2016) which\nproposes that sentences about time can be reduced to sentences about\ntemporal relations between things and events. Most varieties of\nreligious reductionism posit various naturalistic phenomena as the\nsubject of the reduced class of sentences. Unlike other positions\nconsidered in this section, religious reductionists agree with face\nvalue theories that religious utterances have propositional content,\nhowever, they argue that the content in question is not the face value\nsubject matter but instead the subject matter described by the reduced\nclass of sentences.\n\nA variety of reductionism adopted by early Christian writers in their\ntreatment of pagan religion, such as Lactantius ([4th\ncentury] 1871: 22) and Augustine (The City of God, VII ch.\n18), proposes that the pagan deities were based on real, mortal\nhistorical figures revered after their death for their contributions\nto human society and subsequently elevated to the status of gods.\nHowever, this is clearly not a linguistic reductionism.\nAugustine\u2014in a chapter titled \u201cA more credible cause of\nthe pagan error\u201d\u2014aims to discourage and debunk pagan\nbeliefs: they are fictions inspired by the benevolent deeds of mortal\nleaders. Linguistic reductionism does not seek to explain religious\nbelief but identifies a reductive class of sentences by which the\ntruth or falsity of sentences in the disputed class is determined.\n\nLinguistic reductionism has never received widespread support, and has\nnever been developed systematically or comprehensively for religious\nlanguage. Nevertheless, it has an interesting pedigree. For example,\nSpinoza, one of the most influential defenders of pantheism, suggested\nways of interpreting sentences about God in terms of facts about\nnature (Mason 2007). He\nwrites: \n\n\nBy God\u2019s direction I mean the fixed and immutable order of\nNature, or chain of natural events \u2026 So it is the same thing\nwhether we say that all things happen according to Nature\u2019s laws\nor that they are regulated by God\u2019s decree and direction.\n([1667] 2002: 417) \n\n\nSince all human actions are, according to Spinoza, the product of the\npredetermined order of nature, we can\u2014following the reductive\nstrategy\u2014say that nobody acts except by the will of God.\nSimilarly, since anything that we can achieve is produced by either\nour own actions and/or by external conditions, all such achievements\ncan be understood as the result of divine providence. So, for example,\n(6) is true if (5) is true.\n\n(5)Nobody acts except\nby the will of God.\n(6)All actions are the\nproduct of the predetermined order of nature.\n\n\nSpinoza also proposes naturalistic reductions of talk about the Holy\nSpirit (1667 [2002, 525]), divine action and providence (1667 [2002,\n445]) and miracles (1667 [2002, 448]).\n\nNaturalistic interpretations of religious language became popular in\nthe 1920s in both Britain and America. For example, Julian Huxley\n(1931) suggests that talk of God could be understood as a way of\ntalking about forces operating in nature or about aspects of nature\nthat we do not understand (see Bowler 2001), and proposes naturalistic\ninterpretations of talk of the Holy Ghost and the Son of God (1927:\n37). Influential early figures in the American tradition of\n\u201creligious naturalism\u201d or \u201creligious\nempiricism\u201d are Bernard Meland (1976) and Henry Wieman\n(1932). Wieman offers various naturalistic accounts of talk of God,\nusually identifying God with natural processes that yield or\nfacilitate ethically or socially desirable results.\n\nAlso notable is the work of Gordon Kaufman, a leading figure in the\ndevelopment of modern liberal theology. He observes that in many cases\nthe natural phenomena that are integral to giving our lives meaning\nare deeply mysterious, for instance, that humans are capable of\nconsciousness and thought and the appreciation of beauty. He contends\nthat \u201cGod\u201d is the name given to the \u201cpervasive\nmystery\u201d that gives life meaning (2007: 12). Saying that\nGod is \u201creal\u201d or \u201cexists\u201d express the belief\nthat underpinning this \u201cpervasive mystery\u201d are natural\nforces that promote and facilitate ethical, aesthetic and social human\nflourishing (1981: 49).\n\nDoes truth-conditional reductionism offer a plausible theory of\nreligious language? The obvious place to start is to consider whether\nor not there are any compelling reasons to prefer a reductive rather\nthan a face value theory. Unfortunately, reductionists appear to\nstumble at this first hurdle. It is clear from the writings of\nreductionists that the reductionist interpretation of religious\ndiscourse is not advanced from a consideration of the meanings of what\nspeakers say when they talk about God but instead on the basis of\nreligious or metaphysical theories about the nature of the\nuniverse. However, the belief that there is no creator God is not a\nreason for giving naturalistic truth-conditions to (1); it is a reason\nfor thinking that (1) is false. Notably, even among writers more\nsympathetic to linguistic reductionism we find lapses into\nnon-linguistic reductionism. For example, while Kaufman sometimes\npresents his theory as an account of what is meant by talk about God,\nat other times he presents a much more clearly revisionary\nproposal. He writes, \u201cIt is this cosmic serendipitous\ncreativity, I suggest, that we should today think of as\nGod\u201d (Kaufman 2007: 26, my italics) and he proposes that the\n\u201ctraditional notion\u201d of God\u2019s purposive activity in\nthe word should be replaced with \n\n\nwhat I call trajectories or directional movements\nthat emerge spontaneously in the course of evolutionary and historical\ndevelopments. (2007: 25)\n\n\nFor further discussion of reductionism see Alston 2005 and Scott 2013:\nch. 9; the latter also discusses subjectivist versions of\nreductionism.\n",
