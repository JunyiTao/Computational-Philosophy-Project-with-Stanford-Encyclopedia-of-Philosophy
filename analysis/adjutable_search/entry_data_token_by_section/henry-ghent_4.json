Subjective Possibility and Objective Possibility\n\n\nHow does this conclusion accord with Avicenna's theory that\nintentio de re precedes intentio de esse? Essence\nexists in the measure in which it participates in divine being. There\nare nevertheless two possible interpretations of the concept of\nparticipation. In the first, essence is a kind of potential substratum\nthat is filled by existence at the moment of its actualization. In this\nsense, essence would be in potency to being as matter is to form.\nHowever, as Henry often stresses in his debate with Giles, this is a\n\u201cfar-fetched image\u201d (phantastica imaginatio),\nsince likening physical generation to creation seriously compromises\nthe idea of creation from nothing. In generation, form is not educed\nfrom nothing, but from pre-existing matter. Similarly, if essence were\na potential substratum, being would not be created from nothing, but\nfrom essence itself. The second interpretation makes essence the object\n(that is, the term or result), not the subject of creation: essence is\nconstituted as such in virtue of its relation of participation with the\nCreator.\n\n\nHenry here adduces one of the most characteristic and original\naspects of his metaphysical system: the distinction between\npotentia subiective and potentia obiective (H\u00f6dl\n1963, Porro 1996). Something can be in potency with regard to a given\nact, either as the subject (subiectum) from which something\nelse can or must be produced (as in the case of matter with regard to\nform), or as the object (obiectum) that constitutes the result\nitself of production (as in the case of generation, the form, or more\nprecisely, the combination of matter and form). In the first case, the\nagent intervenes, impressing itself, or something else (as form), on\nthe already available potential substratum. In the second case, there\nis no effective potency with regard to the acquisition of another form,\nbut only with regard to the agent. Hence, essence is placed in act\nthrough creation, not because a form educed from its potency is\nimpressed on it, but because it constitutes the result itself of the\nagent's action. Essence is not in potency in relation to being,\nbut in relation to itself, as a totality constituted in being.\n\n\nNevertheless, this theory raises a problem. In every transmutation,\nwhat changes cannot strictly coincide with the terms themselves of the\nchange. If essence is possibile esse and non esse,\nand passes from non-being to being through creation, it must be\ndifferent both from non-being (the state before creation) as well as\nfrom being (the state after creation). If, on the other hand, essence\nwere identical to one of the two terms (being, in the case in\nquestion), then there would be no change, since essence would never be\nin non-being. To obviate this problem, Henry seeks to refine further,\nespecially in his later Quodlibeta, the distinction between\npossibile subiective and possibile obiective, so\nthat, within certain limits (that is, from a logical rather than from\nan ontological perspective), essence can figure as the\nsubiectum, and not just the terminus, of creation. Even\nthough the passage of essence from non-being to being happens in a\nsingle, indivisible instant, it can nevertheless be subdivided\nlogically (secundum rationem) into three different\n\u201csigns\u201d (signa); an ante litteram example\nof the theoretical model defined by Kretzmann and Spade as\n\u201cQuasi-Aristotelianism\u201d, especially in reference to\n14th century writers such as Landolph Caracciolo and John of\nBaconthorpe (Kretzmann 1982, Spade 1982). In the first signum,\nessence loses its non-being; in the second, essence occupies an\nintermediate position between the non-being it is abandoning and the\nbeing it is acquiring, and in this sense it is the subiectum\nof the transmutation; finally, in the third, essence has acquired its\nbeing, and as such it is the terminus of the change\n(Summa, art. 59, q. 2, ed. 1520, f. 138vR).\n",
