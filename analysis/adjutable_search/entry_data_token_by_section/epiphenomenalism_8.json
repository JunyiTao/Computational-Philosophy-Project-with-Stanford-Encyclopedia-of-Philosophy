    "main_text": "Arguments in the Age of Materialism || Mental Properties and Distinctive Causal Powers\n3.3 Mental Properties and Distinctive Causal Powers\n\nL. A. Shapiro and E. Sober (2007) have developed an alternative line\nof argument that they hold to apply just as well to functional\nproperties and properties that resist functional analysis. The\ndistinction between common causation and realization plays a key role.\nCommon causation, they note, can lead to an empirically based denial\nthat one co-effect causes another. For example, tail length in mice\noffspring is caused by their parents\u2019 genes, not by their\nparents\u2019 tail length \u2014 and this can be empirically shown\nby cutting parental tails (which, of course, leaves their genotype\nconstant) and observing no effect on tail length of offspring.\n\nIt is impossible, however, to suppress a realized condition while\nleaving its realizer constant, so there is no sense to the demand that\nbeliefs should have causal powers that are additional to the causal\npowers of their neural state realizers. Nor is it possible to suppress\na phenomenal quality while holding constant a state with its\n(allegedly) identical neural property. Thus, saying that \u201cthere\nis nothing left for the property of being a belief (or a phenomenal\nquality) to do, once the neural realizer (or identical neural\nproperty) has done its work\u201d does not undercut the efficacy of\nthe beliefs or phenomenal qualities. It shows only that beliefs (or\nphenomenal qualities) do not satisfy a demand (for an\n\u2018extra\u2019 causal contribution) that is incoherent in\nitself.\n\nJ. A. Baltimore (2010) has responded by arguing that there are reasons\nother than that illustrated by the mice tails example for denying\nefficacy to mental events. M. Baumgartner (2010; see Woodward, 2015\nfor response) suggests that Shapiro and Sober\u2019s approach depends\non a certain (interventionist-inspired) view of causation, but that\nattributions of causation in virtue of mental properties cannot be\ncounted as making sense without departing from the terms of that view.\nWhether this strong critique is accepted or not, it is evident that\nremoving a reason for objecting to efficacy of mental events in virtue\nof their mental properties does not by itself provide a positive\nreason for asserting such efficacy.\n\nSuch a reason may, however, be found in the subset view proposed by\nShoemaker (2007). To briefly illustrate a key idea, suppose that a\ncertain belief, \\(M\\), can be realized by alternative physical states\n\\(P_1, \\ldots P_n\\). Suppose further that this belief is involved in\nan inference, and that its possessor arrives at a new belief, i.e.,\narrives at another state that has a new mental property, \\(M^*\\).\nSuppose, finally, that \\(M^*\\) can be realized by alternative physical\nstates \\(P^*_1, \\ldots, P^*_o\\), and that each \\(P_i\\) is a sufficient\nphysical cause for some \\(P^*_j\\). A particular \\(P_i\\) causes a\nparticular \\(P^*_j\\) by a particular causal route that need not be\nshared by other \\(P\\) to \\(P^*\\) instances, and so \\(P_i\\) has causal\npowers not shared by all instances of M. But any instance of \\(M\\)\nwould have been realized by a sufficient cause of some realizer of\n\\(M^*\\). Thus, \\(M\\)\u2019s causal powers include just those that are\nrelevant to bringing about \\(M^*\\) (assuming that other conditions,\ne.g., belief in other premises required for the inference, are held\nconstant). Given these assumptions, it is reasonable to conclude that\nit is \\(M\\) rather than its particular realizers that causally\ncontribute to \\(M^*\\), even though each instance of \\(M\\) is realized\nby some \\(P_i\\) that is a sufficient cause of a realizer of \\(M^*\\),\nand thus is sufficient for \\(M^*\\).\n\nThe subset view is the subject of lively debate; see, e.g., Antony\n2010, Audi 2012, Melnyk 2010, Shoemaker 2010. One objection is\nthat the subset view assumes rather than shows that M has any causal\npowers at all, and that this is the key question at issue (Kim 2010).\nReasons have been offered for doubting this assumption, i.e.,\naccepting epiphenomenalism, at least for beliefs and desires. Segal\n(2009) argues that being a belief and being a desire are dispositional\nproperties, and that dispositional properties are not efficacious.\nTammalleo (2008) supports an exclusion argument, and invokes\nmechanisms independently established by cognitive psychology to\nexplain why we have the mistaken intuition that mental states are\ncauses.\n",
