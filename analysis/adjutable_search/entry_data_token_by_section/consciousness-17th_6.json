    "main_text": "Spinoza || Complexity and Power\n3.3 Complexity and Power\n\nDespite the explicit reference to the \u201cideas of ideas\u201d\npassages in later discussions of consciousness, Stephen Nadler (2008)\nand Don Garrett (2008) think this is the wrong place to look for\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of consciousness. Instead, they develop their\ninterpretations from the thesis of mind-body parallelism.\n\nWhile Nadler is inclined to think that Spinoza does not have\na full-blown account of consciousness, what Spinoza does offer is\n\u201cvery suggestive\u2026for a particular kind of project, one\nthat represents a naturalistic account of consciousness that is\nprecocious in so far as it points the way to just the kind of\nempirical, scientific inquiry into consciousness that characterizes\ncontemporary neuroscience and (some) recent philosophy of mind\u201d\n(586). Quoting 2p13s and 5p39s, Nadler argues that the feature that is\nbeing tracked by the mind in consciousness is the structural\ncomplexity of the body. 5p39s reads as follows:\n\n\n[H]e who, like an infant or child, has a Body capable of very\nfew things, and very heavily dependent on external causes,\nhas a Mind which considered solely in itself is conscious of almost\nnothing of itself, or of God, or of things. On the other hand, he who\nhas a Body capable of a great many things, has a Mind which considered\nonly in itself is very much conscious of itself, and of God, and of\nthings.\n\nIn this life, then, we strive especially that the infant\u2019s Body\nmay change (as much as its nature allows and assists) into another,\ncapable of a great many things and related to a Mind very much\nconscious of itself, of God, and of things.\n\n\nFrom these passages, Nadler concludes that \u201chuman or higher\nconsciousness for Spinoza is nothing but the mental correlate of the\nsuperlative complexity of the human body\u201d (587). The result is\nthat consciousness, for Spinoza, is a matter of degree (as is\nsuggested in the passage above). Nadler also suggests the possibility\nthat this could be a threshold concept\u2014that there is a minimum\ndegree of complexity that must be satisfied before a mind could be\nconscious. But, citing Garrett\u2019s appeal to Spinoza\u2019s\nnaturalism, he dismisses the threshold view. And so, consciousness\ncomes in degrees, and all minds have it (contrary to the worries in\nthe ideae idearum\n section).[11]\n\n\nDon Garrett draws from the same texts as Nadler, but what he\nemphasizes in these passages is the difference in ability.\nNote in the above passage that Spinoza talks of the infant body as one\n\u201ccapable of very few things.\u201d And so the underlying\nfeature that consciousness tracks, according to Garrett, is the\nrelative power of the body (23\u201324). The more power a\nbody has, the greater the degree of consciousness in the mind. \n\nThe problem with this view, according to Nadler, is that \u201call\nthat Garrett is warranted in concluding from his argument and the\ncentral passages in question is that degrees of consciousness and\ndegrees of power of thinking in a mind vary proportionately, but not\nthat consciousness is itself identical to power of\nthinking\u201d (592\u201393). However, given Spinoza\u2019s\nrepresentational account of mind, the only two features that stand out\nas candidates for explaining consciousness are some features of the\nrepresentations themselves (their complexity) or the causal efficacy\nof the ideas (their power). (Cf. Della Rocca 2008 108\u2013118.)\n\nMichael LeBuffe has argued that the central passages on which most\nscholars have developed their interpretations should not be\nread as proposing a theory of consciousness; rather, these passages\nare focused on \u201cthe epistemological status of certain elements\nof conscious experience.\u201d Nevertheless, he does recognize that\nSpinoza requires a theory of consciousness and raises a particular\nproblem for Garrett\u2019s interpretation. On Garrett\u2019s\ninterpretation, the power of a mind and the power of its constituent\nideas could diverge. That is, there could be a very powerful mind\n(which is conscious to a high degree) whose ideas are relatively less\npowerful (of which the mind is conscious to a very low degree). That\nis, on Garrett\u2019s view, it is possible for a more powerful mind\n(as a whole) to have ideas all of which are less conscious than the\nideas in a less powerful mind, in which case it would be odd to\ndescribe the more powerful mind as having a higher degree of\nconsciousness (LeBuffe 2010, 557). LeBuffe argues to the contrary that\nSpinoza does not characterize the power of a mind (as a whole) in\nterms of its level of consciousness.\n\nEugene Marshall has proposed a development of Garrett\u2019s\ninterpretation, which reduces consciousness to\n\u201caffectivity\u201d (see Marshall 2014, chapter 4).\n\u201cAffectivity\u201d is the property an idea has when it\nincreases, decreases, or fixes the power of the mind\u2019s striving\n(its \u201cconatus\u201d) or when it moves the mind to act. Emotions\nsuch as joy or fear would be affective in this way, but so would\ncertain rational judgments. Marshall argues that this provides a more\ndeveloped account of how power is centrally involved in consciousness\nfor Spinoza while avoiding some of the problems of Garrett\u2019s\nproposal.\n",
