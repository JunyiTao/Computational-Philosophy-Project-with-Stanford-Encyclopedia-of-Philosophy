It is no accident\nthat one of the oldest philosophy journals is The Monist\n(started in 1888). A look through its early volumes reveals a mixture\nof scientific applications to the various categories of human\nexistence. Mach was a frequent contributor, and indeed a good friend\nof the editor, Paul Carus, who also arranged the English translation\nand publication of many of Mach\u2019s works.  In\n1906, Monistenbund, a monistic society, was formed with the\nintention of including everyone who believed that there was only one\nreality. Haeckel and Ostwald were active members and tried without\nsuccess to bring in Mach with an offer of the presidency in 1912. Mach\nwrote back:\n\n\nThere are as many different monisms as there are people in it.\nMonism is provisionally a goal, after which we all strive, but\nis scarcely anything fixed or sufficient \u2026 It seems to me\n\u2026 ludicrous to found a kind of religious sect, while\nrefusing to consider philosophical questions [as to its\nnature]. But this is not so terribly important in so far as the\nmovement is limited to a small circle of intellectuals. But if it\nexpands more widely, then it will probably let loose a kind of\ncounterreformation for which I definitely have no sympathy.\n[Blackmore 1972: 193\u20134]\n\n\n",
