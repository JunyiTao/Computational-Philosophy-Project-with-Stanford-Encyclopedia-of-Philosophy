    "main_text": "The genesis of an elaborate theory of signs in the second half of 13th century || Roger Bacon (ca. 1214-ca. 1293)\n4.2 Roger Bacon (ca. 1214-ca. 1293)\n\n\nRoger Bacon is probably the most important medieval theorist of sign\n\u2014 at least he is the author of the most extensive medieval tract\non signs known so\n far.[21]\n Starting from a minute analysis of the\nnotion of sign and its various divisions, Bacon develops both in De\nsignis (ca. 1267) and in his Compendium studii theologiae\n(1292) a general conception of signification as well as a detailed\ntheory of the linguistic sign, so that here, as in Augustine, semantics\nis integrated into a broader theory of sign in general. According to\nBacon, the concept of sign belongs to the category of relation. To be\nmore precise, a sign, as it was pointed out already in Augustine's\ndefinition, is a triadic relation, such that it is \u2014 in principle\n\u2014 a sign of something to someone. This way of\nputting the point, however, gives rise to the question of whether both\nrelata of this relation are equally essential for its\nexistence. What would happen if one of these relata did not\nexist? What if the designated thing ceased to exist? And what if there\nwere no cognitive power taking notice or even being able to take notice\nof the sign?\n\n\nBonaventura (ca. 1217\u20131274), one of the most renowned theologians of\nthe time, explicitly places emphasis on the sign's relation to the\nsignificate, claiming that\n\u2026 a sign has a twofold comparison: both to that\nwhich it signifies, and to that to which it signifies; and the first is\nessential and the sign always has it in act, but the second it has in\nhabit; and it is from the first that it is called a sign, not\nfrom the second. Whence a circle above a tavern is always a sign, even\nif no one looks at\n it.[22]\n\n\nIn direct opposition to this commonly accepted manner of\npresentation, Bacon lay stress on the \u2018pragmatic\u2019 relation\nto the sign-interpreter, for the notion of sign is, as he claims,\n\u201cessentially predicated with respect to someone to whom it\nsignifies. \u2026 For if no one could conceive something through the\nsign, it would be void and vain, nay, it wouldn't be a sign.\u201d\n(Roger Bacon, De signis, 1978, 81). Other than the essential\nrelation of an actual sign to its interpreter, which must be in any a\ncase what was called a \u2018real relation\u2019 (relatio\nrealis), the relation to the significate can be a so-called a\n\u2018relation of reason\u2019 (relatio rationis), for, as\nBacon adds: \u201cIt does not follow \u2018a sign is in act,\ntherefore the thing signified exists\u2019, because nonentities can be\nsignified by words just like entities\u201d (Roger Bacon, De\nsignis, 1978, 81). There are other important points in which Bacon\ndeviates from the common opinion: He defines the sign as \u201cthat\nwhich upon being offered to the sense or intellect designates something\nto the intellect itself\u201d (illud quod oblatum sensui vel\nintellectui aliquid designat ipsi intellectui), and emphasizes\nthat, contrary to what the common description says, there are signs\nwhich are offered only to the\n intellect.[23]\n\n\nBacon presents a detailed classification of\n signs[24]\n by\ntaking up, combining, and modifying elements of several prior sign\ntypologies. The division of the two main classes of natural and given\nsigns is taken from Augustine, the distinction between necessary and\nprobable signs is borrowed from Aristotle (an. pr. II, 27, 70a3-b5),\nand their subdivision according to their temporal reference is a\ntraditional element in the theories of the sacramental\n sign.[25]\n\n1. NATURAL SIGNS \n\n\n1.1 signifying by inference, concomitance, consequence \n\n\n1.1.1 signifying necessarily \n\n\n1.1.1.1 signifying something present (large extremeties \u2192\nstrength)\n1.1.1.2 signifying something past (lactation \u2192 birth of a\nchild)\n1.1.1.3 signifying something future (dawn \u2192 imminent\nsunrise)\n\n\n1.1.2 signifying with probability \n\n\n1.1.2.1 signifying sth. present (to be a mother \u2192 love)\n1.1.2.2 signifying sth. past (wet ground \u2192 previous rain)\n1.1.2.3 signifying sth. future (red sky in the morning \u2192\nrain)\n\n\n\n\n1.2 signifying by configuration and likeness (images, pictures,\nspecies of colour)\n1.3 signifying by causality (tracks \u2192 animal)\n\n\n2. SIGNS GIVEN AND DIRECTED BY A SOUL \n\n\n2.1 signifying instinctively without deliberation (sigh \u2192\npain; laughter \u2192 joy)\n2.2 signifying with deliberation (words)\n2.3 interjections\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general class of natural signs signifying unintentionally by\ntheir essence (1) is divided according to the relation between a sign\nand its significate into the three subclasses of (1.1) inferential\nsigns based on a more or less constant concomitance of sign and\nsignificate, (1.2) iconic signs, based on similarity in appearance, and\n(1.3) signs based on a causal relation between the sign and the\nsignified thing. The signs of inference (illatio) are\nsubdivided into (1.1.1) necessary and (1.1.2) probable signs, both of\nwhich are further differentiated according to the three possible\ndirections of temporal reference (present, past, future). Bacon gives\nto understand that he takes inferential and iconic signs to be signs\nmore properly than the members of third class, i.e., signs based on a\ncausal relation (later in the Compendium studii theologiae he\nwill drop this class entirely). He justifies this by pointing to the\nfundamental difference between sign relations and causal relation:\nwhereas sign relations are necessarily constituted by an interpreter,\ncausal relations exist independently of any such one alone by reason of\nthe order of\n nature.[26]\n\n\nThe general class of signs given and directed by a soul (signa\nordinata ab anima) (2) is divided according to whether the living\nbeing brings forth the sign (2.1) together with a deliberation by\nreason and choice of will (cum deliberatione rationis et electione\nvoluntatis), or (2.2) by a natural instinct or impulse\n(instictu naturali et impetu naturae). The reason for\ndistinguishing two modes of natural signifying, as they appear in (1)\nand (2.1), is, on the one hand, an equivocation of the concept of\nnature, meaning \u201csubstance or essence of something\u201d\n(substantia sive essentia cuiuslibet), as well as \u201cforce\nacting without deliberation\u201d (virtus agens sine\ndeliberatione) (De signis, 1978, 85f.) and, on the other\nhand, the insight that, contrary to what holds for the natural signs in\nthe first sense, in the case of the latter there is always a\nsign-giver, not only someone taking something as a sign. Interjections\n(2.3) are considered as a hybrid of the two other sorts of given\nsigns.\n\n\nIt has to be noticed that in Bacon's, as well as in any other\nmedieval sign-typology, the classes of signs \u2014 even though this\nis not explicitly stated by the authors themselves \u2014 distinguish\nmodes of signifying rather than signs in the sense of sign-vehicles.\nTherefore, one and the same thing, fact, or event may, in different\nrespects, fall under various and even opposite sign-classes. This fact\nis especially important for the full account of sign-processes in which\nspoken language is involved.\n\n\nThe primary intention of Bacon's semiotic analyses is, as it was\nalready with Augustine, to provide the foundations for the semantics of\nspoken language.[27]\n According to Bacon, an adequate and\ncomplete account of the \u201cdifficult issue\u201d (difficilis\ndubitatio) of what the significate of a vocal expression is has to\nconsider three different aspects: 1) the signification of vocal\nexpressions apart from impositio, i.e., apart from their being\nendowed with (conventional) meaning by \u2018imposition\u2019, 2)\ntheir signification according to imposition, and 3) their signification\nover and above imposition.\n\n\n1) Each vocal expression may serve independently from its imposition\nas a natural sign (De signis, 1978, 86f.) Words indicate for\ninstance the speaker being close, and they may \u2018tell\u2019\nsomething about him in the same way as an artwork is indicating the\nskills of the artist. Furthermore, the spoken word is a natural sign\nimplying that the speaker possesses the concept of the object meant by\nthe word according to its regular meaning. For the significative use of\nlanguage presupposes the presence of a concept in the speaker's mind\nthat corresponds to the object denoted (De signis, 1978, 85f.,\nComp. studii theol., 1988, 64). Thus, the relation between the\nvocal expression and the mental concept is, contrary to what was the\ncommon opinion since the days of Augustine and Boethius, not a relation\nof expression but rather of indexical signification.\n\n\n2) In his account of signification of words regarding their\n\u2018impositio\u2019 Bacon accentuates the arbitrariness of\nmeaning.[28]\n But even though the first\n\u2018impositor\u2019 (name-giver) is free to impose a word or sign\non anything whatsoever, he does perform the act of imposition according\nto the paradigm of baptism: \u201call names which we impose on things\nwe impose inasmuch as they are present to us, as in the case of names\nof people in\n Baptism\u201d.[29]\n Contrary to the venerable tradition of\nAristotelian, Boethian or Porphyrian\n Semantics,[30]\n holding that spoken\nwords, at least immediately, signify mental concepts, Bacon favors the\nview that words, according to their imposition, immediately and\nproperly signify the things themselves. With this account of linguistic\nsignification Bacon abandons the model of the semantic\n triangle[31]\n and\nmarks an important turning point on the way from the traditional\nintensionalist semantics to the extensionalist reference semantics as\nit became increasingly accepted in the 14th\n century.[32]\n\n\nBacon is, however, well aware of the fact that the use of names and\nwords in general is not restricted to the meaning endowed through the\nfirst act of imposition (the term \u2018homo\u2019 does not only\ndenote those men that have been present when the original act of its\nimposition took place); nor do words cease to be used when their\noriginal significata (things signified) no longer physically\nexist (Bacon, De signis, 1978, 128). Bacon intends to solve\nthe resulting difficulties (which every causal theory of meaning based\non the concepts of \u2018reference setting\u2019 and \u2018reference\nborrowing\u2019 has to face) by distinguishing two modes of\nimposition. This can be seen as his most inventive contribution to\nsemantics.[33]\n Besides the \u2018formal\u2019 mode of\nimposition conducted by a \u2018perlocutionary\u2019 vocal expression\nlike \u201cI call this \u2026\u201d (modus imponendi sub forma\nimpositionis vocaliter expressa) there is another kind taking\nplace tacitly (sine forma imponendi vocaliter expressa)\nwhenever a term is applied (transumitur) to any object other\nthan the first name-giver has \u2018baptized\u2019 (Bacon, De\nsignis, 1978, 130). Whereas the formal mode of imposition refers\neither to the mythical situation of a first invention of language or to\nthe act of explicitly coining a new word, the second kind of imposition\ndescribes what actually happens during the everyday use of language.\nThis modification of the meaning of words is constantly taking place\nwithout the speaker or anyone else being actually aware of it. For just\nby using language we \u201call day long impose names without being\nconscious of when and how\u201d (nos tota die imponimus nomina et\nnon advertimus quando et quomodo) (Bacon, De signis,\n1978, 100, 130f.)\n\n\n3) Even if impositio in the described sense is of pivotal\nimportance for the constitution of linguistic meaning, the\nsignification of words is by no means limited to it: \u201ca vocal\nexpression signifies many things for which it is not imposed, as it\nsignifies all those things that bear an essential relation to the thing\nfor which the word is\n imposed.\u201d[34]\n In this way, Bacon\nclaims, words signify, as it were, infinitely many\n things.[35]\n",
