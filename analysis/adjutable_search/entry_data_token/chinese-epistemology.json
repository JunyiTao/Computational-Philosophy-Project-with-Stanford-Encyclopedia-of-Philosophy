The concepts and categories used in\nChinese philosophy cannot be easily transferred from one\nsocio-cultural context into another, and it is often difficult to\nunderstand this philosophy through the lens of traditional Western\nthought. The exclusive application of Western methods can thus lead to\nsevere misunderstandings and false interpretations of Chinese\ndiscourses. It is therefore important to use caution so as not to\ndiminish the richness and depth of Chinese thought or turn it into a\nweak version of Western philosophical thought.\n\nThe epistemological dimensions of Chinese texts and their role in the\ncontext of Chinese thought has been developed increasingly\nsuccessfully under the aegis of rediscovering and applying specific\ntraditional Chinese methodological approaches and categories (Lenk and\nPaul 1993). The present entry similarly explores Chinese epistemology\nthrough the lens of conceptual and ideational assets created and\ndeveloped in the Chinese tradition (Creller 2014: 196).\n\nAccording to the prevailing traditional European epistemologies,\nknowledge has mainly been gained through observation and reasoning.\nHowever, in traditional Chinese thought, knowledge has been understood\nin a much broader sense, namely as something which also (or primarily)\nstems from moral contents and which cannot be separated from (social)\npractice. The method which determined most of the epistemological\nteachings found in the Chinese classics was based on a holistic world\nview, and was directed towards a comprehension which could be achieved\nthrough education and learning. The basic contents of these teachings\nwere rooted in the premises of pragmatic and utilitarian ethics.\nChinese epistemology was relational (Ro\u0161ker 2012), meaning that\nit understood the external world to be ordered as a network of\nrelations, forming a dynamic structure. The human mind was also\nstructured in accordance with this cosmic all-embracing organic system\n(li \u7406). The relational cor\u00adre\u00adspon\u00addence and mutual compatibility\nbetween the cosmic and mental structures thus represents the basic\nprecondition of human perception and comprehension.\n\nThis entry will provide a systematic overview of the special features,\nthe central methods and the main developmental streams of classical\nChinese epistemological discourses that were based on a structurally\nordered holistic worldview and rooted in axiological premises.\n", "toc": [{"#BasCat": "1.

Basic Categories\n1.1 The Heart-Mind and the Things-Events\n\nIn classical Chinese philosophy the meaning of the Chinese word\nxin \u5fc3, which literally refers to the physical heart,\nis not limited to its common connotations. Unlike Western definitions,\nthe Chinese metaphorical understanding of this notion not only denotes\nthis organ as the center of emotions, but also as the center of\nperception, understanding, intuition and even rational thought. As\nancient Chinese believed that the heart was the center of human\ncognition, the notion of xin is most commonly translated as\n\u201cheart-mind\u201d in philosophical discourses. This\nunderstanding was determined by the absence of the contrast between\ncognitive (representative ideas, reasoning, beliefs) and affective\n(sensation, feelings, desires, emotions) states.\n\nIn classical Chinese epistemologies, each person\u2019s\nself-awareness was based upon a holistic understanding of the world,\nwhich was structured as an interactive relationship between human\nbeings and nature (tianren heyi\n\u5929\u4eba\u5408\u4e00). The unity of all cosmic beings was\nseen in terms of the organismic and dynamic wholeness of nature and\nsociety. Hence, self-awareness as the basis of any kind of\ncomprehension originated with the awareness that one\u2019s own being\nwas organically embedded and interwoven with (rational) indeterminate,\nconstitutive cosmic structures. The heart-mind which represents the\ncrucial part of this self-awareness, is innately equipped with the\nbasic structure of (moral) recognition.\n\nThe origins of this tradition reach far back into pre-Qin intellectual\nhistory. The human heart-mind was not only posited as the seat of the\nconcept of mind or consciousness and thus the source of both emotions\nand reasoning, but was also perceived as a kind of sense organ by the\nancient Chinese. Indeed, Mengzi (372\u2013289 BC) sometimes even\nviews it as the principal sense organ, responsible for selecting and\ninterpreting the sensations transmitted to it by other sense organs\n(Mengzi CTP: Gaozi shang, 15). In other words, while the\nlatter enabled perception, the heart-mind enabled the comprehension of\nexternal reality or that part of reality transmitted by the sense\norgans. In Guanzi, a philosophical work ascribed to the\nlegalist politician Guan Zhong (7th century BC, although\nprobably dating much later) the leading function of mind does not\nrefer merely to the sense organs, but also to all other major organs\nas for instance intestines or bladder (Guanzi CTP: Jiu shou,\n6). Later on, such an approach was typical of the legalist scholars,\nwho set the concepts of Confucian hierarchy upon absolutist\nfoundations. Such discourses also recall the relation between the\n(inferior) body and the (superior) spirit. However, in the early\nChinese philosophical texts hearing and seeing seem to be regarded as\nthe most important senses in that they play the most significant role\nin acquiring knowledge (Geaney 2002). In most ancient Chinese\nphilosophical discourses the body-mind relationship was seen as an\norganic unity, determined by the principle of complementarity. This\nled to the establishment of bodily recognition (tiren\n\u9ad4\u8a8d or tiyan \u9ad4\u9a57) that belongs to\nthe fundamental methods of perception (Ni 2002: 287) in traditional\nChinese epistemology.\n\nThus, with the exception of the Mohist school which elaborated some\ndivisions regarding the problem of things as they are\n(shi \u662f) and things as they appear\n(ran \u7136) (Mozi CTP: Xiao qu, 8), the\nheart-mind as the inherent organ of perception was seen as\ncontinuously integrated with the phenomena of the external world that\nmanifested themselves in the notion things-events (wu\n\u7269). Hence, instead of establishing a clear demarcation line\nbetween the subject and the object of comprehension, human perception\nand recognition of reality were mostly seen as a product of a\ncoherent, structurally ordered and complementary interaction between\nthe heart-mind and the things-events. This continuity of internal and\nexternal worlds prevailed in classical Chinese epistemology until the\n11th century, i.e., till the earliest beginnings of\nNeo-Confucian philosophy, when it was further developed.\n1.2 Names and Actualities, Language and Meaning\n\nThe harmonic regularity, which represents the elementary postulate for\nthe comprehension process, has been linked to questions of language\nand its relation to the world. The realization of such regularity has\ntherefore been preconditioned by language which was intended to\nprovide a formal framework for social understanding. The\nstandardization of language (and thus of cognitively reflected\nperception) had to be realized in accordance with the structural\nregularity of existence. According to most scholars, the elementary\ncategorization which defined the essential and formal assumptions of\nclassical Chinese epistemologies was therefore closely connected to\nissues concerning the regulation of the relationship between the\nstructure of language and reality. This categorization has been\nexpressed in the bipolar complementary relationship between names or\nconcepts (ming \u540d) and actualities (shi\n\u5be6).\n\nThe Confucian glorification of the perfect, harmonious and utopian\nsociety of the past was also reflected in the discourse on Proper\nNames (Lunyu CTP: Zi lu, 3), which envisioned a society\nin which everyone lived in accordance with the original meaning of\nthat which expressed their social position. According to this\napproach, words in ideal, past society incorporated the core of the\nrealities denoted by them, while the crisis of the Warring States\nperiod (475\u2013221 BC) emerged from the growing discrepancies\nbetween the names (social positions) of individuals and their actual\nbehavior. The ideal conditions for society could therefore only be\nestablished when everyone acted in accordance with their (social) name\n(Lunyu CTP: Yanyuan, 11).\n\nIn contrast to Confucius, Mo Di (ca 650\u2013200 BC), the founder of\nthe Mohist school, questioned the existence of an ideal language (the\nessence of the notion ming) to which (external) reality and\nsociety had to adapt. Instead of shaping social interactions according\nto language standards, which Confucians viewed as incorporating the\nessential structure of natural order and humaneness, the Mohists\nadopted the opposite approach, arguing that since language was a means\nfor transmitting realities, it was language which had to adjust to\nsuch realities and not vice-versa. According to Mo Di, the criteria\nfor such adjustment had to be based on actual social needs, and not on\nthe idealized and alien models of a bygone era.\n\nHowever, in both cases, the realization of a regulation that could\nprovide a framework for a social understanding needed to be\npreconditioned by the standardization of language, which is a possible\nfactor in the problem of the relation between actualities\n(shi) and proper naming (ming) became the basic\nepistemological question in ancient China. Naturally, the question as\nregards the normative criteria for such a relational structure arose\nat the very outset of this approach. The standardization or\ncontinuation (chang \u5e38) of language had to be carried\nout in accordance with the formal premises of a binary structured\n(shi \u662f : fei \u975e) valuation\n(bian \u8fa8). Only when these conditions were met, was it\npossible to achieve the ultimate goal of pragmatically oriented\nepistemology in classical Chinese discourses: every linguistic\nexpression, every name (ming) could (and should) therefore be\napplied in accordance to the principles that determined actuality\n(shi).\n\nThe adherents of the School of Names (ming jia\n\u540d\u5bb6) believed that, with respect to the concrete\nsituation to which language has been applied, each single thing could\nhave a single meaning. Gongsun Long (ca\u2009325\u2013250 BC)\nunderstood this in a way in which mutual coverings of meanings could\nonly exist on an abstract level. He attempted to eliminate semantic\noverlapping, or at least to reduce it to a level on which language\ncould still be overseen and controlled.\n\nHowever, according to the Neo-Mohist school the semantic overlapping\nof different terms was a natural quality of human language which meant\nthat the Neo-Mohist philosophers saw no need to eliminate it. They\nwere far more interested in the question of language as a means for\ncategorizing the natural and social worlds.\n\nSemantic approaches occupied a privileged position within these models\nof thought. These proto-epistemological discourses would have a\ndecisive impact on later developments in this specific area, most of\nwhich took place between 2nd and 6th centuries\nAD. This epistemological shift followed the debate on the nature of\nthe relation between names (or concepts) and realities (ming\nand shi), which was later essentially upgraded within\nthe so-called Neo-Daoist discourses on the relation between language\nand meaning (yan yi \u8a00\u610f), i.e., between\ncom\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsion and interpretation. However, these philosophers of the\nWei Jin era (265\u2013420) also began to investigate the structure of\nmeaning in a way that was no longer limited to the sphere of the\nconcrete, existing, objective, external actuality (Tang 1955: 68). The\nfocus of the scholars from this period was no longer limited to\nresponding to the questions concerning \u201cproper\u201d behavior,\ni.e., \u201cproper\u201d rituals, or formulating wise maxims that\ninspired people to a wiser, more ethical life, leading to a more\nharmonious society. Instead, they were interested in the question of\nexpressions and in investigating the relations between these maxims or\nsayings and the reality to which they referred. This meant determining\nwhich names were suitable for denoting certain things and which were\nnot and, conversely, which sort of realities could be designated by\ncertain names, and which could not. Based on these investigations,\nthey tried to establish a system, based on the semantic structure of\nnames (mingli lun \u540d\u7406\u8ad6, see Tang 1955:\n66) that divided specific concepts from one another, in order to be\nable to identify the errors and misapprehensions that resulted from\nthe improper use of names. In effect, these scholars discovered the\nepistemological dimension of meta-language, which was certainly a\nhigher level of thought than that of simple teachings that merely\nimplied direct and one-dimensional reasoning about things and the\nexternal reality. According to Tang Junyi (1955: 66), teachings\nformulated at this level were more abstract and belonged to higher\ncognitive levels. They were teachings about \u201chow teachings were\nmade\u201d. The principles derived from them were principles of\n\u201chow principles were established\u201d. This new dimension, in\nturn, would lead them to analyze the relation between human reasoning\nand their own cognitive concepts and, ultimately, these concepts as\nsuch.\n\nIn later, pre-modern critical approaches to philosophical thought, it\nwas exposed that even though names do not comprise the meanings of an\noriginal Heavenly essence, they should not be regarded as arbitrary;\nthe naming of reality has to be performed in accordance with the\nobjective and generally valid principles. The prime innovation in this\nregard was Dai Zhen\u2019s (1724\u20131777) emphasis on the concept\nof the \u201cexhaustive comprehension of concrete facts (actualities)\n(jinqi shi \u76e1\u5176\u5be6)\u201d per\u00adtain\u00ading to the\nreality we seek to comprehend (Xia 1996b: 417).\n1.3 Knowledge and Action\n\nIn traditional China knowledge and the way in which it is obtained\n(method of comprehension) was viewed as an important element of human\nexistence. The dispute as to which of the elements forming the binary\ncategorical pair of knowledge and action (zhi, xing)\nhad priority, constituted one of the crucial debates in traditional,\nas well as modern Chinese epistemology. In the context of the\nclassical holistic worldview that was inherently permeated with\nethical values, the recognition of reality was linked to the active\ninvolvement of humanity in their interactive relationship with their\nsocial and natural environment. Knowledge (zhi) was thus seen\nas a valuable factor, necessarily and inextricably linked to human\nactivities and the implementation of social practice (xing):\nany separation of knowledge and (social) practice was equated with the\nseparation of human beings from the world in which they have found\nthemselves. The close proximity between knowledge and action was seen\nas the close proximity between an individual and the world, because\naction was a means for his/her self-transformation and the\ntransformation of the world in the world. Hence, the unity or\nnon-unity of knowledge and action was always a measure of the unity or\nnon-unity of humanity and the world (Cheng 1989: 207).\n\nThe crucial aspect of the unity between knowledge and action (zhi\nxing heyi \u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00) has been emphasized\nand upgraded in the developing course of Neo-Confucian philosophy\nduring the Song and Ming dynasties by Wang Shouren (alias Wang\nYangming,1472\u20131529). This holistic thesis not only defined the\nentire ethical foundation of the epistemology of the School of\nHeart-Mind (Xin xue \u5fc3\u5b78) but is also typical of most\nsimilar philosophical precepts. (Wang 1933: Xu Ai yinyan, 5) \n\nIn the 17th century, the Academy of the Eastern Forest\n(Donglin shuyuan \u6771\u6797\u66f8\u9662) and the\nmaterialist philosopher Wang Fuzhi (1619\u20131692) advocated the\npriority of action (xing). Since this position was in\nopposition to the views of the orthodox Neo-Confucians, and since it\nrepresented a new, predominantly materialistic opposition to the\nNeo-Confucian tradition, it set the stage for the ideological\nstruggles which took place during the last Chinese dynasty. The\ncontribution of scholars from the School of Practical Learning\n(shixue \u5be6\u5b78) is especially valuable in the\ncontext of the further development of the binary category of knowledge\nand action. Due to their rediscovery of the orthodox classics and\ntheir unstinting emphasis on the significance of the practical\napplicability of ideas, they not only consistently placed the archaic\nconnection between knowledge and action at the center of\nepistemological thought, but also gave it a more concrete emphasis, as\nin the relationship between thought and (political) practice. This\nrediscovered and somehow remodeled traditional connection would\nsubsequently influence the great majority of later Chinese theories of\nknowledge, while also underpinning one of the crucial approaches to\nthe specifically Chinese understanding of Marxist philosophy. In his\nessay \u201cOn Praxis\u201d (Shijian lun), even Mao Zedong\nexplicitly argued for a similar epistemological and axiological\nprimacy of praxis over theory (2014: 8). It should be pointed out,\nhowever, that in their social theories, Chinese Marxists subscribed to\nthe idea of the inseparability and dialectical relation of both\ncategories, which in the context of Chinese ideational tradition had\nalways been viewed in terms of complementary bipolarity. Although they\nconsidered social praxis as the element which imparted meaning to any\n(theoretical) reasoning, it was precisely this kind of renewed\nsynthesis of knowledge and action which formed the epistemological\nbridge linking the classical Chinese tradition to the new ideas of\nWestern Modernity.\n2. Specific Features\n2.1 Relational Epistemology\n\nThe naturalistic epistemologies that prevailed in Western discourses\nwere dealing with the external world (or objective reality), which was\nto a great extent independent from the subject of comprehension.\nChinese approaches to knowledge can be called relational\nepistemologies, because they refer to relations. This applies not only\nto radical holistic epistemologies, which denied the notion of\nsubstance, but also to a number of contemporary theories which\nadvocate a strict division between the subject and object of\ncomprehension (see Xia 2000: 4)\n\nChinese relational epistemology was based upon viewing the world as a\ncomplex structure composed of relations, intersections and interacting\nfeedback loops. Specific Chinese models for investigating questions\nrelated to knowledge were thus premised upon a structurally ordered\nexternal reality; since natural (or cosmic) order is organic, it\nnaturally follows the \u201cflow\u201d of structural patterns and\noperates in accordance with structural principles that regulate every\nexistence and are manifested in the concept of li \u7406.\nIn this worldview, the human mind is also structured in accordance\nwith this all-embracing but open organic system. The axioms of our\nrecognition and thought are therefore not coincidental or arbitrary,\nbut follow this dynamic structure. In this view, the compatibility or\ncorrespondence of both the cosmic and mental structures is the basic\nprecondition that enables human beings to perceive and recognize\nexternal reality (Ro\u0161ker 2010: 79\u201382).\n\nIn most traditional discourses (with the exception of the Mohist\nschool, The School of Names and certain representatives of the\nNeo-Confucianism), the focus upon relations was linked to the unity of\nthe subject and object of comprehension. If we posit that the relation\nrepresents the object of comprehension, we must also specify that this\nobject is not automatically to be seen as a counter-pole to the\nsubject of comprehension. Relational epistemologies are not based upon\na strict division between these entities, nor upon a strict (or\nnecessary) demarcation of what, with respect to the subject of\ncomprehension, we are accustomed to see as the external or internal\nworld. Therefore, the methods used by certain philosophers in various\ncurrents of the Chinese tradition, are by no means decisive for\ndefining the positions of the subject and the object of comprehension,\nor the nature of their mutual relations. The methods for exploring\n(external) reality (gewu \u683c\u7269) and in\u00adtro\u00adspec\u00adtive\nrecognition (fanxing \u53cd\u7701) were both important as\nperceptive tools that primarily served to understand relations.\nHowever, these relations can be either continuous or discontinuous.\nThis means that the relation between A and B can be\nchanged into a relation between A and C. In Chinese\nepistemologies, such de-composition and changing of positions is in\nthe nature of comprehension (Zhang 2002: 78). In this context,\nknowledge (zhi) was primarily understood as recognition\n(shi \u8b58) of the structural principles (li) of\nthe all-embracing Way (dao), which, among all other entities\nof being, was also expressed in linguistic terms.\n\nThe relation as a basis or a central object and goal of any\nrecognition manifests itself on all levels of comprehension and\ntransmission of being. Hence, the relational aspect as a core of\ncomprehension was already apparent in the specific structure of\nChinese cosmology, which was based upon the holistic unity of humanity\nand nature (tian ren heyi). The complexity and integrity of\nrelations in nature and society therefore represent a basic aspect of\nChinese epistemology. This aspect was expressed in all classical\ndebates, which were based upon the elementary traditional\nepistemological categories of name (ming) and actualities\n(shi). Relations also formed the basic postulate of\ntraditional thought which defined the nature of the central\nepistemological relation between knowledge (zhi) and action\n(xing). Primarily due to the impact of the Buddhist thought,\nthe ancient holistic approach to perception and understanding reality\nthrough substance (ti \u9ad4) and functions (yong\n\u7528) was later replaced by the subject (neng \u80fd)\nand object (suo \u6240) of com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsion. This kind of\ncategorical demarcation that derived from the Indian tradition of\nthought would subsequently, in the 19th and especially the\n20th centuries, help Chinese philosophers gain a better\nunderstanding of theories of knowledge in western philosophy, which\nwere based on the ontology of dividing substance from phenomena.\n2.2 The Axiology of Comprehension\n\nWhile in the most influential European theories, knowledge has mainly\nbeen gained through reasoning, traditional Chinese thought understood\nthis question in a much broader sense, namely as something which also\n(or primarily) stems from moral contents. Chinese epistemology also\nincluded teachings of wisdom and dealt with questions such as\n\u201chow is metaphysics (or metaphysical wisdom) possible?\u201d\nand \u201chow can an ideal personality be cultivated?\u201d Hence,\nChinese epistemology focuses upon the internal relationship between\ngood and truth, between virtue and reason; it needs morality to\nacquire knowledge, and regards epistemology and axiology as\noverlapping (Xu and Huang 2008: 42). Thus, traditional Chinese, and\nespecially traditional Confucian epistemology, greatly emphasizes the\nconcept of moral cultivation. Confucius believed that all genuine\nknowledge and comprehension arises from humaneness (ren\n\u4ec1), and thus morality should be valued to gain knowledge (Lunyu\nCTP: Li Ren, 2, 7). Classical Chinese epistemological\nteachings of cultivation and theories of values both dealt with\ncriteria and methods that evaluate proper attitudes, ways of thinking\nand feelings (Xu and Huang 2008: 39).\n\nIn contrast with the view that the human mind is defined merely by its\ncognitive potential and could thus not be autonomous, Mengzi\nintroduced the concept of a moral Self which is incorporated in the\noriginal heart-mind (ben xin \u672c\u5fc3, Mengzi CTP:\nGaozi shang, 10) i.e., the heart-mind of goodness and morality.\nThis presumption has been seen as utmost important and hence, exposed\nby several modern and contemporary Confucians. In his interpretation,\nXu Fuguan (1902/03\u20131982) noted that the moral Self\u2014at\nleast in terms of its basic characteristics\u2014was already present\nin the early Zhou Dynasty (10th century BC). When this moral\nconsciousness is seated within a person, it will\u2014according to\nthis Modern Confucian interpreter (Xu 2005: 178)\u2014naturally begin\nto direct his/her life and guide his/her desires through something\ns/he calls \u201cmoral reason\u201d (daode lixing\n\u9053\u5fb7\u7406\u6027). In this context, Lee Ming-huei\nexposes the importance of the Confucian humaneness (ren\n\u4ec1), which he mostly analyses in the context of its embeddedness\ninto the Mencian theory of inherent morality (renyi neizai\n\u4ec1\u7fa9\u5167\u5728), which is comparable to Kant\u2019s\napriorism (e.g. Lee 2018: 37\u20138).\n\nThis spirit was focused on subjectivity; its bodily desires were\nincorporated into its moral responsibility and they thus manifested\nthemselves in rationality and autonomy (Xu 2005: 34). Modern\ninterpretations also emphasize that this Mencian line of thought has\nlater been developed further and elaborated upon within the scope of\nNeo-Confucian philosophy, especially Wang Yangming\u2019s concept of\ninnate moral knowledge (liang zhi \u826f\u77e5).\n\nHowever, due to the specific economic and political factors that\ndetermined traditional Chinese culture, the traditional Chinese\nconcept of moral Self could not provide (or, at least, formulate) the\npossibilities for gaining \u201cobjective\u201d knowledge (i.e.,\nknowledge not necessarily linked to morality) and exploring\n\u201cnatural\u201d phenomena. For Mou Zongsan (1909\u20131995),\nthis was the key ideological factor that explained why traditional\nChinese culture did not develop discourses of science and democracy.\nHe therefore argued that the traditional Confucian moral Self should\n(temporarily) negate itself (ziwo kanxian\n\u81ea\u6211\u574e\u9677), in order to make it possible for\nthese discourses to develop.\n\nA similar critique of classical Confucian moral epistemology\nwas\u2014although from a different perspective\u2014formulated\nalready by his teacher Xiong Shili (1885\u20131968). Based on his\ncentral thesis dealing with the inseparability of substance and\nfunction (Ro\u0161ker 2009a: 377), Xiong created an ethical system\nrooted in the classical Confucian paradigm of the nobleman\n(junzi \u541b\u5b50), defined as someone who possesses\nthe qualities of the \u201cinner sage\u201d and the \u201couter\nruler.\u201d The concept of the inner sage refers to spiritual\nadjustment, while the concept of the outer ruler has to do with that\nperson\u2019s social and political activities. While this moral\ndirective, which was expressed in the ancient phrase nei sheng wai\nwang \u5167\u8056\u5916\u738b, was based on classical\nConfucian political studies, Xiong criticized classical Confucianism,\nespecially the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties,\nprecisely in this regard, accusing them that their epistemologies\nexaggeratedly emphasized the principle of inwardness and ignored the\nsocial aspects of the binary category.\n2.3 Onto-Epistemology\n\nIn the Chinese holistic tradition epistemology is inseparable from\nontology, as in its view of the world every object of cognition is\nalso cognition itself; the manner of its existence is thus linked to\nour understanding of it. Because this connection goes both ways, i.e.,\ntheir relation is not a relation of single sided dependency and\ndetermination, but an interaction that includes mutual co-dependency,\nwe cannot state that this is a solipsistic conceptualization of the\nworld. The same as can be said for the perception of the existing\nworld can also be said for its comprehension and interpretation. This\ncannot be separated from the wholesome, but changeable and totally\nindividualized existence of objects of cognition; this is clearly\nmanifested in the theoretical system of the so-called\nonto-hermeneutics (benti quanshi xue\n\u672c\u9ad4\u8a6e\u91cb\u5b78), which was developed by\nChung-ying Cheng (Cheng Zhongying) (see Nelson 2011: 335; Cheng\n2008).\n\nIn the work of the representatives belonging to the realist currents\nof Neo-Confucian philosophy, as well as in the later developments\nwhich took place during the 16th, 17th and\n18th centuries, especially in the formation processes of\nnew methodologies and the processes of incorporating the Buddhist\nthought, this unity of reality and comprehension was modified through\na gradual constitution of a dualistic demarcation line manifesting\nitself in the differentiation between the subject\n(zhu\u4e3b, neng \u80fd) and the object\n(ke \u5ba2, suo \u6240) of recognition. This\ndemarcation line has been additionally strengthened by the subsequent\ninfluence of Western philosophy from the 19th century\nonwards. The search for a synthesis between the classical Chinese\nparadigm of the unity of existence and (its) perception on one side,\nand the dualistic view, according to which both realms are mutually\nseparated on the other, led to the modern debates on the priority of\nontology and epistemology. These debates culminated in several\nattempts to revive, modernize and re-establish the classical Chinese\nview of structural, organic and dynamic links between ontology and\nepistemology.\n3. Classical Approaches\n\nIn the pre-Han era, the most influential epistemological debates were\nconditioned by the question as regards the relations between language,\nthought and reality. Hence, according to Chad Hansen (1989:\n107\u2013120), the classical Chinese discussions on language offers\nnew insights and a distinctive perspective on the developments of the\ncentral discourses within this field.\n3.1 Language and Comprehension\n\nThese debates were determined by the conflict between classical\nConfucianism and orthodox Mohism, with the representatives of the\nformer advocating traditionalist positions, while the latter argued\nfor more utilitarian approaches (Hansen 1989: 108). In contrast to the\nclassical Confucian position which had been formulated in the\nDiscourse on proper names (see\n section 1.2)\n and follows the presumption that names imply the essence of\nrealities, this utilitarian position derived from their awareness of\nthe relativity of comprehension. Just as we can never know whether the\nthings we perceive are identical to reality, we can also never be\ncertain whether the meanings we express are actually understood in the\nsame way as they were intended (see Mozi CTP: Jing\nxia,110).\n\nThe reaction to these traditionalistic and utilitarian positions\nwithin ancient Chinese epistemology expressed itself in two different\nepistemological viewpoints that can both be designated as\n\u201cuniformist\u201d. The foundations of the first approach were\nestablished by the Confucian Xunzi (ca 230\u2013310 BC) while the\ncentral premises of the second were founded by his disciple and\nfounder of the Legalist school (Fa jia \u6cd5\u5bb6) Han\nFei (280\u2013233 BC).\n\nXunzi did not advocate the positions of pure traditionalism. And while\nhe saw his epistemology as an elaboration of the traditional Confucian\nteachings, it can in qualitative terms be considered as a new reaction\nto traditional approaches. In this respect, Xunzi can be placed among\nthe precursors of the new epistemology, which advocated universalistic\npositions. However, Xunzi\u2019s own teachings were based upon\nrelativistic approaches. Because language depended on social\nconventions, he knew how difficult it was to choose criteria for\nselecting names. However, despite these views, he sharply condemned\nthe Mohist reformism, arguing that the Confucian system of\nstandardization was still the best possible way to ensure a\nwell-regulated and harmonious society. Contrary to the Confucian\nAnalects, he did not believe in the primary mission of some\nideal language which incorporated the essence of existing realities,\nbut considered names and linguistic concepts as merely arbitrary means\nfor expressing concrete (objective) social realities. Despite this\nfundamental difference, for purely pragmatic reasons he continued to\nadvocate the Confucian Discourse on proper names, for he was\nconvinced that names (ming) also transmitted values, thus\nserving the social order, and therefore had to be adequately\nstandardized (Xunzi CTP: Zheng ming, 4). He also argued that\nthe classification and categorization of names were not necessarily as\ndifficult as it first appeared, for the human senses perceived\ndifferent realities in a structurally similar way; this\nphysiologically conditioned similarity therefore provided a basis for\nthe formation of common linguistic conventions (Xunzi CTP: Zheng\nming, 5). These standardized agreements made a functioning social\ncoordination\u2014including the connection between human acts and\nmoral postulates\u2014possible. Names therefore had to be regulated\nin such a way that they could serve the elite as a formal tool for\nrestoring and preserving their political power: It was precisely these\narguments which, in the works of his followers, would come to form the\nbasis for the legalistic epistemology that shaped the doctrine of one\nof the most totalitarian governments in Chinese history.\n\nXunzi\u2019s disciple Han Fei developed a philosophy that combined\nthe basic concepts of the traditionalistic and utilitarian approaches.\nHis epistemology, which was based upon the concepts of authority\n(wei \u5a01) and advantage (li \u5229),\nrepresented a unified system founded on the idea of political\nabsolutism (see Han CTP: Gui Shi, 1).\n3.2 Neglecting Linguistic Positivism\n\nThe second basic approach can be seen as derived from the negation of\nthe two positions we have just described, or their common features\nand, in fact, denied the positivistic functions of language. This\napproach also contained two different epistemological currents: the\nfirst was pre-linguistic and had its main representative in Laozi (ca\n6th century BC), while the second current, which found its\nmost famous exponent in the Confucian Mengzi, argued that language was\nnot necessarily innate (Mengzi CTP: Gongsun Chou\nshang, 2.8, also see Hansen 1989: 110\u2013111). Their moral\nepistemology was equally based solely upon introspection.\n\nHowever, while Laozi represented a current that could be defined as\npre-linguistic, and though the Daoist school differed from many of the\nbasic premises of Mengzi\u2019s teachings, Laozi\u2019s negation of\nlanguage closely resembles that of Mengzi. While Laozi suggests that\nthe natural behavior generated by our natural constitution requires\nthe abandonment of language, it is hardly coincidental that the\ndeclarative Confucian, Mengzi never mentions the Proper names\ndiscourse, which occupies such an important position in the\nAnalects. They both accept the action or behavior generated\nby the natural human constitution. Although they disagree on how rich\nand extensive these natural dispositions are, both scholars share the\ncommon belief that behavior should primarily be guided through their\nuse (Hansen 1989: 110\u2013111).\n\nWhile Laozi\u2019s dao cannot be contained or inscribed within any\nkind of linguistic structure, it still represents the basic cosmic and\nmoral force, creating and immanently governing everything that exists.\nHe viewed knowledge (in the sense of learning virtues) as a kind of\nsocial pressure which impeded our natural spontaneity (Laozi CTP: 18).\nIn Laozi\u2019s view, every linguistic concept is determined by time\nand space, and can therefore represent only a partial, incomplete\nexpression of reality, which he saw as integral, dynamic and\nholistically structured. Consequently, in order to preserve the\nnaturalness of our existence, we must withdraw from all conventions,\nincluding that of language itself. Laozi thus sought a radically\ndifferent process of comprehension: one of non-linguistic\nintrospection (Laozi CTP: 47).\n\nMengzi believed that the inborn qualities of human beings\n(xing \u6027) are naturally disposed towards the good. If\nindividuals are in touch with their true nature, their actions will\ninevitably tend towards the good (Allinson 1989: 17) without needing\nto rely on linguistic maxims. In this sense, he formulated the first\nanti-linguistic version of Confucian epistemology (Mengzi CTP: Wan\nzhang shang, 5; Jin xin shang, 1, 5, 15; Liang Hui wang shang, 6).\nWith this approach, he wanted both to refute one of the central tenets\nof Mohist theory, while also resolving (or avoiding) the central\nproblem of Confucian epistemology, i.e., the insertion of moral\nprinciples into behavior patterns through linguistic interpretations\n(Hansen 1989: 110).\n\nAccording to Chad Hansen (1989: 111), Mengzi did not view language as\nbeing an innate system which contained the essence of proper social\nnorms, and instead believed that all traditional Confucian conventions\nwere \u2018wired\u2019 into the human heart-mind (xin).\nHowever, this view has been challenged by other sinologists (e.g.,\nShun 1997; Van Norden 2000; Ivanhoe 2002), who have pointed out that\nonly the four \u2018sprouts\u2019 (si duan\n\u56db\u7aef) of essential moral qualities (Ivanhoe 2002: 43) were\ninnate to heart-mind, and that these had to be properly cultivated in\norder to enable human beings to comprehend the world and act in\naccordance with moral virtues (Lee 2018: 36\u20139). But given that proper\nnames (zheng ming) did not represent a system of (moral)\nrecognition for Mengzi, such cultivation was not based on a shared\nlinguistic system or consensus (Mengzi CTP: Jinxin shang,\n15). This position allowed him to formulate a series of well-grounded\narguments against the challenges presented by the Mohist school.\n3.3 Proto-analytic Approaches\n\nThe next position which decisively influenced the further development\nof epistemological debates derived from certain analytical approaches\nbased either upon isomorphic assumptions, as advocated by the\nrepresentatives of the School of Names (Ming jia), especially by\nGongsun Long, or upon linguistic relativism. The latter was elaborated\nby the followers of the so-called Neo-Mohist school (Houqi Mo\njia \u5f8c\u671f\u58a8\u5bb6) through a purely formal\nanalytical method. However, the approach to the linguistic analysis of\nthe two most important representatives of the School of Names, i.e.,\nGongsun Long and Hui Shi (ca 370\u2013310 BC), sustained\nfundamentally divergent views regarding the relationship between names\nand actualities, with Gongsun Long arguing that the ideal construct of\nan accomplished language was still of crucial importance, and that\nlanguage and social reality were inseparably linked and semantically\noverlapping (Xiang 2000: 52). His arguments were founded upon the\nConfucian premise that the ideal application of language was based\nupon a complete mutual congruency of the name and the object to which\nit referred (Gongsun Longzi CTP 2014: Bai ma lun, 4). Despite\nhis idealistic stance, he believed language was not only a consecrated\nstructure which embraced the essence of all existence, but that the\ncrucial function of language remained that of denominating actualities\n(Gongsun Longzi CTP 2014: Ming shi lun, 13). This is the\nhypothesis which underpins his main arguments on this topic, entitled\nThe Dispute on Names and Actualities (Ming shi\nlun).\n\nHui Shi instead believed names (ming) provided a basis for\ncategorizing reality (Xiang 2000: 51), a position which placed him in\ndirect opposition to Mohist approaches. His \u201cconstant\u201d\nrelativism was also a response to Neo-Mohist realism, which was\nfounded upon formal distinctions as a necessary precondition for\ncomprehension. As his 11th paradox (see Zhuangzi CTP:\nTianxia, 7) indicates, the Neo-Mohist \u201cobsession\u201d with\ndefinitions of particular terms (or names) was likewise redundant.\n\nIn any case, this analytic epistemological current of the ancient\nChinese tradition, which was rediscovered only in the latter half of\nthe 20th century, helped dispel a number of prejudices\nconcerning the methodological uniformity of classical Chinese thought\n(Allison 1989: 8). Certain similar \u201crealist\u201d currents\nwithin ancient Chinese discourses formulated additional\nepistemological questions related to binary oppositions of identity\nand difference (tong/yi \u540c/\u7570), or the\nconsistency and quality (jian/bai \u5805/\u767d) of the\nobjects of comprehension.\n\nGongsun Long\u2019s arguments were founded upon Confucius\u2019\npremise that the ideal application of language was based on a complete\nmutual congruency of the name and the object to which it referred.\nDespite his idealistic stance, he believed language was not only a\nconsecrated structure which embraced the essence of all existence, but\nthat the crucial function of language remained that of denominating\nactualities (Gongsun Longzi CTP: Bai ma lun, 4). This is the\nhypothesis which underpins his main arguments on this topic, entitled\nThe Dispute on Names and Actualities (Ming shi lun).\nWith respect to the concrete situation to which language has been\napplied, each single thing could have only one single meaning. Of\ncourse, this projection is in contrast with the usual application of\nlanguage, for people tend to use different names for the same objects.\nIn everyday language, the meanings of words usually overlap. Gongsun\nLong attempted to eliminate this semantic overlapping, or at least to\nreduce it to a level on which language could still be overseen and\ncontrolled. The famous \u2018White horse not horse\u2019 debate was\nan attempt to deal with these concerns.\n\nFor the Neo-Mohist philosophers, however, the semantic overlapping of\ndifferent terms was a natural quality of human language and,\nconsequently, they saw no need to eliminate it. They were far more\ninterested in the question of language as a means for categorizing\nsociety.\n\nHowever, given that the variegated complexity of language could not be\nmolded into a reliable regulatory structure within the linguistic\nconventions (Mozi CTP: Jing xia, 140), they acknowledged the\nde facto unreliability of language, concluding that a\ngeneral, valid standardization of language was impossible. In their\nview, the formal indefinableness of language was, to a degree, a part\nof its intrinsic structure (Mozi CTP: Jing xia, 168).\n\nInstead of the endless search for definitions of the semantic\nextensions of terms, the Neo-Mohists preferred to deal with questions\nthat addressed causal connections. However, their approach to these\nquestions differed greatly from that of formal logic in many respects.\nThey were disinterested in the attempts to construct an ideal\nlanguage, as expressed in the discourses on names; instead, they\nfocused on linguistic analyses, which led them to conclusions that\nwere diametrically opposed to Gongsun Long\u2019s ideas and the early\nConfucian views on the relation between names and actualities.\n\nMore specifically, their analyses led them to conclude that the\nconnections between certain individual names (ming), which\nwere simply understood as arbitrary entities of language, were\nmulti-layered and incoherent. While some compound terms could embrace\nsemantic scopes that extended beyond all the partial meanings of the\nindividual mings (i.e., the linguistic entities of which they\nwere compounded), in other instances the exact opposite was true (Mozi\nCTP: Jing xia, 102).\n\nHowever, the fragments of their analyses which have survived do not\ncontain any substantial discovery that goes beyond the recognition or\nacknowledgment of the inconsistent nature of linguistic structures.\nThus, in contrast to Gongsun Long, their investigations were not aimed\nat establishing a universal linguistic system that could unify\ndivergent models of language application. A fundamental premise of\ntheir work was that the formal shapes of naming could not embrace the\ncomplex integrity of existence, as reflected in actualities. Language\ncould never attain, let alone go beyond actual existence;\nconsequently, the objective features of reality automatically\ndetermined and limited the structures of language, and thus our\napplication of linguistic constructs and expressions (Mozi CTP: Da\nqu, 25).\n\nHowever, this did not mean that language was exclusively a product of\narbitrary social conventions. Despite its fundamental importance, the\nonly Neo-Mohist attempt to establish a formal linguistic basis for\nthis notion can be found in their analysis of the classical\ndistinction between identity and difference (tong yi, Mozi\nCTP: Da qu, 22).\n\nThe issue here is the problem of the essential relativity of this\ndistinction with respect to various contexts, for the difference\nbetween the two antipodes is by no means more constant than, for\nexample, the difference between the notions of largeness and\nsmallness, or length and shortness. From a realistic viewpoint, this\ncan appear as paradoxical, and this paradox was formulated and\nanalyzed by Hui Shi, a Nominalist philosopher who was the closest to\nDaoist discourses. By means of his apparently paradoxical\nsuppositions, Hui Shi attempted to situate the problem of identity and\ndifference within the context of holistic relativity. Through his\nexposition of contradictions, by which he showed the limits of the\nsemantic extensions of certain attributes, he wished to demonstrate\nthe relativity of time and space as expressed in the names\n(ming) applied in different contexts.\n\nOne of his most significant contributions to the classical\nepistemology of linguistic analysis can be found in his comment on the\ngeneral problem of identity and difference which, as we have seen, the\nrepresentatives of the Neo-Mohist school were unable to develop to a\nconcise conclusion (Hui Shi in Zhuangzi CTP: Tianxia, 7). He\nclaimed that any two things were always different in something, no\nmatter how equivalent they were in all other respects (otherwise they\ncould not represent two separate entities). Yet even two things that\nseemed to be completely different were likewise identical in at least\none quality, since they were both parts of a unified structure\n(otherwise, it would not be possible to express, or even think of them\nin the framework of language).\n\nHui Shi\u2019s \u201cconstant\u201d relativism was, of course, a\nresponse to the Neo-Mohist realism, which was founded upon formal\ndistinctions as a necessary precondition for comprehension. As his\n11th paradox indicates, the Neo-Mohist obsession with\ndefinitions was likewise redundant (Hui Shi in Zhuangzi CTP:\nTianxia, 7). His categorization of identity and difference,\nor of the radical relativity of objects, was thus based upon the\nimpossibility of conceptual definitions of reality, since every\nlinguistic comprehension was necessarily limited to a contextually\ndetermined meaning which was incapable of embracing all dimensions of\nthe object of comprehension.\n3.4 Egalitarian Epistemology\n\nAlthough the Neo-Mohists were never able to formulate an exhaustive\nresponse to Hui Shi\u2019s radical relativism, his contemporary\nZhuangzi (4th century BC) clearly found it to be an\nimportant stimulus for his own thought, and was definitely influenced\nby him when elaborating his own epistemological system. Zhuangzi\nbelieved that because knowledge was infinite, the human capacity for\ncomprehension was too limited to enable us to gain any true knowledge\n(Zhuangzi CTP: Yang sheng zhu, 1). Thus, he believed that\ncomprehension is always something relative (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu\nlun, 11). As a result, we are lost in a labyrinth of real and\nfalse recognitions. But this apparently tragic situation is mitigated\nby the fact that we do not have to face it alone, we are always\naccompanied by other people who are just as blind as we are. All of us\nare busy dealing with questions of mastering our reality and thus with\nquestions of the indefinite nature of our existence (Zhuangzi CTP:\nQiwu lun, 3). Since we are determined by the limitations of\nour senses, we naturally tend to acknowledge the truth of those kinds\nof recognitions that happen to match our own value systems (Zhuangzi\nCTP: Yu yan, 1). Ultimately, human subjectivity determines\nwhat should be regarded as (true and universally valid) knowledge. The\napparent objectivity and independence of the human mind has repeatedly\nbeen proven to be a false, illusory chimera, which only leads to\nself-deception. The quality, the features and the extent of our\nperception are always determined by the actual conditions of our\nexistence. Hence, our perception\u2014and the actions resulting from\nit\u2014are always dependent upon external factors, even though\nultimately, every form of dependence is actually a form of\nself-dependence. Of course, such dependence and determination\nare connected to our ignorance, to our incapacity to recognize our\nessence and the essence of our surroundings (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu\nlun, 13).\n\nZhuangzi believed that acknowledging the relative nature of all\nexistence was still not sufficient in order to define equivalents and\ndistinctions (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 10). In each concrete\ncase, the structure of our cognition enables us to identify at least\none common or different quality, which then allows us to make a\ndistinction, no matter how atypical it might be.\n\nThis position of radical relativism was common to both Hui Shi and\nZhuangzi. They also shared a skepticism concerning the idea that the\ncategorical mechanism of identity and difference (tong/yi)\ncould provide an adequate basis for a universal, permanently valid\n(chang) standardization of concepts or names\n(ming).\n\nFollowing the tradition of classical Daoism, Zhuangzi also believed in\nthe inherent inexpressibility of the holistic essence of all being.\nThis led him to espouse the classical Daoist method of comprehension,\ni.e., introspection (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 5). Although he\ndid not offer an instant solution to the eternal issues that form the\nheart of his philosophical discourse, he tried to create a new\napproach to the complex problem of human interactions. For him, the\ninternalization of language is a process inherent to human nature,\njust like eating, drinking and breathing, or anything else that\nconditions our survival (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 9).\n\nHowever, the uncertain connection between language and thought is not\na one-way street (Allinson 1989: 11) and, in fact, the communicative\npotential of language was trapped on the narrow footbridge between\nspeaker and hearer, between transmitter and receiver. Therefore,\nZhuangzi believed that language was inseparably connected to\ncomprehension; in essence, they share the same qualities (Zhaungzi\nCTP: Qiwu lun, 2). As a result, all linguistically determined\nboundaries within holistically structured reality are, in fact, false,\nsince language cannot express itself (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun,\n10).\n\nJust like dao in its original function of the fundamental,\nall-embracing essence of all beings, and just like our recognition of\nthis original path, language itself is also absolute in the sense of\nthe unity of all relative contradictions of which it is composed\n(Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 12).\n\nZhuangzi showed little interest in the problems that occupied the\nmajority of philosophers of his time, i.e., problems of connecting\ndifferent, individual minds into one comprehensible unity. He\nevidently believed that the problems of inter-subjectivity were not\nimposed upon us from outside; rather, he saw them as resulting from\nour being trapped in patterns of socially determined ambitions. We\ncould never master our destinies by forceful interventions into the\nintegrity of everything that exists, neither by artificial and false\ndistinctions nor by absolute valuations. The reason for this was that\nhuman existence was not subordinated to any external, higher powers\nthat could be controlled through comprehension (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu\nlun, 3).\n\nIn such an egalitarian epistemology, each type of understanding is\nequally possible. Zhuangzi\u2019s correlativity does not provide an\nabsolute perspective that could overrule the judgments or valuations\nof any method of comprehension.\n4. Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology\n4.1 General Overview\n\nEpistemology was the leading field of progress in Song-ming\nNeo-Confucianism (Wen 2011: 271). Its systematic discussion began\nafter the Buddhist philosophy reached its high point in China. The\nBuddhist distinction between the subjective perception (neng\n\u80fd) and the objects of comprehension within external reality\n(suo \u6240) influenced already the ear\u00adli\u00adest precursors of\nthis intellectual stream, such as for instance Shao Yong\n(1011\u20131077). However, in this context the most influential\nstream of thought was Chan-Buddhism (Chan \u79aa). In\ncontrast to other schools of Chinese Buddhism, for example the School\nof Pure Consciousness (Wei shi zong\n\u552f\u8b58\u5b97), the Tiantai (Tian tai zong\n\u5929\u53f0\u5b97 ) and the Huayan (Huayan zong\n\u83ef\u56b4\u5b97) schools, Chan discarded traditional Indian\nmethods of realizing the Buddha-nature and proposed a teaching of\nenlightenment in accordance with Chinese philosophical sensibility.\nIts adherents, especially its last patriarch Hui Neng (638\u2013713)\nexposed the possibility of enlightening humans without the use of\nwords. The central topic of interest within this context shifted from\ntrying to understand what the world was, to understanding the world\nand Buddha\u2019s wisdom. Since the latter issue falls within the\nscope of understanding a certain kind of knowledge, this discourse\nrepresented an innovative shift from metaphysics to epistemology.\n\nIn this shift of philosophical paradigms, Chan Buddhism infused the\nrelationship between heart-mind and things-events with a distinct\nsensibility that derived from classical Chinese discourses: the\ncontinuity of heart-mind and things-events (Wen 2011: 272). In this\nway, the Chan teachings synthesized earlier Buddhist and classical\nChinese epistemology, which provided a starting point for the\nNeo-Confucian epistemology.\n\nAccording to Wen Haiming (2011: 271), the general line of development\nin solipsistic epistemology could be drawn as follows: the\nepistemology of Chan Buddhism and Li Ao\u2019s (772\u2013841) study\nof \u201crecovering human nature\u201d (fu xing\n\u5fa9\u6027) provided the foundations for Neo-Confucian\nepis\u00adte\u00admol\u00ado\u00adgy; Zhou Dunyi\u2019s (1017\u20131073) concept of\ncreativity (cheng \u8aa0) and his epistemological\nstructure linking the Great Ultimate (taiji \u592a\u6975)\nwith the Great Ultimate of Humans (renji \u4eba\u6975),\nas well as Shao Yong\u2019s teaching of observing things\n(guan wu \u89c0\u7269) comprehensively raised the basic\nquestions of this new discourse; Zhang Zai\u2019s (1020\u20131077)\nparadigm of expanding one\u2019s heart-mind to be continuous with\nthings (da xin ti wu \u5927\u5fc3\u9ad4\u7269)\nand Cheng Hao\u2019s (1032\u20131085) elaborations on stilling\nthe nature (ding xin \u5b9a\u6027) served as the\nbasic frameworks and major discourses for Neo-Confucian epistemology;\nCheng Yi\u2019s \u7a0b\u9824 (1033\u20131107) study of\nHeavenly patterns (tian li \u5929\u7406) and Zhu\nXi\u2019s (1130\u20131200) Exploration of things\n(gewu) reached their first peak in this new epistemology of\nthe Song and Ming periods; after them, another peak was reached in Lu\nJiuyuan\u2019s (1139\u20131192) and Wang Yangming\u2019s agreement\nthat nothing is outside one\u2019s mind (wu xinwaizhi\nwu \u7121\u5fc3\u5916\u4e4b\u7269). The final stage of\nNeo-Confucian breakthroughs in the epistemology field can be found in\nWang Ji\u2019s (1498\u20131583) concept of intentional\npropensity (ji \u5e7e) and Liu Zongzhou\u2019s\n(1578\u20131645) teaching on intention as the root\n(yigen \u610f\u6839) of the heart-mind.\n4.2 Subjective and Objective Knowledge\n\nThis distinction which was most often expressed in later,\n17th century epistemology with the binary category of the\nsubject (neng) and the object (suo) of\ncomprehension, also definitely reveals the influence of Buddhist\nthought upon the entire Neo-Confucian philosophy. In Chinese Buddhist\nterminology, the term neng has namely also been used to\nexpress the ability to perceive phenomena; the compound neng\nbie \u80fd\u5225, for instance, was placed in opposition to\nthe term suobie \u6240\u5225, whereas the first one was\nunderstood as \u201cthat which differentiates\u201d and the latter\nas \u201cthat which is differentiated.\u201d The two terms together\n(nengsuo) refer to active and passive ideas; neng\nindicates the ability to transform and suo the object that\nwas transformed (Soothill and Hodous 2014: 337).\n\nHowever, the earliest Neo-Confucian philosophers, such as Shao Yong,\ndeveloped similar epistemological distinctions in order to\ndifferentiate between the subject (me, wo \u6211) and\nobject (thing, wu) of comprehension, gradually leading to a\ndirect definition of subjective and objective knowledge.\n\nIn his fictional dialogue between the woodcutter and his friend, the\nfisherman (Xingli da quan 1989: XIII, 3b, 932), Shao Yong elaborated\nthe traditional distinctions between identity and difference into the\nfundamental epistemological division between subjective and objective\ncomprehension. This development took place in a discourse on the\nnature of comprehension and the relation between ourselves and the\nthings we perceive.\n\nIn the philosophy of the main exponent of the Neo-Confucian system of\nthought, Zhu Xi, these categories were developed so as to become\ncrucial criteria for the proper method of comprehension (Zhu 1999: 14,\n53). Similar to Shao Yong, he also argued for an objective\nepistemological method and tried to avoid subjective projections upon\nthe object of comprehension (Zhu 1999: 11, 8). In this way, he tried\nto define the separation between the subject (zhu \u4e3b)\nand the object (ke \u5ba2) of com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsion (Zhu 1999:\n45).\n\nA few centuries later, Wang Fuzhi (1619\u20131692) elaborated these\ntwo basic categories from a realistic viewpoint, denied the classical\nconcepts of non-existence and emphasized the objective reality that\nexists independently of human perception. Following the Buddhist\nterminology, Wang denoted them as the comprehensive potential\n(neng) and its material basis (suo). In the context\nof Buddhist teachings, both the term suo, which referred to\nthe external reality and the object of comprehension, and the term\nneng, which referred to subjective perception and the subject\nof comprehension, were essentially empty (i.e., illusory), whereas\nWang includes them in his materially determined world of comprehension\nand defines their relation as analogous to the relation between\nfunction or applicability (yong) and (physical) substance or\nessence (ti), with the latter as the primary and determinant\nfactor (Wang 1982: V., 122).\n4.3 The Structural Principle as the Leading Principle of Comprehension\n\nFollowing the Chinese Middle Ages, the main Neo-Confucian ontological\nconcept of structural pattern or principle (li \u7406), as\nopposed to vital creativity (qi \u6c23), gradually evolved\ninto a new, crucial epistemological notion.\n\nIn the context of Neo-Confucian philosophy, things can generally be\nrecognized or understood through their basic structural principles.\nJust as dao in classical Daoist cosmogony represents the\nall-embracing fundamental law which manifests itself simultaneously\nwithin every single entity of being, the Neo-Confucian li\nexpresses itself on both, the level of cosmic unity, as well as on the\nlevel of its concrete manifestations. The nature of li is thus\nboth holistic and binary, transcendent and immanent. According to this\nnew aspect of being, knowledge can only be achieved by following these\nprinciples of the external world.\n\nAlthough dao as the elementary metaphysical force is abstract\nand therefore cannot be apprehended directly, it can, in Neo-Confucian\nthought be recognized through both intuition and reason. The\nepistemological role of the concept li becomes even more\nsalient, for li was developed not only as the structural\nprinciple that defines the concrete state of being of everything that\nexists, but also as the leading structural principle of human reason\n(see\n section 1.2).\n\nAfter distinguishing between subjective and objective knowledge, Shao\nYong warns against subjectivity, which is a consequence of our\ninability to recognize or understand structural principles underlying\nreality, making him one of the first philosophers to apply the term\nli in the Neo-Confucian sense. In this relatively new\ncontext, he often applied the term wu li \u7269\u7406\n(lit.: structural patterns or principles of things), which would, in\nmodern Chinese, serve as the translation of the Western word physics\n(in the sense of physical science). Given his approach, it comes as no\nsurprise to find him stressing the distinction between\n\u201ctrue\u201d recognition and false mysticisms. Zhu Xi also\nadvocated comprehension in accordance with the principle li\n(Zhu 1999: 8, 25). Like Shao Yong, he was convinced that li\nwas not only the structural principle that governs the existence\nof all external things, but also a necessary and inseparable part of\nthe human heart-mind (Zhu 1999: 60, 6, 7). However, in Zhu Xi\u2019s\nview the spiritual functions of li did not refer only to\nhuman reason, but also represented the human ability to perceive and\ncomprehend the external world (Zhu 1999: 47). Following the priority\nof moral principles within Confucian (and Neo-Confucian)\nepistemologies, as the central and universal principle, Zhu Xi\u2019s\nli also naturally incorporated ethical components (Zhu 1999:\n8, 20).\n4.4 Ultimate Knowledge and the Exploration of Things vs. Secluded Meditation\n\nThese new concepts led to a polarization of epistemology which also\nmanifested itself in the methods of comprehension. Neo-Confucian\nphilosophy presents two epistemological currents, which were named\n\u201crealistic\u201d and \u201cidealistic\u201d (or\n\u201cintuitionistic\u201d) by Western sinology. Both were based on\nthe different portions of The Book of Rituals (Li ji\n\u79ae\u8a18 ), which is part of the classic Confucian canon.\n\nThe epistemology of the \u201crealistic\u201d current followed the\nparadigms of the Great learning (Da xue\n\u5927\u5b78), which postulates the exploration of things\n(gewu) for the purpose of attaining ultimate knowledge\n(zhi zhi \u81f4\u77e5 ). These approaches were previously\nadvocated by Han Yu (768\u2013824), a precursor of Neo-Confucianism,\nand by most of the above mentioned Neo-Confucians such as Zhou Dunyi,\nCheng Yi and especially Zhu Xi (Zhu 1999: 14, 48). However, in Zhu\nXi\u2019s understanding the exploration of things (gewu) was\nnot limited to the process of investigation. In order to explore a\nthing one should exhaustively recognize all of its qualities (Zhu\n1999: 15, 3). For him, exploring things (gewu) and attaining\nultimate knowledge (zhizhi) form a unity (Zhu 1999: 15,\n17).\n\nThe \u201cidealistic\u201d or \u201cintuitive\u201d studies of\nknowledge of Neo-Confucian epistemology was derived primarily from the\nDoctrine of the Mean (Zhong yong \u4e2d\u5eb8)\nand sought to achieve recognition of reality based upon the practice\nof secluded meditation or concentration (shendu\n\u614e\u7368). The main Neo-Confucian exponents of this\nepistemological current were Li Ao and Cheng Hao. According to them,\nthe indeterminable cosmic force dao represented the only true\nbase of comprehension. The main goal of the introspection in the sense\nof secluded meditation was thus to understand dao (Cheng and\nCheng 1981: I, Yi Shu, 13, 221).\n4.5 Innate Knowledge\n\nDuring the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644) this epistemological split\nin Neo-Confucian philosophy manifested itself in the establishment of\ntwo divergent streams of thought, represented by the\n\u201crealist\u201d current of the School of the Structural\nPrinciple (Li xue \u7406\u5b78) on one side, and the\n\u201cidealist\u201d School of the Heart-Mind (Xin xue\n\u5fc3\u5b78) on the other. Wang Yangming, the most influential\nrepresentative of the latter, provided a crucial node in the\ninextricable link between Chinese epistemology and ethics, something\nthat is especially evident in the main concepts of his epistemological\nsystem: the ideas of heart-mind (xin), the unity of knowledge\nand action (zhi xing heyi) and innate knowledge\n(liangzhi). The latter notion represents an original, natural\ntruth in the sense of the basic recognition of the most profound\nstructure of existence. Innate knowledge is inborn and thus\nnecessarily implied in every person, forming an inseparable part of\nthe human heart-mind. In the same way as the heart-mind, of which it\nis a part, innate knowledge also contains the basic structure of\nnatural principles (li) (Wang 1933: II, 57). This basic\nepistemological concept also forms the foundation of Wang\u2019s\nethic in the sense of moral recognition, or the distinction between\ngood and evil (Wang 1933: III, 26). Thus, innate knowledge represents\nthe basic criterion for the recognition and evaluation of individual\ncomprehension, as well as social interactions. Since Neo-Confucian\nideology is based on the Mencian interpretation of ancient\nConfucianism, this unity of innate knowledge and moral goodness is\nquite unsurprising. Therefore, Wang pointed out that Mengzi, in\ncontrast to Xunzi, stressed the goodness of human nature. However,\ninnate knowledge is not merely a passive substance of ethical\ncomprehension. Through the process of \u201csuccessful\u201d\nintrospection, it also automatically leads to \u201cproper\u201d\n(and, thus, morally good) action, and can therefore provide a\ncriterion for our behavior. Here, Wang, obviously influenced by Chan\nBuddhism, tried to expand upon Mengzi\u2019s teachings, stressing\nthat the notions of good and evil are not absolute concepts, since all\nthat exists is regulated in accordance with the all-embracing and\nall-encompassing structure of the natural order of cosmic reason, and\nthus with the system of the structural, absolutely valid principles of\nnature (li) (Wang 1929: II, 29a).\n\nAccording to Wang Yangming, good and evil cannot be separated from\nhuman \u201cintention\u201d (yinian \u610f\u5ff5).\nHence, human action can only be evaluated in the context of specific\nconcrete situations. The impulse which tells us what is right\n(shi) or wrong (fei) in a particular situation is,\nonce again, the concept of innate knowledge (liangzhi). As we\nhave seen, the binary category of knowledge and action and the\nquestion of the relation between these two concepts represented one of\nthe fundamental problems of Chinese epistemology. Hence, \u201cinnate\nknowledge\u201d, the inborn capacity in which the boundary between\nknowledge and action apparently disappeared, was of utmost\nimportance.\n5. Later Conceptual Developments and Modern Chinese Epistemology\n5.1 Pre-modern Methodologies\n\nAt the threshold of the 18th century, Chinese\nepistemologists sought to establish a new analytical and critical\nmethodology for \u201cexploring things (gewu).\u201d\nSimilar tendencies could be observed already in Wang Fuzhi\u2019s and\nGu Yanwu\u2019s (1613\u20131682) notion of evidence\n(kaozheng \u8003\u8b49). Gradually, they acquired greater\nimportance within the framework of new practice-oriented\napproaches.\n\nWang and Gu profoundly influenced the epistemology of the School of\nPractical Learning (Xi zhai) which consisted of two main\ncurrents; the most important representatives of the first, Yan Yuan\n(1635\u20131704) and Li Gong (1659\u20131746), followed the\nessential approaches of Huang Zongxi (1610\u20131695) and Wang Fuzhi,\nwhile the chief proponent of the second, the philosopher Dai Zhen,\nfounded his epistemological system upon Gu Yanwu\u2019s methodology.\nTheir emphasis on the practical, physical aspects of knowledge and the\nsignificance of sensations led them to rehabilitate human feelings,\ninclinations and desires as a driving force that motivated human\nbeings to seek knowledge. By so doing, they unknowingly prepared the\nterrain for the later Chinese understanding of the European notion of\nthe individual as the subject of comprehension.\n\nDai Zhen is widely considered to be the first Chinese philosopher to\nhave described the relation between the subject and object of\ncomprehension by defining the subject\u2019s potential for\ncomprehension as a tool, which can be compared to light that makes\nobjects visible. Xia Zhentao (1996b: 405) especially indicates his\nelaboration of the notions of the potential for comprehension (xin\nzhi shenming \u5fc3\u4e4b\u795e\u660e), elucidation,\nexposure and illumination (zhao \u7167). Xia stresses that\nDai\u2019s reflective method, by which reality is perceived through\nits reflection (fanying \u53cd\u6620) in the human mind,\npertains to basic theories of materialistic epistemology, given that\nthe objective reality (which is external to the subject of\ncomprehension) is seen as a necessary precondition of reflection (Xia\n1996b: 405).\n\nAt this point we should mention China\u2019s first encounter with\nWestern thought, which slowly began to seep into the Middle Kingdom at\nthat time. During the 18th century, the Jesuit influence on\nthe Chinese academic world grew steadily.\n\nHence, Tan Sitong (1865\u20131898) believed that the central\nConfucian virtue of humaneness (ren) is not merely an\nethical, but also an epistemological term that determines the social\nfunction of the basic stuff of which everything is composed, namely of\nether, which makes it possible for people to experience circulation\n(tong \u901a), i.e., one of the principal components in the\nprocess of comprehension. In accordance with this mechanistic\nunderstanding of concrete reality, circulation provides both the inner\nand external conditions of perceiving, comprehending and transmitting\nreality. In terms of inwardness, circulation makes the harmonic,\ncoordinated operation of the senses (wu guan\n\u4e94\u5b98), brain (nao \u8166) and nervous system\n(nao qi jin \u8166\u6c23\u7b4b) possible. Tan Sitong\nwas one of the first Chinese scholars who accepted the Western notion\nthat mind and consciousness arise from the brain and not from the\nheart (xin), as was widely believed in traditional China.\n5.2 Syntheses of Methods and Disciplines\n\nThe majority of 20th century Chinese epistemologists\nadvocated the conceptual divisions between the subjectivity and\nobjectivity of comprehension. While analytical and/or Marxist scholars\n(such as Jin Yuelin) gave absolute priority to the rational method,\nmost Modern Confucians (principally Xiong Shili and Mou Zongsan)\napplied the intuitive one. He Lin drew attention to the traditional\ncomplementary comprehension of reason and intuition (He 1982: 27). In\nthis context, the two methods are not only inseparably connected to\neach other, but are also connected to the method of reasoning itself,\nwhich is based upon distinctions. In his view, philosophers who apply\nthe method of intuition, simultaneously apply methods of formal logic\nand dual differentiations; others, who apply the rational method, also\nuse the intuitive method, as well as dual distinctions. All three\nmethods, the formal analysis and inferences, as well as methods of\ndual distinctions and intuition, are necessary compounds for any\nphilosophical activity (Zhang 2000: 75).\n\nThe epistemological discourses of the 20th century current\nof the so-called Modern or New Confucianism (Xin ruxue\n\u65b0\u5112\u5b78) were rooted in the specific features of\ntraditional Chinese epistemological thought and defined by a search\nfor fruitful amalgamation with contemporary Western theories of\nknowledge. In this field, they were most interested in the relation\nbetween reason and intuition, for the latter concept belongs to\nprinciple traditional epistemological notions, and the former to the\nconcepts that are crucial for the establishment of modernization\ntheories. The Western notion of intuition came to China in close\nconnection and with many connotations arising from Henri\nBergson\u2019s vitalism, was translated by the neologism\nzhijue \u76f4\u89ba. \n\nAn important notion in Modern Confucian epistemologies is the advanced\nconcept of the traditional moral self, which in the new global\nphilosophies was intended to assume the function of a\n\u201ctruly\u201d autonomous cognitive subject. While this subject\nacts and perceives the world as an individual, necessarily forming a\npart of the social community, it is also ennobled by an infinite\nheart-mind, which enables it to be aware of its unity with the\nuniverse. This new, moral and infinite, limitless subject represents\nan elaboration of the \u201ctraditional\u201d Confucian concept of\nthe moral self, and thus may also be the active personality that can\nsustain the idea of modernization. In the Confucian framework, this\nself is autonomous precisely due to its rational and structural (li\n\u7406) connection with all aspects of its natural and social\nenvironment. Further, because this connection is also dynamic and\norganic, it is capable of infinite forms of communication and\ncooperation. For a Chinese model of modernity, i.e. for a modernity\npermeated with humanism or mutuality (ren \u4ec1), these\nforms of communication and cooperation are much more important than\nformal laws of economy and official politics.\n\nModern Confucian epistemological notions, e.g. Mou Zongsan\u2019s\nintellectual intuition, Tang Junyi\u2019s (1909\u20131978) concept\nof sensual compatibility, Xiong Shili\u2019s and Liang\nShuming\u2019s (1893\u20131988) sinization of reason and intuition,\nall represent the various Modern Confucian responses to the global\nquestions of the contemporary epistemology. These questions are linked\nto the dilemmas of the modern subject, who is trapped within the\ncomplex technologies of the profit-seeking world and has thus\nforgotten the ethical dimensions that define their humanity.\n\nWithin the framework of his structurally ordered system of thought,\nZhang Dongsun decidedly rejected the Modern Confucian paradigm\nexpressed in the glorification of intuition as the most objective\nmystical method for innate knowledge. Zhang believed that reason was\nthe only reliable and unequivocal method of comprehension; because it\nled us to knowledge that was not only logically consistent but also\napplicable, there was no need to search for any other, more reliable\nmethod. However, the rational method was not one-dimensional and\nundiversified, for it not only functioned in accordance to the pure\nformal structure, but also with the aid of the so-called intuitive\ninsight (touzhi \u900f\u667a), which represented an\ninseparable and complementary part of intuitive methods. Thus, by\nproceeding from ratio centrism, Zhang Dongsun finally managed to\novercome the boundary between reason and intuition (Zhang 1924: 76).\nHowever, according to him, the thing we are directly confronted with,\nis neither reason nor intuition, but knowledge itself. Knowledge is a\nresult of reason, but it implies intuition on an unconscious level.\nIntuition is not mysterious. It merely represents a process of\napplying a philosophical \u201cmethod of\ncounter-investigation\u201d, by which we peel away from the image of\nknowledge the ultimate, most intimate thing. And this thing is the\npure, completely unregulated \u201cthat.\u201d (Zhang 1924:\n64\u201365)\n\nThe Taiwanese Modern Confucian philosopher Mou Zongsan tried to define\nthe position of reason within traditional Chinese thought by comparing\nWestern and Chinese culture, arguing that they were based on different\nrepresentational forms of human reason. He called the Chinese form\n\u201cfunctional or intensive\u201d (lixingzhi yunyong\nbiaoxian\n\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u904b\u7528\u8868\u73fe) and the\nWestern \u201cconstructive or extensive\u201d (lixingzhijiagou\nbiaoxian\n\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u67b6\u69cb\u8868\u73fe) (Mou 1995:\n544\u2013553). This distinction could be compared to the Kantian\ndifferentiation between practical and theoretical reason. The\n\u201creason\u201d which appears in the functional representation is\na practical one. It is not abstract, but concrete, connected to actual\nlife. This reason can thus be equated with morality within the\npersonality (Mou 1995: 544\u2013545). However, Mou endows functional\nreason with intellectual intuition (zhide zhijue\n\u667a\u7684\u76f4\u89ba) which is\u2014in contrast to\nKant\u2019s epistemology\u2014a potential implied not only in Divine\nconsciousness, but also in the human heart-mind.\n\nIn his treatise on Kant\u2019s philosophy, Jin Yuelin established a\nclear and insuperable demarcation between synthetic and analytical\npropositions: if a certain proposition is synthetic, it cannot be at\nthe same time necessary or a priori; and if it is necessary\nor a priori, it cannot be synthetic (Jin 1996: 46). This\ndifference is clearly of great importance for the elementary framework\nof Jin\u2019s theory of knowledge. Modern Confucian epistemology\ncriticized a similar division, since ethics and their pragmatic social\nimplications were still at the heart of their theoretical efforts.\nFeng Youlan also encountered many difficulties related to analytic and\nuniversal (synthetic) propositions: on one hand, he did not wish to\nabandon the universality of the metaphysical statements, because in\nthis way he could express the ideal of every single thing, but, on the\nother hand, he tried to respond to the attacks against synthetic\npropositions carried out by the Viennese circle (Jin 1996: 78).\n\nZhang Dongsun maintained that a pure form of either proposition did\nnot exist in reality. The absence of distinctions between analytic and\nsynthetic propositions implies the abolition of the demarcation\nbetween (posterior) experience and (a priori) knowledge and,\nconsequently, between metaphysics and the (natural) sciences. Most\nChinese scholars from the latter half of the 20th century\nargued that the reason for this demarcation was to be found in the\nfact that metaphysics only referred to the formal regulation of\nexperiences, while science also explained their contents (Feng 1986:\n166\u2013167). However, some recent Chinese epistemological theories\nlikewise reject the reasoning behind such demarcations and criticize\nthe existence or methods of the discourses based upon them. For them,\nboth science and metaphysics explain experience; in addition, both\nrepresent a formal kind of explanation. Hence, Zhang Dongsun\ntranscended the boundary between science and metaphysics, while Feng\nwas convinced that it was insuperable. In Zhang Dongsun\u2019s view,\nthe only difference between metaphysics and science lay in the fact\nthat science applied the postulate of relations, while metaphysics\napplied the postulates of being and existence (Zhang 2002: 77).\n\nThis all-embracing, specifically Chinese tendency towards transcending\nabstract demarcations ultimately also manifested itself on the level\nof heuristics, with respect to the question of the nature of creating\ntheories. In the context of the neo-holistic research, which was, in\nthe field of epistemology, founded by Zhang Dongsun, and further\nelaborated primarily by Zhang Yaonan, the demarcation between the\nconcepts of discovery (faxian \u767c\u73fe) and invention\n(faming \u767c\u660e) was also considered to be\nartificial. This assumption was developed as a negation of Jin\nYuelin\u2019s paradigm which stated that theories could not be\ncreated (or \u201cinvented\u201d), but only discovered. Zhang\nDongsun denied this affirmation, declaring that there was no\nqualitative difference between these two concepts (or methods), given\nthat science was not a reflection, but an explanation or\ninterpretation of the world. He argued that scientific discourses were\na method of selection, that is, they selected and isolated specific\nentities in (originally chaotic) reality or nature, defining them as\nfacts, even though they only represented a kind of abstract reality.\nBy \u201cdiscovering\u201d facts in this way, science simultaneously\ncreated them. Thus, the existence of facts co-existed with the results\nof science. Although facts as such were not separated from nature,\nthey could not be a part of \u201cpure\u201d nature either, for in\nZhang\u2019s view, pure forms that would be separated from our\nawareness, perception and apprehension, did not exist. However, since\nZhang Dongsun cannot be considered a solipsist, for whom mind or\nconsciousness is the sole \u201ccreator\u201d of reality, there had\nto be something apart from humans (or living beings), despite the\nnon-existence of substance. Of course, this \u201csomething\u201d\nwas an (at least potentially) all-connecting and all-embracing\nstructure, which was neither material nor ideal in its essence. In\nfact, this structure represented a concretization of manifold\nrelations. It was precisely here that contemporary Chinese theories of\nknowledge once again revealed their traditional connotation.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"ChiTexPro\">Chinese Text Project</a>", "<a id=\"WorCit\">Works Cited</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"ChiTexPro\">Chinese Text Project</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Gongsun Lonzi, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/gongsunlongzi\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/gongsunlongzi</a>&gt;.", "Guanzi, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/guanzi\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/guanzi</a>&gt;.", "Han Fei, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/hanfeizi\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/hanfeizi</a>&gt;", "Laozi, \u201cDaode jing\u201d, <em> Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing</a>&gt;.", "Lunyu, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/analects\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/analects</a>&gt;.", "Mengzi, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/mengzi\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/mengzi</a>&gt;.", "Mozi, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>, URL =\n &lt;<a href=\"http://ctext.org/mozi\" target=\"other\">http://ctext.org/mozi</a>&gt;.", "Xunzi, <em>Pre-Qin and Han</em>.
