    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || The Case for \u00acCH\n5.1 The Case for \u00acCH\nRecall that there are two basic steps in the case presented in\nSection 3.3. The first step involves \u03a9-completeness (and this\ngives \u00acCH) and the second step involves maximality (and this gives\nthe stronger 2\u21350 = \u21352). For\nease of comparison we shall repeat these features here: \n The first step is based on the following result: \n\nTheorem 5.1\n(Woodin). Assume that there is a proper class of\nWoodin cardinals and that the Strong\n\u03a9 Conjecture holds. \n\n There is an axiom A such\nthat  ZFC + A is\n\u03a9-satisfiable and \nZFC + A is\n\u03a9-complete for the structure\nH(\u03c92). \n\n\nAny such\naxiom A has the feature that ZFC +\nA \u22a7 \u03a9\u201cH(\u03c92) \u22a7 \u00acCH\u201d.\n\n\nLet us rephrase this as follows: For each A satisfying (1),\nlet \nTA = {\u03c6 | ZFC +\nA \u22a7\u03a9 \u201cH(\u03c92) \u22a7 \u00ac\u03c6\u201d}.\n The theorem says that if there is a proper class of Woodin\ncardinals and the Strong \u03a9 Conjecture holds, then there are\n(non-trivial) \u03a9-complete theories TA of\nH(\u03c92) and all such theories contain \u00acCH. In other\nwords, under these assumptions, there is a \u201cgood\u201d theory\nand all \u201cgood\u201d theories imply \u00acCH. \n The second step begins with the question of whether there is\ngreater agreement among the \u03a9-complete\ntheories TA. Ideally, there would be just\none. However, this is not the case. \n\nTheorem 5.2 (Koellner and\nWoodin 1999). Assume that there is a proper class of\nWoodin cardinals. Suppose that A is an axiom\nsuch that \n\n\n\u00a0i.\u00a0 ZFC +\nA is \u03a9-satisfiable and\n\nii.\u00a0 ZFC + A is\n\u03a9-complete for the structure\nH(\u03c92).\n\nThen there is an axiom B such that \n\n\u00a0i\u2032.\u00a0 ZFC + B is \u03a9-satisfiable and\n\nii\u2032.\u00a0 ZFC + B is \u03a9-complete for the structure\nH(\u03c92)\n\n\nand TA\u2260TB. \n\n This raises the issue as to how one is to select from among these\ntheories? It turns out that there is a maximal theory among\nthe TA and this is given by the axiom\n(\u2217). \n\nTheorem 5.3\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then the following\nare equivalent: \n\n (\u2217). \nFor each\n\u03a02-sentence \u03c6 in the language for the\nstructure \u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS,\nA | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9\n if \nZFC + \u201c\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9 \u22a7 \u03c6\u201d\n is \u03a9-consistent, then \n\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9 \u22a7 \u03c6.\n\n\n\n So, of the various theories TA involved\nin Theorem 5.1, there is one that stands out: The\ntheory T(\u2217) given by (\u2217). This theory\nmaximizes the \u03a02-theory of the structure \u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS,\nA | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9. The fundamental result is that in\nthis maximal theory \n2\u21350 =\n\u21352.\n",
