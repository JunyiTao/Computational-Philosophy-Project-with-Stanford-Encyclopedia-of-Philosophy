    "main_text": "Game semantics || Special kinds of strategies\n3.4 Special kinds of strategies\n\nThe game formalism just introduced is not detailed enough to\ncharacterize the kind of sequential computation at higher types needed\nto achieve definability. For this purpose, a richer structure on games\nis needed, making them closer to dialogue games between\nProponent and Opponent exchanging questions and\nanswers. This allows to formulate restrictions on plays by\nmatching answers with the corresponding questions in an appropriate\nmanner. The strategies for this refined game notion, that we study\nnext essentially through examples, will yield a richer notion of\nmorphism between games, allowing to make finer distinctions of a\ncomputational nature needed for intensionally fully abstract model of\nPCF, following essentially the approach of Hyland & Ong (2000)\ndrawing also material from Abramsky & McCusker (1999) and Curien\n(2006).\n\nThe moves of the refined game notion will be either questions\nor answers played by Proponent or by the Opponent. We have\nthen four classes of moves each represented by a kind of (round or\nsquare) bracket: Proponent\u2019s questions \u2018(\u2019;\nOpponent\u2019s answers \u2018)\u2019; Opponent\u2019s questions\n\u2018[\u2019; and Proponent\u2019s answer \u2018]\u2019. This\nlabeling of the moves subsumes under the usual well-formedness\ncriterion for bracket sequences, at one time: the alternation between\nProponent and Opponent, the fact that Opponent is the first to move\nand that each answer of a player answers a unique question of the\npartner. This is not enough, however: a further justification\nstructure on questions and answers is needed to discipline the nesting\nof (sub)dialogues in the evaluation of higher-order functions,\nallowing to characterize the well-bracketed strategies.\nConsider now the strategy in \\((G^{11}_\\texttt{bool}\\to\nG^{12}_\\texttt{bool}\\to G^1_\\texttt{bool}) \\to G_\\texttt{bool}\\),\ndescribed informally using a labeling of the copies of\n\\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\) as shown:\n\n(1)Opponent asks\nquestion \\(?\\) in \\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\);\n(2)Proponent asks\nquestion \\(?_1\\) in \\(G^1_\\texttt{bool}\\), justified by \\(?\\), in\norder to know about the output of the input value \\(f\\);\n  (3.1)\nif Opponent asks\nquestion \\(?_{11}\\), Proponent answers \\({\\textit{tt}}\\) in\n\\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\): the computation examines first the first argument\nof \\(f\\);\n  (3.2)\nif Opponent asks\nquestion \\(?_{12}\\), Proponent answers \\({\\textit{ff}}\\) in\n\\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\): the computation examines first the second\nargument of \\(f\\);\n\n\nHere, the Proponent\u2019s moves at steps (3.\\(i\\)) answer the\nquestion asked by Opponent at step (1), not the questions asked by the\nOpponent at steps (3.1), (3.2) that are still pending. This violates a\n\u201cno dangling question mark\u201d condition on dialogues\nintroduced under this name by Robin Gandy in his unpublished work on\nhigher-type computability (and well-known in the tradition of game\nsemantics for intuitionistic logic initiated by Lorenzen (1961)).\nStrategies such as these interpret control operators that do not exist\nin the fully abstract game model of PCF, but do exist, for example, in\nthe model based on sequential algorithms (Curien 1986: sec. 3.2.7,\n3.2.8). A different phenomenon occurs in a variation of the previous\nexample:\n\n(1)Opponent asks\nquestion \\(?\\) in \\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\);\n(2)Proponent asks\nquestion \\(?_1\\) in \\(G^1_\\texttt{bool}\\);\n\u00a0\u00a0(3.1)\u00a0\u00a0if\nOpponent asks question \\(?_{11}\\),\nProponent answers \\({\\textit{tt}}\\) in\n\\(G^{11}_\\texttt{bool}\\);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3.1.1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\nOpponent answers \\({\\textit{tt}}\\) in\n\\(G^1_\\texttt{bool}\\), Proponent answers \\({\\textit{tt}}\\) in\n\\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\); \n\u00a0\u00a0(3.2)\u00a0\u00a0if\nOpponent answers \\({\\textit{tt}}\\) in\n\\(G^1_\\texttt{bool}\\), Proponent answers \\({\\textit{ff}}\\) in\n\\(G_\\texttt{bool}\\)\n\n\nHere the strategy prescribes a response to the moves by Opponent\ndepending on the internal detail of the latter\u2019s behavior. The\nresponse prescribed to Proponent by the strategy to the initial\nquestion should not depend on what happens between the\nProponent\u2019s question \\(?_1\\) and the Opponent\u2019s answer\n\\({\\textit{tt}}\\). This is the property of innocence, that\nlimits the amount of detail that a strategy for \\(P\\) can access. For\nthis reason, failure of innocence allows strategies to model storage\nphenomena.\n\nThis gives us the necessary terminology to understand the statement of\nthe intensional full abstraction theorem proved in Hyland & Ong\n2000 (th.\u00a07.1), where the types of PCF are interpreted as games\nand terms as innocent and well-bracketed strategies, see also Abramsky\net al. 2000 (th.\u00a03.2), Curien 2006 (th.\u00a05.1):\n\n\nTheorem 3.1. For every PCF type \\(\\sigma = \\sigma_1\n\\to \\cdots \\to \\sigma_n \\to \\kappa\\) with \\(\\kappa = \\texttt{num}\\) or\n\\(\\kappa = \\texttt{bool}\\), every (compact) innocent and\nwell-bracketed strategy corresponds to the denotation of a closed\nterm.\n\n\nThis closes our quick overview of game semantics applied to the full\nabstraction problem for PCF, but opens a broad research area in the\nclassification of programming disciplines according to the possible\ncombinations of restrictions (innocence, well-bracketing) on general\nstrategies for games as defined above. An introductory picture (the\n\u201csemantic square\u201d by Abramsky and his students) of this\nlandscape, that we leave to the contemplation of the reader, can be\nfound in Abramsky & McCusker 1999.\n",
