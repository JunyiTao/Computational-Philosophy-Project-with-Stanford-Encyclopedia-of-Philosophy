    "main_text": "Quantum Mechanics to the Rescue?\n10. Conclusions\n\nWhat remains of the grandfather paradox in general relativistic time\ntravel worlds is the fact that in some cases the states on edgeless\nspacelike surfaces are \u201coverconstrained\u201d, so that one has\nless than the usual freedom in specifying conditions on such a\nsurface, given the time-travel structure, and in some cases such\nstates are \u201cunderconstrained\u201d, so that states on edgeless\nspace-like surfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way\nthat they usually do, given the time travel structure. There can also\nbe mixtures of those two types of cases. The extent to which states\nare overconstrained and/or underconstrained in realistic models is as\nyet unclear, though it would be very surprising if neither obtained.\nThe extant literature has primarily focused on the problem of\noverconstraint, since that, often, either is regarded as a\nmetaphysical obstacle to the possibility time travel, or as an\nepistemological obstacle to the plausibility of time travel in our\nworld. While it is true that our world would be quite different from\nthe way we normally think it is if states were overconstrained,\nunderconstraint seems at least as bizarre as overconstraint.\nNonetheless, neither directly rules out the possibility of time\ntravel.\n\nIf time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be\nsettled. And indeed, most of the stories employing time travel in\npopular culture are logically incoherent: one cannot\n\u201cchange\u201d the past to be different from what it was, since\nthe past (like the present and the future) only occurs once. But if\nthe only requirement demanded is logical coherence, then it seems all\ntoo easy. A clever author can devise a coherent time-travel scenario\nin which everything happens just once and in a consistent way. This is\njust too cheap: logical coherence is a very weak condition, and many\nthings we take to be metaphysically impossible are logically coherent.\nFor example, it involves no logical contradiction to suppose that\nwater is not molecular, but if both chemistry and Kripke are right it\nis a metaphysical impossibility. We have been interested not in\nlogical possibility but in physical possibility. But even so, our\nconditions have been relatively weak: we have asked only whether\ntime-travel is consistent with the universal validity of certain\nfundamental physical laws and with the notion that the physical state\non a surface prior to the time travel region be unconstrained. It is\nperfectly possible that the physical laws obey this condition, but\nstill that time travel is not metaphysically possible because of the\nnature of time itself. Consider an analogy. Aristotle believed that\nwater is homoiomerous and infinitely divisible: any bit of water could\nbe subdivided, in principle, into smaller bits of water.\nAristotle\u2019s view contains no logical contradiction. It was\ncertainly consistent with Aristotle\u2019s conception of water that\nit be homoiomerous, so this was, for him, a conceptual possibility.\nBut if chemistry is right, Aristotle was wrong both about what water\nis like and what is possible for it. It can\u2019t be infinitely\ndivided, even though no logical or conceptual analysis would reveal\nthat.\n\nSimilarly, even if all of our consistency conditions can be met, it\ndoes not follow that time travel is physically possible, only that\nsome specific physical considerations cannot rule it out. The only\nserious proof of the possibility of time travel would be a\ndemonstration of its actuality. For if we agree that there is no\nactual time travel in our universe, the supposition that there might\nhave been involves postulating a substantial difference from\nactuality, a difference unlike in kind from anything we could know if\nfirsthand. It is unclear to us exactly what the content of possible\nwould be if one were to either maintain or deny the possibility of\ntime travel in these circumstances, unless one merely meant that the\npossibility is not ruled out by some delineated set of constraints. As\nthe example of Aristotle\u2019s theory of water shows, conceptual and\nlogical \u201cpossibility\u201d do not entail possibility in a\nfull-blooded sense. What exactly such a full-blooded sense would be in\ncase of time travel, and whether one could have reason to believe it\nto obtain, remain to us obscure.\n",
