    "main_text": "The Logic of Counterfactuals || Comparing the Logics\n2.4 Comparing the Logics\n\n\nThe issue of whether a second wave strict analysis\n(\u00a72.2.1) or a similarity\nanalysis provides a better logic of counterfactuals is very much an\nopen and subtle issue. As\nsections 2.2.1\nand 2.3 detailed, both analyses have their own\nway of capturing the non-monotonic interpretation of antecedents. Both\nanalyses also have their own way of capturing instances of monotonic\ninferences that do sound good. Perhaps this issue is destined for a\nstalemate.[31]\nBut before declaring it such, it is important to investigate two\npatterns that are potentially more\ndecisive: Simplification of Disjunctive\nAntecedents, and a pattern not yet discussed\ncalled Import-Export.\n\n\nBoth SDA\nand Import-Export are valid in a strict\nanalyses and invalid on standard similarity analyses. Crucially, the\ncounterexamples to them that have been offered by similarity theorists\nare significantly less compelling than those offered to patterns\nlike Antecedent Strengthening. Import-Export\nrelates counterfactuals like (33a)\nand (33b). \n\n\n(33)\n\n\na.\nIf Jean-Paul had danced and Simone had drummed, there would have been a groovy party.\nb.\nIf Jean-Paul had danced, then if Simone had drummed, there would have been a groovy party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is hard to imagine one being true without the\nother. The basic strict analysis agrees:\nit renders them equivalent.\n\nImport-Export\n\\((\\phi_1\\land\\phi_2)>\\psi\\,\\leftmodels\\vDash \\phi_1>(\\phi_2>\\psi)\\)\n\n\n\n But it is not valid on a\n similarity analysis.[32]\n While Import-Export is generally regarded\nas a plausible principle, some have challenged\nit. Kaufmann (2005: 213) presents an\nexample involving indicative conditionals which can be adapted to\nsubjunctives. Consider a case where there is a wet match which will\nlight if tossed in the campfire, but not if it is struck. It has not\nbeen lit. Consider now: \n\n\n(34)\n\n\na.\nIf this match had been lit, it would have been lit if it had been struck.\nb.\nIf this match had been struck and it had been lit, it would have been lit.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne might then deny (34a). This match would\nnot have lit if it had been struck, and if it had lit it would have to\nhave been thrown into the campfire. (34b),\non the other hand, seems like a straightforward logical\ntruth. However, it is worth noting that this intuition\nabout (34a) is very fragile. The slight\nvariation of (34a)\nin (35) is easy to hear as\ntrue.\n\n\n(35)\nIf this match had been lit, then if it had been struck it (still) would have been lit.\n\n\n\nThis subtle issue may be moot, however. Starr\n(2014) shows that a dynamic semantic implementation of the\nsimilarity analysis can\nvalidate Import-Export, so it may not be\nimportant for settling between strict and similarity analyses.\n\n\n As for the\n Simplification of Disjunctive Antecedents (SDA),\n Fine\n(1975), Nute\n(1975b), Loewer (1976),\nand Warmbr\u014dd (1981) each object to\nthe similarity analysis predicting that this pattern is\ninvalid. Counterexamples like (29)\nfrom Mckay & van Inwagen 1977: 354)\nhave a suspicious feature.\n\n\n(29)\n\n\na.\nIf Spain had fought for the Axis or the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis.\nb.\nIf Spain had fought for the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis.\n\n\n\n\nStarr (2014: 1049)\nand Warmbr\u014dd (1981a: 284) observe\n that\n (29a)\n seems to be another way of saying\nthat Spain would never have fought for the\nAllies. While Warmbr\u014dd (1981a: 284)\nuses this to pragmatically explain-away this counterexample to his\nstrict analysis, Starr (2014: 1049)\nmakes a further critical point: it sounds inconsistent to\n say\n (29a)\n after asserting that Spain could have fought for the Allies.\n\n\n(36)\nSpain didn\u2019t fight for either the Allies or the Axis. \n    She really could have fought for the Allies. \n    # But, if she had fought for the Axis or the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis.\n\n\nStarr (2014: 1049) argues that this\nmakes it inconsistent for a similarity theorist to regard this as a\n counterexample to\n SDA. On a similarity analysis\nof the could claim, it follows that there are no worlds in\nwhich Spain fought for the Allies most similar to the actual world:\n\\(f(w_@,{\\llbracket}\\mathsf{Allies}{\\rrbracket})={\\emptyset}\\). But if\n that\u2019s the case, then\n (29b)\n is vacuously\ntrue on a similarity analysis, and so a similarity theorist cannot\nconsistently claim that this is a case where the premise is true and\nconclusion false. It is, however, too soon for the strict theorist to\ndeclare victory. Nute\n(1980a), Alonso-Ovalle (2009),\nand Starr (2014: 1049) each develop\nsimilarity analyses where disjunction is given a non-Boolean\n interpretation to validate\n SDA\n without validating\nthe other antecedent monotonic patterns. But even this is not the end\n of the\n SDA\n debate.\n\nNute (1980b: 33) considers a similar\nantecedent simplification pattern involving negated conjunctions:\n\nSimplification of Negated Conjunctive Antecedents (SNCA)\n\\(\\neg(\\phi_1\\land \\phi_2)>\\neg \\psi\\vDash (\\neg\\phi_1>\\psi)\\land(\\neg\\phi_2>\\psi)\\)\n\n\nNute (1980b: 33) presents\n (37)\n in favor of SNCA. \n\n\n(37)\n\n\na.\nIf Nixon and Agnew had not both resigned, Ford would never have become President. \n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\neg(N\\land A)>\\neg F}\\)\nb.\nIf Nixon had not resigned, Ford would never have become President. \n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\neg N>\\neg F}\\)\nc.\nIf Agnew had not resigned, Ford would never have become President. \n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\neg A>\\neg F}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \\(\\mathsf{\\neg(N\\land A)}\\) and \n\\(\\mathsf{\\neg N\\lor\\neg A}\\) are Boolean equivalents. However, \nnon-Boolean analyses like Nute (1980a), \nAlonso-Ovalle (2009),\nand Starr (2014: 1049) designed to\n capture\n SDA\n break this equivalence, and so fail\n to predict that\n SNCA\n is valid. Willer (2015, 2017) develops a\ndynamic strict analysis which validates both\n SDA\n and SNCA. Fine (2012a,b) advocates for a\ndeparture from possible worlds semantics altogether in order to\ncapture both\n SDA and SNCA. However, these\n accounts also face counterexamples. Fine\n(2012a,b) and Willer (2015, 2017)\nrender \\((\\neg\\phi_1\\lor\\neg\\phi_2)>\\psi\\) and\n\\(\\neg(\\phi_1\\land\\phi_2)>\\psi\\) equivalent,\nwhile Champollion, Ciardelli, and Zhang\n(2016) present a powerful counterexample to this\nequivalence.\n\nChampollion, Ciardelli, and Zhang (2016)\nconsider a light which is on when switches A and B are\nboth up, or both down. Currently, both switches are up, and the light\nis on. Consider\n (38a)\n and\n (38b)\n whose antecedents are Boolean equivalents: \n\n\n(38)\n\n\na.\nIf Switch A or Switch B were down, the light would be off. \n\t\\(\\mathsf{(\\neg A\\lor\\neg B)>\\neg L}\\)\nb.\nIf Switch A and Switch B were not both up, the light would be off. \n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\neg (A\\land B)>\\neg L}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile\n (38a)\n is intuitively true,\n (38b)\n is\n not.[33]\n This is not a counterexample to\n SNCA,\n since the premise of that pattern is false. But such a counterexample \nis not hard to think\n up.[34] \n\n\nSuppose the baker\u2019s apprentice completely failed at baking our\ncake. It was burnt to a crisp, and the thin, lumpy frosting came out\npuke green. The baker planned to redecorate it to make it at least\nlook delicious, but did not have time. We may explain our extreme\ndissatisfaction by asserting\n (39a).\n But the\nbaker should not infer\n (39b)\n and assume that his redecoration plan would have worked. \n\n\n(39)\n\n\na.\nIf the cake had not been burnt to a crisp and ugly, we would have been happy.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\neg(B\\land U)>H}\\)\nb.\nIf the cake had not been ugly, we would have been happy.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\neg U>H}\\)\n\n\n\n\nWiller (2017: \u00a74.2) suggests that\n such a counterexample trades on interpreting \n\\(\\mathsf{\\neg(B\\land U)>H}\\) \nas \n\\(\\mathsf{\\neg B\\land\\neg U)>H}\\), \nand provides an\nindependent explanation of this on the basis of how negation and\nconjunction interact. If this is right, then an analysis which\n validates\n SDA\n and\n SNCA\n without rendering \\(\\neg(\\phi_1\\land\\phi_2)>\\psi\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\phi_1\\lor\\neg\\phi_2>\\psi\\) equivalent is what\u2019s\nneeded. Ciardelli, Zhang, and Champollion\n(forthcoming) develop just such an\nanalysis. As Ciardelli, Zhang, and Champollion\n(forthcoming: \u00a76.4) explain, SDA\nand SNCA turn out to be valid for very different\nreasons. Champollion, Ciardelli, and Zhang\n(2016) and Ciardelli, Zhang, and Champollion (forthcoming)\nalso argue that the falsity of (38b)\ncannot be predicted on a similarity analysis. This example must be\nadded to a long list of examples which have been presented not as\ncounterexamples to the logic of the similarity analysis, but to what\nit predicts (or fails to predict) about the truth of particular\ncounterfactuals in particular contexts. This will be the topic\n of\n \u00a72.5,\n where it will also be\nexplained why the strict analysis faces similar challenges.\n\n\nWhere does this leave us in logical the debate between strict and\nsimilarity analyses of counterfactuals?\nEven Import-Export\nand SDA fail to clearly identify one analysis as\nsuperior. It is possible to capture SDA on either\nanalysis. Existing similarity analyses that\nvalidate SDA, however, also\ninvalidate SNCA (Alonso-Ovalle\n2009; Starr 2014). By contrast existing strict analyses that\nvalidate SDA also\nvalidate SNCA (Willer 2015,\n2017). However, this is far from decisive. The validity of SNCA\nis still being investigated, and it is far from clear that it is\nimpossible to have a similarity analysis that validates\nboth SDA and SNCA, or a strict analysis that\nvalidates only SDA (perhaps using a non-Boolean\nsemantics for disjunction). So even SNCA may fail to be the conclusive\npattern needed to separate these analyses.\n",
