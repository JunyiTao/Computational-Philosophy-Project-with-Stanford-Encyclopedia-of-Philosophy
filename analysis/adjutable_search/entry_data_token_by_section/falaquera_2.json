    "main_text": "Falaquera as paraphraser\n3. Falaquera as paraphraser\n\n\nFalaquera sought to make available in Hebrew the most important\nwritings of the Greek and Islamic philosophers. Interestingly,\nFalaquera rarely simply translated a text and rarely identified his\nprecise source. A good illustration of this is Falaquera\u2019s Reshit\nHokhmah. His intention in this book is to treat concisely\n\u201cwhatever the seeker of wisdom needs to apprehend at the\nbeginning of his studies\u201d (9). He divides it into three parts.\nPart one is on the moral virtues, for as Falaquera explains,\n\u201cWhoever wishes to engage in the study of science and to\napprehend its truth must begin to accustom himself to the moral\nvirtues\u201d (10). This part blends Biblical verses and rabbinic\nsayings with short passages from the Summa Alexandrinorum and\nconcludes with a pseudo-Aristotelian letter.  The second part is an\nenumeration of the sciences, which is primarily an abridged version of\nAlfarabi\u2019s Ihs\u00e2\u2019 al-\u2018ul\u00fbm\n(Enumeration of the Sciences), but also incorporates other writings by\nAlfarabi such as his Kit\u00e2b al-hur\u00fbf (Book of\nLetters) and small sections from Avicenna\u2019s F\u00ee aqs\u00e2m\nal-\u2018ul\u00fbm al-\u2018aqliyyah (On the Division of the\nRational Sciences).  Falaquera integrates these texts into his version\nof Alfarabi\u2019s enumeration of the sciences in order to make a new\ncoherent work, which provides important material not present in his\nprimary text. Thus, for example, chapters 2 and 4 from part 2 of\nReshit Hokhmah, \u201cOn How Language Originates in a\nNation\u201d and \u201cOn How the Sciences Originate among\nMen\u201d \u2013 the two selections from the Kit\u00e2b\nal-hur\u00fbf \u2013 introduce respectively chapters 3 on\nlanguage and chapters 5\u20139 on logic and the sciences \u2013 chapters \ntranslated from Ihs\u00e2\u2019\nal-\u2018ul\u00fbm. For another example, a section on\npolitical science from Avicenna\u2019s division of the sciences follows the\nparallel discussion in Alfarabi, and provides the reader with the\ntraditional Aristotelian division of practical science into governance\nof the city, governance of the household, and governance of oneself or\nethics. Part 3 of Reshit Hokhmah, on explaining that\nphilosophy is necessary for the attainment of true happiness, is an\nabridged translation of Alfarabi\u2019s trilogy on the philosophy of Plato\nand Aristotle. In this part, Falaquera focuses on the Alfarabian texts\nhe is presenting and incorporates no other texts, but through a\njudicious choice of what to translate and what not, Falaquera is able\nto adapt the works to suit his own purposes. Thus, he omits from his\nparaphrase Alfarabi\u2019s controversial statements on the relation between\nphilosophy and religion, such as those that suggest that philosophy\nalone is necessary for human happiness and perfection, and\nthat religion is an imitation of philosophy that is useful for\nteaching and governing the multitude, but does not contribute to the\nperfection of the philosopher\u2019s intellect (see Harvey,\n\u201cFalaquera\u2019s Alfarabi\u201d). Another aspect of Falaquera\u2019s\nparaphrasing of texts is his occasional Judaizing of his sources\nthrough the insertion of Biblical or Talmudic citations and references\nor the addition of Jewish material. An example of the latter is in the\nbeginning of Reshit Hokhmah, part 2, where he adds to\nAlfarabi\u2019s list of benefits of an enumeration of sciences that it\nmakes clear that these sciences do not contradict the Torah and that\nit is permissible for Jews to study them. It may be added that\nFalaquera\u2019s Hebrew abridgements of Alfarabi\u2019s books in parts two and\nthree are not attributed to their author; Falaquera simply explains\nthat all \u201cthese words on the sciences are the words of Aristotle\nor those philosophers of his school\u201d (61).  Falaquera\u2019s\nselective translation of texts and his not mentioning his sources give\nhim the leeway to alter the content and message of those texts in ways\nthat are not possible for faithful translators.\n\n\nWhile in books like Reshit Hokhmah (particularly parts 2 and\n3), Falaquera basically pieces together abridged versions of books by\nothers without mentioning their names, the Sefer\nha-Ma\u2018alot \u2013 the book that follows Reshit\nHokhmah in the trilogy \u2013 is filled with numerous short\nquotations, most of which are attributed to an author, such as Plato,\nAristotle (although often in connection with citations from the\nSumma Alexandrinorum and the Pseudo-Aristotle, Theology\nof Aristotle), Alfarabi, and Maimonides, or to the Philosopher\n(by which he usually means Ibn B\u00e2jjah) or to the Scholar (by\nwhich he usually means Averroes). This work is also replete with\nquotations from the Bible and rabbinic literature\n",
