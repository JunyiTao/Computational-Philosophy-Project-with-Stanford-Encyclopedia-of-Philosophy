    "main_text": "Epistemological Views || Fallibilism\n3.4 Fallibilism\n\nPhilo\u2019s motivation for his final shift away from skepticism in\nthe Roman Books can be seen, at least in part, from the criticisms\ndirected at him by his ex-student Antiochus before their publication\nin 88/7 BCE. These criticisms point to a kind of instability inherent\nin mitigated skepticism: it seems to waver unhealthily between a\ndogmatic position allowing for something approaching certainty about\nsome questions and a radical skepticism about our ability to make any\nepistemic progress. More specifically, it suggests that we can take\npersuasive impressions as evidence for the truth that is firm enough\nto warrant assent\u2014thus allowing for a life guided by reasoned\nbelief, and even ethical teaching\u2014while simultaneously\nmaintaining that even the most perfect rational consideration of the\nevidence is compatible with wholesale error. (See the argument in\nCicero Ac. 2.111, addressed explicitly to Philo prior to his\nRoman view, and its elaboration in Ac. 2.34\u20136 &\n2.43\u201344. These Antiochian criticisms are echoed almost verbatim\nby Aenesidemus in Photius Library 212 170a 14\u201338.)\n\nThe outlines of Philo\u2019s response to this problem in the Roman\nBooks are fairly clear from the direct evidence we have for their\nepistemological innovations (Cicero Ac. 2.18 and Sextus\nPH 1.235). He argued, first, that the Stoic definition of the\ncognitive impression ruled out the possibility of anything being\nknown\u2014i.e., he restated the standard Academic arguments to this\neffect\u2014and, secondly, that this definition was therefore\nmisconceived, since at least some things could be known. His\nelucidation of the second claim is unfortunately not explicit in the\nsurviving evidence. But its criticism by Antiochus (the context for\nCicero\u2019s report) very strongly suggests that Philo offered an\nalternative and weaker definition of knowledge of single propositions.\nFor Antiochus both characterizes Philo\u2019s innovations as an\nattempt to redefine \u201ccognition\u201d (Ac. 2.17 &\n2.18 fin.) and attempts to refute them by arguing that an impression\nthat does not meet the condition given in the third clause of the\nStoic definition (see\n section 3.1\n above) cannot be \u201ccognitive\u201d. Philo\u2019s new\ndefinition thus amounted to something like the Stoic definition minus\nits third clause (the clause the Academics had always disputed). If\nso, Philo claimed that an impression is cognitive if it is both [a]\ntrue and [b] caused in the appropriate way for correctly representing\nits object\u2014without adding the disputed Stoic rider [c], that its\ntruth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of\nrepresentation guaranteed by its causal history.\n\nThis bare outline of Philo\u2019s final position is sufficient to\nshow its novelty, and thus explain its poor reception by Antiochus and\nthe Academics alike (see Ac. 2.11\u201312, 2.18). His new\nconception of knowledge was a radical innovation in three respects.\nFirst, given his acceptance of the standard Academic arguments against\nself-warranting cognitive impressions, it offered a fallibilist\ntheory, which allows for unqualified assent to knowledge claims on the\nbasis of impressions that might nonetheless be false. Antiochus\u2019\ncriticism suggests that he defended this view by pointing out that the\ntheoretical or counterfactual possibility of error was epistemically\nirrelevant in cases where the impression is in fact true and our\npositive evidence for it is, in practice, conclusive (see Barnes\n1989). But however he justified it, Philo\u2019s new conception of\nknowledge challenged the fundamental epistemological principle of the\nHellenistic period that knowledge must be certain. Secondly,\nPhilo\u2019s new theory implied that there is in fact a good deal of\nknowledge. It thus constituted an apparently radical rejection of the\nbasic thesis that all the skeptical Academics had shared, that nothing\ncan be known. And, thirdly, Philo\u2019s theory implied a revised\nprinciple of rationality. The mitigated skeptics had responded to the\nStoic inactivity objection by identifying rationality with forming\ndefeasible beliefs on the basis of the available evidence. But, by\nqualifying the assent of the rational agent as \u201cmeasured\u201d\nor provisional, they insulated rationality itself from practical\nerror: whether or not the belief is false, an agent who forms it on\nthe appropriate grounds is never mistaken in holding it provisionally.\nOn Philo\u2019s new position, however, rationality is compatible with\noutright error because it is rational to give straightforward,\nunqualified assent to impressions that might nonetheless be false. The\nRoman Books thus marked Philo\u2019s final rejection of the joint\nStoic and Academic thesis that the avoidance of error is an overriding\nprinciple of rationality.\n\nThis sketch of their implications explains why Philo\u2019s\ninnovations were decisive enough to startle his contemporaries and,\neventually, to lead to the doxographical classification of his version\nof Academicism as a distinct \u201cFourth Academy\u201d (see, e.g.,\nSextus PH 1.220 & 1.235). But two facts imply that his\nfurther elucidation in the Roman Books included some significant\nlimitations on the range of knowledge Philo came to accept, and hence\nthe sense in which he rejected the skepticism of his Academic\npredecessors. The first is just that his contemporaries (and later\nhistorians) continued to regard him, even at the end of his career, as\nan Academic, i.e., in some way a follower of Arcesilaus and Carneades,\nrather than a defector like Antiochus or Aenesidemus. The second is\nthat Philo asserted \u201cthe unity of the Academy\u201d in the\nRoman Books (see Cicero Ac. 1.13), i.e., claimed that his new\nview was in fact the underlying view of all the Academics from\nSocrates and Plato to himself. Exactly what he meant by this claim is\ncontroversial, but the tenuous and complex evidence does not suggest\nthat it involved either accepting an anti-skeptical reading of Plato\nor denying that the skeptical Academics were skeptical about the\npossibility of achieving theoretical knowledge in philosophy (see\nBrittain 2001: chs. 4\u20135 and Tarrant 2018: 86\u201387).\n\nBy combining these external constraints on our understanding of the\nepistemological innovations of the Roman Books with their\nphilosophical context\u2014Philo\u2019s prior position of mitigated\nskepticism and the criticisms it faced\u2014we can see, at least\nroughly, how Philo may have given flesh to the basic outline above.\nTaken together, these considerations suggest three constraints on the\nrange of the knowledge that Philo accepted. They suggest, first, that\nPhilo supplemented the externalist bones of his new definition of\ncognition with the internalist constraints on assent that the\nmitigated skeptics had already identified: assent to a Philonian\ncognitive impression would only be warranted when the representational\n\u201crichness\u201d guaranteed by its causal history (condition [b]\nabove) was confirmed by meeting the additional perceptual and\ncoherence conditions Carneades had identified for persuasive\nimpressions. Secondly, that Philo took Philonian cognition to apply\nprimarily to experiential knowledge, i.e., the kind that we ascribe to\nourselves in virtue of perception and to experts with practical\nskills, or something like \u201cordinary knowledge\u201d. And\nthirdly, that Philo accordingly did not assume that the results of\nphilosophical inquiry would often, or even usually, or perhaps ever,\namount to knowledge when subjected to rational criticism through\nargument on either side. (The evidence that might support these three\nclaims is collected in Brittain 2001: ch. 3.)\n\nThe hypothesis that Philo\u2019s fleshed-out final theory of\nknowledge was roughly along these lines makes sense of both the\ncontext and the reception of his innovations. It also allows us to\noffer a more philosophically satisfying explanation of his eventual\nacceptance of the possibility of knowledge than Antiochus\u2019\nsuggestion that he was unable to endure the criticisms he and other\nAcademics had dealt with for thirty years (Cicero Ac. 2.18).\nBy allowing for the existence of ordinary, fallible knowledge, Philo\nchallenged the epistemological framework of his era; but by limiting\nknowledge so that it did not include most of the results of\nphilosophical inquiry, and by ascribing the acceptance of this view to\nthe entire Academic tradition, he sought to redefine the skeptical\nAcademy in terms of its original Socratic function as the non-dogmatic\ncritic of philosophical pretensions to theoretical knowledge. On this\nview, Academic philosophy is not defined by an epistemological\nposition (as even Clitomachus\u2019 radical skepticism appears to\nhave been), but by the critical method of argument on either side.\n",
