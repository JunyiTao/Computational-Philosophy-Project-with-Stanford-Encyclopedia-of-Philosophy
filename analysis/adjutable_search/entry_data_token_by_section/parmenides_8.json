    "main_text": "Some Principal Types of Interpretation || The Meta-Principle Interpretation\n3.3 The Meta-Principle Interpretation\n\nOne influential alternative to interpretations of Parmenides as a\nstrict monist, certainly among scholars working in America, has been\nthat developed by Alexander Mourelatos in his 1970 monograph, The\nRoute of Parmenides. (See Mourelatos 1979 for a succinct\npresentation of this alternative in response to perceived shortcomings\nin Owen\u2019s logical-dialectical reading.) Mourelatos saw\nParmenides as utilizing a specialized, predicative sense of the verb\n\u201cto be\u201d in speaking of \u201cwhat is\u201d, a sense used\nto reveal a thing\u2019s nature or essence. This sense of the verb,\ndubbed by Mourelatos \u201cthe \u2018is\u2019 of speculative\npredication,\u201d is supposed to feature in statements of the form,\n\u201cX is Y,\u201d where the predicate\n\u201cbelongs essentially to, or is a necessary condition for, the\nsubject\u201d and thus gives X\u2019s reality, essence,\nnature, or true constitution (Mourelatos 1970, 56\u201360). Alexander\nNehamas would likewise propose that Parmenides employs\n\u201cis\u201d in the very strong sense of \u201cis what it is to\nbe,\u201d so that his concern is with \u201cthings which are\nF in the strong sense of being what it is to be\nF\u201d (Nehamas 1981, 107; although Nehamas cites Owen as\nwell as Mourelatos as an influence, Owen himself took\nParmenides\u2019 use of the verb \u201cto be\u201d in \u201cwhat\nis\u201d as existential [see Owen 1960, 94]). On the resulting type\nof interpretation, the first major phase of Parmenides\u2019 poem\nprovides a higher-order account of what the fundamental entities of\nany ontology would have to be like: they would have to be F,\nfor some F, in this specially strong way. As such, it is not\nan account of what there is (namely, one thing, the only one that\nexists) but, rather, of whatever is in the manner required to be an\nontologically fundamental entity\u2014a thing that is F, for\nsome F, in an essential way. Thus Nehamas has more recently\nwritten:\n\nthe \u201csignposts\u201d along the way of Being which Parmenides\ndescribes in B 8 [may be taken] as adverbs that characterize a\nparticular and very restrictive way of being. The signposts then tell\nus what conditions must be met if a subject is to be something in the\nappropriate way, if it is to be really something, and thus be a real\nsubject. And to be really something, F, is to be\nF\u2014B 8 tells us\u2014ungenerably and imperishably,\nwholly, only and indivisibly, unchangingly, perfectly and completely.\n\u2026 Parmenides uses \u201cbeing\u201d to express a very strong\nnotion, which Aristotle eventually was to capture with his concept of\n\u201cwhat it is to be.\u201d To say of something that it is\nF is to say that F constitutes its nature (Nehamas\n2002, 50).\n\n\nA variant of the meta-principle interpretation, one that also draws\nupon Barnes\u2019s suggestion that nothing in the \u201cTruth\u201d\nprecludes there being a plurality of Parmenidean Beings, has been\ndeveloped by Patricia Curd. On her view, Parmenides was not a strict\nmonist but, rather, a proponent of what she terms \u201cpredicational\nmonism,\u201d which she defines as \u201cthe claim that each thing\nthat is can be only one thing; it can hold only the one predicate that\nindicates what it is, and must hold it in a particularly strong way.\nTo be a genuine entity, a thing must be a predicational unity, with a\nsingle account of what it is; but it need not be the case that there\nexists only one such thing. Rather, the thing itself must be a unified\nwhole. If it is, say, F, it must be all, only, and completely\nF. On predicational monism, a numerical plurality of such\none-beings (as we might call them) is possible\u201d (Curd 1998,\n66).\n\nMourelatos, Nehamas, and Curd all take Parmenides to be concerned with\nspecifying in an abstract way what it is to be the nature or essence\nof a thing, rather than simply with specifying what there in fact is,\nas he is presumed to be doing on both the logical-dialectical and the\nmore traditional strict monist readings. Since the meta-principle\nreading takes Parmenides\u2019 major argument in fragment 8 to be\nprogrammatic instead of merely paradoxical or destructive, it suggests\na somewhat different narrative structure for the history of early\nGreek philosophy, one where the so-called \u201cpost-Parmenidean\npluralists\u201d\u2014Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the early\natomists, Leucippus and Democritus\u2014were not reacting against\nParmenides, but were actually endorsing his requirements that what\nreally is be ungenerated, imperishable, and absolutely changeless,\nwhen they conceived of the principles of their respective physical\nsystems in these terms. The meta-principle reading has also seemed to\nre-open the possibility that Parmenides was engaged in critical\nreflection upon the principles of his predecessors\u2019 physical\nsystems.\n\nIf the first phase of Parmenides\u2019 poem provides a higher-order\ndescription of the features that must belong to any proper physical\nprinciple, then one would naturally expect the ensuing cosmology to\ndeploy principles that meet Parmenides\u2019 own requirements. The\ngoddess describes the cosmology, however, as an account of \u201cthe\nbeliefs of mortals, in which there is no genuine conviction\u201d\n(fr. 1.30, cf. fr. 8.50\u20132) and commences this part of her\nrevelation by describing how mortals have wandered astray by picking\nout two forms, light and night, to serve as the basis for an account\nof the cosmos\u2019 origin and operation (fr. 8.53\u20139).\nAdvocates of the meta-principle reading here face a dilemma. On the\none hand, they cannot plausibly maintain that the cosmology is what\ntheir overall interpretation would lead one to expect, namely,\nParmenides\u2019 effort at developing a cosmology in accordance with\nhis own strictures upon what the principles of such an account must be\nlike. The cosmological principles light and night do not in fact\nconform to those strictures. But then why should Parmenides have\nbothered to present a fundamentally flawed or\n\u201cnear-correct\u201d cosmology, founded upon principles that\nfail to satisfy the very requirements he himself has supposedly\nspecified? If one falls back on the position that the cosmology in the\npoem is not Parmenides\u2019 own (which remains implausible given the\ncosmology\u2019s innovations), then it becomes even more puzzling why\nhe should have described what the principles of an adequate cosmology\nmust be like and then failed to try to present one.\n\nThe presence of the cosmology in Parmenides\u2019 poem continues to\nbe problematic for advocates of the meta-principle interpretation,\njust as it is for advocates of the other major types of interpretation\ndiscussed thus far. Guthrie views the cosmology as Parmenides\u2019\nbest attempt at giving an account of the sensible world, given that we\nwill continue to be deceived into thinking it exists despite his\narguments to the contrary. Not only is this an unstable interpretive\nposition, it imputes confusion to Parmenides rather than acknowledge\nits own difficulties. It is hardly more satisfying to be told by Owen\nthat Parmenides\u2019 cosmology has a purpose that is \u201cwholly\ndialectical\u201d (Owen 1960, 54\u20135; cf. Long 1963 for a more\ndetailed development of this interpretive line).\n\nAlthough they repeat the essentials of Owen\u2019s view, Kirk, Raven,\nand Schofield finally acknowledge that the presence of the elaborate\ncosmology remains problematic for this line of interpretation:\n\u201cWhy [the cosmology] was included in the poem remains a mystery:\nthe goddess seeks to save the phenomena so far as is possible, but she\nknows and tells us that the project is impossible\u201d (Kirk, Raven,\nand Schofield 1983, 262, after echoing Owen\u2019s line on the\ncosmology\u2019s dialectical character at 254\u20136). While the\nmeta\u2013principle interpretation raises the expectation, which\nfails to be met, that the principles of Parmenides\u2019 cosmology\nwill conform to the requirements he has supposedly specified earlier\nin the poem, the strict monist and logical-dialectical interpretations\nleave even some of their own advocates wondering why Parmenides\ndevoted the bulk of his poem to an account of things his own reasoning\nis supposed to have shown do not exist.\n",
