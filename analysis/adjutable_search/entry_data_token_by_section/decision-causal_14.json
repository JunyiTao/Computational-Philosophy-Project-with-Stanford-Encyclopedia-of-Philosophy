Related Topics and Concluding Remarks\n\nCausal decision theory has foundations in various areas of philosophy.\nFor example, it relies on metaphysics for an account of causation. It\nalso relies on inductive logic for an account of inferences concerning\ncausation. A comprehensive causal decision theory treats not only\ncausal probabilities\u2019 generation of options\u2019 expected\nutilities, but also evidence\u2019s generation of causal\nprobabilities.\n\nResearch concerning causation contributes to the metaphysical\nfoundations of causal decision theory. Nancy Cartwright (1979), for\nexample, draws on ideas about causation to flesh out details of causal\ndecision theory. Also, some accounts of causation distinguish types of\ncauses. Both oxygen and a flame are metaphysical causes of\ntinder\u2019s combustion. However, only the flame is causally\nresponsible for, and so a normative cause of, the combustion. Causal\nresponsibility for an event accrues to just the salient metaphysical\ncauses of the event. Causal decision theory is interested not only in\nevents for which an act is causally responsible, but also in other\nevents for which an act is a metaphysical cause. Expected utilities\nthat guide decisions are comprehensive.\n\nJudea Pearl (2000) and also Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard\nScheines (2000) present methods of inferring causal relations from\nstatistical data. They use directed acyclic graphs and associated\nprobability distributions to construct causal models. In a decision\nproblem, a causal model yields a way of calculating an act\u2019s\neffect. A causal graph and its probability distribution express a\ndependency hypothesis and yield each act\u2019s causal influence\ngiven that hypothesis. They specify the causal probability of a state\nunder supposition of an act. An act\u2019s expected utility is a\nprobability-weighted average of its expected utility according to the\ndependency hypotheses that candidate causal models represent, as\nWeirich (2015: 225\u2013236) explains.\n\nA causal model\u2019s directed graph and probability distribution\nindicate causal relations among event types. As Pearl (2000: 30) and\nSprites et al. (2000: 11) explain, a causal model meets the causal\nMarkov condition if and only if with respect to its probability\ndistribution each event type in its directed graph is independent of\nall the event type\u2019s nondescendants, given its parents. Given a\nmodel meeting the condition, knowledge of all an event\u2019s direct\ncauses makes other information statistically irrelevant to the\nevent\u2019s occurrence, except for information about the event and\nits effects. Knowledge of an event\u2019s direct causes screens off\nevidence from indirect causes and independent effects of its causes.\nGiven a typical causal model for Newcomb\u2019s problem, knowledge of\nthe common cause of a decision and a prediction screens off the\ncorrelation between the decision and the prediction.\n\nDirected acyclic graphs present causal structure clearly, and so\nclarify in decision theory points that depend on causal structure. For\nexample, Eells (2000) observes that choice is not genuine unless a\ndecision screens off an act\u2019s correlation with states. Joyce\n(2007: 546) uses a causal graph to depict how this may happen in a\nNewcomb problem that arises in a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with a\npsychological twin. He shows that the Newcomb problem is a genuine\nchoice despite correlation of acts and states because a decision\nscreens off that correlation. Wolfgang Spohn (2012) constructs for\nNewcomb\u2019s problem a causal model that distinguishes a decision\nand its execution and argues that given the model causal decision\ntheory recommends one-boxing. An act in a decision problem may\nconstitute an intervention in the causal model for the decision\nproblem, as Meek and Glamour (1994) explain. Hitchcock (2016) and Joyce and Gibbard (2016)\nmaintain that treating an act as an intervention enriches causal\ndecision theory.\n\nTimothy Williamson (2007: Chap. 5) studies the epistemology of\ncounterfactual, or subjunctive, conditionals. He points out their role\nin contingency planning and decision making. According to his account,\none learns a subjunctive conditional if one robustly obtains its\nconsequent when imagining its antecedent. Experience disciplines\nimagination. The experience leading to a judgment that a subjunctive\nconditional holds may be neither strictly enabling nor strictly\nevidential so that knowledge of the conditional is neither purely\na priori nor purely a posteriori. Williamson claims\nthat knowledge of subjunctive conditionals is foundational so that\ndecision theory appropriately grounds knowledge of an act\u2019s\nchoiceworthiness in knowledge of such conditionals.\n\nMost texts on decision theory are consistent with causal decision\ntheory. Many do not treat the special cases, such as Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem, that motivate a distinction between causal and evidential\ndecision theory. For example, Leonard Savage (1954) analyzes only\ndecision problems in which options do not affect probabilities of\nstates, as his account of utility makes clear (1954: 73). Causal and\nevidential decision theories reach the same recommendations in these\nproblems. Causal decision theory is the prevailing form of decision\ntheory among those who distinguish causal and evidential decision\ntheory.\n",
