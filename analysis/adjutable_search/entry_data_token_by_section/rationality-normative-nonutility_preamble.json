    "main_text": "\n\nExpected utility theory, which holds that a decision-maker\nought to maximize expected utility, is the prevailing theory of\ninstrumental rationality. Nonetheless, four major challenges have\narisen to the claim that the theory characterizes all rational\npreferences. These challenges are the phenomena of infinite or\nunbounded value, incommensurable goods, imprecise probabilities, and\nrisk-aversion. The challenges have been accompanied by alternative\ntheories that attempt to do better.\n\n\nExpected utility theory consists of three components. The first is a\nutility function that assigns real numbers to consequences. The second\nis a probability function that assigns real numbers between 0 and 1 to\nevery possible event. The final component is an \u201caggregation\nnorm\u201d that holds that the value of an act is its expected\nutility value relative to these two functions, and that rational\npreferences track expected utility value (see the entry on\n expected utility theory). \n Each challenge to EU theory\ncan be thought of as a rejection of one or more of the three\ncomponents as normative, and alternatives generally replace or extend\nthe relevant component.\n\nIt has long been observed that typical individuals do not in fact\nconform to expected utility theory, and in response, a number of\ndescriptive alternatives have arisen, particularly in the field of\neconomics (see Starmer 2000, Sugden 2004, Schmidt 2004 for surveys;\nsee also the entry on \n descriptive decision theory).  \n This article will primarily discuss views that have been\nput forth as normative.\n",
