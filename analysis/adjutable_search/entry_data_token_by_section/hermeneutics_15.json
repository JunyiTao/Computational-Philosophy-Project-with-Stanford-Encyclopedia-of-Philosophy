    "main_text": "Contemporary Hermeneutics || Language\n4.4 Language\n\nThe hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by not only\ntradition but also language. In Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics, the relation of truth to language is described in\nreference to being. Gadamer expresses this relation in a celebrated\nmotto, \u201cbeing that can be understood is language\u201d\n(Gadamer, Truth and Method,\n 474).[7]\n According to this motto, language is primarily a\n\u2018medium\u2019 that shows us the being, or meaningful order, of\nthe world and the things we encounter in it (Gadamer, Truth and\nMethod, Part\n III.1).[8]\n Thus, language is only secondarily an instrument that we use, among\nother things, to represent something, communicate about it, or make\nassertions about it. The experience of language as a medium takes\nplace in what Gadamer calls \u201chermeneutical\nconversation\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 388).\nThe primary example of such hermeneutical conversation is a\nconversation between interlocutors about something; but, he believes\nthat hermeneutical conversation also includes all interpretive\nexperience, so that the interpretation of artworks and texts is\nconceived as a conversation between the interpreter and work about the\nsubject matter of the work. In hermeneutical conversation,\ninterlocutors may, of course, use language to represent, communicate\nor make assertions. More originally, however, hermeneutical\nconversation concerns the being of the matter under consideration.\nHermeneutical conversation is thus an event of interlocution that aims\nto show something in its being, as it genuinely or truly is.\n\nThe hermeneutical experience of truth can be described as the success\nof conversation so conceived. But, in this, truth is not experienced\nas a matter of \u201ccorrectness,\u201d or as this may be clarified,\na matter of correct predication (Gadamer, Truth and Method,\n406). In the experience of truth as correct predication, truth is\ntypically conceived as the property of a proposition, statement or\nutterance that suitably connects a subject with a predicate. In the\nhermeneutical experience of truth, by contrast, the concern is not\nwith predication, that is, the connection of a subject with a\npredicate, but, instead, with conversation, grasped as an event of\ninterlocution concerned with the being of a subject itself. In such a\nconversation, truth is reached, if it is reached, not when a subject\nis suitably connected with something else, but, instead, when the\nsubject is sufficiently shown in its own being, as it truly is. The\nmeasure of such sufficiency is established not in advance, but is\nachieved in the course of conversation along with the claim of truth\nthat it measures.\n\nPhilosophical hermeneutics maintains that the experience of truth as\ncorrect predication is dependent on the hermeneutical experience of\ntruth. This is because in truth as correctness, the proper connection\nof subject and predicate depends in part on the being of the subject. In\npredication, the being of the subject is typically either left out of\naccount or is presumed already to be determined or interpreted. But,\nthe being of the subject\u2014what it truly is\u2014is a matter of\ninterpretation. In illustration, we may consider the fictional\nconversation presented by Plato in the Republic among\nSocrates, Glaucon and other interlocutors about justice. In conclusion\nof our interpretive experience, we may assert the proposition,\n\u2018justice is nearly impossible to achieve!\u2019 But, whether\nthis is so will depend on the being of justice, and the truth of the\nbeing of justice will depend, in turn, on an interpretation of it,\nwhether we derive it from Plato\u2019s text or otherwise. Truth as\ncorrectness, then, depends on the hermeneutical experience of truth,\nand such truth, in turn, is a matter of interpretation.\n\nFinally, in Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, it is claimed\nthat the hermeneutical experience of truth is \u2018universal.\u2019\nThis does not mean that the hermeneutical experience of truth takes\nplace every time we converse about something. Rather, it means that\nthe hermeneutical experience of truth remains always a problem,\nwhenever we wish to understand something, and even when a conversation\nculminates in an experience of truth. Each hermeneutical experience of\ntruth remains open to further interpretation (see Gadamer, \u201cThe\nUniversality of the Hermeneutical Problem\u201d).\n",
