    "main_text": "From Production to Consumption\n4. From Production to Consumption\n\nNone of the foregoing is about consumption. The moral vegetarian\narguments thus far have, at most, established that it is wrong to\nproduce meat in various ways. Assuming that some such argument is\nsound, how to get from the wrongness of producing meat to the\nwrongness of consuming that meat?\n\nThis question is not always taken seriously. Classics of the moral\nvegetarian literature like Singer 1975, Regan 1975, Engel 2000, and\nDeGrazia 2009 do not give much space to it. (C. Adams 1990 is a rare\ncanonical vegetarian text that devotes considerable space to\nconsumption ethics.) James Rachels writes,\n\n\nSometimes philosophers explain that [my argument for vegetarianism] is\nunconvincing because it contains a logical gap. We are all opposed to\ncruelty, they say, but it does not follow that we must become\nvegetarians. It only follows that we should favor less cruel methods\nof meat production. This objection is so feeble it is hard to believe\nit explains resistance to the basic argument [for vegetarianism].\n(2004: 74)\n\n\nYet if the objection is that it does not follow from the\nwrongness of producing meat that consuming meat is wrong, then the\nobjection is not feeble and is clearly correct. In order to validly\nderive the vegetarian conclusion, additional premises are needed.\nRachels, it turns out, has some, so perhaps it is best to interpret\nhis complaint as that it is obvious what the premises\nare.\n\nMaybe so. But there is quite a bit of disagreement about what those\nadditional premises are and plausible candidates differ greatly from\none another.\n",
