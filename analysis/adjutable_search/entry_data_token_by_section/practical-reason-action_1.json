    "main_text": "The Authorship View of Action\n2. The Authorship View of Action\n\nA second approach takes the essential feature of action to be, not its\nstepwise structure, but that it is authored; there is no such\nthing as an action without an owner, in something like the way that\nthere is no such thing as a belief without an owner. The two most\ndeveloped positions of this kind are due to Christine M. Korsgaard and\nJ. David Velleman.\n\nOn Korsgaard\u2019s view, what gives an action an owner is that it is\nattributable to the person as a whole (rather than to a subpersonal\npart, such as a drive or an especially strong desire). Whole-person\nattributions require a constitution, a form of psychic\norganization and regulation that is the smaller-scale analog of the\npolitical constitution of a state. Constitutions are made up of the\nprocedures by which actions are to be produced; actions are owned, and\nso are full-fledged actions, only when they are so produced (Korsgaard\n2008, ch. 3, Korsgaard 2009).\n\nThe principles of practical rationality are the procedures, at a\nsuitably abstract level of description, of a satisfactory\nconstitution. So, and in contrast to Vogler\u2019s view, Korsgaard\u2019s theory\nof practical rationality is psychologistic. Actions have explanatory\npriority, but actions are the starting point of an argument used to\ndetermine the proper structure of an agent\u2019s psychology: that is, we\nask what psychological structure an agent must have in place for him\nto be able to author actions. And that psychology in turn determines\nwhat the correct forms of practical inference must be. The\nphilosophical motivations of Korsgaard\u2019s position are in part\nforensic: the connection between actions and agents must be such that\nwe can hold agents responsible for what they do. More importantly,\nhowever, the account is meant to explain why your reasons are binding:\nwhat their \u2018normative force\u2019 is. \n\nHere is a first-pass thumbnail sketch of that explanation: We have to\nact, because anything we do will be an action. Chairs are to sit on,\nand so a chair you can\u2019t sit on is defective; being something you can\nsit on is a constitutive standard for chairs. Likewise, there are\nconstitutive standards for actions, in just that way; a would-be\naction that did not conform to them would also be defective. In\nKorsgaard\u2019s view, the question of why an item should conform to the\nconstitutive standards for its type \u2018answers itself\u2019\n(Korsgaard 2008, p. 61). So if she can show that deploying reasons\nsatisfying one or another requirement is a constitutive standard for\naction \u2013 and the requirements she is going to argue for are\nKantian \u2013 that will amount to showing why you should act on\nreasons that satisfy those Kantian requirements. Before we proceed to\nthat argument, notice that we are starting to see how the\nphilosophical motivations of the work we are surveying differ from\nprogram to program; the contrast between psychologistic and\nanti-psychologistic agendas is not the only, or even the most\nimportant, dimension of variation.\n\nKorsgaard contrasts acts (such as setting the table) with actions\n(such as setting the table to be ready before the guests arrive). Her\nview is that acts and the ends for which they are performed make up an\naction when they are bound together by a principle, which must be\nformally universal (e.g., always set the table before the guests\narrive). We have already noted that actions must be attributable to\nagents, and an action is properly an agent\u2019s only when it is produced\nby the agent as a whole. For attribution to be contentful, there must\nbe a real distinction between your actions, on the one hand,\nand events that resemble actions but are produced by your psychic\nparts, on the other; we can make out such a distinction only if you\nidentify with a principle of choice, where that is universal in form.\n(We won\u2019t reconstruct her arguments for that last claim here; Millgram\n2011 gives a summary.) Consequently, reasons for action must be\nuniversal in form, and this entails, or so Korsgaard argues, the\nsubstantive correctness of Kantian moral theory, at any rate that part\nof it which imposes a universalizability requirement on practical\nreasons: very roughly, it must be possible for you and everyone else\njointly to act on the basis of that universal-in-form principle,\nwithout assuring the frustration of the end it mentions. (For further\ndescription of Kant\u2019s account, see the section on the universal law of\nnature formula in the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.)\n \n\nWhile it\u2019s no part of the present task to defend or resist the\ncompeting views about action and practical reason under review, in\nthis case the easiest way to get Korsgaard\u2019s position into focus is by\nconsidering how it can address a handful of worries, and the first of\nthese has already given rise to a small literature. Allow for the\nmoment that actions, understood as Korsgaard proposes, involve\nconstitutive standards. Still, why must we produce actions?\nThe point that anything you do will be an action is likely to be\ngranted only on the thinnest and most minimal reading of what an\naction is; but we have just seen Korsgaard distinguishing between more\nminimal \u2018acts\u2019 and more ambitiously structured\n\u2018actions\u2019. Actions are constituted by acts together with\ntheir ends; why can\u2019t you instead act aimlessly, like the characters\nin Richard Linklater\u2019s Slacker? If the penalty is that you\nwill thereby be a defective agent, why can\u2019t the slacker shrug off\nthat complaint, perhaps with the remark that agents and actions come\nwith one set of constitutive standards, and slackers and their\nless-than-actions come with others? Why should the slacker be held to\nthe standards for agency as opposed to those of slackerhood?\nKorsgaard\u2019s argument appears to involve the sleight-of-hand\nsubstitution of an ambitious and optional notion of action for a\nminimal and more plausibly nonoptional one. (For the back and forth,\nsee Enoch 2006, Ferrero 2009, Tubert 2010, Katsafanas 2013, ch. 2.)\n\n\nKorsgaard\u2019s response comes in three laps. First, she inherits from\nWittgenstein the thought that normativity involves the possibility of\ncorrection, and she infers that if there is to be any normativity, it\nmust be possible to be in violation of a standard. Now, you can be\ncounted as in violation of a standard only if you can\u2019t simply shrug\nthe correction off. But if you can switch the kind an item counts as\nbelonging to, at will, then you can shrug off any standard\nand any correction; as Korsgaard puts it, nothing will be defective,\n\u2018everything will just be different.\u2019 (E.g., \u2018I\u2019ve\ndecided I\u2019m not an agent but a slacker, so the standards for agents\ndon\u2019t apply to me.\u2019) Thus we must take there to be kinds such\nthat you can\u2019t just shrug and say that you don\u2019t see why the\nconstitutive standards of the kind apply. This first lap of the\nargument has the look and feel of an existence proof, and of softening\nup; in particular, it doesn\u2019t purport to show that the twin concepts,\n\u2018action\u2019 and \u2018agent,\u2019 are among these\nprivileged kinds (Korsgaard 2009, sec. 2.1.8).\n\nBefore turning to the second lap of Korsgaard\u2019s response, let\u2019s\nintroduce a second worry: that the argument\u2019s attempt to exploit the\nwholeness of the agent, allegedly the essential feature of agency, is\ntaking a wrong turn. Recall Korsgaard\u2019s artifactual analogy: a chair\nis something you sit on, and so a chair is defective when you can\u2019t\nsit on it \u2013 and of course it\u2019s defective as a whole, because its\njob, as a whole chair, is to be a seat. For any constitutive\nstandard, it\u2019s the thing as a whole that\u2019s supposed to live up to the\nstandard; so what\u2019s distinctive about one standard or another is what\nthe thing does or is, and not that it does it, or is it, as a whole.\nIf, when it came to understanding chairs, you devoted your theoretical\nattention to that \u2018as a whole,\u2019 as opposed to the seating,\nsomething would clearly have gone wrong. (Imagine a theorist of chairs\narguing that the constitutive standards for being a chair must be met\nby the chair as a whole, and thus the essential feature of chairs, and\nthe key to understanding them, is that they hold themselves together.)\nWhy isn\u2019t Korsgaard\u2019s focus on the shared unity condition some sort of\nred herring? \n\nBut people, Korsgaard claims, are not just like chairs. (Actually,\nthere\u2019s a subplot in which she argues that chairs are more like people\nthan you\u2019d think, but here I\u2019m going to leave it to one side.) Chairs\ndon\u2019t dissolve into their parts when they\u2019re not seating anyone,\nwhereas an agent constitutes itself by acting, or ceases to\nbe an agent entirely. Imagine that Invasion of the Body\nSnatchers had it almost right: as in the film, pod creatures from\nouter space are eliminating us one by one, and replacing us with\npod-grown impersonators; it is just that the films have gotten the\nsize of the pods wrong. Instead of being as large as a person, each\npod is roughly the size of a peapod, and so it takes a great many pod\ncreatures working together to impersonate a single Earthling. (The\nillustration adapts the argument of Korsgaard 1996, ch. 13, to fit her\nlater use of group agency as a model for individual agency.) If a\ncolony of pod creatures is going to succeed in fooling the remaining\nEarthlings, it will have to behave as a single person, and to do that,\nthe activities of the different pod creatures must be closely\ncoordinated; after all, if the pod creatures making up the feet go off\nin one direction, and the pod creatures making up the torso go off in\na different direction, no one will be fooled. When the pod creatures\nact together, and pull off the deception, they make themselves\ninto a collective agent. (One mark of this is the first-person\nindexical, as when they whisper to each other, \u2018We\u2019re\nnow going to go off to the left\u2019; their coordination induces a\npoint of view which is not that of any particular one of them.) That\u2019s\nwhy action has to be generated by you-as-a-whole, rather than your\npsychic parts. \n\nAt this point we can see why you\u2019re not supposed to be able to opt for\nslackerdom. There are things we have to get done, in\nsomething like the way that the pod creatures have to fool\nAunt Millie into thinking they\u2019re her husband Melvin; acting is our\n\u2018plight, the simple inexorable fact of the human\ncondition\u2019 (Korsgaard 2009, sec. 1.1.1). And that means\nproducing actions, not mere acts; you act because there are things you\nhave to get done, and so when you act, you normally have an end in\nview; to act with an end in view is to perform an action. Acting is\nconstituting yourself as an agent out of your desires and other\npsychological elements, in much the way that the pod creatures\nconstitute themselves as a group agent. The necessity of agency is not\nmetaphysical but practical. (This amounts to a reply to the objection\nthat the argument for the ineluctability of action involved a sleight\nof hand: that a series of interlocking definitions, purporting to show\nthat you have no alternative to acting because nothing will\ncount as an alternative to action, could not amount to a\nreason not to live like a slacker. The objection is misconstruing\nKorsgaard\u2019s argument as turning on definitional rather than practical\nnecessities.)\n\nNow we can further see \u2013 although this is a shortcut rather than\nthe argument \u2013 why constituting oneself as an agent involves\nendorsing a principle. Suppose one of the pod creatures whispers to\nits nearby fellows, \u2018Off to the left!\u2019 If enough of them\nfollow to tilt the ersatz Uncle Melvin leftwards, was that an action,\nattributable to the group agent, or just that one pod creature\nmomentarily getting its way? Suppose a moment later a different pod\ncreature whispers \u2018Off to the right!\u2019 and ersatz Melvin\nteeters back; Aunt Millie will notice that something is amiss. To\navoid this sort of back and forth, the pod creatures collectively have\nto adopt a general principle of action \u2013 perhaps, \u2018When\nmimicking Earthlings, coordinate the movements of individual pods in\nsuch and such a way.\u2019 And in acting on that principle, they\nthereby constitute themselves into a (in this case, collective) agent.\n\n\nLet\u2019s pause to mark some of the contrasts between two of the theories\nof practical inference we have on the table. First of all, Kantian\nmaxims \u2013 the structured intentions on which the\nuniversalizability requirement is imposed \u2013 have means-end or\ncalculative structure: a maxim typically specifies not just what you\nare proposing to achieve, but how you propose to proceed. So Vogler\u2019s\nrequirement, that one come up with actions that are calculatively\nwell-formed, is compatible with Korsgaard\u2019s view. But because Vogler\nregards noncalculative reasons as optional, Korsgaard and Vogler\ndiffer over whether the universalizability of maxims is mandatory. Now\nbecause the universalizability test (the so-called CI-procedure) is to\nbe applied to one\u2019s maxims as they arise, and because you may at any\npoint consider an unprecedented maxim, it is still an open question\njust what the substantive moral theory generated by this theory of\npractical reasoning is. However, a handful of canonical dicta are\nusually thought of as constituting its core: not to lie; to adopt the\nend of helping others; to adopt the end of developing one\u2019s talents.\nSo, second, we are seeing differing conceptions of action give rise to\nstarkly differing views of the moral demands of rationality; on\nVogler\u2019s view, the solely calculative conception of action allows for\nrational agents who lie, cynically exploit others, and don\u2019t bother to\nimprove themselves. So Korsgaard\u2019s account is morally more demanding,\nand it is morally more demanding because it is more demanding about\nwhat it takes to be an action, as opposed to mere bodily or mental\ngoings on.\n\nAn important contrast between these views has to do with how the\nattributability of action is understood. Anscombian accounts construe\nthe attribution of action as having to do with the special way in\nwhich you know what you\u2019re doing \u2013 that is, without looking to\nsee, the way other people have to (R\u00f6dl 2007, ch. 2, Small 2012).\nSince you just know what you\u2019re doing, its being\nyour action takes care of itself; whereas we\u2019ve seen that in\nKorsgaard\u2019s picture, action attribution is a task each agent has to\ntake care of for himself, and arises out of meeting the\nexigencies of agency. If Kantian moral theory is to be nonoptional\n\u2013 something we can\u2019t just turn our backs on \u2013 the\nnoncalculative Kantian reasons must be nonoptional. If the\nnoncalculative reasons are what it takes to have action that is\nauthored, then the ownership of actions must be demonstrably\nnonoptional. That necessity, we have seen, is practical; that is, it\u2019s\nthe necessity of \u2018gotta go, right now!\u2019 But if that is the\nright way to reconstruct Korsgaard\u2019s position, there is a final worry\nto register, one that we are not yet able to meet, but to which we\nwill return briefly when the time comes to assess the state of play of\nthe field we are surveying. \n\nWe generally take arguments built around practical necessity to be\nresponsible to and modulated by the urgency and force of the\nnecessity. The point is once again easier to see when we are\nconsidering collective agents, so let us take up Korsgaard\u2019s political\nanalogy once more. A state that aspires to having all activity within\nits jurisdiction be its own actions is totalitarian. Democratic states\nas we are familiar with them sometimes do mobilize themselves in a way\nthat approximates this extreme: usually, in times of all-out war. (For\ninstance, during WWII, the American government imposed rationing,\nmanaged a great deal of industrial production directly, and so on.)\nBut when there is no such occasion, liberals regard totalitarianism as\nan unreasonable and immoral mode of political organization, and prefer\na state in which most activity within the state is not attributable to\nit. Markets are a familiar instance of an alternative form of\ncoordination: in a market economy, market outcomes are less than\nchoices on the part of the government, and are not directly\nattributable to the state. Recall that the argument for action\nattribution turned on the need to avoid mutually frustrating\nactivities, as when the pod creatures pull in different directions. A\nmarket economy, however, pits competitors against each other; in this\napproach, coordination of activities does not consist in forestalling\ncompetition, but in creating a regulatory framework for it. If the\nanalogy goes through, action in Korsgaard\u2019s sense is inevitable only\nto the extent that practical pressures on human agency are such as to\nmake totalitarian rather than, say, market-like approaches to the\norganization of individual activity mandatory. So the final worry is\nthat we do not yet understand the ongoing practical demands warranting\nforms of coordination that underwrite the full attributability of\naction, making the latter a demand always to be met. \n\nKorsgaard\u2019s response to this worry, which is also the final lap of her\nresponse to the initial worry, is an argument that you cannot choose\nto have a character with fault lines in it, one whose unity is\n\u2018contingent and unstable\u2019 (2009, 8.5.2). That argument is\ntoo opaque to permit an uncontroversial reconstruction, and instead I\nwill conclude the exposition of her position by describing the\nchallenge the argument is meant to meet. On Korsgaard\u2019s view, the\npractical necessity of reconstituting one\u2019s agency, from moment to\nmoment, must be a formal feature of any human personality. However, in\nour ordinary ways of thinking, practical necessities are substantive\nand contingent pressures (in our earlier example, the demands of\nwartime, as experienced by a state). When ersatz Uncle Milton is out\nof sight, it looks like the pod creatures get to relax; but\nyou are never allowed to take breaks from being an agent. The\nformal feature of agency that replaces those substantive pressures is\nthe commitment to sustain one\u2019s agency in any circumstances\nwhatsoever: \u2018our principles, moral principles, are supposed to\nhold us together in any environment, any circumstance, come what\nmay\u2019 (Korsgaard 2009, sec. 5.5.3). That commitment is supposed\nto be what makes action, rather than a more loosely organized\nalternative to it, always our plight. \n\nWe turn now to the second of the positions that takes authorship to be\nthe essential feature of action. Like Korsgaard, Velleman takes action\n\u2013 \u201chuman action par excellence,\u201d as\ncontrasted with mere activity \u2013 to be owned (Velleman 2015, 101\nand ch. 5, passim). Like Korsgaard, he takes ownership to\nrequire a definite structure in an agent, and again like her, he takes\nthe forms of practical reasoning (and what practical reasons\nsubstantively will turn out to be) to be determined by the agent\u2019s\nstructure. However, he disagrees with Korsgaard as to what the\nstructure of an agent is, as to what its practical reasons are, and\nincidentally with Korsgaard\u2019s insistence that being authored by the\nagent as a whole means not being authored by a proper part of the\nagent. Velleman\u2019s position will make more sense if we bear in mind\nthat it has more than one agenda; accordingly we will juxtapose two\ncomplementary entry points, and subsequently suggest that what looks\nlike a third and independent motivation for the view is reachable from\nthose.\n\nThe sense of ownership in play in Velleman\u2019s view is inherited\nfrom an older debate about freedom of the will and autonomy, and it\nhas to do with whether the agent can honestly dissociate himself from\nhis action or motivation (e.g., \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really me\nspeaking; it was just the alcohol\u201d). One might think that this\nsort of dissociation could be overcome by a further endorsement\n(\u201cIt really\nwas me speaking\u201d), but a familiar difficulty is that\nmany forms of endorsement merely raise the problem anew: ownership\ncannot be identified with an endorsement when the agent can dissociate\nhimself from that endorsement as well (Velleman 2015, 295\u2013296). There\nis by now an extensive literature on agency built up of rounds of this\nback-and-forth, and here is a very quick taste of it. Harry Frankfurt\nhad suggested that a desire is full-fledgedly yours when you have a\nsuitable second-order desire (a desire that the initial desire\nmotivate you to act; Frankfurt 1971); Gary Watson pointed out that\nFrankfurt\u2019s proposal merely pushed the question back to whether that\nsecond-order desire was full-fledgedly yours, and he proposed fit with\nyour values as an alternative account (Watson 1975). But the rejoinder\nwas of course to ask what makes a set of values full-fledgedly your\nown (Benson 1987), and the problem seemed to take on the shape of a\nhard-to-halt regress. (For more on this debate, see Section 2 of the\nentry on\n free will.)\n\nVelleman\u2019s way of terminating the regress is to locate a\npsychological element from which an agent cannot dissociate himself\n(2015, chs. 5, 7). Because to act is to act for reasons, an agent\ncannot dissociate himself from a desire to act for reasons \u2013\nnot, that is, without ceasing to be an agent. (Treat the content of\nthat desire as a temporary placeholder; we\u2019ll return to it\nshortly.) When such a desire contributes in the canonical manner to\nproducing an action (say, by weighing in on the side of other desires\nthat it endorses, and so tipping the decision toward that action), we\nsay that the agent produces the action (in something like the way that\nwhen your intestines digest food, we say that you are digesting the\nfood). So, to recapitulate, actions are in the first\nplace owned; an action is owned, in the relevant sense, when\nit cannot be disowned; the only anchor for an action that an agent\ncannot disown in turn, without ceasing to be an agent, is (roughly)\nthe desire to act for reasons. So what it takes to be an action is to\nbe (appropriately) produced by such a desire.\n\nAn action is what is produced by the operation of this desire, and so\nthis desire amounts to the constitutive aim of action (in something\nlike the way, Velleman thinks, that truth is the constitutive aim of\nbelief [2015, ch. 10]). It will thus serve to determine what putative\nreasons for action are (good) practical reasons (in something\nlike the way that truth determines what reasons for belief are good\nreasons). But then its content cannot quite be: to act for reasons.\nFor that would amount to a viciously circular and vacuous\nspecification of the constitutive aim of action.\n\nVelleman\u2019s alternative specification of the content is (roughly\nagain, because there is some room for variation) to know what one is\ndoing when one acts, or to make sense to oneself when one acts\n(Velleman 1989). So what counts as a (good) practical reason is that\nwhich will make one\u2019s actions intelligible to one, when one\nperforms them.  Velleman seems originally to have had something like\nthe following schema in mind: desires motivate, and so explain\nactions; so when you act on the basis of a desire, your action makes\nsense to you; so when your desire to make sense to yourself, together\nwith more occasion-specific desires, produces an action serving the\noccasion-specific desires, that is a full-fledged action on your own\npart, and not mere activity. \n\nThat default schema looks to be a version of the authorship view of\naction supporting an instrumentalist or means-end (rather than, as in\nKorsgaard\u2019s development of it, a Kantian) account of practical\nreasons. However, as Velleman\u2019s position has evolved, he has\nsuggested further patterns. Often one emotion naturally gives rise to\na sequel, as when in one familiar pop-psychology meme, denial of a\nloss is supposed to be followed by anger, which is in turn succeeded\nby bargaining, which is followed by, ultimately, acceptance. Such\nemotion cascades are the spines of narratives, and an action is\nrendered narratively intelligible as following on a step of such a\ncascade (Velleman 2009, 191, 194\u2013197). Thus, when supported by a\ndesire to be intelligible to oneself, narratives give rise to\nactions. So instrumental reasons have been supplemented by what\nVelleman construes as narrative reasons, and in later work, Velleman\nhas further proposed character for the explanatory role (2009, ch. 1):\nif you stay in character (in rather the way that actors on stage aim\nat), what you do will make sense to you, and if you are motivated by\nthe desire to make sense to yourself, what you then do will count as\nan action. (A bit of nuance: in his earlier work, Velleman took the\nrelevant desire to be a substantive motivation, on a par with other\ndesires in the cognitive mix, but he has since relaxed the\ncharacterization; we can perhaps more properly think of it as a drive,\nimplemented as a structural feature of a cognitive system, rather than\none of the items moved around inside that system; compare Velleman\n2015, pp. 169, 246.) \n\nNow, notice what one\u2019s reasons for action will turn out to be,\nformally. Once again, because reasons for action are picked out as\nwhat would explain one\u2019s actions, we cannot, on pain of circularity,\ngloss what it is to be a satisfactory explanation of an action as\nbeing a practical reason (cf. Velleman 2009, 40). So we will instead\nrely on an already available notion of explanation and, Velleman\nconcludes, it must be theoretical, i.e., logically the same\nsort of explanation that would account for any matter of fact.\nReturning to the default schema for an illustration, desires are\nreasons because they (potentially) explain action, and they explain\naction in the first place because they causally explain it.\n\n\nThere is a second and equally important motivation for the position.\nIt is almost unquestioned common ground in this field that there are\ntwo deeply different but parallel modes of rationality: theoretical\nand practical. Of these, philosophers tend to see inference about\nmatters of fact as relatively unproblematic; to a first approximation,\nit is in order when you reliably derive truths from truths. Practical\nreasoning is seen as an analogous enterprise, one which is, however,\nmuch more opaque: because it determines what to do, as opposed to what\nto believe, it is much less clear when it is being executed correctly.\nVelleman\u2019s move is to eliminate the commonly accepted distinction by\nreducing practical to theoretical rationality, and thereby reduce the\nproblem of the correctness of practical inference to problems in the\nphilosophy of explanation. \n\nWe have already seen how reasons for action are understood as\nexplanations of fact; facts explain facts; so the move further\nrequires construing decisions as factual conclusions of some kind, and\nthe live candidate is that they are predictions of one\u2019s own\nactions (Velleman 2015, ch. 3). They differ from other predictions in\nbeing self-fulfilling. (Though obviously not just any self-fulfilling\nprediction will serve: as Anscombe observed, \u2018I\u2019m going to\nbe sick\u2019 does not normally express an intention \u2013 and it\ndoesn\u2019t even if the thought of being sick is what brings on the\nnausea, and even if you can predict the nausea on the basis of what\nyou have just eaten.)  Thus, and returning to our theme, an action\nproper will be the process of such a prediction fulfilling itself. And\nso practical reasoning will be the explanation of future behavior that\nunderwrites the self-fulfilling prediction of that behavior. \n\nA third motivation, which is at first glance independent, is that of\naccounting for a thesis that has received a great deal of airplay\nrecently, namely, that when you act, you know what you\u2019re doing.\nWhen you do things in order to make sense to yourself, you end up by\nand large knowing what you\u2019re doing; thus the pervasiveness of\npractical self-knowledge is explained by invoking a desire for it. The\ndesire is claimed both to be constitutive of agency, and announced to\nbe empirically present in a normal human psychology. Now, a common\nresponse to Velleman\u2019s insistence (2009, 136\u2013138, 2015, 325)\nthat people want to understand what they\u2019re doing \u2013\nmoreover, that this is part and parcel of their desire to understand\nthe universe of which they are a part \u2013 is incredulity. A quick\nreminder or two of where those responses are coming from: academics\nteaching large introductory courses look out on seas of apathetic\nfaces that don\u2019t seem to care about understanding much at all;\noutside the classroom, those same academics are committed to research\n\u2013 which, as the saying has it, is what you\u2019re doing when\nyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. And nonacademics rub\nshoulders with New Age aficionados of mystery, with defeated\nindividuals who have made compromises in life they would rather not\nthink about... briefly, with people who quite visibly would prefer not\nto understand what they are doing, even as they do it. Now, Velleman\nadduces the cognitive dissonance and attribution literatures as\nfurther confirming evidence (Velleman 2009, 37f; Cooper 2007 is an\noverview of the former), but his readers balk here also: after all,\nthe striking feature of cognitive dissonance reduction is that\nsubjects are unaware that they exhibit it, and are perturbed when it\nis pointed out to them. And indeed Velleman notices that what he\n\u2018regard[s] as the height of rationality\u2019 others\n\u2018tend to regard... as irrational\u2019 (2009, 92 n. 4).\nBecause what Velleman takes as practical rationality in operation\nseems irrational to the agents themselves, it requires, precisely, not\nunderstanding what one is doing. \n\nHowever, the thesis that one desires practical self-knowledge was\nreached from the entry points we have already introduced, and if our\nreading of the pressures on the view is correct, the inalienable drive\ntoward self-knowledge is best construed as a cognitive\nrequirement, one derived from, first, the need to anchor\naction attribution and, second, the demand that practical rationality\nbe reduced to theoretical rationality. \n\nLet\u2019s briefly turn to a handful of apparent difficulties, as a\nway of bringing the view into clearer focus and indicating some of its\nresources. First, the question of what counts as a practical reason\ngets deferred, in Velleman\u2019s position, to a philosophical account of\ntheoretical explanation. We noticed in passing that not every\npredictive technique will deliver reasons for action. (Another\ninstance: one can often predict one\u2019s choices as the mistakes one is\nprone to make, but to treat what you understand to be a mistake as a\nreason is next door to a Moore\u2019s Paradox.)\nSo Velleman must in some\nway restrict the scope of the considerations that can figure into\none\u2019s self-fulfilling predictions. There is not just one type of\nprivileged explanation that will serve; recall that Velleman allows\nboth narrative and desire-driven folk-psychological explanations,\nperhaps along with others. The reader is directed to remarks which are\nevidently meant to address the issue of the required scope restriction\n(Velleman 2009, 31f, 42f; cf. also 2006, 7f, 14); the move doesn\u2019t\nlend itself to a terse reconstruction or assessment, and here we will\nleave the intended resolution open. \n\nNext, the picture of action and agency in question, on which you\n(always, exceptionlessly) decide what to do by asking yourself what\nsomeone like you would do, might sound both implausible and\nunattractive. (Implausible: it assimilates many substantively\ndifferent forms of decision to one of them; unattractive: agents are\nturned inward, in the manner iconized by the tradition of absorption\npainting [Fried 1988] \u2013 and it is perhaps no accident that Velleman\n2006 appropriates an image from this tradition as its cover art.) But\nVelleman has a response. True enough, if you were constantly busied\nwith and focused on understanding yourself, something would have gone\nwrong; but practical reasoning is itself a sporadic activity.\nPractical rationality is, as he puts it in a vivid metaphor, in the\npassenger rather than the driver\u2019s seat (Velleman 2015, ch. 13). Most\nof the time, you\u2019re on autopilot; on his supervisory conception of\npractical reasoning, as long as you know what\u2019s going on, the\nsupervisor does not need to intervene. Evidently, this solution has a\ncost, that of attenuating the connection between action and its\nconstitutive motivation; Velleman\u2019s response to the problem is recent,\nand it\u2019s unclear what we should expect in the way of downstream\nadjustments to the earlier position. Nonetheless, this is a dramatic\nmove, on a par with the decision to assimilate practical to\ntheoretical reasoning, and it merits careful attention. (He has two\nsecondary responses to the problem, which the interested reader can\nfind at Velleman 2009, 23f and 27f.) \n\nThird, there might look to be a pair of related circularities hidden\nin Velleman\u2019s account. The presumption that desires or more generally\nmotivations explain action is plausibly a legacy of a theory of\npractical rationality on which desires are reasons for action\n\u2013 and therefore, it is concluded, their causes. (As Quinn 1994,\n236\u2013239, points out, if desires are thought of as brute causes,\ndesire-driven behavior looks like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,\nrather than rational action.) Similarly, the idea that a given emotion\nnaturally generates a particular successor emotion has often been\ntaken to be the result of training in narrative forms, patterns that\nmust be already culturally available. (For something like\nthis latter view, see Nussbaum 1992, ch. 12; Velleman responds at\n2009, 199 n. 15.) So theories of practical or narrative rationality\nwould come first, because they are presupposed by causal explanations\nappealing to desires or narratives (2009, 26f). Such theories would\nrender the account viciously circular, and (the objection concludes)\nare off-limits to Velleman\u2019s project. \n\nVelleman has an answer waiting in the wings, however. (Bear in mind that here\nwe are connecting a few of the dots in a way that hasn\u2019t been\nspelled out before.) Velleman, like other theorists we have surveyed,\nhas a finish line in moral theory, a position he calls \u2018kinda\nKantian\u2019: because our lives are pervaded by the motivation to\nunderstand ourselves, over time that motivation, even if it is not\nvery strong, is likely to have deep effects; specifically, by way of\nmaking ourselves easier to understand, we will simplify our typology\nof persons, removing asymmetries in the social roles that we occupy,\nand gradually come to be agents for whom Kantian moral theory\nis a pretty decent fit. That treatment can serve as a model for\nunderstanding the psychological processes to which Velleman appeals,\nand render the circularities we were floating no longer vicious:\nperhaps we have gradually come to be agents of whom belief-desire\npsychology is true, and in whom one particular emotion naturally\nfollows on another, because conforming to these simple-minded theories\nsimplified our personal and social lives, making it easier for us to\nunderstand ourselves. In that case, the causal factors these views\ninvoke are now elements of straightforwardly causal explanations; it\nno longer matters how they got that way. \n\nRecapping, on one authorship view of action, an action is a prediction\nbeing enacted in part on the basis of a designated motivation, and\npractical reasons are the explanatory support for such predictions.\nAnd a second such view is held to support a theory on which only\nuniversalizable maxims count as practical reasons. We are also seeing\nthat authorship views of action may have strikingly different\nphilosophical motivations: in one case, to account for the bindingness\nor normativity of reasons; in the other case, to assimilate practical\nto theoretical reasoning, as well as a need to make room for a certain\nsort of first-person authority about one\u2019s will.\n\nWe mentioned at the outset that the work of theorists in this area\ndoes not usually speak to other work of the same kind. Paul Katsafanas\nis a recent exception to this generalization. Some types of\nexplanation may produce more in the way of self-knowledge than others;\nsome principles may unify an agent more deeply or robustly. But\nKatsafanas 2013, chs. 3 and 4, argues that neither Velleman nor\nKorsgaard is in a position to show that having more rather than less\nof, respectively, the former or the latter feature is a constitutive\nend of action; consequently, neither has the resources to reconstruct\nthe comparative notion we need, that of one\u2019s having more\nreason to pursue one course of action than another.\n\nWe now turn to Katsafanas\u2019s positive view. \n",
