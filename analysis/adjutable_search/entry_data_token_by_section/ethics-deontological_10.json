    "main_text": "Deontology\u2019s Relation(s) to Consequentialism Reconsidered || Making no concessions to deontology: a purely consequentialist rationality?\n5.2 Making no concessions to deontology: a purely consequentialist rationality?\n\nThe mirror image of the pure deontologist just described is the\nindirect or two-level consequentialist. For this view too seeks to\nappropriate the strengths of both deontology and consequentialism, not\nby embracing both, but by showing that an appropriately defined\nversion of one can do for both. The indirect consequentialist, of\ncourse, seeks to do this from the side of consequentialism alone.\n\nYet as many have argued (Lyons 1965; Alexander 1985), indirect\nconsequentialism collapses either into: blind and irrational\nrule-worship (\u201cwhy follow the rules when not doing so produces\nbetter consequences?\u201d); direct consequentialism (\u201cacts in\nconformity to the rules rather miraculously produce better\nconsequences in the long run\u201d); or nonpublicizability\n(\u201cordinary folks should be instructed to follow the rules but\nshould not be told of the ultimate consequentialist basis for doing\nso, lest they depart from the rules mistakenly believing better\nconsequences will result\u201d). For more information, please see the\nentry on\n rule consequentialism.\n Nor can the indirect consequentialist adequately explain why those\nwho violate the indirect consequentialist\u2019s rules have\n\u201cwronged\u201d those who might be harmed as a result, that is,\nwhy the latter have a personal complaint against the former. (This is\ntrue irrespective of whether the rule-violation produces good\nconsequences; but it is especially so when good consequences result\nfrom the rule-violation.) The bottom line is that if deontology has\nintuitive advantages over consequentialism, it is far from obvious\nwhether those advantages can be captured by moving to indirect\nconsequentialism, even if there is a version of indirect\nconsequentialism that could avoid the dire consequences problem that\nbedevils deontological theories.\n",
