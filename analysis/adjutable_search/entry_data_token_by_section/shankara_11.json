Contemplative Philosophical Methods\n\nAccording to \u015aa\u1e45kara, because the individual is nondual\nbrahman in reality, they already are what they seek to\nbe\u2014unlimited, whole, and complete. The difficulty, however, is\nthat one\u2019s felt sense of finite identity contradicts nonduality\nand engenders a seeming distance between the person and\nbrahman. Mok\u1e63a thus appears to be a future\nattainment rather than a recognition of present reality. This false\npremise entices one into action with the intent to gain or become\nbrahman, but one cannot attain anew what is already attained.\nAction is superfluous to accomplish an already accomplished fact. In\nfact, the more one attempts to gain, reach, or experience liberation\nwhile mistakenly presupposing its distance, the further it recedes\nlike the horizon. This quagmire of action is not intractable though\nbecause both bondage and liberation are just figurative\u2014no\nchange occurs in reality. The solution is purely self-knowledge, a\nradical epistemic shift in perspective by which one simultaneously\nsheds limited self-identities and recognizes their existence as\nnondual consciousness. Only this direct immediate recognition of\nnonduality defeats the error of superimposition. One becomes\nbrahman simply by knowing brahman (MuU 3.2.9).\n\u015aa\u1e45kara illustrates this concept of accomplishing the\naccomplished with the \u201ctenth man story\u201d (TaiUBh 2.1.1).\nTen children cross a river and then regroup to count each other. Each\nchild counts only nine, and they sorrowfully conclude that the missing\ntenth child must have drowned. A passerby sees their plight and\nstates, \u201cyou are the tenth!\u201d They then realize they simply\nforgot to count themselves. The tenth child was never truly lost or\ngained. (See Comans 2000; Suthren Hirst 2005; and Rambachan 1991 for\nfurther discussions of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s method).\n",
