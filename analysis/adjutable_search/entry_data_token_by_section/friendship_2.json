    "main_text": "The Nature of Friendship || Intimacy\n1.2 Intimacy\n\nThe relationship of friendship differs from other interpersonal\nrelationships, even those characterized by mutual caring, such as\nrelationships among colleagues: friendships are, intuitively,\n\u201cdeeper,\u201d more intimate relationships. The\nquestion facing any philosophical account is how that characteristic\nintimacy of friendship is to be understood.\n\nOn this point, there is considerable variation in the\nliterature\u2014so much that it raises the question whether differing\naccounts aim at elucidating the same object. For it seems as though\nwhen the analysis of intimacy is relatively weak, the aim is to\nelucidate what might be called \u201cacquaintance friendships\u201d;\nas the analysis of intimacy gets stronger, the aim seems to tend\ntowards closer friendships and even to a kind of ideal of maximally\nclose friendship. It might be asked whether one or another of these\ntypes of friendship ought to take priority in the analysis, such that,\nfor example, cases of close friendship can be understood to be an\nenhanced version of acquaintance friendship, or whether acquaintance\nfriendship should be understood as being deficient in various ways\nrelative to ideal friendship. Nonetheless, in what follows, views will\nbe presented roughly in order from weaker to stronger accounts of\nintimacy.\n\nTo begin, Thomas (1987; 1989; 1993; 2013) claims that we should\nunderstand what is here called the intimacy of friendship in terms of\nmutual self-disclosure: I tell my friends things about myself that I\nwould not dream of telling others, and I expect them to make me privy\nto intimate details of their lives. The point of such mutual\nself-disclosure, Thomas argues, is to create the \u201cbond of\ntrust\u201d essential to friendship, for through such self-disclosure\nwe simultaneously make ourselves vulnerable to each other and\nacknowledge the goodwill the other has for us. Such a bond of trust is\nwhat institutes the kind of intimacy characteristic of friendship.\n(Similar ideas can be found in Annis 1987.)\n\nCocking & Kennett (1998) caricature this as \u201cthe secrets\nview,\u201d arguing:\n\nIt is not the sharing of private information nor even of very personal\ninformation, as such, that contributes to the bonds of trust and\nintimacy between companion friends. At best it is the sharing of what\nfriends care about that is relevant here. [518]\n\n\nTheir point is that the secrets view underestimates the kind of trust\nat issue in friendship, conceiving of it largely as a matter of\ndiscretion. Given the way friendship essentially involves each caring\nabout the other\u2019s good for the other\u2019s sake and so acting\non behalf of the other\u2019s good, entering into and sustaining a\nrelationship of friendship will normally involve considerable\ntrust in your friend\u2019s goodwill towards you generally, and not\njust concerning your secrets. Moreover, friendship will normally\ninvolve trust in your friend\u2019s judgment concerning what is in\nyour best interests, for when your friend sees you harming yourself,\nshe ought, other things being equal, to intervene, and through the\nfriendship you can come to rely on her to do so. (See also Alfano,\n2016, who emphasizes not just trust but trustworthiness to make\nsimilar points.)\n\nSuch enhanced trust can lead to \u201cshared interests or enthusiasms\nor views \u2026 [or] a similar style of mind or way of thinking\nwhich makes for a high degree of empathy\u201d (Telfer 1970\u201371,\n227). Telfer finds such shared interests central to the \u201csense\nof a bond\u201d friends have, an idea similar to the\n\u201csolidarity\u201d\u2014the sharing of values and a sense of\nwhat\u2019s important\u2014that White (2001) advocates as central to\nfriendship. For trusting my friend\u2019s assessments of my good in\nthis way seemingly involves trusting not only that she understands who\nI am and that I find certain things valuable and important in\nlife but also and centrally that she understands the value of\nthese things that are so meaningful to me. That in turn seems to be\ngrounded in the empathy we have for each other\u2014the shared sense\nof what\u2019s important. So Telfer and White, in appealing to such\nshared sense of value, are offering a somewhat richer sense of the\nsort of intimacy essential to friendship than Thomas and Annis.\n\nAn important question to ask, however, is what precisely is meant by\nthe \u201csharing\u201d of a sense of value. Once again there are\nweaker and stronger versions. On the weak side, a sense of value is\nshared in the sense that a coincidence of interests and values is a\nnecessary condition of developing and sustaining a friendship; when\nthat happy coincidence dissipates, so too does the friendship. It is\npossible to read Annas\u2019s summary of Aristotle\u2019s view of\nfriendship this way (1988, 1):\n\nA friend, then, is one who (1) wishes and does good (or apparently\ngood) things to a friend, for the friend\u2019s sake, (2) wishes the\nfriend to exist and live, for his own sake, (3) spends time with his\nfriend, (4) makes the same choices as his friend and (5) finds the\nsame things pleasant and painful as his friend.\n\n\n(4) and (5) are the important claims for present purposes: making the\nsame choices as your friend, if done consistently, depends on having a\nsimilar outlook on what reasons there are so to choose, and this point\nis reinforced in (5) given Aristotle\u2019s understanding of pleasure\nand pain as evaluative and so as revealing what is (apparently) good\nand bad. The message might be that merely having coincidence in\nevaluative outlook is enough to satisfy (4) and (5).\n\nOf course, Aristotle (and Annas) would reject this reading: friends do\nnot merely have such similarities antecedent to their friendship as a\nnecessary condition of friendship. Rather, friends can influence and\nshape each other\u2019s evaluative outlook, so that the sharing of a\nsense of value is reinforced through the dynamics of their\nrelationship. One way to make sense of this is through the\nAristotelian idea that friends function as a kind of mirror of each\nother: insofar as friendship rests on similarity of character, and\ninsofar as I can have only imperfect direct knowledge about my own\ncharacter, I can best come to know myself\u2014both the strengths and\nweaknesses of my character\u2014by knowing a friend who reflects my\nqualities of character. Minor differences between friends, as when my\nfriend on occasion makes a choice I would not have made, can lead me\nto reflect on whether this difference reveals a flaw in my own\ncharacter that might need to be fixed, thereby reinforcing the\nsimilarity of my and my friend\u2019s evaluative outlooks. On this\nreading of the mirroring view, my friend plays an entirely passive\nrole: just by being himself, he enables me to come to understand my\nown character better (cf.\n Badhwar\u00a02003).[3]\n\nCocking & Kennett (1998) argue against such a mirroring view in\ntwo ways. First, they claim that this view places too much emphasis on\nsimilarity as motivating and sustaining the friendship. Friends can be\nvery different from each other, and although within a friendship there\nis a tendency for the friends to become more and more alike, this\nshould be understood as an effect of friendship, not\nsomething constitutive of it. Second, they argue that the appeal to\nthe friend\u2019s role as a mirror to explain the increasing\nsimilarity involves assigning too much passivity to the friend. Our\nfriends, they argue, play a more active role in shaping us, and the\nmirroring view fails to acknowledge this. (Cocking &\nKennett\u2019s views will be discussed further below. Lynch (2005)\nprovides further criticisms of the mirroring view, arguing that the\ndifferences between friends can be central and important to their\nfriendship.)\n\nIn an interesting twist on standard accounts of the sense in which\n(according to Aristotle, at least) a friend is a mirror, Millgram\n(1987) claims that in mirroring my friend I am causally responsible\nfor my friend coming to have and sustain the virtues he has.\nConsequently, I am in a sense my friend\u2019s\n\u201cprocreator,\u201d and I therefore find myself actualized in my\nfriend. For this reason, Millgram claims, I come to love my friend in\nthe same way I love myself, and this explains (a) Aristotle\u2019s\notherwise puzzling claim that a friend is \u201canother self,\u201d\n(b) why it is that friends are not fungible, given my role as\nprocreator only of this particular person, and (c) why friendships of\npleasure and utility, which do not involve such procreation, fail to\nbe genuine friendships. (For more on the problem of fungibility, see\n Section 2.1.)\n However, in offering this account, Millgram may seem to confound my\nbeing causally necessary for my friend\u2019s virtues with\nmy being responsible for those virtues\u2014to confound my\npassive role as a mirror with that of a \u201cprocreator,\u201d a\nseemingly active role. Millgram\u2019s understanding of mirroring\ndoes not, therefore, escape Cocking & Kennett\u2019s criticism of\nmirroring views as assigning too much passivity to the friend as\nmirror.\n\nFriedman (1989) offers another way to make sense of the influence my\nfriend has on my sense of value by appealing to the notion of\nbestowal. According to Friedman, the intimacy of friendship takes the\nform of a commitment friends have to each other as unique persons, a\ncommitment in which the\n\nfriend\u2019s successes become occasions for joy; her judgments may\nprovoke reflection or even deference; her behavior may encourage\nemulation; and the causes which she champions may inspire devotion\n\u2026. One\u2019s behavior toward the friend takes its\nappropriateness, at least in part, from her goals and\naspirations, her needs, her character\u2014all of\nwhich one feels prima facie invited to acknowledge as\nworthwhile just because they are hers. [4]\n\n\nAs noted in the 3rd paragraph of\n Section 1.1,\n Friedman thinks my commitment to my friend cannot be grounded in\nappraisals of her, and so my acknowledgment of the worth of her goals,\netc., is a matter of my bestowing value on these: her ends become\nvaluable to me, and so suitable for motivating my actions, \u201cjust\nbecause they are hers.\u201d That is, such a commitment involves\ntaking my friend seriously, where this means something like finding\nher values, interests, reasons, etc. provide me with pro\ntanto reasons for me to value and think\n similarly.[4]\n In this way, the dynamics of the friendship relation involves friends\nmutually influencing each other\u2019s sense of value, which thereby\ncomes to be shared in a way that underwrites significant intimacy.\n\nIn part, Friedman\u2019s point is that sharing an evaluative\nperspective in the way that constitutes the intimacy of friendship\ninvolves coming to adopt her values as parts of my own sense of value.\nWhiting (1991) argues that such an approach fails properly to make\nsense of the idea that I love my friend for her sake. For to\nrequire that my friend\u2019s values be my own is to blur the\ndistinction between valuing these things for her sake and valuing them\nfor my own. Moreover, Whiting (1986) argues, to understand my concern\nfor her for her sake in terms of my concern for things for my sake\nraises the question of how to understand this latter concern. However,\nWhiting thinks the latter is at least as unclear as the former, as is\nrevealed when we think about the long-term and my connection and\nresponsibility to my \u201cfuture selves.\u201d The solution, she\nclaims, is to understand the value of my ends (or yours) to be\nindependent of the fact that they are mine (or yours): these ends are\nintrinsically valuable, and that\u2019s why I should care about them,\nno matter whose ends they are. Consequently, the reason I have to care\nfor myself, including my future selves, for my sake is the\nsame as the reason I have to care about my friend for her\nsake: because I recognize the intrinsic value of the (excellent)\ncharacter\u00a0she or I have (Whiting 1991, 10; for a similar view,\nsee Keller 2000). Whiting therefore advocates what she calls an\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d conception of friendship: There are\npotentially many people exhibiting (what I would consider to be)\nexcellences of character, and these are my impersonal friends\ninsofar as they are all \u201cequally worthy of my concern\u201d;\nwhat explains but does not justify my \u201cdifferential and\napparently personal concern for only some \u2026 [is]\nlargely a function of historical and psychological accident\u201d\n(1991, 23).\n\nIt should be clear that Whiting does not merely claim that friends\nshare values only in that these values happen to coincide; if that\nwere the case, her conception of friendship would be vulnerable to the\ncharge that the friends really are not concerned for each other but\nmerely for the intrinsically valuable properties that each\nexemplifies. Rather, Whiting thinks that part of what makes my concern\nfor my friend be for her sake is my being committed to remind her of\nwhat\u2019s really valuable in life and to foster within her a\ncommitment to these values so as to prevent her from going astray.\nSuch a commitment on my part is clearly a commitment to her, and a\nrelationship characterized by such a commitment on both sides is one\nthat consistently and non-accidentally reinforces the sharing of these\nvalues.\n\nBrink (1999) criticizes Whiting\u2019s account of friendship as too\nimpersonal because it fails to understand the relationship of\nfriendship itself to be intrinsically valuable. (For similar\ncriticisms, see Jeske 1997.) In part, the complaint is the same as\nthat which Friedman (1989) offered against any conception of\nfriendship that bases that friendship on appraisals of the\nfriend\u2019s properties (cf. the 3rd paragraph of\n Section 1.1\n above): such a conception of friendship subordinates our concern for\nthe friend to our concern for the values, thereby neglecting what\nmakes friendship a distinctively personal relationship. Given\nWhiting\u2019s understanding of the sense in which friends share\nvalues in terms of their appeal to the intrinsic and impersonal worth\nof those values, it seems that she cannot make much of the rebuttal to\nFriedman offered above: that I can subordinate my concern for certain\nvalues to my concern for my friend, thereby changing my values in part\nout of concern for my friend. Nonetheless, Brink\u2019s criticism\ngoes deeper:\n\nUnless our account of love and friendship attaches intrinsic\nsignificance to the historical relationship between friends, it seems\nunable to justify concern for the friend qua friend. [1999,\n270]\n\n\nIt is only in terms of the significance of the historical\nrelationship, Brink argues, that we can make sense of the reasons for\nfriendship and for the concern and activity friendship demands as\nbeing agent-relative (and so in this way personal) rather than\nagent-neutral (or impersonal, as for\n Whiting).[5]\n\nCocking & Kennett (1998), in what might be a development of Rorty\n(1986/1993), offer an account of close friendship in part in terms of\nthe friends playing a more active role in transforming each\nother\u2019s evaluative outlook: in friendship, they claim, we are\n\u201creceptive\u201d to having our friends \u201cdirect\u201d and\n\u201cinterpret\u201d us and thereby change our interests. To be\ndirected by your friend is to allow her interests, values,\netc. to shape your own; thus, your friend may suggest that you go to\nthe opera together, and you may agree to go, even though you have no\nantecedent interest in the opera. Through his interest, enthusiasm,\nand suggestion (\u201cDidn\u2019t you just love the concluding duet\nof Act III?\u201d), you may be moved directly by him to acquire an\ninterest in opera only because he\u2019s your friend. To be\ninterpreted by your friend is to allow your understanding of\nyourself, in particular of your strengths and weaknesses, to be shaped\nby your friend\u2019s interpretations of you. Thus, your friend may\nadmire your tenacity (a trait you did not realize you had), or be\namused by your excessive concern for fairness, and you may come as a\nresult to develop a new understanding of yourself, and potentially\nchange yourself, in direct response to his interpretation of you.\nHence, Cocking & Kennett claim, \u201cthe self my friend sees is,\nat least in part, a product of the friendship\u201d (505). (Nehamas\n2010 offers a similar account of the importance of the interpretation\nof one\u2019s friends in determining who one is, though Nehamas\nemphasizes in a way that Cocking & Kennett do not that your\ninterpretation of your friend can reveal possible valuable ways to be\nthat you yourself \u201ccould never have even imagined\nbeforehand\u201d (287).)\n\nIt is a bit unclear what your role is in being thus directed and\ninterpreted by your friend. Is it a matter of merely passively\naccepting the direction and interpretation? This is suggested by\nCocking & Kennett\u2019s understanding of friendship in terms of\na\u00a0receptivity to being drawn by your friend and by their\napparent understanding of this receptivity in dispositional terms. Yet\nthis would seem to be a matter of ceding your autonomy to your friend,\nand that is surely not what they intend. Rather, it seems, we are at\nleast selective in the ways in which we allow our friends to direct\nand interpret us, and we can resist other directions and\ninterpretations. However, this raises the question of why we allow any\nsuch direction and interpretation. One answer would be because we\nrecognize the independent value of the interests of our friends, or\nthat we recognize the truth of their interpretations of us. But this\nwould not explain the role of friendship in such direction and\ninterpretation, for we might just as easily accept such direction and\ninterpretation from a mentor or possibly even a stranger. This\nshortcoming might push us to understanding our receptivity to\ndirection and interpretation not in dispositional terms but rather in\nnormative terms: other things being equal, we ought to accept\ndirection and interpretation from our friends precisely because they\nare our friends. And this might push us to a still stronger conception\nof intimacy, of the sharing of values, in terms of which we can\nunderstand why friendship grounds these norms.\n\nSuch a stronger conception of intimacy is provided in Sherman\u2019s\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s account of friends as sharing a\nlife together (Sherman 1987; see also Moore & Frederick 2017,\nwhich\u00a0argues that friends must share a life together partly\nthrough the mutual acknowledgment of their shared activity in the form\nof a joint narrative that interprets these activities as meaningful).\nAccording to Sherman\u2019s Aristotle, an important component of\nfriendship is that friends identify with each other in the sense that\nthey exhibit a \u201csingleness of mind.\u201d This includes, first,\na kind of sympathy, whereby I feel on my friend\u2019s behalf the\nsame emotions he does. Unlike similar accounts, Sherman explicitly\nincludes pride and shame as emotions I sympathetically feel on behalf\nof my friend\u2014a significant addition because of the role pride\nand shame have in constituting our sense of ourselves and even our\nidentities (Taylor 1985). In part for this reason, Sherman claims that\n\u201cthrough the sense of belonging and attachment\u201d we attain\nbecause of such sympathetic pride and shame, \u201cwe identify with\nand share their [our friends\u2019] good\u201d\n (600).[6]\n\nSecond, and more important, Sherman\u2019s Aristotle understands the\nsingleness of mind that friends have in terms of shared processes of\ndeliberation. Thus, as she summarizes a passage in Aristotle\n(1170b11\u201312):\n\ncharacter friends live together, not in the way animals do, by sharing\nthe same pasture, but \u201cby sharing in argument and\nthought.\u201d [598]\n\n\nThe point is that the friends \u201cshare\u201d a conception of\nvalues not merely in that there is significant overlap between the\nvalues of the one friend and those of the other, and not merely in\nthat this overlap is maintained through the influence that the friends\nhave on each other. Rather, the values are shared in the sense that\nthey are most fundamentally their values, at which they\njointly arrive by deliberating together.\n\n[Friends have] the project of a shared conception of\neudaimonia [i.e., of how best to live]. Through mutual\ndecisions about specific practical matters, friends begin to express\nthat shared commitment \u2026. Any happiness or disappointment that\nfollows from these actions belongs to both persons, for the decision\nto so act was joint and the responsibility is thus shared. [598]\n\n\nThe intent of this account, in which what gets shared is, we might\nsay, an identity that the friends have in common, is not to be\ndescriptively accurate of particular friendships; it is rather to\nprovide a kind of ideal that actual friendships at best only\napproximate. Such a strong notion of sharing is reminiscent of the\nunion view of (primarily erotic) love, according to which love\nconsists in the formation of some significant kind of union, a\n\u201cwe\u201d (see the entry on\n love,\n the section on\n love as union).\n Like the union view of love, this account of friendship raises\nworries about autonomy. Thus, it seems as though Sherman\u2019s\nAristotle does away with any clear distinction between the interests\nand even agency of the two friends, thereby undermining the kind of\nindependence and freedom of self-development that characterizes\nautonomy. If autonomy is a part of the individual\u2019s good, then\nSherman\u2019s Aristotle might be forced to conclude that friendship\nis to this extent bad; the conclusion might be, therefore, that we\nought to reject this strong conception of the intimacy of\nfriendship.\n\nIt is unclear from Sherman\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle whether\nthere are principled reasons to limit the extent to which we share our\nidentities with our friends; perhaps an appeal to something like\nFriedman\u2019s federation model (1998) can help resolve these\ndifficulties. Friedman\u2019s idea is that we should understand\nromantic love (but the idea could also be applied to friendship) not\nin terms of the union of the two individuals, in which their\nidentities get subsumed by that union, but rather in terms of the\nfederation of the individuals\u2014the creation of a third entity\nthat presupposes some degree of independence of the individuals that\nmake it up. Even so, much would need to be done to spell out this view\nsatisfactorily. (For more on Friedman\u2019s account, see the entry\non\n love,\n the section on\n love as union.)\n\nIn each of these accounts of the kind of intimacy and commitment that\nare characteristic of friendship, we might ask about the conditions\nunder which friendship can properly be dissolved. Thus, insofar as\nfriendship involves some such commitment, we cannot just give up on\nour friends for no reason at all; nor, it seems, should our commitment\nbe unconditional, binding on us come what may. Understanding more\nclearly when it is proper to break off a friendship, or allow it to\nlapse, may well shed light on the kind of commitment and intimacy that\nis characteristic of friendship; nonetheless, this issue gets scant\nattention in the literature.\n",
