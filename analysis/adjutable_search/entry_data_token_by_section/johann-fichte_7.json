    "main_text": "Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre || Philosophy of Religion\n4.5 Philosophy of Religion\n\nIn addition to the postulates addressed by theoretical to practical\nreason, there are also those addressed by practical reason to nature\nitself. The latter is the domain of the transcendental philosophy of\nreligion, which is concerned solely with the question of the extent to\nwhich the realm of nature can be said to accommodate itself to the\naims of morality. The questions dealt with within such a philosophy of\nreligion are those concerning the nature, limits, and legitimacy of\nour belief in divine providence. The philosophy of religion, as\nconceived by Fichte, has nothing to do with the historical claims of\nrevealed religion or with particular religious traditions and\npractices. Indeed, this is precisely the distinction between\nphilosophy of religion and \u201ctheology.\u201d\n\nAs noted above, Fichte never had a chance to develop this final\nsubdivision of his Jena system, beyond the tentative foray into this\ndomain represented by his controversial essay \u201cConcerning the\nBasis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the World\u201d and the\nworks he contributed to the ensuing \u201catheism controversy.\u201d\nIn \u201cConcerning the Basis of our Belief\u201d he certainly seems\nto contend that, so far as philosophy is concerned, the realm of the\ndivine is that of this world, albeit viewed in terms of the\nrequirements of the moral law, in which case it is transformed from\nthe natural to the \u201cthe moral world order,\u201d and that no\nfurther inference to a transcendent \u201cmoral lawgiver\u201d is\ntheoretically or practically required or warranted. In this same essay\nFichte also sought to draw a sharp distinction between religion and\nphilosophy (a distinction parallel to the crucial distinction between\nthe \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nstandpoints) and to defend philosophy\u2019s right to postulate, on\npurely a priori grounds, something like a \u201cmoral world\norder.\u201d Philosophy of religion thus includes a deduction of the\npostulate that our moral actions really do make some difference in the\nworld. But this is about as far as it can go.\n\nWith respect to the existence of God, the argument of Fichte\u2019s\nessay is primarily negative, inasmuch as it explicitly denies that any\npostulate of the existence of a God independent of the moral law is\njustifiable on philosophical grounds. In the wake of the atheism\ncontroversy, Fichte returned to this subject and, in his \u201cFrom a\nPrivate Letter\u201d and in Part Three of The Vocation of\nMan, attempted to restate his position in a manner that at least\nappeared to be more compatible with the claims of theism.\n",
