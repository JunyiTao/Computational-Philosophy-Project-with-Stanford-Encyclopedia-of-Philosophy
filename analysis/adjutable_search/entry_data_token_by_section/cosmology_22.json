    "main_text": "Testing models || Criteria\n5.1 Criteria\n\nThe basic challenge in cosmology regards how to test and evaluate\ncosmological models, given our limited access to the unique universe.\nAs discussed above, current cosmological models rely in part on\nextrapolations of well-tested local physics along with novel\nproposals, such as the inflaton field. The challenge is particularly\npressing in evaluating novel claims that only have cosmological\nimplications, due to the physics horizon\n (\u00a72.4).\n Distinctions that are routinely employed in other areas of physics,\nsuch as that between laws and initial conditions, or chance and\nnecessity, are not directly applicable, due to the uniqueness of the\nuniverse.\n\nRecent debates regarding the legitimacy of different lines of research\nin cosmology reflect different responses to this challenge. One\nresponse is to retreat to hypothetico-deductivism (HD): a hypothesis\nreceives an incremental boost in confidence when one of its\nconsequences is verified (and a decrease if it is\n falsified).[58]\n Proponents of inflation argue, for example, that inflation should be\naccepted based on its successful prediction of a flat universe with a\nspecific spectrum of density perturbations. Some advocates of the\nmultiverse take its successful prediction of the value of \\(\\Lambda\\)\nas the most compelling evidence in its favor.\n\nDespite its appeal, there are well-known problems with taking HD as a\nsufficient account of how evidence supports theories (this is often\ncalled \u201cna\u00efve HD\u201d). In particular, the na\u00efve\nview lacks the resources to draw distinctions among underdetermined\nrival theories that make the same predictions (see Crupi 2013 [2016]).\nWe take it as given that scientists do draw distinctions among\ntheories that na\u00efve HD would treat as on par, as is reflected in\njudgments regarding how much a given body of evidence supports a\nparticular theory. Scientists routinely distinguish among, for\nexample, theories that may merely \u201cfit the data\u201d as\nopposed to those that accurately capture laws governing a particular\ndomain, and evaluate some successful predictions as being far more\nrevealing than others.\n\nA second response is that the challenge requires a more sophisticated\nmethodology. This may take the form of acknowledging explicitly the\ncriteria that scientists use to assess desirability of scientific\ntheories (Ellis 2007), which include considerations of explanatory\npower, consistency with other theories, and other factors, in addition\nto compatibility with the evidence. These come into conflict in\nunexpected ways in cosmology, and these different factors should be\nclearly articulated and weighed against one another. Alternatively,\none might try to show that some of these desirable features, such as\nthe ability to unify diverse phenomena, should be taken as part of\nwhat constitutes empirical\n success.[59]\n This leads to a more demanding conception of empirical success,\nexemplified by historical cases such as Perrin\u2019s argument in\nfavor of the atomic constitution of matter.\n",
