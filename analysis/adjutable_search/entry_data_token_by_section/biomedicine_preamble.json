    "main_text": "\n\nDespite the simple name, biomedicine is not simply the area of overlap\nbetween biology and medicine. It is a framework, a set of\nphilosophical commitments, a global institution woven into Western\nculture and its power dynamics, and more. Biomedicine is the umbrella\ntheoretical framework for most health science and health technology\nwork done in academic and government settings. Western medical\npractices and the surrounding healthcare infrastructure are\nprincipally biomedical. Health-related corporations are predominantly\nbiomedical in orientation (with the exception of a few homeopathic\nproducers and other scattered outliers). International medical aid\nmainly offers biomedical resources. Biomedicine, in other words, is\nthe name for how most powerful global institutions envision the\nrelations between biological sciences and medicine.\n\nThe biomedical model is in fact so commonplace that it is easy to\noverlook how philosophically weighty (and contentious) its core\ncommitments are: that health phenomena must be understood in terms of\nphysical/biochemical entities and processes, that experimental\ntechniques are the preferred means of acquiring and assessing\nhealth-related knowledge, and that human bodies are best understood as\ncomposed of a collection of subsidiary parts and processes (Krieger\n2011: 130). In addition to critiquing those core commitments,\nphilosophers have also disputed connected issues regarding the\nmeanings of health and disease, the nature of biomedical knowledge and\nexpertise, the value of reductionist thinking, the value of\nbiomedicine\u2019s global institutions, etc. Some philosophers have\nalso proposed alternative frameworks for understanding the relations\nbetween biology and medicine. Though, relatively little literature is\ndirected at biomedicine per se.\n\nThe fact that the philosophical literature is so critical is in part\nbecause \n\n biomedicine is so expansive that there is no shortage of flaws to\nidentify, and \n biomedicine is deeply embedded in the current global order, and\nhence is tied directly or indirectly to all of the goods and ills of\nthat order.\n\n\nThis entry will, as much as possible, avoid duplicating the work done\nin the thorough\n Philosophy of Medicine\n entry. That entry focuses on elucidating the work done by that branch\nof philosophy, which according to entry, has\n\n\n\ndedicated journals and professional organizations, a relatively\nwell-established canon of scholarly literature, and distinctive\nquestions and problems. (Reiss & Ankeny 2016) \n\n\nMost of the \u201cmedicine\u201d examined in \u201cphilosophy of\nbiomedicine\u201d is medicine pursued within a biomedicine framework,\nso there is much overlap. Yet, this entry will accomplish something\nother than what that entry does. This entry will review the\nphilosophical literature (and some literature in allied fields, such\nas history of medicine) that scrutinizes the biomedical framework\nitself, in whole or in part.\n",
