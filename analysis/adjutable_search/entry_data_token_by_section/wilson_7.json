    "main_text": "Philosophy of Logic\n8. Philosophy of Logic\n\nCook Wilson did not contribute to logic. His inclination was at any\nrate conservative. For example, there was for him no room even to try\nand make a case for an alternative logic, since he held the\nAristotelian principles (the principle of syllogism, the law of\nexcluded middle and the principle of contradiction) to be \u201cthose\nsimple laws or forms of thoughts to which thought must conform to be\nthought at all. Thought therefore cannot throw any doubt on them\nwithout committing suicide\u201d (ETA, 17 & SI, 626). Cook Wilson\nalso rejected new developments in symbolic logic from Boole to\nRussell. He was not as such adverse to the \u201csymbolization of\nforms of statements\u201d: when criticizing Boole\u2019s he alluded\nto \u201can improved calculus of [his] own\u201d (SI, 638), which he\ncalled \u201cfractional method\u201d (SI, 662). But he did not\npublish it and all we have is the beginnings of an outline (SI,\n192\u2013210). His main objection to Boole\u2014a common one at the\ntime\u2014was to the algebraist\u2019s use of equations, perceived\nas an intrusion of mathematics in logic (SI, 635\u2013636). (See the\nwhole chapter (SI, 635\u2013662).) And the little he knew of\nmathematical logic, Cook Wilson ferociously opposed. He did think of\nsyllogistic as \u201ca science in the same sense as pure\nmathematics\u201d (SI, 437), but he was opposed to the very idea of\nlogical foundations for mathematics because he believed that logical\ninferences are exhausted by syllogistic and, \u201cmathematical\ninference as such is not syllogistic\u201d (SI, xcvi). This\nis a misunderstanding, common at the time, of the expressive power of\nquantification theory as developed among others by Gottlob Frege and\nC. S. Peirce, of which he was clearly insufficiently cognizant, if not\nplainly ignorant.\n\nCook Wilson used his interpretation of Plato\u2019s doctrine of Idea\nnumbers as\n\u1f00\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af as a basis for an attack\non Russell and the logicist definition of numbers, Plato\u2019s\ndoctrine being understood (see section 2) as entailing that there\ncannot be a universal of the members of the ordered series of\nuniversals: 1-ness, 2-ness, 3-ness, etc. because they do not share an\n\u2018intrinsic character\u2019. Confusing this series with that of\nthe natural numbers, he concluded that the logicist definition in\nterms of classes of classes, e.g., of the number 5 as the class of all\nclasses equinumerous with a given quintuplet, is \u201ca mere\nfantastic chimera\u201d (SI, 352). In line with the argument about\nputting the universal \u2018triangularity\u2019 in the subject\nposition (previous section), Cook Wilson reasoned for the case of\nnatural numbers that there would be an alleged \u2018universal of\nnumberness\u2019 and that this would lead straight to a\ncontradiction: since all particulars of a universal are said to\npossess its quality, a group of 5 as a particular of\n\u20185-ness\u2019 would thus possess the \u2018universal of\nnumberness\u2019, thus contradicting his claim that a particular\ncannot be a universal (SI, 353). \n\nBy the same token, Cook Wilson thought that this line of reasoning\nshows that Russell\u2019s paradox of the class of all classes that do\nnot contain themselves (Russell 1903, chap. X) is a \u201cmere\nfallacy of language\u201d (SI, cx). He thus argued at length (SI,\n\u00a7\u00a7 422\u201332), including in his correspondence with\nBosanquet (SI, \u00a7\u00a7 477\u2013518) that there can no more be a\n\u2018class of classes\u2019 than \u2018universalness\u2019 could\nbe a \u2018universal of universals\u2019 and that a class can no\nmore be a member of itself than \u2018universalness\u2019 could be a\nparticular of itself: the implied \u2018universal of\nuniversals\u2019 or \u2018universalness\u2019, of which universals\nwould be the particulars, would be a particular of itself, which is,\nCook Wilson claims, \u201cobviously absurd\u201d (SI, 350). For bad\nreasons such as these, Cook Wilson was contemptuous of what he called\n\u201cthe puerilities of certain paradoxical authors\u201d (SI,\n348). He even wrote to Bosanquet:\n\nI am afraid I am obliged to think that a man is conceited as well as\nsilly to think such puerilities are worthy to be put in print: and\nit\u2019s simply exasperating to think that he finds a publisher\n(where was the publisher\u2019s reader?), and that in this way such\ncontemptible stuff can even find its way into examinations. (SI, 739)\n\n\nThe problem with Cook Wilson\u2019s arguments is that they are based\non an elementary confusion between membership of a class and inclusion\nof classes (see for example SI, cx & 733\u2013734). Peter Geach\ncalled Cook Wilson \u201can execrably bad logician\u201d (Geach\n1978, 123) for committing blunders such as this. (Cook Wilson\u2019s\nclaim in a letter to Lewis Carroll that it is not possible to know\nthat \u2018Some S is P\u2019 without knowing which\nS it is which is P is another such elementary\nblunder (Carroll 1977, 376).)\n\nFortunately, Cook Wilson made a more interesting contribution to\nphilosophy of logic in his discussion of Lewis Carroll\u2019s paradox\nof inference (Carroll 1895), of which he gave the following\nformulation:\n\n\n\u2026 let the argument be A1 = B1, B1\n= C1, therefore A1 = C1. The\nrule which has to be put as the major premiss is, things being equal\nto the same thing are equal to one another. Under this we subsume\nA1 and C1 are things equal to the same thing,\nand so draw the conclusion that they are equal to one another. This is\nsyllogism I. Now syllogism I, which is of the form MP, SM, SP, in turn\nexemplifies another rule of inference which is the so-called\ndictum de omni et nullo. This must now appear as a major\npremiss. The resulting syllogism may be put variously; the following\nshort form will serve. Every inference which obey the dictum is\ncorrect; the inference of syllogism I obeys the dictum; therefore it\nis correct. This is a new syllogism (II) which again has for rule of\ninference the same dictum; hence a new syllogism (III) and so on\nin saecula saeculorum. (SI, 444)\n\n\nLeaving aside the incorrect identification of the inference rule as\nthe dictum de omni, this is recognizably the infinite regress\nin Carroll\u2019s paradox and, while Carroll did not provide one,\nCook Wilson offered the following diagnosis:\n\n\n\u2026 it is clearly a fallacy to represent the rule according to\nwhich the inference is to be drawn from premisses as one of the\npremisses themselves. We should anticipate that this must somehow\nproduce an infinite regress. (SI, 443)\n\n\nThese passages cannot be precisely dated and his correspondence with\nCarroll for the relevant period is lost, so one cannot tell who framed\nthe paradox first (Moktefi 2007, chap. V, sect. 3.1). They were both\nanticipated, however, by Bernard Bolzano, who already stated the\nparadox in his Wissenschaftslehre (1837) and provided a\nsimilar diagnosis (Bolzano 1972, \u00a7 199). (For a discussion, see\nMarion (2016).) Interestingly, Cook Wilson\u2019s diagnosis is linked\nto his own views on the apprehension of universals via their\nparticularizations (see the previous section):\n\n\nA direct refutation may, however, be given as follows. In the above\nprocedure the rule of inference is made a premiss and a particular\ninference is represented as deduced from it. But, as we have seen,\nthat its an inversion of the true order of thought. The validity of\nthe general rule of inference can only be apprehended in a particular\ninference. If we could not see the truth directly in the particular\ninference, we should never get the general rule at all. Thus it is\nimpossible to deduce the particular inference from the general rule.\n(SI, 445)\n\n\nIn Lewis Carroll\u2019s presentation of the paradox, the Tortoise\nrefuses to infer the conclusion when faced with an instance of the\nrule of Modus Ponens and Achilles suggests that one should\nthen add the rule as a further premise, but the Tortoise still refuses\nto infer, so that Achilles then suggest to add the whole formula\nresulting from adding the rule as a premise as yet a further premise\nto no avail, and so forth. It is often claimed that the\nTortoise\u2019s repeated refusals indicates that rules of inference\nare in themselves normatively inert, so that a further ingredient is\nneeded for one to infer, e.g., a \u2018\u2018rational\ninsight\u2019\u2019 (Bonjour 1998, 106\u2013107). Cook\nWilson\u2019s claim that one can only \u2018apprehend\u2019 the\nvalidity of the rule in a particular inference, thus \u2018seeing the\ntruth directly\u2019 or possessing a \u2018direct intuition\u2019\n(SI, 441), is an analogous move.\n\nThe idea that a rule of inference cannot be introduced as a premise in\nan inference in accordance with it, on pains of an infinite regress,\nwas also reprised by Ryle (Ryle 1971, vol. II, 216 & 238). But he\nused it to argue for his celebrated distinction between \u2018knowing\nhow\u2019 and \u2018knowing that\u2019: \u2018\u2018Knowing a\nrule of inference is not possessing a bit of extra information.\nKnowing a rule is knowing how. It is realised in performances which\nconform to the rule, not in theoretical citations of it.\u2019\u2019\n(Ryle 1971, vol. II, 217). However, if \u2018knowing how\u2019 is no\nlonger a state of mind (even dispositionally), then the view is no\nlonger Cook Wilson\u2019s.\n\nCook Wilson believed that all statements are\n\u2018categorical\u2019, arguing away \u2018hypothetical\njudgements\u2019 with the claim that \u201cin the hypothetical\nattitude\u201d, we apprehend \u201ca relation between two\nproblems\u201d (SI, 542\u2013543 & Joseph (1916a, 185)). In\nother words, conditionals do not express judgements but connections\nbetween questions. This view was elaborated by Ryle into his\ncontroversial stance on indicative conditionals as\n\u2018inference-tickets\u2019 in \u2018\u2018If\u2019,\n\u2018So\u2019, and \u2018Because\u2019\u2019 (Ryle 1971, vol.\nII, 234\u2013249). Ryle compared conditionals of the form \u2018If\np, then q\u2019, to \u201cbills for statements\nthat statements could fill\u201d (Ryle 1971, vol. II, 240) and he\nrejected the form \u2018If p then q, but\np, therefore q\u2019, claiming that in some way the\np in the major premise cannot for that reason be the same as\np asserted by itself. This, of course, runs afoul of\nGeach\u2019s \u2018Frege Point\u2019 (Geach 1972).\n",
