    "main_text": "Why a social minimum? || Utilitarianism\n2.1 Utilitarianism\n\nUtilitarianism is the view that actions and institutions should be\njudged on how far they produce welfare (or \u201cutility\u201d) for\npeople (or for all beings capable of experiencing welfare). In its\nclassical form, utilitarianism demands that social institutions be\narranged so as to maximize the sum total of happiness, understood as\npleasure net of pain, while in its more contemporary version it calls\nfor these institutions to maximize the sum total of\ndesire-satisfaction. In calculating this total, utilitarianism insists\non a principle of equality: each person\u2019s utility counts equally with\nthat of every other person (Mill 1861).\n\nUtilitarianism has sometimes been a major inspiration for reformers\nconcerned to establish a welfare state so as to enact a social\nminimum. It is not hard to see why. Imagine a society that leaves the\ndistribution of income to the market so that incomes are distributed\nvery unequally. Let\u2019s say we think that there is some level of income,\nY, which people typically need to lead a minimally decent life. The\ninequality in this society is such that some people have income levels\nbelow Y. However, it is possible for the government to introduce\ntax-transfer schemes that will guarantee that the poorest members of a\nsociety have reasonable access to Y. Now if the marginal utility of\nincome diminishes as people get more income, then it seems quite\nlikely that the shift from the free-market economic system to the\nsystem with the social minimum policy regime will produce a net gain\nin society\u2019s overall utility. Quite simply, the utility that the poor\ngain as a result of the shift to the social minimum system is likely\nto be greater than the utility lost by the rich in moving to this\nsystem (given the assumption of the diminishing marginal utility\nof income). Clearly, given that the utilitarian focus is on\nwelfare as the good in human life, a utilitarian conception of the\nsocial minimum will be welfarist in kind: the social minimum will be\nseen as the bundle of resources necessary to ensure a life with a\nminimally acceptable level of happiness or desire-satisfaction.\nHowever, as a matter of policy, a utilitarian might readily support\nenactment of a social minimum inspired by some version of the\ncapabilities approach because, for the reason given above, they judge\nthe social minimum policy package in question as promoting an increase\nin aggregate welfare. (For a discussion of the utilitarian rationale\nfor enactment of a social minimum, see Brandt 1981.)\n\nFrom a utilitarian point of view, however, the foregoing argument for\nthe enactment of some form of social minimum is not conclusive. There\nare arguments that can be made from within the utilitarian framework\nthat tell against enactment of a social minimum (whether conceived in\ncapabilities or welfarist terms).\n\nThe main utilitarian argument against enactment of a social minimum\nappeals to the idea of incentives. The argument begins with\nthe claim that if we make a shift from a free-market economic system\nto a system with a social minimum policy regime, we will reduce\nincentives to work, save and be entrepreneurial. The rich will\nallegedly work less hard, save less and be less entrepreneurial,\nbecause they are being more heavily taxed to pay for the social\nminimum policy regime. The poor will allegedly work less hard, save\nless, and so on, because they have a welfare safety-net to fall back\non. As a result of this dampening of incentives, it is possible that\ntotal income will be lower, or the growth of total income will be\nslower, under the economic system with the social minimum policy\nregime than under the free-market system. These economic impacts might\nresult in lower aggregate welfare in the system with the social\nminimum policy regime than in the free-market system. If so, then as\nutilitarians, we must not enact a social minimum.\n\nOf course, it is possible that these concerns about incentives and\ndamage to the economy are much exaggerated and that a utilitarian\nperspective consequently will support enacting a social minimum.\nNevertheless, it is important to see how a specifically utilitarian\nperspective does leave the justification of enacting a social minimum\ndependent on these empirical claims about how this affects the economy\n- and thereby aggregate welfare - overall.\n",
