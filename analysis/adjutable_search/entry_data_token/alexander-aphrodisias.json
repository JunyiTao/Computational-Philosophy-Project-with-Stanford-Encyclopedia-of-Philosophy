He continued the tradition of\nwriting close commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s work established in the\nfirst century BCE by Andronicus of Rhodes, the editor of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018esoteric\u2019 writings, which were designed for use in his\nschool only. This tradition reflected a gradual revival of interest in\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy, beginning in the late second century BCE, and\nhelped to reestablish Aristotle as an active presence in philosophical\ndebates in later antiquity. Aristotle\u2019s philosophy had fallen into\nneglect and disarray in the second generation after his death and\nremained in the shadow of the Stoics, Epicureans, and Academic\nskeptics throughout the Hellenistic age. Andronicus\u2019 edition of\nwhat was to become the Corpus Aristotelicum consolidated a\nrenewed interest in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, albeit in a different\nform: active research was replaced by learned elucidations of The\nPhilosopher\u2019s difficult texts. The commentaries themselves served as\nmaterial for the exposition of Aristotle\u2019s work to a restricted circle\nof advanced students. Hence each generation of teachers produced their\nown commentaries, often relying heavily on their predecessors\u2019\nwork. Thus, the \u2018scholastic\u2019 treatment of authoritative\ntexts that was to become characteristic of the Middle Ages had already\nstarted in the first century BCE. Alexander, due to his meticulous and\nphilosophically astute exegesis of a wide range of Aristotle\u2019s texts,\nin logic, physics, psychology, metaphysics and ethical topics, became\nknown as the exemplary commentator throughout later antiquity\nand the Arabic tradition. He is often referred to simply as \u2018The\nCommentator\u2019 (ho ex\u00eaget\u00eas), later sharing\nthis title with Avicenna or Averroes. Because there is little evidence\non Alexander\u2019s life and activities, his commentaries and his short\ntreatises on topics related more or less closely to Aristotelian\ndoctrine provide all the information we have about him as a\nphilosopher and a man. As these writings show, his main contemporary\nopponents were the Stoics, but there is also some evidence of a\ncontroversy with Galen. Alexander is not only regarded as the best of\nthe ancient commentators but also as the last strictly Aristotelian\none, whose aim was to present and defend Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as a\ncoherent whole, well suited to engage contemporary philosophical\ndiscussions. The later commentators were members of the Neoplatonist\nschools and were concerned to document the substantial agreement of\nPlatonic and Aristotelian thought, and to integrate Aristotle\u2019s work\ninto their Neoplatonist philosophical system. But they continued not\nonly to consult, discuss, but also to criticize, Alexander\u2019s work, a\nfact that probably accounts for its survival.\n", "toc": [{"#LifWor": "1.

Life and Works\n1.1 Date, Family, Teachers, and Influence\n\nNext to nothing is known about Alexander\u2019s origin, life circumstances,\nand career. His native city was (probably) the Aphrodisias in Caria,\nan inland city of southwestern Asia Minor. His father\u2019s name was\nHermias. The only direct information about his date and activities is\nthe dedication of his On Fate to the emperors Septimius\nSeverus and Caracalla in gratitude for his appointment to an endowed\nchair. Their co-reign lasted from 198 to 209 CE; this gives us a rough\ndate for at least one of Alexander\u2019s works. Nothing is known about his\nbackground or his education, except that his teacher was Aristoteles\nof Mytilene, rather than the more famous Aristocles of Messene, as had\nbeen conjectured by certain scholars since the 16th. century. He is\nalso said to have been a student of Sosigenes and of Herminus, the\npupil of the commentator Aspasius, the earliest commentator on\nAristotle whose work has in part survived (for information concerning\nAlexander\u2019s teachers and their philosophy, see Moraux 1984, 335\u2013425).\nHow much Alexander owed to his teachers is hard to guess, for he\nsometimes criticizes Sosigenes and Herminus extensively. But it is\nclear from the scope and depth of his work that he was a well-trained\nphilosopher with a broad range of knowledge and interests.\n\nThough the dedication to the emperors tells us that Alexander was\nappointed to a chair in philosophy, there is not sufficient evidence\nas to whether, as is often asserted, he obtained one of the four\nchairs, representing the four traditional schools, established in\nAthens by Marcus Aurelius in 176 CE. There were similar established\nchairs in several cities (on Athens see Lynch 1972, 192\u2013207;\n213\u2013216). Given the amount and scope of his writing he must have\nbeen an active teacher with a flourishing school. It is therefore\npossible that some of the short essays attributed to Alexander are\nactually the production of one of his collaborators or disciples. But\nnothing is known about any of his associates and students (cf.\nSharples 1990a). To us his work therefore represents both the heyday\nand the end of the series of commentators who explained Aristotle\nexclusively on the basis of Aristotelian texts, without commitment to\nsome other doctrine. Alexander concludes the series of these purely\n\u2018Peripatetic\u2019 commentators (beginning with Andronicus of\nRhodes in the first century BCE), who try to explain \u201cAristotle\nby Aristotle\u201d (Moraux 1942, xvi). Though later commentators,\nstarting with Porphyry, the disciple and editor of Plotinus, relied\nheavily on his works, they had a Neo-Platonist approach. Since\nPorphyry lived considerably later than Alexander (ca. 234\u2013305/10\nCE), Alexander\u2019s school may have continued to exist until it became\noutmoded by the \u2018Neo-Platonist turn\u2019. Porphyry\u2019s report\nthat Plotinus included texts by Alexander \u2018and related authors\nin his discussions\u2019 (The Life of Plotinus, 14.13) makes\nthis quite likely. Alexander\u2019s commentaries formed a central part of\nthe Arabic tradition and was heavily used by Maimonides. It thereby\ninfluenced the Latin West after the revival of Aristotelianism in the\nMiddle Ages. The scarcity of Latin translations of Alexander\u2019s\ncommentaries suggests a certain preference for the interpretation of\nthe later, Neoplatonist, commentators. If William of Moerbeke confined\nhis translations of Alexander\u2019s commentaries to those on the\nMeteorologica and the De sensu that may in part be\ndue to the availability of Boethius\u2019 commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior Analytics and the Topics, but it leaves\nunexplained why he did not translate the commentary on the\nMetaphysics. \n1.2 Works and their history\n\nAs the list of his work shows, Alexander was a prolific writer. His\nwritings comprise both commentaries (hupomn\u00eamata) on\nthe works of Aristotle and several systematic treatises of his own\n(including works on \u2018problems\u2019, consisting of series of\nessays on different Aristotelian texts and topics). Of the\ncommentaries, the following are extant:  On Prior Analytics\nI, Topics, Metaphysics, Meteorologica, and On\nSense Perception. Of the commentary on the Metaphysics\nonly the first five books are by general consent accepted as genuine;\nthe remaining nine books are attributed to the late commentator\nMichael of Ephesus (11th-12th century CE.). The commentary on the\nSophistical Refutations, ascribed to Alexander in some\nmanuscripts, is considered spurious. References by later commentators\nshow that Alexander\u2019s commentaries covered all of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy, including his physical writings (with the\nexception of the biological works). The list of his lost work is long:\nthere are references to commentaries on the Categories,\nDe interpretatione, Posterior Analytics,\nPhysics, and On the Heavens, as well as On the\nSoul and On Memory. Alexander did not write commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Ethics or Politics, nor on the\nPoetics or the Rhetoric. That he had quite some\ninterest in ethical problems, however, is witnessed by the discussions\nin his own treatises. Among the extant short systematic writings the\nfollowing are regarded as genuine: Problems and Solutions, Ethical\nProblems, On Fate, On Mixture and Increase, On the\nSoul and a Supplement to On the Soul\n(\u2018Mantissa\u2019 lit. \u2018make-weight\u2019) that not only\ncontain discussions of questions concerning psychology but also\nproblems in physics, ethics, vision and light, as well as fate and\nprovidence. The \u2018Mantissa\u2019 may not be by Alexander but a\ncompilation of notes by his students. The rest, Medical Questions,\nPhysical Problems, and On Fevers are considered\nspurious. Of his lost works some have been preserved in Arabic because\nthey were highly influential (see D\u2019Ancona & Serra 2002): On\nthe Principles of the Universe, On Providence,\nAgainst Galen on Motion, and On Specific\nDifferences. Because of Alexander\u2019s prestige and authority as an\ninterpreter of Aristotle, many of his works now lost were incorporated\nin the commentaries of his successors, whether they name him or not.\nNothing certain is known about the relative chronology of his\nwritings, but this is not an issue of much importance, since his\ncommentaries may well represent the results of many years of teaching,\nwith later insertions and additions, in a way quite similar to\nAristotle\u2019s own texts. This would explain the lack of any attempt at\nelegance and the occurrence of inconsistencies or unclear transitions\nin Alexander.\n2. Alexander as commentator\n\nIn general, Alexander goes on the assumption that Aristotelian\nphilosophy is a unified whole, providing systematically connected\nanswers to virtually all the questions of philosophy recognized in his\nown time. Where there is no single, clearly recognizable Aristotelian\npoint of view on some question, he leaves the matter undecided, citing\nseveral possibilities consistent with what Aristotle says. Sometimes\nAlexander tries to force an interpretation that does not obviously\nagree with the text, but he avoids stating that Aristotle contradicts\nhimself and, with rare exceptions, that he disagrees with him. Readers\nwill not always be convinced by his suggestions but they will often\nfind them helpful and informative where Aristotle is overly compressed\nand obscure. As a remark in his commentary on the Topics\nshows, Alexander was quite aware that his style of philosophic\ndiscussion was very different from that of the time of Aristotle\n(In top. 27,13): \u201cThis kind of speech [dialectic\nrefutation] was customary among the older philosophers, who set up\nmost of their classes in this way \u2014 not on the basis of books as\nis now done, since at the time there were not yet any books of this\nkind.\u201d As this explanation indicates, however, he seems to have\nregarded the bookishness of his own time as an advantage over the\ndialectic style rather than a disadvantage.\n\nLike the other commentaries in the ancient tradition, Alexander\u2019s\nderive from his courses of lectures (\u2018readings\u2019) on\nAristotle\u2019s works. In commenting, Alexander usually refrains from\ngiving comprehensive surveys. He generally starts with a preface on\nthe work\u2019s title, its scope and the nature of the subject matter. He\nthen takes up individual passages in rough succession by citing a line\nor two (this provides the \u2018lemma\u2019 for the ensuing\ndiscussion) and explaining what he considers as problematic (in\nexplanatory paraphrases, clarifications of expressions, or refutations\nof the views of others), often in view of what Aristotle says about\nthe issue elsewhere. This procedure clearly presupposes that the\nstudents had their own texts at hand and were sufficiently familiar\nwith Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as a whole. Alexander does not generally\ngo through the text line by line, but chooses to discuss certain\nissues while omitting others. Paraphrases are interrupted by\nclarifications of terminology, and sometimes, at crucial points, by\nnotes on divergent readings in different manuscripts and a\njustification of his own preference concerning Aristotle\u2019s original\nwords. Decisions on such philological problems are based on what makes\nbetter sense in conforming with Aristotle\u2019s intentions here or\nelsewhere. As Alexander indicates, such philological explorations were\nconsidered as part of the commentator\u2019s work (cf. On Aristotle\nMetaphysics A, 59, 1\u20139): \u201cThe first reading,\nhowever, is better; this makes it clear that the Forms are causes of\nthe essence for the other things, and the One for the Forms. Aspasius\nrelates that the former is the more ancient reading, but that it was\nlater changed by Eudorus and Euharmostus.\u201d Alexander\u2019s concern\nwith textual problems makes him a valuable source for textual\ncriticism, as can be seen from Kotwick\u2019s (2016) monograph on the text\nof Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.\n\nThough Alexander follows the Aristotelian texts quite conscientiously,\nhe often concentrates on special points and the respective passages\nwhile passing over others with brief remarks. Thus in his comments on\nthe first book of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics he devotes more\nthan half of his exegesis to the two chapters in which Aristotle\nattacks Plato\u2019s theory of Forms (Metaph. A, 6 & 9). Since\nAristotle there focuses on Plato\u2019s attempt to connect the Forms with\nnumbers, a theory that is not elaborated in the dialogues, Alexander\u2019s\ndisquisition turns out to be our most valuable source on the vexed\nquestion of Plato\u2019s Unwritten Doctrine and also on the impact of this\ndoctrine on the members of the Early Academy (see Harlfinger &\nLeszl, 1975; Fine 1993). Though on the whole Alexander adopts\nAristotle\u2019s critical stance towards Plato\u2019s separate Forms, he\nsometimes at least indicates the possibility of dissent. When, for\ninstance, Aristotle claims that Plato recognizes only two of his own\nfour causes, the formal and the material cause, Alexander refers to\nthe demiurge\u2019s activities in the Timaeus as an example for an\nefficient cause acting for the sake of a final cause. But then he adds\na justification to explain why Aristotle acknowledges neither of the\ntwo causes in his report on Plato (59,28\u201360,2): \u201cThe\nreason is either because Plato did not mention either of these in what\nhe said about the causes, as Aristotle has shown in his treatise\nOn the Good; or because he did not make them causes of the\nthings involved in generation and destruction, and did not even\nformulate any complete theory about them.\u201d\n\nThere is not room here to discuss each of Alexander\u2019s commentaries\nindividually. Some remarks on his treatment of Aristotle\u2019s logic in\nhis commentary on Prior Analytics I can serve the purpose of\na general survey (cf. the Introduction in trsl. Barnes et al. 1991).\nAs his explanations show, Alexander was fully familiar with the\ndevelopment of logic after Aristotle, under Theophrastus and the\nStoics. On the whole, he presents the Aristotelian kind of logic as\nthe obviously right one, treating the Stoic approach as wrong-headed.\nWhen he confronts problems in Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic he sometimes\nexpresses bafflement, and indicates the difficulties or even\ninconsistencies he sees in the text. But he usually tries to smooth\nthem over or offers an alleged Aristotelian solution. In any case he\navoids, if at all possible, openly criticizing Aristotle or\ncontradicting him. As his analyses show, Alexander was not an original\nlogician with innovative ideas of his own, as was his contemporary,\nGalen. He does not always get Aristotle right and sometimes blunders\nin his exegesis. In addition, his style is uninviting. If Aristotle is\nhard to comprehend on account of his clipped and elliptic style,\nAlexander is often hard to follow because of his long and tortuous\nperiods. In the past this has made his commentary on the Prior\nAnalytics inaccessible to all but experts. The English\ntranslations try to make up for these deficiencies by cutting up long\nperiods into shorter sentences. This will greatly enhance the\nusefulness of Alexander\u2019s reconstruction and assessment of those\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s logic that are still a matter of controversy\nnowadays.\n\nThe idea that discrepancies in Aristotle\u2019s texts are due to the\ndevelopment of his philosophy was as alien to Alexander as it was to\nall other thinkers in antiquity. Instead, he treats Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy as a unitary whole and tries to systematize it by forging\ntogether different trains of thought, and smoothing over\ninconsistencies. Thereby he contributed to the emergence of what was\nto become the canonical \u2018Aristotelianism\u2019 that was\nattacked in early modern times as a severe obstacle to new ideas and\nscientific development. Though Alexander indicates that he was aware\nof changes at particular points (he regarded the Categories\nas Aristotle\u2019s earliest work and notes that it does not yet observe\nthe systematic distinction between genus and species), he does not\nconsider the possibility that there were different phases with\nsubstantial changes in the Master\u2019s work. If such conservatism\nsurprises us in view of the fact that Alexander\u2019s own work shows\ntraces of revisions and improvement, we must keep in mind that in the\neyes of \u2018The Commentator\u2019 Aristotle was an authority quite\noutside the common order. The doctrine of the Master was not the\nproduct of an ordinary human mind, subject to trial and error, but a\nmagisterial achievement in a class of its own.\n3. Alexander as philosopher\n\nAs a philosopher, Alexander presents in his writings an Aristotelian\npoint of view that reflects in many ways the conditions of his own\ntime, on questions that were not or not extensively discussed by\nAristotle himself. His Problems and Solutions\n(Quaestiones), in three books, are collections of short\nessays, which were apparently grouped together in different books\nalready in antiquity. As their Greek title (phusikai scholikai\naporiai kai luseis. lit. \u2018School-discussion of problems and\nsolutions on nature\u2019, cf. Sharples 1992, 3) indicates, these\nthree books address problems in natural philosophy in the broadest\nsense. The fourth collection, Problems of Ethics\n(\u00eathika probl\u00eamata) proceeds in a similar way. As\nthe lists of the essays\u2019 titles at the beginning of each book\nshow, the collections contain a hodgepodge of topics, arranged in a\nquite loose order. The intellectual level of these discussions is\nuneven and the titles of the treatises are sometimes misleading. Some\nof essays do present problems and solutions, but others contain\nexegeses of problematic passages in Aristotle\u2019s texts. There are also\nmere paraphrases or summaries of certain texts, collections of\narguments for a certain position, and sketches of larger projects that\nwere never worked out. It is unclear when and by whom these\ncollections were put together. As mentioned above, some of the essays\nmay be the work of Alexander\u2019s associates, or lecture-notes taken by\nhis students. Most interesting from our point of view are those\nquestions that deal with metaphysical issues, like the relation of\nform and matter, and with the status of universals in general (see\nTweedale 1984, Sharples 2005, and Sirkel 2011). Of particular interest\nare also those discussions in book II that are concerned with certain\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s psychology, because Alexander\u2019s commentary on\nthe De anima is lost; they supplement his treatise On the\nSoul. Of special interest here is his work that has been dubbed\n\u2018De anima libri Mantissa\u2019 (=\n\u2018makeweight\u2019 for his book On the Soul) by its\nfirst modern editor, I. Bruns. Of interest are also the essays on the\nnotion of providence (an important topic at Alexander\u2019s time, in part\ndue to the influence of the Stoics\u2019 focus on divine providence).\nThese essays defend the view that while there is no special care for\nindividuals, providence over the objects in the sublunary sphere is\nexercised by the movement of the heavenly bodies in the sense that\nthey preserve the continuity of the species on earth.\n\nSince Alexander did not write a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s ethics, his\nEthical Problems, despite their somewhat disorganized state,\nare of considerable interest (cf. Madigan 1987; Sharples 1990; 2001,\n2). For, apart from Aspasius\u2019 early commentary on parts of the\nNicomachean Ethics there are no extant commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s ethics before the composite commentary by various hands of\nthe Byzantine age (Michael of Ephesus in the 11th/12th c. and his\ncontemporary Eustratius, together with some material extracted from\nearlier authors, cf. Sharples 1990, 6\u20137, 95). This gap may\nsuggest that ethics had become a marginal subject in later antiquity.\nAlexander\u2019s Ethical Problems are therefore the only link\nbetween Aspasius and the medieval commentaries. Though Alexander\u2019s\ncollection of essays displays no recognizable order, it is worth\nstudying because many of the \u2018questions\u2019 address central\nissues in Aristotle\u2019s ethics. Some, for instance, are concerned with\nthe notion of pleasure as a good and pain as an evil; with pleasure as\na supplement of activity supporting its connection with happiness;\nwith the relation between virtues and vices; with virtue as a mean;\nand with the concept of the involuntary and the conditions of\nresponsibility. Alexander\u2019s discussions confirm not only his thorough\nfamiliarity with Aristotle\u2019s ethics, but also reflect the debates of\nthe Peripatetics with the Epicureans and Stoics in Hellenistic times,\nas shown especially by the terminology he uses. The Hellenistic\nbackground also explains the fact that Alexander pays special\nattention to logical and physical distinctions in connection with\nethical problems.\n\nThe best example of his procedure is Alexander\u2019s construal of an\nAristotelian conception of fate in the treatise On Fate.\nThough its long, and at times inelegant, passages do not make for easy\nreading, this is no doubt the essay that is most interesting for a\ngeneral public (cf. Sharples 1983 and 2001, 1). Not only is it the\nmost comprehensive surviving document in the centuries-long debate on\nfate, determinism, and free will that was carried on between the\nStoics, the Epicureans and the Academic Skeptics, it also contains\nsome original suggestions and points of criticism, as a comparison\nwith Cicero\u2019s On Fate would show. It is unclear whether there\nhad been a genuinely Peripatetic contribution to this debate before\nAlexander. If there was not, Alexander clearly filled a significant\ngap. Though Aristotle himself in a way touches on all important\naspects of the problem of determinism \u2014 logical, physical, and\nethical \u2014 in different works, he was not greatly concerned with\nthis issue, nor does he entertain the notion of fate\n(heimarmen\u00ea) as a rational cosmic ordering-force, as\nthe Stoics were going to introduce. In De interpretatione 9,\nhe famously proposed to solve the problem of \u2018future\ntruth\u2019 by suspending truth-values for statements in the future\ntense concerning individual contingent events. In his ethics he deals\nwith the question of whether individuals have free choice, once their\ncharacter is settled. As Aristotle sees it, there is little or no\nleeway, but he holds individuals responsible for their actions because\nthey collaborated in the acquisition of their character (EN\nIII, 1\u20135). In his physical works Aristotle limits strict\nnecessity to the motions of the stars, while allowing for a wide range\nof events in the sublunary realm that do not happen of necessity but\nonly for the most part or by chance (Phys. II, 4\u20136).\nThough he subscribes to the principle that the same causal\nconstellations have the same effects, he also allows for \u2018fresh\nstarts\u2019 in a causal series (Metaph. E 3). Given these\nvarious limitations, Aristotle had no reason to treat determinism as a\ncentral philosophical problem either in his ethics or in his physics.\nThe situation changed, however, once the Stoics had established a\nrigorously physicalist system ruled by an all-pervasive divine mind.\nIt is this radicalization of the determinist position that sharpened\nthe general consciousness of the problematic, as witnessed by the\nrelentless attacks on the Stoics by their opponents, most of all by\nthe Academic skeptics and the Epicureans, which lasted for\ncenturies.\n\nThis long-standing debate prompted Alexander to develop an\nAristotelian concept of fate by identifying it with the natural\nconstitution of things, including human nature (On Fate, ch.\n2\u20136). Since there is always the possibility that something\nhappens against the natural and normal order of things, there are\nexceptions to what is \u2018fated\u2019 and there is room for chance\nand the fortuitous. Most of the treatise is occupied not with the\ndefense of this Peripatetic position, but rather with attacks on the\nvarious aspects of the determinist position. Alexander claims to show\nwhy the Stoics\u2019 attempt (though he nowhere names them) to defend\na compabilitist position must fail. The determinists, he says, are\nneither entitled to maintain a coherent concept of luck and the\nfortuitous, nor of contingency and possibility, nor of deliberation\nand potency. The bulk of this polemical discussion concentrates on the\ndifficulties for the Stoic position by claiming that their concept of\nfate makes human deliberation superfluous and therefore imports\ndisastrous consequences for human morality and life in general (chs.\n7\u201321). Alexander also presents, albeit in a dialectical fashion\nintended to lead to the defeat of the Stoic tenets, the arguments used\nby the Stoics in their defense of contingency, chance, and human\nresponsibility. As he claims time and again, the Stoics can defend the\nuse of these terms at best in a verbal sense. In addition, their\nnotion of divine foreknowledge and prophecy turns out to be incoherent\n(chs. 22\u201335). The stringency and originality of Alexander\u2019s\ncritique cannot be discussed here (cf. Sharples 1983; Bobzien 1998).\nWhile his presentation is not free from repetition and while the order\nof the arguments leaves something to be desired, it is an interesting\ntext that displays a lively engagement with the issues and quite some\nphilosophical sophistication. He argues that truly free action\nrequires that at the time one acts, it is open to one both to do and\nnot to do what one does in fact then do. Thus Alexander originates the\nposition later known as \u2018libertarianism\u2019 in the theory of\nfree action. Alexander\u2019s construction of an Aristotelian account of\nfate and divine providence that limits them to nature and its overall\nbenign order clearly argues for a weak conception of fate; but it is\nthe only one that Alexander regards as compatible with the principles\nof Aristotelian philosophy of nature and ethics. That the concept of\nfate greatly intrigued him is confirmed by the fact that he returns to\nthe issue in his addendum (\u2018Mantissa\u2019) to the treatise\nOn the Soul and in some of his Problems (2.4.5, cf.\nSharples 1983, esp. the Introduction).\n\nThe attempt to \u2018naturalize\u2019 crucial concepts in\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy is typical of Alexander\u2019s philosophical stance\nin general. He regards universals as inseparable from particulars and\nas secondary to them, and stresses the unity of matter and form.\nSimilarly, he treats the human soul as the perishable form imposed\nupon the bodily elements to constitute a living human being. He argues\nthat the intellect develops from an embodied intellect (that is\nfocused upon the material world) to a state that eventually contains\nforms that are not embodied. He rules out personal immortality by\nidentifying the active intellect with pure form and with God, the\nUnmoved Mover (see On the Soul and Caston 2012). In his\nemphasis on a naturalist point of view he appears remarkably free from\nthe increasingly spiritualistic and mystical tendencies of his own\ntime. In the treatise On Mixture and Increase Alexander\nexpands on problems that Aristotle touched upon only briefly in On\nGeneration and Corruption I 10, but his main concern is \u2014\nas it is in his On Fate \u2014 to prove that the Stoic\nposition of a \u2018thorough\u2019 mixture of two substances cannot\nbe maintained. These treatises suggest that at the beginning of the\nthird century philosophical discussions between the traditional\nschools were still lively. We have, of course, no other evidence on\nthat issue. But there would be little point in proving the superiority\nof the Peripatetic doctrine, as he does in On Fate, to the\nemperors if the issue was by general consent regarded as obsolescent.\nIt is unlikely, therefore, that Alexander\u2019s polemics are only a kind\nof shadow-boxing against long-gone adversaries.\n\n4. Importance and Influence\n\nThere is no information concerning the impact of Alexander\u2019s teaching\nin his lifetime. But certain indications of critical attacks on his\ncontemporary Galen (129\u2013216 CE) suggest that he was engaged in\ncontroversy with other contemporaries as well. Whether his polemics\nagainst contemporary versions of Stoic doctrine were part of a\npersonal exchange or rather a bookish exercise is unclear. If\nAlexander held the chair of Peripatetic philosophy at Athens it is\nquite possible that he was in direct contact with the incumbents of\nthe other philosophical chairs there. He was, of course, not the first\ncommentator on Aristotle. But posterior exegetes certainly treated as\nexemplary his method and his standards for explaining problems and\nobscurities in Aristotle\u2019s texts. This is indicated both by explicit\nreferences in later commentators and by the unacknowledged\nexploitation of his work in some extant later commentaries on the same\ntexts. As the translations of his work into Arabic and, to a lesser\ndegree, into Latin show, he continued to be treated as a leading\nauthority and his work influenced the Aristotelian tradition\nthroughout late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in the Renaissance.\nScholars nowadays continue to make use of his commentaries, not only\nfor historical reasons but also because his suggestions are often\nworth considering in their own right. Because in recent years much\nmore attention has been paid to the philosophers in late antiquity,\nnot only to the Neo-Platonists, Alexander\u2019s work has come under\ndetailed scrutiny in various respects by specialists, as witnessed by\nan increase in publications both on general and on special aspects of\nhis exegetical and philosophical work. The accessibility of most of\nhis writings in English translations will make apparent to a more\ngeneral readership that Alexander\u2019s work is not only relevant for\nspecialists in the history of philosophy, but opens up an interesting\nage of transition in the history of philosophical and scientific\nideas.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">A.
