A paradigm-destroying natural philosopher\nfor whom \u201cthe book of nature is written in the language of\nmathematics\u201d (Galileo 1623 [2008: 179\u201383]; Crombie 1972).\nGalileo argues for the distinction in a section of The\nAssayer (1623). Having been asked to explain why he thinks it may\nbe possible that motion is the cause of heat, he produces a\nnon-technical sample of his distinctive method of answering questions\nthat arise in natural philosophy. The general method relies on\nintellect, thought experiments, hypotheses about things that are\nquantifiable, and sense perception of measurements that may testify to\ntheir reality (Crombie 1972: 72\u20134, 81\u20137; Piccolino and\nWade 2008, passim)). The argument goes as follows. We cannot\nconceive a corporeal substance without a determinate figure, size,\nposition, motion/rest, and number; nor can we imagine bodies separated\nfrom any of these attributes. Galileo calls them \u201cprimary\naffections\u201d of matter. By contrast, it is not necessary to\nconceive that a body have a color, taste, aroma, or make a sound; if\nwe lacked senses, intellect and imagination might never think of\nthem.\n\n\nThus, from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to\ninhere [these things] are nothing but empty names, rather they inhere\nonly in the sensitive body \u2026 [I]f one removes the animal, then\nall these qualities are \u2026 annihilated. (Galileo 1623 [2008:\n185])\n\n\nPrimary affections are essential to bodies; taste, smells, etc. are\ninessential to bodies and sensory faculties are essential to tastes,\nand the rest; so in the absence of sensory systems, there are no\ntastes, and the like.\n\nThe argument is elaborated by means of a thought experiment. Suppose\nyou run a hand over a marble statue and over the body of a human\nbeing. The hand does nothing but touch and move over the two bodies,\nbut when the animate body is touched, it feels sensations which vary\ndepending on where it is touched; e.g., a tickling sensation occurs\nwhen the hand makes contact with the sole of a foot or pit of an arm.\nThe argument continues: \u201cThe sensation is entirely ours and not\nat all in the hand \u2026 [I]t would be a great error\u201d to say\nthe hand has a property in addition to motion and touching, namely,\n\u201cthe power to tickle\u201d. Thr arumgent continues: a tickle\nsensation is entirely within the being who feels it; tickles plainly\nhave no reality unless they are felt; so if the sentient being is\nremoved, the tickle is nothing but an empty name; so it is possible\nthat tastes, etc. \u201chave a similar and no greater reality\u201d\n(Galileo 1623 [2008: 185\u20136]).\n",
