As noted above James Tyrrell recalled that the original\nimpetus for the writing of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding was a discussion about the principles of morality\nand revealed religion. In Book IV Chapters 17, 18, and 19 Locke deals\nwith the nature of reason, the relation of reason to faith and the\nnature of enthusiasm. Locke remarks that all sects make use of reason\nas far as they can. It is only when this fails them that they have\nrecourse to faith and claim that what is revealed is above reason. But\nhe adds:\n\n\nAnd I do not see how they can argue with anyone or even convince a\ngainsayer who uses the same plea, without setting down strict\nboundaries between faith and reason. (IV.18.2, N: 689)\n\n\nLocke then defines reason as\n\n\nthe discovery of the certainty or probability of such propositions or\ntruths, which the mind arrives at by deduction made from such ideas,\nas it has got by the use of its natural faculties; viz, by the use of\nsensation or reflection. (IV.18.2, N: 689)\n\n\nFaith, on the other hand, is assent to any proposition\n\u201c\u2026upon the credit of the proposer, as coming from God, in\nsome extraordinary way of communication\u201d. That is we have faith\nin what is disclosed by revelation and which cannot be discovered by\nreason. Locke also distinguishes between the original\nrevelation by God to some person, and traditional\nrevelation which is the original revelation\n\u201c\u2026delivered over to others in Words, and the ordinary\nways of our conveying our Conceptions one to another\u201d (IV.18.3,\nN: 690).\n\nLocke makes the point that some things could be discovered both by\nreason and by revelation\u2014God could reveal the propositions of\nEuclid\u2019s geometry, or they could be discovered by reason. In\nsuch cases there would be little use for faith. Traditional revelation\ncan never produce as much certainty as the contemplation of the\nagreement or disagreement of our own ideas. Similarly revelations\nabout matters of fact do not produce as much certainty as having the\nexperience oneself. Revelation, then, cannot contradict what we know\nto be true. If it could, it would undermine the trustworthiness of all\nof our faculties. This would be a disastrous result. Where revelation\ncomes into its own is where reason cannot reach. Where we have few or\nno ideas for reason to contradict or confirm, these are the proper\nmatters for faith.\n\n\n\u2026that Part of the Angels rebelled against GOD, and thereby lost\ntheir first happy state: and that the dead shall rise, and live again:\nThese and the like, being Beyond the Discovery of Reason, are purely\nmatters of Faith; with which Reason has nothing to do. (IV.18.8, N:\n694)\n\n\nStill, reason does have a crucial role to play in respect to\nrevelation. Locke writes:\n\n\nBecause the Mind, not being certain of the Truth of that it evidently\ndoes not know, but only yielding to the Probability that appears to\nit, is bound to give up its assent to such Testimony, which, it is\nsatisfied, comes from one who cannot err, and will not deceive. But\nyet, it still belongs to Reason, to judge of the truth of its being a\nRevelation, and of the significance of the Words, wherein it is\ndelivered. (IV.18.8, N: 694)\n\n\nSo, in respect to the crucial question of how we are to know whether a\nrevelation is genuine, we are supposed to use reason and the canons of\nprobability to judge. Locke claims that if the boundaries between\nfaith and reason are not clearly marked, then there will be no place\nfor reason in religion and one then gets all the \u201cextravagant\nOpinions and Ceremonies, that are to be found in the religions of the\nworld\u2026\u201d (IV.18.11, N: 696).\n\nShould one accept revelation without using reason to judge whether it\nis genuine revelation or not, one gets what Locke calls a third\nprinciple of assent besides reason and revelation, namely enthusiasm.\nEnthusiasm is a vain or unfounded confidence in divine favor or\ncommunication. It implies that there is no need to use reason to judge\nwhether such favor or communication is genuine or not. Clearly when\nsuch communications are not genuine they are \u201cthe ungrounded\nFancies of a Man\u2019s own Brain\u201d (IV.19.2, N: 698). This kind\nof enthusiasm was characteristic of Protestant extremists going back\nto the era of the civil war. Locke was not alone in rejecting\nenthusiasm, but he rejects it in the strongest terms. Enthusiasm\nviolates the fundamental principle by which the understanding\noperates\u2014that assent be proportioned to the evidence. To abandon\nthat fundamental principle would be catastrophic. This is a point that\nLocke also makes in The Conduct of the Understanding and\nThe Reasonableness of Christianity. Locke wants each of us to\nuse our understanding to search after truth. Of enthusiasts, those who\nwould abandon reason and claim to know on the basis of faith alone,\nLocke writes:\n\n\n\u2026he that takes away Reason to make way for Revelation, puts out\nthe Light of both, and does much what the same, as if he would\nperswade a Man to put out his eyes, the better to receive the remote\nLight of an invisible Star by a Telescope. (IV.19.4, N: 698)\n\n\nRather than engage in the tedious labor required to reason correctly\nto judge of the genuineness of their revelation, enthusiasts persuade\nthemselves that they are possessed of immediate revelation. This leads\nto \u201codd Opinions and extravagant actions\u201d that are\ncharacteristic of enthusiasm and which should warn that this is a\nwrong principle. Thus, Locke strongly rejects any attempt to make\ninward persuasion not judged by reason a legitimate principle.\n\nWe turn now to a consideration of Locke\u2019s educational works.\n",
