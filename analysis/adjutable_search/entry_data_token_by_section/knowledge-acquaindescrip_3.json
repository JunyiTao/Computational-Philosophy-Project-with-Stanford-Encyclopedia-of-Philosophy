    "main_text": "Acquaintance and Noninferential Knowledge || Awareness of Correspondence\n3.1 Awareness of Correspondence\n\nWhy is acquaintance with a fact that corresponds to one\u2019s\nthought not sufficient for justification? Consider the example\nmentioned above. I can be directly aware of there being a decagon\nin my visual field, believe that there is a decagon in my visual\nfield, and yet I might fail to be justified if I believe this not\nbecause I am unaware of there being a decagon in my visual field,\nbut because my belief was little more than a guess, or because I\nbelieve (without justification) that there are always decagons in\nmy visual field. This might suggest that the acquaintance theorist\nneed only add some condition to the effect that the subject must\nbelieve that p because she is aware of a corresponding fact.\nMost acquaintance theorists will not be entirely happy with this\nsuggestion. Acquaintance theorists are paradigm internalists about\njustification: they typically accept the internalist thesis that one\ncan be justified in believing that p only if one has a reason\nor evidence in favor of p\u2019s truth, something in virtue\nof which the truth of p is not a mere accident from his or\nher perspective; externalists deny this thesis (see the entry on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n Acquaintance theorists are therefore likely to insist that awareness\nof the fact that p cannot provide justification for believing\nthat p unless the subject is in some way also aware of the\nrelevance of that fact to the truth of p. This awareness of\nthe relevance of some fact to the truth of p might be\naccepted as part of\n the epistemic basing relation,\n and for this reason necessary for \u201cdoxastic\njustification\u201d: in order for S to be justified in\nbelieving that p on the basis of some ground or evidence\ne, S must be aware of the relevance of e to\np\u2019s truth, and believe that p directly because\nof this awareness. Alternatively, the awareness of the relevance of\nsome fact to the truth of p might be taken as a condition for\neven \u201cpropositional justification\u201d: in order for S\nto have or possess noninferential justification for believing that\np (even if S does not believe that p, or\ndoes not properly base the belief on that justification), S\nmust not only be acquainted with some fact that is relevant to the\ntruth of p, but must also be aware, in some way, of the\nrelevance of that fact to the truth of p. Moser (1989:\n141\u20135) seems to endorse a view of the former sort, while\nFumerton (1995) endorses the latter. (While the distinction between\npropositional and doxastic justification is important, to simplify\ndiscussion, we do not distinguish carefully between these below.)\n\nAccording to Fumerton, a belief that p is noninferentially\njustified if and only if the subject is acquainted with the thought\nthat p, acquainted with a corresponding fact, and acquainted\nwith the correspondence between the thought that p and that\ncorresponding fact. (Fumerton qualifies the analysis to accommodate\nfalse noninferentially justified beliefs, but let us ignore this for\nthe moment.) Suppose that I am acquainted with my having a headache,\nacquainted with the thought that I have a headache, and acquainted\nwith the correspondence between the thought that I have a headache and\nmy having a headache. When this happens, everything constitutive of\nthe thought\u2019s being true is there directly before my mind.\nEpistemically speaking, it doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\n\nBonJour\u2019s account of noninferentially justified belief similarly\nrequires not only direct awareness of some fact, but also a\n\u201cdirect recognition\u201d of the \u201cfit\u201d\nbetween that fact and the conceptual description embodied in the\nbelief (BonJour 2003: 73\u20134). Both Fumerton and BonJour thus\nrequire some sort of awareness or grasp of the correspondence between\na thought and what it is about. However, while Fumerton\u2019s\nacquaintance with correspondence is acquaintance with a fact and not a\njudgment that a proposition is true, BonJour seems to understand the\n\u201crecognition\u201d of fit or correspondence as judgmental or\npropositional\u2014something like a judgment to the effect that the\nconceptual description embodied in the belief fits or correctly\ndescribes one\u2019s experience. This naturally leads to the\nquestion, must this judgment of fit itself be justified? And if so,\nwhat justifies it? BonJour insists (2003: 65 and 193) that while the\njudgment of fit requires justification, its justification depends on\none\u2019s direct awareness of the propositional content believed and\na direct awareness of the relevant experiential feature, and that\nthere is no need for any further awareness, judgmental or otherwise.\nThis response seems problematic, however, for we now have at least one\nsort of belief or judgment, the higher-order judgment of fit itself,\nthat is noninferentially justified without there being any awareness\nor recognition that its propositional content fits the facts.\nIf a judgment of fit is required for the first-order belief,\nshouldn\u2019t the same be required for the judgment of fit itself?\nBut if it is required then we are off on a regress of judgments of\nfit, with no foundation in sight. This suggests, in line with\nFumerton\u2019s view, that if some awareness of fit or correspondence\nis required, then it must at the most fundamental level be a\nnonconceptual and nonpropositional awareness of fit or correspondence.\n\n",
