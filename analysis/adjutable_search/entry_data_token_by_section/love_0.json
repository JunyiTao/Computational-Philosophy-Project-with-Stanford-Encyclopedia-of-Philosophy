    "main_text": "Preliminary Distinctions\n1. Preliminary Distinctions\n\nIn ordinary conversations, we often say things like the following:\n\nI love chocolate (or skiing).\nI love doing philosophy (or being a father).\nI love my dog (or cat).\nI love my wife (or mother or child or friend).\n\n\nHowever, what is meant by \u2018love\u2019 differs from case to\ncase. (1) may be understood as meaning merely that I like this thing\nor activity very much. In (2) the implication is typically that I find\nengaging in a certain activity or being a certain kind of person to be\na part of my identity and so what makes my life worth living; I might\njust as well say that I value these. By contrast, (3) and (4)\nseem to indicate a mode of concern that cannot be neatly assimilated\nto anything else. Thus, we might understand the sort of love at issue\nin (4) to be, roughly, a matter of caring about another person as the\nperson she is, for her own sake. (Accordingly, (3) may be understood\nas a kind of deficient mode of the sort of love we typically reserve\nfor persons.) Philosophical accounts of love have focused primarily on\nthe sort of personal love at issue in (4); such personal love\nwill be the focus here (though see Frankfurt (1999) and Jaworska &\nWonderly (2017) for attempts to provide a more general account that\napplies to non-persons as well).\n\nEven within personal love, philosophers from the ancient Greeks on\nhave traditionally distinguished three notions that can properly be\ncalled \u201clove\u201d: eros, agape, and\nphilia. It will be useful to distinguish these three and say\nsomething about how contemporary discussions typically blur these\ndistinctions (sometimes intentionally so) or use them for other\npurposes.\n\n\u2018Eros\u2019 originally meant love in the sense of a\nkind of passionate desire for an object, typically sexual passion\n(Liddell et al., 1940). Nygren (1953a,b) describes eros as\nthe \u201c\u2018love of desire,\u2019 or acquisitive love\u201d\nand therefore as egocentric (1953b, p. 89). Soble (1989b, 1990)\nsimilarly describes eros as \u201cselfish\u201d and as a\nresponse to the merits of the beloved\u2014especially the\nbeloved\u2019s goodness or beauty. What is evident in Soble\u2019s\ndescription of eros is a shift away from the sexual: to love\nsomething in the \u201cerosic\u201d sense (to use the term Soble\ncoins) is to love it in a way that, by being responsive to its merits,\nis dependent on reasons. Such an understanding of eros is\nencouraged by Plato\u2019s discussion in the Symposium, in\nwhich Socrates understands sexual desire to be a deficient response to\nphysical beauty in particular, a response which ought to be developed\ninto a response to the beauty of a person\u2019s soul and,\nultimately, into a response to the form, Beauty.\n\nSoble\u2019s intent in understanding eros to be a\nreason-dependent sort of love is to articulate a sharp contrast with\nagape, a sort of love that does not respond to the value of\nits object. \u2018Agape\u2019 has come, primarily through\nthe Christian tradition, to mean the sort of love God has for us\npersons, as well as our love for God and, by extension, of our love\nfor each other\u2014a kind of brotherly love. In the paradigm case of\nGod\u2019s love for us, agape is \u201cspontaneous and\nunmotivated,\u201d revealing not that we merit that love but that\nGod\u2019s nature is love (Nygren 1953b, p. 85). Rather than\nresponding to antecedent value in its object, agape instead\nis supposed to create value in its object and therefore to\ninitiate our fellowship with God (pp. 87\u201388). Consequently,\nBadhwar (2003, p. 58) characterizes agape as\n\u201cindependent of the loved individual\u2019s fundamental\ncharacteristics as the particular person she is\u201d; and Soble\n(1990, p. 5) infers that agape, in contrast to eros,\nis therefore not reason dependent but is rationally\n\u201cincomprehensible,\u201d admitting at best of causal or\nhistorical\n explanations.[1]\n\nFinally, \u2018philia\u2019 originally meant a kind of\naffectionate regard or friendly feeling towards not just one\u2019s\nfriends but also possibly towards family members, business partners,\nand one\u2019s country at large (Liddell et al., 1940; Cooper, 1977).\nLike eros, philia is generally (but not universally)\nunderstood to be responsive to (good) qualities in one\u2019s\nbeloved. This similarity between eros and philia has\nled Thomas (1987) to wonder whether the only difference between\nromantic love and friendship is the sexual involvement of the\nformer\u2014and whether that is adequate to account for the real\ndifferences we experience. The distinction between eros and\nphilia becomes harder to draw with Soble\u2019s attempt to\ndiminish the importance of the sexual in eros (1990).\n\nMaintaining the distinctions among eros, agape, and\nphilia becomes even more difficult when faced with\ncontemporary theories of love (including romantic love) and\nfriendship. For, as discussed below, some theories of romantic love\nunderstand it along the lines of the agape tradition as\ncreating value in the beloved (cf.\n Section 4.2),\n and other accounts of romantic love treat sexual activity as merely\nthe expression of what otherwise looks very much like friendship.\n\nGiven the focus here on personal love, Christian conceptions\nof God\u2019s love for persons (and vice versa) will be\nomitted, and the distinction between eros and philia\nwill be blurred\u2014as it typically is in contemporary accounts.\nInstead, the focus here will be on these contemporary understandings\nof love, including romantic love, understood as an attitude\nwe take towards other\n persons.[2]\n\nIn providing an account of love, philosophical analyses must be\ncareful to distinguish love from other positive attitudes we take\ntowards persons, such as liking. Intuitively, love differs from such\nattitudes as liking in terms of its \u201cdepth,\u201d and the\nproblem is to elucidate the kind of \u201cdepth\u201d we intuitively\nfind love to have. Some analyses do this in part by providing thin\nconceptions of what liking amounts to. Thus, Singer (1991) and Brown\n(1987) understand liking to be a matter of desiring, an attitude that\nat best involves its object having only instrumental (and not\nintrinsic) value. Yet this seems inadequate: surely there are\nattitudes towards persons intermediate between having a desire with a\nperson as its object and loving the person. I can care about a person\nfor her own sake and not merely instrumentally, and yet such caring\ndoes not on its own amount to (non-deficiently) loving her, for it\nseems I can care about my dog in exactly the same way, a kind of\ncaring which is insufficiently personal for love.\n\nIt is more common to distinguish loving from liking via the intuition\nthat the \u201cdepth\u201d of love is to be explained in terms of a\nnotion of identification: to love someone is somehow to\nidentify yourself with him, whereas no such notion of\nidentification is involved in liking. As Nussbaum puts it, \u201cThe\nchoice between one potential love and another can feel, and be, like a\nchoice of a way of life, a decision to dedicate oneself to these\nvalues rather than these\u201d (1990, p. 328); liking clearly does\nnot have this sort of \u201cdepth\u201d (see also Helm 2010; Bagley\n2015). Whether love involves some kind of identification, and if so\nexactly how to understand such identification, is a central bone of\ncontention among the various analyses of love. In particular, Whiting\n(2013) argues that the appeal to a notion of identification distorts\nour understanding of the sort of motivation love can provide, for\ntaken literally it implies that love motivates through\nself-interest rather than through the\nbeloved\u2019s interests. Thus, Whiting argues, central to\nlove is the possibility that love takes the lover \u201coutside\nherself\u201d, potentially forgetting herself in being moved directly\nby the interests of the beloved. (Of course, we need not take the\nnotion of identification literally in this way: in identifying with\none\u2019s beloved, one might have a concern for one\u2019s beloved\nthat is analogous to one\u2019s concern for oneself; see\nHelm 2010.)\n\nAnother common way to distinguish love from other personal attitudes\nis in terms of a distinctive kind of evaluation, which itself can\naccount for love\u2019s \u201cdepth.\u201d Again, whether love\nessentially involves a distinctive kind of evaluation, and if so how\nto make sense of that evaluation, is hotly disputed. Closely related\nto questions of evaluation are questions of justification: can we\njustify loving or continuing to love a particular person, and if so,\nhow? For those who think the justification of love is possible, it is\ncommon to understand such justification in terms of evaluation, and\nthe answers here affect various accounts\u2019 attempts to make sense\nof the kind of constancy or commitment love seems to involve, as well\nas the sense in which love is directed at particular individuals.\n\nIn what follows, theories of love are tentatively and hesitantly\nclassified into four types: love as union, love as robust concern,\nlove as valuing, and love as an emotion. It should be clear, however,\nthat particular theories classified under one type sometimes also\ninclude, without contradiction, ideas central to other types. The\ntypes identified here overlap to some extent, and in some cases\nclassifying particular theories may involve excessive pigeonholing.\n(Such cases are noted below.) Part of the classificatory problem is\nthat many accounts of love are quasi-reductionistic, understanding\nlove in terms of notions like affection, evaluation, attachment, etc.,\nwhich themselves never get analyzed. Even when these accounts eschew\nexplicitly reductionistic language, very often little attempt is made\nto show how one such \u201caspect\u201d of love is conceptually\nconnected to others. As a result, there is no clear and obvious way to\nclassify particular theories, let alone identify what the relevant\nclasses should be.\n",
