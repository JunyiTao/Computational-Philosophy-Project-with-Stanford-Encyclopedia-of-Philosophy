Descriptive vs Normative Decision Theory\n\nWhile it was fairly immediately recognised that Allais had\ndemonstrated an empirical shortcoming of SEU, it is important to note\nthat his ambitions somewhat outstripped this achievement. He further\nsuggested that his findings also give reason to doubt the\nnormative adequacy of the theory. On his view, two types of\nconsideration can be brought to the table in the assessment of a\ntheory of rational choice. The first is a demonstration that the\ntheory deductively follows from, or lies in logical conflict with,\nvarious general principles of secure epistemic standing. The second is\na body of experimental evidence regarding \n\n\nthe conduct of persons who, one has reason in other respects\n[(\u201cthat is on criteria that are free of all reference to any\nconsideration of random choice.\u201d)] to believe, act rationally.\n(Allais 1953b:\n 34)[19]\n\n\n\nHowever, he found no adequate evidence of the first kind that could be\nmarshalled to support anything quite as strong as SEU. He rejected,\nfor instance, Marschak\u2019s (1951) \u201clong-run success\u201d\nargument for expected utility maximisation in situations of risk\n(Allais 1953b: 70\u201373). He did grant the existence of a\n\u201cconsistency\u201d requirement according to which \n\n\na man will be deemed to act rationally (a) if he pursues ends that are\nmutually consistent (i.e., not contradictory), (b) if he employs means\nthat are appropriate to these ends. (Allais 1953b: 78) \n\n\nBut, this requirement, he claimed, simply entailed that preferences\nover lotteries be weakly ordered and satisfy Stochastic Dominance.\nThis left data on choice behaviour to adjudicate on the further\ncommitments of SEU. This data, in his view, clearly supported the\nrational permissibility of violating Independence.\n\nSavage did not explicitly discuss the probative force of the\ncollective preferences of his peers in relation to Allais\u2019\ncases. He did however comment on the bearing of his own\npersonal preferences, which Allais had famously elicited from him at a\nParis symposium 1952 and which found themselves in violation of the\nrecommendations of SEU . Granting that it would have been irrational\nfor him to maintain both these preferences and a commitment to the\nnormative adequacy of his axioms, he reported that further\n\u201creflection\u201d inclined him to revise the former, judging\nthese to have been in error, on par with a logical inconsistency in\nbeliefs. This fact, he claimed, entitled him to retain his normative\ncommitments (see Savage 1952:\n 101\u2013103).[20]\n Since it is easy to surmise that Savage took his own inclinations to\nbe representative of those of the population at large, his comments\nhave been widely taken to implicitly suggest an alternative\nexperimental route to the testing of theories of rational choice. (See\nSlovic & Tversky 1974 and Jallais & Pradier 2005. This is also\nthe view of Ellsberg, who offers, in Ch. 1 of his 1961 doctoral\ndissertation, reprinted as Ellsberg 2001, a worthwhile discussion of\nthe issues of present interest, with Zappia 2016 providing a recent\nphilosophically-oriented discussion.). This procedure would involve\ndetermining, not whether certain decision makers exhibit patterns of\npreference proscribed by the theory, but whether they still exhibit\nsuch patterns after reflection on their conflict with the\ntheory\u2019s basic axioms.\n\nA number of studies set out to test the normative adequacy of SEU\nalong the proposed lines. MacCrimmon (1968) reported violations, in a\nsample of experienced business executives, of a wide range of\nconsequences of SEU, a number of which persisted after subjects were\nnotably provided with considerations both supporting and undermining\nthese principles. Those principles with respect to which offending\npreferences were later corrected included most notably Transitivity\nand Stochastic Dominance. Allais- or Ellsberg-style preferences were\nsubstantially more resilient, however, a fact confirmed in a later\nstudy by Slovic & Tversky (1974). Another type of resilience of\npreferences, not considered by Savage, was more recently investigated\nby van de Kuilen & Wakker (2006). They studied the effects of\nproviding feedback on decision outcomes on the prevalence of common\nconsequence effects in sequences of choices, finding, however, a\nsignificant reduction in SEU violations.\n\nIn spite of a long-standing tradition of bringing to bear theories of\nrational choice on various philosophical\n problems,[21]\n the issue of the potential relevance of descriptive decision theory\nto its normative counterpart does not appear to have sparked much\ninterest in the philosophical community. Allais\u2019 challenge to\nSavage has largely been ignored in the philosophical\n literature.[22]\n\n\nHaving said this, a fair amount of philosophical attention has been\ndevoted to the related issue of the connection between norms of\nreasoning and observed patterns of inference. One\ninfluential line of thought to be found there, which seems pertinent\nto Allais\u2019 claims, originates in Goodman\u2019s discussion of\nthe justification of inductive reasoning. On his view, \n\n\n[t]he task of formulating rules that define the difference between\nvalid and invalid inductive inferences is much like the task of\ndefining any term with an established usage. (Goodman 1965: 66) \n\n\nJust as semantic analyses can be endorsed on the basis of providing\ngood systematisations of a set of intuitions regarding the\napplicability of particular terms in particular situations, Goodman\nclaims, normative theories of reasoning can similarly be justified by\ntheir good fit with \u201cthe particular\u2026inferences we\nactually make and sanction\u201d (Goodman 1965: 63): no further\nconsiderations are required in order to be able to endorse a\nparticular principle as rationally binding.\n\nGoodman\u2019s discussion is a brief one and, on our reading at\nleast, leaves open a number of questions. Should we admit as relevant\nany considerations beyond observed patterns of inference, such as\nproperties of long-run convergence to the truth, and so on? To whom\ndoes \u201cwe\u201d refer to when Goodman speaks of \u201cthe\nparticular\u2026inferences we actually make and sanction\u201d?\nExperts? The human population at large? Should we be circumscribing\nthe class of relevant inferences to those judgments that one might\nwant to call \u201cconsidered\u201d? These are important matters to\nsettle. Indeed, a certain combination of answers to\nthese\u2014entailing that the justification of normative theories of\nreasoning hinges entirely on their ability to systematise\n\u201cimmediate and untutored\u201d inferential dispositions\nobserved in the general population\u2014notoriously led Cohen (1981)\nto endorse the startling claim that, since normative and descriptive\nmodels are borne of the very same data set, behavioural evidence is in\nprinciple incapable of establishing human irrationality. For further\ndiscussion of this general topic, see for instance Stich (1990: Ch.\n4), Stein (1996: Ch. 5), Stanovich (1999: Ch. 1), and Thagard\n (1982).[23]\n\n\nAlthough neither Allais nor Goodman draw the connection, a potential\njustification for the evidential relevance of experimental data in\nnormative theory building can perhaps be sought in the literature on\nthe Condorcet Jury Theorem and related\n results.[24]\n This theorem tells us that, under certain conditions, the probability\nthat a majority verdict, with regards to a particular matter, in a\ngroup of \\(n\\) minimally reliable people casting yes/no votes on a\nparticular question converges to 1 as \\(n\\) tends to infinity,\nconverging more quickly the greater the individual reliabilities.\nFurthermore, majority reliability reaches significant levels, even\ngiven very limited individual reliability, for fairly modest group\nsizes. Of course, the issue of interest does not quite fit that\nspecific model: while the expression of Allais preferences can be\narguably interpreted as a \u201cvote\u201d against the normative\nadequacy of Independence, the expression of preferences consonant with\nthis principle can hardly be interpreted as a vote in favour of\nit.\n\nFinally, while this section has focused on the issue of the bearing of\ndescriptive decision theory on its normative counterpart, it should be\nnoted that there has been some discussion of the converse direction of\ninfluence. Both Guala (2000) and Starmer (2005) have argued that the\ndevelopment of descriptive theories of choice has been guided by a\nbias towards retaining a core of principles taken to be normatively\nadequate. In the case of decision making under risk these are\nessentially the transitivity component of Weak Order and Stochastic\nDominance, which are satisfied according to the vast majority of\nnon-SEU theories that have been developed to\n date.[25]\n Starmer claims to find an argument justifying this practise in a\nwell-known paper by Friedman and Savage (1952). This line of thought,\nwhich Starmer takes issue with, proceeds from the assumption that bona\nfide principles of rationality would be evident as such to most\nsubjects and that decision makers will accordingly behave in line with\nthem.\n",
