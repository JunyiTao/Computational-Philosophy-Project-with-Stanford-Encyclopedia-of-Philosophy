    "main_text": "Preliminaries: Spacetime and Parthood\n1. Preliminaries: Spacetime and Parthood\n\nThis article focuses on the recent literature on location and\nmereology. On the history of these topics, see Marmodoro (2017), Harte\n(2002), Sorabji (1983, 1988), Pasnau (2011), and Holden (2004), as\nwell as the entries on\n ancient atomism,\n medieval mereology,\n atomism from the 17th to the 20th century,\n and\n mereology.\n\nIn keeping with the recent literature, we will focus on\n\u2018entity-to-region\u2019 location relations\u2014i.e., location\nrelations that paradigmatically hold between entities and\nregions. We will ignore location relations that hold between\nentities and nonregions. (Consider \u2018the transmitter is located\nat the top of the ridge\u2019. On its face, the top of the ridge is\nnot a region.)\n\nSince our focus is on entity-to-region location relations, we will\nwork under the following controversial but popular assumption:\n\nSubstantivalism There are such\nentities as regions.\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, we will assume that regions are spacetime\nregions, where these are thought of in accordance with the\n\u2018Block Universe\u2019 picture, as captured by the\nfollowing:\n\nEternalism The past, present, and\nfuture are all equally real.\nThe B-theory of Time No time is\npresent in any absolute, not-merely-indexical sense.\nThe Spacetime View There is just\none fundamental spatiotemporal arena: spacetime. Instants and\nintervals of time, if there are such things, are just spacetime\nregions of certain sorts. Likewise for points and regions of\nspace.\n\n\nRelatively little depends upon the Block Universe picture, however. If\none dislikes talk of spacetime, one should be able reinterpret most of\nwhat we say here in terms of regions of space without loss of\nplausibility. Further, we assume that\n\nSubregions as Parts If x\nand y are both regions, then x is a subregion of\ny if and only if x is a part of y. \n\n\nSubregions as Parts contrasts with another fairly common view\naccording to which regions are sets of points and have their\nsubregions as subsets but not as parts.\n\nMore generally, we will assume that there is just one fundamental\nparthood relation, that this relation holds univocally both between\none region and another and between (say) one material object and\nanother, and that the given relation is a two-place relation.\n\nAll of these assumptions are controversial. Some philosophers have\nexplored the view that the fundamental parthood relation is\nthree-place (Thomson 1983; Hudson 2001; Balashov 2008; Donnelly 2010;\nMcDaniel 2014; Lafrance 2015) or four-place (Gilmore 2009;\nKleinschmidt 2011). Others have argued that one fundamental parthood\nrelation holds between regions, another between material objects\n(McDaniel 2004, 2009). And some have argued that there are no\nfundamental parthood relations (or other fundamental mereological\nrelations, such as overlapping). Of these philosophers, some propose\nreductive definitions of parthood, whereas others eliminate parthood\n(Dorr 2005; Sider 2013; Cowling 2014a), though the distinction between\nreduction and elimination is sometimes blurry.\n\nNolan (2014) calls attention to a range of reductionist proposals,\nwhich can be divided into three main strategies.\n\nA first strategy, which we can call the locationist strategy,\nis to define parthood in terms of the location relation together with\nthe subregion relation (Oppenheim and Putnam 1958; Markosian 2014).\nFor example, one might say that for x to be a part of y\nis for x's exact location to be a subregion of y's exact\nlocation. To avoid circularity, friends of the locationist strategy\nshould reject Subregions as Parts, in favor of either (i) the view\nthat regions are sets of points and x is a subregion of\ny if and only if both are regions and x is a subset of\ny or (ii) the view that subregionhood is primitive and\nfundamental. An objection to (i) is that regions are concrete, whereas\nsets are abstract, not concrete; an objection to (ii) is that positing\na fundamental relation of subregionhood seems very similar to, and\nprobably no more theoretically virtuous than, positing a fundamental\nparthood relation (though see Nolan 2014: 105\u2013111). There are\ntwo main objections to the locationist strategy more generally.\n\nFirst, there is the objection from the topic-neutrality of parthood.\nThe idea here is that entities need not be located in space or\nspacetime to be parts or to have parts. For example, one might hold\nthat the word type \u2018cat\u2019 is a part of the sentence type\n\u2018the cat is on the mat\u2019, despite the fact that neither is\nlocated. According to this objection, locational subregionhood is\nunnecessary for parthood.\n\nSecond, there is the objection from interpenetration, according to\nwhich an entity x is in some cases exactly located at a\nsubregion of the exact location of an entity y despite the fact\nthat x is not a part of y. For example, two bosons (or\ntropes or\u2026) might have the same exact location without being\nparts of each other. (See Section 4 for further discussion.) If the\nobjection from interpenetration is correct, then locational\nsubregionhood is not sufficient for parthood\n\nA more radical reduction of parthood to (among other things) a\nlocation-like relation is developed in Bennett (2013), who proposes\nthat for x to be a part of y is for there to be an\nentity z such that (i) z is a parthood-slot in y\nand (ii) x occupies z. Bennett's views are discussed in\nFisher (2013), Cotnoir (2015), and Garbacz (2017).\n\nA second strategy, which we can call the monist strategy, is\navailable to supersubstantivalists (those who hold that each material\nobject is identical to a region). They can say that what it is for an\nentity x to be a part of an entity y is: (i) for\nx and y both to be material objects, i.e., both to be\namong those privileged regions that count as material objects, and\n(ii) for x to be a subregion of y. (Wake 2011 and Nolan\n2014 develop this strategy.) One virtue of the monist strategy is\nthat, unlike the locationist strategy, it does not need to invoke a\nfundamental location relation. But it is vulnerable to versions of\nmany of the same objections, including those concerning the proper\ntreatment of subregionhood, the objection from topic-neutrality of\nparthood, and the objection from interpenetration.\n\nA third strategy, which we can call the plural strategy, is\nto define parthood in terms of identity and the \u2018is one\nof\u2019 notion from plural logic (on which see\n plural quantification),\n as follows: for x to be a part of y is for x to\nbe one of some entities zz that (collectively) are identical to\ny (Bricker 2016: 270). But this strategy will be only as\nattractive as strong composition as identity, the\ncontroversial view that whenever some things xx compose a thing\ny, xx are identical to y. (See Wallace (2011a, b)\nand the essays in Cotnoir and Baxter (2014) for discussion and further\nreferences.) (A hybrid of the first and third strategies is pursued by\nMcDaniel (2014: 21), who defines a three-place parthood relation in\nterms of a three-place, region-relative identity relation and a\ntwo-place subregionhood relation.)\n\nFor a defense of the view that parthood is fundamental, see Eddon\n(2017).\n\nWe now turn to the logic of the parthood relation. (See the entry on\n mereology\n for much more detail.) Here we assume merely that parthood is\nreflexive and transitive (a \u2018preorder\u2019). In a first-order\nlanguage with identity and a primitive two-place predicate\n\u2018P(x,y)\u2019 for parthood, we can write:\n\n\nReflexivity of Parthood\n\u2200xP(x,x)\n\nEach entity is a part of itself.\nTransitivity of Parthood\n\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[[P(x,y)\n& P(y,z)] \u2192 P(x,z)]\n\nIf x is a part of y and y is a part of\nz, then x is a part of z.\n\n\nWe will also find it convenient to have predicates for overlapping,\ndisjointness, proper parthood, simplicity, complexity, gunkiness, and\nmereological coincidence. We define them as follows:\n\n(D1) \nOverlapping O(x,\ny)\n=df \u2203z[P(z,\nx) &\nP(z, y)]\n\n\u2018overlaps\u2019 means the same as\n\u2018shares a part with\u2019\n(D2) \nDisjointness D(x,\ny)\n=df \u00acO(x,\ny)\n\n\u2018x is disjoint from y\u2019\nmeans the same as \u2018x does not overlap\ny\u2019\n(D3) \nProper Parthood PP(x,\ny)\n=df P(x,\ny) & \u00acx=y\n\n\u2018x is a proper part of\ny\u2019 means the same as \u2018x is a part of but not\nidentical to y\u2019\n(D4) \nSimplicity S(x)\n=df\n\u00ac\u2203yPP(y,\nx)\n\n\u2018x is simple\u2019 (or\n\u2018x is a simple\u2019) means the same as \u2018x\ndoesn't have any proper parts\u2019\n(D5) \nComplexity C(x)\n=df\n\u00acS(x)\n\n\u2018x is complex\u2019 means the same\nas \u2018x is not simple\u2019\n(D6) \nGunkiness G(x)\n=df\n\u2200y[P(y, x)\n\u2192 C(y)]\n\n\u2018x is gunky\u2019 means the same as\n\u2018each part of x is complex\u2019\n(D7) \nCoincidence CO(x,\ny)\n=df \u2200z[O(x,\nz) \u2194\nO(y,z)]\n\n\u2018x mereologically coincides with\ny\u2019 means the same as \u2018x overlaps exactly the\nsame things as y\u2019\n\n\nFinally, if we supplement our first-order language with plural\nquantifiers and variables and the predicate\n\u2018x\u227ayy\u2019 for \u2018x is one of\nyy\u2019 (see the entry on\n plural quantification),\n we can define a fusion predicate:\n\n(D8) \nFusion F(y,\nxx)\n=df \u2200z[(z\u227axx\n\u2192\nP(z, y)) & (P(z, y) \u2192\n\u2203w(w\u227axx & O(z,\nw)))]\n\n\u2018y fuses xx\u2019 means the\nsame as \u2018each of xx is a part of y and each part\nof y overlaps at least one of xx\u2019\n\n\nWe will treat the expressions \u2018y is composed of\nxx\u2019 and \u2018y is a sum of xx\u2019 as\nsynonyms of \u2018y fuses xx\u2019.\n\nThis entry addresses questions framed in terms of modal notions. Are\nextended simples possible? Is it necessary that nothing is\nmultilocated? All talk of possibility and necessity in what follows\nshould be understood as talk of metaphysical possibility and\nmetaphysical necessity, respectively. In keeping with current\northodoxy, we assume that being metaphysically necessary (a property\nof propositions or sentences) is not to be identified with being a\nlogical truth, being an analytic truth, being a conceptual truth, or\nbeing an a priori truth. Although metaphysical necessity is\nnot identified with conceptual truth\u2014and, correlatively,\nmetaphysical possibility is not identified with\nconceivability\u2014one might still think that conceivability (or\nsomething in that vicinity) is evidence for metaphysical possibility.\nSee Chalmers (2002) for distinctions between various sorts of\nconceivability and for discussion of how each of them connects or\nfails to connect to metaphysical possibility. Also see the entry on\n the epistemology of modality.\n\nOne last preliminary. For better or worse, the recent literature on\nlocation and mereology tends to bracket considerations of vagueness\nand indeterminacy (though see Eagle 2016a) and quantum theory (though\nsee Pashby 2016). We will do the same.\n",
