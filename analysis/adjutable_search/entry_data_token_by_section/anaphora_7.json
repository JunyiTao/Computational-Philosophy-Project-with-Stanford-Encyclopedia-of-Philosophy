How Many Readings Do Donkey Sentences Have?\n\nWe have already mentioned that there is some disagreement regarding\nthe truth conditions of sentences like\n\n(26)\n Every woman who\nowns a donkey beats it.\n\n\nSome think that the truth of (26) requires every woman who owns a\ndonkey to beat every donkey she owns. As mentioned above,\nthis is called the strong reading of a donkey sentence.\nOthers think that the truth of (26) requires that every donkey owning\nwoman beats some donkey she owns. As above, this is the\nweak reading of (26). As we mentioned above, there are\nsentences that are exactly like (26) except for the descriptive\nmaterial in them that clearly seem to have (only) the weak reading.\nThe example we gave was:\n\n(54)\n Every person who\nhad a credit card paid his bill with it.\n\n\nIt seems clear that the truth of this sentence does not require every\nperson with a credit card to pay his bill with each credit card he\nhas, but merely with some credit card he has. Our comments to this\npoint have suggested that the debate with respect to (26)/(54) and\nweak vs. strong readings is over which one of the two sets of truth\nconditions (26)/(54) have. Each of the theories discussed in this\nentry only assign one of the existential or universal truth\nconditions to relative clause donkey sentences (though this may be\nmore of an artifact of the specific implementations of the theories\nthan the theories themselves).\n\nBut some think that (at least some) donkey sentences have\nboth weak and strong readings. Chierchia (1994) and Kanazawa\n(1994b) are examples. In their favor, for a given determiner, one can\nfind pairs of relative clause donkey sentences fronted by that\ndeterminer such that one has the existential truth conditions (on its\nmost natural interpretation) and the other has the universal truth\nconditions (on its most natural reading). For example, consider the\nfollowing pairs:\n\n(55)\nWeak Readings:\n  \na.\nEvery person who had a\ncredit card paid his bill with it.\nb.\n Most women who have a dime will put it in the meter. \nc.\n No man with a teenage son lets him drive the car on the weekend. \n\n(56)\nStrong Readings:\n  \na.\n Every student who\nborrowed a book from Peter eventually returned it. \nb.\n Most parents who have a teenage son allow him to go out on the\nweekend. \nc.\n No man with an umbrella leaves it home on a day like\nthis. \n\n\nElbourne, for example, explicitly addresses this issue, since his\nsemantics captures only the strong reading. He claims that while this\nmay present a problem for his semantics, it is not a problem for\nNP-deletion theory more generally, since replacing the pronoun in a\ntypical weak reading example with a minimal definite description also\nyields a weak reading, e.g.:\n\n(57)\n Everyone\nwho has a dime put the dime in the meter. (Elbourne 2005:\n84)\n\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t present an account of how this reading might\nbe captured.\n\nThese examples and others suggest that whether a given relative clause\ndonkey sentence appears to favor the strong reading or weak reading is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including the monotonicity\nproperties of the determiner on the wide scope quantifier, the lexical\nsemantics of the predicates occurring in the sentence, and general\nbackground assumptions concerning the situations in which we are to\nconsider the truth or falsity of the sentences. However, it is very\nhard to find significant generalizations regarding under what\nconditions a given reading is\n favored.[32]\n Further, it is very hard to find sentences that clearly allow both a\nstrong and a weak reading.[33] This makes the view that the sentences\nactually possess both readings as a matter of their semantics at least\nsomewhat suspect. If they really do possess both readings, why is it\nso hard to find sentences that clearly allow both readings? And\nfinally, relative clause donkey sentences fronted by the determiner\n\u201csome\u201d seem always to only have the existential truth\nconditions:\n\n(58)\n Some\nwomen who own a donkey beat it.\n\n\nObviously, the facts here are quite complicated.\n\nBrasoveanu (2006, 2007, 2008) points out that there are also\nmixed readings of donkey sentences, such as:\n\n(59)\n Every\nperson who buys a book on amazon.com and has a credit card uses it to\npay for it.\n\n\nSentence (59) intuitively is true iff for every book that a\ncredit-card owner buys on amazon.com, there is some credit\ncard or other that she uses to pay for the book. Hence the mixed\nstrong and weak reading. Brasoveanu accounts for these readings, along\nwith the weak/strong ambiguity in general, within his system of Plural\nCompositional Discourse Representation Theory (PCDRT) by positing an\nambiguity at the level of indefinites. In his account, indefinites are\nunderspecified as to the presence of a maximization operator (which is\npresent in the strong indefinite but not the weak); the decision of\nwhich indefinite to use in a specific case is a \u201ccontext-driven\nonline process\u201d.\n\nTheories that assign both sets of truth conditions to relative clause\ndonkey sentences generally do so by positing some sort of ambiguity,\neither in the quantifiers, the pronouns, or the\n indefinites.[34]\n Though the matter isn\u2019t entirely clear, it seems plausible that\nthe theories discussed in this entry also may be able to assign both\nthe universal and the existential truth conditions to relative clause\ndonkey sentences by positing some sort of ambiguity. These matters\nrequire further\n investigation.[35]\n A recent theory that does not rely on any ambiguity is presented in Champollion, Bumford & Henderson (2019).  Champollion et al. argue for a trivalent semantics that allows for truth-value gaps for donkey sentences, along with a pragmatic theory that both fills in the gaps and predicts when hearers get a strong or weak interpretation.  This explains the different readings of donkey sentences in terms of underspecification rather than ambiguity.  The (dynamic) semantics delivers that a sentence like (26) is true iff every female donkey-owner beats every donkey she owns, false if at least one female donkey-owner does not beat any donkey she owns, and otherwise neither true nor false. Relying on Kri\u017e (2016)'s framework for plural definites, speakers can use a sentence to address the question under discussion (QUD) that is true enough at a world w even if it lacks a truth value at w, so long as it is not false at any world equivalent to w.  If the QUD is such that it requires that every female donkey-owner beat every donkey she owns, then worlds in which (say) some female donkey-owners who own multiple donkeys only beat one of their donkeys will be equivalent to worlds in which some female donkey owners do not beat any of their donkeys.  However, if the QUD is such that it requires that every female donkey-owner beat some donkey she owns, such worlds will be equivalent for conversational purposes to worlds in which each female donkey-owner beats all the donkeys she owns, and thus speakers will judge the weak reading true in this scenario.\n",
