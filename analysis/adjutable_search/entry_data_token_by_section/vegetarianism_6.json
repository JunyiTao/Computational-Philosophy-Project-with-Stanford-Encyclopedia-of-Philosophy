    "main_text": "From Production to Consumption || Bridging the Gap\n4.1 Bridging the Gap\n\nConsider a productivist idea about the connection between\nproduction and consumption according to which consumption of\nwrongfully-produced goods is wrong because it produces more wrongful\nproduction. The idea issues an argument that, in outline, is:\n\n\nConsuming some product P produces production of Q.\n\nProduction of Q is wrong.\n\nIt is wrong to produce wrongdoing. Hence,\n\nConsuming P is wrong.\n\n\nOr never mind actual production. A productivist might\nargue:\n\n\nConsuming some product P is reasonably expected to\nproduce production of Q.\n\nProduction of Q is wrong.\n\nIt is wrong to do something that is reasonably expected to produce\nwrongdoing. Hence,\n\nConsuming P is wrong. (Singer 1975; Norcross 2004; Kagan\n2011)\n\n\n(The main ideas about connecting consumption and production that\nfollow can\u2014but won\u2019t \u2014be put in terms of\nexpectation, too.)\n\nThe moral vegetarian might then argue that meat is among the values of\nboth P and Q: consuming meat is reasonably expect to\nproduce production of meat. Or the moral vegetarian might argue that\nconsuming meat produces more normalization of bad attitudes towards\nanimals and that is wrong. There are various\npossibilities.\n\nJust consider the first, the one about meat consumption producing meat\nproduction. It is most plausible with regard to buying. It is\nbuying the wrongfully-produced good that produces more of it.\nEating meat produces more production, if it does, by\nproducing more buying. When Grandma buys the wrongfully produced\ndelicacy, the idea goes, she produces more wrongdoing. The company she\nbuys from produces more goods whether you eat the delicacy or throw it\nout.\n\nThese arguments hinge on an empirical claim about production and a\nmoral claim about the wrongfulness of producing wrongdoing. The moral\nclaim has far-reaching implications (DeGrazia 2009 and Warfield 2015).\nConsider this rent case:\n\n\nYou pay rent to a landlord. You know that he takes your rent and uses\nthe money to buy wrongfully-produced meat.\n\n\nIf buying wrongfully-produced meat is wrong because it produces more\nwrongfully-produced meat, is it wrong to pay rent in the rent case? Is\nit wrong to buy a vegetarian meal at a restaurant that then takes your\nmoney and uses it to buy wrongfully-produced steak? These are\nquestions for productivists\u2019 moral claim. There are further,\nfamiliar questions about whether it is wrong to produce wrongdoing\nwhen one neither intends to nor foresees it and whether it is wrong to\nproduce wrongdoing when one does not intend it but does foresee it and\nthen about whether what is wrong is producing wrongdoing or,\nrather, simply producing a bad effect (see entries on the\n doctrine of double effect\n and\n doing vs. allowing harm).\n\nAn objection to productivist arguments denies the empirical claim and,\ninstead, accepting that because the food system is so enormous, fed by\nso many consumers, and so stuffed with money, our eating or buying\ntypically has no effect on production, neither directly nor\neven, through influencing others, indirectly (Budolfson 2015; Nefsky\n2018). The idea is that buying a burger at, say, McDonald\u2019s\nproduces no new death nor any different treatment of live animals.\nMcDonald\u2019s will produce the same amount of meat\u2014and raise\nits animals in exactly the same way\u2014regardless of whether one\nbuys a burger there. Moreover, the idea goes, one should reasonably\nexpect this. Whether or not this is a good account of how food\nconsumption typically works, it is an account of a possible system.\nConsider the Chef in Shackles case, a modification of a case in\nMcPherson 2015:\n\n\nAlma runs Chef in Shackles, a restaurant at which the chef is known to\nbe held against his will. It\u2019s a vanity project, and Alma will\nrun the restaurant regardless of how many people come. In fact, Alma\njust burns the money that comes in. The enslaved chef is superb; the\nfood is delicious.\n\n\nThe productivist idea does not imply it is wrong to buy food from or\neat at Chef in Shackles. If that is wrong, a different idea needs to\nexplain its wrongness.\n\nSo consider instead an extractivist idea according to which\nconsumption of wrongful goods is wrong because it is a benefiting from\nwrongdoing (Barry & Wiens 2016). This idea can explain why it is\nwrong to eat at Chef in Shackles\u2014when you enjoy a delicious meal\nthere, you benefit from the wrongful captivity of the chef. In\noutline, the extractivist argument is:\n\n\nConsuming some product P extracts benefit from the production\nof P.\n\nProduction of P is wrong.\n\nIt is wrong to extract benefit from wrongdoing. Hence,\n\nConsuming P is wrong.\n\n\nMoral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of\nP. Unlike the productivist argument, this one is more plausible\nwith regard to eating than buying. It\u2019s the eating,\ntypically, that produces the benefit and not the buying. Unlike the\nproductivist argument, it does not seem to have any trouble explaining\nwhat is wrong in the Chef in Shackles case. Unlike the productivist\nargument, it doesn\u2019t seem to imply that paying a landlord who\npays for wrongfully produced food is wrong\u2014paying a landlord is\nnot benefiting from wrongdoing.\n\nLike the productivist argument, the extractivist argument hinges on an\nempirical claim about consumer benefits and a moral claim about the\nethics of so benefiting.\n\nThe notion of benefiting, however, is obscure. Imagine you go to Chef\nin Shackles, have a truly repulsive meal, and become violently ill\nafterwards. Have you benefit ted from wrongdoing? If not, the\nextractivist idea cannot explain what is wrong with going to the\nrestaurant.\n\nPut so plainly, the extractivist\u2019s moral claim is hard to\nbelieve. Consider the terror-love case, a modification of a case Barry\n& Wiens 2016 credits to Garrett Cullity:\n\n\nA terrorist bomb grievously injures Bob and Cece. They attend a\nsupport group for victims, fall in love, and live happily ever after,\nleaving them significantly better off than they were before the\nattack.\n\n\nBob and Cece seem to benefit from wrongdoing but seem not to be doing\nanything wrong by being together. Whereas the productivist struggles\nto explain why it is wrong to patronize Chef in Shackles, the\nextractivist struggles to explain why it is permissible for Bob and\nCece to benefit from wrongdoing.\n\nA participatory idea has no trouble with the terror-love\ncase. According to it, consuming wrongfully-produced goods is wrong\nbecause it cooperates with or participates in or, in\nHursthouse\u2019s phrase, is party to wrongdoing (2011). Bob and Cece\ndo not participate in terror, so the idea does not imply they do\nwrong. The idea issues an argument that, in outline, goes:\n\n\nConsuming some product P is participating in the production of\nP.\n\nProduction of P is wrong.\n\nIt is wrong to participate in the production of wrongful things.\nHence,\n\nConsuming P is wrong. (Kutz 2000; Lepora & Goodin 2013)\n\n\nMoral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of\nP. Unlike the productivist or extractivist ideas, the\nparticipatory idea seems to as easily cover buying and eating for each\nis plausibly a form of participating in wrongdoing. Unlike the\nproductivist idea, it has no trouble explaining why it is wrong to\npatronize Chef in Shackles and does not imply it is wrong to pay rent\nto a landlord who buys wrongfully-produced meat. Unlike the\nextractivist idea, whether or not you get food poisoning at Chef in\nShackles has no moral importance to it. Unlike the extractivist idea,\nthe participatory idea does not falsely imply that the Bob and Cece do\nwrong in benefiting from wrongdoing\u2014after all, their failing in\nlove is not a way of participating in wrongdoing.\n\nYet it is not entirely clear what it is to participate in wrongdoing.\nConsider the Jains who commit themselves to lives without\nhimsa (violence). Food production causes himsa. So Jains try\nto avoid eating many plants, uprooted to be eaten, and even drinking\nuntreated water, filled with microorganisms, to minimize lives taken.\nYet Jaina monastics are supported by Jaina laypersons. The monastic\ncan\u2019t boil his own water\u2014that would be violent\u2014but\nthe water needs boiling so he depends on a layperson to boil. He kills\nno animals but receives alms, including meat, from a layperson. Is the\nmonastic participating in violence? Is he participating because he is\ncomplicit in this violence (Kutz 2000; Lepora & Goodin 2013)? Is\nhe part of a group that together does wrong (Parfit 1984: Chapter 3)?\nWhen Darryl refuses to buy wrongfully-produced meat but does no\npolitical work with regard to ending its production is he party to the\nwrongful production? Does he participate in it or cooperate with its\nproduction? Is he a member of a group that does wrong? If so, what are\nthe principles of group selection?\n\nAs a matter of contingent fact, failing to politically protest meat\nexhibits no objectionable attitudes in contemporary US society. Yet it\nmight be that consuming certain foods insults or otherwise disrespects\ncreatures involved in that food\u2019s production (R.M. Adams 2002;\nHill 1979). Hurka (2003) argues that virtue requires exhibiting the\nright attitude towards good or evil, and so if consuming\nexhibits an attitude towards production, it is plausible that eating\nwrongfully produced foods exhibits the wrong attitude towards them.\nThese are all attitudinal ideas about consumption. They might\nissue in an argument like this:\n\n\nConsuming some product P exhibits a certain attitude towards\nproduction of P.\n\nProduction of P is wrong.\n\nIt is wrong to exhibit that attitude towards wrongdoing. Hence,\n\nConsuming P is wrong.\n\n\nMoral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of\nP. Like the participatory idea, the attitudinal idea explains\nthe wrongness of eating and buying various goods\u2014both are ways\nof exhibiting attitudes. Like the participatory idea, it has no\ntrouble with Chef in Shackles, the rent case, the food poisoning case,\nor the terror-love case. It does hinge on an empirical claim about\nexhibition\u2014consuming certain products exhibits a certain\nattitude\u2014and then a moral claim about the impermissibility of\nthat exhibition. One might well wonder about both. One might well\nwonder why buying meat exhibits support for that enterprise but paying\nrent to someone who will buy that meat does not. One might well wonder\nwhether eating wrongfully-produced meat in secret exhibits support and\nwhether such an exhibition is wrong. Also, there are attitudes other\nthan attitudes towards production to consider. Failing to offer meat\nto a guest might exhibit a failure of reverence (Fan 2010). In\ncontemporary India, in light of the \u201cmeat murders\u201d\ncommitted by Hindus against Muslims nominally for the latter\ngroup\u2019s consumption of beef, refusing to eat meat might exhibit\nsupport for religious discrimination (Doniger 2017).\n\nThe productivist, extractivist, participatory, and attitudinal ideas\nare not mutually exclusive. Someone might make use of a number of\nthem. Driver, for example, writes,\n\n\n[E]ating [wrongfully produced] meat is supporting the\nindustry in a situation where there were plenty of other, better,\noptions open\u2026What makes [the eater] complicit is that\nshe is a participant. What makes that participation morally\nproblematic\u2026is that the eating of meat displays a\nwillingness to cooperate with the producers of a product that\nis produced via huge amounts of pain and suffering. (2015: 79; all\nitalics mine)\n\n\nThis seems to at least incorporate participatory and attitudinal\nideas. Lawford-Smith (2015) combines attitudinal and productivist\nideas. McPherson (2015) combines extractivist and participatory ideas.\nJames Rachels (2004) combines participatory and productivity ideas.\nAnd, of course, there are ideas not discussed here, e.g., that it is\nwrong to reward wrongdoers for wrongdoing and buying wrongfully\nproduced meat does so. The explanation of why it is wrong to consume\ncertain goods might be quite complex.\n",
