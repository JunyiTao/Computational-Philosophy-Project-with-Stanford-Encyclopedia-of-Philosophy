    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam Godwin (1756\u20131836) was the founder of philosophical\nanarchism. In his An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\n(1793) he argued that government is a corrupting force in society,\nperpetuating dependence and ignorance, but that it will be rendered\nincreasingly unnecessary and powerless by the gradual spread of\nknowledge and the expansion of the human understanding. Politics will\nbe displaced by an enlarged personal morality as truth conquers error\nand mind subordinates matter. In this development the rigorous\nexercise of private judgment, and its candid expression in public\ndiscussion, plays a central role, motivating his rejection of a wide\nrange of co-operative and rule-governed practices which he regards as\ntending to mental enslavement, such as law, private property, marriage\nand concerts. Epitomising the optimism of events in France at the time\nhe began writing, Godwin looked forward to a period in which the\ndominance of mind over matter would be so complete that mental\nperfectibility would take a physical form, allowing us to control\nillness and ageing and become immortal.\n\nGodwin\u2019s moral theory is often described as utilitarian. He\nclearly does play an important part in the history of utilitarianism,\nnot least for his invocation of both British and French writers in the\ntradition, such as Joseph Priestley and d\u2019Holbach and Helvetius,\nand for the way that his ethical theory is underpinned by a\ndistinctive rationalist necessarianism on the basis of which he\ninsisted on a strong form of first order impartiality. One of\nGodwin\u2019s lasting contributions to moral philosophy is \u201cthe\nfamous fire cause\u201d, in which we are asked to consider whom I\nshould save from a burning room if I can only save one person and if\nthe choice is between Archbishop F\u00e9nelon and a common\nchambermaid. F\u00e9nelon is about to compose his immortal\nT\u00e9l\u00e9maque and the chambermaid turns out to be\nmy mother. Godwin\u2019s conclusion that we must save the former\nrelies on consequentialist grounds. However, since his account of the\ncontent of utility is inseparable from the development of truth and\nwisdom, and since we can best promote this through the full and free\nexercise of private judgment and public discussion, the resulting\nposition looks more like a form of perfectionism than\nutilitarianism.\n\nGodwin\u2019s philosophical importance rests principally on his\nPolitical Justice. He wrote other philosophical works,\nThe Enquirer (1798) and Thoughts on Man (1831), but\nhe has become perhaps better known for his novels, the most famous of\nwhich is Things as They are, or The Adventures of Caleb\nWilliams (1794), and for the part he played in literary London\nfrom 1783\u20131836\u2014from his heyday in the 1790s as the radical\nphilosopher who married Mary Wollstonecraft, through the next forty\nyears in which he was variously the butt of attacks by Thomas Malthus,\nSamuel Parr and a host of anti-jacobin scribes, friend of the romantic\npoets, publisher and author of children\u2019s books, father-in-law\nand sponger off Percy Bysshe Shelley, and historian of the Civil War,\nto his final anomalous position as a government pensioner supported by\na Tory administration. His papers and especially his diary, which\nsparsely records what he read and wrote and whom he met, provide an\nimmense resource for scholars of the romantic period.\n",
