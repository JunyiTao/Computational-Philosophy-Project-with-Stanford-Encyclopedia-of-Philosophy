    "main_text": "\n\nNatural philosophy, as distinguished from metaphysics and mathematics,\nis traditionally understood to encompass a wide range of subjects\nwhich Aristotle included in the physical sciences. According to this\nclassification, natural philosophy is the science of those beings\nwhich undergo change and are independent of human beings. This vast\nfield of inquiry was described in Aristotelian treatises such as\nPhysics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption,\nMeteorology, History of Animals, On the Parts of Animals, On the\nGeneration of Animals, On the Soul (whose Renaissance reception\nis not discussed in the present entry); the so-called parva\nnaturalia (other minor writings); and some apocrypha\n(e.g., the Problemata), which were taught in the universities\nin the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance. During the Renaissance,\ndespite the enduring centrality of the Aristotelian paradigm for the\ndiscipline, natural philosophy was enriched and expanded by a number\nof further approaches. By the end of the sixteenth century natural\nphilosophy was no longer purely identified with the Aristotelian\nsystem or a standard university curriculum. At the same time, the\nproliferation of new contexts and ways of learning did not\nautomatically eliminate older ones, and this fusion contributed to the\nbirth of modern science in a period of religious and political\nupheaval.\n",
