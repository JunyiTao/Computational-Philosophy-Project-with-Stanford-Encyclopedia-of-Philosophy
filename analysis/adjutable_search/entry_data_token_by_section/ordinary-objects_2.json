    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || Sorites Arguments\n2.1 Sorites Arguments\n\nSorites arguments proceed from a premise to the effect that minute\ndifferences cannot make a difference with respect to whether some\nproperty F (or kind K) is instantiated to the conclusion that nothing\n(or everything) is F (or a K). Here is a sorites argument for the\nelimination of stones:\n\n(SR1)\nEvery stone is composed of a finite number of atoms.\n(SR2)\nIt is impossible for something composed of fewer than two atoms to\nbe a stone.\n(SR3)\nFor any number n, if it is impossible for an object composed of n\natoms to be a stone, then it is impossible for an object composed of\nn+1 atoms to be a stone.\n(SR4)\nSo, there are no stones.\n\n\nPremises SR2 and SR3 together entail that, for any finite number of\natoms, nothing made up of that many atoms is a stone. But this,\ntogether with SR1, entails that there are no\n stones.[11]\n\n\nSimilar arguments may be given for the elimination of individual\nordinary objects. One can construct a sorites series of contiguous\nbits of matter, running from a bit of matter, mk, at the\npeak of Kilimanjaro to a bit of matter, mp, in the\nsurrounding plains. From the sorites premise that a bit of matter\nthat\u2019s n inches along the path from mp to\nmk is part of Kilimanjaro iff a bit of matter that\u2019s\nn+1 inches along the path is part of Kilimanjaro (for any number n),\ntogether with the fact that mp is not part of Kilimanjaro,\nwe reach the absurd conclusion that mk isn\u2019t part of\nKilimanjaro. So, by reductio, we may conclude that Kilimanjaro does\nnot\n exist.[12]\n\n\nWhy accept SR3? Imagine a series of cases, beginning with a case\ninvolving a single atom and terminating with a case involving what\nwould seem to be a paradigm stone, where each case differs from the\npreceding case only by the addition of a single atom. It seems highly\nimplausible that there should be adjacent cases in any such series\nwhere there is a stone in one case but not in the other. Rejecting SR3\nwould look to commit one to just such a sharp cut-off.\n\nBut one can deny that SR3 is true without accepting that there is a\nsharp transition from stones to non-stones in such series, that is,\nwithout accepting that there is some specific object in the series\nthat definitely is a stone and whose successor definitely is not a\nstone. For one may instead hold that there is a range of cases in\nwhich it is vague whether the object in question is a\n stone.[13]\n\n\nHere is an illustration of how that sort of strategy might go. Let S\nbe some object in the series that clearly seems to be a stone, let NS\nbe an object that clearly seems to be a non-stone, and let BS be an\nobject that seems to be a borderline case of being a stone. One might\nsuggest that \u2018stone\u2019 is vague as a result of there being a\nrange of candidate precise meanings (or\n\u201cprecisifications\u201d) for the word \u2018stone\u2019,\n\n(i)\n all of which apply to S,\n (ii)\n none of which apply to NS,\n (iii)\n some but not all of which apply to BS, and\n (iv)\n none of which is definitely the meaning of\n\u2018stone\u2019.\n\n\n\u2018S is a stone\u2019 is true because S falls under all of these\nprecisifications of \u2018stone\u2019. \u2018NS is a stone\u2019\nis false because NS doesn\u2019t fall under any of them. And\n\u2018BS is a stone\u2019 is neither true nor false because BS falls\nunder some but not all of the precisifications. And then SR3 itself\nturns out to be false: on every precisification of\n\u2018stone\u2019, there is some object in the series such that it\nbut not its successor falls under that precisification. (This is\nsometimes known as a \u201csupervaluationist\u201d account.)\n\nDefenders of sorites arguments often complain that this line of\nresponse still commits one to some \u201csharp status\ntransition\u201d, for instance, a sharp transition from a case in\nwhich \u2018there is a stone\u2019 is true to a case in which it is\nneither true nor\n false.[14]\n",
