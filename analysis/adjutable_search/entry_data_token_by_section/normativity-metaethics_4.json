    "main_text": "Are There Any Normative Facts At All? \u2013 Error Theory || Formulating Error Theory\n2.1 Formulating Error Theory\n\nError theorists claim \u2013 roughly! \u2013 that all normative claims\nare false. As we indicated above, it\u2019s hard to give an analysis,\nmuch less necessary and sufficient conditions, for a claim\u2019s\nbeing normative. But error theorists need to get at least a little\nclearer about their target. For example, is \u201cEither the sun is\nshining or you shouldn\u2019t believe in aliens\u201d a normative\nclaim? It has a normative disjunct, after all. If this disjunctive\nclaim is normative, then the error theorist is in trouble, since\nsurely it can be true by virtue of the truth of its first\n(non-normative) disjunct, even if it\u2019s not the case that you\nshouldn\u2019t believe in aliens. To avoid the complication\nillustrated by this example, error theorists would be well-advised to\nset aside disjunctive normative claims (or at least to set aside\ndisjunctions of a normative claim with a non-normative claim).\n\nWe\u2019ll cut to the chase here: it makes most sense for error\ntheorists to make their claim about some properly defined set of\nbasic normative claims. This would be, more or less, those\nclaims that attribute a normative property to an individual or set of\nindividuals (construed broadly, to include institutions, governments,\netc.). So, on the modified reading, error theorists claim that all\nbasic normative claims are false. This will presumably take care\nof the broader issue, exemplified above, of logically complex claims:\nif they\u2019re normative, they are not in the primary scope of error\ntheory.\n\nA problem with this formulation is that some normative claims are\nanalytic or conceptual truths. An example might be the claim that\nmurder is wrong. A trivial example is the claim that wrongful killing\nis wrong. To address this issue we can take the error theorist to\nclaim that all basic substantive normative claims are false.\nThe idea here is that analytic and conceptual normative truths are not\nsubstantive. (But see Cuneo & Shafer-Landau 2014.)\n\nThis new formulation also entails that all (positive) normative\nprinciples are false \u2013 which we think error theorists will\nstrongly consider a feature rather than a bug. In a world where all\nclaims of the form \u201cYou should believe that P\u201d\nare false, so will all claims of the form \u201cIf P has\nproperties XYZ, then agents in situation S should\nbelieve that P\u201d \u2013 assuming it is possible for\nsomething P to be XYZ. (It\u2019s not totally clear\nhow we should understand normative principles \u2013 see Morton (2020);\nBerker (2018); Rosen (2017) \u2013 but surely in a world where\nit\u2019s not the case that anyone should believe anything, a\nprinciple outlining (possible) non-normative circumstances in which\nsomeone should believe something is false.)\n\nBut there is still a problem in this formulation. If all basic\nnormative claims are false, this appears to generate straightforward\ncontradictions. Here are two apparently basic normative claims:\n\nJohn\u2019s action is morally wrong.\nJohn\u2019s action is morally permissible.\n\n\nAnd it would certainly seem that if the first is false, then the\nsecond is true, and vice versa. So if being morally wrong and being\nmorally permissible are both normative properties, then both of these\nclaims are basic normative claims. It follows, therefore, on this\nformulation, that error theory is not only false, but false of logical\nnecessity, since it entails a contradiction.\n\nIf only it were so easy to refute error theory! Error theorists\nshould, in the cool light of day, formulate their theory to avoid this\nglaring problem. They have a few options \u2013 we\u2019ll outline\nthree. First, they can say that error theory is the claim that basic\nnormative claims are all neither true nor false, perhaps\nbecause they have a presupposition failure (Joyce 2001; Perl &\nSchroeder 2019; Olson 2014). This would allow them to get out of the\ncontradiction between\n (1)\n and\n (2):\n neither is true (or false), so neither entails the falsity (or truth)\nof the other.\n\nSecond, perhaps error theory could narrow the class of basic normative\nclaims \u2013 the claims that it holds to be false. If a basic\nnormative claim is a claim that ascribes a normative property to\nsomething, error theory should be careful as to which normative\npredicates ascribe bone fide normative properties. It could then deny\nthat permissibility is a bona fide normative property: to\nclaim that something is permissible is really to deny that it is\nmorally wrong. (Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (2006: \u00a73.1) has\nsuggested a very similar move for moral error theorists.)\n\nThis would allow the error theorist to affirm the truth of (2) above,\nand thus get out of the contradiction without sacrificing her\ncommitment to error theory. Error theory doesn\u2019t, after all,\nrequire one to deny the truth of all normative claims! And while this\nmore nuanced error theory has lost a lot of the shock-value of the\noriginal rough formulation, it still stays true to the motivating idea\nthat there are no instantiated normative properties, and no facts to\nnormatively constrain us in the world (though there are\n\u201cnegative\u201d normative facts, like the fact that this\npainting is not beautiful).\n\nFinally, the error theorist could, instead, deny that\n\u201cX is not permissible\u201d entails \u201cX\nis wrong\u201d, or that \u201cX is not wrong\u201d entails\n\u201cX is permissible\u201d. Doing so would allow her to\nmaintain the falsity of both\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n In short, nothing is wrong and nothing is permissible. Jonas Olson\nhas advocated this view (Olson 2014: ch. 1; see Streumer & Wodak\n2021), arguing that the connections between permissibility and\nwrongness are best accounted for in terms of conversational\nimplicature, not conceptual entailment. This view will be attractive\nfor any error theorist who shares Mackie\u2019s belief that error\ntheory does not commit one to any (positive) first-order normative\nclaims at all (Mackie 1977: 15\u201317). It also allows the error\ntheorist to get out of saying that all things are permissible, which\ncan seem independently unpalatable. On the other hand, she will still\nbe committed to the claim that nothing is wrong, and it might seem\nlike a small difference between this and the claim that all things are\npermissible. See Olson (2014: \u00a71.3) for a much fuller treatment\nof this problem of formulation, and possible solutions.\n\nSo, the error theorist has a few options in formulating her view.\nHowever, just for the sake of brevity \u2013 with the added bonus that\nit allows us to remain neutral between the above nuanced\nformulations \u2013 we\u2019ll abbreviate the error theory as the view\nthat all basic substantive normative claims are false.\n",
