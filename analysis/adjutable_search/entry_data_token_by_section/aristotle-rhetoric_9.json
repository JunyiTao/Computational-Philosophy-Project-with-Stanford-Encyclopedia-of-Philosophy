    "main_text": "The Three Means of Persuasion || Persuasion Through the Character of the Speaker\n5.1 Persuasion Through the Character of the Speaker\n\nWith regard to the speaker, persuasion is accomplished whenever the\nspeech is held in such a way as to render the speaker worthy of\ncredence. How is it exactly that the credibility of the speaker\ncontributes to persuasion? Aristotle is not overly explicit on this\nissue. However, he says that people follow the trustworthy speaker\nmore easily and more quickly on almost all subjects and completely so\nin affairs in which there are not exact criteria (to decide the case),\nbut only wavering opinions (Rhet. I.2, 1356a6\u20138). This\nmight be taken to mean that in the absence of other criteria to decide\na case, the audience will form the second-order judgment that\nsuggestions put forward by a credible speaker are themselves received\nas trustworthy and acceptable. Also, according to this remark, the\nimpact of what seems to be the speaker\u2019s character comes in\ndegrees; it is most important, if the point of issue is such that it\nleaves room for doubt and cannot be decided by conclusive proofs.\n\nBut how does the speaker manage to appear a credible person? Even\nthough Aristotle says that the speaker\u2019s character can have the\ngreatest impact on the hearers\u2019 judgement (especially in\ndeliberative speeches that are about future states of affairs), he\ndedicates only fifteen lines to this question. (Rhet. II.1,\n1378a6\u201320). Speakers, he says, must display (i) practical\nintelligence, prudence or competence (phron\u00easis), (ii)\na virtuous character, and (iii) good will; for, if they displayed none\nof them, the audience would doubt that they are able to give good\nadvice at all. Again, if they displayed (i) without (ii) and (iii),\nthe audience could doubt whether their aims or intentions are good.\nFinally, if he displayed (i) and (ii) without (iii), the audience\ncould still doubt whether they are giving the best suggestion or\nwhether they keep the best available suggestion for themselves due to\ntheir lack of benevolence. However, if they display all of them,\nAristotle concludes, it cannot rationally be doubted that their\nsuggestions are trustworthy. It should be stressed that the speakers\nmust accomplish these effects by what they say in the speech;\nit is not necessary that they are actually virtuous persons: on the\ncontrary, a pre-existing good character cannot be part of the\ntechnical means of persuasion. Also, even a person with outstandingly\nvirtuous character would have to present herself as virtuous by what\nshe says in the speech.\n",
