    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cFeminist aesthetics\u201d does not label a variety of\naesthetics in the way that, for example, the terms \u201cvirtue\ntheory\u201d and \u201cnaturalized epistemology\u201d qualify types\nof ethics and theories of knowledge. Rather, to refer to feminist\naesthetics is to identify a set of perspectives that pursue certain\nquestions about philosophical theories and assumptions regarding art\nand aesthetic categories. Feminists in general have concluded that,\ndespite the seemingly neutral and inclusive theoretical language of\nphilosophy, virtually all areas of the discipline bear the mark of\ngender in their basic conceptual frameworks. Those who work in\naesthetics inquire into the ways that gender influences the formation\nof ideas about art, artists, and aesthetic value. Feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics are also attuned to the cultural influences\nthat exert power over subjectivity: the ways that art both reflects\nand perpetuates the social formation of gender, sexuality, and\nidentity, and the extent to which all of those features are framed by\nfactors such as race, national origin, social position, and historical\nsituation. These interests have broadened from early analyses of norms\ngoverning female appearance to include consideration of the disabled\nbody and of transgender identities.\n\nAesthetics is by nature rather more interdisciplinary than are some\nother areas of philosophy, for this field articulates with art\npractices and the critical disciplines. Contributions to feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics have been made not only by philosophers but\nalso by art historians, musicologists, and theorists of literature,\nfilm, and performance, and by artists themselves. There are practical\nimplications for the discoveries that emerge from feminist\ninvestigations: analyses of the historical conceptual frameworks that\ngovern aesthetics and philosophy of art help to account for the\ndisproportionate numbers of men over women as influential\npractitioners of the arts, for example. Philosophical theories adapted\nby feminists also have been highly influential in the critical\ninterpretation of art and popular culture and sometimes in the\ndevelopment of contemporary artistic practice. Feminist aesthetics\npursues inquiries and critiques that reach into the values at the very\nfoundations of philosophy, examining concepts that often do not\ndirectly refer to men and women at all, yet whose hierarchies are\nimbued with gendered significance.\n\nThe following sections each begin with critiques of theoretical\ntraditions and feminist interventions and alternatives. These\nendeavors lead not only to revisions of philosophical positions but\nalso to the dissemination of feminist perspectives in areas collateral\nto traditional aesthetics. This progression moves historically through\ntopics that have animated the field, from early work to the most\nrecent.\n",
