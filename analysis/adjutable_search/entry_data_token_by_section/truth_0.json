    "main_text": "The neo-classical theories of truth\n1. The neo-classical theories of truth\n\nMuch of the contemporary literature on truth takes as its starting\npoint some ideas which were prominent in the early part of the 20th\ncentury. There were a number of views of truth under discussion at\nthat time, the most significant for the contemporary literature being\nthe correspondence, coherence, and pragmatist theories of truth.\n\nThese theories all attempt to directly answer the nature\nquestion: what is the nature of truth? They take this question at\nface value: there are truths, and the question to be answered concerns\ntheir nature. In answering this question, each theory makes the notion\nof truth part of a more thoroughgoing metaphysics or epistemology.\nExplaining the nature of truth becomes an application of some\nmetaphysical system, and truth inherits significant metaphysical\npresuppositions along the way.\n\nThe goal of this section is to characterize the ideas of the\ncorrespondence, coherence and pragmatist theories which animate the\ncontemporary debate. In some cases, the received forms of these\ntheories depart from the views that were actually defended in the\nearly 20th century. We thus dub them the \u2018neo-classical\ntheories\u2019. Where appropriate, we pause to indicate how the\nneo-classical theories emerge from their \u2018classical\u2019 roots\nin the early 20th century.\n",
