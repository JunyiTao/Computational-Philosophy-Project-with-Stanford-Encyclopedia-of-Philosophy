    "main_text": "Building on Hume || Hume on Belief about the External World\n4.2 Hume on Belief about the External World\n\nOfficially, Hume\u2019s (1739\u20131740: I, iv, 2) question is\n\u201cWhat causes induce us to believe in the existence of\nbodies?\u201d. Price suggests that Hume should have asked another\nquestion: \n\n\nThe question which he actually tries to answer \u2026 would come to\nsomething like this: given what characteristics of\nsense-impressions do we assert material-object propositions? \n\n\nAbout this question Price says:\n\n\nNow this is not a psychological question at all, nor is it a causal\nquestion. It belongs to the inquiry which is now called\n\u201cphilosophical analysis\u201d. It is a question about the\nmeaning of material-object words and material-object\nsentences, and about the rules of their use. (1940a: 15)\n\n\nIn understanding Hume\u2019s question thus, Price situates\nHume\u2019s philosophical discussion in debates about the possibility\nof reducing talk about material objects to talk about\nsense-impressions (or sense-data). As we saw, Price himself notably\ncontributed to this debate. However, reading Hume this way more or\nless guarantees that there can be no error of the sort Hume seems to\nallege, since the experiences in response to which we make our\njudgements are being built into the analysis of their meaning. \n\nPrice credits Hume for asking: Why doesn\u2019t \n\n\nthe interrupted and fragmentary character of human\nsense-experience \u2026 every drowsy nod \u2026 shake the opinion\nof us all that matter has a continued existence? (1940a: 20) \n\n\nPrice agrees with Hume that our perceptions are\n\u201cinterrupted\u201d, but clarifies this as a discontinuity in\ntheir character, and not that they are strictly interrupted, except by\nperiods of sleep or unconsciousness. Price further agrees, with\nreservations (1940a: 22\u201331), that this is not the result of our\nimpressions, given their silence about what is there in unsensed\nperiods, nor of reasons. Hume\u2019s explanation is that the belief\nresults from our imagination in conjunction with the character of our\nsense-impressions. Hume characterises the important aspects of our\nimpressions as constancy and coherence, which Price discusses in\ndetail (1940a: chapter 3; see Penelhum 1975: 67ff). Price argues,\ninitially, that Hume\u2019s conception of the notion of identity,\nwhich is central to his discussion, is fundamentally confused. The\nconstruction that Hume is meant to describe is the postulation of a\nsequence of unsensed sensibile forming a series with the sensed ones.\nIn developing this, Price initially goes along with the contrast\nbetween coherence and constancy. The cases that Hume envisages when\ntalking about constancy are based on what Price calls\n\u201cgap-indifference\u201d (1940a: 60\u201362). A schematic\nrepresentation of this is the sequence in a subject\u2019s experience\nof the following sort: A1, A2,\n\u2026 (gap) \u2026 A5, A6,\nwhere A stands for the same type of experience. For example,\nthe subject looks at a clock for two seconds, looks away, and then\nlooks again at the same clock. Price agrees that this sort of sequence\nprompts the subject to postulate the occurrence of\nA3 and A4 (although unsensed). But\nhe points out that we can also talk of gap-indifference if the gappy\nsequence is not monotonous, but is a gappy reproduction of variegated\nfamiliar series, such as\nA1B1C1D1,\nconsisting, say, of A2, \u2026,\nD2, in which case the subject postulates\nB2 and C2. In this way Price\nbrings both constancy and coherence under the term\n\u201cgap-indifference\u201d.\n\nDo the postulated un-sensed sensibilia in the reconstruction of our\nconception of the world exist (1940a: ch. 4)? Hume\u2019s official\nview is \u201cno\u201d. \u201cExperiments\u201d such as giving\noneself double-vision by pressing an eyeball supposedly show this.\nBut, Price argues, these \u201cexperiments\u201d don\u2019t show\nthat there is causal dependence of the existence of the current\nsensibile, or therefore any others, on the nervous system of the\nsubject. But, further, since according to Hume there are no such\nthings as eyeballs, fingers, or nervous systems, he cannot even accept\nthe data his arguments appeal to.\n\nPrice concedes that Hume\u2019s argument can be interpreted\ndifferently.\n\nOne route Price (1940a: 125\u2013133) discusses is to agree that\nthere are the sequences of un-sensed sensibilia imaginatively\npostulated by the ordinary person, but sometimes there are also sensed\nsensibilia sufficiently close in character to some members of the\nun-sensed series to count as the sensing of some of them.\n",
