Definite Descriptions\n\nDefinite descriptions are the logical constructions that Russell has\nin mind when when he describes them as \u201cincomplete\nsymbols\u201d. The notion of a \u201clogical fiction\u201d, on the\nother hand, applies most straightforwardly to classes. Other\nconstructions, such as the notions of the domain and range of a\nrelation, and of one to one mappings that are crucial to the\ndevelopment of arithmetic, are only \u201cincomplete\u201d in an\nindirect sense due to their being defined as classes of a certain\nsort, which are in turn constructions.\n\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions was introduced in his\npaper \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (Russell 1905) published in the\njournal Mind. Russell\u2019s theory provides the logical\nform of sentences of the form \u2018The \\(F\\) is \\(G\\)\u2019 where\n\u2018The \\(F\\)\u2019 is called a definite description in\ncontrast with \u2018An \\(F\\)\u2019 which is an indefinite\ndescription. The analysis proposes that \u2018The \\(F\\) is\n\\(G\\)\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018There is one and only one \\(F\\)\nand it is \\(G\\)\u2019. Given this account, the logical properties of\ndescriptions can be deduced using just the logic of quantifiers and\nidentity. Among the theorems in \u221714 of Principia\nMathematica are those showing that, (1) if there is just one\n\\(F\\) then \u2018The \\(F\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019 is true, and if there is\nnot, then \u2018The \\(F\\) is \\(G\\)\u2019 is always false and then,\n(2) if the \\(F = \\text{the } G\\), and the \\(F\\) is \\(H\\), then the\n\\(G\\) is \\(H\\). These theorems show that proper (uniquely referring)\ndescriptions behave like proper names, the \u201csingular\nterms\u201d of logic. Some of these results have been controversial\n\u2014 Strawson (1950) claimed that an utterance of \u2018The\npresent King of France is bald\u2019 should be truth valueless since\nthere is no present king of France, rather than \u201cplainly\u201d\nfalse, as Russell\u2019s theory predicts. Russell\u2019s reply to\nStrawson in (Russell 1959, 239\u201345) is helpful for understanding\nRussell\u2019s philosophical methodology of which logical\nconstruction is just a part. It is, however, by assessing the logical\nconsequences of a construction that it is to be judged, and so\nStrawson challenged Russell in an appropriate way. \n\nThe theory of descriptions introduces Russell\u2019s notion of\nincomplete symbol. This arises because no definitional\nequivalent of \u2018The F\u2019 appears in the formal analysis of\nsentences in which the description occurs. The sentence \u2018The\n\\(F\\) is \\(H\\)\u2019 becomes: \n\\[\n\\exists x [ \\forall y (Fy \\leftrightarrow y=x) \\ \\&\\  Hx ]\n\\]\n\n\nof which no subformula, or even a contiguous segment, can be\nidentified as the analysis of \u2018The F\u2019. Similarly, talk\nabout \u201cthe average family\u201d as in \u201cThe average family\nhas 2.2 children\u201d becomes \u201cThe number of children in\nfamilies divided by the number of families = 2.2\u201d. There is no\nsegment of that formula that corresponds to \u201cthe average\nfamily\u201d. Instead we are given a procedure for eliminating such\nexpressions from contexts in which they occur, hence this is another\nexample of an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d and the definition of an\naverage is an example of a \u201ccontextual definition.\u201d \n\nIt is arguable that Russell\u2019s definition of definite\ndescriptions was the most prominent early example of the philosophical\ndistinction between surface grammatical form and logical form, and\nthus marks the beginnings of linguistic analysis as a method in\nphilosophy. Linguistic analysis begins by looking past superficial\nlinguistic form to see an underlying philosophical analysis. Frank\nRamsey described the theory of descriptions as a \u201cparadigm of\nphilosophy\u201d (Ramsey 1929, 1). While in itself surely not a model\nfor all philosophy, it was at least a paradigm for the other examples\nof logical constructions that Russell listed when looking back on the\ndevelopment of his philosophy in 1924. The theory of descriptions has\nbeen criticized by some linguists and philosophers who see\ndescriptions and other noun phrases as full-fledged linguistic\nconstituents of sentences, and who see the sharp distinction between\ngrammatical and logical form as a mistake. (See the entry on\n descriptions.)\n\nFollowing Gilbert Ryle\u2019s (1931) influential criticisms of\nMeinong\u2019s theory of non-existent objects, the theory of\ndescriptions has been taken as a model for avoiding ontological\ncommitment to objects, and so logical constructions in general are\noften seen as being chiefly used to eliminate purported entities. In\nfact, that goal is at most peripheral to many constructions. The\nprincipal goal of these constructions is to allow the proof of\npropositions that would otherwise have to be assumed as axioms or\nhypotheses. Nor need the introduction of constructions always result\nin the elimination of problematic entities. Yet other constructions\nshould be seen more as reductions of one class of entity to another,\nor replacements of one notion by a more precise, mathematical,\nsubstitute.\n",
