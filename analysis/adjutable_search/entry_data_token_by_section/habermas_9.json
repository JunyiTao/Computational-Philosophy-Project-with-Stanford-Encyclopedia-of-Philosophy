    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics\n3. Discourse Ethics\n\nDiscourse ethics was developed contemporaneously with the theory of\ncommunicative action and fits into roughly the same framework.\nDiscourse ethics comprises a number of different interlocking\ntheories:\n\nthe lineaments of a social theory of morality\na normative moral theory\na philosophical justification of the moral standpoint (the\nprinciple of universalization)\na theory of the development of moral consciousness\n\n\nUnlike the Theory of Communicative Action there is no single\nwork in which Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics is given a settled and\ncanonical statement. Instead, it is an evolving research programme,\npresented in a series of essays most of which are contained in two\nvolumes published in English as Moral Consciousness and\nCommunicative Action (1990a) and Justification and\nApplication (1993). The development of Habermas\u2019s discourse\nethics falls into two phases, roughly 1983\u20131990 and\n1991\u20131996. Broadly speaking, the essays in Moral\nConsciousness and Communicative Action comprise phase one, and\nthose from Justification and Application through to\nBetween Facts and Norms, phase two. We will call the theory\ndeveloped in phase one \u201cdiscourse ethics\u201d, and that in\nphase two, \u201cdiscourse morality\u201d. For in the beginning of\nthe 1990s Habermas introduces a distinction between morality as a\nnormative theory of rightness, and ethics as a theory of the good, in\nwhich light, he himself later notes, to be accurate he should have\nrenamed his theory \u201cthe discourse theory of morality\u201d\n(1993: 1; 1991: 7).\n",
