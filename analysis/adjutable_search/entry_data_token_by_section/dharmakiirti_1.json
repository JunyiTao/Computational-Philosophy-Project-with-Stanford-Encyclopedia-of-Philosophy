    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Two arguments for momentariness\n1.3 Two arguments for momentariness\n\nDharmak\u012brti has two arguments for the momentariness\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47ikatva) of all that exists, one quite\nobscure and unconvincing, which he inherited from previous writers\nlike Vasubandhu (5 century C.E.), and the other more\n promising.[14]\n The first argument, which nowadays is commonly known as the\nvin\u0101\u015bitv\u0101num\u0101na, or \u201cthe inference\nof things perishing [spontaneously],\u201d turns on the long-attested\nBuddhist idea that perishing must be of the intrinsic nature of any\nobject. Perishing due to its intrinsic nature, something will always\nperish as soon it\n exists.[15]\n The point is that such moment by moment destruction is spontaneous\n(\u0101kasmika) and is the uncaused real nature of things,\nbecause it cannot be an effect of any cause. The effect of such a\ncause, i.e., the absence of the entity, would have to be a type of\nnon-being (abh\u0101va), and non-being is unreal.\n\nA key underlying principle of the\nvin\u0101\u015bitv\u0101num\u0101na is that negative facts,\nsuch as absences, are not part of the ultimate furniture of the\nworld but are just fictional conceptual constructions, as they\nare devoid of causal powers. Equally, a fiction lacking causal powers\nis not the effect of something else. While it is obviously impossible\nto deny that hammers smash pots, the absence (abh\u0101va) of\nthe pot, i.e., the non-existent pot, is not an effect, just as other\nnon-existent things (abh\u0101va), like horns of rabbits, are\nnot effects of anything either. Hammers and the like are thus not\nactually causes of the pot\u2019s absence but of it turning into potsherds.\nThat idea is perhaps defensible, in that arguably the mere absence of\nsomething\u2014a purely negative fact\u2014might be less real and\nless efficacious than the presence of other\n things.[16]\n Nonetheless, the rest of the argument looks to consist in a number of\nnon-sequiturs going from that difference in efficacy and\nreality between absences and presences to the idea that perishing is\nsomehow the real nature of things, that it must be intrinsic to them,\nand that therefore things must perish spontaneously moment after\nmoment. Let\u2019s grant the Buddhist view that the perishing of x\nis the real property of changing into a new thing, and not just\nx becoming absent. If it is accepted that hammer blows\ndo change pots into potsherds, then why couldn\u2019t someone\nskeptical about the Buddhist\u2019s arguments just take that as\nthe model of how things perish when they do? It does not follow from\nthat model of perishing that a pot could not endure for quite a\nwhile.\n\nThere is, fortunately, a much better argument for intrinsic\nmomentariness than the problematic\nvin\u0101\u015bitv\u0101num\u0101na. This argument is known\nas \u201cthe inference [of things\u2019 momentariness] from the [mere]\nfact of [them] existing\u201d (sattv\u0101num\u0101na), and\nseems to be largely Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s own invention, first developed\nin the second chapter of his\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya. If anything exists and is a\nspecific thing rather than another, it is because of its causal\nefficacy (arthakriy\u0101), or powers to produce such and\nsuch effects. Thus, the sattv\u0101num\u0101na reasoning,\nconcisely formulated, is that things are impermanent, i.e., are new\nthings moment after moment, because they are always causally efficient\nin some way. (Although not stated, it seems to be presupposed that\nreal things are every moment causing some or another\ndifferent effect. The differences between effects would be subtle ones\nthat often escape our perception.) The key step in the argument is\nthat nothing causes new effects while itself remaining the same.\nDharmak\u012brti, in the opening passages of the\nV\u0101dany\u0101ya, argues that if something were permanent\n(nitya), it would be causally inert as it would neither\nproduce its effects all at once (yaugapadyena) nor serially\n(kramena). Of course, it is the second hypothesis that is the\nmost attractive possibility for an espouser of permanently enduring\nthings: he would hold that a permanent unchanging cause would produce\na series of different effects, not because the cause changes in any\nway, but simply because of the presence of new and different\nsurrounding circumstances.\n\n\nSuppose it said that a permanent thing has successive concomitant\ncircumstances in dependence upon which it brings about a collection of\neffects\n serially.[17]\n\n\nTo this objection, Dharmak\u012brti, and especially the later\ncommentators like \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, reply that if a would-be cause remained\nunchanged over time and if it was only the concomitant circumstances\nthat changed, then it would have to be the new circumstances that were\nthe actual cause of the new effects. After all, the permanent thing\nwould be present unchanged both when the new effects are present and\nwhen they are absent. This failure of the co-presence and co-absence\n(anvayavyatireka) conditions for determining cause and effect\nwould show, for Dharmak\u012brti, that the ever-present thing is not\nthe actual cause of the new developments, but that something else is.\nThis is not unreasonable. If an epidemiologist, for example, found\nthat certain factors had been constant for quite some time before the\noutbreak of an infectious disease and remained unchanged at the time\nof the outbreak, he would tend to discount them as being responsible\nfor the epidemic. And if he found that some new powerful factors\nimmediately preceded the outbreak, he most likely would pin the\ncausality on them rather than on what had remained constant all along.\nThe logic in these arguments against permanence can be generalized to\nvarious would-be entities, including notably the non-Buddhist idea of\nthe permanent creator God (\u012b\u015bvara) who remains the\nsame throughout time while supposedly producing a series of\neffects.\n",
