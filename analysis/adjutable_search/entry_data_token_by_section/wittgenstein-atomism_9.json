    "main_text": "The Dismantling of Logical Atomism || First phase: The colour-exclusion problem\n5.2 Second phase: Generality and Analysis\n\nUnlike Frege and Russell, the Tractatus does not treat the\nuniversal and existential quantifiers as having meaning in isolation.\nInstead, it treats them as incomplete symbols to be analysed away\naccording to the following schemata:\n\n\u2200x. \u03a6x \u2194 \u03a6a &\n\u03a6b & \u03a6c\u2026\n\n\u2203x. \u03a6x \u2194 \u03a6a \u2228\n\u03a6b \u2228 \u03a6c\u2026\n\n\nUniversal (existential) quantification is treated as equivalent to a\npossibly infinite conjunction (disjunction) of propositions.\nWittgenstein\u2019s later dissatisfaction with this view is expressed\nmost clearly in G. E. Moore\u2019s notes of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlectures from Michaelmas term 1932.\n\nNow there is a temptation to which I yielded in [the]\nTractatus, to say that\n\n\n(x).fx = logical\n product,[9]\nfa . fb . fc\u2026\n\n\n(\u2203x).fx = [logical] sum, fa \u2228\nfb \u2228 fc\u2026\n\n\nThis is wrong, but not as absurd as it looks. (entry for 25 November,\n1932, Stern et. al., 2016,\n 215)[10].\n \n\n\nExplaining why the Tractatus\u2019s analysis of generality\nis not palpably absurd, Wittgenstein says: \n\nSuppose we say that: Everybody in this room has a hat = Ursell has a\nhat, Richards has a hat etc. This is obviously false, because you have\nto add \u201c& a, b, c,\u2026 are\nthe only people in the room.\u201d This I knew and said in [the]\nTractatus. But now, suppose we talk of\n\u201cindividuals\u201d in R[ussell]\u2019s sense, e.g., atoms or\ncolours; and give them names, then there would be no prop[osition]\nanalogous to \u201cAnd a, b, c are the\nonly people in the room.\u201d (ibid.)\n\n\nClearly, in the Tractatus Wittgenstein was not making the\nsimple-minded mistake of forgetting that \u201cEvery F is\nG\u201d cannot be analysed as \u201cGa &\nGb & Gc\u2026\u201d even when a,\nb, c, etc. are in fact the only Fs.\n(Unfortunately, his claim that he registered this point in the\nTractatus is not borne out by the text). His idea was rather\nthat the Tractatus\u2019s analysis of generality is offered\nonly for the special case in which a, b, c,\netc, are \u201cindividuals\u201d in Russell\u2019s sense.\nWittgenstein had supposed that in this case there is no proposition to\nexpress the supplementary clause that is needed in the other cases.\nUnfortunately, Wittgenstein does not explain why there should be no\nsuch proposition, but the answer seems likely to be the following:\nWhat we are assumed to be analysing is actually \u201cEverything is\nG.\u201d In this case any allegedly necessary competing\nclause \u2014 for example, \u201ca, b, c\netc., are the only things\u201d (that is, Tractarian\nobjects) \u2014 would just be a nonsense-string produced in the\nmisfired attempt to put into words something that is shown by\nthe fact that when analysis bottoms out it yields as names only such\nas figure in the conjunction \u201cGa & Gb\n& Gc\u2026\u201d (cf. Tractatus 4.1272).\n\nWhat led Wittgenstein to abandon the Tractatus\u2019s\nanalysis of generality was his realization that he had failed\nadequately to think through the infinite case. He had proceeded as\nthough the finite case could be used as a way of thinking about the\ninfinite case, the details of which could be sorted out at a later\ndate. By 1932 he had come to regard this attitude as mistaken. The\npoint is made in a passage from the Cambridge Lectures whose\nmeaning can only be appreciated after some preliminary explanation.\nThe passage in question makes a crucial claim about something\nWittgenstein refers to as \u201cThe Proposition\u201d. By this\nphrase in this context he means the joint denial of all the\npropositions that are values of the propositional function\n\u201cx is in this room\u201d. This proposition can be\nwritten: \n\n(x is in this room) [- - - - - T]\n\n\n(Entry for November 25th, 1932, Compare Stern et. al, 217)\n Here the symbol \u2018[- - - - - T]\u2019 symbolizes\nthe joint-denial operation, and the whole symbol expresses the result\nof applying this operation to arbitrarily many values of the\npropositional function \u201cx is in the room\u201d. The\ndashes in the symbol for joint denial represent rows in the\ntruth-table on which one or more of the truth-arguments\u2014that is\nvalues of the propositional function\u2014is true. The result of\napplying the operation of joint denial to those truth-arguments is\naccordingly false. (In a variant on this notation each of the dashes\ncould be replaced with \u2018F\u2019). Wittgenstein is interested in\nthe fact that while we write down finitely many dashes we intend the\narguments for the joint-denial operation to be arbitrarily many and\npossibly infinitely many. His criticism of these conceptions runs as\nfollows:\n\n\nThere is a most important mistake in [the] Tract[atus]\u2026I\npretended that the Proposition was a logical product; but it\nisn\u2019t, because \u201c\u2026\u201d don\u2019t give you a\nlogical product. It is [the] fallacy of thinking 1 + 1 + 1 \u2026 is\na sum. It is muddling up a sum with the limit of a sum (ibid.)\n\n\nHis point is that the Proposition does not, despite appearances,\nexpress a logical product. It rather, he now seems to be saying,\nexpresses something like an indefinitely extensible process.\nWittgenstein came to see his earlier hope that it did express a\nlogical product rested on the mistake of confusing \u201cdots of\ninfinitude\u201d with \u201cdots of laziness.\u201d. The upshot\ncould scarely be more important: if Wittgenstein is right, the\nTractatus\u2019s very conception of the general form of the\nproposition, because it makes essential appeal to the idea of the\njoint denial of arbitrarily many values of a propositional function,\nis itself infected with confusion.\n\nWittgenstein, however, does not think that the confusion of kinds of\ndots was the deepest mistake he made in the Tractatus. Beyond\nthis: \u201cThere was a deeper mistake \u2014 confusing logical\nanalysis with chemical analysis. I thought\n\u2018(\u2203x)fx\u2019 is a definite\nlogical sum, only I can\u2019t at the moment tell you which\u201d\n(November 25, 1932, ibid.; cf. PG, 210). Wittgenstein had\nsupposed that there was a fact of the matter \u2014 unknown, but in\nprinciple knowable \u2014 about which logical sum\n\u201c(\u2203x).fx\u201d is equivalent to. But\nbecause he had failed to specify the analytical procedure in full\ndetail, and because he had not adequately explained what analysis is\nsupposed to preserve, this idea was unwarranted. Indeed, it\nexemplified an attitude he was later to characterize as amounting to a\nkind of unacceptable \u201cdogmatism\u201d (WWK, 182).\n",
