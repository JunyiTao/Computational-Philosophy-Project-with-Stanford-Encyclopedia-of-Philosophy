    "main_text": "Constructivism\u2019s Place in Metaethics || A Constructivist Account of Truth?\n6.2 A Constructivist Account of Truth?\n\nAnother question about constructivism is whether it is committed to\nany theory of truth. Constructivists must deny the correspondence\ntheory of truth, the view that truth is correspondence to a fact. On\nthe other hand, constructivism can take on board the idea that\nnormative judgments are truth-apt. This view is hospitable to the\nconstructivist claim that moral and normative truths may alter over\ntime, as a result of ongoing rational deliberation and revision\n(Richardson 2013; LeBar 2013b; O\u2019Neill 1992, 2015; Laitinen\n2016). Some attempts to deal with semantic issues bring to light a\nresemblance between constructivism and pragmatism, which holds that a\nproposition is true if it works satisfactorily, and that the meaning\nof a proposition is to be found in the practical implications of\naccepting it (Misak 2000; Richardson 1998, 2013). Like pragmatism,\nconstructivism appeals to the practical point of view to account for\ntruth, in contrast to standard forms of realism about truth (Proulx\n2016; Elgin 1997; Richardson 2013; Schwartz 2017). Some critics are\nskeptical about the possibility of developing a constructivist account\nof truth (Hussain 2012: 189ff; Dorsey 2012).\n",
