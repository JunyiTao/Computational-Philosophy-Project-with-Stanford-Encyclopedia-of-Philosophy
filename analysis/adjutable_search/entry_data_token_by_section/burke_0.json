    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe name of Edmund Burke (1730\u201397)\n [1]\n is not one that often figures in the history of philosophy\n .[2]\n This is a curious fate for a writer of genius who was also the author\nof a book entitled A Philosophical Enquiry. Besides the\nEnquiry, Burke\u2019s writings and some of his speeches contain\nstrongly philosophical elements\u2014philosophical both in our\ncontemporary sense and in the eighteenth century sense, especially\n\u2018philosophical\u2019 history. These elements play a fundamental\nrole within his work, and help us to understand why Burke is a\npolitical classic. His writings and speeches therefore merit attention\nas examples of attention to both ideas and to history, and of the role\nof this attention in practical thought. His work is also, as we see\nshall see at the end of this entry, an achievement that challenges\nassumptions held by many of our contemporaries. One way or another,\nthen, Burke is a vitally important figure. Yet there is very little\nacademic writing about Burke and philosophy outside of that\nEnquiry. This is a significant omission from the history of\npolitical thought, for at least three reasons. One is that though much\nhas been written about Burke, including work placing him in relation\nto other political writers, yet how he thought has not been made\nclear. A second is that the rational content of his thinking has not\nbeen made evident, precisely because its philosophical component has\nnot been identified. Thirdly, because the manner and content of his\nthought have not been identified in the way the case warrants, we read\nof Burke\u2019s \u2018mystic spirit\u2019 (Spurgeon 1922, p. 100) or the\n\u2018irrationalism\u2019 of his writing (Butler 1984, p. 35). This\nmatters not only with respect to historical truth, important though\nthat is, but also because Burke is sometimes treated as a symbolic or\ninstructive figure for contemporary political action (cf., e.g.,\nNorman 2013), and in significant ways marks an instructive contrast\nwith some current ways of thinking. This being so, it is especially\nimportant to get the historical figure right. \n",
