    "main_text": "Practical Philosophy\n6. Practical Philosophy\n\nThe subject matter of Wolff\u2019s practical philosophy is restricted\nto those things that have to do with human action. In Wolff\u2019s\nLatin texts, practical philosophy is divided into four main\ndisciplines: universal practical philosophy, natural law, politics,\nand moral philosophy. And just as ontology purportedly provides the\nfoundational underpinnings for the disciplines of \u201cspecial\nmetaphysics\u201d in the theoretical realm, universal practical\nphilosophy plays an analogous role for the disciplines of natural law,\npolitics, and moral philosophy in the practical realm.\n\nA central and perhaps unifying concept in Wolff\u2019s practical\nwritings is the concept of \u201cperfection\u201d. In an early\nletter to Leibniz, dated 4 May 1715, Wolff explains the importance\nthat the concept serves in his ethics:\n\n\nI need the notion of perfection for dealing with morals. For, when I\nsee that some actions tend toward our perfection and that of others,\nwhile others tend toward our imperfection and that of others, the\nsensation of perfection excites a certain pleasure [voluptas]\nand the sensation of imperfection a certain displeasure\n[nausea]. And the emotions [affectus], by virtue of\nwhich the mind is, in the end, inclined or disinclined, are\nmodifications of this pleasure and displeasure; I explain the origin\nof natural obligation in this way\u2026 From this also comes the\ngeneral rule or law of nature that our actions ought to be directed\ntoward the highest perfection of ourselves and others. (Leibniz 1989a:\n231\u2013232)\n\n\nAccording to Wolff, the ultimate goal of human action is to attain, or\nat least approximate, the highest degree of perfection that is\npossible. Humans, as individuals or groups, should strive for\nperfection insofar as moral worth and goodness reside in the objective\nessence of humankind. In a strict sense, each person is obligated by\nthe law of nature to instantiate perfection in his/her own life.\nActions that tend toward perfection produce pleasure and actions that\ntend toward imperfection produce displeasure (or pain). In many\nrespects, this consequentialist feature of Wolff\u2019s ethical\ntheory resembles various forms of utilitarianism that were emerging in\nEngland during the mid-to-late eighteenth century.\n\nAlso central to Wolff\u2019s practical philosophy is its autonomy\nfrom theological doctrine. Although maintaining that a universal\nethics is certainly compatible with the teachings of Sacred Scripture,\nWolff is adamant that morality does not depend on revelation or\nGod\u2019s divine commands. Advocating the separation of philosophy\nand religion is a theme that Wolff developed and defended throughout\nhis entire career and it is a feature of his thought that secures him\na place among other philosophers of Europe\u2019s Enlightenment.\n",
