    "main_text": "Scope and Role of Distributive Principles\n1. Scope and Role of Distributive Principles\n\nDistributive principles vary in numerous dimensions. They vary in what\nis considered relevant to distributive justice (income, wealth,\nopportunities, jobs, welfare, utility, etc.); in the nature of the\nrecipients of the distribution (individual persons, groups of persons,\nreference classes, etc.); and on what basis the distribution should be\nmade (equality, maximization, according to individual characteristics,\naccording to free transactions, etc.). In this entry, the focus is\nprimarily on principles designed to cover the distribution of benefits\nand burdens of economic activity among individuals in a society.\nAlthough principles of this kind have been the dominant source of\nAnglo-American debate about distributive justice over the last six\ndecades, there are other important distributive justice questions,\nsome of which are covered by other entries in the encyclopedia. These\ninclude questions of distributive justice at the global level rather\nthan just at the national level (see\n justice: international),\n distributive justice across generations (see\n justice: intergenerational)\n and how the topic of distributive justice can be approached, not as a\nset of principles but as a virtue (see\n justice: as a virtue).\n\nAlthough the numerous distributive principles vary along different\ndimensions, for simplicity, they are presented here in broad\ncategories. Even though these are common classifications in the\nliterature, it is important to keep in mind they necessarily involve\nover-simplification, particularly with respect to the criticisms of\neach of the groups of principles. Some criticisms may not apply\nequally to every principle in the group. The issue of how we are to\nunderstand and respond to criticisms of distributive principles is\ndiscussed briefly in the final section on methodology (see\n Methodology).\n\nThroughout most of history, people were born into, and largely stayed\nin, a fairly rigid economic position. The distribution of economic\nbenefits and burdens was normally seen as fixed, either by nature or\nby a deity. Only when there was a widespread realization that the\ndistribution of economic benefits and burdens could be affected by\ngovernment did distributive justice become a live topic. Now the topic\nis unavoidable. Governments continuously make and change laws and\npolicies affecting the distribution of economic benefits and burdens\nin their societies. Almost all changes, whether they regard tax,\nindustry, education, health, etc. have distributive effects. As a\nresult, every society has a different distribution at any point in\ntime and we are becoming increasingly more adept at measuring that\ndistribution. More importantly, at every point in time now, each\nsociety is faced with a choice about whether to stay with current\nlaws, policies, etc. or to modify them. The practical contribution of\ndistributive justice theory is to provide moral guidance for these\nconstant choices.\n\nMany writers on distributive justice have tended to advocate and\ndefend their particular principles by describing or considering ideal\nsocieties operating under them. They have been motivated to do this as\nan aid to understanding what their principles mean. Unfortunately\nthough, as a result of this practice, some readers and the general\npublic have been misled into believing that discussions of\ndistributive justice are merely exercises in ideal theory\u2014to\nbe dismissed as a past-time of the academic elite rather than as\nsomething that is crucially relevant to current political discussion.\nThis misunderstanding is unfortunate because, in the end, the main\npurpose of distributive justice theory is not to inform decisions\nabout ideal societies but about our societies. To help correct this\nmisunderstanding it is important to acknowledge that there has never\nbeen, and never will be, a purely libertarian society or Rawlsian\nsociety, or any society whose distribution conforms to one of the\nproposed principles. Rather than guiding choices between ideal\nsocieties, distributive principles are most usefully thought of as\nproviding moral guidance for the choices that each society faces right\nnow. So, for instance, advocates of Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle\nare most constructively understood as arguing for changes to our basic\ninstitutional structures which would improve the lifetime prospects of\nthe least advantaged in society. Other theorists are arguing for\nchanges to bring economic benefits and burdens more in accordance with\nwhat people really deserve. Libertarians are arguing that reductions\nin government intervention in the economy will better respect liberty\nand/or self-ownership of its citizens. Sometimes a number of the\ntheories may recommend the same changes to our current practices;\nother times they will diverge. It is best to understand the different\ntheorists, despite the theoretical devices they sometimes employ, to\nbe speaking to what should be done in our society\u2014not about\nwhat should be done in some hypothetical society. Of course, ensuring\nthat philosophical principles be effective for the purpose of guiding\npolicy and change in real societies involves important and complex\nmethodological questions. For a review of work specifically addressing\nthis issue, in ideal and nonideal theory, see Zofia Stemplowska and\nAdam Swift (2012), and Valentini (2012).\n\nDistributive justice theorists (perhaps like all theorists) tend to\nemphasize the differences between their theories. This emphasis also\nprovides an avenue for those who have an interest in ignoring\ndistributive justice to dismiss the relevance of the distributive\njustice literature\u2014\u2018we cannot get any guidance from\nthese theorists\u2014they completely disagree with each\nother\u2019. Such dismissals misunderstand that it is impossible not\nto take a stand on distributive justice at every moment of a\nsociety\u2019s existence. This misunderstanding is, perhaps, best\nillustrated by the most common type of dismissal. Often governments\ntry to justify inaction, in the face of calls to change some\ngovernment policy in light of some distributive justice concern, on\nthe grounds that there are \u2018disagreements/lack of\nconsensus\u2019 about the issue. Of course, there always are\ndisagreements, on any topic, whether moral or empirical, which will\nhave a differential effect on people\u2019s material interests. But\nto think that this points to the desired conclusion\u2014that in\nlight of this we should retain the status quo for the time \nbeing\u2014reveals a confusion about the nature of the choices always\nfacing each society. So, in this instance, to claim that we should not\npursue any changes to our economic structures in light of a\ndistributive justice argument calling for change is, by its very\nnature, to take a stand on the distributive justice of (or, if one\nprefers, the morality of) the current distribution and structures in\nthe society compared to any of the possible alternative distributions\nand structures practically available. At any particular moment the\nexisting economic and institutional framework is influencing the\ncurrent distribution of economic and life prospects for all members of\nthe society. To assert that we should not change the current system is\ntherefore, despite implications to the contrary, to take a substantive\nposition on distributive justice debates. It is to argue that keeping\nthe existing distribution is morally preferable to changing to any\npractical alternative proposed\u2014to take a substantive position\nin just the area that it was claimed was too controversial to\nconsider. Societies cannot avoid taking positions about distributive\njustice all the time and any suggestion that they can should be\nresisted as incoherent.\n\nA related point can be made when people assert that economic\nstructures and policy should be left to economists, or when people\nassert that economic policy can be pursued without reference to\ndistributive justice. These assertions reveal misconceptions about\nwhat distributive justice and economics are, and how they are related.\nPositive economics, at its best, can tell us about economic causes and\neffects. Positive economics is very important for distributive justice\nbecause it can give us guidance about which changes to pursue in order\nto better instantiate our moral principles. What it cannot do, in the\nabsence of the principles, is tell us what we should do. This point is\neasily lost in everyday political discussion. When an economist says\n\u2018The Central Bank should raise interest rates\u2019, the\ngeneral population often, mistakenly, believes the recommendation is\npurely coming from the science of economics. Moreover the\n\u2018should\u2019 is almost always a moral \u2018should\u2019.\nWhen economists make such a recommendation they, sometimes\nunconsciously, have taken off their social scientific hat. They are\nemploying alongside their positive economic theory, a moral principle.\nSuppressing, either consciously or unconsciously, that there are\nalways moral arguments being employed in arguments about what economic\npolicies a government should pursue has had the effect of creating\nmisconceptions about the respective roles of positive economics and\ndistributive justice in government decision-making.\n\nFor instance, the raising of interest rates is typically thought by\neconomists to have the dual effects of suppressing inflation and\nsuppressing employment. To get to a recommendation that the Central\nBank should reduce interest rates involves not only empirical views\nabout the relative sizes of the inflation and unemployment effects and\ntheir long-term impact on growth, etc. but also normative views about\nthe relative moral importance of inflation, employment and growth. For\neconomists, these normative views on economic policies come under the\nrubric of \u2018normative\u2019 economics, while philosophers would\ntypically categorize them under \u2018distributive justice\u2019.\nBut the rubrics are not important as basically the same area is\ncovered under different names\u2014the normative evaluation of\neconomic policies, structures, or institutions. (To avoid confusion it\nshould be noted that the distributive justice tradition includes\nprinciples which do not use \u2018justice\u2019 per se, such as\nutilitarianism, but which are moral principles relating to\ndistribution just the same.) The evaluations often look different\nbecause economists most commonly use utility as their fundamental\nmoral concept while philosophers use a wider variety of moral\nconcepts, but the task in which they are both engaged is very similar.\nWhat is most important to understand here is that positive economics\nalone cannot, without the guidance of normative principles, recommend\nwhich policies, structures, or institutions to pursue. Distributive\njustice theories, such as those discussed in this entry, aim to supply\nthis kind of normative guidance. \n",
