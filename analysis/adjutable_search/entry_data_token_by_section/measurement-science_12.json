Like physical\nquantities, values of economic variables often cannot be observed\ndirectly and must be inferred from observations based on abstract and\nidealized models. The nineteenth century economist William Jevons, for\nexample, measured changes in the value of gold by postulating certain\ncausal relationships between the value of gold, the supply of gold and\nthe general level of prices (Hoover and Dowell 2001: 155\u2013159;\nMorgan 2001: 239). As Julian Reiss (2001) shows, Jevons\u2019\nmeasurements were made possible by using two models: a\ncausal-theoretical model of the economy, which is based on the\nassumption that the quantity of gold has the capacity to raise or\nlower prices; and a statistical model of the data, which is based on\nthe assumption that local variations in prices are mutually\nindependent and therefore cancel each other out when averaged. Taken\ntogether, these models allowed Jevons to infer the change in the value\nof gold from data concerning the historical prices of various\n goods.[19]\n\nThe ways in which models function in economic measurement have led\nsome philosophers to view certain economic models as measuring\ninstruments in their own right, analogously to rulers and balances\n(Boumans 1999, 2005c, 2006, 2007a, 2009, 2012a, 2015; Morgan 2001).\nMarcel Boumans explains how macroeconomists are able to isolate a\nvariable of interest from external influences by tuning parameters in\na model of the macroeconomic system. This technique frees economists\nfrom the impossible task of controlling the actual system. As Boumans\nargues, macroeconomic models function as measuring instruments insofar\nas they produce invariant relations between inputs (indications) and\noutputs (outcomes), and insofar as this invariance can be tested by\ncalibration against known and stable facts. When such model-based\nprocedures are combined with expert judgment, they can produce\nreliable measurements of economic phenomena even outside controlled\nlaboratory settings (Boumans 2015: Chap. 5).\n",
