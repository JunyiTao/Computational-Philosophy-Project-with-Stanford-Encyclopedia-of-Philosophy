    "main_text": "The \u201cSpheres of Existence\u201d or \u201cStages on Life\u2019s Way\u201d || The Ethical\n3.2 The Ethical\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s most famous spokesman for the ethical life is\nknown as Judge (or \u201cAssessor\u201d) William. In his\ntwo\u2014very\u2014long letters to his young friend \u201cA\u201d,\nWilliam\u2019s strategy has an \u201cindirect\u201d element: he\naims to show how the ethical life provides what the aesthete claims to\ncare about (for instance, romantic love) better than the aesthetic\nlife itself can. (Witness the titles the book\u2019s editor, Victor\nEremita, gives to the letters: \u201cThe Aesthetic Validity of\nMarriage\u201d and \u201cEquilibrium between the Aesthetic and the\nEthical in the Development of Personality\u201d.) At the heart of the\nJudge\u2019s worldview is the idea that living a fully human life\nnecessarily involves the kind of commitments of which \u201cA\u201d\nis so wary: relationships and social roles can legitimately be\nidentity-conferring in an important sense. This is a key respect in\nwhich the \u201cethical self\u201d contrasts with the isolated\n\u201cself\u201d of the aesthete. (It also highlights the importance\nof love in Kierkegaard\u2019s thought (see\n \u00a73.3.3\n below).) Part of William\u2019s strategy is to try to show\n\u201cA\u201d that he has deeper desires than he recognizes.\n\u201cA\u201d\u2019s namelessness has often been taken as a signal\nthat the aesthete in an important sense lacks a self; the Judge aims\nto show that the aesthete\u2019s living for \u201cthe moment\u201d\nmeans that the self becomes nothing more than a series of such\nmoments. The ethical self, by contrast, seeks a coherence and a kind\nof unity that can endure over time, rather than being a series of\ndisconnected episodes. Relationships and social roles are, for the\nJudge, key to this.\n\nIn this approach, however, \u201cthe aesthetic\u201d is not just\nsomething that is transcended, but rather something that is taken up\ninto the higher existence-spheres in a transformed way. For instance,\nat the heart of William\u2019s praise of marriage is the idea that\nthis is the way in which romantic love endures\u2014and is a better\nexpression of love\u2019s own demands. Marriage also illustrates the\nidea of the ethical as the sphere of \u201copenness\u201d or\ntransparency: marriage embodies the ethical life insofar as it\nprovides an environment in which two people can progressively reveal\nthemselves to each other over a lifetime. (Fear and Trembling\nwill go on to contrast the \u201copenness\u201d of the ethical with\ndifferent forms of concealment found in both the aesthetic and the\nreligious.)\n\nThe Judge\u2019s second letter stresses the importance of\nchoice. He urges \u201cA\u201d to \u201cchoose\ndespair\u201d, by which he means: recognize that despair arises from,\nand is essential to, the aesthetic life, and that an authentic self\ncannot be achieved thorough the aesthetic life alone. (As hinted at in\n section 2\n above, aspects of the human self\u2014possibility, necessity,\nfinitude, infinitude\u2014have their own characteristic forms of\ndespair, each rooted either in a lack of imagination or in a misuse of\nthe imagination.) His key theme is to try to persuade the aesthete\nthat choosing \u201caesthetically\u201d is not really choosing at\nall; that he needs to \u201cchoose choice itself:\u201d take\nresponsibility for the person he has become, as the first step in\naiming to change it. One way of glossing the claim that\n\u201cA\u201d lacks a self is that the aesthetic life is one of\nself-alienation (the Judge alleges that \u201cA\u201d\n\u201ccontinually hover[s] above\u201d himself (EO II 198/SKS 3,\n192)). By contrast, the ethical self contains elements of\nself-acceptance\u2014the facticity of one\u2019s life\u2014as well\nas what might be called \u201cself-shaping\u201d\u2014that which\ncan be chosen (Rudd 2012). As the Judge puts it, \u201cthe I chooses\nitself\u2014or, more correctly, receives [or \u2018accepts\u2019]\nitself [det modtager sig selv]\u201d (EO II, 177/SKS 3,\n172). In this way, the ethical self strives for a balance which avoids\nthe despair of possibility (the excessive plenitude of choice that\nparalyses the will) and the despair of necessity (the complete absence\nof choice). At the heart of this notion of choice is the view that\nfreedom is found in voluntary self-limitation, as illustrated by the\nJudge\u2019s claim that his devotion to his work, his wife and his\nchildren is less a sacrifice than the source of his joy and\nsatisfaction. Precursors of this view which are likely influences on\nKierkegaard here include Luther\u2019s idea that freedom is being\nable to transcend the demands of one\u2019s baser inclinations\nwillingly to obey God\u2019s law (see especially \u201cThe Freedom\nof a Christian\u201d), and Hegel\u2019s recognition of our mutual\ninterdependence in the thought that true freedom involves recognizing\nthat what may initially appear to be a \u201cconstraining\nother\u201d is, in a deeper sense, part of the self. Contemporary\nparallels which have interested Kierkegaard scholars include Harry\nFrankfurt\u2019s idea that unlimited \u201cfreedom\u201d would lead\nto the evaporation of identity (see for instance Frankfurt 1988:\n177\u2013190) and the importance of acquiring a \u201chigher\norder\u201d will (see the essays in Rudd and Davenport 2015).\n\nIn all this, we see that a key contrast is between a life viewed in\nterms of mere possibilities (the aesthetic) and in terms of\n\u201ctasks\u201d (the ethical). Insofar as a person recognizes\n\u201cchoice\u201d as a task (as opposed to being an essentially\narbitrary selection from an array of possibilities), she has\neffectively already chosen the ethical.\n\nInterpreters of Kierkegaard have disagreed on whether the ethical is a\nnecessary, if intermediate, stage on the route to a\n\u201chigher\u201d existence-sphere, or whether there is an element\nof na\u00efvet\u00e9 to William\u2019s valorization of conventional\nsocial norms (cf. Hegelian Sittlichkeit) which sophisticated\naesthetes have already seen through and rejected. A related debate has\narisen from Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s claim, in his A Short\nHistory of Ethics and After Virtue, that the choice\nbetween the aesthetic and the ethical is arbitrary or\n\u201ccriterionless\u201d, (MacIntyre 1981 [1984]).\nMacIntyre\u2019s view has been much discussed since, though\nKierkegaard scholars have been almost unanimous in their rejection of\nit. MacIntyre subsequently amended his position, while nevertheless\nre-stating the \u201ccriterionless choice\u201d charge in a\ndifferent form (see MacIntyre 2001, esp. 344). Subsequent discussion\nhas focused on whether Kierkegaard\u2019s project is in fact far\ncloser to MacIntyre\u2019s own than the latter realized, one\ncomponent of this debate being whether it is helpful to think of the\nethical in terms of some sort of \u201cnarrative unity\u201d (for\ncontributions, see the essays in Davenport and Rudd 2001, Lippitt\n2007, Rudd 2012, Davenport 2012, Lippitt 2013b [for an overview],\nStokes 2015, the essays in Lippitt and Stokes 2015, and Compaijen\n2018).\n\nCertainly, the Judge\u2019s somewhat complacent trust in\nSittlichkeit raises several important questions. Do we really\nhave such clearly defined positions and duties? Can\nSittlichkeit do justice to individual uniqueness? What\nunderlying principle can justify which roles and projects we\n\u201cchoose\u201d to take on? Without an answer to this last\nquestion, some have seen there to be a hidden complicity between the\naesthetic and the ethical, such that the ethical is not really the\nadvance on the aesthetic that the Judge supposes. And this conception\nof the ethical certainly founders against conceptions of the religious\nexistence-sphere envisaged elsewhere in the authorship. The Judge sees\nhimself as a religious person, but his religiosity does not seem as\ncentral to his identity as his earthly commitments. Certainly, his\nreligious faith does not challenge or unsettle his conventional\nlifestyle, as would be the case in Kierkegaard\u2019s later\ndescriptions of a religious life that is distinctly and radically\nChristian.\n\nOf each of the three existence-spheres, the ethical is perhaps the\nhardest to pin down, the meaning of the term shifting across texts. In\nboth Either/Or and Fear and Trembling (in the\njudgment of most scholars), the ethical is seen primarily as\nSittlichkeit: grounded\u2014as for Hegel\u2014in social\nrequirements and expectations. (That said, there has been considerable\ndiscussion about whether the conception of the ethical in Fear and\nTrembling is Kantian (e.g., Pojman 1984, Hampson 2013), Fichtean\n(Kosch 2006) or Hegelian (e.g., Evans 2004, Walsh 2009, Westphal\n2014)). But there is an important difference between the two texts.\nJudge William seems mostly oblivious to the possibility that there\ncould be a need for anything higher than this kind of ethical life.\nHowever, in Fear and Trembling Johannes de silentio is\nfascinated by the Biblical story of the akedah, the binding\nof Isaac by Abraham (Genesis 22: 1\u201318). Abraham is seen as\nembodying a life of faith that cannot be reduced to\nSittlichkeit, for reasons that we shall see in the next\nsection.\n\nConcluding Unscientific Postscript offers an account of the\nethical life that sees it as the beginning of a kind of\n\u201cimmanent\u201d religious existence (\u201cReligiousness\nA\u201d) that is possible for humans apart from any transcendent\nrevelation. Here the ethical life requires \u201can absolute relation\nto the absolute\u201d that relativizes all earthly commitments,\nleading to resignation, suffering, and, ultimately, an encounter with\nguilt. Religiousness A, which is distinct from Christianity (what\nClimacus calls \u201cReligiousness B\u201d) is seen a providing the\n\u201cpathos\u201d or inwardness that is necessary for a person to\nbecome a Christian, though even here there is no direct or immediate\ntransition possible to Christianity as a \u201ctranscendent\u201d\nform of religious existence.\n\nA price is paid, however, for focusing exclusively on the pseudonymous\nworks for accounts of Kierkegaard\u2019s account of \u201cthe\nethical\u201d. The most obvious exclusion would be Works of\nLove, arguably the most important work of Kierkegaard\u2019s\nmature Christian ethics. But it would also overlook some profound\nreflections to be found in the upbuilding discourses on virtues needed\nfor ethical as well as religious life (such as courage, forgivingness,\ngratitude, hope, humility, patience) as well as more unusual spiritual\nqualities (such as \u201cjoy\u201d [gl\u00e6de]) and, of\ncourse, faith itself.
