    "main_text": "Issues || Migration\n3.2 Migration\n\nMigration has accelerated along with the globalization of the economy\nand women comprise a higher proportion of migrants, especially labor\nmigrants, and refugees than ever before. Feminist philosophical\nresponses to the feminization of migration fall into three general\nlines of argument. Early work in this area highlights the ways in\nwhich gender, race, class, culture, and immigration status intersect\nto produce disproportionate burdens for immigrant women. Subsequent\nwork discusses the feminization of labor migration, with a focus on\ndomestic workers. Finally, more recent contributions explore the\nrelationship between transnational migration and various forms of\nstructural oppression.\n\nEarly work by feminist philosophers typically argues that in sexist,\nracist, and class-divided societies, such as the United States,\nformally gender-neutral immigration policies often work to the\ndetriment of immigrant women (Narayan 1995, Wilcox 2005). For\ninstance, Uma Narayan argues that U.S. immigration legislation, such\nas the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendment (IMFA) heightens immigrant\nwomen\u2019s vulnerability to domestic violence. Before the IMFA was\nadopted, when a citizen or legal permanent resident married a\nforeigner and petitioned for permanent residency status for his\nspouse, legal residency was granted fairly quickly. The IMFA changed\nthis process, adding a two-year period of \u201cconditional\nresidency,\u201d during which the couple must remain married, and\nrequiring both spouses to petition for adjustment to permanent\nresidency status at the end of this waiting period. Narayan argues\nthat the IMFA increases the already significant barriers to escaping\nabusive marriages for immigrant women because it ties immigration\nstatus to marriage. This is especially problematic because immigrant\nwomen are generally \u201ceconomically, psychologically, and\nlinguistically dependent on their spouses\u201d (Narayan 1995,\n106).\n\nMore recent approaches to the feminization of global migration focus\non what Arlie Hochschild refers to as \u201cglobal care chains\u201d\n(Hochschild 2000, 2002) These chains, which link women across the\nworld, are established through the transnational exchange of domestic\nservices. Global care chains typically begin when relatively well-off\nnorthern or Western women enter the paid labor force and hire other\nwomen, usually poorer women from developing countries, to care for\ntheir children and other dependents. Migrant careworkers often must\nleave their own children behind in their home countries to be cared\nfor by even poorer careworkers or family members who may already have\ncare-giving responsibilities or be engaged with paid labor. Many\nfactors have contributed to the production of global care chains. In\nwealthy countries, the entry of women into the paid workforce, without\ncorresponding increases in public provisions for childcare or the\nredistribution of caring responsibilities between genders, has created\na high demand for paid domestic labor. In poor countries, the supply\nof domestic labor has been stimulated by a scarcity of well-paying\njobs and in many cases, a growing reliance on remittances. Cuts in\npublic services in southern countries have also encouraged women to\nmigrate as a means for earning the income they need to pay for private\nservices for their children, such as healthcare and education (Kittay,\n2008, 2009).\n\nGlobal care chains raise difficult issues for feminists, over and\nabove those raised by the background injustices that help to generate\nthem. In particular, some northern women are able to take advantage of\nincreased opportunities in the paid workforce only because southern\nwomen take up their socially-assigned domestic work, leaving their own\nfamilies in the care of others. Global care chains also contribute to\na larger, neo-colonial process \u2013 a \u201cglobal care\ndrain,\u201d in which care is systematically extracted from people in\npoor countries and transferred to individuals in affluent nations\n(Hochschild 2002). \n\nFeminist analyses of care chains typically argue that traditional\ntheories of justice have difficulty articulating the precise nature of\nthe harms or injustices involved in these phenomena. Most theories of\nglobal justice focus on unjust distributions of benefits and burdens\namong nations; however, it is not clear that care should be understood\nas a distributive good. Other features of care chains also resist\ntraditional ethical evaluation. Careworkers are not overtly coerced to\nmigrate, and each party in the global care chain appears to benefit\nfrom her participation: women who employ migrant caregivers are able\nto pursue opportunities in the public sphere; migrant caregivers are\nable to send money home; and their children and sending nations\nbenefit economically from these remittances. Migrant caregivers\nclearly are vulnerable to exploitation and workplace abuses, and they\nand their children suffer from their long absences. However, it could\nbe argued that each of these harms is counterbalanced by significant\ngains (Kittay, 2008, 2009). \n\nSome feminists argue that a feminist ethics of care is better suited\nto theorizing global care chains. In particular, care ethics\nemphasizes several key normative features and practices that\ntraditional theories tend to overlook: concrete specificity;\nacknowledgement of human dependence and vulnerability; and a\nrelational understanding of the self (Kittay, 2008). Care ethics\nfocuses on the ethical significance of relationships formed through\ndependency, such as those between caregivers and their charges. Kittay\nargues that intimate relationships between specific individuals, in\nwhich caring and affection are the norm, play a vital role in forming\nand sustaining individuals\u2019 self-identities. When these\nrelationships are disrupted, people suffer harm to their sense of self\nand self-respect. It follows that the harm involved in global care\nchains lies in their threat to the core relationships that are\nconstitutive of self-identity. \n\nTo protect dependents and caregivers from the harms that flow from\nfractured relationships, Kittay believes the right to give and receive\ncare should be recognized as a basic human right. Weir agrees that\ndismantling global care chains requires recognizing care as \u201can\nintrinsic good, a source of identity and meaning, which should be\nrecognized as a human right\u201d (Weir 2005, 313). However, both\nalso suggest that the recognition of a properly formulated right to\ncare would not eliminate global care chains on its own. Care chains\nwill persist until care, whether provided by professionals or within\nfamily networks, is socially recognized and economically supported.\nCaregiving responsibilities should also be more fairly distributed\nbetween genders and paid work should be organized with the recognition\nthat all workers\u2014male and female, rich and poor\u2014are\nresponsible for providing care. Unlocking care chains will also\nrequire mitigating the unjust background conditions that force women\nto choose between providing financial support for their families and\nbeing with and providing face to face care for them. To begin,\nimmigration policies must include specific provisions that make it\neasier for careworkers to bring their children or return home on a\nregular basis. Ultimately, however, eliminating care chains will\nrequire restructuring the global economy so that no one is forced to\nleave her home country to find decent working and living\nconditions.\n\nFinally, many recent feminist philosophical analyses of migration\nexplore the relationship between transnational migration and various\nforms of structural injustice, including gender oppression, racism and\nwhite supremacy, global economic inequality, militarization, and\nlegacies of colonialism. For instance, Wilcox argues that\ntransnational injustices generate strong moral claims to admission for\ncertain groups of prospective migrants. She advances two arguments for\nthis claim. The first contends that the principle of collective\npolitical responsibility obligates states to grant admission priority\nto prospective migrants who have been seriously harmed by their\npolicies, including economic policies that disproportionately harm\nwomen and marginalized workers in less affluent countries (Wilcox\n2007). Her second argument maintains that a commitment to relational\negalitarianism entails rejecting immigration restrictions that\ncontribute to oppressive transnational structural relations. In the\ncontext of gendered and racialized global supply chains, this includes\nthose restrictions on labor migration that increase workers\u2019\nvulnerability to exploitation, domination, violence, and\nmarginalization (Wilcox 2012).\n\nOther feminists focus on the relationship between structural injustice\nand refugee determination. In particular, they argue that legal\ndefinitions of refugeehood are insufficiently attentive to\ngender-based injustices, leading to the wrongful exclusion of\nvulnerable migrants who have strong moral claims to asylum. For\ninstance, Parekh argues that despite feminist gains in expanding\ninternational refugee conventions to recognize gender-related\npersecution, many states sill regard some forms of gender injustice as\ntoo apolitical or insignificant to warrant asylum (Parekh 2012).\nAccounting for the ways in which structural injustices modulate and\namplify gender-based harms can lead to more inclusive\u2014and better\njustified\u2014conceptualizations of gender persecution. Similarly,\nMeyers argues that an adequate understanding of the coercive nature of\nsevere poverty supports broadening the conventional definition of\nrefugeehood to include economic refugees, many of whom are women\n(Meyers 2014). Using the work of Iris Marion Young, Parekh further\nargues that understanding the harms from which refugees flee as forms\nof structural injustice grounds stronger moral obligations to help\nrefugees, both those who remain in the global South an those who seek\nadmission to Western states (Parekh 2017, 2020).\n\nFeminists also warn that migration regimes tend to reinforce existing\nforms of domination and even create new types of oppression. More\nspecifically, they argue that migration, refugee, and citizenship\ndiscourses, policies, and practices often draw upon pernicious\nstereotypes and entho-nationalist tropes to construct gendered and\nracialized subjects that are, in turn, mobilized to justify the\ndomination, exclusion, and marginalization of the individuals they are\nthought to represent. For instance, Cisneros argues that recent U.S.\npolitical debates about so-called \u201canchor babies\u201d draw\nupon sexist and nationalist conceptions of women as reproducers of the\nethnic nation, together with the racist notion of the \u201cillegal\nalien,\u201d to portray migrant women, particularly undocumented\nwomen, as an existential threat to the (white supremacist) nation\n(Cisneros 2013). This fictive subject is then taken to justify\ncoercive immigration and citizenship policies designed to exclude\nmigrant women of color and bar even U.S. born children of unauthorized\nmigrants from citizenship. Similarly, Reed-Sandoval argues that the\nU.S. immigration regime, which she views as a \u201csocial-historical\nracial project that served to reorganize and redistribute resources by\nmeans of branding certain bodies as \u2019illegals\u2019 in the\nUnited States,\u201d has generated a unique social identity, which\nshe calls \u201cbeing socially undocumented\u201d (Reed-Sandoval\n2020, 86). Being socially undocumented is distinct from being legally\nundocumented in that it does not necessarily involve a lack of legal\nauthorization, but rather membership in the social group of people who\nare subject to a common set of unjust, self-legitimating,\n\u201cillegalizing,\u201d immigration-related constraints, including\nracial profiling and police harassment, offensive stereotypes, and\nexploitative and degrading employment practices, on the basis of being\nperceived to be undocumented, regardless of immigration status.\nFinally, Oliver argues that that so-called humanitarian responses to\nthe contemporary refugee crisis are governed by a similar\nself-justifying logic, which she calls carceral humanitarianism\n(Oliver 2017a, 2017b). According to this logic, refugees can\njustifiably be sorted into groups based on their perceived risk to\nhost societies, made to prove the trauma that constitutes their case\nfor asylum, confined to detention centers and refugee camps\nindefinitely, subjected to violence and denied basic human rights, and\nin many cases, treated like terrorist threats or prisoners of war.\nMerged with rescue politics, which represents refugees as helpless\nvictims to be rescued and saved, carceral humanitarianism \u201cturns\nrefugees into criminals and charity cases simultaneously, which, in\nturn, becomes the troubling justification for locking them up or\nlocking them in, increasingly in dangerous, disease-ridden and sorely\ninadequate conditions\u201d (Oliver 2017b, 185).\n",
