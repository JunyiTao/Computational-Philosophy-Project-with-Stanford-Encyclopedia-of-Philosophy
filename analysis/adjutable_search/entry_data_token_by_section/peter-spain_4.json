    "main_text": "The Syncategoreumata\n5. Doctrinal Elements in Peter\u2019s Logic\n\nOne of the most important elements in Peter\u2019s logic concerns the\ndoctrine of supposition. The theory of supposition has its origins in\nthe twelfth century, when the medievals showed a growing interest in\nthe ways in which words function in different contexts. This way of\ndealing with the semantics of terms has been dubbed the\n\u201ccontextual approach\u201d (see de Rijk 1962\u201367, Vol. II,\nPart I, pp. 113\u2013117).\n\nThe primary semantic property of a word is its significatio,\nin Peter\u2019s definition, the \u201crepresentation of a thing by a\nword in accordance with convention\u201d. It is a natural property of\na word, the presentation of some (universal) content to the mind. The\nsignificatio of a word depends on its imposition, i.e., the\napplication originally given to the word in question. A word can have\nmore than one significatio, if it was originally applied to\ntwo or more distinct (universal) natures.\n\nThe counterpart of significatio, the formal constituent of\nevery meaning, is the word\u2019s capacity to \u201cstand for\u201d\ndifferent things (even though its significatio remains the\nsame), depending on the context in which it is used. In the early\nstages of the development of the theory on the properties of terms,\nthis feature of a word was called appellatio. For instance,\nthe words \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018horse\u2019 can be used to\nstand for different individual men or horses. But they can also stand\nfor themselves, e.g., when they are used in sentences such as\n\u2018man is a noun\u2019, or \u2018horse is a noun\u2019.\nMoreover, their meaning can differ according as the words are used in\ncombination with verbs of different tenses.\n\nIn the final stages of the development of the theory, the notion of\nsupposition becomes the general label that covers all the uses of a\nnoun (substantive or adjectival), to which other recognised properties\nof terms (appellatio, ampliatio and\nrestrictio) are subordinated.\n\nThe theory of properties of terms shows a radical inconsistency, which\nhas been explained as \u201cthe persistent hesitation of medieval\nlogicians between the domains of connotation (universals) and\ndenotation (individuals)\u201d (De Rijk 1982, pp. 167\u2013168).\nThis inconsistency runs throughout Peter\u2019s account of\nsupposition, and comes to the fore most prominently in what he says\nabout natural supposition (suppositio naturalis). The main\nproblem is in what way the property of natural supposition is related\nto a term\u2019s significatio, which was defined as the\nacceptance of a word for a thing (res). By this definition,\nthe significatio of the term \u2018man\u2019 covers both\nits intension and extension, i.e., the universal nature of man and the\nindividuals that have this nature in common. Suppositio\nnaturalis, on the other hand, is described as \u201cthe\nacceptance of a common term for all those things that can share in a\ncommon universal nature\u201d; for example, the term\n\u2018man\u2019 taken by itself by its very nature stands for all\nthe individuals that fall under it, whether they existed in the past,\nexist in the present or will exist in the future. From this definition\nand the example just presented it appears that the extensional\nfeatures of significatio and suppositio naturalis\noverlap. The latter kind of suppositio has been explained by\ninterpreters as the natural capacity of a significative word to stand\nfor something.\n\nThere is a more telling difference between significatio and\nsuppositio naturalis, however. Significatio is the\nnatural property of any significative term to represent things, owing\nto its original imposition, whereas a term\u2019s supposition only\nenters the scene when it is used. The expression \u201ctaken by\nitself\u201d (per se sumptus) found in Peter\u2019s account\nof suppositio naturalis, does not mean that no context is\nrequired, as is the case in significatio, but it merely\nindicates that for the moment the actual context is being disregarded.\nThe link between significatio and suppositio is the\nfollowing. When some word has acquired a signification by an\nimpositor (= someone who bestows a meaning upon a word), then\nit connotes a univeral nature or essence, and acquires a natural\ncapacity to stand for all the actual and possible individuals that\nshare in this common nature; it owes this capacity to its\nsignificatio. If, however, we disregard for a moment the\nactual context in which the term in question is used and look upon the\nterm as taken by itself (per se sumptus), then its\nsupposition covers its entire extension. If we take the factual\ncontext in which the term is used into consideration, then its\nextension becomes limited, owing to the context. The context, or more\nprecisely, the added significative term, can be of three kinds: the\nadded significative term can be a predicate of a proposition in which\nthe term at issue occurs, the added significative term can be an\nadjective, or the context can be of a social nature (see de Rijk 1971\nand de Rijk 1985, pp. 183\u2013203).\n\nThe distinction between significatio and suppositio\nnaturalis persisted throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies. Behind it is the fundamental view that regardless of\nwhether a word is used in some context or not, it always has a\nsignificatum, i.e., the universal nature or essence it\nsignifies, which can be separated from what the word comes to mean in\na specific context.\n\nBesides suppositio naturalis, Peter\u2019s (and other\nmedievals\u2019) conception of suppositio simplex also seems\nto hover between connotation and denotation. In the expression\nhomo est species the term homo has suppositio\nsimplex, but this is precisely too what the term homo\nsignifies. So there scarcely seems reason to separate signification\nfrom supposition on this score. The specific use of suppositio\nsimplex found in Peter of Spain and other medieval authors, as\nthe representation of a universal nature, is rejected later on by\nauthors such as William of Ockham. For the latter, the term\nhomo in the example just given has suppositio\nsimplex (for Ockham a special case of suppositio\nmaterialis) in that it stands for the mental concept of man\n(Kneale & Kneale 1978, pp. 268\u2013269).\n\nPeter of Spain\u2019s logical works are commonly characterised as\nrevealing a moderately \u2018realistic\u2019 outlook. To explain the\ncontents of linguistic expressions and the function of logical terms,\nhe is inclined to focus on their relationships to some extra-mental\nreality. This can be shown from the way in which he discusses the use\nof the word est (is), his account of suppositio\nsimplex, and the way he analyses the occurrence of the word\n\u2018necessarily\u2019 in propositions. Moreover, his conception of\nthe consecutive expression \u2018if\u2019 clearly shows his tendency\nto put the domains of reality and language on a par. (However, not all\nlinguistic expressions are connected with extramental reality.\nAlthough ontology always plays a role in his accounts of language, it\nwould appear that Peter is especially interested in the contents of\nlinguistic epressions. In that regard it seems more appropriate to\nspeak of an intensionalist semantics.)\n\nIn his Syncategoreumata, Peter analyses the significative\nfunction of the word \u2018is\u2019. To a certain extent his\nfindings are not confined to that term alone, but cover all verbs, in\nwhich the verb \u2018is\u2019 is always understood. The most\nremarkable feature about his discussion of \u2018is\u2019 is his\nfocus on the notion of composition. What he is particularly interested\nin is the kinds of things affirmative propositions featuring that verb\ncan refer to, in his words, the type of composition involved in such\npropositions.\n\nThe notion of \u2018composition\u2019 plays a prominent role in\nPeter\u2019s semantics. Before embarking on the specifics of the word\n\u2018is\u2019, he first looks into the compositiones\ninvolved in the noun and the verb. When it comes to the composition\ninvolved in the use of \u2018is\u2019, the starting-point for his\naccount is the question whether the expression \u2018is\u2019 in a\nproposition of the form \u2018S is P\u2019 implies the\n\u2018being\u2019 of the composition. Whether it does or not depends\non how we consider the composition. If we are talking about any\ncomposition whatsoever, in his words, the composition in general, the\ncomposition can indiscriminately be connected with beings and\nnon-beings. This is because we can talk about both things that are and\nthings that are not by making use of the same affirmative\npropositions. Hence anything expressed by a proposition of the form\n\u2018S is P\u2019 is a being in a certain sense (ens\nquodammodo). The type of composition he is referring to here is\nthe mental content of some affirmation, which is something that only\nhas being to a certain degree. However, the composition in general,\nthat is, the state of affairs involved in such expressions, is\nprimarily connected with being rather than non-being. It is when we\ntalk about non-beings, such as chimaeras, that being in a certain\nsense once again enters the scene. Hence a distinction of the types of\nbeing referred to, or the types of composition involved in affirmative\npropositions into being in the absolute sense (ens\nsimpliciter) and being in a certain sense (ens\nquodammodo). The difference between these two types of being is\nillustrated by the distinction between two types of inference: from\n\u2018A man is an animal\u2019, in which the composition involved is\na being in the absolute sense, it follows \u2018Therefore a man\nis\u2019, but from \u2018A chimaera is a non-being\u2019, in which\nthe composition is a being in a certain sense only, it does not follow\n\u2018Therefore a chimaera is\u2019.\n\nThe counterpart of Peter\u2019s discussion of composition is the\nsection on negation. Peter specifically goes into the question of what\nit is the negation denies. In his words, the negation removes the\ncomposition. The composition in this connection is identified with the\naffirmed state of affairs (res affirmata). What the negation\nremoves is not the state of affairs, but the affirmation that goes\nalong with it. The basis of both composition and negation turns out to\nbe the same state of affairs, i.e., something that is formulated in\nthe mind, to which we can assent or which we can deny to be the\ncase.\n\nThe focus on matters of ontology is evidenced in other portions of\nPeter\u2019s logic as well. For Peter, as for Henry of Ghent (who\nalso wrote a Syncategoreumata) the expression homo\n(man) in homo est animal (\u2018Man is an animal\u2019) has\nsimple supposition: it stands for the universal nature of humanity.\nAccordingly, the expression is necessarily true, even if no man should\nexist. The term \u2018necessarily\u2019 thus has ampliative force:\nit enables the subject term \u2018man\u2019 to refer to individuals\nnot only existing in the present ( which is the normal case when a\npresent-tense verb is used), but also to those of the past and the\nfuture. This analysis runs contrary to what is found in some other\nSyncategoreumata authors, like Johannes Pagus and Nicholas of\nParis, who maintain that the term \u2018necessarily\u2019 does not\nhave ampliative force. Hence the expression homo necessario est\nanimal (\u2018A man is necessarily an animal\u2019) is only\ntrue on the condition that a man exists.\n\nA similar point is made in connection with the use of modal terms. For\nPeter of Spain, logical necessity is based upon ontological necessity,\nor, the necessity of propositions has its foundation in the necessity\nof the things spoken about. Necessity is associated with different\ntypes of things, such as the relationships between certain concepts\n(such as genera and species), and the specific things the notions of\nwhich we come across in the different kinds of (scientific) knowledge\n(such as mathematical entities and their properties). His outlook on\nnecessity is clearly revealed in his analysis of the inference\nhomo necessario est animal; ergo Sortes necessario est\nanimal (\u2018A man is necessarily an animal; therefore Socrates\nis necessarily an animal\u2019). In his view the inference is not\nvalid, because a transition is made from necessary being to a being at\na certain time. For Peter then, the notion of necessity ultimately\nrefers to a necessary state of affairs in reality, something that is\nalways the case.\n\nA fusion of the domains of language and reality also turns up in\nPeter\u2019s account of the consecutive \u2018if\u2019, which he\nexplains as signifying causality. Like his contemporaries he looks\ninto the question whether from something impossible anything follows.\nIn his account, the notion of \u2018impossibility\u2019 can be taken\nin two ways, viz. impossibility as such (or absolute impossibility),\nwhich amounts to nothing, or some impossible state of affairs, that is\na combination of notions that do have a real foundation but are\nincompatible. From the latter type of impossibility, such as \u2018A\nman is an ass\u2019, something, but not anything can follow, e.g.,\n\u2018Therefore a man is an animal\u2019. From impossibilities as\nsuch, e.g., \u2018You know that you are a stone\u2019, nothing can\nfollow. The fundamental idea is that in order for something to follow\nfrom an antecedent, the antecedent in the consecutive relationship\nmust be a something (res) of some sort (see Spruyt 1993, pp.\n161\u2013193).\n",
