    "main_text": "Fundamental Concepts || Otherness, the Oedipus Complex, and Sexuation\n2.3 Otherness, the Oedipus Complex, and Sexuation\n\nThroughout his teachings, Lacan regularly utilizes the terms\n\u201cother\u201d (with a lower-case o) and \u201cOther\u201d\n(with a capital O). Given an understanding of Lacan\u2019s register\ntheory and the mirror stage (see\n 2.1\n and\n 2.2\n above), these terms can be clarified with relative ease and brevity.\nThe lower-case-o other designates the Imaginary ego and its\naccompanying alter-egos. By speaking of the ego itself as an\n\u201cother,\u201d Lacan further underscores its alien and\nalienating status as spelled out in the immediately preceding\nsub-section here (see\n 2.2\n above). Additionally, when relating to others as alter-egos, one does\nso on the basis of what one \u201cimagines\u201d about them (often\nimagining them to be \u201clike me,\u201d to share a set of\nlowest-common-denominator thoughts, feelings, and inclinations making\nthem comprehensible to me). These transference-style imaginings are\nfictions taming and domesticating the mysterious, unsettling\nforeignness of one\u2019s conspecifics, thereby rendering social life\ntolerable and navigable.\n\nThe capital-O Other refers to two additional types of otherness\ncorresponding to the registers of the Symbolic and the Real. The first\ntype of Other is Lacan\u2019s \u201cbig Other\u201d qua\nsymbolic order, namely, the overarching \u201cobjective spirit\u201d\nof trans-individual socio-linguistic structures configuring the fields\nof inter-subjective interactions. Relatedly, the Symbolic big Other\nalso can refer to (often fantasmatic/fictional) ideas of anonymous\nauthoritative power and/or knowledge (whether that of God, Nature,\nHistory, Society, State, Party, Science, or the analyst as the\n\u201csubject supposed to know\u201d [sujet suppos\u00e9\nsavoir] as per Lacan\u2019s distinctive account of analytic\ntransference). But, as already becomes evident in Lacan\u2019s first\nfew annual seminars of the early 1950s, there also is a Real dimension\nto Otherness. This particular incarnation of the Real, about which\nLacan goes into greatest detail when addressing both love and\npsychosis, is the provocative, perturbing enigma of the Other as an\nunknowable \u201cx,\u201d an unfathomable abyss of\nwithdrawn-yet-proximate alterity (in his 1895 Project for a\nScientific Psychology, to which Lacan refers repeatedly, Freud\ndepicts this alterity in the guise of the Nebenmensch als\nDing [Neighbor-as-Thing]).\n\nFor Lacan, the Freudian Oedipus complex stages the drama of the\nchild\u2019s laborious struggles to situate him/her-self\nvis-\u00e0-vis all three register-theoretic dimensions of\nOtherness. Thanks particularly to what he takes from his engagements\nwith structuralism, Lacan, throughout his career, is careful to avoid\na pseudo-Freudian reification of the bourgeois nuclear family, with a\nmother and father biologically sexed female and male respectively. The\nmaternal and paternal Oedipal personas are psychical-subjective\npositions, namely, socio-cultural (i.e., non-natural, non-biological)\nroles that potentially can be played by any number of possible persons\nof various sexes/genders.\n\nThat noted, in the Lacanian version of the Oedipus complex, the\nmaternal figure initially features for the infant as a Real Other\n(i.e., the Nebenmensch als Ding)\u2014more specifically, as\nan obscure omnipotent presence who is the source of all-important love\n(more will be said about Lacan\u2019s concept of love\u2014see\n 2.4.1\n below). But, because of the combination of her obscurity and\nimportance, the mother qua Real Other also is a source of\ndeeply unsettling anxiety for the very young child. She seemingly\nthreatens her offspring with being alternately too smothering or too\nwithdrawn, too much or not enough. In his/her anxiousness about\ncontrolling the ultimately uncontrollable presence (and absence) of\nthis mysterious and indispensable maternal Other, the child confronts\nthe question, \u201cWhat does the (m)Other want?\u201d The\ninfant\u2019s gradual formation of an ego as per the temporally\nelongated processes delineated in Lacan\u2019s account of the mirror\nstage (see\n 2.2\n above) is, in part, a response to this riddle (albeit in a broader\nsense, with the child constructing an ego-level identity informed by\nthe perceived wants of Others in addition to the mother, such as the\nfather).\n\nIn relation to the immediately preceding, Lacan\u2019s Oedipal father\nis an Other with both Symbolic and Real faces. On the Symbolic side,\nthe paternal figure represents the answer to the question, \u201cWhat\ndoes the maternal Other want?\u201d In Lacan\u2019s terminology, the\nchild\u2019s alighting upon the paternal third party in the family\nromance of the Oedipal social triangle as the solution to the puzzle\nof the maternal figure\u2019s enigmatic intentionality amounts to\n\u201cthe desire of the mother,\u201d as an unknown, being replaced\nby \u201cthe paternal metaphor.\u201d Directly connected to this,\nLacan (re)defines the phallus (which is not the penis) as the\nstructural function of whatever \u201cx\u201d the child\nhypothesizes the paternal figure possesses making him the focus of the\nmaternal figure\u2019s desire, that is, the possession enabling the\nfather to domesticate and control the mother\u2019s otherwise\nunpredictable desire. Also at the level of the Symbolic, the paternal\nfunction involves bringing to bear within the child\u2019s familial\nsphere the disciplinary and prohibitory features of the family\u2019s\nenveloping symbolic order as their socio-linguistic milieu (this\nentails such impositions as weaning, toilet training, exogamy, and\n\u201ccastration\u201d in the Freudian-Lacanian sense\u2014see\n 2.4.1\n below). As for Real Otherness here, this would be the version of the\npaternal figure mythically portrayed by Freud in Totem and\nTaboo (1913), namely, the tyrannical, enjoying-without-restraints\n\u201cprimal father\u201d (Urvater) of the savage fraternal\nhorde, the exception to the otherwise universal law of (symbolic)\ncastration. This Real Urvater arguably is a fantasy-construct\ngenerated in and by the Oedipus complex, with the child imagining an\nobscene, dark, jouissance-saturated underbelly behind the\nSymbolic fa\u00e7ade of paternal authority and its rules.\n\nThe child\u2019s identifications with maternal and paternal Others\nare distributed across Real and Symbolic dimensions. However,\ndifferent subjects-in-formation distribute their identifications\ndifferently. Freud, in his reconsiderations of earlier renditions of\nthe Oedipus complex, came to highlight an asymmetry between Oedipal\ndynamics for young boys and girls, repudiating the idea of girls\nundergoing an \u201cElectra complex\u201d as the symmetrical\ncounterpart to the Oedipus complex. Skipping over a lot of details and\ncutting a long story short, the later Lacan, when taking up the topic\nof sexual difference, preserves this Freudian emphasis on asymmetry.\nIn this vein, Lacan introduces the idea of sexuation as the Real of\nsexual difference, namely, as an impenetrable, opaque facticity of\nthis difference continually prompting and yet perpetually resisting\nbeing adequately translated into the terms of Imaginary and Symbolic\nrealities. As neither biologically given sex nor socially constructed\ngender, the Real of sexuation is what is responsible for the absence\nof an exhaustively representable, symbolizable natural and/or cultural\nrelationship between sexuated positions (as per Lacan\u2019s\nstatement, \u201cIl n\u2019y a pas de rapport\nsexuel\u201d). The structural-psychical positions of masculinity\nand femininity embody constitutively out-of-synch and inherently\nincommensurable subjective stances, incompatible (yet interacting)\narrangements of distinct sorts of libidinal economies.\n",
