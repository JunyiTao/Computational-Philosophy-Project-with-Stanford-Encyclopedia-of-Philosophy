    "main_text": "The Origin and Nature of the Soul\n1. The Origin and Nature of the Soul\n\nIn one of his best-known introductory works, Enumeration of the\nSciences (I\u1e25\u1e63\u0101\u2019 al-Ul\u016bm),\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (ES: 87) explains that the eighth part of the\nscience of physics is devoted to what is common to the different kinds\nof animals, namely, the soul, and is studied in Aristotle\u2019s\nBook of Animals and in On the Soul.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b describes the soul as Aristotle did in On\nthe Soul 2.1, 412a19, that is, as the form or actualization\n(\u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 /\nantal\u0101shiy\u0101 or at-tam\u0101m) of a natural\norganic body that potentially has\n life.[1]\n Living beings have different faculties: the nutritive, sensitive,\nappetitive, and rational faculties. The presence of these capacities\nin living beings is due to the different kinds of soul. The origin of\nthese souls and their capacities is explained by\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b from a metaphysical, cosmological, and\nbiological perspective.\n\nIn fact, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s entire philosophy, including\nhis psychological and epistemological views, must be understood in\nlight of his ontological and cosmological worldview, a matter that has\nbeen a source of considerable debate. In The Political Regime\nand The Virtuous City, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b provides a\nmetaphysical and ontological explanation of the structure of the\nuniverse, combining Neoplatonic emanationism and Aristotelian views on\nthe celestial spheres (M. Mahdi 2001: 6\u201311; 121\u2013124).\nOthers have argued that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s account\nconcerning these matters in both treatises should not be taken\nliterally, but as a political metaphor of the kind of regimes that can\nbe conceived in political philosophy. In contrast, P. Vallat and D.\nJanos have rejected this view and have shown that far from a mere\nrhetorical strategy, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s cosmology\nconstitutes the foundation of his political thought. Though these\ndifferent approaches have motivated controversial interpretations of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s philosophy, this article concurs with\nthe interpretation of Vallat (2004: 85\u2013128) and Janos (2012:\n38\u201343). To take al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s cosmology as a\ntrue component of his philosophy has serious implications for the\nunderstanding of his philosophical psychology:\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s conception of the soul and intellect\ncannot be understood without taking into account his cosmological\nmodel. In this way it becomes clear that his psychology and cosmology\ntaken together motivate his political philosophy. \n\nAs D. Janos (2010: 19\u201344) has shown in depth,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s cosmology draws on the Proclus\nArabus (mainly the Ma\u1e25d al-khayr [Elements of\nTheology]), late ancient commentators such as Alexander,\nSimplicius, Themistius, and in general from the Neoplatonica\nArabica, including the Plotinus Arabus (Janos 2012:\n4\u20136; 11\u201337; D\u2019Ancona 2014). Both The Political\nRegime and The Virtuous City are key sources for the\nreconstruction of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s cosmology which\nconsists in a hierarchical emanationist model constituted by six\nprinciples: (1) the First Existent or First Cause, (2) the second\nintellects, (3) the active (or agent) intellect, (4) the soul, (5)\nform, and (6) matter (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KS: 31; PR: 29). The\nFirst Cause is one and unique, precluding any multiplicity, whereas\nall other principles are multiple. The first three principles are not\nbodies, nor are in a body; they are immaterial and separate, whereas\nthe three last principles are not bodies but are connected to the\nbodies. Notice that the soul is one of the principles that will be\noriginated through the emanative process and is described as a\nprinciple that is not a body in itself but is in a body.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains that the universe contains six kinds\nof body. In decreasing order of perfection, there are: (1) celestial\nbodies, (2) rational animals, (3) non-rational animals, (4) plants,\n(5) minerals, and (6) the four elements (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KS:\n31; PR: 29).\n\nAccording to the emanation (fay\u1e0d) process described by\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, the existence of every being proceeds from\nthe First Existent (mawj\u016bd al-awwal), which is perfect,\neternal, everlasting, uncaused, free of matter and without form, with\nno purpose or aim external to itself, with no partner or opposite, and\nindivisible (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 56\u201389). The First\nExistent is distinguished from all other beings due to its oneness,\nwhich is its essence. This description seems very close to the\nNeoplatonic conception of the One, but it is not exactly the same.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b instead argues that, given that this First\nExistent is not in matter and has no matter, it should be an actual\nintellect (\u2018aql bi\u2019l fi\u2018l). The First\nExistent is also intelligible (ma\u2018q\u016bl) through its\nsubstance, and its identity consists in simultaneously being the act,\nthe subject, and the object of its own intellection\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 70\u201371). This description is based\non Aristotle\u2019s characterization of the unmoved mover in\nMetaphysics Lambda as thought thinking itself.\n\nEvery existent comes to be, according to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, by\nthe First Existent. This takes place through a sort of expansion or\nemanation through which the First Existent necessarily gives existence\nto every being in the universe. Yet this does not imply any addition\nto its own perfection. In the initial emanation, from the First\nExistent proceed the second intellects. These intellects themselves,\nthrough the apprehension of themselves and the First Existent, are in\nturn the cause of the celestial bodies. In The Political\nRegime al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b mentions that the number of\nsecond intellects or second causes is identical to the number of\ncelestial spheres from the highest, the first heaven, to the last,\nnamely, the sphere of the moon (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KS: 32; PR:\n29). In The Virtuous City he explicitly enumerates nine\nspheres starting with the first heaven, and then the fixed stars,\nSaturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the moon\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 100\u2013105). There is a tenth\nintellect, namely, the active intellect (\u2018aql al-fa\n\u2018\u2018\u0101l), whose activity is very relevant mainly\nfor two reasons: (1) this intellect governs together with the\ncelestial spheres the sublunary world, and is even involved in the\nprocesses of generation and corruption (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI:\n29\u201330; OI:\n 75);[2]\n (2) furthermore, as will be explained in the fourth section, this\nintellect also provides the first principles of understanding through\nwhich human beings can attain happiness (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC:\n204\u2013205).\n\nThus far we have explained the first three principles in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s emanationist model (the First Cause,\nthe second intellects, and the active intellect). The other three\nprinciples (the soul, the matter and the form) have in common their\nconnection to the different bodies that comprise the universe. In\nThe Political Regime al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains these\nprinciples following a particular order: first the soul, then the\nmatter, and finally the form; in The Virtuous City, however,\nhe first explains what matter and form are and subsequently gives a\nprecise account of the soul and its faculties\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 134\u2013163). This latter approach is\nclearer for two main reasons: (1) the long explanation that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b provides concerning the origin of matter from\nthe most imperfect, that is, prime matter, to the most excellent,\nnamely, rational animals, sets forth a precise framework for the\nunderstanding of the rational human soul; (2) the explanation\nconcerning the relation between matter and form gives us a better\nunderstanding of the relation between body and soul. Matter is the\nsubstratum of the form and, hence, the form does not have subsistence\nby itself since it needs matter; however, matter only exists due to\nthe form (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 108\u2013109).\n\nConcerning the origin and composition of matter,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains that the circular motion of the\ncelestial spheres generates prime matter (al-madda\nal-\u016bl\u0101), which is common to all bodies in the sublunary\nworld. The four elements proceed from prime matter and, when these\nelements combine and mix in different ways and undergo the influence\nof the heavenly bodies, they generate numerous kinds of bodies:\nminerals, plants, non-rational animals, and rational animals\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC:\n 112\u2013115).[3]\n Given that matter is the substratum of form, the different forms\nappear when the combination of the elements takes place, giving rise\nto different kinds of bodies. As there are different kinds of bodies,\nthere are also different kinds of forms, some of them of lower\nperfection, as the form of minerals or plants, and others more\nperfect, as the form of rational animals. This perfection is given by\nthe faculties that each body has according to its natural disposition:\nwhile plants have basic faculties such as nutrition or reproduction,\nrational animals have a higher faculty, the intellect, which enables\nhuman beings to attain intelligibles in act.\n\nIn The Political Regime al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b deals with\nthe relation between matter and form, and explains that form is the\nactualization of matter in the sense that form is more excellent than\nmatter; however, matter is the substratum of form and without matter\nthere is no form (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KS: 39; PR: 36). As can be\nseen, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is a partisan of Aristotelian\nhylomorphism. This relates to his understanding of the soul as the\nform or actualization of the body and thus perishable with the body.\nFor al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, as for Aristotle, the soul is\nresponsible for the capacities or operations of the human body. When\nreferring to the human soul, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b holds that the\nrational part can come to realize itself to such a degree of\nperfection that it no longer has need of the body, and can come very\nclose to reaching the status of a separate being\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KS: 42; PR: 38). In other words, the\nrational part is able to separate itself from its other\nfaculties\u2014sensitive, appetitive, and imaginative\u2014in order\nto attain perfection by transforming itself into an eternal\nimperishable intellect. As can be seen, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nrenders an account on the origin of the soul and its faculties by\nmeans of a rather complex ontological and cosmological process,\nthrough which the human soul progressively attains greater perfection.\nNevertheless, before explaining what this perfection consists in, I\nshall discuss al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s understanding of the\nfaculties of the soul and their function. \n",
