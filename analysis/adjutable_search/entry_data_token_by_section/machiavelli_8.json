    "main_text": "The Character of Republican Leaders\n9. Machiavelli\u2019s Place in Western Thought\n\nWhat is \u201cmodern\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d in\nMachiavelli\u2019s thought? What is Machiavelli\u2019s\n\u201cplace\u201d in the history of Western ideas? The body of\nliterature debating this question, especially in connection with\nThe Prince and Discourses, has grown to truly\nstaggering proportions. John Pocock (1975), for example, has traced\nthe diffusion of Machiavelli\u2019s republican thought throughout the\nso-called Atlantic world and, specifically, into the ideas that guided\nthe framers of the American constitution. Paul Rahe (2008) argues for\na similar set of influences, but with an intellectual substance and\nsignificance different from Pocock. For Pocock, Machiavelli\u2019s\nrepublicanism is of a civic humanist variety whose roots are to be\nfound in classical antiquity; for Rahe, Machiavelli\u2019s\nrepublicanism is entirely novel and modern. The\n\u201cneo-Roman\u201d thinkers (most prominently, Pettit, Skinner\nand Viroli) appropriate Machiavelli as a source of their principle of\n\u201cfreedom as non-domination\u201d, while he has also been put to\nwork in the defense of democratic precepts and values (McCormick\n2011). Likewise, cases have been made for Machiavelli\u2019s\npolitical morality, his conception of the state, his religious views,\nand many other features of his work as the distinctive basis for the\noriginality of his contribution.\n\nYet few firm conclusions have emerged within scholarship. (The\nunsettled state of play in current research on Machiavelli is well\nrepresented in Johnston et al. 2017.) One plausible explanation for\nthe inability to resolve these issues of \u201cmodernity\u201d and\n\u201coriginality\u201d is that Machiavelli was in a sense trapped\nbetween innovation and tradition, between via antiqua and\nvia moderna (to adopt the usage of Janet Coleman 1995), in a\nway that generated internal conceptual tensions within his thought as\na whole and even within individual texts (Nederman 2009). This\nhistorical ambiguity permits scholars to make equally convincing cases\nfor contradictory claims about his fundamental stance without\nappearing to commit egregious violence to his doctrines. This point\ndiffers from the accusation made by certain scholars that Machiavelli\nwas fundamentally inconsistent (see Black 2022) or simply driven by\n\u201clocal\u201d agendas (Celenza 2015). Rather, salient features\nof the distinctively Machiavellian approach to politics should be\ncredited to an incongruity between historical circumstance and\nintellectual possibility. What makes Machiavelli a troubling yet\nstimulating thinker is that, in his attempt to draw different\nconclusions from the commonplace expectations of his audience, he\nstill incorporated important features of precisely the conventions he\nwas challenging. In spite of his repeated assertion of his own\noriginality (for instance, Prince CW 10, 57\u201358), his\ncareful attention to preexisting traditions meant that he was never\nfully able to escape his intellectual confines. Thus, Machiavelli\nought not really to be classified as either purely an\n\u201cancient\u201d or a \u201cmodern\u201d, but instead deserves\nto be located in the interstices between the two (a point recently\nunderscored by Pedull\u00e0 2023, for whom \u201cMachiavelli\nresembles the mythical Janus, the Roman god of openings and ending\n\u2026\u201d [xi]).\n",
