    "main_text": "\n\nDeterminables and determinates are in the first instance type-level\nproperties that stand in a distinctive specification relation: the\n\u2018determinable-determinate\u2019 relation (for short,\n\u2018determination\u2019). For example, color is a\ndeterminable having red, blue, and other specific\nshades of color as determinates; shape is a determinable\nhaving rectangular, oval, and other specific\n(including many irregular) shapes as determinates; mass is a\ndeterminable having specific mass values as determinates. Reflecting\nthat determinables admit of different degrees or levels of\nspecification, characterization of a property as determinable or\ndeterminate is typically relative; for example, red is a\ndeterminate of color and a determinable of\nscarlet.\n\nThe determination relation appears to differ from other specification\nrelations. In contrast with the genus-species and conjunct-conjunction\nrelations, where the more specific property can be understood as a\nconjunction of the less specific property and some independent\nproperty or properties, a determinate is not naturally treated in\nconjunctive terms (red is not a conjunctive property having\ncolor and some other property or properties as conjuncts);\nand in contrast with the disjunction-disjunct relation, where\ndisjuncts may be dissimilar and compatible (as with red or\nround), determinates of a determinable (at a given level of\nspecificity) are both similar and incompatible (red and\nblue are similar in both being colors; nothing can be\nsimultaneously and uniformly both red and blue).\nSupporting this latter contrast is that (as per Sorites phenomena, and\nordinary perceptual experience of macro-objects) our perceptions of\nproperties such as color and shape do not appear to\nbe of maximal determinates, as would be the case if determinables were\ndisjunctions of determinates (since every instance of a disjunction is\nan instance of one of its disjuncts).\n\nOf course, appearances can be deceiving, and there are strategies for\ntreating determinables and their mode of specification in deflationary\nterms. Whether these strategies succeed or fail is no small matter.\nFor the seemingly distinctive character of determinables and\ndetermination may enter into the best case for the claim that there\nare genuine features of reality that are less than maximally\nspecific\u2014a claim which, if true, has profound implications for a\nwide range of philosophical issues.\n\nWhat follows is organized into five sections. In \u00a71, we trace key\npoints of the historical trajectory whereby determination came to be\nseen as a distinctive form of specification. In \u00a72, we present\nthe commonly advanced features of determinables, determinates, and\ntheir relation; here also we discuss extensions of the (realistically\nconstrued) relation to ontological categories beyond properties. In\n\u00a73, we sketch the main anti-realist, reductionist, and\nnon-reductionist accounts of determinables and determinates, saying\nhow these aim to accommodate the seeming features of determinables and\ndeterminates, and flagging key concerns and responses; here also we\ndiscuss certain accounts of the structure or logic of determination.\nIn \u00a74, we consider reasons for and against thinking that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. In \u00a75, we\npresent three applications of these notions, on which the distinctive\nfeatures of determinables and/or determinates are seen as key to\nunderstanding physical laws of nature, mental/higher-level causation,\nand metaphysical (including quantum) indeterminacy.\n",
