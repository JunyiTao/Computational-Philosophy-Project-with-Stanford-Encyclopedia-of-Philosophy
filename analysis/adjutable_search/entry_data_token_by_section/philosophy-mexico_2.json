    "main_text": "The Philosophy of the Conquest and Renaissance Humanism\n3. The Philosophy of the Conquest and Renaissance Humanism\n\nThe conquest of the Americas and, in particular, of the Aztec Empire,\nwas an event of global significance that immediately challenged\nSpanish-language philosophers and theologians to reflect on what it\nmeans to be human, whether war, colonization, and slavery are ever\njustified and under what conditions, as well as the meaning of and\nrelationship between \u201cAmerica\u201d and\n\u201cEurope\u201d.\n\nA professor at the University of Salamanca, Francisco de Vitoria\n(1483\u20131546) questioned whether the Spanish colonization of the\nAmerican continent constituted \u201cjust war\u201d. Unlike other\nauthors who had witnessed the cruelty of Spanish colonization\nfirsthand and who doubted whether conquest and colonization could ever\nbe rationally justified, Vitoria never traveled to America and thus\nhad no direct experience in the matter.\n\nFather Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas (1484\u20131566) did have\nextensive experience in Mexico and objected to Spanish colonization.\nIn 1550\u20131551, he engaged in a famous debate with Juan\nGin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda about whether the indigenous people\nwere fully human. Las Casas claimed that the natives were rational\nbeings, not unlike Europeans, and should be considered fully human\nwith the same right to be protected under natural law, to choose their\nown form of government, and to be free. Consequently, Las Casas\nbelieved that Spaniards did not have the right to enslave or otherwise\nrule them. The ideas of Las Casas proved crucial in the Laws of the\nIndies (1542), which required certain protections of indigenous people\nof the Americas.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the influence of\nErasmus\u2019 humanism was manifest in authors who wanted to return\nto the doctrinal simplicity and moral purity of early Christianity, a\nneo-stoic reconciliation of Plato and Aristotle that emphasized human\ndignity. We can also trace the influence of Thomas More\u2019s\nUtopia, which inspired social experiments conducted in New\nSpain.\n\nFather Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga (1468\u20131548) founded El Colegio\nde Tlatelolco, a school in which the natives were instructed in\nChristian theology and philosophy. He also helped install the first\npress in 1539, and he conceived the creation of the Royal and\nPontifical University of Mexico (the predecessor to the National\nUniversity of Mexico today). Zum\u00e1rraga wrote several books that\nexhibit the influence of Erasmus and of the Spanish humanist\nConstantino Ponce, who was a chaplain in Charles I\u2019s court and\nlater accused by the Inquisition of being a Protestant.\n\nVasco de Quiroga (died 1565) founded hospital-towns in\nMichoac\u00e1n that were inspired by the communities described in\nThomas More\u2019s Utopia. According to Vasco de Quiroga,\nthe natives lived in a golden age as described by Lucian of Samosata\nin his Saturnalia.\n\nPhillip II of Spain sent Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez (died 1578) to\nstudy the flora and fauna of New Spain. Once in Mexico,\nHern\u00e1ndez wrote several philosophical works with commentaries\non Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.\n\nOf course European intellectuals were not alone in thinking about the\npolitical and intellectual consequences of conquest and colonization.\nTo represent the native perspective on conquest and colonization,\nMiguel Le\u00f3n Portilla published La visi\u00f3n de los\nvencidos (The Broken Spears in its English translation)\nin 1959. And in 1958, Edmundo O\u2019Gorman (1906\u20131995)\npublished La invenci\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica, which\nchallenges the assumption that Europeans \u201cdiscovered\u201d\nAmerica, that is, that America was an undiscovered location that\nColumbus both knew of and went in search of. Instead, as O\u2019\nGorman points out, Columbus went in search of Asia and only\naccidentally happened upon what Europeans would later call\n\u201cAmerica\u201d ex post facto, making both the idea of\nAmerica, its so-called discovery, and European attitudes toward it and\nits inhabitants, a construction based entirely on European assumptions\nand beliefs.\n",
