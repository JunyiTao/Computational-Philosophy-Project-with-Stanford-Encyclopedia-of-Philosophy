    "main_text": "The Status of Instrumental Rationality || The Only Kind of Practical Rationality?\n4.1 The Only Kind of Practical Rationality?\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that instrumental rationality is the only kind\nof practical rationality. But what exactly is being claimed?\n\nIs the claim about rational incoherence? Then it would seem to be the\nclaim that the only kind of practical, rational incoherence is\ninstrumental incoherence. But this claim would have to contend with\nthe idea that there are other kinds of practical, rational\nincoherence. For example, it seems incoherent to refuse to intend what\none believes one ought to intend. It also seems incoherent to intend\nto X and to intend to Y when one believes that if\none Xs, one will not Y.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might be about reason: that all (practical)\nreason is, in some sense, instrumental. On one interpretation, the\nclaim would say that the only true claim about reason is some\nprinciple of instrumental transmission. But this would seem to\nimply that there are no practical reasons at all. Unless there is some\nother true claim about reasons for \u201cends\u201d understood as\nactions, there is nothing to be transmitted. (For arguments that there\nwould need to be another kind of rationality, see Nozick 1993;\nKorsgaard 1997; Hampton 1998; Hubin 1999; Lavin 2004.)\n\nA different interpretation is that all reasons are\ninstrumental. In other words, the reason for any action (or\nintention) can be expressed as: the action will help to bring about\nsome \u201cend,\u201d where \u201cend\u201d is understood not as\nan action, but instead as some valuable or desired state of affairs.\nThe Desire-Based Theory is committed to this claim. But not all\nValue-Based Theories are. The reason for an action, for example, might\nbe that it honors or respects something of value, even though it does\nnot help to bring it about.\n\nA final interpretation is that all deliberation is of means.\nIn other words, there is no place for significant evaluative or\nnormative reflection on the ultimate ends that one has reason to bring\nabout. The Desire-Based Theory seems committed to this claim, at least\nto some extent. According to the Desire-Based Theory, reflection on\nthe ultimate ends that one has reason to bring about is just\nreflection on the non-normative matter of what one in fact desires,\nplus grasp of the Desire-Based Theory itself. On the other hand,\nValue-Based theories seem committed to rejecting this claim, even\nthose Value-Based Theories that accept that all reasons are\ninstrumental in the sense discussed in the previous paragraph. For\nwhether a certain state of affairs is valuable, and so an end that one\nhas reason to bring about, is itself the object of significant\nevaluative thought. (Note that it is a mistake to express the present\nidea, that all deliberation is of means, as the idea that one cannot\nbe criticized for ends. According to the Desire-Based Theory,\none can be criticized for what one intends or acts\nto bring about, insofar as it is not the realization of one\u2019s\nstrongest, present intrinsic desires. And even according to\nValue-Based theories, one cannot be criticized for what one has\nreason to bring about.)\n\nNotice that the Desire-Based Theory is committed to the claim that\npractical reason is exclusively instrumental, on these two last\ninterpretations. This may explain why the Desire-Based Theory is often\nsimply identified with \u201cinstrumental rationality,\u201d and why\nthe claim that \u201cthe only kind of practical rationality is\ninstrumental rationality\u201d is sometimes just meant as an\nassertion of the Desire-Based Theory.\n",
