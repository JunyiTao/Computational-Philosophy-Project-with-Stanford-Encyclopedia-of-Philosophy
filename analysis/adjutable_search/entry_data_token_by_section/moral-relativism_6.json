Mixed Positions: A Rapprochement between Relativists and Objectivists?\n\nDiscussions of moral relativism often assume (as mostly has been\nassumed here so far) that moral relativism is the correct account of\nall moral judgments or of none. But perhaps it is the correct account\nof some moral judgments but not others or, more vaguely, the best\naccount of morality vis-\u00e0-vis these issues would acknowledge\nboth relativist and objectivist elements. Such a mixed position might\nbe motivated by some of the philosophical questions already raised\n(recall also the suggestion in the section on\n experimental philosophy\n that some people may be \u201cmeta-ethical pluralists\u201d). On\nthe empirical level, it might be thought that there are many\nsubstantial moral disagreements but also some striking moral\nagreements across different societies. On the metaethical plane, it\nmight be supposed that, though many disagreements are not likely to be\nrationally resolved, other disagreements may be (and perhaps that the\ncross-cultural agreements we find have a rational basis). The first\npoint would lead to a weaker form of DMR The second point,\nthe more important one, would imply a modified form of MMR\n(see the suggestions in the last paragraph of\n section 4).\n This approach has attracted some support, interestingly, from both\nsides of the debate: relativists who have embraced an objective\nconstraint, and (more commonly) objectivists who have allowed some\nrelativist dimensions. Here are some prominent examples of these mixed\nmetaethical outlooks.\n\nDavid Copp (1995) maintains that it is true that something is morally\nwrong only if it is wrong in relation to the justified moral code of\nsome society, and a code is justified in a society only if the society\nwould be rationally required to select it. Since which code it would\nbe rationally required to select depends in part on the non-moral\nvalues of the society, and since these values differ from one society\nto another, something may be morally wrong for one society but not for\nanother. Copp calls this position a form of moral relativism. However,\nhe believes this relativism is significantly mitigated by the fact\nthat which code a society is rationally required to select also\ndepends on the basic needs of the society. Copp thinks all societies\nhave the same basic needs. For example, every society has a need to\nmaintain its population and system of cooperation from one generation\nto the next. Moreover, since meeting these basic needs is the most\nfundamental factor in determining the rationality of selecting a code,\nCopp thinks the content of all justified moral codes will tend to be\nquite similar. For instance, any such code will require that\npersons\u2019s basic needs for such things as physical survival,\nself-respect and friendship be promoted (these are said to be\nnecessary for minimal rational agency). The theory is mixed insofar as\nthe rationality of selecting a code depends partly on common features\nof human nature (basic needs) and partly on diverse features of\ndifferent societies (values). Whether or not justified moral codes\n(and hence moral truths) would tend to be substantially similar,\ndespite differences, as Copp argues, would depend on both the claim\nthat all societies have the same basic needs and the claim that these\nneeds are much more important than other values in determining which\nmoral code it is rational for a society to select.\n\nWong (1996) defended a partly similar position, though one intended to\nallow for greater diversity in correct moral codes. He argued that\nmore than one morality may be true, but there are limits on which\nmoralities are true. The first point is a form of metaethical\nrelativism: It says one morality may be true for one society and a\nconflicting morality may be true for another society. Hence, there is\nno one objectively correct morality for all societies. The second\npoint, however, is a concession to moral objectivism. It acknowledges\nthat objective factors concerning human nature and the human situation\nshould determine whether or not, or to what extent, a given morality\ncould be one of the true ones. The mere fact that a morality is\naccepted by a society does not guarantee that it has normative\nauthority in that society. For example, given our biological and\npsychological make-up, not just anything could count as a good way of\nlife. Again, given that most persons are somewhat self-interested and\nthat society requires some measure of cooperation, any plausible\nmorality will include a value of reciprocity (good in return for good\non some proportional basis). Since these objective limitations are\nquite broad, they are insufficient in themselves to establish a\nspecific and detailed morality: Many particular moralities are\nconsistent with them, and the choice among these moralities must be\ndetermined by the cultures of different societies.\n\nWong has developed this approach at length in more recent work (2006).\nHis \u201cpluralistic relativism\u201d continues to emphasize that\nthere are universal constraints on what could be a true morality. The\nconstraints are based on a naturalistic understanding of human nature\nand the circumstances of human life. For Wong, given a variety of\nhuman needs and the depth of self-interest, morality\u2019s function\nis to promote both social co-operation and individual flourishing. In\naddition, morality requires that persons have both effective agency\nand effective identity, and these can only be fostered in personal\ncontexts such as the family. Hence, the impersonal perspective must be\nlimited by the personal perspective. Any true morality would have to\nrespect requirements such as these.\n\nNonetheless, according to Wong, the universal constraints are\nsufficiently open-ended that there is more than one way to respect\nthem. Hence, there can be more than one true morality. This is\npluralistic relativism. For Wong, the different true moralities need\nnot be, and typically are not, completely different from one another.\nIn fact, they often share some values (such as individual rights and\nsocial utility), but assign them different priorities.\n\nWong presents pluralistic relativism as the best explanation of what\nhe calls \u201cmoral ambivalence,\u201d the phenomenon of morally\ndisagreeing with someone while recognizing that the person is still\nreasonable in making the conflicting judgment\u2014to the point that\none\u2019s confidence in being uniquely right is shaken. The extent\nto which moral ambivalence is widespread is an empirical question\n (see section 3).\n In any case, Wong presents a sustained and detailed argument\nthat an empirically-based understanding of the nature and conditions\nof human life both limits and underdetermines what a true morality\ncould be. In many respects, his position is the most sophisticated\nform of relativism developed to date, and it has the resources to\nconfront a number of the issues raised in the last section (for some\ncritical responses to Wong and his replies, see Xiao and Huang 2014;\nfor more recent discussion, see Li 2019, Vicente and Arrieta\n2016, and Wong 2020).\n\nA somewhat similar mixed position has been advanced, though more\ntentatively, by Foot (2002a and 2002b; see also Scanlon 1995 and 1998:\nch. 8). She argued that there are conceptual limitations on what could\ncount as a moral code (as seen in\n section 4),\n and that there are common features of human nature that set limits on\nwhat a good life could be. For these reasons, there are some objective\nmoral truths\u2014for example, that the Nazi attempt to exterminate\nthe Jews was morally wrong. However, Foot maintained, these\nconsiderations do not ensure that all moral disagreements can be\nrationally resolved. Hence, in some cases, a moral judgment may be\ntrue by reference to the standards of one society and false by\nreference to the standards of another society\u2014but neither true\nnor false in any absolute sense (just as we might say with respect to\nstandards of beauty).\n\nFoot came to this mixed view from the direction of objectivism (in the\nform of a virtue theory), and it might be contended by some\nobjectivists that she has conceded too much. Since there are objective\ncriteria, what appear as rationally irresolvable disagreements might\nbe resolvable through greater understanding of human nature. Or the\nobjective criteria might establish that in some limited cases it is an\nobjective moral truth that conflicting moral practices are both\nmorally permissible. In view of such considerations, objectivists\nmight argue, it is not necessary to have recourse to the otherwise\nproblematic notion of relative moral truth.\n\nA position related to Foot\u2019s has been advanced by Martha\nNussbaum (1993). With explicit reference to Aristotle, she argued that\nthere is one objectively correct understanding of the human good, and\nthat this understanding provides a basis for criticizing the moral\ntraditions of different societies. The specifics of this account are\nexplained by a set of experiences or concerns, said to be common to\nall human beings and societies, such as fear, bodily appetite,\ndistribution of resources, management of personal property, etc.\nCorresponding to each of these is a conception of living well, a\nvirtue, namely the familiar Aristotelian virtues such as courage,\nmoderation, justice, and generosity. Nussbaum acknowledged that there\nare disagreements about these virtues, and she raised an obvious\nrelativist objection herself: Even if the experiences are universal,\ndoes human nature establish that there is one objectively correct way\nof living well with respect to each of these areas? In response,\nNussbaum conceded that sometimes there may be more than one\nobjectively correct conception of these virtues and that the\nspecification of the conception may depend on the practices of a\nparticular community.\n\nAs with Foot, Nussbaum came to this mixed position from the\nobjectivist side of the debate. Some moral objectivists may think she\nhas given up too much, and for a related reason many moral relativists\nmay believe she has established rather little. For example, bodily\nappetites are indeed universal experiences, but there has been a wide\nrange of responses to these\u2014for example, across a spectrum from\nasceticism to hedonism. This appears to be one of the central areas of\nmoral disagreement. In order to maintain her objectivist credentials,\nNussbaum needs to show that human nature substantially constrains\nwhich of these responses could be morally appropriate. Some\nobjectivists may say she has not shown this, but could, while\nrelativists may doubt she could show it.\n\nMixed positions along the lines of those just discussed suppose that\nmorality is objective in some respects, on account of some features of\nhuman nature, and relative in other respects. For the respects in\nwhich morality is relative, it is up to particular societies or\nindividuals to determine which moral values to embrace. Hence, the\nauthority of morality depends partly on objective factors and partly\non the decisions of groups or individuals. Insofar as this is true,\nsuch mixed positions need to say something about the basis for these\ndecisions and how conflicts are to be resolved (for example, when\nindividuals dissent from groups or when people belong to different\ngroups with conflicting values). The objective features of mixed\npositions may help resolve these issues, or may limit their import,\nbut at the point where these features give out there remain some of\nthe standard concerns about relativism (such as those raised in the\nlast section).\n\nAnother approach might be construed as a mixed position, though it was\nnot put forward in these terms. Isaiah Berlin (1998) argued that,\nthough some moral values are universal, there are also many objective\nvalues that conflict and are not commensurable with one another. He\ncalled his position pluralism and rejected the label\n\u2018relativism\u2019 (see the entry on\n Isaiah Berlin).\n But if incommensurability implies that these conflicts cannot be\nrationally resolved, then it might suggest a concession to\nrelativism.\n\nAgainst such a position, an objectivist may ask why we should think\nobjective goods are incommensurable: If X and Y are\nboth objectively good, then why not say that the statement\n\u2018X is better than Y\u2019 (or a more\nrestrictive comparative statement specifying respects or\ncircumstances) is objectively true or false, even if this is difficult\nto know? Berlin\u2019s view was that there are many examples of\nconflicting goods\u2014for example, justice and mercy, or liberty and\nequality\u2014where it is implausible to suppose they are\ncommensurable.\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that a rather different kind of mixed\nposition was proposed by Bernard Williams (1981 and 1985: ch. 9). He\nrejected what he called \u201cstrict relational relativism,\u201d\nthat ethical conceptions have validity only relative to a society. But\nhe endorsed another form of relativism. This was explained by\nreference to a distinction between a \u201cnotional\nconfrontation,\u201d where a divergent outlook is known but not a\nreal option for us, and a \u201creal confrontation,\u201d where a\ndivergent outlook is a real option for us\u2014something we might\nembrace without losing our grip on reality. Williams\u2019s\n\u201crelativism of distance\u201d says ethical appraisals are\nappropriate in real confrontations, but not in notional ones. For\nexample, we could never embrace the outlook of a medieval samurai:\nSince this is a notional confrontation, it would be inappropriate to\ndescribe this outlook as just or unjust. This is the sense in which\nrelativism is correct. But in real confrontations, relativism\nunhelpfully discourages the evaluation of another outlook that is a\ngenuine option for us (for a development of Williams\u2019s position\nby reference to the recent experimental literature, see Gait\u00e1n\nand Viciana 2018).\n\nWilliams was a strong critic of most forms of moral objectivism, yet\nhe also criticized many of the nonobjectivist alternatives to\nobjectivism. His outlook is not easily classified in terms of standard\nmetaethical positions. With respect to his relativism of distance, it\nmay be wondered why appraisals are inappropriate in notional\nconfrontations: Why should the fact that an outlook is not a real\noption preclude us from thinking it is just or unjust? On the other\nhand, in real confrontations Williams thought the language of\nappraisal was appropriate, but he also thought these confrontations\ncould involve rationally irresolvable disagreements. Though Williams\nrejects strict relational relativism, objectivists may argue that his\nposition suffers from defects as serious as those that attend\nMMR. If the confrontations are real because the two outlooks\nhave something in common, objectivists might ask, could this not\nprovide a basis for resolving these disagreements?\n\nThe central theme in mixed positions is that neither relativism nor\nobjectivism is wholly correct: At least in the terms in which they are\noften expressed, these alternatives are subject to serious objections,\nand yet they are motivated by genuine concerns. It might seem that a\nmixed position could be developed that would give us the best of both\nworlds (there are a number of other proposals along these lines; for\nexample see Hampshire 1983 and 1989). However, an implication of most\nmixed positions (this does not apply to Williams) seems to be that, in\nsome respect, some moral judgments are objectively true (or\njustified), while others have only relative truth (or justification).\nThis should not be confused with the claim that an action may be right\nin some circumstances but not others. For example, a consequentialist\nview that polygamy is right in one society and wrong in another\nbecause it has good consequences in the first society and bad\nconsequences in the second would not be a mixed position because the\njudgments \u201cPolygamy is right in circumstances A\u201d\nand \u201cPolygamy is wrong in circumstances B\u201d could\nboth be true in an absolute sense. By contrast, a mixed position might\nsay that \u201cPolygamy is right\u201d is true relative to one\nsociety and false relative to another (where the two societies differ,\nnot necessarily in circumstances, but in fundamental values), while\nother moral judgments have absolute truth-value. This is a rather\ndisunified conception of morality, and it invites many questions. A\nproponent of a mixed view would have to show that it is an accurate\nportrayal of our moral practices, or that it is a plausible proposal\nfor reforming them.\n",
