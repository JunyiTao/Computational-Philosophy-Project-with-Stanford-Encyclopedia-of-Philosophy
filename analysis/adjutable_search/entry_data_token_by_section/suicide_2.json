    "main_text": "Highlights of Historical Western Thought || Ancient and Classical Views of Suicide\n2.1 Ancient and Classical Views of Suicide\n\nWestern philosophical discourse about suicide stretches back at least\nto the time of Plato. As John Cooper has noted (Cooper 1989, 10),\nneither ancient Greek nor Latin had a single word that aptly\ntranslates our \u2018suicide,\u2019 even though most of the ancient\ncity-states criminalized self-killing.\n\nPlato explicitly discussed suicide in two works. First, in\nPhaedo, Socrates expresses guarded enthusiasm for the thesis,\nassociated with the Pythagoreans, that suicide is always wrong because\nit represents our releasing ourselves (i.e., our souls) from a\n\u201cguard-post\u201d (i.e., our bodies) the gods have placed us in\nas a form of punishment (Phaedo 61b-62c). Later, in the\nLaws, Plato claimed that suicide is disgraceful and its\nperpetrators should be buried in unmarked graves. However, Plato\nrecognized four exceptions to this principle: (1) when one\u2019s\nmind is morally corrupted and one\u2019s character can therefore not\nbe salvaged (Laws IX 854a3\u20135), (2) when the\nself-killing is done by judicial order, as in the case of Socrates,\n(3) when the self-killing is compelled by extreme and unavoidable\npersonal misfortune, and (4) when the self-killing results from shame\nat having participated in grossly unjust actions (Laws IX\n873c-d). Suicide under these circumstances can be excused, but,\naccording to Plato, it is otherwise an act of cowardice or laziness\nundertaken by individuals too delicate to manage life\u2019s\nvicissitudes. Aristotle\u2019s only discussion of suicide\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1138a5\u201314) occurs in the midst of a\ndiscussion of the possibility of treating oneself unjustly. Aristotle\nconcludes that self-killing does not treat oneself unjustly so long as\nit is done voluntarily because the harm done to oneself is consensual.\nHe concludes that suicide is somehow a wrong to the state or the\ncommunity, though he does not outline the nature of this wrong or the\nspecific vices that suicidal individuals allegedly exhibit.\n\nTo contemporary readers, the most striking feature of Plato\u2019s\nand Aristotle\u2019s texts on suicide is their relative absence of\nconcern for individual well-being or rights. Both limit the\njustifications for suicide largely to considerations about an\nindividual\u2019s social roles and obligations. In contrast, the\nStoics held that whenever the means to living a naturally flourishing\nlife are not available to us, suicide may be justified, regardless of\nthe character or virtue of the individual in question. Our natures\nrequire certain \u201cnatural advantages\u201d (e.g., physical\nhealth) in order for us to be happy, and a wise person who recognizes\nthat such advantages may be lacking in her life sees that ending her\nlife neither enhances nor diminishes her moral virtue.\n\nWhen a man\u2019s circumstances contain a preponderance of things in\naccordance with nature, it is appropriate for him to remain alive;\nwhen he possesses or sees in prospect a majority of the contrary\nthings, it is appropriate for him to depart from life\u2026. Even\nfor the foolish, who are also miserable, it is appropriate for them to\nremain alive if they possess a predominance of those things which we\npronounce to be in accordance with nature (Cicero, III, 60\u201361).\n\n\nHence, not only may concerns related to one\u2019s obligations to\nothers justify suicide, but one\u2019s own private good is relevant\ntoo. The Roman Stoic Seneca, who was himself compelled to engage in\nsuicide, was even bolder, claiming that since \u201cmere living is\nnot a good, but living well\u201d, a wise person \u201clives as long\nas he ought, not as long as he can.\u201d For Seneca, it is the\nquality, not the quantity, of one\u2019s life that matters.\n",
