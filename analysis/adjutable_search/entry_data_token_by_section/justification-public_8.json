    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle || Coercion Alone?\n2.7 Coercion Alone?\n\nTypically public justification addresses the permissibility of\npolitical coercion. Coercion might apply to constitutional essentials\nand basic justice (Rawls 2005). Or it applies to coercive law as well\n(Quong 2011). Yet some theorists extend public justification beyond\ncoercion. Gaus (2011) and Chad Van Schoelandt (2015) argue that public\njustification evaluates relations of moral authority. We publicly\njustify our practice of making moral demands of others, even if the\nrules we demand others follow are not coercive. Colin Bird (2014)\ngrounds public justification in the standing of democratic citizens as\nco-authors of legislation. In Bird\u2019s view, we must justify\nnon-coercive legislation that affects the status of citizens. An\nexample might be communicative legislation that defines an optionally\nsworn national pledge of allegiance. Some public reason theorists\nbroaden the idea of coercion to cover structural coercion (Boettcher\n2016, Wong 2020).\n",
