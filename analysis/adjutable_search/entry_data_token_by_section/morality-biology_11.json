    "main_text": "Evolutionary Biology and Normative Ethics: Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Corrective Evolutionary Ethics, and the Question of Moral Progress || Corrective Uses of Evolutionary Biology in Normative Ethics\n3.3 Corrective Uses of Evolutionary Biology in Normative Ethics\n\nA less problematic kind of appeal to evolutionary theory has been made\neven by those who fully recognize the autonomy of ethics and the role\nof autonomous moral reflection. Darwinian evolutionary theory implies\nthat many other beliefs about the natures and origins of living things\nare false. Human beings are not members of a species created by a\nspecial act of a divine designer, but members of an evolved species\nrelated by common ancestry to every other species on Earth. So insofar\nas certain ethical views rely on assumptions about special\ncreation, they will be refuted by the success of evolutionary theory.\nMore weakly, insofar as certain ethical views have traditionally been\nsupported by claims about special creation, they will to that\nextent lose some of their support. This would not show that they are\nfalse or even unjustified, as there may be alternative sufficient\nsupport for them. But in removing some of their common support,\nevolutionary theory would pose a significant challenge to those who\nhad relied on that support (Rachels 1990).\n\nRachels takes such an approach against the common belief that human\nbeings have a special moral dignity that is much higher than the\nstatus enjoyed by non-human animals. Such a belief has traditionally\nbeen rooted in the idea that we are separate from other living things,\nhaving been created specially in the image of God and endowed with\nsouls, giving us a special moral status. If evolutionary theory is\ntrue, however, then this support is undermined: since Homo\nsapiens evolved from other species, there is no sharp biological\nseparation between Homo sapiens and the rest of the living\nworld; there is instead a continuum through evolutionary history, with\nno species created separately, in a divine image, or infused with\nspecial souls. Thus, those who have based their beliefs about the\nspeical moral status of human beings on a creationist picture have a\nproblem: that picture is false, and the true picture does nothing to\nsupport such a view.\n\nAgain, however, this does not show that the common view of special\nhuman dignity is false or even unjustified. There may be other forms\nof support for it that do not depend on creationist assumptions. Many\nwould argue, for example, that although we are related to other\nanimals, we are very different from even our closest primate\nrelatives, as (not to put too fine a point on it) a trip to the zoo\nfollowed by a visit to the Library of Congress or the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art will confirm. The vastness of the differences between\nhuman and other forms of life on Earth is not erased by pointing out\nthat human beings got to be the way we are through contingent\nevolutionary processes acting on brains similar to those of extant\napes, together with thousands of years of cultural evolution. It is\nthese real differences\u2014regardless of how they came\nabout\u2014that plausibly ground differences in the moral status of\nhuman beings and other\n animals.[10]\n\nThere are more straightforward ways in which evolutionary biology, as\nwell as results from empirical moral psychology, can play a corrective\nrole in normative ethics. Evolutionary biology and comparative\ngenetics might, for example, be used to undermine false claims about\nrace, which underlie racist ethical claims. Experimental psychology\nmight be used to cast doubts on the moral condemnation of\nhomosexuality by supporting the debunking hypothesis that such\njudgments stem from projected disgust. More generally, psychological\nexperiments can expose typical human pitfalls in moral judgment and\nbehavior\u2014tendencies toward cruelty in conditions of power\ninequality, or toward exaggerated moral condemnation when experiencing\ndisgust or stress. If we understand these facts about ourselves, we\ncan more effectively pursue and realize normative goals such as\nnon-violence or fairness by avoiding circumstances that lead to\ncruelty, or by watching for and correcting distorting influences on\nour judgment (Glover 2000; Appiah 2008, 49, 71\u201372, 110\u201311,\n124; Buchanan and Powell 2018). As noted earlier, however, the\nnormative goals themselves will not have been set for us by\nevolutionary biology or psychology. That task falls to informed moral\nreflection.\n",
