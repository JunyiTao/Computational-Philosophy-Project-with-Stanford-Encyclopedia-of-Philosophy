If one is an\nincompatibilist, then the case requires in addition evidence\nfor causal indeterminism, occurring in the right locations in the\nprocess leading from deliberation to action. Many think that we\nalready have third-personal \u2018neutral\u2019 scientific evidence\nfor much of human behavior\u2019s satisfying modest compatibilist\nrequirements, such as Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s\nreasons-responsiveness account. However, given the immaturity of\nsocial science and the controversy over whether psychological states\n\u2018reduce\u2019 in some sense to underlying physical states (and\nwhat this might entail for the reality of mental causation), this\nclaim is doubtful. A more promising case for our satisfying (at least)\ncompatibilist requirements on freedom is that effective agency is\npresupposed by all scientific inquiry and so cannot\nrationally be doubted (which fact is overlooked by some of the more\nextreme \u2018willusionists\u2019 such as Wegner).\n\nHowever, effective intervention in the world (in scientific practice\nand elsewhere) does not (obviously) require that our behavior be\ncausally undetermined, so the \u2018freedom is rationally\npresupposed\u2019 argument cannot be launched for such an\nunderstanding of freedom. Instead, incompatibilists usually give one\nof the following two bases for rational belief in freedom (both of\nwhich can be given by compatibilists, too).\n\nFirst, philosophers have long claimed that we have introspective\nevidence of freedom in our experience of action, or perhaps of\nconsciously attended or deliberated action. Augustine and Scotus,\ndiscussed earlier, are two examples among many. In recent years,\nphilosophers have been more carefully scrutinizing the experience of\nagency and a debate has emerged concerning its contents, and in\nparticular whether it supports an indeterministic theory of human free\naction. For discussion, see Deery et al. (2013), Guillon (2014),\nHorgan (2015), and Bayne (2017).\n\nSecond, philosophers (e.g., Reid 1788 [1969], Swinburne 2013)\nsometimes claim that our belief in the reality of free will is\nepistemically basic, or reasonable without requiring independent\nevidential support. Most philosophers hold that some beliefs have that\nstatus, on pain of our having no justified beliefs whatever. It is\ncontroversial, however, just which beliefs do because it is\ncontroversial which criteria a belief must satisfy to qualify for that\nprivileged status. It is perhaps necessary that a basic belief be\n\u2018instinctive\u2019 (unreflectively held) for all or most human\nbeings; that it be embedded in regular experience; and that it be\ncentral to our understanding of an important aspect of the world. Our\nbelief in free will seems to meet these criteria, but whether they are\nsufficient is debated. (O\u2019Connor 2019 proposes that free will\nbelief is epistemically basic but defeasible.) Other philosophers\ndefend a variation on this stance, maintaining instead that belief in\nthe reality of moral responsibility is epistemically basic, and that\nsince moral responsibility entails free will, or so it is claimed, we\nmay infer the reality of free will (see, e.g., van Inwagen\n1983, 206\u201313).\n",
