    "main_text": "Alternative Tests\n5. Alternative Tests\n\nSome of the literature about The Turing Test is concerned with\nquestions about the framing of a test that can provide a suitable\nguide to future research in the area of Artificial Intelligence. The\nidea here is very simple. Suppose that we have the ambition to produce\nan artificially intelligent entity. What tests should we take as\nsetting the goals that putatively intelligent artificial systems\nshould achieve? Should we suppose that The Turing Test provides an\nappropriate goal for research in this field? In assessing these\nproposals, there are two different questions that need to be borne in\nmind. First, there is the question whether it is a useful goal for AI\nresearch to aim to make a machine that can pass the given test\n(administered over the specified length of time, at the specified\ndegree of success). Second, there is the question of the appropriate\nconclusion to draw about the mental capacities of a machine that does\nmanage to pass the test (administered over the specified length of\ntime, at the specified degree of success).\n\nOpinion on these questions is deeply divided. Some people suppose that\nThe Turing Test does not provide a useful goal for research in AI\nbecause it is far too difficult to produce a system that can pass the\ntest. Other people suppose that The Turing Test does not provide a\nuseful goal for research in AI because it sets a very narrow target\n(and thus sets unnecessary restrictions on the kind of research that\ngets done). Some people think that The Turing Test provides an\nentirely appropriate goal for research in AI; while other people think\nthat there is a sense in which The Turing Test is not really demanding\nenough, and who suppose that The Turing Test needs to be extended in\nvarious ways in order to provide an appropriate goal for AI. We shall\nconsider some representatives of each of these positions in turn.\n\nThere are some people who continue to endorse The Turing Test. For\nexample, Neufeld and Finnestad (2020a) (2020b) argue that The Turing\nTest is no barrier to progress in AI, requires no significant\nredefinition, and does not shut down other avenues of investigation.\nMaybe we do better just to take The Turing Test to define a watershed\nrather than a threshold towards which we might hope to make\nincremental progression.\n",
