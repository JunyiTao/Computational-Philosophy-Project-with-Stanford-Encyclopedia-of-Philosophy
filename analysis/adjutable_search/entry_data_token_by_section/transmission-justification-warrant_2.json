    "main_text": "Failure of Epistemic Transmission || Trivial Transmission Failure versus Non-Transmissivity\n3.1 Trivial Transmission Failure versus Non-Transmissivity\n\nIt is acknowledged that justification sometimes fails to transmit\nacross known entailment (the acknowledgment dates back at least to\nWright 1985). Moreover, it is no overstatement to say that the\nliterature has investigated transmission failure more extensively than\ntransmission of justification. As we have seen, justification based on\n\\(e\\) transmits from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) across the entailment if and only\nif \n\n(C1)\n \\(s\\) has justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\), \n(C2)\n\\(s\\) knows that \\(q\\) is deducible from \\(p\\), and \n(C3\\(^{+}\\))\n at least part of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(q\\) is based\non the satisfaction of (C1) and (C2).\n\n\nIt follows from this characterization that no justification\nbased on e transmits from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) across the\nentailment if\n (C1),\n (C2), or\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n are not satisfied. These are cases of transmission failure.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that knowledge and justification are not\nalways closed under competent (single-premise or\nmultiple-premise) deduction. In the recent literature, the explanation\nof closure failure has often been essayed in terms of\nagglomeration of epistemic risk. This type of explanation is\nless controversial when applied to multi-premise deduction. An example\nof it concerning justification is the deduction from a high number\n\\(n\\) of premises, each of which specifies that a different ticket in\na fair lottery won\u2019t win, which are individually justified even\nthough each premise is somewhat risky, to the conclusion that\nnone of these \\(n\\) tickets will win, which is too risky to\nbe justified. (For more controversial cases in which knowledge or\njustification closure would fail across single-premise deduction\nbecause of risk accumulation, see for example Lasonen-Aarnio 2008 and\nSchechter 2013; for responses, see for instance Smith 2013 and 2016.)\nThese cases of failure of epistemic closure can be taken to also\ninvolve failure of justification transmission. For instance,\nit can be argued that even if \n\n(C1\\(^{*}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for each of the \\(n\\) premises stating\nthat a ticket won\u2019t win, and \n(C2\\(^{*}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that it follows from these premises that none of the\n\\(n\\) tickets will win, \n\n\n\\(s\\) has no justification\u2014and, therefore, no justification in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1\\(^{*}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(^{*}\\))\u2014for\n believing that none of the \\(n\\) tickets will win. In these cases,\ntransmission failure appears to be a consequence of closure failure,\nand it is therefore natural to treat the former simply as a\nsymptomatic manifestation of the latter. For this reason, we will\nfollow the current literature on transmission failure in not\ndiscussing these cases. (For an analysis of closure failure, see the\nentry on\n epistemic closure,\n especially section 6.)\n\nThe current literature treats transmission failure as a self-standing\nphenomenon, in the sense that it focuses on cases in which\ntransmission failure is not imputed\u2014and thus not considered\nreducible\u2014to an underlying failure of closure. For the rest of\nthis entry, we shall follow suit and investigate transmission failure\nin this pure or genuine form.\n\nThe most trivial cases of transmission failure are such that\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is unsatisfied because\n (C1)\n or\n (C2)\n are unsatisfied, but it is also true that (C3\\(^{+}\\))\nwould have been satisfied if both\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n have been satisfied (cf. Tucker 2010b\n [OIR]).\n It deserves emphasis that these cases involve arguments that\naren\u2019t unsuitable for the purpose to transmit justification\ndepending on evidence \\(e\\): had the epistemic circumstances been\ncongenial to the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2),\n these arguments would have transmitted the justification based on\n\\(e\\) from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). As we could put the point, these arguments\nare transmissive of the justification depending on\n \\(e\\).[4]\n\nCases of transmission failure of a more interesting variety are those\nin which, regardless of the validity of closure of justification,\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n isn\u2019t satisfied because it could not have been satisfied, no\nmatter whether or not\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n have been satisfied. These cases concern arguments\nnon-transmissive of justification depending on a given\nevidence, i.e., arguments incapable of transmitting justification\ndepending on that evidence under any epistemic circumstance. An\nexample in point is\n Twins.\n Suppose first that \\(s\\) has independent justification for\n \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n In those circumstances \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_2\\).\n\n\nFurthermore \n\n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) does know that\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n\n\nHowever, \\(s\\) hasn\u2019t justification for \\(\\rQ_2\\) in virtue of\nthe satisfaction of\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\)).\n So\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is not met. Suppose now that \\(s\\) has no independent justification\nfor \\(\\rQ_2\\). Then, it isn\u2019t the case that \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_2\\).\n \n\n\nSo,\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is not met either. Since there is no other possibility\u2014either\n\\(s\\) has independent justification for\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n or she doesn\u2019t\u2014it cannot be the case that \\(s\\)\u2019s\nbelief that \\(\\rQ_2\\) is justified in virtue of her\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n and her knowledge that \\(\\rP_2\\) entails \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n\nNote that none of the cases of transmission failure of justification\nconsidered above entails failure of epistemic closure. For in none of\nthese cases \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p, s\\) knows that\n\\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), and \\(s\\) fails to have justification for\nbelieving \\(q\\).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the epistemologists contributing to the literature on\ntransmission failure have principally devoted their attention to cases\ninvolving non-transmissive arguments. Epistemologists have endeavored\nto identify conditions whose satisfaction suffices to make an argument\nnon-transmissive of justification based on a given evidence.\nThe next section reviews the most influential of these proposals.\n",
