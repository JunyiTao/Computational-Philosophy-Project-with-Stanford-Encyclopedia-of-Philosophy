    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || New Man\n3.6 New Man\n\n\nWith his second marriage, Prior changed. He became \u2018secure and\nserene\u2019 (Kenny 1971). The rather priggish young man disappears\nfrom his letters and a more mature, more lovable Prior emerges. In\nNovember 1945, he applied for a temporary lectureship at Canterbury\nUniversity College, in Christchurch, a vacancy created by\nPopper\u2019s departure. By now he had a further three articles in the\nAustralasian Journal of Psychology and\nPhilosophy\u2014\u2018Can Religion be Discussed?\u2019 (1942),\n\u2018The Meaning of Good\u2019 (1944), and \u2018The Subject of\nEthics\u2019 (1945)\u2014and with a strong recommendation from\nFindlay, he got the job. Prior started work in February 1946, on a\nsalary of \u00a3600 a year. It was a new beginning.\n\n\nAt Canterbury he was thrown entirely on his own resources, being as\nhe put it \u2018the only philosopher about the place\u2019. Prior\nbore the responsibility for providing a broad and balanced philosophy\ncurriculum, yet his own formal education in philosophy had stopped\nshort nine years previously. His one recourse in the face of isolation\nwas to read, and read he did. In logic he began by returning to W.E.\nJohnson. Next came J.N. Keynes\u2019s Studies and Exercises in\nFormal Logic and then (in his own phrase) he got stuck into\nPrincipia Mathematica. He learned a lot about the history of\nthe subject from Peirce, whom he found \u2018unexpectedly\nmagnificent\u2019. An important discovery, in 1950, was\nBochenski\u2019s Pr\u00e9cis de Logique Mathematique\n(Bochenski 1949). Prior was fascinated by the \u2018very neat symbolic\nnotation\u2019 due to \u0141ukasiewicz, and before long he turned his\nback completely on the more usual Peano-Russell notation. In\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s parenthesis-free notation, C\\(pq\\) is\nwritten for \u2018If \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u2019, and Bochenski\nwas later to describe Prior as even more of a\n\u2018CCCC-logician\u2019 than he was himself.\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s own Aristotle\u2019s Syllogistic and\nTarski\u2019s Introduction to Logic soon followed. By now the\nlogic bug had well and truly bitten. Prior saw from the work of the\nPoles that formal precision is possible in philosophy and this\ndelighted him. The upshot of Prior\u2019s reading for the curriculum\nwas that his students learned Aristotelian and medieval logic, using\nPolish notation and with Bochenski\u2019s Pr\u00e9cis de Logique\nMathematique as a text. \u2018Despite the language difficulty, I\nhave found this a first-class textbook to accompany lectures to New\nZealand students\u2019, Prior declared (1952c: 35).\n\n\nAn exuberant, playful man of seemingly inexhaustible vitality, Prior\nmade an excellent teacher. He had no trace of pomposity or pretension.\nHis students appreciated the friendly welcome they would receive at his\nhome, not to mention his relaxed attitude toward the administrative\nparaphernalia of roll-taking and the like. In those days Canterbury\nUniversity College was a formal, stuffy place and Prior was a breath of\nfresh air. Formality made him impatient; and he despised people he\ncalled \u2018bullshit artists\u2019 and \u2018dicky-lickers\u2019.\nIn a milieu where jacket and tie were the norm\u2014even in a\nsweltering New Zealand summer\u2014Prior would lecture in baggy khaki\nshorts and roman sandals. His student Jim Wilson recalls the friendly\ninformality of Prior\u2019s first-year classes:\n\n\n\nThe strained precision of clock time was alien to him, so he was\nusually late for his own lectures (or anyone else\u2019s for that\nmatter\u2014he was very egalitarian about it). But he almost always\nturned up eventually, thinning hair blown vertical by his dash on his\nbike when he remembered the time. He would pull cycle clips off his\ntrousers and plonk an ancient shopping bag on the desk in front of him.\nOut of this bag would come \u2026 a cabbage, a bunch of carrots, a\nloaf of bread, a bottle of milk \u2026 until, always at the bottom,\nhe would find the book he was looking for. Back into the bag went the\nrest of the goodies, then he would look up at us, apologise for being\nlate if he was more than usually so, and ask: \u2018Now where were we\nlast time?\u2019 Someone in the front row would consult her or his\nnotes\u2014Arthur couldn\u2019t as he never had any\u2014and would say\n\u2018You were just dealing with such and such\u2019. \u2018Ah yes,\nthank you\u2019 Arthur would respond, and forthwith launch into an\nextempore exposition which followed on perfectly from the previous\nsession and was beautifully structured and clear even though he was\njust thinking along with us. And of course we could stop him and ask\nfor clarification or elaboration at any time, without in the slightest\naffecting the overall structure and direction of his thoughts.\n\n\n\nSoon after his discovery of Pr\u00e9cis de Logique\nMathematique, Prior wrote to Bochenski in Fribourg and then, a\nlittle later, to \u0141ukasiewicz in Dublin. He was excited to receive\nreplies. \u2018We are, all of us, very isolated, being few and\nscattered\u2019, wrote Bochenski. \u2018It is a real pleasure to\nhear that a Colleague so far away is interested in the same problems\nyou are working at and that he finds one\u2019s little writings may\nbe of some use.\u2019 Thus began Prior\u2019s voluminous\ncorrespondence with logicians the world over. There were other ways,\ntoo, in which his isolation lessened. In 1951 he met and became\nfriends with John Mackie and Jack Smart, at a conference in\nSydney. This was Prior\u2019s first experience of being among a large\ngathering of philosophers; Mary Prior described the conference as his\n\u2018entry into a wider world\u2019. In the same year George\nHughes was appointed to the Victoria University of Wellington. Prior\nand Hughes had to make the most of their all-too-infrequent meetings,\nsometimes talking until the birds woke. Prior soon imparted his\nenthusiasm for logic to Hughes.\n \n\nPrior was also fortunate in having a number of excellent students\nduring these early years, among them Jonathan Bennett and Ronald\nButler: for Prior they were oases in the desert. In 1952, he gained an\nassistant lecturer, Sandy Anderson, son of the Sydney philosopher John\nAnderson, and following Prior\u2019s promotion to Professor later\nthat year, Philosophy became a department in its own right. Prior\nargued successfully for a new permanent member of staff, and in 1954\nJ.M. (Michael) Shorter was appointed to a lectureship. The young,\nOxford-educated Shorter worked previously at Aberdeen University,\nwhere Prior happened to be in touch with Polish logician\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Bednarowski.\n\n\nPrior worked intensely, often all through the night. 1949 saw the\npublication of his first book, a slim but potent volume titled\nLogic and the Basis of Ethics. It was published by the\nClarendon Press and soon became prominent in Oxford. Austin liked it\nand Ryle approved of \u2018Prior\u2019s complete lack of\nmugwumpery\u2019. In the Introduction Prior explained that by the\n\u2018logic of ethics\u2019 he meant \u2018not a special kind of\nlogic, nor a special branch of logic, but an application of it\u2019,\nand the book is a vigorous examination of the arguments of each side in\nthe naturalism/anti-naturalism debate.\n\nLogic and the Basis of Ethics contained no symbolism, and\nPrior\u2019s phrase \u2018the logic of ethics\u2019 was little more\nthan a battle cry. The few technical concepts that he used all related\nto syllogistic logic. It was not until 1952 that Prior began publishing\npapers in symbolic logic\u2014four of them, suddenly, in the same\nyear. At the unusually late age of 38 Prior had become a formal\nlogician. He wrote these papers while completing the manuscript of what\nwas intended to be his second postwar book, The Craft of Formal\nLogic. This began life in 1949 as a Dictionary of Formal Logic,\nbut, at the advice of the Clarendon Press, Prior soon switched to a\nmore orthodox format.\n\n\nHis logical interests veered sharply while he was writing The\nCraft. To sixteen chapters on the logic of categoricals,\nhypotheticals, terms and relations, he added, almost as an\nafterthought, one on modal logic and one on the axiomatic method. Prior\nfinished the manuscript in December 1951 and sent it to the Clarendon\nPress; fourteen months later they wrote agreeing to publish the book if\nPrior would both shorten it and give greater emphasis to modern logic.\nHe undertook to make the changes, but ended up writing a completely\ndifferent book. This was finally published in 1955 with the title\nFormal Logic; it ran into a second edition in 1962.\n\nThe Craft was Prior\u2019s third book-length manuscript\nthat failed to make it into print. His manuscript on Barth had died the\ndeath before the war, and his The Theology of the Church of\nScotland was a casualty when the Priors\u2019 Christchurch house\ncaught fire in 1949\u2014the book\u2019s remains, 163 charred pages\nof his handwriting, are in the Bodleian Library. (Scottish theology\nnevertheless remained \u2018part of the mulch that nourished his\nwork\u2019, Mary Prior said.) The Craft survives intact in\nthe Bodleian, except for a few missing pages. Some parts of it were\npublished posthumously, under the title The Doctrine of\nPropositions and Terms, but much of this fascinating manuscript\nremains unpublished.\n\nFormal Logic is steeped in Polish notation and the\naxiomatic method, and typifies Prior\u2019s mature work. It teaches,\nenthusiastically yet without fuss, that there was\nlife\u2014fascinating life\u2014before the here and now of logic.\nWhat Prior once wrote admiringly of \u0141ukasiewicz is no less true of\nPrior himself: \u2018having done very distinguished work as a\nmathematical logician in the modern style, [he] is at the same time\ninterested in the history of his subject \u2026 and contrives both to\nuse modern techniques to bring out more clearly what the ancients were\ndriving at, and to learn from the ancients useful logical devices which\nthe moderns have in general forgotten\u2019 (1952c: 37).\n\n\nAfter Findlay, \u0141ukasiewicz was the greatest single influence on\nPrior\u2019s development as a logician. Prior\u2019s 1952 review\narticle \u2018\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Symbolic Logic\u2019 was one\nof his first papers to make extensive use of symbolism. He there\ndiscussed \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s book Aristotle\u2019s\nSyllogistic From the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic (published\nin 1951) and two articles, \u2018The Shortest Axiom of the\nImplicational Calculus of Propositions\u2019 and \u2018On Variable\nFunctions of Propositional Arguments\u2019. The first of these\narticles stimulated Prior\u2019s interest in economical bases for\npropositional and pure implicational logics (initially aroused by his\nstudy of Peirce) and the opening chapters of Formal Logic drew\nheavily on \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work in this area.\n\n\nPrior seems first to have learned of \u0141ukasiewicz through the\nwritings of his pupil Bochenski. \u0141ukasiewicz had devised an\naxiomatic treatment of Aristotle\u2019s reduction of the imperfect\nsyllogistic moods to those of the first figure, which Prior encountered\nin Bochenski\u2019s Pr\u00e9cis. This enchanted Prior. He\nwas taking his students through the derivations as early as 1951, and\nsummarized \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s system in the final chapter of\nThe Craft. Throughout the chapter he made extensive use of\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s symbolic notation. \nIt was \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s axiomatic treatment of traditional\nlogic that fully brought home to Prior the power of modern symbolic\nmethods. Moreover, it was probably his reading of \u0141ukasiewicz that\nmade clear to him the fundamental importance of propositional logic.\n\u2018It seems that Aristotle did not suspect the existence of another\nsystem of logic besides his theory of the syllogism\u2019,\n\u0141ukasiewicz had written, \u2018[y]et he uses intuitively the laws\nof propositional logic \u2026\u2019 (1951a: 49).\n(\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s axiomatisation of the syllogistic\nincorporated his own three-axiom formalization of propositional logic\n(1951a: 80).)\n\nIn his review, Prior approvingly quoted\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s assertion that \u2018the logic of the Stoics,\nthe inventors of the ancient form of the propositional calculus, was\nmuch more important than all the syllogisms of Aristotle\u2019\n(\u0141ukasiewicz 1951a: 131). In The Craft, propositional\nlogic is barely mentioned until the final chapter, whereas Formal\nLogic begins with a thorough introduction to the subject. On page\n3 of Formal Logic Prior stated that the logic of propositions\nis \u2018basic, and the rest of logic built upon it\u2019.\nHis interest in economical bases for propositional and pure implicational logics, initially aroused by his study of Peirce, was stimulated by \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s article \u2018The Shortest Axiom of the Implicational Calculus of Propositions\u2019, and the opening chapters of Formal Logic draw heavily on \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work in this area.\n",
