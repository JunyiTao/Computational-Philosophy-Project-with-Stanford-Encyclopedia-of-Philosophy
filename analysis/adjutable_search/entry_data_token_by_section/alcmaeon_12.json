    "main_text": "Cosmology || Opposites\n5. Importance and Influence\n\nAlcmaeon has been somewhat neglected in recent scholarship on early\nGreek philosophy (e.g., he hardly appears in Curd and Graham 2008,\nLong 1999 and Taylor 1997, the most recent surveys of the subject, but\nboth Guthrie 1962 and now Zhmud 2012a and 2014 stress his importance).\nThere would appear to be several reasons for this neglect. First, what\nremains of Alcmaeon\u2019s book has little to say on the metaphysical\nquestions about the first principles of the cosmos and about being,\nwhich have dominated recent scholarship on the Presocratics. Second,\ndoubts about his date and about the focus of his investigations have\nmade it difficult to place him in the development of early Greek\nthought. Finally, a more accurate appreciation of his use of\ndissection has deflated some of the hyperbolic claims in earlier\nscholarship about his originality. The extent of his originality and\nthe importance of his influence depend to a degree on his dating. An\nextremely late dating for his activity (after 450 BCE) makes him\nappear to espouse the typical views of the age rather than to break\nnew ground. If he was active in the early fifth century, his views are\nmuch more original. That Aristotle wrote a separate treatise in\nresponse to Alcmaeon argues in favor of his originality. He should\nprobably be regarded as a pioneer in applying a political metaphor to\nthe balance of opposites that constitute the healthy human body. The\nrange of his work in biology is remarkable for the early fifth century\nand he may have initiated a physiological emphasis in Greek philosophy\nwhich was not present in Ionian philosophers, such as Anaximander and\nAnaximenes, and set the agenda in this area for later Presocratics\n(Zhmud 2012a, 366). It is sometimes said that his conception of\nporoi (channels), which connect the sense organs to the\nbrain, influenced Empedocles\u2019 theory of poroi, but the\ntheories may share no more than the name. In Empedocles, all materials\nhave pores in them, which determine whether they mix well with other\nobjects. Sense organs also have pores, but these function not to\nconnect the sense organ to the seat of intelligence (which for\nEmpedocles is the heart) but to determine whether the sense organ can\nreceive the effluences that are poured forth by external objects\n(Solmsen 1961, 157; Wright 1981, 230). Alcmaeon\u2019s influence was\nsignificant in three final ways: 1) His identification of the brain as\nthe seat of human intelligence influenced Philolaus (DK, B13), the\nHippocratic Treatise, On the Sacred Disease, and Plato\n(Timaeus 44d), although a number of thinkers including\nEmpedocles and Aristotle continued to regard the heart as the seat of\nperception and intelligence. 2) His empiricist epistemology may lie\nbehind important passages in Plato (Phaedo 96b) and Aristotle\n(Posterior Analytics 100a). 3) He developed the first\nargument for the immortality of the soul, which may have influenced\nPlato\u2019s argument in the Phaedrus (245c ff.).\n",
