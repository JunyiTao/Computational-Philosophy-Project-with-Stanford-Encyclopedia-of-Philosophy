    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nSuppose, for the sake of the argument, that there are moral facts.\nSuppose even that the moral facts are properly thought of as at least\ncompatible with science. One thing Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument still seems to show is that no appeal to natural facts\ndiscovered by scientific method would establish that the moral facts\nare one way rather than another. That something is pleasant, or\nuseful, or satisfies someone\u2019s preference, is perfectly\ncompatible with thinking that it is neither good nor right nor worth\ndoing. The mere fact that moral facts might be compatible with natural\nfacts does nothing to support the idea that we could learn about the\nmoral facts.  David Hume seems to have been, in effect, pressing this\npoint long before Moore, when he argued that no moral conclusion\nfollows non-problematically from nonmoral premises (Hume 1739). No\n\u201cought,\u201d he pointed out, followed from an\n\u201cis\u201d\u2014without the help of another (presupposed)\n\u201cought.\u201d More generally, there is no valid inference from\nnonmoral premises to moral conclusions unless one relies, at least\nsurreptitiously, on a moral premise. If, then, all that science can\nestablish is what \u201cis\u201d and not what ought to be, science\ncannot alone establish moral conclusions.\n\n\nBut from where, then, can we get the moral premises needed? Of\ncourse no answer is to be found in a claim that certain norms are in\nforce or that a powerful being commanded something since, in both\ncases, nothing about what ought to be done follows from these claims\nwithout assuming some further moral claim (e.g. that one ought to obey\nthe norms in force or that one owes allegiance to the powerful being).\nIf at least some fundamental moral principles were self-evident, or\nanalytic truths, or at least reasonably thought to enjoy widespread\nconsensus or to be such that eventually all would converge on those\nprinciples, there might be some plausible candidates. Yet the few\nprinciples that might be candidates\u2014one ought to treat people with\nrespect or one ought to promote human welfare or, other things equal,\npleasure is good\u2014are all either so abstract or inspecific in\ntheir implications that they could hardly alone work to justify the\nfull range of moral claims people are inclined to make.\n\n\nThese considerations highlight a crucial difficulty moral realists\nface even if one grants the existence of moral facts: they need some\naccount of how we might justify our moral claims. Otherwise, whatever\nthe moral facts are, we would have reasonable grounds for worrying that\nwhat we count as evidence for any particular claim is no evidence at\nall.\n\n\nIn light of this concern, it is worth noting that the challenge\nposed here for our moral claims actually plagues a huge range of other\nclaims we take ourselves to be justified in making. For instance, just\nas no collection of nonmoral premises will alone entail a moral\nconclusion, no collection of nonpsychological premises will alone\nentail a psychological conclusion, and no collection of nonbiological\npremises will alone entail a biological conclusion. In each case the\npremises will entail the conclusions only if, at least surreptitiously,\npsychological or biological premises, respectively, are introduced. Yet\nno one supposes that this means we can never justify claims concerning\npsychology or biology. That there are these analogues of course does\nnot establish that we are, in fact, justified in making the moral\nclaims we do. But they do show that granting the inferential gap\nbetween nonmoral claims and moral claims does not establish that we can\nhave no evidence for the moral claims. And they refocus the challenge\nfacing moral realists. Under what conditions, and why, are\npsychological and biological claims reasonably thought justified? Might\nsimilar conditions and considerations hold for moral claims?\n\n\nAt one time, philosophers thought there was a quick and easy answer to\nthese questions, an answer that immediately discredited moral\nclaims. That answer was that in psychology and biology our\njustifications can and do ultimately ground out in empirical\nobservations, whereas nothing of the kind is available for moral\ntheory. If true, this would explain in a sharp way why psychology and\nbiology might have a real claim on our opinions while morality and\nalchemy and various crackpot theories do not. The former can be tested\nagainst experience and pass the test, while the latter, while\ntestable, can be seen to fail utterly.\n\n\nMoral realists have three sorts of reply to the epistemic challenge\nthey face. One is to argue that a proper appreciation of the ways in\nwhich all observation is theory laden leaves no real contrast between\nthe observations that support psychology and biology and those that are\nappealed to supporting moral theories. As proponents of this view would\nhave it, the process of justifying various scientific theories, which\ninvolves moving back and forth between particular specific claims and\nmore general principles seeking a mutually supporting system, is\nmatched step for step by when people develop and defend moral theories.\nIn both cases specific judgments (concerning observations or the\nbadness of a certain act, for instance) are tentatively accepted and an\nattempt is made to make sense of them by appeal to more general\nprinciples that explain the judgments. When the more general principles\nare available the specific judgments are taken as evidence for the\nprinciples and the principles reciprocate by helping to justify the\nthought that the specific judgments are accurate. But if no general\nprinciples are available the specific judgments are called into\nquestion and the suspicion is rightly raised that they might be\nillusory or misleading. Whether they are taken to be warranted is\ndecided in large part, and rightly, by appealing to other principles\nthat so far have themselves found support in their fit with still other\nspecific judgments. The process is of necessity tentative and piecemeal\nbut it is, many argue, nonetheless no different in science than in\nmorality. All of this is, of course, compatible with thinking the\nprocess might end in failure\u2014alchemy and crackpot theories are\nprime examples of how the attempt to sustain a systematic and mutually\nsupporting set of beliefs can fail. But absent special arguments that\nmorality fails in the way they do, morality no less than psychology and\nbiology can claim that experience may well provide confirmation for our\nmoral claims (Sayre-McCord 1996).\n\n\nSome moral realists, particularists, reject the general picture of\nsystematic justification just described and yet argue that, when it\ncomes to the role of observation, moral claims are nonetheless actually\non a par with non-moral claims (Dancy 1993). According to them, our\njustification for our particular nonmoral observations depends not at\nall on our having any sort of articulatable general grounds to offer\nas support. To suppose otherwise is to succumb to a misguided picture\nof when and why people are justified in believing as they do\nconcerning what they observe. The situation is exactly the same,\nparticularists maintain, with our moral claims. Here too someone can\nbe perfectly justified in claiming, for instance, that some particular\naction was wrong or that some response was obligatory, without having\narticulatable general ground to offer as support. Such moral claims\nmight, of course, still prove to be mistaken, but then the same is\ntrue of what people take themselves to have seen.\n\n\nAnother realist reply to the epistemic challenge is to argue that\nmathematics and logic, not science, are the right models of moral\ntheory (Scanlon 2014). Neither mathematics nor logic, some maintain, rely on\nexperience for their confirmation. They are, instead, supportable a\npriori by appeal to the nature of the concepts they involve. On\nthis view, a sound defense of the principles we need to ground moral\narguments can be found in a suitably subtle and careful bit of\nconceptual analysis. In light of Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument,\nthose who advocate an epistemology of conceptual analysis acknowledge\nthat the correct analysis, whatever it is, is likely not at all\nobvious. And, they point out, this means that people who are genuinely\ncompetent with the relevant concepts might themselves not recognize the\ncorrect analysis as correct (Jackson 1998). Nonetheless, the analysis might be\ncorrect. If there is some such analysis to be had, and if it is rich\nenough to provide the sort of substantive principles needed to\nunderwrite our various particular judgments, realism will have met well\nits epistemic burden. Of course putting things this way assumes we have\na good epistemology of conceptual analysis, which might well be called\ninto question. But worries about conceptual analysis are not specific\nto morality. And if they prove decisive, then those worries leave\nmathematics and logic, no less than morals, in need of some grounding\nor other. Whatever might be advanced on behalf of mathematics and\nlogic, many think, should work as well for morality.\n\n\nStill another reply, compatible with the first two but relying\nspecifically on neither, shifts attention from science and from\nmathematics and logic, to epistemology itself. To think of any set of\nconsiderations that they justify some conclusion is to make a claim\nconcerning the value (albeit the epistemic as opposed to moral value)\nof a conclusion. To hold of science, or mathematics, or logic, that\nthere is a difference between good evidence or good arguments and bad\nones is again to commit oneself evaluatively. This raises an obvious\nquestion: under what conditions, and why, are epistemic claims\nreasonably thought justified? Whatever answer one might begin to offer\nwill immediately provide a model for an answer to the parallel question\nraised about moral judgments. There is no guarantee, of course, that\nour moral judgments will then end up being justified. The epistemic\nstandards epistemology meets might well not be met by moral theory. But\nthere is good reason to think the kinds of consideration that are\nappropriate to judging epistemic principles will be appropriate too\nwhen it comes to judging other normative principles, including those\nthat we might recognize as moral. This means that any quick dismissal\nof moral theory as obviously not the sort of thing that could really be\njustified are almost surely too quick.\n",
