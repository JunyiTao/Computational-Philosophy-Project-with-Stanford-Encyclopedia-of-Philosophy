    "main_text": "Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy: Scientia and human knowledge || Human knowledge in natural philosophy (sensitive knowledge)\n2.3 Human knowledge in natural philosophy (sensitive knowledge)\n\nThe conclusion that no intuitive or demonstrative knowledge of\nsubstances is possible for us because their real essences and\nnecessary connections remain out of reach leaves Locke at a\ncrossroads. One path is the skeptical belief that without certainty,\nno knowledge of substances is possible at all. He rejects that path,\ndenying that hyperbolic doubt could be genuine for either the self (E\nIV.ix.2, pp. 619\u201320) or for external objects (E IV.xi.3, p.\n631). The other path is the one that he follows. Here, he lowers the\nbar by admitting a third kind of knowledge, which lacks certainty:\nsensitive knowledge.\n [14]\n\nSensitive knowledge is knowledge of the \u201ceffects [that] come\nevery day within the notice of our Senses,\u201d without an\nunderstanding of their causes; \u201cwe must be content to be\nignorant of\u201d those causes (E IV.iii.29, pp. 559\u2013560).\nInstead of knowing real essences, the causal basis of the properties\nwe perceive, we know only those perceived properties, from which we\nconstruct nominal essences. Instead of employing deduction, we are\nforced to rely upon \u201ctrials\u201d\u2014observations and\ninduction. Instead of knowing the necessary connections holding\nbetween a substance\u2019s real essence and its other qualities,\nincluding its tertiary qualities (which might include, recall, causal\nconnections with substances beyond the remotest star), we know only\nthe co-existences of properties. And from the mere, regular\nco-existence of properties found in observed cases, Locke observes, we\ncould not know with certainty that the same set will be found\nco-existing in the next case.\n\nFor all the Qualities that are co-existent in any Subject,\nwithout this dependence and evident connexion of their Ideas\none with another, we cannot know certainly any two to\nco-exist any farther, than Experience, by our Senses, informs\nus. Thus though we see the yellow Colour, and upon trial find the\nWeight, Malleableness, Fusibility, and Fixedness, that are united in a\npiece of Gold; yet because no one of these Ideas has any\nevident dependence, or necessary connexion with the other, we\ncannot certainly know, that where any four of these are, the fifth\nwill be there also, how highly probable soever it may be (E IV.iii.14,\np. 546).\n\n\nOur discoveries about co-existing properties\u2014are merely\ncontingent particulars, or, insofar as they are applied beyond the\nparticular cases we have actually observed, are mere probability.\nNevertheless, they can qualify as real knowledge. To qualify, our\nideas must meet certain conditions. The complex idea that we refer to\nas a substance must comprise all and only those simple ideas that we\nhave found to co-exist in nature. With this, Locke aims to show that\nsensitive knowledge deserves its appellation, since it can be\ndistinguished from arbitrary or otherwise poorly grounded claims\n(e.g., that fluidity has been found to co-exist with brittleness, in a\nsingle substance and at a single given\n temperature.[15])\n Sensitive knowledge is something far less than scientia but\nfar more than ungrounded opinion.\n\nHerein therefore is founded the reality of our Knowledge\nconcerning Substances, that all our complex Ideas of\nthem must be such, and such only, as are made up of such simple ones,\nas have been discovered to co-exist in Nature. And our Ideas\nbeing thus true, though not, perhaps, very exact Copies, are yet the\nSubjects of real (as far as we have any) Knowledge\nof them (E IV.iv.12, p. 568).\n\n\nAs for general claims about substances based upon observed particular\nmatters of fact, these too can qualify as real knowledge. Admittedly,\nwhen four of the five properties previously found co-existing together\noccur again, it is only probable that the fifth will be present as\nwell. Yet we can still form an abstract idea of gold, as a substance\nhaving all five properties, and call this general claim knowledge\nbecause \u201cwhatever have once had an union in Nature, may be\nunited again\u201d (E IV.iv.12, p. 568).\n\nHas contemporary science enabled us to go beyond sensitive knowledge?\nIn particular, have discoveries about compounds, elements, and\nsubatomic particles provided us with knowledge of real essences? Much\nof the force of this question derives, to paraphrase Nicholas Jolley,\nfrom the fact that many of those discoveries about matter\u2019s\nstructure were not conceived empirically, but only confirmed\nempirically; they were initially conceived as possibilities through\nthe hypothetico-deductive model, and the predictions deduced from the\nmodels were then compared to empirical data (Jolley 2002, p. 69). Yet\nas Jolley also points out, these commentators may have missed the full\nimport of Locke\u2019s geometric model; in a passage quoted earlier,\nLocke tells us explicitly that if we knew the real essence of gold, we\ncould deduce its qualities even if the metal did not\n exist.[16]\n So while the predictions of any model developed via the\nhypothetico-deductive model must survive the test of observations,\nobservations in Locke\u2019s scientia are wholly\nunnecessary. To put the point another way, Locke takes natural\nphilosophy to be an empirical domain only for human beings, whose\nfaculties are impoverished. For nobler spirits, it would resemble\ngeometry.\n",
