But to do this, they have also\nhad to critique the early phenomenologists attachment to universalizing\nhuman experience. For example, they have shown how particular social\nconditions, rather than universal ones, create and sustain the\npossibility of an unreflective consciousness that phenomenologists once\ntook to be the universal default. Non-dominant identities rarely have\nthe privilege of a relaxed absence of self-consciousness. In contrast,\ndominant groups have not needed to thematize their identity as, for\nexample, white or male (Ngo 2017).\n\nAs early as 1944, Sartre began to apply his concept of \u201cbad\nfaith\u201d to anti-Semitism (Sartre 1946 [1948]; Vogt 2003). \u201cBad\nfaith\u201d is the term Sartre used to describe how one lies to\noneself about the constitutive elements of the human condition\u2014most\nnotably, the inevitability of death and the responsibility we must bear\nfor our choices, even those choices constrained by social\nconditions\u2014as a way to avoid the existential angst this condition\nproduces. \u201cWe have here a basic fear of oneself and truth\u201d\n(Sartre 1946 [1948, 18]). Anti-Semitism works similarly, Sartre argued, by\nattempting to avoid the necessity of self-creation. The status of the\nGentile as constitutionally superior is rendered solid and impermeable\nno matter what one does because of its contrast with the Jew: every\ndecision the Gentile makes is legitimate, while every decision the Jew\nmakes is corrupt. Anti-Semites are intentionally antagonistic to facts\nor reasoning that would challenge their view; hence Sartre calls it a\nform of faith. Gordon took up this idea as the basis for understanding\nanti-black racism, which is motivated by the desire to maintain the\nmoral goodness and intellectual superiority of whiteness despite any\ncontrary evidence.\n\nThe use of the concept of bad faith in this way challenges\nHusserl\u2019s hopeful view about our ability to critique the natural\nattitude, given the power of bad faith\u2019s temptations and its\nintransigence to reason. But in this way, the phenomenological approach\nto race and racism has helped to reveal racism\u2019s persistence.\n\nThe phenomenological approach has also taken up the way in which\nracial identities and racisms refigure the temporal dimensions of human\nexistence. In line with Ortega, both Edouard Glissant (1989) and\nOctavio Paz (1950 [1961]) argued that in colonized spaces there can be a\nplural sense of temporality that takes a distinct form: an experience\nof the temporality of progress and development put forward by the\ndominant mainstream alongside a sensation of the static, petrified\nconditions of the marginalized periphery, creating a fractured sense of\none\u2019s temporal context that can lead to ennui. Alia Al-Saji has\nargued that understanding these diverse temporalities is key to seeing\nhow self-other relations can be short-circuited when the dominant\nperceive the marginal as existing in a distinct time-space that is\n\u201cbehind\u201d (2013, 2014). This justifies replacing dialogue\nwith pedagogy: explaining to the other how they can advance. The\ndiverse temporalities instituted by colonization, and the subsequent\npolitics of memory they engender and sometimes enforce, is a central\ntheme of decolonial philosophy today, making use of phenomenological\nwork from Fanon, Emmanuel Levinas, and other victims of racism and\nanti-Semitism to assess the aspects of our natural attitudes still\nhidden to ourselves. Further, despite the permanence of existential\ntemptations toward rendering oneself as solid and thus secure, in\ntruth, we are always in a state of becoming, with possibilities of\nplayfulness and imaginative self-creation that can lend hope for the\nbattle against racism.\n",
