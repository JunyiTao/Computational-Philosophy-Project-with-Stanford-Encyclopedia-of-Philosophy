    "main_text": "The Structure of Impossible Worlds\n4. The Structure of Impossible Worlds\n\nAnother issue which theories of impossible worlds disagree on concerns\nthe amount of logical structure such worlds have. This issue\naffects impossible worlds specifically: there is no correlative issue\nconcerning possible worlds (beyond our choice of logic). Various\nclasses of impossible worlds display different degrees of anarchic\nlogical behavior: as we shall see, non-normal worlds for non-normal\nmodal logics\n (section 5.1),\n for instance, are such that only modal sentences behave in a\nnon-standard fashion at them, whereas sentences that include just the\nBoolean operators of classical logic get the standard treatment. Such\nworlds appear to be logically more structured than fully anarchic\n\u201copen\u201d worlds\n (section 5.3).\n For, we shall see, even principles of classical logic involving only\nthe extensional, truth-functional connectives can fail at open worlds:\ntheir openness consists in their not being closed under any\nnon-trivial logical consequence principle.\n\nShould we require impossible worlds to comply with any\nlogical rules? And if we allow different classes of impossible worlds,\neach exhibiting different degrees of logical structure, can these\nclasses be ordered in a meaningful way? This section focuses on these\ntwo issues.\n",
