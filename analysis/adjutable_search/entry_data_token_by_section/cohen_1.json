    "main_text": "The Interpretation of Kant\n2. The Interpretation of Kant\n\nAs we have just seen, Cohen was committed to three ideas: first, an\nidealism according to which a priori laws of human knowledge determine\nwhat counts as an object for us; second, his methodological\nrationalism, and third, the \u201ctranscendental method\u201d (Edel\n1988). His early interpretation of Kant reveals these commitments in\nnascent form. It also reveals a problem that would occupy him\nthroughout his later writings on epistemology and philosophy of\nscience: the problem of explaining the origin of the a priori laws in\nhuman knowledge.\n\nIn 1871 Cohen published a long essay, \u201cOn the Controversy\nbetween Trendelenburg and Kuno Fischer,\u201d and a book, the first\nedition of Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience. They were both\ndefenses of Kant against objections that Cohen thought badly\nmisunderstood his views on objectivity and the a priori. Cohen was\nresponding to an interpretation of Kant in the 1860s commonly held by\nfigures of the Back-to-Kant movement such as Hermann von Helmholtz and\nCohen\u2019s own senior colleague at Marburg, F.A. Lange, as well as\nby non-Kantian philosophers such as Adolf Trendelenburg. Very roughly,\nthese figures thought that Kant held (or that Kantian philosophers\nought to hold) that the character of human knowledge is determined by\nboth objective and subjective factors. On one hand, there are objects\nthat exist independently of the subject\u2019s mind. These objects\naffect the subject\u2019s mind, and in so doing contribute the\nobjective element to the subject\u2019s representations. On the other\nhand, there are structures in the subject\u2019s mind\u2014say, the\nforms of human intuition, space and time. Because these structures are\nin the subject\u2019s mind and thus don\u2019t come from experience,\nthey are a priori. Further, these a priori structures organize the\nsubject\u2019s representations and thereby contribute a subjective,\nmind-dependent element to them. But since on this interpretation of\nKant the a priori is subjective, an explanation of knowledge\u2019s\nobjectivity must appeal not to it, but to the objects that exist\nindependently of the mind.\n\nCohen thought this interpretation of Kant was wrong, and he thought\nthat influential objections to Kant depended on it. Cohen was\nespecially concerned with Trendelenburg\u2019s well-known\n\u201cneglected alternative\u201d objection to Kant\u2019s claim\nthat space and time are nothing but the forms of intuition. But Cohen\nwas also concerned with J.F. Herbart\u2019s (and in Cohen\u2019s own\ntime, Helmholtz\u2019s) contention that Kant thought spatial\nrepresentations were innate. Since Cohen thought both\nTrendelenburg\u2019s and Herbart\u2019s objections depended on a\nmisinterpretation of Kant, he thought those objections failed. He\nresponded to them by defending an alternative account of the relation\nbetween objectivity and the Kantian a priori (K\u00f6hnke 1991,\n175\u20138; Patton 2005). (See Biagioli 2014 and Biagioli 2018 for a\nbroadly sympathetic account of Cohen\u2019s response to Helmholtz in\nparticular; Hyder 2013 offers a defense of Helmholtz on geometry\nagainst Cohen\u2019s criticisms of him.)\n\nThus Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience is above all an\nattempt to articulate and defend Cohen\u2019s alternative\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s a priori. On that interpretation,\nKant\u2019s aim in the Critique of Pure Reason is to show\nhow a priori laws of human thought explain the character of our\nexperience of objects. For Cohen, because these a priori laws are\nnecessary, they are objective. So Kant\u2019s explanation of\nobjective experience appeals to them, and not to the effects of any\nalleged mind-independent objects.\n\nCohen argues that there are three different \u201clevels\u201d or\n\u201cdegrees\u201d of Kant\u2019s a priori. He claims that the\nfirst of these is inessential for Kant\u2019s philosophy, and\nconsists in the apparently permanent \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nstructures we can discover in our own thought by means of\nintrospection. The second level of the a priori consists in the forms\nof sensibility and the understanding, that is, space, time, and the\ncategories. But the necessity of these forms ultimately derives from\nthe necessity of the third level of the a priori, because the forms of\nsensibility and understanding are \u201cscientific\nabstractions\u201d (Cohen 1987 [1871b], 83\u201384) from that third\nlevel. The third level is thus the most important of the three levels.\nCohen argues that a priori laws in this most important, third sense\nconsist in the \u201cformal conditions of the possibility of\nexperience.\u201d Or, as he also sometimes puts it, the a priori in\nthis third sense consists in laws that are \u201cconstitutive\nof\u201d of the possibility of experience. For Cohen, these\nnecessary, a priori laws define what an object of experience\nis for us. (Klaus Christian K\u00f6hnke identifies this point\nin Cohen as the source of the central Marburg School doctrine that a\npriori laws \u201cgenerate\u201d objects of possible experience\n[K\u00f6hnke 1991, 178\u201384].)\n\nCohen has a striking view of what a priori laws of the third level\nactually consist in, and of the possible experience they are\nconstitutive of. Although he would emphasize this striking view more\nin later writings it is nevertheless explicit in the first edition of\nhis Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience. He did not think the\nthird level of the a priori consists in cognitive structures in the\nsubject\u2019s mind, structures we could discover by doing physiology\n(as, for example Helmholtz and Lange thought) or by introspection (as,\nfor example, J.F. Fries and, in Cohen\u2019s own time, J\u00fcrgen\nBona Meyer thought) (de Schmidt 1976: Ch. 2.3). Rather, he insisted\nthat these a priori laws were the principles of mathematics and the\nfundamental laws of pure natural science, that is, mechanics. Further,\nthese principles and laws are constitutive of the possibility of\nexperience in a very specific and, Cohen insists, Kantian sense of\n\u201cexperience\u201d: for Cohen, experience consists in the\ntheories furnished by the mathematically precise science of nature,\nconsidered as if laid out \u201cin printed books\u201d (Cohen 1877,\n27). That is, on Cohen\u2019s interpretation, Kant\u2019s a priori\nis not principally concerned with the cognitive activity of the\nknower. Rather, it consists in the laws of mathematically precise\nnatural science considered independently of \u2013 as if\nfree-floating from \u2013 the mind of any particular knower. (At the\nsame time, Charlotte Baumann (2019) argues that, in at least some of\nhis writings, Cohen does retain some concern with the role of\nsensation in experience.)\n\nCohen\u2019s interpretation of Kant is thus robustly\nanti-psychologistic: he thinks any consideration of how the human mind\noperates to produce representations is completely irrelevant to a\nphilosophical account of knowledge\u2019s objective validity. In\nfact, some commentators have argued that Cohen offers the first\ngenuinely anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Pure Reason (Hatfield 1990, 110; Anderson 2005,\n298; and Beiser 2015, 466). On a standard account, Cohen\u2019s\nanti-psychologism was motivated, most fundamentally, by a desire to\nensure that the objective validity of knowledge was not, on his\naccount, undermined by the subjectivity of sensation (see especially\nEdel 2010: 60ff). More recently, Beiser has argued that Cohen\u2019s\nanti-psychologism was a response to the materialism controversy and\nCohen\u2019s religious antipathy to any attempt to naturalize the\nhuman subject (Beiser 2014, 466). Alternatively, Paul Nahme has\nsuggested that Cohen\u2019s anti-psychologism might even have been a\nresponse to the physiological orientation of so-called scientific\nracists and anti-Semites (Nahme 2019, 163). \n\nDespite the robustness of Cohen\u2019s anti-psychologism, it is not\nalways easy to locate in his writings. On almost every page of\nKant\u2019s Theory of Experience (and later, The Logic\nof Pure Knowledge) Cohen helps himself to the language of\ntranscendental idealism and transcendental psychology, giving the\nimpression of an active, conscious mind, with faculties of sensibility\nand understanding that produce the subject\u2019s experience of\nobjects. But, Cohen insists, this language is actually\nanti-psychologistic: understood properly, the Kantian\u2019s talk of\ncognitive faculties really refers to the methods of mathematically\nprecise natural science. Thus the \u201cfaculty\u201d of sensibility\nis really just the methods by which the mathematician constructs\nspatial magnitudes, and the \u201cfaculty\u201d of understanding is\nreally just the most basic set of concepts the physicist uses to\nrepresent physical objects (Cohen 1885, 586ff.) Kantian theory of\nknowledge thus turns out to be the philosophical investigation of the\nmethods natural science uses to represent objects.\n",
