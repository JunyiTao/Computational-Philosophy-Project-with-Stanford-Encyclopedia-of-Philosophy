    "main_text": "Causality, Knowledge and Necessity || Knowing Causal Propositions: Demonstration\n5. Final Causes\n\n\nWe often find in Aristotle and in the literature influenced by him\nan enumeration of four types of cause: formal, material, efficient and\nfinal. The first two are uses of \u2018cause\u2019 in a somewhat\nwider sense than is current nowadays: the term here simply means\n\u2018explanation in general\u2019 (Ockham, Expositio\nPhysicorum II, c11: Opera Philosophica IV, p. 348), and\nexplanations by means of matter and form were common both in Aristotle\nand in the literature. Efficient causes are what we would now simply\ncall \u2018causes\u2019. Final causes, however, are problematic: a\nfinal cause is an end or a purpose, and, whereas it is clear that\nrational agents act for the sake of ends, it is not clear that\nmuch else does. Furthermore, it also seems clear to us that the\ncausality of a rationally pursued goal can be reduced to efficient\ncausality.\n\n\nAristotle, however, has a much stronger position on final causality:\nhe believes that there are processes in nature (the growing of a tree,\nfor example) which are completed and regulated by a final state, or\nend, towards which they tend. As Adams puts it,\nAccording to Aristotelian metaphysics, natures are\ncomplexes of powers. When appropriately coordinated, the collective\nexercise of such powers converges on an end. In the sublunary world,\nelemental powers are simple and deterministic. Even where more complex\nliving things are concerned, the \u201ccoordination\u201d of their\npowers is \u201cbuilt-in\u201d in such a fashion that \u2013 given\nrelevant circumstances \u2013 they function to achieve their\nend. (Adams 1996, p. 499)\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s natural science tends to be governed by the biological\nparadigm, and it is clear that, for him, final causes in this strong\nsense are extremely pervasive. He also argues in the Physics\nthat natural processes cannot all be explained by final causality\nalone, which implies that final causality cannot, in general, be\nreduced to efficient causality.\n\n\nThe medieval literature is far from unanimous on these questions.\nWilliam of Ockham, for example, who wrote several commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, and who discusses these questions at\nnumerous places in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics,\nhardly has a uniform position. He is quite happy with explanations of\nnatural phenomena by means of efficient causes in general, but he will\nalso often speak of final causes: what is unclear is whether the final\ncauses he speaks of (with varying degrees of strength in different\nworks) have any explanatory role to play that cannot be reduced to\nefficient causality (Adams 1998; cf. Goddu 1999).\n",
