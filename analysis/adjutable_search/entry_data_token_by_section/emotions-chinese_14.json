They began to show up in the mid to late Warring\nstates period. For example, the Analects and the\nMencius, although they discuss affective states of the mind,\ndo not list emotions in the form of xi nu (\u559c\u6012) or xi\nnu ai le (\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02). The Xunzi and the\nZhuangzi, however, list emotions in various forms that\ninclude xi nu ai le (\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02) (Bruya 2003; Eifring 2019;\nHarbsmeier 2004; Puett 2004). Harbsmeier (2004: 70) reports that terms\nthat refer to emotions such as xi (\u559c joy), nu (\u6012\nanger), ai (\u54c0 sadness), ju (\u61fc fear), ai\n(\u611b love), wu (\u60e1 disliking), and yu (\u6b32 desire)\nare not used in ancient Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. (Xi\n[\u559c] was only used as a proper name but not as a name for an\nemotion.) He also lists the following terms and points out that they\nare \u201cabsent in oracle bones and gradually emerge in the bronze,\nbamboo and silk inscriptions of later times\u201d (Harbsmeier 2004:\n70).\n\n\nxin \u5fc3 heart \nsi \u601d think of, long for \nnian \u5ff5 think about \nzhi \u5fd7 ambition, aspiration \nshen \u613c be careful about \nzhong \u5fe0 impartial, honest\ngong \u606d respect \nci \u6148 be loving \nwu \u609f understand \nwei \u6170 console\nmu \u6155 admire \nxu \u6064 show compassion \nyu \u611a be stupid\ndai \u6020 be lazy \nwang \u5fd8 forget \nhuo \u60d1 be confused\nji \u5fcc resent \nyuan \u6028 resent \nnu \u6012 be angry\nhui \u6094 regret \nbei \u60b2 be sad \ngan \u611f be moved\nkong \u6050 be terrified \nlian \uf98f love\n\n\n\nThe absence of these terms in the ancient Chinese inscriptions, as\nHarbsmeier (2004) explains, do not imply that ancient Chinese had no\nconceptions of emotions or other psychological states. Nor does it\nmean that these terms were not used in ancient China outside the\nrecord keeping purposes of the inscriptions. It simply means that the\nconception and the public discourse of emotions (including writing and\ncompiling texts with these psychological terms) had been changed and\nnew terms had been developed in ancient China, specifically during the\nWarring States period. It is important to note that some of the terms\nin this list (such as \u201cto be lazy\u201d and \u201cto be\nterrified\u201d) are related to behavioral or embodied states, i.e.,\nstates that are experienced by or manifested in the body. That is, in\nancient Chinese texts, the domain of the mind is not limited to the\ninternal or representational states. It is extended to bodily states\nas well.\n",
