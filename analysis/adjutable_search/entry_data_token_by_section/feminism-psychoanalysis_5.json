    "main_text": "French Feminism || Subjectivity, Alterity, and Alienation\n4.2 Subjectivity, Alterity, and Alienation\n\nWhile often grouped together in cursory overviews of so-called French\nFeminism, Irigaray and Kristeva have fundamentally disparate projects\n(and locations in the academy), both with regard to their critical\nanalyses and with regard to their political enterprises. Whereas\nIrigaray was a student of Lacan who breaks with (even as she is\ninspired by) his teachings from her earliest work, Kristeva has a much\nmore ambiguous relationship to his school of thought and was never his\nstudent or attended his seminars. Their respective views can perhaps\nbest be captured with respect to their attitude toward the symbolic\nviolence of castration (the Oedipal Complex) and the social contract.\nAs explained above, Irigaray envisions a sexuate culture that would\novercome the Oedipal demands of a sacrificial economy and restore\nfeminine genealogies to the work of civilization. Kristeva, by\ncontrast, argues that there is no subjectivity beyond sacrifice and\ndoes not believe Oedipus can or should be overcome. Kristeva and\nIrigaray do not form a cohort and they do not respond to each\nother\u2019s writings. But they both have psychoanalytic training and\npractices and both attend to the body and the drives, taking up the\ntheme of loss or exile of the mother\u2019s body and the impact of\nmatricide on social relations. Kristeva even (echoing Irigaray)\ncondemns humanism as \u201cthe fraternity of the same\u201d\n(Kristeva 1998: 168) and, like Irigaray, she plays with writing style,\noffering experimental, innovative, sometimes imagistic portraits of\npsychical moods, maternal practices, and artistic endeavors.\n\nKristeva\u2019s connection to feminist thought is also unsettled and\nvolatile, although her focus on questions pertaining to language,\nfemininity, and the maternal body has made her work amenable to\nfeminist interest and development. In her essay \u201cWomen\u2019s\nTime,\u201d she classifies the feminist movement into three distinct\ntimes or generations, each with its own approach to and vision of\njustice. The first generation is universalist in principle and aspires\nto give women a place within history and the social contract; this\ngeneration takes equality as its mission and asserts women\u2019s\nidentification with the dominant values of rationality. Kristeva\naligns Beauvoir with this project of pursuing access to universal\nsubjectivity. The second generation is reactive, rejecting the idea of\nassimilation to values taken to be masculine; this generation insists\non feminine difference. While Kristeva does not mention Irigaray, it\nseems clear that Kristeva would align her with this strategy and the\nproject of recognizing feminine specificity. In Kristeva\u2019s view,\nthe first generation is so committed to universal equality that it\ndenies bodily difference, and the second generation is so committed to\ndifference that it refuses to partake of a history it deems to be\nmasculine. The third generation follows neither the path of fixing\nidentity nor the path of neutralizing difference in the medium of\nuniversality. Instead it embraces ambiguity and non-identity,\nrespecting both the value of participating in historical time and the\nineluctability of bodily difference. The third generation recognizes\nthat it is as embodied beings that we enter into the social contract\nand community with others.\n\nSince Kristeva believes that there is no subjectivity and no sociality\nwithout the violence of the symbolic contract and the splitting of\nsubjectivity, the feminism that she proposes would not take refuge\nfrom this violence either by standing outside history (as the second\ngeneration does), or by denying women\u2019s bodies and desires (as\nthe first generation does). Taking seriously the intransigence of\nsexual difference, and the violent fractures within and of identity,\nKristeva advocates feminist support for alienation that would not\npretend to reconcile the rupture between body and law (what Lacan\ncalls castration) and would refuse the solace of identity.\nKristeva mentions the bodily experience of pregnancy, an experience of\nbeing split, of being two in one, as manifesting the instability of,\nand alterity within, identity.\n\nThis insistence on the fragility and precariousness of identity can be\ngrasped in the first instance by looking at Kristeva\u2019s\nunderstanding of the drives and language. Kristeva introduces the\nnotion of the semiotic as the affective dimension of language that\nfacilitates its energetic movement. The semiotic is the materiality of\nlanguage, its tonal and rhythmic qualities, its bodily force. In\nKristeva\u2019s account, the drives are not simply excluded by\nlanguage but also inscribed as an alien element within it. While more\nprimitive than signification, the semiotic participates in signifying\npractices.\n\nKristeva\u2019s elaboration of the semiotic situates it at a point\nprior to the Lacanian imaginary, i.e., prior to the moment at which\nthe infant identifies with its own ego and distinguishes itself from\nan object. Still in porous relation to another body, without clear\nborders or limits, the infant is propelled by the anarchic,\nheterogenous, rhythmic flow of drive energy \u201cwhich has no thesis\nand no position\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 26]). Mobile and\nprovisional, moving through the body of the not-yet subject, the\nsemiotic is a chaotic force anterior to language, unlocalizable\nbecause it courses through an as yet undifferentiated materiality in\nwhich the infantile body is not yet distinct from the maternal body.\nKristeva calls this stage pre-thetic since it is prior to the reign of\npropositions, judgments, positions, and theses, these being subsequent\npossibilities that might arrest or seize a movement that always\nexceeds them. Since the image is itself a kind of sign, a first\nrepresentation, the advent of the imaginary demarcates the first\nthetic break, a break from nature and into the realm of convention.\nWhat Kristeva means by the thetic then includes both the imaginary\n(the mirror stage) and the symbolic (the Oedipal Complex) dimensions\nof Lacan. Only with the advent of the thetic phase, the\n\u201cthreshold of language\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 45]), can\nthere be said to be signification proper along with negation as\njudgment. In thereby altering Lacan\u2019s understanding of the\nimaginary or mirror stage, she attends to the pre-Oedipal mother/child\nrelation in a way he does not, while also elaborating on an\nunderdeveloped theme in Freud\u2019s work.\n\nFreud distinguishes between auto-erotism and primary narcissism,\nattributing to the latter a new psychical action. While auto-erotism\nprecedes the formation of the ego and the individuation of the self,\nprimary narcissism only ensues with the preliminary development of\negoic unity, when the ego is able to demarcate itself from the\nsurrounding world and take itself for an object. The semiotic\ncorresponds to the diffuse drive energy of auto-erotism and Kristeva\ntakes up Freud\u2019s challenge to assess the psychical action of\nego-formation that enables primary narcissism, which she attributes to\na primary identification with the imaginary father. In Tales of\nLove, which jumps off from Freud\u2019s claim in The Ego and\nthe Id that identification with the father of individual\npre-history is prior to and more primary than object-cathexis,\nKristeva offers an original account of the pre-Oedipal period, finding\na paternal figure there. Since the bond of identification precedes any\nbond with objects, the imaginary father is what makes possible the\ninitial separation between ego and object, or rather proto-ego and\nproto-object. This father is not the first object, but the first\nidentification, making language and love possible, movement within and\namong a world of others. This identification, Kristeva hypothesizes,\nalters maternal space, interrupts it with something beyond its\nborders. But it also indicates that there is a preliminary pre-thetic\nsymbolic capacity at work in infantile life. As the drives expel,\ndetach, or isolate a proto-object, the space of differentiation is\nsupported by identification with the imaginary father, who holds it\nopen. The imaginary father is here associated with love (unlike the\nsymbolic father who is associated with law), an invitation to language\nand subjectivity, to become a being who can have relations with\nothers.\n\nKristeva accepts Freud\u2019s insight that the thetic break, or the\nprohibitory break of the Oedipal Complex and the dead father, that\nfounds law and sociality is violent and murderous (Kristeva 1974\n[1984: 70]). The capacity for representation transforms our perceptual\nuniverse, entailing that no bodily immediacy is possible, that all\nexperience will be mediated by significatory practices and filtered\nthrough the ego\u2019s organization. But although this rent in\nexperience is suffered by the signifying child as a loss to be\nmourned, it is also, Kristeva claims, a gift, the gift of a self that\ncan navigate language. With words and memories available, the child\ncan compensate for the loss of objects in perception (in the exemplary\ncase, learning to endure the mother\u2019s absence). On\nKristeva\u2019s view, \u201cthe structural violence of\nlanguage\u2019s irruption as the murder of soma, the transformation\nof the body, the captation of drives\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984:\n75]), is preceded by a loving father who makes possible the\npreliminary individuation of the infant from the mother. Although\nsymbolic violence is integral to the maintenance of a social order,\nthe promise of language on Kristeva\u2019s account is initially\nbrought forward by love, not by law. Unlike Irigaray, who wants to\nretrieve the pre-Oedipal period in order to reclaim feminine\ngenealogies, Kristeva wants only to redescribe it in order to reassess\nits import for individuation and creative self-transformation. She\ntakes infantile matricide (separation from the mother) to be a\nnecessary condition of subjectivity and not a remnant of patriarchal\nviolence.\n\nStill, Kristeva charts differing arcs for the paternal and maternal\nrelationships in the constitution of subjectivity. The imaginary\nfather empowers a new psychic space premised on the distinction\nbetween internal and external, self and other. The breaking in of the\nsignifier inaugurates individuation, the assumption of bodily form and\ncorporeal unity, and thereby entails loss of the maternal body. In\nKristeva\u2019s view, matricide, repression of the maternal body, is\na necessary event on the way to subjectivity. The bodily exchange\nbetween mother and child can serve as a barrier to love, imprisoning\nthe child in an overwhelming bond. The loving mother provides the\nfirst approach to language and law by demonstrating love for an object\nwho is not the child, a third outside this dyad who makes the dyadic\nrelationship itself possible and releases the emotional pressure of\nit. The loving father proffers a kind of promise, even as he disrupts\nfusion with the mother, allowing and encouraging the child to\nrepresent itself. Kristeva\u2019s thought here follows Lacan\u2019s\nidea that a mother whose only object of desire is her child will\nproduce a child who cannot move beyond the psychosis of being the\nphallus for her.\n\nSignification and language are sites of sublimation, creative workings\nout of the drives, but they can be stalled by abjection and\nmelancholia which are both preconditions for, but also limits to,\nsubjectification. Kristeva identifies abjection and melancholia as\nsites of psychical (and social) crisis rooted in narcissistic\ndisorder. In them, the tenuous processes of ego-formation risk\ncollapse; faced with difficulty clarifying the boundaries of the self,\nthe subject reverts to ambivalent aggressivity. While Kristeva\nunderstands narcissism to be a fundamental, if unstable, structure of\nthe psyche, abjection and melancholia are problematic relations to the\nmaternal body and its loss (or the malfunctioning of its loss). They\nare experiences of disintegration or dissolution of the ego without\nreorganization, but also of its rabid fortification.\n\nIn Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, the abject is\ndescribed as neither inside nor outside, neither subject nor object,\nneither self nor other, troubling identity and order with the\ninstability of boundaries, borders, and limits. Kristeva offers the\nexamples of bodily fluids, sweat, blood, pus, milk, as non-objects\nthat are banished in the course of ego-formation. These non-objects\nalso include the mother\u2019s body; indeed the maternal body is a\nprivileged site of abjection, as it is that which must be excluded in\norder for individuation and separation to take place, so that one can\ndistinguish self from other and establish a dyadic (imaginary)\nrelation out of undifferentiated maternal space or the semiotic\nchora, the pre-spatial relation of fluid (although not\nentirely unregulated) drives. The abject can then also be called the\nprimally repressed, primal because prior not only to the secondary\nsymbolic prohibition of the incest taboo or Oedipal Complex, but also\nprior to the establishment of any identity.\n\nThe abject is horrifying, repellent, but also fascinating; it is\nstrange but familiar. The process of abjection is not merely a symptom\nof phobia or borderline disorder, but a necessary and even recurring\nordeal in any subject\u2019s transition to identification with the\nfather and accession to language. It is the most archaic form of\nnegativity, an exclusion or expulsion which functions by securing the\nborders of self, carving a space, marking a divide, out of which the\nego can emerge. Kristeva calls it the violent attempt \u201cto\nrelease the hold of maternal entity\u201d (Kristeva 1980\n[1982: 13]) or rather what will have been the mother, since this\nprocess establishes the distinction between the maternal body and the\ninfant in the first place, making possible primary narcissism. The\nabject exposes the precariousness of the subject/object divide, the\nfragility of identity, the need to constitute oneself against the\nthreat of, and desire for, dissolution.\n\nAlthough this is not primarily Kristeva\u2019s concern, abjection can\nalso be understood as a social phenomenon, one with political\nimplications. The psychically primitive experience of egoic\ninstability can be propelled into the political realm, and be socially\naccentuated or reinforced. In abjection, subjects confront what they\nmust exclude or expel in order to maintain identity, that is, they\nconfront their own dependency, mortality, finitude, and materiality.\nThis strangeness experienced at the porous edges of identity can\nrebound into troubling relations with others, including especially\nwith others who are perceived as lacking intelligible identity,\nsocially marginal, or refusing cultural assimilation. While\nKristeva\u2019s own focus is less on what is abjected than the\nprocess of abjection, that is, less on the expelled non-object than on\nthe violence of separation that brings objects (and others) into\nbeing, her work provides the theoretical underpinnings to ask\nquestions about who bears the burden of abjection, how and why some\nare figured as inhuman, animal, or alien. Her analysis of abjection\nexposes the ways in which social life is dependent on jettisoning or\ncontaining disorder and disruption, and managing the fear of\ncontamination.\n\nThe confusion of borders, the ambivalent relation to maternal space at\nthe outskirts of narcissism, also motivates melancholia. The idea of\nthe maternal as the primally repressed recurs in Black Sun:\nDepression and Melancholia, where Kristeva claims,\n\u201cmatricide is our vital necessity\u201d (Kristeva 1987 [1989:\n27]), the founding partition that facilitates the birth and growth of\nthe ego. Kristeva praises the child, the \u201cintrepid\nwanderer\u201d who \u201cleaves the crib to meet the mother in the\nrealm of representations\u201d (1987 [1989: 41]). Maintaining that\nthe organization of the psyche is premised on loss, Kristeva also\nunderstands that the suffering entailed by loss can derail the\nformation of a self, that loss itself can become the dominant reality\nfor some who are unable to establish a secure relation to themselves.\nWhile mourning, for Kristeva as for Freud, enables a\nsubject to, gradually and painfully, let go of loss by establishing a\nrelation in language to it, melancholia is a practice which enables\nthe subject to hold onto lost objects, most especially the mother or,\nbetter, the dead (or repressed) mother. The loving father facilitates\nmourning and linguistic creativity; the deadening mother disables\nself-creation. The generation of the ego out of expulsion, the\ndivision of unity, is not simply a mournful moment, but also\npotentially a joyous one, in which the advent of language, the promise\nof the father, offers reparation and life with a world of others, so\nthat words can provide the nourishment that the breast previously had.\nThe father makes it possible to fill the void with language and the\nformation of signifying bonds.\n\nIn Kristeva\u2019s understanding of melancholic breakdown, the\nproblem is similar to the one discussed above in the section on\nIrigaray, namely that loss goes unnamed and unmourned but thereby\nstays unprocessed within, leaving the subject stagnant and inert.\nWomen, in Kristeva\u2019s view, suffer the loss of creativity, the\nincapacity for sublimation, more severely than men. Women\u2019s\naccess to language, and creative self-transformation, is more\nvulnerable to disturbance both because of the (previously discussed)\ninexorable repression of their pre-Oedipal relation to the mother and\nbecause they have greater difficulty establishing a primary\nidentification with the father. Whereas the loss of the archaic bond\nwith the maternal body is (potentially) sublated by men into the\nrhythms of language, for women it often becomes a dead space where\nonce there was life, filled only with loss and emptiness. Imprisoned\nby an undead, unmourned, mother, excluded from language or\nrepresentation, women are vulnerable to the devastations of symbolic\nsacrifice without recompense.\n\nPsychoanalysis is presented as a counter-depressant, as are art and\nwriting, able not only to keep the drives or semiotic forces moving\nthrough language but also to foster their revolutionary potential to\ntransgress symbolic limits and laws and to creatively rework self and\nsociety. Accessing the drives and rhythms that symbolic law and order\ntypically repress, psychoanalytic practice, like the poetic text,\nrevitalizes or reactivates the semiotic chora, a connection\nto the maternal body or to femininity. Such practices let loose the\ndisorganizing energies of the body, the pleasurable rupture of sense\nand nonsense. They take productive advantage of the dialectical\ndiscord between semiotic and symbolic and thus keep this discord\noriented toward dissent and protest rather than inner collapse.\n\nAlthough the semiotic resists the symbolic order, or cannot be\ncontained by it, the two are always entangled and imbricated in\nlanguage; drives both support and subvert the symbolic operation,\nbringing bodily rhythms and forces to signification, both impelling\nand pulling apart its organization and stases. This disruptive\npotential of semiotic drives and rhythms is associated with negativity\nas a force of revolt, an excess, most archaically, the force of bodily\nexpulsion, but more generally the forces that continually spur the\ndissolution of one\u2019s own organization. Negativity maintains\nlife, keeps it going by circulating energy, rendering the subject\nalways in process. Through its movement, the subject is not a rigid\nidentity, but always developing, reconfiguring itself through the\ninterplay of drives and language, in the tensions between body and\nmirror image and between mirror image and self.\n\nWhile Kristeva advocates for \u2018poetic revolution,\u2019 (meaning\nthe ongoing process of reconfiguring language and oneself by\nexploiting the heterogeneities between semiotic and symbolic\nelements), she is sometimes read as a conservative thinker because of\nher commitment to maintaining a symbolic order and social contract.\nThe danger of a too strong or too weak symbolic order is that it\nencourages a return to abjection or melancholia, to the point prior to\nego-formation, to a dissolution of the borders that maintain social\nlife and creative subjectivity, contributing to the ego\u2019s\ncollapse into an empty abyssal void and discouraging semiotic\ncreativity. Such a fragile, fragmented, disintegrating ego, always in\nsearch of objects to heal the rift of being, dreaming of a return to\nunity but suffering the nightmare of upheaval and collapse of\nidentity, is especially susceptible to the traumatic impact of\nencountering the stranger, the unfamiliar other or alien who provokes\nturmoil and who is repudiated in a rebound to delirious narcissism and\na reassertion of self-mastery and self-identity. The stranger disturbs\nboundaries, indicating the failure to fully eliminate the refuse of\nidentity and purify oneself. Kristeva sees in the ethics of\npsychoanalysis, premised on self-division, being strange to oneself,\nthe possibility of establishing an ethical relation to alterity,\ninviting it into our political bonds (and warding off the most\nvirulent forms of abjection). Where Irigaray aims to introduce sexual\ndifference into the social contract and the domain of law and rights,\nKristeva proposes that we introduce self-discord.\n",
