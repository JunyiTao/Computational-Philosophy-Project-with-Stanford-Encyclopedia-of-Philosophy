    "main_text": "Aristotle\n4. Aristotle\n\nThe moral theory of Aristotle, like that of Plato, focuses on virtue,\nrecommending the virtuous way of life by its relation to happiness.\nHis most important ethical work, Nicomachean Ethics, devotes\nthe first book to a preliminary account of happiness, which is then\ncompleted in the last chapters of the final book, Book X. This account\nties happiness to excellent activity of the soul. In subsequent books,\nexcellent activity of the soul is tied to the moral virtues and to the\nvirtue of \u201cpractical wisdom\u201d \u2013 excellence in\nthinking and deciding about how to behave. This approach to moral\ntheory depends on a moral psychology that shares a number of\naffinities with Plato\u2019s. However, while for Plato the theory of\nforms has a role in justifying virtue, Aristotle notoriously rejects\nthat theory. Aristotle grounds his account of virtue in his theory\nabout the soul \u2013 a topic to which he devotes a separate\ntreatise, de Anima.\n\nAristotle opens the first book of the Nicomachean Ethics by\npositing some one supreme good as the aim of human actions,\ninvestigations, and crafts (1094a). Identifying this good as\nhappiness, he immediately notes the variations in the notion\n(1095a15\u201325). Some think the happy life is the life of\nenjoyment; the more refined think it is the life of political\nactivity; others think it is the life of study or theoretical\ncontemplation (1095b10\u201320). The object of the life of enjoyment\nis bodily pleasure; that of political activity is honor or even\nvirtue. The object of the life of study is philosophical or scientific\nunderstanding. Arguing that the end of human life must be the most\ncomplete, he concludes that happiness is the most complete end.\nWhereas pleasure, honor, virtue, and understanding are choice-worthy\nin themselves, they are also chosen for the sake of happiness.\nHappiness is not chosen for the sake of anything else\n(1097a25\u20131097b5). That the other choice-worthy ends are chosen\nfor the sake of happiness might suggest that they are chosen only as\ninstrumental means to happiness, as though happiness were a separate\nstate. However, it is more likely that the other choice-worthy ends\nare constituents of happiness. As a consequence, the happy life is\ncomposed of such activities as virtuous pursuits, honorable acts, and\ncontemplation of truth. While conceiving these choice-worthy ends as\nconstituents of happiness might be illuminating, it does, in turn,\nraise the issue of whether happiness is a jumble of activities or\nwhether it requires organization \u2013 even prioritization \u2013\nof the constituents.\n\nNext, Aristotle turns to his own account of happiness, the summit of\nBook I. The account depends on an analogy with the notion of function\nor characteristic activity or work (ergon). A flutist has a\nfunction or work, i.e., playing the flute. The key idea for Aristotle\nis that the good of flute players (as such) is found in their\nfunctioning as a flutist. By analogy, if there is a human function,\nthe good for a human is found in this function (1097b20\u201330).\nAristotle then turns to the human soul. He argues that, in fact, there\nis a human function, to be found in the human soul\u2019s\ncharacteristic activity, i.e., the exercise of reason\n(1098a1\u201320). Then, without explanation, he makes the claim that\nthis rational function is expressed in two distinct ways: by\ndeliberating and issuing commands, on the one hand, and by obeying\nsuch commands, on the other. The part that has reason in itself\ndeliberates about decisions, both for the short term and the long. The\npart that obeys reason is that aspect of the soul, such as the\nappetites, that functions in a human being under the influence of\nreason. The appetites can fail to obey reason; but they at least have\nthe capacity to obey (as, for example, such autonomic functions as\nnutritive and metabolic ones do not).\n\nAristotle then argues that since the function of a human is to\nexercise the soul\u2019s activities according to reason, the function\nof a good human is to exercise well and finely the soul\u2019s\nactivities according to reason. Given the two aspects of reason that\nAristotle has distinguished, one can see that both can be well or\nbadly done. On the one hand, one can reason well or badly \u2013\nabout what to do within the next five minutes, twenty-four hours, or\nten years. On the other, actions motivated by appetites can be well or\nbadly done, and likewise having an appetite at all can sometimes not\nbe a well done, but a badly done, activity of the soul. Acting on the\ndesire for a drink from the wine cooler at a banquet is not always a\ngood idea, nor is having such a desire. According to Aristotle, the\ngood human being has a soul in which these functions are consistently\ndone well. Thus, good persons reason well about plans, short term or\nlong; and when they satisfy their appetites, and even when they\nhave appetites, it is in conformity with reason. Returning to\nthe question of happiness, Aristotle says the good for a human is to\nlive the way the good human lives, that is, to live with one\u2019s\nlife aimed at and structured by the same thing that the good human\nbeing aims at in his or her life. So, his account of happiness, i.e.,\nthe highest good for a human, is virtuous or excellent activity of the\nsoul. But he has not identified this virtuous activity with that of\nthe moral virtues, at this point. In fact, he says if there are many\nkinds of excellence, then human good is found in the active exercise\nof the highest. He is careful to point out that happiness is not just\nthe ability to function well in this way; it is the activity itself.\nMoreover, this activity must be carried out for a complete life. One\nswallow does not make a spring.\n\nAlthough the reference here to parts or aspects of the soul is\ncursory, it is influenced by Aristotle\u2019s theories in the de\nAnima. Fundamental to the human soul and to all living things,\nincluding plants, is nutrition and growth (415a20 ff). Next is\nsensation and locomotion; these functions are characteristic of\nanimals (416b30 ff). Aristotle associates appetite and desire with\nthis part of the soul (414b1\u20135). Thus we have a rough sketch of\nanimal life: animals, moved by appetite for food, go toward the\nobjects of desire, which are discerned by sensation. To these\nfunctions is added thought in the case of humans. Thought is both\ntheoretical and practical (427a 15\u201320). The bulk of the de\nAnima is devoted to explaining the nutritive, sensory, and\nrational functions; Aristotle considers desire and appetite as the\nsource of movement in other animals (432a15 ff), and these plus reason\nas its source in humans. In Nicomachean Ethics he focuses on\nthe role that appetite and desire, together with reason, play in the\nmoral drama of human life.\n\nIn chapter 8 of Book I, Aristotle explicitly identifies human good\nwith psychological good. Dividing goods into external goods, those of\nthe body, and those of the soul, he states that his account of\nhappiness agrees with those who hold it is a good of the soul. In\nfact, in this account, happiness is closely related to traditionally\nconceived psychological goods such as pleasure and moral virtue,\nalthough the nature of the relation has yet to be shown\n(1098b10\u201330). Still, in Book I Aristotle is laying the\nfoundation in his moral psychology for showing the link between the\nmoral virtues and happiness. In Book II he completes this foundation\nwhen he turns to the question of which condition of the soul is to be\nidentified with (moral) virtue, or virtue of character.\n\nIn II. 5, he says that conditions of the soul are either feelings\n(path\u00ea), capacities for feeling (dynameis) or\ndispositions (hexeis). Feelings are such things as appetite,\nanger, fear and generally those conditions that are accompanied by\npleasure and pain. Capacities are, for example, the simple capacity to\nhave these feelings. Finally, disposition is that condition of the\nsoul whereby we are well or badly off with respect to feelings. For\ninstance, people are badly disposed with respect to anger who\ntypically get angry violently or who typically get angry weakly\n(1105b20\u201330). Virtue, as a condition of the soul, will be one of\nthese three. After arguing that virtue is neither feeling nor\ncapacity, Aristotle turns to what it means to be well or badly off\nwith respect to feelings. He says that in everything that is\ncontinuous and divisible it is possible to take more, less, or an\nequal amount (1106a25). This remark is puzzling until we realize that\nhe is actually talking about feelings. Feelings are continuous and\ndivisible; so one can take more, less, or an equal amount of them.\nPresumably, when it comes to feeling anger, e.g., one can feel too\nmuch, not enough, or a balanced amount. Aristotle thinks that what\ncounts as too much, not enough, or a balanced amount can vary to some\nextent from individual to individual. At this point he is ready to\ncome back to moral virtue for it is concerned with feelings and\nactions (to which feelings give rise), in which one can have excess,\ndeficiency, or the mean. To have a feeling like anger at the right\ntime, on the right occasion, towards the right people, for the right\npurpose and in the right manner is to feel the right amount, the mean\nbetween extremes of excess and deficiency; this is the mark of moral\nvirtue (1106a15\u201320). Finally, virtue is not a question only of\nfeelings since there is a mean between extremes of action. Presumably,\nAristotle means that the appropriate feeling \u2013 the mean between\nthe extremes in each situation \u2013 gives rise to the appropriate\naction.\n\nAt last Aristotle is ready to discuss particular moral virtues.\nBeginning with courage, he mentions here two feelings, fear and\nconfidence. An excessive disposition to confidence is rashness and an\nexcessive disposition to fear and a deficiency in confidence is\ncowardice. When it comes to certain bodily pleasures and pains, the\nmean is moderation. While the excess is profligacy, deficiency in\nrespect of pleasures almost never occurs. Aristotle gives a fuller\naccount of both of these virtues in Book III; however, the basic idea\nremains. The virtue in each case is a mean between two extremes, the\nextremes being vices. Virtue, then, is a reliable disposition whereby\none reacts in relevant situations with the appropriate feeling \u2013\nneither excessive nor deficient \u2013 and acts in the appropriate\nway \u2013 neither excessively nor deficiently.\n\nTo complete the notion of moral virtue we must consider the role\nreason plays in moral actions. Summing up at Book II.6, Aristotle says\nvirtue is a disposition to choose, lying in the mean which is relative\nto us, determined by reason (1107a1). Since he is talking about\nchoosing actions, he is focusing on the way moral virtue issues in\nactions. In turn, it is the role of practical wisdom\n(phron\u00easis) to determine choice. While moral virtues,\nvirtues of character, belong to the part of the soul which can obey\nreason, practical wisdom is a virtue of the part of the soul that\nitself reasons. The virtues of thought, intellectual virtues, are\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea), comprehension\n(nous), wisdom (sophia), craft\n(techn\u00ea), and practical wisdom (1139b15\u201325). The\nfirst three grasp the truth about what cannot be otherwise and is not\ncontingent. A good example of knowledge about what cannot be otherwise\nis mathematics. Craft and practical wisdom pursue the truth that can\nbe had about what can be otherwise and is contingent. What can be\notherwise includes what is made \u2013 the province of craft \u2013\nand what is done \u2013 the province of practical wisdom (1140a1).\nWhile Aristotle\u2019s account of practical wisdom raises several\nproblems, we will focus on only two closely related issues. He says\nthat it is the mark of someone with practical wisdom to deliberate\nwell about what leads to the good for himself (to dunasthai\nkal\u00f4s bouleusasthai peri ta haut\u00f4(i) agatha). This\ngood is not specific, such as health and strength, but is living well\nin general (1140a25\u201330). This description of practical wisdom,\nfirst of all, implies that it deliberates about actions; it is a skill\nfor discerning those actions which hit the mean between the two\nextremes. However, the ambiguity of the phrase \u2018what leads to\nthe good\u2019 might suggest that practical wisdom deliberates only\nabout instrumental means to living well. Still since practical wisdom\ndetermines which actions hit the mean between two extremes, such\nactions are not instrumental means to living well \u2013 as though\nliving well were a separate state. Actions which hit the mean are\nparts of living well; the good life is composed of actions under the\nheadings of, for instance, honor and pleasure, which achieve the mean.\nIn addition, the deliberation of practical wisdom does not have to be\nconfined to determining which actions hit the mean. While Aristotle\nwould deny that anyone deliberates about whether happiness is the end\nof human life, we do deliberate about the constituents of happiness.\nSo, one might well deliberate about the ways in which honor and\npleasure fit into happiness.\n\nNow we can discern the link between morality and happiness. While\nhappiness itself is excellent or virtuous activity of the soul, moral\nvirtue is a disposition to achieve the mean between two extremes in\nfeeling and in action. The missing link is that achieving the mean is\nalso excellent activity of the soul. Activity that expresses the\nvirtue of courage, for example, is also the best kind of activity when\nit comes to the emotion of fear. Activity that expresses the virtue of\nmoderation is also excellent activity when it comes to the bodily\nappetites. In this way, then, the happy person is also the virtuous\nperson. However, in Book I Aristotle has already pointed out the\nproblem of bodily and external goods in relation to happiness. Even if\nhappiness is virtuous activity of the soul, in some cases these goods\nare needed to be virtuous \u2013 for example, one must have money to\nbe generous. In fact, the lack of good birth, good children, and\nbeauty can mar one\u2019s happiness for the happy person does not\nappear to be one who is altogether ugly, low born, solitary, or\nchildless, and even less so if he has friends and children who are\nbad, or good friends and children who then die\n(1099a30\u20131099b10). Aristotle is raising a problem that he does\nnot attempt to solve in this passage. Even if happiness is virtuous\nactivity of the soul, it does not confer immunity to the vicissitudes\nof life.\n\nAristotle\u2019s moral psychology has further implications for his\naccount of happiness. In Book I, chapter 7, he said that human good is\nvirtuous activity of the soul but was indefinite about the virtues. In\nmost of the Nicomachean Ethics he talks about the moral\nvirtues, leaving the impression that virtuous activity is the same as\nactivity associated with moral virtues. In Book X, however, Aristotle\nrevisits the issue of virtuous activity. If happiness, he says, is\nactivity in accordance with virtue, it will be activity in accordance\nwith the highest. The highest virtue belongs to the best part of the\nsoul, i.e., the intellect (nous) or the part that governs in\nthe soul and contemplates the fine and godly, being itself the divine\npart of the soul or that which is closest to the divine\n(1177a10\u201320). Up to this point, Aristotle has apparently been\ntalking about the man of political action and the happiness that is\nsuitable to rational, embodied human beings. Active in the life of the\ncity, this person exercises courage, moderation, liberality, and\njustice in the public arena. Now, instead of the life of an effective\nand successful citizen, Aristotle is holding up the life of study and\ncontemplation as the one that achieves happiness \u2013 that is, the\nhighest human good, the activity of the highest virtue. Such a life\nwould achieve the greatest possible self-sufficiency and\ninvulnerability (1177a30). Indeed, at first he portrays these two\nlives as so opposite that they seem incompatible.\n\nIn the end, however, he palliates the differences, leaving the\npossibility for some way to harmonize the two (1178a30). The\ndifferences between the two lives are rooted in the different aspects\nof the soul. Moral virtues belong to the appetites and desires of the\nsensory soul \u2013 the part obviously associated with the active\npolitical life, when its activities are brought under the guidance and\ncontrol of excellent practical thought and judgment. The\n\u201chighest\u201d virtues, those belonging to the scientific or\nphilosophical intellect, belong to theoretical reason. To concentrate\non these activities one must be appropriately disengaged from active\npolitical life. While the latter description leads Aristotle to\nportray as possible a kind of human life that partakes of divine\ndetachment (1178b5 ff), finally human life is an indissolvable\ncomposite of intellect, reason, sensation, desires, and appetites. For\nAristotle, strictly speaking, happiness simply is the\nexercise of the highest virtues, those of theoretical reason and\nunderstanding. But even persons pursuing those activities as their\nhighest good, and making them central to their lives, will need to\nremain connected to daily life, and even to political affairs in the\ncommunity in which they live. Hence, they will possess and exercise\nthe moral virtues and those of practical thought, as well as those\nother, higher, virtues, throughout their lives. Clearly, this\nconception of happiness does not hold all virtue, moral and\nintellectual, to be of equal value. Rather, Aristotle means the\nintellectual virtue of study and contemplation to be the dominant part\nof happiness. However, problems remains since we can understand\ndominance in two ways. In the first version, the activity of\ntheoretical contemplation is the sole, exclusive component of\nhappiness and the exercise of the moral virtues and practical wisdom\nis an instrumental means to happiness, but not integral to it. The\nproblem with this version of dominance is that it undermines what\nAristotle has said about the intrinsic value of the virtuous activity\nof politically and socially engaged human beings, including\nfriendship. In a second version of dominance, we might understand\ncontemplation to be the principal, but not exclusive, constituent of\nhappiness. The problem with this version of dominance lies in\nintegrating such apparently incompatible activities into a coherent\nlife. If we give the proper weight to the divine good of theoretical\ncontemplation it may leave us little interest in the virtuous pursuits\nof the moral goods arising from our political nature, except, again,\nas means for establishing and maintaining the conditions in which we\nmay contemplate.\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle is a eudaimonist in that he argues that virtue\n(including in some way the moral virtues of courage, justice and the\nrest) is the dominant and most important component of happiness.\nHowever, he is not claiming that the only reason to be morally\nvirtuous is that moral virtue is a constituent of happiness. He says\nthat we seek to have virtue and virtuous action for itself as well\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1097b 1\u201310); not to do so is to\nfail even to be virtuous. In this regard, it is like\npleasure, which is also a constituent of the happy life. Like\npleasure, virtue is sought for its own sake. Still, as a constituent\nof happiness, virtuous action is grounded in the highest end for a\nhuman being. One can discern in the Nicomachean Ethics two\ndifferent types of argument for the link between virtue and happiness.\nOne is based on Aristotle\u2019s account of human nature and\nculminates in the so-called function argument of Book I. If happiness\nis excellent or virtuous activity of the soul, the latter is\nunderstood by way of the uniquely human function. If one understands\nthe human function then one can understand what it is for that\nfunction to be done excellently (1098a5\u201315). This sort of\nargument has been criticized because it moves from a premise about\nwhat humans are to a conclusion about what they ought to be. Such\ncriticism reflects the modern claim that there is a fact-value\ndistinction. One defense of Aristotle\u2019s argument holds that his\naccount of human nature is meant both to be objective and to offer the\nbasis for an understanding of excellence. The difference, then,\nbetween modern moral theory and ancient is over what counts as an\nobjective account of human nature. However, even if we accept this\ndefense, we can still ask why a human would consider it good to\nachieve human excellence as it is defined in the function argument. At\nthis point another argument for the link between happiness and virtue\n\u2013 one more dispersed in the text of the Nicomachean\nEthics \u2013 becomes relevant; it is based on value terms only\nand appeals to what a human might consider it good to achieve.\nAristotle describes virtuous activity of the soul as fine\n(kalos) and excellent (spoudaios). Finally, the link\nbetween virtue and happiness is forged if a human sees that it is good\nto live a life that one considers to be fine and excellent.\n\n(For further detailed discussion, see entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s ethics.)\n\n",
