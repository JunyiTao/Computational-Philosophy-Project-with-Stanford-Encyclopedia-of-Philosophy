The Background to Descartes\u2019 Mathematical Researches\n\nWhen Descartes\u2019 mathematical researches commenced in the early\nseventeenth century, mathematicians were wrestling with questions\nconcerning the appropriate methods for geometrical proof and, in\nparticular, the criteria for identifying curves that met the exact and\nrigorous standards of geometry and that could thus be used in\ngeometrical problem-solving. These issues were given an added sense of\nurgency for practicing mathematicians when, in 1588,\nCommandino\u2019s Latin translation of Pappus\u2019s\nCollection (early fourth century CE) was published. In the\nCollection Pappus appeals to the ancient practice of geometry\nas he offers normative claims about how geometrical problems ought to\nbe solved. Early modern readers gave special attention to\nPappus\u2019s proposals concerning (1) how a mathematician should\nconstruct the curves used in geometrical proof, and (2) how a geometer\nshould apply the methods of analysis and synthesis in geometrical\nproblem-solving. The construction of curves will be treated in 1.1 and\nanalysis and synthesis in section 1.2 below.\n",
