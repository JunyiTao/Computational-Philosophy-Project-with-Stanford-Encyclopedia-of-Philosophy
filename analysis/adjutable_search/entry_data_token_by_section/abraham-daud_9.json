    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || Prophecy\n5.5 Prophecy\n\n\nProphecy is another important issue in Ibn Daud\u2019s thought, as it\nis the prophet who is the link between the heavenly world and man.  He\nis the person who\u2014thanks to his specific knowledge\u2014must\nguide man towards intellectual and moral perfection. Ibn Daud\u2019s\naccount of prophecy immediately follows his discussion of the\nintelligences, since it is the Active Intellect that plays a crucial\nrole in the explanation of prophecy. This account has a twofold aim:\nfirstly, to provide a rational explanation of the phenomenon of\nprophecy and, secondly, to defend the eternal validity of Mosaic Law\nagainst Christian and Muslim claims to the contrary. Ibn Daud is,\nhowever, not entirely consistent with regard to the first\nobjective. He begins his exposition by following the Muslim\nphilosophers in arguing that prophecy is a natural process that is\nrelated to dreams. Basing himself on his psychology, he explains how\nin certain circumstances someone can receive the overflow of the\nActive Intellect on his imaginative faculty and intellect by which he\nbecomes a prophet. This goal can be pursued by people with a pure soul\nthrough study and association with good people. It would thus seem\nthat anybody who meets certain requirements will automatically become\na prophet. However, in a manner reminiscent of Judah Halevi, Ibn Daud\nthen adds that the occurrence of this phenomenon is bound to certain\nconditions of place, time and nation. Clearly these stipulations are\nan attempt to safeguard the special character of biblical prophecy,\nbut at the same time they impinge on the universalistic character of\nhis psychological explanation of prophecy.\n\n\nThe defense of the eternal validity of Mosaic Law is directed\nagainst Christians, whose major claim was that the Law of Moses was\nreplaced by the New Testament, as well as against Muslims, who believed\nthat the Law received by Moses was falsified throughout the course of\ntime. We do not need review his polemics here or his use of Islamic\ntheological arguments that prove that Moses is the only prophet who meets\nthe requirements of classifying as a \u201ctrue prophet\u201d. What\nis of interest for our purpose is that Ibn Daud structures his\narguments in a syllogistic framework, so as to adapt this polemical\nchapter to the overall philosophical outlook of the rest of the\nwork.\n\n\nAs to the place of this chapter in Ibn Daud\u2019s book, Amira Eran\nhas suggested that the chapter on prophecy originally formed an\nindependent unit, which was later integrated into the ER\n(Eran 1998: 263ff.).\n",
