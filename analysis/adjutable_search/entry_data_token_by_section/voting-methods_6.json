This raises an important question: How should we\ncompare the different voting methods? Can we argue that some\nvoting methods are better than others? There are a number of different\ncriteria that can be used to compare and contrast different voting\nmethods: \n\nPragmatic concerns: Is the procedure easy to use?\nIs it legal to use a particular voting method for a national\nor local election? The importance of \u201cease of use\u201d should\nnot be underestimated: Despite its many flaws, plurality rule\n(arguably the simplest voting procedure to use and understand) is, by\nfar, the most commonly used method (cf. the discussion by Levin and\nNalebuff 1995, p. 19).   Furthermore, there are a variety \nof consideration that go into selecting an appropriate  voting \nmethod  for an institution (Edelman 2012a). \n \nBehavioral considerations: Do the different procedures\nreally lead to different outcomes in practice? An interesting\nstrand of research, behavorial social choice, incorporates\nempirical data about actual elections into the general theory of\nvoting (This is discussed briefly in Section 5. See Regenwetter et\nal. 2006, for an extensive discussion). \nInformation required from the voters: What type of\ninformation do the ballots convey? While ranking methods (e.g., Borda\nCount) require the voter to compare all of the candidates, it\nis often useful to ask the voters to report something about the\n\u201cintensities\u201d of their preferences over the candidates. Of\ncourse, there is a trade-off: Limiting what voters can express about\ntheir opinions of the candidates often makes a procedure much easier\nto use and understand.  Also related to these issues is the  work of \nBrennan and Lomasky 1993 (among others) on expressive voting \n(cf. Wodak 2019 and Aragones et al. 2011 for analyses along these lines  \ntouching on issues raised in this article).  \n\nAxiomatic characterization results and voting paradoxes:\nMuch of the work in voting theory has focused on comparing and\ncontrasting voting procedures in terms of abstract principles that\nthey satisfy. The goal is to characterize the different voting\nprocedures in terms of normative principles of group decision\nmaking. See Sections 3 and 4.2 for discussions.\n\n",
