    "main_text": "Sense-datum theories || Introduction\n2.1 Introduction\n\nStandard perception (exteroception) can be analyzed as involving the\nperception (act) of a public object. The perceptual act on the part of\nthe perceiving subject, in turn, is analyzed as involving an\nexperience which typically induces conceptual categorization, i.e.,\napplication of concepts to the object of perception and its qualities\n\u2014 not to the experience. Thus perceptual experiences seem\ntransparent to the perceiver, who may be said to perceive the\nextramental reality directly, without first perceiving or somehow\nbeing aware of the experience itself or its qualities. This view is\nsupported by common sense and is typically called naive or direct\nrealism.\n\nAccording to the indirect realists, this directness is an\nillusion; we are in fact directly aware of experiential\nintermediaries, and we perceive the extramental world only indirectly,\nin virtue of being directly aware of these intermediaries. Most early\nindirect realists (e.g., Moore 1903, 1939; Russell 1912; Price 1950)\nthought of these intermediaries as phenomenal or mental particulars,\ntypically called\n sense-data.\n Consider a hallucination of a red apple. Intuitively, the person\nhaving the hallucination seems to see something. This something is\nnot, of course, an apple. But it is an object, according to\nsense-datum theorists, which is shaped like an apple and is really\nred. It is a sense-datum, a phenomenal (mental) individual which\nreally has the qualities that it visually appears to have. Sense-data,\nhowever, are no ordinary objects: they are private, subjective,\nself-intimating, and the source of incorrigible knowledge. According\nto sense-datum theorists, sense-data are internal to one\u2019s\nconsciousness: they are not before one\u2019s sense-organs. These\ntheories claim that there is a hidden act-object structure in the\nperceptual awareness itself. Every perceptual awareness involves the\nact of being aware of phenomenal objects and their qualities that\nphenomenally determine this perceptual awareness, whether or not this\nawareness is a hallucination or a veridical perception of external\nobjects.\n\nOn sense-datum theories, one perceives external objects and their\nqualities indirectly by directly perceiving (being aware of, or\nacquainted with) sense-data internal to one\u2019s consciousness that\nresemble in various degrees the physical objects that cause them.\nAccording to sense-datum theorists, however, we are rarely, if ever,\naware of this indirection in ordinary (veridical) exteroception. It is\nonly critical philosophical reflection on features of perceptual\nawareness that reveals that the indirection must occur. The importance\nof pain and other (intransitive) bodily sensations lies in the fact\nthat the indirection seems to be easily revealed introspectively as is\nshown by our unwillingness to identify the pain we attribute to body\nparts with anything physical in those parts.\n\nWhatever advantages or disadvantages sense-datum theories might have\nwith respect to genuine perception (exteroception) and misperception\nin general, its attraction seems undeniable when it comes to its\ntreatment of pains and other \u201cintransitive\u201d bodily\nsensations like itches, tickles, tingles,\n etc.[4]\n According to many sense-datum theorists, pains are paradigm examples\nof phenomenal individuals, mental objects with phenomenal qualities\nwhose existence depends on their being sensed or felt, and thus are\nlogically private to their owners who feel them. This position\npresumably explains why we have the act-object duality or ambiguity in\npain talk that we discussed earlier: pains qua localizable objects\ncannot exist without the corresponding acts, i.e., without\nsomeone\u2019s acts of experiencing them (Broad\n 1959).[5]\n In other words, the concept of pain plausibly applies to both the\nobject part of the act-object pair and to the act of\nbeing directly aware of these objects.\n\nThe puzzle of locating pains in body parts can be treated in more than\none way within this framework. The most straightforward way is simply\nto take the phenomena at face value and say that pains as mental\nobjects or sense-data are literally located where they seem to be\nlocated in body parts or even in empty space where one\u2019s limb\nwould have been, say, before the amputation. That pains are mental\nparticulars and depend for their existence on being sensed apparently\ndoes not logically preclude their being capable of having, literally,\na spatial location (see Jackson 1976, 1977 for this\n line).[6]\n\nA second and more popular way of handling the location problem is to\nsay that even though pains cannot literally be located in\nphysical space, they can have location in a\nphenomenal space or field that is somehow isomorphic or\nsystematically related to their counterparts (say, tissue damage) in\nphysical space. In fact, this move would also work for visual\nsense-data that require some spatiotemporal framework. In the case of\nbodily sensations, this phenomenal space is sometimes called\none\u2019s somatic field by analogy to a visual field that maps onto\nphysical space (Price\n 1950).[7]\n",
