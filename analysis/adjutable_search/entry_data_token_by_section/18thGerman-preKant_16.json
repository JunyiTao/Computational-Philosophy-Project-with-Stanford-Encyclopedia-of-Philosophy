    "main_text": "Women and Other Under-Represented Thinkers || Women and the Leibnizian-Wolffian Philosophy\n6.3 Anton Wilhelm Amo\n\nA final figure worthy of mention in this context is Anton Wilhelm Amo,\nthe first African-born professor of philosophy in Germany. Amo was\nborn in Axim in present-day Ghana around 1700, but was brought to the\nNetherlands as a small boy in 1707 through the Dutch West India\nCompany. Shortly after, he was given to the young Anton Ulrich, Duke\nof Wolfenb\u00fcttel-Braunschweig, and baptized on 29 July 1708. Amo\nevidently worked as a servant in the Duke\u2019s court in\nWolffenb\u00fcttel, though he would also receive an education which\nprepared him sufficiently for study at the Friedrichs-Universit\u00e4t\nin Halle, where he matriculated on 9 June 1727. There, Amo studied\nphilosophy and law, and it is reported that he presented a (now lost)\ndisputation in November 1729 entitled De jure maurorum in\nEuropa (On the Rights of Moors in Europe), in which he\ncontended (according to a contemporary account) against the legality\nof slavery in the Holy Roman Empire given that the privileges granted\nto African kings by the (old) Roman Emperor meant that they were\nvassals of the Empire, and entitled to consideration under the\nlaw.\n\nAmo matriculated at the university in nearby Wittenberg the following\nyear, and was promptly awarded a Magister in philosophy.\nWhile in Wittenberg, Amo wrote a dissertation, entitled De humanae\nmentis apatheia (On the Impassivity of the Human Mind)\nin 1734, which qualified him to teach, and later in the same year he\nsupervised a dissertation which he is also thought to have had a hand\n(at least) in writing (Menn & Smith 2020: 68\u201371). Amo would\nreturn to teach philosophy at Halle, and in 1738 published a\nwide-ranging manual for his philosophical lectures, Tractatus de\narte sobrie et accurate philosophandi (Treatise on the Art of\nPhilosophizing Soberly and Accurately). Not long after, however,\nAmo applied for a position at the University of Jena, claiming\nindigence, and was granted permission to lecture there in 1740. For\nreasons that we can only speculate about, Amo would request passage on\na ship to return to Africa in 1746 (Menn & Smith 2020: 38), and it\nwas in Axim that a Swiss doctor would report encountering Amo in the\nearly 1750s. Amo is thought to have died not long after.\n\nIn his principal philosophical work, the dissertation on\nImpassivity, he argues against the claim that the soul can be\nendowed with a passive faculty of sensation, a position he identifies\nas stemming from Descartes (Amo 1734a: 13\u201314 [2020: 179]). Amo\nunderstands the human mind to be a species of spirit, which is purely\nactive and immaterial. Were the mind to be endowed with a capacity to\nsense, it would have to be able to receive ideas, and in one of three\nways: by \u201ccommunication\u201d (i.e., in the manner that fire\n\u201ccommunicates\u201d its heat to an object), by penetration\n(i.e., through interposition of another entity), or by direct contact\n(Amo 1734a: 5 [2020: 161]). Amo argues that it is impossible to\nconceive of the mind receiving ideas in any of these ways as it would\nviolate its essence as a spontaneous being and its immaterial nature\nprecludes transmission through contact (for discussion, see Walsh\n2019). Perplexingly, in spite of contending for the soul\u2019s\nimpassivity, Amo endorses the Aristotelian dictum that \u201cnothing\nis in the intellect that was not first in the senses\u201d (Amo\n1734b: 6). Amo also affirms the mind\u2019s capacity to influence the\nbody (Amo 1734a: 8 [2020: 169]), though without accounting for how he\ntakes this to be possible or explicitly engaging with the debate\nrelating to the pre-established harmony. Nonetheless, in his lifetime\nAmo was identified by at least one influential historian as a Wolffian\nthinker (Ludovici 1738: \u00a7202).\n",
