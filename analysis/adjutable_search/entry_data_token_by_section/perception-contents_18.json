    "main_text": "Content and Phenomenology\n7. Content and Phenomenology\n\nAs the term \u2018experiences\u2019 is used here, it is definitional\nof experiences that they have a phenomenal character. If they have\ncontents as well, then a question arises as to how these two features\nare related. It is useful to contrast different views on the relation\nbetween the content of an experience and its phenomenology by\nconsidering phenomenally indistinguishable experiences, or\nexperiences with the \u2018same phenomenology\u2019, on the one\nhand; and experiences with the same content, on the other. A\npreliminary remark about this notion is in order.\n\nThe notion of phenomenal indistinguishability of unrepeatable\nexperiences cannot be defined as a statistical notion. Exactly how it\nshould be defined is a matter of controversy. Gottlob Frege and Moritz\nSchlick raised doubts about the coherence of the notion of\ninterpersonal phenomenal indistinguishability, (these\n\u2018Frege-Schlick\u2019 doubts are discussed by Stalnaker 2000,\nShoemaker 1981 and 1996) In addition, though phenomenal\nindistinguishability is commonly taken to be a sort of\nphenomenal sameness, some philosophers use the expression to\npick out a merely epistemic notion, involving experiences that\nsubjects cannot distinguish (for discussion, see T. Williamson (1990),\nMartin (2004), Siegel (2004), and entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.)\n Martin and Williamson regard it as a substantive claim that\nexperiences said to be \u2018phenomenally the same\u2019 have\nanything more than an epistemic property of indistinguishability in\ncommon.\n\nThere are several relations in which the content of an experience has\nbeen thought to stand to its phenomenology. One position holds that\ncontent suffices for phenomenology. A stronger position holds that the\ncontent of experience is identical with its phenomenology. A third\nposition is that the phenomenology of an experience determines its\ncontent. These positions and others are discussed below.\n",
