    "main_text": "(Putative) Counterexamples\n5. (Putative) Counterexamples\n\nA number of authors have proposed counterexamples to the Common Cause\nPrinciple. A counterexample would involve two events A and\nB such that\n\n\n\nA and B are probabilistically correlated,\n\n\nneither event is a cause of the other, and\n\n\nthe correlation between A and B cannot be explained by a\ncommon cause, either because they have no common cause, or because\ntheir common cause does not screen them off from one another.\n\n\nOne type of case that is often said to violate the Common Cause\nPrinciple involves entangled states in quantum mechanics, such as\nthose found in Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) thought experiment. We\nwill discuss this case in detail in\n Section 10\n below. The present section will consider several other examples. As\nwe shall see, these examples typically raise questions about the\nproper scope and interpretation of the Common Cause Principle, rather\nthan refuting the principle outright.\n\n\nExample 5. Cartwright\u2019s factory.\n\nCartwright (1999: 108\u2013109) asks us to imagine a factory that\nproduces a chemical, C, that is used in sewage treatment. The\nfactory employs a genuinely indeterministic process, so that when the\nprocess is initiated, I, there is a probability of .8 that the\nchemical is produced. However, whenever the chemical is produced, the\nfactory also releases a pollutant, P as a by-product. Thus\n\n\\[.8 = p(C \\cap P|I) > p(C|I)p(P|I) = .64\\]\n\n\nNeither C nor P cause the other.\n\n\nGlymour (1999) objects that such a factory is nowhere to be found.\nThis raises a question about the status of the Common Cause Principle.\nIf the principle is intended to be a conceptual truth about the\nrelationship between causation and probability, then we could\nundermine the principle by showing that a causal structure that\nviolates it can be clearly conceived. On the other hand, if the\nprinciple is intended to be an empirical generalization about the\nrelationship between causation and probability in the actual world,\nthen Glymour is right to demand more than a hypothetical example.\n\n\nExample 6. Random darts.\n\nSuppose that darts are shot at a dart board using an indeterministic\nprocess that can hit any part of the board. (If the reader is not\ncomfortable with indeterministic darts, she may imagine photons\nhitting a scintillation screen after passing through a narrow slit.)\nSuppose that A and B\nare two regions of the dart board such that\nA is fully contained within B,\nand B does\nnot fill the entire board (see\n Figure 5(a)).\n Let A be the event corresponding to the dart landing in region\nA, and analogously for B. Then\nwe will have: \n\n\\[p(A \\cap B) = p(A) > p(A)p(B).\\]\n\n\nThis follows because \\(A \\cap B = A\\) and \\(p(B) < 1\\). While the\nthrow of the dart (or whatever process launches the dart) is a common\ncause of A and B, this will not screen them off. And if\nthe process is genuinely indeterministic, there will be no cause that\nscreens them off.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The large circle represents\nthe dart board. Circles A and B\nare regions of the dartboard. In (a) the\nregion A is entirely contained in the\nregion B. In (b) the regions almost\n(but not quite) completely overlap. \n\n\nDavid Lewis famously tried to analyze causation in terms of\ncounterfactuals (Lewis 1973). He recognized that in order for his\ntheory to succeed, he needed to restrict the analysis to\ncounterfactual relations among distinct events (see\nespecially Lewis 1986). For instance, we typed the word \u201cLewis\u201d\nnear the beginning of this paragraph. If we had not typed the letters\nL-e-w, then we would not have typed the word \u201cLewis\u201d. But typing\nthe letters L-e-w did not cause us to type \u201cLewis\u201d.\nTyping L-e-w was part of the act of typing \u201cLewis\u201d. The\nevents typing L-e-w and typing \u201cLewis\u201d are not\ndistinct from one another in the right kind of way to stand\nin causal relations to each other. Lewis\u2019s account of\ndistinctness is somewhat involved, but it specifically excludes\nrelations of logical entailment and spatiotemporal inclusion.\n\nIt appears that the Common Cause Principle requires a similar\nrestriction to distinct events. In our example of the dart board, the\nregion A is spatially included within\nthe region B; hence, the events\nA and B will not be distinct, in Lewis\u2019s sense.\nThis means that there may be correlations between these events that\nare entirely due to their spatiotemporal relationship, and don\u2019t\nhave any distinctively causal basis.\n\nNow suppose that the regions A and\nB almost completely overlap, but\nneither is contained within the other (see\n Figure 5(b)).\n Again, the corresponding events A and B will be\ncorrelated, and the earlier common cause may not screen them off.\n(Arntzenius (1999 [2010: section 2.4]) has an example that has\nessentially this structure.) It seems that this case, too, is one in\nwhich the events A and B are insufficiently distinct.\nBut now it becomes difficult to formulate a notion of distinctness\nthat is sufficiently general, without ruling out too much. To see the\nproblem, imagine that instead of a literal dartboard, we have a Venn\ndiagram representing the possible states of a system that evolves\nindeterministically. The spatial regions A\nand B now\nrepresent sets of possible states, corresponding to the states in\nwhich events A and B occur. And the area corresponds to\nprobability. Thus the set of states in which A occurs almost\ncompletely overlaps with the set of states in which B occurs,\nas measured by the probability distribution over states. Is this a\nreason to think that A and B are not distinct? It had\nbetter not be, because this is just a representation of the generic\ncase where events A and B are probabilistically\ncorrelated. Thus spelling out the precise notion of\ndistinctness at work remains a challenge.\n\n\nExample 7. Conserved quantities.\n\nSalmon (1984) and Schurz (2017) argue that systems governed by\nprobabilistic dynamics together with conservation laws will give rise\nto violations of RCCP. Suppose that a brick weighing 2 kg falls onto a\nhard, peaked surface. The brick cracks and breaks into two pieces,\nA and B.\nSuppose that this process is genuinely chancy. Perhaps the precise\npoint at which the brick strikes the surface, or the precise process\nof crack formation in the brick, is not determined by earlier states\nof the system. Let A be the event corresponding to piece A\nweighing some specific amount, say 1.2 kg,\nand let B be the event corresponding to piece B\nweighing the complementary amount, say 0.8\nkg. Since the combined mass must be 2 kg, A will occur if and\nonly if B occurs. Since the process is chancy, \\(p(A) = p(B) =\nr < 1\\). However,  \n\n\\[p(A \\cap B) = r > r^2 = p(A)p(B),\\]\n\n\nso A and B are correlated. No earlier event can screen\noff this correlation unless it determines that A and B\nwill occur. Since the process is genuinely chancy, there is no such\nevent. Hence RCCP is violated.\n\nWhether there are any actual violations of RCCP having this form\ndepends on whether there are actual processes governed by\nprobabilistic dynamics and conservation laws. We don\u2019t find such\nprocesses described by classical physics. We do encounter this\ncombination already in quantum mechanics, at least on some\ninterpretations (so-called collapse interpretations). However, these\ncases are further complicated by the role of quantum\nentanglement. We discuss the status of the Common Cause\nPrinciple in quantum mechanics in greater detail in sections 9 and 10\nbelow.\n\n\n\nExample 8. Time series.\n\nSober (2001) notes that sea levels in Venice and bread prices in\nLondon have both been rising over the past few centuries. Let V\nrepresent Venetian sea levels higher than some specified level, and\nL London bread prices higher than a given mark. If we sample\nVenetian sea levels and London bread prices over time, we will find\nthat V and L are correlated: In years where V\nobtains, L tends to obtain as well (since these will tend to be\nmore recent years). However, we have no reason to think that these\nphenomena share a common cause. They appear to be causally\nindependent.\n\n\nTo understand what is going on in this example, we need to look more\nclosely at the relationship between sample statistics and underlying\nprobability distributions. We frequently think about this in terms of\na classic urn model. An urn contains a certain proportion of black and\nwhite balls. We draw balls from the urn, and use the frequency of\nblack balls drawn to estimate the proportion of black balls in the\nurn. Using statistical frequencies to estimate probabilities in this\nway typically requires an assumption that the samples are\nprobabilistically independent: drawing a black ball does not affect\nthe probability that the next ball drawn will be black. Sober\u2019s\nexample involves what statisticians call a time series. When\nwe sample Venetian sea levels over the course of years, we are not\ndrawing probabilistically independent samples from a stable\nprobability distribution. If the sea level is high in a particular\nyear, we can predict that the sea level will be similarly high the\nfollowing year (they tend not to change dramatically from one year to\nthe next). For this reason, we cannot interpret the relative\nfrequencies that we obtain as estimates of an underlying probability\ndistribution. Thus, even though there is a correlation between\nV and L in our samples, it is impossible to interpret\nthis as a probabilistic correlation with  \\(p(V \\cap L) > p(V)p(L)\\). Not all correlations in\nstatistical samples bespeak probabilistic correlations. (See\nalso Hoover 2003 and Steel 2003 for further discussion of\nSober\u2019s example.)\n\nThis defense of the Common Cause Principle raises a worry, however.\nMany cases where we would like to apply the Common Cause Principle may\nalso turn out to behave like time series. For example, consider\nReichenbach\u2019s example of the traveling theatre troupe\n (Example 2\n above). It is reasonable to expect that if the leading man is sick on\na particular day, then he will be more likely to be sick on the\nfollowing day\u2014some illnesses last more than a day. And if he is\nexposed to a particular pathogen at one time, he may gain immunity\nagainst that pathogen in the future. If we exclude all such examples,\nthen we run the risk of excluding many of the standard examples that\nare supposed to lend support to the principle.\n",
