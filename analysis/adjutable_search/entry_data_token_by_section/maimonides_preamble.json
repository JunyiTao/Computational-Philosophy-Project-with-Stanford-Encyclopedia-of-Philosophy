    "main_text": "\n\n\nMoses ben Maimon [known to English speaking audiences as Maimonides\nand Hebrew speaking as Rambam] (1138\u20131204) is the greatest Jewish\nphilosopher of the medieval period and is still widely read today. The\nMishneh Torah, his 14-volume compendium of Jewish law,\nestablished him as the leading rabbinic authority of his time and quite\npossibly of all time. His philosophic masterpiece, the Guide of the\nPerplexed, is a sustained treatment of Jewish thought and practice\nthat seeks to resolve the conflict between religious knowledge and\nsecular. Although heavily influenced by the Neo-Platonized\nAristotelianism that had taken root in Islamic circles, it departs from\nprevailing modes of Aristotelian thought by emphasizing the limits of\nhuman knowledge and the questionable foundations of significant parts\nof astronomy and metaphysics. Maimonides also achieved fame as a\nphysician and wrote medical treatises on a number of diseases and their\ncures. Succeeding generations of philosophers wrote extensive\ncommentaries on his works, which influenced thinkers as diverse as\nAquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Newton.\n",
