    "main_text": "The Solutions Based on the Rejection of the Necessity of the Past || Relativist Theory\n6. Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, Lavenham\u2019s medieval attempt at systematising\nthe various possible responses to the problem of future contingents\ngives rise to a classification. This classification is based on the\nobservation that in order to reject the logical argument for\ndeterminism we have to reject at least one of the principles, (P3)\n(necessity of the past) and (P5) (the principle of future excluded\nmiddle). It is also clear from Lavenham\u2019s analysis that he\nwanted to focus on the question whether future contingents have\ndeterminate truth-values. When formulated in terms of the modern\ndebate, the question is whether future contingents have\nbranch-independent truth-values. Or using Belnap\u2019s vocabulary:\nIs there settled truth about future contingents? Using the reactions\non the classical argument mentioned in section 2 and the views on\ntruth-values of future contingents as two classification principles,\nwe may group the solutions considered in the following diagram:\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome future contingents are neither true nor false\nAll future contingents are either true or\nfalse\n\nRejection of the principle of the necessity of the past\n(P3)\n Priorean Ockhamism\n\n(Nuel Belnap)\n\n\nSupervaluationism\n\n(Richmond Thomason)\n\n\nRelativism\n\n(John MacFarlane) \n Leibnizianism\n\n(Davis Lewis, Alberto Zanardo)\n\n\nTrue Futurism\n\n(classical Ockhamism, Molinism)  \n\nRejection of the principle of future excluded middle\n(P5)\nThree valued logic\n\n(Jan \u0141ukasiewicz) \nPriorean Peirceanism\n\n(A.N. Prior) \n\n\nThe classification of Belnap\u2019s view in the above diagram is\nbased on the assumption that his \u201csettled true\u201d refers to\n\u201ctrue\u201d as it is used in the present context.\n\nRegarding the classification represented in the diagram it should be\nnoted that from a logical point of view the two rows are not mutually\nexclusive. However, although it would in principle be possible to\nreject both (P3) and (P5), we do not know any important theory of that\nkind.\n\nIt should also be noted that the theories in the first row all\nformally make use of the Ockhamist recursive semantics, although they\ndiffer in how or whether truth at a moment of time is defined in terms\nof \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)\\).\n\nAs we have seen, there are ongoing philosophical debates regarding\nfuture contingents. There is still a focus on the questions\nrepresented in the diagram, but other problems are also discussed. One\nproblem which has attracted much attention is the study of future\ncontingents as seen in relation to branching space-time and various\nideas within physics. Here Belnap (1992, 2003, 2005), M\u00fcller\n(2007, M\u00fcller et al. 2008), and Placek (2000) have\ncontributed significantly.\n",
