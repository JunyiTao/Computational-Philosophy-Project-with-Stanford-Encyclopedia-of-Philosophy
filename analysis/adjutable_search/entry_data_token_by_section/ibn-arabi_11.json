    "main_text": "Things and Realities || Fixed Entities\n4.1 Fixed Entities\n\nMost famously, Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee discusses the things known to\nGod as \u201cfixed entities\u201d (a\u2018y\u00e2n\nth\u00e2bita). Early translators opted for expressions like\nimmutable or permanent \u201carchetypes\u201d or\n\u201cessences\u201d, without noting that there is no difference in\nwhatness between \u201cfixed entities\u201d and \u201cexistent\nentities\u201d (a\u2018y\u00e2n mawj\u00fbda). The fixed\nentities are the things inasmuch as they are nonexistent in themselves\nbut known to God; the existent entities are the exact same things\ninasmuch as they have been given a certain imaginal or delimited\nexistence by the engendering command. The fixed entities are not the\n\u201carchetypes\u201d of the existent entities but are rather\nidentical (\u2018ayn) with them; nor are they\n\u201cessences\u201d, if by this is meant anything other than the\nentities\u2019 specific whatness.\n\nBy having recourse to the fixity of entities in the divine knowledge,\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee is able to say that the dispute between\ntheologians and philosophers over the eternity of the world goes back\nto their perception of the entities. Those who maintain that the world\nis eternal have understood that \u201cthe Real is never qualified by\nfirst not seeing the cosmos, then seeing it. On the contrary, He never\nceases seeing it.\u201d Those who maintain that the world is\nqualified by new arrival (hud\u00fbth) \u201cconsider the\nexistence of the cosmos in relation to its own entity\u201d, which is\nnonexistent. Hence they understand that it must have come into\nexistence (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t,\n1911 edition, 2:666.35).\n\nFollowers of Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee sometimes distinguished between\ndivine names and entities by calling the former \u201cuniversal\nnames\u201d and the latter \u201cparticular names\u201d. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee observes theological norms when he declares that\nthe divine names are \u201cconditional\u201d\n(tawq\u00eef\u00ee), which is to say that we should call\nGod only by those names that he himself uses in scripture. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee also acknowledges, however, that every single thing\nis a divine name, because each designates the Nondelimited in respect\nof a certain delimitation. In this sense, each thing, each entity, is\na \u201cspecific face\u201d (wajh kh\u00e2ss) of God that\ndifferentiates it from every other thing. After quoting the prophetic\nsaying that God has \u201cninety-nine\u201d names, Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee explains that these names designate the\n\u201cmothers\u201d of the names, which give birth to all the rest.\nHe continues:\n\nEvery one of the possible entities has a specific divine name that\ngazes upon it and gives it its specific face, thereby distinguishing\nit from every other entity. The possible things are infinite, so the\nnames are infinite, for new relations arrive with the new arrival of\nthe possible things. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 4:288.1)\n\n",
