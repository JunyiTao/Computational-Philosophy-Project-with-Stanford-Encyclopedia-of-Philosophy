    "main_text": "Inertial frames in the 20th century: special and general relativity || Simultaneity and reference-frames\n2.4 Simultaneity and reference-frames\n\nThe details of Einstein\u2019s argument and the structure of\nMinkowski space-time can be found elsewhere (see, e.g., Einstein 1951\nand Geroch 1978). Here only one more point is worth making. It could\nbe argued that Einstein\u2019s and Lorentz\u2019s view are\ncompletely equivalent. That is, we could assume that there is indeed a\nprivileged frame of reference, and that the apparent invariance of the\nvelocity of light is explained by the effects on bodies of their\nmotion through the ether (the Lorentz contraction and time dilation).\nThis purported distinction between empirically indistinguishable\nframes has often been criticized on straightforward methodological\ngrounds, but it could be (and surely has been) argued that it is more\nintuitively plausible than the relativity of simultaneity. After all,\nknowing that (as Einstein showed) the Lorentz contraction can be\nderived from the invariance of the velocity of light does not, by\nitself, entitle us to say which of the two is the more convincing\nstarting-point.\n\nThis is why it is so important that Einstein\u2019s 1905 paper begins\nwith a critical analysis of the entire notion of a frame of reference.\nIt is tacitly assumed by Lorentz\u2019s theory, and classical\nelectrodynamics generally, that we have a reference-frame in which we\ncan measure the velocity of light, and that there is a distinguished\nframe\u2014at rest with respect to the ether\u2014in which its true\nvelocity would be measured. But how is such a reference-frame\ndetermined? The distances between points in space can only be\ndetermined if it is possible to determine which events are\nsimultaneous. In practice this is always done by light-signalling, if\nonly in the informal sense that we identify simultaneous events when\nwe see them at the same time. But if the spatial frame of reference is\ndetermined by light-signals, and is then to be used to measure the\nspeed of light, we would appear to be going in a circle. For this\nreason, Poincar\u00e9 concluded that determining the speed of light\nis partly a matter of convention (1898). Before Einstein, however, it\nwas tacitly assumed that, while light-signalling is useful and\npractical, it is not essential to the definition of simultaneity.\nThere would be, therefore, a fact of the matter about which events are\nsimultaneous that is independent of this method of signalling. This\nassumption was actually made explicit by James Thomson. He\nrecognized\u2014as few did before Poincar\u00e9 and\nEinstein\u2014that the measurement of distance involves\n\nthe difficulty as to imperfection of our means of ascertaining or\nspecifying, or clearly idealizing, simultaneity at distant places. For\nthis we do commonly use signals by sound, by light, by electricity, by\nconnecting wires or bars, and by various other means. The time\nrequired in the transmission of the signal involves an imperfection in\nhuman powers of ascertaining simultaneity of occurrences at distant\nplaces. It seems, however, probably not to involve any difficulty of\nidealizing or imagining the existence of simultaneity. Probably it may\nnot be felt to involve any difficulty comparable to that of attempting\nto form a distinct notion of identity of place at successive times in\nunmarked space. (1884, p. 380).\n\n\nIn other words, Thomson assumed that it was not a difficulty in\nprinciple, like the difficulty of determining rest in absolute space.\nBut Einstein showed that it was precisely the same kind of difficulty:\ndeterminations of simultaneity involve reference to an arbitrary\nchoice of reference-frame, just as much as determinations of velocity.\nEinstein\u2019s conclusion is, of course, entirely contingent on the\nempirical facts of electrodynamics. It could have been avoided if\nthere were in nature a useful signal of some kind whose transmission\nwould provide a criterion of absolute simultaneity, so that the same\nevents would be determined to be simultaneous in all inertial frames.\nOr, experiments such as those of Michelson and Morley might have\nsucceeded in exhibiting the dependence of the velocity of light on the\nstate of motion of the source. Then synchronization by light-signals\ncould still have been regarded as a mere practical substitute for a\nnotion of absolute simultaneity that stood on independent grounds,\nempirically as well as conceptually. But as Einstein saw, because of\nthe apparent independence of the velocity of light of the motion of\nthe source, even \u201cidealizing or imagining the existence of\nsimultaneity\u201d involves light-signalling more essentially than\nanyone could have realized. Unless some other criterion of\nsimultaneity is provided, therefore, the establishment of a spatial\nframe of reference involves light-signalling in an essential way. In\nthe absence of such a criterion the speed of light cannot be, as\nLorentz supposed, empirically measured against the background of an\ninertial frame. By appealing to the speed of light in defining\nsimultaneity, Einstein gave an empirically sound construction both for\nspatio-temporal measurement and for a dynamically distinct class of\nreference-frames.
