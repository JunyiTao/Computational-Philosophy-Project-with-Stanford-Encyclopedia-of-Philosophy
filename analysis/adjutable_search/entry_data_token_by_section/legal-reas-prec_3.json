    "main_text": "Precedent || Precedents as the application of underlying principles\n2.2 Precedents as the application of underlying principles\n\n\nA different response to the problem of distinguishing is to relocate\nthe binding force of precedents in the justification for the\nearlier decision, rather than in the ruling itself. (See Perry 1987,\nesp. 234ff and Moore 1987 for two versions of this view.)  This\napproach has three principal attractions. The first is that it\nexplains the lengthy expositions of the reasoning for the\nresult found in many decisions. It is the reasons that contain the\ngist of the decision, and so it is to this question that most\nattention is directed by the courts in justifying their\ndecisions. Secondly, this accounts for the fact that courts do not\nbother (and indeed lack the power) to lay down a precise formulation\nof their rationes. The ratio does not lay down a\nrule which must be followed by later courts, but is simply a\nconvenient short-hand way of referring to the overall effect of the\nprinciples justifying the result in the case (Perry 1987, 235,\n239). Thirdly, and most significantly, this approach provides a\nnatural explanation for the practice of distinguishing. A later case\nis distinguishable where the justification for the result in\nthe precedent does not apply to the different facts of that case, even\nif it might seem to fall within the ratio of the\ndecision.\n\n\nDespite its attractions, the \u2018underlying principles\u2019\naccount faces three major difficulties: (i) the scope of\ndistinguishing; (ii) accounting for the role played by\nrationes; and (iii) maintaining the distinction between\nprecedent and analogy. The initial difficulty arises from the fact\nthat distinguishing is not restricted to the application of the\njustification provided by the earlier decision. Any good argument can\nprovide the basis for distinguishing, for example by showing that the\nnovel facts in the later case provide considerations which\noutweigh the original justification: it is not that the\noriginal justification is inapplicable to the novel facts, it is\nsimply that those facts raise additional considerations that are more\ncompelling. So later courts go beyond what was done in the earlier\ndecision in determining whether to distinguish the later case.\n\n\nOne possible line of response to these difficulties is to abandon the\nidea that what is binding is the precedent court's\njustification for its decision. After all, the standard view is that\nlater courts are bound by the ruling in the precedent, not its\nreasoning. Instead, it is argued, whether the earlier decision must be\nfollowed in the later case turns on applying the best\njustification for the earlier decision. But not the best\njustification for that decision, taken in isolation. Rather, what is\nbinding in law is the set of principles which best fit and justify the\ntotality of the results in past decisions (e.g. Moore 1987, 201, 210;\ncf. Dworkin 1975,\n 110\u201323[10]).\n From this perspective, distinguishing is not restricted to applying\nthe earlier court's justification for its decision, but in\napplying the justifications for the doctrine of which that decision\nforms a\n part.[11]\n\n\nThe second difficulty, however, applies to both versions of this\napproach, viz. accounting for the role played by\nrationes. The practice of precedent involves later\ncourts being bound to either follow or distinguish\nthe earlier decision, but only if the facts of the later case\nfall within the terms of the ratio. The ratio\nplays an indispensable role in fixing the scope of the later\ncourt's duty to follow or distinguish\u2014it is only if the\nfacts of the later case fall within the ratio that this\nquestion arises. This role is not appropriately captured by\narguing that it is the justifications, and not the ratio,\nwhich are\n binding.[12] \n (Cf. Moore 1987, 185\u20137, 211\u20133). What the approach does\nhelp to highlight, on the other hand, is the role played in the\npractice of precedent by the justification for decisions. As noted\nabove, determining the ratio is not a mechanical exercise: it\ninvolves understanding what was decided in a case\u2014by reference\nto what was said in the judgment, earlier cases, and the general\nunderstanding of that area of the law. The precedent\ncourt's own justification for its decision plays an\nimportant role in determining the level of abstraction of the factors\nin the ratio, and for providing arguments for a narrower or\nwider reading of those\n factors.[13]\n\n\nThis is related to another point: if the underlying justification\nfor a precedent is binding then it undermines the distinction between\narguments from precedent and those by analogy. The ratio\nof the precedent sets the outer limit of what is binding on\nlater courts\u2014i.e., what a later court is bound to either follow or\ndistinguish. Analogies (as will be argued below) are\ngrounded in the underlying rationale for earlier decisions, but they do\nnot bind later courts. If the underlying justification\nof precedents were binding, rather than the ratio, then\nanalogies would be binding and legal reasoning would have a different\nshape.\n",
