    "main_text": "Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus || Criticism of Existentialists\n3.3 Criticism of Existentialists\n\nIn his statement of the problem and its solution, Camus\u2019s tone,\nideas, and style are reminiscent of Nietzsche. \u201cGod is\ndead\u201d is of course their common starting point, as is the\ndetermination to confront unpleasant truths and write against received\nwisdom. At the same time Camus argues against the specific\nphilosophical current with which Nietzsche is often linked as a\nprecursor, and to which he himself is closest\u2014existentialism.\nThe Myth of Sisyphus is explicitly written against\nexistentialists such as Shestov, Kierkegaard, Jaspers, and Heidegger,\nas well as against the phenomenology of Husserl. Camus shares their\nstarting point, which he regards as the fact that they all somehow\ntestify to the absurdity of the human condition. But he rejects what\nhe sees as their ultimate escapism and irrationality, claiming that\n\u201cthey deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what\nimpoverishes them. That forced hope is religious in all of them\u201d\n(MS, 24).\n\nSartre, too, is subject to Camus\u2019s criticisms\u2014and not just\npolitically as will be described in the following section. Although\nsome of the ideas in The Myth of Sisyphus drew on\nSartre\u2019s Nausea (as noted above), in 1942 Sartre was\nnot yet regarded as an \u201cexistentialist\u201d. But as\nSartre\u2019s philosophy developed, he went on to explore how human\nactivity constitutes a meaningful world from the brute, meaningless\nexistence unveiled in his\n novel[2]\n (Aronson 1980, 71\u201388). In the process, the absurdity of\nNausea becomes the contingency of Being and\nNothingness, the fact that humans and things are simply there\nwith no explanation or reason. As Sartre described it, the absurd is\n\u201cthe universal contingency of being which is, but which is not\nthe basis of its being; the absurd is the given, the unjustifiable,\nprimordial quality of existence\u201d (quoted in Sagi 2002, 57).\nHaving rooted human existence in such contingency, Sartre goes on to\ndescribe other fundamental structures of existence, core human\nprojects, and characteristic patterns of behavior, including freedom\nand bad faith, all of which arise on this basis. The original\ncontingency leads to our desire to undo it, to the futile project to\n\u201cfound being,\u201d in other words the \u201cuseless\npassion\u201d of the project to become God.\n\nFor Sartre absurdity is obviously a fundamental ontological property\nof existence itself, frustrating us but not restricting our\nunderstanding. For Camus, on the other hand, absurdity is not a\nproperty of existence as such, but is an essential feature of our\nrelationship with the world. It might be argued that Sartre\nand Camus are really quite similar, and that the core futility of\nSartre\u2019s philosophy parallels the \u201cdespair\u201d Camus\ndescribes. After all, if Sisyphus\u2019s labor is ultimately futile,\nso is the project to become God. But Sartre rejects the\n\u201cclassical pessimism\u201d and \u201cdisillusionment\u201d he\nfinds in Camus and instead possesses an unCamusean confidence in his\nability to understand and explain this project and the rest of the\nhuman world. Camus, on the contrary, builds an entire worldview on his\ncentral assumption that absurdity is an unsurpassable relationship\nbetween humans and their world (Aronson 2013). He postulates an\ninevitable divorce between human consciousness, with its \u201cwild\nlonging for clarity\u201d (MS, 21) and the\n\u201cunreasonable silence of the world\u201d (MS, 28). As\ndiscussed above, Camus views the world as irrational, which means that\nit is not understandable through reason.\n\nAccording to Camus, each existentialist writer betrayed his initial\ninsight by seeking to appeal to something beyond the limits of the\nhuman condition, by turning to the transcendent. And yet even if we\navoid what Camus describes as such escapist efforts and continue to\nlive without irrational appeals, the desire to do so is built into our\nconsciousness and thus our humanity. We are unable to free ourselves\nfrom \u201cthis desire for unity, this longing to solve, this need\nfor clarity and cohesion\u201d (MS, 51). But it is urgent to\nnot succumb to these impulses and to instead accept absurdity. In\ncontrast with existentialism, \u201cThe absurd is lucid reason noting\nits limits\u201d (MS, 49).\n\nCamus clearly believes that the existentialist philosophers are\nmistaken but does not argue against them, because he believes that\n\u201cthere is no truth but merely truths\u201d (MS, 43).\nHis disagreement rather takes the subtler and less assertive form of\nan immanent critique, pointing out that each thinker\u2019s\nexistentialist philosophy ends up being inconsistent with its own\nstarting point: \u201cstarting from a philosophy of the world\u2019s\nlack of meaning, it ends up by finding a meaning and depth in\nit\u201d (MS, 42). These philosophers, he insists, refuse to\naccept the conclusions that follow from their own premises.\nKierkegaard, for example, strongly senses the absurd. But rather than\nrespecting it as the inevitable human ailment, he seeks to be cured of\nit by making it an attribute of a God who he then embraces.\n\nCamus\u2019s most sustained analysis is of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology. Along with Sartre, Camus praises the early Husserlian\nnotion of intentionality. Sartre saw this notion as revealing a\ndynamic consciousness without contents\u2014the basis for his\nconception of freedom\u2014while Camus is pleased that intentionality\nfollows the absurd spirit in its \u201capparent modesty of thought\nthat limits itself to describing what it declines to explain\u201d\n(MS, 43). However, Camus criticizes Husserl\u2019s later\nsearch in Ideas for Platonic extra-temporal essences as a\nquasi-religious leap inconsistent with his original insight.\n",
