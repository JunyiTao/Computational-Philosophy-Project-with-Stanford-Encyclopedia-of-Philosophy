    "main_text": "Exegesis\n2. Exegesis\n\nKaspi considered himself primarily a commentator. He distinguishes\nbetween a \u201ccommentary\u201d (perush) and an\nindependent work (\u1e25ibbur), declaring, \u201cI do not\ndefine a work as a \u2018commentary\u2019 unless it brings us to the\nreal intention of the author of the book\u201d (Commentary on the\nSong of Songs, p. 184). Nevertheless, he sometimes admits his\ninability to prove that his interpretation represents the\nauthor\u2019s real meaning, particularly when that\n\u201cauthor\u201d is the biblical one, i.e., God, Himself:\n\nI do not assert that the intention of its Giver [= of the Torah] was\nthose same purposes that I have assumed, for perhaps those were not\nintended, but he combined them with other intentions, presently hidden\nfrom us\u2026 For the same thing may have many purposes that do not\nnecessarily contradict one another\u2026 Nevertheless what I\nsay\u2026, whether I prophesy their author\u2019s intentions or\nnot, what I say is true, that we have learned such and such a matter\nfrom the subject of the narratives (Tirat Kesef, p. 64).\n\n\nUnderstanding the author\u2019s intention is thus seen as a kind of\nprophecy (\u201cwhether I prophesy the\nintention\u2026\u201d). Kaspi\u2019s interpretative truth, he\ninsists, is concerned not with the author and his intention, but with\nthe reader and his or her understanding: The commentator can speak for\nhimself alone. Such exegesis is subjective, dependent on each of the\nwork\u2019s innumerable readers. Nevertheless, Kaspi is sometimes\nreasonably sure of the author\u2019s meaning:\n\nI have revealed to you what the Lord revealed to us of His secrets,\nfor I think that we have thereby arrived in this chapter at the\nauthor\u2019s intention; \u201cthe truth,\u201d as Aristotle says,\n\u201cis its own witness, agreeing in every aspect.\u201d The\nmeaning of \u201cagreeing in every aspect\u201d is in what he\nexplained, saying, \u201cthat one aspect thereof attests to [another]\naspect\u2026\u201d\u2026 Now our own Sages of blessed memory have\nalready said, \u201cwords of truth are recognizable\u201d\n[Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 9b] (Tirat Kesef, p. 83).\n\n\nHere, Kaspi boldly implies  that God somehow informed\nhim of the secret hidden in the text. The criterion of his\ncertainty is coherence. However, given Kaspi\u2019s own theology (see\nbelow), he was not claiming to have received a supernatural\nrevelation. Despite what some consider to be a radical adherence to\nAristotelian philosophy, Kaspi had a conservative outlook on\neverything concerning the written word of the Bible and the way it is\nread. He maintained that the written word, or its reading, has not\nchanged since the early sages of the Second Temple period . The way in\nwhich Jews write the Torah scroll is the same as in the original\nversion. The square-like Assyrian lettering, known from the Torah\nscrolls of today, was the same as that given to Moses at Sinai. Even\nthe division into the five books, including the weekly portions, were\nall present from the early sages of the Second Temple period. Kaspi\ndifferentiated between the early sages of the Second Temple period\n(who held traditions received from Moses, and therefore reflect the\nintent of the writer of the Torah), and later sages, the\nTanna\u2019im and Amora\u2019im of rabbinic writings, whose\ninterpretations of the biblical narrative may be disputed if they\ndisagree with the plain interpretation of the Bible.\n",
