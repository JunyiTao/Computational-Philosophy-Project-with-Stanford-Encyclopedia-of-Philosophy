He identified two different, opposed approaches based on\nthis erroneous assumption. One was the \u2018deflationary\u2019\napproach, which sought to assimilate all propositions to one true\ntype. Thus, phenomenalism sought to translate all statements into\nassertions about immediately perceived sense data. The other was the\n\u2018inflationary\u2019 approach, which posited entities\ncorresponding to all statements, thus \u2018creating\u2019 or\nasserting the existence of things that didn\u2019t exist at all. Both\nof these errors stemmed from a demand for a \u2018forcible\nassimilation\u2019 of all propositions to a single type. Berlin\nsuggested that such a demand was based, not on a true perception of\nreality, but rather on a psychological need for certainty, uniformity\nand simplicity, as well as what he termed the \u2018Ionian\nFallacy\u2019, the assumption that everything is made out of, or can\nbe reduced to or understood in terms of, one and the same substance or\n type.[5]\n\nBerlin insisted that there is no single criterion of meaningfulness,\nno absolutely incorrigible type of knowledge. The quest for certainty\nwas self-defeating: to restrict oneself to saying only that which\ncould be said without any doubt or fear of being mistaken was to\nsentence oneself to silence. To say anything about the world requires\nbringing in something other than immediate experience:\n\nThe vast majority of the types of reasoning on which our beliefs rest,\nor by which we should seek to justify them [\u2026], are not\nreducible to formal deductive or inductive schemata, or combinations\nof them. [\u2026] The web is too complex, the elements too many and\nnot, to say the least, easily isolated and tested one by one;\n[\u2026] we accept the total texture, compounded as it is out of\nliterally countless strands \u2013 [\u2026] without the\npossibility, even in principle, of any test for it in its totality.\nFor the total texture is what we begin and end with. There is no\nArchimedean point outside it whence we can survey the whole and\npronounce upon it. [\u2026] It is the sense of the general texture\nof experience [\u2026] that constitutes the foundation of knowledge,\nthat is itself not open to inductive or deductive reasoning: for both\nthese methods rest upon it. (1978b, 149\u201350)\n\n\nAt the heart of Berlin\u2019s philosophy was an awareness of the\nenormous variety and complexity of reality, which we can only begin to\ncomprehend: the many strands that make up human experience are\n\u2018too many, too minute, too fleeting, too blurred at the edges\n[to be integrated into a total picture of experience]. They\ncriss-cross and penetrate each other at many levels simultaneously,\nand the attempt to prise them apart [\u2026] and pin them down, and\nclassify them, and fit them into their specific compartments, turns\nout to be impracticable\u2019 (1978b, 156).\n\nThese two closely related propositions \u2013 that absolute certainty\nis an impossible ideal (Berlin once wrote that, if his work displayed\nany \u2018single tendency\u2019, it was a \u2018distrust of all\nclaims to the possession of incorrigible knowledge about issues of\nfact or principle in any sphere of human behaviour\u2019: 1978a, x),\nand that not everything can or should be reduced or related to a\nsingle ideal, model, theory or standard \u2013 might be considered\nthe centrepieces of Berlin\u2019s philosophy. They are central to his\nview of language and knowledge; they are equally important to his\nethics and his philosophy of the humanities. Also central to these\ndifferent facets of his thought was Berlin\u2019s emphasis on the\nimportance, and indeed priority, of particular things as objects of\nknowledge and of individual people as moral subjects.\n",
