    "main_text": "\n\nThe Minim friar Marin Mersenne (1588\u20131648) played a central role\nin French intellectual life of the first half of the seventeenth\ncentury. At a time when scientific periodicals were still sorely\nlacking, he was rightly referred to as \u201cThe Secretary of Learned\nEurope\u201d (\u201cle secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019Europe\nsavante\u201d, Haur\u00e9au 1877, p. 177) thanks to his\nsprawling correspondence, which extended his network across the whole\nof learned Europe, to his role as translator, editor, disseminator of\nscientific information, and to his ability to generate research and\ndiscoveries by creating \u201cfine questions\u201d (de belles\nquestions, Pascal 1658, p. 1) addressed to the foremost scholars\nof the time. His tireless activity certainly helped to create a new\nimage of a mathematical, mechanistic and experimental science in the\nmaking, based on the exchange of information and co-operation between\nEuropean scholars. Part of his fame is also due to his lifelong\nconnection to Descartes. From the time the latter settled in Holland,\nMersenne was his main, and at times unique, correspondent, providing\nhim with rich information on intellectual life, and relentlessly\nquestioning him on philosophical and scientific matters.\n\nAlthough these features of Mersenne\u2019s activities (as an animator\nof scientific life and as Descartes\u2019s friend and correspondent)\nare the most well-known, they should not conceal Mersenne\u2019s own\noriginal contribution to philosophy. While his first works were\npolemic in tone, offering \u201cscientific apologetics\u201d\n(Lenoble 1943) using arguments taken from the sciences to defend\nChristian catholic religion against all sorts of heterodox trends\nthreatening it, his latter publications (from 1634 onward), far less\nconcerned with apologetics, illustrated and promoted the new\nmechanical, mathematical, and experimental sciences. A key thread\nrunning through his complex intellectual career, music, understood as\nthe general science of harmonics, received Mersenne\u2019s constant\nattention and was the subject of several important publications.\n",
