Fuzzy connectives based on t-norms\n\nThe standard set of truth-values for fuzzy logics is the real unit\ninterval \\([0,1]\\) with its natural ordering \\(\\leq\\), ranging from\ntotal falsity (represented by \\(0\\)) to total truth (represented by\n\\(1\\)) through a continuum of intermediate degrees of truth (see\nSections\n 5\n and\n 7\n for alternative interpretations of truth constants and alternative\nsets of truth-values). A fundamental assumption of (mainstream)\nmathematical fuzzy logic is that connectives are to be interpreted\ntruth-functionally over the set of degrees of truth. Such\ntruth functions are assumed, in the standard setting, to behave\nclassically on the extremal values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). A very natural\nbehavior of conjunction, disjunction, and negation is achieved by\nimposing \\(x \\land y = \\min\\{x,y\\}\\), \\(x \\lor y = \\max\\{x,y\\}\\), and\n\\(\\neg x = 1 - x\\) for each \\(x,y \\in [0,1]\\).\n\nThese three truth functions yield the original semantics of fuzzy\nlogic proposed by Joseph Goguen (1975), later studied formally by,\ne.g., Gehrke, Walker, & Walker (1997). Many researchers still\nrefer to it as \u201cthe fuzzy logic\u201d. However, it has soon\nbecome apparent that this semantic framework is too poor to (1)\nencode/model numerous interesting aspects of reasoning and (2) to\nsupport a fully fledged theory of mathematical logic. \n\nAnother, non-idempotent, conjunction \\(\\&\\) is typically added to\naccount for the intuition that applying a partially true hypothesis\ntwice might lead to a different degree of truth than using it only\nonce. Such a conjunction is usually interpreted by a binary operation\non \\([0,1]\\), which is not necessarily idempotent, but still\nassociative, commutative, non-decreasing in both arguments and has\n\\(1\\) as neutral element. These operations are called t-norms\n(triangular norms) and their mathematical properties have\nbeen thoroughly studied (see Klement, Mesiar, & Pap 2000).\nProminent examples of t-norms are the already mentioned function\n\\(\\min\\), the standard product \\(\\cdot\\) of real numbers, and the\n\u0141ukasiewicz t-norm: \\(x *_{\u0141} y=\\max\\{x+y-1,0\\}\\). These\nthree t-norms are actually continuous functions and any other\ncontinuous t-norm can be described as an ordinal sum of these\nthree basic ones (Ling 1965; Mostert & Shields 1957).\n\nInterestingly, each left-continuous t-norm determines a suitable\nchoice for implication. Indeed, it is known that a t-norm \\(\\ast\\) is\nleft-continuous if, and only if, there is a unique binary operation\n\\(\\Rightarrow_\\ast\\) on \\([0,1]\\) satisfying the so-called\nresiduation condition: \n\n\\[\nx \\ast y \\leq z\\ \\text{ if and only if }\\ x \\leq y \\Rightarrow_\\ast z.\n\\] \n\n The function\n\\(\\Rightarrow_\\ast\\) is known as residuum of \\(\\ast\\), and it\ncan be shown that \\(x \\Rightarrow_\\ast y = \\max\\{z \\mid x \\ast z \\leq\ny\\}\\). The residua of the three mentioned prominent t-norms are: \\(x\n\\Rightarrow_\\min y = 1\\) if \\(x\\leq y\\) and \\(y\\) otherwise; \\(x\n\\Rightarrow_\\cdot y = 1\\) if \\(x\\leq y\\) and \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\)\notherwise; and \\(x \\Rightarrow_{\u0141} y = \\min\\{1, 1 - x+y\\}\\).\n\nIn the general t-norm setting, the negation is interpreted using the\nresiduum. Namely, for a given left-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\) we set\n\\(\\neg_\\ast x = x\\Rightarrow_\\ast 0\\). For the \u0141ukasiewicz t-norm\nwe obtain the negation \\(\\neg_{\u0141} x = 1 - x\\) (known as\n\u0141ukasiewicz negation or the standard involutive negation) whereas for the\nminimum and the product t-norms we obtain the same negation (known as\nG\u00f6del negation): \\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} 0 = 1\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise.\n\n",
