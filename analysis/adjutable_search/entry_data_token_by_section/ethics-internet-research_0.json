    "main_text": "Definitions\n1. Definitions\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of Internet research ethics (IRE) has\nbeen used by Buchanan and Ess (2008, 2009), Buchanan (2011), and Ess\n& Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) (2002):\n\n\nIRE is defined as the analysis of ethical issues and\napplication of research ethics principles as they pertain to research\nconducted on and in the Internet. Internet-based research, broadly\ndefined, is research which utilizes the Internet to collect\ninformation through an online tool, such as an online survey; studies\nabout how people use the Internet, e.g., through collecting data\nand/or examining activities in or on any online environments; and/or,\nuses of online datasets, databases, or repositories.\n\n\nThese examples were broadened in 2013 by the United States\nSecretary\u2019s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research\nProtections (SACHRP 2013), and included under the umbrella term\nInternet Research:\n\nResearch studying information that is already available on or via\nthe Internet without direct interaction with human subjects\n(harvesting, mining, profiling, scraping, observation or recording of\notherwise-existing data sets, chat room interactions, blogs, social\nmedia postings, etc.)\nResearch that uses the Internet as a vehicle for recruiting or\ninteracting, directly or indirectly, with subjects (Self-testing\nwebsites, survey tools, Amazon Mechanical Turk, etc.)\nResearch about the Internet itself and its effects (use patterns\nor effects of social media, search engines, email, etc.; evolution of\nprivacy issues; information contagion; etc.)\nResearch about Internet users: what they do, and how the Internet\naffects individuals and their behaviors Research that utilizes the\nInternet as an interventional tool, for example, interventions that\ninfluence subjects\u2019 behavior\nOthers (emerging and cross-platform types of research and methods,\nincluding m-research (mobile))\nRecruitment in or through Internet locales or tools, for example\nsocial media, push technologies\n\n\nA critical distinction in the definition of Internet research ethics\nis that between the Internet as a research tool versus a research\nvenue. The distinction between tool and venue plays out across\ndisciplinary and methodological orientations. As a tool, Internet\nresearch is enabled by search engines, data aggregators, digital\narchives, application programming interfaces (APIs), online survey\nplatforms, and crowdsourcing platforms. Internet-based research venues\ninclude such spaces as conversation applications (instant messaging\nand discussion forums, for example), online multiplayer games, blogs\nand interactive websites, and social networking platforms.\n\nAnother way of conceptualizing the distinction between tool and venue\ncomes from Kitchin (2008), who has referred to a distinction in\nInternet research using the concepts of \u201cengaged web-based\nresearch\u201d versus \u201cnon-intrusive web-based\nresearch:\u201d\n\n\nNon-intrusive analyses refer to techniques of data collection that do\nnot interrupt the naturally occurring state of the site or\ncybercommunity, or interfere with premanufactured text. Conversely,\nengaged analyses reach into the site or community and thus engage the\nparticipants of the web source (2008: 15).\n\n\nThese two constructs provide researchers with a way of recognizing\nwhen considering of human subject protections might need to occur.\nMcKee and Porter (2009), as well as Banks and Eble (2007) provide\nguidance on the continuum of human-subjects research, noting a\ndistinction between person-based versus text-based. For example, McKee\nand Porter provide a range of research variables (public/private,\ntopic sensitivity, degree of interaction, and subject vulnerability)\nwhich are useful in determining where on the continuum of text-based\nversus how person-based the research is, and whether or not subjects\nwould need to consent to the research (2009: 87\u201388).\n\nWhile conceptually useful for determining human subjects\nparticipation, the distinction between tool and venue or engaged\nversus non-intrusive web-based research is increasingly blurring in\nthe face of social media and their third-party applications. Buchanan\n(2016) has conceptualized three phases or stages of Internet research,\nand the emergence of social media characterize the second phase, circa\n2006\u20132014. The concept of social media entails\n\n\nA group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological\nand technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation\nand exchange of user-generated content (Kaplan & Haenlein 2010:\n61).\n\n\nA \u201csocial network site\u201d is a category of websites with\nprofiles, semi-persistent public commentary on the profile, and a\ntraversable publicly articulated social network displayed in relation\nto the profile.\n\nThis collapse of tool and venue can be traced primarily to the\nincreasing use of third-party sites and applications such as Facebook,\nTwitter, or any of the myriad online research tools where subject or\nparticipant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and data\ndissemination can all occur in the same space. With these collapsing\nboundaries, the terms of \u201cinter-jurisdictional\ncoordination\u201d (Gilbert 2009: 3) are inherently challenging;\nGilbert has specifically argued against the terms of use or end-user\nlicense agreement stipulations in virtual worlds, noting that such\nagreements are often \u201cflawed\u201d, as they rely on laws and\nregulations from a specific locale and attempt to enforce them in a\nnon place-based environment. Nonetheless, researchers now make\nfrequent use of data aggregation tools, scraping data from user\nprofiles or transaction logs, harvesting data from Twitter streams, or\nstoring data on cloud servers such as Dropbox only after agreeing to\nthe terms of service that go along with those sites. The use of such\nthird party applications or tools changes fundamental aspects of\nresearch, oftentimes displacing the researcher or research team as the\nsole owner of their data. These unique characteristics implicate\nconcepts and practicalities of privacy, consent, ownership, and\njurisdictional boundaries.\n\nA key moment that typified and called attention to many of these\nconcerns emerged with the 2014 Facebook Emotional Contagion study\n(Booth, 2014). By virtue of agreeing to Facebook\u2019s Terms of\nService, did users consent to participation in research activities?\nShould there have been a debriefing after the experiment? How\nthoroughly did a university research ethics board review the study?\nShould industry-sponsored research undergo internal ethics review? In\nresponse to the outcry of the Contagion study, Ok Cupid\u2019s\nChristian Rudder (2014\n [OIR])\n defended these sorts of experiments, noting\n\n\nWe noticed recently that people didn\u2019t like it when Facebook\n\u201cexperimented\u201d with their news feed. Even the FTC is\ngetting involved. But guess what, everybody: if you use the Internet,\nyou\u2019re the subject of hundreds of experiments at any given time,\non every site. That\u2019s how websites work.\n\n\nThe phenomenon of the social web forces an ongoing negotiation between\nresearchers and their data sources, as seen in the Facebook contagion\nstudy and the subsequent reaction to it. Moreover, with the growing\nuse and concentration of mobile devices, the notion of Internet\nresearch is expanding with a movement away from a\n\u201cplace-based\u201d Internet to a dispersed reality. Data\ncollection from mobile devices has increased exponentially. For\nexample, mobile devices enable the use of synchronous data collection\nand dissemination from non-place based environments. Researchers using\ncloud-enabled applications can send and receive data to and from\nparticipants synchronously. The impact of such research possibilities\nfor epidemiological research is staggering for its scientific\npotential while demanding for the concurrent ethical challenges, as we\nare seeing with mobile-based COVID-19 research (Drew et al., 2020) and\nthe sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in\nreal-time (Hubach et al., forthcoming). As Internet research has grown\nfrom a niche methodology into a nearly ubiquitous and often invisible\npractice, the traditional concepts of human subjects research require\ncareful consideration.\n",
