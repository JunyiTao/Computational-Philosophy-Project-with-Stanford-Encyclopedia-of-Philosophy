    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Religious Journalist\n3.2 Religious Journalist\n\n\nAt the end of 1937 Prior set aside thoughts of an academic career\n\nand travelled to Europe with Clare, spending three bohemian years\n\nthere. They planned to earn a living from freelance writing; Arthur\n\nwanted to gain \u2018a footing in the English literary world\u2019\n(as he wrote to the New Zealand poet Ursula Bethell), and said he had\n\u2018hopes of ending up eventually as the editor of a religious\nperiodical\u2019. This interlude in Europe, and its aftermath in New\nZealand, was a critical period in Prior\u2019s development\u2014the\ncrucible in which the mature thinker was formed. His social and\npolitical philosophy settled firmly to the far left, but ultimately\nfell short of Marxism; his pacifism escalated, only to be overturned by\nworld events; and his theism began to wane into unbelief.\n\n\nJanuary 1938 saw the couple boarding the Orient Line\u2019s S.S.\nOrmonde in Sydney, carrying large rucksacks. The\nOrmonde was bound for London via Colombo, Suez, Naples and\nToulon. In Colombo, Prior took the opportunity to visit \u2018a Hindoo\ntemple, a Buddhist one, a Mahommedan mosque, a Roman Catholic church\n& an Anglican church\u2019. He was, at this stage of his life,\nobsessed with religion. He believed in the virgin birth and the voice\nof the devil, and was a devout Presbyterian (Prior 1940). His\nimpressions after his first encounter with extreme religious diversity\nwere, he said, \u2018very vivid, but very confused\u2019. He\ndescribed the Anglican church as \u2018a foreign growth\u2019, and\nwhat he called \u2018the R. C. place\u2019 was, he said, not\n\u2018sufficiently distinguishable from the idolatries around\nit\u2019. He decided that \u2018Buddhism was a much saner sort of\nreligion than either Hinduism or Mohammedanism\u2019, and that\n\u2018the Mahommedans are a particularly arrogant crowd, &\nobviously think they\u2019re the lords of creation\u2019.\n\n\nPrior mused in a letter, \u2018Ought I not to be trying to do a bit\nof \u201cwitnessing\u201d to these crowds of heathen?\u2019 Several\nof his early publications were given over to propounding the Christian\nmessage: the Christian God, he wrote, is \u2018the Lord God\nOmnipotent, the High and Holy One who inhabiteth ETERNITY, absolutely\nindependent of all being other than himself, and Creator, Lord and\nJudge of all\u2019 (Prior 1934).\n\n\nIn later life, however, he described himself as having \u2018no\nreligious beliefs\u2019 (Prior c.1967). In 1961, when Max\nCresswell\u2014then a logic student aged 21\u2014met him for the\nfirst time, in Manchester, Prior announced: \u2018Mr Cresswell,\nisn\u2019t it a pity that God does not exist\u2019.\n",
