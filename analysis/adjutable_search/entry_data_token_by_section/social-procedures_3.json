Dividing a piece of land at\ninheritance would be an example. The cake has different toppings that\ncannot all be cut into pieces with the same composition: it may have\ncandied cherries on top that someone likes but another person abhors,\nand so on. A cake division is simply fair if\neach of \\(n\\) players feels she received at least \\(1/n\\) of the cake,\naccording to her individual valuation of its parts. A procedure may be\nsimply fair without ruling out the possibility of hard feelings. A\ncake division is called envy-free if each person\nfeels that nobody else received a larger piece. A sure sign of a\ndivision being envy-free is that nobody wishes to trade pieces with\nanyone else. It turns out to be very hard to design cake cutting\nprocedures that are both fair and envy-free. The I cut, you\nchoose procedure is fair, and it is envy-free simply\nbecause the rest of the cake is a single piece, so there is no\npossibility for envy. See the entry on\n economics [normative] and economic justice\n for philosophical discussions of envy-freeness.\n\nR. Parikh (2002) analyzes the so-called\nBanach-Knaster algorithm for cake cutting when the cake has to be\ndivided fairly among at least three persons, which goes like this:\n\n\nI cut a piece intended for myself. All others consider it. If nobody\nobjects, I get my piece. If someone raises an objection, she has the\nright to cut off a slice and put that back with the rest of the cake.\nShe then asks if she can have the reduced piece. If nobody objects,\nshe gets it, otherwise someone else takes the knife and reduces the\npiece a bit further, and so on, until someone gets the trimmed piece.\nThen on to the next round, with \\(n-1\\) players. When two players are\nleft, they use the Divide and choose\nalgorithm.\n\n\nParikh\u2019s discussion shows how the methods of theoretical\ncomputer science can be used to argue that the procedure is fair. The\nkey ingredient of the procedure is a loop operation:\n\n\nContinue to trim the piece until there are no further objections about\nthe size.\n\n\nSuppose \\(r\\) stands for the action of trimming a piece of cake and\nputting it back with the main part of the cake, according to the\nBanach-Knaster algorithm, and suppose \\(F(m,k)\\) is the proposition\nthat the main part of the cake is large enough for \\(k\\) people. Then\nsurely \\(F(m,n)\\) holds at the beginning: the whole cake is large\nenough for the whole group to begin with. Moreover, Parikh (1983,\n2002) uses his game logic to prove that\n\\(F(m,k)\\) is invariant under the action \\(r\\): If \\(F(m,k)\\) is true\nbefore \\(r\\), then it will still be true after \\(r\\) has occurred.\nClearly, if one can show that \\(F(m,k)\\) continues to hold through the\nalgorithm, for \\(k\\) running through \\(n, \\ldots, 1\\), then this\nestablishes that the division is\n fair.[3]\n",
