    "main_text": "Ethics and Moral Psychology || The natural law\n5.2 The will, freedom, and morality\n\nScotus quite self-consciously puts forward his understanding of\nfreedom as an alternative to Aquinas\u2019s. According to Aquinas,\nfreedom comes in simply because the will is intellectual appetite\nrather than mere sense appetite. Intellectual appetite is aimed at\nobjects as presented by the intellect and sense appetite at objects as\npresented by the senses. Sense appetite is not free because the senses\nprovide only particulars as objects of appetite. But intellectual\nappetite is free because the intellect deals with universals, not\nparticulars. Since universals by definition include many particulars,\nintellectual appetite will have a variety of objects. Consider\ngoodness as an example. The will is not aimed at this good thing or\nthat good thing, but at goodness in general. Since that universal,\ngoodness, contains many different particular things, intellectual\nappetite has many different options.\n\nBut Scotus insists that mere intellectual appetite is not enough to\nguarantee freedom in the sense needed for morality. The basic\ndifference comes down to this. When Aquinas argues that intellectual\nappetite has different options, he seems to be thinking of this over a\nspan of time. Right now the intellect presents x as good, so\nI will x; but later on the intellect presents y as\ngood, so then I will y. But Scotus thinks of freedom as\ninvolving multiple options at the very moment of choice. It\u2019s\nnot enough to say that now I will x, but later I can will\ny. We have to say that at the very moment at which I will\nx, I also am able to will y. Aquinas\u2019s\narguments don\u2019t show that intellectual appetite is free in this\nstronger sense. So as far as Scotus is concerned, Aquinas hasn\u2019t\nmade room for the right kind of freedom.\n\nThis is where Scotus brings in his well-known doctrine of the two\naffections of the will (see especially Ordinatio 2, d. 6, q.\n2; 2, d. 39, q. 2; 3, d. 17, q. un.; and 3, d. 26, q. un.). The two\naffections are fundamental inclinations in the will: the affectio\ncommodi, or affection for the advantageous, and the affectio\niustitiae, or affection for justice. Scotus identifies the\naffectio commodi with intellectual appetite. Notice how\nimportant that is. For Aquinas intellectual appetite is the same thing\nas will, whereas for Scotus intellectual appetite is only part of what\nthe will is. Intellectual appetite is just one of the two fundamental\ninclinations in the will. Why does Scotus make this crucial change?\nFor the reason we\u2019ve already discussed. He doesn\u2019t see how\nintellectual appetite could be genuinely free. Now he can\u2019t deny\nthat the will involves intellectual appetite. Intellectual appetite is\naimed at happiness, and surely happiness does have some role to play\nin our moral psychology. But the will has to include something more\nthan intellectual appetite if it\u2019s going to be free. That\nsomething more is the affectio iustitiae. But one can\u2019t\nfully understand what the affectio iustitiae is until Aquinas\nand Scotus are compared on a further point.\n\nFor Aquinas the norms of morality are defined in terms of their\nrelationship to human happiness. We have a natural inclination toward\nour good, which is happiness, and it is that good that determines the\ncontent of morality. So like Aristotle, Aquinas holds a eudaimonistic\ntheory of ethics: the point of the moral life is happiness.\nThat\u2019s why Aquinas can understand the will as an intellectual\nappetite for happiness. All of our choosing is aimed at the human good\n(or at least, it\u2019s aimed at the human good as we conceive it).\nAnd choices are good\u2014and, indeed, fully intelligible\u2014only\nwhen they are aimed at the ultimate end, which is happiness. So\nAquinas just defines the will as the capacity to choose in accordance\nwith a conception of the human good\u2014in other words, as\nintellectual appetite.\n\nWhen Scotus rejects the idea that will is merely intellectual\nappetite, he is saying that there is something fundamentally wrong\nwith eudaimonistic ethics. Morality is not tied to human flourishing\nat all. For it is Scotus\u2019s fundamental conviction that morality\nis impossible without libertarian freedom, and since he sees no way\nfor there to be libertarian freedom on Aquinas\u2019s eudaimonistic\nunderstanding of ethics, Aquinas\u2019s understanding must be\nrejected. And just as Aquinas\u2019s conception of the will was\ntailor-made to suit his eudaimonistic conception of morality,\nScotus\u2019s conception of the will is tailor-made to suit his\nanti-eudaimonistic conception of morality. It\u2019s not merely that\nhe thinks there can be no genuine freedom in mere intellectual\nappetite. It\u2019s also that he rejects the idea that moral norms\nare intimately bound up with human nature and human happiness. The\nfact that God creates human beings with a certain kind of nature does\nnot require God to command or forbid the actions that he in fact\ncommanded or forbade. The actions he commands are not necessary for\nour happiness, and the actions he forbids are not incompatible with\nour happiness. Now if the will were merely intellectual\nappetite\u2014that is, if it were aimed solely at happiness\u2014we\nwould not be able to choose in accordance with the moral law, since\nthe moral law itself is not determined by any considerations about\nhuman happiness. So Scotus relegates concerns about happiness to the\naffectio commodi and assigns whatever is properly moral to\nthe other affection, the affectio iustitiae.\n",
