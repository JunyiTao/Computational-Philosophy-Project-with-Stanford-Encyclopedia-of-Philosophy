Rather than ti (the physical body), the\nDaoist discourse and practices focus on xing (the\n\u201cform\u201d) and shen (the whole person). Maintaining\nthe physical body in good health is not an end in itself; it serves to\nensure that the body and its parts and organs may fulfill their\nemblematic functions.\n\nThese emblematic functions pertain to what Kristofer Schipper has\ncalled the \u201csymbolic vision\u201d of the body (1993: 104 ff)\nand Catherine Despeux has called the \u201csymbolic body\u201d\n(1996: 98). This view is centered on several key notions and\nrepresentations, which receive more or less emphasis according to the\nindividual cases. Five different models of the body can be\ndistinguished within Daoism as a whole:\n\n The cosmological model, where the human being is seen as a\nmicrocosm that contains and reproduces all of the main features of the\nmacrocosm.\n The political model, where the human being is likened to an\nadministrative system, which in turn parallels the bureaucratic\nsystems of the state and of the heavens.\n The theological model, which sees the body as the residence of\ninner gods visualized and nourished in meditation (see\n \u00a79.1\n below).\n The natural model, which pertains to representations of the body\nas a landscape\u2014in particular, a mountain\u2014with peaks,\nwatercourses and other features corresponding to specific internal\nloci or to \u201cflows of energy\u201d (for graphic representations,\nsee Huang 2012: 78\u201381).\n The alchemical model, where the body is seen as containing the\ningredients of the elixir and the tools required to compound it,\nincluding furnace, tripod, and fire.\n\n\nThese five representations are not competing models, and in fact often overlap\none another. For instance, the principles that operate in the cosmos\nand the inner deities that personify those principles are to a large\nextent equivalent: one may understand and represent those principles\nin abstract terms, in deified forms, or simultaneously in both ways.\nCertain aspects of the cosmological and the alchemical models are\nidentical. Similarly, illustrations of the body as a landscape also\ninclude the palaces that function as headquarters for the\nadministration of the body (Huang 2012: id.).\n",
