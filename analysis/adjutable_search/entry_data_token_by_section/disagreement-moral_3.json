    "main_text": "The Nature of Moral Disagreement || Radical Moral Disagreements\n1.3 Radical Moral Disagreements\n\n\nAll moral disagreements are not created equal from a metaethical\npoint of view, as some types are held to be more interesting than\nothers. This has partly to do with the fact that philosophers who\ninvoke moral disagreement in support of antirealist positions typically\nwant to avoid committing themselves to similar positions about other\nareas where disagreement occurs, such as the empirical sciences.\nOvergeneralization worries of that kind are addressed in section 6. But\na common response to them is to argue that there are crucial\ndifferences between disagreement over moral issues and that which\noccurs in the other areas.\n\n\nOn one such suggestion, many moral disagreements are particularly\npervasive and hard to resolve. The disagreements which arise for\nexample in the sciences can generally, it is held, be attributed to a\nlack of evidence, bias, limited reasoning skills or similar cognitive\nshortcomings and tend to go away when progress has been made in\nremoving those obstacles. That situation, however, is contrasted with\nthe one which is supposed to obtain in ethics, where many disagreements\nallegedly would survive such measures and persist even if none of its\nparties were affected by any factor which could plausibly be regarded\nas an epistemic shortcoming. That is, the idea is that disagreements\nwould persist even in circumstances that are ideal in the sense that\nthey are the most favorable circumstances that human inquirers can hope\nto achieve. This is why some theorists assign special weight to\ndisagreements among philosophers, who presumably are the most likely\ncandidates of being in such circumstances, given their training,\nfamiliarity with each other\u2019s arguments, and the time they have\nspent on reflecting on the issues.\n\n\nIn what follows, a moral disagreement that would persist in ideal\ncircumstances is called \u201cradical\u201d. The claim that much of\nthe existing moral disagreement is radical is a premise in some\narguments from moral disagreement, although different arguments explain\nits significance differently. It should be noted, however, that there\nare also arguments which invoke weaker assumptions about the nature of\nthe existing disagreement and do not require that any of it is radical\n(as is illustrated below).\n\n\nRealists tend to agree with antirealists that radical moral\ndisagreements are the most troublesome (see, e.g., Parfit 2011, 546),\nbut they question the grounds for postulating such disagreements. They\nmight in that context use several complementary strategies. One, which\nmay be especially applicable to intercultural differences, is to argue\nthat some disagreements are in fact merely apparent. Thus, polygamy is\njudged acceptable in some societies but deemed unacceptable in others.\nIf each of those judgments contains an implicit indexical element,\ngiven which it holds only for the society in which it is held, then\nthey are not incompatible. Indeed, if the conditions that obtain in\nthose societies are different, then the situation is consistent with\nassuming that certain more basic principles are accepted in all\nsocieties, from which the differing views about polygamy could be\nderived. (This possibility is noted by John Mackie, who however\ndownplays its importance, see 1977, 37.)\n\n\nAnother strategy is to insist that many moral disagreements can\nafter all be attributed to factors that are analogous to those that\nunderlie scientific ones (e.g., Smith 1994, 155\u2013161) or to related\nfactors that are supposed to be especially pertinent to moral inquiry\n(for a rich account of both options, see Brink 1989, ch. 7). For\nexample, it is often noted that moral disputes are frequently rooted in\ndisagreement about non-moral facts (e.g., Boyd 1988, 213), such as when\npeople have opposing views about the death penalty because of different\nbeliefs about the effects of permitting it. Those cases do arguably not\nprovide any particular problem for moral realism and can be seen as\ninstances of disagreement which is due to a lack of evidence. A further\ndistorting factor is self-interest, whose influence may make people\nresist plausible moral views just because those views represent them or\nthe behavior they want to engage in as immoral. That mechanism may help\nto explain why there is more disagreement in ethics than in areas where\nself-interest is less of an issue (see Nagel 1986, 148; and\nShafer-Landau 2006, 219 for this suggestion). Yet further examples are\nbias and prejudice, lack of imagination, and, as for example David\nBrink has stressed (1989, 197\u2013210), an insufficient amount of\nsystematic reflection. In specifically addressing the lack of\nconvergence among ethicists, Derek Parfit has made the congenial\nsuggestion that it is premature to draw antirealist conclusions from\nit, as secular moral reasoning has been pursued for a relatively short\ntime (1984, 454). The suggestion is that fruitful moral inquiry has\nbeen constrained by religious influences in ways that do not promote\ntruth-seeking, just as research about empirical issues was similarly\nhampered before the scientific revolution. According to Parfit, this\nmeans that it is not irrational to be hopeful about future convergence\nof the very same kind that occurs in the sciences (see also Wedgewood\n2014 for a discussion of disagreement among philosophers). The list of\navailable strategies could be extended, and the question, in the\ncontext of the assessment of some (but not all) arguments from moral\ndisagreement, is what scope their application leaves for postulating\nany remaining ones.\n",
