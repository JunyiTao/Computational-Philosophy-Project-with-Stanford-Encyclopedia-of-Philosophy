    "main_text": "Verification || Models and Theories\n6.1 Models and Theories\n\nFormal verification methods require a representation of the\nsoftware under verification. In theorem proving (see van\nLeeuwen 1990), programs are represented in terms of axiomatic systems\nand a set of rules of inference representing the pre- and\npost-conditions of program transitions. A proof of correctness is then\nobtained by deriving formulas expressing specifications from the\naxioms. In model checking (Baier and Katoen 2008), a program\nis represented in terms of a state transition system, its property\nspecifications are formalised by temporal logic formulas (Kr\u00f6ger\nand Merz 2008), and a proof of correctness is achieved by a\ndepth-first search algorithm that checks whether those formulas hold\nof the state transition system.\n\nAxiomatic systems and state transition systems used for correctness\nevaluation can be understood as theories of the represented\nartifacts, in that they are used to predict and explain their future\nbehaviors. Methodologically state transition systems in model checking\ncan be compared with scientific models in empirical sciences (Angius\nand Tamburrini 2011). For instance, Kripke Structures (see Clarke\net al. 1999 ch. 2) are in compliance with Suppes\u2019\n(1960) definition of scientific models as set-theoretic structures\nestablishing proper mapping relations with models of data collected by\nmeans of experiments on the target empirical system (see also the\nentry on\n models in science).\n Kripke Structures and other state transition systems utilized in\nformal verification methods are often called system specifications.\nThey are distinguished from common specifications, also called\nproperty specifications. The latter specify some required behavioral\nproperties the program to be encoded must instantiate, while the\nformer specify (in principle) all potential executions of an already\nencoded program, thus allowing for algorithmic checks on its traces\n(Clarke et al. 1999). In order to achieve this goal, system\nspecifications are considered as abductive structures,\nhypothesizing the set of potential executions of a target\ncomputational system on the basis of the program\u2019s code and the\nallowed state transitions (Angius 2013b). Indeed, once it has been\nchecked whether some temporal logic formula holds of the modeled\nKripke Structure, the represented program is empirically tested\nagainst the behavioral property corresponding to the checked formula,\nin order to evaluate whether the model-hypothesis is an adequate\nrepresentation of the target computational system. Accordingly,\nproperty specifications and system specifications differ also in their\nintentional stance (Turner 2011): the former are requirements\non the program to be encoded, the latter are (hypothetical)\ndescriptions of the encoded program. The descriptive and abductive\ncharacter of state transition systems in model checking is an\nadditional and essential feature putting state transition systems on a\npar with scientific models.\n",
