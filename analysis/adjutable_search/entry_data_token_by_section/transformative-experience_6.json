    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Ideology\n1.6 Ideology\n\nOur beliefs shape who we are, and changes to our core beliefs have the\npotential to transform us. For instance, De Cruz (2018) and Chan\n(2016, 2019) argue that religious conversions are transformative. The\nmission statements of universities appear to acknowledge and strive\nfor transformation among students (Paul & Quiggin 2020).\nSchwenkler (2020) and Stump (2020) both investigate the nuances of\nopening oneself up to ideological conversion in light of the potential\nfor doxastic and philosophical transformation, respectively.\nCrucially, when ideological difference are too great, people lose the\nability to adopt the perspective of others. This applies both\nintrapersonally, such as when we look back at our past selves and\nmarvel at how we believed in Santa Claus, and interpersonally, which\nleads to the sort of breakdown we see in hyper-polarized political\ncontexts. Speaking of politics, holding office or participating in\npolitics in some deep way might also be transformative, both because\nthey involve encountering people with different perspectives and also\nbecause they require representing them in a meaningful way (see Allen\n2017). It\u2019s tempting to think that changes in belief are merely\nepistemically transformative since they clearly change our epistemic\nstates. But in the New Testament (Acts 9), Saul\u2019s conversion on\nthe road to Damascus into the Apostle Paul isn\u2019t just a change\nin beliefs, it\u2019s a deeper change that completely alters the way\nhe lives his life. The scales falling off his eyes does not merely\nsignify seeing the truth; it also represents a change to who he\nis.\n",
