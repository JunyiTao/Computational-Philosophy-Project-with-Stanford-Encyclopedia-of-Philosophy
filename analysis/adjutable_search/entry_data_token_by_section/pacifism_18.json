    "main_text": "Religious and Cultural Basis || Diverse Religious and Cultural Sources\n5.2 Diverse Religious and Cultural Sources\n\nThe general rejection of war has a long history that parallels the\njust war tradition and its idea that wars should be fought for the\nsake of peace and justice. In the West, pacifism and the just war\ntradition have roots in both Christian and non-Christian sources. For\nChristian thinkers, one of the primary problems is trying to reconcile\nthe pacific commandments of Jesus with the apparent moral necessity of\nusing war to defend the innocent. This problem is acute for Christians\nsince Jesus seems to advocate an ethic of nonviolence both in the\nSermon on the Mount and in his submission to violence, while Augustine\nand others use both Biblical sources (such as Paul\u2019s letter to\nthe Romans) and natural law to argue in favor of the just war idea. In\nthe European tradition, pacifism is an ideal that develops alongside\nof and in contrast to the just war tradition, with adherents of\npacifism including the Mennonites and Quakers, as well as Christian\nhumanists such as Erasmus.\n\nThe problem of justifying war is also found in Greek thinkers, such as\nPlato, who argued in the Laws that war should only be waged\nfor the sake of peace and that \u201cit is peace in which each of us\nshould spend most of his life and spend it best\u201d (803d). And in\nthe Crito, Socrates considers the problem of whether it is\never justified to return evil for evil. Socrates begins with the\nassumption that we must do no harm; and he and Crito agree at one\npoint that one \u201cought not retaliate or render evil for evil to\nanyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him\u201d (49d). It\nseems that this idea is behind Socrates decision to remain in prison\nand allow himself to be executed.\n\nPacifism shows up in non-European traditions as well. Jains,\nBuddhists, and others in the Indian tradition share a commitment to\nahimsa or nonviolence as a cardinal virtue (see Howard 2017).\nThe ideal in these traditions is a sort of selflessness in which,\nthrough the dissolution of the self, a larger truth emerges. For\nBuddhists this is based upon the idea of nonattachment: war, violence,\nanger, and hatred result from our attachment to material things.\nAhimsa is also linked to the idea that all sentient beings are\ninterdependent. Thus nonviolence is extended toward a rejection of\nviolence toward sentient beings in general and a commitment to\nvegetarianism. Mohandas Gandhi is perhaps the most famous adherent of\nahimsa of the last century. Gandhi based his commitment to\nnonviolence on a spiritual foundation that emphasized\nself-renunciation (brahmacharya) and the positive action of\nthe force of love or force of truth that he called\nsatyagraha.\n\nWhile Indian traditions are often cited as sources of pacifism, it is\nalso important to note that pacifism and nonviolence can be found in\nIslamic traditions and in African religious and philosophical\ntraditions. Ramin Jahanbegloo (2017) argues, for example, that Islam\n(whose root is salaam, which means peace) includes a rich\nconversation about violence and peace. In the South Asian context of\nthe 20th Century, Muslims such as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Khan\nAbdul Ghaffar Khan joined Gandhi in affirming the power of\nnonviolence. There has been discussion among some Western politicians\nand journalists in the past couple of decades about whether there is\nsomething inherently violent about Islam and its notion of\njihad. But scholars such as Cole (2021) and Shadi (2017) show\nthat the diverse Muslim tradition includes a number of pacifist\nthinkers. And Alvi (2021) explains that a notion of nonviolent\njihad can be found in Islam in relation to the idea of jihad as\nspiritual struggle, and with regard to the role of nonviolent activism\nin Islamic contexts.\n\nA similar kind of diversity can be found across the world\u2019s\ntraditions. This includes pacifist ideas found in a variety of\nindigenous traditions. And often this involves a kind of syncretism\nthat results from colonialism. One example in North America is worth\nnoting: the case of Papunhank, a native American convert to Quaker\nreligion in Pennsylvania during colonial times, who has been cited as\na \u201cpacifist prophet\u201d (see Pointer 2020). In African thought this\nsyncretism also includes the influence of Christianity and Islam. For\nexample, the Jahkanke pacifists of West Africa were an Islamic sect\n(see Sanneh 2016). And it is important to note that Gandhi was also at\nwork in South Africa, where Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu\nare now seen as important figures in the history of nonviolence. While\nTutu works in the Christian tradition, we also see an emphasis on\nnonviolence in indigenous African contexts. Gail Presbey has traced\nout numerous examples of this, including the way that nonviolence is\nrelated to concepts such as ubuntu (Presbey 2017).\n\nIt is to note that the distinction between European and non-European\ntraditions breaks down in the 20th Century: Gandhi was\ninspired by Thoreau and by Tolstoy; and Gandhi in turn inspired\nWestern pacifists such as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and\nMartin Luther King Jr. Gandhi and King both claim that one of the most\nimportant ideas underlying this sort of pacifism is love, especially\nthe disinterested brotherly love that is described in the Greek New\nTestament using the word agape. King explains it this way:\n\u201cIn the final analysis, agape means recognition of the fact that\nall life is interrelated. All humanity is involved in a single\nprocess, and all men are brothers. To the degree that I harm my\nbrother, no matter what he is doing to me, to that extent I am harming\nmyself\u201d (King 1986, 20) This idea represents the extension of\nChristian pacifism in light of Gandhian principles.\n\nFurther discussions should more systematically consider how such ideas\nhave spread to Latin America, East Asia, and the Muslim world, as well\nas the ways that nonviolence shows up in the religious and\nphilosophical traditions of the rest of the world. Research projects\nin pacifism and peace studies should continue to explore ideas found\nin the variety of world traditions including Taoism, African thought,\nand indigenous American philosophies.\n",
