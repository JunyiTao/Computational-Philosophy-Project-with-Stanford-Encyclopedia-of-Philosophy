    "main_text": "Full Rule-consequentialism\n4. Full Rule-consequentialism\n\nConsequentialists have distinguished three components of their theory:\n(1) their thesis about what makes acts morally wrong, (2) their thesis\nabout the procedure agents should use to make their moral decisions,\nand (3) their thesis about the conditions under which moral sanctions\nsuch as blame, guilt, and praise are appropriate.\n\nWhat we might call full rule-consequentialism consists of\nrule-consequentialist criteria for all three. Thus, full\nrule-consequentialism claims that an act is morally wrong if and only\nif it is forbidden by rules justified by their consequences. It also\nclaims that agents should do their moral decision-making in terms of\nrules justified by their consequences. And it claims that the\nconditions under which moral sanctions should be applied are\ndetermined by rules justified by their consequences.\n\nFull rule-consequentialists may think that there is really only one\nset of rules about these three different subject matters. Or they may\nthink that there are different sets that in some sense correspond to\nor complement one another.\n\nMuch more important than the distinction between different kinds of\nfull rule-consequentialism is the distinction between full\nrule-consequentialism and partial rule-consequentialism.\nPartial rule-consequentialism might take many forms. Let us focus on\nthe most common form. The most common form of partial\nrule-consequentialism claims that agents should make their moral\ndecisions about what to do by reference to rules justified by their\nconsequences, but does not claim that moral wrongness is determined by\nrules justified by their consequences. Partial rule-consequentialists\ntypically subscribe to the theory that moral wrongness is determined\ndirectly in terms of the consequences of the act compared to the\nconsequences of alternative possible acts. This theory of wrongness is\ncalled act-consequentialism.\n\nDistinguishing between full and partial rule-consequentialism\nclarifies the contrast between act-consequentialism and\nrule-consequentialism. Act-consequentialism is best conceived of as\nmaintaining merely the following:\n\nAct-consequentialist criterion of wrongness: An act is wrong if and\nonly if it results in less good than would have resulted from some\navailable alternative act.\n\n\nWhen confronted with that criterion of moral wrongness, many people\nnaturally assume that the way to decide what to do is to apply the\ncriterion, i.e.,\n\nAct-consequentialist moral decision procedure: On each occasion, an\nagent should decide what to do by calculating which act would produce\nthe most good.\n\n\nHowever, consequentialists nearly never defend this\nact-consequentialist decision procedure as a general and typical way\nof making moral decisions (Mill 1861: ch 2; Sidgwick 1907:\n405\u20136, 413, 489\u201390; Moore 1903: 162\u20134; Smart 1956:\n346; 1973: 43, 71; Bales 1971: 257\u201365; Hare 1981; Parfit 1984:\n24\u20139, 31\u201343; Railton 1984: 140\u20136, 152\u20133; Brink\n1989: 216\u20137, 256\u201362, 274\u20136; Pettit and Brennan 1986;\nPettit 1991, 1994, 1997: 156\u201361, 2017; de Lazari-Radek and\nSinger 2014: ch. 10). There are a number of compelling\nconsequentialist reasons why the act-consequentialist decision\nprocedure would be counter-productive.\n\nFirst, very often the agent does not have detailed information about\nwhat the consequences would be of various acts.\n\nSecond, obtaining such information would often involve greater costs\nthan are at stake in the decision to be made.\n\nThird, even if the agent had the information needed to make\ncalculations, the agent might make mistakes in the calculations. (This\nis especially likely when the agent\u2019s natural biases intrude, or\nwhen the calculations are complex, or when they have to be made in a\nhurry.)\n\nFourth, there are what we might call expectation effects. Imagine a\nsociety in which people know that others are naturally biased towards\nthemselves and towards their loved ones but are trying to make their\nevery moral decision by calculating overall good. In such a society,\neach person might well fear that others will go around breaking\npromises, stealing, lying, and even assaulting whenever they convinced\nthemselves that such acts would produce the greatest overall good\n(Woodard 2019: 149). In such a society, people would not feel they\ncould trust one another.\n\nThis fourth consideration is more controversial than the first three.\nFor example, Hodgson 1967, Hospers 1972, and Harsanyi 1982 argue that\ntrust would break down. Singer 1972 and Lewis 1972 argue that it would\nnot.\n\nNevertheless, most philosophers accept that, for all four of the\nreasons above, using an act-consequentialist decision procedure would\nnot maximize the good. Hence even philosophers who espouse the\nact-consequentialist criterion of moral wrongness reject the\nact-consequentialist moral decision procedure. In its place, they\ntypically advocate the following:\n\nRule-consequentialist decision procedure: At least normally, agents\nshould decide what to do by applying rules whose acceptance will\nproduce the best consequences, rules such as \u201cDon\u2019t harm\ninnocent others\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t steal or vandalize\nothers\u2019 property\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t break your\npromises\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t lie\u201d, \u201cPay special\nattention to the needs of your family and friends\u201d, \u201cDo\ngood for others generally\u201d.\n\n\nSince act-consequentialists about the criterion of wrongness typically\naccept this decision procedure, act-consequentialists are in fact\npartial rule-consequentialists. Often, what writers refer to as\nindirect consequentialism is this combination of act-consequentialism\nabout wrongness and rule-consequentialism about the appropriate\ndecision procedure.\n\nStandardly, the decision procedure that full rule-consequentialism\nendorses is the one that it would be best for society to\naccept. The qualification \u201cstandardly\u201d is needed because\nthere are versions of rule-consequentialism that let the rules be\nrelativised to small groups or even individuals (D. Miller 2010; Kahn\n2012). And act-consequentialism insists upon the decision procedure it\nwould be best for the individual to accept. So, according to\nact-consequentialism, since Jack\u2019s and Jill\u2019s capacities\nand situations may be very different, the best decision procedure for\nJack to accept may be different from the best decision procedure for\nJill to accept. However, in practice act-consequentialists typically\nignore for the most part such differences and endorse the above\nrule-consequentialist decision procedure (Hare 1981, chs. 2, 3, 8, 9,\n11; Levy 2000).\n\nWhen act-consequentialists endorse the above rule-consequentialist\ndecision procedure, they acknowledge that following this decision\nprocedure does not guarantee that we will do the act with the best\nconsequences. Sometimes, for example, our following a decision\nprocedure that rules out harming an innocent person will prevent us\nfrom doing that act that would produce the best consequences.\nSimilarly, there will be some circumstances in which stealing,\nbreaking our promises, etc., would produce the best consequences.\nStill, our following a decision procedure that generally rules out\nsuch acts will in the long run and on the whole probably produce far\nbetter consequences than our trying to run consequentialist\ncalculations on an act-by-act basis.\n\nBecause act-consequentialists typically agree with a\nrule-consequentialist decision procedure, whether to classify some\nphilosopher as an act-consequentialist or as a rule-consequentialist\ncan be problematic. For example, G.E. Moore (1903, 1912) is sometimes\nclassified as an act-consequentialist and sometimes as a\nrule-consequentialist. Like so many others, including his teacher\nHenry Sidgwick, Moore combined an act-consequentialist criterion of\nmoral wrongness with a rule-consequentialist procedure for deciding\nwhat to do. Moore simply went further than most in stressing the\ndanger of departing from the rule-consequentialist decision procedure\n(see Shaw 2000). Hare (1981) and Pettit (1991, 1994, 1997) have also\nbeen especially influential act-consequentialists about what makes\nacts right or wrong while holding that everyday decision-making should\nbe conducted in terms of familiar rules focused on things other than\nconsequences.\n",
