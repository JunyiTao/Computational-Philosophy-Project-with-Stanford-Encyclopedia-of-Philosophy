    "main_text": "Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics (GSM) || The Framework of GSM\n6.1 The Framework of GSM\n\nLike BSM, GSM departs from the dynamical system \\((X,\\) \\(\\phi,\\)\n\\(\\mu)\\) introduced in\n Section 3\n (although, as we will see below, it readily generalises to quantum\nmechanics). But this is where the commonalities end. Rather than\npartitioning \\(X\\) into macro-regions, GSM puts a probability density\nfunction \\(\\rho(x)\\) on \\(X\\), often referred to as a\n\u201cdistribution\u201d. This distribution evolves under the\ndynamics of the system through the law \n\\[\\rho_{t}(x) = \\rho_{0}(\\phi_{- t}(x))\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\rho_{0}\\) is the distribution the initial time \\(t_{0}\\) and\n\\(\\phi_{- t}(x)\\) is the micro-state that evolves into \\(x\\) during\n\\(t\\). A distribution is called stationary if it does not change over\ntime, i.e., \\(\\rho_{t}(x)= \\rho_{0}(x)\\) for all \\(t\\). If the\ndistribution is stationary, Gibbs says that the system is in\n\u201cstatistical equilibrium\u201d.\n\nAt the macro-level, a system is characterised by macro-variables,\nwhich are functions \\(f:X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), where\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) are the real numbers. With the exception of entropy and\ntemperature (to which we turn below), GSM takes all physical\nquantities to be represented by such functions. The so-called\nphase average of \\(f\\) is \n\\[\\left\\langle f \\right\\rangle = \\int_{X} f(x) \\rho(x) dx.\\]\n\n\nThe question now is how to interpret this formalism. The standard\ninterpretation is in terms of what is known as an ensemble. An\nensemble is an infinite collection of systems of the same\nkind that differ in their state. Crucially, this is a collection of\ncopies of the entire system and not a collection of\nmolecules. For this reason, Schr\u00f6dinger characterised an ensemble\nas a collection of \u201cmental copies of the one system under\nconsideration\u201d (1952 [1989: 3]). Hence the members of an\nensemble do not interact with each other; an ensemble is not a\nphysical object; and ensembles have no spatiotemporal existence. The\ndistribution can then be interpreted as specifying \u201chow\nmany\u201d systems in the ensemble have their state in certain region\n\\(R\\) of \\(X\\) at time \\(t\\). More precisely, \\(\\rho_{t}(x)\\) is\ninterpreted as giving the probability of finding a system in \\(R\\) at\n\\(t\\) when drawing a system randomly from the ensemble in much the\nsame way in which one draws a ball from an urn: \n\\[p_{t}(R) = \\int_{R} {\\rho_{t}(x)} dx.\\]\n\n\nWhat is the right distribution for a given physical situation? Gibbs\ndiscusses this problem at length and formulates three distributions\nwhich are still used today: the microcanonical distribution\nfor isolated systems, the canonical distribution for system\nwith fluctuating energy, and the grand-canonical distribution\nfor systems with both fluctuating energy and fluctuating particle\nnumber. For a discussion of the formal aspects of these distributions\nsee, for instance, Tolman (1938 [1979]), and for philosophical\ndiscussions see Davey (2008, 2009) and Myrvold (2016).\n\nGibbs\u2019 statistical equilibrium is a condition on an\nensemble being in equilibrium, which is different from an\nindividual system being in equilibrium (as introduced in\n \u00a71).\n The question is how the two relate, and what an experimenter who\nmeasures a physical quantity on a system observes. A standard answer\none finds in SM textbooks appeals to the averaging principle:\nwhen measuring the quantity \\(f\\) on a system in thermal equilibrium,\nthe observed equilibrium value of the property is the ensemble average\n\\(\\langle f\\rangle\\) of an ensemble in ensemble-equilibrium. The\npractice of applying this principle is often called phase\naveraging. One of the core challenges for GSM is to justify this\nprinciple.\n",
