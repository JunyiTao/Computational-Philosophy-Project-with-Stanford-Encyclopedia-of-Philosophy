    "main_text": "Rationality and Realism || Rationality\n6.1 Rationality\n\nCausal explanation, probability, and the Bayesian method are the key\ningredients of Salmon\u2019s view of rationality, which is strictly\nentrenched with his version of realism. A further ingredient is the\nnotion of propensity taken as causal tendency (see\n \u00a7 2.3).\n Salmon\u2019s \u201cRationality and Objectivity in Science\u201d\n(1990d [2005]) defines three grades of rationality standing in\ndifferent relationships with objectivity. The first kind of\nrationality has no connection with objectivity and is identified with\nthe coherence of degrees of conviction, a key requirement of the\nBayesian method. This is called static rationality. Bayesian\nconditionalization, offering a tool to update one\u2019s degree of\nconviction, shapes a stronger type of rationality called\nkinematic. The highest grade of rationality is called\ndynamic, and involves a closer connection with\nobjectivity.\n\nDynamic rationality is dealt with in some detail in \u201cDynamic\nRationality: Propensity, Probability, and Credence\u201d (1988b\n[2005]). This kind of rationality revolves around the tenet that\nrational action must obey the maxim: Respect the frequencies.\nFor it to be accomplished, credence, or the degree of conviction\nleading to action, must be empirically informed, namely it should take\ninto account objective facts. Salmon holds that explanation has a\ncrucial role in that connection because causal knowledge of phenomena\nprovides the optimal basis for action. The notion of propensity is\ndeemed no less fundamental and is assigned the purpose of bridging the\ngap between objective probabilities, namely frequencies, and personal\nprobabilities on whose basis people act. Personal probabilities should\nnot be construed in a subjective sense, not only because for Salmon\nsubjectivism is not an admissible interpretation of probability\n (\u00a7 2.3),\n but more generally because subjective opinions cannot be taken to\noffer good grounds for rational action. Rational action can only be\nbased on rational degrees of conviction, the emphasis being on\nrational as opposed to merely subjective.\n\nAs Salmon observed,\n\n\nit is the operations of physical devices having [\u2026]\npropensities\u2014chance setups, including our own actions\u2014that\nproduce the actual short-run frequencies, on which our fortunes\ndepend, as well as the long-run frequencies which I am calling\nprobabilities. (Salmon 1988b [2005: 148])\n\n\nAssigning a propensity to a chance setup amounts to making a causal\nhypothesis, which can be evaluated by means of Bayes\u2019 rule.\nSince Salmon\u2019s objective Bayesianism\n (\u00a7 3.2)\n holds that prior probabilities are determined on the basis of\nobserved frequencies, the latter are the cornerstone on which the\nwhole procedure of confirming the hypotheses about propensities rests.\nTo sum up, dynamic rationality\n\n\nconsists in the attempt to use propensities\u2014i.e., probabilistic\ncauses\u2014as the weighting factors that occur in the formula for\nexpected utility. Since we cannot be sure that our choices and\ndecisions will be fully efficacious in bringing about desired results,\nit is reasonable to rely on the strengths of probabilistic causes.\nThis line of thought treats our voluntary choices, decisions, and\nactions as probabilistic causes of what happens as a result of our\ndeliberations. Dynamic rationality involves a\npropensity-driven view of objective probabilities and\nshort-run frequencies. (Salmon 1988b [2005: 150])\n\n",
