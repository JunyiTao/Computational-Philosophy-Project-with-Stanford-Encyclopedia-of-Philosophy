    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || Methodological Anarchism\n1.4 Methodological Anarchism\n\nIn his early work Feyerabend (1962) appealed to historical cases to\nreject Hempel\u2019s account of explanation and Nagel\u2019s\nparallel account of intertheoretic reduction (traditionally postulated\nmechanisms of cumulative progress), on the ground that in actual\nhistorical practice meaning change occurs from one major theory to its\nsuccessor. Deducibility thus fails. It also more obviously fails because\nthe two theories are typically mutually inconsistent. Accordingly, one\ncannot reason by traditional logical argument from one to the other.\nFeyerabend introduced his own conception of incommensurability into\nthis work. Anticipating his later broad pluralism, early Feyerabend\nalso extended the Popperian line on testing to a full-blown\nproliferationist methodology. Competing theories should be multiplied\nand tested against each other, because more empirical content is\nthereby brought to light than in testing theories in isolation. In his\nlater work, Feyerabend (1975, 1987, 1989) moved vehemently away from\nthe positions of the Popper school. He vigorously rejected the idea of\na scientific method that makes science superior to other cultural\nenterprises. According to his \u201cmethodological anarchism\u201d,\nany so-called methodological rule, including logical consistency,\ncould be fruitfully violated in some contexts. That said, his\nwell-known slogan, \u201cAnything goes\u201d, was widely read as\nmore radical than he intended, given his playful interactions with his\nfriend Lakatos.\n\nThis later Feyerabend declared that his primary aim was humanitarian,\nnot epistemological, so it was not his purpose to defend the rationality\nof science. His attack on dogmatic, scientistic conservatism, both\nwithin and without scientific communities, has methodological import,\nalbeit negative import. Feyerabend was one of the first to stress the\nstrong historical contingency of scientific work, in context of\njustification as well as discovery, and he defended this contingency\nat the methodological level as well. Thus there is no fixed\nrationality of science. For example, Galileo (he argued in historical\ndetail) introduced a new sort of methodology, a new kind of\nrationality, partly via rhetorical deception, partly with arresting\napplications of mathematics to basic mechanical phenomena.\nGalileo\u2019s new vision happened to win out, but there is no point\nin calling it either rational or irrational in any absolute sense.\n\nPhilosophers, retreating from concrete detail to their abstract\nformalisms, make science look far more rational than it is, stressed\nFeyerabend. \u201c[H]istory, not argument, undermined the\ngods\u201d, and also undermined Aristotelian science and several\nlater scientific orthodoxies (1989: 397, his emphasis). Feyerabend\nrejected \u201cthe separability thesis\u201d, according to which a\nhighly contingent historical processes can furnish scientific products\nthat are true and non-contingent, products that have achieved escape\nvelocity from history as it were (my expression). However, although\nnot as pronounced as in Lakatos, there remain traces of historicist\nconsequentialism in Feyerabend\u2019s view, as when he wrote that\n\u201cscientific achievements can be judged only after the\nevent\u201d ([1975] 1993: 2). There is no \u201ctheory\u201d of\nscientific rationality in Feyerabend, only a historicist anti-theory,\nas it were; but he was not quite the irrationalist that critics took\nhim to be. (See the entry on\n Feyerabend.\n For recent work on historical contingency, see Stanford 2006 and\nSoler et al. 2015.)\n\nFeyerabend embraced the relativism implied by the positions just\ndescribed. In a late work, Science as Art, influenced by the\nprominent Viennese art historian Alois Riegl, he spoke of distinct,\nself-contained scientific styles at different periods that are much\nlike the distinct styles in art (Ginzburg 1998). Such a view fit well\nwith his sometime assertion that there is no scientific progress, just\na succession or multiplicity of styles. Here there is a faint\nconnection to Kuhn\u2019s early views, although the two men\nreportedly did not interact as much as one might expect while both\nwere at Berkeley.\n",
