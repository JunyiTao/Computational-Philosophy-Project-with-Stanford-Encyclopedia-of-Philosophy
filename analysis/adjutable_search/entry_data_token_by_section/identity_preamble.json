    "main_text": "\n\nMuch of the debate about identity in recent decades has been about\npersonal identity, and specifically about personal identity over time,\nbut identity generally, and the identity of things of other kinds,\nhave also attracted attention. Various interrelated problems have been\nat the centre of discussion, but it is fair to say that recent work\nhas focussed particularly on the following areas: the notion of a\ncriterion of identity; the correct analysis of identity over time,\nand, in particular, the disagreement between advocates of perdurance\nand advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time; the\nnotion of identity across possible worlds and the question of its\nrelevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse;\nthe notion of contingent identity; the question of whether the\nidentity relation is, or is similar to, the composition relation; and\nthe notion of vague identity. A radical position, advocated by Peter\nGeach, is that these debates, as usually conducted, are void for lack\nof a subject matter: the notion of absolute identity they\npresuppose has no application; there is only relative\nidentity. Another increasingly popular view is the one advocated by\nDavid Lewis: although the debates make sense they cannot genuinely be\ndebates about identity, since there are no philosophical problems\nabout identity. Identity is an utterly unproblematic notion. What\nthere are, are genuine problems which can be stated using the language\nof identity. But since these can be restated without the language of\nidentity they are not problems about identity. (For example, it is a\npuzzle, an aspect of the so-called \u201cproblem of personal\nidentity\u201d, whether the same person can have different\nbodies at different times. But this is just the puzzle whether\na person can have different bodies at different times. So\nsince it can be stated without the language of personal\n\u201cidentity\u201d, it is not a problem about personal\nidentity, but about personhood.) This article provides an\noverview of the topics indicated above, some assessment of the debates\nand suggestions for further reading.\n",
