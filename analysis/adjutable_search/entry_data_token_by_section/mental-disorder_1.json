    "main_text": "Folk Psychology, Conceptual Analysis, and Science\n2. Folk Psychology, Conceptual Analysis, and Science\n\nBoth common sense folk psychology and medical psychiatry employ\nconcepts of mental disorder or illness, engendering confusion.\n(\u201cDepression\u201d refers to roughly the same mood states and\nattitudes, for example, used by a professionals or non-professionals.)\nInconsistencies arising at the boundaries, where mental disorders meet\nother kinds of disorder, add ambiguity. Rather than traditionally\nmental symptoms, for example, \u201chysterical\u201d\n(\u201cpsychosomatic\u201d, \u201csomatoform\u201d,\n\u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201cconversion\u201d) syndromes\nexhibit bodily maladies and dysfunction ( Scull 2009). Yet they remain\nmental disorders in common understanding, and have long found a place\nin standard psychiatric\n classifications.[3]\n Also anomalous, some conditions with apparently mental symptoms are\nthe causal product of what are, indisputably, diseases of and damage\nto the brain. (Delusions following cerebral hemorrhage are an\nexample.) They are judged to be neurological rather than psychiatric\ncomplaints, and excluded from the class of mental disorders according\nto both everyday conceptions, and diagnostic taxonomies. Similarly,\nalthough perception is widely judged a mental capacity, some\nconditions affecting sight, such as blindness, are absent from\ndiagnostic classifications.\n\nThere are different views about the conceptual relationship between\neveryday and more clinical language about mental disorder, and\nphilosophers and others have approached this matter according to\nvarying foundational assumptions. Both commonsense psychology and\nconceptual analysis reflecting it, are part of what Rachel Cooper\ncalls a broadly \u201cdescriptive\u201d project, which engages\nlinguistic intuitions (Cooper 2020). Opinions vary as to the value and\nimportance of the resulting characterizations. Some insist that the\nconcept of mental disorder employed in psychiatry\u2019s conception\nand classification of disorders is too closely allied to the parallel\nconcepts in folk psychology. According to Dominic Murphy, acceptance\nof inconsistent folk psychological categorizing is ill-suited to the\nproperly scientific taxonomic task which, because it is tied to the\nhope for a theory of the \u201chidden structure\u201d of the\ntaxonomic domain, seeks causal explanation (Murphy 2012). Without a\nprincipled and systematic way to identify the class of mental\ndisorders, these concerns suggest, any disorder taxonomy that is\npresently employed will likely prove inaccurate, and indicate that the\nout-moded, folk psychological category of mental disorder will\neventually be rendered otiose.\n\nMore conservatively, others have urged the practical importance of\nmaintaining the category of mental disorder (Br\u00fclde & Radovic\n2006). Everyday language and the traditional classifications built\naround it have provided a common framework for research and clinical\npractice; and with any further blurring of the boundaries between\nmental disorders and the brain damage and disease treated by\nneurologists, demarcations of professional competence would be lost.\nFear of over-diagnosis, of granting too much power to medical\npsychiatry and the psychopharmacology industry, and of relinquishing\nto experts decisions about mental health and conceptions of eudaimonia\nmore appropriately resolved by non-scientists, have all challenged the\nsocietal place occupied by medical psychiatry (see\n \u00a710).\n\nIt is not only for such considerations of practicality and custom that\ncommon sense concepts have been supported. Some analyses adhere to an\naccount of mind and mental processing employing mentalist terms and\nnormative presuppositions inapplicable within an exclusively\nneuro-physical framework (see\n \u00a74,\n \u00a75, and\n \u00a78).\n Others regard mental disorders as socially constructed entities, the\nexistence and classification of which are inextricably tied to\nsocietal and interpersonal features of the world (see\n \u00a710).\n\nA meta-taxonomy of these varying foundational assumptions includes\nintersecting issues: what mental disorders are; how much we can\npresently know about them; and different approaches to their analysis.\nThus, in one set of contrasts, objectivist (or naturalist) accounts\nhold that as empirically discoverable items mental disorders can be\nprovided value-free description, while evaluativist (or normative)\nanalyses deny the possibility of such description (discussed in\n \u00a78.1).\n Revisionists, prepared to relinquish all current concepts, disagree\nwith conservatives favoring the retention of (at least some)\ntraditional categories. And, in a final sorting, the nature of mental\ndisorder will be sought either through a posteriori\nscientific research based in neurocognitive science, or through\nconceptual analysis derived in part or whole from social and cultural\nnorms.\n",
