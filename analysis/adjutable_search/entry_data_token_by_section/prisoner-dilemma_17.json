    "main_text": "Spatial PDs\n18. Spatial PDs\n\nA previous section discussed a controversial argument that cooperation\nis rational in a PD when each player knows that the other is enough\nlike himself to make it likely that they will choose the same move. An\nanalog of this argument in the evolutionary context is more obviously\ncogent. If agents are not paired at random, but rather are more likely\nto play others employing similar strategies, then cooperative behavior\nis more likely to emerge.\n\nThere are at least three mechanisms by which this kind of\n\u201cassociation\u201d among players can be achieved. One such\nmechanism in evolutionary PDs has been widely studied under the label\n\u201cspatial PD.\u201d Players are arranged in some\n\u201cgeographical\u201d arrangement. This may be an array with a\nrectangular boundary, for example, or a circle, or surface of a sphere\nor surface of a torus with no boundary. From the geographical\narrangement two (possibly identical) kinds of neighborhoods are\nidentified for each player. Agents meet only those in their\n\u201cinteraction\u201d neighborhood, and the evolutionary dynamics\nconsiders only the payoffs to those in their \u201ccomparison\u201d\nneighborhood. Generally, the evolutionary dynamics employed is one of\n\u201cwinner imitation\u201d within the interaction neighborhood.\n(This can model either the idea that each player is invaded by its\nmost successful neighbor or the idea that each player adopts the most\nsuccessful strategy that it sees.) Because both evolution and\ninteraction are \u201clocal,\u201d players are more likely (after\nthe first round) to meet those playing strategies like their own in an\nSPD than they would be in an ordinary evolutionary game. In addition\nto the \u201cassociation\u201d effects, one should also keep in mind\nthat the outcome of SPDs may be influenced by winner imitation\ndynamics, which may drive to extinction strategies that might\nsurvive\u2014and eventually predominate\u2014with the replicator\ndynamics more commonly employed in ordinary EPDs.\n\nAs usual, the impetus for looking at spatial SPDs seems to come from\nAxelrod. Four copies of each of the 63 strategies submitted to\nAxelrod's tournament were arranged on a grid with a spherical geometry\nso that each cell had four neighbors for both interaction and\ncomparison. For every initial random distribution, the resulting SPD\neventually reached a state where the strategy in every cell was\ncooperating with all its neighbors, at which point no further\nevolution is possible. In these end-states only about ten of the 63\noriginal strategies remained. The remaining strategies were no longer\nrandomly distributed, but segregated into clumps of various sizes.\nAxelrod also showed that under special conditions evolution in an SPD\ncan create successions of complex symmetrical patterns that do not\nappear to reach any steady-state equilibrium.\n\nTo get an idea of why cooperative behavior might spread in this and\nsimilar frameworks, consider two agents on either side of a frontier\nbetween cooperating and non-cooperating subpopulations. The\ncooperative agent sees a cooperative neighbor whose four neighbors all\ncooperate, and who therefore gets four times the reward payoff after\nplaying them all. So he will imitate this neighbor's strategy and\nremain cooperative. The non-cooperating agent, on the other hand, sees\nhis cooperative counterpart, who gets three reward payoffs from his\ncooperative neighbors and one sucker payoff. He compares this to the\npayoffs of his non-cooperatiave neighbors. The best these can do is to\nget three punishments and a temptation. So, as long as \\(3R+S\\)\nexceeds \\(3P+T\\), the non-coperative agent on the frontier will adopt\nthe strategy of his cooperative neighbor. Axelrod's payoffs of 5, 3, 1\nand 0 for \\(T\\), \\(R\\), \\(P\\), and \\(S\\), do meet this condition.\n\nNowak and May have investigated in greater detail SPDs in which the\nonly permitted strategies are \\(\\bCu\\) and \\(\\bDu\\). (These are the\nstrategies appropriate among individuals lacking memory or recognition\nskills.) They find that, for a variety of spatial configurations and\ndistributions of strategies, evolution depends on relative payoffs in\na uniform way. When the temptation payoff is sufficiently high,\nclusters of \\(\\bDu\\) grow and those of \\(\\bCu\\) shrink; when it is\nsufficiently low, the \\(\\bDu\\) clusters shrink and the \\(\\bCu\\)\nclusters grow. For a narrow range of intermediate values, we get\nsuccessions of complex patterns like those noted by Axelrod. The\nevolving patterns exhibit great variety. For a given spatial\nconfiguration, however, the ratio \\(\\bCu\\) to \\(\\bDu\\) strategies\nseems to approach the same constant value for all initial\ndistributions of strategies and all temptation payoffs within the\nspecial range. The idea that these simulations partially explain the\npersistence of cooperation in nature has been questioned on the\ngrounds that they assume deterministic (error-free) moves and updates.\nBut the authors report similar phenomena under a variety of\nerror-conditions, although lower relative temptation values are then\nrequired for the survival of the cooperators, and the level of error\ncannot exceed a certain threshold. (See Mukherjii et al, and the reply\nby Nowak et al that immediately follows it.)\n\nGrim, Mar and St Denis report a number of SPD simulations with a\ngreater variety of initial strategies. In general their observations\nconfirm the plausible conjecture that cooperative outcomes are more\ncommon in SPDs than ordinary EPDs. Simulations starting with all of\nthe pure reactive strategies of Nowak and Sigmund (i.e., all of the\nstrategies \\(\\bR(y,p,q)\\) described above where \\(y\\), \\(p\\), and\n\\(q\\) are either 0 or 1.), all ended with\nTFT\u2014i.e., with \\(\\bR(1,1,0)\\)\u2014as the only\nsurvivor (though other outcomes\u2014including one in which \\(\\bDu\\)\nis the sole survivor and ones in which \\(\\bCu\\) and\nTFT are intermixed\u2014are clearly possible.)\nSimulations starting with all of the 64 possible pure strategies in\nwhich a move may depend on the opponent's previous two moves,\nended with mixed populations of survivors employing a variety of\nTFT-like strategies. They all defect after a double\ndefection (\\(\\bD\\)\\(\\bD\\)), though not necessarily after a single\ndefection \\(\\bC\\)\\(\\bD\\) or \\(\\bD\\)\\(\\bC\\)); they all cooperate after\na double cooperation, though not necessarily after a single\ncooperation; they all cooperate in the second round of the game,\nthough not necessarily in the first). (Again, other outcomes are\npossible.) Simulations starting with many (viz., 100) evenly\ndistributed samples of Nowak and Sigmunds mixed reactive strategies,\ntended to be taken over by \\(\\bR(.99,.1)\\), which is a version of\ngenerous TFT with less than half the generosity of\nGTFT. Simulations beginning with a random selection\nof a few (viz., 8) of these strategies tended to evolve to a mixed\nstable or cyclic pattern dominated by a single version of generous\nTFT with considerably more generosity than\nGTFT. \\(\\bR(.99,.6)\\), which is more than twice as\ngenerous as GTFT, seems to have been a frequent\nvictor.\n\nSzab\u00f3 and Hauert have investigated spatial versions of the\noptional PD in some detail. Among their findings is that, for a\nparticular (intermediate) range of payoffs, a population of agents\nplaying \u201cpure\u201d strategies on a square lattice will evolove\ntowards a unique equilibrium in which all three strategies are\npresent. This contrasts with the continuous cycles for the\nnon-spatialized versions of the evolutionary optional PD's discussed\nabove. Like the earlier observations, it may help to explain how a\ngroup might achieve a state other than universal defection, but not\nhow it might achieve a state of universal cooperation.\n\nThe \u201cgeographical\u201d aspect of SPD's need not be taken too\nliterally. For social applications, and probably even for many\nbiological ones, there seems to be no motivation for any particular\ngeometrical arrangement. (Why not a \u201choneycomb,\u201d for\nexample, where each agent has six neighbors, rather than a grid where\neach agent has four or eight?) The interest in SPDs presumably lies in\nthe insight that my \u201cneighborhood\u201d of interaction and my\n\u201cneighborhood\u201d of comparison, is much smaller than the\npopulation as a whole even if it turns out not to be limited by\ndetails of physical geography. Nevertheless SPD models of the\nevolution of cooperation in particular geometrical arrangements have\ngiven us some suggestive and pretty pictures to contemplate. Several\nexamples are accessible through the links at the end of this\nentry.\n",
