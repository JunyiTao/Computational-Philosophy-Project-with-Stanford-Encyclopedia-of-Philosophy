    "main_text": "Contemporary Ethical Concerns about Social Networking Services || Social Networking Services and Cybercrime\n3.5 Social Networking Services and Cybercrime\n\nSNS are hosts for a broad spectrum of \u2018cybercrimes\u2019 and\nrelated direct harms, including but not limited to:\ncyberbullying/cyberharassment, cyberstalking, child exploitation,\ncyberextortion, cyberfraud, illegal surveillance, identity theft,\nintellectual property/copyright violations, cyberespionage,\ncybersabotage and cyberterrorism. Each of these forms of criminal or\nantisocial behavior has a history that well pre-dates Web 2.0\nstandards, and philosophers have tended to leave the specific\ncorrelations between cybercrime and SNS as an empirical matter for\nsocial scientists, law enforcement and Internet security firms to\ninvestigate. Nevertheless, cybercrime is an enduring topic of\nphilosophical interest for the broader field of computer ethics, and\nthe migration to and evolution of such crime on SNS platforms raises\nnew and distinctive ethical issues.\n\nAmong those of great ethical importance is the question of how SNS\nproviders ought to respond to government demands for user data for\ninvestigative or counterterrorism purposes. SNS providers are caught\nbetween the public interest in crime prevention and their need to\npreserve the trust and loyalty of their users, many of whom view\ngovernments as overreaching in their attempts to secure records of\nonline activity. Many companies have opted to favor user security by\nemploying end-to-end encryption of SNS exchanges, much to the chagrin\nof government agencies who insist upon \u2018backdoor\u2019 access\nto user data in the interests of public safety and national\nsecurity.\n\nA related feature of SNS abuse and cybercrime is the associated\nskyrocketing need for content moderation at scale by these platforms.\nBecause automated tools for content moderation remain crude and easily\ngamed, social media platforms rely on large human workforces working\nfor low wages, who must manually screen countless images of horrific\nviolence and abuse, often suffering grave and lasting psychological\nharm as a result (Roberts 2019). It is unclear how such harms to the\ncontent moderating workforce can be morally justified, even if they\nhelp to prevent the spread of such harm to others. The arrangement has\nuncomfortable echoes of Ursula LeGuin\u2019s The Ones Who Walk\nAway From Omelas; so should platform users be the ones walking\naway? Or do platforms have an ethical duty to find a morally\npermissible solution, even if it endangers their business model?\n\nAnother emerging ethical concern is the increasingly political\ncharacter of cyberharassment and cyberstalking. In the U.S., women who\nspoke out about the lack of diversity in the tech and videogame\nindustries were early targets during online controversies such as\n2014\u2019s \u2018Gamergate\u2019 (Salter 2017), during which some\nvictims were forced to cancel speaking appearances or leave their\nhomes due to physical threats after their addresses and other personal\ninfo were posted on social media (a practice known as\n\u2018doxing\u2019 or \u2018doxxing\u2019). More recently,\njournalists have been doxed and subjected to violent threats,\nsometimes following accusations that their reporting itself\nconstituted doxing (Wilson 2018).\n\nDoxing presents complex ethical challenges (Douglas 2016). For victims\nof doxing and associated cyberthreats, traditional law enforcement\nbodies offer scant protection, as these agencies are often\nill-equipped to police the blurry boundary between online and physical\nharms. But moreover, it\u2019s not always clear what distinguishes\nimmoral doxing from justified social opprobrium. If someone records a\nwoman spitting racial epithets in a passerby\u2019s face, or a man\ndenying a disabled person service in a restaurant, and the victim or\nan observer posts the video online in a manner that allows the\nperpetrator to be identified by others in their social network, is\nthat unethical shaming or just deserts? What\u2019s the difference\nbetween posting someone\u2019s home address, allowing them and their\nfamily to be terrorized by a mob, and posting someone\u2019s\nworkplace so that their employer can consider their conduct? Cases\nsuch as these get adjudicated by ad hoc social media juries\nweekly. Sometimes legal consequences do follow, as in the case of the\nnotorious Amy Cooper, who in 2020 was charged with filing a false\npolice report after being filmed by a Black man who she falsely\naccused of threatening her in Central Park. Are doxing and other modes\nof social media shaming legitimate tools of justice? Or are they\nindications of the dangers of unregulated moral policing? And if the\nanswer is \u2018both,\u2019 or \u2018it depends,\u2019 then what\nare the key moral distinctions that allow us to respond appropriately\nto this new practice?\n",
