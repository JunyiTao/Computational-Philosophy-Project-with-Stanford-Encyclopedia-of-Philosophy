    "main_text": "Maimonidean Critique?\n7. Maimonidean Critique?\n\n Following on many of the above considerations about the grounding of\nreason in revelation, and struck more generally by what might be\ndescribed as a \u2018faith-seeks-understanding\u2019 methodology,\none may legitimately ask: In spite of his own defense of, call for and\nengagement with reason, is reason really the hallmark of Saadya's\nworld-view? To see how one might answer \u201cno\u201d to this\nquestion, consider the writings of Moses Maimonides (a later Jewish\nmedieval philosopher). For Maimonides, Saadya's speculative\ntheological reasoning might easily be seen as\nreasoning-in-the-service-of-pre-established-ideas (in this case,\ntheological commitments).  This sort of \u2018reasoning\u2019 is\nprecisely the sort of thing that Maimonides (in the extended critique\nof Kalam which he offers in his Guide of the Perplexed)\nlambastes as a fanciful, non-philosophical mode of\npseudo-reasoning. To the extent that Saadya's work falls prey to\nMaimonides' critique of Kal\u00e2m theology, it would not, properly\nspeaking, be a truly reason-based system. While Saadya states that\n\u201cthe truth of reliable tradition\u201d is \u201cbased on the\nknowledge of sense perception and the knowledge of reason\u201d\n(Altmann, 37), there are serious grounds for suggesting, nonetheless,\nthat for Saadya, it is tradition and revelation, and the presence of\nGod in man's life that these entail, which are ultimately the first\nfoundations for knowing and living. The centrality of reason\nnotwithstanding, revelation may ultimately be Saadya's final\nground.\n",
