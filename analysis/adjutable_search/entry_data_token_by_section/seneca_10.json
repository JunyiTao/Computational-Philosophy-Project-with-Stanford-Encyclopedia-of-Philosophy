    "main_text": "Physics and Theology || The Natural Law\n5.2 The Natural Law\n\nThe Stoics are considered ancestors of the natural law tradition. The\nstandard epithet of the law, in early Stoicism, is\n\u2018common\u2019 (koinos), not \u2018natural\u2019.\nSeneca, however, characterizes laws or the law as natural and talks of\nthe lex naturae (\u201claw of nature\u201d). Early Stoic\nthought about the law is partly rooted in the theory of appropriate\naction, and partly in a physical account of how\nreason\u2014Zeus\u2014pervades the world.\n\nIt is this physical notion of the law that is most prominent in\nSeneca. In his discussion of earthquakes and human fear, Seneca points\nout that we err by assuming that in some places, there is no danger of\nearthquakes; all places are subject to the same law (lex)\n(6.1.12). In another context, Seneca points out that the natural laws\n(iura) govern events under the earth as much as above\n(3.16.4). The world is constituted so that everything that is going to\nhappen, including the conflagration of the world when it comes to an\nend, is from the very beginning part of it. Natural events like\nearthquakes, and in fact all events, help nature go through with the\nnatural statutes (naturae constituta) (3.29.4). Since nature\n(or Zeus) decided in the beginning what was going to happen,\neverything is easy for nature (3.30.1). The study of nature aims at\naccepting facts of nature, first and foremost the fact that human\nbeings are mortal. Seneca refers to the necessity of death as a\nnatural law (NQ 6.32.12: mors naturae lex est).\nDeath is a \u201cdone deal\u201d already at conception (On Peace\nof Mind 11.6; cf. NQ 2.59.6). It is the task of science\nto understand why death need not be feared, that the philosophical\nlife is particularly indispensable because it prepares us for death,\nand that the kinds of death that we are prone to fear particularly,\nsuch as death through an earthquake, are really not much different\nfrom more usual kinds of death. To be free according to the law of\nnature is to be prepared to die any minute (3.16). That we are all\nequals in death reflects the justice of nature (6.1.8).\n\nA theme that is equally present in Seneca\u2019s natural philosophy\nand in his therapeutic practice is time. Book 3 of the\nNatural Questions is entitled On the waters of the\nearth and begins with reflections on the enormous time which the\ntask of natural philosophy may consume; on time that has been wasted\nwith worldly concerns; and the claim that it can be regained if we\nmake diligent use of the present. The fact that human life is finite\nis thus present from the very first lines of the book. Seneca then\nturns to the way in which the world\u2019s life-cycle is as finite as\nthat of a human being. Just as a human foetus already contains the\nseed of its death, the beginnings of the world contain its end\n(3.28.2\u20133). It is precisely for this reason that things are easy\nfor nature. Its death does not, as it were, come as a\nsurprise\u2014nature is well-prepared. Nature does what it initially\ndetermined; nothing in nature\u2019s doings is ad hoc\n(3.30.1). Seneca points to examples: Look at the way the waves roll\nonto the beaches; the oceans are trained in how to flood the earth\n(3.30.2). The world\u2019s preparedness for its death seems to be the\nperfect analogue of how, for Seneca, we ought to spend our lives. In\nLetter 12.6\u20138, Seneca says that everything, light\nand darkness, is contained in a single day. To use the\npresent well is to be aware of this completeness. More days, and\nmonths, and years, will (or at least may) make up our lives. But we\nshould not think of them as stretching out into the future; rather,\nthey are concentric circles surrounding the day which, right now, is\npresent. And since even this very day stretches out, from its\nbeginning to its end, we can appreciate it as containing\neverything\u2014there can be more such days, but they will be more of\nthe same. Thus, on every such day, if it is lived well, we can be\nfully prepared to die.\n",
