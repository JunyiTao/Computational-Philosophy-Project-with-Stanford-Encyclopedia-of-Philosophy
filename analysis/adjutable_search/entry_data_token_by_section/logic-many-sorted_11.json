    "main_text": "Many-sorted Logic as a Unifying Framework || General Plan\n3.3 General Plan\n\nThe general plan is as follows: The signature of the logic being\nstudied (call it \\(\\XL\\)) is transformed into a many-sorted signature,\nthe expressions of the logic \\(\\XL\\) are translated into\n\\(\\MSL^{\\XL}\\) (a many-sorted language suited for \\(\\XL\\)) and the\nstructures of the logic \\(\\XL\\) are converted into many-sorted\nstructures. Thus, we need to define a recursive function \\(\\Trans\\) to\ndo the translation and a direct conversion of structures,\n\\(\\Conv_{1}.\\)\n\nWith the direct conversion of structures we want to obtain as a result\nthe equivalence of validity in the original structures for \\(\\XL\\),\ncall them simply \\(\\Str(\\XL)\\), with validity of a certain class of\nmany-sorted formulas (the translations) in the class\n\\(\\mathfrak{S}^{\\ast}\\) of converted structures (where\n\\(\\mathfrak{S}^{\\ast}=\\Conv_{1}(\\Str(\\XL))\\)).\n\nNext question to ask is whether or not \\(\\mathfrak{S}^{\\ast}\\) can be\nreplaced by the models of a set \\(\\Delta\\) of many-sorted formulas.\nThus, the key to both definitions, \\(\\Trans\\) and \\(\\Conv_{1}\\), is to\nsimplify the proof of the semantic equivalence, and in this respect\nthe relevance of the results obtained strongly depends on the\npossibility of axiomatizing \\(\\mathfrak{S}^{\\ast}\\). In case you get\nsuch a recursive set of formulas of \\(\\MSL^{\\XL}\\), say \\(\\Delta\\),\n(or at least such that \\(\\mathfrak{S}^{\\ast}\\subseteq \\Mod(\\Delta )\\))\nwe should prove that validity in \\(\\XL\\) is equivalent to consequence\nfrom \\(\\Delta\\) in \\(\\MSL^{\\XL}\\).\n\nIn case you get the set \\(\\Delta\\), a reverse conversion of\nstructures, \\(\\Conv_{2}\\), should be defined. And so, from many-sorted\nmodels of \\(\\Delta\\) we get structures in \\(\\Str(\\XL)\\). Our goal in\ndefining it is to prove that starting from a many-sorted structure\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) (a model of \\(\\Delta\\)), a formula \\(\\varphi\\) of\n\\(\\XL\\) is true in \\(\\Conv_{2}(\\mathcal{B)}\\) if and only if the\nuniversal closure of its translation is true at \\(\\mathcal{B}\\).\n",
