    "main_text": "Extensions and Elaborations || Cumulative Culture\n6.2 Cumulative Culture\n\nOther work done by cultural evolutionary researchers begins from\nconsiderations of explanatory puzzles similar to those that led Darwin\nto formulate his principle of natural selection in the first place.\nDarwin was concerned to explain how structures could arise which fit\norganisms so remarkably well to their conditions of existence.\nCultural evolutionists frequently draw attention to a variety of\nadaptive cultural traits, whose origination seems inexplicable in\nterms of individual innovation alone.\n\nHenrich (2016: 97\u2013100), for example, makes good use of the\nexample of manioc processing. Manioc (also called cassava) is a good\nsource of starch, but it needs to be processed to make it safe to eat.\nWithout this processing it can release poisonous hydrogen cyanide.\nAccording to Henrich, while unprocessed manioc tastes bitter, the\nbitter taste is not a good indicator of its safety: bitterness\ndisappears in the preparation process before manioc becomes safe to\neat. Worse, while unprocessed manioc is poisonous, it is hard to\ndiscover that this is the case, because the symptoms of poisoning only\nappear well after eating unsafe manioc. Henrich argues that it is hard\nto see how any single insightful individual could have invented this\nprocessing technology. Instead, he argues that a more gradual process\nof cumulative cultural adaptation, spread across the\npopulation\u2014a form of \u201chidden hand explanation\u201d\nmodeled on organic selection\u2014must be invoked.\n\nThe prevailing metaphor used to describe this process of cumulative\ncultural adaptation is that of a ratchet. Cultural traditions must be\nbuilt-upon\u2014and must not \u201cslip-back\u201d over\ntime\u2014if such adaptive traits are to be generated, maintained and\nfurther elaborated (Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner 1993; Tomasello\n1999). In fact, such \u201cincremental improvement\u201d is taken to\nbe a \u201ccore criterion\u201d of what is simply called\n\u201ccumulative culture\u201d (Mesoudi & Thornton 2018).\n\nTwo features of this characterization of cumulative culture have\nexercised commentators. The first is the \u201clumped\u201d\ncharacter of the cumulative culture concept: the concept encompasses a\nset of evolutionary patterns, processes, and products that might\nbetter be kept distinct. Buskell (2022) for instance, suggests that\nthe underlying process of accumulation\u2014the ratchet-like\nretention of modifications made to traits over time\u2014should be\ndistinguished from the cultural evolutionary patterns (or\n\u201ctrends\u201d) typically associated with it; notably, the\ncomplexity, adaptiveness, or efficacy typically associated with\ncumulative culture. This preserves the \u201cratchet\u201d of\nmodification and retention, but distinguishes it from\n\u201cincremental improvement\u201d, opening up the possibility of\ngenerating both maladaptive and neutral traits. Just\nas copying errors or mutation may lead to deleterious or neutral forms\nof traits being passed on over time\u2014so too might cumulative\nculture.\n\nA second set of concerns considers which features of cumulative\nculture, if any, mark it out as a distinctive kind of cultural\nevolutionary process. It is usual to express the ratcheting\nrequirement in terms of the need for high-fidelity in social learning.\nThis, in turn, is most obviously spelled out as a requirement for a\ntoken of a trait in a learner to faithfully resemble the token of the\nsame trait in the model. But it is not clear what \u201cgrain\u201d\nof analysis should be chosen when determining resemblance (Charbonneau\n2020; Charbonneau & Bourrat 2021). Suppose Andrew sings a line\nfrom a song, and Tim attempts to copy him: does \u201chigh\nfidelity\u201d learning require Tim to reproduce the same melody,\nmust he sing in the same key, must he sing with the same words, and\nthe same emotional emphases? Note that this also raises the linked\nquestion of what it takes for two tokens to be of the same trait type.\nIf Tim sings with different words and in a different key, are we\ndealing with tokens of the same, or a different trait type? There is\nplausibly value to the investigator in distinguishing different types\nof modification, rather than using a single \u201chi-fi/lo-fi\u201d\ndimension. For example, one may wish to distinguish rearranging or\nmultiplying the elements involved in some complex behavior, from\naltering the nature of those elements themselves (Charbonneau 2016;\nBuskell 2020).\n\nLast are concerns about identifying instances of cumulative culture.\nWork in comparative cognition shows that culture is widespread among\nnon-human animals. Yet evidence for cumulative culture is contentious.\nTennie, Call, and Tomasello (2009: 2413) have argued that\n\n\nthe cultural traditions of non-human primate species\u2026do not\nseem to accumulate modifications over time with any kind of ratchet\neffect.\n\n\nTheir view is that behavioral solutions in chimpanzees, for example,\nare always drawn from a limited repertoire\u2014what Tennie and\ncolleagues (2009) call a zone of latent solutions\n(ZLS)\u2014which contains only solutions that an individual\nmight potentially discover by itself. This does not mean that there is\nno element of accumulation in primate culture: Tennie et al note that\nan individual primate may be assisted in acquiring some behavior by\nthe performances of others, and by the use of discarded tools. There\nis, then, scope for limited building on the achievements of earlier\nindividuals. Even so, they suggest the ZLS places strong limits on\ncultural accumulation in these contexts. Regardless of whether the ZLS\napproach is a good means of evaluating the cultural capacities of\nanimals, the prevalence of animal cultural traits and the evolutionary\nrole of cumulative culture have been hotly disputed (Schuppli &\nvan Schaik 2019; Haidle & Schaludt 2020; Sterelny 2021b). If\nnothing else, this work suggests that identifying instances of\ncumulative culture among non-human animals is a difficult empirical\nissue.\n",
