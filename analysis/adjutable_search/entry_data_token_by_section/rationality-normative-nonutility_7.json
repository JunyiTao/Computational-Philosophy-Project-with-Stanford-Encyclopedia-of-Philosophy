    "main_text": "Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity || The Challenge from Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity\n4.1 The Challenge from Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity\n\nA third challenge to expected utility maximization holds that\nsubjective probabilities need not be \u201csharp\u201d or\n\u201cprecise\u201d, i.e., need not be a single, point-wise\nfunction. (In economics, this phenomenon is typically called\nambiguity.) There are three historically significant\nmotivations for imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe first is that decision makers treat subjective (or unknown)\nprobabilities differently from objective probabilities in their\ndecision-making behavior. The classic example of this is the Ellsberg\nParadox (Ellsberg 1961, 2001). Imagine you face an urn filled with 90\nballs that are red, black, and yellow, from which a single ball will\nbe drawn. You know that 30 of the balls are red, but you know nothing\nabout the proportion of black and yellow balls. Do you prefer \\(f_1\\)\nor \\(f_2\\); and do you prefer \\(f_3\\) or \\(f_4\\)?\n\n\\(f_1\\): $100 if the ball is red; $0 if the ball is black or\nyellow.\n\\(f_2\\): $100 if the ball is black; $0 if the ball is red or\nyellow.\n\\(f_3\\): $100 if the ball is red or yellow; $0 if the ball is\nblack.\n\\(f_4\\): $100 if the ball is black or yellow; $0 if the ball is\nred.\n\n\nMost people appear to (strictly) prefer \\(f_1\\) to \\(f_2\\) and\n(strictly) prefer \\(f_4\\) to \\(f_3.\\) They would rather bet on the\nknown or objective probability than the unknown or subjective\none\u2014in the first pair, red has an\nobjective probability of \\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\), whereas black\nhas a possible objective probability ranging\nfrom 0 to \\(\\lfrac{2}{3}\\); in the second pair, black\nor yellow has an objective probability of \\(\\lfrac{2}{3}\\)\nwhereas red or yellow has a possible objective\nprobability ranging from \\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\) to 1. These preferences\nviolate the Sure-thing Principle. (To see this, notice that the only\ndifference between the two pairs of acts is that the first pair yields\n$0 on yellow and the second pair yields $100\non yellow.)\n\nThe second motivation for imprecise probability is that even if all\nthe relevant probabilities are subjective, a decision-maker\u2019s\nbetting behavior might depend on how reliable or well-supported by\nevidence those probabilities are. Consider a decision-maker who may\nbet on three different tennis matches: in the first, she knows a lot\nabout the players and knows they are very evenly matched; in the\nsecond, she knows nothing whatsoever about either player; and in the\nthird, she knows that one of the two players is much better than the\nother, but she does not know which one. In each of the matches, the\ndecision-maker should presumably assign equal probability to each\nplayer winning, since her information in favor of each is symmetrical;\nnonetheless, it seems rational to bet only on the first match and not\non the other two (G\u00e4rdenfors & Sahlin 1982; see also Ellsberg\n1961).\n\nA final motivation for imprecise probability is that evidence\ndoesn\u2019t always determine precise probabilities (Levi 1974, 1983;\nWalley 1991; Joyce 2005;\nSturgeon 2008; White\n2009; Elga 2010). Assume a stranger approaches you and pulls three\nitems out of a bag: a regular-sized tube of toothpaste, a live\njellyfish, and a travel-sized tube of toothpaste; you are asked to\nassign probability to the proposition that the next item he pulls out\nwill be another tube of toothpaste\u2014but it seems that you lack\nenough evidence to do so (Elga 2010).\n",
