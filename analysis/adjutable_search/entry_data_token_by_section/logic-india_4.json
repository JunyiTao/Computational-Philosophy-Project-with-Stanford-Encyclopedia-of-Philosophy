    "main_text": "Preclassical Period || Milinda-pa\u00f1ha\n2.3 Milinda-pa\u00f1ha\n\nMilinda-pa\u00f1ha (Questions of King Milinda),\nunlike the Kath\u0101-vatthu which comprises an argumentative\nexchange adhering to identifiable patterns, comprises a dialogue\nbetween the Greek Bactrian king, Menander (P\u0101li: Milinda), and an\notherwise unknown Buddhist monk, N\u0101gasena (von Hin\u00fcber,\n1996, III.4). The text is an exposition of Buddhist doctrine and\npractice, cast in terms of questions put by King Milinda to the monk\nN\u0101gasena and the latter\u2019s answers. Though there is some\nargumentation, for the most part, the text is expository, where the\nexposition is done almost entirely through analogy, sometimes very\nelaborate ones. For example, Book 5, entitled \u2018the problem of\ninference\u2019, which has almost nothing to do with inference, sets\nout an elaborate analogy between a great city and its various parts,\non the one hand, and the Buddha\u2019s teaching and its various\nparts, on the other. The pretext for this expository analogy is an\nargument put to N\u0101gasena by King Milinda. King Milinda asks\nwhether N\u0101gasena or his teachers has seen the Buddha.\nN\u0101gasena replies that neither he nor his teachers has. King\nMilinda concludes, then, that the Buddha did not exist. N\u0101gasena\nreplies by making a similar argument whose premiss King Milinda\naccepts but whose conclusion he rejects. King Milinda admits that\nneither he nor those who have taught him has seen the founders of his\nkingly lineage, yet he believes that the founder of his lineage\nexisted. (Bk. 5, sec. 2) Then King Milinda replies that he has\nevidence for belief in the existence of a founder, the existence of\nthe royal insignia. N\u0101gasena then counters that he too has\nevidence for the existence of the Buddha, namely, his various\ndoctrines, metaphorically the royal insignia of the Buddha. (Bk. 5,\nsec. 3) In short, just as one infers the existence of a founder of a\nlineage from the legacy of his royal insignia, so one infers the\nexistence of the Buddha from the legacy of his teachings.\nN\u0101gasena then turns to a similar argument which serves as a\npretext to elaborate various aspects of the Buddha\u2019s teaching:\njust as one can infer from a well planned city the fact that it had a\ndesigner, so one can infer from the well ordered doctrines of the\nBuddha that the Buddha existed. Over the ensuing 20 sections,\nN\u0101gasena first enumerates various features of the city and then\nelaborates on aspects of Buddhist doctrines put in correspondence with\nthem. The final section ends with eight arguments, each paired through\nanalogy with an argument pertaining to features of Buddhist thought\nand the existence or features of the Buddha. (1) From the greatness of\nthe city one infers the greatness of the architect. (2) From the\ngreatness of the waves, one infers the greatness of the ocean; (3)\nFrom seeing the peaks of mountains from afar, one infers the height of\nthe mountains; (4) From the greatness of an elephant\u2019s\nfootprint, one infers the size of the elephant; (5) From seeing\ncreatures crouching in fear, one infers that a lion has roared; (6)\nFrom the luxuriance of the vegetation, one infers the ampleness of\nrainfall; (7) From the marshiness of the earth, one infers the excess\nof rainfall; (8) From the scent in the air, one infers that flowers\nare in bloom. Each of these arguments has the form of what is dubbed\nto be the pram\u0101\u1e47a, the means of epistemic\ncognition, known as anum\u0101na, or inference.\n\nOne important principle of logic is presupposed in the dialogue: the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. It is presupposed in a variety of\nplaces throughout the text, but it is particularly in evidence in Book\n4, which is entitled \u2018Solving the dilemmas\u2019. The book\nconsists of dilemmas put to N\u0101gasena by King Milinda. Many of\nthem are pairs of apparently inconsistent statements or practices\ninconsistent with doctrine. They correspond to the following schema in\npropositional logic: \\(p \\land q,\\) \\(p \\to \\neg q,\\) \\(q \\to \\neg\np.\\) One particularly clear instance occurs in section 6 of Chapter 2.\nThere King Milinda says:\n\n\nIf the Blessed one, N\u0101gasena, really said that all men tremble at\npunishment and all are afraid of death, then the statement that the\nArhat has passed beyond fear must be false. But if that last statement\nis really by him, then the other must be false. (T. W. Rhys Davids\n1980.)\n\n\nN\u0101gasena\u2019s response is to point out, in effect, that the\nintended meaning is different from the literal meaning. He gives\nseveral examples of sentences in which the word all occurs but where\nall in not intended to include everyone in what we today call the\ndomain of discourse. He points out (in section 8) that a king might\ntell his four ministers that all must pay taxes, but the king does not\nintend that the ministers are included by all, ministers being free\nfrom the burden of taxation. In another example (section 9), he points\nout that a village headman may tell the village crier to bring\ntogether all the villagers, but in fact, what he intends is that only\nall the heads of households gather.\n",
