    "main_text": "The Soul and the Order of Nature\n3. The Soul and the Order of Nature\n\nOne of the most complex questions in Cardano\u2019s philosophy as a\nwhole concerns the relationship between nature and the soul. This is a\npoint where Cardano\u2019s multiple allegiances (scholastic\nAristotelianism, Plotinian Platonism, medicine and astrology) come to\nthe fore. Inevitably, it is also an area where not a few frictions\namong different traditions come to the fore. Among Cardano\u2019s\ndesiderata there was the plan to devote a specific philosophical\ntreatise to the notion of nature. It is an unfinished work that in all\nlikelihood he sketched at the beginning of the 1560s, De natura\nliber unicus. It can be seen as part of a series of treatises\ndevoted to the exploration of the most recondite aspects of the\nnatural, supernatural and moral worlds (De libris propriis,\nOO, I, 119; ed. Maclean, 293). De natura demonstrates\nCardano\u2019s lifelong engagement with notions of naturalism,\nuniversal animation, and teleology. The discussion is opaque at times\nbecause of the topic\u2019s difficulty, the characteristic obscurity\nof Cardano\u2019s disjointed and elliptical writing, and the\nprecarious condition of the text, left unfinished, with several gaps\nand marks of typographical sloppiness (typos, mistakes, and missing\nwords). On the other hand, being a monographic treatment of the\nmeaning of nature, the treatise holds great significance, all the more\nso because, as Cardano explains, the investigation of nature\n(inquisitio naturae) sheds light on the very origin of\nthings, including human beings (De natura, OO, II, 283a). In\nthis sense, fragmentary as it may be, Cardano\u2019s De\nnatura is an attempt to outline the ultimate principles of\nreality (on the relationship between natural and supernatural\nphenomena in Cardano, see Siraisi 1997, 149\u2013173).\n\nCardano\u2019s notion of order has strong Platonic overtones. Unity\nis a mark of perfection, for all things rejoice in unity and they are\nin a better condition when they reach that level of unity that\nactualizes their potential nature. Unity gives structure and purpose\nto all the elements that make up the system of nature: \u201corder\nand fate, since they are one, and exist with respect to the One, are\ngood; disorder and luck are bad, for they do not strive towards\nunity\u201d (De uno, OO, I, 277b; ed. Garc\u00eda\nValverde, 4). As an expression of unity and goodness, order is so\npervasive that in fact accounts for even the most haphazard and\ndisorderly aspects of reality. Cardano maintains that multiplicity and\ndiversity can always be brought back to potentially ordered series of\nindividual elements (multitudo ordinata) (De uno,\nOO, I, 281ab; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde, 24; De natura, OO,\nII, 283a). What we perceive as beauty (decus) and elegance\n(ornamentum) in nature is not due to scattered variety\n(multitudo), but to a principle of ordered unity, \u201cthe\none in the many,\u201d which produces feelings of harmony and\nsymmetry in us (De uno, OO, 280a; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde,\n20). The same principle of order and unity applies to knowledge: we\ncan say that we really know something when we manage to relate all the\naspects and properties of this thing to one cause. According to\nCardano, Plotinus followed the same approach in moral philosophy, for\nhe described his notion of happiness as a return to the One (De\nuno, OO, I, 281b; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde, 24).\n\nAmong the sources of unity and order in the universe, souls play a\nmost significant role. As we have seen in the previous section, souls\nare at the center of Cardano\u2019s cosmos. Being immaterial, they\nare \u201ca unitary principle that is not continuous, nor contiguous,\nbut exists of its own, not in a place, nor in a time.\u201d Unlike\nlife (vita), which is diffused everywhere and therefore\ncannot be said to be a real principium, souls have no spatial\nand temporal limitation and are nowhere (nullibi) to be found\nbecause of their incorporeal nature (De uno, OO, I, 279a;\nGarc\u00eda Valverde, 12). While souls are one and individual\neverywhere (\u201cour soul is no less here than in the sky, no less\nin Italy than in India\u201d), bodies are different and manifold\ndepending on material circumstances and vital urges, for\n\u201cdivision of bodies is determined by the needs of life\n(vitae commodum)\u201d (Paralipomenon, OO, X,\n446a). Given the central role assigned to the soul, in all its forms,\nCardano\u2019s philosophy of nature is inevitably exposed to charges\nof animism and anthropomorphism. The issue is accentuated by the fact\nthat the human being represents for Cardano a model of rationality and\nteleological activity.\n\nFor Cardano, human souls are individual principles of self-awareness.\nSelfhood is the principal argument in favour of their immortality.\nHowever, in defending the immortal character of human souls, Cardano\nalso relies on proofs of a more pragmatic and theological nature. Hope\nin \u201cthe immortality of the soul\u201d was implanted in human\nbeings by God, therefore it cannot be considered as a deluded\nexpectation. In common people God instilled this hope \u201cthrough\nreligions (leges),\u201d in wise people, \u201cthrough the\nhidden truths (arcana) of philosophy.\u201d However, when\nGod provided human beings with hope for immortal life, He decided to\ngive them a feeble certainty, always in need of confirmation. The\nreason, according to Cardano, is that a firm belief in the immortality\nof the soul would have created too wide a gap between humans and\nanimals, while leading man into arrogant delusions of grandeur. There\nhas always been and \u2013 \u201cas long as there is a world\u201d\n\u2013 there always will be an alternation (vicissitudo) of\nconfirmations and doubts concerning the immortality of the soul. It is\na \u201cvicissitude\u201d of hopes and despair that is part of the\nprovidential regime of the world established by God (De utilitate\nex adversis capienda, OO, II, 26a). Hope in the immortality of\nthe soul is also a fundamental postulate in Cardano\u2019s moral\nphilosophy. As we will see in the next section, Cardano maintains that\ntrue inner tranquillity depends, among other things, on virtue,\nwisdom, and \u201chope in the gods.\u201d Otherwise, what is passed\noff as tranquillity is in fact mere harshness and stiffness\n(duritia) (Theonoston, OO, II, 303b, 305b, 308a,\n312a).\n",
