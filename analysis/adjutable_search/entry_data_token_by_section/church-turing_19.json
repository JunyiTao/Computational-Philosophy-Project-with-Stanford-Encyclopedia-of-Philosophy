G\u00f6del\nsuggested that\n\n\nit might be possible, in terms of effective calculability as an\nundefined notion, to state a set of axioms which would embody the\ngenerally accepted properties of this notion, and to do something on\nthat basis. (Church 1935b)\n\n\nLogicians frequently analyse a concept of interest, e.g., universal\nquantification, not by defining it in terms of other concepts, but by\nstating a set of axioms that collectively embody the generally\naccepted properties of (say) universal quantification. To follow this\napproach in the case of effectiveness, we would \u201cwrite down some\naxioms about computable functions which most people would agree are\nevidently true\u201d (Shoenfield 1993: 26). Shoenfield continued,\n\u201cIt might be possible to prove Church\u2019s Thesis from such\naxioms\u201d, but added: \u201cHowever, despite strenuous efforts,\nno one has succeeded in doing this\u201d.\n\nMoving on a few years, a meeting on The Prospects for Mathematical\nLogic in the Twenty-First Century, held at the turn of the\nmillennium, included the following among leading open problems:\n\n\n\u201cProve\u201d the Church-Turing thesis by finding intuitively\nobvious or at least clearly acceptable properties of computation that\nsuffice to guarantee that any function so computed is recursive [and\ntherefore can be computed by a Turing machine]. (Shore in Buss et al.\n2001: 174\u2013175)\n\n\nThe axiomatic type of approach sketched by G\u00f6del has by now been\ndeveloped in a number of quite different ways. These axiomatic\nframeworks go a long way toward countering Montague\u2019s complaint\nof over 60 years ago that \u201cDiscussion of Church\u2019s thesis\nhas suffered for lack of a precise general framework within which it\ncould be conducted\u201d (Montague 1960: 432). Some examples of the\naxiomatic approach are as follows (in chronological order):\n\n\n\nGandy (Turing\u2019s only PhD student) pointed out that\nTuring\u2019s analysis of human computation does not immediately\napply to computing machines strongly dissimilar from Turing machines.\n(See\n Section 4.3\n below for details of Turing\u2019s analysis.) For example,\nTuring\u2019s analysis does not obviously apply to parallel machines\nwhich, unlike a Turing machine, are able to process an arbitrary\nnumber of symbols simultaneously. Seeking a generalized form of\nTuring\u2019s analysis that applies equally well to Turing machines\nand massively parallel machines, Gandy (1980) stated four axioms\ngoverning the behaviour of what he called discrete deterministic\nmechanical devices. (He formulated the axioms in terms of\nhereditarily finite sets.) Gandy was then able to prove that every\ndevice satisfying these axioms can be simulated by a Turing machine:\nDiscrete deterministic mechanical devices, even massively parallel\nones, are no more powerful than Turing machines, in the sense that\nwhatever computations such a device is able to perform can also be\ndone by the universal Turing machine. (For more on Gandy\u2019s\nanalysis, see\n Section 6.4.2.)\n\n\n\nEngeler axiomatized the concept of an algorithmic function by using\ncombinators (Engeler 1983: ch. III). Combinators were\noriginally introduced by Sch\u00f6nfinkel in 1924, in a paper that a\nrecent book on combinators described as \u201cpresenting a formalism\nfor universal computation for the very first time\u201d\n(Sch\u00f6nfinkel 1924; Wolfram 2021: 214). Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s\ncombinators were extensively developed by Curry (Curry 1929, 1930a,b,\n1932; Curry & Feys 1958). Examples of combinators are the\n\u201cpermutator\u201d \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) and the\n\u201ccancellator\u201d \\(\\mathrm{K}\\). These produce the following\neffects: \\(\\mathrm{C}xyz = xzy\\) and \\(\\mathrm{K}xy = x\\). \n\n\nSieg formalized Turing\u2019s analysis of human computation by means\nof four axioms (Sieg 2008). The result, Sieg said, is an axiomatic\ncharacterization of \u201cthe concept \u2018mechanical\nprocedure\u2019\u201d, and he observed that his system\n\u201csubstantiates G\u00f6del\u2019s remarks\u201d (above) that\none should try to find a set of axioms embodying the generally\naccepted properties of the concept of effectiveness (Sieg 2008:\n150). \n\n\nDershowitz and Gurevich (2008) stated three very general axioms,\ntreating computations as discrete, deterministic,\nsequentially-evolving structures of states. They called these\nstructures \u201cstate-transition systems\u201d, and called the\nthree axioms the \u201cSequential Postulates\u201d. They also used a\nfourth axiom, stipulating that \u201cOnly undeniably computable\noperations are available in initial states\u201d (2008: 306). From\ntheir four axioms, they proved a proposition they called\nChurch\u2019s thesis: \u201cEvery numeric function computed by a\nstate-transition system satisfying the Sequential Postulates, and\nprovided initially with only basic arithmetic, is partial\nrecursive\u201d (2008: 327). \n\n\nReturning to the very idea of proving the Church-Turing\nthesis, it is important to note that the proposition Dershowitz and\nGurevich call Church\u2019s thesis is in fact not the thesis\nstated by Church, viz. \u201cA function of positive integers is\neffectively calculable only if recursive\u201d. Crucially, their\nversion of Church\u2019s thesis does not even mention the key concept\nof effective calculability. The entire project of trying to prove\nChurch\u2019s (or Turing\u2019s) actual thesis has its share of\nphilosophical difficulties. For example, suppose someone were to lay\ndown some axioms expressing claims about effective calculability (as\nSieg for instance has done), and suppose it is possible to prove from\nthese axioms that a function of positive integers is effectively\ncalculable only if recursive. Church\u2019s thesis would have been\nproved from the axioms, but whether the axioms form a satisfactory\naccount of effective calculability is a further question. If\nthey do not, then this \u201cproof\u201d of Church\u2019s thesis\ncould carry no conviction. Which is to say, a proof of this sort will\nbe convincing only to one who accepts another thesis, namely that the\naxioms are indeed a satisfactory account of effective calculability.\nThis is a Churchian meta-thesis. Church\u2019s thesis would have been\nproved, but only at the expense of throwing up another, unproved,\nthesis seemingly of the same nature.\n\nThere is further discussion of difficulties associated with the idea\nof proving the Church-Turing thesis in\n Section 4.3.5,\n Section 4.5, and\n Section 4.6.\n",
