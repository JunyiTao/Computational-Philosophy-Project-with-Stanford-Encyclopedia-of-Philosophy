    "main_text": "The Structural Equations Framework || Models and Reality\n5.3 Models and Reality\n\nIt is a general feature of the SEF approach that the model need not\ninclude as variables all of the factors that are relevant to the\neffect under consideration (and indeed no model never does \u2013\nthere are just too many factors). In the Billy/Suzy model above, for\nexample, there are no variables describing the actual and possible\nstates corresponding to causal intermediaries between Billy\u2019s or\nSuzy\u2019s throwing (or not throwing) and their respective rocks\nhitting (or not hitting) the bottle. So what determines which\nvariables should and should not be included in the model in order to\nuncover the causal relationships between the variables we\u2019re\ninterested in?\n\nIt\u2019s important to stress that there is no uniquely correct model\nto be had for any given situation. A model that, for example,\ninterpolated large numbers of intermediaries between Suzy\u2019s\nthrow and her rock\u2019s hitting the bottle would reveal more of the\ncausal structure of both the actual situation and various different\ncounterfactual alternatives. But that doesn\u2019t make it the\n\u2018right\u2019 model for considering the causal status of\nBilly\u2019s and Suzy\u2019s respective throws with respect to the\nshattering of the bottle. Such a model would deliver the same result\nas the simple one described above, and so the additional variables\nwould simply be an unnecessary complication. On the other hand, there\nare limits on what we can leave out. For example, a causal model that\njust included ST and BS as variables would not deliver\nthe result that Suzy\u2019s throw caused the bottle to shatter, since\nthat counterfactual is not true on this model. (To get it to come out\ntrue, we need to include BH and hold it fixed at its actual\nvalue, BH = 0.)\n\nSo what are the constraints on causal models, such that they\naccurately represent the causal facts that we\u2019re interested in\n(Halpern and Hitchcock 2010: \u00a7\u00a74\u20135)? Various authors\nhave proposed constraints that tell us what count as (to use\nHitchcock\u2019s term) \u2018apt\u2019 models, many of which are\nanalogues of Lewis\u2019s constraints and for the same reasons,\nnamely to ensure that there is no spurious counterfactual dependence.\nThus Hitchcock (2001: 287) proposes that the values of variables\nshould not represent events that bear logical or metaphysical\nrelations to one another, and Blanchard and Schaffer (2017: 182)\npropose that the values allotted should represent intrinsic\ncharacterisations. Hitchcock (2001: 287) also proposes that the\nvariables should not be allotted values \u2018that one is not willing\nto take seriously\u2019 (about which more below). Halpern and\nHitchcock (2010) add a \u2018stability\u2019 constraint: adding\nadditional variables should not overturn the causal verdicts. (This\nconstraint addresses the problem of the \u2018model\u2019 described\nabove that just includes ST and BS; that model delivers\na verdict, namely that Suzy\u2019s throw doesn\u2019t cause the\nbottle to shatter, which is overturned by adding additional\nvariables.) And Hitchcock (2007: 503) proposes the constraint that the\nmodel \u201cshould include enough variables to capture the essential\nstructure of the situation being modeled\u201d. (Though if one had\nreductionist aspirations, this constraint would appear to render\none\u2019s analysis of causation viciously circular, since the\n\u2018essential structure\u2019 of the situation is presumably its\nessential causal structure \u2013 just what a causal model is\nsupposed to deliver.)\n\nPrecisely what the constraints should be on \u2018apt\u2019 or\n\u2018appropriate\u2019 models is a matter of ongoing philosophical\ndebate (Blanchard and Schaffer 2017: \u00a71.3). The focus here is on\nconstraints that guarantee that a model does not deliver spurious\nresults (e.g. that Suzy\u2019s throw doesn\u2019t cause the bottle\nto shatter). However, SEF is also used as a practical tool in\nscientific inquiry, and this brings additional normative questions\ninto play concerning the choice of variables and their range of\npermitted values. In the context of assigning blame for the broken\nbottle, for example, it would not be relevant to include the strength\nof the bottle\u2019s glass as a variable; by contrast, a local shop\nowner \u2013 tired of Suzy and Billy\u2019s vandalism (they\nroutinely break his shop window as well as any bottles they come\nacross) \u2013 might be very interested in the question of what\nstrength of glass might suffice to withstand their rock-throwing. (See\ne.g. Woodward 2016, Hitchcock 2017, and \u2013 for a practical\nexample in the context of causal inference in machine learning \u2013\nChalupka, Eberhardt & Perona 2017.) \n",
