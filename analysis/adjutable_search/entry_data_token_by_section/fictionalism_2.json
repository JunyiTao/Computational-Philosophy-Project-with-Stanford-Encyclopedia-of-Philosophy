    "main_text": "Some Qualifications and Distinctions || Language and ontology\n2.1 Language and ontology\n\nA first crucial distinction is between a linguistic and an\nontological thesis. The linguistic thesis is, roughly, that\nalready expressed above, according to which utterances of sentences of\nthe discourse are best seen not as efforts to say what is literally\ntrue, but as useful fictions of some sort. The ontological thesis, by\ncontrast, is the thesis that the entities characteristic of the\ndiscourse do not exist, or have the ontological status of fictional\nentities. One can in principle embrace the linguistic thesis without\nembracing the ontological thesis, and vice versa.\n\nOften the theses are run together. Nolan, Restall and West (2005) say,\nwhen introducing fictionalism, \u201cThe simplest fictionalist\napproach to a discourse takes certain claims in that discourse to be\nliterally false, but nevertheless worth uttering in certain contexts,\nsince the pretence that such claims are true is worthwhile for various\ntheoretical purposes\u201d. (The complication that they introduce is\nthat some fictionalists may simply be agnostic about the\nrelevant claims.) Zolt\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 (2001) says, \u201cTo be\na fictionalist about Fs is to think that our na\u00efve\nattitude toward F-discourse is only halfway correct: we are\nright in thinking that we use genuine singular terms that purport to\nrefer to Fs, but wrong in thinking that they actually succeed\nin referring. In engaging in F-discourse we inadvertently\nslip into fictional talk\u201d. One reason that the linguistic and\nontological theses are often run together is that the linguistic\nthesis is often motivated by ontological concerns. For example,\nsomeone who is a nominalist might on that ground find herself\nattracted to fictionalism about mathematical discourse. \n\nThe focus in this entry will primarily be on the linguistic thesis.\nThe ontological thesis might be held by someone who holds that we are\nbetter off simply abandoning or rejecting the target discourse, and\nthat is not a distinctively fictionalist thesis.\n",
