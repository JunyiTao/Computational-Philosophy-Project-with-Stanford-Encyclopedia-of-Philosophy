    "main_text": "\nAt first glance there does not seem to be anything philosophically\nproblematic about human enhancement. Activities such as physical\nfitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer\nare routinely utilized for the goal of enhancing human capacities. This\nentry is not concerned with every activity and intervention that might\nimprove people\u2019s embodied lives. The focus of this entry is a\ncluster of debates in practical ethics that is conventionally labeled\nas \u201cthe ethics of human enhancement\u201d. These debates include\nclinicians\u2019 concerns about the limits of legitimate health care,\nparents\u2019 worries about their reproductive and rearing\nobligations, and the efforts of competitive institutions like sports to\ncombat cheating, as well as more general questions about distributive\njustice, science policy, and the public regulation of medical\ntechnologies.\n\nAs usual in practical ethics, an adequate discussion of any specific\ndebate under this heading quickly requires orientation to the science\nunderlying particular enhancement interventions and an appreciation of\nthe social and political contexts in which it unfolds. At each turn in\nthese discussions, wide vistas of background philosophical topics also\nappear for exploration.  Rather than providing a detailed account of\nthis whole landscape, this entry hikes a narrow ridge between the\ndifferent dimensions of the topic, pointing out the side trails but\nnot following them into their respective thickets. Instead, it traces\na path of core concerns that winds through all the current debates on\nthe ethics of human enhancement, as guide for those interested in\nexploring further. To look ahead, our claim is that three sets of\nphilosophical considerations are key to navigating this literature:\nfirst, conceptual concerns about the limits of legitimate health care,\nthen moral worries about fairness, authenticity and human nature, and\nfinally political questions about governance and policy.\n",
