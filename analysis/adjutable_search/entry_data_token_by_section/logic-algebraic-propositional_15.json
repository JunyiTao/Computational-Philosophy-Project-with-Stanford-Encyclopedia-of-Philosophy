    "main_text": "The natural class of algebras of a logic system\n8. The natural class of algebras of a logic system\n\nWe shall now discuss the two definitions that have been considered as\nproviding natural classes of algebras associated with a logic \\(\\bL\\).\nBoth definitions can be seen as arising from an abstraction of the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method and we follow this path in introducing them.\nThe common feature of these abstractions is that in them the specific\nway in which the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) is defined in the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method is disregarded.\n\nIt has to be remarked that, nonetheless, for many logics both\ndefinitions lead to the same class. The classes obtained from both\ndefinitions have been taken in the algebraic studies of many\nparticular logics (for some logics one, for others the other) as the\nnatural class that deserves to be studied.\n\nWe already encountered the first generalization in\n Section 6\n when we showed that every logic has a reduced matrix semantics. It\nleads to the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\). That its definition is\na generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski method comes from the\nrealization that the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\), associated with an\n\\(\\bL\\)-theory, defined in the different completeness proofs in the\nliterature that use the Lindenbaum-Tarski method is in fact the\nLeibniz congruence of the matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\) and\nthat therefore the matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\theta(T), T/\\theta(T)\n\\rangle\\) is its reduction. As we mentioned in\n Section 6,\n for every logic \\(\\bL\\), every \\(\\bL\\)-sound class of matrices\n\\(\\bM\\) that contains all the matrices \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L\n}(T), T/ \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T) \\rangle\\), where \\(T\\) is\na theory of \\(\\bL\\), is a complete reduced matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\). From this perspective the notion of the Leibniz congruence of\na matrix can be taken as a generalization to arbitrary matrices of the\nidea that comes from the Lindenbaum-Tarski procedure of proving\ncompleteness. Following this course of reasoning, the class\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) of the algebras of the reduced matrix models of a logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is a very natural class of algebras to associate with \\(\\bL\\).\nIt is the class\n\n\\(\\{\\bA/\\bOmega_{\\bA }(F): \\bA\\) is an \\(\\bL\\)-algebra and \\(F\\)\nis a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\}\\).\n\nThe second way of generalizing the Lindenbaum-Tarski method uses a\ndifferent fact, namely that in the examples discussed in\n Section 3\n the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) is also the relation\n\\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) defined by the condition\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\txtiff & \\forall T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL),\\\\ \n & \\forall p \\in V, \\\\ \n &\\forall \\gamma(p) \\in \\bFm_L (T \\subseteq T' \\Rightarrow (\\gamma(p/\\phi) \\in T' \\Leftrightarrow \\gamma(p/\\psi) \\in T')). \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nFor every logic \\(\\bL\\) and every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) the relation \\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) defined in this way is the greatest congruence compatible with all the \\(\\bL\\)-theories that extend \\(T\\). Therefore, it holds that \\[\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T) = \\bigcap_{T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL)^T} \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T'),\\] where \\(\\tTH(\\bL)^T = \\{T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL): T \\subseteq T'\\}\\). The relation \\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) is known as the Suszko congruence of \\(T\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\bL)\\). Suszko defined it \u2014in an equivalent way\u2014 in 1977.\nFor every logic \\(\\bL\\), the notion of the Suszko congruence can be extended to its matrix models. The Suszko congruence of a matrix model \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) of \\(\\bL\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\bL)\\) is the greatest congruence of \\(\\bA\\) compatible with every \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\) that includes \\(D\\), that is, it is the relation given by \\[{\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(D) = \\bigcap_{D' \\in \\tFi_{\\bL}(\\bA)^D} \\bOmega_{\\bA}(D')\\] where \\(\\tFi_{\\bL}(\\bA)^D = \\{D': D'\\) is a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\) and \\(D \\subseteq D'\\}\\). Notice that unlike the intrinsic notion of Leibniz congruence, the Suszko congruence of a matrix model of \\(\\bL\\) is not intrinsic to the matrix: it depends in an essential way on the logic under consideration. The theory of the Suszko congruence of matrices has been developed in Czelakowski 2003 and continued in Albuquerque & Font & Jansana 2016.\n\nIn the same manner that the concept of Leibniz congruence leads to the\nconcept of reduced matrix, the notion of Suszko congruence leads to\nthe notion of Suszko-reduced matrix. A matrix model of \\(\\bL\\) is\nSuszko-reduced if its Suszko congruence is the identity. Then\nthe class of algebras of the Suszko-reduced matrix models of a logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is another class of algebras that is taken as a natural class\nof algebras to associate with \\(\\bL\\). It is the class \n\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL = \\{\\bA / {\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(F): \\bA\\) is an\n\\(\\bL\\)-algebra and \\(F\\) is a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of\n\\(\\bA\\}\\).\n\nThis class is nowadays taken in abstract algebraic logic as\nthe natural class of algebras to be associated with \\(\\bL\\)\nand it called its algebraic counterpart.\n\nFor an arbitrary logic \\(\\bL\\), the relation between the classes\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is that \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the closure of\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) under subdirect products, in particular \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\n\\subseteq \\bAlg\\bL\\). In general, the two classes may be different. For\nexample, if \\(\\bL\\) is the \\((\\wedge , \\vee)\\)-fragment of classical\npropositional logic, \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the variety of distributive\nlattices (the class that has been always taken to be the natural class\nof algebras associated with \\(\\bL)\\) while \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is properly\nincluded in it \u2014in fact \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is not a quasivariety.\nNonetheless, for many logics \\(\\bL\\), in particular for the\nalgebraizable and the protoalgebraic ones to be discussed in the next\nsections, and also when \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is a variety, the classes\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) are equal. This fact can explain why\nin the 1980s, before the algebraic study of non-protoalgebraic logics\nwas considered worth to be pursued, the conceptual difference between\nthe two definitions was not needed and, accordingly, it was not\nconsidered (or even discovered).\n",
