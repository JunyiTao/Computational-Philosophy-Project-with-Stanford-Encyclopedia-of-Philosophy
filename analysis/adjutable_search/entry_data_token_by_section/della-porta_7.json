    "main_text": "Mathematics\n8. Mathematics\n\nEven though in structure it was ostensibly orientated on\nEuclid\u2019s Elements, Porta\u2019s Elementorum\ncurvilineorum libri tres (1601/1610) flopped, probably because\nPorta had coined so many fantastic new words for (allegedly) new\ngeometrical shapes, which was perhaps and with hindsight one of his\nmost original ideas (Saiber 2017). In fact, Porta\u2019s knowledge of\nclassical and contemporary mathematics seems to have been vast, but\nsuperficial. Using a language that is both colloquial and empirical,\nPorta\u2019s mathematics refers to concrete objects and sensory\nevidence, rather than to logical-deductive definitions. Napolitani\naccordingly described Porta\u2019s (erroneous) proposal for a method\nto squaring the circle as sleight of hand. In Porta\u2019s\npresentation it emerged as yet another segreto that had to be arranged\nin ways that merely appear to be credible, appeal to the senses, and\ncreate marvel. Generally the ways of Elementorum is foreign to\ncontemporary discussions in the field: Accordingly both his editions\nwere not commented on by the foremost mathematicians of his time\n(Napolitani 1990).\n",
