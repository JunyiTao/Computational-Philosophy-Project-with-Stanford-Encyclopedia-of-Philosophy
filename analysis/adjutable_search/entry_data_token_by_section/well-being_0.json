    "main_text": "The Concept\n1. The Concept\n\nPopular use of the term \u2018well-being\u2019 usually relates to\nhealth. A doctor\u2019s surgery may run a \u2018Women\u2019s\nWell-being Clinic\u2019, for example. Philosophical use is broader,\nbut related, and amounts to the notion of how well a person\u2019s\nlife is going for that person. A person\u2019s well-being is what is\n\u2018good for\u2019 them. Health, then, might be said to be a\nconstituent of my well-being, but it is not plausibly taken to be all\nthat matters for my well-being. One correlate term worth noting here\nis \u2018self-interest\u2019: my self-interest is what is in the\ninterest of myself, and not others.\n\nThe philosophical use of the term also tends to encompass the\n\u2018negative\u2019 aspects of how a person\u2019s life goes for\nthem. So we may speak of the well-being of someone who is, and will\nremain in, the most terrible agony: their well-being is negative, and\nsuch that their life is worse for them than no life at all. The same\nis true of closely allied terms, such as \u2018welfare\u2019, which\ncovers how a person is faring as a whole, whether well or badly, or\n\u2018happiness\u2019, which can be understood\u2014as it sometimes\nwas by the classical utilitarians from Jeremy Bentham onwards, for\nexample\u2014to be the balance between good and bad things in a\nperson\u2019s life. But note that philosophers also use such terms in\nthe more standard \u2018positive\u2019 way, speaking of\n\u2018ill-being\u2019, \u2018ill-faring\u2019, or, of course,\n\u2018unhappiness\u2019 to capture the negative aspects of\nindividuals\u2019 lives. Most philosophical discussion has been of\n\u2018goods\u2019 rather than \u2018bads\u2019, but recently more\ninterest has been shown in the latter (e.g. Kagan 2015; Bradford\n2021).\n\n\u2018Happiness\u2019 is often used, in ordinary life, to refer to a\nshort-lived state of a person, frequently a feeling of contentment:\n\u2018You look happy today\u2019; \u2018I\u2019m very happy for\nyou\u2019. Philosophically, its scope is more often wider,\nencompassing a whole life. And in philosophy it is possible to speak\nof the happiness of a person\u2019s life, or of their happy life,\neven if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point is\nthat some good things in their life made it a happy one, even though\nthey lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause\nconfusion.\n\nOver the last few decades, so-called \u2018positive psychology\u2019\nhas hugely increased the attention paid by psychologists and other\nscientists to the notion of \u2018happiness\u2019. Such happiness is\nusually understood in terms of contentment or\n\u2018life-satisfaction\u2019, and is measured by means such as\nself-reports or daily questionnaires. Is positive psychology about\nwell-being? As yet, conceptual distinctions are not sufficiently clear\nwithin the discipline. But it is probably fair to say that many of\nthose involved, as researchers or as subjects, are assuming that\none\u2019s life goes well to the extent that one is contented with\nit\u2014that is, that some kind of hedonistic account of well-being\nis correct. Some positive psychologists, however, explicitly reject\nhedonistic theories in preference to Aristotelian or\n\u2018eudaimonist\u2019 accounts of well-being, which are a version\nof the \u2018objective list\u2019 theory of well-being discussed\nbelow. A leader in the field, Martin Seligman, for example, has\nsuggested that, rather than happiness, positive psychology should\nconcern itself with positive emotion, engagement, relationships,\nmeaning and accomplishment (\u2018Perma\u2019) (Seligman 2011).\n\nWhen discussing the notion of what makes life good for the individual\nliving that life, it is preferable to use the term\n\u2018well-being\u2019 instead of \u2018happiness\u2019. For we\nwant at least to allow conceptual space for the possibility that, for\nexample, the life of a plant may be \u2018good for\u2019 that plant.\nAnd speaking of the happiness of a plant would be stretching language\ntoo far. (An alternative here might be \u2018flourishing\u2019,\nthough this might be taken to bias the analysis of human well-being in\nthe direction of some kind of natural teleology.) In that respect, the\nGreek word commonly translated \u2018happiness\u2019\n(eudaimonia) might be thought to be superior. But, in fact,\neudaimonia seems to have been restricted not only to\nconscious beings, but to human beings: non-human animals cannot be\neudaimon. This is because eudaimonia suggests that\nthe gods, or fortune, have favoured one, and the idea that the gods\ncould care about non-humans would not have occurred to most\nGreeks.\n\nIt is occasionally claimed that certain ancient ethical theories, such\nas Aristotle\u2019s, result in the collapse of the very notion of\nwell-being. On Aristotle\u2019s view, if you are my friend, then my\nwell-being is closely bound up with yours. It might be tempting, then,\nto say that \u2018your\u2019 well-being is \u2018part\u2019 of\nmine, in which case the distinction between what is good for me and\nwhat is good for others has broken down. But this temptation should be\nresisted. Your well-being concerns how well your life goes for you,\nand we can allow that my well-being depends on yours without\nintroducing the confusing notion that my well-being is constituted by\nyours. There are signs in Aristotelian thought of an expansion of the\nsubject or owner of well-being. A friend is \u2018another\nself\u2019, so that what benefits my friend benefits me. But this\nshould be taken either as a metaphorical expression of the dependence\nclaim, or as an identity claim which does not threaten the notion of\nwell-being: if you really are the same person as I am, then of course\nwhat is good for you will be what is good for me, since there is no\nlonger any metaphysically significant distinction between you and\nme.\n\nWell-being is a kind of value, sometimes called \u2018prudential\nvalue\u2019, to be distinguished from, for example, aesthetic value\nor moral value. What marks it out is the notion of \u2018good\nfor\u2019. The serenity of a Vermeer painting, for instance, is a\nkind of goodness, but it is not \u2018good for\u2019 the painting.\nIt may be good for us to contemplate such serenity, but contemplating\nserenity is not the same as the serenity itself. Likewise, my giving\nmoney to a development charity may have moral value, that is, be\nmorally good. And the effects of my donation may be good for others.\nBut it remains an open question whether my being morally good is good\nfor me; and, if it is, its being good for me is still conceptually\ndistinct from its being morally good. A great deal of attention\nhas been paid in philosophy to the issue of moral\n\u2018normativity\u2019, less so to that of prudential normativity\n(recent exceptions are Dorsey 2021; Fletcher 2021).\n\nThe most common view of well-being is \u2018invariabilism\u2019,\naccording to which there is a single account of well-being for all\nindividuals for whom life can go well or badly (Lin 2018). Some have\nargued, however, that we should develop a variabilist view, according\nto which, for example, there might be one theory of well-being for\nadults and another for children (see Skelton 2015). According to\nBenatar (2006), existence for any individual with well-being is always\nof overall negative value. On well-being and death, see Bradley\n(2006).\n",
