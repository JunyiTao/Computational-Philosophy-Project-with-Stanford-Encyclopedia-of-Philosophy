    "main_text": "Support for EC: Apparently Inconsistent Knowledge Claims, Skeptical and Everyday || A Skeptical Puzzle\n3.1 A Skeptical Puzzle\nConsider one form of skeptical argument upon which leading contextualists have focused (e.g., Cohen 1986, 1988, 2014; DeRose 1995; Neta 2003a & b; cf. Unger 1975). (We can call it \u2018SA\u2019, for \u2018skeptical argument\u2019.) Let \u2018h\u2019 stand for some skeptical hypothesis, e.g., that I am a mere brain in a vat of brain nutrients being stimulated to have just those experiences that I have had. Let \u2018p\u2019 stand for a mundane external world belief that I seem to know, e.g., that I have hands. Here is the argument:\n\n\n\n\nP1.\nI don\u2019t know that not-h.\n\n\nP2.\nIf I don\u2019t know that not-h, then I don\u2019t know that p.\n\n\nC.\nSo, I don\u2019t know that p.\n\n\n\n\nSA constitutes a puzzle because (a) each of the premises enjoys a fair amount of plausibility. As to P1, how could I know that I\u2019m not a bodiless brain in a vat? By waving my arms around? Wouldn\u2019t that just give me the evidence of some arm-waving experiences that a mere brain in a vat could have? As to P2, it is just an instance of the closure principle for knowledge,[6] which many regard as axiomatic. But (b) given our intuitive anti-skepticism, C seems immensely implausible, even though (c) SA appears to be valid.\nOn the face of it, then, we are confronted with a paradox\u2014a set of independently plausible but seemingly mutually inconsistent propositions. Because that is the problem, a complete solution to SA will do two things (DeRose 1995): explain which of the ideas lying behind the seeming paradox should be rejected, and why; and explain too why the idea singled out for rejection struck us as plausible in the first place.\n",
