    "main_text": "The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy || Peoples: Liberal and Decent\n5.2 Peoples: Liberal and Decent\n\nThe actors in Rawls\u2019s international theory are not individuals\n(citizens) but societies (peoples). A people is a group of\nindividuals ruled by a common government, bound together by common\nsympathies, and firmly attached to a common conception of right and\njustice. \u201cPeople\u201d is a moralized concept, and not all\nstates currently on the world map qualify as such.\n\nRawls\u2019s conception of peoples within the law of peoples\nparallels his conception of citizens within justice as fairness.\nPeoples see themselves as free in the sense of being rightfully\npolitically independent; and as equal in regarding themselves as\nequally deserving of recognition and respect. Peoples are reasonable\nin that they will honor fair terms of cooperation with other peoples,\neven at cost to their own interests, given that other peoples will\nalso honor those terms. Reasonable peoples are thus unwilling to try\nto impose their political or social ideals on other reasonable\npeoples. They satisfy the criterion of reciprocity with respect to one\nanother.\n\nRawls describes the fundamental interests of a people as follows:\n\nProtecting its political independence, its territory, and the\nsecurity of its citizens;\nMaintaining its political and social institutions and its civic\nculture;\nSecuring its proper self-respect as a people, which rests on its\ncitizens\u2019 awareness of its history and cultural\naccomplishments.\n\n\nRawls contrasts peoples with states. A state, Rawls says, is\nmoved by the desires to enlarge its territory, or to convert other\nsocieties to its religion, or to enjoy the power of ruling over\nothers, or to increase its relative economic strength. Peoples are not\nstates, and as we will see peoples may treat societies that act like\nstates as international outlaws.\n\nPeoples are of two types, depending on the nature of their domestic\npolitical institutions. Liberal peoples satisfy the\nrequirements of political liberalism: they have legitimate liberal\nconstitutions, and they have governments that are under popular\ncontrol and not driven by large concentration of private economic\npower.\n\nDecent peoples are not internally just from a liberal\nperspective. Their basic institutions do not recognize reasonable\npluralism or embody any interpretation of the liberal ideas of free\nand equal citizens cooperating fairly. The institutions of a decent\nsociety may be organized around a single comprehensive doctrine, such\nas a dominant religion. The political system may not be democratic,\nand women or members of minority religions may be excluded from public\noffice. Nevertheless, decent peoples are well-ordered enough, Rawls\nsays, to merit equal membership in international society.\n\nLike all peoples, decent peoples do not have aggressive foreign\npolicies. Beyond this, Rawls describes one type of decent\nsociety\u2014a decent hierarchical society\u2014to\nillustrate what decency requires.\n\nA decent hierarchical society\u2019s basic structure specifies a\ndecent system of social cooperation. First, it secures a core list of\nhuman rights. Second, its political system takes the\nfundamental interests of all persons into account through a decent\nconsultation hierarchy. This means that the government genuinely\nconsults with the representatives of all social groups, which together\nrepresent all persons in the society, and that the government\njustifies its laws and policies to these groups. The government does\nnot close down protests, and responds to any protests with\nconscientious replies. The government also supports the right of\ncitizens to emigrate.\n\nRawls imagines a decent hierarchical society that he calls\n\u201cKazanistan.\u201d In Kazanistan, Islam is the favored\nreligion, and only Muslims can hold the high office. However\nnon-Muslim religions may be practiced without fear, and believers in\nthem are encouraged to take part in the civic culture of the wider\nsociety. Minorities are not subject to arbitrary discrimination by\nlaw, or treated as inferior by Muslims. Kazanistan would qualify,\nRawls says, as a decent, well-ordered member of the society of\npeoples, entitled to respectful toleration and equal treatment by\nother peoples.\n",
