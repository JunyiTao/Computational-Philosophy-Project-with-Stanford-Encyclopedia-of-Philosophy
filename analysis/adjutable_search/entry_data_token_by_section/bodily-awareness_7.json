    "main_text": "The perceptual model of bodily awareness || Knowledge without observation\n2.3 Knowledge without observation\n\nA different type of criticism of the perceptual model of bodily\nawareness can be found in Wittgenstein (1978), and later Anscombe\n(1962). They claim that the ability to report how the limbs are\nlocated and how they move does not depend on sensations of position.\nIt thus differs from perceptual knowledge. I know that the sky is blue\nin virtue of having a visual experience of the blueness of the sky but\nI know that my legs are crossed independently of any sensation.\nAccording to Anscombe, bodily knowledge cannot be grounded in\nsensations because only sensations whose content is\n\u201cindependently describable\u201d can play an epistemic role.\nThe sense of position is thus what Anscombe calls a kind of knowledge\nwithout observation: \u201cIt is without observation, because nothing\nshews him the position of his limbs\u201d (Anscombe 1957: 13).\n\nThe interpretation of the notion of knowledge without observation has\ngiven rise to many debates. A first concerns Anscombe\u2019s\nepistemological theory. Why do contents have to be independent to\nground judgments? The second problem is that it seems that her\nargument ultimately relies on her phenomenological intuitions:\n\u201cno question of any appearance of the position to me, of any\nsensations which give me the position\u201d (Anscombe 1962). However,\none may question this claim on the basis of bodily illusions (Harcourt\n2008; for a reply, McDowell 2011). For instance, if the tendon of the\nbiceps is vibrated, one can \u201cfeel\u201d one\u2019s arm moving\nthough one knows the arm actually remains still. But does that suffice\nto show that the sensation is independently describable? The problem\nis that the notion of independent description is not clear. Why does\n\u201cthe visual impression of a blue expanse\u201d (Anscombe 1962:\n57) qualify as independent but not the impression of one\u2019s arm\nmoving? It may sometimes be difficult to see why bodily awareness does\nnot fall into the same category as perceptual awareness.\n",
