    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice\n4. Deliberation and Choice \n\nAs suggested above much of the inquiry into value incomparability is\nmotivated more generally by theories of practical reason and rational\nchoice. Even if a conception of justified choice can accommodate value\nincomparability, questions remain about how to justify choice on the\nbasis of incomparability and how to reason about incomparability. This\nsection considers these issues as they have been discussed in the\ncontemporary philosophical literature.\n\nIt is worth noting the potential for drawing connections between the\nphilosophical literature and the literature in psychology and the\nsocial sciences on decision-making. One area for such potential is the\npsychological literature on the difficulty of making decisions (Yates,\nVeinott, and Patalano 2003). Jane Beattie and Sema Barlas (2001), for\nexample, advance the thesis that the observed variation in the\ndifficulty of making trade-offs between alternatives can be explained\nin part by the category to which the alternatives belong. The authors\nconsider three categories: commodities (\u201cobjects that are\nappropriately bought and sold in markets\u201d), currencies\n(\u201cobjects that act as stand-ins for commodities\u201d), and\nnoncommodities (\u201cobjects that either cannot be transferred\n(e.g., pain) or that lose some of their value by being traded in\nmarkets (e.g., friendship)\u201d) (Beattie and Barlas 2001, 30). The\nauthors\u2019 experimental findings are consistent with participants\nholding normative commitments about exchanging currencies and\nnoncommodities similar to those considered in the discussion of\nconstitutive incommensurability in subsection 3.2. For example,\nBeattie and Barlas report that participants \u201chad a significant\ntendency to choose noncommodities over commodities and\ncurrencies\u201d and that choices between noncommodities and\ncurrencies were the easiest for participants (2001, 50\u201351). The\nauthors interpret these results to support the view that people choose\nnoncommodities over currencies on the basis of a rule without engaging\nin a calculation of trade-offs (2001, 51\u201353). In the context of\nempirical research, it should also be noted that philosophers have\ncontributed with empirical research on the characterization of hard\nchoices (Messerli and Reuter 2017a, 2017b).\n",
