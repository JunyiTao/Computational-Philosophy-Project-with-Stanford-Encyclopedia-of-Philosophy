    "main_text": "The Good Democrat || Deliberative Democracy\n2.3 Deliberative Democracy\n\nDeliberative democracy is the idea that a legitimate political\ndecision is one that results from discussions among citizens under\nreasonably favorable conditions. Proponents debate precisely what\nqualifies as deliberation, but there is a general agreement that the\ndiscussion should be inclusive, free, equitable, and in some sense\ncivil. In practical terms, deliberative democracy implies various\nefforts to increase the amount and the impact of public discussions.\nThe philosophical underpinnings derive from the work of influential\ntheorists including J\u00fcrgen Habermas, John Rawls, Michael Sandel,\nand others of varying views. See Gutmann and Thompson (1996) for an\nexample of a sophisticated treatment that draws on many earlier\nworks.\n\nFor civic education, the implication of deliberative democracy is that\npeople should learn to participate in discussions, which may be both\nface-to-face and \u201cmediated\u201d by the news media and social\nmedia. Concretely, that means that people should develop the aptitude,\ndesire, knowledge, and skills that lead them to read and discuss the\nnews and current events with diverse fellow citizens and influence the\ngovernment with the views that they develop and refine by\ndeliberation. Practices such as discussing and debating current events\nin school seem especially promising. \n",
