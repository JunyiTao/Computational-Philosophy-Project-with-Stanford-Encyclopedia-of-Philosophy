    "main_text": "The Problem of the Sophist\n4. The Problem of the Sophist\n\n\nThe divisions in the Sophist and Statesman are \ndivisions of arts (angling, sophistry, weaving, statecraft), and only\nsecondarily of experts who possess those arts. The art makes \nthe expert the sort of expert he is. The initial attempts to define \nthe sophist and statesman, using the method of dichotomous division, \neach reveal a puzzle about the target kind, and that puzzle is then resolved in\nsome other way, or at least in conjunction with some other method. \nThe sophist is puzzling because his art turns up, not at a \nsingle terminus like angling, but at many different termini. \nReflection on this peculiarity enables the inquirers to recognize \nsomething they had previously missed\u2014the essence of the \nsophist\u2014which ties together the various previous appearances.\n",
