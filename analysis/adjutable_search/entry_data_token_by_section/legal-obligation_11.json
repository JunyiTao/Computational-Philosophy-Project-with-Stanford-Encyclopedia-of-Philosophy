    "main_text": "Non-Transactional Theories || Constitutive Obligations\n6. Scepticism and Anarchism\n\nAs the above survey suggests, there are plausible objections to each\nof the dominant justifications for the duty to obey the law. (For\nhelpful assessments of other theories, see also Wasserstrom 1963;\nSmith 1973; Simmons 1979; Huemer 2013.) Each leaves significant gaps\nin the authority of law. This is not an impossibility proof\u2014only\nanarchists like Wolff think that justified political authority is\nimpossible. But neither is it just the familiar problem that\nphilosophical theories provide only a rough fit to our casuistic\njudgements. The problem is that the typical justifications for\nauthority are all sensitive to context in a way that the claims of law\nare not. To put it another way, law itself purports to determine how\nfar and in what contexts its authority binds. (For a formulation of\nthe sceptical view that explores its relationship with legal\npositivism, see Kramer 1999.)\n\nThe resulting scepticism about the obligation to obey has given rise\nto a debate about its significance (Senor 1987; Gans 1992: 90). As in\nother areas of philosophy, some treat sceptical conclusions as a\nreductio against whatever premises seem to support them;\nothers are inclined to follow the arguments where they lead. In\nassessing the significance of scepticism, one needs to bear in mind\nseveral points.\n\nTo begin with, scepticism about political obligation flows from the\nspecial features of legal authority, in particular, its wide\nscope, its institutionalized character, and its moral fallibility.\nThat is why the familiar principles by which we justify the authority\nof teachers, parents, doctors, or executors do not readily generalize\nto cover all laws. Most sceptical arguments are about over-reach. They\ndo not deny that legal authority is often valuable, or that there is\noften content-dependent reason to do what law requires; they do not\ndeny that some people have moral obligations to obey; they do not even\ndeny that there are some laws that everyone has a moral\nobligation to obey. They deny only that the conscientious subject is\nbound to take the law at its word, that he must share the self-image\nof the state.\n\nThis does not amount to endorsing a policy of \u201cpick and\nchoose\u201d. It is consistent with a mixed policy: there may be\nareas and issues with respect to which one should accept an obligation\nof obedience and others where one should apportion one\u2019s\ncompliance to the merits. Hart writes:\n\n\nThe recognition of an obligation to obey the law must as a\nminimum imply that there is at least some area of conduct regulated by\nlaw in which we are not free to judge the moral merits of particular\nlaws and to make our obedience conditional on this judgment. (Hart\n1958: 104)\n\n\nSceptical arguments need not deny that there is some such area; they\ndeny that it coincides with law\u2019s actual claims.\n\nSecondly, scepticism about obligation does not entail scepticism about\nlegitimacy: one may affirm that law is entitled to coerce while\ndenying that all of law\u2019s subjects have a duty to obey it (see\nGreen 1988; Simmons 1979; Edmundson 1998). Scepticism about the\npossibility of legitimate government leads to anarchism of the\nordinary sort; scepticism about political obligation leads only to\nwhat is called \u201cphilosophical anarchism\u201d: the denial that\nlaw has all the authority it claims for itself.\n\nThirdly, scepticism is not the view that assuming an obligation to\nobey would be impermissible, as suggested by anarchists like\nWilliam Godwin or R. P. Wolff and extreme individualists like Thoreau.\nRather, sceptics argue that there are also other morally\npermissible attitudes to have towards the law. These attitudes may be\nmore prevalent, and more justifiable, than some philosophers\nsuppose.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noticing that, if successful, the objections\nconsidered above only show that there is no principle capable of\ngrounding political obligation over all those over whom states claim\nauthority. But why think that a sound theory of political obligation\nshould appeal to a single principle? Perhaps our best account of\npolitical obligation will employ different principles to justify the\nstate\u2019s right to demand our obedience in different areas (Klosko\n2005) and over different individuals (Renzo 2012 and 2014). One way of\novercoming skepticism about political obligation is to be pluralist\nabout it (J. Wolff 2000; Knowles 2010; Mokrosinska; 2012)\n",
