    "main_text": "Early Work (1946\u201360) || Christianity and Marxism\n2.1 Christianity and Marxism\n\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophical output between 1946 and 1961 can\nroughly be divided into four categories. The first category includes\nthose essays, mostly written between 1946 and 1951, where Althusser\nexplores possible rapports between Christianity and Marxism. In the\nfirst of these essays \u201cThe International of Decent\nFeelings,\u201d Althusser argues from what he takes to be \u201cthe\ntruth of Christianity\u201d against the popular post-war view that\nthe misery, guilt, and alienation of the human condition in the atomic\nage is equally experienced by all subjects. For him, this\nexistentialist diagnosis is a type of idolatry: it replaces\nrecognition of our equality before God with our equality before the\nfear of death. In that it does so, it is twice anti-Christian. For, in\naddition to the sin of idolatry (death equals God), it fails to\nacknowledge the existence of a particular class, the proletariat, for\nwhom anguish is not its lot and who is actually capable of delivering\nthe emancipation from fear by re-appropriating the products of human\nproduction, including the atomic bomb. A subsequent essay from 1947,\n\u201cA Matter of Fact,\u201d continues in this vein, suggesting the\nnecessity of socialist means for realizing Christian ends. It also\nincludes a Hegelian critique of the existing Catholic Church which\nsuggests that the church is incapable of such an alliance without a\ntheological revolution. Each of these essays includes the suggestion\nthat critique and reform will occasion a better church and a truer\nChristianity. By 1949, however, Althusser was totally pessimistic\nabout this possibility and, in a letter to his mentor Jean Lacroix, he\nargued that the sole possibility for realizing Christian values is\nthrough communist action. Though some critics have argued that\nChristian and Catholic values and modes of reasoning inform all of\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophy, any explicit consideration of a\npractical and theoretical reconciliation between the two was abandoned\nat this point in Althusser\u2019s development.\n",
