Thinking as general as this concerns not\nmerely my own opportunities, but the kinds of good things that any\nhuman being can do and achieve, or be deprived of. Thinking about what\nto do is conveniently labeled \u201cpractical\u201d, and is\nconcerned with what and how to choose and do what one intelligently\nand reasonably can (i) to achieve intelligible goods in one\u2019s\nown life and the lives of other human beings and their environment,\nand (ii) to be of good character and live a life that as a whole will\nhave been a reasonable response to such opportunities.\n\nPolitical philosophy is, in one respect, simply that part or extension\nof moral philosophy which considers the kinds of choice that should be\nmade by all who share in the responsibility and authority of choosing\nfor a community of the comprehensive kind called political. In another\nrespect, it is a systematic explanatory account of the forms of\npolitical arrangement that experience and empirical observation show\nare available, with their characteristic features, outcomes, and\nadvantages (and disadvantages and bad aspects and consequences).\nThough in form descriptive and contemplative, and thus non-practical,\nthis aspect of political philosophy remains subordinate, in its\nsystematization or conceptual structure, to the categories one finds\nnecessary or appropriate when doing moral and political philosophy as\nit should be done, that is, as practical thinking by one whose every\nchoice (even the choice to do nothing now, or the choice to do moral\nor political philosophy) should be a good use of opportunity.\n\nMoral and political philosophy for Aquinas, then, is (1) the set or\nsets of concepts and propositions which, as principles and precepts of\naction, pick out the kinds of conduct (that is, chosen action) that\nare truly intelligent and reasonable for human individuals and\npolitical communities, together with (2) the arguments necessary to\njustify those concepts and propositions in the face of doubts, or at\nleast to defend them against objections. It is a fundamentally\npractical philosophy of principles which direct us towards\nhuman fulfillment (flourishing) so far as that happier\nstate of affairs is both constituted and achievable by way of the\nactions (chosen conduct) that both manifest and build up the\nexcellences of character traditionally called virtues. If one\nmust use a post-Kantian jargon, it is both \u201cteleological\u201d\nand \u201cdeontic\u201d, and not more the one than the other.\n", "toc": [{"#InteMeth": "1.

Interpretations and method\n\nAquinas\u2019 moral and political philosophy has to be reconstructed\nfrom his theological treatises and commentaries and his commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics and the first two and\nhalf books of Aristotle\u2019s Politics. Its proper\ninterpretation has been a matter of some difficulty from the time of\nhis death in 1274. In recent decades the way to understand some\naspects of its foundational concepts and logic has been strenuously\ndisputed, not least among those philosophers who see it as offering a\nbroadly sound answer to radical scepticism about value and obligation,\nan answer truer and more human than Kant\u2019s or Bentham\u2019s or\ntheir (in the broadest sense) successors\u2019. A partial sample of\nthese controversies is given in 1.1 and 1.2 below, which state the\nmore common interpretation on two strategic issues and then elaborate\nobjections to those interpretations. The remainder of this article\nthen proceeds on the basis that there is merit in these objections,\nand that the study of Aquinas\u2019 ethics as a systematic and\nstrictly philosophical work of practical reason (at its most general\nand reflective) is still in its infancy. Further textual support, from\nover 60 of Aquinas\u2019 works, can be found in Finnis 1998.\nCriticisms of the interpretation of Aquinas\u2019 theory that is\nproposed in that work can be found in Paterson 2006, Wheatley 2015,\nLong 2004, and earlier in Lisska 1998 and McInerny 1997. These works\nargue in various ways that that interpretation denies or neglects the\nmetaphysical foundations of the principles of practical reason that it\noffers to identify. Support, in general, for the approach in this\narticle will be found in Rhonheimer 2012 and 2000. The first issue\nunderlying this debate is whether the order of inquiry and coming to\nknow (the epistemological order) is the same as the order of\nmetaphysical dependence. The second issue is whether we can settle the\nfirst issue by using the epistemological axiom that we come to an\n(ultimately metaphysical) understanding of dynamic natures by\nunderstanding capacities through their actuations \u2013 which, in\nturn, we come to understand by understanding their objects. Does or\ndoes not that axiom entail that understanding of objects such as the\nintelligible goods (the objects of acts of will) precedes an adequate\nknowledge of nature, notwithstanding that (as is agreed on all sides)\nin the metaphysical order of intrinsic dependence such objects could\nnot be willed or attained but for the given nature of (in this case)\nthe human person?\n1.1 Is the notion of \u201cdistinctive human function\u201d foundational for Aquinas?\n\nOne line of understanding is exemplified by the section on\n\u201cmoral doctrine\u201d in McInerny and O\u2019Callaghan 2005.\nIt gives a priority to Aristotle\u2019s arguments attempting to\nidentify a \u201cdistinctive\u201d or \u201cpeculiarly human\u201d\nfunction, arguments which proceed on the postulate that, if each kind\nof craft has its own characteristic function and mode of operation, so\nmust human life as a whole have an \u201coverall\u201d and\n\u201cdistinctively characteristic\u201d function and\noperatio; and the determination of this should decisively\nshape the whole of (the rest of) ethics and political theory. To this\nstandard interpretation other interpreters, such as Grisez, Finnis,\nand Rhonheimer, object on grounds such as these:\n\n(i) Aquinas\u2019 austerely self-disciplined purposes as an\nAristotelian commentator make quite insecure any assumption that he\ntreats as fundamental to his own thinking any and every proposition\nwhich is treated by Aristotle as fundamental and expounded in\nAquinas\u2019 relevant commentary without adverse comment.\n\n(ii) The \u201cdistinctive function\u201d argument is not\nprominent or adduced as fundamental (or at all) in Aquinas\u2019 more\nfree-standing treatments of morality.\n\n(iii) The argument is treated by Aquinas\u2019 commentary as yielding\nthe conclusion that felicitas (human happiness or\nflourishing) consists in a complete life lived in accordance with\nreason and hence, by entailment, with virtue. But in the Summa\nTheologiae this is argued to be only an imperfect and incomplete\nfelicitas, and the problematic character of such a concept is\napparent from the Summa\u2019s definition of\nfelicitas (and synonymously beatitudo) as perfect\ngood and complete satisfaction of all desires.\n\n(iv) The \u201cdistinctive function\u201d argument is inherently\nunsatisfying in ways that could hardly have failed to be apparent to\nso able a philosopher as Aquinas. (a) In Aquinas\u2019 rendering, it\ndepends on the postulate that \u201cnature does nothing in\nvain\u201d, which in turn depends, according to Aquinas, on the\npremise that nature is the product of divine creative rationality, a\npremise which Aquinas himself argues is, though provable, by no means\nself-evident. (b) It seems arbitrary to assume that, if there is an\nappropriate function or operatio of human beings, it must be\npeculiar to them. For peculiarity or distinctiveness has no inherent\nrelationship to practical fittingness, and in fact Aquinas elsewhere\ndenies that rationality is peculiar to human beings since he holds\nthat there are other intelligent creatures (the angels, understood to\nbe created minds unmixed with matter, occupying what would otherwise\nbe a surprising gap in the hierarchy of beings which ascends from the\nmost material and inactive kinds through the vegetative kinds, the\nanimal kinds, and the rational animal humankind, to the one utterly\nactive and intelligent, non-dependent and uncreated divine being).\n\n(v) The root of the weakness of the \u201cpeculiar/distinctive\nfunction\u201d argument is that it is looking in the wrong direction,\ntowards a metaphysical proposition concerning the nature of things,\ninstead of towards what is intelligibly good as an opportunity,\nperhaps even the supreme opportunity, for me and anyone like me (any\nhuman being). And it is a truly fundamental methodological axiom of\nAquinas\u2019s philosophy, from beginning to end of his works, that\nin coming to understand the nature of a dynamic reality such as human\nbeing, one must first understand its capacities, to understand which\none must first understand its act(ivities), to understand which one\nmust first come to understand those activities\u2019 objects. But the\nobjects of human activities are intelligible opportunities such as\ncoming to know, being alive and healthy, being in friendship with\nothers, and so forth \u2013 objects whose attractiveness,\nfittingness, opportuneness, or appropriateness is in no way dependent\nupon, or even much enhanced by, the thought that they are\ndistinctively characteristic of human beings as opposed to other\nanimals.\n\n(vi) The fact that an operatio is distinctive of human beings\ndoes not entail that that operatio is truly valuable, still\nless that it is obligatory, or that it is more valuable than\nalternative and incompatible ways or objectives of acting. For a\npremise containing no evaluative or normative term cannot entail a\nconclusion including such a term. If, on the other hand, the postulate\nthat a certain operatio is the proper (or even a proper)\nfunction of human beings is asserted to be itself evaluative and/or\nnormative rather than, or as well as, factual/descriptive, then some\naccount is needed of the postulate\u2019s source or justification (or\nself-evidence?). Aquinas has a fairly careful account of the\nself-evidence of a number of foundational evaluative and normative\nprinciples, but only one or two of them are said by him to point to\nkinds of operatio distinctive of human beings; two of the\nfoundational principles are explicitly said by him to direct to goods\nthat are not peculiar to human beings.\n\n(vii) The analogy comparing one\u2019s life as a whole to arts and\ncrafts, each with its own distinctive function, operatio,\nseems weak, questionable and indeed question-begging. For life as a\nwhole is open-ended both in having no knowable duration (see 2.2.\nbelow) and in requiring judgment about the choice-worthiness of ends\nas well as means and techniques (see 4.4.1. below). Moreover, Aquinas\nlike Aristotle regularly insists on the irreducibility of the\ndistinction or distinctions between, on the one hand, ars or\nfactio (arts, crafts, techniques) and actio (the\nprecise subject-matter of morality and morally significant\nchoices).\n1.2 Is the identification of \u201cman\u2019s last end\u201d foundational for Aquinas?\n\nAlong with very many other Thomistic commentators, McInerny and\nO\u2019Callaghan 2005 and Celano 2003 treat Aquinas\u2019 moral\nphilosophy as founded, like his moral theology, upon his determination\nof what felicitas (= perfecta beatitudo and\nAristotle\u2019s eudaimonia) truly is, a determination made\nin the opening quaestiones of the Second Part of his\nSumma Theologiae, where he elaborately argues that complete\nbeatitudo or felicitas consists in an\nuninterruptible vision of God (and, in God, of the other truths we\nnaturally desire to know), something possible for us only in a life\n\u2013 in many respects another life \u2013 after death. But it is\npossible to regard Aquinas\u2019 argument in those\nquaestiones as dictated by the needs of a specifically\ntheological pedagogy, as open to telling objections, and as detachable\nfrom (or at least as methodologically posterior to) the working and\nsound foundations of his moral philosophy and his treatment of\nspecific moral issues \u2013 detachable, that is to say, in a way\nthat Aquinas would not need to regard as inappropriate in the\ndifferent context of today\u2019s discourse. This article will treat\nAquinas\u2019 ethics and political theory as detachable from his\ntheology of life\u2019s ultimate point, and will take seriously his\nemphatic and reiterated thesis that, apart from the divinely given and\nsuper-natural opportunity of perfecta beatitudo (a gift about\nwhich philosophy as such knows nothing), the only ultimate end and\nbeatitudo (fulfillment) for human beings is living in a\ncompletely reasonable, morally excellent (virtuosus) way.\nThat thesis entails that philosophy\u2019s main account of morality\nneed and should contain no claim about what perfect happiness consists\nin.\n\nDespite surface appearances, Aquinas is conscious of Aristotle\u2019s\nfailure to settle whether it is contemplation or political\npraxis that is the essence of human fulfillment. He therefore\nattempts, more intently than Aristotle did in any surviving work, to\nidentify what the first principles of ethics and politics are, and to\ndo so without any premises or presuppositions about a unitary\n\u201clast end of human existence\u201d.\n\nMoreover, when Aquinas does refer to beatitudo as fundamental\nto identifying the principles of practical reason and the natural\n(because reasonable) moral law, he in the same breath emphasizes that\nthis is not to be thought of as the happiness of the deliberating and\nacting individual alone, but rather as the common flourishing\nof the community, ultimately the whole community of humankind:\n\nThe ultimate end of human life is felicitas or\nbeatitudo\u2026 So the main concern of law [including the\nnatural (moral) law] must be with directing towards\nbeatitudo. Again, since every part stands to the whole as\nincomplete stands to complete, and individual human beings are each\nparts of a complete community, law\u2019s appropriate concern is\nnecessarily with directing towards common felicitas \u2026\nthat is, to common good. (ST I-II q. 90 a. 2.)\n\nThe \u201ccomplete community\u201d mentioned here is the political\ncommunity, with its laws, but the proposition implicitly refers also\nto the community of all rational creatures, to whose common good\nmorality (the moral law) directs us.\n1.2.1 Philosophy and theology in Aquinas\u2019 theory of morality and politics\n\nDetaching Aquinas\u2019 philosophy from his theology is compatible\nwith distinctions he firmly delineates at the beginning of his two\nmature theological syntheses, the Summa contra Gentiles and\nthe Summa Theologiae. (i) There are truths, he says, which\nare accessible to natural reason, that is, to ordinary experience\n(including the specialized observations of natural scientists),\ninsight, and reflection; and these include practical truths about good\nand evil, right and wrong. (ii) Many of those truths of natural reason\nare confirmed, and even clarified, by divine revelation, that is, the\npropositions communicated directly or inferentially in the life and\nworks of Christ, as transmitted by his immediate followers and\nprepared for in the Jewish scriptures accepted by those followers as\nrevelatory. (iii) Some of the truths divinely revealed could not have\nbeen discovered by natural, philosophical reason, even though, once\naccepted, their content and significance can be illuminated by the\nphilosophically ordered reflection which he calls theology.\n\nThe philosophical positions in ethics and politics (including law)\nthat are explored in this article belong to categories (i) and (ii).\nThe moral and political norms stated, for example, in the biblical\nDecalogue are, in Aquinas\u2019 view, all knowable independently of\nthat revelation, which confirms and perhaps clarifies them. But the\npropositions that he holds about what the true last end or ultimate\ndestiny of human beings actually is belong to category (iii) and\ncannot be affirmed on any philosophical basis, even though philosophy,\nhe thinks, can demonstrate that they are neither incoherent nor\ncontrary to any proposition which philosophy shows must be\naffirmed.\n2. Practical reason\u2019s first principles\n\nIntelligence and reason are not two powers; \u201creason\u201d and\n\u201creasoning\u201d in a narrow sense can be regarded as the\nextension of one\u2019s \u201cintelligence\u201d (one\u2019s\ncapacity for intelligent insight into the data of experience) into the\npropositional work of reasoning towards judgment, and\n\u201creason\u201d (ratio) in a broader sense refers to\nthis whole capacity, only analytically divisible into aspects or\nphases. So too, practical reason is not a distinct power. Rather,\none\u2019s capacity to think about the way things are can be\n(and naturally, that is effortlessly and normally, is)\n\u201cextended\u201d (Aquinas\u2019 metaphor) to thinking\nintelligently and making reasonable and true judgments about what\nto do. Thinking and judging of the latter kind is practical, that\nis, intends to terminate in choice and action (in Greek\npraxis, in Latin actio). \u201cPractical\nreason\u201d sometimes refers (i) directly to such thinking,\nsometimes (ii) to the propositional content or structure which such\nthinking has when it is done well \u2013 and thus to the propositions\nthat pick out what kinds of action one ought to be judging\npursuit-worthy, undesirable, right, wrong, etc. \u2013 and sometimes\n(iii) to the capacity to engage in such thinking by understanding such\npropositions and being guided by them.\n2.1 Precondition: capacity for self-determination by free choices\n\nPractical reason\u2019s central activity is deliberation about what\nto do. One would have no need to deliberate unless one were confronted\nby alternative attractive possibilities for action (kinds of\nopportunity) between which one must choose (in the sense that one\ncannot do both at the same time, if at all) and can choose. The\nstandards that one comes to understand to be the appropriate guides\nfor one\u2019s deliberation, choice and action give such guidance,\nnot by predicting what one will do, but by directing what one\nshould do. (The \u201cshould\u201d here may but need not be moral.)\nThere could be no normativity, no practical (choice-guiding)\ndirectiveness, unless free choices were really possible.\n\nAquinas\u2019s position is not that all our activities are freely\nchosen: there are indeed \u201cacts of the human person\u201d,\nperhaps quite frequent, which are not \u201chuman acts\u201d in the\ncentral sense (freely chosen) but rather spontaneous and\nundeliberated. Nor is it that chosen acts must be immediately preceded\nby choice: many of one\u2019s acts are the carrying out of choices\nwhich were made in the past and need not be now renewed or repeated\nsince no alternative option appears attractive. It is that one can be\nand often is in such a position that, confronted by two or more\nattractive possibilities (including perhaps the option of \u201cdoing\nnothing\u201d), there is nothing either within or outside one\u2019s\npersonal constitution that determines (settles) one\u2019s choice,\nother than the choosing: Mal. q. 6. This conception of free\nchoice (liberum arbitrium or libera electio) is much\nstronger than Aristotle\u2019s, on whose conception free choices are\nfree only from external determining factors. Aquinas\u2019\nconception of free choice is also incompatible with modern notions of\nsoft determinism, or the supposed compatibility of human\nresponsibility (and of the sense [self-understanding] that\none is freely choosing) with determination of every event by laws\n(e.g. physical) of nature. Aquinas understands the freedom of our free\nchoices to be a reality as primary and metaphysically and conceptually\nirreducible as the reality of physical laws, and he puts all his\nreflections on morality and practical reason under the heading of\n\u201cmastery over one\u2019s own acts\u201d (ST I-II,\nprologue).\n\nHe is also insistent that if there were no such freedom and\nself-determination, there could be no responsibility (fault, merit,\netc.), and no sense or content to any ought (normativity)\nsuch as ethics is concerned with.\n2.1.1 Choice, intention and act-descriptions\n\nAquinas pulls together into a powerful (though confusingly expounded)\nsynthesis a long tradition of analysis of the elements of\nunderstanding (reason) and intelligent response (will) that constitute\ndeliberation, choice, and execution of choice: ST I-II qq.\n6\u201317. The analysis shows the centrality of intention in the\nassessment of options and actions. In a narrow sense of the word,\nintention is always of ends and choice is of means;\nbut since every means (save the means most proximate to sheer trying\nor exertion) is also an end relative to a more proximate means, what\nis chosen when one adopts one of two or more proposals (for\none\u2019s action) that one has shaped in one\u2019s deliberation is\nrightly, though more broadly, said to be what one intends, what one\ndoes intentionally or with intent(ion), and so forth. An act(ion) is\nparadigmatically what it is intended to be; that is, its morally\nprimary description \u2013 prior to any moral evaluation or predicate\n\u2013 is the description it had in the deliberation by which one\nshaped the proposal to act thus. Aquinas\u2019 way of saying\nthis is: acts are specified by \u2013 have their specific\ncharacter from \u2013 their objects, where \u201cobjects\u201d\nhas the focal meaning of proximate end as envisaged by the\ndeliberating and acting person. Of course, the behavior involved in\nthat act can be given other descriptions in the light of conventions\nof description, or expectations and responsibilities, and so forth,\nand one or other these descriptions may be given priority by law,\ncustom, or some other special interest or perspective. But it is\nprimarily on acts qua intended, or on the acts (e.g. of\ntaking care) that one ought to have intended, that ethical standards\n(moral principles and precepts) bear. To repeat: in the preceding\nsentence \u201cintended\u201d is used in the broad sense; Aquinas\nsometimes employs it this way (e.g. ST II-II q. 64 a. 7),\nthough in his official synthesis the word is used in the narrower\nsense to signify the (further) intention with which the\nact\u2019s object was chosen \u2013 object being the most proximate\nof one\u2019s (broad sense) intentions.\n\nThis understanding of human action has often been misappropriated by\ninterpreters who have assumed that when Aquinas says that acts are\nwrongful by reason of their \u201cundue matter\u201d (indebita\nmateria), he refers to an item of behavior specifiable by its\nphysical characteristics and causal structure. So, for example,\ndirect killing of the innocent is taken to refer to\nbehavior whose causally immediate effect is killing, or which has its\nlethal effect before it has its intended good effect. But this is\nincompatible with Aquinas\u2019 fundamental and consistent positions\nabout human action. The \u201cmatter\u201d of a morally significant\nact is, for him, its immediate object under the description it has in\none\u2019s deliberation: Mal. q. 7 a. 1; q. 2 a. 4 ad 5; a.\n6; a. 7 ad 8. It is, in other words, not an item of behavior\nconsidered in its observable physicality as such, but rather\none\u2019s behavior as one\u2019s objective (or the most proximate\nof one\u2019s objectives), that is, as one envisages it, adopts it by\nchoice, and causes it by one\u2019s effort to do so. The most\nobjective account of human action is provided by the account that is\nmost subjective. This sound account will, however, set aside any\ndistorted act-descriptions that one may offer others, or even oneself,\nas rationalizations and exculpations of one\u2019s choice and act,\nbut that do not correspond to what really made the option attractive,\nas end or as means, and so was treated, in one\u2019s actual course\nof deliberation, as one\u2019s reason for acting as one did. The\nimmediately and foreseen lethal effect of an act of self-defense may\ngenuinely be a side-effect of one\u2019s choosing to stop the attack\nby the only available efficacious means (ST II-II q. 64 a.\n7), or it may be one\u2019s precise object (and the\n\u201cmatter\u201d of one\u2019s choice and act) because\none\u2019s (further) intent was to take lethal revenge on an old\nenemy, or to deter potential assailants by the prospect of their\ndeath, or to win a reward. Behaviorally identical items of behavior\nmay thus be very different human acts, discernible only by knowing the\nacting person\u2019s reasons for acting.\n2.2 Context: the open horizon of human life as a whole\n\nEthical standards, for which practical reason\u2019s first principles\nprovide the foundations or sources, concern actions as choosable and\nself-determining. They are thus to be distinguished clearly, as\nAristotle already emphasized, from standards which are practical,\nrational, and normative in a different way, namely the technical or\ntechnological standards internal to every art, craft, or other system\nfor mastering matter. Aquinas locates the significant and irreducible\ndifference between ethics and all these forms of \u201cart\u201d in\nthree features: (i) Moral thought, even when most unselfishly\nconcerned with helping others through the good effects of physical\neffort and causality, is fundamentally concerned with the problem of\nbringing order into one\u2019s own will, action, and character,\nrather than the problem of how to bring order into the world beyond\none\u2019s will. (ii) Correspondingly, the effects of morally\nsignificant free choices (good or evil) are in the first instance\nintransitive (i.e., effects on the will and character of the acting\nperson). Only secondarily are they transitive effects on the world,\neven when that person\u2019s intentions are focused, as they normally\nshould be, on the benefits of those external effects. (iii) Whereas\nevery art and technique has a more or less limited objective (end)\nwhich can be accomplished by skillful deployment of the art, moral\nthought has in view an unlimited and common (shared) horizon or point,\nthat of \u201chuman life as a whole [finis communis totius\nhumanae vitae]\u201d (ST I-II q. 21 a. 2 ad 2), for\neach of one\u2019s morally significant choices (for good or evil) is\na choice to devote a part of one\u2019s single life to a purpose\nwhich could have been any of the whole open-ended range of purposes\nopen to human pursuit for the sake of benefiting all or any human\nbeing(s).\n2.3 At the origin of Ought\n\nPractical reason, in Aquinas\u2019 view, has both one absolutely\nfirst principle and many truly first principles: ST I-II q.\n94 a. 2. The absolutely first principle is formal and in a sense\ncontentless. Like the logical principle of non-contradiction which\ncontrols all rational thought, it expresses, one might say, the\npressure of reason and is so far from being empty of significance and\nforce that its form may be regarded as the frame, and its normativity\nthe source, for all the normativity of the substantive first\nprinciples and of the moral principles which are inferable from them.\nAquinas articulates it as \u201cGood is to be done and pursued, and\nbad avoided\u201d (ibid.).\n\nThis has often been truncated to (i) \u201cGood is to be done, and\nevil avoided\u201d or even, more drastically, (iia) \u201cDo good\nand avoid evil\u201d or yet more drastically (iib) \u201cAvoid evil\nand seek the good\u201d. But Grisez 1963 gave reason to think these\nabbreviations both exegetically and philosophically unsound. The first\npractical principle is not a command or imperative as (ii) would have\nit, nor is it a moral principle as all these formulae suggest by\nomitting \u201cto be pursued\u201d (see 2.7 below). Both in grammar\nand in propositional content, the principle\u2019s gerundive\n\u201cis-to-be\u201d is neither imperative nor predictive, but\nrationally directive \u2013 an ought \u2013 in the way that\ngets its fully developed and central sense and normativity in the more\nspecified ought of moral standards.\n\nAgainst a Kantian or neo-Kantian primacy or ultimacy of\n\u201cstructures of mind\u201d, Aquinas would say that just as the\npressure of reason articulated in the principle of non-contradiction\nhas its source in the structure of reality \u2013 in the real\nopposition between being and not being \u2013 so\nthe source of the equivalently first practical principle is the real\ndesirability of intelligible goods, and the true\nundesirability of what is not good.\n2.4 First principles of practical reason\n\nIf Plato and Aristotle fail to articulate substantive first principles\nof practical reason, and if Kant overlooks them in favor of the\nquasi-Humeian notions of motivation that dominate ethics during the\nEnlightenment (and ever since), the articulation of such principles by\nAquinas deserves attention.\n2.4.1 First principles are insights into the data of experience and understood possibility\n\nEach of the several substantive first principles of practical reason\npicks out and directs one towards a distinct intelligible good which,\nin line with the primariness of the principle identifying it, can be\ncalled \u201cbasic\u201d (not a term used by Aquinas). Aquinas\nregards each of the first practical principles as self-evident\n(per se notum: known through itself) and undeduced\n(primum and indemonstrabile). He does not, however,\nmean that they are data-less \u201cintuitions\u201d; even the\nindemonstrable first principles in any field of human knowledge are\nknowable only by insight (intellectus) into data of\nexperience (here, of causality and inclination).\n\nMoreover, when describing the first practical principles as\nself-evident, Aquinas emphasises that self-evidence is relative: what\nis not obvious to some will be self-evident to those who have more\nample experience and a better understanding of other aspects of the\nmatter. And we should expect our understanding of first principles to\ngrow as we come to understand more about the objects to which they\nrefer and direct (e.g. knowledge, human life, marriage, etc.).\n2.4.2 Their Oughts are not inferred from any Is\n\nAquinas\u2019s repeated affirmation that practical reason\u2019s\nfirst principles are undeduced refutes the common accusation or\nassumption that his ethics invalidly attempts to deduce or infer\nought from is, for his affirmation entails that the\nsources of all relevant oughts cannot be deduced from any\nis. There remain, however, a number of contemporary Thomists\nwho deny that such a deduction or inference need be fallacious, and\nregard Aquinas as postulating some such deduction or inference. They\nare challenged., however, by others (such as Rhonheimer, Boyle, and\nFinnis) who, while sharing the view that his ethics is in these\nrespects fundamentally sound, deny that Aquinas attempted or\npostulated any such deduction or inference, and ask for some\ndemonstration (i) that he did and (ii) that he or anyone else could\nmake such a deduction or inference.\n\nThese critics reinforce their denial by pointing out that in his\nprologue to his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Ethics,\nAquinas teaches that knowledge of things that are what they are\nindependently of our thought (i.e. of nature) is fundamentally\ndistinct both from logic and from practical knowledge, one of whose\ntwo species is philosophia moralis (whose first principles or\nfundamental oughts are under discussion here)\n2.4.3 A sample first principle: Knowledge is pursuit-worthy\n\nAquinas neglects to spell out how these first principles come to be\nunderstood. But he holds that they are understood and accepted by\neveryone who has enough experience to understand their terms. The\nprocess of coming to understand a first practical principle may be\nexemplified as follows, in relation to the basic good of knowledge. As\na child one experiences the inclination to ask questions, and to greet\napparently satisfactory answers with satisfaction and failure to\nanswer as a disappointment. At some point one comes to understand\n\u2013 has the insight \u2013 that such answers are instances of a\nquite general standing possibility, namely knowledge, coming to know\nand overcoming ignorance. By a distinct though often well nigh\nsimultaneous further insight one comes to understand that this \u2013\nknowledge \u2013 is not merely a possibility but also a good\n[bonum], that is to say an opportunity, a\nbenefit, something desirable as a kind of improvement (a\nperfectio) of one\u2019s or anyone\u2019s condition, and as\nto be pursued.\n2.5 The other basic goods\n\nThe basic human goods which first practical principles identify and\ndirect us to are identified by Aquinas as (i) life, (ii)\n\u201cmarriage between man and woman and bringing up of children\n[coniunctio maris et feminae et educatio liberorum]\u201d\n(not at all reducible to \u201cprocreation\u201d), (iii) knowledge,\n(iv) living in fellowship (societas and amicitia)\nwith others, (v) practical reasonableness (bonum rationis)\nitself, and (vi) knowing and relating appropriately to the\ntranscendent cause of all being, value, normativity and efficacious\naction (ST I-II q. 94 aa. 2 & 3). His lists are always\nexplicitly open-ended. They sketch the outlines and elements of the\nflourishing of the human persons in whom they can be actualized. Even\ncomplete fulfillment \u2013 the beatitudo perfecta that\nAquinas places firmly outside our natural capacities and this mortal\nlife \u2013 could not be regarded as a further good, but rather as a\nsynthesis and heightened actualization of these basic goods in the\nmanner appropriate to a form of life free from both immaturity (and\nother incidents of procreation) and decay.\n\nSimilarly, as is entailed by the epistemological principle that nature\nis known by capacities, capacities by acts, and acts by their objects\n(see 1.1(v) above), these basic goods, being the basic objects of will\nand free action, are the outline of human nature. The is of\nan adequate account of human nature is dependent upon prior grasp of\nthe oughts of practical reason\u2019s first,\ngood-identifying principles, even though that prior grasp was made\npossible by that partial understanding of human nature which comes\nwith an understanding of certain lines of causality and possibility.\nBut defending the epistemological priority of the intelligible objects\nof will in explanations of practical reason does not entail (contrast\nMcInerny 1992) any denial of the metaphysical priority of the\nnaturally given facts about the human makeup.\n2.6 Known by (or from) inclination?\n\nMany modern accounts of Aquinas\u2019 theory of natural law give\nexplanatory primacy to the naturalness of the inclinations (to live,\nto know, etc.) that correspond to these basic goods. But others regard\nthis as a fundamental misunderstanding of Aquinas\u2019 conception of\nwill, and of the epistemological relationship between nature and\nreason. Will is for him intelligent response to intelligible good:\none\u2019s will is \u201cin\u201d one\u2019s reason [voluntas\nin ratione]. He makes it very explicit both that human actions\nare rightly said to be natural (in the morally relevant sense of\n\u201cnatural\u201d) when and because they are intelligent and\nreasonable (ST I-II q. 71 a. 2), and that there are\ninclinations which are natural, in the sense that they are commonly\nfound or characterize some or even most individuals, yet are unnatural\nbecause lacking any intelligibly good object. So explanatory priority\nmust be accorded to the basic human goods themselves, and to the\nself-evident desirability which makes each of them the object of an\ninclination in the will of anyone sufficiently intelligent and mature\nto understand their goodness (that is, the way they make human beings\nmore fulfilled, more \u201cperfect\u201d [complete]). An inclination\nof that kind is relevant in practical reason because its object is\ndesirable, and desirable because it would contribute to anyone\u2019s\nflourishing. To say this is not to say that our natural inclinations\nto what contributes to our flourishing are mere accident or\nhappenstance.\n2.7 Only incipiently moral\n\nMany nineteenth- and early twentieth century accounts of Aquinas took\nit that the first principles of practical reason, which he regularly\ncalls first principles of natural law or natural right, are moral\nprinciples picking out kinds of human act as to be done (e.g.\nalms-giving to the poor) or not done (e.g. murder, adultery), in the\nmanner of the Commandments. But though there are a few passages in\nwhich Aquinas himself speaks in that way, they can be read down so as\nto make them consistent with the more strategic passages in which he\nspeaks of such moral principles or norms as \u201cderived\u201d\nconclusions from first principles. (See also 3.3 below.) Even immoral\npeople so blinded by culture or disposition that they do not make\nthese inferences nevertheless can and normally do understand the\nfirst principles of practical reason and are guided by them,\nthough imperfectly, in their deliberations.\n\nAgainst Kant\u2019s assumption that, since the ends toward which one\nwishes to act are subjective because projected, and established in\none\u2019s deliberating and willingness (as Hume proposed), by\none\u2019s subrational desires, practical reason\u2019s function is\nto limit and channel one\u2019s pursuit of those ends, Aquinas\nconsiders that practical reason\u2019s first and fundamental\noperation is not limiting, confining or negative but rather\nfacilitating and positive: finding and constructing intelligible ends\nto be pursued (prosequenda), ends that give intelligent point\nto our behavior.\n\nThe thesis that the first practical principles are only incipiently\nmoral should not be confused with the widespread modern opinion that\npractical reason\u2019s default position is self-interest or\n\u201cprudential\u201d reason, so that there is a puzzle about how\none transits from this to morality. In Aquinas\u2019 classical view,\none\u2019s reason (as distinct from some of one\u2019s customary\nways of thinking) naturally understands the primary or basic goods as\ngood for anyone, and further understands that it is good to\nparticipate in the many forms of friendship which require that one set\naside all merely emotionally motivated self-preference.\n3. Moral principles\n\nThe discerning, inferring and elaborating of moral principles is a\ntask for practical reasonableness. The judgments one makes in doing\nthis are together called one\u2019s conscience, in a sense\nprior to the sense in which conscience is the judgments one passes or\ncould pass on one\u2019s own acts considered retrospectively. Someone\nwhose conscience is sound has in place the basic elements of sound\njudgment and practical reasonableness, that is of the intellectual and\nmoral virtue which Aquinas calls prudentia. Full\nprudentia requires that one put one\u2019s sound judgment\ninto effect all the way down, i.e. into the particulars of choice and\naction in the face of temptations to unreasonable but perhaps not\nunintelligent alternatives.\n3.1 Conscience\n\nConscience in Aquinas\u2019 view is not a special power or presence\nwithin us, but is our practical intelligence at work, primarily in the\nform of a stock of judgments about the reasonableness (rightness) or\nunreasonableness (wrongness) of kinds of action (kinds of option).\nSince each such judgment is of the form \u201c[It is true that]\naction of the kind phi is always [or generally] wrong [or: is\ngenerally to be done, etc.]\u201d or \u201cphi is [always]\n[or: generally] required [or forbidden] by reason\u201d, it must be\nthe case \u2013 as Aquinas stresses very forcefully \u2013 that\none\u2019s conscience is binding upon oneself even when it is utterly\nmistaken and directs or licenses awful misdeeds. For since it is\nlogically impossible that one could be aware that one\u2019s present\njudgment of conscience is mistaken, setting oneself against\none\u2019s own firm judgment of conscience is setting oneself against\nthe goods of truth and reasonableness, and that cannot fail to be\nwrong: ST I-II q. 19 a. 5; Ver. q. 17 a. 4. The fact\nthat, if one has formed one\u2019s judgment corruptly, one will also\nbe acting wrongly if one follows it (ST I-II q. 19 a. 6) does\nnot affect the obligatoriness (for oneself) of one\u2019s conscience.\nThis teaching about conscience was rather novel in his day and to this\nday is often misrepresented or misapplied as a kind of relativism or\nsubjectivism. But it is actually an implication of Aquinas\u2019\nclarity about the implications of regarding moral judgments as\ntrue (or false) and of thus rejecting subjectivism\nand relativism.\n3.2 The supreme moral principle\n\nAquinas is regrettably inexplicit about how the first practical\nprinciples yield moral principles, precepts or rules that have the\ncombined generality and specificity of the precepts found in the\nportion of the biblical Decalogue (Exod. 20.1\u201317;\nDeut. 5.6\u201321) traditionally called moral (the last\nseven precepts, e.g. parents should be reverenced, murder is wrong,\nadultery is wrong, etc.). But a reconstruction of his scattered\nstatements makes it clear enough that in his view a first implication\nof the array of first principles, each directing us to goods\nactualisable as much in others as in oneself, is this: that one should\nlove one\u2019s neighbor as oneself.\n\nSince he considers this principle, like the set of first principles\nmentioned in I-II q. 94 a. 2, to be self-evident (per se\nnotum), he must regard the principle of love-of-neighbor-as-self\nnot so much as an inference from, or even specification of, but rather\na redescriptive summary of that set. This in turn suggests the further\nreflection that the first principles, and the goods (bona) to\nwhich they direct us, are transparent, so to speak, for the\nflesh-and-blood persons in whom they are and can be instantiated.\nMoreover, it may be thought that the primary moral principle of love\nof neighbor as oneself is another reason to doubt (despite\nappearances) the strategic role of eudemonism in his ethics.\nAristotelianising interpretations of Aquinas\u2019 ethics normally\nmake central the notion of fulfillment, understood (it seems) as the\nfulfillment of the deliberating and acting person \u2013 to which the\nrequirement of neighbor love does not have a perspicuous relationship.\nGrisez and others, on the other hand, take it that the role of\nfulfillment (eudaimonia, beatitudo) in ethical\nthought\u2019s unfolding from the first principles of practical\nreason is best captured by a \u201cmaster moral principle\u201d\nclose though perhaps not identical to Aquinas\u2019s supreme moral\nprinciple: that all one\u2019s acts of will be open to integral\nhuman fulfillment, that is to the fulfillment of all human\npersons and communities now and in future.\n\nThe supreme moral principle of love of neighbor as self has, Aquinas\nthinks, an immediately proximate specification in the Golden Rule:\nOthers are to be treated by me as I would wish them to treat me. The\ntight relation between the love principle and the Golden Rule suggests\nthat love and justice, though analytically distinguishable, certainly\ncannot be contrasted as other and other. \u201cNeighbor\u201d\nexcludes no human being anywhere, insofar as anyone could be benefited\nby one\u2019s choices and actions. To love someone is essentially to\nwill that person\u2019s good. The reasonable priorities among all\nthese persons as objects of one\u2019s love, goodwill and care are\ndiscussed by Aquinas both as an \u201corder of love(s)\u201d\n[ordo amoris] and as a matter of right and justice.\n3.2.1 The fuller version: the place of the transcendent\n\nSince Aquinas thinks that the existence and providence of God, as the\ntranscendent source of all persons and benefits, is certain, his usual\nstatement of the master moral principle affirms that one should love\nGod and one\u2019s-neighbor-as-oneself. But since he accepts that the\nexistence of God is not self-evident, he can allow that the more\nstrictly self-evident form of the master moral principle refers only\nto love of human persons (self and neighbors). He would add that, once\nthe existence and nature of God is accepted, as it philosophically\nshould be, the rational requirement of loving God, and thus the fuller\nversion of the master moral principle, is self-evident. He also holds\nthat one does not offend against this requirement of loving God except\nby making choices contrary to human good, that is, to love of self or\nneighbor: ScG III c. 122 n. 2.\n3.3 Moral precepts are further specifications of this master principle and its immediate specifications\n\nAll moral principles and norms, Aquinas thinks, can be inferred\n\u2013 as either implicit in, or \u201creferable to\u201d as\nconclusions from \u2013 the moral first principle of love of neighbor\nas self: ST I-II q. 99 a. 1 ad 2 with q. 91 a. 4c and q. 100\na. 2 ad 2; q. 100 aa. 3 and 11c. But he never displays an example or\nschema of these deduction-like inferences. Consequently, as noted in\n2.7 above, his would-be successors have sometimes proposed that moral\nprinciples and norms have the self-evidence of first principles, and\nsometimes, equally desperately, have offered premises which, though\nsuggested by some of Aquinas\u2019s argumentation or remarks, are\nincoherent with his general theory \u2013 e.g. that natural functions\nare not to be frustrated.\n\nThe main lines of Aquinas\u2019 theory of moral principles strongly\nsuggest that moral norms (precepts, standards) are specifications of\n\u201cGood is to be done and pursued, and evil avoided\u201d,\nspecifications which so direct choice and action that each of the\nprimary goods (elements of human fulfillment) will be respected and\npromoted to the extent required by the good of practical\nreasonableness (bonum rationis). And what practical\nreasonableness requires seems to be that each of the basic human goods\nbe treated as what it truly is: a basic reason for action amongst\nother basic reasons whose integral directiveness is not to be\ncut down or deflected by subrational passions. The principle of love\nof neighbor as self and the Golden Rule immediately pick out one\nelement in that integral directiveness. The other framework moral\nrules give moral direction by stating ways in which more or less\nspecific types of choice are immediately or mediately\ncontrary to some basic good. This appears to be Aquinas\u2019s\nimplicit method, as illustrated below (3.4).\n\nAn adequate exposition and defence of the moral norms upheld by\nAquinas requires a critique, only hints for which can be found in his\nwork, of theories which claim that choice can and should rationally be\nguided by a utilitarian, consequentialist or proportionalist master\nprinciple calling for maximizing of overall net good (or, some say,\nincompatibly, for minimizing net evils). In developments of\nAquinas\u2019s moral theory such as are proposed by Grisez and\nFinnis, that critique is treated as an indispensable preliminary to\nany reflective non-question-begging identification of the route from\nfirst principles to specific moral norms.\n3.4 Some examples\n\nThe three examples or sets of examples considered in this section are\nonly examples of the kinds of moral norms (praecepta) which\nAquinas considers are excluded by any sound conscience from\none\u2019s deliberations about what to choose. Other examples are\nmore complex, such as theft and various other wrongful deprivations of\nproperty, and the form of charging for loans which is named usury and\njudged by Aquinas (not implausibly, though with little direct\napplicability to developed financial markets: see Finnis 1998,\n204\u2013210) to be always contrary to just equality. Aquinas also\ntreats in some detail scores, indeed hundreds of other moral issues,\ntouching the life of judges, advocates, merchants, the rich, the poor,\nor everyone.\n3.4.1 Homicide\n\nSome types of act are intrinsically and immediately contrary to the\nbasic human good of life, that is to a human being\u2019s very being.\nEvery act which is intended, whether as end or as means, to kill an\ninnocent human being, and every act done by a private person which is\nintended to kill any human being, is to be excluded from\ndeliberation as wrongful because contrary to love of neighbor as self\n(or self as neighbor). Public persons, Aquinas thinks, can rightfully\nintend to kill in carrying out needful acts of war, suppression of\nserious wrongdoing, and punishment (see also 6.3 below).\n\nAs a private person one may rightfully use force in defense of oneself\nor others even if the force is such that one foresees it is likely or\neven certain to kill; but one\u2019s intention in using such lethal\nforce must not be to kill, but only to disable and block the attack\n(and less lethal force would not have met the need for defensive\nblocking of the assault). Aquinas\u2019 discussion of this\n(ST II-II q. 64 a.7) is the locus classicus for what later\nbecame known, unhappily, as the \u201cprinciple\u201d of double\neffect, whose real core is the thought that moral principles bear\ndifferently on kinds of action specified by intention (e.g.\nto kill) from the way they bear on behavior chosen with\nforesight that it will (probably or even certainly) kill\nas a side-effect (praeter intentionem \u2013\noutside the acting person\u2019s intention).\n\nAquinas wavers between suggesting that the use of lethal public force,\ne.g. in capital punishment, intends (\u201cis referred to\u201d)\njustice rather than killing, and plainly accepting that in such cases\ndeath is indeed intended. The latter is his dominant position; his\narguments to justify a kind of choice which, whatever its beneficial\nconsequences, is so immediately against the good of life have come\nincreasingly to seem insufficient: the Catechism of the Catholic\nChurch (1993), paras. 2263\u201367 expounds its whole teaching\non war, lethal police action, and capital punishment on the basis of\nthe thought that these can be justified only so far as they amount to\ncausing death as a side-effect, and not as killing with intent to\nkill. The thought is formulated by appeal to Aquinas\u2019 reference\nto acts with \u201cdouble effect\u201d in his discussion of\nprivate defence in ST II-II q. 64 a. 7.\n3.4.2 Adultery and other kinds of act contrary to the good of marriage\n\nMarriage is, Aquinas says, a primary human good and, philosophically\nconsidered, it has a dual point (end, finis): (i) the\nprocreation and bringing up of children is a manner suited to their\ngood, and (ii) fides, which goes far beyond the literal\ntranslation \u201cfaithfulness\u201d and includes not only\nexclusivity and permanence but also the positive readiness and\ncommitment to being united with one\u2019s spouse in mind, body and a\nmutually assisting domestic life. Aquinas neither subordinates one of\nthese two \u201cends\u201d to the other, nor regards it as\nappropriate to choose to divide them. Fides is a good and\nsufficient reason for engaging in the usus matrimonii, the\nkind of sexual act that is intended to enable both husband and wife to\nexperience and in a particular way actualize and express the good of\ntheir marriage, so that the act\u2019s giving and receiving of\ndelight is token of their commitment.\n\nConsequently the kind of wrongful sexual choice most often considered\nby Aquinas is engaging in intercourse with one\u2019s spouse without\nfides, because one either (i) is thinking of one\u2019s\nspouse in the way one would think of a prostitute, or (significantly\nworse) (ii) would be willing to have sex with somebody else if some\nother attractive person were to be available. Such depersonalized sex\nacts are instances of willing against the good of marriage (contra\nbonum matrimonii). This reiterated analysis should be regarded as\nthe key to Aquinas\u2019 sex ethics. Another paradigmatic kind of\ninstance, in itself much more serious, is a married person\u2019s\nchoice to have intercourse with some third party (perhaps with the\nother spouse\u2019s consent). These and all other wrongful kinds of\nsex act have their wrongfulness, according to Aquinas, not because\nthey are unnatural in some biological or sociological sense of\n\u201cunnatural\u201d, but because they are against reason\u2019s\ndirective to respect, if not also pursue, the good of marriage, a\nrespect that calls for reserving to marriage (and within marriage to\ntruly marital intercourse) all uses of one\u2019s capacity to engage\nin the intentional pursuit of sexual satisfaction. For unless one\nregards such reservation as required, one\u2019s stance about human\nsex acts is contra bonum matrimonii and unreasonable because\none cannot coherently maintain that the intercourse of the married\nenables them to actualize and experience their fides and\ntheir marriage, a thought essential to the flourishing\n(bonum) of marriage and thus of children and thus of the\nwider community as a whole. One measure of the gravity of morally bad\nsex acts is applicable to some kinds but not others: injustice (as in\nrape or seduction of the vulnerable). Another measure, applicable to\nall such acts, is the extent of the deviance (\u201cdistance\u201d)\nbetween acts of that kind and truly marital acts.\n\nAs in ours, many in Aquinas\u2019 milieu found it difficult to\nunderstand how mutually agreeable sex could be a serious moral issue,\nor indeed a moral issue at all. Aquinas noted this, but was clear that\nevery kind of conduct that acts out and thus confirms and reinforces a\ndisposition of will contra bonum matrimonii is seriously\nwrong because so many aspects of individual and social flourishing\nprofoundly depend upon the health of the institution of marriage, as\nit exists in the real lives of adults and children. It is worth\nrepeating, since the point is so often misunderstood and misreported,\nthat Aquinas\u2019 moral arguments for distinguishing good from bad\nsex never run from \u201cnatural\u201d to \u201ctherefore\ngood/reasonable/right\u201d, but always from\n\u201cgood/reasonable/right\u201d to therefore \u201cnatural\u201d\n(and similarly, of course, for unreasonable and unnatural): see II-II\nq. 153 a. 2c, a. 3c, q. 154 a. 1c, a. 2 ad 2, a. 11.\n3.4.3 Lying\n\nAquinas\u2019 thesis is that lying, properly defined, is always to be\nexcluded as to some extent wrong. The thesis is often misunderstood as\nbeing premised on the thought that lying is contrary to the natural\nfunction of tongue or speech, a thought that has often been transposed\ninto an effort to explain his theses about the wrong kinds of sex act.\nBut, as has been seen, his sex ethics has another and more plausible\nbasis, and so, it seems (albeit less clearly), has his ethics of\nlying. Though all his treatments include something like \u201cwords\nare naturally signs of what one understand\u201d (ST II-II q. 110 a.\n3) or \u201cspeech was invented for expressing the conceptions in\none\u2019s heart\u201d (Sent. III d. 38 a. 3c), this\nstatement is pointing to a more explanatory and prior premise,\ndiscernible though never adequately articulated so as to show its\nrelation to basic human goods. This prior premise turns on his\ndefinition of lying as one\u2019s assertion of what one\nbelieves to be false. Whenever one asserts, one affirms as true two\npropositions: explicitly the proposition one articulates as true\ndespite one\u2019s belief that it is not, and implicitly the\nproposition that one believes what one is assertively articulating. So\nAquinas seems to locate the essential wrongfulness of lying in this\nintentional dissonance between the self presented or reported\nand one\u2019s real self: a duplicitas. It is often\nreasonable and even morally necessary to hide one\u2019s beliefs, and\nthis, not \u201cdeception\u201d, is what Aquinas means by the\n\u201cprudent dissimulatio\u201d he thinks justifiable in\nappropriate contexts. But one should not do so by the spurious\nself-projection entailed by asserting what one believes false.\nPretended flight as a device for luring an unjust enemy into an ambush\ncan be right in a just war, but lying to the enemy is wrong, although\nits gravity is much diminished by the duty not to reveal the truth to\nthe enemy, a duty compatible with the coexisting duty not to lie.\nSubsequent scholars in his tradition have wondered whether the\nconditions of discourse with an unjust opponent do not, at least in\nmany circumstances, defeat the presumption that a grammatically\nindicative statement asserts what it is put forward to seem\nto assert.\n3.4.4 Exceptionless negative norms: more urgent though not all or always more important\n\nNegative norms such as the three sets of norms just discussed are more\nurgent and direct as implications of love of self and neighbor, but\nare not necessarily more important in other dimensions of importance.\nThat is to say, they are applicable and to be followed semper et\nad semper, always and in all circumstances, whereas the\napplicability of affirmative norms (requiring one to act in a\nspecified kind of way) is semper sed non ad semper: always\napplicable subject to there being (as is not always the case) suitable\ncircumstances. Kinds of conduct that are contrary to a negative moral\nnorm of this type are \u201cintrinsically wrongful\u201d\n(intrinsece mala).\n\nOnly negative norms can be exceptionless (and not all negative moral\nnorms are). If affirmative norms could be exceptionless, there would\nbe inescapable conflicts of obligation, but since morality is simply\n(the set of standards of) full reasonableness, there can be no\nconflict of duties each truly and inescapably obligatory in one and\nthe same situation: one cannot truly be perplexus simpliciter\n\u2013 that is, in a dilemma such that, through no fault of\none\u2019s own, any choice one makes will be immoral. (It is,\nhowever, possible that my prior wrongful choices or my culpable\nnegligence in forming my conscience put me into a situation such that\nI have applicable and irreconcilable duties and will be in breach of\none or more of them whatever I choose or do or omit: I am then\nperplexus secundum quid, that is, in a dilemma but of a\nqualified, derivative kind, only in a weak sense unavoidable.)\n4. Virtues\n\nA virtue is an aspect of, or constitutive element in, being a person\nof good character. To have the virtues is to have a stable and ready\nwillingness to make choices that are morally good because in line with\nthe bonum rationis, the basic good of practical\nreasonableness.\n4.1 Specified by principles identifying the reasonable \u201cmean\u201d\n\nThe virtues, like everything else in one\u2019s will, are a response\nto reasons. But practical reasons (i.e. reasons for action) are\npropositional: they can be stated as principles and other standards,\nmore or less specific. So principles, ultimately the first principles\nof practical reason (that is, of natural law), are more fundamental to\nethics than virtues are. Aquinas accepts Aristotle\u2019s notion that\nevery virtue is a mean between too much and too little, and he\nconstantly stresses that it is reason \u2013 with the principles and\nrules (regulae) it understands \u2013 that settles the mean\nand thus determines what is too much or too little. Indeed, the\nprinciples of practical reason (natural law) establish the ends of the\nvirtues: ST II-II q. 47 a. 6. And the master virtue of\nbringing practical reasonableness into all one\u2019s deliberations,\nchoices, and carrying out of choices \u2013 the virtue of\nprudentia, a virtue both intellectual (of one\u2019s\nintelligence) and moral (of one\u2019s whole will and character)\n\u2013 is part of the definition, content, and influence of every\nother moral virtue: ST I-II q. 65 a. 1, q. 66 a. 3 ad 3,\netc.\n\nAquinas arranged the Summa Theologiae\u2019s exposition of\nmorality within a classification, not of the goods to which rational\nacts are directed, nor of types of act, nor of practical\nreason\u2019s standards, but of the virtues. Explicable as a\nreflective theological project of depicting the flourishing or\ndeviations of human beings in an account of the whole movement of\ncreature from their origin to their fulfillment, his decision to adopt\nthis superstructure has tended to obscure the real foundations of his\nethics. As one would expect from the considerations sketched in the\npreceding paragraph, his actual arguments about what is right and\nwrong, virtuous or vicious, get their premises not from analysis of\nthe virtues at stake but rather from the principles and more specific\nstandards, norms, precepts or rules of practical reason(ableness). It\nis the conclusions of these arguments that are then re-expressed in\nterms of what is contrary to or in line with one or more of the\nvirtues.\n4.2 Virtue can also be a source, rather than conclusion, of moral judgment\n\nOne\u2019s affirmative responsibilities are all conditioned by\ncircumstances, and mostly are (conditional) implications of the Golden\nRule of doing to or for others what you would wish them to do\nto or for you. For both these reasons, one cannot make sound judgments\nabout what one should be doing \u2013 that is, about what is the\n\u201cmean\u201d of reasonableness \u2013 unless one\u2019s wishes\nare those of a person who understands the opportunities and the\ncircumstances well, and whose concerns and intentions are those of\nsomeone whose reasonableness is not corrupted or deflected either by\nsub-rational desires and aversions or by deformations of will such as\npride or presumption. Such a person has the virtues, intellectual and\nmoral, and virtue is thus, and in these respects, required for sound\nmoral judgment. Sometimes the mean of reason, properly assessed by\nsomeone of true virtue, calls for heroic virtue (say, immense courage)\nfar beyond conventional measures or expectations of reasonableness,\nmoderation, and the like.\n4.2.1 The interdependence of the virtues\n\nAquinas firmly holds the Platonic-Aristotelian theses (i) of the\nconnexio virtutum: that to have any of the virtues in its\nfull and proper form one must have all of them, and (ii) of the\ngoverning and shaping role of (the good of) practical reasonableness\n(bonum rationis), that is, of the intellectual and moral\nvirtue of prudentia. For some indication why, see 4.4\nbelow..\n4.3 Virtue\u2019s priority not reducible to self-fulfillment\n\nJust as some take Aquinas to hold that concern for one\u2019s own\nhappiness is the source of one\u2019s moral motivation and judgment,\nso some take him to hold that the point of being virtuous is being\nvirtuous. But a sounder reading may understand him to hold that\nattaining beatitudo and virtus are more like\nbuilt-in beneficial side-effects of openness to the beatitudo\nof everyone \u2013 that is, of love of neighbor as oneself, according\nto a reasonable order of priorities. What virtue (the state of\ncharacter) is praised for, he says, is its actualizing the good of\nreason(ableness), and reason is good because it enables one to discern\nthings for what they truly are \u2013 and so, in the practical\ndomain, to discern real benefits (bona, opportunities) and\ndirect one\u2019s choices and actions to bringing them about in the\nreal people for whom one thereby makes effective one\u2019s love and\nrespect.\n4.4 The cardinal virtues\n\nAquinas accepts the Platonic-Aristotelian thesis that there are four\nvirtues which are cardinal, that is on which the moral life and all\nother virtues hinge or depend: prudentia, justice, courage,\nand temperantia. Each is a strategic element in one\u2019s\nintegrating of the good of practical reasonableness into one\u2019s\ndeliberations, choices and execution of choices (prudentia),\nin one\u2019s dealings with others justice), and in integrating and\ngoverning one\u2019s desires by genuine reasons\n(temperantia) and enabling one to face down intimidating\nobstacles (courage, fortitudo).\n4.4.1 Prudentia and love\n\nPractical reasonableness involves not only (i) an intelligent and\nrationally integrated understanding of practical reason\u2019s\nprinciples and of the implications that, under the auspices of the\nmaster principle of love of neighbor as self, they have in the form of\nmoral standards, but also (ii) the personal self-governance needed to\nput those conscientious judgments into effect by choices and\ncorresponding action. So prudentia has many phases or, as\nAquinas says, parts, and enters into every other virtue. It is far\nremoved from \u201cprudence\u201d in the sense of \u201crational\nself-interest\u201d, for by prudentia one is actively aware\nthat self-interest is self-stunting or indeed self-destructive unless\none transcends it by one\u2019s dispositions and acts of justice and\nfriendship or love. (And see 2.7 above.)\n\nAlthough Aquinas subscribes to Aristotle\u2019s thesis that practical\nreasonableness (phronesis, prudentia) concerns means\nrather than ends, he eliminates any quasi-Humeian reading of that\nthesis by emphasizing that what \u201cmoves\u201d prudentia\nis not one\u2019s passions but one\u2019s underivative understanding\nof the first practical principles and of the intelligible goods to\nwhich they point (synderesis movet prudentiam: ST\nII-II q. 47 a. 6 ad 3). Moreover, since he holds that virtually all\nmeans are also ends, the Aristotelian thesis in no way inhibits him\nfrom holding that prudentia is what guides one in identifying\nmoral standards and the \u201cmean\u201d of every virtue:\nprudentia \u201cdirects the moral virtues not only in\nchoosing means but also in establishing ends\u201d: I-II q. 66 a. 3\nad 3.\n4.4.2 Justice\n\nJustice is the steady and lasting willingness to give to others what\nthey are entitled to (their right: jus [or ius]\nsuum). Aquinas works with this Roman Law definition\n(ST II-II q. 58 a. 1c), and with Aristotle\u2019s division\nof justice into (i) distributive (good judgment about how to\ndivide up and parcel out beneficial or burdensome wholes or sets in a\nway that is fair because guided by appropriate criteria) and (ii) what\nAquinas calls commutative justice (good judgment going far\nwider than Aristotle\u2019s \u201ccorrective\u201d justice, and\nconcerned with all other kinds of dealings between persons). His\nprioritizing of the concept of right (jus), conceived as\nsomething that belongs to another, brings him to the brink of\narticulating a concept of human rights, a concept certainly implicit\nin his thesis that there are precepts of justice each imposing, on me\nand my communities, a duty to everyone without discrimination\n(indifferenter omnibus debitum: ST II-II q. 122 a.\n6). For his definition of justice immediately entails that correlative\nto such duties of justice there must be rights that belong to everyone\nindifferenter. Many duties of justice are positive\n(affirmative duties to give, do, etc.), and Aquinas treats the duties\nof relieving poverty both under justice and under love (of neighbor,\nfor God\u2019s sake). The duties in either case are essentially the\nsame, and Aquinas\u2019 understanding of them strongly affects his\nunderstanding of justified private property rights, which are valid\nbecause needed for prosperity and development, but are subject to a\nduty to distribute, directly or indirectly, one\u2019s\nsuperflua \u2013 that is, everything beyond what one needs\nto keep oneself and one\u2019s family in the state of life\nappropriate to one\u2019s (and their) vocation(s). For the natural\nresources of the world are \u201cby nature\u201d common; that is,\nreason\u2019s principles do not identify anyone as having a prior\nclaim to them other than under some customary or other socially\nposited scheme for division and appropriation of such resources, and\nsuch schemes could not be morally authoritative unless they\nacknowledged some such duty to distribute one\u2019s\nsuperflua.\n4.4.3 Fortitudo and temperantia\n\nThough one\u2019s passions, that is one\u2019s emotional desires and\naversions, support one\u2019s reason in deliberation, choice and\naction, they are also always capable of deflecting one from reasonable\nand right choice. So the ready disposition to keep these passions in\ntheir proper role is an essential element of a virtuous character and\nlife. By temperantia one integrates one\u2019s desires,\nparticularly but not only for sexual pleasure, with reason, lest\nreason be enslaved by passion and become its ingenious servant, as it\nreadily can. Temperantia is the mean, for example, between\nlust and frigidity or apathy (Aquinas everywhere rejecting any\n\u201cStoic\u201d ideal of passionlessness, and holding that there\nis good as well as bad concupiscentia).\n\nBy fortitudo one keeps one\u2019s aversions, particularly\nbut not only fear, in check lest one shirk one\u2019s moral\nresponsibilities in situations of danger or other adversity. It is the\nmean between recklessness or over-boldness and cowardice or\ndefeatism.\n4.5 \u201cVirtue ethics\u201d\n\nIn recent decades various philosophers and theologians have proposed\nthat ethics done well is virtue ethics, not an ethics of rules and\nprinciples. An ethics of the latter kind is denounced as legalistic.\nAs should be clear from the foregoing, Aquinas rejects the proposed\ncontrast and gives systematic prominence both to standards, such as\nprinciples and rules, and to virtues. He holds, in effect, that they\nare interdefined. Nor does he have any time for the view that there\nare no exceptionless moral norms and that moral norms or other\nstandards are no more than a kind of anticipation, shadow or\napproximation of the judgments which in each situation need to be made\nby a person of virtue, and which could never exclude in\nadvance any kind of act as always wrongful by reason of its\nobject and regardless of its further intentions or the circumstances\nof the situation. On the contrary, he holds that no human act is\nmorally good (right, in the sense of not wrong) unless it is in line\nwith love of self and neighbor (and thus with respect for the basic\naspects of the wellbeing of each and all human beings) not only (i) in\nthe motives or intentions with which it is chosen, and (ii) in the\nappropriateness of the circumstances, but also (iii) in its object\n(more precisely the object, or closest-in intention of the choosing\nperson) (see 2.1.1 above). This is the primary sense of the axiom he\nfrequently articulates by quoting an old tag: bonum ex integra\ncausa, malum ex quocumque defectu (good from an unflawed set of\ncontributing factors, bad from any defect in the set). That is, there\nis a fundamental asymmetry between moral good and moral evil \u2013 a\nnotion very foreign to any version of utilitarian or post-utilitarian\nconsequentialist or \u201cproportionalist\u201d ethics.\n5. Political community\n\nLove of neighbor as oneself requires one to live in political\ncommunity with others. For the wellbeing and right(s) of all or almost\nall of us are dependent upon there being in place institutions of\ngovernment and law of the relatively comprehensive kind we call\n\u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d.\n5.1 Common good\n\n\u201cCommon good\u201d is very often a safer translation of\nbonum commune than \u201cthe common good\u201d. For there\nis the common good of a team, but equally the common good of a\nuniversity class, of a university, of a family, of a neighborhood, of\na city, of a state, of a church and of human kind throughout the\nworld. The difference in each case between the group\u2019s common\ngood and an aggregate of the wellbeing of each of its members can be\nunderstood by considering how, in a real friendship, A wills B\u2019s\nwellbeing for B\u2019s sake, while B wills A\u2019s wellbeing for\nA\u2019s sake, and each therefore has reason to will his or her own\nwellbeing for the other\u2019s sake, with the result that neither\nenvisages his or her own wellbeing as the source (the object) of the\nfriendship\u2019s value, and each has in view a truly common\ngood, not reducible to the good of either taken separately or merely\nsummed. Inasmuch as there is possible and appropriate a kind of\nfriendship between the members of each of the kinds of group listed\n(non-exhaustively) above, each such group has its own common good.\n5.1.1 Groups\n\nCommunities such as those just mentioned are groups, each of them a\nwhole [totum] made up of persons (and perhaps of other\ngroups), their unity being not merely one of composition or\nconjunction or continuity, but rather of order, in two\ndimensions: (i) of the parts (members) as coordinating with each\nother, and (ii) of the group and its members to its organizing purpose\nor end (finis). Of these, (ii) is the more explanatory, as\nAquinas argues at the very beginning of his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics.\n5.2 Political common good and political community relativized\n\nSome of the above-listed kinds of group have, in Aquinas\u2019 view,\na significance that is in a sense strategic. In particular, the\nfamily-cum-household, the political group, and the church established\nto transmit divine revelation and salvation each have such\nsignificance. The benefits made possible by political community, with\nits state government and law, are such that its common good is both\nextensive and intensive in its reach and implications (e.g. the\nlegitimacy of securing it by coercion). So on those occasions when\n\u201cthe common good\u201d is the best translation of bonum\ncommune, the referent will normally be the good of the political\ncommunity in question (or of political communities generically), often\ncalled by Aquinas public good.\n\nNevertheless, Aquinas\u2019s use of the Aristotelian axiom,\n\u201chuman beings are naturally political animals\u201d almost\nalways takes it as asserting our social, not solitary, nature \u2013\nour need for interpersonal relationships both for friendship and for\nsuch necessities as food, clothing, speech, and so forth. So the axiom\nshould not be made to mean that Aquinas thinks there is a distinct\nbasic inclination towards, or a distinct basic good, of political\ncommunity, to put alongside the distinct basic good of marriage and\nfamily. He accepts that we are naturally parts of a political\ncommunity, but also that we are more naturally conjugal than political\n(in the narrow sense), and that political community does not properly\nhave the ultimacy it has for Aristotle. For Aquinas, political\ncommunities have been irrevocably relativized by the appropriateness\nfor (in principle) everyone of belonging to the Church which is, in\nits own way, as complete [perfecta] a kind of community as\nany state.\n\nMoreover, Aristotle\u2019s claim that the polis is\n\u201cgreater and more godlike\u201d than any other human community\nis put by Aquinas into a horizon which contains not merely the one\ncivitas (Latin for polis) of which I am a member but\nrather the whole plurality of peoples and civitates (states,\npolitical communities): Eth. VIII.4.11\u201312. So for him\nthe common good that is the ultimate concern of political philosophy,\nand thus of the reasonable person, is nothing less than the\nfulfillment of all human persons and communities (and see 3.2\nabove).\n\nStill, this wider perspective does not lead Aquinas to develop a\ntheory of international community; this had to be developed by his\nsixteenth-century followers. Indeed, he takes remarkably little\ninterest in a number of important issues related to the plurality of\nstates and the dynamics of state-formation, and the appropriate\nrelationship between a people [populus, gens, etc.]\nand a state (should each people presumptively have a state?). His\npolitical philosophy explores with subtlety and care the state\n[civitas, regnum, etc.], almost as if there were\nsimply a single permanent political community.\n6. The state a \u201ccomplete community\u201d with \u201cmixed\u201d and \u201climited\u201d government\n\nThe state is a \u201ccomplete community\u201d, whose members, in the\ncentral case, are also members of another \u201ccomplete\ncommunity\u201d, the Church. So this completeness is, in each case,\nrelative and delimited. Correspondingly, the state\u2019s governing\nstructures (which Aquinas does not call \u201cthe state\u201d) are\n\u2013 again in the central, morally proper case \u2013 limited in\nfour distinct ways.\n6.1 Four kinds of limitation on state government and law\n\n(i) State governments and laws are subject to moral standards,\nespecially but not only the principles and norms of justice. This does\nnot mean that moral principles all apply to public authority in the\nway they do to private persons; they do not, yet there is no exemption\nof public authorities from the exceptionless moral norms against\nintentionally killing the innocent, lying, rape and other\nextra-marital sex, and so forth. Moreover, this limitation has no\nbearing on the distinct question which moral standards should, or can\nproperly, be legally enforced by the state\u2019s government and law\n(see (iii) below).\n\n(ii) State governments are subject to laws governing election or other\nappointment to and tenure and rotation of office, and the jurisdiction\nof particular offices. Even supreme rulers not subject to the coercive\nauthority of anyone else cannot dispense themselves from the\nobligation of their own laws unless that is for the common good and\nfree from favoritism. If they defy these moral restrictions they show\nthemselves to be tyrants, and may be resisted and deposed by the\nconcerted (\u201cpublic\u201d) action of their people. The best form\nof government (or as we would now say, constitution) is one in which,\n\u201cwell mixed\u201d, are found \u201cmonarchy\u201d,\n\u201caristocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d, that is, the\nrule of one person (whose \u201cmonarchy\u201d is probably\nbetter elective rather than hereditary), governing in concert with a\nfew high officials chosen for their excellence of character\nand aptitude, by an electorate comprising the many who are\nentitled both to vote and to stand for election: ST I-II q.\n105 a. 1. Establishing and maintaining such an arrangement is a matter\nfor laws which delimit the competences of all concerned.\n\n(iii) State governments and laws have the authority and duty to\npromote and defend the common good, including the good of virtue. This\nresponsibility brings with it the authority to use coercion for the\nsuppression of crime and enemy attack. This coercive jurisdiction\nextends to defending persons and property both by force and by the\ncredible threat of punishment for criminal or other unjust\nappropriation or damage. But it does not extend to enforcing any part\nof morality other than the requirements of justice insofar as\nthey can be violated by acts external to the choosing and\nacting person\u2019s will. Acts of virtues (or vices) other than such\nexternal acts of inter-personal (in)justice cannot rightly be\nprohibited unless they involve (in)justice. For, unlike\ndivine law\u2019s, \u201chuman law\u2019s purpose is the temporal\ntranquility of the state, a purpose which the law attains by\ncoercively prohibiting external acts to the extent that these\nevils can disturb the peaceful state of the state.\u201d ST\nI-II q. 98 a. 1c; likewise q. 100 a. 2c: \u201chuman law does not put\nforward precepts about anything other than acts of justice [and\ninjustice]\u201d. State law\u2019s justifiedly coercive domain is\nnot private good as such, nor the whole of the community\u2019s\ncommon good. Rather, it is those aspects of the political\ncommunity\u2019s common good that can be called public good, and that\nare affected by external acts directly or indirectly affecting other\nmembers of the community.\n\n(iv) The morally significant authority of the state\u2019s government\nand law is limited by the rights of the Church, though when that\ngovernment and law are within their proper domain, one ought to comply\nwith their directives rather than any purported act of administration\nor government (apart from general moral teaching) by Pope or\nbishops.\n\nThe last three kinds of limitation can be considered here in a little\nmore detail.\n6.2 Limited government\u2019s forms: \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cregal\u201d\n\nGovernment is properly speaking \u201cpolitical\u201d when the\nsupreme person or body \u201chas power which is limited [potestas\ncoarctata or limitata] by certain laws of the\nstate\u201d: Pol. I.1.5. Such rulers govern in accordance\nwith the laws concerning the establishment of their office, their\nappointment and their responsibilities. When power is, by contrast,\n\u201cplenary\u201d, the government is said to be\n\u201cregal\u201d in kind. But even regal government, in its proper\nforms, is the government of free and equal people who have in some\nsense (never made quite clear by Aquinas) the \u201cright to resist\n[ius repugnandi]\u201d the ruler(s). Even regal rulers are\nsubject to the directive force of the laws, though there is no-one who\nhas the legal authority to coerce them.\n\nAquinas sees no need for any \u201csocial contract\u201d to explain\nor justify the origins of government or of any particular regime. But\nhe does think that, even in regal as distinct from political rule, the\nenacted laws constitute \u201ca kind of covenant [pactum]\nbetween king and people\u201d (In Rom. 13.1 v. 6), and\nviolation of this by the ruler can entail that subjects are released\nfrom their covenantal obligation.\n\nIn principle, Aquinas thinks, the supreme legislative powers are held\neither by the whole people [tota multitudo], a free people\n[libera multitudo], or by some public persona who\nhas responsibility [cura] for them and represents them\n[gerit personam multitudinis: bears their persona]: I-II q.\n97 a. 3 ad 3; II-II q. 57 a. 2. Neither the meaning of this\n\u201crepresentation\u201d nor the practicalities of designating a\nrepresentative are explored in any depth by Aquinas. Nor does he\ndiscuss how it gets settled whether a particular people is (i) simply\nfree and self-governing, or (ii) free but subject to the legislative\nauthority of some princeps, or (iii) unfree (perhaps because\nconquered).\n6.3 State authority is neither paternalistic nor divine\n\nThough he never openly confronts them, Aquinas sets aside the sayings\nat the end of Aristotle\u2019s Ethics which seem to mean\nthat the polis has the responsibility and role of coercively\nleading all its citizens, of every age, towards all-round virtue.\nAquinas plainly rejects the idea that the state is a surrogate for\npaternal authority, or has God\u2019s authority over morally\nsignificant conduct. Though he frequently states that the political\nrulers have a proper concern to lead people to virtue, these\nstatements turn out to refer to the appropriate aspirations of rulers,\nnot to their coercive jurisdiction or authority. In the context of the\nsurrounding argument, the statements do not commit him to any wider\ngovernmental or legal authority than to require and foster the public\ngood and the virtue of justice, that is, the willingness to perform\none\u2019s duties to others: 6.1(iii) above. The other\nvirtues can be legally required of citizens only so far as they impact\non justice: ST I-II q. 96 a. 3. Moreover, he holds the\nclassic position that doing justice does not require that one\u2019s\nmotivations and character be just. And when it comes to coercive\nmeasures, he holds that they can bear only upon conduct that is\nexternal and immediately or mediately affects other people unjustly or\ndisturbs the peace of the political community: ST I-II q. 98\na. 1. Really private vices are outside the coercive jurisdiction of\nthe state\u2019s government and law. Though political authority is\nultimately derived from divine authority, it is not to be exercised in\nthe same all-encompassing way as God does when directing one (like\nevery other human individual) to the complete and heavenly fulfillment\ngratuitously and supernaturally offered to us all by God. Absolute\npolitical authority of the kind later claimed by rulers such as James\nI of England is contrary to Aquinas\u2019 constant teaching.\n\nThis reading of Aquinas as, in a nineteenth and twentieth century\njargon, \u201ca liberal\u201d (or \u201cthe first Whig\u201d) is\noften disputed, for there are statements in his writings which taken\nacontextually seem to assert the simpler and paternalistic\nAristotelian position.\n6.4 The state shares its authority with another \u201ccomplete community\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons why Aquinas\u2019 political theory departs\nsignificantly from Aristotle\u2019s is that Aquinas believes he has\naccess to facts and considerations unavailable to Aristotle, namely to\nthe public divine revelation completed in the works and sayings of\nChrist, founder of a spiritual community, the (Catholic =\n\u201cuniversal\u201d) Church. When political life is really\nwell-ordered, therefore, each member (citizen) of a state will be also\na member of this other \u201ccomplete community\u201d and subject to\nits laws as well as to the state\u2019s. The function of this other\ncommunity is to transmit the divine promise or offer of eternal life,\nand to help people help each other, through their own individual free\nchoices, to become ready for that life. With the establishing of this\ncommunity (in continuity and discontinuity with the older religious\ncommunity of Israel), human associations are henceforth of two\nfundamentally distinct types: (i) temporal or secular, worldly, civil,\nor political, and (ii) spiritual. Correspondingly, responsibility for\nhuman affairs is divided between (i) secular societies, especially\nstates and families, and (ii) the Church. The distinction between\nsecular and spiritual tracks that between natural and revealed\nknowledge.\n6.4.1 Non-dependence and non-subjection of secular authority\n\nAccordingly, the Church\u2019s leaders have no jurisdiction over\nsecular matters, although they can declare that the choice of a member\nof the Church, albeit in a secular matter, is seriously immoral. A\nparent has no jurisdiction over a child\u2019s free choices except in\nso far as they violate the moral rights of other members of the family\nor the parents\u2019 responsibility for the child\u2019s education\nand moral upbringing. State government and law have no right to direct\nthe Church\u2019s leaders, or its members in their religious affairs,\nexcept in so far as the state\u2019s peace and justice would\notherwise be violated. \u201cIn those matters which pertain to\npolitical good [bonum civile], secular rather than spiritual\nauthority should be obeyed.\u201d Sent. II d. 44 ex. ad\n4.\n\nNeither those who adhere to the old, incomplete revelation (Jews), nor\nthose people and peoples who simply do not accept the truth of the\nfull revelation, are subject to the authority of the Church. Nor is\nthe legitimacy and authority of a government negated by the fact that\nits members (officials) are unbelievers.\n\nBeyond this, Aquinas works within the constitutional assumptions of\nthe Christendom of his era. His positions imply that if ecclesiastical\nauthorities expel members from the Church for their misdeeds as\nrulers, the consequences under their particular state\u2019s own\nconstitutional arrangement could include the rulers\u2019\ndeposition (loss of secular legal authority); but Aquinas blurs or\nelides this distinction of jurisdictions, and loosely says that the\nChurch \u201chas the authority of curbing secular rulers\u201d\n(ST II-II q. 12 a. 2 ad 1).\n6.4.2 Heresy, unbelief and religious freedom\n\nAquinas accepts the teaching of the Church of his era that no one can\nrightly be compelled to accept the Christian faith or membership of\nthe Church, but that those who are members can and should be compelled\nby both ecclesiastical and state law to abstain from any public denial\nor renunciation of it. He treats such renunciation as an actionable\nbreach of promise (passing silently over the fact that in most cases\nthe promise was made not by the persons concerned but rather, in their\nearly infancy, by their parents). And he regards public teaching of\nheresy as comparable to counterfeiting coin of the realm and therefore\nrightly punishable capitally by the secular authorities (the fact of\nfalse teaching having been ascertained by an ecclesiastical trial).\nHis views about this matter are explicitly based on the evolving\ntradition of the Church and on what historical experience suggested\nwere the effects of more permissive political or legal arrangements.\nSo there are no theoretical obstacles to his ready acceptance of the\njudgment of later theologians and Church teachers that, as experience\nshows, it is more compatible with basic positions in his moral and\npolitical philosophy to hold that authentically personal judgment and\nfreely chosen commitment are so important in relation to ultimate\nquestions that all persons (even those whose beliefs about religion\nare false or ill-formed) have a moral right, and should have the\ncorresponding legal right, to be free from state (and ecclesiastical)\ncoercion in religious belief or action except in so far as their\nconduct would be contrary to the rights of others or to public peace\nor to public morality (that is, morality so far as it is publicly\ncommunicated or concerns actions which impact on the public) (Second\nVatican Council, Declaration on Religious Liberty (1965)).\nNor is it clear how he could resist the objection that, even if those\nbaptized in infancy ratify the promises made on their behalf at\nbaptism, the subscription of faith is not an undertaking to other\npeople or the community, but rather is a matter which, as he says in a\nneglected passage elsewhere in his major writings (ScG III c.\n80 n. 15), \u201cpertains to that person alone as an individual\n[secundum se ipsum].\u201d\n7. Law\n\nThe best developed part of Aquinas\u2019 political theory is his\naccount of law. That account\u2019s main features may be summarized\nin four propositions about the central case and focal meaning of law.\nIt is a matter of intelligent direction addressed to the intelligence\nand reason of those whom it directs. It is for the common good of a\npolitical community. It is made (positum, put in place) by\nthe ruler(s) responsible for the community in question. It needs to be\ncoercive.\n7.1 Law is an appeal to reason\n\nAquinas\u2019 well-known discussion of law in ST I-II qq.\n90\u201397 (a discussion which actually extends through the less\nstudied qq. 98\u2013105) has been justly admired by jurists and other\nthinkers not otherwise much interested in his work. But it is shaped\nby his concern there (i) to present for beginner students of theology\nan overview of the universe and of the vast sweep of creatures out\nfrom their divine creator and back to the same transcendent being as\ntheir ultimate destiny, and (ii) to synthesize the traditional\nvocabulary and classic theological sources on law. So prominence is\nthere given to the \u201ceternal law\u201d by which God governs even\ninanimate creatures (as by the laws of physics, etc.), and to the\n\u201cparticipation\u201d of natural moral law in that eternal law.\nBut when he is free from these textbookish constraints he emphasizes\nthat law\u2019s most essential feature is something which is not true\nof the laws of nature (physics, biology, etc.), namely that it is an\nappeal to the mind, choice, moral strength (virtus) and love\nof those subject to the law: ScG III cc. 114\u2013117; this\nis quietly indicated also in ST I-II q. 91 a. 2 ad 3.\n\nLaw (in its central case and focal meaning) is thus always a plan for\nco-ordination through free cooperation. The structure of things being\nwhat it is, the principles of practical reason and morality (natural\nmoral law and natural right) can be understood, accepted, and lived\nby, as fully directive in conscience, without needing to be regarded\nas (what they really are) an appeal from mind to mind, a\nplan \u2013 freely made to be freely adopted \u2013 for\nintegral human fulfillment. As the divine creator was in no way\nconstrained to choose to create this universe as distinct from any\nother good possible universe, so human legislators have wide moral\nfreedom to choose amongst alternative possible legal arrangements,\nmaking one set of provisions legally and (presumptively) morally\nobligatory by the sheer fact of adopting it \u2013 that is, by what\nAquinas calls the law-makers\u2019 determinatio: I-II q. 95\na. 2; q. 99 a. 3 ad 2; q. 104 a. 1..\n7.2 Law is for a political community\u2019s common good\n\nThe definition of law offered by Aquinas in ST I-II q. 90 a.\n4 is: \u201can ordinance of reason for the common good of a\n[complete] community, promulgated by the person or body responsible\nfor looking after that community.\u201d It is by being intended for\ncommon good that law appeals to its subjects\u2019 reason, and gives\nthem reason for regarding the law as authoritative and obligatory,\nmorally as well as legally. Even when its subjects or some of them\nwould have made or preferred a different determinatio, a\ndifferent way of pursuing communal benefit, the rulers\u2019 intent\nto promote common good supports and is supported by their claim to\nrulership. Only if they have such intent can they instantiate the\ncentral case of government.\n7.2.1 The Rule of Law\n\nThe central case of government is the rule of a free people, and law\nis centrally instantiated when its fully public character\n(promulgation: q. 90 a. 4), and its clarity (q. 95 a.3), generality\n(q. 96 a. 1), stability (q. 97 a. 2), and practicability (q. 95 a. 3),\nenable government (law-makers and law-maintainers alike) and subjects\nto be partners in public reason (Aquinas has the concept\nthough not the phrase). The features of law thus itemized by Aquinas\namount to the concept of the Rule of Law, which he clearly gives a\npriority over the \u201crule of men\u201d in his treatment of\njudges\u2019 subordination to legislation and of the duty of judges\nto adhere to law even against the evidence of their own eyes (when\nthat evidence is not legally admissible): II-II q. 67 a. 2; q. 64 a. 6\nad 3.\n7.3 Law is posited by the responsible authority\n\nThe person or body that \u201chas the care of the community\u201d is\nentitled to make laws. Aquinas treats all human law as\n\u201cposited\u201d and (synonymously) \u201cpositive\u201d, even\nthose of its rules that are restatements of, or authoritatively\npromulgated deductions (conclusiones) from, general moral\nprinciples or norms. Interpretation, too, Aquinas thinks of as\ninvolving, in the last analysis, an appeal to the legislator(s) to\ndeclare what the enacted law truly means.\n\nThe making of law by custom is not incompatible with this thesis; it\namounts to a positing of law by the people, considered as having a\ndiffused authority and responsibility for their own community.\n\nEven in a paradise unflawed by any human vice, there would, Aquinas\nthinks, have been need for government and for law, though not\nnecessarily \u201cpolitical\u201d government, still less coercive\nlaw. For social life needs a considerable amount of common policy and\ncommon action which cannot otherwise than by authoritative\ndeterminatio be achieved by a group whose members have many\nideas \u2013 perhaps all of them good \u2013 about priorities and\nways to proceed: ST I q. 96 a. 4. A determinatio, if\nit is just and fit to be authoritative, must have a rational\nconnection to principles of practical reasonableness. But that\nrational connection is like an architect\u2019s decisions about\ndimensions; they must be rationally connected to the terms of the\ncommission (e.g. to build a maternity hospital, not a lion\u2019s\ncage) but these terms, while excluding various options, leave many\noptions entirely open (the doors must be more than 1 foot high but as\nbetween 7.1 and 7.2 feet the choice is entirely free, and likewise\nwith every dimension, selection of materials, colors, and so\nforth).\n7.4 Law needs to be coercive\n\nIn a world (paradise) of saints (completely virtuous persons), there\nwould be need for law but not for coercion; so coercion is not part of\nAquinas\u2019s definition of law and law\u2019s directive force can\nbe contrasted with its coercive force (and see 6.1(ii) above). But in\nour actual world the need for (the threat of) coercion is such that\nAquinas will say without qualification that law ought to have coercive\nforce [vis coactiva] as well as directive [vis\ndirectiva]; he even says that it is a characteristic of law\n[de ratione legis] (ST I-II q. 96 a. 5), despite not\nincluding it in his official definition of law\u2019s nature [its\nratio] (q. 90. a. 3).\n\nIt is not quite accurate to say that the state or its government has a\nmonopoly of force, since one can justifiably use force as a citizen to\ndefend oneself or others from an attack or assault that is not itself\njustified (being criminal or insane), and this requires no\nauthorization. Still, Aquinas insistently draws a distinction between\nprivate and public use of force. Only public authority can punish or\nrightly engage in war, and it is reasonable for public authorities to\nseek a virtual monopoly on what would now be called police operations\nfor the prevention, suppression, and detection of crime. Private\npersons can never rightly intend precisely to harm or kill, though\nthey can knowingly bring about harm or death as a proportionate\nside-effect of intending to block an attack (3.4.1 above). Persons\nwith public authority can, Aquinas thinks, rightly intend to kill (or\ninjure) in the exercise of their duty to suppress the attacks of\ncriminals, pirates, and other public or private enemies. (He does not\nexplore those borderland or badland \u2013 \u201cwild west\u201d\n\u2013 situations where the distinction between public and private is\nindistinct.)\n\nThe paradigmatic public use of coercion is judicially imposed\npunishment, capital or otherwise. At the core of Aquinas\u2019s\naccount of justified punishment is the notion that offenders are\npunishable because, in choosing to offend, they have excessively\nindulged their will and thereby (he implies) gained a kind of\nadvantage over those who have retrained their own wills from such\nexcess; a just relationship between themselves and their fellow\ncitizens can fittingly be restored by proportionately imposing upon\nsuch offenders something contra voluntatem, contrary to and\nsuppressive of their will: I-II q. 46 a. 6 ad 2. This restoration of a\nfair balance between offenders and the law-abiding is central to what\nAquinas frequently calls the \u201cmedicinal\u201d function of\npunishment, for the medicine of punishment is intended to heal not\nonly offenders (by reforming them) or potential offenders (by\ndeterring them), but also and more centrally the whole community by\nrectifying the disorder of injustice created by the offender\u2019s\nself-preferential violation of justice. On capital punishment see\n3.4.1 above.\n\nAquinas regards as legitimate ground for going to war not only the\ndefence of this or another political community, but also the purpose\nof justly punishing and/or securing compensation. (As justifiable\ngrounds for use of force, it is difficult to distinguish between (i)\ndefence of one\u2019s own community\u2019s (or another\u2019s)\nterritory and constitution, (ii) the recovery or restoration of\nunjustly taken territory or other possessions, and (iii) exaction of\ncompensation for unjust takings or other injuries.)\n7.5 Unjust law and just revolution\n\nIf the law purports to require actions that no-one should ever do, it\ncannot rightly be complied with; one\u2019s moral obligation is not\nto obey but to disobey: ST I-II q. 96 a. 4. And if it\npurports to authorize such acts (e.g. rape, theft, or infanticide),\nits authorization is morally void and of no effect (II-II q. 57 a. 2\nad 2); courts should not guide their adjudications by such laws (II-II\nq. 60 a. 5 ad 1). But law\u2019s obligatoriness and authority is\nsubject to further conditions, derived from the very nature and\nrationale of political authority. If the law-makers (i) are motivated\nnot by concern for the community\u2019s common good but by greed or\nvanity (private motivations that make them tyrants, whatever the\ncontent of their legislation), or (ii) act outside the authority\ngranted to them, or (iii) while acting with a view to the common good\napportion the necessary burdens unfairly, their laws are unjust and in\nthe forum of reasonable conscience are not so much laws as acts of\nviolence [magis sunt violentiae quam leges]: I-II q. 96 a. 4.\nSuch laws lack moral authority, i.e. do not bind in conscience; one is\nneither morally obliged to conform nor morally obliged not to\nconform.\n\nThis conclusion is subject to a proviso or exception: laws which are\nunjust by reason of one or more of these three enumerated types of\ndefect in authority sometimes create an obligation in conscience just\nto the extent that disobedience would cause disorder or give the kind\nof \u2018example\u2019 that leads others into wrongdoing. To avoid\nthose sorts of unjust harm to public and private good one may have a\nmoral obligation to forgo one\u2019s right(s) [iuri suo debet\ncedere]. This obligation is not: to comply with the law according\nto its makers\u2019 intent, and/or to the meaning it has under the\nparticular legal system\u2019s interpretative canons. Rather, it is a\nkind of collateral obligation: to avoid those acts of non-compliance\nthat would unjustly risk having the bad side-effects of being seen not\nto comply.\n\nAll who govern in the interests of themselves rather than of the\ncommon good are tyrants, for that is what a tyrant is in the classical\nline of thought followed by Aquinas. Tyranny entails treating\none\u2019s subjects as slaves \u2013 persons used for the benefit of\nthe master. The laws of tyrants are not laws simpliciter, but\nrather a kind of perversion of law [perversitas legis], and\none is, in principle, entitled to treat them as one treats a\nbandit\u2019s demands: I-II q. 92 a 1 ad 4 & 5; II-II q. 69 a. 4.\nAgainst the regime\u2019s efforts to enforce its decrees one has the\nright of forcible resistance; as a private right this could extend as\nfar as killing the tyrant as a foreseen side-effect of one\u2019s\nlegitimate self-defence. It is the tyrant rather than the subject who\nis morally guilty of sedition. If one can associate with others to\nconstitute oneself with them a kind of public authority willing and\nable to assume responsibility for the common good of the state, one is\nentitled, in Aquinas\u2019 view, to set about overthrowing, and if\nneed be executing, the tyrant, with a view to the liberatio\nof the people [multitudinis] and the homeland\n[patriae]. Since rulers who are not tyrants are entitled to\nhunt down and most severely punish sedition, and both rulers and\nsubjects may fall into error about each other\u2019s moral status,\nsubjects ought to be slow to judge a tyranny so unjust that\noverthrowing or forcibly resisting it is fair to those likely to be\ninjured as a side-effect of revolutionary struggle; there is a\n(defeasible) presumption in favor of acquiescence and merely passive\ndisobedience: II-II q. 42 a. 2 ad 3, q. 104 a. 6 ad 3; II\nSent. d. 44 q. 2 a. 2; Reg. 1.6.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
