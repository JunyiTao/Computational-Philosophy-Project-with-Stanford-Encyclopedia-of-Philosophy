Beyond Newton\n\nIn sum: we have seen how historical authors, from Aristotle through to\nNewtonian and Leibniz, tackled the puzzles of motion and change in\nphysical theorising. In a sequel entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: post-Newtonian theories,\n we will see how post-Newtonian authors, from Mach through to Einstein\nand other contemporary physicists and philosophers, have brought new\nconceptual and technical resources to bear on (arguably) the selfsame\nissues. The sequel also includes a longer conclusion, reflecting on\nthe themes running through both articles.\n\nFor now we will just note that we have focussed on authors who made\ncontributions to the science of mechanics, and so a significant\nphilosophical lacuna is a discussion of Kant\u2019s views on space\nand motion. For recent treatments, see Friedman 2013 and Stan\n2015.\n",
