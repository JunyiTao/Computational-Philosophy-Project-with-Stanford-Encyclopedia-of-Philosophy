As a result, synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not even partly determine an agent\u2019s\nobligation to perform some fully specific immediate act. This still\nleaves open a question about the ability that an agent must possess in\norder to be able to perform some immediate (fully specific) act in the\nrelevant sense. Goldman\u2019s (1978: 195, 204\u2013205) Ability\n2, for instance, is a version of the conditional analysis of\nabilities. The conditional analysis of abilities remains suspect by\nsome on the grounds that an agent does not have direct control over\ntheir desires. Given this, one may infer that facts about what an\nagent would do if she had different desires is irrelevant to her\nabilities (Lehrer 1968; Curran 1995: 82). Nevertheless, since many\nparticipants in the actualist-possibilist debate take for granted that\nthe ability to do otherwise is compatible with facts about what an\nagent will do or would do under certain circumstances, a number of\npeople have followed Goldman (1978) by taking the relevant kind of\ncontrol to be one that does not hold fixed all facts about the\nagent\u2019s psychological makeup. See, for instance, the views of\nDoug Portmore (2011) and Jacob Ross (2012).\n\nPortmore (2011) understands the relevant kind of control an agent must\nhave over an option in terms of scrupulous securability. A\nset of acts (i.e., an act-set) is scrupulously securable by an agent\nonly if there is some set of intentions and some set of permissible\nbackground attitudes (including beliefs and desires), such that if the\nagent had these intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform\nthat act-set (2011: 165). The sorts of attitudes Portmore (2011: 167)\nhas in mind are judgment-sensitive attitudes, i.e., attitudes that are\nsensitive to judgments about reasons (Scanlon 1998: 20). \n\nThis form of control is similar to the conditional analysis insofar as\nthe agent does not need to possess the relevant intentions and\nattitudes required to perform an act in order to have an ability to\nperform that act. It just has to be the case that if the agent were to\nhave such intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform the\nrelevant act. Portmore\u2019s (2011: 166\u2013167) exact account of\ncontrol is as follows:\n\n\nA set of acts, \\(\u03b1_j\\), is, as of \\(t_i\\), scrupulously\nsecurable by S if and only if there is a time, \\(t_j\\), that\neither immediately follows \\(t_i\\) or is identical to \\(t_i\\), a set\nof acts, \\(\u03b1_i\\), (where \\(\u03b1_i\\) may, or may not, be\nidentical to \\(\u03b1_j\\)), and a set of background attitudes,\nB, such that the following are all true: (1) S would\nperform \\(\u03b1_j\\) if S were to have at \\(t_i\\) both\nB and the intention to perform \\(\u03b1_i\\); (2) S has\nat \\(t_i\\) the capacity to continue, or to come, to have at \\(t_j\\)\nboth B and the intention to perform \\(\u03b1_i\\); and (3)\nS would continue, or come, to have at \\(t_j\\) B (and,\nwhere \\(\u03b1_i\\) is not identical to \\(\u03b1_j\\), the intention\nto perform \\(\u03b1_i\\) as well) if S both were at \\(t_i\\)\naware of all the relevant reason-constituting facts and were at\n\\(t_j\\) to respond to these facts/reasons in all and only the ways\nthat they prescribe, thereby coming to have at \\(t_j\\) all those\nattitudes that, given those facts, she has decisive reason to have and\nonly those attitudes that she has, given those facts, sufficient\nreason to have.\n\n\nPortmore (2011: 177) understands a set of acts \\(\u03b1_j\\) to be a\nmaximal act-set in a similar vein to both a possibilist\u2019s notion\nof a maximal act-set and Sobel\u2019s notion of a life. The set of\nacts \u201c\\(\u03b1_i\\)\u201d is not identical to\n\u201c\\(\u03b1_j\\)\u201d when, e.g., one lacks the ability at\n\\(t_j\\) to form an intention to perform \u201c\\(\u03b1_j\\)\u201d,\nalthough the agent would in fact perform \\(\u03b1_j\\) if the agent\nwere to form at \\(t_j\\) the intention to perform \\(\u03b1_i\\). For\nexample, earning a PhD may be presently scrupulously securable for an\nagent, although she is presently unable to form an intention to do all\nof the things that are required to attain a PhD at least because she\ncannot presently intend to write about an idea in her dissertation\nthat she has not yet studied (Portmore 2011: 169). So, whenever\n\\(\u03b1_j\\) and \\(\u03b1_i\\) are not identical, part (1) says that\nS would perform some act-set if S were to intend to\nperform some other act-set (along with certain background\nattitudes).\n\nPart (2) of the above definition states that an agent must have a\ncapacity (or an ability) to have certain attitudes and intentions.\nThis allows one to sidestep the difficulties that have been posed for\nthe conditional analysis of abilities (cf. Portmore 2011: 168). Part\n(3) states that the agent\u2019s attitudes must be permissible. To\nillustrate, suppose that the only way in which Doug can ensure at 2 pm\nthat he will eat a healthy meal rather than pizza at 6 pm is by having\nthe irrational belief that his life depends upon eating a healthy meal\nat 6 pm. Since it seems that he is not obligated to have such a\nbelief, it follows that, at 2 pm, Doug is not obligated to eat a\nhealthy meal at 6 pm since there is no combination of intentions and\npermissible attitudes (as opposed to impermissible attitudes) that\nDoug can have at 2 pm, such that if he were to have them at 2 pm then\nhe would eat a healthy meal at 6 pm (Portmore 2011:\n164\u2013165).\n\nPortmore (2011: 222) pairs this notion of control with the following\naccount of rational permissibility that applies to moral\npermissibility when there are moral reasons to act:\n\n Securitism: It is, as of \\(t_i\\), objectively\nrationally permissible for S to perform a non-maximal set of\nacts, \\(\u03b1_j\\), beginning at \\(t_j (t_i \\lt t_j)\\), if and only\nif, and because, at least one of the objectively rationally\npermissible maximal sets of acts that are, as of \\(t_i\\), scrupulously\nsecurable by S involves S\u2019s performing\n\\(\u03b1_j\\).\n\n\nSecuritism employs a top-down approach by using normative principles\nto directly assess the deontic status of maximal act-sets and then\nextending the same deontic status to non-maximal act-sets that are\ncontained in the relevant maximal act-set (Portmore 2011: 179). This\napproach reaps the benefits of Goldman\u2019s\n (G+)\n of avoiding jointly unfulfillable obligations and of denying that any\nsynchronic counterfactuals even partly determine an agent\u2019s\nobligations.\n\nPortmore\u2019s securitism\u2014and by extension other views that\nhold fixed facts that are not presently up to the agent in some\nsense\u2014has been criticized on the grounds that it does not\ngenerate an obligation to do the best one can in the sense at issue in\nAbility 1, and thus securitism sometimes requires agents to\nperform terrible and vicious acts, and it allows one to avoid\nincurring an obligation in light of vicious or immoral dispositions\n(Timmerman 2015; Vessel 2016).\n\nRoss (2012: 84) similarly maintains that an agent can immediately\nperform an act that requires some attitude that the agent does not in\nfact have, although Portmore\u2019s and Ross\u2019s views diverge in\ncertain cases. Here is Ross\u2019s view (2012: 91):\n\n Momentwise Wide-scope Securitism\n(MWSS): For any x and t, at t, x\nought to be such that, for all \\(t'\\) from t forward, x\nsatisfies the following conditional: For all \\(\\Phi\\), if whether\nx \\(\\Phi\\)s does not causally depend on the intentions x\nhas after \\(t'\\), and if every maximally preferable option that is\ndirectly securable for x at \\(t'\\) involves \\(\\Phi\\)-ing, then\nx \\(\\Phi\\)s.\n\n\nIn essence, MWSS is the view that \u201cat any given time, an agent\nis obligated, at every future time, to be currently satisfying a\nwide-scope version\u201d of Smith\u2019s\n (G+)\n or Portmore\u2019s securitism (Ross 2012: 91). Ross believes that\nonly MWSS can account for each of the four conditions of his core idea\n(2012: 89, 91).\n\n The Core Idea Broken Down: What is obligatory\nfor an agent is that, (i) at all times, she does (ii) the\nbest she can do at that time, (iii) holding fixed what is not\nup to her at that time, but (iv) not holding fixed what is up\nto her at that time.\n\n\nTo see how these views diverge, consider the following case which is\nsimilar to a case described by Ross (2012: 87\u201388): at \\(t_1\\)\nSally has the ability to immediately form an intention to \u27e8not\nkill anyone five years later at \\(t_5\\)\u27e9, although\n\u27e8killing no one at \\(t_5\\)\u27e9 is not scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). On the other hand, killing exactly one\nperson or killing exactly two persons at \\(t_5\\) are both scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). According to Portmore\u2019s\nsecuritism, one of the objectively morally permissible maximal set of\nacts that is scrupulously securable by Sally at \\(t_1\\) involves\nkilling one person at \\(t_5\\). However, at \\(t_5\\), not killing anyone\nis scrupulously securable for Sally, and thus at \\(t_5\\) Sally is\nobligated to not kill anyone at \\(t_5\\). These stipulations in\nRoss\u2019s case are derived from the fact that at \\(t_1\\) Sally has\nan impeccable moral character that will be corrupted through no fault\nof her own (by being kidnapped by Satanists). But her moral character\nis not corrupted to such an extent that she is unable at \\(t_5\\) to\nrefrain from killing anyone. To emphasize, at \\(t_1\\) the best\nefficacious intention that Sally can form involves killing one person\nat \\(t_5\\) whereas at \\(t_5\\) the best efficacious intention that\nSally can form involves killing no one at \\(t_5\\). Portmore\u2019s\nsecuritism thus prescribes an act at some future time, but then does\nnot prescribe that act once that time is present.\n\nRoss (2012: 87\u201389) wishes to avoid this implication.\n MWSS\n does not imply that at \\(t_1\\) Sally is obligated to kill exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) because whether Sally kills exactly one person at\n\\(t_5\\) causally depends upon her intentions at \\(t_1\\). So, Sally\nsatisfies the following conditional by not satisfying the first part\nof the antecedent: (if whether Sally refrains from killing exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) does not causally depend on the intentions she will\nhave after \\(t_1\\), and if all her maximally preferable, directly\nsecurable options involve killing exactly one person at \\(t_5\\), then\nshe kills exactly one person at \\(t_5)\\). Instead, MWSS implies that\nat \\(t_1\\) (and at \\(t_5)\\) Sally is obligated not to kill anyone\nbecause she satisfies the following conditional only by satisfying its\nconsequent: (if whether Sally kills no one at \\(t_5\\) does not\ncausally depend on the intentions she will have after \\(t_5\\), and if\nall her maximally preferable, directly securable options involve not\nkilling anyone at \\(t_5\\), then she kills no one at \\(t_5)\\).\n\nA proponent of securitism may reply that there\u2019s simply nothing\nSally can do at \\(t_1\\) that allows her to secure not killing anyone\nat \\(t_5\\), and thus having an obligation at \\(t_1\\) not to kill\nanyone at \\(t_5\\) concedes too much to possibilism. For, one of the\ncore intuitions driving securitist views is that we should treat our\nnon-securable futures in the same way we treat the futures of other\nagents; we should hold such futures fixed when determining our present\nmoral obligations. This thought has led to an expansive discussion of\nthe way in which actualist-possibilist scenarios raise fundamental\nquestions about agency and how we are to conceive of our present\nselves in relation to our future selves (Louise 2009; Baker 2012).\n",
