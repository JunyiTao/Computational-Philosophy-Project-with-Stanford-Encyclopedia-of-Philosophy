    "main_text": "Sources\n3. Sources\n The most fundamental influence on Grosseteste\u2019s thought was\nSt. Augustine, from whom Grosseteste drew a Neoplatonic outlook.  Yet\nGrosseteste was also strongly influenced by the Latin translations of\nGreek and Arabic philosophical and scientific writings that had poured\ninto the Latin West in his lifetime, notably the thought of such\nthinkers as Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes (whose works Grosseteste\nwas one of the first to use; see Gauthier 1982). These influences often pull him in\ndifferent directions and his thought can take on an eclectic\ncharacter. In general, however, he attempts to subordinate Greek and\nArabic philosophical learning, when necessary, to his Augustinian\nNeoplatonism.\n Although there is little doubt that Grosseteste was to some extent\ninfluenced by his contemporaries, his writings show little concern to\nengage in debate with them, in contrast with the practice of his\ncontemporaries in Paris. This perhaps reflects a provincial origin\nof Grosseteste\u2019s works, but may also reflect a conservative preference\nto engage with the ideas of the great thinkers of the recent and more\nremote Latin and Greek traditions. The Christian\ninfluences on his philosophical writings were in particular Boethius,\nSt. Anselm, and St. Bernard of Clairvaux, in addition to Augustine.\nGrosseteste also made frequent use of the writings of Cicero and\nSeneca.  Later in life, in the 1230s and 40s, the influence of Greek\nthinkers such as John of Damascus, St. Basil and the Pseudo-Dionysius\nis prominent in his theological writings.\n Grosseteste\u2019s Tabula (Rosemann 1995) provides an unusual\ninsight into his sources. This work is a topical concordance in which\nGrosseteste lists readings, Christian and non-Christian, on a wide\nrange of topics of theological and philosophical interest.\nGrosseteste associated with each topic a sign, which, written in his\nown manuscript books, allowed him quick access to the material in\nquestion.\n",
