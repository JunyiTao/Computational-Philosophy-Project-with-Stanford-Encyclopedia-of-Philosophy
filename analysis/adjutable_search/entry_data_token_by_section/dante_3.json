    "main_text": "The Convivio\n4. The Convivio\n\nThe fullest expository expression of Dante\u2019s philosophical\nthought is the Convivio, in which commentary on a series of\nhis own canzoni is the occasion for the expression of a range\nof ideas on ethics, politics, and metaphysics, as well as for extended\ndiscussion of philosophy itself. Originally, Dante conceived of the\nwork as a \u201cbanquet\u201d involving \u201cfourteen\ncourses\u201d\u2014that is, fourteen treatises commenting on\ncanzoni on the \u201cthemes of love and virtue\u201d\n(Conv. 1.1.14). However, the work, which was probably,\nwritten around 1304\u20131307, was abandoned with only four of its\ntreatises completed. In these surviving treatises, Dante describes the\ngenesis of his love of philosophy, and reflects on the ability of\nphilosophical understanding to mediate religious truth, tracing the\ndesire for knowledge from its origin as an inherent trait of human\nnature to the point at which the love of wisdom expresses itself\ndirectly as love of God.\n\nPhilosophy itself is the \u201clove of wisdom,\u201d and\nDante\u2019s central metaphor for representing it is the poetic\ncelebration of a noble lady, a donna gentile, an act that,\nlike Guinizelli, he sees as involving the influence of cosmic powers.\nHis poetry, comes into being out of love and virtue [Conv.\n1.1.14] because his nature is responsive to the influence of the\n\u201cmovers\u201d of the universe, the intelligences, whose loving\nunderstanding determines \u201cthe most noble form of heaven\u201d\n[2.5.19] as they in turn respond to \u201cthe love of the Holy\nSpirit\u201d [2.5.14]. Their cosmic activity is a continual\ntranslation of understanding into love and natural process, and it is\nthis which causes Dante to sing [Conv. 2, Canzone,\n1\u20139]:\n\n\nVoi che \u2019ntendendo il terzo ciel movete,\n\nudite il ragionar ch\u2019\u00e8 nel mio core,\n\nch\u2019io nol so dire altrui, s\u00ec mi par novo.\n\nEl ciel che segue lo vostro valore,\n\ngentili creature che voi sete,\n\nmi tragge ne lo stato ov\u2019io mi trovo.\n\nOnde \u2019l parlar de la vita ch\u2019io provo,\n\npar che si drizzi degnamente a vui:\n\nper\u00f2 vi priego che lo mi \u2019ntendiate.\n\n[All you who, knowing, make the Third Sphere move,\n\nhear what is in my heart, this strange discourse\n\nI can\u2019t tell others for it feels so new.\n\nThe Sphere that follows on your virtue\u2019s force\u2014\n\nnoble, gracious creatures that you prove\u2014\n\ndraws me in this state I have just come to;\n\nDo words about what I am going through\n\nseem not unworthily to you addressed:\n\nand this I pray you, that you hear my part.]\n\n\nThe intellective power or intendimento of the intelligences\nmoves Dante to an utterance which only these same powers can fully\nunderstand. Thus there is a continuum, a process of\ncirculazione which begins in the mind of God and descends\nthrough the work of the intelligenze to draw Dante\u2019s\nnature into that praise of the donna gentile which\nconstitutes the fulfillment of his own nature, the highest expression\nof which his desire and intellect are capable [2.6.5; Diomedi\n(1999)].\n\nOf the four books or trattati of the Convivio, the\nfirst is largely a defense of Dante\u2019s decision to write his\nprose commentaries, as well as the poems they expound, in the Tuscan\nvernacular rather than in Latin. The second book provides a\ndelineation of the Ptolemaic universe which the intelligenze\ngovern, capped by a description of the Empyrean Heaven\n[2.3.8\u201312]:\n\n\n\u2026outside of all these spheres, Catholics posit the Empyrean\nheaven, that is to say, the heaven of flame or the luminous heaven;\nand they assert that it is motionless by having within itself, with\nrespect to each of its parts, all that its matter wants. This is the\nreason for the extremely rapid movement of the Prime Mover: through\nthe exceedingly fervent desire of each part of the ninth heaven (which\nis right next to that one) to be united with each part of that most\ndivine and tranquil heaven, it revolves within it with so much desire\nthat its speed is practically incomprehensible. And tranquil and\npeaceful is the place of that supreme Deity which alone completely\nsees itself. This is the place of the blessed spirits, according to\nthe Holy Church, which cannot tell lies; and Aristotle also seems to\nhold this view, to anyone who follows what he is saying, in the first\nbook of On Heaven and Earth. This heaven is the overarching\nedifice of the universe, in which all the universe is enclosed, and\noutside of which nothing exists; and it is not in any place but was\nformed alone in the First Mind, which the Greeks call Protonoe. This\nis the magnificence of which the Psalmist spoke, when he says to God:\n\u201cElevated above the heavens is your magnificence.\u201d\n\n\nThe role of the Empyrean in thirteenth-century thought is equivocal.\nSome thinkers attempt to explain it scientifically, as a comprehensive\ncosmic principle, while for Thomas and Albert any such realm must be\nspiritual in nature and can bear no natural relation to the\nastronomical universe\u2014though both at times seem to grant it a\ncertain influence on the natural order [Nardi (1967), 196\u2013214;\nVasoli (1995a), 94\u2013102]. Dante\u2019s account reflects these\nuncertainties. He begins by citing \u201cthe Catholics,\u201d or\northodox belief, as authority for his account of this \u201cabode of\nthe supreme deity,\u201d but then goes on to treat the Empyrean as a\ncreated thing, \u201cformed in the Primal Mind,\u201d and as the\nmotionless cause of motion in the physical universe. If God dwells in\nthis place, the Empyrean resides equally in Him, and the universe at\nlarge is encompassed, causally and locally, by the Empyrean. Dante\ndeploys the Aristotelian physics of desire to explain the relationship\nof the Empyrean to the lesser heavens, yet it is at the same time\nbeyond space, a wholly spiritual realm where blessed spirits\nparticipate in the divine mind. Dante seems to emphasize this double\nstatus by mingling theological and philosophical language, and\ninvoking Aristotle and the neo-Platonists side by side with the poet\nof the Psalms. In the Paradiso the problems raised here will\nbe implicitly resolved by a brilliant recourse to the\n\u201cmetaphysics of light;\u201d when Dante and Beatrice, emerging\nfrom the \u201cgreatest body,\u201d the crystalline sphere or Primum\nMobile, pass on \u201cal ciel ch\u2019\u00e8 pura luce, / Luce\nintellettual piena d\u2019amore\u201d [Par.\n30.39\u201340], we know that we are at the precise point at which the\nbonum diffusivum sui that is God\u2019s love transforms\nitself to cosmic energy, \u201cthe love that moves the sun and the\nother stars.\u201d But poetry is perhaps the only means of defining\nthis threshold [Bonaventure, Sent. 2. d. 2, a. 2, q. 1, c. 4;\nThomas, Quodl. 6, q. 11, a. unicus 19].\n\nSimilar ambiguities appear in Dante\u2019s discussion of the\nintelligenze themselves. Since in governing the several\nheavens the intelligences engage in a kind of civil life, they must\nenjoy an active as well as a contemplative existence. But the latter\nis of a higher order than the former, and no single intelligence can\npartake of both. Influenced perhaps by Thomas\u2019s commentary,\nDante imputes to Aristotle in the Ethics the view that such\ndivine beings must know only a contemplative life [2.4.13; cp.\nAristotle, NE 10.8, 1178b; Thomas, Exp. Eth. 10, lect. 12,\n2125]. Dante\u2019s attempt to resolve the issue is oddly\nunpersuasive. He argues that the circular motion of the heavens, by\nwhich the world is governed, is really a function of the contemplative\nactivity of the intelligences [2.4.13]. Here, as in the case of the\nEmpyrean which they inhabit, we can see Aristotle\u2019s celestial\nmovers undergoing a neo-Platonizing transformation, but Dante ends\nthis stage of his discussion by noting that the truth concerning the\nIntelligences cannot be fully grasped by our earthly understanding\n[2.4.16\u201317].\n\nThe second book concludes with an extended allegory in which the\nconcentric \u201cheavens\u201d or planetary spheres are identified\nwith the seven Liberal Arts, the \u201cstarry sphere\u201d with\nphysics and metaphysics, the Primum mobile with moral\nphilosophy, and the Empyrean beyond with theology. This synthesis of\nthe natural and the intellectual universe expresses an ideal of\neducation which harks back to the late-antique sources of\ntwelfth-century Platonism, but which Dante has imbued with new life.\nHis emphasis on the ordering function of moral wisdom, and on the\nhappiness attainable through intellectual contemplation, reflects an\nengagement with the philosophical tradition, and a commitment to\nphilosophy as such, which belong to the later thirteenth century. The\nfinal chapter of Book Two affirms the beauty that consists in seeing\nthe causes of those \u201cwonders\u201d that, as the opening of the\nMetaphysics declares, draw us to philosophy.\n\nThe third book is perhaps the most important for the student of\nDante\u2019s knowledge and use of philosophy. Its central theme is\npraise of philosophy\u2019s power, as \u201cl\u2019amoroso uso\ndella sapienza,\u201d \u201cthe loving use of wisdom,\u201d to\nimpart the highest happiness to those who love her, perfecting their\nnatures and drawing them close to God, of whose majesty and wisdom her\nbeauty is the expression. It is largely a meditation on love,\nunderstood as Dante\u2019s response, intellectual, poetic, and\npsychological, to his enlightenment at the hands of the beautiful lady\nwhom he celebrates as Philosophy.\n\nEarly in the third book Dante cites the Liber de Causis:\nevery \u201csubstantial form\u201d proceeds from the first cause,\nGod, and participates in His divine nature according to its nobility\n[3.2.4\u20138; LC 1.1]. The human soul, noblest of all created forms,\nloves all things to the degree that they manifest the divine goodness,\nbut desires above all to be united with God. Philosophy is the\nexpression of this desire in such a way that it, \u201capart from the\nsoul and considered in itself, has for its subject understanding and\nfor its form an almost divine love for what is understood\u201d\n[3.11.13]. Thus it is through the love of philosophy\u2014\u201cthe\nspiritual union of the soul with\u201d [3.2.3] philosophy\nitself\u2014that humanity perfects its \u201chighest nature, in\nother words the truly human one\u2014or better, the angelic or\nrational nature\u201d [3.3.11]. For in this spiritual union, the soul\ndiscovers in itself \u201cthat fine and most precious part of the\nsoul, which is deity\u201d [3.2.19] and \u201cparticipates in the\ndivine nature in the manner of a sempiternal Intelligence\u201d\n[3.2.14]. As such it mirrors the nobility, wisdom and love of the\ndivine essence and its \u201cloving use of wisdom\u201d becomes\nunified with God \u201cthrough eternal marriage\u201d\n[3.12.11\u201314].\n\nAll of this may appear sheer fantasy, but we should remember that the\naim of philosophy as the Convivio pursues it is to attain,\nthrough natural reason, the greatest happiness of which we are capable\nin our earthly state. Such felicity is of course circumscribed by our\nmortality, and the Dante who celebrates philosophical understanding as\na quasi-mystical union with God also maintains that true union can be\ngranted only through grace to a soul made receptive by the infusion of\nthe theological virtues which transcend the workings of rational,\nnatural virtue.\n\nIn this vein, it is not surprising that Dante speaks of the soul after\ndeath as enduring \u201cperpetually in a nature that is more than\nhuman\u201d [2.8.6], and asserts that to perceive God is not possible\nfor our nature [3.15.10]. Aristotle, too, had argued that a life of\npure contemplation is beyond our strictly human capacity\u2014that we\ncan live in this way only to the extent that we have in us\n\u201csomething divine\u201d [NE 10.7, 1177b]. But for Dante, as for\nThomas Aquinas, the modus essendi of the soul joined to the\nbody differs from that of the soul in separation: though they are the\nsame in nature, the separated soul understands, not by means of\nsensory images, but through species in which it participates by virtue\nof the divine light [cf. ST 1.89.1r]. In the temporal life, however,\nas Dante acknowledges, there are truths which we can apprehend only as\nif in a dream, \u201ccome sognando,\u201d [Conv.\n2.12.4; Nardi (1944), 81\u201390], and our desire for perfect\nunderstanding is necessarily limited. To desire what is beyond the\ncapacity of our intellectual nature would be ethically and rationally\nincoherent, a desire for imperfection rather than perfection of\nunderstanding. Therefore, our love of wisdom is \u201cproportioned in\nthis life to the knowledge which we can have here, and does not go\npast that point except by an error which is outside the intention of\nnature\u201d [3.15.8\u201310].\n\nBut the Convivio continually strains against these same\nlimits that it claims are appropriate to the proper scope of human\nknowledge in our temporal condition. For Dante, first and foremost a\npoet of love, the experience of acquiring philosophical understanding\nhas an important psychological component. By enabling us to analyze\nthe processes of perception, philosophy brings us into contact with\nthe true nature of things, and for Dante, as Kenelm Foster observes,\nthe slightest such contact could have a metaphysical value:\n\n\nIt did not in one sense matter to Dante what the particular object of\nhis knowing might be, since the joy of knowing it was already a\nforetaste of all conceivable knowledge and all joy; and this precisely\nbecause, in knowing, the mind seized truth\u2026once intelligence,\nthe truth-faculty, had tasted truth as such, that is, its own\ncorrespondence with reality, it could not help desiring truth whole\nand entire, that is, its correspondence with all reality. [Foster\n(1965), 59\u201360]\n\n\nAt this point, knowledge and the joy of possessing it combine to\nprepare the ground for faith. By explaining phenomena which without\nher guidance would merely astonish us, philosophy inspires us to\nbelieve \u201cthat every miracle can be perceived by a superior\nintellect to have a reasonable cause\u201d [3.14.14]:\n\n\nAnd here our good faith has its origin; from which comes hope, which\nis desire for what is foreseen; and through this arises the act of\ncharity. Through these three virtues one ascends to philosophize in\nthat celestial Athens, where the Stoics and Peripatetics and\nEpicureans, by the light of eternal truth, in a single will, concur in\ntotal concord one with the other.\n\n\nPhilosophy thus conceived can still be regarded as the handmaid of\ntheology, but as Dante develops his philosophical ideal metaphorically\nin terms of the beauty of the donna gentile, it assumes a\nreligious value of its own. Since the wisdom she embodies is the\nconsummation of human self-realization, the donna gentile\nresides in the divine mind as \u201cthe intentional exemplar of the\nhuman essence\u201d [3.6.6]. In desiring her we desire our own\nperfection, for she is \u201cas supremely perfect as human essence\ncan be\u201d [3.6.8] When at this point Dante adds a reminder that\nnothing in our human experience can fully satisfy this desire, he\nseems to be acknowledging that what Thomas\u2019 Ethics\ncommentary refers to as the ultimate end of desire\u2019s natural\ninclination is unattainable in this life, since it would require an\nunderstanding more complete than any human being can possess [Thomas,\nExp. Eth. 1, lect. 9, 107; SCG 3.48.2].\n\nBut having provided this caution, Dante seems to ignore it, as if\nunable to resist the conviction that philosophy satisfies our desire\nin a manner proper to itself. Everything naturally desires its own\nperfection, and for human beings this is \u201cthe perfection of\nreason\u201d [3.15.3\u20134; cf. Thomas, Exp. Eth. 9, lect.\n9, 1872]. But philosophy, as embodied in the donna gentile,\nis not just the consummation of natural understanding. For Dante, as\nfor Aristotle, the human intellect as such is somehow more than human,\nand he is at times similarly unclear on the question of whether human\nbeings can attain happiness through the exercise of virtue, and to\nwhat extent it is a gift of the gods [Foster (1977), 198\u2013201].\nRepeatedly he draws a distinction between merely human happiness and\nthat attainable through grace, only to seemingly disregard it in\nsubsequent discussion. Thus in the final chapter of the third treatise\nhe acknowledges the \u201cstrong misgivings\u201d that one might\nhave about the happiness attainable through philosophy. Since certain\nthings\u2014God, eternity, and primal matter are named\u2014exceed\nthe capacity of our intellect, our natural desire to know must remain\nunfulfilled in this life [3.15.7]. Dante answers this by affirming, as\nnoted above, that the natural desire for perfection is always\nproportionate to our capacity to attain it; for to desire the\nunattainable would be to desire our imperfection [3.15.8\u201311].\nHuman happiness, then, consists in the attainment of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u201chuman good,\u201d through the exercise of the virtues. This is\nwhat Dante calls \u201cl\u2019umana operazione,\u201d and\nits end is the highest that human beings can attain through their own\npowers.\n\nYet philosophy offers the promise of more. The same chapter is\nclimaxed by the vision of Wisdom as \u201cthe mother of all\nthings,\u201d the origin of all motion and order in the created\nuniverse, guiding the quest of human wisdom by the light of the divine\nintellect. When the human mind is fully informed by philosophy, it\nwould appear, it becomes virtually one of the intelligenze,\nwho know both what is above them and what is below, God as cause and\nthe created universe as effect [3.6.4\u20136]. Thus Dante can speak\nof our rational nature as, simultaneously our \u201ctruly\nhuman\u201d and \u201cour angelic nature\u201d [Moevs (2005),\n83\u201386].\n\nThe Liber de causis says that each cause infuses into its\neffect the goodness it receives from its own cause, or, in the case of\nthe soul, from God [Conv. 3.6.11; LC 4.48]. When gazing on\nthe body of the donna gentile, we are perceiving the effect\nof a cause which is ultimately God, and thus, Dante asserts\n[3.6.12\u201313]:\n\n\ninsofar as, with regard to her bodily aspect, marvelous things are\nseen in her\u2026 it is evident that her form, that is her soul,\nwhich directs it [her bodily aspect] as its proper cause, miraculously\nreceives the beloved goodness of God. And so it is demonstrated by\nthis appearance that, beyond the due of our nature (which is most\nperfect in her, as was stated above), this lady is favored by God and\nmade a noble thing.\n\n\nThus in effect the donna gentile is the perfection we desire.\nThrough her we experience the divine goodness, by an outflowing, a\ndiscorrimento, which Dante glosses with a further reference\nto the Liber de Causis [3.7.2; LC 20.157] in terms of the\nhierarchical emanation of the divine goodness. In the quasi-continuous\nseries of gradations that descends from angel to brute animal, there\nis no intervening grade between man and angel, so that some human\nbeings are so noble as to be nothing less than angels [Aristotle, NE\n7.1, 1145a]. Such is the donna gentile; she receives divine\nvirtue just as the angels do [3.7.7]. She is a thing visibilmente\nmiraculosa, ordained from eternity by God in testimonio de la\nfede for us [3.7.16\u201317; Foster (1965), 56], and God, by\ninstilling his radiance in her love of philosophy,\n\u201cassimilates\u201d her form \u201cto his likeness insofar as\nit is possible to be like Him\u201d [3.14.3; cf. Thomas, SCG\n1.91].\n\nPhilosophy has clearly become far more than the means whereby human\nnature achieves self-realization, though this ideal continues to\nprovide a framework for Dante\u2019s praise of her. She has assumed\nthe status of Wisdom, sapientia, the divine mind as expressed\nin the order and harmony of creation. Like the separate substances and\nGod Himself, her beauty can only be described in terms of its effects.\nThe true philosopher \u201cloves every part of wisdom, and wisdom\nevery part of the philosopher, since she draws him to herself in full\nmeasure\u201d [3.11.12]. Moreover, because the object of every\nphilosopher\u2019s contemplation is the same angelic intelligence,\nphilosophical activity also unites individual human beings to\ndonna gentile in such a way that, as Ardizzone has put it,\nemphasizes a \u201cprinciple of unity in which the cosmological order\nis the expression of a superior intellectual love and desire, one\nwhich human and superhuman beings may share\u201d [Ardizzone (2016),\n274].\n\nHere we may recall Dante\u2019s account of how the swift motion of\nthe Primum Mobile expresses its desire for total participation in the\ndivinity of the Empyrean [2.3.8]. And it is in such terms that Dante\nends his account of philosophy-as-wisdom. In the final chapter of the\nthird treatise, she is explicitly identified with the all-creating\nWisdom of God as \u201cthe mother of all things and the origin of\nevery motion\u201d [3.15.15], and Dante concludes in prophetic\nexhortation [3.15.17]:\n\n\nOh, worse than dead are you who flee her friendship! Open your eyes\nand look; for, before you were, she loved you, preparing and ordering\nthe process that created you; and once you were made, to show you the\nway she came to you in your likeness.\n\n\nThe fourth treatise of the Convivio seems to have been\nwritten later than the first three, and it is markedly different in\norientation. The principal theme of its canzone is the true\nnature of nobility. Introducing his prose discussion, Dante gives a\ncurious account of how an interruption in his philosophical studies,\ncaused by what the canzone calls \u201cdisdainful and\nharsh\u201d behavior on the part of the donna gentile,\nprovided an occasion for taking up this topic:\n\n\nSo, since this lady of mine had slightly altered her sweet expressions\ntoward me, above all where I investigated and researched whether the\nprime matter of the elements was comprehended by God\u2014because of\nwhich I refrained for a while from being in the presence of her\nface\u2014living more or less without her, I started to reflect on\nthe human defect related to the above-mentioned error [i.e., a false\nperception of the bases of human nobility]. [4.1.8]\n\n\nThat God is the creator of prime matter was an article of faith, and\nThomas had dealt decisively with the role of divine will and intellect\nin the creative act [SCG 2.20.7, 21\u201324]. That Dante should admit\nto having entertained doubts about such a question is perhaps a way\nhedging against or concealing the heterodox implications of his claims\nin book 3 [Ardizzone (2016)]. Alternatively, he may have sensed\nhimself idolizing the secondary powers in whose hierarchical\ncirculazione he felt himself, as poet, to be in a special\nsense participant, and allowing these preoccupations to cloud his\nawareness of God\u2019s omnipotence. The anger of the donna\ngentile would then express his sense of a corresponding loss of\nfocus, a failure to affirm her unique and transcendent role in the\nexpression of the divine will. Or perhaps Dante had come to regard the\nmetaphysical exposition of books 2 and 3 as incidental to what he\nregarded as a more significant philosophical theme that emerges in\nbook 4.\n\nWhatever the precise nature of the dilemma to which Dante alludes, the\nfourth treatise is marked by a noticeable shift away from metaphysics\nin the direction of ethics and rhetoric. Philosophical knowledge is\nredirected to the purposes of social and political life, and the\ntreatise, while punctuated like the others by numerous digressions,\npursues a single sustained argument. Dante begins by explaining that\nsocial order is a necessary condition for human happiness and that it\nrequires a single governor whose authority embraces that of all\nparticular governors and directs their several efforts to a single end\n[4.4]. After a long digression on the role of Rome in the providential\ndesign of human history, he turns from political to philosophical\nauthority, citing Aristotle as in effect the governor of the mind,\n\u201cmaster and guide of human reason insofar as it is occupied with\nits final end\u201d [4.6.8]. From this, Dante derives the conclusion\nthat even an emperor\u2019s authority must be circumscribed insofar\nas the art of ruling and the laws it creates cannot overrule rational\njudgment based on the laws of nature [4.9].\n\nOn this basis Dante proceeds to refute the view that nobility consists\nin wealth and ancestry, a view which he here attributes to Frederick\nII, \u201cthe last emperor of the Romans,\u201d and for which he\nwill elsewhere cite Aristotle\u2019s Politics [Mon.\n2.3.4; Pol. 4.8, 1294a]. Perhaps as significant as the\narguments he musters to show the treacherous nature of riches and the\nuncertain course of nobility from one generation to another is the\nassertion of Dante\u2019s own authority, as philosopher and citizen,\nthat is implied by his elaborate apology for speaking as he does\n[Ascoli (1989), 35\u201341]. The gesture nicely epitomizes the\nproject of the Convivio, a vernacular discourse which defines\nfor its lay audience the limits of political and scholastic authority\nand affirms the autonomy and potential dignity of individual human\nreason.\n\nThe later portions of the fourth treatise are grounded in an\nAristotelian definition of nobility, as the perfection of a thing\naccording to its nature [Conv. 4.16.7; Physics 7.3,\n246a]. The human expression of this perfection is virtue, moral and\nintellectual. Electing to address the moral virtues, as more\naccessible to a lay understanding, Dante begins by describing how\nnobility is implanted in the nascent soul as the seed of virtue, from\nwhich spring the two branches of the active and the contemplative\nlife. The final chapters of the Convivio show how the virtues\nthat stem from nobility can direct the natural appetite of the mind,\nenabling it to evolve through love of them to the happiness which is\nthe end of virtue [Conv. 4.17.8\u20139; NE 1.13, 1102a].\n\nIn the final stanza of the canzone analyzed in the fourth\ntreatise, Dante addresses the poem itself as\n\u201cContra-li-erranti,\u201d his\n\u201cContra-the-mistaken,\u201d and the final chapter of the\ncommentary explains this as an allusion to the Summa contra\ngentiles of Thomas, written \u201cto confound all those who\ndeviate from our Faith\u201d [Conv. 4.30.3]. By thus\ndeclaring himself the follower of so fine a craftsman, Dante suggests,\nhe hopes to \u201cennoble\u201d his own undertaking.\n\nThe Contra gentiles may seem an odd choice of model. Bruno\nNardi considers that Dante had at most a superficial knowledge of this\nwork at the time when he wrote the Convivio, and it is\ncertainly the case that he is fundamentally at odds with Thomas over\nsuch specific matters as the origin of the soul, the role of the\ncelestial intelligences in creation, and, more important, in claiming\nfor philosophy the power to fulfil the human desire for knowledge in\nthis life [Nardi (1992), 28\u201329]. On all of these matters, Dante\nis closer to the position of Albert.\n\nIn any case, having dwelt at length on the insatiability of the base\ndesire for riches, Dante addresses the question of whether our desire\nfor knowledge, too, since it continues to grow as knowledge is\nacquired, is not similarly base. Dante begins his answer by asserting\nthat \u201cthe supreme desire of each thing, the primal one given by\nits nature, is to return to its principle\u201d or cause, and he\nillustrates this proposition by the images of a traveller on an\nunfamiliar road, who imagines each house he encounters to be the inn\nhe seeks, and the desires of youth, which focus first on an apple or a\npet bird, then evolve to encompass love and prosperity [Conv.\n4.12.14\u201316]. But while this may seem to evoke Thomas\u2019s\nview of a single desire which seeks to grow continuously toward union\nwith God, Dante\u2019s point is that the path to fulfillment involves\nmultiple desires and the attainment of multiple perfections\n[Conv. 4.13.1\u20132]:\n\n\n\u2026the desire for knowledge cannot be said to grow in\nthe proper sense, even if as was stated earlier it does\nexpand in a certain way. This is because anything which grows\nin the proper sense is always one; the desire for knowledge is not\nalways one but is many\u2014when one is completed, another comes\nalong\u2014so that properly speaking, its expansion is not growth but\na progression from something small to something large. For if I desire\nto know the principles of natural things, no sooner do I know them\nthan this desire is satisfied and fulfilled. And if I subsequently\ndesire to know the what and the how of each of these principles, this\nis another, new desire, the occurrence of which does nothing to take\naway the perfection to which the other desire led me; and this\nexpansion is not a cause of imperfection, but of greater perfection or\ncompleteness.\n\n\nThomas can speak of the natural desire to know as a force like\ngravity, whose attraction intensifies as it approaches its object [SCG\n3.25.13]. In contrast Dante\u2019s insistence on types and stages of\nknowing may seem almost perverse, a matter of emphasizing the stages\nof the mind\u2019s ascent rather than a single, unified desire that\nleads it forward from stage to stage. But what is at stake for Dante\nis the need to acknowledge human ends as having a definite value of\ntheir own, and this need will play an equally important role in\nDante\u2019s other major philosophical works.\n",
