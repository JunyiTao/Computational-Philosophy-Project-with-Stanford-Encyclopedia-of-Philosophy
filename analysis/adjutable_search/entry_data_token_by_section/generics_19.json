For example, if people are\ntold that a given percentage of a novel animal kind has a property,\nthey are often willing to accept the corresponding generic at\nprevalence levels of 50%, 30%, or even 10%, particularly if the\nproperty being described is dangerous and/or characteristic of the\nkind. However, if people are instead presented with the generic and\nasked to estimate the prevalence of the property, the estimates are\nvery high indeed\u2014often reaching 100% (Cimpian, Brandone et al.\n2010). Preschool-aged children show a similar pattern (Brandone et al.\n2015).\n\nThese studies show that people give very high estimates of prevalence\nwhen presented with a generic statement concerning a novel animal\nkind. When the generics concern familiar kinds, prevalence estimates\ncan be more realistic. Nevertheless, accepting a generic increases\npeople\u2019s tendency to believe a given member of the kind will\nhave the property in question, over and above their beliefs about the\nprevalence of the property (Khemlani, Leslie, and Glucksberg 2012).\nFor example, people correctly give comparable prevalence estimates\nconcerning the number of ducks that are female vs. lay eggs. However,\nwhen asked to judge whether a given duck would have a property (e.g.,\n\u201csuppose you are told that Quacky is a duck. Evaluate the\nfollowing statement: Quacky lays eggs\u201d), people were\nsignificantly more likely to agree that the duck would lay eggs than\nthey were that the duck would be female (Khemlani et al. 2012). These\nresults suggest that people may treat generics as being inferentially\nquite powerful, in a way that cannot be reduced to their background\nbeliefs about the prevalence of the property. When people are asked to\njudge whether a given member of a kind will have a property or not,\nthey rely in part on their background judgment of the generic, rather\nthan solely on their beliefs about how prevalent the property is.\n\nThese findings support the idea that accepting a generic disposes\npeople\u2014all else being equal\u2014to believe that an arbitrary\ninstance of the kind will have the property, as has long been\nsuggested in the defeasible reasoning literature (e.g., Pelletier and\nAsher 1997). However, the defeasible reasoning literature has tended\nto focus on \u201cnon-troublesome\u201d, high prevalence generics\nlike \u201ctigers are striped\u201d; it is notable that people show\na tendency to draw such inferences even for lower prevalence\ngenerics.\n",
