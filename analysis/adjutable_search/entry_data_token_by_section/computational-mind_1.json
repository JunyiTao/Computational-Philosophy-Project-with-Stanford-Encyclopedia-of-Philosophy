    "main_text": "Artificial intelligence\n2. Artificial intelligence\nRapid progress in computer science prompted many, including Turing,\nto contemplate whether we could build a computer capable of\nthought.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to construct\n\u201cthinking machinery\u201d. More precisely, it aims to construct\ncomputing machines that execute core mental tasks such as reasoning,\ndecision-making, problem solving, and so on. During the 1950s and\n1960s, this goal came to seem increasingly realistic (Haugeland\n1985).\nEarly AI research emphasized logic. Researchers sought to\n\u201cmechanize\u201d deductive reasoning. A famous example was\nthe Logic Theorist computer program (Newell and Simon 1956),\nwhich proved 38 of the first 52 theorems from Principia\nMathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1925). In one case, it\ndiscovered a simpler proof than Principia\u2019s.\nEarly success of this kind stimulated enormous interest inside and\noutside the academy. Many researchers predicted that intelligent\nmachines were only a few years away. Obviously, these predictions have\nnot been fulfilled. Intelligent robots do not yet walk among us. Even\nrelatively low-level mental processes such as perception vastly exceed\nthe capacities of current computer programs. When confident\npredictions of thinking machines proved too optimistic, many observers\nlost interest or concluded that AI was a fool\u2019s\nerrand. Nevertheless, the decades have witnessed gradual progress. One\nstriking success was IBM\u2019s Deep Blue, which defeated chess\nchampion Gary Kasparov in 1997. Another major success was the\ndriverless car Stanley (Thrun, Montemerlo, Dahlkamp, et al. 2006),\nwhich completed a 132-mile course in the Mojave Desert, winning the\n2005 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand\nChallenge. A less flashy success story is the vast improvement in\nspeech recognition algorithms.\nOne problem that dogged early work in AI is uncertainty.\nNearly all reasoning and decision-making operates under conditions of\nuncertainty. For example, you may need to decide whether to go on a\npicnic while being uncertain whether it will rain. Bayesian\ndecision theory is the standard mathematical model of\ninference and decision-making under uncertainty. Uncertainty is codified\nthrough probability. Precise rules dictate how to update\nprobabilities in light of new evidence and how to select actions in\nlight of probabilities and utilities. (See the\nentries Bayes\u2019s theorem\nand normative theories of rational choice: expected utility\n for details.)  In the 1980s and\n1990s, technological and conceptual developments enabled efficient\ncomputer programs that implement or approximate Bayesian inference in\nrealistic scenarios. An explosion of Bayesian AI ensued (Thrun,\nBurgard, and Fox 2006), including the aforementioned advances in\nspeech recognition and driverless vehicles. Tractable algorithms that\nhandle uncertainty are a major achievement of contemporary AI (Murphy 2012), and\npossibly a harbinger of more impressive future progress.\nSome philosophers insist that computers, no matter how\nsophisticated they become, will at best mimic rather\nthan replicate thought. A computer simulation of the weather\ndoes not really rain. A computer simulation of flight does not really\nfly. Even if a computing system could simulate mental activity, why\nsuspect that it would constitute the genuine article?\nTuring (1950) anticipated these worries and tried to defuse\nthem. He proposed a scenario, now called the Turing Test,\nwhere one evaluates whether an unseen interlocutor is a computer or a\nhuman. A computer passes the Turing test if one cannot\ndetermine that it is a computer. Turing proposed that we abandon the\nquestion \u201cCould a computer think?\u201d as hopelessly vague,\nreplacing it with the question \u201cCould a computer pass the Turing\ntest?\u201d.  Turing\u2019s discussion has received considerable\nattention, proving especially influential within AI. Ned Block (1981)\noffers an influential critique. He argues that certain possible\nmachines pass the Turing test even though these machines do not come\nclose to genuine thought or intelligence. See the\nentry the Turing test for discussion of\nBlock\u2019s objection and other issues surrounding the Turing\nTest.\nFor more on AI, see the entry\n logic and artificial intelligence.\n For much more detail, see Russell and\nNorvig (2010).\n",
