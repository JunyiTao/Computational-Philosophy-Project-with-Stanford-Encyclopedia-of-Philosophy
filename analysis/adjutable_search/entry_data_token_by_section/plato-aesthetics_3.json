    "main_text": "Beauty || The Form of beauty\n1.3 The Form of beauty\n\nThe fundamental datum in understanding Platonic beauty as part of\nPlato\u2019s aesthetics is that Plato sees no opposition between the\npleasures that beauty brings and the goals of philosophy. Plato\nmentions no other Form in the Symposium; the Form of beauty\nis Form enough. Philosophers meet this beauty in an experience in\nwhich they consummate their deepest love while also attaining the\nloftiest knowledge. \n\nMany passages in Plato associate a Form with beauty: Cratylus\n439c; Euthydemus 301a; Laws 655c; Phaedo\n65d, 75d, 100b; Phaedrus 254b; Parmenides 130b;\nPhilebus 15a; Republic 476b, 493e, 507b. Plato\nmentions beauty as often as he speaks of any property that admits of\nphilosophical conceptualization, and for which a Form therefore\nexists. Thanks to the features of Forms as such, we know that this\nentity being referred to must be something properly called beauty,\nwhose nature can be articulated without recourse to the natures of\nparticular beautiful things. (See especially Phaedo 79a and\nPhaedrus 247c on properties of this Form.)\n\nBeauty is Plato\u2019s example of a Form so frequently for a pair of\nreasons. On one hand it bears every mark of the Forms. It is an\nevaluative concept as much as justice and courage are, and suffers\nfrom disputes over its meaning as much as they do. The Theory of Forms\nseeks to guarantee stable referents for disputed evaluative terms; so\nif anything needs a Form, beauty does, and it will have a Form if any\nproperty does.\n\nIn general, a Form F differs from an individual F\nthing in that F may be predicated univocally of the Form: The\nForm F is F. An individual F thing\nboth is and is not F. In this sense the same property\nF can only be predicated equivocally of the individual (e.g.\nRepublic 479a\u2013c). Plato\u2019s analysis of equivocally\nF individuals (Cratylus 439d\u2013e,\nSymposium 211a) recalls observations that everyone makes\nabout beautiful objects. They fade with time; require an offsetting\nugly detail; elicit disagreements among observers; lose their beauty\noutside their context (adult shoes on children\u2019s feet). Here beauty\ndoes better than most other properties at meeting the criteria for\nForms and non-Forms. Odd numbers may fail to be odd in some\nhard-to-explain way, but the ways in which beautiful things fall short\nof their perfection are obvious even to the unphilosophical.\n\nBut physical beauty is atypical being a Form that humans want\nto know. This is the second reason Plato makes beauty such a frequent\nexample of a Form. The process known as anamn\u00easis or\nrecollection is more plausible for beauty than it is for most other\nproperties. The philosophical merit of equivocally F things\nis that they come bearing signs of their incompleteness, so that the\ninquisitive mind wants to know more (Republic\n523c\u2013524d). But not everyone can read those signs of\nincompleteness. Soft or large items inspire questions in minds of an\nabstract bent. The perception of examples of justice or self-control\npresupposes moral development before someone can recognize a law\u2019s\ndouble nature as just and unjust. By contrast, beautiful things strike\neveryone, and arouse everyone\u2019s curiosity. Therefore, beauty promises\nmore effective reflection than any other property of things. Beauty\nalone is both a Form and a sensory experience (Phaedrus\n250d).\n\nSo the Phaedrus (250d\u2013256b) and Symposium\nignore people\u2019s experiences of other properties when they describe the\nfirst movement into philosophizing. Beautiful things remind souls of\ntheir mystery as no other visible objects do, and in his optimistic\nmoments Plato welcomes people\u2019s attention to them.\n\nThose optimistic moments are not easy to sustain. To make beauty\neffective for learning Plato needs to rely on its desirability (as\nforegrounded in Konstan 2015) while also counting on the soul\u2019s\nability to transfer its desiring from the visible to the intelligible\n(see Philebus 65e). Plato is ambivalent about visual\nexperience. Sight may be metaphorically like knowledge, but\nmetonymically it calls to mind the ignorant senses (Pappas 2015,\n49).\n\nBeauty\u2019s unmatched pedagogical effects, when the transfer of desire\nsucceeds, show why Plato talks about its goodness and good\nconsequences, sometimes even its identity with \u201cthe good\u201d\n(Laws 841c; Philebus 66a\u2013b; Republic\n401c; Symposium 201c, 205e; but the relationship between\nbeautiful and good, especially in Symposium, is\ncontroversial: White 1989). These desirable effects also explain why\nPlato speaks grudgingly of beauty in art and poetry. Another question\nmatters more than either poetry or beauty does: What leads a mind\ntoward knowledge and the Forms? Things of beauty do so excellently\nwell. Poems mostly don\u2019t. When poems (or paintings) set the mind\nrunning along unphilosophical tracks away from what is abstract and\nintelligible, the attractions they possess will be seen as\nmeretricious. The corrupting cognitive effect exercised by poems\ndemonstrates their inability to function as Plato knows the beautiful\nobject to function.\n\nThe corrupting effect needs to be spelled out. What prevents poems\nfrom behaving as beautiful objects do? The answer will have to address\nthe orienting question in Plato\u2019s aesthetics, namely: What fosters\nphilosophical enlightenment, and what obstructs it?\n",
