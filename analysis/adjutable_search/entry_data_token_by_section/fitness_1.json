    "main_text": "Ecological Fitness\n2. Ecological Fitness\n \n\nIn an intuitive sense, \u2018fitness\u2019 can refer to the\ncorrespondence between the shape of an object and an empty volume it is\nplaced in: a square peg fits into a square hole. In a more abstract\nfashion, one might refer to the properties of an entity and how they\ncorrespond to the constraints of its context. In a biological setting\none could focus on an organism\u2019s traits and how they correspond\nto various aspects of the environment the organism is living\nin. Following biological usage, call this concept \u2018ecological\nfitness\u2019. (It has also been called \u2018vernacular\nfitness,\u2019 cf. Matthen and Ariew 2002.) The\n\u2018vernacular\u2019 definition is fraught with\ndifficulties. Suppose, following Dennett (1995) we characterize the\nrelation \u2018\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\)\u2019 as follows:\n \n\n\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\) if and only if \\(x\\)\u2019s\ntraits enable it to solve the \u2018design problems\u2019 set by the\nenvironment more fully than \\(y\\)\u2019s traits do.\n\n\nOne may ask, What are these design problems? How many of them are\nthere? Is there any way of measuring the degree to which \\(x\\)\nexceeds \\(y\\) in their solution? Answers to these questions\nsimply reinforce the threat of tautology that faces the theory. To\nbegin with the notion of \u201cdesign problems\u201d is vague and\nmetaphorical; or, if treated literally, design problems will all be\nrelative to the overarching objective of leaving more\ndescendants. Thus the definition may simply hide the original problem\nof distinguishing fitness from reproductive rates, instead of solving\nit.\n\n\nSecond, the number of design problems is equal to the number of\ndistinct environmental features that affect survival, and of course\nreproduction, and this number is probably uncountable. Accordingly,\nprima facie, the proposed definition provides no hope of cardinal or\neven ordinal measurement that would enable us to predict or explain\nquantitatively differences in rates of reproduction, and the\nevolutionary processes that depend on these rates. Moreover,\necological fitness accounts may not have provided a satisfactory story\nabout how to carve up the relevant reference environment that is\nsupposed to have an impact on the survival of said organisms (Abrams\n2009). It is no wonder that biologists, sensible of the importance of\npredictive precision and explanatory testability, have had little\ntruck with ecological fitness and have defined \u2018\\(x\\) is\nfitter than \\(y\\)\u2019 in terms of quantitatively measurable\nreproductive rates. This tendency of course simply adds force to the\noriginal argument. If the only way to make fitness differences\nscientifically tractable is to trivialize the theory, so much the\nworse for the theory.\n",
