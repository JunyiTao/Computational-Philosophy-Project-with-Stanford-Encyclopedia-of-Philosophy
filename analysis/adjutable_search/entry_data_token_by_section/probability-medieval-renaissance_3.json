    "main_text": "Medieval probability-related terminology || Verisimilis\n2.2 Verisimilis\n\nIn medieval usage, verisimilis meant what it literally said:\nthat something was \u2018truth-like\u2019. This did not, however,\nimply that the thing was actually close to truth, because it might\nhave only the appearance \u2013 possibly spurious or superficial\n\u2013 of truth. Signs, images, and circumstantial evidence were\noften called verisimilis if they satisfied these conditions.\nMedieval lawyers spoke of \u2018truth-like circumstantial\nevidence\u2019 (indicia verisimilia), and Albert of Cologne\n(Logica, 241) maintained that what was\n\u2018truth-like\u2019 resided in \u2018signs\u2019\n(verisimile est in\n signis).[7]\n\nWas verisimilis used as a synonym for probabilis by\nmedieval scholastics? Albert (ibid.) claims straightforwardly that\n\u201cprobable things are truth-like\u201d (probabilia \u2026\nsunt\n verisimilia).[8]\n Other scholastic uses of these words suggest instead a mere relation\nof frequent mutual implication. Probable opinions were usually\ntruth-like because their probability prima facie justified an\nassumption of truth. Truth-like signs often justified an ascription of\nprobability to an assertion. The widespread combination of\nprobabilis with particular kinds of proposition (Aristotelian\nendoxa; see Section 3.1) and of verisimilis with\nsigns are nevertheless good reasons to assume that these predicates\nwere not synonymous. The distinction between the terms may reflect\nestablished differences in ancient Greek terminology, tying\nprobabilis to pithanon (persuasive, adoptable) and\nverisimilis to eikos (truth-like). Such differences\narguably already pervaded Cicero\u2019s usage of probabilis\nand verisimilis, although the matter is\n contentious.[9]\n",
