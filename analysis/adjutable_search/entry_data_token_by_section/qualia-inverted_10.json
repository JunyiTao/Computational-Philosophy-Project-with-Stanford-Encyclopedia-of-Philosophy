    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026For Appearance Properties\n3.3 \u2026For Appearance Properties\n\n\nReturn to the anti-representationalist argument of the previous\nsubsection:\n\nArgument B\n\nP1.\n\nNeither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of the\ntomato.\nP2.\n\nThe tomato is red (and not any other color).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\nThe tomato looks the same color (namely, red) to both Invert and\nNonvert.\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal difference\nbetween Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the colors that\ntheir experiences represent the tomato as having.\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\n\n\n\nRepresentationalists usually resist P1. But there are other options.\nAccording to Shoemaker, the flaw in the argument is not P1, but rather\nP3. In addition to representing colors, Shoemaker thinks that visual\nexperiences represent other (\u201ccolorlike\u201d) properties that\nwe do not have words for in English, and which he calls appearance\n properties.[41]\n On this view, both Invert and Nonvert\u2019s\nexperiences represent the tomato as red. However, Invert\u2019s\nexperience also represents the tomato as having a certain salient\nappearance property (call it\n\u2018\\(AP_{G}\\)\u2019), while Nonvert\u2019s\nexperience represents the tomato as having a certain salient appearance\nproperty \\((AP_{R})\\). It is this\nrepresentational difference between Invert and Nonvert that accounts\nfor the phenomenological difference between their experiences. One may,\nthen, view Shoemaker\u2019s main argument for appearance properties as\nproceeding from P1, P2, and representationalism (i.e., not-C2), to the\nconclusion that P3 is false.\n\n\nWhat are the appearance properties \\(AP_{G}\\)\nand \\(AP_{R}\\)? Since Shoemaker thinks that it\nis implausible that Invert is systematically misperceiving the colors,\nit is not surprising that he also thinks that neither Nonvert nor\nInvert is systematically misperceiving the appearance properties. The\ntomato, then, has both \\(AP_{G}\\) and\n\\(AP_{R}\\). In Shoemaker 1994b,\n\\(AP_{R}\\) is said to be (where\n\\(Q_{R}\\) \u201cis the quale that characterizes\n[Nonvert\u2019s] experience of red things\u201d) the property of\n\u201ccurrently producing [a \\(Q_{R}\\)]\nexperience in someone related to it in a certain way, namely someone\nviewing it under normal lighting conditions\u201d (254), and\nsimilarly for \\(AP_{G}\\) (see also Shoemaker\n1994a). This secures the result that the tomato has\n\\(AP_{R}\\) when Nonvert is looking at it; as\nShoemaker notes, it implies that the tomato lacks\n\\(AP_{R}\\) when it is not being perceived. This\naccount of appearance properties has been substantially revised and\ndeveloped in Shoemaker\u2019s later work. According to Shoemaker 2002,\nappearance properties include dispositions to produce certain\nexperiences in certain perceivers (a suggestion that was considered\nbut rejected in Shoemaker 1994a, b). Shoemaker 2006a revises the\naccount further; for discussion, see Egan 2006 and Speaks 2015, ch. 22.\n\n\nThau (2002, Ch. 5) holds a similar view, but there are some\nimportant differences. First, Thau\u2019s argument does not turn on the need\nto secure spectrum inversion without misrepresentation, and instead\ndeploys an adaptation of Jackson\u2019s (1982) thought experiment concerning\nblack-and-white Mary. (See the entry on\n qualia: the knowledge argument.)\n Second, because Thau is not concerned to\nensure that neither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the tomato, he\ndoes not try to argue that the tomato has both\n\\(AP_{G}\\) and \\(AP_{R}\\),\nleaving the question unexamined. Third, Thau\u2019s argument for appearance\nproperties commits him to the view that they cannot be named (222\u20135);\nShoemaker is not so committed. Finally, Thau does not think, unlike\nShoemaker, that colors are visually represented (211). According to\nThau, beliefs about the colors of things are based on experiences that\nrepresent objects as having appearance properties. These beliefs are\njustified, Thau argues, because there is a correlation between an\nobject\u2019s having color \\(C\\) and its looking to have\nAP\\(_{C}\\) (235\u20136).\n",
