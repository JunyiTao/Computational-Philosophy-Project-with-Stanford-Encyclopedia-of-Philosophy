For Wundt, sensations\nand our somatic sensory apparatus are especially important for the\nproject of physiological psychology for the simple reason that\nsensations are the \u201ccontact points\u201d between the physical\nand the psychological (PP I: 1). Sensations\n(Empfindungen), as the medium between the physical and\npsychic, are uniquely susceptible to a double-sided\n inquiry,[23]\n viz. from the \u201cexternal\u201d physical side of stimulus, and\nthe \u201cinternal\u201d psychological side of corresponding mental\nrepresentation\n (Vorstellung).[24]\n The Wundtian psychologist therefore controls the external,\nphysiological side experimentally, in order to generate diverse\ninternal representations that can only \u201cappear\u201d to the\nintrospective observer. According to Wundt, the representations\n(Vorstellungen) that constitute the contents\n(Inhalt) of consciousness all have their elemental basis in\nsensations (Empfindungen) (PP I:\n 281).[25]\n Sensations are never given to us as elemental, however; we never\napperceive them \u201cpurely\u201d, but always already\n\u201ccombined\u201d (verbunden) in the representation of a\nsynthesized perception (PP I: 281). Yet, the manifestly\ncomposite nature of our representations forces us to abstract such\nelementary components (PP I: 281) (cf. PP II: 256).\nPure sensations, according to Wundt, display three differentiae:\nquality, intensity, and \u201cfeeling-tone\u201d\n(Gef\u00fchlston) (PP I:\n 282\u20133).[26]\n\nHis treatment of quality and intensity are especially important for\ngetting a clearer notion of his notion of psychological\nexperimentation. It is a \u201cfact of inner experience\u201d that\n\u201cevery sensation possesses a certain intensity with respect to\nwhich it may be compared to other sensations, especially those of\nsimilar quality\u201d (PP I: 332). The outer sensory stimuli\nmay be measured by physical methods, whereas psychology is\ngiven the corresponding\n\n\ntask of determining to what degree our immediate estimation\n[Sch\u00e4tzung] [of the strength of sensory stimuli] that we\nmake aided by our sensations\u2014to what degree this estimation\ncorresponds to or deviates from the stimuli\u2019s real\nstrength. (PP I: 332\u20133)\n\n\nThere are two possible tasks for psychophysical measurement of\nsense-stimuli: the \u201cdetermination of limit-values between which\nstimulus-changes are accompanied by changes in sensation\u201d; and\n\u201cthe investigation of the lawful relations between\nstimulus-change and change in sensation\u201d (PP I: 333).\nSensation can thus be measured with respect to changes in intensity\ncorresponding to changes in strength of stimuli (PP\nI: 335\u20136).\n\nWeber\u2019s Law (WL) is the most striking example of such a\nrelation, and Wundt\u2019s interpretation of WL sheds much light on\nwhat he means by \u201cphysiological psychology\u201d. Wundt\nwrites:\n\n\nWe can formulate [this law] as follows: A difference between any two\nstimuli is estimated [gesch\u00e4tzt] to be equal if the\nrelationship between the stimuli is equal. Or: If in our apprehension\n[Auffassung] the intensity of the sensation is to increase by\nequal amounts, then the relative stimulus-increase must remain\nconstant. This latter statement may also be expressed as follows: The\nstrength of a stimulus must increase geometrically if the strength of\nthe apperceived sensation is to increase arithmetically. (PP\nI: 359)\n\n\nNow these various\n formulations[27]\n of WL admit, as Wundt says, of three different, and indeed\nincompatible interpretations; that is, there are three different\nconceptions of what WL is a law of. First, the physiological\ninterpretation takes it as a manifestation of the \u201cpeculiar laws\nof excitation of the neural\n matter;\u201d[28]\n second, the psychophysical (Fechnerian) interpretation takes WL as\ngoverning the interrelation between somatic and psychic activity\n(PP I: 392). Wundt rejects both of these in favor of a third,\nthe psychological interpretation; his arguments are instructive.\nAgainst the physiological interpretation Wundt raises the following\nmain point, viz. that\n\n\nthe estimation of the intensity of sensation\n(Empfindungsintensit\u00e4t) is a complicated process, upon\nwhich\u2014in addition to the central sensory excitation\u2014the\neffectiveness of the center of apperception will exert considerable\ninfluence. We can obviously say nothing immediate about how\nthe central sense-excitations would be sensed independently of the\nlatter; thus Weber\u2019s Law, too, concerns only\napperceived sensations, and therefore can just as well have\nits basis in the processes of the apperceptive comparison of sensation\nas in the original constitution of the central sensory excitations.\n(PP I: 391\u20132)\n\n\nNow apperception (see below) is a purely psychological act in\nconsciousness\u2014and it is solely as a law of the psychological\nprocesses involved in the \u201cmeasuring comparison of\nsensations\u201d that Wundt understands WL (PP I: 393). In\nother words, WL\n\n\ndoes not apply to sensations in and for themselves, but to processes\nof apperception, without which a quantitative estimation of sensations\ncould never take place. (PP I: 393; cf. PP II:\n269)\n\n\nWundt sees WL as simply a mathematical description of the more general\nexperience that\n\n\nwe possess in our consciousness no absolute, but merely a relative\nmeasure of the intensity of the conditions [Zust\u00e4nde]\nobtaining in it, and that we therefore measure in each case one\ncondition against another, with which we are obliged in the first\nplace to compare it. (PP I: 393)\n\n\nFor this reason Wundt\u2019s \u201cpsychological\ninterpretation\u201d makes WL into a special case of a more general\nlaw of consciousness, viz. \u201cof the relation or\nrelativity of our inner conditions\n[Zust\u00e4nde]\u201d (PP I: 393). WL is therefore\nnot a law of sensation so much as of apperception.\n\nThis solution typifies Wundt\u2019s general view that the domains of\npsychic and physical phenomena do not stand in conflict, but rather\nconstitute separate spheres of (causal) explanation. His\ninterpretation of WL nicely illustrates how, on his view,\nphysiological experiments can yield mathematically expressible\nresults, not about the physical, somatic processes involved in\nsensation, but about the relationships among these sensations as\napperceived, i.e., as psychological elements and objects\nof consciousness. He writes that \u201cthe psychological\ninterpretation offers the advantage of not excluding a simultaneous\n[i.e. parallel] physiological explanation\u201d (presumably once the\nneurophysiological facts of the matter have been better elucidated\n\u2014 cf. PP I: 391); by contrast, the two competing\ninterpretations \u201conly permit a one-sided explanation\u201d of\nWL (PP I: 393).\n",
