    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nIn the introduction to ha-Emunah ha-Ramah (henceforth:\nER) Abraham Ibn Daud states that he decided to write his book\nin order to solve the problem of free will. Scripture fails to provide\nan unequivocal answer to this problem, since biblical verses on this\nissue seem to contradict one another. Ibn Daud is convinced that\nphilosophy can help to distinguish between the verses that should be\nunderstood literally and those that are in need of interpretation. In\nhis view, the problem in his day is that those who have begun to study\nphilosophy are unable to keep the lamps of philosophy and religion\nburning simultaneously \u201cfor if the lamp of philosophy is\nkindled, the lamp of religion goes out\u201d (ER W 2; S\n 3b-4b).[1]\n This is why certain people believe that it is better to steer well\nclear of the study of philosophy. The consequence thereof is that many\nJews are at a loss when it comes to solving religious problems, such\nas the problem of free will. According to Ibn Daud, this is because\nthey fail to investigate the principles of religion with the help of\nphilosophy and to search for the harmony between the two modes of\nknowledge. His book intends to remedy this situation by showing\nbeginning students of philosophy how to establish such harmony.\n\n\nIbn Daud thus reveals himself to be a staunch advocate of the study\nof philosophy and the use of reason to achieve the correct\ninterpretation of problematical biblical passages. In his view, the\nfact that man is endowed with reason obliges him to use his\nintellect. Throughout his treatise, he strives to demonstrate how\nreason and Scripture are not at variance with each other and that\n\u201ctrue philosophy\u201d is contained in Scripture.\n",
