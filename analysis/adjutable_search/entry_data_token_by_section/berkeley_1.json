Berkeley\u2019s critique of materialism in the Principles and Dialogues\n\n In his two great works of metaphysics, Berkeley defends idealism by\nattacking the materialist alternative. What exactly is the doctrine\nthat he\u2019s attacking? Readers should first note that\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d is here used to mean \u201cthe doctrine\nthat material things exist\u201d. This is in contrast with another\nuse, more standard in contemporary discussions, according to which\nmaterialism is the doctrine that only material things\nexist. Berkeley contends that no material things exist, not\njust that some immaterial things exist. Thus, he attacks Cartesian and\nLockean dualism, not just the considerably less popular (in\nBerkeley\u2019s time) view, held by Hobbes, that only material things\nexist. But what exactly is a material thing?  Interestingly, part\nof Berkeley\u2019s attack on matter is to argue that this question cannot\nbe satisfactorily answered by the materialists, that they cannot\ncharacterize their supposed material things.  However, an answer\nthat captures what exactly it is that Berkeley rejects is that\nmaterial things are mind-independent things or\nsubstances. And a mind-independent thing is something whose existence\nis not dependent on thinking/perceiving things, and thus would exist\nwhether or not any thinking things (minds) existed. Berkeley holds\nthat there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous\nphrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) \u2014 to be is to\nbe perceived (or to perceive).\n\n Berkeley charges that materialism promotes skepticism and atheism:\nskepticism because materialism implies that our senses mislead us as\nto the natures of these material things, which moreover need not exist\nat all, and atheism because a material world could be expected to run\nwithout the assistance of God. This double charge provides Berkeley\u2019s\nmotivation for questioning materialism (one which he thinks\nshould motivate others as well), though not, of course, a\nphilosophical argument against materialism. Fortunately, the\nPrinciples and Dialogues overflow with such\narguments. Below, we will examine some of the main elements of\nBerkeley\u2019s argumentative campaign against matter.\n",
