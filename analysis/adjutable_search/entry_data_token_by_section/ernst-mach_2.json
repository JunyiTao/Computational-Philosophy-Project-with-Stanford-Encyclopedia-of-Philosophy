    "main_text": "Psychology and the Life Sciences || Gustav Fechner\n3.1 Gustav Fechner\n\n\nMy natural bent for the study of these questions received its\nstrongest stimulus twenty-five years ago from Fechner\u2019s\nElemente der Psychophysik \u2026 [AS:\nxxxvi]\n\n\nThe single greatest influence upon Mach was Fechner; this cannot be\noverstated. Fechner\u2019s The Elements of\nPsychophysics was published in 1860, but Mach was aware of the\nideas in it before. The definitive account of Fechner is Michael\nHeidelberger\u2019s book Nature from Within [2004].\n\n\nFechner founded experimental psychology by developing a method of\n\u2018measuring\u2019 the psychical. Our senses have\nthresholds of perception; that is, given any amount of stimulation of a\nsense, there is an amount more of that stimulation which is required\nfor us to notice it. Furthermore, that amount increases\nlogarithmically as the base-line sensation increases. This holds\ntrue, with complications and variations, for all of our\nsensations. The import was that there is a mathematical\nrelationship between the external world and the inner, between the\nphysical and the psychological. It was then possible to talk\nabout these dual aspects of reality in a neutral manner (see Neutral\nMonism). Fechner uses the word \u2018elements\u2019 for this\npurpose, and Mach\u2019s elements are directly related to them. With\nsome loss, embed Fechnerian methodology within nineteenth century evolutionary theory,\nand apply it to the categories of physics, and we get Machian\nepistemology.\n",
