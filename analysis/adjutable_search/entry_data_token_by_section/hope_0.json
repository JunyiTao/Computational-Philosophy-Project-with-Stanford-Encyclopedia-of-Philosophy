    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nCompared with more widely discussed attitudes like belief and desire,\nthe phenomenon of hope presents some unique challenges for both\ntheories of the mind and theories of value. Hope is not only an\nattitude that has cognitive components\u2014it is responsive to facts\nabout the possibility and likelihood of future events. It also has a\nconative component\u2014hopes are different from mere expectations\ninsofar as they reflect and draw upon our desires. A classic analysis\nof hope\u2014the so-called \u201cstandard account\u201d (see\n section 3)\u2014takes\n hope to be a compound attitude, consisting of a desire for an outcome\nand a belief in that outcome\u2019s possibility. But not all outcomes\nthat we believe to be possible and that we desire are thereby objects\nof our hope. In order to hope one not only has to consider an outcome\npossible, one also has to affectively engage with this outcome in a\ndistinctive way. This raises the question as to whether hope can be\nreduced to beliefs and desires.\n\nPopular discourse often takes hope to be synonymous with optimism. But\nwhile optimism can be usefully analyzed as a desire for an outcome\ntogether with a belief that the outcome is more likely than not (or\nmore likely than the evidence leads other people to believe), many\nphilosophers hold that hope, properly understood, is independent of\nprobability assessments (see\n section 3).\n One can hope for outcomes that one considers to be very unlikely and\nthat one does not expect to happen, such as a miraculous cure of an\nillness. In such cases, optimism is not an appropriate response.\n\nIt is an open question whether the contribution of hope to human\nagency is to be identified with that of the underlying desires or\nwhether hope makes an independent contribution to motivation or\nreasoning. If one assumes that hope cannot make any independent\ncontribution to practical reasoning but still motivates, this raises\nthe suspicion that it distorts rational agency. While such an\nassessment can be found across the history of philosophy, many past\nand contemporary philosophers provide analyses of hope that add\nfurther elements to the belief-desire analysis and use these elements\nto explain why acting on one\u2019s hopes is (sometimes)\nrational.\n",
