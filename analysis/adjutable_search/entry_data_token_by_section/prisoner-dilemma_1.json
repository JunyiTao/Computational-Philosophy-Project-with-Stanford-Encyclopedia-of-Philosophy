    "main_text": "Asymmetry\n2. Asymmetry\n\nWithout assuming symmetry, the PD can be represented by using\nsubscripts \\(r\\) and \\(c\\) for the payoffs to Row and Column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(R_r,R_c\\)\n\\(S_r,T_c\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(T_r,S_c\\)\n\\(P_r,P_c\\)  \n\n\nIf we assume that the payoffs are ordered as before for each player,\ni.e., that \\(T_i \\gt R_i \\gt P_i \\gt S_i\\) when \\(i=r,c\\), then, as\nbefore, \\(\\bD\\) is the strictly dominant move for both players, but\nthe outcome \\((\\bD, \\bD)\\) of both players making this move is worse\nfor each than \\((\\bC, \\bC)\\). The force of the dilemma can now also be\nfelt under weaker conditions, however. Consider the following three\npairs of inequalities:\n\n\n(PD3)  a.\n\\(T_r \\gt R_r\\) and\n\\(P_r \\gt S_r\\) \n  b.\n\\(T_c \\gt R_c\\) and\n\\(P_c \\gt S_c\\) \n  c.\n\\(R_r \\gt P_r\\) and\n\\(R_c \\gt P_c\\) \n\n\nIf these conditions all obtain the argument for dilemma goes through\nas before. Defection strictly dominates cooperation for each player,\nand \\((\\bC,\\bC)\\) is strictly preferred by each to \\((\\bD,\\bD)\\). If\none of the two \\(\\gt\\) signs in each of the conditions\n\\(a\\)\u2013\\(c\\) is replaced by a weak inequality sign (\\(\\ge\\)) we\nhave a weak PD. \\(\\bD\\) weakly dominates \\(\\bC\\) for each player\n(i.e., \\(\\bD\\) is as good as \\(\\bC\\) in all cases and better in some)\nand \\((\\bC,\\bC)\\) weakly better than \\((\\bD,\\bD)\\) (i.e., it is at\nleast as good for both players and better for one). Since none of the\nclauses requires comparisons between \\(r\\)'s payoffs and \\(c\\)'s, we\nneed not assume that \\(\\gt\\) has any \u201cinterpersonal\u201d\nsignificance.\n\nNow suppose we drop the first inequality of either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) (but\nnot both). A game that meets the resulting conditions might be termed\na common knowledge PD. As long as each player knows that the\nother is rational and each knows the other's ordering of payoffs, we\nstill feel the force of the dilemma. For suppose a holds. Then \\(\\bD\\)\nis the dominant move for Row. Column, knowing that Row is rational,\nknows that Row will defect, and so, by the remaining inequality in\n\\(b\\), will defect himself. Similarly, if \\(b\\) holds Column will\ndefect, and Row, realizing this, will defect herself. By \\(c\\), the\nresulting \\((\\bD,\\bD)\\) is again worse for both than\n\\((\\bC,\\bC)\\).\n",
