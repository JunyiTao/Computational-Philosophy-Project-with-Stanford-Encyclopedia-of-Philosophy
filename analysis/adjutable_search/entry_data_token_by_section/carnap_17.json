    "main_text": "Logical Syntax of Language || Brief Exposition of Logical Syntax\n5.1 Brief Exposition of Logical Syntax\n\nThe stated aim of the book is to show that logic is syntactical, i.e.,\nthat it consists in formal theories of linguistic symbols\u2014a\ntheory is \u201cformal\u201d, Carnap says (LSS [1937: 1]) when\n\n\nno reference is made in it to either the meaning of the symbols (e.g.,\nthe words) or to the sense of the expressions (e.g., the sentences),\nbut simply and solely to the kinds and order of the symbols from which\nthe expressions are constructed.\n\n\nThe idea had of course been suggested by Hilbert\u2019s \u201cmethod\nof bifurcation [Methode der Zweiteilung]\u201d as Carnap had\ncalled it, distinguishing a meta-mathematics with concrete meaning, on\nthe one hand, from mathematics proper, on the other, which was to be\nregarded as purely formal, and the formal properties of which (e.g.,\nconsistency) Hilbert had aimed to study and prove in\nmeta-mathematics\u2014a method which Carnap sought to extend from\nmathematics to the whole of knowledge. The \u201cchief motivation for\nmy development of the syntactical method\u201d, Carnap later wrote,\nwas this:\n\n\nIn our discussions in the Vienna Circle it had turned out that any\nattempt at formulating more precisely the philosophical problems in\nwhich we were interested ended up with problems of the logical\nanalysis of language. Since in our view the issue in philosophical\nproblems concerned the language, not the world, these problems should\nbe formulated, not in the object language, but in the metalanguage.\nTherefore it seemed to me that the development of a suitable\nmetalanguage would essentially contribute toward greater clarity in\nthe formulation of philosophical problems and greater fruitfulness in\ntheir discussions. (Carnap 1963a: 55)\n\n\nThat the main concepts of deductive logic (\u201ce.g., provability,\nderivability from given premises, logical independence, etc\u201d.)\nare purely syntactical was argued primarily by showing how they could\nbe defined in two exemplary languages without reference to the\nmeanings of any terms. Language I is a form of primitive recursive\narithmetic, and was intended to exemplify a constructivist kind of\nlanguage, while Language II contains classical mathematics. (In modern\nterminology, both of these \u201clanguages\u201d are really\ntheories.) Of the book\u2019s five parts, the first three are taken\nup with the development of these two languages. In part IV, Carnap\ngoes beyond the treatment of specific languages to sketch a template\nfor \u201cgeneral syntax\u201d; he tries to give a framework for the\nsyntactical development or description of any language whatever. He\nabstracts from the syntactical categories of the particular language\nunder consideration, and does not even assume he is given its set of\nvariables, the distinction between its logical and descriptive\nvocabulary, its negation symbol, or any other syntactic property.\nInstead, all these sets and concepts are to be defined solely from the\ntransformation (inference) rules of the language (see\n\u00a746\u201347); Carnap is developing here what we would now call a\nversion of \u201cproof-theoretic semantics\u201d or \u201clogical\ninferentialism\u201d (see the supplement\n Logical Syntax of Language\n for further details). Throughout all parts of the Logical\nSyntax, Carnap distinguishes between the \u201cd-terms\u201d\nspecifiable this way (derivable, proof, demonstrable, refutable,\ndecidable) from the \u201cc-terms\u201d (consequence, valid,\ncontravalid, determinate, incompatible, content, synonymous). Though\nboth are considered to be \u201csyntactic\u201d terms by Carnap, the\nc-terms seem closer to what we would now call \u201csemantic\u201d.\nThis raises the question, for the modern reader, what Carnap actually\nmeans by \u201csyntactic\u201d (or \u201cformal\u201d) here; and\nit turns out (as Carnap himself later recognized) that\n\u201csyntax\u201d includes much of what he would later call\n\u201csemantics\u201d. Indeed we find (Wagner 2009: 22) that\nlanguages I and II are not actually \u201cformal\u201d in our sense\nat all; they are interpreted languages. While the syntactic method, as\nCarnap here conceives of it, requires that the interpretations be\ndisregarded, a particular fixed interpretation implicitly remains in\nplace. Carnap often refers to the import of some syntactic result or\nattribute \u201cin material interpretation [bei inhaltlicher\nDeutung]\u201d (e.g., LSS: 30), and the material interpretation\nsometimes slips in to play a role in the argument. Accordingly, Tarski\n(1936 [2002]: \u00a72) characterizes Carnap\u2019s definition of\nconsequence for Language II in the Logical Syntax as\nsemantic, acknowledges that \u201cThe first attempt at the\nformulation of a precise definition for the proper concept of\nfollowing comes from R. Carnap\u201d (in the Logical\nSyntax), and regards his own model-theoretic definition of\nlogical consequence as essentially equivalent to Carnap\u2019s\n(though applicable to a broader range of formalized languages than\njust to Language-II-like languages; see the supplement\n Logical Syntax of Language).\n This character of the Logical Syntax as a transitional work\nbetween syntax and semantics raises many subtle interpretative and\nhistorical issues that require distillation of the actual argument\nfrom the (often newly-invented) terminology in which it is embedded.\nFortunately, Pierre Wagner\u2019s (2009) excellent handbook on the\nLogical Syntax provides the reader with a guide.\n\nFor all the technical apparatus, Carnap later acknowledged that\n\u201cthe investigation of philosophical problems was originally the\nmain reason for the development of syntax\u201d (Carnap 1963a: 55),\nand the final Part V of the book is devoted to these. The focus,\nhowever, is on the \u201csyntax\u201d idea itself, not on the other\nmain idea, the principle of tolerance. There is a simple reason for\nthis: Part V was almost entirely written before Carnap arrived at the\nprinciple of tolerance in late 1932, and when the book went to the\npublisher it had to be cut (the definition of\n\u201canalyticity\u201d for Language II (\u00a7 34d), for instance,\nwas not even included in the original book, only in the 1937 English\ntranslation). And Part V is devoted to a sustained argument for\nsticking to the \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d and avoiding the\n\u201cmaterial mode of speech\u201d unless it is translatable into\nthe formal mode. So it is hardly surprising that philosophers (see for\ninstance Wole\u0144ski 2003) took this to be the book\u2019s main\nphilosophical point and thought Carnap had left it behind after the\nembrace of semantics in 1935.\n",
