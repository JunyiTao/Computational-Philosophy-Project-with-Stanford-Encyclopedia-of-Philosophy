    "main_text": "QBism || Probability\n1.2 Probability\n\nApplied to radioactive decay, the Born Rule of quantum theory is taken\nsuccessfully to predict such things as the half-life of the first\nexcited state of the hydrogen atom\u2014that the probability that an\natom of hydrogen in this state will be found to have decayed to the\nground state after \\(1.1 \\times 10^{-9}\\) seconds (i.e., just over a\nbillionth of a second) is \u00bd. This prediction has been\nexperimentally confirmed by measuring how the frequency with which\nphotons are emitted by a large number of hydrogen atoms in the decay\nof this excited state decreases over time. Most physicists regard this\nand other probabilities predicted by quantum theory as objective\nphysical features of the world, typically identifying the probability\nof decay with the relative frequency of decay as measured in such an\nexperiment.\n\nBut there are strong reasons not to equate probability with any actual\nrelative frequency (see entry\n interpretations of probability,\n \u00a73.4). Many philosophers, including Karl Popper (1967) and David\nLewis (1986), have taken Born probabilities instead to exemplify a\ndistinctive kind of objective property (propensity or chance,\nrespectively) that may be ascribed to actual or possible individual\nevents. Lewis took quantum indeterminism to be the last hold-out of\nobjective chance.\n\nBy contrast, QBists adopt a subjectivist or personalist interpretation\nof probability, in quantum theory as elsewhere (see entry on\n interpretations of probability,\n \u00a73.3). This makes the Born Rule of quantum theory not a law of\nnature but an empirically motivated norm of rationality a wise agent\nshould follow in addition to those whose violation would render the\nagent\u2019s degrees of belief incoherent. As usually formulated, the\nBorn Rule specifies probabilities for various possible measurement\noutcomes given a quantum state: But QBists also adopt a subjectivist\nor personalist interpretation of quantum states.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation specifying the time development of a\nsystem\u2019s quantum state \\(\\psi\\) \n\\[\\tag{1}\\label{ex1} H\\psi = i\\hslash \\,{\\partial \\psi /\\partial t} \\]\n\n\nis often thought of as the basic dynamical law of quantum mechanics,\nwhere \\(H\\) (called the Hamiltonian operator) is said to represent the\nsystem\u2019s energy. Instead QBists take this equation as providing\na synchronic constraint on an agent\u2019s credences concerning the\nagent\u2018s experiences at different times, and not a diachronic\nconstraint on the system\u2019s properties at those times. QBists\nalso consider the Hamiltonian (along with all other observables)\nwithin the purview of each individual agent rather than objectively\ndetermined by the system\u2019s properties. It follows that equally\nrational agents who assign the same quantum state to a system at a\ntime \\(t_1\\) may consistently assign it different states at a time\n\\(t_2\\) because they apply the constraint supplied by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation in different ways.\n\nIn its usual formulation the Born Rule does not look like a normative\nconstraint on credences. QBists prefer to reformulate it purely as a\nrelation among (subjective) probabilities without reference to a\nquantum state. In the form of Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) it relates\nprobabilities \\(q\\) of actual measurement outcomes \\(j\\) to\nprobabilities of outcomes of a hypothetical fiducial\nmeasurement of a special kind called a\n SIC.[2]\n \n\\[\\tag{2}\\label{ex2} q(j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d^2} [(d+1) p(i) -1/d].r(j\\mathbin{|}i) \\]\n\n\nThis equation is not just a revision of the law of total probability\nit resembles, i.e., \n\\[\\tag{3}\\label{ex3} q(j) =\\sum_{i=1}^{d^2} p (i).r(j \\mathbin{|} i) \\]\n\n\nbecause \\(p(i)\\), \\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) in \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) refer to a\nhypothetical measurement, not the actual measurement.\n\nIn more detail, suppose an agent has degrees of belief \\(p(i)\\) that\nthe outcome of a SIC on a system would be the \\(i\\)th, and\ndegree of belief \\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) in the \\(j\\)th\noutcome of an actual measurement \\(M\\) conditional on the\n\\(i\\)th outcome for the hypothetical SIC on that system.\nThen QBists take Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), stating a condition on the\nagent\u2019s degree of belief \\(q(j)\\) that the outcome of \\(M\\) will\nbe the \\(j\\)th, as their preferred formulation of the Born\nRule. In this expression \\(d\\) stands for the dimension of the\nsystem\u2019s Hilbert space (assumed to be a positive integer).\n\nTheir idea is that when the fiducial measurement is a SIC,\n\\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\)) encodes the agent\u2019s belief about the type\nof measurement \\(M\\), while \\(p(i)\\) encodes his or her quantum state\nfor the system on which this measurement is performed. They maintain\nthat the Born Rule in this form is an empirically motivated addition\nto probability theory\u2014a normative requirement of quantum\nBayesian coherence (Fuchs and Schack 2013; DeBrota, Fuchs, Pienaar,\nand Stacey, 2021) that supplements the usual coherence conditions on\ndegrees of belief required to avoid a Dutch book (a set of bets an\nagent is guaranteed to lose, come what may).\n\nIt is common (at least in physical applications) to identify\nprobability 1 with objective certainty, at least for finite\nprobability spaces. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (1935, EPR) made\nthis identification in the following sufficient condition for reality\nwith which they premised their famous argument for the incompleteness\nof quantum mechanical description of physical reality:\n\n\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with\ncertainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a\nphysical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality\ncorresponding to this physical quantity. (EPR: 777)\n\n\nQBists (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack 2007) reject this identification and\nrefute EPR\u2019s argument that quantum description is incomplete by\ndenying this premise. Eschewing all objective physical probabilities,\nthey rather identify probability 1 with an agent\u2019s subjective\ncertainty\u2014full belief in a statement or event that an equally\nwell informed rational agent may believe to a lesser degree, or not at\nall.\n",
