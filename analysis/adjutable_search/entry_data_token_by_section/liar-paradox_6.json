    "main_text": "Basic Ingredients || Truth predicate\n2.1 Truth predicate\n\nThe first ingredient in building a Liar is a truth predicate, which we\nwrite here as \\(\\Tr\\). We follow the usual custom in logic of treating\nthis as a predicate of sentences. However, especially as we come to\nconsider some ways of resolving the Liar, it should be remembered that\nthis treatment can be seen as more for convenience in exposition than\na serious commitment to what truth bearers are.\n\nWe assume that we have, along with the truth predicate, appropriate\nnames of sentences. For a given sentence \\(A\\), suppose that\n\\(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner\\) is a name for it. A predication of\ntruth to \\(A\\) then looks like \\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner\nA\\right\\urcorner)\\).\n\nWe shall say that a predicate \\(\\Tr(x)\\) is a truth predicate for\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) only if \\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner\nA\\right\\urcorner)\\) is well-formed for every sentence \\(A\\) of\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\). We typically expect \\(\\Tr\\) to obey some principles\ngoverning its behavior on sentences of a given language. It is to\nthose we now\n turn.[3]\n",
