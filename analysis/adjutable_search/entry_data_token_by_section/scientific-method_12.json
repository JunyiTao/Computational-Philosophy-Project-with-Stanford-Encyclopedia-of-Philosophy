    "main_text": "Discourse on scientific method || Deviating practices\n6.4 Deviating practices\n\nThe difficulties around identifying the methods of science are also\nreflected in the difficulties of identifying scientific misconduct in\nthe form of improper application of the method or methods of science.\nOne of the first and most influential attempts at defining misconduct\nin science was the US definition from 1989 that defined misconduct\nas\n\n\nfabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that\nseriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the\nscientific community. (Code of Federal Regulations, part 50,\nsubpart A., August 8, 1989, italics added)\n\n\nHowever, the \u201cother practices that seriously deviate\u201d\nclause was heavily criticized because it could be used to suppress\ncreative or novel science. For example, the National Academy of\nScience stated in their report Responsible Science (1992)\nthat it\n\n\nwishes to discourage the possibility that a misconduct complaint could\nbe lodged against scientists based solely on their use of novel or\nunorthodox research methods. (NAS: 27)\n\n\nThis clause was therefore later removed from the definition. For an\nentry into the key philosophical literature on conduct in science, see\nShamoo & Resnick (2009).\n",
