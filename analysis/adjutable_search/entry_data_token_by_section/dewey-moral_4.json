    "main_text": "Metaethics of Value Judgments\n2. Metaethics of Value Judgments\n\nDewey held that value judgments guide conduct by way of propositions\nsubject to empirical testing. Value judgments can be both\naction-guiding and empirically warranted because they have an\ninstrumental form. They say that if something were done, then certain\nconsequences would follow, which would be valued. The point of\nasserting such propositions is to intelligently guide the design and\nselection of a course of action that will solve a problem, where the\nassertion is part of the means by which the action is brought about\n(LJP 16\u201317). Value judgments figure in Dewey\u2019s psychology\nin relation to the distinction between valuing and evaluation, and\nDewey\u2019s notions of desire, taste, and interest.\n",
