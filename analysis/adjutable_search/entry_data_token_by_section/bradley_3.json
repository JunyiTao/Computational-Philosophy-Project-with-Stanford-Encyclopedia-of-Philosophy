    "main_text": "Ethics\n4. Ethics\n\nBradley\u2019s views on ethics were expressed at length in his first\nwidely acknowledged publication, Ethical Studies (1876). One\nreason it was noticed is that the book is highly polemical. (Sidgwick\ncalled it \u2018vehemently propagandist\u2019 in his Mind\nreview.) He did not change these views significantly in later years:\nin 1893 he described it as \u2018a book which, in the main, still\nexpresses my opinions\u2019 (Appearance and Reality, p.\n356n) and at the time of his death was working on a second edition\nwhich, characteristically, was to retain the original text intact but\nincorporate additional matter.\n\nBradley says in his Preface that his object is \u2018mainly\ncritical\u2019 and that the ethical theory of his time rests on\n\u2018preconceptions metaphysical and psychological\u2019, which are\n\u2018confused or even false\u2019. In this the most Hegelian of his\nbooks, his approach is, in a series of connected essays, to work\ndialectically through these erroneous theories towards a proper\nunderstanding of ethics. Accordingly he tells us that the essays\n\u2018must be read in the order in which they stand\u2019, and a\ncorollary of this is that the common practice of extracting one or two\nof them (usually the brilliantly written \u2018Pleasure for\nPleasure\u2019s Sake\u2019 and \u2018My Station and Its\nDuties\u2019) from the whole, on the basis of their individual\nmerits, can result in a misleading impression of their significance\nwithin Bradley\u2019s moral thinking: neither represents some\nfinished position.\n\nThe development of this proper understanding begins by examining the\n\u2018vulgar\u2019 notion of moral responsibility and the apparent\nthreats to it posed by the philosophical doctrines of determinism and\nindeterminism, threats which he argues evaporate once we examine the\nreality of human action. (A prominent theme in the book is that\neveryday moral thought is not to be overturned by moral philosophy.)\nIt proceeds by turning to the question \u2018Why should I be\nmoral?\u2019, which he answers by suggesting that the moral end for\neach of us is self-realization. What this is, is then gradually\nunfolded through examination of representative philosophical theories\neach of which is rejected as unsatisfactory because of its one-sided\nconcentration upon particular features of the moral life.\nNevertheless, he thinks, each theory captures something important\nwhich must not be forgotten in the proper understanding he aims at.\nFor example, in the third essay, \u2018Pleasure for Pleasure\u2019s\nSake\u2019, a still-classic critique of hedonistic utilitarianism,\nBradley argues that its individualism is insupportable, as is its\nhedonistic conception of happiness as a pleasurable state identifiable\nindependently of the means by which it is attained (so that it could\nin principle be achieved more conveniently than through moral\nbehaviour). But purged of these errors, the essential utilitarian\ninsight of the importance of happiness as the point of morality can be\nretained. Likewise, in the next essay\u2019s examination of a Kantian\n(if not quite Kant\u2019s) ethics of duty, he argues that from this\nconception of morality we should abandon, as the result of a false\nabstraction, its idea that duty should be done just for duty\u2019s\nsake. We can, however, retain the insight that morality requires the\nperformance of individual duties, provided we are clear that\ntheir obligatoriness arises from the nature of each duty rather than\nfrom some formal principle.\n\nThese theories are inadequate because they have a deficient conception\nof the self, a deficiency he begins to remedy in the fifth essay, the\nfamous \u2018My Station and Its Duties\u2019, where he outlines a\nsocial conception of the self and of morality with such vigour that it\nis understandable that the mistaken idea that it expresses his own\nposition has gained some currency. This Hegelian account of the moral\nlife, in which the self is fully realized by fulfilling its role in\nthe social organism which grounds its duties, is clearly one which\ngreatly attracted Bradley, and he seems never to have noticed the\nimplicit tension between the metaphysical account of the self as\nnecessarily social and the moral injunction to realize the self in\nsociety. But he finally acknowledges its inadequacy, pointing out, for\ninstance, that any actual society may exhibit moral imperfections\nrequiring reform from the standpoint of an ideal which cannot be\nexemplified in the roles available within that society. This leads him\nnaturally into the next essay\u2019s consideration of ideal morality,\nwhere he discusses the scope of morality\u2019s demands on the\nindividual, and, by a further natural extension, into the seventh\nessay\u2019s discussion of the distinction between the good and the\nbad self, a discussion which involves an attempted demonstration that\nthe bad self is a kind of unrealizable parasite on the good. This is\nnecessary to his enterprise: without it, he could not hope to make\nplausible his suggestion that the aim of morality is self-realization.\nBut in one way the enterprise still founders: the final essay argues\nthat morality is ultimately self-contradictory, depending for its\nexistence on the evil it seeks to overcome. Realization of the ideal\nself is thus unattainable through morality, but the book closes by\nsuggesting that it is still possible in religion.\n\nSome of Bradley\u2019s metaphysical ideas are displayed in his\ndefence of his moral philosophy. An example is his claim that the self\nis a concrete universal and that the ethical doctrines he criticizes\nare damaged by their reliance upon abstract notions of the self. The\nself is universal in that it retains its identity over time\nand through many different actions, thus collecting together the\nseries of abstract particulars which make up its history in a way\nanalogous to that in which the abstract universal red\ncollects together its scattered individual instances (now often called\n\u2018tropes\u2019); it is concrete in that, unlike\nred it is a real non-abstract individual. For such claims to\nbe fully convincing, a developed system in which the underlying\nmetaphysical ideas are fully worked out is needed, as he himself\nadmitted. But in this later working out, most of it in Appearance\nand Reality, the expression \u2018concrete universal\u2019\nalmost disappears from Bradley\u2019s vocabulary, mainly because he\neventually concludes that there can be only one such thing;\nnevertheless, the idea involved remains, reappearing in the form of\nthe recurring theme that abstraction is falsification, and in this\nform is central to his logic and his metaphysics.\n",
