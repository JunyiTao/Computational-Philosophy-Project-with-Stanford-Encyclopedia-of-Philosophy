Generalized Correspondence Principle\n\nFinally, it is important to distinguish between Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle and what some philosophers of science have\nreferred to as the \u201cgeneralized correspondence principle\u201d\n(alternately the \u201cgeneral correspondence principle\u201d).\n\nIn his classic essay \u201cCorrespondence, Invariance and Heuristics:\nIn Praise of Conservative Induction\u201d Heinz Post defines this\nprinciple as follows:\n\nThe most important heuristic restriction is the General\nCorrespondence Principle. Roughly speaking, this is the\nrequirement that any acceptable new theory \\(L\\) should account\nfor the success of its predecessor \\(S\\) by\n\u2018degenerating\u2019 into that theory under those conditions\nunder which \\(S\\) has been well confirmed by tests. (Post 1971,\np. 228)\n\n\nThe generalized correspondence principle here is seen both as a\nconstraint on the development of new theories and as an account of how\nsuccessor theories are related to their predecessors. Typically in\nphysics, Post\u2019s notion of \u2018degenerating\u2019 is cashed\nout as the limit of some parameter whereby the equations of a\nsuccessor theory are recovered as the limit of the equations of\npredecessor theory. Regarding the specific case of the\nquantum-classical relation, Post argues that the general\ncorrespondence principle fails:\n\nParadoxically, the only counterexample we have been able to find to\nthe General Correspondence Principle is the paradigm example of the\nrelation of quantum mechanics to classical mechanics. Contrary to the\nimpression that may be given in some textbooks, it is not possible to\nreduce quantum to classical mechanics\u2026 This failure to\nestablish a general correspondence between quantum mechanics and\nclassical physics (in the limit where\n\\(\\Delta P\\Delta Q \\gg h\\) should in our\nview be regarded as a shortcoming of quantum mechanics \u2026 in its\nclaim to the status of \\(L\\)-theory, rather than as a breakdown\nof the General Correspondence Principle. (Post 1971, pp.\n233\u2013234)[13]\n\n\nAlthough Post\u2019s generalized correspondence principle bears some\nsimilarity to the physicist\u2019s conception of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle, it is quite different from Bohr\u2019s own\nunderstanding. Indeed, according to Post, the generalized\ncorrespondence principle does not even hold for the specific theory\npair that was Bohr\u2019s subject.\n\nIn contrast to Post, Radder (1991) has claimed that the generalized\ncorrespondence principle does apply to the case of the\nquantum-classical relation (p. 215), and that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle, which he interprets largely as a heuristic\ntool, can be seen as an instance of the generalized correspondence\nprinciple (p. 208).\n",
