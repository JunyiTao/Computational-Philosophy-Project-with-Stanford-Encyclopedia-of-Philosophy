    "main_text": "The Stable Marriage Problem || The Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n3.1 The Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n\nThe computer scientists Gale and Shapley proved that stable matchings\nalways exist, and gave an algorithm for finding such matchings, the\nso-called Gale-Shapley algorithm (Gale &\nShapley 1962):\n\n\nInitially, all men and all women are free (unengaged).\n\nNext, in a number of rounds, each free man proposes to the\nmost-preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed and ticks her off\nfrom his list. If the woman is free, she accepts, and they become\nengaged. If the woman is not free, she compares the proponent to her\ncurrent fianc\u00e9. If she likes him better, she dumps the\nfianc\u00e9 who becomes free again, and the proponent and his woman\nof choice become engaged.\n\nThis goes on until all men and women are engaged.\n\n\nAs an example, suppose that there are three men \\(a, b, c\\) and three\nwomen \\(d, e, f\\), and the lists of preferences are as follows (with\nthe most preferred one first in the list): \\(a: edf\\), \\(b: {\\it\nfed}\\), \\(c: {\\it dfe}\\), \\(d: {\\it abc}\\), \\(e: {\\it cda}\\), \\(g:\n{\\it acb}\\). So \\(a: {\\it edf}\\) means that \\(a\\) prefers \\(e\\) to\n\\(d\\) and \\(d\\) to \\(f\\). It is assumed that preferences are\ntransitive, so \\(a\\) also prefers \\(e\\) to \\(f\\).\n\nAn example of a stable match for this situation is represented as\nthree pairs \\((a,e)\\), \\((b,f)\\), \\((c,d)\\). Note that woman \\(d\\)\nends up with the man that is at the bottom of her list. But this match\nis still stable, for although \\(c\\) is willing to swap her husband for\nany of the other two men, these two candidates will not agree, for\nthey both happen to be married to the woman who is on the top of their\nown list.\n\nTo check that the Gale-Shapley algorithm always produces stable\nmatchings, we can proceed as follows. Obviously, the situation where\nno-one is engaged is stable.\n\nWhat does it mean for \\(E\\), an \u201cengagement\u201d mapping, to\nbe stable on the set of women \\(W\\) and the set of men \\(M\\)? Let us\nuse \\(m >_w m'\\) for \u201c\\(w\\) prefers \\(m\\) over \\(m'\\)\u201d\n(so bigger is better).\n\n(1)\nFor all \\((m,w) \\in\nE\\): if there is \\(w'\\) with \\(w' >_m w\\) then there is no \\(m'\\)\nwith \\((m',w') \\in E\\) and \\(m >_{w'} m'\\);\n(2)\nFor all \\((m,w) \\in\nE\\): if there is \\(m'\\) with \\(m' >_w m\\) then there is no \\(w'\\)\nwith \\((m',w') \\in E\\) and \\(w >_{m'} w'\\). \n\n\nWhat does it mean for a man to be free?\n\n(3)\nThe set of free men should equal the set of all men minus the men\nthat are engaged.\n\n\nNext, inspect what happens in a single step in the algorithm. The\nprecondition for the step is that there is at least one free man \\(m\\)\nleft. Such a free man \\(m\\) proposes to the highest woman \\(w\\) on his\nlist to whom he has not yet proposed.\n\nThere are two cases. If \\(w\\) is free, \\(w\\) accepts the proposal, and\nthey become engaged. Is the new set of engaged pairs stable? We only\nhave to check for the new pair \\((w,m)\\).\n\n\n\nSuppose that there is a free \\(w'\\) with \\(w' >_m w\\). This cannot\nbe, for \\(w\\) is at the top of \\(m\\)'s list.\n\n\nSuppose there is \\(m'\\) with \\(m' >_w m\\). Then if \\(m'\\) is\nengaged, let us say to \\(w'\\), this must mean that not \\(w >_{m'}\nw'\\). For otherwise \\(m'\\) would have proposed to \\(w\\) instead of to\n\\(w'\\).\n\n\nThe new list of free men equals the old list, minus \\(m\\). This is\ncorrect, for \\(m\\) just got engaged.\n\n\nNow the other case: suppose that \\(w\\) is already engaged. There are\ntwo subcases. In case \\(w\\) prefers her own current fianc\u00e9,\nnothing happens. The resulting list of engaged pairs is still stable.\nThe list of free men remains the same, for \\(m\\) proposed and got\nrejected.\n\nIn case \\(w\\) prefers \\(m\\) to her own fianc\u00e9 \\(m'\\), she\nswaps: \\((m,w)\\) replaces \\((m',w)\\) in the set of engaged pairs.\nAgain, it is easy to see that the resulting list of engaged pairs is\nstable. Man \\(m\\) gets replaced by \\(m'\\) in the set of free men. This\nis also correct.\n\nNote that the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm is hugely favourable to\nthe party that is doing the proposing. The proposing party gets a\nchance to make proposals to any candidate, in order of preference. But\nat the start of the procedure the receiving party has to say\n\u201cyes\u201d to any proposal! The result of swapping the roles of\nthe men and the women in the algorithm will also compute a stable\nmatch, but one that is more advantageous to the women. \n\nThe Gale-Shapley procedure runs in time quadratic in the number of men\nand women (see, e.g., Cechl\u00e9rov\u00e1 et al. 2005). Pini et\nal. (2011) show how participants can easily manipulate the outcome of\nthe procedure by misrepresenting their true preferences. Fortunately,\nPini et al. also present an alternative procedure for which\nmanipulation is hard, in that coming up with an individually\nprofitable misrepresentation of one\u2019s preferences is a\ncomputationally complex task.\n\nThe Gale-Shapley algorithm has many important applications, also\noutside of the area of marriage brokering; Gale and Shapley themselves\ndiscuss college admission procedures (1962).\nThe next subsection presents another\napplication.\n",
