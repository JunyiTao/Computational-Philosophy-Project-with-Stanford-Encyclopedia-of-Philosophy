    "main_text": "Why Justification Logic?\n1. Why Justification Logic?\n\n\nJustification logics are epistemic logics which allow knowledge and \nbelief modalities to be \u2018unfolded\u2019 into justification\nterms: instead of \\(\\Box X\\) one writes \n\\(t : X\\), and reads it as \u201c\\(X\\) is justified\nby reason \\(t\\)\u201d. One may think of traditional modal \noperators as implicit modalities, and justification terms as\ntheir explicit elaborations which supplement modal logics \nwith finer-grained epistemic machinery. The family of justification \nterms has structure and operations. Choice of operations gives rise \nto different justification logics. For all common epistemic logics \ntheir modalities can be completely unfolded into explicit \njustification form. In this respect Justification Logic reveals and \nuses the explicit, but hidden, content of traditional Epistemic Modal\nLogic.\n\n\nJustification logic originated as part of a successful project to \nprovide a constructive semantics for intuitionistic \nlogic\u2014justification terms abstracted away all but the most \nbasic features of mathematical proofs. Proofs are justifications in \nperhaps their purest form. Subsequently justification logics were \nintroduced into formal epistemology.\nThis article presents the general range of justification logics as \ncurrently understood. It discusses their relationships with \nconventional modal logics. In addition to technical machinery, the \narticle examines in what way the use of explicit justification terms \nsheds light on a number of traditional philosophical problems. The \nsubject as a whole is still under active development.\n\n\nThe roots of justification logic can be traced back to many different\nsources, two of which are discussed in detail: epistemology and \nmathematical logic.\n",
