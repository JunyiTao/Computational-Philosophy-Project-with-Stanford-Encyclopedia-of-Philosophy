Intuition\nplays a major role in al-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t, which is considered to be\none of Suhrawardi\u2019s more peripatetic writings. It is not surprising,\nthen, that Ibn Kammuna frequently mentions intuition in his commentary\nto al-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t. It should be borne in mind, though, that true\nto his role as commentator, Ibn Kammuna will as a rule try to flesh out\nand expand upon Suhrawardi\u2019s intentions, rather than expressly\ndeveloping his own ideas.\n\n\nWe shall limit ourselves here to a few examples drawn from the partial\nedition of this commentary published by H. Ziai and A. Alwishah, which\ncovers part two of al-Talw\u012bh\u0101t and whose subject is natural\nscience or physics. Ibn Kammuna describes in one place quotes\napprovingly Suhrawardi\u2019s account of how greatly people differ in this\nrespect: \u201cPeople differ with regard to\nh\u0323ads. There are the doltish, who have never had any success\nin thinking; and there are those with powerful h\u0323ads. Many of\nthe latter exceed others in quantity and quality; but there is no\nlimit, at which one must perforce stop. It is possible for there to be\nsomeone who perceives by means of h\u0323ads most of the\nintelligibles in a short time and without a teacher; and there is a\n[type of] soul called \u2018holy\u2019 whose capacity is as powerful\nas that of the prophets\u201d (Ziai & Alwishah 2003, 456).\n\n\nOther passages afford us an opportunity to sample how h\u0323ads\nis employed in various scientific, or, as we would judge today, occult\ncontexts. In laying forth an account of some twelve phenomena,\nincluding various optical effects in the atmosphere, thunder,\nlightning, and comets, all of which are produced by \u201cvapors\u201d\noriginating in the earth (much as Aristotle had argued in his\nMeteorology), Ibn Kammuna adds that, conjoined to those\ncauses, h\u0323ads judges that there must be \u201cspiritual\nforces\u201d that are due to celestial configurations (Ziai &\nAlwishah 2003, 254). Animals other than man have a rational soul; this\nties in to the question of metemsomatosis. The reasoning will be\nevident to someone who employs\nh\u0323ads, but not to someone who either willfully shuts off\nh\u0323ads, or was simply not born with that gift (Ziai &\nAlwishah 2003, 346\u20137).\n",
