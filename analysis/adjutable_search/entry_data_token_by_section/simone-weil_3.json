    "main_text": "Ethics\n4. Ethics\n\nWeil\u2019s central ethical concept is \u201cattention\u201d\n(l\u2019attention), which, though thematically and\npractically present in her early writings, reached its robust\ntheoretical expression while she was in Marseilles in 1942. Attention\nis a particular kind of ethical \u201cturn\u201d in her\nconceptualization. Fundamentally, it is less a moral position or\nspecific practice and more an orientation that nevertheless requires\nan arduous apprenticeship leading to a capacity of discernment on\nmultiple levels. Attention includes discerning what someone is going\nthrough in her or his suffering, the particular protest made by\nsomeone harmed, the social conditions that engender a climate for\nsuffering, and the fact that one is, by chance (hazard) at a\ndifferent moment, equally a subject of affliction.\n\nAttention is directed not by will but by a particular kind of desire\nwithout an object. It is not a \u201cmuscular effort\u201d but a\n\u201cnegative effort\u201d (WFG 61), involving release of egoistic\nprojects and desires and a growing receptivity of the mind. For Weil,\nas a Christian Platonist, the desire motivating attention is oriented\ntoward the mysterious good that \u201cdraws God down\u201d (WFG 61).\nIn her essay \u201cReflections on the Right use of School Studies\nwith a View to the Love of God\u201d (1942 in WFG 57\u201365), Weil\ntakes prayer, defined as \u201cthe orientation of all the attention\nof which the soul is capable toward God\u201d, as her point of\ndeparture (WFG 57). She then describes a kind of vigilance in her\ndefinition of attention:\n\n\nAttention consists of suspending our thought, leaving it detached\n[disponible], empty [vide], and ready to be\npenetrated by the object; it means holding in our minds, within the\nreach of this thought, but on the lower level and not in contact with\nit, the diverse knowledge we have acquired which we are forced to make\nuse of. \u2026 Above all our thought should be empty\n[vide], waiting [en attente], not seeking anything\n[ne rien chercher], but ready to receive in its naked truth\nthe object that is to penetrate it. (WFG 62)\n\n\nThe French makes more clear the connection between attention\n(l\u2019attention) and waiting (attente). For Weil\nthe problem with searching, instead of waiting en hupomene\n(\u03b4\u1f30 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2),\nis precisely that one is eager to fill the void characterizing\nattente. As a result, one settles too quickly on some-thing:\na counterfeit, falsity, idol. Because in searching or willing the\nimagination fills the void (le vide), it is crucial that\nattention be characterized by suspension and detachment. Indeed, the\nvoid by definition is empty (vide)\u2014of idols, futural\nself-projections, consolations that compensate un-thinking, and\nattachments of collective and personal prestige. As such, its\nacceptance marks individual fragility and destructibility, that is,\nmortality. But this acceptance of death is the condition for the\npossibility of the reception of grace. (As explained below in regard\nto her religious philosophy, Weil\u2019s concept for the disposition\ncharacterized by these features of attention, with obvious theological\nresonances, is \u201cdecreation\u201d.)\n\nIn attention one renounces one\u2019s ego in order to receive the\nworld without the interference of one\u2019s limited and consumptive\nperspective. This posture of self-emptying, a stripping away of the\n\u201cI\u201d (d\u00e9pouillement)\u2014ultimately for\nWeil an imitatio Christi in its kenosis\u2014allows for an\nimpersonal but intersubjective ethics. Indeed, if the primary\norientation of attention is toward a mysterious and unknown God (often\nexperienced as a desire for the Good), the secondary disposition is\ntoward another person or persons, especially toward those going\nthrough affliction.\n\n\nThe soul empties itself [se vide] of all its own contents in\norder to receive into itself the being it is looking at, just as he\nis, in all his truth. Only he who is capable of attention can do this.\n(WFG 65)\n\n\nWeil recognizes and problematizes the fact that the autonomous self\nnaturally imposes itself in its projects, as opposed to disposing\nitself to the other; for this reason, attention is rare but is\nrequired of any ethical disposition. The exemplary story of attention\nfor Weil is the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which, on her\nreading, compassion is exchanged when one individual \u201cturns his\nattention toward\u201d another individual, anonymous and afflicted\n(WFG 90).\n\n\nThe actions that follow are just the automatic effect of this moment\nof attention. The attention is creative. But at the moment when it is\nengaged it is a renunciation. This is true, at least, if it is pure.\nThe man accepts to be diminished by concentrating on an expenditure of\nenergy, which will not extend his own power but will only give\nexistence to a being other than himself, who will exist independently\nof him. (1942 \u201cForms of the Implicit Love of God\u201d in WFG\n83\u2013142, 90)\n\n\nAs such, attention not only gives human recognition and therefore\nmeaningful existence to another, but it also allows the individual\nengaged in renunciation to take up a moral stance in response to her\nor his desire for good.\n\nIt is important to distinguish Weil\u2019s ethics of attention from\ncanonical conceptualizations of ethics. Attention is not motivated by\na duty (although Weil thinks we are obligated to respond to\nothers\u2019 needs, whether of soul or body [see \u201cDraft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations\u201d in SWA, esp. 224\u2013225]) or\nassessed by its consequences. In addition, through its sense of\nphronesis (practical wisdom), which Weil assumed from\nAristotle through Marx, attention is arguably closer to virtue ethics\nthan it is to deontology or consequentialism. However, it is separated\nfrom the tradition of virtue ethics in important ways: it often\nemerges more spontaneously than virtue, which, for Aristotle, is\ncultivated through habituation as it develops into a hexis;\nWeil\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cnegative effort\u201d suggests an\nactive-passive orientation that militates against Aristotle\u2019s\nemphasis on activity (it is more a \u201cturning\u201d than a\n\u201cdoing\u201d, more orientation than achievement); it is\nexcessive in its generosity, as opposed to being a mean,\ne.g., liberality; its supernatural inspiration contrasts with\nAristotle\u2019s naturalism; it does not imply a teleology of\nrealizing one\u2019s own virtuous projects\u2014in fact, it is a\nsuspension of one\u2019s own projects; finally, for Weil, Aristotle\nlacks a sense of the impersonal good toward which attention is\noriented (and in this respect she is, again, inspired by Plato).\n\nWeil treats the connections among attention, void, and love, relying\non her supernatural (Christian Platonic) metaphysics, in \u201cForms\nof the Implicit Love of God\u201d.\n\n\nTo empty ourselves [Se vider] of our false divinity, to deny\nourselves, to give up being the center of the world in imagination, to\ndiscern that all points in the world are equally centers and that the\ntrue center is outside the world, this is to consent to the rule of\nmechanical necessity in matter and of free choice at the center of\neach soul. Such consent is love. The face of this love, which is\nturned toward thinking persons, is the love of our neighbor. (WFG\n100)\n\n\nAttention can be seen as love, for just as attention consents to the\nexistence of another, love requires the recognition of a reality\noutside of the self, and thus de-centers the self and its\nparticularity. Contra the colloquial sense of love, it is\nbecause we do not love personally, but \u201cit is God in us who\nloves them [les malheureux]\u201d (WFG 93\u201394), that\nour love for others is \u201cquite impersonal\u201d and thereby\nuniversal (WFG 130). Weil allows, however, \u201cone legitimate\nexception to the duty of loving universally\u201d, namely, friendship\n(\u201cLast Thoughts\u201d, WFG 51). Friendship is \u201ca personal\nand human love which is pure and which enshrines an intimation and a\nreflection of divine love\u201d (WFG 131), a \u201csupernatural\nharmony, a union of opposites\u201d (WFG 126). The opposites that\nform the miraculous harmony are necessity/subordination (i.e., drawing\nfrom Thucydides\u2019 Melian dialogue, she sees it as an\nimpossibility for one to want to preserve autonomy in both oneself and\nanother; in the world the stronger exerts force through will) and\nliberty/equality (which is maintained through the desire of each\nfriend to preserve the consent of oneself and of the other, a consent\nto be \u201ctwo and not one\u201d [WFG 135]). In other words, in\nfriendship a particular, self-founded reading of the other is not\nforced. Distance is maintained, and in this way Weil\u2019s concept\nof friendship advances her previous critiques of the ethos of\ncapitalism, bureaucracy, and colonialism\u2014i.e., free consent of\nall parties is the essential ingredient of all human relations that\nare not degraded or abusive. Hence friendship is a model for ethics\nmore generally\u2014even, contra her claim, universally.\n\n\nFriendship has something universal about it. It consists of loving a\nhuman being as we should like to be able to love each soul in\nparticular of all those who go to make up the human race. (WFG\n135)\n\n\nWeil\u2019s ethics of attention informs her later social-political\nphilosophy and epistemology. In relation to her social-political\nthought, attention suspends the centrality of the self to allow for\nsupernatural justice, which involves simultaneously turning attention\nto God and to affliction. Justice and the love of the neighbor are not\ndistinct, for her.\n\n\nOnly the absolute identification of justice and love makes the\ncoexistence possible of compassion and gratitude on the one hand, and\non the other, of respect for the dignity of affliction\n[malheur] in the afflicted\u2014a respect felt by the\nsufferer himself [les malheureux par lui-m\u00eame] and the\nothers. (WFG 85)\n\n\nAdditionally, attention, in its consent to the autonomy of the other,\nis an antidote to force. Important to Weil\u2019s epistemology,\nattention militates against readings that are based on imagination,\nunexamined perceptions, or functions of the collectivity (e.g.,\nprestige). Attention here manifests as independent, detached thought.\nIn its religious valence involving obedience and consent, attention\nalso bears on Weil\u2019s epistemology in an additional way: it\nsuggests that knowing the reality of the world is less an individual\nachievement or attainment of mastery and more a gift of grace. That\nis, attention is openness to what cannot be predicted and to what\noften takes us by surprise. In this way, attention resists the natural\ntendency of humans to seek control and dominance over others. At stake\nin this ethical mode, then, is the prevention of injustices that\nresult from projects of self-expansion, including the French\ncolonialism Weil criticized in her time.\n",
