    "main_text": "Moral Evil\n8. Moral Evil and Defeasibility\n\nIf the author of sin objection does not succeed in defeating the\ntraditional view, then what is left is the question of whether God has\nsufficiently good reason for decreeing the evil that exists. The\nstandard free will defense, which works only by diminishing\nGod\u2019s authority and circumscribing his providence, is not\navailable to the theological determinist. Can the theist\u2019s\nresponse to the argument from evil survive the loss of the standard\nfree will defense?\n\nAnother free will defense may yet be available (McCann 2005). (For\nother attempts to modify a variety of free will defenses so as to make\nthem compatible with theological determinism, see Byerly 2017\nand Almeida 2017.) It must be remembered that even though the actions\nof free creatures do not escape providence, such creatures are still\nan enhancement to creation, in that their nature reflects more closely\nwhat we suppose to be God\u2019s own nature. As such, free creatures\nare more suited to the kind of fellowship with God that believers\nunderstand to be their ultimate destiny. It may be, however, that the\nachievement of that destiny inevitably involves sin. In part, this is\nbecause to have free will is to have a nature that is incomplete, in\nthe sense that what we are never fully determines what we shall do.\nRather, we have to complete our own nature, by establishing an\nidentity for ourselves \u2014 that is, by adopting the patterns of\nbehavior and long term objectives that define our lives. And it may be\nthat in so doing we inevitably find ourselves in rebellion against\nGod, simply because as free beings we are apt to assume we can\nestablish our destiny in a way that escapes providence \u2014 that\nis, entirely by our own choice \u2014 and so make that enterprise\ninstead of obedience to God our first priority. Second, it has to be\nremembered that true friendship is always voluntary. If God only\nexacts devotion from us, we are reduced to being his\nsubjects. To be friends with him requires a meaningful and responsible\ndecision on our part to accept the offer of friendship he presents to\nus. But a responsible choice in God\u2019s favor requires that we\nunderstand the alternative \u2014 which is to be at enmity with him.\nAnd there is good reason to think such an understanding requires that\nwe sin. Guilt, remorse, a sense of defilement, and the hopeless\ndesolation of being cut off from God cannot be understood in the\nabstract, because if they are only understood abstractly they are not\nours. Only through experience can we understand what it means\nto be in rebellion against God, and we gain that experience by\nsinning. By turning away from God we realize what it means to be\nalone, and we learn that however successful they may be, our own\nprojects cannot satisfy us. Only then are we in a position to choose\nresponsibly to accept God\u2019s offer of fellowship. Finally, we\nmust remember the simple fact that if we are to experience a\ntransition that ends in our being united to God, that transition can\nonly begin from a place where we are separated from him. It is\nplausible to think, however, that there is no morally neutral ground\nhere: that unless we are within the circle of God\u2019s love, we\nmust be outside it, and that once we choose voluntarily to stand\nalone, we are already in an attitude of hostility toward God. In\nshort, if we are to come to God as voluntary agents, it may well be\nthat we can only approach him from a position of sinfulness.\n\nIf this is correct, there is a great good that God, as a loving\ncreator, is able blamelessly to will for us, but which in its exercise\ninevitably leads us into blameworthiness. That good is our\nautonomy \u2014 the thing that makes us most like God, and is the\nsole means by which we are able to reach friendship with him, but\nwhich can be responsibly exercised to enter that friendship only if\nfirst employed in a conceit of rebellion, wherein we learn our\nlimitations, and come to appreciate the emptiness of a life based on\nsubjective independence. Only thus are we able to reach a position of\nmoral autonomy from which an authentic choice to enter into fellowship\nwith God is possible. Thus, freedom is indeed crucial to moral evil:\nthe implications of libertarian agency are such that its purpose in\nGod\u2019s plan could not be achieved without the occurrence of sin.\nUnlike the standard free will defense, however, this approach does not\nendanger God\u2019s sovereignty or omniscience. As creator, he is\nfully involved in those acts in which we sin, for they can occur only\nthrough his will. But he incurs no blame for them, for they are our\nacts, not his, and although they place us in rebellion against him,\nthey do not put God in rebellion against himself. Indeed, no\nindividual can be in rebellion against his own will. So if the essence\nof sin is rebellion against the will of God, then even though God is\nthe first cause of those acts in which we sin, it is not possible that\nhe himself sin in their occurrence. It is worth noting, too, that the\npresent view makes it possible to explain what, on the standard free\nwill defense, can only be a mystery \u2014 namely, that although all\nof us possess libertarian freedom, and so have the option of serving\nGod, still all humans sin. The reason for this is not that\nGod suffers a terrible run of bad luck in a grand lottery of his own\ninstitution. Rather, it is because only by passing through sin that\nthe saved are able to achieve their destiny. By creating us in our\nsinfulness, God assures that each individual will develop an authentic\nmoral identity, and, if the theistic tradition concerning divine\njustice is correct, prepares each for the eternal recompense\nappropriate to his character.\n\nAn objection may be raised at this point. It is not a part of our\nreligious tradition that all are saved. St. Paul, for example, seems\nclearly to have believed that some, the elect, are destined from the\nbeginning for salvation, and others not\n(Rom. 9:10\u201324), and the same appears true of Jesus\nhimself (Matt. 26:24, Luke 10:20). And it is part of\nstandard theology that, after death, the saved are joined to God in\nthe beatific vision, a state of eternal and indescribable joy. The\nlost fare far worse. They are condemned to the bitter and devastating\nfrustration of permanent separation from their creator, and on many\naccounts to a lot of other miseries as well. Now on the present view,\nGod is as much involved in the rebellion of the reprobate as in the\nconversion of the saved. And one may well wonder what could justify\nthis. Why should a loving God create creatures destined for\ndamnation?\n\nMany have found the idea that some creatures are destined for final\nreprobation troubling, if not downright incompatible with divine\nomnibenevolence (M.M. Adams 1993). One option here is to reject the\nconcept of reprobation, opting instead for one or another form of\nuniversalism \u2014 the view that in the end all are saved,\nor at least that salvation is never completely foreclosed to anyone.\nPerhaps in the end the will of those who would reject God is simply\noverwhelmed, so that they have no choice but to accept him.\nAlternatively, it may be that those who would reject God\u2019s\nfriendship are never able to do so with finality, so that the\nopportunity for salvation is always available to them even if they\nnever opt for it. But universalist views face the twin challenges of\napparent unorthodoxy and of seeming to trivialize earthly moral\nexistence, which most religions treat as of paramount importance. \n\nFor those who find universalism unacceptable the problem is to find\nadequate justification for the idea that some may be irretrievably\nlost. Here it should be pointed out that whatever the sufferings of\nthe lost may be, theologians have always agreed that the greatest evil\nthey sustain is final and irremediable separation from God. Nothing\ncould be worse than to be cut off from the love and friendship of a\nfather whose power extends to every detail of the universe, and who\ninvites us to a share in his very life. But if this is the greatest\nevil of damnation, then no one who ends that way is treated unfairly,\nfor this separation is precisely what one chooses by insisting on a\nlife of rebellion rather than seeking reconciliation with God. Indeed,\nhaving once created beings destined to be lost, it is hard to see how\na loving God could do anything but honor their choice in the matter\n(Kvanvig 1993, ch. 4). What is troubling, rather, is that he should\ncreate such beings at all, much less will their performance of the\nvery actions through which they reject him. It may be argued, however,\nthat even here God\u2019s love is at work. He cannot, of course,\ndirectly intend the rebellion of sinners, nor the destruction of the\nfinally unrepentant. But the lost are full participants in securing\ntheir tragic destiny; and while a life ruined by final rebellion is\nmorally indefensible, it is still morally meaningful. Through their\nactions, the lost carve out for themselves a character which, though\nnot upright, represents a real option for a free creature. Thus, the\nargument runs, to the extent that moral autonomy is a good it can be\nwilled for a creature by God even when it takes this form.\nFurthermore, it is claimed, it is a mistake to think that God is not\nlovingly involved in the lives of the reprobate, or that he would have\nbeen more loving had he not created them. On the contrary: what is\nmeaningless is to suppose that God would have shown greater love\ntoward the lost by omitting them from creation. What is not there\ncannot be loved. Equally, it is meaningless to think the lost would be\nbetter off had they not\n existed.[8]\n What does not exist is neither well nor poorly off, nor anywhere in\nbetween; and it is as good for the reprobate to have life, the\nopportunity for salvation, and an autonomous choice as to whether to\naccept it, as it is for the saved. What is not good for them is the\nuse they make of the opportunity, in choosing to be without God. But\nthat is fully their decision, and its consequences are fully\nearned.\n\nIf the sort of view outlined above is correct, there is ample reason\nfor God to create a universe in which there is moral evil, for only\nthrough the presence of moral evil is it possible for creatures like\nus to develop a legitimate moral identity, and make an informed and\nresponsible choice to accept or reject God\u2019s offer of friendship\nwith us. It is important to see that on such a view, moral evil is not\ntreated as a causal means to the good of our having friendship with\nGod. If that were so, opponents could justly object that God could\nsimply have created us in such friendship from the start, and the\ndefense would fail. Rather, the good on which this kind of theodicy is\nbased is a free and informed choice that can only be made from a\nposition of sinfulness. Rather than constituting a causal\nmeans to our establishing our own stance toward God, sin is\nan indispensable part of the process \u2014 something\nwithout which a legitimate choice for or against God\u2019s\nfriendship is not just causally but conceptually impossible. But that\nis not all. In the case of those who choose in God\u2019s favor, at\nleast, moral evil is defeated in that it is bound up in a\ntotal state of affairs that counts as a far greater good, in which the\nevil is addressed and overcome. The very autonomy that the sinner once\ninsisted upon is surrendered to God, thus becoming the foundation for\na new understanding and a richer relationship, in which one is able to\nact as an informed and wholehearted participant in the divine\nenterprise of working good. Sin does not function as a causal means in\nthis process, nor is it simply overbalanced by some other good with\nwhich it coexists. It encountered and overcome, through the\nprovidential operation of God, as manifested in creaturely\nfreedom.\n\nThe idea that evil is defeasible was developed first by Roderick\nChisholm (1968). It is an especially useful notion for theodicy, in\nthat when evil is defeated, the usual objections to the presence of\nevil in the plan of providence are turned aside. If evil were only a\nmeans to good, and were simply outweighed by the goods to which it\nleads, antitheists could legitimately object that God could have\ncreated a better world simply by omitting the evil and creating those\ngoods outright, or obtaining them through means that were not evil. By\ncontrast, when evil is defeated it is caught up in a larger state of\naffairs that constitutes a far greater good, but not by containing\ncomponents that might have occurred independent of the evil in\nquestion, and simply outweigh it. Rather, the evil is addressed within\nthe larger state of affairs in such a way that it becomes integral to\nthe good through which it is defeated. The defeat of evil is,\nmoreover, an especially impressive sort of good. That Beethoven should\nhave overcome the natural evil of his deafness to write the music he\ndid, for example, strikes us as an amazing good \u2014 one far\ngreater than what would have been accomplished had Beethoven written\nthe same music (assuming that to have been possible) with good\nhearing. Similarly, that moral evil is overcome through the process by\nwhich sinners are brought into a right relationship with God may be\nconsidered a far greater good than would have been accomplished had he\nmade us a community of spiritual lotus eaters, whose relationship to\nhim, if any, was founded on no meaningful decision, but simply upon\nour never having had the experience that would make anything else\npossible. Indeed, given the moral vacuity of such an existence, it is\nnot obvious that such creatures would even be fit for divine\nfriendship, much less able to make the decision through which that\nrelationship is brought to pass.\n\nBut of course the same does not occur in the case of any who might be\nlost. Their rebellion is permanent, and is not overcome through any\naction of theirs. The antitheist may wish to argue that in this case\nit is evil that triumphs over good. The character of the lost is\npermanently corrupted: any virtue that was theirs is turned to\nwrongdoing, and any hope that they might even achieve peace with God,\nmuch less be of useful service to him, comes to nothing. Thus, it\nmight be claimed, the very existence of the reprobate stands as a\ngratuitous and unanswered defilement of creation, in which evil is\nvictorious. Can the theist point to anything that might reverse this\nverdict? One possibility is that God himself could take action\nspecifically aimed at defeating all moral evil. This, of course is the\ndefining theme of Christian soteriology. In that tradition, all sin is\ndefeated through the paramount manifestation of God\u2019s love for\nthe world, the redemptive suffering of Christ, which could not have\noccurred unless there were sin, and which makes possible God\u2019s\noffer of salvation to humankind. Not all sinners may accept the offer,\nbut God is reconciled to all, in the sense that the substitutionary\natonement of Christ covers all wrongfulness. For the Christian\nbeliever this is a sine qua non: nothing but the sacrifice of\na being who participates fully in the divine nature is sufficient to\nsatisfy fully the demand of divine justice, and unless that demand is\nsatisfied friendship between God and humankind is impossible. Thus the\nredemptive suffering of Christ is for Christians the ultimate act of\nmercy and compassion on God\u2019s part toward all sinners, and the\nultimate defeat of moral evil (see Plantinga 2004).\n\nThis kind of answer is, however, confined to a particular religious\ntradition. Is a more general solution possible? There are at least two\nlines of response the theist can take up at this point. First, he can\nargue that the moral evil wrought by unrepentant sinners is defeated\nthrough divine justice. Evildoers who refuse reconciliation with God\nreceive a recompense addressed precisely to their offense: a permanent\nstate of separation from the God they reject. The destruction this\nentails befits their situation, but it is also a destruction the\nwrongdoer chooses, and his choice is honored by God in the outcome.\nThus, religious apologists argue, the fate of the reprobate is a\nmanifestation not only of God\u2019s love for them, but also of his\njustice. Without sin, it is held, much of God\u2019s goodness could\nbe displayed in the world, but his justice could not. Not that God\ndoes not forgive the unrepentant; he does, but his forgiveness is\nrejected, and that is what seals the sinner\u2019s fate. So while the\nsinfulness of the unrepentant is not overcome through their accepting\nsalvation, it is defeated through God\u2019s justice in honoring\ntheir rebellion. This display of God\u2019s character is what some\nhave identified as \u201cglory,\u201d and so this is a version of\nthe divine glory defense (see Johnson 2016; for another version of the\ndivine glory defense, see Green 2016 and Hart 2016.) Secondly, there\nis the fact that the sinner\u2019s deeds are visited upon others in\nthe world, who must cope not only with the suffering and hardship that\nresults, but also with the very fact of sin: with knowing they have\nbeen denied the dignity appropriate to rational beings, and instead\nmade the object of malice. Here too, the theist might argue, it is\npossible for sin to be defeated, by being pointed out and corrected,\nand above all by being forgiven. In admonishing and forgiving those\nwho sin toward us, we ally ourselves with God in the struggle against\nmoral evil, by refusing to lapse into vengefulness and self-pity, and\ninstead focusing ourselves, and if possible the sinner as well, on the\nhigher things of God. This also is a good to which sin is integral,\nrather than constituting a mere causal means, and which makes the\nworld far better than it would be if sin never occurred.\n",
