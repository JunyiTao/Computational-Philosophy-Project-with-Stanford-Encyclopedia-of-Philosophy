It was based initially on Hebrew\ntranslations of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s short commentaries\nand Averroes\u2019s middle commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon and the logical part of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s\nOpinions. But Jewish scholars also became familiar with some\nLatin material, such as Peter of Spain\u2019s Treatise\n(especially the parts on the logica vetus). Gersonides was an\noriginal logician, who wrote widely-studied supercommentaries on\nAverroes\u2019s middle commentaries, where he is often critical of\nAverroes, and a treatise, the Book of the Correct Syllogism,\nremarkable for its degree of formalization (see Manekin 2012).\n",
