    "main_text": "Perspectives on Perception || S\u0101\u1e43khya definition\n2.4 S\u0101\u1e43khya definition\n\nIn the oldest S\u0101\u1e43khya tradition, perception is the\nfunctioning of a sense organ. This is clearly inadequate, as the\nancient skeptic Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (c. 8th century\nCE) is quick to point out. Perception in this sense cannot be a means\nof knowledge (pram\u0101\u1e47a) as it does not distinguish\nbetween proper and improper functioning of sense organs and,\ntherefore, between valid and erroneous perceptions. A more\nsophisticated definition is later devised wherein perception is\n\u201can ascertainment [of buddhi or intellect] in regard to\na sense faculty (S\u0101\u1e43khyak\u0101rik\u0101 5 in\nYukt\u012bdipik\u0101)\u201d. This implies that perception\nis a modification of the intellect in the form of selective\nascertainment of an object, brought about by the activity or\nfunctioning of a sense faculty. In some respects, this\ncharacterization of perception as an \u201cascertainment\u201d of\nthe intellect neatly captures the idea that perception, being an\ninstrument of knowledge, is the primary means of knowledge.\nAscertainment residing in the intellect is regarded as the instrument\nof perception, while residing in the self it is regarded as the result\nof the process of perception. Furthermore, the\nS\u0101\u1e43khyak\u0101rik\u0101 states that the function\nof the senses with regard to the objects is \u201ca mere\nseeing\u201d (S\u0101\u1e43khyak\u0101rik\u0101, 28b), and\nthe function of the intellect, referred to as ascertainment, can be\nthought of as \u201cidentification\u201d of the object as in\n\u201cthis is a cow\u201d, etc.\n(S\u0101\u1e43khyak\u0101rik\u0101 5ab). This suggests a\ntwo-stage process: first the functioning of the sense faculty results\nin \u201cmere seeing\u201d of the object (non-conceptualized\nawareness) and, later this mere seeing is acted upon by the intellect\nor mind and results in a conceptual identification of the object. This\ntwo-stage process is very similar to the detailed account of\nconceptual (savikalpaka) perception offered by the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and the Naiy\u0101yikas.\n",
