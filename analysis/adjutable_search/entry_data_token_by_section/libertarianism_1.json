    "main_text": "Property Rights and Original Acquisition\n2. Property Rights and Original Acquisition\n\nLibertarians conceive of distributive justice as largely (sometimes\nexclusively) historical in nature. To ask whether justice obtains in\nthe world is mainly to ask whether people have been justly treated,\nprincipally whether their rights to their persons and possessions have\nbeen respected. Libertarians generally see people\u2019s rightful\npossessions as whatever they acquired in legitimate (i.e.,\nrights-respecting) ways. As a result, they reject theories that\nconnect entitlement to outcomes or end-state distributions. In Kantian\nlanguage, libertarians believe distributive justice is\nexhausted by commutative justice. As long as no wrongs have\nbeen inflicted by one individual upon another at private law, the\noverall distribution is without moral remainder. There is no way of a\ndistribution to be unjust other than by it resulting from some sort of\nprivate law wrong(s).\n\nThe most common mode of just acquisition is through voluntary\ntransfer. This is why libertarians generally defend noncoerced\n(Christmas 2022a), nondeceptive (Ferguson 2018) market relations as\njust. Nozick\u2019s \u201centitlement theory\u201d of distributive\njustice consists entirely of these two modes of acquisition and a\nprinciple of rectification for their violation. Redistribution is\ntherefore in principle limited to when it is necessary to correct for\nwrongful takings (Byas 2022). However, for A\u2019s\nentitlement to some possession x to be legitimized by\nB\u2019s voluntary transfer of x to A,\nB\u2019s prior entitled to x needs to be\nestablished. There must, at least in principle, be a starting point;\nan original acquisition through which objects that are not\nowned by anyone \u2013 that no one in particular has unique\nentitlement to \u2013 come to be owned by some particular person\n(Christmas 2021c, pp. 3\u20134).\n\nLibertarians generally accept that individuals can carry out such acts\nof original acquisition. More precisely, they accept that individuals\ncan acquire unowned goods unilaterally, without there needing to be\nauthorization by some pre-existing political institution nor needing\nto obtain the consent of other people.\n\nThe most famous account of how unilateral original acquisition is\npossible remains Locke\u2019s labor theory. According to Locke, when\npeople work on previously unowned objects, subject to certain\nprovisos, they turn those objects into their private property. The\nprecise nature of Locke\u2019s argument, the relation between labor\nand acquisition, as well as the nature of the provisos, is hotly\ncontested. The most famous interpretation, again, seeks to ground\nproperty in the (prior) rights of self-ownership. On this view, when\npeople labor they quite literally extend their claims of\nself-ownership over external objects, thus drawing them into their\nrights-protected sphere. As Locke (1690, ch. 5) put it, since laboring\nmixes one\u2019s self-owned labor with something that is unowned, the\npreviously unowned thing becomes owned.\n\nSo stated, this argument suffers from well-known problems. For\ninstance, since laboring is an activity, the idea of mixing it with an\nobject seems at best a metaphor for something else (Hume 1739,\nIII.II.IIVI fn., Day 1966, Waldron 1983, 1988, pp. 184\u201391). But\nin that case, the argument is incomplete\u2014we still need to know\nwhat really grounds property rights. More importantly, it simply is\nnot true that mixing something owned with something unowned is\nsufficient for appropriation. As Nozick pointed out, if I pour a can\nof tomato juice that I own into the unowned ocean, I lose my tomato\njuice\u2014I do not gain an ocean (Nozick 1974, pp. 174\u20135).\nIndeed, Locke himself noted that acts of labour cannot acquire\nownership of the sea (though, they can acquire ownership of fish\ncaught in the sea) (1690 II.30) Third, when the object with which one\nmixes one\u2019s labour is already owned by someone else, this is\ntypically regarded as a way of dissipating or donating one\u2019s\nlabour (Thomson 1990, pp. 326\u2013327).\n\nThere are two prominent defences of a labour-based account of original\nacquisition. The first is Hillel Steiner\u2019s physicalistic version\n(1994, p. 233 fn). On this view we literally mix energy that\nwe own with unowned objects when we labour on them. The idea of mixing\nactivities with objects does not, therefore, need to enter. However,\nwe often expend our energy into all sorts of things that few want to\nclaim we thereby appropriate, often with no intention or volition in\ndoing so. We involuntarily transfer heat into the atmosphere, for\nexample. Moreover, attempts to appropriate things often do not involve\ntransfers of energy into that particular object, but rather our\npossession of the object is the result of our energy\ntransfers into other objects. For example, in capturing a wild animal.\nWhilst this rescues the metaphysical idea of labour-mixing as one in\nwhich ownership literally \u201cseeps over into the rest\u201d as\nNozick puts it (1974, p. 174), it raises serious questions over\nwhether labouring upon things is actually the way to acquire them\nsince it is neither necessary nor sufficient to mixing our energy with\nthem (Christmas 2021c, p. 74).\n\nThe second is an indirect account (van der Vossen 2021a, 2021b [Other\nInternet Resources]). On this view, unilateral acquisition enables us\nto come to own the fruits of our labour in an economic rather than a\nphysical sense. This approach seeks to tie considerations regarding\nthe material prosperity that systems of private property and contracts\nbring about into the justification of unilateral acquisition, without\nmaking the entire theory a merely rule-consequentialist one.\n\nThere is a broad and influential line of consequentialist argument\nthat ties the justification of property to the material prosperity and\nwell-being that it brings about. Rights of private property serve to\ndivide the external world into a number of discrete, individual parts,\neach exclusively controlled by its particular owner. Organizing the\nsocial world in this way is preferable to collective use or ownership\nbecause it helps avoid collective action problems. When things remain\nheld in open-access commons, we all have an incentive to use as much\nas we can, leading to a general pattern of use that ends up depleting\nthe resource, to everyone\u2019s detriment. Rights to private\nproperty not only avoid such a \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d\nthey also incentivize people to preserve their parts, increase their\nproductivity, and exchange what they own with others on mutually\nbeneficial terms (Schmidtz 1994; Buchanan 1993). The indirect\nlabour-mixing account incorporates these considerations in a\nnon-consequentialist way, as Nozick claimed to be trying to do (1974,\np. 177).\n\nMany have offered non-labour-based defenses of unilateral acquisition.\nOn such views, unilateral acquisition is taken to be a requirement of\nour being project pursuers or purposive agents (Lomasky 1987; Mack\n1990, 2010, Wendt 2022). Such accounts often argue for the\nimpossibility of separating our biomass from our tools; acquisition on\nthis view just being an entailment of making objects part of our\nactions and therefore inseparable from our bodily rights (Wheeler\n1980), and therefore presupposes no distinct power to create\nnew property rights. A common critique of approaches to libertarianism\ngrounded in a non-aggression principle (NAP) is that is assumes\nwithout argument that property rights violations constitute\naggressions against the person, when the connection of property to\nperson is precisely the point of contention (Zwolinski 2016).\nConnecting external property rights to personal or bodily rights\nvindicates the NAP-based approaches (Christmas 2018b).\n\nOther justifications depend neither on accepting a prior thesis of\nself-ownership, nor on the affiliated thesis that self-ownership\nrights can be extended outwardly through labor. Instead, these\narguments point to the moral importance of people having security over\nexternal resources. Sometimes this is understood in terms of support\nfor political and civil liberties (Friedman 1962, Gaus 2010). Since\nthese justifications of property do not rest on a prior principle of\nself-ownership, they are not committed to seeing property rights as\nabsolute as self-self-ownership advocates take those rights to be.\nThey therefore need not be as immune to regulation and taxation.\nDespite what is sometimes suggested (Freeman 2001), virtually all\nlibertarians that reject self-ownership as a starting point also\naccept that property rights need specification, can be instantiated in\nquite different, yet morally acceptable forms, and might be overridden\nby other moral considerations. Such views do not entail the\nimpossibility of unilateral original appropriation either.\n\nLibertarians and their critics are concerned with the issue of\noriginal appropriation primarily because it demarcates a major fault\nline in political philosophy. The libertarian\u2019s historical\nconception of justice, and the accompanying insistence that\ngovernments refrain from redistributive projects, require that\nproperty rights do not depend on the government, positive law, or the\nconsent of others for their moral validity. Such a view is viable if\none can establish the possibility of unilateral appropriation, without\nessential reference to the existence of the state or law.\n\nThe strongest objection to this area of libertarian thought comes from\nneo-Kantian legal and political philosophers who draw up Kant\u2019s\narguments that acquisition of property rights in a state of nature is\nconceptually incoherent at worst, and unjust at best. Neo-Kantians\nlargely agree with libertarians that the primary authorization for the\nuse of coercion in society is to secure freedom for all individuals,\nand such individual freedom is borne out in large part through\ncontractual freedom and private property rights. However, they\ndisagree with libertarians in that they believing that state authority\nis ontologically foundational to individual freedom.\n\nNeo-Kantians argue that property rights cannot be unilaterally\nacquired outside of a state\u2019s authorization for one or more of\nthree reasons: (1) Property rights in a state of nature would be\nindeterminate; leading not only to the high likelihood of\ninsoluble disputes (over boundaries and the like), but the\ninevitability of them. Without a state to lay down a judgement over\nwhat counts as whose property and enforce it, disputes have no\nprincipled answer, and therefore there is no fact of the matter about\nwhat rights and duties individuals have in these cases. (2)\nUnilateral acquisition and determination of property rights\nconstitutes the imposition of one person\u2019s will on all others.\nHaving the authority to create new duties and impose them on all\nothers by one\u2019s discretionary choice is not something one could\nhave among equals. Having the content of one\u2019s duties being\nsubject to another\u2019s arbitrary will is to be unfree and unequal\non the Kantian view. (3) In a state of nature, any putative rights are\nnot assured. Without a guarantee of some sort that our person\nand possessions be secured against violence, we are authorized to take\npre-emptive action against potential aggressors, and they against us,\nmeaning that no one is under any duty to abstain from using force\nagainst others. According to neo-Kantians, having a state provides a\nsolution to all these problems. Its geographical monopoly on the use\nof force means it can determinately lay down a scheme of rights and\nduties under law and credibly enforce it (overcoming problems 1 and\n3). Moreover, the state is not just another private actor, on this\nview, but rather has the capacity to act on behalf of all \u2013 it\nis an omnilateral actor rather than unilateral. Therefore its use of\ncoercion to secure rights does not subject us to any arbitrary will\n(solving problem 2). In short, property rights can only be created by\na public power. (Waldron 1996, 1999 part 2, Flikschuh 1999,\n2000 ch. 4, 2008, Varden 2008, 2010; Ripstein 2009 ch. 6, 2012, Stilz\n2009, ch. 2; 2011; 2012; Hodgson 2010; Pallikkathayil 2010; Sinclair\n2018).\n\nBecause of this, some neo-Kantians argue that since the state is\nontologically prior to property rights, there are limits to how much\nwork an historical entitlement theory can do in justifying particular\nholdings. There are no acts of original acquisition that vindicate a\nchain of transfers leading up to the present, but rather it is state\nauthority vindicates property rights. State redistribution, therefore,\ncannot be condemned on the basis that it violates property rights\n\u2013 it is the state\u2019s coercion that creates\nproperty rights. (Hasan 2018) In a state of nature, individuals can,\nat best, only acquire \u201cprovisional\u201d property rights,\nmeaning that they are at liberty to make use of these objects, but\nothers are not duty-bound to respect your claim, and neither would a\nstate once it is established be obligated to treat it as a\nfully-fledged property right. (Kant 1797, 6.255, Ripstein 2009 p. 165,\nStilz 2009 p.45, 2018, Hasan 2018, Messina 2019)\n\nLibertarian responses to these criticisms have taken the form of\narguing that unilateral acquisition is merely the specification of a\nright we already have rather than the creation of new rights through\nsome arbitrary power. It therefore does not presuppose any superior\nmoral status of the acquirer nor does it problematically subject third\nparties (van der Vossen 2009, 2015, Sazanov 2022). On this view,\noriginal acquisition (when done justly) is a case of duty-activation\nrather than duty-creation. Similarly, it has been argued that property\nrights can be made determinate by constitutive social conventions that\ndo not require any state authority, and so long as property rights are\ndeterminate, the other problems fall away (Christmas 2021a).\n\nLeft-libertarianism2 here can be seen to side-step the\nobjection in virtue of its commitment to an equal distribution of\nexternal property. So long as your unilateral acquisition cannot be\nsaid to be greater than your equal share, there is no moral remainder\n(Steiner 2017, 2000, cf. Sage 2012).\n",
