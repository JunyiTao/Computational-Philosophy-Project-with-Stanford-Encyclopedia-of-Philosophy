    "main_text": "Perfectionist Ethics || Elitism and Inequality\n2.2 Elitism and Inequality\n\n\nPerfectionist ethics has often been associated with elitist\ndoctrines. Whether it takes a consequentialist or deontological\nstructure, perfectionism is compatible with assigning different weights\nto the perfection of different human beings. And a number of\nimportant perfectionist writers have maintained that the perfection\nthat matters the most is the perfection of those who are capable of\nachieving the most. This \u201csuperman\u201d version of\nperfectionism, a view famously associated with Nietzsche, gives\nabsolute weight to the excellence achievable by certain great men, such\nas Socrates or Goethe and zero weight to the rest of humanity\n(Nietzsche 1873/1876; Griffin 1986, 60\u201361).\n\n\nThe superman version of perfectionism is an extreme view. It\nholds that some human lives count for much and many human lives count\nfor nothing. This view should not be confused with a different\nand less extreme view, one that can be termed the prioritarian\nversion of perfectionism. This view holds that we should\nvalue the perfection of each and every human being, but in aggregating\nhuman perfection we should count the greater perfections more than the lesser\n perfections.[5]\nHow much more?  On a simple version of the view, greater perfections\ncount for more than lesser perfections simply in virtue of being\ngreater.  A human life that achieves twice as much perfection as\nanother human life has twice as much value.  But it is possible that\ngreater perfections count for even more.  On a complex version of the\nview, greater perfections count for more than lesser perfections in\nvirtue of being greater and in virtue of an appropriate multiplier.\nMore precisely, on this version of the view, an equal unit increase of\nperfection counts for more the greater the perfection already\nattained.  Accordingly, a human life that achieved twice as much\nperfection as another human life would have more than twice its\nvalue.\n\n\nThe prioritarian version of perfectionism, on either the simple or\ncomplex version of the view, does not imply that the lives of those\nwho can achieve little count for nothing. It holds only that greater\nperfections\u2014a greater development of human nature or a greater\nrealization of objective goods\u2014 have greater value. It directs\nus to pursue the greatest overall human perfection, where this is\ndetermined by a weighted summing of the perfection of all human\nbeings.\n\n\nCompared with the superman version, the prioritarian version of\nperfectionism is significantly more plausible. It captures the\nthought that greater achievements are more valuable than lesser\nachievements without denying value to the latter. It recognizes\nthe claims of greatness without excluding all other achievements from\nmoral concern. Still, while not elitist, prioritarian\nperfectionism will likely have inegalitarian implications for the\ndistribution of resources. Thomas Nagel explains:\n\n\nA society should try to foster the creation and preservation of what\nis best, or as good as it possibly can be, and this is just as\nimportant as the widespread dissemination of what is merely good\nenough. Such an aim can be pursued only by recognizing and\nexploiting the natural inequalities between persons, encouraging\nspecialization and distinction of levels in education, and accepting\nthe variation in accomplishment which results. (Nagel 1991, 135)\n\n\nOne might object to these claims by holding that a sufficient amount\nof goods that are \u201cmerely good enough\u201d should be able to\noutweigh a small number of truly excellent goods. But if the excellent\ngoods are weighted more heavily, as recommended by the prioritarian\nversion of perfectionism, then in practice this possibility may be\nunlikely. (Much depends here on the strength of the prioritarian\nmultiplier.) Nagel appears to accept the prioritarian view, for he\nconcludes that \u201cno egalitarianism can be right which would permit\nhaute cuisine, haute couture, and exquisite houses to disappear just\nbecause not everyone can have them\u201d (Nagel 1991, 138).\n\n\nThe prioritarian version of perfectionism, then, may license\nsignificant inequality in the distribution of resources. The\ninegalitarian character of the view has some attractive consequences,\nhowever. When applied to population ethics, it has the potential to\navoid Parfit\u2019s \u201cRepugnant Conclusion\u201d. As Parfit\nexplains:\n\n\nWe might claim that, even if some change brings a great net benefit\nto those who are affected, it is a change for the worse if it involves\nthe loss of one of the best things in life (Parfit 1986, 163).\n\n\nThe focus here, as with Nagel\u2019s remarks, is on perfectionist goods\nrather than on the welfare of human beings. To avoid the repugnant\nconclusion, it must be claimed that these goods\u2014\u201cthe\nkinds of experience and activity which do most to make life most worth\nliving\u201d\u2014take absolute priority over less\nvaluable experiences and activities.\n\n\nThis claim, as Parfit allows, is vulnerable to counterexample. It is\nvery hard to believe that the best artistic experience is infinitely\nbetter than a slightly less good, but still excellent, artistic\nexperience. Viewing a Picasso might be better than viewing a Braque,\nbut not infinitely better. It is more plausible, then, to construe the\nprioritarian version of perfectionism as just assigning some finite\npositive multiplier to the greater perfections. But while such a view\nwould not be vulnerable to the kind of counterexample just adduced, it\nwould disable it from answering the Repugnant Conclusion (Hurka 1993,\n81\u201382).\n\n\nThe discussion so far has emphasized the perfectionist concern with\ncreating and preserving the best human experiences and activities. This\nconcern inclines perfectionism toward inequality. But it is possible to\ndefend an egalitarian version of the view; and the history of\nperfectionist ethics contains a number of such examples. Here four\npossibilities for developing an egalitarian version of perfectionism\nbriefly can be mentioned.\n\n\n(1) One can hold, as Spinoza did, that the most important\nperfectionist goods, such as understanding, are non-competitive. Their\nrealization by one human being does not impede, and may advance, their\nrealization in others. Maximum perfection, so understood, is compatible\nwith equality of material condition (Spinoza 1667).\n\n\n(2) One can hold, as some writers like T. H. Green did, that\ninequality in the distribution of resources impedes the perfection of\nall, the rich as well as the poor. Perfectionist values, on this view,\ncan be fully realized only in a society in which each member is roughly\nequal in power and status (Green 1986; Brink 2003, 77\u201388).\n\n\n(3) One can hold that the perfection of each human being matters\nequally and that the distribution of resources most likely to promote\nthe greatest overall human perfection is not one that contains great\ninequalities. Such a view would reject the prioritarian multiplier\ndiscussed above, holding instead that equal unit increases of\nperfection for those who achieve little count the same as equal unit\nincreases of perfection for those who achieve much; e.g., an increase\nfrom 9 to 10 has the same value as an increase from 99 to 100.\n\n\n(4) One can hold that perfectionism inclines toward inequality, but\nthat other non-perfectionist principles impose an egalitarian\nconstraint on the pursuit of perfectionist values.\n\n\nThese possibilities show that there is no tight connection between\nperfectionism and inequality. The degree to which perfectionism\nlicenses inequality will depend on answers to a number of difficult\nquestions, e.g. which version of perfectionism is best?, how great are\nthe natural differences between human beings?, to what extent are\nperfectionist goods competitive?, and what, if any, non-perfectionist\nmoral principles limit the pursuit of perfectionist values? The answers\nto these questions are very much in dispute within perfectionist\nmorality. Without firm answers to them, no one should reject\nperfectionist ethics out of hand because of a commitment to egalitarian\nvalues.\n",
