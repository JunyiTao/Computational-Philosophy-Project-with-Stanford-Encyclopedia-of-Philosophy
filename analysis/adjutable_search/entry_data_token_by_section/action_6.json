    "main_text": "Extended Action\n3. Extended Action\n\nDavidson\u2019s work focuses mostly on \u201cpunctual\nactions\u201d, actions that take place very quickly, and that have\nalready occurred. A typical example of an action for Davidson will be\ndescribed by a sentence like \u201c\u03b1 flicked the\nswitch\u201d (see Davidson 1971). Flicking a switch happens almost\ninstantaneously; moreover, when I describe my action as \u201cflicked\nthe switch\u201d, the sentence picks up a completed event in which\nthe action is already done. And flicking a switch, buttering toast,\netc. are actions typically performed from beginning to end without\ninterruption. In sum, Davidson\u2019s typical examples of actions are\nshort-lived, continuous, and completed actions. Davidson\u2019s\nconception of an intention follows a similar pattern, focusing on\nintentions that are executed in actions that follow the aforementioned\npattern. At first, Davidson takes intentions in (short-lived) action\nto be primary, and later (Davidson 1970b) expands the model to\nprospective intention (intentions for a future action), but still\nfocusing mostly on intentions for a simply executed action that\nhappens to lie in the future. However our actions often extend through\nlong stretches of time, and seem to rely on future-directed intentions\nthat govern very complex plans and activities. Moreover, we only seem\nto have a completed action when we are no longer engaged in the\nrelevant activity (when it is true that I\u2019ve crossed the street\nI am no longer engaged in the activities that constitute or are means\nto having crossed the street); agency arguably manifests itself only\nin action in progress (I am engaged in these activities while I am\ncrossing the street). By keeping our focus on completed action,\nwe risk losing sight of another seemingly essential feature of human\naction: that it extends through time under the guidance of the agent.\nOf course, this kind of initial focus on nearly momentary, completed\nactions does not necessarily mean that the theory cannot accommodate\nextended action that requires complex planning or action in progress\n(or any form of agency that necessarily stretches through time). But a\nnumber of philosophers have tried to either expand, modify, or reject\nDavidson\u2019s theory to account for extended agency or action in\nprogress, or to argue that a proper theory of action should focus on\nthe nature and structure of action in progress (Thompson 2008; Ford\n2018). This section will focus on extended agency of the former kind,\nand the relevance of action in progress will be discussed in section\n4.\n\nMichael Bratman\u2019s work (Bratman 1987; 1999a; 2007; 2018, among\nothers) was seminal in arguing for the importance of intentions,\npolicies, and plans (all of which he classifies as intentions or\nplanning states) in our understanding of how limited rational beings\ncoordinate their actions through time and can pursue ends and projects\nthrough extended periods of time. Bratman\u2019s planning theory of\nagency starts from rejecting Davidson\u2019s account of intention,\nand replacing it with a new understanding of the function (and nature)\nof intentions and planning states. Davidson had identified intention\nwith an \u201call-out\u201d or unconditional judgment, \u201cwhich,\nif we were to express it in words, would have a form like \u201dThis\naction is desirable\u2019\u201c (Davidson 1970b, 55); that is, an\nintention is a distinctive kind of evaluative judgment (\u201dthis\naction is good\u201c or \u201dthis action is desirable\u201c). On\nthis view, to intend to \u03c6 is to have \u03c6-ing as the conclusion\nof one\u2019s practical reasoning. Bratman finds this view\nproblematic in many ways, but arguably his most important objection to\nDavidson\u2019s view is that Davidson\u2019s theory of intention\nmisses out one of the \u201dtwo faces\u201c of intentions.\nIntentions, on Bratman\u2019s views, are tied not only to intentional\naction but also to coordinating plans (Bratman 1987); Davidson\u2019s\nidentification of intentions with certain evaluative judgments seems\nincapable of making room for the latter \u201dface\u201c. However,\nthis role of future-directed intentions in planning and\ncoordinating action through time is essential to agency. Among our\nfuture-directed intentions, there are very specific intentions to,\nsay, make huevos rancheros for brunch later today, but also more\ncomplex plans and projects (my plan to write a book on tricycles is\nalso a specific, though not significantly filled out, intention for a\nspecific action or set of actions), and policies (my policy to\nexercise once a week is a \u201drepeatable\u201c, general, intention\nto perform various futures\n actions).[3]\n\nFuture-directed intentions have for Bratman at least two important\nfunctions in our deliberation: they have a settling function and a\ncoordination function. Suppose I am deciding where I am spending my\nnext vacation, and let us assume that I narrow it down to two\npossibilities: Poughkeepsie and Daytona Beach. At some point,\ntypically much before my first vacation day, I will form an intention\nto go on one of these specific vacations (say to Daytona Beach), and\nthis intention is independent of forming an evaluative judgment in\nfavour of either option; I might be convinced that they are equally\ndesirable, but I can only take one vacation a year. Forming the\nintention to go to Daytona Beach settles the question for me\nand ends deliberation on the matter. Since there is intrinsically no\nlimit on how long I could spend deliberating, this settling function\nperforms an important role in managing the cognitive resources of\nlimited beings like us. But future-directed intentions also perform an\nimportant coordinating function in our extended agency. Going on\nvacation is a complex endeavour and we cannot successfully engage in\nthis action without prior planning. If I am going to Daytona Beach, I\nneed to plan how long I will stay, and what I will do when I am there,\nmake hotel reservations, etc. These plans will also require more\nconcrete plans as these actions unfold (if I plan to have snacks with\nme for the Indy-500, I need to plan which snacks, and then plan on\nwhere and when I will get them, and then plan on how I will get to the\nchosen grocery store, and so forth). Our capacity to form these\ndifferent types of future-directed intentions (plans, policies, and\nmore specific future-directed intentions) allows us to engage in these\ncomplex forms of extended agency (to be \u201dplanning agents\u201c\nin Bratman\u2019s words). In order to perform these functions,\nfuture-directed intentions must resist reconsideration and be stable\nthrough time. If I keep changing my mind after I form the intention to\ntravel to Daytona Beach, my intention will not have settled the issue\nor foreclosed further deliberation. And it will also make both\nintrapersonal and interpersonal coordination impossible: if I expect I\nwill change my mind, there\u2019ll be no point in making hotel\nreservations at Daytona Beach. Moreover, these functions impose\ncoherence constraints on my intentions: lack of means-ends coherence,\nfor instance, will similarly prevent future-directed intention from\nfunctioning properly.\n\nThus, Bratman, as well as a number of other philosophers afterwards\n(for instance, Holton 2004; Holton 2009; Yaffe 2010; Paul 2014),\nsuggest that an account of planning agency reshapes our understanding\nof agency and practical rationality. Bratman (1987) argues, for\ninstance, that certain dispositions for nonreconsideration are\nessential to understanding the rationality of limited agents like\nourselves. Holton (2004; 2009) extends Bratman\u2019s account to\nanother function of a future-directed intention: resisting temptation\nwhen we expect preferences and judgment shifts. We achieve this,\naccording to Holton, by forming resolutions: intentions to\nremain firm in our intentions, which are harder to reconsider than\nsimple desires or (first-order) intentions. (See Paul 2011a for some\nskepticism about this extension.)\n\nBratman also tries to expand his planning theory to explain the\nrationality of acting on a future-directed intention even in cases in\nwhich judgment or preference shifts might seem to justify acting\notherwise. In earlier work, Bratman (1999b) appeals to a\n\u201dno-regret\u201c condition; roughly, a requirement that we\nshould not reconsider or revise an intention if we\u2019ll regret\nhaving done so at the conclusion of our planned actions. In later\nwork, Bratman (2018) appeals to the end of self-governance, an end\nthat is typically shared by human agents, to explain the rationality\nof sticking to one\u2019s intentions in face of temptation (for\nsomewhat similar ideas in the context of cooperation, see Velleman\n1997). According to Bratman, self-governance is a form of agency in\nwhich the agent acts from a standpoint that is truly his own; a\nself-governing agent is guided \u201dby attitudes that constitute\nwhere he stands\u201c (Bratman 2018,\n 159).[4]\n On this view, self-governance has both a synchronic and diachronic\nform. Synchronic self-governance requires a coherent practical\nstandpoint at a time that can constitute where the agent stands in a\ncoherent manner, while diachronic self-governance requires a coherent\nstandpoint across different times when the agent\u2019s plans stretch\nthrough an extended period. Since typically planning agents also have\nself-governance as one of their ends, the need for such a coherent\nstandpoint generates reasons to conform to a requirement not to revise\nintentions not only in cases of temptation, but also in cases in which\nan agent forms a future-directed intention to choose one of a number\nof alternatives that are either indifferent or incommensurable. Even\nthough in such cases an agent has sufficient reasons to act\ndifferently than she intends (since other options are just as good or\nat least on a par), self-governance requires that she preserves a\ncoherent standpoint over time (for a different way to justify\nnormative reasons against \u201dbrute shuffling\u201c in terms of\nself-governance, see Paul 2014; for skepticism about some of these\nrequirements against brute shuffling, see Ferrero 2010; Nefsky and\nTenenbaum 2022).\n\nAlthough these challenges to Davidson\u2019s original theory of\naction are different from the challenges that focus on the nature of\naction in progress, some philosophers argue that they are not\nunrelated. Tenenbaum (2018; 2020) argues that understanding better the\nnature of intentional action as actions that are always\nextended through time, and the nature of the instrumental reasoning\ninvolved in intentional action in progress, makes Bratman\u2019s\nappeal to a sui generis state of future-directed intention\nsuperfluous in our understanding of practical rationality. On this\nview, there is no difference between the rational requirements\ngoverning the various phases of an action in progress and the\nrequirements governing the execution of a plan that contains various\nsteps, or of a general intention that contains various instances (and\nthus purported requirements that are specific to future-directed\nintentions turn out to be redundant or spurious).\n\nOn a somewhat different vein, some philosophers have challenged the\nview that there is a significant metaphysical \u201dbreak\u201c\nbetween a prior intention and an action in progress. From the time I\ndecide to make an omelet, to the time the finished product is on my\nplate, my agency unfolds in various stages and phases in pursuit of\nthis end: I plan to make an omelet, I check which ingredients I need,\nI make sure that I leave myself enough time to go to the store while\nengaged in other activities in the morning, I buy the milk, go back\nhome, melt the butter, break the eggs, drop them on the pan, and so\nforth. These are all parts, or phases, of the unfolding of the\nactivity that, if nothing untoward happens, will result in my having\nmade an omelet. Although we can impose various breaks and divide the\nprocess into \u201dintending\u201c, \u201dpreparing\u201c,\n\u201dmaking the omelet\u201c, these breaks are largely arbitrary\nfrom the point of view of the activity itself (Thompson 2008; Moran\nand Stone 2009; Ferrero 2017; Russell 2018); a metaphysics of\nintention that emphasizes differences risks losing sight of the\ncontinuity of the phenomena (for criticisms of these deflationary\nideas about the differences between the various phases of the\nactivity from intending to doing, see Yaffe 2010; Paul 2014).\n",
