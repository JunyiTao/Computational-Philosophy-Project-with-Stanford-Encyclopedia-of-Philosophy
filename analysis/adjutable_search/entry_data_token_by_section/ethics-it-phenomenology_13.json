    "main_text": "Phenomenology, Ethics and Information Technology: The Case of Virtuality\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this entry is to provide the reader with a sense of the\nphenomenological approach to information technology and its social and\nethical implications by contrasting it with two other approaches. It\nmight be useful to summarize our discussion in the Table below.\nObviously such a summary must be seen within the context of the whole\nentry and will be subject to the normal problems of such summative\nstatements, namely that they do not always do justice to the ideas so\nsummarized. Nevertheless, as a general guide it might help to further\nclarify some of the contrasts that the entry tried to suggest as\nuseful in understanding the distinctiveness of the phenomenological\napproach.\n\n\nArtifact / tool Approach \n\n\nView of technology / society relationship\nTechnologies are tools that society\ndraws upon to do certain things it would not otherwise be able to do.\nWhen tools become incorporated in practices it tends to have a more or\nless determinable impact on those practices. \n\nApproach to ethical implications of technology\nThe task of ethics is to analyze the\nimpact of technology on practices by applying existing or new moral\ntheories to construct guidelines or policies that will\n\u2018correct\u2019 the injustices or infringements of rights caused\nby the implementation and use of the particular technology. \n\n\n\nSocial Constructivist Approach \n\nView of technology / society relationship\nTechnology and society co-construct\neach other from the start. There is an ongoing interplay between the\nsocial practices and the technological artifacts (both in its design\nand in its use). This ongoing interplay means that technological\nartifacts and human practices become embedded in a multiplicity of\nways that are mostly not determinable in any significant way.\n\n\nApproach to ethical implications of technology\nThe task of ethics if to be actively\ninvolved in disclosing the assumptions, values and interests being\n\u2018built into\u2019 the design, implementation and use of the\ntechnology. The task of ethics is not to prescribe policies or\ncorrective action as such but to continue to open the \u2018black\nbox\u2019 for scrutiny and ethical consideration and\ndeliberation. \n\n\n\nPhenomenological Approach\n\n\nView of technology / society relationship\nTechnology and society co-constitute\neach other from the start. They are each other\u2019s condition of\npossibility to be. Technology is not the artifact alone it is also the\ntechnological attitude or disposition that made the artifact appear as\nmeaningful and necessary in the first instance. However, once in\nexistence artifacts and the disposition that made them meaningful also\ndiscloses the world beyond the mere presence of the artifacts.\n\n\nApproach to ethical implications of technology\nThe task of ethics is ontological\ndisclosure. To open up and reveal the conditions of possibility that\nmake particular technologies show up as meaningful and necessary (and\nothers not). It seeks to interrogate these constitutive conditions\n(beliefs, assumptions, attitudes, moods, practices, discourses, etc.)\nso as to problematize and question the fundamental constitutive\nsources of our ongoing being-with technology. \n\n",
