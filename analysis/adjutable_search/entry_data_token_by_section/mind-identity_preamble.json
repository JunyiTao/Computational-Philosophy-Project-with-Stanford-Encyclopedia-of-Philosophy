    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mind\nare identical to states and processes of the brain. Strictly speaking,\nit need not hold that the mind is identical to the brain. Idiomatically\nwe do use \u2018She has a good mind\u2019 and \u2018She has a good\nbrain\u2019 interchangeably but we would hardly say \u2018Her mind\nweighs fifty ounces\u2019. Here I take identifying mind and brain as\nbeing a matter of identifying processes and perhaps states of the mind\nand brain. Consider an experience of pain, or of seeing something, or\nof having a mental image. The identity theory of mind is to the effect\nthat these experiences just are brain processes, not merely\ncorrelated with brain processes. \n\n\nSome philosophers hold that though experiences are brain processes\nthey nevertheless have fundamentally non-physical, psychical,\nproperties, sometimes called \u2018qualia\u2019. Here I shall take\nthe identity theory as denying the existence of such irreducible\nnon-physical properties. Some identity theorists give a behaviouristic\nanalysis of mental states, such as beliefs and desires, but\nothers, sometimes called \u2018central state materialists\u2019, say\nthat mental states are actual brain states. Identity theorists often\ndescribe themselves as \u2018materialists\u2019 but\n\u2018physicalists\u2019 may be a better word. That is, one might be\na materialist about mind but nevertheless hold that there are entities\nreferred to in physics that are not happily described as\n\u2018material\u2019.\n\n\nIn taking the identity theory (in its various forms) as a species of\nphysicalism, I should say that this is an ontological, not a\ntranslational physicalism. It would be absurd to try to translate\nsentences containing the word \u2018brain\u2019 or the word\n\u2018sensation\u2019 into sentences about electrons, protons and so\non. Nor can we so translate sentences containing the word\n\u2018tree\u2019. After all \u2018tree\u2019 is largely learned\nostensively, and is not even part of botanical classification. If we\nwere small enough a dandelion might count as a tree. Nevertheless a\nphysicalist could say that trees are complicated physical mechanisms.\nThe physicalist will deny strong emergence in the sense of some\nphilosophers, such as Samuel Alexander and possibly C.D. Broad. The\nlatter remarked (Broad 1937) that as far as was known at that time the\nproperties of common salt cannot be deduced from the properties of\nsodium in isolation and of chlorine in isolation. (He put it too\nepistemologically: chaos theory shows that even in a deterministic\ntheory physical consequences can outrun predictability.) Of course the\nphysicalist will not deny the harmless sense of \"emergence\" in which an\napparatus is not just a jumble of its parts (Smart 1981).\n",
