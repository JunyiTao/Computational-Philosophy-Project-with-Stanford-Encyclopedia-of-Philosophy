    "main_text": "Human Knowledge and Creation || The Structure and Content of Human Thought\n3.1 The Structure and Content of Human Thought\n\nQuestions about the form and content of human thought occupied the\nphilosophers of the early modern period. One helpful way to draw the\nline between the empiricists and the rationalists of this time period\nis along issues concerning human cognition. Norris believes the object\nof thought is always God and the structure of thought facilitates\nobjective, indubitable knowledge. For these reasons, he belongs\nsquarely in the rationalist camp.\n\nNorris espouses a Cartesian theory of human thought, which he\ndelineates in Theory II and Reason and Religion.\nNorris says that all thought exhibits a certain structure \u2013\nformal thought, which is the act of thinking, and objective thought,\nwhich is the object of the thinking. Like Descartes, Norris claims all\nthought is about some thing. Formal thought is always the same,\nwhether we are perceiving or \u201cwilling, desiring, loving, hating,\nhoping, fearing\u2026even sensation it self\u201d\n(Theory II 109). Thoughts differ based upon content. Like\nMalebranche and unlike Descartes, the object of thought is always God,\nand \u201c\u2019tis the diversity of this Ideal Object that makes all the\ndiversity and distinction that is to be found in our Thought, whether\nNatural or Moral\u201d (113). God\u2019s omniform essence is always the\ncontent of perception, intellection and passion. Indeed, all knowledge\nis always of God qua divine ideas. When perceiving the ideas,\nwe are viewing \u201cthe very same Divine Nature it self, as\n\u2018tis variously imitable or Participable ad extra,\naccording to such or such intelligible Degrees of Being or\nPerfection\u201d (Theory I 294). Hence, the sole object of\nour perceptions, both intellectual and sensory, is God. When humans\nthink, we think and conduct proofs in mental propositions, but \u201c\nto Speak exactly \u2018tis not the mental Proposition that it [our\nthought] demonstrates, but \u2018tis the mental Proposition\nthat demonstrates the real. The former belonging to the Act, as the\nlatter does to the Object of Science\u201d (311, brackets added). Our\nthoughts are always about the ideal propositions, constituted by the\ndivine ideas as they are related to one another.\n\nWhen we think in propositions, we usually think directly; direct\nthinking is everyday cognition such as knowing to proceed at green\nlights or knowing dentists\u2019 chairs are frightening. All humanity\nthinks directly, or in these ordinary ways, but some persons engage in\nreflexive thought, or about the mind itself and its contents. In\nreflexive thought, there is a return of the mind onto itself, or an\nattending to the contents of the mind; such reflexive thoughts are\nmore attentive perceptions of the divine ideas, and these thoughts are\ncontemplations of the eternal truths. Norris states along with Locke\n(Essay 4.3.2) that knowledge is perceiving \u201cthose\nRelations of agreement or disagreement that are between Ideas, which\nwhoever clearly and rightly perceives, is truly said to\nknow\u201d (Theory II 147\u2013148). Knowledge of\nthe eternal truths, of course, is the highest grade of knowledge, or\nscientia. By engaging in reflexive thought, we can align our\nmental propositions with the ideal ones. The ultimate intellectual\ngoal is this alignment of our thought with the eternal truths.\n\nNorris adopts the Malebranchean doctrine of Vision in God, which\nstates that all intellectual and sensory perception is perception of\nGod. Norris significantly augments neither Malebranche\u2019s account nor\nargument for Vision in God with respect to sensory perception. Norris\nlimits himself to reproducing Malebranche\u2019s eliminative argument from\nthe Search after Truth for why our sensory perception must be\nof ideas in God. The eliminative argument is found in chapters VII\nthrough XI in Theory II. Yet Norris does offer a more\ndetailed account of abstract thought (which is an intellectual\nperception of God) than does Malebranche. Norris meticulously conveys\nhow we come to have knowledge of the essences of created things. God\nis revealed through degrees of being (i.e. divine ideas), such as the\ndegrees of being exhibited by bodies and minds, and we can come to\nknow their essences by attending carefully to our perceptions of\ndivine ideas. Careful attention requires thinking abstractly for\nNorris, and Norris offers us a definition of abstraction:\n\nSo that in short, Abstraction, as \u2018tis a logical Affection of\nThought, is the considering one thing without another, not\nabsolutely, but in things that are not really one without the\nother, nor yet really deniable one of the other. For Abstraction is,\nas it were, the drawing away of a thing from it self. But where things\nare really separate or distinct, the considering them apart is not\nAbstraction, but only mere divided Consideration. (Theory\nII 174)\n\n\nAbstraction serves to make the intellect\u2019s \u201cView of things more\nclear and distinct. As Spectacles, tho\u2019 in him that uses them they\nargue weakness of Sight, yet when used they do very much assist the\nAct of Vision\u201d (176\u2013177). Abstraction is the key to\nunderstanding how we come to know about minds and bodies. When\nconsidering the ideas of body, we understand that\n\n...one and the same Substance, may have different Modes or Manners of\nbeing in itself, As the same Body may have Motion and Figure,\nor else different Figures\u2026For tho\u2019 there be a real Identity\nbetween Modes and the thing modefied, yet as Figure suppose may be\nconsider\u2019d without Body, so Body may be consider\u2019d without its Figure,\nor sometimes as having this Figure, sometimes as having that, just as\nit is in Dimensions. (22)\n\n\nThis sort of abstraction Norris calls \u201cmodal abstraction.\u201d\nSince we cannot imagine a body without some shape and some dimensions,\nshape and dimensions are determinables, or modes, of extension. Shape\nis not an independently existing thing, but is always a modification\nof an independently existing thing. Since Norris holds that our clear\nand distinct mental propositions track ideal propositions, we can\nconclude that shape and dimensions are not substances, but modes.\nModal abstraction turns out to underscore Norris\u2019 rehearsal of real\ndistinction. His account is noteworthy because it offers an\nalternative understanding of the real distinction proof. When we are\ncertain that the two items under consideration are not distinct by\nmodal abstraction, we can be sure the two items are really\ndistinct.\n",
