    "main_text": "False Statement || Negative Predication\n6.3 Negative Predication\n\n\nThe statements the Stranger considers, \u201cMan learns,\u201d \n\u201cTheaetetus is sitting,\u201d and \u201cTheaetetus is \nflying,\u201d are all positive predications, the first two true, the\nthird false. But as noted above (\u00a7 5.5), we need negative \npredication to analyze the false statement, \u201cTheaetetus is \nflying.\u201d Since the statement is false, the statement \n\u201cTheaetetus is not flying\u201d is true.\n\n\nNegative predication has received considerable attention in the\nscholarly literature on the Sophist (for helpful accounts of\nthe various interpretations, and their advantages and disadvantages,\nsee Keyt 1973 and Crivelli 2012). Some scholars think that Plato needs\na second notion of negation in addition to difference (understood as\ndistinctness or non-identity), such as incompatibility, to accommodate\nnegative predication. On this view, flying is incompatible with one of\nTheaetetus\u2019 properties (namely sitting). The incompatibility\ninterpretation requires Plato to change the meaning of\nheteron from \u201cdifferent\u201d to\n\u201cincompatible,\u201d and there is no evidence in the text that\nhe does. The Oxford interpretation (mentioned above \u00a7 6.1) has\nthe advantage of keeping a single meaning for heteron but\ncalls for universal quantification over properties: to analyze the\nstatement \u201cTheaetetus is not flying,\u201d one must show that\nflying is different from everything that Theaetetus is\u2014a man,\nsnub-nosed, sitting, and so on. The Sophist does not provide\nevidence of such an approach (see Wiggins 1971; Bostock 1984, 113;\nWhite 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11).\n\n\nIf Plato construes difference as a structural kind that operates in\nthe way we have discussed (the incompatibility range interpretation),\nhe can handle negative predication without introducing a second\nmeaning of heteron. We need not consider all of Theaetetus\u2019\nproperties to explain the falsehood of \u201cTheaetetus is\nflying.\u201d The analysis of negative predication is complex: the\nitem negated in \u201cSimmias is not large\u201d indicates a\ndivision of the genus size, and the negation designates something\ndifferent (non-identical, distinct) from largeness within that\ngenus. In the case of Theaetetus\u2019 imagined flight, we must find\nthat activity different from flying within the relevant\nincompatibility set, a set apparently consisting of our pair of\nconsonant forms: change/rest. Since Theaetetus is currently sitting (a\nspecies of rest), his current rest excludes flying (a species of\nchange). One can explain his not flying by appeal to his sitting.\n",
