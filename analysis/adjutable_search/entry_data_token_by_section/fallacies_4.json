    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Locke\n2.4 Locke\n\nIt is John Locke who is credited with intentionally creating a class\nof ad-arguments, and inadvertently giving birth to the class\nof ad-fallacies. In An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1690), he identified three kinds of arguments, the\nad verecundiam, ad ignorantiam, and ad\nhominem arguments, each of which he contrasted with ad\njudicium arguments which are arguments based on \u201cthe\nfoundations of knowledge and probability\u201d and are reliable\nroutes to truth and knowledge. Locke did not speak of\nad-arguments as fallacies\u2014that was left to others to do\nlater\u2014but rather as kinds of arguments \u201cthat men, in their\nreasoning with others, do ordinarily make use of to prevail on their\nassent; or at least so to awe them as to silence their\nopposition.\u201d (Bk IV, xvii, 19\u201322).\n\nTwo of the ad arguments have developed beyond how Locke\noriginally conceived them. His characterization of the ad\nverecundiam is considered the locus classicus of\nappeal-to-authority arguments. When it is a fallacy it is either on\nthe ground that authorities (experts) are fallible or for the reason\nthat appealing to authority is an abandonment of an individual\u2019s\nepistemic responsibility. It seems unlikely, however, that Locke\nthought we should never rely on the expertise and superior knowledge\nof others when engaged in knowledge-gathering and argumentation. This\nleads us to consider what kind of authority Locke might have had in\nmind. In addition to epistemic and legal (command) authority there is\nalso what might be called social authority, demanding respect and\ndeference from others due to one\u2019s higher social standing,\nsomething much more a part of seventeenth-century society than it is a\npart of ours. The language that Locke used in connection with the\nad verecundiam, words like \u2018eminency\u2019,\n\u2018dignity\u2019, \u2018breach of modesty\u2019, and\n\u2018having too much pride\u2019 suggests that what he had in mind\nwas the kind of authority that demands respect for the social standing\nof sources rather than for their expertise; hence, by this kind of\nauthority a person could be led to accept a conclusion because of\ntheir modesty or shame, more so than for the value of the argument\n(see Goodwin 1998, Hansen 2006). Hence, we understand Locke better\nwhen we translate ad verecundiam literally, as \u201cappeal\nto modesty.\u201d\n\nThe argumentum ad hominem, as Locke defined it, has\nsubsequently developed into three different fallacies. His original\ndescription was that it was a way \u201cto press a man with\nconsequences drawn from his own principles or concessions.\u201d That\nis, to argue that an opponent\u2019s view is inconsistent, logically\nor pragmatically, with other things he has said or to which he is\ncommitted. Locke\u2019s observation was that such arguments do not\nadvance us towards truth, but that they can serve to promote agreement\nor stall disagreement. To argue that way is not a fallacy but an\nacceptable mode of argumentation. Henry Johnstone (1952) thought it\ncaptured the essential character of philosophical argumentation. The\nmodern descendants of the Lockean ad hominem are the abusive\nad hominem which is an argument to the effect that a position\nshould not be accepted because of some telling negative property of\nits espouser; the circumstantial ad hominem, an argument to\nthe effect that someone\u2019s position should be rejected because\ncircumstances suggest that their view is the result of self-interested\nbias; and finally, the tu quoque ad hominem argument which\nattempts to deflect a criticism by pointing out that it applies\nequally to the accuser. Recent scholarship suggests that these\npost-Lockean kinds of ad hominem arguments are sometimes used\nfairly, and sometimes fallaciously; but none of them is what Locke\ndescribed as the argumentum ad hominem.\n\nAd ignorantiam translates as \u201cappeal to\nignorance.\u201d Locke\u2019s characterization of this kind of\nargument is that it demands \u201cthe adversary to admit what they\nallege as a proof, or to assign a better.\u201d The ignorance in\nquestion is comparative, it is not that the opponent has no evidence,\nit is that s/he has no better evidence. However, the inability of an\nopponent to produce a better argument is not sufficient reason to\nthink the proponent\u2019s argument must be accepted. Modern versions\nof this kind of argument take it as a fallacy to infer a proposition\nto be true because there is no evidence against it (see Krabbe,\n1995).\n\nThe introduction and discussion of the ad-arguments appears\nalmost as an afterthought in Locke\u2019s Essay. It is found\nat the end of the chapter, \u201cOf Reason,\u201d in which Locke\ndevotes considerable effort to criticizing syllogistic logic.\nReasoning by syllogisms, he maintained, was neither necessary nor\nuseful for knowledge. Locke clearly thought that the three\nad-arguments were inferior to ad judicium arguments,\nbut he never used the term \u2018fallacy\u2019 in connection with\nthem, although he did use it in connection with errors of syllogistic\nreasoning.\n\nWas Locke the first to discuss these kinds of arguments? Hamblin\n(1970, 161\u201362) and Nuchelmans (1993) trace the idea of ad\nhominem arguments back to Aristotle, and Locke\u2019s remark\nthat the name argumentum ad hominem was already known has\nbeen investigated by Finocchiaro (1974) who finds the term and the\nargument kind in Galileo\u2019s writings more than a half-century\nbefore the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. And Arnauld\nand Nicole\u2019s discussion of the sophism of authority, that\n\u201cpeople speak the truth because they are of noble birth or\nwealthy or in high office,\u201d which seems to be part of\nLocke\u2019s ad verecundiam, was most likely known to him.\nSubsequently more ad-arguments were added to the four that\nLocke identified (see Watts, and Copi, below).\n",
