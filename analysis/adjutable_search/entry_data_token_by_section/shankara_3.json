    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Appearance of the Universe\n2.2 The Appearance of the Universe\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s philosophy is perhaps most infamous for\nundermining the reality of the universe and its ultimate value. His\nphilosophical adversaries pejoratively labeled him a\nm\u0101y\u0101v\u0101din\u2014\u201cone who argues the\nworld is illusory (m\u0101y\u0101)\u201d. While this epithet\nis not exactly incorrect, it misrepresents his intention as centered\non world negation, and ignores the fact that he infrequently uses the\nterm \u201cm\u0101y\u0101\u201d (see Hacker 1995 on his use\nof this term). \u015aa\u1e45kara places great emphasis on moral\nvirtues and acting for the good of the world (see BhGBh ch.3 for\nexample and\n \u00a74.1\n below). Furthermore, the world is a pedagogical necessity as the\ninstrumental means to discover nonduality (on this, see Suthren Hirst\n2005). His goal is not to negate the axiological value of the world\nand intersubjective life (see Rambachan 2006 for a development of this\npoint). Rather, his focus is simply brahman. The world is a\ndependent effect of brahman and therefore not other than\nbrahman, and brahman is not a cosmogonic\nconstruction. This metaphysical view possesses epistemic value for\nliberation, along with is positive psychological byproducts such as\ncessation of suffering and the deepest happiness.\n\nGiven \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s absolute nonduality, how can he\nexplain the world\u2019s emergence in the first place? Later\nAdvaitins developed cosmogonic defenses to neutralize philosophical\nrivals, including theories of m\u0101y\u0101 as a creative\nmaterial cause equated with beginningless ignorance. Whether or not we\ncan accurately read such theories into \u015aa\u1e45kara is contested\nby academic and traditional scholars (see Comans 2000: 263\u20137;\nDoherty 2005; and Satchidanandendra 1964 [1989]). The more pertinent\npoint though is that \u015aa\u1e45kara does not require a definitive\ncosmogonic story of world causation for his philosophical goal of\nknowing brahman. He employs cosmologies as models that map\nthe empirical order in order to point back obliquely to nonduality as\nalready present as one\u2019s most primitive self-existence. These\nmodels may be dropped after serving their purpose (see, e.g., GKBh\n4.4.2; BrS\u016bBh 3.2.21, 2.1.27, and 4.3.14). Furthermore, an\nairtight philosophical causal account for a less-than-real world is\nnot possible. One strength of his position is a remarkable flexibility\nin accommodating contemporary scientific cosmologies. It is more\naccurate to read \u015aa\u1e45kara as ambivalent towards the world.\nHis approach is analogous to a dream character attempting to discover\nthe waking ground of their dreamscape. Analyzing the dream\u2019s\ncausation and illusoriness may be part of a method, but is not the\ngoal. The dream\u2019s illusoriness is only seen upon awakening and\nrecognizing the dream\u2019s waking foundation.\n\nStill, the empirical universe presents an ontological difficulty for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara because he is an epistemic realist. He accepts that\nexternal objects are not individual subjective illusions because we\nperceive these effects with intersubjective agreement. The world is\nthus independent of mind and not wholly unreal. One may therefore\nargue that he contradicts himself or falls into an excluded middle\n(see Fost 1998). The universe either exists or does not exist, is real\nor unreal, and cannot be both simultaneously. His solution is to argue\nfor a third ontological space\u2014that the universe is an objective\nbut less-than-real appearance. This appearance, akin to a magic trick,\nis m\u0101y\u0101. All objects are unreal in that they are\ntransient and dependent; yet are not non-existent like the horn of a\nhare or self-contradictory like a square circle. His understanding of\nwhat is unreal as a less-than-real appearance does not contradict what\nis real. The universe of names and forms holds a unique ontological\nposition as indeterminable (anirvacan\u012bya) as\nbrahman or something else other than brahman\n(BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14, 2.1.17; GK 2.34; see Comans 2000: 239\u2013246\non indeterminability). It is not identical to brahman (even\nthough reducible to brahman), but is not different\neither\u2014it does not constitute a second reality. One may thus\nview m\u0101y\u0101 as a postulate by elimination to account\nfor the world\u2019s ontological inexplicability, intended to direct\none toward the unity of reality. In \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s final\nphilosophical position, there is only brahman without parts,\nattributes, or causation.\n",
