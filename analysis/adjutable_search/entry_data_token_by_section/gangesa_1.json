    "main_text": "Categories of possible referent in causal relationship\n2. Categories of possible referent in causal relationship\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s central focus is epistemology, not ontology\nor metaphysics, but his analyses rely on a centuries-old ontological\nsystem. In all four chapters of the Jewel, he addresses\nontological issues, especially the topics of universals and of the\nontological relation of qualification that is reflected in knowledge\nof something as qualified by a qualifier, \u201cThat\u2019s a\ncow,\u201d for instance, which would be an instance of knowledge of\nsomething qualified by the universal being-a-cow.\n\nThe system that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba takes over is inherited in\nparticular from his \u201cteacher\u201d Udayana. In a dozen\ntreatises, Udayana merges the separate literature and worldview of\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika\u2014its advocates sometimes called\n\u201cAtomists\u201d \u2014with Ny\u0101ya\u2019s. Udayana also\nadded the category of absence to the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra\u2019s six, so that there\nare seven basic types of things possibly referred to in technical\nworks as in everyday life:\n\nSubstance: four atomic substances, earth, water, fire, and air\natoms and their combinations; a \u201cmaterial\u201d substance that\nis non-atomic, ether, the medium of sound; time; space; mind\n(manas); self (\u0101tman)\nQuality: properties that dwell in, qualifying substances such as\ncolor, weight, shape, and so on along with relational properties such\nas conjunction\nMotion: movements such as going-up which, like qualities, dwell in\nsubstances\nUniversals: recurrent properties, and meta-properties, that\nqualify qualities, blueness, for example, and motions, going-up-hood\nas a class characteristic, as well as substances, for example,\nearthenness and mountainhood\nIndividualizers: properties inherent in individual atoms and\nselves (individualizer is not a category discussed by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba)\nInherence: ontic glue binding qualities, motions, and universals\nto the things they qualify\nAbsence: four general types admitting further subdivisions and\ninnumerable instances: prior absence (the pot the potter contemplates\nbefore producing it in the clay, with the pot as the\n\u201ccounterpositive,\u201d i.e., what is absent), destruction (for\nexample, of a pot), mutual absence (the distinction of one thing from\nanother: a pot is not a cloth), and locatable (called\n\u201cabsolute,\u201d atyant\u00e2bh\u0101va, as a\npot\u2019s not being on the floor, or as my glasses not being on my\ndesk, where the glasses are the \u201ccounterpositive\u201d and the\ndesk the locus): \u2018\\(\\neg Ha\\)\u2019 means \\(H\\) is absent at\n\\(a\\), where \u201c\\(H\\)\u201d is the counterpositive to the absence\n(an absence of all pots on a floor would have pothood as the\ncounterpositive)\n\n\nThere are also properties and entities that do not fit very well into\nthe typology. Some philosophers after Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba rework the\nsystem, but Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba himself is ontologically conservative,\npresenting arguments for its expansion in various ways without\nendorsement.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba also inherits a causal schema that is crucial to\nhis causal theory of knowledge. Perception and the other sources\ngenerate knowledge instances, in the sense of being the\n\u201cchief instrumental cause.\u201d To understand this, we have to\nknow that there are most generally three varieties of cause-effect\nrelationship:\n\nInherent, as blue in a lotus, cowhood in cows\nCo-inherent, \u201cemergent,\u201d as the color of threads\ndetermining the color of a cloth\nInstrumental, including both agential causes, such as a potter for\na pot, and non-agential, such as the stick used to turn the wheel\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, like other Naiy\u0101yikas, also works with the\ndistinction between the necessary and the sufficient, sufficient\ncausality being a whole bundle of causal conditions, including general\nones such as time and space. A source of knowledge is a process of\nknowledge generation, and each has a distinct \u201ctrigger.\u201d A\ntrigger is that instrumental cause which, when all the other causal\nconditions necessary for an effect are in place, brings it about. The\ntrigger of perceptual knowledge is said to be connection of a sensory\norgan with an object to be known. The trigger of knowledge by\ninference is said to be reflection on a property of an object as\npervaded by\u2014invariably associated with\u2014another property,\nthe former called the prover\u2014the pervaded\u2014and the latter\nthe probandum\u2014the pervader. The trigger of testimonial knowledge\nis said to be the statement of a trustworthy expert as comprehended by\nthe hearer, a trustworthy expert being defined as someone who knows\nthe truth and wants to communicate it faithfully, without lying or\ndeceiving. Causal relations are especially important because knowledge\nof the occurrence of an effect allows the knower to infer any one or\nmore of its necessary conditions, as perception of smoke rising from a\nmountain allows one to infer fire. Furthermore, recognizing a\nparticular knowledge source by its trigger is one way to certify a\nresult, an instance of testimonial knowledge for instance.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba often utilizes a simpler ontological schema in his\nanalyses of the generation of knowledge: an instance of knowledge is\nabout, at a minimum, a qualifier-qualificandum, the hyphen\nstanding for the qualificative relation, also discussed, with\nqualificanda as property-bearers, anything we can talk about,\nincluding universals and supervenient properties such as similarity,\nand qualifiers as qualities or universals or even mind-imposed\nproperties that, as suggested, do not seem to have a place in the\ntraditional layout. No matter, we can deal with these later, seems to\nbe Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s attitude, as he proceeds to focus on\nknowledge and its generators.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Ny\u0101ya embraces realism along several\ndimensions, realism in the sense of commitment to entities that exist\nindependently of consciousness. There are, however, exceptions in the\nproperties of a self along with some others that do require\nconsciousness to occur. Knowledge itself and other mental phenomena\nare counted as reals and knowable intersubjectively, for instance.\nRealism leads Naiy\u0101yikas to embrace fallibilism from very early,\nbecause the transcendence, so to say, of a physical object to the\ninstruments of knowledge is seen to mean that the possibility of error\ncannot be ruled out\u2014except in the case of apperception,\naccording to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (see below). The Jewel is\nfilled out with numerous definitional projects where the definienda\n(instances of knowledge, for example, as well as physical objects),\nare realities. And all individuals of whatever fundamental type\n(substance, quality, motion, universal, inherence, individuator, and\nabsence) are viewed as reals, although the mind can create fictions.\nAgainst Buddhist subjectivists, it is argued that the components of\nfalse and fictional awarenesses themselves indicate reals. Gold and\nmountains are real but maybe not a gold mountain. More about illusion\nand other instances of non-knowledge in practically every subsection\nbelow.\n",
