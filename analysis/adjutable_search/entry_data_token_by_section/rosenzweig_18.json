    "main_text": "Life and Thought after The Star || Translation\n4.4 Translation\n\n\nRosenzweig\u2019s most important intellectual and cultural\ncontribution during the years of his illness came in his work on\ntranslation. In the fall of 1922, his writing and speech already\nsignificantly impaired, Rosenzweig began drafting a book of\ntranslations of poems written by the medieval Jewish poet and thinker,\nJudah HaLevi. He finished the translations, together with commentaries\non each poem and an afterword outlining his views on the task of\ntranslation itself, in the first week of 1923, and the book was\npublished as Sixty Hymns and Poems of Judah HaLevi in 1924\n(an expanded edition, Ninety-two Hymns and Poems of Judah\nHaLevi, appeared in 1927). In May of 1925, Martin Buber invited\nRosenzweig to collaborate with him on a new German translation of the\nBible, and Rosenzweig devoted much of the last years of his life to\nthis project.\n\n\nIn both the \u201cAfterword\u201d to the Judah HaLevi\nbook, and in a series of articles addressing the challenges of\ntranslating Scripture, Rosenzweig articulated the theory of translation\nthat stood behind these works. According to Rosenzweig, the task of the\ntranslator was not to transform the text being translated into a form\nthat would be easily accessible to those reading it in its new\nlanguage, but rather to transform the language into which the text was\nbeing translated through this very introduction of a foreign text into\nit. Rosenzweig sought to convey precisely the unfamiliar character of\nthe original language in his translations because he saw such\ntranslation both as a means of rejuvenating the language into which the\nforeign text was translated, and\u2014more dramatically\u2014as a\nstep towards the ultimate redemptive harmonization of all\nlanguages.\n\n\nIn order to convey precisely the unfamiliar, authentic quality of\nthe original Biblical text, Rosenzweig and Buber made an effort to\nimitate certain characteristics of the original text not often attended\nto in translations seeking to convey the meaning of texts literally.\nThey attempted to reproduce the cadence of the original Biblical text,\nand to imitate what they understood to be its \u201cspoken\u201d\nquality, by dividing any given section they were translating into\n\u201cbreath-units.\u201d They paid special attention to the roots of\nthe words translated, imitating the repetition of words with common\nroots so regularly employed in the Biblical text, and often seeking to\nconvey the way such roots refer intertextually to other Biblical\npassages, as well. \n\n\nThe origins of Rosenzweig\u2019s thoughts on translating stretch back to\nthe speech-thinking he developed in the Star. In order to\nmake sense of the tremendous import with which he invests the act of\ntranslation, it is helpful to recall two aspects of that\nspeech-thinking in particular. First of all, the Star\nintroduces speech as a revelatory form of relation that unites\ndifferent individual beings\u2014divine, worldly, and\nhuman\u2014even as it secures them as individuals. In his writings on\ntranslation, Rosenzweig points back to this relational quality of\nspeech and discovers in it the very act of translation\nitself. \u201cAll speech,\u201d he writes, \u201cis\ntranslation.\u201d In every dialogue with another person, Rosenzweig\nsuggests, one engages in a miniature act of translation. Insofar as\nsuch relations contribute to my own self-realization, this very act of\ntranslating\u2014of being open to and cognizant of the words of\nsomeone \u201cforeign\u201d to me\u2014becomes an integral part of\nthe way I realize myself. The way in which the introduction of a\nforeign text into a language can enable that language to realize\nitself in new ways reproduces, then, on the level of whole languages,\nthe manner in which the individual comes to realize herself, according\nto Rosenzweig, through the act of translation involved in every\ninterpersonal exchange.\n\n\nFurthermore, insofar as the Star presents speech as part\nand parcel of the series of relations between beings that stretches,\nfor Rosenzweig, between creation and redemption, it depicts the\ndiversity of human languages as both rooted in the common capacity for\nspeech inherent in every human being from the time of her creation, and\nat once as destined to find common fulfillment in a redemptive\nuniversal language which all human beings would share. If this is the\ncase, then translation can be understood to revitalize or rejuvenate a\nlanguage, when introducing a foreign text into it, precisely because it\nthereby awakens within that language possibilities which that language\nalready has dormant within it, possibilities rooted in both the common\nground and the common future that language shares with all others.\nInsofar as translation can then be said to actualize, within each\nlanguage, an aspect of the ultimate universal language which all\nparticular languages share as their redemptive future, then translation\ncan be understood as playing a vital role in the world\u2019s advance\nto redemption which Rosenzweig projected in the Star.\n\n\nHere one should note the unique role Rosenzweig sees the Bible as\nfilling in the world\u2019s advance towards redemption. Rosenzweig\nunderstands the Bible to be that written work which, more than any\nother, has enabled human beings to hear the spoken divine word, and\nthereby has directed them towards a common, redemptive purpose in the\nworld. According to Rosenzweig, the translation of the Bible into a new\nlanguage, or for a new generation, serves to usher the people who speak\nthat language, or who are part of that generation, into this\nworld-historical advance towards redemption. Rosenzweig may thus\nunderstand his own act of translating the Bible as playing its own\nsmall part in this quest for redemption, and for the harmonization of\nall languages which would announce it.\n",
