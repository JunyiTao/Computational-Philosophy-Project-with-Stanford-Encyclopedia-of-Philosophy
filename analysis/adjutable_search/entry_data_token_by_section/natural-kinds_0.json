    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Natural Kinds\n1. The Metaphysics of Natural Kinds\n\nThe principal metaphysical questions concerning natural kinds are\nfourfold. First, are the kinds that we think of as\n\u2018natural\u2019 kinds genuinely natural? Or are our\nclassification processes more anthropocentric than that? Secondly, are\nour natural kind classifications really classifications into\nkinds? Thirdly, what are natural kinds? Are natural kinds any\nsort of entity at all? Are they basic ontological entities or are they\nderived from or reducible to other entities (e.g., universals)?\nFourthly, do natural kinds have essences?\n\nAs regards the first question, the general problem is to determine\nwhich of the kinds to which science makes appeal, if any, correspond\nto real natural kinds\u2014those existing in nature, so to\nspeak\u2014and which of these kinds are merely\nconventional\u2014those whose boundaries are fixed by us rather than\nnature. The second question builds on the first by noting that in\naddition to classifying things in a natural way, classification by\nnatural kinds, is also classification of things into kinds. What then\nis it to classify by kind? Then, if natural kinds are genuinely\nnatural and genuinely kinds, what are they? Are there entities that\nare the natural kinds, and if so what can we say about the nature of\nsuch entities? Are they irreducible, basic, sui generis\nentities (alongside, for example, particulars and universals) (Ellis\n2001; Lowe 1998)? Or can they be reduced, say to universals (Armstrong\n1978, 1997; Hawley and Bird 2011) or to clusters of properties (Boyd\n1991, Millikan 1999)? The third question asks whether there are\nproperties that might be essential for kind membership. Natural kind\nessentialists hold that natural kinds have essences (Ellis 2001, 2002;\nDevitt 2008), where the essence of a natural kind is a property or set\nof properties whose possession is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor a particular\u2019s being a member of the kind. That fact is a\nso-called essential fact concerning the kind; it is a fact that, in\nFine\u2019s terms, stems from the identity or nature of the kind\n(Fine 1994).\n\nWe can use answers to these questions to articulate the metaphysical\ncommitment of a theory of natural kinds (Bird 2018). At one extreme\nthe out-and-out conventionalist may claim that there is no natural\nsameness and difference in nature (or at least that our human\nclassifications do not capture any such natural sameness and\ndifference). Afortiori, there are no classifications into natural\nkinds, no entities that are natural kinds, and no natural\nkinds essences. At the other extreme, one might hold that there are\nnatural distinctions between things, some of these distinctions are\ndistinctions of kinds, that the natural kinds are a certain species of\nentity, that these entities are irreducible, and that they have\nessences. Intermediate views tend to be more popular. For example, a\ncommon view is that there are natural classifications by kinds, but\nthere are no entities that are the natural kinds. Some hold that view\nand accept essentialism about natural kinds, while others hold that\nview and reject essentialism.\n",
