    "main_text": "The Surprise Test Paradox\n1. The Surprise Test Paradox\n\nA teacher announces that there will be a surprise test next week. It\nwill be a surprise in that the students will not be able to know in\nadvance on which day the exam will be given. A student objects that\nthis is impossible: \u201cThe class meets on Monday, Wednesday, and\nFriday. If the test is given on Friday, then on Thursday I would be\nable to predict that the test is on Friday. It would not be a\nsurprise. Can the test be given on Wednesday? No, because on Tuesday I\nwould know that the test will not be on Friday (thanks to the previous\nreasoning) and know that the test was not on Monday (thanks to\nmemory). Therefore, on Tuesday I could foresee that the test will be\non Wednesday. A test on Wednesday would not be a surprise. Could the\nsurprise test be on Monday? On Sunday, the previous two eliminations\nwould be available to me. Consequently, I would know that the test\nmust be on Monday. So a Monday test would also fail to be a surprise.\nTherefore, it is impossible for there to be a surprise\ntest.\u201d\n\nCan the teacher fulfill her announcement? We have an embarrassment of\nriches. On the one hand, we have the student\u2019s elimination\nargument. (For a formalization, see Holliday 2017.) On the other hand,\ncommon sense says that surprise tests are possible even when we have\nhad advance warning that one will occur at some point. Either of the\nanswers would be decisive were it not for the credentials of the rival\nanswer. Thus we have a paradox. But a paradox of what kind?\n\u2018Surprise test\u2019 is being defined in terms of what can be\nknown. Specifically, a test is a surprise if and only if the student\ncannot know beforehand which day the test will occur.\nTherefore the riddle of the surprise test qualifies as an\nepistemic paradox.\n\nParadoxes are more than edifying surprises. Here is an\nedifying surprise that does not pose a paradox. Professor Statistics\nannounces she will give random quizzes: \u201cClass meets every day\nof the week. Each day I will open by rolling a die. When the roll\nyields a six, I will immediately give a quiz.\u201d Today, Monday, a\nsix came up. So you are taking a quiz. The last question of her quiz\nis: \u201cWhich of the subsequent days is most likely to be the day\nof the next random test?\u201d Most people answer that each of the\nsubsequent days has the same probability of being the next quiz. But\nthe correct answer is: Tomorrow (Tuesday).\n\nUncontroversial facts about probability reveal the mistake and\nestablish the correct answer. For the next test to be on Wednesday,\nthere would have to be a conjunction of two events: no test\non Tuesday (a 5/6 chance of that) and a test on Wednesday (a\n1/6 chance). The probability for each subsequent day becomes less and\nless. (It would be astounding if the next quiz day were a hundred days\nfrom now!) The question is not whether a six will be rolled on any\ngiven day, but when the next six will be rolled. Which day is\nthe next one depends partly on what happens meanwhile, as well as\ndepending partly on the roll of the die on that day.\n\nThis probability riddle is instructive and will be referenced\nthroughout this entry. But the existence of quick, decisive solution\nshows that only a mild revision of our prior beliefs was needed. In\ncontrast, when our deep beliefs conflict, proposed amendments\nreverberate unpredictably. Attempts to throw away a deep belief\nboomerang. For the malfunctions that ensue from distancing ourselves\nfrom the belief demonstrate its centrality. Often, the belief winds up\neven more entrenched. \u201cProblems worthy of attack prove their\nworth by fighting back\u201d (Hein 1966).\n\nOne sign of depth (or at least desperation) is that commentators begin\nrejecting highly credible inference rules. The surprise test has been\nclaimed to invalidate the law of bivalence, the KK principle (if one\nis in a position to know that \\(p\\), then one is also in\na position to know that one knows that \\(p\\)), and the\nclosure principle (if one knows \\(p\\) while also competently deducing q\nfrom \\(p\\), one knows \\(q\\)) (Immerman 2017).\n\nThe surprise test paradox also has ties to issues that are not clearly\nparadoxes \u2013 or to issues whose status as paradoxes is at least\ncontested. Consider the Monty Hall problem. There is a prize behind\nexactly one of three doors. After you pick, Monty Hall will reveal\nwhat is behind one of the doors that lacks the prize. He will then\ngive you an option to switch your choice to another closed door.\nShould you switch to have the best chance to win the prize? When Marylin vos Savant answered yes in a 1990\nParade magazine she was mistakenly scolded by many readers\n\u2014 including some scholars. The correct solution was provided by\nthe original poser of the puzzle decades earlier and was never\nforgotten or effectively criticized. \n\nWhat makes the Monty Hall Problem interesting is that it is not\na paradox. There has always been expert consensus on its\nsolution. Yet it has many of the psychological and sociological features\nof a paradox. The Monty Hall Problem is merely a cognitive\nillusion. Paradox status is also withheld by those who find only\nirony in self-defeating predictions and only an\nembarrassment in the \u201cknowability paradox\u201d\n(discussed below). Calling a problem a \u2018paradox\u2019 tends to quarantine\nit from the rest of our inquiries. Those who wish to rely on the\nsurprising result will therefore deny that there is any paradox. At\nmost, they concede there was a paradox. Dead paradoxes are\nbenign fertilizer for the tree of knowledge.\n\nWe can look forward to future philosophers drawing edifying historical\nconnections. The backward elimination argument underlying the surprise\ntest paradox can be discerned in German folktales dating back to 1756\n(Sorensen 2003a, 267). Perhaps, medieval scholars explored these\nslippery slopes. But let us turn to commentary to which we presently\nhave access.\n",
