    "main_text": "Criticisms of Experimental Moral Philosophy || Problems with Experimental Design and Interpretation\n5.2 Philosophical Problems\n\nOne might object that the real problem with experimental moral\nphilosophy is not with science, but with its relevance (or more\nprecisely, its irrelevance) to moral philosophy. The objection is that\nmoral philosophy is concerned not with how we are and what we do, but\nwith how we ought to be and what we ought to do. As such, it is a\nnormative enterprise, and is unaffected by empirical results. Science\nis hard, but so is morality; if we fail to understand and live up to\nthe demands of the latter, that doesn\u2019t show a problem with our\nmoral theory but with our moral natures.\n\nExperimental philosophers can agree with this objection, up to a\npoint. No one is suggesting that we read morality directly off survey\nresults. But, to return to the point with which we began, while\nmorality is normative, it is also essentially practical. Moral theory\nis a theory about what we ought to do: a theory about how creatures\nlike us ought to conduct ourselves and interact with one another. A\nmorality completely divorced from our natures, that demanded acts\nimpossible from us, would surely be unacceptable. This is not just a\npoint about experimental philosophy; utilitarianism is sometimes\ncritiqued as making unrealistic demands of impartiality. Alongside the\nfamous proscription against deriving an ought from an\nis, we also find the dictum that ought implies can.\nThe exact extent to which morality can be demanding without being\nunrealistic is itself a philosophical question, and so experimental\nmoral philosophy works in conjunction with philosophical analysis; it\ndoes not aim to eliminate it. Exactly how the two relate to each\nother, and how empirical evidence will bear on and influence debates\nin moral theory in the future, is a contested issue, but surely\ntraditional moral theory and experimental moral philosophy have much\nto learn from one another (Doris, Machery & Stich 2017).\n\nWe need to proceed cautiously here. No one doubts that what we ought\nto do depends on how things are non-morally. For example, the moral\nclaim that a given man deserves to be punished presupposes the\nnon-moral fact that he committed the crime. It should come as no\nsurprise, then, that experimental evidence might be relevant in this\nway to morality. Whether experimental evidence is relevant to\ndiscovering the fundamental moral principles\u2014those meant to be\nput into action one way or another depending on how the world is\nnon-morally\u2014is still subject to debate.\n\nAnother version of this argument says that fundamental moral\nphilosophical principles are, if true at all, necessarily true, and\nthat empirical research can establish at best only contingent\n truths.[18]\n But if fundamental moral theories are necessary, then they are\nnecessary for creatures like us. And one thing that empirical\ninvestigation can do is to help establish what sorts of creatures we\nare. Imagination needs material to work with. When one sits in\none\u2019s armchair, imagining a hypothetical scenario, one makes a\nwhole host of assumptions about what people are like, how\npsychological processes work, and so on. These assumptions can be\nempirically well or poorly informed. It\u2019s hard to see why anyone\ncould doubt that being well informed is to be preferred. Likewise\nit\u2019s hard to see how anyone could doubt the relevance of\nexperimental evidence to better grounding our empirical assumptions,\nin this case our assumptions relevant to moral philosophy. Exactly how\nexperimental\u2014or more broadly, empirical\u2014evidence is\nrelevant, and how relevant it is, are at present hotly contested\nmatters.\n",
