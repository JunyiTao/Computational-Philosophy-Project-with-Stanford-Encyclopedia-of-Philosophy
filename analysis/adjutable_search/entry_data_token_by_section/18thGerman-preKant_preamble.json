    "main_text": "\n\nKant undoubtedly casts a long shadow in the history of eighteenth\ncentury German philosophy. Not only did he initiate a revolution in\nphilosophy, but in the course of doing so he thoroughly exposed the\nmetaphysical systems of his predecessors as rationalistic castles in\nthe air. This latter, negative part of his project was in fact so\nsuccessful that the pre-Kantian period of German philosophy is widely\nviewed, even today, as a period of benighted dogmatism. During this\ntime, German philosophy, such as it was, is thought to be preoccupied\nwith the sort of dry scholasticism and hidebound metaphysics that had\nlong since been superseded in Britain and France, a circumstance\nreflected in the fact that nearly all intellectuals of note were\nuniversity professors\u2014male, of course, as women could not attend\nuniversity\u2014who published lengthy academic tomes (and even\nlectured) in Latin rather than the vernacular. Indeed, isolated from\nthe rest of Europe by enduring confessional tensions and the\nconvolutions of internal politics, the German-speaking lands that\nconstituted the Holy Roman Empire might seem like a sort of\nintellectual island, a bulwark against the advance of modern\nphilosophical innovations and a place from which few ideas of note\never emanated, not, that is, until the advent of the Kantian\nphilosophy.\n\nYet quite to the contrary of the whiggish philosophical histories\nKant\u2019s success inspired (and continues to inspire), the\nGerman-speaking lands of Europe in the period before Kant were host to\na rich intellectual milieu. It was of course the homeland of\nLeibniz, whose contributions to the flourishing of intellectual\nculture include his sparse publications but also his fruitful efforts\nto found a German learned society and his support of forward-thinking\nphilosophers for university positions, thereby accelerating\nGermany\u2019s transition into the era of Enlightenment. German\nacademic philosophers were thoroughly influenced by Leibniz\u2019s\nthought, but their creative appropriations of it resulted in\ninnovations such as the invention of the disciplines of aesthetics and\nempirical psychology. Germany was also the site of vigorous and\npublicly-enacted intellectual disputes, such as that at the new\nuniversity in Halle where the libertas philosophandi itself\ncame under threat but was ultimately (if not immediately) vindicated.\nOutside of the academic context, radical philosophical thinking\ncirculated underground in clandestine texts that linked Germany with\nthe current of ideas flowing through the rest of Europe and Britain.\nIt was, moreover, a period in the history of philosophy in which women\nand other under-represented thinkers contributed in integral ways to\nthe conception, propagation, and refinement of modern ideas and to the\nexpansion of the Enlightenment. In short, this is a vibrant period in\nthe history of philosophy that is eminently worthy of study, even\napart from its relation\u2014whether as a foil or as a\ncrucible\u2014to the great philosopher of K\u00f6nigsberg.\n",
