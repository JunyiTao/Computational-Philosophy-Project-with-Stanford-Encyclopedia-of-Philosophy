    "main_text": "The impact of information technology on privacy || Social media\n2.3 Social media\n\nSocial media pose additional challenges. The question is not merely\nabout the moral reasons for limiting access to information, it is also\nabout the moral reasons for limiting the invitations to users\nto submit all kinds of personal information. Social network sites\ninvite the user to generate more data, to increase the value of the\nsite (\u201cyour profile is \u2026% complete\u201d). Users are\ntempted to exchange their personal data for the benefits of\nusing services, and provide both this data and their attention as\npayment for the services. In addition, users may not even be aware of\nwhat information they are tempted to provide, as in the aforementioned\ncase of the \u201clike\u201d-button on other sites. Merely limiting\nthe access to personal information does not do justice to the issues\nhere, and the more fundamental question lies in steering the users\u2019\nbehaviour of sharing. When the service is free, the data is needed as a form of payment.\n\nOne way of limiting the temptation of users to share is requiring\ndefault privacy settings to be strict. Even then, this limits access\nfor other users (\u201cfriends of friends\u201d), but it does not\nlimit access for the service provider. Also, such restrictions limit\nthe value and usability of the social network sites themselves, and\nmay reduce positive effects of such services. A particular example of\nprivacy-friendly defaults is the opt-in as opposed to the opt-out\napproach. When the user has to take an explicit action to share data\nor to subscribe to a service or mailing list, the resulting effects\nmay be more acceptable to the user. However, much still depends on how\nthe choice is framed (Bellman, Johnson, & Lohse 2001).\n",
