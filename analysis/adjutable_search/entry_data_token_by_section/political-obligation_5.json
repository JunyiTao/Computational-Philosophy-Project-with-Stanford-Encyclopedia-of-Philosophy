    "main_text": "Political Obligation in Historical Perspective || Kant on Legitimacy and Obligation\n1.5 Kant on Legitimacy and Obligation\n\nIn contrast to utilitarianism, the practical philosophy of the\neighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant plays a major part\nin contemporary debates about political obligation. The proper\ndirection of his influence, however, is not altogether settled. On the\none hand, a leading \u201cphilosophical anarchist,\u201d Robert Paul\nWolff, claims Kantian inspiration for his a priori rejection of the\npossibility of political obligation (see \u00a73.1, below); on the\nother hand, important exponents of the \u201cnatural duty\u201d\napproach to the obligation to obey the law also claim to derive their\narguments from Kant (see \u00a74.4, below). Kant may bear some\nresponsibility for fostering these divergent responses, but it is safe\nto say that he himself was no anarchist, not even of the\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d sort. Indeed, he seems to insist on an\nunqualified obligation to obey the law that goes well beyond what any\npolitical philosopher nowadays will countenance.\n\nKant\u2019s theory employs the same basic concepts as Hobbes\u2019s\nand Locke\u2019s \u2013 natural (or innate) rights, the state of\nnature, and the social contract \u2013 but he puts them to different\nuse. In contrast to Hobbes, Kant looks upon the coercive force of the\nlaw not as a limitation on freedom but as the means of securing and\nextending it. In the state of nature, as he conceives of it,\nindividuals may enjoy \u201cwild, lawless freedom,\u201d but the\nthreats and constraints imposed by others prevent them from freely\nacting on their choices (1991 [1797], p. 127). Justified coercion\nunder law provides a remedy by impeding those who would interfere with\none\u2019s actions, thereby hindering the hindrances to freedom\n(Ripstein 2009, pp. 54\u201355 et passim). Moreover, unlike\nLocke\u2019s justification of the social contract as the way to\nsecure one\u2019s property and escape the\n\u201cinconveniencies\u201d of the state of nature, Kant takes the\n\u201ccivil condition\u201d produced by the social contract to be\nthe foundation that property rights and justice in general presuppose.\nThe social contract is thus not a matter of collective consent but a\nmoral imperative: \u201cWhen you cannot avoid living side by side\nwith all others, you ought to leave the state of nature and proceed\nwith them into a rightful condition, that is, a condition of\ndistributive justice\u201d (1991, pp. 121\u201322). \u201cProperly\nspeaking,\u201d Kant declares, the original contract is not an\nexpression of consent to be governed; it is \u201cthe Idea of this\nact, in terms of which alone we can think of the legitimacy of a\nstate\u201d (1991, p. 127).\n\nThe upshot, as noted above, is that everyone seems to have an absolute\nobligation to obey the laws of whoever is in authority; for even if\nthe ruler \u201cproceeds contrary to law \u2026 subjects may indeed\noppose this injustice by complaints \u2026 but not by\nresistance\u201d (1991, p. 130, emphasis in original; also pp.\n176\u201377). Kant\u2019s comments on this point are not\nunqualified, though. Among other things, he states that \u201cthe\nspirit of the original contract \u2026 involves an\nobligation on the part of the constituting authority to make the\nkind of government suited to the Idea of the original\ncontract\u201d; and he immediately adds that \u201cthe only\nconstitution that accords with right\u201d is \u201cthat of a pure\nrepublic\u201d \u2013 that is, \u201cthe constitution in which\nlaw itself rules and depends on no particular person\u201d\n(1991, p. 148, emphasis in original; for further discussion, see\nRipstein 2009, chap. 11). In any case, it is not so much Kant\u2019s\nconclusions as the foundations of his theory that have proved so\nimportant to contemporary discussions of political obligation.\n",
