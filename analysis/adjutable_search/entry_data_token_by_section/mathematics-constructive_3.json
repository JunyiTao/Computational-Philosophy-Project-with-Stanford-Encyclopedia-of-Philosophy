Brouwer\n (1881\u20131966), beginning with his Amsterdam doctoral thesis,\nBrouwer [1907], and continuing over the next forty-seven years, that\nthe foundations of a precise, systematic approach to constructive\nmathematics were laid. In Brouwer\u2019s philosophy, known as\n intuitionism,\n mathematics is a free creation of the human mind, and an object\nexists if and only if it can be (mentally) constructed. If one takes\nthat philosophical stance, then one is inexorably drawn to the\nforegoing constructive interpretation of the logical connectives and\nquantifiers: for how could a proof of the impossibility of the\nnon-existence of a certain object \\(x\\) describe a mental construction\nof \\(x\\)?\n\nBrouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, as is shown by\nthe following quotation:\n\nMathematics arises when the subject of two-ness, which results from\nthe passage of time, is abstracted from all special occurrences. The\nremaining empty form [the relation of \\(n\\) to \\(n+1\\)] of the common\ncontent of all these two-nesses becomes the original intuition of\nmathematics and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical\nsubjects. (quoted in Kline [1972], 1199\u20132000)\n\n\nA modern version of Brouwer\u2019s view was given by Errett Bishop\n(Bishop [1967], p. 2): \n\nThe primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means the\npositive integers. We feel about number the way Kant felt about space.\nThe positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed by the very\nnature of our intelligence and, we are tempted to believe, by the very\nnature of intelligence in general. The development of the positive\nintegers from the primitive concept of the unit, the concept of\nadjoining a unit, and the process of mathematical induction carries\ncomplete conviction. In the words of Kronecker, the positive integers\nwere created by God.\n\n\nHowever obscure Brouwer\u2019s writings could be, one thing was\nalways clear: for him, mathematics took precedence over logic. One\nmight say, as Hermann Weyl did in the following passage, that Brouwer\nsaw classical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical\nlogic without reference to the underlying mathematics: \n\nAccording to [Brouwer\u2019s] view and reading of history, classical\nlogic was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their\nsubsets. \u2026 Forgetful of this limited origin, one afterwards\nmistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics,\nand finally applied it, without justification, to the mathematics of\ninfinite sets. This is the Fall and original sin of set theory, for\nwhich it is justly punished by the antinomies. It is not that such\ncontradictions showed up that is surprising, but that they showed up\nat such a late stage of the game. (Weyl [1946])\n\n\nIn particular, this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence\nproofs which, in Weyl\u2019s words, \u201cinform the world that a\ntreasure exists without disclosing its location\u201d. \n\nIn order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist mathematician,\nit was necessary first to analyse the mathematical processes of the\nmind, from which analysis the logic could be extracted. In 1930,\nBrouwer\u2019s most famous pupil, Arend Heyting, published a set of\nformal axioms which so clearly characterise the logic used by the\nintuitionist that they have become universally known as the axioms for\n intuitionistic logic\n (Heyting [1930]). These axioms captured the informal\nBHK-interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that we gave\nearlier.\n\nIntuitionistic mathematics, INT, diverges from other types of\nconstructive mathematics in its interpretation of the term\n\u201csequence\u201d. Normally, a sequence in constructive\nmathematics is given by a rule which determines, in advance, how to\nconstruct each of its terms; such a sequence may be said to be\nlawlike or predeterminate. Brouwer generalised this\nnotion of a sequence to include the possibility of constructing the\nterms one-by-one, the choice of each term being made freely, or\nsubject only to certain restrictions stipulated in advance. Most\nmanipulations of sequences do not require that they be predeterminate,\nand can be performed on these more general free choice\nsequences.\n\nThus, for the intuitionist, a real number \\(\\bx = (x_1\n,x_2,\\ldots)\\)\u2014essentially, a Cauchy sequence of rational\nnumbers\u2014need not be given by a rule: its terms \\(x_1\n,x_2,\\ldots\\), are simply rational numbers, successively constructed,\nsubject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following\none used by Bishop [1967]: \n\\[\n\\forall m\\forall n \\left[ \\abs{x_m - x_n} \\le \\left(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nOnce free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics, so, perhaps\nto one\u2019s initial surprise, are certain strong choice principles.\nLet \\(P\\) be a subset of \\(\\bN^{\\bN} \\times \\bN\\) (where \\(\\bN\\)\ndenotes the set of natural numbers and, for sets \\(A\\) and \\(B, B^A\\)\ndenotes the set of mappings from \\(A\\) into \\(B)\\), and suppose that\nfor each \\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\) there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\) such that\n\\((\\ba,n) \\in P\\). From a constructive point of view, this means that\nwe have a procedure, applicable to sequences, that computes \\(n\\) for\nany given \\(\\ba\\). According to Brouwer, the construction of an\nelement of \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) is forever incomplete: a generic sequence\n\\(\\ba\\) is purely extensional, in the sense that at any given\nmoment we can know nothing about \\(\\ba\\) other than a finite set of\nits terms. It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate,\nfrom some finite initial sequence \\((a_0 ,\\ldots ,a_N)\\) of terms of\n\\(\\ba\\), a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\(P(\\ba,n)\\). If \\(\\bb \\in\n\\bN^{\\bN}\\) is any sequence such that \\(b_{k} = a_{k}\\) for \\(0 \\le k\n\\le N\\), then our procedure must return the same \\(n\\) for \\(\\bb\\) as\nit does for \\(\\ba\\). This means that \\(n\\) is a continuous function of\n\\(\\ba\\) with respect to the topology on \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) given by the\nmetric  \n\\[\n\\varrho : (\\ba,\\bb) \\rightsquigarrow \\inf\\{2^{-n} : a_k = b_k \n \\text{ for } 0 \\le k \\le n\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nWe are therefore led to the following principle of continuous\nchoice, which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part.\n\n\n\nCC1 : Any function from \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) to \\(\\bN\\) is continuous.\n\n\nCC2 : If \\(P \\subseteq \\bN^{\\bN} \\times \\bN\\), and for each\n\\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\) there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\) such that \\((\\ba,n)\n\\in P\\), then there is a function \\(f : \\bN^{\\bN} \\rightarrow \\bN\\)\nsuch that \\((\\ba,f(\\ba)) \\in P\\) for all \\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\).\n\n\nIf \\(P\\) and \\(f\\) are as in CC2, then we say that \\(f\\) is a\nchoice function for \\(P\\).\n\nThe omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under\nthe hypotheses CC1\u20132; but MP is consistent with it. Among the\nremarkable consequences of CC1\u20132 are the following.\n\nAny function from \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) or \\(2^{\\bN}\\) to a metric space\nis pointwise continuous.\nEvery mapping from a nonempty complete separable metric space to a\nmetric space is pointwise continuous.\nEvery map from the real line \\(\\bR\\) to itself is pointwise\ncontinuous.\nLet \\(X\\) be a complete separable normed space, \\(Y\\) a normed\nspace, and \\((u_n)\\) a sequence of linear mappings from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\)\nsuch that for each unit vector \\(x\\) of \\(X\\), \n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\sup\\{ \\Vert u_n(x)\\rVert : n \\in \\bN \\}\n\\]\n\n\nexists. Then there exists \\(c \\gt 0\\) such that \\(\\lVert u_n (x)\\rVert\n\\le c\\) for all \\(n\\in \\bN\\) and all unit vectors \\(x\\) of \\(X\\)\n(Uniform boundedness principle).\n\n\nEach of these statements appears to contradict known classical\ntheorems. However, the comparison with classical mathematics should\nnot be made superficially: in order to understand that there is no\nreal contradiction here, we must appreciate that the meaning of such\nterms as \u201cfunction\u201d and even \u201creal number\u201d in\nintuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the\nclassical setting. (In practice, intuitionistic mathematics cannot be\ncompared, readily and directly, with classical mathematics.) \n\nBrouwer\u2019s introspection over the nature of functions and the\ncontinuum led him to a second principle, which, unlike that of\ncontinuous choice, is classically valid. This principle requires a\nlittle more background for its explanation.\n\nFor any set \\(S\\) we denote by \\(S^*\\) the set of all finite sequences\nof elements of \\(S\\), including the empty sequence \\((\\ )\\). If\n\\(\\alpha = (a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) is in \\(S^*\\), then \\(n\\) is called\nthe length of \\(\\alpha\\) and is denoted by \\(\\abs{\\alpha}\\).\nIf \\(m \\in \\bN\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) is a finite or infinite sequence in\n\\(S\\) of length at least \\(m\\), then we denote by \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(m)\\)\nthe finite sequence consisting of the first \\(m\\) terms of \\(\\alpha\\).\nNote that \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(0) = (\\ )\\) and \\(\\abs{\\bar{\\alpha}(0)}\\) = 0\n. If \\(\\alpha \\in S^*\\) and \\(\\beta = \\bar{\\alpha}(m)\\) for some\n\\(m\\), we say that \\(\\alpha\\) is an extension of \\(\\beta\\),\nand that \\(\\beta\\) is a restriction of \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nA subset \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(S\\) is said to be detachable (from\n\\(S)\\) if \n\\[\n\\forall x\\in S (x \\in \\sigma \\vee x \\not\\in \\sigma).\n\\]\n\n\nA detachable subset \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(\\bN^*\\) is called a fan\nif \n\nit is closed under restriction: for each \\(\\alpha \\in \\bN^*\\) and\neach \\(n\\), if \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(n) \\in S\\), then \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(k) \\in\nS\\) whenever \\(0 \\le k \\le n\\); and\nfor each \\(\\alpha \\in \\sigma\\), the set \n\\[\n\\{ \\alpha^* n \\in S: n \\in \\bN \\}\n\\]\n\n\nis finite or empty, where \\(\\alpha^* n\\) denotes the finite sequence\nobtained by adjoining the natural number \\(n\\) to the terms of\n\\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\nA path in a fan \\(\\sigma\\) is a sequence \\(\\alpha\\), finite\nor infinite, such that \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(n) \\in \\sigma\\) for each\napplicable \\(n\\). We say that a path \\(\\alpha\\) is blocked by\na subset \\(B\\) if some restriction of \\(\\alpha\\) is in \\(B\\); if no\nrestriction of \\(\\alpha\\) is in \\(B\\), we say that \\(\\alpha\\)\nmisses \\(B\\). A subset \\(B\\) of a fan \\(\\sigma\\) is called a\nbar for \\(\\sigma\\) if each infinite path of \\(\\sigma\\) is\nblocked by \\(B\\); a bar \\(B\\) for \\(\\sigma\\) is uniform if\nthere exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\) such that each path of length \\(n\\) is\nblocked by \\(B\\).\n\nAt last we can state Brouwer\u2019s next principle of intuitionism,\nthe fan theorem for detachable bars (FT\\(_D\\)):\n\nEvery detachable bar of a fan is uniform.\n\nIn its classical contrapositive form, FT\\(_D\\) is known as\nK\u00f6nig\u2019s Lemma: if for every \\(n\\) there exists a\npath of length \\(n\\) that misses \\(B\\), then there exists an infinite\npath that misses \\(B\\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000], 49\u201353). (Of\ncourse, classically the condition of detachability is superfluous.) It\nis simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample to\nK\u00f6nig\u2019s Lemma.\n\nBrouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of\ndetachability of the bar. Attempts to prove that more general fan\ntheorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a\nsubset is a bar, and led Brouwer to a notion of bar\ninduction; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics;\n another good reference for bar induction is van Atten (2004). We\nshall return to fan theorems in Section 4. \n\nOf the many applications of Brouwer\u2019s principles, the most\nfamous is his uniform continuity theorem (which follows from\nthe pointwise continuity consequences of CC1-2 together a form of fan\ntheorem more general than FT\\(_D)\\):\n\nEvery mapping from a compact (that is, complete, totally bounded)\nmetric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous.\n\n\nThe reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionistic framework, and not to jump to the\nerroneous conclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical\nmathematics. It is more sensible to regard the two types of\nmathematics as incomparable. For further discussion, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic.\n\nUnfortunately \u2014 and perhaps inevitably, in the face of\nopposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert \u2014\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy\nbecame more and more involved in what, at least to classical\nmathematicians, appeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the\nnature of constructive thought, to the detriment of the practice of\nconstructive mathematics itself. This unfortunate polarisation between\nthe Brouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious\nGrundlagenstreit of the 1920s, details of which can be found in the\nBrouwer biographies by van Dalen [1999, 2005] and van Stigt\n[1990].\n",
