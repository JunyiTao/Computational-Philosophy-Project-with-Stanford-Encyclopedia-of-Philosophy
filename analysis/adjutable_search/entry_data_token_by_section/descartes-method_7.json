Experiment and Supposition in Discourse VI and Principles III\u2013IV\n\nWhat role does experiment play in Cartesian science? In The\nWorld and Principles II, Descartes deduces the\nprinciples of physics (the laws of nature) from the first principle of\nmetaphysics: God. The laws of nature can be deduced by reason alone\nfrom God\u2019s immutability (see AT 11: 36\u201348, CSM 1:\n92\u201398; AT 8A: 61\u00ad67, CSM 1: 240\u2013244). Experiment plays\nno role in Descartes\u2019 deduction of the laws of nature. However,\nthis does not mean that experiment plays no role in Cartesian science.\nOn the contrary, in Discourse VI, Descartes clearly indicates when experiments become necessary in the course\nof scientific inquiry:\n\n\n[The] power of nature is so ample and so vast, and these principles\n[sc. the laws of nature] so simple and so general, that I notice\nhardly any particular effect which I do not know at once that it can\nbe deduced from the principles in many different ways; and my greatest\ndifficulty is usually to discover in which of these ways it depends on\nthem. I know no other means to discover this than by seeking further\nobservations whose outcomes vary according to which of these ways\nprovides the correct explanation (AT 6: 64\u201365, CSM 1: 144).\n\n\nThere are countless effects in nature that can be deduced from the\nlaws of nature \u201cin many different ways\u201d. How do we find\nthe right way? Experiment. We start with the effects we want\nto explain; we isolate and manipulate these effects in order to more\nprecisely determine the conditions under which they are produced;\nand then we make suppositions about what their underlying causes are\nbased on what we know about the nature of matter and the laws of\nnature. Traditional deductive order is reversed; underlying causes too\nsmall to be directly observed are deduced from given effects.\nDescartes describes his procedure for deducing causes from effects\ntoward the end of Discourse VI:\n\n\nFor I take my reasonings to be so closely interconnected that just as\nthe last are proved by the first, which are their causes, so the first\nare proved by the last, which are their effects. It must not be\nsupposed that I am here committing the fallacy that the logicians call\n\u201carguing in a circle\u201d. For as experience makes most of\nthese effects quite certain, the causes from which I deduce them serve\nnot so much to prove them as to explain them; indeed, quite to the\ncontrary, it is the causes which are proved by the effects. And I have\ncalled them \u201csuppositions\u201d simply to make it known that I\nthink I can deduce them from the primary truths I have expounded\nabove. (Discourse VI, AT 6: 76, CSM 1: 150)\n\n\nThe suppositions Descartes refers to here are introduced in the course\nof experiment; they describe the shapes, sizes, and motions of the\nbodies that cause the effects observed in an experiment. Suppositions\nare needed because these particles are beyond the reach of\nobservation. Some scholars have argued that in Discourse VI\nDescartes introduces a method distinct from the method developed in\nthe Rules and even Discourse II. For these scholars, the method in the\nRules is a priori and proceeds from causes to\neffects, while the method in Discourse VI is a\nposteriori and proceeds from effects to causes (see Clarke 1982).\nThe latter method, they claim, is the so-called\n\u201chypothetico-deductive method\u201d (see Larmore 1980: 6\u201322 and Clarke 1982:\n10). Others have argued that this interpretation of both the\nRules and Discourse VI suffers from a number of\nproblems. First, experiment is in no way excluded from the method\ndeveloped in the Rules. On the contrary, in both the Rules and the\nEssays, experiment neither interrupts nor replaces deduction;\nexperiment structures deduction because it helps one reduce problems to their simplest component parts (see Garber 2001: 85\u2013110). A hint of this\ncan already be seen in the anaclastic example (see\n Section 3):\n the third problem in the reduction (\u201cHow is refraction caused by light passing from one medium to another?\u201d) can only be discovered by observing that light behaves\ndifferently in a variety of transparent media.\nExperiment structures of the deduction. This is also the case\nin Descartes\u2019 deduction of the cause of the rainbow (see\n Section 7\n below and Garber 2001: 91\u2013104). Second, in Discourse VI,\nDescartes explicitly asserts that the suppositions introduced in the\nEssays can be deduced from first principles or \u201cprimary\ntruths\u201d, and there is no room for such demonstrations in the\nhypothetico-deductive method, in which hypotheses are confirmed by\nexperience alone.\n",
