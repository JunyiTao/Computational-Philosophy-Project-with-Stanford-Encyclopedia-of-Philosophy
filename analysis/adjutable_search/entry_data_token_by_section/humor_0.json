Couples listing the traits they prize in their\nspouses usually put \u201csense of humor\u201d at or near the top.\nPhilosophers are concerned with what is important in life, so two\nthings are surprising about what they have said about humor. \n\nThe first is how little they have said. From ancient times to the\n20th century, the most that any notable philosopher wrote\nabout laughter or humor was an essay, and only a few lesser-known\nthinkers such as Frances Hutcheson and James Beattie wrote that much.\nThe word humor was not used in its current sense of funniness\nuntil the 18th century, we should note, and so traditional\ndiscussions were about laughter or comedy. The most that major\nphilosophers like Plato, Hobbes, and Kant wrote about laughter or\nhumor was a few paragraphs within a discussion of another topic. Henri\nBergson\u2019s 1900 Laughter was the first book by a notable\nphilosopher on humor. Martian anthropologists comparing the amount of\nphilosophical writing on humor with what has been written on, say,\njustice, or even on Rawls\u2019 Veil of Ignorance, might well\nconclude that humor could be left out of human life without much\nloss.\n\nThe second surprising thing is how negative most philosophers have\nbeen in their assessments of humor. From ancient Greece until the\n20th century, the vast majority of philosophical comments\non laughter and humor focused on scornful or mocking laughter, or on\nlaughter that overpowers people, rather than on comedy, wit, or\njoking. Plato, the most influential critic of laughter, treated laughter as\nan emotion that overrides rational self-control. In the Republic\n(388e), he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid\nlaughter, \u201cfor ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent\nlaughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\u201d Especially\ndisturbing to Plato were the passages in the Iliad and the\nOdyssey where Mount Olympus was said to ring with the\nlaughter of the gods. He protested that \u201cif anyone represents\nmen of worth as overpowered by laughter we must not accept it, much\nless if gods.\u201d\n\nAnother of Plato\u2019s objections to laughter is that it is\nmalicious. In Philebus (48\u201350), he analyzes the\nenjoyment of comedy as a form of scorn. \u201cTaken generally,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cthe ridiculous is a certain kind of evil, specifically\na vice.\u201d That vice is self-ignorance: the people we laugh at\nimagine themselves to be wealthier, better looking, or more virtuous\nthan they really are. In laughing at them, we take delight in\nsomething evil\u2014their self-ignorance\u2014and that malice is\nmorally objectionable. \n\nBecause of these objections to laughter and humor, Plato says that in\nthe ideal state, comedy should be tightly controlled. \u201cWe shall\nenjoin that such representations be left to slaves or hired aliens,\nand that they receive no serious consideration whatsoever. No free\nperson, whether woman or man, shall be found taking lessons in\nthem.\u201d \u201cNo composer of comedy, iambic or lyric verse shall\nbe permitted to hold any citizen up to laughter, by word or gesture,\nwith passion or otherwise\u201d (Laws, 7: 816e; 11:\n935e).\n\nGreek thinkers after Plato had similarly negative comments about\nlaughter and humor. Though Aristotle considered wit a valuable part of\nconversation (Nicomachean Ethics 4, 8), he agreed with Plato\nthat laughter expresses scorn. Wit, he says in the Rhetoric\n(2, 12), is educated insolence. In the Nicomachean Ethics (4,\n8) he warns that \u201cMost people enjoy amusement and jesting more\nthan they should \u2026 a jest is a kind of mockery, and lawgivers\nforbid some kinds of mockery\u2014perhaps they ought to have\nforbidden some kinds of jesting.\u201d The Stoics, with their\nemphasis on self-control, agreed with Plato that laughter diminishes\nself-control. Epictetus\u2019s Enchiridion (33) advises\n\u201cLet not your laughter be loud, frequent, or\nunrestrained.\u201d His followers said that he never laughed at\nall.\n\nThese objections to laughter and humor influenced early Christian\nthinkers, and through them later European culture. They were\nreinforced by negative representations of laughter and humor in the\nBible, the vast majority of which are linked to hostility. The only\nway God is described as laughing in the Bible is with hostility:\n\n\nThe kings of the earth stand ready, and the rulers conspire together\nagainst the Lord and his anointed king\u2026 . The Lord who sits\nenthroned in heaven laughs them to scorn; then he rebukes them in\nanger, he threatens them in his wrath (Psalm 2:2\u20135).\n\n\nGod\u2019s spokesmen in the Bible are the Prophets, and for them,\ntoo, laughter expresses hostility. In the contest between God\u2019s\nprophet Elijah and the 450 prophets of Baal, for example, Elijah\nridicules them for their god\u2019s powerlessness, and then has them\nslain (1 Kings 18:21\u201327). In the Bible, mockery is so offensive\nthat it may deserve death, as when a group of children laugh at the\nprophet Elisha for his baldness:\n\n\nHe went up from there to Bethel and, as he was on his way, some small\nboys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, \u201cGet along\nwith you, bald head, get along.\u201d He turned round and looked at\nthem and he cursed then in the name of the Lord; and two she-bears\ncame out of a wood and mauled forty-two of them (2 Kings\n2:23).\n\n\nBringing together negative assessments of laughter from the Bible with\ncriticisms from Greek philosophy, early Christian leaders such as\nAmbrose, Jerome, Basil, Ephraim, and John Chrysostom warned against\neither excessive laughter or laughter generally. Sometimes what they\ncriticized was laughter in which the person loses self-control. In his\nLong Rules, for instance, Basil the Great wrote that\n\u201craucous laughter and uncontrollable shaking of the body are not\nindications of a well-regulated soul, or of personal dignity, or\nself-mastery\u201d (in Wagner 1962, 271). Other times they linked\nlaughter with idleness, irresponsibility, lust, or anger. John\nChrysostom, for example, warned that \n\n\nLaughter often gives birth to foul discourse, and foul discourse to\nactions still more foul. Often from words and laughter proceed railing\nand insult; and from railing and insult, blows and wounds; and from\nblows and wounds, slaughter and murder. If, then, you would take good\ncounsel for yourself, avoid not merely foul words and foul deeds, or\nblows and wounds and murders, but unseasonable laughter itself (in\nSchaff 1889, 442).\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the Christian institution that most emphasized\nself-control\u2014the monastery\u2014was harsh in condemning\nlaughter. One of the earliest monastic orders, of Pachom of Egypt,\nforbade joking (Adkin 1985, 151\u2013152). The Rule of St. Benedict,\nthe most influential monastic code, advised monks to \u201cprefer\nmoderation in speech and speak no foolish chatter, nothing just to\nprovoke laughter; do not love immoderate or boisterous\nlaughter.\u201d In Benedict\u2019s Ladder of Humility, Step Ten is a\nrestraint against laughter, and Step Eleven a warning against joking\n(Gilhus 1997, 65). The monastery of St. Columbanus Hibernus had these\npunishments: \u201cHe who smiles in the service \u2026 six strokes;\nif he breaks out in the noise of laughter, a special fast unless it\nhas happened pardonably\u201d (Resnick 1987, 95).\n\nThe Christian European rejection of laughter and humor continued\nthrough the Middle Ages, and whatever the Reformers reformed, it did\nnot include the traditional assessment of humor. Among the strongest\ncondemnations came from the Puritans, who wrote tracts against\nlaughter and comedy. One by William Prynne (1633) was over 1100 pages long and purported to show that comedies \u201care sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable mischiefes to churches, to republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men.\u201d It encouraged Christians to live sober, serious lives, and not to be \u201cimmoderately tickled with mere lascivious vanities, or  \u2026 lash out in excessive cachinnations in the public view of dissolute graceless persons.\u201d When the Puritans came to rule England in the mid-17th century, they outlawed comedies. \n\nAt this time, too, the philosophical case against laughter was\nstrengthened by Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Hobbes\u2019\nLeviathan (1651 [1982]) describes human beings as naturally\nindividualistic and competitive. That makes us alert to signs that we\nare winning or losing. The former make us feel good and the latter\nbad. If our perception of some sign that we are superior comes over us\nquickly, our good feelings are likely to issue in laughter. In Part I,\nch. 6, he writes that\n\n\nSudden glory, is the passion which makes those grimaces called\nlaughter; and is caused either by some sudden act of their own, that\npleases them; or by the apprehension of some deformed thing in\nanother, by comparison whereof they suddenly applaud themselves. And\nit is incident most to them, that are conscious of the fewest\nabilities in themselves; who are forced to keep themselves in their\nown favor by observing the imperfections of other men. And therefore\nmuch laughter at the defects of others, is a sign of pusillanimity.\nFor of great minds, one of the proper works is, to help and free\nothers from scorn; and to compare themselves only with the most\nable.\n\n\nA similar explanation of laughter from the same time is found in\nDescartes\u2019 Passions of the Soul. He says that laughter\naccompanies three of the six basic emotions\u2014wonder, love, (mild)\nhatred, desire, joy, and sadness. Although admitting that there are\nother causes of laughter than hatred, in Part 3 of this book,\n\u201cOf Particular Passions,\u201d he considers laughter only as an\nexpression of scorn and ridicule. \n\n\nDerision or scorn is a sort of joy mingled with hatred, which proceeds\nfrom our perceiving some small evil in a person whom we consider to be\ndeserving of it; we have hatred for this evil, we have joy in seeing\nit in him who is deserving of it; and when that comes upon us\nunexpectedly, the surprise of wonder is the cause of our bursting into\nlaughter\u2026 And we notice that people with very obvious defects\nsuch as those who are lame, blind of an eye, hunched-backed, or who\nhave received some public insult, are specially given to mockery; for,\ndesiring to see all others held in as low estimation as themselves,\nthey are truly rejoiced at the evils that befall them, and they hold\nthem deserving of these (art. 178\u2013179).\n\n",
