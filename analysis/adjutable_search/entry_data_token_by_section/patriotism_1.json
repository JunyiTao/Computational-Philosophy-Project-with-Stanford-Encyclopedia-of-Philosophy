    "main_text": "Conceptual issues || Patriotism and nationalism\n1.2 Patriotism and nationalism\n\nDiscussions of both patriotism and\n nationalism\n are often marred by lack of clarity due to the failure to distinguish\nthe two. Many authors use the two terms interchangeably. Among those\nwho do not, quite a few have made the distinction in ways that are not\nvery helpful. In the 19th century, Lord Acton contrasted\n\u201cnationality\u201d and patriotism as affection and instinct vs.\na moral relation. Nationality is \u201cour connection with the\nrace\u201d that is \u201cmerely natural or physical,\u201d while\npatriotism is the awareness of our moral duties to the political\ncommunity (Acton 1972, 163). In the 20th century, Elie\nKedourie did the opposite, presenting nationalism as a full-fledged\nphilosophical and political doctrine about nations as basic units of\nhumanity within which the individual can find freedom and fulfilment,\nand patriotism as mere sentiment of affection for one\u2019s country\n(Kedourie 1985, 73\u201374).\n\nGeorge Orwell contrasted the two in terms of aggressive vs. defensive\nattitudes. Nationalism is about power: its adherent wants to acquire\nas much power and prestige as possible for his nation, in which he\nsubmerges his individuality. While nationalism is accordingly\naggressive, patriotism is defensive: it is a devotion to a particular\nplace and a way of life one thinks best, but has no wish to impose on\nothers (Orwell 1968, 362). This way of distinguishing the two\nattitudes comes close to an approach popular among politicians and\nwidespread in everyday discourse that indicates a double standard of\nthe form \u201cus vs. them.\u201d Country and nation are first run\ntogether, and then patriotism and nationalism are distinguished in\nterms of the strength of the love and special concern one feels for\nit, the degree of one\u2019s identification with it. When these are\nexhibited in a reasonable degree and without ill thoughts about others\nand hostile actions towards them, that is patriotism; when they become\nunbridled and cause one to think ill of others and act badly towards\nthem, that is nationalism. Conveniently enough, it usually turns out\nthat we are patriots, while they are nationalists\n(see Billig 1995, 55\u201359).\n\nThere is yet another way of distinguishing patriotism and nationalism\n\u2013 one that is quite simple and begs no moral questions. We can\nput aside the political sense of \u201cnation\u201d that makes it\nidentical with \u201ccountry,\u201d \u201cstate,\u201d or\n\u201cpolity,\u201d and the political or civic type of nationalism\nrelated to it. We need concern ourselves only with the other, ethnic\nor cultural sense of \u201cnation,\u201d and focus on ethnic or\ncultural nationalism. In order to do so, we do not have to spell out\nthe relevant understanding of \u201cnation\u201d; it is enough to\ncharacterize it in terms of common ancestry, history, and a set of\ncultural traits. Both patriotism and nationalism involve love of,\nidentification with, and special concern for a certain entity. In the\ncase of patriotism, that entity is one\u2019s patria,\none\u2019s country; in the case of nationalism, that entity is\none\u2019s natio, one\u2019s nation (in the ethnic/cultural\nsense of the term). Thus patriotism and nationalism are understood as\nthe same type of set of beliefs and attitudes, and distinguished in\nterms of their objects, rather than the strength of those beliefs and\nattitudes, or as sentiment vs. theory.\n\nTo be sure, there is much overlap between country and nation, and\ntherefore between patriotism and nationalism; thus much that applies\nto one will also apply to the other. But when a country is not\nethnically homogeneous, or when a nation lacks a country of its own,\nthe two may part ways.\n",
