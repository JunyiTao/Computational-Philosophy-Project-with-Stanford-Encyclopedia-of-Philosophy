In the second half of the\nnineteenth century, scholars began to examine the relation of music to\nthe life sciences. A major force behind this shift of attitude is the\nwork of Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882). His theory of evolution\nposits two main processes responsible for changes in a living species,\nnatural selection and sexual selection. Individual variability and\nrandom mutations introduce differences in the traits possessed by\ndifferent individuals belonging to the same species. Traits that favor\nthe survival of offspring who would themselves go on to reproduce are\nmore likely to reappear in future generations. This is natural\nselection. Sexual selection concerns the selection of mating partners.\nWidespread preference for a given trait means that future generations\nwill be more likely to possess that trait. In both cases, the traits\nin question must be heritable.\n\nIn The Descent of Man (1871) and in The Expression of\nEmotions in Man and Animals (1872), Darwin proposes that sexual\nselection is responsible for the effect of music. He observes that\nvarious species produce vocalizations or other sounds as part of\ncourtship. For example, he identifies this as the goal of birdsong,\nalthough the consensus today is that birdsong also functions as a\nterritorial call. In virtue of this origin, music has the power\n\n\nof recalling in a vague and indefinite manner, those strong emotions\nwhich were felt during long-past ages, when, as is probable, our early\nprogenitors courted each other by the aid of vocal tones. (Darwin\n1872: 219 (chapter VIII); a contemporary defense of the view that the\narts are the product of sexual selections is found in Miller 2001; for\na recent review on the evidence supporting Darwin\u2019s hypothesis,\nsee Ravignani 2018)\n\n\nDarwin\u2019s hypothesis implies that music is likely to have\npredated language, as it arises from needs that are more basic than\nlinguistic communication. The inflections typical of impassioned\nspeech derive from those employed in courtship. Another feature of\nthis account is that is it better able to explain music\u2019s\nexpression and arousal of positive emotions, such as love, tenderness,\nand happiness, than that of negative emotions, as only the former are\ntypically involved in courtship.\n\nHerbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) defended an explanation of the\norigin of music distinct from Darwin\u2019s. Spencer holds as a\ngeneral physiological principle that any emotion produces movement.\nWhen movement involves the vocal tract, emotions result in\nvocalizations. Music derives from an exaggeration of the usual\nfeatures of vocal emotional expression. Thus, \u201cvocal music, and\nby consequence all music, is an idealization of the natural language\nof passion\u201d (Spencer 1857 [2015: 29]). This view of\nmusic\u2019s origin locates its expressive value in the melodic\nelement, rather than in harmony, as expressive vocalizations do not\nproduce more than one sound at once. However, Spencer emphasizes that\nhis explanation of music\u2019s origin is not to be taken as a\ngeneral theory of music\u2019s value, and that elements of music that\nare not amenable to its original function (notably harmony) remain\nentirely legitimate (Spencer 1890: 466\u2013467). Factual hypotheses\nregarding music\u2019s origin are thus separated from aesthetic\nnorms. This is a relevant methodological difference between\nSpencer\u2019s hypothesis about the origin of music and previous\nones, most notably Rousseau\u2019s (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 3.5).\n\nSpencer and Darwin expressed admiration for each other\u2019s work,\nalthough Kivy (1959: 47) points out that they were also aware of their\ncrucial methodological differences. While the former relied on general\nlaws as ultimate explanatory principles, Darwin accepted\ngeneralizations only insofar as they were supported by empirical\nevidence. Exemplary of this contrast is one of Spencer\u2019s\narguments against the view that music develops out of vocalizations\nemployed during courtship. Spencer holds that it is \u201cone of the\nfundamental laws of evolution\u201d that \u201c[a]ll development\nproceeds from the general to the special\u201d (1890: 458). To say\nthat a subset of vocalizations (those used during courtship) has\ngenerated a more general class of sounds (all vocalizations expressing\nemotions, including music) is to contradict that principle.\n\nWhile the figure of Edmund Gurney (1847\u20131888) is often discussed\nin association with Darwin and Spencer, and mostly exclusively in\nconnection with their views, the scope and quality of argumentation in\nhis work are comparable with few other works in Western musical\naesthetics. In view of this, the relatively little critical attention\nhe has received is surprising.\n\nGurney\u2019s framework is a formalist one, as he holds music\u2019s\nvalue to depend primarily on its presentation of abstract forms. This\nis achieved through music\u2019s \u201cideal motion\u201d, where\n\u201cideal\u201d refers to music\u2019s capacity to convey\nabstract forms (Gurney 1880: 164\u2013165). Form and motion are thus\nthe two essential aspects of music, and specifically of melody.\nAlthough talk of motion may suggests an analogy with physical space,\nGurney is explicit in saying that this is nothing but the\n\u201cfaintest metaphor\u201d (1880: 337), as the spatial character\nof melodic motion is radically different from that of visual arts and\narchitecture. Through an enlightening contrast with these art forms,\nGurney shows that music\u2019s motion is ordered in time, in such a\nway that the succession of its elements is already fixed. Not so in\nthe properly spatial arts, in which we apprehend elements in an order\ndetermined by our act of vision (Gurney 1880: 94). Gurney further\nargues the value of music must reside primarily in short sequences we\nare able to grasp in one hearing, and not in the understanding of\nlarge-scale structures (Gurney 1880: 96\u201397; a similar position,\ninspired by Gurney, has been recently defended in Levinson 1997).\n\nMusical forms are not merely an object of understanding, but also\narouse a distinctive emotion in us. In fact, Gurney holds that\nmusic\u2019s most important feature is its capacity to arouse an\nemotion which is specifically musical,\n\n\n\u2026an emotional excitement of a very intense kind, which yet\ncannot be defined under any known head of emotion. (Gurney 1880:\n120)\n\n\nGurney proposes a Darwinian explanation for this. Beautiful music\narouses an emotion that is unlike any other because it produces an\nunconscious association with the sexual emotion experienced by our\nforebears (Gurney 1880: 116 ff.). However, Gurney points out an\nimportant limit of this explanation: the Darwinian account cannot\nexplain why only beautiful music arouses such an emotion, as\nit posits a connection between musical phenomena in general and the\narousal of that emotion (Gurney 1880: 121\u2013124; 1887:\n297\u201398).\n\nGurney\u2019s formalism is more nuanced than views that entirely deny\nmusic\u2019s capacity to express emotions. While music\u2019s chief\nvalue resides in its capacity to be impressive, that is, to\narouse the peculiarly musical emotion that is connected to musical\nbeauty, Gurney concedes that music may be expressive, in that\nit may arouse emotions of the ordinary kind, or suggest extra-musical\nimages and ideas (Gurney 1880: 312). But expressiveness is subordinate\nto impressiveness. First, it is not an essential or even typical\nelement of valuable music, as much beautiful music isn\u2019t\nexpressive of any definite emotion. Second, it does not by itself give\nan explanation of the power and value of the art, as expressive\nqualities per se (e.g., in a face) are not a source of value\n(Gurney 1880: 338). Gurney\u2019s additional claims, that\nimpressiveness amplifies a piece\u2019s expressiveness (1880: 339)\nand is even required for expressiveness to be valuable (1880: 314),\nare hard to make sense of unless his theory of expressiveness is\nfurther clarified (an extensive discussion of Gurney\u2019s views is\nfound in Budd 1985: chapter 4).\n",
