    "main_text": "Premises: The Structures of Assertions || Affirmations, Denials, and Contradictions\n4.2 Affirmations, Denials, and Contradictions\n\nAristotle takes some pains in On Interpretation to argue that\nto every affirmation there corresponds exactly one denial such that\nthat denial denies exactly what that affirmation affirms. The pair\nconsisting of an affirmation and its corresponding denial is a\ncontradiction (antiphasis). In general,\nAristotle holds, exactly one member of any contradiction is true and\none false: they cannot both be true, and they cannot both be false.\nHowever, he appears to make an exception for propositions about future\nevents, though interpreters have debated extensively what this\nexception might be (see\n further discussion\n below). The principle that contradictories cannot both be true has\nfundamental importance in Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics (see\n further discussion\n below).\n",
