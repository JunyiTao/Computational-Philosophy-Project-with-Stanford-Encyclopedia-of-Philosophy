    "main_text": "Objections to Disjunctivism || Neither Conjunctivism Nor Disjunctivism\n4.3 Neither Conjunctivism Nor Disjunctivism\n\n\nThere is another version of the causal argument that can be used to\nput pressure on the disjunctivist to accept that there is a common\nelement to veridical perception and causally matching hallucination.\n(See Johnston 2004 and Martin 2004.) The proponent of this argument may\nallow for the possibility that there are non-causal constitutive\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of certain kinds of mental\nevents, where such constitutive conditions may include the presence in\nthe environment of appropriate candidate objects of perception.\nSo this version of the causal argument can accommodate the\ndisjunctivist\u2019s claim that there are significant non-causal\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of the kind of experience that\noccurs when one veridically perceives the world. What this version of\nthe causal argument relies upon is, rather, the claim that there are no\nsuch significant non-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of\nthe kind experience that occurs when one hallucinates. The\nproponent of this modified causal argument claims that there are no\nnon-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of the kind of\nexperience that occurs when one hallucinates that cannot also obtain\nwhen one veridically perceives the world. So whatever kind of\nexperience occurs when you have a causally matching hallucination of an\nF will also be produced when you have a veridical perception\nof an F.  So there is, after all, a common element to\nveridical perception and causally matching hallucination.\n\n\nCan the disjunctivist respond by saying that there is a non-causal\nconstitutive condition necessary for the kind experience that occurs\nwhen one hallucinates\u2014namely the absence of an\nappropriate candidate object of perception in the subject\u2019s\nenvironment? A problem with this response is that it relies on\ncharacterising the kind of psychological effect involved in\nhallucination in terms of what it is not, namely a veridical\nperception, and it is plausible to demand that it should be possible to\nprovide some positive account of the kind of psychological\neffect involved when one hallucinates.\n\n\nThis version of the causal argument does not rely on the general\nprinciple \u2018same proximate cause, same immediate effect\u2019,\nso a proponent of the argument may allow that there is a kind of\nmental event that occurs when one perceives the world which\ndoesn\u2019t occur when one hallucinates. Moreover, a proponent of\nthe argument may also allow that there is an explanatory role to be\nplayed by the kind of mental event that only occurs when one perceives\nthe world, which cannot be performed by appealing to the kind of\nmental event that is common to perception and illusion, plus some\nfurther non-mental conditions. (For this idea see Peacocke 1993 and\nWilliamson 2000).  However, the argument does put pressure on the\ndisjunctivist to accept that there is a certain kind of mental event\ncommon to perception and hallucination\u2014one that we should be\nable to give a positive, non-disjunctive account of. (See Burge 2005,\n2010 and 2011 for arguments to the effect that a denial of this claim\nis empirically untenable and incompatible with the methodology of\nvision science.) It suggests that if one simply wants to claim that\ngenuine perceptions are mental events of a kind that cannot occur when\none hallucinates, one should not be concerned to argue for a\ndisjunctive account of perceptual experience. One\u2019s concern\nshould simply be to oppose a conjunctive account of genuine\nperception. (For this line of criticism see Williamson 2000 and\nJohnston 2004).\n\n\nOne may be able to accept that a veridical perception and a\nhallucination differ mentally, while also accepting that they have a\ncommon mental core. Mark Johnston offers an account of hallucination\nalong these lines. He proposes that there is a respect in which the\nobjects of hallucination and the objects of seeing are akin. According\nto Johnston, the objects of a subject\u2019s hallucination are\ncomplexes of sensible qualities and relations that are not instantiated\nin the scene before him, whereas the objects of veridical perception\nare spatio-temporal particulars instantiating such complexes. On this\nview, there is, then, a common mental core to veridical perception and\nhallucination. In both cases one is aware of a \u2018sensible\nprofile\u2019\u2014a complex of qualities and relations.\n\n\nThe disjunctivist is generally willing to concede that perceptions\nand subjectively indistinguishible hallucinations have\nsomething in common. So why should they not accept that what\nis common to perception and hallucination is the occurrence of a\ncertain kind of mental event whose nature is one that we can give a\npositive, non-disjunctive account of?\n Martin argues that the na\u00efve realist disjunctivist should\ndeny that it is possible to give a positive, non-derivative account of\nthe kind of phenomenal event that occurs when one hallucinates. (This\nis to oppose the suggestion made in Dancy 1995. See Martin 1997, 2004\nand 2006. For discussion see Nudds 2009.). For if the na\u00efve\nrealist does offer a positive, non-derivative account of the kind\nphenomenal event that occurs when one hallucinates, and she also\naccepts that this kind of event also occurs when one perceives the\nworld, then she will be under pressure to explain why the occurrence of\nthis kind of event doesn\u2019t screen off the explanatory role that she\nassigns to her na\u00efve realist account of the phenomenal character\nof genuine perception. (For critical discussion of this objection, see\nHellie 2013). Martin\u2019s response to the argument is to say that the\nna\u00efve realist should affirm that in the case of a causally\nmatching hallucination, there is no more to the phenomenal character\nof such an experience than that of being introspectively\nindiscriminible from a certain genuine perception. In the case of the\ncausally matching hallucination its subjective character is exhausted\nby its possession of the negative epistemic property\u2014that of\nbeing introspectively indiscriminible from a veridical perception.\n\n\nIt might now be objected that this disjunctivist response still\nintroduces a common element to veridical perception and causally\nmatching hallucination that screens off the explanatory role that the\nna\u00efve realist assigns to her distinctive account of the\nphenomenal character of veridical perception. Both a veridical\nperception of an F and a causally matching hallucination\npossess the negative epistemic property of being introspectively\nindiscriminible from a veridical perception of an F. So why\ndoesn\u2019t this screen off any explanatory role that the na\u00efve\nrealist might assign to the phenomenal properties that she claims only\na veridical perception can possess? Martin\u2019s response is to\nsuggest that the property of being indiscriminible from an F\nhas an explanatory potential which is dependent on the explanatory\npotential of being an F.  So the property of\nactually being a veridical perception, and having the phenomenal\nproperties that only a veridical perception can possess, can still be\nregarded as having a crucial explanatory role to play.\n\n\nHowever, this response still leaves the na\u00efve realist in the\nposition of having to deny that it is possible to provide a positive\naccount of the phenomenal character of a causally matching\nhallucination. Many have argued that this claim is ultimately\nuntenable. So the modified causal argument can be seen as part of an\nattempt to force the na\u00efve realist disjunctivist into an untenable\nposition with respect to causally matching hallucinations.\n",
