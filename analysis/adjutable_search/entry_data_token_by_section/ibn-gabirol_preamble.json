    "main_text": "\n\n\nA prolific poet and the author of the Fons Vitae, Ibn Gabirol\nis well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all\nthings \u2014including soul and intellect\u2014are comprised of\nmatter and form (\u201cUniversal Hylomorphism\u201d), and for his\nemphasis on Divine Will. Ibn Gabirol is moved first and foremost by\nthe Neoplatonic theological sense that God's reality infuses all\nthings, and by the concomitant ethical and existential ideal of\nNeoplatonic Return\u2014the notion that we must strive, through mind\nand deed, to reclaim our own truest being and likeness to our\nsource. Thought wrongly by centuries of Christian scholastics to be\neither a Christian defender of Augustine or a Muslim misreader of\nAristotle, Ibn Gabirol is in fact a Jewish Neoplatonist who, under the\nadditional influence of Pseudo Empedoclean ideas, paints for us a\nmodified Plotinian universe in which all things are rooted in various\n\u201clayers\u201d of matters and forms which reveal the mediating\ngraces of God's own Will/Wisdom/Word. For Ibn Gabirol, everything\n(even the simple unity of intellect itself) reveals a matter+form\ncomplexity, mirroring in this way the complex unity of God's own\n\u201cessential\u201d and \u201cactive\u201d moments. Where God\nreveals himself as the \u201cFountain of Life,\u201d our material\ncore acts as the river through which we may return always to our\nsource.\n",
