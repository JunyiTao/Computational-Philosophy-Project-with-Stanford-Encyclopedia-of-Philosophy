    "main_text": "Empirical challenges and the role of consciousness || The Libet experiment and Wegner\u2019s challenge\n4.3 The Libet experiment and Wegner\u2019s challenge\nThe most influential empirical challenge concerning the role of\nconscious intentions stems from Libet\u2019s seminal neuroscientific\nwork on the initiation of movements. In the Libet experiment (Libet\n1985), participants were instructed to initiate a simple and\npredefined movement when the wish or urge to do so arises. During\nthis, EEG measurements were taken to record the readiness potential, a\nbrain potential that was known to precede intentional movements. The\nmain finding was that the readiness potential precedes the occurrence\nof the conscious wish or urge to move by about 350ms. According to\nLibet, this shows that movements are not consciously initiated and\nthat we do not have free will in the sense we commonly think we do\n(Libet 1999). The methodology of this experiment has been scrutinized\nextensively and criticized on a number of points. Some of those\nmethodological issues have been addressed in follow-up experiments\n(Soon et al. 2008; Fried et al. 2011).\nMost philosophers who have addressed Libet\u2019s work have argued\nthat the conclusions about the role of conscious intentions and about\nfree will do not follow, even if it is granted that the experimental\nmethods and results are sound. They have argued that there are\nalternative interpretations of the evidence that preserve a causal\nrole for conscious intentions and that are as plausible and probable\nas Libet\u2019s own interpretation of the evidence (Flanagan 1992:\n136\u2013138; Zhu 2003; Mele 2009a; Schlosser 2012b). Further, it has\nbeen argued that the experiment creates a very unusual and artificial\ncontext in which participants are instructed to\ndecide spontaneously. Due to this, it is questionable that\nthe results of the experiment can be generalized (Keller and\nHeckhausen 1990; Roskies 2011; Waller 2012; Schlosser 2014). Schurger\net al. (2012) have proposed and tested a model that addresses this\nissue. According to this model, the timing of the movement in the\nLibet experiment is determined by random threshold crossings in\nspontaneous fluctuations in neural activity. In particular, the model\nsays that a decision when to move is determined by random threshold\ncrossings only when it is not constrained by any evidence or\nreasons for action. The fact that this model has been tested\nsuccessfully supports the claim that the results from the Libet\nexperiment and from similar follow-up studies do not generalize,\nbecause most of our everyday decisions clearly are constrained by\nevidence and by reasons for action.\nA related challenge concerning the role of conscious intentions\nstems from Wegner\u2019s model of apparent mental\ncausation. According to this view, conscious intentions provide mere\n\u201cpreviews\u201d of our actions: they precede our actions, but\nthey do not cause them (Wegner and Wheatley 1999; Wegner\n2002). Wegner provided evidence of dissociations between the sense of\nagency and the actual exercise of agency, and he argued that the\nmodel of apparent mental causation provides the best explanation of\nthe data. This view has been strongly criticized for conceptual ambiguities and\nargumentative flaws (see also section 4.5). One common objection is that the fact that the sense of agency can come apart from the exercise of agency is\nperfectly compatible with the assumption that conscious intentions\ntend to cause the intended actions. (See Bayne 2006; Mele 2009a; for\na reply to Wegner\u2019s inference to the best explanation see\nSchlosser 2012a.)\nThe work of Libet and Wegner has nevertheless raised interesting\nand challenging questions concerning the role of consciousness in\nagency. Proponents of the standard theory often qualify the view\nwith the claim that the relevant mental attitudes need not be\nconsciously accessed in order to play the right role in the exercise\nof agency. When, for instance, Davidson (1978: 85\u201386)\nconsidered the example of an agent who adds some spice to a stew with\nthe intention of improving the taste, he claimed that intentional\nagency requires only that the agent would have reasoned on\nthe basis of the relevant attitudes that the action is to be\nperformed, had he been aware of those attitudes at the\ntime. Few, though, would be prepared to accept the view that all of\nour actions might be like this: initiated and guided by attitudes\nthat are not consciously accessed at the time. This raises various\nquestions that are rarely addressed. How often, or in what kinds of\ncases, should actions be preceded by conscious intentions or\nconscious reasoning? What kind of consciousness is required? In cases\nwhere the relevant attitudes are not consciously accessed, must they\nbe accessible? And so forth.[21]\n",
