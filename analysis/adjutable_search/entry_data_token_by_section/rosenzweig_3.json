    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || \u201cThe Oldest System-Program of German Idealism\u201d\n1.3 \u201cThe Oldest System-Program of German Idealism\u201d\n\n\nWhile still at work on Hegel und der Staat in 1913,\nRosenzweig made a scholarly discovery which led him\u2014and\nscholars of German Idealism after him\u2014to rethink the origins of\nGerman Idealism, and which at once precipitated a controversy in the\nfield that continues to this day. Earlier that year, the Prussian Royal\nLibrary in Berlin had acquired a fragment of a text, written by Hegel,\ngiven the title \u201cAn Ethics,\u201d because these were the\ntext\u2019s first two words. But a study of the fragment\u2019s\ncontent convinced Rosenzweig that the text was no narrow investigation\nof a particular field of philosophy, i.e., ethics, but rather took up\nthe very task that would later define German Idealism for posterity:\nthe task of system. Indeed, the text revealed its author committed to\nconstructing \u201ca complete system of all ideas or, what is the\nsame, of all practical postulates\u201d; it claims to find the point\nof unity for the distinct philosophical domains of nature and freedom\nin the aesthetic act; it calls for a new mythology in the service of a\nnew religion which would unify the enlightened and unenlightened\ntogether in \u201cthe last great work of humankind.\u201d Utilizing a\nmethod of dating Hegelian manuscripts introduced by Dilthey and Nohl,\nby which manuscripts could be dated according to landmarks in the\ndevelopment of Hegel\u2019s handwriting, Rosenzweig determined the\ntext to have been written in the early summer months of 1796. This led\nRosenzweig to conclude that he had found, in this fragment, the\n\u201cOldest System-Program of German Idealism,\u201d an explicit\narticulation of the defining task of German Idealism, written\n\u201cthree or at least two years before that work which up to now has\ncounted \u2026 as the first systematic attempt of the idealistic\nmovement \u2026 to bound the whole philosophical world between the\ncovers of a book, Schelling\u2019s [System of]\nTranscendental Idealism.\u201d\n\n\nIn his study of the fragment he found, moreover, Rosenzweig reached\na further controversial conclusion. If the text was to be dated in the early summer of 1796, as\nHegel\u2019s handwriting suggested, this\nwould place the writing of the text at the very moment in Hegel\u2019s\nlife when, according to Rosenzweig, he was in the midst of his\nmelancholic despair over the possibility of reconciling the\nsubjectivity of the free self with the objectivity of the world. If\nthis were the case, Rosenzweig reasoned, Hegel couldn\u2019t\npossibly have been the author of the text. \u201cOnly one person in\nthe philosophical Germany of 1796 possessed this youthful-victorious\ntone\u201d that pervades the text-fragment, Rosenzweig determined, and\nthat person was Hegel\u2019s friend and former fellow-student at the\nT\u00fcbinger Stift, F.W.J Schelling. In all likelihood, surmised\nRosenzweig, Schelling had sent or shown an original version of the text\nto Hegel, who, in turn, had copied it over for future perusal. The\noriginal had since been lost, and only Hegel\u2019s copy remained.\nSince the existing copy was in Hegel\u2019s handwriting, Rosenzweig\nconcluded, the text had mistakenly been assigned to Hegel himself. In\nRosenzweig\u2019s \u201cOldest System-Program of German\nIdealism,\u201d an article he wrote in 1914 and published in 1917,\nRosenzweig presented the two-page text, together with a demonstration\nof his conclusions and a determination of the position the text might\nbe said to occupy within Schelling\u2019s early writings.\nRosenzweig\u2019s presentation received high praise from its initial\nreviewers, but his conclusions about the text\u2014and about\nSchelling\u2019s authorship, in particular\u2014have been hotly\ncontested ever since. Although no scholarly consensus has yet been\nreached regarding the actual author of the fragment\u2014whether it\nbe Hegel himself, Schelling, H\u00f6lderlin, or perhaps yet another\nfigure in their circles\u2014scholars have generally come to\nquestion the supposition that Hegel suffered from a depression during\nthe late 1790s that would rule him out as its author.\n",
