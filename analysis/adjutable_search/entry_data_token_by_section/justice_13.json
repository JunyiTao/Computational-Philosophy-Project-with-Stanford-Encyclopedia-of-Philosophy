    "main_text": "The Scope of Justice || Individuals vs Institutions\n3.3 Individuals vs Institutions\n\nOnce institutions are established for the purpose (among other things)\nof delivering justice on a large scale, we can ask what duties of\njustice individual people have in consequence. Is their duty simply to\nsupport the institutions, and comply with whatever rules of conduct\napply to them personally? Or do they have further duties to promote\njustice by acting directly on the relevant principles in their daily\nlives? No one doubts that some duties of justice fall\ndirectly on individuals, for example duties not to deceive or defraud\nwhen engaging in commercial transactions (and duties of corrective\njustice where behaviour is faulty), or duties to carry out one\u2019s\nfair share of an informally organized project from which one expects\nto benefit, such as cleaning up the neighbourhood park. Others fall on\nthem because they are performing a role within a social institution,\nfor example the duty of an employer not to discriminate on grounds of\nrace or gender when hiring workers, or the duty of a local government\nofficer to assign public housing to those in greatest need. But what\nis much more in dispute is whether individual people have more\nextensive duties to promote social justice (for contrasting views, see\nCohen 2008, ch. 3, Murphy 1998, Rawls 1993, Lecture VII, Young 2011,\nch. 2).\n\nConsider two cases: the first concerns parents who confer advantages\non their children in ways that undermine fair equality of opportunity.\nIf the latter principle of justice requires, to cite Rawls, that\n\u2018those who have the same level of talent and ability and the\nsame willingness to use these gifts should have the same prospects of\nsuccess regardless of their social class of origin\u2019 (Rawls 2001,\np. 44) then there are myriad ways in which some parents can bestow\nadvantages on their children that other parents cannot \u2013\nfinancial benefits, educational opportunities, social contacts, and so\nforth \u2013 that are likely to bring greater success in later life.\nAre parents therefore constrained as a matter of justice to avoid\nconferring at least some of these advantages, or are they free to\nbenefit their children as they choose, leaving the pursuit of equal\nopportunities entirely in the hands of the state (for a careful\nanalysis, see Brighouse and Swift 2014)?\n\nThe second example concerns wage differentials. Might individuals\nwhose talents can bring them high rewards in the labour market have a\nduty not to make use of their bargaining power, but instead be willing\nto work for a fair wage \u2013 which if fairness is understood in\negalitarian terms might mean the same wage as everyone else (perhaps\nwith extra compensation for those whose labour is unusually\nburdensome)? Rawls, as we saw above, argued that economic justice\nmeant arranging social and economic inequalities to the greatest\nbenefit of the least advantaged, and in formulating the principle in\nthis way he assumed that some inequalities might serve as incentives\nto greater production that would also raise the position of the\nworst-off group in society. But if individuals were willing to forego\nincentives, and so economic inequalities served no useful purpose,\nthen the arrangement that worked to the greatest benefit of the\n(otherwise) least advantaged would be one of strict equality. Cohen\n(2008) argues that Rawls\u2019 position is internally inconsistent.\nAs citizens designing our institutions we are supposed to be guided by\nthe difference principle, but as private actors in the marketplace, we\nare permitted to ignore that principle and bargain for higher wages,\neven though doing so will work to the disadvantage of the worst-off\ngroup. Justice, according to Cohen, requires us to embrace an ethos of\nservice that disdains material incentives.\n\nWhy might we hesitate before agreeing that in cases such as these,\njustice requires people to refrain from doing things that they are\npermitted to do by the public rules of their society (passing on\nbenefits to their children; seeking higher wages)? One reason is that\nthe refraining is only going to have a significant effect if it is\npractised on a large scale, and individuals have no assurance that\nothers will follow their example; meanwhile they (or their children)\nwill lose out relative to the less scrupulous. A connected reason has\nto do with publicity: it may be hard to detect whether people are\nfollowing the required ethos or not (see Williams 1998). Is the person\nwho sends her child to a private school because she claims he has\nspecial needs that the local state school cannot meet being sincere,\nor is she just trying to buy him comparative advantage? How can we\ntell whether the person who claims more money, but merely, he says, as\ncompensation for the unusual stress that his work involves, is\nreporting honestly? (for Cohen\u2019s response, see Cohen 2008, ch.\n8) It appears, then, that there are principles of justice that apply\nto what Rawls calls \u2018the basic structure of society [as] a\npublic system of rules\u2019 that do not apply in the same way to the\npersonal behaviour of the individuals who live within that structure.\nAttending to the scope, as well as the content, of\njustice is important.\n",
