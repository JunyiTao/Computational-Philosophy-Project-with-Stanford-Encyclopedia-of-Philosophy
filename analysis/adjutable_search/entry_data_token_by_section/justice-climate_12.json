Many hold that, at the moment, some greenhouse gases can\nnonetheless be permissibly emitted. There is, then, a question about\nhow the use of the remaining \u201cgreenhouse gas budget\u201d can\nbe distributed and among whom. As we have seen the size of the budget\ndepends in part on what temperature target is selected and how risk\naverse we think we should be. To illustrate: the Fifth Assessment\nReport of the IPCC reported that if we want to have a probability of\nat least 67% of avoiding a more than 1.5\u00b0C increase in global mean\ntemperatures then there is a budget of approximately 420\nGtCO2 (Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang 2019: 108). (If we\noperate with a less ambitious target then the budget is quite\ndifferent. See table 2.2 in Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang [2019:\n108].)\n\nOne key question then is, \u201cHow should this budget be\nshared?\u201d What principles of distributive justice should be\napplied to this \u201cgood\u201d?\n",
