    "preamble": "\n\n\nQualia inversion thought experiments are ubiquitous in contemporary\nphilosophy of mind (largely due to the influence of Shoemaker 1982 and\nBlock 1990). The most popular kind is one or another variant of Locke\u2019s\nhypothetical case of \u201cspectrum inversion\u201d, in which\nstrawberries and ripe tomatoes produce visual experiences of the sort\nthat are actually produced by grass and cucumbers, grass and cucumbers\nproduce experiences of the sort that are actually produced by\nstrawberries and ripe tomatoes, and so on. This entry surveys the main\nphilosophical applications of what Dennett has called \u201cone of\nphilosophy\u2019s most virulent memes\u201d (1991, 389).\n\n\nSection 1 explains what \u201cqualia\u201d are supposed to be.\nSection 2 describes the many different sorts of \u201cinverted\nqualia\u201d (specifically, \u201cinverted spectrum\u201d) thought\nexperiments, including a close cousin that does not involve inversion.\nSection 3 discusses the major philosophical arguments that appeal to\nspectrum inversion.\n\n\nThis article is long and goes into intricate details that some readers\nwill wish to ignore. Those wanting a shorter introduction should read\nsection 1 (skipping subsection 1.1), section 2 (subsections 2.1, 2.2,\n2.3), and subsection 3.1. (Another shorter introduction is Ross 2020.)\nThose new to the topic should first read the entry on\n qualia.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Qualia\n\n\nQualia (singular \u2018quale\u2019), in a common modern usage, are\nproperties of experiences that type them in phenomenological respects.\nImagine seeing three colored patches against a neutral background in\ngood light, one after the other. In particular, imagine seeing a\nvermilion patch, then a crimson patch, and finally a turquoise patch.\n(Those with poor imaginations may consult Figure 1.)\n\n\nFigure 1:\nvermilion, crimson, and turquoise patches\n\n\n\nThree experiences of the imagined sort differ in their\nphenomenology, or in \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to undergo them. What\nit\u2019s like to see the crimson patch is not the same as what it\u2019s like to\nsee the turquoise patch, for example. Further\u2014assuming you have\nnormal color vision\u2014seeing the crimson patch is more similar,\nin phenomenological respects, to seeing the vermilion patch than it is\nto seeing the turquoise patch.\n\n\nThus your experience of the crimson patch has a quale (call it\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019) that your experiences of\nthe vermilion and turquoise patches lack. Your experience of the\nvermilion patch has a quale \\((Q_{V})\\) that your\nexperiences of the crimson and turquoise patches lack; likewise, your\nexperience of the turquoise patch has quale\n\\(Q_{T}\\). What about an experience of all three\npatches, as when viewing the whole of figure 1? Which of\n\\(Q_{C}, Q_{V}\\), and\n\\(Q_{T}\\) does that have? The answer usually\nimplicit in the literature is \u2018All three\u2019 (as opposed to\n \u2018None\u2019).[1]\n This is probably the more natural way of\nunderstanding qualia terminology, given the explanation so far, and is\nthe one adopted in this article.\n\n\nIn addition to the quale \\(Q_{C}\\), your\nexperience of the crimson patch has quale\n\\(Q_{R}\\) which it shares with your experiences\nof the vermilion patch, blood, fire trucks, strawberries, ripe\ntomatoes, and so on. Your experience of the turquoise patch (in\nisolation) lacks \\(Q_{R}\\).\n\n\nIt must be emphasized that\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019, for example, is not\nexplicitly defined using color terminology.\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019 is not stipulated to be\nan abbreviation of \u2018the property of being an experience of\nsomething\u2019s looking crimson\u2019, for instance. Rather, the role of\ndescriptions like the latter is simply to draw attention to the salient\nproperty that \u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019 is supposed\nto be a name for, in much the same way that one might introduce the\nunfamiliar name \u2018Eugene Cernan\u2019 by saying that it refers to\nthe last man to walk on the moon. In the jargon, the description\n\u2018the property of being an experience of something\u2019s looking\ncrimson\u2019 can be used to fix the reference of\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019. (See the entry on\n reference.)\n\n\nQualia terminology can be introduced in a similar manner for other\nsorts of visual experiences (seeing differently shaped patches, for\ninstance), for other perceptual modalities, for bodily sensations, and\nfor thoughts, imagery, emotions, and so forth. It is controversial\nwhether some of these mental events/states have qualia\u2014in\nparticular, episodes of conscious thought, at least some of which seem\ndevoid of\n phenomenology.[2]\n\n\nOne might wonder why some special terminology is required.\nAdmittedly \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, for example,\nis not defined in terms of \u2018red\u2019, but isn\u2019t\n\\(Q_{R}\\) in fact the property of being an\nexperience of something\u2019s looking\n red?[3]\n And if it is, why\nintroduce another name? However, as discussed later (subsection 3.2),\nthere is an argument against this identification.\n1.1 Other uses of \u2018qualia\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Qualia\u2019 is an especially confusing piece of\nterminology, even by the standards of the profession that brought us\n\u2018realism\u2019. In the sense just explained, the claim that\nexperiences have qualia seems fairly\n harmless.[4]\n The innocent student\nmight well be puzzled, then, to learn of Frank Jackson\u2019s controversial\n\u201cknowledge argument for qualia\u201d (Jackson 1982), and\nDennett\u2019s attempt to dismiss qualia as a philosopher\u2019s invention\n(Dennett 1988). But on closer examination, much of this apparent\ndisagreement is merely terminological. On Jackson\u2019s use of the term,\nqualia are properties of mental states \u201cwhich no amount of purely\nphysical information includes\u201d (1982, 273); on Dennett\u2019s, they\nare \u201cineffable\u201d, \u201cintrinsic\u201d,\n\u201cprivate\u201d, and \u201cdirectly or immediately apprehensible\nin consciousness\u201d (1988, 229; cf. Tye 2002, 447). And none of\nthis is part of the official explanation of \u2018qualia\u2019 in the\nprevious section.\n\n\nAnother use of \u2018qualia\u2019 that is particularly important\nto distinguish from the present one is Dretske\u2019s. According to Dretske,\nqualia include colors\u2014properties of objects like\ntomatoes, not experiences. This is because he explains qualia as\n\u201cthe ways objects phenomenally appear or seem\u201d (1995, 73),\nand red is one way that tomatoes\n appear.[5]\n Qualia, on Dretske\u2019s\nuse, are properties of objects of experiences; in this article\nqualia are properties of experiences.\n\n\nThe American pragmatist C. I. Lewis introduced \u2018qualia\u2019\ninto contemporary\n philosophy.[6]\n Qualia, he explains in Mind and the\nWorld Order, are \u201crecognizable qualitative characters of the\ngiven\u201d (1929, 121). According to Lewis, what is\n\u201cgiven\u201d in experience are sense-data (although Lewis\nhimself preferred other terminology: see 55\u20137), not objects like\ntomatoes. Goodman\u2019s well-known discussion of qualia in The\nStructure of Appearance (1951) follows Lewis\u2019s use. Among\nJackson, Dennett, and Dretske, Dretske\u2019s use of \u2018qualia\u2019 is\nthe closest to Lewis\u2019s. Restricting attention to the case of veridical\nperception, we may think of Dretske as basically agreeing with Lewis\nabout the characterization of qualia, but disagreeing with Lewis about\nthe given. When one sees that a tomato is red, according to Lewis a\nsense-datum, not the tomato, is given; according to Dretske what is\ngiven is the tomato. So, since a \u201crecognizable qualitative\ncharacter\u201d of the tomato is its color, Dretske thinks that colors\nare examples of\n qualia.[7]\n2. Inverted qualia scenarios\n\n\nLet us say that a scenario is a (more-or-less detailed)\nstory, which may be possible or impossible. (So, for example, there is\na scenario in which someone squares the circle.) Corresponding to a\nscenario is what we can call a hypothesis: that the scenario\nis possible. So, for example, the hypothesis corresponding to\na circle-squaring scenario is false. There are a variety of\n\u201cinverted qualia\u201d scenarios in the literature\u2014almost \nalways involving color perception\u2014whose corresponding\nhypotheses differ in plausibility. These hypotheses are used as\npremises in a number of philosophical arguments, discussed in section 3\nbelow.\n2.1 A Simple Inverted Qualia Scenario\n\n\nConsider the hue circle in figure 2, taken from the Natural Color\nSystem color space, which is organized around the four hues red, green,\nblue, and\n yellow.[8]\n These are the unique hues:\nthey have shades that are not perceptual mixtures of any other hue. For\nexample, there is a shade of green that is neither bluish nor\nyellowish. The other hues are binary: all of their shades are\nperceptual mixtures of two unique hues. For example, every shade of\npurple is bluish and reddish. The four unique hues\u2014yellow, red,\nblue, green\u2014come in two opponent pairs: red-green and\nblue-yellow. Red is opposed to green in the sense that there are no\nreddish-greens or greenish-reds; likewise there are no bluish-yellows\nor yellowish-blues. The unique hues are equally spaced around the NCS\ncircle, and the other hues are spaced according to their perceptible\nproportion of the unique hues. So, for example, the orange patch\nequidistant from the unique yellow pole and unique red pole is equally\nsimilar to both.\n\n\nFigure 2:\nNCS hue circle[9]\n\n\n\nLet \\(I\\) be the function that takes each shade to its opposing\nshade, thus rotating the hue circle 180\u00b0. \\(I\\) maps reds to\ngreens, blues to yellows, bluish-greens to yellowish-reds, and so on\n(see figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3:\nthe function \\(I\\)\n\n\n\nIntroduce another perceiver, Invert (you are Nonvert). Imagine you\nare looking at scene \\(S\\): an arrangement of some fruits (see the\nleft-hand part of figure 4). Now take the apparent hues of objects in\n\\(S\\), and transform them using the function \\(I\\). Use this\ntransformation to create a new scene \\(S_{I}\\), exactly\nlike the old scene \\(S\\) except that it looks to have differently\ncolored \u201cinverted\u201d fruits (etc.). That is, if a banana\noriginally looks to have hue \\(h\\), in \\(S_{I}\\) it\nlooks to have hue \\(I(h)\\). (See the right-hand part of\nfigure 4; notice that the greens in \\(S\\) are rather yellowish,\nand hence get mapped to bluish-reds.) Then one simple inverted qualia\nscenario is this: what it\u2019s like for Invert to look at \\(S\\) is\nexactly the same as what it\u2019s like for Nonvert (i.e., you) to look at\n\\(S_{I}\\), and similarly for all other scenes that Invert\nencounters. According to this scenario, if you look at the right-hand\npart of figure 4, your experience is phenomenologically the same as\nInvert\u2019s experience when she looks at the left-hand part of figure 4.\nIn qualia terminology: if an object \\(O_{1}\\) looks to\nhave hue \\(h\\) to Nonvert (with \\(Q\\) being the corresponding\nquale of her experience), and \\(O_{2}\\) looks to have hue\n\\(I(h)\\) (with corresponding quale \\(Q^*\\)), then\nInvert\u2019s experience of \\(O_{1}\\) has quale \\(Q^*\\) and\nher experience of \\(O_{2}\\) has quale \\(Q\\). In this\nsense Invert\u2019s qualia are \u2018inverted\u2019 with respect to\nNonvert\u2019s.\n\n\nFigure 4:\n180\u00b0 hue inversion\n\n\n\nBecause the example concerns color qualia, this sort of inverted\nqualia scenario is usually described as a case of \u201cspectrum\ninversion\u201d. (Note that the 180\u00b0 inversion takes unique hues\nto unique hues, and binary hues to binary hues. An inversion scenario\nproduced by a rotation of 45\u00b0 would take the unique hue red to the\nbinary hue orange; and so presumably would be behaviorally detectable:\nsee subsection 2.3.1 below.)\n\n\nPhilosophy is stuck with the terminology of \u2018spectrum\ninversion\u2019, but it is potentially\n misleading.[10]\n First, a\nspectrum inversion scenario sounds like one which inverts either the\nspectrum or the colors of objects, but it actually inverts neither. In\na typical spectrum inversion scenario, the spectral band 650\u2013700nm\nremains red, and lemons remain\n yellow.[11]\n\n\nSecond, even when properly taken as an inversion of experiences, one\nmight suppose that the \u201cspectrum inversion\u201d function\ncorresponds to flipping the spectrum over. That is, using the\ntraditional names for the spectral bands, one might suppose the\nfunction maps red to violet, orange to indigo, yellow to blue, green to\ngreen, blue to yellow, indigo to orange, and violet to red. However,\nthis is not the usual sort of inversion scenario (red is not mapped to\ngreen, for example). Further, this function is not defined for all\nhues. Many hues\u2014in particular, a large range of\n\u201cextra-spectral\u201d purples\u2014are not found in the\nspectrum.\n2.2 Locke\u2019s Inverted Spectrum Scenario\n\n\nLocke appears to have been the first to formulate explicitly an\ninverted spectrum scenario. (An immediate precursor is \nMalebranche.[12]) \nIn the chapter of the Essay titled\nOf True and False Ideas, Locke writes:\nNeither would it carry any Imputation of Falshood\nto our simple Ideas, \\(if\\) by the different Structure of\nour Organs, it were so ordered, That the same Object should produce\nin several Men\u2019s Minds different Ideas at the same time;\nv.g. if the Idea, that a Violet produced in\none Man\u2019s Mind by his Eyes, were the same that a Marigold\nproduces in another Man\u2019s, and vice vers\u00e2. For since\nthis could never be known: because one Man\u2019s Mind could not pass into\nanother Man\u2019s Body, to perceive, what Appearances were produced by\nthose Organs; neither the Ideas hereby, nor the Names, would\nbe at all confounded, or any Falshood be in either. For all\nThings, that had the Texture of a Violet, producing constantly\nthe Idea, which he called Blue, and those which had\nthe Texture of a Marigold, producing constantly the\nIdea, which he as constantly called Yellow, whatever\nthose Appearances were in his Mind; he would be able as regularly to\ndistinguish Things for his Use by those Appearances, and understand,\nand signify those distinctions, marked by the Names Blue and\nYellow, as if the Appearances, or Ideas in his Mind,\nreceived from those two Flowers, were exactly the same, with the\nIdeas in other Men\u2019s Minds. (1689/1975, II, xxxii,\n15)\n\n\nLocke\u2019s description of this inverted spectrum scenario is laden with\nhis own commitment to \u201cIdeas\u201d, which (on one\ninterpretation) are sense-data, some of which possess both color and\n shape.[13]\n On this view, spectrum inversion is a case\nof \u201csense-datum inversion\u201d: when Invert looks at a violet\nshe becomes acquainted with the kind of sense-datum Nonvert is\nacquainted with when he looks at a marigold. Setting this tendentious\ntheoretical gloss aside, Locke\u2019s scenario has three notable features.\nFirst, it is a case of spectrum inversion from birth. Second,\nit is a case of inversion within the same linguistic\ncommunity. Third, it is (or is naturally read as being) a case in\nwhich Invert and Nonvert are behaviorally alike\u2014a\nbehaviorally undetectable spectrum inversion.\n\n\nLocke does not fill in the details of his scenario, so it is left\nunclear whether, for example, the leaves of marigolds and violets would\nproduce \u201cRed Ideas\u201d in the mind of the inverted subject.\nBut suppose, reasonably enough, that Locke\u2019s scenario involved a\nrotation of the hue circle. Locke evidently thought that the hypothesis\ncorresponding to his scenario was true: that his scenario is possible.\nWas he right?\n\n\nIf we assume that Invert is otherwise like a normal human perceiver,\nthen a major asymmetry in color space shows that Locke was incorrect.\nHue (red, green, bluish-red, etc.) is not the only perceptually salient\ndimension along which colors can vary: there are (usually taken to be)\ntwo other dimensions, saturation and\n lightness.[14]\n A color is saturated to the extent to\nwhich its hue is intense or vivid: pastels are desaturated, and\nachromatic colors (blacks, whites, and grays) have no saturation.\nColors become lighter as they become less grayish or blackened.\nArranging the colors along these three dimensions produces a color\nsolid, an example of which is shown in figure 5:\n\n\nFigure 5:\n3D color space: the Munsell color solid[15]\n\n\n\n\nThe lightness dimension corresponds to the central vertical axis,\nwith white at the top. The hue and saturation dimensions correspond,\nrespectively, to the angle around the vertical axis, and to the\ndistance from it. Thus the shades of maximum saturation are on the\noutside of the solid. Notice that the yellows have their maximum\nsaturation at higher levels of lightness than the reds and the blues.\nSo, assuming that Invert\u2019s judgments of the relations between colors\nare\u2014modulo the inversion\u2014normal, a possible Lockean\n180\u00b0 hue rotation scenario would be behaviorally detectable. Invert\nwould judge the maximally saturated colors she calls \u2018shades of\nblue\u2019 to be lighter than the maximally saturated colors she calls\n\u2018shades of yellow\u2019. Further, there are more distinguishable\nhue steps between blue and red than there are between yellow and \ngreen\u2014a fact that is reflected in the Munsell space, whose hue circle\nhas five hues equally spaced: red, yellow, green, blue, purple.\n(Contrast the NCS space mentioned in the previous subsection.) Hence\nthe Lockean inversion function \\(I\\), assuming it is defined on\nall hues, would map some distinct hues (in particular, some bluish\nreds) to the same hue (in particular, the same yellowish green). The\nrange of \\(I\\) would therefore contain fewer hues than its domain.\nInvert would not be able to distinguish some stimuli (those she calls\n\u2018bluish red\u2019) that Nonvert could tell apart, and so again\nthe inversion would be behaviorally detectable.\n2.3 Other Inverted Spectrum Scenarios\n2.3.1 Behaviorally Undetectable Scenarios\n\n\nAs discussed in section 3 below, inverted spectrum scenarios have a\nwide range of philosophical uses, and come in a correspondingly wide\nrange of flavors. It is not always required, for example, that Invert\nand Nonvert are behaviorally alike. But suppose that a behaviorally\nundetectable scenario is needed, and moreover one that is genuinely\npossible. With the assumption that Invert is otherwise normal, we just\nsaw that Locke\u2019s behaviorally undetectable scenario is not possible.\nWithout relaxing the simple assumption about Invert, can we find one\nthat is?\n\n\nSuppose we stay with the full range of normal human color\nexperience, and so with the color solid as illustrated in figure 5. The\ndiscussion of Locke\u2019s scenario shows that a scenario corresponding to a\nrotation of the color solid around the lightness axis should be\navoided. However, as Palmer points out (1999a, 926), there are three\ninversion scenarios that at least solve the problem posed by the light\nand saturated yellows. These three scenarios correspond to,\nrespectively, a reversal of the red-green axis; a reversal of the\nblue-yellow and black-white axes; and the previous two reversals taken\ntogether: a reversal of the red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white\naxes. These three scenarios are (approximately) illustrated in Figure 6\nbelow.\n\n\nFigure 6:\nthree inversions: red-green (top right); blue-yellow/black-white (bottom left);\nred-green/blue-yellow/black-white (bottom right)\n\n\n\nAs noted in the previous subsection, there are more perceptually\ndistinguishable shades between red and blue than there are between\ngreen and yellow, which would make red-green inversion behaviorally\n detectable.[16]\n And there are yet further asymmetries.\nDark yellow is brown (qualitatively different from yellow), whereas\ndark blue is blue (see figure 6). Similarly, desaturated bluish-red is\npink (qualitatively different from saturated bluish-red), whereas\ndesaturated greenish-yellow is similar to saturated greenish-yellow.\nAgain, red is a \u201cwarm\u201d color, whereas blue is\n\u201ccool\u201d\u2014and perhaps this is not a matter of learned\nassociations with temperature (see Hardin 1997, 297\u20137). In any event,\nthere is clearly scope to resist the claim that one of Palmer\u2019s three\ninversions would be behaviorally\n undetectable.[17]\n\n\nFaced with these difficulties, philosophers seeking a clearly\npossible behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario have either\nconsidered a perceiver with limited color vision (for instance\nblack-white vision), or else a perceiver with alien/quasi color vision,\nwhere any alien/quasi color space that represents perceptible\nsimilarities and differences is stipulated to have appropriate\nsymmetries. Here is Shoemaker trying the first strategy:\nBut even if our color experience is not in fact such that a\nmapping of this [behaviorally undetectable] sort is possible, it seems\nto me conceivable that it might have been\u2014and that is what\nmatters for our present philosophical purposes. For example, I think we\nknow well enough what it would be like to see the world\nnonchromatically, i.e., in black, white, and the various shades of \ngrey\u2014for we frequently do see it in this way in photographs, moving\npictures, and television. And there is an obvious mapping of the\nnonchromatic shades onto each other which satisfies the conditions for\ninversion. In the discussion that follows I shall assume, for\nconvenience, that such a mapping is possible for the full range of\ncolors\u2014but I do not think that anything essential turns on\nwhether this assumption is correct. (Shoemaker 1975a, 196; note\nomitted).\n\n\nFor some responses, see Tye 1995, 205, and Hilbert and Kalderon 2000,\n206. \u201cBlack-white\u201d inversion is also discussed by Clark\n(1996) (Other Internet Resources), Myin (2001) and Broackes (2007), and was briefly\nmentioned by Wittgenstein (1977,\n III-84).[18]\n For a short autobiography of a complete\nachromat (someone with only black-white rod vision) who is also a\nvision scientist, see Nordby 1996 (Other Internet\n Resources).[19]\n\n\nHere is Block trying the second strategy:\n[D]o the empirical issues really matter for the challenge\nthat the possibility of an inverted spectrum poses for functionalism?\nMy answer is: only in a subtle and indirect way. For if there could\nbe creatures who have color experience or at least visual\nexperience for whom the relevant empirical points do not apply, then\nfunctionalism is refuted even if human spectra cannot be\ninverted. For example, perhaps it is a consequence of the human genome\nthat humans tend to be unwilling to give a name to light green, even\nthough they are willing to give a name to light red\n(\u2018pink\u2019). Still, there could be people whose\nvisual experience is similar if not identical to ours who find it\nequally natural to give names to light green as to light red. (Perhaps\nwe could even genetically engineer humans to become so willing.) (Block\n1999, 946; cf. Shoemaker 1982, 336\u20138, and Levine 1991,\n34\u20136.)\n\n\nFor some doubts about the second strategy, see Hardin 1997,\n299\u2013300.\n\n\nHilbert and Kalderon argue that \u201cevery possible quality space\nmust be asymmetrical\u201d (2000, 204) (that is, must lack\nany symmetries); if so, both strategies are misguided (see also Dennett\n1991, 389\u201398; 1993, 927; 1994).\n2.3.2 Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Scenarios\n\n\nIf a behaviorally undetectable spectrum inversion scenario is\npossible, how do we know it does not actually obtain? There is a\ntemptation to say that we do not know\u2014moreover, that we cannot\nknow. (For more discussion, see subsection 3.6 below.) And if we cannot\nverify or falsify the claim that such a scenario does not obtain, then\naccording to the verificationist theory of meaning held by the logical\npositivists (Ayer 1959) the scenario is meaningless. Indeed, the\nlogical positivists sometimes gave spectrum inversion as an example of\nan unverifiable claim (Schlick 1932/3, 93, quoted in Shoemaker 1982,\n339; see also Ayer 1936, 173\u20134, and Wittgenstein 1958, \u00a7272).\n\n\nThe allegedly meaningless scenario is a case of\ninterpersonal (or intersubjective) spectrum inversion: Invert\nis spectrally inverted with respect to another person, Nonvert. But\nthere is another sort of inversion scenario, in which a single person\u2019s\nqualia are inverted with respect to her qualia at an earlier time. As\nShoemaker notes (1982, 327), a case of intrapersonal (or\nintrasubjective) spectrum inversion appears to have been first\ndiscussed by Wittgenstein:\nConsider this case: someone says \u2018I can\u2019t understand\nit, I see everything red blue today and vice versa.\u2019 We answer\n\u2018it must look queer!\u2019 He says it does and, e.g., goes on to\nsay how cold the glowing coal looks and how warm the clear (blue) sky.\nI think we should under these or similar circumstances be inclined to\nsay that he saw red what we saw blue. And again we should say that we\nknow that he means by the words \u2018blue\u2019 and\n\u2018red\u2019 what we do as he has always used them as we do.\n(Wittgenstein 1968, 284; quoted in Shoemaker 1982,\n 327\u20138)[20]\n\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein seems to have thought that a behaviorally\nundetectable interpersonal spectrum inversion scenario is not possible\n(arguably for verificationist reasons), Shoemaker claims that once the\npossibility of a Wittgensteinian intrapersonal inversion is\ngranted, there is an inexorable slide to the possibility of a\nbehaviorally undetectable interpersonal scenario:\n\u2026if the color experience of a person can differ from\nthat of others at some point during his career, it should be possible\nfor such a difference to exist throughout a person\u2019s career. But if\nthis a possibility, then it does seem perfectly coherent to suppose,\nand perfectly compatible with all the behavioral evidence we have about\nthe experiences of others, that, in Wittgenstein\u2019s words, \u201cone\nsection of mankind has one sensation of red and another section\nanother.\u201d (Shoemaker 1982,\n 329)[21]\n\n\nWe can think of this sort of argument as proceeding in four steps\n(see Block 1990, Shoemaker 1996b):\n\nStep 1: this is possible: an\n\u201covernight\u201d intrapersonal inversion, as in the quotation\nfrom Wittgenstein.\nStep 2: if (Step 1), then this is possible: an\n\u201covernight\u201d inversion followed by semantic adaptation\n(applying \u2018red\u2019 to glowing coal, \u2018blue\u2019 to the\nsky, etc.), but with memory of one\u2019s experiences before the inversion.\nThat is, one (re)learns to use color terminology like a normal person,\nwhile remembering that one\u2019s experiences of glowing coal (etc.) used to\nbe very different. The inversion remains detectable, because one\nasserts, for example, that one\u2019s experiences have drastically\nchanged.\nStep 3: if (Step 2), then this is possible: an\n\u201covernight\u201d inversion followed by semantic adaptation,\nfollowed by amnesia about one\u2019s past experiences, with the result that\none\u2019s pre- and post- inversion behavioral dispositions are the same. At\nthis step, one\u2019s behavior is just as it would have been if one had\nsimply been stricken with amnesia, with no prior inversion.\nStep 4: if (Step 3), then this is possible: a\n\u201cfrom birth\u201d behaviorally undetectable\ninterpersonal inversion scenario.\n\n\n\nSimilar arguments starting from a Wittgensteinian intrapersonal\nscenario can be given for the other kinds of interpersonal inversion\nhypotheses discussed in section 3 below.\n\n\nOne might think that at least step 4 is unproblematic. However,\naccording to the \u201cFrege-Schlick view\u201d (Shoemaker 1982,\n339), interpersonal comparisons of qualia (unlike\nintrapersonal comparisons) do not make sense. The\nFrege-Schlick view could be supported on verificationist grounds; for\na more interesting line of defense, see Stalnaker 1999, 2006, and\nShoemaker 2006b and Block 2007, 103\u20137, for discussion. Since it makes\nperfect sense (and indeed is often true) to say that tomatoes look red\nto most people, a proponent of the Frege-Schlick view must deny, for\nexample, that \\(Q_{R}\\) is the property of being\nan experience of something\u2019s looking red (see section 1 above and\nStalnaker 1999, 225).\n2.3.3 Inverted Earth\n\n\nAsymmetries in color space pose problems for step 3 of the previous\nargument. But\u2014especially for those with verificationist\nsympathies\u2014step 3 is problematic even if these concerns are\nwaived. Why be so sure that the \u201ctotal adaptation\u201d\n(semantic adaptation plus amnesia) doesn\u2019t reinvert the qualia? After\nall, if you imagine being the subject yourself, after the period of\namnesia you have no sense that anything is amiss\u2014so perhaps\nnothing is. Similar doubts can be raised about step 2: suppose you use\ncolor terminology exactly as you did before the step 1 \ninversion\u2014that is, spontaneously on the basis of how things \nlook\u2014but you seem to recall that your past experiences were radically\ndifferent. Would you be confident that you hadn\u2019t misremembered your\npast experiences? (See Dennett 1988; 1991, Ch. 12; 1993; 1994; and Rey\n1992.)\n\n\nAlthough Block thinks \u201cthat these criticisms can be defeated\non their own terms\u201d (1990, 61), his \u201cInverted Earth\u201d\nscenario is designed to sidestep them. (See Block 1990, 1996a,\n 2003.)[22]\n Instead of considering an\n\u201covernight\u201d inversion and the consequent confusion,\nsemantic adaptation and amnesia, your eyes are fitted with \u201ccolor\ninverting lenses\u201d and you are transported to another \nplanet\u2014Inverted Earth. This is a place just like Earth except that\neach object has \u201cthe complementary color of [its counterpart] on\nEarth. The sky is yellow, grass is red, fire hydrants are green,\netc.\u201d (1990, 60). The inhabitants also speak Color Inverted\nEnglish (\u2018red\u2019 means green, \u2018blue\u2019\nmeans yellow, etc.). The right hand part of figure 4 above\ndisplays a photograph of fruits taken on Inverted Earth with an\nordinary Earthly camera. (Despite the yellow sky, the illumination on\nInverted Earth is the same as it is on Earth. Note that achromatic\ncolors are not inverted\u2014on Inverted Earth snow is white and\ncoal is\n black.)[23]\n Because of the inverting lenses\u2014and \nignoring complications such as those mentioned in subsection \n2.3.1\u2014when you arrive on Inverted Earth you notice no visible change.\nYour experience when you look at an arrangement of fruits on Inverted\nEarth is phenomenologically the same as your previous experience of the\ncounterpart arrangement on Earth (see the left hand part of figure 4),\nand conversation with the locals proceeds just as smoothly as it did\nback on Earth. This scenario is therefore the converse of typical\ninverted spectrum scenarios: instead of keeping the environment fixed\nand varying the internal constitution of the subject, Inverted Earth\nvaries the environment and (due to the inverting lenses) keeps the\nsubject\u2019s internal constitution fixed. Block uses Inverted Earth in an\nargument against functionalism and representationalism (see subsections\n3.1 and 3.2\n below).[24]\n2.4 Shifted Qualia\n\n\nThe qualia inversion scenarios discussed so far are merely\nhypothetical\u2014more cautiously, we do not know whether any of\nthem\n obtain.[25]\n There are, however, \u201cshifted\u201d\nqualia scenarios that actually obtain. And, in fact, many of\nthe philosophical arguments that appeal to the possibility of an\ninversion scenario can make do instead by appealing to the actual\nshifted qualia scenario, hence avoiding potentially controversial\nclaims about possibility.\n\n\nThe shifted qualia scenario that is usually discussed \nconcerns\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014color vision. There is a substantial\namount of variation between people classified as having\n\u201cnormal\u201d color vision by standard tests, due to differences\nin the lens of the eye and photoreceptor pigments, among other factors.\nIn one experiment, introduced into the philosophical literature by\nHardin (1993, 79\u201380), Hurvich et al. (1968) found that the apparent\nlocation of unique green for spectral lights among 50 subjects varied\nfrom 490 to\n 520nm.[26]\n This is a large range: 15nm either side of\nunique green looks distinctly bluish or yellowish. For example, when\nSmith looks at the third patch in figure 7 (in isolation), his\nexperience might have the quale that Jones\u2019s experience has when she\nlooks at the fourth patch in Figure 7, keeping the viewing\ncircumstances fixed. And when Smith looks at the fourth patch, his\nexperience might have the quale that Jones\u2019s experience has when she\nlooks at the fifth patch. Thus\u2014at least over a small\nrange of hues\u2014Jones\u2019s and Smith\u2019s color qualia are\n\u201cshifted\u201d with respect to each other. Accordingly, this\nsort of scenario can be described as a case of \u201cshifted spectra\u201d\n(Block 1999). (NB: here we are assuming that the Frege-Schlick view\nmentioned in subsection 2.3.2 is incorrect.)\n\n\nFigure 7:\nfive patches: yellowish-green to bluish-green\n\n\n\nNotice that if a behaviorally undetectable scenario is wanted, an\nactual case of shifted spectra will not fit the bill.\n3. Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026\n\n\nInversion scenarios\u2014in particular, spectrum \ninversion\u2014turn up in a wide range of philosophical arguments, which we\nare now in a position to examine.\n3.1 \u2026Against Behaviorism, Functionalism, and Physicalism\n\nBehaviorism in the philosophy of mind is the view that the\nmental is nothing over and above behavior (including dispositions to\nbehave). Any version of behaviorism implies that the mental supervenes\non behavior. That is: necessarily, two creatures who are behaviorally\nalike are also mentally alike. Likewise, any version of\nfunctionalism or physicalism implies that the mental\nsupervenes on, respectively, functional organization and physical\nmakeup. For the purposes of this subsection, it is not necessary to\nget into the details of these theories. However, two points should be\nnoted. First, it should not be assumed that either behavior,\nfunctional organization, or physical makeup is an intrinsic \nmatter\u2014the relevant sorts of behavioral, functional, and physical\nproperties may be extrinsic.\n In other words,\nperfect duplicates may differ in behavioral, functional, or physical\n respects.[27]\n Second, as these theories are usually\nunderstood, difference in behavioral respects implies difference in\nfunctional respects, which in turn implies difference in physical\nrespects; none of the converse implications\n holds.[28]\n So the three\nsupervenience theses just mentioned are related as follows: the\nbehaviorist supervenience thesis implies the functionalist thesis,\nwhich in turn implies the physicalist thesis.\n\n\nIf some behaviorally undetectable inverted spectrum hypothesis is\ncorrect, then there could be a pair of creatures who are behaviorally\nalike but mentally different: Invert and Nonvert are in different\nmental states when they each look at a tomato, and are behaviorally\nalike. Hence, if the inverted spectrum hypothesis is correct,\nbehaviorism is false. This gives us an argument against\nbehaviorism:\n\nArgument Aa\n\nP1a.\nThe following spectrum inversion scenario is possible: Invert\nand Nonvert are behaviorally alike, and are both looking at a\n tomato.[29]\n\nSince P1a implies that the mental does not supervene on\nbehavior:\n\nCa.\n\nBehaviorism is false.\n\n\n\nSince behaviorism is not a popular position these days, this\napplication of an inverted qualia scenario is perhaps not so\ninteresting. And given the complications discussed in subsection 2.3.1,\nthere is even room for a behaviorist to resist. However, of\nconsiderably more interest are similar arguments against functionalism\n(and physicalism). Block and Fodor (1972), who invented the terminology\nof \u2018inverted qualia\u2019, were the first to formulate an\ninverted spectrum argument against functionalism, specifically Turing\nmachine functionalism as defended in Putnam\n 1967.[30]\n Ignoring the details\nof particular functionalisms, the argument is exactly parallel to the\none against behaviorism. (Similar remarks go for the inverted spectrum\nargument against physicalism.) According to functionalism, mental\nstates are functional states: states defined by their causal role with\nrespect to inputs, outputs, and other states. So, according to\nfunctionalism, necessarily, two creatures who are functionally alike\nare also mentally alike. In order to complete the argument, an\nappropriate inverted spectrum hypothesis must be established, where\nInvert and Nonvert are functional duplicates.\n\n\nThe anti-functionalist analogue of argument Aa is:\n\nArgument Ab\n\nP1b\n\nThe following spectrum inversion scenario is possible: Invert\nand Nonvert are functionally alike, and are both looking at a\ntomato.\n\n\nSince P1b implies that the mental does not supervene on functional\norganization:\n\nCb.\n\nFunctionalism is false.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of a behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario\n(P1a) can be motivated by appeal to the sorts of considerations\ndiscussed in 2.3.1 above. However, in order to refute functionalism a\nstronger inversion hypothesis (P1b) is needed. As Block and Fodor point\nout, functionalism allows us to deny that \u201ctwo organisms\nare in the same psychological state whenever their behaviors and/or\nbehavioral dispositions are identical\u201d (1972, 86), hence avoiding\nthe stock objections to behaviorism. The functionalist, then, has no\nproblem with behaviorally undetectable inversions. But why should she\nconcede the possibility of a functionally undetectable\ninversion? The question can be made more pointed by observing that (a)\nno one has ever articulated a detailed functionalist theory of any\nmental state, and (b) any realistic version of such a theory would be\nextremely\n complicated.[31]\n In favor of the possibility of a\nfunctionally undetectable inversion, Block and Fodor offer its\n\u201cconceptual coherence\u201d:\nIt seems to us that the standard verificationist\ncounterarguments against the view that the \u2018inverted\nspectrum\u2019 [scenario] is conceptually coherent are not persuasive.\nIf this is correct, it looks as though the possibility of qualia\ninversion poses a serious prima facie argument against functionalist\naccounts of the criteria for type identity of psychological states.\n(91)\n\n\nBlock and Fodor\u2019s apparent move from the \u201cconceptual\ncoherence\u201d of the inversion scenario to its possibility can be\nquestioned. Even though one cannot know a priori that not-p (that is, p\nis conceptually coherent), p may yet be impossible. For example, one\ncannot know a priori that gold does not have the atomic number 79, but\nit is a necessary truth that gold has this atomic number. (This sort of\nseparation between conceptual coherence and possibility is not\nuncontroversial, but is commonly\n accepted.[32])\n\n\nIn any case, there are other conceptually coherent scenarios that are\nconsiderably more straightforward than an inverted spectrum scenario,\nfor example a scenario containing a conscious subject and a functional\nduplicate who is not conscious at all (a \u201czombie\u201d, in the\nphilosophical sense). So if the move from conceptual coherence to\npossibility is in fact legitimate, functionalism may be refuted by a\nsimpler argument that does not have an inversion hypothesis as a\npremise. (Shoemaker is a notable dissenter on this point; he holds\nthat while inverted spectrum scenarios are conceptually coherent,\nzombie scenarios are not. See Shoemaker 1975a, 1981, 1991.)\n\n\nA defender of the utility of an inversion scenario in an argument\nagainst functionalism might reply that the scenario\u2019s possibility does\nnot merely rest on its conceptual coherence. In addition\u2014this\nreply continues\u2014there is a positive \u201cCartesian\nintuition\u201d that such an inversion scenario is possible (a\n\u201cclear and distinct idea\u201d of the scenario, perhaps), and\nthis is prima facie evidence that it \\(is\\) possible.\n\n\nHowever, Cartesian intuition, just like conceptual coherence, is not\na very discriminating weapon, tending to spread possibility over a wide\nlandscape (cf. Tye 2003, section 4). Cartesian intuition also tends to\ncertify the possibility of scenarios containing zombies, thinking\nrocks, entirely disembodied minds (not even embodied in ectoplasm), and\nso forth\u2014all impossibilities, according to the\nfunctionalist. So, as with conceptual coherence, any inverted spectrum\nargument against functionalism that relies on Cartesian intuitions can\nbe converted into an equally plausible and simpler argument that makes\nno mention of the inverted spectrum.\n\n\nThere is one other defense of the utility of inversion scenarios in\nanti-functionalist arguments, namely that some of them are\nbiologically possible\u2014and hence not as far fetched as\nscenarios containing zombies or thinking rocks. If this is right, then\nspectrum inversion would be of special significance, since we have a\nfirmer grip on possibilities that are closer to home.\n\n\nHere is it is helpful to examine Block\u2019s Inverted Earth argument\nagainst functionalism, which at a superficial glance might not seem to\nstray beyond the constraints of Earthly biology. As we saw in\nsubsection 2.3.3, the Inverted Earth scenario is designed to avoid\ncertain objections to the usual argument from intrapersonal inversion\nhypotheses to interpersonal inversion hypotheses. How is the scenario\nturned into an argument against functionalism?\n\n\nThe brand of functionalism (about qualia) that Block sets out to\nrefute is this:\nAn experience has [\\(Q_{R}\\)] if [and\nonly if] it functions in the right way\u2014if it is caused by red\nthings in the right circumstances, and used in thought about red things\nand action with respect to red things rightly. The functional roles I\nam talking about are what I call \u2018long-arm\u2019 roles, roles\nthat include real things in the world as the inputs and outputs. They\nare to be distinguished from the \u2018short-arm\u2019 roles that\nfunctionalists sometimes prefer, roles that stop at the skin. (1990,\n58, note\n omitted)[33]\n\n\nBlock then tries to establish that after a suitable period of time\non Inverted Earth, your beliefs and judgments about the colors of\nthings would be correct: like the locals, you would believe\nthat fire hydrants are green, the sky is yellow, and so on:\n[A]ccording to me, after enough time has passed on Inverted\nEarth, your embedding in the physical and linguistic environment of\nInverted Earth would dominate, and so your intentional contents would\nshift so as to be the same as those of the natives. Consider an analogy\n(supplied by Martin Davies): if you had a Margaret Thatcher\nrecognitional capacity before your journey to Inverted Earth, and on\narriving misidentify twin MT as MT, you are mistaken. But eventually\nyour \u2018That\u2019s MT\u2019 judgements get to be about twin MT, and so\nbecome right after having started out wrong. If you were [transported]\nat age 15, by the time 50 years have passed, you use \u2018red\u2019\nto mean green, just as the natives do. (64)\n\n\n(We can also add that you know that you are on Inverted Earth, and\nmake an effort to speak the local language; see Block 1996a, 42;\n2003.)\n\n\nThis step of the argument appeals to externalism about\nmental content (Putnam 1975, Burge 1979), specifically some sort of\ncausal covariational theory (see the entry\n externalism about mental content).\nPutting the basic idea crudely: after a while on Inverted Earth certain\nof your inner states that on Earth were reliably caused by the presence\nof red things and thereby represented redness will instead be reliably\ncaused by the presence of green things, and thereby will come to\nrepresent greenness.\n\n\nThis gives us an apparent counterexample against the \u201clong\narm\u201d functionalist theory. On Inverted Earth your experiences\nhave the functional role that the functionalist theory says is\nnecessary and sufficient for possessing\n\\(Q_{R}\\): they are \u201ccaused by red things in the\nright circumstances, and used in thought about red things and action\nwith respect to red things rightly\u201d. But on Inverted Earth your\nexperiences with this functional role have\n\\(Q_{G}\\), not (or not always)\n\\(Q_{R}\\).\n\n\nIf we insist that the Inverted Earth scenario is constrained by\nactual biology, can it still be maintained that your experiences caused\nby red things on Inverted Earth have the\n\\(Q_{R}\\)-role? That is not clear, even if we\ngrant Block\u2019s claim about the \u201cshift in intentional\ncontents\u201d without a corresponding change in qualia. The problem\nis twofold. First, because of asymmetries in color space and additional\ncomplications (see footnote 23),\n to say nothing of the details of the\n\u201cinverting lenses\u201d, your total functional organization\nwould certainly change in various respects after traveling to a\nbiologically possible Inverted Earth. Second, Block\u2019s description of\nthe long-arm functional theory is highly schematic. It may be that a\nsuitably sophisticated and developed form of this theory would not have\nthe consequence that, on a biologically possible Inverted Earth, your\nexperiences caused by red things have the\n\\(Q_{R}\\)-role. Similar points go for an argument\nagainst functionalism using a traditional inverted spectrum\nscenario.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Block does not rest very much\u2014if \nany\u2014weight on the biological possibility of the Inverted Earth\nscenario:\nBut what if the facts of human physiology get in the way of\nthe case as I described it? My response is the same as the one\nmentioned earlier (based on Shoemaker\u2019s rebuttal of Harrison), namely\nthat it is possible for there to be a race of people very much like us,\nwith color vision, and color sensations, but whose physiology does not\nrule out the case described (or spectrum inversion). The functionalist\ncan hardly be satisfied with the claim that our experiences are\nfunctional states but the other race\u2019s experiences are not. (1990,\n64)\n\n\nThis response concedes that the Inverted Earth argument against\nfunctionalism may need to appeal to more-or-less outlandish\npossibilities. And if it does, then since other possibilities not\ninvolving inversions, and arguably no more outlandish, will do just as\nwell, it is doubtful that Inverted Earth-type scenarios have an\nessential role to play in arguments against\n functionalism.[34]\n\n\nThe anti-physicalist inverted spectrum argument is:\n\nArgument Ac\n\nP1c.\n\nThe following spectrum inversion scenario is possible: Invert\nand Nonvert are physically alike, and are both looking at a\ntomato.\n\nSince P1c implies that the mental does not supervene on physical\nmakeup:\n\nCc.\n\nPhysicalism is false.\n\n\n\nAlthough there is some controversy about just how science-fictional\nanti-functionalist inversion scenarios need to be,\nanti-physicalist inversion scenarios are usually supposed to\nbe very remote from actuality, and their possibility is hotly disputed.\nAlmost uncontroversially: if an inverted spectrum argument against\nphysicalism works at all, then a simple zombie scenario will equally\nserve the\n purpose.[35]\n3.2 \u2026Against Representationalism\n\n\nIt is widely held that perceptual experiences represent the\nperceiver\u2019s environment as being a certain way. For example, the\nexperience of someone with normal color vision looking at figure 1\nrepresents (inter alia) her environment as containing a crimson,\nvermilion, and turquoise square. In the terminology of Chalmers 2004\n(slightly adapted), a representational property is a property\nof a mental state/event that specifies (perhaps only in part) the\nstate/event\u2019s representational content. For example, the property of\nbeing a visual experience that represents that there is a crimson\nsquare before one is a representational property (for a taxonomy of\nrepresentational properties, see Chalmers 2004, section 2). The basic\nidea of representationalism or intentionalism is that\nqualia are representational properties, or at least supervene on\nrepresentational properties. One advantage of representationalism is\nthat it appears to reduce \u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d (Block\n1995) to a certain kind of intentionality. Since the problem of\nproviding a naturalistic account of intentionality is often thought to\nbe tractable, representationalism brings the possibility of a\nnaturalistic account of consciousness (see, e.g., Dretske 1995, Lycan\n1996, Tye 2000, and Speaks 2015).[36]\n\n\nSpectrum inversion scenarios help to focus the dispute between\nrepresentationalists and their critics. (Actual cases of shifted\nspectra can also serve: see Block 1999.) Any version of\nrepresentationalism is committed to the following thesis. Consider a\ncase of red-green spectrum inversion, and imagine Invert and Nonvert\nare both looking at the red peppers depicted in figure 6, against a\nneutral background. Nonvert\u2019s experience has\n\\(Q_{R}\\), while Invert\u2019s experience has\n\\(Q_{G}\\). Because the two experiences have\ndifferent qualia, any version of representationalism implies that, if\nthis scenario is possible, the two experiences differ in\nrepresentational content. Hence, if the foregoing scenario can be\nfilled out so that (a) the two experiences have the same\ncontent and (b) the scenario is possible, then representationalism is\nrefuted.\n\n\nHow can these two desiderata be satisfied? Fortunately for the\nanti-representationalist\u2014or phenomenist (Block \n2003)\u2014the usual ways of trying to secure (a) do not require Invert\nand Nonvert to be behavioral duplicates (or, for that matter,\nfunctional duplicates). The anti-representationalist can therefore\ndismiss concerns that a behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario is\nimpossible.\n\n\nThe description of the anti-representationalist scenario is\ntypically completed with the following three features. First, Invert is\nable to use her color vision to reidentify objects, distinguish objects\nfrom their backgrounds, etc., with more-or-less the facility of\nNonvert. In Locke\u2019s phrase, Invert \u201cwould be able as regularly to\ndistinguish Things for [her] Use by those Appearances\u201d. Second,\nInvert has been spectrally inverted from birth (or at least for a long\nperiod of time). Third, Nonvert and Invert belong to the same\nlinguistic community: in particular, they use color vocabulary in the\nsame way, applying \u2018red\u2019 to tomatoes, \u2018yellow\u2019\nto bananas, and so forth.\n\n\nAssume that this scenario is possible (for an argument that it isn\u2019t,\nsee Sundstr\u00f6m 2002 and Gibbons 2005; for a reply see Littlejohn\n2009). The three features just mentioned are intended to support the\nview that this scenario is one in which, when Invert and Nonvert both\nlook at the fruits depicted in figure 6, their experiences have\nthe same representational properties. In particular (glossing\nover a complication to be discussed in subsection 3.3 below), the\nbanana looks yellow to both Invert and Nonvert, the\nstrawberries look red to both, and so on. So, assuming that\nbananas are yellow, strawberries are red, etc., neither Invert nor\nNonvert is suffering from some global color illusion. If this inverted\nspectrum hypothesis is correct, then qualia do not supervene on\nrepresentational properties, and therefore representationalism is\nfalse.\n\n\n(Here is one way of putting the Inverted Earth version of this\nargument (see subsections 2.3.3 and 3.1). After first arriving on\nInverted Earth, your word \u2018red\u2019 means red, and to\nyou the green peppers on Inverted Earth look red. But after a period of\nacclimatization, you come to speak the language of the locals, and your\nexperiences come to represent correctly the colors of things\u2014green \npeppers on Inverted Earth look green. Now compare your present\nexperience of a green pepper on Inverted Earth with your previous\nexperience of peppers of exactly that shade back on Earth. Same\ncontent, but different qualia. Alternatively, the\nanti-representationalist argument can proceed by exhibiting an example\nof the converse: same qualia, but different content\u2014see Block\n1990, 64\u20137.)\n\n\nThe three features of the anti-representationalist scenario can\nmotivate the conclusion that Invert is not systematically misperceiving\nthe colors of things as follows. First, because Invert\u2019s color vision\nis as useful as Nonvert\u2019s for discriminating and identifying objects,\nsurely it would be arbitrary to suppose that Invert\u2019s color vision, but\nnot Nonvert\u2019s, is the source of pervasive illusions. Second, because\nNonvert has been inverted since birth, a complicated system of causal\nconnections between the colors of objects in her environment and states\nof her visual system has been in place for a long period. In\nparticular, there is a reliable causal connection between the presence\nof a red object before Invert\u2019s eyes and a certain neural event\noccurring in Invert; this sort of causal connection is plausibly\nsufficient to bestow the property of representing redness on this type\nof neural event. Third, because Invert and Nonvert belong to the same\nlinguistic community, Invert\u2019s word \u2018red\u2019 means\nred. So when Invert says (as she does), \u2018Strawberries\nlook red to me\u2019, she means that strawberries look red to\nher. So, if strawberries do not look red to her, Invert is\nsystematically in error about how things look, and this result is not\n credible.[37]\n\n\nNaturally, each of these reasons for thinking that Invert is not\nmisperceiving the colors of objects can be questioned. Against the\nfirst, one might dispute the claim that it would be arbitrary to\nconvict only Invert of error\u2014after all, for all that\u2019s been\nsaid, Nonvert and Invert might differ functionally, which is presumably\na relevant difference. Against the second, there are well-known\nproblems for the \u201ccausal covariational\u201d account of mental\ncontent that it assumes (see, e.g., Fodor 1992, Ch. 3). Finally,\nagainst the third, it may be argued that the consequence that Invert is\nmistaken about the content of her experience is not unacceptable (Tye\n2002,\n 451).[38]\n\n\nIt will be useful to set out the anti-representationalist argument\nmore carefully. Assume as a suppressed premise that the inverted\nspectrum scenario just described is possible, and suppose that Invert\nand Nonvert are both looking at a ripe tomato in good light:\n\nArgument B\n\nP1.\n\nNeither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of the\ntomato.\nP2.\n\nThe tomato is red (and not any other color).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\nThe tomato looks the same color (namely, red) to both Invert and\nNonvert.\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal difference\nbetween Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the colors that\ntheir experiences represent the tomato as having.\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\n\n\n\nSome of the dialectic surrounding P1 has been described. In the\nfollowing three subsections, other ways of resisting the argument will\nbe discussed.\n\n\nIf Argument B is sound, tomatoes look red to both Invert and\nNonvert, although the corresponding qualia are different. This is why\nspectrum inversion was not described in subsection 2.1 as a case where\ntomatoes look green to Invert (and look red to\nNonvert). If spectrum inversion is explained in these terms, the\nthought experiment is quite unsuitable for anti-representationalist\npurposes.\n\n\nAccording to the (orthodox) representationalist, an experience has\n\\(Q_{B}\\), say, just in case it is an experience\nthat represents blue. According to the phenomenist who endorses\nArgument B, an experience has \\(Q_{B}\\) just in\ncase it has a certain non-representational property. Let us\nstipulate that \u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 refers to this non-representational property,\nif such a thing exists. Then the two views may be put as follows:\n\nPhenomenism\n\\(Q_{B} = B\\) (a certain nonrepresentational\nproperty).\n\nOrthodox representationalism\n\\(Q_{B}\\) = property of visually representing\nblue (i.e., being an experience of something\u2019s looking blue).\n\n\nThe sense-datum theory is usually taken to be a form of phenomenism;\nit will be treated as such\n here.[39]\n According to the sense-datum theorist, sense-data that are associated\nwith experiences of seeing the sky, lapis lazuli, cobalt glass, etc.,\nhave a distinctive property; the traditional sense-datum theorist took\nthis property to be the color blue (see, e.g., Moore 1953, 30, n.2),\nbut let us speak more neutrally and call it \u2018blue\\('\\)\u2019\n(Peacocke 1983, Ch. 1). Then, according to the sense-datum theorist,\nthe phenomenist equation can be spelled out more informatively\nthus:\nSense-data theory\n\\(Q_{B} = B\\) = being a sensing of a\nblue\\('\\) sense-datum.\n\nOrthodox phenomenists (for instance Block and Levine) have\nno truck with sense-data, and typically leave the phenomenist equation\nunadorned. However, the sense-datum theorist can offer the following\nconsideration in her favor.\n\n\nImagine two experiences: first, an experience (call it\n\u2018\\(e_{1}\\)\u2019) of a blue triangle next to a red\nsquare; second, an experience \\((e_{2})\\) of\na red triangle next to a blue square. \\(e_{1}\\) has color\nqualia \\(Q_{B}\\) and\n\\(Q_{R}\\), and also \u201cspatial qualia\u201d,\nwhich we can label \u2018\\(Q_{Tr}\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(Q_{Sq}\\)\u2019. The reference of these\nfour bits of qualia terminology\n(\u2018\\(Q_{B}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{Tr}\\)\u2019, and\n\u2018\\(Q_{Sq}\\)\u2019) has been fixed by, respectively,\nexperiences of blue objects, experiences of red objects, experiences of\ntriangles, and experiences of squares. \\(e_{2}\\), of\ncourse, also has \\(Q_{B},\nQ_{R}, Q_{Tr}\\), and\n\\(Q_{Sq}\\). Yet \\(e_{1}\\) and\n\\(e_{2}\\) differ phenomenologically, and therefore differ\nin qualia. So more qualia terminology is required: in particular, a\nquale name whose reference is fixed by experiences of blue triangles\nand red squares, and another name whose reference is fixed by\nexperiences of red triangles and blue squares. In a useful notation,\nthe first quale name is\n\u2018\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x) \\amp By \\amp Tr(y)}\\)\u2019,\n and the second is\n\u2018\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Tr(x) \\amp By \\amp Sq(y)}\\)\u2019.\n Obviously further qualia names with ever-more complicated subscripts will be\nneeded.\n\n\nNow notice that there are many entailment relations between\nqualia-statements\u2014for example, \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)\u2019\nentails \u2018\\(e\\) has \\(Q_{Rx}\\)\u2019,\nand \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Tr(x) \\amp By \\amp Sq(y)}\\)\u2019\n entails \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(y)}\\)\u2019,\nand so on. The orthodox representationalist and the sense-datum\ntheorist have simple accounts of these entailments in terms of the\nstructure of the objects of experiences (apparent\nstructure, for the representationalist; actual structure, for\nthe sense-datum theorist). Assuming representationalism:\n\u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)\u2019\n(equivalently, \u2018\\(e\\) is an experience of something\u2019s\nlooking red and square\u2019) clearly entails \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx}\\)\u2019 (equivalently, \u2018e is an\nexperience of something\u2019s looking red\u2019). Assuming the sense-datum\ntheory: \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)\u2019\n(equivalently, \u2018\\(e\\) is a sensing of a red and square\nsense-datum\u2019) clearly entails \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx}\\)\u2019 (equivalently,\n\u2018\\(e\\) is a sensing of a red sense-datum\u2019). The\northodox phenomenist cannot give a similar explanation of these\nentailments, and it is not clear whether she is entitled to them at\n all.[40]\n3.3 \u2026For Appearance Properties\n\n\nReturn to the anti-representationalist argument of the previous\nsubsection:\n\nArgument B\n\nP1.\n\nNeither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of the\ntomato.\nP2.\n\nThe tomato is red (and not any other color).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\nThe tomato looks the same color (namely, red) to both Invert and\nNonvert.\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal difference\nbetween Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the colors that\ntheir experiences represent the tomato as having.\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\n\n\n\nRepresentationalists usually resist P1. But there are other options.\nAccording to Shoemaker, the flaw in the argument is not P1, but rather\nP3. In addition to representing colors, Shoemaker thinks that visual\nexperiences represent other (\u201ccolorlike\u201d) properties that\nwe do not have words for in English, and which he calls appearance\n properties.[41]\n On this view, both Invert and Nonvert\u2019s\nexperiences represent the tomato as red. However, Invert\u2019s\nexperience also represents the tomato as having a certain salient\nappearance property (call it\n\u2018\\(AP_{G}\\)\u2019), while Nonvert\u2019s\nexperience represents the tomato as having a certain salient appearance\nproperty \\((AP_{R})\\). It is this\nrepresentational difference between Invert and Nonvert that accounts\nfor the phenomenological difference between their experiences. One may,\nthen, view Shoemaker\u2019s main argument for appearance properties as\nproceeding from P1, P2, and representationalism (i.e., not-C2), to the\nconclusion that P3 is false.\n\n\nWhat are the appearance properties \\(AP_{G}\\)\nand \\(AP_{R}\\)? Since Shoemaker thinks that it\nis implausible that Invert is systematically misperceiving the colors,\nit is not surprising that he also thinks that neither Nonvert nor\nInvert is systematically misperceiving the appearance properties. The\ntomato, then, has both \\(AP_{G}\\) and\n\\(AP_{R}\\). In Shoemaker 1994b,\n\\(AP_{R}\\) is said to be (where\n\\(Q_{R}\\) \u201cis the quale that characterizes\n[Nonvert\u2019s] experience of red things\u201d) the property of\n\u201ccurrently producing [a \\(Q_{R}\\)]\nexperience in someone related to it in a certain way, namely someone\nviewing it under normal lighting conditions\u201d (254), and\nsimilarly for \\(AP_{G}\\) (see also Shoemaker\n1994a). This secures the result that the tomato has\n\\(AP_{R}\\) when Nonvert is looking at it; as\nShoemaker notes, it implies that the tomato lacks\n\\(AP_{R}\\) when it is not being perceived. This\naccount of appearance properties has been substantially revised and\ndeveloped in Shoemaker\u2019s later work. According to Shoemaker 2002,\nappearance properties include dispositions to produce certain\nexperiences in certain perceivers (a suggestion that was considered\nbut rejected in Shoemaker 1994a, b). Shoemaker 2006a revises the\naccount further; for discussion, see Egan 2006 and Speaks 2015, ch. 22.\n\n\nThau (2002, Ch. 5) holds a similar view, but there are some\nimportant differences. First, Thau\u2019s argument does not turn on the need\nto secure spectrum inversion without misrepresentation, and instead\ndeploys an adaptation of Jackson\u2019s (1982) thought experiment concerning\nblack-and-white Mary. (See the entry on\n qualia: the knowledge argument.)\n Second, because Thau is not concerned to\nensure that neither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the tomato, he\ndoes not try to argue that the tomato has both\n\\(AP_{G}\\) and \\(AP_{R}\\),\nleaving the question unexamined. Third, Thau\u2019s argument for appearance\nproperties commits him to the view that they cannot be named (222\u20135);\nShoemaker is not so committed. Finally, Thau does not think, unlike\nShoemaker, that colors are visually represented (211). According to\nThau, beliefs about the colors of things are based on experiences that\nrepresent objects as having appearance properties. These beliefs are\njustified, Thau argues, because there is a correlation between an\nobject\u2019s having color \\(C\\) and its looking to have\nAP\\(_{C}\\) (235\u20136).\n3.4 \u2026For Modes of Presentation\n\n\nAn illustration of \u201cFrege\u2019s puzzle\u201d is this. It is\napparently possible to believe that Michael Caine is a Cockney, while\nnot believing that Maurice Micklewhite is a Cockney. But how can this\nbe, since Michael Caine and Maurice Micklewhite are the same\nindividual?\n\n\nAccording to many philosophers, appearances are not misleading, and\nthe two beliefs really are different: specifically, they represent the\nvery same individual, the beloved star of Alfie, in different\nways, or under different modes of presentation. On this view, the\npropositional content of a belief is a Fregean Thought, with modes of\npresentation as constituents\u2014as opposed to a structured\nRussellian proposition, with objects and properties as\n constituents.[42]\n Put differently but connectedly, the\nexample shows that the names \u2018Michael Caine\u2019 and\n\u2018Maurice Micklewhite\u2019 have different Fregean\nsenses\u2014their semantic values cannot simply be their\nreferents.\n\n\nA similar issue arises in the philosophy of perception (see, e.g.,\nBoghossian and Velleman 1991, Peacocke 2001, Thau 2002). When one looks\nat a cucumber, does the propositional content of one\u2019s experience have\na constituent that is a \u201cmode of presentation\u201d of greenness\n(a neo-Fregean view) or does it instead simply contain the property\ngreenness itself? Using the familiar ordered pair notation for\npropositional content (see, e.g., Thau 2002, 83), and ignoring issues\nabout whether the cucumber itself is associated with a mode of\npresentation, the dispute may be put as follows. On the neo-Fregean\nview, the content of one\u2019s experience of the cucumber is \\(\\langle\\)the\ncucumber, \\(\\mathrm{MOP_{greenness}} \\rangle\\); on the neo-Russellian view, the\ncontent of one\u2019s experiences is \\(\\langle\\)the cucumber, greenness\\(\\rangle\\).\n\n\nRecall the third premise of argument B (see the previous two\nsubsections):\n\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal\ndifference between Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the\ncolors that their experiences represent the tomato as\nhaving.\n\n\nAs explained in subsection 3.3, one may resist P3 by claiming that\ncolor experience represents appearance properties. That\namounts to a defense of representationalism by introducing a\ndistinction \u201cat the level of reference\u201d. However, P3 may\nalso be denied by introducing a distinction \u201cat the level of\nsense\u201d. On this view, the difference between Invert and Nonvert\nis like the difference\u2014as the Fregean has it\u2014between\nIan, who believes that Michael Caine is a Cockney, and Nan, who\nbelieves that Maurice Micklewhite is a Cockney. On this Fregean view of\nthe content of perception, the difference between Invert\u2019s and\nNonvert\u2019s experiences is that they represent the very same property,\nnamely redness, in different ways, or under different modes of\npresentation.\n\n\nThau 2002 argues against modes of presentation (and also points out\nthe close connections between the inverted spectrum and Frege\u2019s\npuzzle). Chalmers 2004 and Block 2007 defend a Fregean view.\n3.5 \u2026For Relativism\n\n\nWe are not quite finished with Argument B:\n\nArgument B\n\nP1.\n\nNeither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of the\ntomato.\nP2.\n\nThe tomato is red (and not any other color).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\nThe tomato looks the same color (namely, red) to both Invert and\nNonvert.\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal difference\nbetween Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the colors that\ntheir experiences represent the tomato as having.\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\n\n\n\nSo far, reasons to reject P1 and P3 have been discussed. But one\nmight also question the step from P1 and P2 to C1. As an analogy,\nsuppose that Hare is on a train, looking at a tomato in his lunchbox,\nand that Tortoise is on the platform, looking at the tomato as the\ntrain speeds by. Both Hare and Tortoise have normal vision, in\nparticular, normal visual motion perception. Consider the following\nargument.\n\nArgument B*\n\nP1*.\n\nNeither Hare nor Tortoise is misperceiving the motion of the\ntomato.\nP2*.\n\nThe tomato is moving (not stationary).\nHence:\n\nC1*.\n\nThe tomato looks to be moving to both Hare and Tortoise.\n\n\n\nSince the tomato is moving relative to Tortoise, and is not\nmoving relative to Hare, if P2* is true, it must not be taken\nto mean that the tomato is moving relative to Hare. Assume, then, that\nP2* is given the following true interpretation: the tomato is moving\nrelative to Tortoise. However, Hare does not have to perceive that the\ntomato is moving relative to Tortoise in order to perceive (correctly)\nthe tomato\u2019s motion\u2014perceiving it as not moving\nrelative to himself will also suffice. Hence, Hare\u2019s and Tortoise\u2019s\nexperiences can both be veridical, despite representing the tomato\u2019s\nmotion differently, which is to say that Argument B* is invalid.\n\n\nOne might diagnose a similar mistake in Argument B, and thus endorse\nrelativism about color. According to relativism the tomato is\nnot red simpliciter: rather, it is red relative to Nonvert\n(not green relative to Nonvert), and green relative to Invert (not red\nrelative to Invert). In other words, the tomato is simultaneously\nred-for-Nonvert and green-for-Invert. Since, on this\nview, the tomato looks red-for-Nonvert to Nonvert, and red-for-Invert\nto Invert, both their experiences are veridical, despite representing\nthe tomato differently.\n\n\nWhat is this property of being red-for-Nonvert? The usual answer is\nsomething along the lines of the account of appearance properties in\nShoemaker 2002: something is red-for-Nonvert iff it is disposed to\ncause experiences with \\(R\\) in perceivers of Nonvert\u2019s kind. And\nthis, of course, is essentially the \u201csecondary quality\u201d\naccount of color that many find in Locke. Sometimes relativism is\ncombined with representationalism (McGinn 1983, Tye 1994), but it\narguably fits more naturally with phenomenism (McLaughlin 2003, Cohen\n2004).\n\n\nShoemaker did not block Argument B in this straightforward fashion\nbecause he finds relativism implausible. As he puts it in a review of\nMcGinn 1983:\nSuppose\u2026that overnight we all undergo\nintrasubjective \u2018spectrum inversion\u2019\u2026It cannot\nseriously be maintained that the result of the change would be that\nhenceforth grass \\(is\\) red, port wine green, etc. And it is\nplausible that, once we were accustomed to the change, we would no\nlonger say that grass looks red (for it would look the way we\nhad become accustomed to having green things look). This point is even\nclearer if we imagine that we undergo intrasubjective inversion one at\na time rather than all of us at once. (1986, 411)\n\n\nLike the argument for appearance properties, the argument for\nrelativism can be made by appeal to shifted spectra (see, in\nparticular, Cohen 2004). Averill 1992 argues for a version of\nrelativism using physically possible intrapersonal shifted spectra\nscenarios, involving a slight change in the eye, or in the\n atmosphere.[43]\n3.6 \u2026For Skepticism About Others\u2019 Minds\n\n\nThe \u201cinverted spectrum\u201d quotation from Locke in\nsubsection 2.2 above continues:\nI am nevertheless very apt to think, that the sensible\nIdeas, produced by any Object in different Men\u2019s Minds, are most\ncommonly very near and undiscernibly alike. For which Opinion, I think,\nthere might be many Reasons offered: but that being besides my present\nBusiness, I shall not trouble my Reader with them; but only mind him,\nthat the contrary Supposition, if it could be proved, is of little use,\neither for the Improvement of our Knowledge, or Conveniency of Life;\nand so we need not trouble our selves to examine it. (1689/1975, II,\nxxxii, 15)\n\n\nIt is regrettable that Locke did not trouble his Reader, because it\nis not at all clear what reasons may be offered. Malebranche was of the contrary opinion: \nYet I believe that it never, or almost never, happens that people see black or white other than as we see them, though they may not seem equally black or white to them. But as for the intermediate colors, such as red, yellow, blue, and especially those compounded from these three, I do not think there are many people who have exactly the same sensation of them. \n (1674\u20135/1997, I, 13, VI)\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) be the claim that when others look at ripe tomatoes, their\nexperiences have \\(Q_{R}\\). Let \\(S\\) be a\nspectrum inversion scenario with the following simple feature: when\nothers look at ripe tomatoes, their experiences have\n\\(Q_{G}\\), not \\(Q_{R}\\).\n(So \\(p\\) and \\(S\\) are incompatible.) Consider the following\nskeptical argument:\n\nArgument C\n\nP1.\n\nOne\u2019s evidence about others\u2019 behavior and use of color words\ndoes not favor \\(p\\) over \\(S\\).\nP2.\n\nOne has no other evidence that favors \\(p\\) over \\(S\\).\nP3.\n\nIf one\u2019s evidence does not favor \\(p\\) over \\(S\\), one does not know \\(p\\).\nTherefore:\n\nC.\n\nOne does not know \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nAlthough philosophers have generally not been impressed by similar\narguments for skepticism about the external world, there is little\nconsensus on the status of arguments along the above lines. For\nexample, Block writes: \u201cI claim we simply do not know whether\nspectrum inversion obtains or not\u201d (1990, 57). Argument C is less\nthreatening than some other skeptical arguments because, even if sound,\ngeneralizations of it to skepticism about other kinds of mental states\nare implausible. For example, a parallel argument against one\u2019s\nknowledge of other\u2019s beliefs would have a dubious first premise.\n\n\nP1 will be denied by an orthodox representationalist. Setting a\ncontroversial skepticism about testimony aside, presumably one can know\non the basis of testimony that tomatoes look red to many people. (See\nShoemaker 1982, 334.) So, since orthodox representationalism equates\n\\(Q_{R}\\) with the property of being an\nexperience of something\u2019s looking red, one may know on the basis of\ntestimony that when others look at tomatoes, their experiences have\n\\(Q_{R}\\).\n\n\nSome philosophers think that the fact that others are biologically\nsimilar to oneself is an important piece of evidence for their mental\nsimilarity (see, e.g., Hill 1991, Ch. 9), and P2 might be denied on\nthese grounds (see, e.g., Papineau 2002, 132). For more discussion, see\nBlock\n 2002.[44]\n3.7 \u2026For the Explanatory Gap\n\n\nMany philosophers think there is an \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d\n(Levine 1983, 2001) between physical facts and facts about conscious\nexperience. On this view, even if consciousness is a physical\nphenomenon, it cannot be given a physical explanation. Inverted\nspectrum scenarios often play a role in arguments for the gap:\nLet\u2019s call the physical story for seeing red\n\u201c\\(R\\)\u201d and the physical story for seeing green\n\u201c\\(G\\ldots\\)\u201d When we consider the qualitative\ncharacter of our visual experiences when looking at ripe McIntosh\napples, as opposed to looking at ripe cucumbers, the difference is not\nexplained by appeal to \\(G\\) and \\(R\\). For \\(R\\)\ndoesn\u2019t really explain why I have the one kind of qualitative\nexperience\u2014the kind I have when looking at McIntosh \napples\u2014and not the other. As evidence for this, note that it seems\njust as easy to imagine \\(G\\) as to imagine \\(R\\) underlying\nthe qualitative experience that is in fact associated with \\(R\\).\nThe reverse, of course, also seems quite imaginable. (Levine 1983,\n356\u20137)\n\n\nThe argument for the gap suggested by Levine 1983 can be set out as\nfollows:\n\nArgument D\n\nP1.\n\nIf a physical theory \\(T\\) explains the fact that we have\nexperiences with \\(Q_{R}\\) when looking at\nMcIntosh apples, and experiences with \\(Q_{G}\\)\nwhen looking at cucumbers, then it is not imaginable that the explanans\nholds without the explanandum. That is, it is not imaginable that\n\\(T\\) holds and we do not have experiences with\n\\(Q_{R}\\) when looking at McIntosh apples\n(etc.).\nP2.\n\nA red-green spectrum inversion scenario in which \\(T\\)\nholds is imaginable.\nHence:\n\nC.\n\nNo physical theory explains the fact that we have experiences\nwith \\(Q_{R}\\) when looking at McIntosh apples,\nand experiences with \\(Q_{G}\\) when looking at\ncucumbers.\n\n\n\nNotice that Argument D does not have as a premise a spectrum\ninversion hypothesis\u2014that a certain spectrum inversion\nscenario is possible. All the argument requires is that the\nspectrum inversion scenario is imaginable. Indeed, since\nLevine is a physicalist, he thinks that this scenario is not\npossible.\n\n\nWhat is the intended interpretation of \u2018imagine\u2019 in P1\nand P2? (In the literature \u2018conceive\u2019 is used\ninterchangeably.) The usual answer (Levine 2001, Ch. 2) is this:\n\\(p\\) is imaginable iff not-\\(p\\) is not a priori.\nOn this interpretation, P1 amounts to this: it is a priori\nthat if the explanans holds, so does the explanandum; that is, that the\nexplanans a priori entails the explanandum. This can be\nmotivated by appeal to the \u201cdeductive-nomological\u201d model of\nexplanation (see Hempel 1965, and the entry on\n scientific explanation);\n this\nmodel is controversial, and in fact Levine rejects it, but he argues\nthat there is a broader motivation:\nFrom the brief survey of current theories of scientific\nexplanation just presented, I think the following claim can be\njustified: in a good scientific explanation, the explanans either\nentails the explanandum, or it entails a probability distribution over\na range of alternatives, among which the explanandum resides. (2001,\n74)\n\n\nOne might resist Argument D by denying P2 (for some ammunition, see\nHardin 1987; 1993, 134\u201342; for a reply see Levine 1991; see also Hardin\n1991). A much more common response is to deny P1 (Block and Stalnaker\n1999; for a reply see Chalmers and Jackson 2001).\n\n\nOne exegetical complication is that Levine himself now denies P1,\nwhile continuing to maintain the existence of the explanatory gap on\nthe basis of an argument related to Argument D, although somewhat more\ncomplicated (2001, Ch. 3). And in any case, just like the inverted\nspectrum argument against behaviorism, functionalism and physicalism\n(see subsection 3.1 above), inverted spectrum scenarios are not playing\nan essential role in the case for the gap, and indeed Levine 2001 leans\nmore heavily on \u201cabsent qualia\u201d scenarios: \u201cThe\nconceivability of zombies\u2026is the principal manifestation of the\nexplanatory gap\u201d (79).\n3.8 \u2026For the Ineffability of Qualia\n\n\nThe introduction of \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019, and so forth, at the\nstart of this article might have occasioned some suspicion. Assume\nthat spectrum inversion does not occur, and consider a\ncounterfactual situation in which, as Block puts it,\n\u201cspectrum inversion is rife\u201d (1990, 55). Suppose\nthat philosophers in this counterfactual situation introduced qualia\nterminology in the way it was introduced in section 1. If their qualia\nterminology is meaningless, then it is hard to see why our terminology\nis better off\u2014we use\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 just as it is used in\nthe counterfactual situation. If, on the other hand, their qualia\nterminology is meaningful, then presumably\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as they use it, refers\nto something other than a quale. (Since spectrum inversion is rife,\ntheir use of \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 is not\nassociated with any particular quale.) Again, given the overlap in\nuse, why suppose that our word\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 is any different? Either\nway: \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 does not refer to a\nquale. There is a threat, then, that qualia cannot be named in a\npublic language\u2014that they are ineffable (cf. Dennett\n1988, 228\u20139). Indeed, that seems to be Block\u2019s opinion: \u201cif an\ninverted spectrum is possible, then experiential contents that can be\nexpressed in public language (for example, looking red) are\nnot qualitative contents, but rather intentional contents\u201d\n(1990, 55; see also Block 2007, 73\u20134). (\u201cQualitative\ncontents\u201d are qualia that are not representational properties:\nsee subsection 3.2.)\n\n\nFrege held a version of the ineffability view. One of his theses in\nThe Foundations of Arithmetic is that arithmetic is\n\u201cobjective\u201d, which he explains as follows:\nWhat is objective\u2026is what is subject to laws, what\ncan be conceived and judged, what is expressible in words. What is\npurely intuitable is not communicable. To make this clear, let us\nsuppose two rational beings such that projective properties and\nrelations are all they can intuit\u2014the lying of three points on\na line, of four points on a plane, and so on; and let what the one\nintuits as plane appear to the other as a point, and vice versa, so\nthat what for the one is the line joining two points for the other is\nthe line of intersection of two planes, and so on with the one\nintuition always dual to the other. In these circumstances they could\nunderstand one another quite well and would never realize the\ndifference between their intuitions, since in projective geometry every\nproposition has its dual counterpart; any disagreements over points of\naesthetic appreciation would not be conclusive evidence. Over all\ngeometrical theorems they would be in complete agreement, only\ninterpreting the words in terms of their respective intuitions. With\nthe word \u2018point\u2019, for example, one would connect one\nintuition and the other another. We can therefore still say that this\nword has for them an objective meaning, provided only that by this\nmeaning we do not understand any of the peculiarities of their\nrespective intuitions. (1884/1953, \u00a726)\n\n\nThis is an inverted spatial qualia scenario. According to Frege, the\ninversion would not show up in the semantics of words: both Nonvert and\nInvert use the word \u2018point\u2019 with the same meaning, despite\nassociating very different \u201cintuitions\u201d with it. In the\nnext paragraph, Frege makes a similar claim about color\nterminology.\nThe word \u2018white\u2019 ordinarily makes us think of a\ncertain sensation, which is, of course, entirely subjective; but even\nin ordinary everyday speech, it often bears, I think, an objective\nsense. When we call snow white, we mean to refer to an objective\nquality which we recognize, in ordinary daylight, by a certain\nsensation. If the snow is being seen in a coloured light, we take that\ninto account in our judgement and say, for instance, \u2018It\nappears red at present, but it \\(is\\) white.\u2019 Even\na colour-blind man can speak of red and green, in spite of the fact\nthat he does not distinguish between these colors in his sensations; he\nrecognizes the distinction by the fact that others make it, or perhaps\nby making a physical experiment. Often, therefore, a colour word does\nnot signify our subjective sensation, which we cannot know to agree\nwith anyone else\u2019s (for obviously calling things by the same name does\nnot guarantee as much), but rather an objective quality.\n(\u00a726)\n\n\nAlthough Frege seems to concede that sometimes a color word\n\u201csignifies our subjective sensation\u201d, the general drift of\nthe argument points to a much stronger conclusion, that our subjective\nsensations are simply not \u201cexpressible in words\u201d. A related\nexample is Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201cbeetle in the box\u201d:\nSuppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it\na \u2018beetle\u2019. No one can look into anyone else\u2019s box, and\neveryone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his\nbeetle.\u2014Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have\nsomething different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing\nconstantly changing.\u2014But suppose the word \u2018beetle\u2019\nhad a use in these people\u2019s language?\u2014If so it would not be\nused as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the\nlanguage game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even\nbe empty. No, one can \u2018divide through\u2019 by the thing in the\nbox; it cancels out, whatever it is. (1958, \u00a7293)\n\n\n(Notice that Wittgenstein imagines \u201cabsent beetles\u201d,\ncorresponding to an \u201cabsent qualia\u201d scenario.)\n\n\nHere is one argument suggested by these passages.\n\n\nSuppose that Humbert is semantically (and otherwise) competent, has\nnormal color vision, is a member of our linguistic community, and uses\nqualia terminology (\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019, etc.), as introduced in\nsection 1 above. Further suppose that spectrum inversion does not in\nfact occur.\n\n\nNow consider a counterfactual spectrum inversion scenario in which\n\u201cspectrum inversion is rife\u201d. Invert has been spectrally\ninverted with respect to some other members of his community since\nbirth, all of whom use color terminology in much the same way. Nonvert\nis spectrally inverted with respect to his neighbor Invert, but\u2014comparing \nthis scenario with the actual scenario described in the\nprevious paragraph\u2014is not spectrally inverted with respect to\nHumbert. Further suppose that Nonvert and his neighbor Invert use\nqualia terminology as introduced in section 1 above. Assume as a\nsuppressed premise that this scenario is possible.\n\n\nLet \u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 abbreviate the definite description \u2018the quale\ndistinctive of Humbert\u2019s experiences of red things\u2019 (by hypothesis,\nthis definite description is coextensive with \u2018the quale\ndistinctive of Nonvert\u2019s experiences of red things in the\ncounterfactual inversion scenario\u2019).\n\nArgument E\n\nP1.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Invert uses\nit, and \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Nonvert uses\nit, refer (if at all) to the same property.\nP2.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Invert uses\nit, does not refer to \\(X\\).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Nonvert uses\nit, does not refer to \\(X\\).\nP3.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Humbert uses\nit, and \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Nonvert uses\nit, refer (if at all) to the same property.\n\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Humbert uses\nit, does not refer to \\(X\\).\n\n\n\nSince the rest of us are in no better position than Humbert, C2\nleads inevitably to the conclusion that\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019, etc., as introduced in\nthe manner of section 1, do not in fact refer to qualia. One might view\nArgument E as showing that certain salient aspects of our mental lives\nare linguistically elusive (as Frege apparently did); alternatively,\none might follow Wittgenstein and conclude that the very idea of qualia\nrests on a conceptual confusion.\n\n\nIn fact, C2 does not imply that qualia are completely\nunspeakable\u2014it does not, that is, imply that \\(no\\)\nexpression refers to \\(X\\) (i.e., the quale distinctive of\nHumbert\u2019s experiences of red things). Indeed, if the sentence to the\nright of \u2018C2\u2019 succeeds in expressing a truth, then\n\u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 (and so \u2018the quale distinctive of Humbert\u2019s\nexperiences of red things\u2019) refers to \\(X\\). If Argument E\nis as far as we can go, then the moral seems to be that particular\nqualia can only be picked out \u2018by description\u2019\u2014they\ncannot be referred to by semantically simple expressions, such as\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 and\n \u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019.[45]\n But\u2014bearing\nin mind Wittgenstein\u2019s remark that \u201cthe box might even be\nempty\u201d\u2014one might attempt to extend the argument to show\nthat even the word \u2018qualia\u2019 itself is devoid of\nsignificance.\n\n\nHowever, Argument E is not obviously sound. The premise in need of\nmost defense is\n P3.[46]\n When qualia terminology was introduced in\nsection 1, it was tacitly presupposed that spectrum inversion was\nnot rife. In Invert\u2019s and Nonvert\u2019s community, that\npresupposition is false, and so it should not be surprising if the\nattempt to introduce \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 into\ntheir public language fails. But in Humbert\u2019s community the\npresupposition is true; so why wouldn\u2019t\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as the members of this\ncommunity use it, successfully refer to the quale distinctive of\nHumbert\u2019s experiences of red\n things?[47]\n3.9 ...For the Inconsistency of Content-Externalism, Representationalism, and Qualia-Internalism\n\nExternalism about beliefs and other propositional\nattitudes, and also about perceptual experiences, was alluded to in\nsubsections 3.1 and 3.2. Premise P1 of our much-scrutinized \nArgument B\u2014\u2018Neither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of\nthe tomato\u2019\u2014was supported, in part, by a particular\nexternalist theory of perceptual content. According to the externalist,\nsome representational properties of subjects, like the property of\nbelieving that water is wet, or that arthritis is painful, or the\nproperty of having an experience of something\u2019s looking red, are\nextrinsic: these properties are not necessarily shared between perfect\nduplicates (or even less-than-perfect duplicates with perfectly\nduplicated\n brains).[48]\n Smith may believe that water is wet, yet\ntwin-Smith on Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth does not believe that water is wet.\nThe tomato may look red to Jones, yet not to twin-Jones on Inverted\nEarth. (In an alternative scenario, twin-Jones has just been created by\nhappenstance in a swamp: see Davidson 1987.)\n\n\nIt is also widely held that qualia are intrinsic (see,\ne.g., Block 1990, 68). (More exactly: properties of subjects like\nhaving an experience with quale Q, are intrinsic.) If Jones is\nhaving an experience with quale \\(Q\\), then there is no possible\nworld w in which twin-Jones is not having an experience with quale\n\\(Q\\).\n\n\nFinally, representationalism (see subsection 3.2 above) is\u2014if \nnot as popular as the previous two claims\u2014at least defended\nby many contemporary philosophers.\n\n\nNow consider the following argument (cf. Byrne and Hilbert 1997b,\n271\u20132):\n\nArgument F\n\nP1.\n\nRepresentational properties are extrinsic.\nP2.\n\nRepresentationalism is true (for simplicity, in the simple form\nof subsection 3.2 above: \\(Q_{C}\\) = the property\nof being an experience of something\u2019s looking to have color\n\\(C)\\).\nP3.\n\nQualia are intrinsic.\n\n\n\nConsider the representational property of having an experience of\nsomething\u2019s looking red. By P1, this property is extrinsic, and so\nthere is a possible world \\(w\\) in which a subject \\(x\\) has\nthis property and \\(y\\)\u2014a perfect duplicate of \n\\(x\\)\u2014lacks it. Solely for illustration, we may take \\(w\\) to be\na possible world in which Nonvert and his twin Invert are both looking\nat a tomato in a white bowl (but perhaps the twins are on different\nplanets). Nonvert is having an experience of something\u2019s looking red,\nand Invert is not; more specifically: (i) the tomato looks red, and\nnothing looks green, to Nonvert; (ii) the tomato looks green, and\nnothing looks red, to Invert. By P2, Nonvert\u2019s experience has\n\\(Q_{R}\\) (and not\n\\(Q_{G})\\); conversely for Invert. So Nonvert and\nInvert are twins whose experiences do not share qualia; in other words,\nqualia are not intrinsic. By P3, contradiction. Hence:\n\nC.\n\nAt least one of P1, P2, and P3 is false.\n\n\nNotice that Argument F does not assume the possibility of a scenario\nin which duplicate perceivers are spectrally inverted. This spectrum\ninversion hypothesis is ruled out by P3, and P3 is of course consistent\nwith Argument F\u2019s conclusion.\n\n\nArgument F shows that either content-externalism, representationalism,\nor qualia-internalism should be rejected. For a discussion of this\nproblem, see Egan and John 2003 (Other Internet Resources); Dretske\n(1995, Ch. 5) argues against P3 (see also Tye 1995, 150\u20135; 2002,\nCh. 6; Lycan 1996, 115\u20137; and No\u00eb 2005, Ch. 7); P1 is\ndenied in Chalmers 2004.\n\n\nRelatedly, McGinn (1989, 58\u201394) runs a \u201cspatially Inverted\nEarth\u201d argument against what he calls \u2018strong\nexternalism\u2019 about perceptual content (a particular kind of\nexternalism); Davies (1997) adapts McGinn\u2019s example to argue for\nexternalism about perceptual content. Both sides of the\n\u201cexternalism/internalism\u201d debate as encapsulated in\nArgument F presuppose that it is possible to keep a perceiver\u2019s\ninternal constitution fixed while greatly varying the environment; this\nassumption is critically examined in Hurley 1998, Chs. 7, 8, and Myin\n2001.\n3.10 Summary: Required Features of Inverted Spectrum Scenarios\n\n\nConclusion \nRequired features of scenario \n\n\nBehaviorism is false.\nBehaviorally undetectable inversion.\n\n\nFunctionalism is false.\nFunctionally undetectable inversion.\n\n\nPhysicalism is false.\nPhysically undetectable inversion.\n\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\nInversion with no misperception (so a behaviorally undetectable\ninversion is not required); in addition, lifelong inversion and same\nlinguistic community.
