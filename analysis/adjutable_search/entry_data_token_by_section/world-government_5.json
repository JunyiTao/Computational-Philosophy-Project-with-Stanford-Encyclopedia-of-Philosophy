Conclusion\n\nThe aim of much normative theorizing about global institutions and\nglobal justice is to interrogate whether a world government is\nfeasible, desirable, or necessary for realizing human aspirations for\njust, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous relations between the\ndiverse individuals and groups that comprise a common moral community\nof humankind. Some think that the idea of world government involves a\nparadox: however it is conceived institutionally, when the winning\nconditions exist for establishing a desirable form of world\ngovernment\u2014one that will guarantee human security with\nindividual liberty, protect the environment, and advance global social\njustice\u2014it will no longer be necessary (Nielsen 1988: 276). Once\nall governments, especially the most powerful ones, are willing to use\ntheir power to build government networks that promote global peace,\njustice and environmental protection, and to cede some traditional\nrights of sovereignty to supranational institutions in areas such as\nthe use of military force, the management and protection of the\nenvironment and natural resources, and the distribution of wealth, the\nestablishment of a global political authority might seem superfluous.\nAs Alexander Wendt has pointed out, however, a stable end-state of\nworld order development requires such ideal conditions, should they\never develop, to become institutionalized into a world state that\nenacts \u201ca global monopoly on the legitimate use of organized\nviolence\u201d (1988: 491); enforcement mechanisms are not\nsuperfluous, since there is always the possibility of violations by\noutlaw states and groups. In a similar vein, the Swedish philosopher\nTorbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 has argued that neither voluntary\nmultilateral cooperation under conditions of anarchy, nor a hybrid\narrangement of \u201cshared sovereignty between the world\ngovernment and nation-states\u201d, will be effective in resolving\ncontemporary challenges in the realms of human security, global\njustice and the environment (2008: 122\u2013125). Since sovereignty\nis indivisible, T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 posits that a world state must have\nultimate decision-making authority over nation-states over\njurisdictional issues:\n\n\nUnless there are sanctions available to the central authority to back\nup a decision as to where a question is to be handled, the system of\nstates will be thrown back into a state of nature. (2008:\n125\u20136)\n\n\nFrom critical and postcolonial perspectives, however, the state of\nnature reference point of much of international relations theory is a\nnormatively obscuring myth that occludes the hierarchies of structural\ndomination that have pervaded the development of world order (Jahn\n2000; Lu 2017: 120). Postcolonial and critical theorists often share\nthe ethical concerns and moral commitments of normative theorists\n(Kohn 2013)\u2014justice, equality, freedom, nondomination\u2014but\ntheir theorizing focuses on the diagnostic task of analyzing the\ncauses and character of contemporary structural and institutional\ndevelopments, as well as the global processes and conditions that make\nthem possible. They view contemporary global order, marked by radical\nimbalances and disparities produced by historic and ongoing structural\ninjustices based on class, race, and gender, as serving certain\nfunctions and interests, in terms of what they naturalize, enable,\nsuppress, and obscure. In 2020 and 2021, as a world divided by deep\npolitical, social and economic structural inequalities faces pandemic\nconditions, economic recession, and environmentally deleterious\ndevelopments, the questions of whose sense of world community\nand whose global needs will define the global political\nagenda and order are more salient than ever.\n",
