    "main_text": "Historicism Then and Now\n3. Historicism Then and Now\n\nNineteenth-century philosophers and (especially) historians are\ncommonly credited with the modern \u201cdiscovery\u201d of history,\nespecially political history, via developing the discipline of\nevidence-based, interpretive and explanatory historiography. Hegel\nhistoricized Kant at the beginning of that century, but it was\nprimarily German historians such as Ranke, Droysen, Windelband,\nDilthey, Rickert, and Weber who developed competing conceptions of\nwhat is required for rigorous historical research. (For an in-depth\nsurvey, see Beiser 2011.) These historians were concerned to develop\nhistoriography as wissenschaftlich but autonomous from the\nnatural sciences, where positivism reigned. They also rejected the\ngrand, Hegel-type philosophies of history. Toward the end of the\ncentury, this opposition produced the Methodenstreit, the\nvehement debate over differences between the natural sciences\n(Naturwissenschaften) and the socio-historical sciences\n(Geisteswissenschaften). Historicists saw naturalism and\nmaterialistic mechanism as threats.\n\nThe connection of the historicization of philosophy of science in the\n1960s to the German historicist tradition is indirect, given the\ntime-gap of decades. However, the historicists of scientific\nrationality discussed in this article did (or do) agree to several of\nthe following (overlapping) tenets, most of them traceable to\nnineteenth-century antecedents. There exist tensions among the\nfollowing claims, so internal disagreement among historicists is to be\nexpected.\n\n1. The historicity of all things. Virtually all things come\ninto existence and pass away in historical time. Nothing is guaranteed\nto be fixed and permanent, written in the stone of the universe.\n\n2. History vs. a priori reason or logic alone. Human beings\ndo not possess a faculty of a priori reason capable of\nsurveying the space of all logical possibilities. The emergence of\nnon-Euclidean geometry illustrates this point. Human inconceivability\nis not an adequate criterion of either logical or historical\npossibility.\n\n3. Our historical boundedness: anti-whiggism and the principle of\nno privilege. We inquirers are also historically situated. While\nwe are not slaves to our cultural context, we can escape it only\npartially and with difficulty. Our horizons sometimes prevent us from\nrecognizing our own presuppositions, not to mention future\npossibilities. Wrote Mary Hesse: \u201cour own scientific theories\nare held to be as much subject to radical change as past theories are\nseen to be\u201d (1976: 264). Although we have good reason to hold\nthat our science is superior to that of the past, this does not confer\nan absolute, ahistorical privilege on our science. Rather than succumb\nto this perspectival illusion, we must imagine that our successors may\nlook at us as we see our predecessors. We, too, are just a\ntransitional stage into a future that is likely to include much that\nis beyond our present horizon of imagination. We must avoid the flat\nfuture illusion that sees the future a tame continuation of the\npresent (Nickles forthcoming).\n\n4. History as endlessly creative, thus an endless frontier.\nStrong historicists think an endless frontier is likely, history as\nopen, and productive of perpetual novelty (no agency intended).\n\n5. Historical content of theory of justification: The complexity\nof history. History is too complex and too subtle to be captured\nby a fixed, formal system or in terms of the dynamical relationships\nof a set of \u201cstate variables\u201d. Logical and probabilistic\nsystems alone are crude tools for capturing the reasoning of real\npeople, scientists included. Besides the subtle, contextual reasons,\ninnovative scientists work at moving research frontiers\n(\u201ccontext of discovery\u201d) and, so, must make many decisions\nunder uncertainty (not only under mere risk). Rationality has more to do with\nappropriate response to change than with sticking rigidly to\none\u2019s initial standpoint. This challenge strikes at the heart of\ntraditional accounts of context of justification, hence at the heart\nof traditional philosophy of science. Thinkers from Kuhn to van\nFraassen (2002: 125) have taken a dim view of confirmation theory,\nalthough Bayesians have made valiant attempts to capture historicist\ninsights. (For examples, see Salmon 1990 and Howson & Urbach\n1993).\n\n6. Consequentialism and history as a judge. Frontier\nepistemology teaches that we can often only learn which modes of\naction are successful via historical experience of the consequences.\n(Non-historicists can reply that the eventual judgment is not itself\nhistorical but only delayed, because based on evidence gathered over\ntime.) In its strongest form, historical judgment replaces \u201cthe\nLast Judgment\u201d, the judgment of God, as reflected in the common\nexpression \u201cthe judgment of history\u201d. (Of course, this\nview is itself anti-historicist in its conception of finality.)\n\n7. Genetic, genealogical understanding. Since nearly\neverything is the product of historical development or disintegration,\nstudying its historical genesis and dissolution is key to\nunderstanding it. Genetic fallacies are avoidable by including\ndevelopment and maintenance as part of the narrative, since\ndevelopment can be transformative. Today many writers are exploring\nthe biological and socio-cultural evolutionary origins of human\nrationality, going far deeper, historically, than to recent historical\ndevelopments such as the so-called Scientific Revolution.\n\n8. Historical skepticism, incommensurability, and relativism.\nOne role of historiography is to debunk myths. As such, it can be\nliberating, as when we see that institutions and conceptual frameworks\nare, to a large degree, human constructions with a historical origin,\nnot things irremediably fixed in the foundation of the universe. For that\nvery reason it produces a degree of skepticism toward all human\nthings. Although the natural world shapes human cultures, including\nscientific ones, it far from dictates a single, fixed culture.\nHistoriography discloses that human enterprises, including the\nsciences, are imbedded in deep cultures with their distinctive norms.\nThere is no \u201cGod\u2019s-eye\u201d, history-neutral set of\nmeta-norms, no \u201cArchimedean point\u201d from which these\ncultures can be objectively compared. Thus it is difficult or\nimpossible to evaluate all science with a single standard. Here lurks\nthe problems of cultural incommensurability and relativism.\n\n9. Pluralism. Methodological pluralism is a natural\nconsequence of historicist approaches. Historical study discloses that\nthe various sciences employ quite different methods and often harbor\ncompeting research programs. The emergence of philosophy of biology as\na specialty area in the wake of the 1959 Darwin centennial added\nsubstance to this claim. (For entries into the pluralism literature,\nsee Dupr\u00e9 1993; Galison & Stump 1996; Mitchell 2003; and\nKellert et al. 2006.)\n\n10. Science as a model of rationality. On this theme,\nhistoricists are divided. Some strong historicists, especially\nFeyerabend, Hull, and thoroughgoing social constructivists, deny that\nscience is rationally or methodologically special among human\nenterprises.\n\n11. Science as a model of progress. This, too, is practically\naxiomatic among philosophers of science. The idea of history\n\u201citself\u201d as progressive came in with the Enlightenment and\nwas severely challenged by the world wars.\n\n12. Historicism as half-naturalistic. Historicist accounts do\nnot appeal to supernatural factors or to factors beyond the\npossibility of human cognition such as clairvoyance or the\nmetaphysical truth about reality. Historicists usually take a second\nstep toward naturalism in considering humans as biologically limited\nbeings, but they resist reduction to the natural science brand of\nnaturalism. Philosophical historicists also reject the reduction of\nnorms to facts. (But, late in life, R.G. Collingwood may have come to hold a\nstrong version of historicism according to which philosophy reduces to\nhistory: see the entry on\n Collingwood.\n Some new-wave sociologists may have held a parallel reductionist view\nabout philosophy and sociology, insofar as philosophy was worth\nsaving.)\n\n13. Major historical change as emergent\u2014against intelligent\ndesign and the conscious model. Many historical developments are\nnot deliberately chosen or designed but emerge from numbers of people\ncarrying out their individual and collective activities. The rise of the nation-state\nand of the international capitalist economic system were not the\nproducts of centralized, rational planning, nor were modern science\nand technology, although there were, of course, many micro-instances\nof such planning. This point applies to the idea of scientific method,\nwhich tradition often depicted as clairvoyantly, intelligently guiding\nscientific innovation. But as Hume already anticipated, no method is\nguaranteed in advance to work in a novel domain. Methodological\ninnovation typically follows rather than precedes innovative work\n(Hull 1988; Dennett 1995; Nickles 2009, forthcoming). This is a\nbroadly Hegelian idea.\n\n14. Strong historical determinism is mistaken. A controversy\namong historicists of various stripes is whether there are \u201ciron\nlaws of historical development\u201d. Hegel and Marx, in quite\ndifferent but related ways, believed in a teleological conception of\nhistory, that \u201cit\u201d was working its way inevitably through\nknown stages toward a final goal that would amount to \u201cthe end\nof history\u201d in the sense that deep historical change would now\ncease. This is the view that Popper termed \u201chistoricism\u201d\nin The Poverty of Historicism (1957; see also his 1945).\nPopper vehemently rejected this version of historicism, as do\nvirtually all historicist philosophers of science today. For them,\nhistory is non-teleological and highly contingent. This includes\nKuhn\u2019s ([1962] 1970a) model, although the latter does posit an\nalmost inevitable, unending alternation of normal and revolutionary\nperiods\u2014a final pattern without end, as it were.\n\n15. Hermeneutic interpretation. The received, covering-law\nmodel of explanation is inadequate to explain historical action,\nincluding that of scientists and communities of scientists. Kuhn\ndescribed his method as hermeneutic, but few historicist philosophers\nof science are full-blown hermeneuticists or as fully committed to\nempathic understanding as were some of the classic German\nhistoricists. Most or all historicists are somewhat partial to\nnarrative forms of explanation. (See the entry on\n scientific explanation.)\n",
