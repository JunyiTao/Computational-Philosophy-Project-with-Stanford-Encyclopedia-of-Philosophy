    "preamble": "\n\nThe published work of Donald Williams (1899\u20131983) ranges across\na broad spectrum in philosophy, but his importance as a philosopher\nrests in large measure on four major achievements. Firstly, in a\nperiod when the role of philosophy was being diminished and\ntrivialized, he persisted with a traditional style of philosophizing.\nAlthough it remained unfashionable throughout most of his active\nyears, he held to the classic program of Western philosophy: to\nexplain and defend our capacity to attain knowledge (so far as that\nreaches), in the light of that to present a well-reasoned account of\nthe most general and fundamental features of Reality, and on that\nbasis to propose a wise scheme for the good life. His unswerving\nallegiance to this project, keeping it alive in dark days, has had its\nreward. At least in Anglophone circles, these classic metaphysical,\nepistemic and ethical issues are once more firmly on the agenda.\n\nWilliams\u2019 own contributions belong to the epistemic and\nmetaphysical aspects of the project rather than its ethical side\n(except for a brief defense of ethics as ultimately \u201cpure\npostulate\u201d (1933b)). So, secondly, as an account of our world he\nproposed an empirically informed materialistic naturalism. Among its\ndistinctive features, he champions a 4-dimensional space-time which\naccords equal status to Past, Present, and Future.\n\nThirdly, this cosmology is embedded in an original and powerful theory\nof the nature of properties, the thesis that properties are themselves\nparticulars rather than universals. This Trope theory, as it has come\nto be known, following Williams\u2019 own usage, has become one of\nthe standard alternatives in the Problem of Universals.\n\nAnd in the fourth place, in the teeth of the prevailing skepticism on\nthis topic, he developed an original and boldly positive justification\nof inductive inference.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nDonald Williams was born on 28 May 1899 in Crows Landing, California,\nat that time a strongly rural district, and died in Fallbrook, also in\nhis beloved California, and also at that time far from cities, on 16\nJanuary 1983. His father was Joseph Cary Williams, who seems to have\nbeen a jack of all countrymen\u2019s trades; his mother Lula Crow, a\nlocal farmer\u2019s daughter. Donald was the first in his family to\npursue an academic education. After studies in English Literature at\nOccidental College (BA 1923), he went to Harvard for his Masters, this\ntime in Philosophy (AM 1925). He then undertook further graduate study\nin philosophy, first at the University of California at Berkeley\n(1925\u201327), then at Harvard, where he took his PhD in 1928.\n\nAlso in 1928 he married Katherine Pressly Adams, from Lamar, Colorado,\nwhom he had met at Berkeley, where she was something of a\npioneer\u2014a woman graduate student in psychology. In time, there\nwere two sons to the marriage. The couple spent a year in Europe in\n1928\u201329 (\u201cimmersing himself in Husserl\u2019s\nPhenomenology to the point of immunization\u201d, Firth, Nozick and\nQuine 1983, p 246). Then Donald began his life\u2019s work as a\nProfessor of Philosophy, first spending ten years at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, and then from 1939 until his retirement in\n1967, at Harvard.\n\nThroughout his long and distinguished career in philosophy he retained\na down-to-earth realism and naturalism in metaphysics, and a\nconservative outlook on moral and political issues, characteristic of\nhis origins. A stocky, genial, and cheerful man, he found neither the\ncontent nor the validation of ethics to be problematic. Although\noriginally a student of literature, whose first publication was a book\nof poetry, he had not the slightest tincture of literary or academic\nbohemianism. He was among the very least alienated academics of his\ngeneration; which is not surprising, as his career was indeed one\nversion of The American Dream.\n2. The Nature of Philosophy\n\nThe traditional ambition of philosophy, in epistemology and\nmetaphysics, is to provide a systematic account of the extent and\nreliability of our knowledge, and on that basis, to provide a synoptic\nand well-based account of the main features of Reality. When Williams\nwas in his prime, this ambition was largely repudiated as\ninappropriate or unattainable, and a much more modest role for\nphilosophy was proposed. In setting forth his own position, in the\npreface to the collection of his selected essays (1966, p.viii), he\nlists some of these fashionable philosophies from the mid-twentieth\ncentury:\n\n\n\u2026logical positivism, logical behaviorism, operationalism,\ninstrumentalism, the miscellaneous American linguisticisms, the\nEnglish varieties of Wittgensteinism, the Existentialisms, and Zen\nBuddhism\u2026\n\n\nEach of these is, in its own way, a gospel of relaxation. They all\npropose that, in place of the struggle to uncover how things are,\ncareful descriptions of how things appear will suffice. None is\nambitious enough to set about constructing a positive and systematic\nepistemology and metaphysics.\n\nUndeterred by this spirit of the age, Williams continued to insist\nthat philosophical issues, including those of traditional metaphysics,\nare real questions with genuine answers (Fisher 2017). Conceptual\nanalysis, concentration on phenomenological description, or\nexploration of the vagaries of language, may have their (subordinate)\nplace, but to elevate them to a central position is an evasion of\nphilosophy\u2019s main task.\n\nStill worse was the suggestion that philosophical questions are mere\nsurface expressions of a philosopher\u2019s underlying\npsycho-pathology. The claim of Morris Lazerowitz to that effect,\nsuggesting that Bradley\u2019s Absolute Idealism was no more than an\nintellectual\u2019s poorly expressed death wish, or that\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument against the reality of time a panic fear of\nchange, he met with a stern rebuke (1959, pp 133\u201356).\n\nHe set forth a Realist philosophy on traditional empiricist\nprinciples: \u201cHe thought that practically everything was right\nout there where it belonged\u201d (Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p\n246). He maintained that while all knowledge of fact rests on\nperceptual experience, it is not limited to the perceptually given,\nbut can be extended beyond that by legitimate inference (1934a). In\nthis way his Realism can develop the breadth and depth required to do\njustice to all the scientific techniques which so far surpass mere\nperception.\n\nWilliams\u2019s empiricism extended to philosophy itself. He\nchallenged the prevailing orthodoxy that philosophy is a purely a\npriori discipline. He emphasized the provisional character of\nmuch philosophizing, and the striking absence of knock-down arguments\nin philosophic controversy (\u201cHaving Ideas In The Head\u201d\n1966, 189\u2013211).\n3. Metaphysics\u2014Cosmology\n\nFollowing his own prescription for an affirmative and constructive\nphilosophy, Williams worked steadily towards the development of his\nown distinctive position in metaphysics. He introduced the useful\ndivision of the subject into Speculative Cosmology, which deals with\nthe basic elements making up the world we live in, such as matter,\nmind, and force, together with the relations between them, and\nAnalytic Ontology, which explores the fundamental categories, such as\nSubstance and Property, and how they relate to one another.\nSpeculative Cosmology, in particular, needs to be open to developments\nin the fundamental sciences, and so needs to be seen as always\nprovisional and a posteriori. Analytic Ontology, the\nexploration of the categories of being, is a more purely reflective\nand a priori discipline aiming to elucidate the range of different\nelements in any universe.\n\nTo begin with Speculative Cosmology, Williams\u2019s position has\nthree main features.\n\nIt is Naturalistic. The natural world of space, time, and matter, with\nall its constituents, is a Reality in its own right. Contrary to all\nIdealist metaphysics, this world, except for the finite minds that are\nto found within it, is independent of any knowing mind. Moreover, it\nis the only world. There are no divinities or supernatural powers\nbeyond the realm of Nature (\u201cNaturalism and the Nature of\nThings\u201d 1966, pp 212\u2013238). Even mathematical realities\nbelong in the natural world: numbers\u2014at least natural\nones\u2014as abstractions from clusters, and geometrical objects as\nabstractions from space. The philosophy of mathematics was an aspect\nof his position that was never fully worked through.\n\nSecond, his position is not only Naturalist but also Materialist. This\nMaterialism is not of the rather crude kind that supposes that every\nreality is composed of a solid, crunchy substance, the stuff that\nmakes up the atoms of Greek speculation. Any spatio-temporal reality,\nwhether an \u2018insubstantial\u2019 property, such as a color, or\nsomething as abstract as a relation, such as farther-away-than, or\nfaster-than, so long as it takes its place as a spatio-temporal\nelement at home in the world of physics, is accepted as part of this\none great spatio-temporal world. Williams\u2019s Materialism is thus\none which can accept whatever physical theory posits as the most\nplausible foundation for the natural sciences, provided that it\nspecifies a world which develops according to natural law, without any\nteleological (final) causes.\n\nThe Mental is accommodated in the same way. Although Mind is\nunquestionably real, mental facts are as spatio-temporally located as\nany others (\u201cThe Existence of Consciousness\u201d, \u201cMind\nas a Matter of Fact\u201d 1966, pp 23\u201340, 239\u2013261). The\nMental is not an independent realm parallel to and equal to the\nMaterial, but rather a tiny, rather insignificant fragment of Being,\ndependent upon, even if not reducible to, the physical or biological\nnature of living beings. Williams has a capacious conception of the\nMaterial\u2014his position could perhaps be better described as\nSpatio-Temporal Naturalism.\n\nThirdly, Williams\u2019s metaphysics is 4-dimensional. Or, more\nprecisely, given the development of multi-dimensional string theories\nsince his time, it takes Time to be a dimension in the same way that\nSpace has dimensions. The first step is to insist, against Aristotle\nand his followers, that statements about the future, no less than\nthose concerning the present and the past, are timelessly true or\nfalse. They need not await the event they refer to, in order to gain a\ntruth value (\u201cThe Sea Fight Tomorrow\u201d 1966, pp\n262\u2013288.) This encourages the further view that the facts that\nunderpin truths about the future are (timelessly) Real. All points in\ntime are (timelessly) Real, as are all points on any dimension of our\nfamiliar Space. Whatever account is to be given of Change, it does not\nconsist in items gaining or losing Reality. This stance receives\npowerful support from physical theory. Williams embraced and argued\nfor the conception of Time as a fourth dimension introduced by\nMinkowski\u2019s \u2018Block Universe\u2019 interpretation of\nEinstein\u2019s Theory of Special Relativity. A consequence of this\nis that the experience of the flow or passage of Time must be some\nsort of illusion. Williams embraced that consequence, and argued for\nit in a celebrated paper (\u2018The Myth of Passage\u2019,\n1951).\n4. Metaphysics\u2014Ontology\n\nApart from his Materialistic or Spatio-Temporal Naturalism,\nWilliams\u2019s major contributions to metaphysics lie in the realm\nof ontology, and concern the fundamental constituents of Being. His\nkey proposal is that properties are indeed real\u2014in fact Reality\nconsists in nothing but properties\u2014but that these properties are\nnot Universals, as commonly supposed, but particulars with unique\nspatio-temporal locations. The structure of Reality comprises a single\nfundamental category, Abstract Particulars, or \u201ctropes\u201d.\nTropes are particular cases of general characteristics. A general\ncharacteristic, or Universal, such as redness or roundness, can occur\nin any one of indefinitely many instances. Williams\u2019 focus was\non the particular case of red which occurs as the color, for example,\nof a particular rose at a specific location in space and time, or the\nparticular case of circularity presented by some particular coin in my\nhand on a single, particular occasion. These tropes are as particular,\nand as grounded in place and time, as the more familiar objects, the\nrose and the coin, to which they belong.\n\nThese tropes are the building blocks of the world. In his analogy,\nthey provide \u2018the Alphabet of Being\u2019 from which the\nentities belonging to more complex categories\u2014objects,\nproperties, relations, events\u2014can be constructed, just as words\nand sentences can be built using the letters of the alphabet. Familiar\nobjects such as shoes and ships and lumps of sealing wax, and their\nparts as revealed by empirical scientific investigation, such as\ncrystals, molecules and atoms, are concrete particulars or things. In\nWilliams\u2019s scheme, each of these consists in a\ncompresent cluster of tropes\u2014the particular\nthing\u2019s particular shape, size, temperature, and consistency,\nits translucency, or acidity, or positive charge, and so on. All the\nmultitude of different tropes that comprise some single complex\nparticular do so by virtue of their sharing one and the same place, or\nsequence of places, in Space-Time. That is what\n\u2018compresent\u2019 means. There is no inner substratum or\nindividuator to hold all the tropes together. The tropes are\nindividuals in their own right, and do not inhere in any thing-like\nparticular. So Williams\u2019s view is a No-Substance theory, or,\notherwise described, a theory in which each trope is itself a simple\nHumean substance, capable of independent existence.\n\nUniversal properties and quantities such as acidity and velocity,\nwhich are common to many objects, are not beings in their own right,\nbut resemblance classes of individual tropes. If two objects\nmatch in color, both being red, for example, the tropes of color\nbelonging to each are separate tropes, both being members of the class\nof similar color tropes which constitutes Redness.\n\nRelations are treated along the same lines. If London is Larger-than\nEdinburgh, and Dublin Larger-than Belfast, we have two instances of\nthe Larger-than relation, two relational tropes. And they, along with\ncountless other cases, all belong to the resemblance class whose\nmembers are all and only the cases of Larger-than. This account denies\nthat, literally speaking, there is any single entity which is\nsimultaneously fully present in two different cases of the same color,\nor temperature, or whatever. So it is a No-Universals view, and often\ndescribed as a version of Nominalism. This is understandable, but it\nis better to confine the term \u2018Nominalism\u2019 to the denial\nof the reality of properties at all. So far from denying properties,\non Williams\u2019s theory the entire world consists in nothing but\ntropes, which are properties construed as particulars. So his position\nis better described not as Nominalist but as Particularist.\n\nTropes provide an elegant and economical base for an ontology. Unlike\nalmost all competing ontologies, that of Williams rests on just one\nbasic category, which can be used in the construction not just of\nthings and their properties and relations, but of further categories,\nsuch as events and processes. Events are replacements of the tropes\nthat are to be found in a given location. Processes are sequences of\nsuch changes. Trope theory is well placed to furnish an attractive\nanalysis of causality, as involving power tropes that govern and drive\nthe transformations to be found in events and processes.\n\nIt can also be of use in other areas of philosophy, for example in\nvaluation theory, where the existence of many tropes, rather than one\nsingle unitary reality, can explain our sometimes divided attitudes\ntoward what, on a Substance ontology, we would regard as the same\nthing. Something can be good in some respects (tropes), but not in\nothers. To view the manifest world as comprising, for the most part,\nclusters of compresent tropes makes explicit the complexity of the\nrealities with which we are ordinarily in contact.\n5. Objections to Williams\u2019s Trope Ontology\n\nMany philosophers have admitted tropes into their scheme of things:\nAristotle, Locke, Spinoza and Leibniz, for example. What is\ndistinctive in Williams is not that tropes are admitted as a category,\nbut as the only fundamental category, a trope-based form of\nwhat Schaffer calls \u201cproperty primitivism.\u201d (Schaffer\n2003, 125). All else is constructed out of tropes, including concrete\nparticulars and general properties, whereas tropes themselves are not\nconstructed out of anything else, for example, out of a substance, a\nuniversal and the relation of exemplification. Not surprisingly,\nvarious aspects of Williams\u2019 trope primitivism have been\nsubjected to serious philosophical challenges either directly or\nindirectly.\n\nSome philosophers reject all forms of property primitivism, including\nthat of Williams, on the grounds that properties cannot serve as the\nonly independent elements of being. Properties must be had by objects\nand a property cannot be instantiated in isolation from wholly\ndistinct properties so they lack the requisite independence, the\ncapacity of existing in any combination with \u201cwholly distinct\nexistences.\u201d (Some philosophers go so far as to claim that if a\nproperty P is a trope, then P is dependent on the\nspecific thing that has it and so could not have existed without that\nthing existing; see Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984, Heil 2003.)\nThere are two ways for this objection to go. (1) Armstrong takes the\nostensive fact that properties must be had by objects to establish the\ndependence of properties on non-property particulars, substrata, and,\nthus, the falsity of property primitivism (Armstrong 1989, 115). (2)\nAlternately, one can take the apparent fact that there can be no\nproperties that are not clustered with other properties to show that\nproperties cannot play this role.\n\nIn response to (1), one can challenge the assumption that if\nproperties must be had by objects, then they are not capable of\nindependent existence. Ross Cameron, for example, suggests that\nproperties might both be capable of independent\nexistence\u2014including existing without substrata\u2014and not be\ncapable of existing without being the property of something. (2006,\n104). The dependence of properties on objects is compatible with\nproperty primitivism if one adopts a bundle theory of concrete\nparticulars. In that case, properties are always had by objects since\nthey are always found in bundles, even if only a bundle of one, but\nexist without substrata.\n\nAs for (2), some philosophers reject the requirement that if\nproperties are the only ultimate constituents of reality, then they\nmust be capable of existing in isolation from all other wholly\ndistinct properties (Simons 1994; Denkel 1997). Properties can be both\nthe only ultimate constituents of reality and inter-dependent. This\nresponse requires the rejection of the Humean principle that the basic\nindependent units of being can exist in any combination, including\nunaccompanied (Schaffer 2003, 126). A very different response to (2)\nrejects the necessity of trope clustering altogether (Williams 1966,\n97; Campbell 1981, 479; Schaffer 2003).\n\n\nPlausible though it be, however, that a color or a shape cannot exist\nby itself, I think we have to reject the notion of a standard of\nconcreteness. \u2026 (Williams 1966, 97)\n\n\nAt best, it is a contingent matter that there are no tropes that are\nnot compresent with any other tropes\u2014for example, a mass trope\non its own. (Campbell goes so far as to suggest that there is reason\nto think that there are actual cases of free-floating tropes (1981,\n479)).\n\nEven if the trope primitivist can get around these quite general\nobjections, there remains the most serious objection to\nWilliams\u2019 brand of trope primitivism, an objection that is\nspecific to Williams\u2019 conception of tropes, depending on more\nthan the assumption that tropes are properties. The charge is that a\nWilliamsonian trope is not genuinely simple, but complex embracing, at\nleast, an element that furnishes the nature or content of the trope,\nand an element providing its particularity (Hochberg 1988; Armstrong\n2005; Moreland 1985; Ehring 2011). In short, Williamsonian tropes are\nconstructed out of something else, making them incompatible with trope\nprimitivism.\n\nThis objection is based on two assumptions. First, under\nWilliams\u2019 conception, the nature of a trope is a non-reducible,\nintrinsic matter that is not determined by relations to anything else,\nincluding resemblance relations to other tropes or memberships in\nvarious natural classes of tropes. And, second, anything that stands\nin more than one arbitrarily different relation, each of which is\ngrounded intrinsically in that entity, must be complex since that\nentity will have intrinsic \u201caspects\u201d that are not\nidentical to each other. The two relevant relations are numerical\ndifference from other tropes and resemblance to other tropes, each of\nwhich is grounded intrinsically in the trope relata under the Williams\nconception. Hence, there are \u201cintrinsic aspects\u201d of each\ntrope that are not identical to each other, a particularity-generating\ncomponent and a nature-generating component.\n\nIn response to this \u201ccomplexity\u201d objection, Campbell\nclaims that the distinction between a trope\u2019s nature and its\nparticularity is merely a \u201cformal\u201d distinction, a product\nof different levels of abstraction, and not a real distinction between\ndifferent components of a trope. One should no more distinguish a\nparticularity-component from a nature-component of a trope than\ndistinguish components of warmth and orangeness in an orange\ntrope:\n\n\nTo recognize the case of orange as warm is not to find a new feature\nin it, but to treat it more abstractly, less specifically, than in\nrecognising it as a case of orange. (Campbell 1990, 56\u20137;\nfurther in Maurin 2005; Fisher 2020)\n\n\nAlternately, Ehring suggests that we grant this objection, but\npreserve trope simplicity by switching to a non-Williamsonian\nconception of tropes, according to which a trope\u2019s nature is\ndetermined by its memberships in various natural classes of tropes\nrather than intrinsically, thereby sidestepping one of the assumptions\noperative in the objection (2011; discussion in Hakkarainen and\nKein\u00e4nen 2017).\n\nComing under criticism as well is Williams\u2019 resemblance-based\naccount of general characteristics and property agreement. According\nto Williams, a fully determinate general color\ncharacteristic\u2014say, the shade of red that characterizes this\nshirt and this chair\u2014-is just the set of all tropes that exactly\nresemble the red trope of this shirt. Different objects of that\n\u201csame\u201d shade of red each possess a different trope from\nthis set of exactly similar red tropes. But this analysis seems to\ngenerate an infinite regress. If trope t1 is\nrelated to trope t2 by resemblance trope\nr1, t2 is related to trope\nt3 by resemblance trope r2,\nand t3 is related to t1 by\nresemblance trope r3, then these resemblance\ntropes will also resemble each other, giving rise to further\nresemblance tropes, and so on. To stop this vicious regress, the\nobjection continues, resemblance must be taken to be a universal (Daly\n1997, 150).\n\nOne response to this objection tries to stop the regress before it\nstarts by denying that there are any resemblance trope-relations\nholding between tropes. In particular, the trope theorist might follow\nOliver\u2019s advise\n\n\nto avoid saying that when two tropes are exactly similar \u2026,\nthere exists a relation-trope of exact similarity \u2026 holding\nbetween the two tropes. (1996, 37)\n\n\nThere are no resemblance-tropes corresponding to these resemblance\npredicates. Another response denies that resemblance relations mark an\naddition to our ontology and, hence, there can be no regress of\nresemblance relations. Campbell, for example, argues that the\nsuccessive resemblance relations in the regress are nothing over and\nabove the non-relational tropes that ultimately ground these\nrelations. Since resemblance is an internal relation, it supervenes on\nthese ground-level non-resemblance tropes, but supervenient\n\u201cadditions\u201d are not real additions to one\u2019s ontology\n(Campbell 1990, 37).\n\nThere is also a whole host of objections in the literature to\nWilliams\u2019 trope bundle theory. According to Williams, concrete\nparticulars are not substrata instantiating various properties. They\nare wholly constructed out of tropes, forming bundles of tropes, the\ntrope constituents of which are pairwise tied together by a\ncompresence relation. Compresence, in turn, is collocation for\nWilliams, \u201cthe unique congress in the same volume.\u201d (In\norder to allow for non-spatial objects, Williams grants the\npossibility of \u201clocations\u201d in systems analogous to space\n(1966, 79).) One immediate worry, raised by Campbell, is the\npossibility that there may be cases of overlapping objects\ndemonstrating that collocation is not sufficient for compresence\n(1990, footnote 5, 175). In response, the trope bundle theorist can\nopt for the view that compresence is non-reducible. However, even with\nthis revision there remain significant objections concerning the\npossibility of accidental properties, the possibility of change, and\nan apparent vicious regress of compresence relations.\n\nBundle theory has been charged with ruling out the possibility of\naccidental properties in concrete particulars. Bundles of properties\nhave all of their constituent properties essentially. Objects\ngenerally do not. This chair could have been blue instead of red, but\nthe bundle of properties that characterize the chair could not have\nfailed to include that red property. One way around this objection is\nproposed by O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne and Cover: combine bundle theory\n(although for them properties are universals) with a specific account\nof modality, a counterpart semantics for statements about ordinary\nparticulars (1998). What makes it true that a particular object\no could have had different properties is that a non-identical\ncounterpart to o, n, in another possible world has\ndifferent properties than does o. As long as there is a\npossible world in which there is a object-bundle, n, that is\nnon-identical counterpart to o and differs from o\nwith respect to its properties, then o could have differed in\njust that way.\n\nSimons suggests a very different approach. He proposes to replace\nunstructured bundles with \u201cnucleus theory.\u201d An object\nconsists of an inner core of essential tropes and an outer band of\naccidental tropes, but no non-property substratum (1994).\n\nIn like manner, bundle theory has been charged with ruling out the\npossibility of change in objects. The same bundle complex cannot be\ncomposed of one set of property at one time, but a different set at a\ndifferent time. Concrete objects, on the other hand, can and do\nchange. In response, it has been suggested that this objection loses\nits force if bundle theory is combined with a four-dimensionalist\naccount of object persistence (Casullo 1988; see also Ehring 2011).\nFor example, if ordinary objects are spacetime worms made up of\nappropriately related instantaneous temporal parts that are themselves\ncomplete bundles of compresent tropes, then change can be read as a\nmatter of having different temporal parts that differ in their\nconstitutive properties. Another response to the change-is-impossible\nobjection is to adopt Simons\u2019 \u201cnucleus theory\u201d in\nplace of traditional bundle theory. Nucleus theory seems to allow for\nchange in the outer band of accidental properties (Simons 1994).\n\nTrope bundle theory has also been accused of giving rise to\nBradley-style vicious regress. According to trope bundle theory, for\nan object o to exist, its tropes must be mutually compresent. However,\nit would seem, for trope t1 to be compresent with\ntrope t2, they must be linked by a compresence\ntrope, say, c1. But, the existence of\nt1, t2, and\nc1 is insufficient to make it the case that\nt1 and t2 are compresent since\nthese tropes could each be parts of different, non-overlapping\nbundles. So for t1 and t2 to\nbe linked by compresence trope c1,\nc1 must be compresent with t1\nby way of a further compresence relation, say c2\n(and with t2 by, say, c3) and\nso on, giving rise to either a vicious, or at least, uneconomical\nregress (Maurin 2010, 315). In response, one can try to break the link\nbetween the relevant predicates and tropes. Oliver suggests that the\ntrope theorist should reject the assumption that there are any\nrelation-tropes corresponding to the predicate \u201c\u2026.is\ncompresent with\u2026\u201d even though that predicate has some\ntrue applications (1996, 37). This response might be indirectly\nsupported by reference to Lewis\u2019s claim that it is an impossible\ntask to give an analysis of all predications since any analysis will\nbring into play a new predication, itself requiring analysis (Lewis\n1983, 353).\n\nA second, quite different response is modeled on Armstrong\u2019s\nview that \u201cinstantiation\u201d is a \u201ctie,\u201d not a\nrelation (since \u201cthe thisness and nature are incapable of\nexisting apart\u201d), and, hence, it is not subject to a relation\nregress. (1978, 109). The idea is that the union of compresent tropes\nis too intimate to speak of a relation between them since the tropes\nof the same object could not have existed apart from each other. This\nresponse, however, requires more than generic dependencies\u2014for\nexample, that this specific mass trope requires the existence of some\nsolidity trope or other\u2014since generic dependencies would not\nguarantee that the specific mass and solidity tropes, say, in this\nparticular bundle could not have existed without being compresent.\n\nMaurin provides an alternative response that grants the existence of\ncompresence relation-tropes, but denies the regress on the grounds\nthat relation-tropes, including compresence relations, necessitate the\nexistence of that which they relate. There is no need for further\ncompresence relations holding between a compresence-relation and its\nterms (2002, 164). A fourth response, from Ehring, suggests that this\nregress can be stopped once it is recognized that compresence is a\nself-relating relation, a relation that can take itself as a relatum.\nThe supposed infinite regress for the bundle theorist involves an\nunending series of compresence tropes, c1,\nc2, \u2026, and cn,\nbut the series, c1, c2,\n\u2026, and cn is taken to be infinite\nbecause it is assumed that each \u201cadditional\u201d compresence\ntrope is not identical to the immediate preceding compresence\ntrope in the series. However, if compresence is a\n\u201cself-relating\u201d relation, this assumption may be false\n(2011).\n\nFinally, there is an objection to the very notion of a trope and,\nhence, to the foundations of trope primitivism (and, perhaps, to any\nontology that includes tropes). The idea is that if properties are\ntropes, then exactly similar properties can be swapped across objects,\nbut there is no such possibility.\n\n\nIf the redness of this rose is exactly similar to but numerically\ndistinct from the redness of that rose, then the redness of this rose\ncould have been the redness of that rose and vice versa. But this is\nnot really a possibility and, thus, properties are not tropes.\n(Armstrong 1989, 131\u2013132)\n\n\nA similar argument is based on the possibility of tropes swapping\npositions in space (Campbell 1990, 71). \u201cProperty\nswapping,\u201d it is claimed, is an unreal possibility since\nproperty swapping would make no difference to the world. (Note that\nthe cross-object version of this objection cannot get off the ground\nif tropes are not transferable between objects, a view that is found\nin (Martin 1980), although Martin rejects trope primitivism since he\nposits substrata in addition to tropes).\n\nOne response to the no-swapping objection, given by Campbell and\nLabossiere, rejects the assumption that trope swaps would make no\ndifference to the world. For example, although the effects of\n\u201cswapped\u201d situations would be exactly similar in nature,\nthose effects would differ in their causes (Campbell 1990, 72;\nLabossiere 1993, 262). Schaffer, on the other hand, denies that the\ntrope theory is automatically committed to the possibility of trope\nswapping (2001). If tropes are individuated by times/locations and a\ncounterpart theory of modality is right, then trope swapping is ruled\nout:\n\n\nThe redness which would be here has exactly the same inter- and\nintraworld resemblance relations as the redness which actually is\nhere, and the same distance relations, and hence it is a better\ncounterpart than the redness which would be there. (Schaffer\n2001, 253).\n\n\nWhat is clear is that Williams\u2019 trope ontology remains at the\ncenter of a vibrant and ongoing debate, counting as a serious option\namong a small field of contenders. His brand of trope primitivism is\ncertainly of more than merely historical interest.\n\nWilliams has also left a wider, if less plainly manifest legacy as a\nmetaphysician. For a discussion of his influence on David Lewis, and\nthrough him on later thinkers, see Fisher 2015.\n6. The Ground of Induction\n\nThe Problem of Induction is the problem of vindicating as rational our\nunavoidable need to generalize beyond our current evidence to\ncomparable cases that we have not yet observed, or that never will be\nobserved. Without inductive inferences of this kind, not only all\nscience but all meaningful conduct of everyday life is paralyzed.\nIndeed, Williams prefaced his philosophical treatment with a\ndeclaration of the evils of inductive skepticism in eroding rational\nstandards in general, even in politics:\n\n\nIn the political sphere, the haphazard echoes of inductive skepticism\nwhich reach the liberal\u2019s ear deprive him of any rational right\nto champion liberalism, and account already as much as anything for\nthe flabbiness of liberal resistance to dogmatic encroachments from\nthe left or the right. (Williams 1947, pp 15\u201320)\n\n\nDavid Hume, in the eighteenth century, had shown that all such\ninferences must involve risk: no matter how certain our premises, no\ninductively reached conclusion can have the same degree of certainty.\nHume went further, and held that inductive reasoning provides no\nrational support whatever for its conclusions. This is Hume\u2019s\nfamous inductive scepticism.\n\nWilliams was almost alone in his time in holding not only that the\nproblem does admit of a solution, but in presenting a novel solution\nof his own. To do this, he needed to argue against Hume, and\nHume\u2019s twentieth century successors Bertrand Russell and Karl\nPopper, who had declared the problem insoluble, and also against\ncontemporaries such as P. F. Strawson and Paul Edwards, who had\nclaimed that there was no real problem at all (Russell 1912, Chapter\n6; Popper 1959; Edwards 1949, pp 141\u2013163; Strawson 1952, pp\n248\u2013263). Williams tackled the problem head-on. In The\nGround of Induction (1947) he makes original use of results\nalready established in probability theory, whose significance for the\nproblem of induction he was the first to appreciate. He treats\ninductive inference as a special case of the problem of validating\nsampling techniques. Among any population, that is, any class of\nsimilar items, there will be a definite proportion having any possible\ncharacteristic. For example, among the population of penguins, 100%\nwill be birds, about 50% will be female, some 10%, perhaps, will be\nEmperor penguins, some 35%, perhaps, will be more than seven years\nold, and so on. This is the complexion of the population,\nwith regard to femaleness, or whatever.\n\nNow in the pure mathematics of the relations between samples and\npopulations, Jacob Bernoulli had in the 18th century\nestablished the remarkable fact that, for populations of any large\nsize whatever (say above 2500), the vast majority of samples of 2500\nor more closely match in complexion the population from which they are\ndrawn. In the case of our penguins, for example, if the population\ncontains 35% aged 7 years or more, well over nine tenths of samples of\n2500 penguins will contain between 33% and 37% aged 7 years or more.\nThis is a necessary, purely mathematical, fact. In the language of\nstatistics, the vast majority of reasonably sized samples are\nrepresentative of their population, that is, closely resemble\nit in complexion.\n\nBernoulli\u2019s result enables us to infer from the complexion of a\npopulation to the complexion of most reasonably-sized samples taken\nfrom it, since the complexion of most samples closely resembles the\ncomplexion of the population. Williams\u2019s originality was this:\nhe noticed that resemblance is symmetrical. If we can prove, as\nBernoulli did, that most samples resemble the population from which\nthey are drawn, then conversely the population\u2019s complexion\nresembles the complexion of most of the samples.\n\nThis brings us to the problem of induction. What our observations of\nthe natural world provide us with can be regarded as samples from\nlarger populations. For example the penguins we have observed up to\nthis point provide us with a sample of the wider population of all\npenguins, at all times, whether observed or not. What can we infer\nabout this wider population from the sample we have? That, in all\nprobability, the population\u2019s complexion is close to that of the\nsample. We may of course, have an atypical sample before us.\nBut with samples of more than 2500, well over 90% represent the\npopulation fairly closely, so the odds are against it.\n\nThus Williams assimilates the problem of induction to an application\nof the statistical syllogism (also called direct inference or the\nproportional syllogism). A standard syllogism concerns complexions of\n100%, and has a determinate conclusion: if all S are P, and\nthis present item is an S, then it must be P. A\nstatistical syllogism deals with complexions of less than 100%, and\nits conclusion is not definite but only probable: for example, if\n95% of S are P, this present S is probably\nP. Some logicians claim that the probability in question is\nexactly 0.95, but Williams does not need to rely on that additional\nclaim. It is enough that the probability be high. Applying the\nstatistical syllogism to Williams\u2019 reversal of the Bernoulli\nresult, we have: 95% of reasonably-sized samples are closely\nrepresentative of their population, so the sample we have, provided\nthere are no grounds to think otherwise, is probably one of them. On\nthat basis, we are rationally entitled to infer that the population\nprobably closely matches the sample, whose complexion is known to us.\nThe inference is only probable. Induction cannot deliver certainty. In\nany given case, it is abstractly possible that our sample may be a\nmisleading, unrepresentative one. But to expect an inference from the\nobserved to the unobserved to yield certainty is to expect the\nimpossible.\n7. Objections to Williams\u2019 proposed solution to the problem of induction\n\nWilliams\u2019 treatment of induction created quite a stir when it\nappeared, but attracted criticisms of varying power from commentators\nwedded to more defeatist attitudes, and was eclipsed by the Popperian\nstrategy of replacing an epistemology of confirmation with one that\nfocused on refutation. It thus exercised less influence than it\ndeserves. It is a closely reasoned, deductively argued defense of the\nrationality of inductive inference, well meriting continued\nattention.\n\nIts reliance on a priori reasoning (as opposed to any\ncontingent principles such as the \u201cuniformity of nature\u201d\nor the action of laws of nature) means that it should hold in all\npossible worlds. Williams\u2019 argument would thus be easily\ndefeated by the exhibition of a possible world in which inductive\nreasoning did not work (in the sense of mostly yielding false\nconclusions). However, critics of Williams have not offered such a\npossible non-inductive world. Chaotic worlds are not non-inductive (as\nthe induction from chaos to more chaos is correct in them), while a\nworld with an anti-inductive demon, who falsifies, say, most of the\ninductive inferences I make, is not clearly non-inductive either\n(since although most of my inductions have false conclusions,\nit does not follow that most inductions in general have false\nconclusions).\n\nMarc Lange (2011) does however propose a counterexample, arising from\nthe \u201cpurely formal\u201d nature of Williams\u2019 argument.\nShould it not apply equally to \u201cgrue\u201d as to\n\u201cgreen\u201d? Objects are grue if they are green up to some\nfuture point in time, and blue thereafter. The problem is to show that\nour sample, to date, of green things is not a sample of things\nactually grue. (Williams\u2019s own views on the grue problem are\ngiven in his \u201cHow Reality is Reasonable\u201d in (2018)).\n\nStove (1986, 131\u2013144) argued that his more specific version of\nWilliams\u2019s argument (see below) was not subject to the\nobjection, and that the failure of induction in the case of\n\u2018grue\u2019 showed that inductive logic was not purely\nformal\u2014but then neither was deductive logic.\n\nOther criticisms arise from the suggestion that the proportional\nsyllogism in general is not a justified form of inference without some\nassumption of randomness. Any proportional syllogism (with exact\nnumbers) is of the form\n\nThe proportion of Fs that are G is\nr.\na is F.\nSo, the probability that a is G is r.\n\n\n(Or, if we let B be the proposition that the proportion of\nFs that are G is r, and we let\np(h\u2009|\u2009e) be the conditional\nprobability of hypothesis h on evidence e, then we\ncan express the above proportional syllogism in the language of\nprobability as follows: p(Ga\u2009|\u2009Fa\n& B) = r.)\n\nDo we not need to assume that a is chosen\n\u201crandomly\u201d, in the sense that all Fs have an\nequal chance of being chosen? Otherwise, how do we know that\na is not chosen with some bias, which would make its\nprobability of being G different from r?\n\nDefenders of the proportional syllogism (McGrew 2003; Campbell and\nFranklin 2004) argue that no assumption of randomness is needed. Any\ninformation about bias would indeed change the probability, but that\nis a trivial fact about any argument. An argument infers from given\npremises to a given conclusion; a different argument, with a different\nforce, moves from some other (additional) premises to that conclusion.\nGiven just that the vast majority of airline flights land safely, I\ncan have rational confidence that my flight will land safely, even\nthough there are any number of other possible premises (such as that I\nhave just seen the wheels fall off) that would change the probability\nif I added them to the argument. The fact that the probability of the\nconclusion on other evidence would be different is no reason\nto change the probability assessment on the given evidence.\n\nSimilar reasoning applies to any other property that a may\nhave (or, in the case of the Williams argument, that the sample may\nhave), such as having been observed or being in the past. If there is\nsome positive reason to think that property relevant to the conclusion\n(that a is G), that reason needs to be explained; if\nnot, there is no reason to believe it affects the argument and the\noriginal probability given by the proportional syllogism stands.\n\nSerious criticisms specific to Williams\u2019s argument have been\nbased on claims that the proportional syllogism, though correct in\ngeneral, has been misapplied by Williams. Any proportional\nsyllogism,\n\nThe proportion of Fs that are G is\nr.\na is F.\nSo, the probability that a is G is\nr,\n\n\nis subject to the objection that, in the case at hand, there is\nactually further information about the Fs that is relevant to\nthe conclusion Ga. For example, in\n\nThe proportion of candidates who will be appointed to the board of\nAlbert Smith Corp is 10%.\nAlbert Smith Jr is a candidate.\nSo, the probability that Albert Smith Jr will be appointed is\n10%,\n\n\nit is arguable that information is hidden in the proper names that is\nfavorably relevant to the younger Smith\u2019s chance of success. The\nquestion then is whether the same could happen with the proportional\nsyllogism in Williams\u2019 argument for induction. Maher (1996)\nargues that there is such a problem. In this version of\nWilliams\u2019 argument:\n\nThe proportion of large samples whose complexion approximately\nmatches the population is over 95%.\nS is a large sample.\nSo, the probability that the complexion of S matches the\npopulation is over 95%,\n\n\nis there, typically, any further information about the sample\nS that is relevant to whether it matches the population? The\npotentially relevant information one has is the proportion in\nS of the attribute to be predicted (blue, or whatever it\nmight be). Can that be relevant to matching?\n\nIt certainly can be relevant. For example, if the proportion of blue\nitems in the sample is 100%, it suggests that the population\nproportion is close to 100%; that is positively relevant to matching\nsince samples of near-homogeneous populations are more likely to\nmatch. (For example, if the population proportion is 100%,\nall samples match the population.) Conversely, fewer samples\nmatch the population when the population proportion is near one\nhalf.\n\nDavid Stove (1986), in defending Williams\u2019 argument, proposed to\navoid this problem by taking a more particular case of the argument\nwhich would not be subject to the objection. Stove proposed:\n\n\nIf F is the class of ravens, G the class of black\nthings, S a sample of 3020 ravens, r = 0.95, and\n\u2018match\u2019 means having proportion within 3% of the\npopulation proportion, then it is evident that \u2018The proportion\nof Fs that are Gs is x\u2019 is not\nsubstantially unfavorable to matching (for all x).\n\n\nFor even in the worst case, when the proportion of black things is one\nhalf, it is still true that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation (Stove 1986, 66\u201375).\n\nStove\u2019s reply emphasizes how strong the mathematical truth about\nmatching of samples is: it is not merely that, for any population size\nand proportion, one can find a sample size and degree of match such\nthat samples of that size mostly match; it is the much stronger result\nthat one can fix the sample size and degree of match beforehand,\nwithout needing knowledge of the population size and proportion. For\nexample, the vast majority of 3020-size samples match to within\n3%\u2014irrespective of the population size (provided of course that\nit is larger than 3020) and the proportion of objects with the\ncharacteristic under investigation..\n\nMaher also objects that the attribute itself, such as\n\u201cblue\u201d, might be a priori relevant to its\nproportion in the sample and hence to matching. For example, if\n\u201cblue\u201d is one of a large range of possible colors, then\na priori it is unlikely that an individual is blue and\nunlikely that a sample will have many blue items. As with any Bayesian\nreasoning, a prior probability close to zero (or one) requires a lot\nof evidence to overcome; in this case, we would conclude that a sample\nwith a high proportion of blue items was most likely a coincidence,\nand the posterior probability of the sample matching the population\nwould still not be high.\n\nScott Campbell (2001), in reply to Maher, argues that priors do not\ndominate observations in the way Maher suggests. By analogy, suppose\nthat, while blindfolded, I throw a dart at a dartboard. I am told that\n99 of the 100 spots on the board are the same color, and that there\nare 145 choices of color for the spots. After throwing, I observe just\nthe spot I have hit and find it is blue. Then (in the absence of\nfurther information), the chance is very high that almost all the\nother spots are blue. The prior improbability of blue does not prevent\nthat. In the same way, the fact that the vast majority of samples\nmatch the population gives good reason to suppose that the observed\nsample does too, irrespective of any prior information of the kind\nMaher advances.\n\nWilliams\u2019 defense of induction thus has resources to supply\nanswers to the criticisms that have been made of it. It remains the\nmost objectivist and ambitious justification of induction.\n",
