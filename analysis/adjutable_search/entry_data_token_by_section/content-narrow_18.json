    "main_text": "Strategies for Determining Narrow Content || Ideal Environment Strategy\n5.3 Ideal Environment Strategy\n\nThis strategy is proposed by Dennett (1982). The idea is that a\n(centered) world is included in one\u2019s narrow content if and only\nif it is a world to which one is ideally suited. Place a subject in\nsome environments, and everything will work out extremely well: the\nsubject\u2019s attempts to satisfy his or her desires will succeed\nevery time. Other environments will be much less friendly; somehow the\nsubject\u2019s actions will never turn out to have quite the desired\neffects. Dennett\u2019s thought is roughly that we can capture the\nway the world is from the subject\u2019s point of view by taking the\nset of centered worlds to which the subject is ideally adapted. One\nattraction of this strategy is that it does not make narrow content\nparasitic on broad content; another is that it does not require the\nsubject to be able to answer questions or reflect on the content of\nthe subject\u2019s thoughts, so that it could easily be applied to\ncats and dogs as well as to humans.\n\nA possible problem for the ideal environment strategy is that, while\nit may give us a way to determine a subject\u2019s total view of the\nworld, it does not provide a way of parceling out narrow contents to\nmore specific states.\n\nA second problem is that the strategy does not seem to properly\ndiscriminate cognitive content from other sorts of information a\nsubject\u2019s body may carry. A baby is better adapted to worlds in\nwhich extreme heat can damage its body than to worlds in which it\ncannot. When the baby touches something hot it automatically jerks\naway. This action has a useful purpose in a world in which heat is\ndamaging, but would be pointless in a world in which it was not. But\nit does not follow that the baby believes that extreme heat\nis damaging. (See Stalnaker 1989, White 1991.)\n\nA third problem is that, in some cases in which an individual\u2019s\nstates do seem contentful, the ideal environment strategy, as stated\nabove, seems to yield the wrong content. In the most obvious sense, I\nam better suited to worlds that do not contain a homicidal maniac who\nwants to kill me than I am to worlds that do contain such a maniac,\neven if I believe that such a maniac exists. So it seems that the\nideal environment strategy will not correctly include the content of\nthis belief among those it attributes to me. (Related examples are\noffered by Stalnaker 1989, White 1991, and Chalmers 2002.) As\nStalnaker notes (1999: 182\u2013183), Dennett is better understood to\nmean, not that the worlds I am best suited to are those in which I\nwould do best, but rather that they are those with which I am best\nprepared to cope. But refining this account is a challenging task.\n(For instance, martial arts training might prepare me to cope with\ndangers that I do not believe to exist, raising the worry that the\nideal environment strategy on this interpretation will attribute to me\nbeliefs I do not in fact have.)\n",
