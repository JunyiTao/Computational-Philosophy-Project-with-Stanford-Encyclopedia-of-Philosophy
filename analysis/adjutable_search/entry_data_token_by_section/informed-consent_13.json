It is common to\nemphasize that patients cannot possibly be \u201cfully\ninformed\u201d if that would include all facts, or all facts that are\nmaterial to physicians\u2019 decisions. For example, research\nparticipants, who need to know the main risks of participation, do not\nneed to know much about the history of the disease. But how are we to\ndetermine which facts patients and trial participants should be\ninformed about? Three legal standards exist: the professional\nstandard, the reasonable person standard, and the individual standard.\n\n\nThe professional standard mandates informing patients and\nparticipants of those details that it is conventional for\nprofessionals in the field to mention. Once predominant, this standard\nhas lost much of its traction with U.S. courts. Indeed, no\nprofessional convention exists on this issue, and courts have opined\nthat patients should decide which information is pertinent to them.\nThe reasonable person standard mandates disclosing whatever\ndetails a reasonable patient would find pertinent. Finally, the\nindividual standard mandates informing the patient or\nparticipant of those details that she, as a determinate individual, in\nkeeping with her potentially unreasonable conception of the good,\nwould find pertinent if she were otherwise reasonable (Beauchamp and\nChildress 2008, 122f.; Levine 1988, 104\u20135; Berg et al. 2001,\n46\u201352). An argument against requiring the disclosure of\nany risk is that neither advance disclosure nor risk\ncomprehension are necessary for the restoration of trust and for\ndeterring abuse of patients and trial participants; what is necessary\nis only ready patient and trial participant access to the relevant\ninformation in the event that abuse is suspected (Manson and\nO\u2019Neill 2007, 179ff.).\n\nAs with many other \u201cstandards\u201d in medical ethics, the\nquestion arises as to whether they are mere recommended procedures for\ndoctors, judges, and professional educators, or exhibit fundamental\nmoral principles.\n",
