    "main_text": "Social Institutions: An Overview\n1. Social Institutions: An Overview\n\nAny account of social institutions must begin by informally marking\noff social institutions from other social forms. Unfortunately, as\nnoted above, in ordinary language the terms \u201cinstitutions\u201d\nand \u201csocial institutions\u201d are used to refer to a\nmiscellany of social forms, including conventions, rules, rituals,\norganisations, and systems of organisations. Moreover, there are a\nvariety of theoretical accounts of institutions, including\nsociological as well as philosophical ones. Indeed, many of these\naccounts of what are referred to as institutions are not accounts of\nthe same phenomena; they are at best accounts of overlapping fields of\nsocial phenomena. Nevertheless, it is possible, firstly, to mark off a\nrange of related social forms that would be regarded by most theorists\nas being properly describable as social institutions; and, secondly,\nto compare and contrast some of the competing theoretical accounts of\nthe \u201csocial institutions\u201d in question.\n\nSocial institutions in the sense in use in this entry need to be\ndistinguished from less complex social forms such as conventions,\nrules, social norms, roles and rituals. The latter are among the\nconstitutive elements of institutions.\n\nSocial institutions also need to be distinguished from more complex\nand more complete social entities, such as societies or cultures, of\nwhich any given institution is typically a constitutive element. A\nsociety, for example, is more complete than an institution since a\nsociety\u2014at least as traditionally understood\u2014is more or\nless self-sufficient in terms of human resources, whereas an\ninstitution is not. Thus, arguably, for an entity to be a society it\nmust sexually reproduce its membership, have its own language and\neducational system, provide for itself economically and\u2014at least\nin principle\u2014be politically independent.\n\nSocial institutions are often organisations (Scott 2001). Moreover,\nmany institutions are systems of organisations grounded in\neconomic, political etc. spheres of activity (Walzer 1983). For\nexample, capitalism is a particular kind of economic institution, and\nin modern times capitalism consists in large part in specific\norganisational forms\u2014including multi-national\ncorporations\u2014organised into a system. Further, some institutions\nare meta-institutions; they are institutions (organisations)\nthat organise other institutions (including systems of organisations).\nFor example, governments are meta-institutions. The institutional end\nor function of a government consists in large part in organising other\ninstitutions (both individually and collectively); thus governments\nregulate and coordinate economic systems, educational institutions,\npolice and military organisations and so on largely by way of\n(enforceable) legislation.\n\nIn this entry the concern is principally with social institutions\n(including meta-institutions) that are also organisations or systems\nof organisations. However, it should be noted that institutions of\nlanguage, such as the English language, are often regarded not simply\nas institutions but as more fundamental than many other kinds of\ninstitution by virtue of being presupposed by, or in part constitutive\nof, other institutions. Searle, for example, holds to the latter view\n(Searle 1995: 37; Searle 2008). A case might also be made that the\nfamily is a more fundamental institution than others for related\nreasons, e.g. it is the site of sexual reproduction and initial\nsocialisation (Schoeman 1980; Lamanna 2002). \n\nNote also that uses of the term \u201cinstitution\u201d in such\nexpressions as \u201cthe institution of government\u201d, are often\nambiguous. Sometimes what is meant is a particular token, e.g. the\ncurrent government in Australia, sometimes a type, i.e. the set of\nproperties instantiated in any actual government, and sometimes a set\nof tokens, i.e. all governments. Restricting the notion of an\ninstitution to organisations is helpful in this regard; the term\n\u201corganisation\u201d almost always refers to a particular token.\nOn the other hand, the term \u201cinstitution\u201d connotes a\ncertain gravity not connoted by the term \u201corganisation\u201d;\nso arguably those institutions that are organisations are\norganisations that have a central and important role to play in or for\na society. Being central and important to a society, such roles are\nusually long lasting ones; hence institutions are typically\ntrans-generational.\n\nHaving informally marked off social institutions from other social\nforms, let us turn to a consideration of some general properties of\nsocial institutions. Here there are four salient properties, namely,\nstructure, function, culture and sanctions.\n\nRoughly speaking, an institution that is an organisation or system of\norganisations consists (at least) of an embodied (occupied by human\npersons) structure of differentiated roles (Miller 2010; Ludwig 2017).\n(Naturally, many institutions also have have additional non-human\ncomponents, e.g. buildings, raw materials.) These roles are defined in\nterms of tasks, and rules regulating the performance of those tasks.\nMoreover, there is a degree of interdependence among these roles, such\nthat the performance of the constitutive tasks of one role cannot be\nundertaken, or cannot be undertaken except with great difficulty,\nunless the tasks constitutive of some other role or roles in the\nstructure have been undertaken or are being undertaken. Further, these\nroles are often related to one another hierarchically, and hence\ninvolve different levels of status and degrees of authority. Finally,\non teleological and functional accounts, these roles are related to\none another in part in virtue of their contribution to (respectively)\nthe end(s) or function(s) of the institution; and\nthe realisation of these ends or function normally involves\ninteraction among the institutional actors in question and external\nnon-institutional actors. (The assumption here is that the concept of\nan end and of a function are distinct concepts. On some accounts,\nfunction is a quasi-causal notion (Cohen 1978 Chapter IX), on others\nit is a teleological notion, albeit one that does not necessarily\ninvolve the existence of any mental states (Ryan 1970 Chapter 8)). The\nconstitutive roles of an institution and their relations to one\nanother can be referred to as the structure of the\ninstitution. \n\nI note that the common-sense view that an institution consists\n(essentially) of an embodied structure of roles has been thought by\nsome to be undermined by the consideration that actions are ascribed\nto institutions per se (as opposed to their members), e.g. in the\nsentence, \u2018The Supreme Court of the United State ruled that\nsegregation is unconstitutional\u2019, and the fact that an\ninstitution could have had different members than the ones it actually\nhad, e.g. someone other than Brett Kavanaugh might have been nominated\nby President Trump to sit on the Supreme Court and confirmed by the US\nSenate. In response to this kind of argument Ludwig has, in effect,\ndefended the common-sense view by proffering his time-indexed,\nreductive individualist view according to which not only is the\nSupreme Court the group that consists of everyone who is at any time a\nmember of the Supreme Court, but what the Supreme Court does at any\ntime is what the those justices at that time do (Ludwig 2017: 66).\nImportantly, Ludwig points out that the term, \u201cthe Supreme Court\nof the US\u201d functions as a definite description and not a name.\nAs is the case with all definite descriptions, e.g. \u201cthe\nPresident of the US\u201d, the individuals picked out by \u201cthe\nSupreme Court of the US\u201d could have been different (Ludwig 2017:\n68). \n\nAn important distinction relevant to the understanding of\ninstitutional structure can be made between what is constitutive of an\ninstitution, e.g. the judges of the Supreme Court, and what is\nrequired to maintain it in existence, e.g. acceptance of the authority\nof the Supreme Court by the US citizenry. (See sections 3 and 5\nbelow.)\n\nNote that on the conception of institutions as embodied\nstructures of roles and associated rules, the nature of any\ninstitution at a given time will to some extent reflect the personal\ncharacter of different role occupants, especially influential role\noccupants, e.g. the British Government during the Second World War\nreflected to some extent Winston Churchill\u2019s character.\nMoreover, institutions in this sense are dynamic, evolving entities;\nas such, they have a history, the diachronic structure of a narrative\nand (usually) a partially open-ended future.\n\nAside from the formal and usually explicitly stated, or defined, tasks\nand rules, there is an important implicit and informal dimension of an\ninstitution roughly describable as institutional culture.\nThis notion comprises the informal attitudes, values, norms, and the\nethos or \u201cspirit\u201d which pervades an institution. As such,\nit is to be distinguished from the wider notions of culture frequently\nin use among anthropologists. Culture in the wide sense embraces not\nonly informal but also formal elements of institutions, e.g. rules and\nother components of structure (Tylor 1871; Munch and Smelser 1993)).\nCulture in the narrow sense influences much of the activity of the\nmembers of that institution, or at least the manner in which that\nactivity is undertaken. So while the explicitly determined rules and\ntasks might say nothing about being secretive or \u201csticking by\none\u2019s mates come what may\u201d or having a hostile or negative\nattitude to particular social groups, these attitudes and practices\nmight in fact be pervasive; they might be part of the culture\n(Skolnick 2008). \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that in addition to structure, function and\nculture, social institutions necessarily involve sanctions. It is\nuncontroversial that social institutions involve informal sanctions,\nsuch as moral disapproval following on non-conformity to institutional\nnorms. However, some theorists, e.g. Jon Elster (1989: Chapter XV),\nargue that formal sanctions, such as punishment, are a necessary\nfeature of institutions. Formal sanctions are certainly a feature of\nmost, if not all, of those institutions that operate within a legal\nsystem. However, they do not appear to be a feature of all\ninstitutions. Consider, for example, an elaborate and longstanding\nsystem of informal economic exchange among members of different\nsocieties that have no common system of laws or enforced rules.\n\nThus far we have informally marked off social institutions from other\nsocial forms, and we have identified a number of general properties of\nsocial institutions. It is now time to introduce and taxonomize some\nof the main theoretical accounts of social institutions, including\nhistorically important ones. In sections 2, 3 and 4 recent influential\ntheories of social institutions will be discussed in more detail.\n\nNotwithstanding our understanding of social institutions as complex\nsocial forms, some theoretical accounts of institutions identify\ninstitutions with relatively simple social forms\u2014especially\nconventions, social norms or rules. At one level this is merely a\nverbal dispute; contra our procedure here, such simpler forms could\nsimply be termed \u201cinstitutions\u201d. However, at another level\nthe dispute is not merely verbal, since what we are calling\n\u201cinstitutions\u201d would on such a view consist simply of sets\nof conventions, social norms or rules. Let us refer to such accounts\nas atomistic theories of institutions (Taylor 1985: Chapter\n7). Schotter is a case in point (Schotter 1981) as is North\n(1990). The best known contemporary form of atomism is rational choice\ntheory and it has been widely accepted in, indeed it is in part\nconstitutive of, modern economics. The most influential philosophical\ntheory within a broadly rational choice framework is David\nLewis\u2019 theory of conventions (Lewis 1969). According to Lewis,\nconventions are regularities in action that solve coordination\nproblems confronted by individual agents.\n\nThe \u201catoms\u201d within atomistic accounts themselves typically\nconsist of the actions of individual human persons, e.g. conventions\nas regularities in action. The individual agents are not themselves\ndefined in terms of institutional forms, such as institutional roles.\nHence atomistic theories of institutions tend to go hand in glove with\natomistic theories of all collective entities, e.g. a society consists\nof an aggregate of individual human persons. Moreover, atomistic\ntheories tend to identify the individual agent as the locus of moral\nvalue. On this kind of view, social forms, including social\ninstitutions, have moral value only derivatively, i.e. only in so far\nas they contribute to the prior needs, desires or other requirements\nof individual agents.\n\nThe regularities in action (or rules or norms) made use of in such\natomistic accounts of institutions cannot simply be a single\nperson\u2019s regularities in action (or a single person\u2019s\nrules or norms prescribing his or her individual action alone); rather\nthere must be interdependence of action such that, for example, agent\nA only performs action x, if other agents,\nB and C do likewise. Moreover, some account of the\ninterdependence of action in question is called for, e.g. that it is\nnot the sort of interdependence of action involved in conflict\nsituations (although it might arise as a solution to a prior conflict\nsituation).\n\nAssume that the conventions, norms or rules in question are social in\nthe sense that they involve the required interdependence of action,\ne.g. the parties to any given convention, or the adherent to any such\nnorm or rule, conform to (respectively) the convention, norm or rule\non the condition that others do. Nevertheless, such interdependence of\naction is not sufficient for a convention, norm or rule, or even a set\nof conventions, norms or rules, to be an institution. Governments,\nuniversities, corporations etc. are structured, unitary entities.\nAccordingly, a mere set of conventions (or norms or rules)\ndoes not constitute an institution. For example, the set of\nconventions comprising the convention to drive on the left, the\nconvention to utter, \u201cAustralia\u201d, to refer to Australia,\nand the convention to use chopsticks does not constitute an\ninstitution. Accordingly, a problem for atomistic accounts of social\ninstitutions is the need to provide an account of the structure and\nunity of social institutions, and an account that is faithful to\natomism, e.g. that the structure is essentially aggregative in nature.\nOn the other hand, \u2018atomists\u2019 can obviously help\nthemselves to some notion of a bundle of related conventions or rules.\nConsider for instance a set of traffic rules, e.g. \u2018drive on the\nleft\u2019, \u2018do not exceed 35 miles per hour in built up\nareas\u2019 and so on. Moreover, the \u2018bundle\u2019 might\ninclude a variety of types of atomistic social forms, e.g.\nconventions, norms and rules. Guala\u2019s account of institutions\n(Guala 2016) is a case in point, as we shall see in section 2 below.\n\n\nBy contrast with atomistic accounts of social institutions,\nholistic\u2014including\nstructuralist-functionalist\u2014accounts stress the\ninter-relationships of institutions (structure) and their contribution\nto larger and more complete social complexes, especially societies\n(function). Thus according to Barry Barnes (1995: 37):\n\u201cFunctionalist theories in the social sciences seek to describe,\nto understand and in most cases to explain the orderliness and\nstability of entire social systems. In so far as they treat\nindividuals, the treatment comes after and emerges from analysis of\nthe system as a whole. Functionalist theories move from an\nunderstanding of the whole to an understanding of the parts of that\nwhole, whereas individualism proceeds in the opposite\ndirection\u201d. Moreover, (Barnes 1995: 41), \u201csuch accounts\nlist the \u201dfunctions\u201c of the various institutions. They\ndescribe the function of the economy as the production of goods and\nservices essential to the operation of the other institutions and\nhence the system as a whole.\u201d Such theorists include Durkheim\n(1964), Radcliffe-Brown (1958) and Parsons (1968; 1982). Of particular\nconcern to these theorists was the moral decay consequent (in their\nview) upon the demise of strong, mutually supportive social\ninstitutions. Durkheim, for example, advocated powerful professional\nassociations. He said (1957 p.6): \n\nA system of morals is always the affair of a group and can operate\nonly if the group protects them by its authority. It is made up of\nrules which govern individuals, which compel them to act in such and\nsuch a way, and which impose limits to their inclinations and forbid\nthem to go beyond. Now there is only one moral power\u2014moral, and\nhence common to all\u2014which stands above the individual and which\ncan legitimately make laws for him, and that is collective power. To\nthe extent the individual is left to his own devices and freed from\nall social constraint, he is unfettered by all moral constraint. It is\nnot possible for professional ethics to escape this fundamental\ncondition of any system of morals. Since, then, the society as a whole\nfeels no concern in professional ethics, it is imperative that there\nbe special groups in the society, within which these morals may be\nevolved, and whose business it is to see that they are observed.\n\n\nMoreover, here the meta-institution of government obviously has a\npivotal directive and integrative role in relation to other\ninstitutions and their inter-relationships, even though government is\nitself simply one institution within the larger society. Further,\nholistic accounts of institutions lay great stress on institutional\nroles defined in large part by social norms; institutional roles are\nsupposedly largely, or even wholly, constitutive of the identity of\nthe individual human agents who occupy these roles. (Individuals\nparticipate in a number of institutions and hence occupy a number of\ninstitutional roles; hence the alleged possibility of their identity\nbeing constituted by a number of different institutional roles.)\n\nMany such holistic accounts deploy and depend on the model, or at\nleast analogy, of an organism. A salient historical figure here is\nHerbert Spencer (1971, Part 3B\u2014A Society is an\nOrganism). On this holistic, organicist model, social\ninstitutions are analogous to the organs or limbs of a human body.\nEach organ or limb has a function the realisation of which contributes\nto the well-being of the body as a whole, and none can exist\nindependently of the others. Thus the human body relies on the stomach\nto digest food in order to continue living, but the stomach cannot\nexist independently of the body or of other organs, such as the heart.\nLikewise, it is suggested, any given institution, e.g. law courts,\ncontributes to the well-being of the society as a whole, and yet is\ndependent on other institutions, e.g. government. Here the\n\u201cwell-being\u201d of the society as a whole is sometimes\nidentified with the stability and continuation of the society as it\nis; hence the familiar charge that holistic, organicist accounts are\ninherently politically conservative. This political conservatism\ntransmutes into political authoritarianism when society is identified\nwith the system of institutions that constitute the nation-state and\nthe meta-institution of the nation-state\u2014the government\u2014is\nassigned absolute authority in relation to all other institutions.\nHence the contrasting emphasis in political liberalism on the\nseparation of powers among, for example, the executive, the\nlegislature and the judiciary. \n\nHolistic accounts of social institutions often invoke the terminology\nof internal and external relations (Bradley 1935). An internal\nrelation is one that is definitive of, or in some way essential to,\nthe entity it is a relation of; by contrast, external relations are\nnot in this way essential. Thus being married to someone is an\ninternal relation of spouses; if a man is a husband then necessarily\nhe stands in the relation of being married to someone else. Likewise,\nif someone is a judge in a court of law then necessarily he stands in\nan adjudicative relationship to defendants. Evidently, many\ninstitutional roles are possessed of, and therefore in part defined\nby, their internal relations to other institutional roles.\n\nHowever, the existence of institutional roles with internal relations\nto other institutional roles does not entail a holistic account of\nsocial institutions. For the internal relations in question might not\nbe relations among institutional roles in different institutions;\nrather they might simply be internal relations among different\ninstitutional roles in the same institution. On the other hand, the\nexistence of institutional roles with internal relations does\nundermine the attempts of certain forms of atomistic individualism to\nreduce institutions to the individual human agents who happen to\nconstitute them; ex hypothesi, the latter are not qua individual human\npersons in part defined in terms of their relations to institutional\nroles.\n\nIn the context of a discussion of atomistic and holist accounts of\ninstitutions, it is important to distinguish the view that\ninstitutions are not reducible to the individual human persons who\nconstitute them from the view that institutions are themselves agents\npossessed of minds and a capacity to reason (see Section 5). Epstein\n(2015) has offered detailed arguments against the former view,\nincluding in its favoured contemporary form according to which\ninstitutions (and other collective entities) supervene on the\nindividual persons whose roles they occupy. Thus Epstein points out\n(2015: 46) that some facts about the firm, Starbucks, do not depend\n(supervene)on facts about people and the actions they perform but\nrather on facts about coffee, for instance. (See also Ruben\n1985). Peter French (1984) is an advocate of the latter view as are,\nin somewhat different forms, List and Pettit (2011), Tollefsen (2015)\nand Epstein (2015). (See also Margaret Gilbert\u2019s notion of a\n\u201cplural subject\u201d [1989: 200]). Searle (1990), Miller\n(2001) and Ludwig (2017) have argued against the\nproposition that collective entities per se are agents possessed of\nmental states. For instance, Ludwig has offered analyses of sentences\nthat apparently ascribe mental states to collective entities, such as\n\u2018Germany intends to invade Poland\u2019, in terms of the\nintentions of individual members of these entities, and the actions of\ncollective entities in terms of the members of the collective group in\nquestion being agents of an event (Ludwig 2017).\n\nThus far we have discussed atomistic and holistic accounts of social\ninstitutions. However, there is a third possibility, namely, (what\nmight be termed) molecular accounts. Roughly speaking, a\nmolecular account of an institution would not seek to reduce the\ninstitution to simpler atomic forms, such as conventions; nor would it\nseek to define an institution in terms of its relationships with other\ninstitutions and its contribution to the larger societal whole.\nRather, each institution would be analogous to a molecule; it would\nhave constitutive elements (\u201catoms\u201d) but also have its own\nstructure and unity. A number of philosophical theories of social\ninstitutions are explicitly or implicitly molecular in character\n(Harre 1969; Searle 1995; Miller 2010). Moreover, on this conception\neach social institution would have a degree of independence\nvis-\u00e0-vis other institutions and the society at large; on the\nother hand, the set of institutions might itself under certain\nconditions form a unitary system of sorts, e.g. a contemporary liberal\ndemocratic nation-state comprised of a number of semi-autonomous\npublic and private institutions functioning in the context of the\nmeta-institution of government.\n\nA general problem for holistic organicist accounts of social\ninstitutions\u2014as opposed to molecular accounts\u2014is that\nsocial institutions can be responses to trans-societal\nrequirements or needs. Accordingly, an institution is not necessarily\na constitutive element of some given society in the sense that it is\nboth in part constitutive of that society and wholly contained within\nthat society. Examples of such trans-societal institutions are the\ninternational financial system, the international legal system, the\nUnited Nations and some multi-national corporations. Indeed, arguably\nany given element of such a trans-societal institution stands in some\ninternal relations to elements of other societies.\n\nIn this section accounts of institutions have been discussed in\ngeneral terms. It is now time to focus on some specific influential,\ncontemporary philosophical accounts beginning with ones based in\nrational choice theory.\n",
