    "main_text": "\n\nSociobiology is probably best known as the subject of E. O.\nWilson\u2019s Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975), in\nwhich he described it as the \u201csystematic study of the biological\nbasis of all social behavior\u201d (Wilson, 1975, 4). Wilson seems to\nintend \u201cthe biological basis of behavior\u201d to refer to the\nsocial and ecological causes driving the evolution of behavior in\nanimal populations, rather than the neurological or psychological\ncauses of behavior in individuals; however, Wilson clearly thought\nsociobiology and neuroscience would have important theoretical\ninteractions (Wilson, 1975, 5). Wilson\u2019s references to evolution\nare also usually references to evolution by natural selection,\nalthough he does accept that the action of selection on animal\nsocieties can result in maladaptive outcomes at the level of\npopulations (see, for example Wilson, 1975, Chapter 4).\n\nHowever, \u201csociobiology\u201d as a term existed well before\nWilson, sometimes to refer to the kind of work identified by Wilson in\nthe non-human animal part of his book: methodologically adaptationist\napproaches to understanding the causes and nature of non-human animal\nbehavior (see for example, Schein 1956), but also occasionally to work\nof this kind in humans (for example, Ashley-Montagu 1940, Hentig 1948,\nHealey 1949). A few scientists also continue to use the term (for\nexample, Hrdy, 1999, uses the term for this work in both humans and\nnon-human animals). However, during the controversy over Wilson\u2019s\nbook and after most scientists using approaches to non-human animals\nshifted to using other terms, most commonly \u201cbehavioral\necology\u201d (Krebs and Davies, 1978).\n\nFamously, the first and last chapters of Sociobiology\naddressed Wilson\u2019s views about the amenability of human behavior\nto be studied by this sort of project. These views were developed to\nsome extent in his later book, On Human Nature (Wilson,\n1978). For a variety of reasons, primarily because Wilson was\nperceived to be arguing that many problematic social behaviors were\nunchangeable, the contents of these two chapters provoked an extremely\nacrimonious debate sometimes referred to as the \u201csociobiology\nwars\u201d (one well regarded discussion of the history and sociology\nof the \u201csociobiology wars\u201d is Segerstrale, 2000). Because\nthis debate attracted so much attention, the term\n\u201csociobiology\u201d has come to be associated popularly with\nWilson\u2019s proposed human project, or at least the description of it\nset up for attack by its critics (see, for example, Allen et al.,\n1975; Caplan, 1979; Gould, 1977, 251\u2013259; 1978; Sociobiology\nStudy Group of Science for the People, 1976). Wilson\u2019s human\nproject might be called \u201cPop Sociobiology\u201d after Kitcher\n(1985). The critics claimed that \u201cPop Sociobiologists\u201d\nwere committed to a form of genetic determinism, an overly strong\nadaptationism and had a tendency to ignore the effects of learning and\nculture.\n\nThe term \u201csociobiology\u201d is also occasionally used to refer\nto current evolutionary approaches to human behavior, which\nretain the behavioral focus to which Wilson refers (Griffiths, 2008;\nSterelny and Griffiths, 1999). However, while influenced by earlier\nsociobiology, most modern projects studying the evolution of behavior\nseem to have developed a variety of theoretical and methodological\nfeatures of their own (Smith et al., 2001; Winterhalder and Smith,\n1992); perhaps the best way to understand sociobiology in this case is\nin \u201cphylogenetic\u201d terms, as a historical ancestor of these\nprojects. The \u201cdescendants\u201d of sociobiology include\nhuman behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology\n(Cosmides and Tooby, 1987) and more recently, dual inheritance\ntheory (Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman,\n1981). These projects as a group are now sometimes referred to as the\n\u201cevolutionary social sciences\u201d (Smith et al.,\n 2001)[1].\n Over time the different theoretical views and choices of methodology\nhave become entrenched in each project, increasing their disparity;\nthe divisions also partly fall along disciplinary lines, with human\nbehavioral ecologists tending to be anthropologists; evolutionary\npsychologists tending to be cognitive psychologists; and individuals\nworking in dual inheritance theory tending to have some background in\npopulation biology modeling. All three evolutionary social sciences\nretain some of the features of the project that Wilson originally\ndescribed in his book, however; in particular they retain its\nmethodologically adaptationist approach. Of these three, it is human\nbehavioral ecology that is most often called\n\u201csociobiology\u201d due to its focus on the evolution of\nbehavior (evolutionary psychology focuses on the evolution of\npsychological mechanisms or modules such as those for cheater\ndetection; dual inheritance theory studies the cultural evolution of\ntraits that are socially learned).\n\nThis survey will, therefore, focus on three main meanings of\n\u201csociobiology\u201d. First, it will briefly describe the\nrelatively uncontroversial non-human animal behavioral ecology that\nWilson and others described as \u201csociobiology\u201d. Second, it\nwill describe and evaluate the characterization of \u201cPop\nSociobiology\u201d that came under attack by various scientists and\nphilosophers in the mid to late 1970s. Third, it will describe the\nmain features of current human behavioral ecology. The final section\nwill discuss some of the central criticisms raised for sociobiology\nand behavioral ecology in the literature and explore some possible\nresponses to these criticisms.\n",
