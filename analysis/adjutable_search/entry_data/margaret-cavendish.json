    "preamble": "\n\nMargaret Lucas Cavendish was a philosopher, poet, scientist,\nfiction-writer, and playwright who lived in the Seventeenth Century.\nHer work is important for a number of reasons. One is that it lays out\nan early and compelling version of the naturalism that is found\nin current-day philosophy and science. It also offers important\ninsights that bear on recent discussions of the nature and\ncharacteristics of intelligence and the question of whether or not the\nbodies that surround us are minded and intelligent. Another reason\nthat the work of Cavendish is important is that it anticipates some of\nthe central views and arguments that are more commonly associated with\nfigures like Thomas Hobbes and David Hume. She also offers novel and\ncompelling responses to questions that are central to the discussions\nof the Seventeenth Century \u2013 for example, about whether sense\nperception is by means of impressions; about whether human beings are\nfree in a libertarian or a compatibilist sense; about whether there is\nany true disorder in the natural world; about the limits of knowledge,\nand the limits of ideas and language; and about how motion is\ntransferred between bodies. In addition, she takes on important\ndebates in social and political philosophy, with a focus on issues of\nagency and authority. She asks in particular about the relation\nbetween an individual\u2019s desire to live a life with which they identify\nand the receptivity that that desire encounters in the surrounding\nenvironment.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction and Biography\n\nMargaret Lucas was born in 1623 in Colchester, Essex. She did not\nreceive a formal education in disciplines such as mathematics,\nhistory, philosophy, and the classical languages, but she had access\nto scholarly libraries and was an avid reader. She began to put her\nown ideas to paper at a very early age, and although it was regarded\nas unseemly at the time for a woman to be publicly intellectual, she\nwas able to be an intellectual in private in regular conversations\nwith her middle-brother John. This is noteworthy because John was\nalready a well-established scholar: a student of law, philosophy, and\nnatural science, he was fluent in Hebrew, Latin and Greek, and would\neventually become a founding member of the Royal Society (Whitaker\n2002, 11\u201312). In 1643, seeking a life of independence, Lucas\napplied to be a maid of honor at the court of Queen Henrietta Maria.\nWhen the queen was exiled to France in 1644, Lucas accompanied her and\nshortly thereafter met William Cavendish. They married in 1645, and\nwould remain in exile (in Paris, then Rotterdam, then Antwerp) until\nthe restoration of the crown in 1660 (Battigelli 1998,\n1\u201310).\n\nThere are two reasons why it is important to mention the marriage of\nMargaret Lucas and William Cavendish. One is that William regularly\norganized and hosted meetings of the \u201cCavendish Circle\u201d in\nthe 1640s, and attendees included such seventeenth-century giants as\nThomas Hobbes, Rene Descartes, Marin Mersenne, Pierre Gassendi, and\nKenelm Digby (Hutton 1997a, 422\u20133; Whitaker 2002, 92\u20134;\nClucas 1994, 256\u201364). Margaret attended many of these meetings,\nthough we do not know the extent to which she participated. The second\nreason why it is important to mention the marriage of Margaret to\nWilliam is that in the mid-seventeenth-century it was uncommon for a\npublisher to print the philosophical and scientific work of a woman.\nMargaret Cavendish was a sufficiently brilliant and impressive writer\nthat she was able to publish some of her work without assistance\n(Whitaker 2002, 154), including her very first work [Poems and\nFancies, 1653], but her more philosophical writings were\npublished with the assistance of her well-connected husband. At the\ntime women were not taken very seriously as philosophers, and there\nwas not a large market for the work of a woman philosopher to be\ndistributed and discussed. Margaret was extremely proactive about\nmailing copies of her philosophical monographs to scholars and to\nlibraries in England and beyond, along with requests for commentary\nand continued correspondence, but the replies that she received tended\nto be very dismissive. For example, William Charleton wrote back to\nher that\n\nAmong many other things, by which your Grace is pleased to distinguish\nyour self from other Writers, this seems to be not the least\nremarkable; that whereas they imploy only their wit, labour, and time,\nin composing Books, You bestow also great summs of Money in Printing\nYours: and not content to enrich our Heads alone, with your rare\nNotions, you go higher, and adorn our Libraries, with your elegant\nVolumes\u2026. I may have many rivals in these my thankful\nacknowledgements, you can have no Competitor in the Glory of their\noccasions. This double Felicity is augmented by the accession of two\nothers, no less worthy admiration. One is, that as you have\nmade your self an Original, so are you likewise secure from\nbeing Copied. \u2026 You exceed all of your delicate Sex,\nnot only in this age, but in all ages\n past.[1]\n\n\nHere the suggestion is that Cavendish had to expend an unusual sum of\nmoney to have her books printed and that those books are an adornment\non library shelves. Charleton also makes clear that Cavendish need\nhave no fear of being plagiarized. Other scholars and librarians were\nsimilarly dismissive, and with the exception of the case of Joseph\nGlanvill, a common denominator across the letters that Cavendish\nreceived in response is that there is almost no attempt to engage with\nher philosophical arguments and positions, and little evidence of\ntheir having been read (Cunning 2022). Unfortunately and sadly for her\nand for us, Cavendish was not able to participate in a\nphilosophical back-and-forth with her contemporaries. When they would\nnot critically correspond with her in print, she engaged their views\ncritically in the form of a correspondence between herself and a\nfictional third\n person.[2]\n Cavendish wanted to secure a wide correspondence \u2013 \u201cout\nof a love to Truth, and to make my own opinions the more intelligible,\nwhich cannot better be done then by arguing and comparing other mens\nopinions with them. \u2026For a Philosopher or Philosopheress is not\nproduced on a\n sudden.\u201d[3]\n According to Cavendish, no one is a philosopher in a vacuum, just as\nno one is a military general, or barrister, or mathematician, or\ncoach. To develop the skills that are part and parcel of philosophical\ninquiry, and to engage in philosophical debate itself, one needs\ninterlocutors, and one needs to be seen as a potential authority. But\nthe people in her surrounding environment were not going to comply.\nShe left her books on the shelf in the hope that the self-same work\nmight be far more impactful in a future generation.\n\nCavendish lived and wrote in the thick of the mechanistic revolution\nof the seventeenth century, though many of her views\u2014about\nthinking matter, the transfer of motion, and the nature of scientific\nexplanation\u2014are largely anti-mechanistic, and in many respects\nher arguments run against the grain. In her own age, she was regarded\nalternately as mad, pretentious, a curiosity, and a genius. She\nfinally received some much-wanted recognition from her male peers in\n1667, when she was offered an extremely rare invitation to participate\nin a meeting of the Royal Society, though to be sure she was regarded\nas a spectacle by many in attendance (Whitaker 2002, 291\u2013306).\nShe died in December 1673 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Over\nthe course of her short life she produced a number of important works\nin philosophy. These include Worlds Olio (1655),\nPhilosophical and Physical Opinions (1656), Philosophical\nLetters (1664), Observations Upon Experimental\nPhilosophy (1666), The Description of a New World, Called the\nBlazing World (1666), and Grounds of Natural Philosophy\n(1668).\n\nThe central tenet of Cavendish\u2019s philosophy is that everything in the\nuniverse\u2014including human beings and their minds\u2014is\ncompletely material. Her commitment to this tenet is reflected\nthroughout her corpus:\n\nNature is material, or corporeal, and so are all her Creatures, and\nwhatsoever is not material is no part of Nature, neither doth it\nbelong any ways to\n Nature\u2026.[4]\n\n\nAccording to Cavendish, none of the achievements of bodies are to be\ntraced to immaterial agents such as God, immaterial finite minds, or\nsubstantial forms, because bodies have the resources to bring about\neverything that they do on their own. Cavendish also holds that bodies\nare ubiquitous and that there is no vacuum, because extensions of\nspace cannot be extensions of nothing but must be extensions of\n matter.[5]\n Every body is infinitely divisible (Cavendish 1668a, 125, 263;\nCavendish 1668b, 239), and all of the bodies in nature, at every level\nof division, are intelligent and perceptive (Cavendish 1668a, 16, 156;\nCavendish 1668b, 7). As we will see, one of Cavendish\u2019s motivations\nfor accepting the latter view is that it makes sense of the order that\nwe encounter in the natural world.\n\nCavendish is aware that she is writing in a tradition in which the\nprospect of thinking matter is not going to be taken seriously. In the\neyes of many of her contemporaries and predecessors, matter is not\nonly unintelligent, but also inert and utterly worthless. She\nwrites,\n\nI perceive man has a great spleen against self-moving corporeal\nnature, although himself is part of her, and the reason is his\nambition; for he would fain be supreme, and above all other creatures,\nas more towards a divine nature: he would be a God, if arguments could\nmake him\n such\u2026.[6]\n\n\nCavendish does not accept a conception of matter according to which\nmatter is low-grade being. Her view that minds are corporeal is not\nthe view that minds are\n\ncomposed of raggs and shreds, but it is the purest, simplest and\nsubtillest [sic] matter in Nature. (Cavendish 1664, 180)\n\n\nCavendish will argue that the processes that are traditionally\nidentified as material are wondrous and impressive and that the\nprocesses that she would identify as material, but that others would\nidentify as immaterial, are even more so. As we will see, her view on\nthe sophistication of matter also informs other aspects of her\nthinking \u2013 for example, her metaphysics of imagination,\naccording to which imaginings are not static pictures, but living\nfigures that are creative and able to take on a life of their own; and\nalso her view of the superiority of natural productions to human\nartifacts (Lascano 2020). According to Cavendish, the latter are\ncomposed of bodies that are put together quickly and do not have the\nsame history of communication and synchronization as the entities that\ncompose a production of nature (Cunning 2016, 185\u2013196). When\nCavendish says that ideas are material images, or that natural\nproductions are more sophisticated than artifacts, she is not\nsupposing a conception of matter according to which it is static and\ninert and dead. Her own views employ some of the language of the\ntradition \u2013 for example matter, image, and\nidea \u2013 but she fleshes out such terms in novel\ndirections. She does not attempt to create an entirely new\nlanguage, given that no one would understant it. For the most\npart she retains existing terminology and notes the respects in which\nit has been misused or abused.\n\nThe Cavendish corpus is a tour de force, even if Cavendish was not\nrecognized in her own lifetime for the extent of her intellectual\nprowess. She wrote eight philosophical monographs, and she crafted\nplays and poems and fictional pieces that exhibit philosophical\narguments and thought experiments as\n well.[7]\n Her thinking has important implications and tentacles, providing us\nwith insights into the place of human beings in nature, the\ndistinction between the social and the natural, and the\ninterdependence of creatures. She also made significant\ncontributions on other philosophical topics like causation,\nperception, motion, agency, gender, God, and free will. Her views and\narguments might also be interpreted as bearing on contemporary\nmovements in deep ecology and environmental ethics. As we will see,\nshe holds that human beings would benefit from emulating the behavior\nand thinking of nonhuman creatures \u2013 for example in the case of\nsocial organization. However, Cavendish does not appear to have the\nresources to make any normative claims about our impact on nature. She\nadmires nature, but her list of the qualities that pertain to\nbodies include size, figure, motion, activity, thought, and\nperception, and not qualities like goodness and badness. She is also\nnot especially concerned about the long-term viability of the natural\nworld. It will be fine. As an eternal entity, it is not going\nanywhere, even if we happen to impact it in a way that leads to our\nown demise.\n\nCavendish died in 1673 at the early age of 50.\n2. Intelligent Matter in the History of Philosophy\n\nCavendish is working within a philosophical tradition in which the\ndoctrine that matter is self-moving and intelligent is almost\ncompletely unintelligible. To those of her opponents who allow that\nthe doctrine can be entertained, it is unlikely at best, and\nif true it is a terrible disappointment.\n\nFor example, in Plato we find the view that \u201cthe philosopher\nfrees the soul from association with the body as much as\npossible\u201d (Plato, 64e\u201365a). For Plato, souls are invisible and\nintangible and hence indivisible and divine, and bodies are their\ncomplete opposite (78b\u201380b). We know from an analysis of our concept\nof body, and from our presumably related observation of the sudden\ninactivity of things that die, that animated bodies have a soul and\nthat bodies on their own are inert (105c\u2013e). A soul is obviously what\nactivates and enlivens a body, and the opposite of a soul, its body,\nis \u201cdeath\u201d (105e). Our embodiment and our resulting\nphysical needs incline us to pursue sensible objects, but these are\nnot worthy of our attention, and they interfere with our ability to\nattend to things that are.\n\nWe find a similar contempt for the body in prominent philosophers of\nlater ancient philosophy and in medieval and early modern philosophers\nas well. In \u201cOn Beauty,\u201d Plotinus speaks to \u201cthe\ndarkness inherent in matter\u201d (Plotinus, I.6, 37). He praises the\nsensible, but only to the extent that it imitates immaterial ideas and\nminds:\n\nThis is why fire glows with a beauty beyond all other bodies, for fire\nholds the rank of idea in their regard. Always struggling aloft, this\nsubtlest of elements is at the last limits of the bodily. \u2026It\nsparkles and glows like an idea. (Ibid.)\n\n\nFire is still material, of course, and material things are no\nsubstitute for things that are immaterial and (hence) divine (40).\nPlotinus continues,\n\n[A]n ugly soul\u2026 is friend to filthy pleasures, it lives a life\nabandoned to bodily sensation and enjoys its depravity. \u2026If\nsomeone is immersed in mire or daubed with mud, his native comeliness\ndisappears; all one sees is the mire and mud with which he is covered.\nUgliness is due to the alien matter that encrusts him. If he would be\nattractive once more, he has to wash himself, get clean again, make\nhimself what he was before. Thus we would be right in saying that\nugliness of soul comes from its mingling with, fusion with, collapse\ninto the bodily and material\u2026. (39)\n\n\nIn a word, Plotinus thinks that we should do all that we can to\nmitigate the unfortunate fact of our embodiment and instead engage in\nphilosophical reflection. A hundred years later Augustine repeats the\nsame view exactly:\n\nHow highly do you value th[e] will? You surely do not think it should\nbe compared with wealth or honours or physical pleasures, or even all\nof these together. \u2026Then should we not rejoice a little that we\nhave something in our souls\u2014this very thing that I call a good\nwill\u2014in comparison with which those things we mentioned are\nutterly worthless\u2026? (Augustine, 19)\n\n\nFor Augustine, body is so bad that sin consists in turning our\nattention away from eternal things to things that are temporal and\ncorporeal (27). Augustine is working in the Christian tradition, and\nit cannot be ignored that although Christ made a tremendous sacrifice\nin giving up his body, the abandonment of the physical in favor of the\npurely spiritual reads very differently through an Augustinian and\nPlatonic lens.\n\nThis same manner of thinking finds its way into the seventeenth\ncentury as well. In the Cartesian (and very Augustinian and Platonic)\nphilosopher Nicolas Malebranche, we find the view that bodies are\n\u201cinferior things\u201d that are essentially passive and inert\n(Malebranche 1674\u20135, VI.ii.3, 447, 448). He brings together the\nwhole spectrum of themes that are advanced by his body-dismissing\npredecessors. In Dialogues on Metaphysics and on Religion,\nhis spokesperson Theodore says to his opponent Aristes that our\nembodiment is a burden and that we should neutralize it to whatever\nextent we can:\n\nYou are now ready to make thousands and thousands of discoveries in\nthe land of truth. Distinguish ideas from sensations, but distinguish\nthem well\u2026. Your modalities are only darkness, remember that.\nSilence your senses, your imagination and your passions, and you will\nhear the pure voice of inner truth, the clear and evident responses of\nour common master. Never confound evidence, which results from the\ncomparison of ideas, with the vivacity of the sensations which affect\nand disturb you. The more vivid our sensations, the more they spread\ndarkness. \u2026In a word, avoid all that affect you and quickly\nembrace all that enlightens you. We must follow Reason despite the\nseductions, the threats, the insults of the body to which we are\nunited, despite the action of the objects surrounding us. (Malebranche\n1688, III.viii, 36)\n\n\nFor Malebranche, the search for truth is very literally a matter of\nretreating to the study, where the possibility is minimized that we\nwill be distracted by the lures of the sensible world. In\nMalebranche\u2019s (and Cavendish\u2019s) contemporary Ralph Cudworth we find a\nsimilar disgust for the body. Cudworth argues that there is a\nhierarchy of being that applies to creatures and that minds are at the\ntop. Bodies are dead and lowly, and are squarely at the bottom:\n\nThere is unquestionably, a Scale or Ladder of\nNature, and Degrees of Perfection and\nEntity, one above another, as of Life,\nSense, and Cogitation, above Dead, Sensless and\nUnthinking Matter; or Reason and\nUnderstanding above Sense,\n &c.[8]\n\n\nCudworth is certainly aware that the bodies that surround us are\nactive and engage in behaviors that are orderly and (at least\napparently) teleological, but none of this is evidence that matter is\nnot dead. Cudworth concludes that because matter is dead, its\norderly and purposive behavior can only be explained on the assumption\nthat it is accompanied by a (necessarily immaterial) guide (Cunning\n2003).\n\nThere are other philosophers in the seventeenth century who agree that\nmatter is a detestable sort of being, but conclude that it does not\nexist, or at least that it does not exist as conceived by the\ntradition. In Anne Conway we find the view that God would not, and did\nnot, create it:\n\nhow can any dead thing proceed from him or be created by him, such as\nmere body or matter\u2026? It has truly been said that God does not\nmake death. It is equally true that he did not make any dead thing,\nfor how can a dead thing come from him who is infinite life and love?\nOr, how can any creature receive so vile and diminished an essence\nfrom him (who is so infinitely generous and good)\u2026? (Conway\n1690, 45)\n\n\nFor Conway, God creates only beings that are alive, and so the\neveryday objects that surround us are something other than what\nPlotinus, Malebranche and Cudworth had thought. There exists\nnothing that is brutish, inert, and unthinking, and instead there is a\ncontinuum of creatures that exist on a spectrum from highly\nintelligent and active to largely dim and dull. Cavendish agrees with\nConway that nothing answers to the traditional conception of matter,\nbut unlike Conway she is happy to say that matter surrounds us.\nCavendish and Conway are for the most part in agreement;\nCavendish simply rejects the traditional conception of matter as\ninadequate, and then proceeds to argue that the things that our\nconcept of matter has always picked out\u2014the things that our\nlanguage has designated as \u2018material\u2019\u2014are something\nmore (Borcherding 2022). Unlike many of her opponents, Cavendish is\nnot disappointed by the result that minds are material. She thinks on\nthe contrary that it is a source of hope. For example, if we\nappreciate that minds are corporeal, we will be able to come up with\nbetter and more systematic and less groping treatments of mental\n illness.[9]\n As evidence for her view, she points to the obvious facts that a\nperson\u2019s mood and energy are affected by nutrition (Cavendish 1663,\n431\u20132), and that old age and injury to the brain can neutralize\nsome of our cognitive functions (Cavendish 1668b, 85\u20136, 113;\nCavendish 1663, 334\u20135). Cavendish is breaking with her tradition\nand arguing that the fulfillment of a person is not a matter of\nturning away from the body but understanding all of its dynamics and\nembracing\n it.[10]\n3. Material minds\n\nAn important strand in Cavendish\u2019s argument for materialism is her\ndefense of the view that minds are material. One of her arguments for\nthis view begins with the assumption that our minds are housed in our\nbodies. She assumes that we are being serious when we say that our\nthinking takes place in the head, and concludes that to the extent to\nwhich we are speaking literally our thoughts must have figure and be\nspatially situated:\n\nI would ask those, that say the Brain has neither sense, reason, nor\nself-motion, and therefore no Perception; but that all proceeds from\nan Immaterial Principle, and an Incorporeal Spirit, distinct from the\nbody, which moveth and actuates corporeal matter; I would fain ask\nthem, I say, where their Immaterial Ideas reside, in what part or\nplace of the Body? \u2026[I]f it [the spirit] have no dimension, how\ncan it be confined in a material\n body?[11]\n\n\nSince \u201c[p]lace [is] an attribute that belongs onely to a\nBody\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 8), minds and their ideas are material.\nThinking does not take place only in the brain, according to\nCavendish. She will argue that it is ubiquitous in nature and that, in\nthe case of a human being, it pervades the brain and the rest of the\nbody.\n\nA related reason that Cavendish offers in favor of the view that\nthinking is material is that\n\nThough Matter might be without Motion, yet Motion cannot be without\nmatter; for it is impossible (in my opinion) that there should be an\nImmaterial Motion in\n Nature.[12]\n\n\nCavendish takes it to be obvious that only material things move. That\nis to say, there is no immaterial motion. She also takes it to be\nobvious that if a person is thinking and their body partakes of\nmotion, their mind partakes of motion as well. In the current day we\nmight be at the airport, thinking about a philosophical question, and\nthen we might continue to think about the question midflight, and then\nwe might finally give the question a rest when we have arrived at our\ndestination. Our thinking took place at the airport, and on the plane,\nand at our final stop. Taking issue with the ancient Greek philosopher\nProtagoras, she writes,\n\nI cannot conceive how it is possible, that \u2026 the Soul, being\nincorporeal, can walk in the air, like a body; for incorporeal beings\ncannot have corporeal actions, no more then corporeal beings can have\nthe actions of incorporeals. (Cavendish 1668d, 368)\n\n\nIf minds do travel, and Cavendish supposes that they do, then they are\nmaterial. Cavendish indeed supposes that minds partake of all kinds of\n motion.[13]\n She holds that the \u201crational\u201d parts of the mind\n\u201cmove freely without Burdens\u201d (Cavendish 1668b, 5) \u2013\nfor example, when the mind quickly assembles an image of an entity.\nIdeas are extremely active in their motions, according to Cavendish,\nand she supposes that only material things move. Note however that in\nholding that ideas move, she does not want to say that they move from\nplace to place. That is because strictly speaking Cavendish does not\nhold that there is such a thing as place or location that bodies\ninhabit. Instead, a body and its place are identical (Cavendish 1668a,\n4). For Cavendish, what it means to say that a body moves will be a\nfunction of its mereological relations to the bodies that surround it\n(Peterman 2019).\n\nIn bringing together the datum that minds move and the premise that\nimmaterial things do not partake of motion, Cavendish anticipates a\nline of argumentation that we later find in Locke:\n\nNo Body can imagine, that his Soul can think, or move a Body at\nOxford, whilst he is at London; and cannot but know,\nthat being united to his Body, it constantly changes place all the\nwhole Journey, between Oxford and London, as the\nCoach, or Horse does, that carries him; and, I think, may be said to\nbe truly all that while in motion\u2026. (Locke 1689, 307)\n\n\nLocke only hints at the conclusion that minds are material, but\nCavendish by contrast is not concerned to pull any\n punches.[14]\n The thesis that matter thinks is an unrevisable element of her\nphilosophical system. It is not an unwelcome appendage but instead is\na straightforward consequence of tenets that she takes to be obvious.\nCavendish is also cornering her opponent into explaining what the\nsense is in which minds move or are housed in our brains if they\nare not material. A figure like Leibniz is comfortable elucidating the\nnature of (immaterial) minds in terms of the language of mirrors,\ndizziness, and spatial perspective (Monadology, sections\n83, 21, 57). Cavendish is insisting that the language of dimension and\nmotion applies to bodies alone.\n\nAn objection of course is that there is something odd in saying that\nminds move or that they are spatial. There are plenty of figures in\nthe history of philosophy who have posited the existence of entities\nthat are not in space, even though these entities still in some way\napply to, or are a part of, everyday objects. Most famous, perhaps, is\nPlato\u2019s positing of the existence of numbers, perfect geometrical\nfigures, and other universal entities. Here Cavendish and her\nopponents are presumably at loggerheads. There may be something odd\nabout saying that minds move, she would insist, but there is something\neven more odd about saying that the entirety of person partakes of\nmotion without their mind partaking of motion as well. She might grant\nthat perhaps there are immaterial minds \u2013 and also numbers and\ngeometrical figures, etc. \u2013 that exist in a non-spatial Platonic\nrealm, but she would insist that these are not what we are referencing\nwhen we speak of the minds by which we deliberate on earth and have\nideas. The latter minds travel with us when we move and are material.\nCavendish is in effect imploring us to take seriously that the\nlanguage of moving minds is only unusual against the background of an\nimpoverished conception of matter.\n\nAnother argument that Cavendish puts forward for the view that\nthinking is material is from mind-body interaction. First, she\npresupposes a standard materialist premise: that nothing can interact\nwith or come into contact with a body but a body. She writes,\n\n\nIn fine, I cannot conceive, how a Spirit \u2026 can have the effects\nof a body, being none it self; for the effects flow from the cause;\nand as the cause is, so are its effects\u2026. (Cavendish 1664,\n197)\n\nit is, in my opinion, more probable, that one material should act upon\nanother material, or one immaterial should act upon another\nimmaterial, then that an immaterial should act upon a material or\ncorporeal. (Cavendish 1664, 207)\n\n\nThis is a standard kind of argument that we find in philosophers\nranging from Lucretius to Gassendi to Spinoza to Searle: that things\ncannot stand in causal relations with bodies unless they are material\n themselves.[15]\n Our minds interact with our bodies on a regular basis, but the\ninteraction of immaterials and materials is impossible, and so minds\nmust be material also.\n\nWe might worry that Cavendish has only provided reason to think that\nthe minds with which our bodies interact are material. Perhaps human\nbeings have bodies and material minds, and in addition we have an\nimmaterial mind (or soul) that is something above and beyond our\nmaterial mind. In a way she actually concedes the point:\n\n\nthere may be supernatural spiritual beings or substances in Nature,\nwithout any hinderance to Matter or corporeal Nature. The same I may\nsay of the natural material, and the divine and supernatural Soul; for\nthough the divine Soul is in a natural body, and both their powers and\nactions be different, yet they cause no ruine or disturbance to each\n other\u2026.[16]\n\n\nHere Cavendish is allowing that for all we know there exist immaterial\nentities like a divine and supernatural soul, but if so, we do not\ndetect any such entities, and they are not the things that we are\nreferencing when we talk about the minds by which we think and have\nideas. Those interact with bodies, and partake of motion, and\nhence they are material. If there is a divine and supernatural soul,\nour material minds (and bodies) cannot interact with it, and we cannot\ndetect it. Cavendish writes,\n\n\nWherefore no part of nature (her parts being corporeal) can perceive\nan immaterial; because it is impossible to have a perception of that\nwhich is not perceptible, as not being an object fit or proper for\ncorporeal\n perception.[17]\n\n[N]atural reason cannot know nor have naturally any perception or idea\nof an Incorporeal being. (Cavendish 1668a, 78)\n\nBut as for Immaterial, no mind can conceive that, for it cannot put it\nself into nothing, although it can dilate and rarifie it self to an\nhigher degree, but must stay within the circle of natural\n bodies\u2026.[18]\n\n\nThere might exist immaterial souls, Cavendish seems to be\nallowing in these passages, but if immaterial souls do exist we cannot\nperceive or form ideas of them. Furthermore, the entities that we\ndo conceive and discuss are not those immaterials but\nsomething else.\n\nSometimes Cavendish comes close to saying something even stronger:\nthat finite immaterial things have no being or reality at all. For\nexample, she writes,\n\n[Immaterial things are] Non-beings, for they are the weakest of all,\nand can do her [Nature] the least hurt, as not being able to obstruct\nreal and corporeal actions of Nature\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 242)\n\n\nHere she is agreeing with her contemporary Thomas Hobbes, who argued\nthat spirits exist but that the only existents are things that inhabit\nspace and have dimension, and so spirits are material. He holds\nthat\n\nThe World, (I mean no the Earth onely, that denominates the Lovers of\nit Worldly men, but the Universe, that is, the whole\nmasse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that is to say, Body; and\nhath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length, Breadth, and Depth:\nalso every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath the like\ndimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe, is Body; and\nthat which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And because the\nUniverse is All, that which is no part of it, is Nothing; and\nconsequently no where. Nor does it follow from hence, that\nSpirits are nothing: for they have dimensions, and are therefore\nreally Bodies\u2026. (Hobbes 1651, xlvi.15, 463)\n\n\nHere Hobbes is suggesting that even God is a body, if God in fact has\nany reality, but Cavendish will not go quite that far. In one passage\nshe says that God is an immaterial, and is the only immaterial:\n\nan Immaterial, in my opinion, must be some uncreated Being; which can\nbe no other than GOD alone. Wherefore, created Spirits, and Spiritual\nSouls, are some other thing than an Immaterial; for surely, if there\nwere any other Immaterial Beings, besides the Omnipotent God, these\nwould be so near the Divine Essence of God, as to be petty gods,\nwould, almost, make the power of an Infinite God. But God is\nOmnipotent, and only God. (Cavendish 1668b, 239)\n\n\nIn the preponderance of passages Cavendish says that there are no\nnatural finite immaterials, and so she appears to allow that\nnon-natural finite immaterials might have some being or other. She\nsubsccribes to the view that only material things are real and\n substantial,[19]\n but perhaps she just holds that our word \u2018real\u2019 picks out\nthings that are tangible and spatial, even if there are other\nexistents as well. Cavendish suggests as much when she says that we\nmight be surrounded by immaterials, but that we cannot detect them.\nShe also writes,\n\n\nall that is called Immaterial, is a Natural Nothing, and an Immaterial\nNatural Substance, in my opinion, is non-sense\u2026. (Cavendish\n1664, 321)\n\n\nCavendish is committed to saying that the ideas and minds that we\nencounter are a part of nature and are material. Presumably she is\nright to hold that there might exist other things as well, even if\nthey are nothing to us.\n\nA problem that arises however is that as we have seen Cavendish holds\nthat we cannot form ideas of immaterials. If so, it is not clear how\n(on her view) we can have the thought that immaterials might exist.\nCavendish suggests very strongly that we can think and speak of\nimmaterials in her remark that they might in fact surround us; she\nsays that even if they did, we would be none the wiser. But still the\nquestion remains about how Cavendish can allow that we are able to\nthink or talk about immaterials at all, if we are not able to\nperceive, detect or have ideas of them.\n\nThere are a number of ways that Cavendish might maneuver here. One\nwould be to defend the thesis that although our natural (and hence\nmaterial) minds can form no conception of an immaterial, there is\nanother aspect of our minds \u2014 an aspect that is not material\n\u2014 and it can form conceptions of immaterials. Cavendish\nhints at this thesis when she states that natural reason cannot\nhave an idea of an incorporeal being, leaving open that non-natural\nreason could have an idea of an incorporeal being. A problem of course\nis that Cavendish does not seem to be able to allow that natural\nreason can have an idea of non-natural reason or that it can put\nforward the thesis that non-natural reason can form conceptions of\nimmaterials.\n\nAnother maneuver would be to make a distinction between knowledge and\nfaith and argue that although our minds cannot detect immaterials or\nhave any evidence for their existence, there must be some way in which\nour minds are able to conceive of immaterials (such as God), or else\nwe would not even be capable of faith. Cavendish writes for example\nthat\n\n\nthe rational [component of the mind] perceives some effects of the\nomnipotent power of God; which effects are perceptible by finite\ncreatures, but not his infinite nature, nor essence, nor the cause of\nhis infiniteness and omnipotency. (Ibid., 90)\n\n\nA problem of course is that if Cavendish is committed to the view that\nnatural reason can form no conception of an immaterial, then she can\nallow that we have ideas of things that are the effect of an\nimmaterial cause, but it is difficult to see how we could have an idea\nof that immaterial cause itself. So long as she \u201ctake[s]\nan idea to be the picture of some object\u201d (Cavendish 1668,\n74) and so long as immaterials cannot be captured in a figure or\nimage, it would appear that she is committed to saying that we can\nhave no ideas of immaterials at all.\n\nA third maneuver that Cavendish could make is to say that when she\ntalks in the language of immaterials, she is using terms that she does\nnot take to be referential, but that are still serving an important\ncommunicative role. For example, when she speaks of the immaterial\nsouls that might surround us, and the way in which they would be\nnothing to us, she might be trying to make a point in the language of\nher opponents. They speak in terms of immaterials, and\nCavendish might want to attempt to engage them. She says for example\nat the start of Philosophical Letters,\n\nI shall meerly go upon the bare Ground of Natural Philosophy,\nand not mix Divinity with it, as many Philosophers use to do, except\nit be in those places, where I am forced by the Authors Arguments to\nreflect upon it, which shall yet be rather with an expression of my\nignorance, then a positive declaration of my opinion of judgment\nthereof; for I think it not onely an absurdity, but an injury to the\nholy Profession of Divinity to draw her to the Proofs in Natural\nPhilosophy; wherefore I shall strictly follow the Guidance of\nNatural Reason, and keep to my own ground and Principles as\nmuch as I can\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 3)\n\n\nA potential problem for the view that Cavendish is making this third\nmaneuver in all cases in which she uses the word \u201cGod\u201d is\nthat there are texts outside of Philosophical Letters in\nwhich she uses the word but is not directly responding to the view of\na theistic opponent. But she is also clear in numerous passages that\nwe have no idea of God or any other immaterials, and no idea of\ninfinitude, and so it is likely that in those texts she is responding\nto a presumptive opponent, or perhaps just that she is being careful\nto articulate her piety.\n\nA final argument that Cavendish offers for the view that matter thinks\nand is intelligent is from the orderly behavior of bodies. One of the\nlongstanding puzzles of seventeenth-century philosophy and science was\nhow to explain this behavior. Cudworth lays out the puzzle very\nneatly. First, he offers a trilemma:\n\nsince neither all things are produced Fortuitously, or by the Unguided\nMechanism of Matter, nor God himself may reasonably be thought to do\nall things Immediately and Miraculously; it may well be concluded,\nthat there is a Plastick Nature under him, which as an\nInferior and Subordinate Instrument, doth Drudgingly Execute that Part\nof his Providence, which consists in the Regular and Orderly Motion of\nMatter. (Cudworth 1678, 150)\n\n\nCudworth settles on the third horn of the trilemma after ruling out\nthe other two. Bodies are dumb and dead, and so are not the source of\ntheir own order, and it would be beneath God to attend to bodily\naffairs Himself (Cunning 2003, 348\u201350). Cudworth also considers\na fourth option\u2014that the orderly behavior of bodies is secured\nby the existence of laws of\n nature.[20]\n He concludes that it is not an additional option after all but is\nsubsumed by the other three:\n\nThese men (I say) seem not very well to understand themselves in this.\nForasmuch as they must of necessity, either suppose these their\nLaws of Motion to execute themselves, or else be\nforced perpetually to concern the Deity in the Immediate Motion of\nevery Atom of Matter throughout the Universe, in Order to the\nExecution and Observation of them\u2026 we cannot make any other\nConclusion than this, That they do but unskillfully and unawares\nestablish that very Thing which in words they oppose; and that their\nLaws of Nature concerning Motion, are\nReally nothing else, but a Plastick Nature\u2026 (Cudworth\n1678, 151)\n\n\nHere Cudworth is pointing out, and Cavendish will agree, that we do\nnot account for the orderly behavior of bodies by positing laws of\nnature if we do not know what a law of nature is or how it operates.\nOn Cudworth\u2019s view, the orderly behavior of bodies is secured by\nimmaterial minds (or plastic natures) that attach to bodies and work\nto keep them on the rails. In something like the way that our\n(immaterial) minds intelligently guide our bodies, plastic natures\nintelligently guide the bodies that compose the plant and animal and\nmineral world. Cavendish agrees with a [highly modified] version of\nthis last statement. She will raise the objection, though, that minds\nthat move and come into contact with and attach to bodies must be\nmaterial themselves.\n\nLike Cudworth, Cavendish generates her view on the orderly behavior of\nbodies from a rejection of the Epicurean doctrine that the order that\nwe encounter in nature arises by chance. She writes,\n\n[T]hough the Opinion of Atoms is as Old as from the Time of Epicurus,\nyet my Conceptions of their Figures, Creating and Disposing, are New,\nand my Own. \u2026 It is not probable that the Substance of Infinite\nmatter is only Infinite, Small, Senseless Fibres, Moving and Composing\nall Creatures by Chance, and that Chance should produce all things in\nsuch order and Method, unless every Single Atome were Animated Matter,\nhaving Animated Motion, which is Sense and Reason, Life and\n Knowledge.[21]\n\n\nSomething is keeping bodies in line, according to Cavendish, and to do\nits job it must be active and knowledgeable and perceptive. It cannot\nbe immaterial, however, and so\n\nIf nature were not Self-knowing, Self-living, and also Perceptive, she\nwould run into Confusion: for there could be neither Order, nor\nMethod, in Ignorant\n motion\u2026.[22]\n\n\nCavendish rejects the view that matter is not capable of engaging in\norderly behavior on its own. It does not require the assistance of a\nplastic nature, for example, and it is not clear how such a thing\ncould be of any help anyway. Cavendish is indeed shocked at the\ntemerity of those who think that we can speak intelligibly of an\nimmaterial divine being but then allow that some of its creatures\nwould be dead and barren. She writes,\n\nI cannot imagine why God should make an Immaterial Spirit to be the\nProxy or Vice-gerent of his Power, or the Quarter-master General of\nhis Divine Providence, as your Author is pleased to style it, when he\nis able to effect it without any Under-Officers, and in a more easie\nand compendious way, as to impart immediately such self-moving power\nto Natural Matter, which man attributes to an Incorporeal Spirit.\n(Cavendish 1664, 215)\n\n\nCavendish does not appear to allow that we can speak intelligibly of\nGod (or other immaterials), and so here she is presumably just\ngranting some theistic assumptions for the sake of argument. She is\nsaying that if Cudworth and others are correct that God is an\nimpressive creator, He would not have created lousy bodies along with\nhigh-grade minds to keep them on the rails; he would have made\nhigh-grade bodies that are able to exhibit order on their\n own.[23]\n They would be knowledgeable of the order that they are supposed to\nrealize, and they would know the details of the bodies in their\n vicinity.[24]\n4. Panpsychism\n\nCavendish does not think that thinking is restricted to human brains\nand nervous systems. She argues that thinking takes place across the\nspectrum of creatures \u2013 from human beings to non-human animals,\nto insects and cells, and to all of creaturely reality. For Cavendish\nmentality is ubiquitous throughout the entire universe.\n\nFirst she cites what she takes to be obvious data about particular\nnon-human animals. She writes,\n\nthe knowledge of other Creatures many times gives information to Man:\nAs for example, the Egyptians are informed how high the River Nilus\nwill rise by the Crocodil\u2019s building her nest higher or lower,\nwhich shews, that those Creatures fore-see or fore-know more then Man\ncan do: also many Birds fore-know the rising of a Tempest, and shelter\nthemselves before it comes: the like examples might be given of\nseveral other sorts of Animals. (Cavendish 1668c, 297)\n\n\nThen she supposes that the same applies to insects like ants and bees\nand spiders. In what is basically an ode to the ant, she writes,\n\nA Company of Ants meeting together, chose the Root, or bottom thereof,\nto build a City; they build after one fashion, which is like a Hill,\nor half-Globe, the outside being Convex, the inside Concave; a Figure,\nit seems, they think most lasting, and least subject to Ruin\u2026.\nThey, being Wiser than Man, know Time is precious; and therefore\njudiciously order it, forecasting while they work, and taking up the\nwhole time with Contrivance\u2026. Likewise, they are careful of\nRepairs, lest Ruin should grow upon them; insomuch, that if the least\nGrain of Dust be misplaced, they stop, or close it up again.\n\u2026So their care and affection is not less to bury their Dead.\n(Cavendish 1671, 280\u201382)\n\n\nAccording to Cavendish, crocodiles and birds exhibit extremely\nsophisticated behavior that is guided by intelligence and mentality.\nSo do ants and other insects. And so do other creatures that we might\nsuppose are too primitive to think. She indeed supposes that cells and\nother microscopic creatures are mindful as well:\n\n\nthe Elemental Creatures are as excellent as Man, and\u2026 I cannot\nperceive more abilities in Man then in the rest of natural\nCreatures\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 147)\n\nLife and knowledg is animate matter, and is in all parts of all\nCreatures. (Ibid., 514)\n\n\nCavendish supposes that it is obvious that there is mentality\nin all creatures. She looks around; she sees it; and she describes\nwhat she takes to be in front of her.\n\nBut someone might object that it is only metaphorical to say that ants\nand spiders \u2013 or cells \u2013 exhibit mentality. Perhaps they\nare just a kind of machine, and Cavendish is anthropomorphisizing when\nshe insists (and projects) otherwise. So she also makes sure to back\nher contention with arguments.\n\nOne especially clever argument begins with the assumption that human\nbrains think. That seems fair enough. Then Cavendish argues that the\nonly way that human brains could think is if the elemental bodies that\ncompose the brain were also mental and perceptive. In effect, she is\nasking the question: if the physical elements that make up the brain\nare entirely non-mental \u2013 and exhibit no trace of mentality\n\u2013 how could they add up to a larger brain that thinks? If the\nbasic elements of the brain do not have any mentality at all, then\nthey could not combine together into a larger body that thinks. That\nwould be magic, and Cavendish is not going to appeal to magic in her\nexplanations of things. Non-mental elements could certainly combine\ntogether to compose a larger thing that is also not mental or minded.\nBut if elements combine together to form a brain that thinks, then\nthose elements must have some trace of mentality or\n proto-mentality.[25]\n She writes,\n\nI shall never be able to conceive, how senseless and irrational Atomes\ncan produce sense and reason, or a sensible and rational body, such as\nthe soul is\u2026. \u2018Tis true, different effects may proceed\nfrom one cause or principle; but there is no principle, which is\nsenseless, can produce sensitive effects; nor no rational effects can\nflow from an irrational cause\u2026 (Cavendish 1668d, 375)\n\n\nHere Cavendish is taking a stand on a critical question of the early\nmodern period \u2013 the question of how bodies would be able to\nthink if their most basic features did not include mentality of some\nkind. Many of her contemporaries argued that the most basic features\nof body are extensive features like size, shape and motion; they\nconcluded that bodies cannot think because there is no way to explain\nhow thinking would arise or emerge from building blocks that are\nutterly non-mental. Descartes is an example (Descartes 1644, I.53,\n210\u20131), as is Malebranche:\n\nCan a thing extended in length, width, and depth reason, desire,\nsense? Undoubtedly not, for all the ways of being of such an extended\nthing consist only in relations of distance; and it is evident that\nthese relations are not perceptions, reasonings, pleasures, desires,\nsensations\u2014in a word, thoughts. Therefore this I that\nthinks, my own substance, is not a body, since my perceptions, which\nsurely belong to me, are something entirely different from relations\nof distance. (Malebranche 1688, 6)\n\n\nFor Malebranche, \u201cthe ways of being\u201d of a body are\nrestricted to what can be understood as bearing relations of distance\nto other things. It is impossible to conceive of a thought as having a\nsize, or as being a certain distance from another thought or from a\nbody, so a thought is not a body or the property of a body.\n\nCavendish turns the debate on its head. In a nutshell, she argues that\nif elemental bodies do not exhibit an iota of mentality, then human\nbrains would not exhibit an iota of mentality. But human brains\ndo exhibit mentality. Therefore the smaller elemental bodies\nthat compose the brain exhibit mentality as well. Those bodies that\nmake up the brain have electrons and protons (although that language\nwas not yet available in the Seventeenth Century); they also have a\nkind of proto-mentality and perception.\n\nCavendish would then just need to appeal to the assumption that the\nbodies that make up the brain are not essentially different from the\nbodies that compose everything else. Or better put: she would\nneed to appeal to the assumption that the elemental bodies that\nmake up the bodies that make up the brain are not essentially\ndifferent from the elemental bodies that compose the bodies that make\nup everything else. She takes that assumption to be confirmed in the\nbehavior of the bodies that surround us. We might again consider bees,\nor ants, or the natural and highly sophisticated processes by which an\neyeball is produced, or the process of the formation of metal. She\nwrites,\n\nI cannot perceive more abilities in Man then in the rest of natural\nCreatures; for though he can build a stately House, yet he cannot make\na Honey-comb; and though he can plant a Slip, yet he cannot make a\nTree; though he can make a Sword, or Knife, yet he cannot make the\nMettal. (Cavendish 1664, 147)\n\n\nWe can create a sword, but we cannot create the metal that makes up a\nsword. Perhaps we can do it in the current day, but Cavendish would\ninsist that if so, nature figured it out first, and we are just\nimitating the skill of nature and following its lead. There is also a\nsense in which we can make a tree, but not really. We can certainly\nplant a shrub, or what Cavendish is calling a \u201cslip.\u201d But\nwhen we do that, we aren\u2019t doing all the productive work, and\nindeed the contribution on our end is fairly minimal. We put a seed or\nshrub in the ground and water it, and a tree eventually forms. All of\nthe real work is done by the complicated genetic and physical\nstructure of the seed or shrub, and if it did not have that structure,\nwe could water the thing all day long and nothing would grow. Two\npeople might also announce that they made a baby together, but\nthe same applies again: the real legwork is done by the sophistication\nof the reproductive organs and the infrastructure by which nutrition\nis redistributed to the growing fetus \u2013 for example through the\nplacenta. A human being forms, and it consists of things like the\nhuman eye, which is about as intricate an entity as could be. Perhaps\nwe have caught up to nature in some instances \u2013 for\nexample we can now create synthetic seeds that become plants\n\u2013 but again Cavendish would insist that in such a case we are\nimitating the wisdom of nature and that nature figured it out first.\nBut we still cannot make a human eye or much else that nature has been\nmanufacturing seamlessly and skillfully for eons.\n\nCavendish accordingly concludes that the wisdom that is exhibited in\nnatural bodies is often of a higher order than the wisdom that is\nexhibited in human beings. Indeed we are at our best when we imitate\nnature:\n\nNatural reason is above artific[e]: wherefore those Arts are the best\nand surest Informers, that alter Nature least, and they the greatest\ndeluders that alter Nature most. (Cavendish 1668a, 12\u201313)\n\n\nNon-human bodies are intelligent and creative, according to Cavendish,\nand they communicate with each other in the course of bringing about\nimpressive and coordinated feats. She writes,\n\nit is well to be observed, that there being an entercourse and\ncommerce, as also an acquaintance and agreement between parts and\nparts, there must also of necessity be some knowledg or perception\nbetwixt them. that is, one part must be able to perceive another part,\nand the actions of that same part; for wheresoever is life and\nknowledg, that is, sense and reason, there is also perception; and\nthough no part of Nature can have an absolute knowledg, yet it is\nneither absolutely ignorant, but it has a particular knowledge, and\nparticular perceptions, according to the nature of its own innate and\ninterior figure. (Ibid., 165)\n\n\nThe bodies that compose an artifact are also natural bodies, of\ncourse, and so they have a history of perception and communication\nwith the bodies with which they are standardly continguous, but human\nartifice is often a matter of extracting such bodies from their normal\ncontext and putting them in a position that is foreign and unfamiliar.\nThese bodies are still perceptive, but the combinations into which\nthey are forced to enter are not as well-functioning. An everyday\nexample that might shed light on Cavendish\u2019s thinking here is the\ndifference between an office staff of individuals who have a long\nhistory of working together and a group of office workers that was\njust recently assembled. Statistically speaking the first group would\nbe able to get a lot more done. Or perhaps a better example is Muppet\nMan.\n\nCavendish would also appeal to the order that is exhibited throughout\nthe natural world as evidence for her view that thinking is\nubiquitous. As we have seen, she holds that bodies do not exhibit\norderly behavior unless they are guided by intelligence and mentality.\nOrder is exhibited throughout nature, and so mentality abounds.\n\nNote however that Cavendish is not thereby committed to the view that\nnon-human creatures exhibit the same kind of thinking as human beings.\nShe writes that\n\nthere are different Knowledges, in different Creatures; \u2026 they are\ndifferent Knowledges proper to their kind, (as, Animal-kind,\nVegetable-kind, Mineral-kind, Elemental-kind) and are also different\nKnowledges in several sorts: As for example, Man may have a different\nKnowledg from Beasts, Birds, Fish, Flies, Worms, or the like; and yet\nbe no wiser than those sorts of Animal-kinds. (Cavendish 1668b,\n163\u201364)\n\n\nShe then offers the same kind example that we find later in the work\nof Cudworth, who also held that thinking is ubiquitous in nature,\nthough he argued that thinking is immaterial. If we worry that it\nsounds odd to say that there is thinking in trees, cells, and other\nbodies that exhibit order, Cudworth notes that not all thinking is the\nhighly conscious and reflective variety that is showcased by\nDescartes. Instead, there is the intelligence that is exhibited by the\nfingers of the \u201cexercised lutonist\u201d \u2013 fingers that\nare able to create beautiful music without being conscious (Cudworth\n1678, 157). We might point to other examples of expert behavior that\nare more mundane \u2013 like driblling a basketball, or doing the\nsteps of a dance \u2013 where we do well when we proceed\nunthinkingly, but where get tripped up if we bring our behavior to the\nlevel of conscious attention. Anticipating Cudworth, and anticipating\nmuch-later philosophers who posit the existence of embodied\ncognition, Cavendish writes:\n\n[M]ost spend their time in talk rather then in thought; but there is a\nwise saying, think first, and speak after; and an old saying that many\nspeak first, and think after; and doubtlesse many, if not most do so,\nfor we do not alwayes think of our words we speak, for most commonly\nwords flow out of the mouth, rather customarily then premeditately,\njust like actions of our walking, for we go by custome, force and\nstrength, without a constant notice or observation; for though we\ndesigne our wayes, yet we do not ordinarily think of our pace, nor\ntake notice of every several step; just so, most commonly we talk, for\nwe seldom think of our words we speak, nor many times the sense they\ntend to; unlesse it be some affected person that would speak in fine\nphrases \u2026 . (Cavendish 1655, Epistle, unnumbered)\n\n\nSome of us might squirm at using an expression like \u201cmuscle\nmemory\u201d \u2013 if we think that (material) muscles cannot\nexhibit mental states. But for Cavendish phenomena like muscle memory\nare to be expected if bodies are mindful across the board.\n\nShe would add for good measure that although human beings do engage in\nconscious and reflective thinking, most of our thinking is not of that\nsort. A human being is composed of a very large number of bodies, and\nmost of these are involved in such orderly functions as the beating of\nthe heart, digestion, the absorption of nutrients, the disposal of\nwaste, reproduction, and the significant amount of communication that\ntakes place between cells. That is a lot of mentality, and arguably it\nis much more than the mentality that is constituted by episodes of\nconscious reflection. Cavendish even offers a clever argument to the\neffect that episodes of conscious mentality of a human being\npresuppose a torrential amount of unconscious cognitive labor that is\ntaking place behind the scenes.\n\nThe example of a conversation is especially telling, Cavendish\nsupposes \u2013 \u201cfor most commonly words flow out of the mouth,\nrather customarily then premeditately.\u201d In the course of a\nconversation a string of thoughts often just comes\nto us, and then we utter them. A similar example is that in which\nwe come to have a witty or clever idea in response to a situation that\nwe inhabit. It\u2019s not that we have the conscious idea already, among\nmany other conscious thoughts that are in our mind, and then we choose\nto express the one that has a high-relevance flag attached to it; the\nthought just presents itself. Or if we have many thoughts and one has\nattached to it the high-relevance flag, something attached that flag,\nand that is cognitive work. Or we might consider the case of the\nlate-night talk-show host who thinks of exactly the right thing at\nexactly the right time, though it is one of perhaps a hundred million\npossible thoughts in their wheelhouse. But they think of \u2013 and\nutter \u2013 just the one. Cavendish shines a light on the phenomenon\nby positing the existence of unconscious cognitive workers in the\nbrain that wisely select our thoughts and put them before our\nconscious mind. She writes (\u201cOf small Creatures, such as we call\nFairies,\u201d in Cavendish 1653a, 162):\n\n\nWho knows, but in the Braine may dwel\n\nLittle small Fairies, who can tell?\n\nAnd by their several actions they may make\n\nThose formes and figures, we for fancy\ntake.\n\nAnd when we sleep, those Visions, dreames we call\n\nBy their industry may be raised all;\n\nAnd all the objects, which through sens\u2019es get\n\nWithin the Braine they may in order set.\n\n\nCavendish does not suppose that there are actual winged fairies flying\naround in our brain. What she does suppose is that there must be a\ncause that puts before our mind the intelligent thoughts that we come\nto have \u2013 in the coherent and intelligent order in which we come\nto have them. Otherwise we would not have those thoughts, or we would\ncome to have them in an order that is jumbled and random. In the\ncourse of a conversation, and in the course of any train of thought,\nthere is something of which we are not aware that \u201cin order\nset[s]\u201d our ideas. This something is cognitive and perceptive\nand discriminating by nature. If a comedian or philosopher or witty\nperson is identified as intelligent for articulating a clever idea,\nthe process by which the idea comes to them is properly identified as\nintelligent \u2013 if not more so. But by hypothesis we are not\nconscious of that background process; we are just conscious of the\nthoughts themselves. The background process is quite intelligent,\nhowever; and we would be lost without it. Indeed, a fun exercise in\nwhich a person might engage is to notice when a funny quip comes to\nthem out of the blue, and ask how it arose. Cavendish would say that\nit\u2019s fairies, which are the intelligent (and hence mindful)\nentities that \u201cin order set\u201d our ideas. These engage in a\ntremendous amount of mental activity, and for every bit of conscious\nreflective activity that we count, there is at least one bit of\nunconscious mental activity (if not more) that makes it possible. And\nthen there is digestion, the absorption of nutrients, the disposal of\nwaste, reproduction, the significant amount of communication that\ntakes place between cells, etc. Just a fraction of the thinking that\ntakes place in a human body is of the conscious and reflective\nvariety, according to Cavendish, even if we think that kind of\nthinking is special and that it is the only kind of thinking that we\ndo. But conscious thinking is an outlier, and if so, at most a\nfraction of the thinking that takes place in nature is of the sort\nwith which we identify. The parts of a human body exhibit mentality\n\u2013 \u201cone part of a mans body, as one hand, is not less\nsensible, then the other, nor the heel less sensible then the heart,\nnor the legg less sensible then the head, but each part hath its sense\nand reason, and so consequently its sensitive and rational\nknowledge\u2026.\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 113\u201314). If a human\nhand or heel is composed of the same elemtental bodies that compose\nthe rest of the bodies in nature, then unconscious embodied mentality\nabounds.\n\nAnother philosophical tenet that bears on Cavendish\u2019s view on the\nubiquity of thinking is her view that nature is a plenum. If there\nwere empty space between bodies, then there would be no thinking that\ntakes place between bodies, but Cavendish holds that the notion of\nempty space is a fiction. In the regions that we call \u201cempty\nspace,\u201d there is air, for example, and in addition there are\nother bodies that are below the threshold of human perception. She\noffers a number of reasons for supposing that the universe is a\nplenum, including that nothingness can have no properties and that God\nwould not create non-being. She writes,\n\nan incorporeal dimension or extension, seems, in my opinion, a meer\ncontradiction; for I cannot conceive how nothing can have a dimension\nor extension, having nothing to be extended or measured. (Cavendish\n1664, 451\u2013452)\n\n\nmy sense and reason cannot believe a Vacuum, because there\ncannot be an empty Nothing; but change of motion makes all the\nalteration of figures, and consequently all that which is called\nplace, magnitude, space, and the like; for matter, motion, figure,\nplace, magnitude, &c. are but one thing. But some men perceiving\nthe alteration, but not the subtil motions, believe that bodies move\ninto each others place\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 521)\n\n\nGod being not a Creator of Nothing, nor an annihilator of Nothing, but\nof Something, he cannot be a creator of Vacuum; for Vacuum is a pure\nNothing. (Cavendish 1664, 453\u2013454)\n\n\nCavendish will have to be careful about putting any weight on this\nlast argument, if she also holds that we have no idea of God and no\nideas of any immaterials more generally, but she does make sure to\noffer the additional argument that contains no theological premises.\nNon-being is nothing, she supposes, and in addition nothingness cannot\nhave any properties. The universe is a plenum of contiguous bodies,\nand these bodies are also perceptive and are in regular communication\nwith the bodies in their local environment. Cavendish is a panpsychist\nin the sense that she holds that all creatures exhibit mentality, and\nshe holds that there is no space that is not inhabited by a creature.\nAll creatures think, and there is no region of the universe that does\nnot exhibit mentality.[26]\n\nCavendish does make a distinction between three kinds of matter\n\u2013 rational, sensitive, and inanimate \u2013 and so it might\nseem that she allows that some creatures, for example inanimate\nbodies, do not exhibit mentality. She writes,\n\nThe truth is, nature considered as she is, and as much as our sense\nand reason can perceive by her various effects, must of necessity be\ncomposed, or consist of a commixture of animate, both rational and\nsensitive, and inanimate matter: for, were there no inanimate matter,\nthere would be no ground, or grosser substance to work on, and so no\nsolid \ufb01gures: and, were there no animate sensitive matter,\nthere would be no \u2018\u2018labourer,\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018workman,\u2019\u2019 as I may call it, to form the\ninanimate part of matter into various \ufb01gures; such\nin\ufb01nite changes, compositions, divisions, productions,\ndissolutions, etc. (Cavendish 1668a, 157\u201358)\n\n\nThe basic idea here is that if all matter were rational\nmatter \u2013 of the sort that composes our ideas \u2013 then\nmacroscopic bodies would assemble (and also decompose) just as quickly\nas our ideas of those bodies, but they do not. In imagination we can\nquickly form an idea of a house or mountain or dragon, and then\nrecombine the components of that idea into an idea of something very\ndifferent, but in nature things are more slow. They are also more\nsteady. The three kinds of matter are more precisely \u201cdegrees of\nmatter\u201d (Cavendish 1668b,\n 4\u20135).[27]\n Cavendish supposes that all three are so intimately blended that\nthere is no region of matter that does not exhibit at least some\nmentality and perception (O\u2019Neill 2001, xxiii\u2013xxvi).\n\nPerhaps a final question that arises in the context of a discussion of\nCavendish and panpsychism is about artificial intelligence. Cavendish\nwould agree that a creature would never exhibit thinking if the\nelemental bodies of nature did not have features like thought and\nperception. In that circumstance, there is absolutely no chance, and\nno risk, that a computer would ever think, no matter its program, and\na robot would never think, no matter how complicated the arrangement\nof its parts. But Cavendish holds that the elemental bodies of nature\ndo exhibit thought and perception. There is no chance that a machine\nwould think just in virtue of the size and shape of the bodies that\ncompose it, but an artist or technologist might still create a\nthinking machine \u2013 not in virtue of its code or its wiring,\nbut in virtue of the mentality of the bodies that are blended with\nthem. As we will see, Cavendish has numerous reservations about human\nartifice. A twenty-first-century application of her view is to note\nthat (non-panpsychist) artists and\ntechnologists are being naive and reckless in\nany attempt to create a powerful and efficient machine\nthat merely simulates thinking; they lack a\nproper appreciation of what it is that is thereby combined.\n5. Occasional Causation\n\nAn interesting wrinkle in Cavendish\u2019s view of the orderly behavior of\nbodies is her insistence that when bodies interact they do not\ntransfer motion to each\n other.[28]\n Instead, bodies communicate with each other about how to coordinate\ntheir behavior, and each is then the source of its own motion. On the\nassumption that properties cannot literally slide or hop from one body\nto another, cases in which one body does take on the motion of another\nbody would be cases in which the second body also takes on the matter\nthat has that motion. But we do not observe a body to become more\nmassive when it is moved as a result of its contact with another body.\nAs Cavendish explains in her description of a hand that moves a\nbowl,\n\nI cannot think it probable, that any of the animate or self-moving\nmatter in the hand, quits the hand, and enters into the bowl; nor that\nthe animate matter, which is in the bowl, leaves the bowl and enters\ninto the hand. (Cavendish 1664, 445)\n\n\nCavendish adds that \u201cif it did, the hand would in a short time\nbecome weak and useless, by losing so much\n substance\u2026.\u201d[29]\n She instead proposes that when one body appears to move another, it\nis simply an occasion or prompt for the second body to move on its\nown. The second body moves in the right way in response to the first\nbody (and the other bodies in its vicinity), but only because all\nbodies are intelligent and perceptive and (for the most part)\nagreeable, and they communicate with each other about how to\n proceed.[30]\n A body B might appear to acquire new motion from a body A if body B\nat first was still, or a body B might appear to be stationary after a\nbody A \u201cstops\u201d it from moving, but Cavendish supposes that\nbodies that appear to be stationary are always quite active below the\nsurface:\n\nthough a particular motion doth not move in that same manner as it did\nbefore, nevertheless it is still there, and not onely there, but still\nmoving; onely it is not moving after the same manner as it did move\nheretofore, but has changed from such a kind of motion to another kind\nof motion, and being still moving it cannot be said to cease:\nWherefore what is commonly called cessation from motion, is onely a\nchange of some particular motion, and is a mistake of change for rest.\n(Cavendish 1664, 436)\n\n\nA given amount of motion is inseparably tied to the body that has it,\naccording to Cavendish, and so motion never transfers from a first\nbody to a second \u2013 unless of course the first body loses some of\nits matter, in which case there is a transfer of motion, but only\nbecause there is at the same time a transfer of matter. The motion\nthat is transferred is not transferred from the matter that has it;\ninstead, that matter and motion both transfer together. Cavendish\nsupposes that motion is never transferred on its own, but she also\nallows that a body can redirect motions that another body already has.\nThat is, a body never transfers any amount of motion to a second body,\nbut a body can (and often does) redirect the motions of a second body.\nBodies indeed often dominate other bodies and force their motions to\nrun counter to what they would otherwise be:\n\n\u2026Nature\u2019s Parts move themselves, and are not moved by any Agent.\nSecondly, Though Nature\u2019s Parts are Self-moving, and Self-knowing, yet\nthey have not an infinite or uncontroulable Power; for, several Parts,\nand Parties, oppose, and oft-times obstruct each other; so that many\ntimes they are forced to move, and they may not when they would.\n(Cavendish 1668b, 105)\n\n\nthere is no particular creature, that hath an absolute power of\nself-moving; so that Creature which hath the advantage of strength,\nsubtilty, or policy, shape, or figure, and the like, may oppose and\nover-power another which is inferior to it, in all this; yet this\nhinderance and opposition doth not take away self-motion. (Cavendish\n1664, 96)\n\n\nA body never loses its motion, and motion is never transferred on its\nown from one body to another, but a body can redirect the motions that\na second body already has, and in a way that might give the appearance\nthat motion has been transferred. Cavendish will allow appearances to\ntell part of the story of a given body-body interaction, but she also\nmakes sure that any such story is informed by deeper metaphysical\nconsiderations like that strictly speaking a body and its motion are\ninseparable.\n\nA given body never loses or acquires motion, according to Cavendish.\nInstead, the motion of a body is always its own self-motion. If so, we\ncan draw a conclusion about the motions that occur in a sense organ\nwhen an object is perceived. The motions are self-motions. They are\nnot motions that are transfered from the object that is perceived;\nsuch a transfer is unintelligible. New motions are not transfered from\nthe object that is perceived (unless the sense organ gets bigger); nor\nare they impressed upon the sense organ by bodies that travel through\nthe air and stamp themselves on the\n organ.[31]\n Instead, the motions in the sense organ are self-motions. The sense\norgan patterns an image of the perceived body, and it does so via\nmotions that it possessed all along:\n\nBy prints I understand the figures of the objects which are patterned\nor copied out by the sensitive and rational corporeal figurative\nmotions; as for example, when the sensitive corporeal motions pattern\nout the figure of an exterior object, and the rational motions again\npattern out a figure made by the sensitive motions, those figures of\nthe objects that are patterned out, I name prints \u2026 Thus by\nprints I understand patterns, and by printing patterning. \u2026 [It\nis] not that the exterior object prints its figure upon the exterior\nsensitive organs, but that the sensitive motions in the organs pattern\nout the figure of the\n object.[32]\n\n\nFor Cavendish, both of the causal participants of a sensory perception\nare active, which is to say that the sense organ \u2013 usually\nregarded as passive \u2013 is\n active.[33]\n The body that is perceived is also a cause; it is what Cavendish\ncalls an occasional cause: \u201cI say that some things may be\nOccasional causes of other things, but not the Prime or Principal\ncauses\u2026\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 79). Commentators have worried\nthat even if we allow Cavendish the view that bodies are active and\nvital and the source of their own motion, she has no way to account\nfor how it is that bodies communicate so successfully with each other\nif nothing is transmitted between them. Bodies seem to\n\u201csuggest\u201d (Detlefsen 2007, 168), or \u201cinduc[e]\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill 2001, xxx), or perhaps they transmit \u201ca sort of signal\nthat triggers the self-motion\u201d of the body that moves\n(Michaelian 2009, 47), but the question is how they do this. As\nDetlefsen writes,\n\nAlthough it is true that there is no transfer of motion between bodies\nin cases of interaction by occasional causation, there is still some\nsort of causal interaction [when the first body induces the second\nbody to act]\u2026. How is this possible if nothing is physically\ntransferred? (Detlefsen 2007, 168)\n\n\nO\u2019Neill points the way to an answer. First, she points out that even\nthough (for Cavendish) a body never transfers its motion to a second\nbody, it still serves as a partial cause of its movement (O\u2019Neill\n2001, xxx\u2013xxxi). Cavendish says,\n\nI do not say, that the motion of the hand does not contribute to the\nmotion of the ball; for though the ball has its own natural motion in\nitself \u2026 nevertheless the motion of the ball would not move by\nsuch an exterior local motion, did not the motion of the hand, or any\nother exterior moving body give it occasion to move that way;\nwherefore the motion of the hand may very well be said to be the cause\nof that exterior local motion of the ball, but not to be the same\nmotion by which the ball moves. (Cavendish 1664, 447\u20138)\n\n\nIt is clear how an occasional cause contributes to the motion of a\nsecond body in a case where the occasional cause \u201coppose[s] and\nover-power[s] another which is inferior to it.\u201d The occasional\ncause \u201chinder[s]\u201d the second body and\n\u201cforce[s]\u201d it to move in ways that it otherwise would not.\nThe second body still moves by its own self-motion, for \u201cthis\nhinderance and opposition doth not take away self-motion.\u201d\nMotion is never transfered from one body to another, and so the motion\nof a body \u2013 and even the motion of a body that is over-powered\n\u2013 is motion that the body has possessed all along. But the\noccasional cause still redirects the self-motion of the\nsecond body; it re-directs the self-motion of the second body, which\nis to say that it re-directs the motions that the second body already\nhad. Note that Cavendish uses the language of \u201coccasional causes\u201d (for\nexample at Cavendish 1664, 79), but her understanding of occasional\ncausation is not the same as that of 17th-Century contemporaries like\nMalebranche and Boyle. For Cavendish an occasional cause is something\nthat triggers or occasions motion that is already in (and is\ninseparable from) the affected body.\n\nCavendish then makes sense of cases that are more mundane. She\nconsiders for example of our sensory perception of distant objects\nlike the sun. As we would expect, she holds that there is an\noccasional cause that plays an active role with respect to the\nprompting of motion that is already in the eye, and she holds that the\neye plays an active role as well. She writes,\n\nNeither is the influence of the Stars performed beyond a certain\ndistance, that is, such a distance as is beyond sight or their natural\npower to work; for if their light comes to our Eyes, I know no reason\nagainst it, but their effects may come to our bodies. (Cavendish 1664,\n301\u2013302)\n\n\nWe perceive a distant body because light travels from that body to our\nsense organ and does something to the sense organ. The light does not\nadd new motion to the sense organ; that is absurd. Instead, the light\nre-directs the bodies of the sense organ to form a pattern of the\ndistant body. In the very next sentence Cavendish offers the same\naccount of the causal process by which a creature acquires a disease:\nshe says that \u201cas for infectious Diseases, they come by\ncorporeal imitation, as by touch, either of the infected air, drawn in\nby breath, or entring through the Pores of the Body, or of some things\nbrought from infected places\u2026\u201d (ibid.). For Cavendish,\noccasional causation occurs by contact when a body re-directs the\nself-motion of a second body. Bodies interact with other bodies by\ncontact, when they hinder each other and they re-direct (but never\ntransfer) motion. In the case of perception, the self-motions of the\nsense organ pattern an image of the distant body upon the arrival of\nlight (or some other medium). As we would expect, Cavendish does not\nhold that light travels all the way from the distant body; instead,\nthat light is patterned by air or light that is in the plenum of\nmatter that lies in-between object and perceiver, and in the end the\nsense organ patterns that air or light. She says that \u201cas for\nair, it patterns out the light of the Sun, and the sensitive motions\nin the eyes of animals pattern out the light in the air\u201d\n(Cavendish 1664, 83). She owns as a consequence that in the plenum\nthat is the material universe there is a lot of patterning that takes\nplace that we do not notice; there are objects that we and other\ncreatures pattern but that are below the threshold of awareness\n(Cavendish 1668a, 211). The same bit of light does not travel all the\nway from object to perceiver; nor does light pass through walls.\nInstead, patterning abounds, along the lines of Newton\u2019s Cradle.\n6. God\n\nWe have seen that Cavendish holds that natural reason cannot perceive\nor have an idea of an immaterial being. She says in particular that\n\u201cas for Immaterial, no mind can conceive that\u201d (Cavendish\n1664, 69) and that \u201cwhen we name God, we name an Unexpressible,\nand Incomprehensible Being\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 315). One way to\nreconcile her view that we cannot have ideas of immaterials with her\nnumerous attempts to speak of God is to say that she is attempting to\nspeak in the language of her opponents. A problem, however, is that\nthere are passages in which she appears to be doing a lot more.\nFor example, she writes that,\n\n\nI Sent you word in my last, I would not meddle with writing any thing\nof the Divine Soul of Man, by reason it belongs to Faith and Religion,\nand not to Natural Philosophy; but since you desire my opinion\nconcerning the Immortality of the Divine Soul, I cannot but answer you\nplainly, that first I did wonder much you made me question of that,\nwhose truth, in my opinion, is so clear, as hardly any rational man\nwill make a doubt of it; for I think there is almost no Christian in\nthe world, but believes the Immortality of the Soul, no not Christians\nonely, but Mahometans and Jews: But I left to wonder at you, when I\nsaw Wise and Learned Men, and great Divines, take so much pains as to\nwrite whole Volumes, and bring so many arguments to prove the\nImmortality of the Soul, for this was a greater Miracle to me, then if\nNature had shewed me some of her secret and hidden effects, or if I\nhad seen an Immaterial Spirit. Certainly, Madam, it seems as\nstrange to me to prove the Immortality of the Soul, as to convert\nAtheists; for it is impossible, almost, that any Atheist should be\nfound in the World: For what Man would be so senceless as to deny a\nGod? Wherefore to prove either a God, or the Immortality of the Soul,\nis to make a man doubt of either: for as Physicians and Surgeons apply\nstrengthening Medicines onely to those parts of the body which they\nsuppose the weakest, so it is with proofs and arguments, those being\nfor the most part used in such subjects, the truth of which is most\nquestionable. (Cavendish 1664, 220)\n\n\nHere Cavendish is stating quite straightforwardly that we can have\nfaith in the existence of immaterials, and in particular in the\nexistence of God, but that immaterials are not within the province of\nnatural reason. If so, Cavendish is reflecting the view that our best\nand only interface with God is via faith; she is reflecting her\ncommitment to fideism.\n\nA problem, of course, is that it would seem that a person would need\nto have an idea of God in order to have faith that God exists.\nCavendish is clear that we can have an idea of the effects of\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, but she does not think that natural reason can have\nan idea of an immaterial itself. We can have an idea that there is a\ncause of these effects, but not an idea of what the cause is, or what\nit is that makes that idea and idea of God as opposed to something\nelse. Cavendish might posit that we have supernatural and immaterial\nsouls and that these can have an idea of God, but the question again\nis how she would be entitled to make suppositions about immaterial\nsouls. One of her aims in circumscribing the limits of natural\nphilosophy is presumably to make room for faith, but there is a worry\nthat she has gone too far in holding that we cannot have ideas of\nimmaterials. As Descartes remarks,\n\n\u2026[I]f someone says of himself that he does not have any idea of\nGod,\u2026 he is making the most impious confession he could make.\nHe is saying that he does not know God by natural reason, but also\nthat neither faith nor any other means could give him any knowledge of\nGod. For if one has no idea, i.e. no perception which corresponds to\nthe meaning of the word \u2018God\u2019, it is no use saying that\none believes that God exists. One might as well say that one\nbelieves that nothing exists, thus remaining in the abyss of impiety\nand the depths of ignorance. (Descartes 1641, 273)\n\n\nGod is not to be conceived or understood, according to Cavendish, but\n\u201cis rather to be admired, adored and worshipped.\u201d We do\nnot have any idea of Him, however, and so it is difficult to make\nsense of how our intentional states could ever point specifically in\nHis direction.\n\nCavendish appears to be committed to the view that the only things of\nwhich we can think or speak are material things that we can detect. In\nsome passages, she refers to God and His infinitude in order highlight\nthat God is beyond us and to highlight the limits of human\nunderstanding. In such passages, Cavendish might be speaking of God in\nways that are in tension with her view that we do not have ideas of\nimmaterials. An alternate explanation is that she might instead be\nattempting to rein in the ambitions of natural reason. She writes,\n\nShall or can we bind up Gods actions with our weak opinions and\nfoolish arguments? Truly, if God could not act more then [sic] Man is\nable to conceive, he were not a God of an infinite Power; but God is\nOmnipotent, and his actions are infinite, supernatural, and past\nfinding out; wherefore he is rather to be admired, adored and\nworshipped, then to be ungloriously discoursed of by vain and\nambitious men, whose foolish pride and presumption drowns their\nNatural Judgment and Reason\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 527)\n\n\nCavendish is clear in this passage that if a finite mind is able to\nsubsume a being under its necessarily limited ideas and categories,\nthen whatever that being is, it is not God. Our attempts to\ninvestigate the ways and nature of God are hopeless, and accordingly,\nwe should restrict our faculties to a subject matter to which they are\nappropriately\n fitted.[34]\n Even then, we should still be appropriately humble and fallibilistic.\nCavendish\u2019s criticism of the scientist William Harvey is a case in\npoint:\n\nhe doth speak so presumptuously of Gods Actions, Designs, Decrees,\nLaws, Attributes, Power, and secret Counsels, and describes the\nmanner, how God created all things, and the mixture of the Elements to\nan hair, as if he had been Gods Counsellor and Assistant in the work\nof Creation; which whether it be not more impiety, then to say Matter\nis Infinite, I\u2019le let others judg [sic]. Neither do I think this\nexpression to be against the holy Scripture; for though I speak as a\nnatural Philosopher, and am unwilling to cite the Scripture, which\nonely treats of things belonging to Faith, and not to Reason; yet I\nthink there is not any passage which plainly denies Matter to be\ninfinite, and Eternal, unless it be drawn by force to that\nsense\u2026. [A]lso the Scripture says, That Gods ways are\nunsearchable, and past finding out. (Cavendish 1664, 462)\n\n\nHere Cavendish is also referencing her view that matter is eternal,\nwhich she thinks is an obvious consequence of the datum that it is\n\u201cimpossible, to wit, that something should be made or produced\nout of nothing\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 53). Not wanting to ground her\nmetaphysics in ideas of God that we do not have, she does not want to\nventure that God created matter out of nothing, and the only remaining\noption if something cannot come from nothing is to suppose that it is\neternal. She wants to emphasize however that it is not heretical to\nsay that the matter out of which the earth and heavens are created has\nno beginning of existence itself, and so in the passage immediately\nabove she highlights that there are no passages in scripture that deny\nthat. Cavendish is not the most humble philosopher, but she is careful\nto exercise restraint when it comes to matters that our beyond our\nken. She is assuming that there is a difference between the domains\nthat our minds are capable of investigating and the domains that piety\nsuggests are not accessible to us. Infallibilism with respect to\neither domain is inappropriate, but it is especially so with respect\nto the\n second.[35]\n\nIn some passages Cavendish speaks of God to say that He is\ninconceivable and inexpressible. In other passages she speaks of God\nto say that our knowledge of His existence has to be via faith and not\nnatural reason. In other passages she speaks of God to highlight the\nways in which a finite mind should not expect to understand matters\nthat are beyond it. In other passages she speaks of God to offer\npositive evidence for her view that everything in nature is material.\nFor example, she says that it follows from the premise that God is\ngood and just that He would make sure that all of His creatures would\nbe able to worship Him, and so would make sure that all of His\ncreatures had knowledge and perception (Cavendish 1664, 518\u20139).\nShe also speaks of God\u2019s creation of everything, including the\nintellectual and perceptual capacities of matter, as a way of making\nsense of the teleology that we find (and that given the features of\nthe creator we would expect to find) in\n nature.[36] If\n God creates everything, however, and matter is eternal, and then God\nand matter would appear to be co-eternal.\n\nFor all of its apparent problems, one of the reasons that it is\nimportant to remark upon Cavendish\u2019s view on our inability to conceive\nof God is to highlight that even though she thinks that the organized\nbehavior of bodies is due to intelligence, she does not subscribe to\nany version of a theory of intelligent design. There is a difference\nbetween the thesis that the orderly behavior of bodies is due to the\nintelligence and perceptual capacities of the bodies themselves and\nthe thesis that it is due to the intelligence of a designer. Cavendish\nmight add that either thesis has to posit the existence of intelligent\nand perceptive matter. If God had created matter that was not equipped\nwith the resources to detect the matter around it and act in ways that\nare coordinated, chaos would ensue almost immediately. Cavendish\nis forced to admit that if matter is intelligent and\nperceptive, there is no further explanation as to why it is\nintelligent and perceptive, or at least not one that can be known by\nnatural reason. Intelligence and perceptive matter just is. It is\nsomething that has always existed (Cavendish 1664, 14, 462) and it has\nthe resources within itself to bring about all the things that we\nobserve it to bring about on a daily basis. She would side with Hume\non the question of whether or not it is more likely that the only\nbeings that exist with such resources are immaterial:\n\n\u2026when it is asked, what cause produces order in the ideas of\nthe supreme Being, can any other reason be assigned by you,\nanthropomorphites, than that it is a rational faculty, and\nthat such is the nature of the Deity? But why a similar\nanswer will not be equally satisfactory in accounting for the order of\nthe world, without having recourse to any such intelligent Creator as\nyou insist on, may be difficult to determine. It is only to say, that\nsuch is the nature of material objects, and that they are all\noriginally possessed of a faculty of order and proportion.\n(Hume 1779, dialogue 4, p. 65)\n\n\nFor Cavendish, matter has a tremendous number of resources built into\nit. If it is eternal, then we can offer no account of its origin, but\nin this respect the competing thesis that God is the source of the\norder in the universe is on a par. The latter thesis has additional\nproblems, however: if God is wholly immaterial, then it is not clear\nhow He could produce matter, or how He would be able to interact with\nit once it was made (Cavendish 1668a, 199\u2013200; Cavendish 1668b,\n241; Detlefsen 2009, 430); and if God\u2019s supremacy is inversely\nproportional to our finite ability to conceive of Him, it is difficult\nto see how our confidence about His nature and operations could be\nanything more than arrogance. Cavendish thinks that the view that\nmatter has always existed and is the source of its own order is not\nonly a contender, but is really the only option.\n7. Social and Political Philosophy\n\nAn issue of interpretation that arises in the attempt to reconstruct\nCavendish\u2019s social and political philosophy is that for the most part\nthe texts in which she addresses social and political questions are\nnot formal philosophical treatises but works of fiction. What is\nregarded as her central work on political philosophy, Description\nof a New World, Called the Blazing World, is a novel, and in\nanother central text, Orations of Divers Sorts, Cavendish\npresents a multiplicity of opposing perspectives on social and\npolitical topics: gender roles, virtue, war, and the proper form of\ngovernment, among others. Cavendish is indeed the author of\nBlazing World, and she also makes an appearance as a\ncharacter, but it is difficult to be certain that all of the\nconclusions and insights of the narrator are ones that Cavendish would\nidentify as her own. The interpretive problem is even worse in the\ncase of Orations, as there are as many as three or four\nspeeches that are offered on any given subject, and the speeches are\nin some cases contradictory. Still, there are a few texts in which\nCavendish puts forward claims about social and political matters and\nin which she is clearly speaking in her own voice \u2014 in\nparticular, World\u2019s Olio. We can use these claims to\ndetermine which of the perspectives she is endorsing in her more\nfictional work and to get a concrete sense of how she might follow up\non these (Boyle 2006, 253\u2013254).\n\nCavendish disagrees with Hobbes on a number of questions of natural\nphilosophy. For Hobbes, thoughts and sensations are motions in the\nbrain (Hobbes 1651, 27\u201328). For Cavendish thinking and\nintelligence are basic features of bodies \u2013 they are basic\nfeatures that are ubiquitous in nature and that admit of no further\nexplanation. Nor would Hobbes agree with Cavendish that when bodies\ninteract their rational elements communicate with each other and\nco-ordinate their behavior. But on questions of social and political\nphilosophy Cavendish and Hobbes to a significant degree align. Like\nHobbes, Cavendish holds that human beings are primarily motivated by\nself-interest:\n\nSelf-love is the ground from which springs all Indeavours and\nIndustry, Noble Qualities, Honourable Actions, Friendships, Charity,\nand Piety, and is the cause of all Passions, Affections, Vices and\nVirtues; for we do nothing, or think not of any thing, but hath a\nreference to our selves in one kind or other. (Cavendish 1655, 145)\n\n\nShe adds that self-love is \u201cthe strongest Motion of the\nMind\u201d (Ibid.). Also like Hobbes, Cavendish thinks that life\noutside of civil society is so dangerous and chaotic that it does not\nallow us to pursue our self-interest in a stable and consistent way.\nOutside of civil society, we cannot secure food or shelter without\nthreat that they will be taken; we do not have, and we cannot create\nand sustain, the infrastructure that enables commerce; we cannot make\nplans; and the bulk of our energy is expended on security and safety\nin the moment. Orations offers multiple perspectives on\nsocial and political issues, but the emphasis on social stability is a\nconstant (Boyle 2006, 258 and 282\u2013286):\n\nIf [there is] no safety [there is] no propriety, either of goods,\nwives, children nor lives, and if there be no propriety there will be\nno husbandry and the lands will lie unmanured; also there will be\nneither trade nor traffic, all which will cause famine, war, and ruin,\nand such a confusion as the kingdom will be like a chaos. (Cavendish\n1662a, 70)\n\n\nAs for Hobbes, for Cavendish the stability of civil society is not an\nend in itself; it is instead a necessary condition for us to pursue\nour self-interested projects and goals. If we remained in a state of\nnature, we would be in perpetual fear. We would not be likely to live\nvery long, and we would not live well. We would not be healthy. We\nwould not be able develop our latent skills and abilities, and we\nwould not be able to engage in the activities of which those skills\nand abilities are an expression.\n\nCavendish also agrees with Hobbes that civil society is most stable\nand secure when it is ruled by a single individual who has absolute\npower and sovereignty (Lewis 2001, 345; Boyle 2006, 282). She\nwrites,\n\nThis Commonwealth to be governed by one Head or Governour, as a King,\nfor one Head is sufficient for one Body: for several Heads breed\nseveral Opinions, and several Opinions breed Disputations, and\nDisputations Factions, and Factions breed Wars, and Wars bring ruin\nand Desolation; for it is more safe to be governed, though by a\nFoolish Head, than a Factious Heart. (Cavendish 1655, 205\u2013206)\n\n\nIf a sovereign is to have absolute power, there is some risk of course\nthat they might use that power unwisely and in a way that does not\noptimally promote peace and stability. Cavendish is more worried\nhowever about all of the alternatives. For example, democracy is not a\nsustainable option:\n\nthe common people is not only Insolent, when they have Power,\nCommanding Imperiously, Condemning Unjustly, Advancing Unworthily, but\nthey are so Inconstant, as there is no Assurance in them, and so\nFoolish, as they Know not what to Choose. (Cavendish 1662a, 278)\n\n\nIf the security and order of civil society is left in the hands of the\nmajority, or in the hands of a person who is selected by the majority,\nthere is too high a risk that society will return to chaos. Cavendish\nalso holds that power should not be in the hands of a smaller but very\ntalented and intelligent and sophisticated minority: she appears to\nthink that the likelihood is high that such a body will become divided\nand govern ineffectively, perhaps because \u201cIt is the nature of\nmost of Mankind \u2026 to be Ungratefull, Malicious, Revengefull,\nand Inhumane\u201d (Cavendish 1662a, 259). The members of such a body\nmight be in perpetual conflict as a result of honest disagreement or\nas a result of their ambition to have more power for themselves.\nCavendish concludes that the best prospect for security and stability\n\u2014 though to be sure this is not a guarantee \u2014 is to\nhave all power in the hands of a single\n individual.[37]\n\nCavendish does not get into a lot of detail about how the sovereign\nshould best bring about peace and security, but she does offer a\nnumber of suggestions. In Blazing World, she depicts a scene\nin which the Empress returns to her home world (from the Blazing\nWorld) and saves her people from an enemy attack. The Empress is\ndepicted as possessing super-human abilities, as having the\nall-encompassing breadth and reach and power of a god:\n\nWhich sight, when her countrymen perceived at a distance, their hearts\nbegan to tremble; but coming something nearer, she left her torches,\nand appeared only in her garments of light, like an angel, or some\ndeity, and all kneeled down before her, and worshipped her with all\nsubmission and reverence: but the Empress would not come nearer than\nat such a distance where her voice might be generally heard, by reason\nshe would not have that of her accoutrements anything else should be\nperceived, but the splendour thereof. \u2026 But, good Lord! what\nseveral opinions and judgments did this produce in the minds of her\ncountry-men; some said she was an angel; others, she was a sorceress;\nsome believed her a goddess; others said the devil deluded them in the\nshape of a fine lady. (96)\n\n\nWhile still on Blazing World, the Empress had received intelligence\nthat her people were under attack and that their kingdom was likely to\nbe destroyed (90). The clear suggestion is that peace and security are\nbest secured and maintained if a country is governed by a sovereign\nwho is and is believed to be capable of the extraordinary. The\nsovereign should not be selected by democracy, and ideally the\nsovereign will be one of the few who is naturally born with the\ntalents that are requisite to do the job:\n\nLet me Advise you to Choose one that is Born a King, and Bred a King,\nwho will Rule and Govern Magnificently, Majestically, Heroically, as a\nKing ought to Do. (Cavendish 1662b, 283)\n\n\nIt is difficult to resist the thought that Cavendish is writing in\npart with an eye to Hobbes and the problem of the fool (Hobbes 1651,\n90). To the subject who thinks that it is rational to break the\ncovenants of civil society, and who thinks that he can get away with\nit, Cavendish is suggesting that a capable sovereign would make sure\nthat subjects have reason to believe that the eyes and ears of the\nsovereign are ubiquitous and that situations in which a subject\nconcludes that he is under the radar are likely to be situations\nthat the sovereign has had skillfully and majestically staged. Perhaps\nCavendish is also suggesting that there is no good Hobbesian response\nto the problem of the fool in that she is fleshing out what a\nsovereign would have to be to make the behavior of the\n\u201cfool\u201d count as irrational, and how a sovereign cannot\nrealistically be anything close to that.\n\nCavendish also does not speak in a lot of detail about how a sovereign\nis established or about the formation of a commonwealth. She appears\nto assume that a sovereign will emerge from the among the most\npowerful and talented and that the majority of people will come to see\nsubjugation as in their overall interest. She does however sketch some\nparameters that she thinks a wise sovereign will keep in mind, and\nthese parameters tend to be in keeping with her occasionalist view\nthat things or persons have power not as a function of what they force\nonto their objects but as a function of whether or not these objects\nrespond to the person or thing as requested. For example, Cavendish\nsays that a wise sovereign will be fair and consistent in the\napplication and enforcement of laws (Cavendish 1655, 112). The\nsovereign will also be a model of virtue, and in a way that allows his\nor her subjects to register that the highest forms of happiness and\npleasure do not in fact accompany the life of vice. (Cavendish 1664b,\n114) A wise sovereign will also make sure that subjects have access to\nletters and to education more generally \u2014 to poetry that softens\nour animalistic and reactive side (Cavendish 1655, 64); to plays and\nother representations that not only articulate and defend but also\nexhibit the virtues and joys that come with enacting them; and also\nphilosophy and history (Cavendish 1655, 6). Cavendish writes,\n\nthe mind will be Wild and Barbarous, unless it be inclosed with Study,\nInstructed by Learning, and Governed by Knowledg and Understanding,\nfor then the Inhabitants of the Mind will live Peaceably, Happily,\nHonestly, and Honourably, by which they will Rule and Govern their\nassociate Appetites with Ease and Regularity. (Cavendish 1664b, 51)\n\n\nOne of the benefits of an education is that our minds become more\nfilled with information that helps us to navigate the world \u2014\nnot only to achieve our local aims but to work toward the more global\nresult of peace and security (Boyle 2006, 285\u2013287). Cavendish\ndoes not think that we can achieve these aims blindly and by a brute\nact of will. We need knowledge and familiarity with the ways of the\nworld, and we cannot come up with these by a brute act of will\neither. Ecosystems and other collections of bodies are able to\nsustain themselves in existence, in large part because of the skillful\ncommunication that takes place between their members. A commonwealth\nwill have a better chance of surviving for the long haul if its\nmembers are prepared to listen to each other and if they are in\nsynchrony with respect to a larger aim and if they have the\nwherewithal to respond to each other intelligently and without\nresistance.\n\nCavendish would also recommend that a sovereign hold constant the\nextent to which human beings are driven by the pursuit of public\nrecognition and fame. Cavendish herself thinks that our material minds\ndo not live on after we die and that, if we have immaterial souls that\ncontinue to exist, we have absolutely no notion of these or how or why\nwe would identify with them. She thinks that deep down the rest of us\nare suspicious as well:\n\nperceiving \u2026 that their after-life cannot be the same as their\npresent life is, they endeavour \u2026 that their Society may remain\nin remembrance amongst the particular and general Societies of the\nsame sort of Creatures, which we name Mankind: and this design causes\nall the Sensitive and Rational Parts, in one Society, to be\nindustrious, to leave some Mark for a lasting Remembrance, amongst\ntheir fellow-Creatures: which general resemblance, Man calls Fame.\n(Cavendish 1668b, 75\u201376)\n\n\nCavendish is very astute to point out the extent to which human beings\nare motivated by a desire for public recognition. She saw the evidence\nin her own day, and we can clearly see it in our\n own.[38]\n She can then argue that if generally speaking people are interested\nin the promotion of peace and stability, one of the ways that an\nindividual will have a good chance at achieving fame is by engaging in\nactivities and projects that help to secure peace and stability. These\nwould include inventions, infrastructure, and the construction of\nschools and libraries (Boyle 2006, 264). A wise sovereign will make\nsure that such behavior is encouraged and that it is also\nacknowledged. Not everybody is noble and exalted and impressive by\nbirth, and not everybody has all of the same talents (Cavendish 1655,\n69; Cavendish 1662a, 27, 37\u201338), but there are still a number of\nways that any human being can contribute to peace and stability.\nSociety can be structured so that people can operate in line\nwith their own talents and be acknowledged for what they do well\n\u2014 whether they be scientists, philosophers, laborers, members of\nthe military, writers, or something else \u2014 and a wise sovereign\nwould recognize all of these achievements so that a person would not\nbe motivated to secure fame in ways that are more unseemly. We are\nremembered well if we do our part to promote peace and social\nstability. And it is only if society lives on, and is stable and\norderly and civilized, that there will be people who might remember\nus.\n\nAnother issue that comes up in interpreting Cavendish\u2019s social and\npolitical philosophy is whether or not she is a feminist. It is\ntempting again to look to her view on occasional causation to shed\nlight on her view of the proper roles for females and males. Cavendish\nherself wanted to be a practicing scientist and philosopher, but\nwhether or not she could be so was a function not only of her\ndecisions but also of the receptivity of the surrounding world. She\ncould decide to be a scientist, but whether or not she would be a\nscientist is up to a lot of additional factors \u2014 whether her\nresults are disseminated and discussed, whether they are published,\nwhether she is taken seriously and seen as authoritative, and whether\nshe is part of a larger scientific community. Alternately, she (or a\nCavendish in a nearby possible world) might decide to open a business,\nor be a constable or barrister, but whether or not she is successful\nwould depend only in part on what she decides to do. To be a\nbusinessperson she would need to have a customer base, and to be an\nattorney she would need to be authoritative and believable in front of\nthose who deliver a verdict. Cavendish was not a prominent scientist\nin her time; nor was she a prominent philosopher. She attempted to\ncorrespond with Hobbes and others, but unlike the bodies that interact\nin constituting the ecosystems of nature and other organic units,\nthese philosophers were not cooperative.\n\nIn her natural philosophy Cavendish argues that the behavior of bodies\nis due in part to messages that are signaled from the\n\u201cagent\u201d body and in part to the response of the\n\u201cpassive\u201d body and to whether or not the\n\u201cpassive\u201d body is appropriately hospitable. Some of\nher texts suggest very strongly that her social and political\nphilosophy is informed by her view of the normal operations of nature.\nIn Blazing World, the Empress is transported from her home\nplanet and is pleased to find that the beings on the Blazing World\nwill interact with her and respect her authority. In real life, the\nhuman men on earth would not engage with Cavendish, but the\nworm-men and bear-men and bird-men and fish-men and ape-men have\nextensive conversations with the Empress about the cosmos, the nature\nof matter and mind, chemistry, and mathematics (29\u201342). At one\npoint the Empress seeks counsel from \u201cthe soul of one of the\nmost famous modern writers, as either of Galileo, Gassendus,\nDescartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More, etc.\u201d (67\u201368). She is\ninformed, however, that \u201cthey would scorn to be scribes to a\nwoman\u201d (68). The atmosphere of the Blazing World is quite\ndifferent from the atmosphere on earth, and whether or not a person is\na scientist or philosopher or other authority is only in part\ndependent on what is happening on her end.\n\nCavendish presents women as accomplished and successful in other texts\nas well. In Bell in Campo, Cavendish has a group of women\nform an army for the sake of showing men that women should be\n\u201cco-partners\u201d in government, and \u201chelp rule the\nWorld\u201d (588\u2013589). The women submit to a powerful\ngeneralless, and together they defeat the enemy and save the male army\nat the same time. The events in Bell in Campo are fairly\nstraightforward, but there might remain a question about Cavendish\u2019s\nown attitude toward those events, and in particular about her attitude\ntoward the achievements of the female army. On the one hand, it is\nreported in Bell in Campo that men take women to be \u201ca\ntrouble in the Commonwealth\u201d (588). In addition, the members of\nthe female army are rewarded for their achievements \u2014 rewarded\nby the men in power \u2014 with the right to control their family\nfinances, and the freedom to wear whatever they choose. On the other\nhand, Cavendish depicts the female army as being capable of doing what\na male army is normally commissioned to do, and as capable of doing\neven more. Furthermore, she is depicting how males in power would in\nfact respond (or how the males in her own world have responded) to a\ncircumstance in which a female army sweeps in to save the day. On one\nreading, Cavendish herself is suggesting that men and women are not\nequal in terms of the roles that they should perform and that men are\nin important ways superior. On another reading, Cavendish is\nreflecting that men are not superior to women but that the\nachievements of women have always occurred in an atmosphere in which\nmen are heavily advantaged.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that Cavendish leaves open the\nquestion of whether or not women are inferior by training and\neducation or if they are inferior by nature (for example Boyle 2006,\n278\u2013281). It seems unlikely that Cavendish thinks that women are\ninferior by nature if she depicts women as capable of the highest\nlevels of achievement in alternative possible worlds. Women are still\nwomen in these alternative worlds; what is different is the\nstructure of the surrounding audiences with which men and women have\nto contend. Cavendish herself was a remarkable person, as was the\nEmpress and the generalless of Bell in Campo. It is true that\nwomen are depicted as exceptional only in Cavendish\u2019s fictional work\n(McGuire 1978, 198; Boyle 2006, 279), and that might indicate that she\ntakes the idea of a skilled and capable woman to be fictional, but as\nper her view on occasional causation she might just be reflecting in\nthese alternative worlds that what it is for an agent to be successful\nis in part due to what the agent signals and in part to how its larger\nenvironment is responsive. Cavendish might have thought (with Spinoza)\nthat no individual is an island and that what an\nindividual can do and cannot do is to some degree a part of its\nphysical and psychological constitution and to a large degree a part\nof the lay of the land on which the individual would act.\n\nCavendish does however encourage a very conservative set of behaviors\nfor women to perform, and again the question arises of whether she is\nbasing her view on some assumptions about the nature of women more\ngenerally or if she has an eye to the environment in which women have\nhappened to find themselves. In World\u2019s Olio she emphasizes\nthe importance of the virtue of chastity, and also patience, humility\nand being fashionable and constant (73). The list is expanded by one\nof the speakers of Orations:\n\nModest, Chast, Temperate, Humble, Patient, and Pious; also to be\nHuswifely, Cleanly, and of few Words, all which will Gain us Praise\nfrom Men, and Blessing from Heaven, and Love in this World, and Glory\nin the Next. (229)\n\n\nHere Cavendish might be reflecting how women ought to behave in any\npossible world irrespective of the power and responses of the beings\nthat surround them. If she thinks that the nature of women is such\nthat women should be chaste and humble and quiet, then to the extent\nthat she thinks that other characteristics are higher and more exalted\nshe takes women to be an inferior part of the species. If she is\ninstead reading off of her own world what behaviors are regarded as\nlegitimate for women, then she is just describing the behavior that is\nadaptive to that environment. The generalless of Bell in\nCampo is not especially modest or temperate or quiet, but her\nbehavior would not \u201cgain us praise\u201d or \u201clove in this\nworld\u201d \u2014 the seventeenth-century environment in which\nCavendish thinks we find ourselves. But perhaps Cavendish thinks that\nthe generalless is operating counter to her own nature. Alternately,\nif Cavendish is reading off of her culture how women would be most\nwise to behave, then she might just be offering conservative advice\nabout how women can best flourish in the short material life that has\nbeen allotted to them.\n\nA final interpretive issue that arises for Cavendish is exactly how\nthe sovereign is supposed to have so much power and authority if power\nand achievement are in large part a function of the responsiveness of\nthe surrounding world. A sufficiently powerful sovereign would have to\nhave full control of the military and other underlings, and these in\nturn would need to be able to control the larger populace (James 2003,\nxxv\u2013xxvi). The sovereign would have to have enough power to force all\nof these people to act in accord with his or her will, but in the\nlight of her view on occasional causation Cavendish is committed to\nthe view that all that a sovereign would be able to do is send a\nsignal or message to these beings in the hope that they would obey.\nThe sovereign might try to take steps to increase the odds that\nunderlings will abide by his message, but that would be a matter of\nsending another message still. A sovereign cannot simply decree that\ncertain things happen: whether or not they happen is a function of the\nresponsiveness of the members of the commonwealth. For Cavendish, an\necosystem holds together, but not because a single member imposes its\nwill on the others. Instead, the members work together as a group, and\nif human beings are a part of nature, they would function under the\nsame constraints. If Cavendish is right, a sovereign has to be\nextremely powerful to secure peace and stability, but what it is for a\nsovereign to have power is to be wise enough to figure out which are\nthe messages that his subjects would accommodate (also Walters 2014,\n180\u2013182)\n8. Free Will and the Orderly Behavior of Bodies\n\nLike many of her seventeenth-century contemporaries, Cavendish\nsubscribes to the view that the universe is a plenum of contiguous\nbodies and that there is no empty space. We might wonder how\nindividual bodies would have any freedom or wiggle room to behave as\nthey please if they are so surrounded and tightly packed in. As we\nhave seen, Cavendish holds that bodies sometimes dominate and\nover-power the bodies that surround them, but she thereby\nsuggests that bodies are sometimes not dominated. She writes for\nexample that\n\nNature is full of variety of motions or actions, so are her parts, or\nelse she could not be said to be self-moving, if she were bound to\ncertain actions, and had not liberty to move as she pleases.\n(Cavendish 1668a, 158)\n\n\nNature having a free power to move, may move as she will. (Cavendish\n1664. 214).\n\n\nthe spirits work more easie, at least more freely, when they are not\ntaskt, than when they are like Apprentices or Journey-men; and will be\nmany times more active when they take or have liberty to play, or to\nfollow their own Appetites, than when they work (as I said) by\nconstraint\u2026 (Cavendish 1671, 590)\n\n\nHere we have Cavendish indicating that (in at least some circumstanes)\nthe various parts of nature are able to move as they please or as they\nwill. But we do not yet know what it means for her to say that a body\nmoves as it will. Perhaps Cavendish subscribes to a libertarian view\nof freedom according to which a creature is free when it possesses a\ntwo-way contra-causal ability to do otherwise. On such a view, an\nagent will always act in a certain way at a given moment, but at the\ntime of action it is always possible for the agent to do otherwise. Or\nperhaps Cavendish subscribes to a compatibilist view of freedom\naccording to which creatures do not possess a two-way ability to do\notherwise, but their action is free in the sense that is due to their\nwill alone, and is not encumbered by other causes.\n\nBodies are generally speaking free, Cavendish supposes, but it is not\nyet clear if she holds that the freedom of bodies is of a libertarian\nor a compatibilist variety. She does not use that contemporary\nterminology herself, of course, and so the question is whether or not\nshe cashes out freedom in terms of a contra-causal power by which\nbodies possess the ability to do otherwise than they do \u2013 again,\neven if she does not use that language \u2013 or if she takes freedom\nto be a matter of the wherewithal that a body has to act by the\nmotions that are internal to it and to keep those motions from being\nsquelched or redirected by an obstacle or hindrance. She nowhere\nspeaks in these exact terms either, but she does make some\ncomments that are very revealing.\n\nFor example, she defines voluntary motion as self-motion, and she\ndescribes the freest bodies at those that are able to make their way\nthrough the plenum with agility and without constraint. She\nwrites,\n\nby voluntary actions I understand self-actions; that is, such actions\nwhose principle of motion is within themselves, and doth not proceed\nfrom an exterior Agent\u2026. (Cavendish 1668a, \u201cTo the\nReader\u201d)\n\n\nhad not the Sensitive Parts incumbrances, they would be, in a degree,\nas agil, and as free as the Rational. (Cavendish 1668b, 20)\n\n\nall the motions are so ordered by Natures wisdom, as not any thing in\nNature can be otherwise, unless by a Supernatural Command and Power of\nGod. (Cavendish 1664, 144)\n\n\nWe might want to be more skeptical of this last passage, because\nCavendish is making a claim that makes reference to the nature and\nactivity of a being of which she thinks we have no idea, but the claim\nis still suggestive. Bracketing a miracle, nothing can happen in\nnature in any other way than it happens in fact, she is saying, but\nshe also supposes that bodies are still generally speaking free. They\nare free, she indicates in the other two passages, when their activity\nand behavior is not obstructed or constrained.\n\nThere are numerous passages throughout her corpus in which\nCavendish describes bodies as free, but there are just a few in\nwhich she fleshes out what it is to which freedom and voluntariness\namount. In these, her view is squarely compatibilist. There are also\npassages in which address the issue of free will from a theological\nperspective \u2013 where she considers whether or not an omniscient\nGod would have preordained all things from eternity or whether God\nwould have left the behavior of creatures more open (for example in\nCavendish 1668a, 295\u2013296, \u201cFurther Observations Upon\nExperimental Philosophy\u201d) \u2013 but in these she is careful to\nsuspend judgment. Other passages suggest a compatibilist reading of\nthe free behavior of creatures as well:\n\nBut man, and for all that I know, all other things, are governed by\noutward Objects, they rule, and we obey; for we do not rule and they\nObey, but every thing is led like dogs in a string, by a stronger\npower, but the outward power being invisible, makes us think, we set\nthe rules, and not the outward Causes, so that we are governed by that\nwhich is without us, not that which is within us; for man hath no\npower over himself. (Cavendish 1663, 29)\n\n\nAs for Chance, it is the visible Effects of some hidden\nCause; and Fortune, a sufficient Cause to produce such\nEffects: for, the conjunction of sufficient Causes, doth produce such\nor such Effects; which Effects could not be produced, if any of those\nCauses were wanting. (Cavendish 1668b, 16)\n\n\nIn a plenum of contiguous bodies, a body will sometimes redirect the\nmotions of a second body in way that that body resists, and in such\ncases the behavior of the second body is not free. In other cases the\nbehavior of the second body is amenable to the redirection of motion,\nand in these cases the motions of the second body are\n\u201coccasioned\u201d and \u201cforced\u201d (Cavendish 1664,\n443), yet the body is still moving as it\n pleases.[39]\n In yet other cases still, a body moves by way of motions that (of\ncourse) are internal to it, but without any outside interference or\nobstruction. But in such a case a body has the motions that it has in\nfact, and not any others. Nor will a body ever be the spontaneous\nsource of any new motion; nor does it (ever) acquire any new motion\nfrom other bodies. It has the motions that it has, and it acts\naccordingly. In a plenum of bodies that are always surrounded by\nfurther bodies, no individual body will ever be entirely independent,\nbut Cavendish is surely correct that some bodies are able to surround\nthemselves with a buffer that weakens or neutralizes the impact of\nbodies further out.\n\nOne potential objection to a compatibilist reading of Cavendish on\nfreedom is that there are numerous passages in her corpus in which she\nsays that bodies behave in a manner that is irregular (Boyle 2017). If\nbodies exhibit irregularity and disorder, they would appear to be in\npossession of a faculty of spontaneity, and Cavendish would appear to\nhold that in at least some instances they exercise freedom of the\nlibertarian variety.\n\nHere are some of the passages in which Cavendish speaks of\nirregularities that occur in nature:\n\n\u2026 [S]ome diseases have such sudden alterations, by the sudden\nchanges of motions, that a wise Physician will not, nor cannot venture\nto apply so many several medicines so suddenly as the alteration\nrequires; and shall therefore Physicians be condemned? And not onely\ncondemned for what cannot be helped by reason of the variety of\nirregular motions, but what cannot be helped in Nature? (Cavendish\n1664, 376)\n\n\n\u2026 Nature poysing her Actions by Opposites, there must needs be\nIrregularities, as well as Regularities; which is the cause that\nseldom any Creature is so exact, but there is some Exception.\n(Cavendish 1668b, 84)\n\n\nGOD, Eternally Perfect: Nature, Eternally Imperfect. GOD, Eternally\nInalterable: Nature Eternally Alterable. GOD, without Error: Nature,\nfull of Irregularities. GOD knows exactly, or perfectly, Nature:\nNature doth not perfectly know. (Cavendish 1668b, 241)\n\n\nCavendish certainly speaks of irregularities and disorder, but there\nare also passages in which she steps back and says that what she has\nin mind when she speaks of an irregularity is just an entity or event\nthat appears irregular to us against the background of our\nexpectations and\n conceptions.[40]\n She says for example that\n\nthere cannot be confusion amongst those parts of Nature, but there\nmust be a constant union and harmony betwixt them; for cross and\nopposite actions make no confusion, but onely a variety; and such\nactions which are different, cross and opposite, not moving always\nafter their usual and accustomed way, I name Irregular, for want of a\nbetter expression; but properly there is no such thing as Irregularity\nin Nature\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 538\u2013539)\n\n\n\u2026 Nevertheless, all these motions, whether regular or\nirregular, are natural; for regularity and irregularity hath but a\nrespect to particulars, and to our conceptions, because those motions\nwhich move not after the ordinary, common or usual way or manner, we\ncall Irregular. (Cavendish 1664, 359\u2013360)\n\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to read the passages in which\nCavendish speaks of irregularities in nature. One is to count them up\nand argue that because they outnumber the competing passages \u2013\nand they do \u2013 Cavendish holds that irregularities are real.\nAnother is to argue that she holds that there exist no irregularities\nat all. On this approach, we would emphasize the passages in which she\nsays that we identify something as an irregularity when it\nruns counter to our expectations. Any such passage would be treated as\na kind of meta-text that is instructing us how to read the passages in\nwhich irregularities are introduced. In that case, Cavendish could\nspeak of irregularities in a million passages or even more, but if she\nalso tells us that all that she means by the term\n\u201cirregularity\u201d is something that runs counter to our\nexpectations, then there is no need to count up the passages pro and\ncon. They are all consistent with the view that nature exhibits an\nexceptionless order.\n\nPerhaps another reason for thinking that creatures have libertarian\nfreedom is that there is normativity in nature \u2013 that there are\nthings that are good and things that are bad, and things that\ncreatures ought (or ought not) to do \u2013 but if there is\nnormativity in nature, then there must be a robust (and libertarian\nsense) in which it is possible for creatures to abide by that\nnormativity. But it is difficult to locate normativity in Cavendish\u2019s\nsystem. She holds that the elemental bodies of nature have features\nlike size, figure, motion, thought, and perception, but there is not a\nsingle passage in her corpus in which she includes normative features\nlike goodness and badness. Instead she says things like that\n\u201cNature knows of notthing else but of corporeal figurative\nMotions\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 333). In a piece entitled \u201cNo\nJudge in Nature,\u201d she writes that \u201cNo Intreaty, nor\nPetition can perswade Nature, nor any Bribes can corrupt, or alter the\ncourse of Nature. Justly there can be no complaints made against\nNature, nor to Nature.\u201d (Cavendish 1653b, 5). There is certainly\nroom for Cavendish to develop what we now call a naturalist\nmeta-ethics, according to which normative claims just reduce to\nfactors like the attitudes and preferences of subjects. She supposes\nthat different humans have different preferences and desires, and that\nnon-human creatures have preferences and desires also, and she could\neasily make sense of how different moral codes arise in different\ncommunities and subcommunities. But none of that is to suggest that\nshe allows that there is such a thing as good or bad\nsimpliciter or that she supposes that because there are\nthings we ought to do, there are things that we have the libertarian\nfreedom to do (or not\n do).[41]\n9. Fancies\n\nCavendish holds that what it is for a being to be free is for it to\nhave the wherewithal to do as it pleases without obstacle or\ninterference. She holds that many beings are in fact unfree, because\nthey have goals and aims that the surrounding world of objects works\nto thwart and prohibit. Cavendish\u2019s own goals of being a philosopher\nand scientist and political leader are a case in point. In many of her\ntexts she proposes that an appropriate response to the obstacles and\nconstraints of the real-world plenum is to develop and employ our\nfaculty of imagination to model alternative worlds that are more\namenable to our values, interests, and needs. She suggests a number of\nreasons why the construction of imaginary worlds might be of benefit:\n(1) they allow us to experience a version of the life that we are\nblocked from pursuing in the actual world; (2) they are enjoyable to\ninhabit; (3) they allow us to hold onto the self with which we\nidentify when the actual world does not leave room for us to\nexpress it; (4) they allow us to register for the record and for\nposterity why that self was not a viable option.\n\nCavendish writes in \u201cTo all Noble and Worthy Ladies,\u201d a\npreface to Blazing World, that if the real life blocks her\nfrom embodying a life with which she identifies, she will construct an\nanalogue of that life in her imagination. She writes,\n\nI am not Covetous, but as Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or\ncan be; which is the cause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth,\nor Charles the Second; yet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the\nFirst: and, though I have neither Power, Time, nor Occasion, to be a\ngreat Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be\nMistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I\nhave made One of my own. (Cavendish 1666, 6)\n\n\nCavendish supposes that imaginary worlds are enjoyable to inhabit.\nHere she is reflecting a view that is uncontroversial, at least if we\ntake seriously the level of pleasure that individuals seem to secure\nfrom getting lost in a book or play or other fictional realm. A person\nwill sometimes encounter a significant amount of frustration in their\nday-to-day life, for example in their job or their personal\nrelationships, and that person might be quite impatient to return to a\nstory in which they have been immersed. Cavendish herself suggests\nthat a vividly imagined world can be a source of greater\nsatisfaction than the world that is in front of us:\n\nFancy is the Ground whereon the Poetical aery Castles are built. There\nis no such sweet and pleasing Compagnion as Fancy, in a Poetical Head.\n(Cavendish 1655, 100\u2013101)\n\n\nCavendish also has some of the characters in her fiction express a\nsimilar view. In The Lady Contemplation, the main character\nproposes that\n\nthe greatest pleasures that can be in Fruition, I take in Imagination:\nfor whatsoever the sence enjoys from outward objects, they may enjoy\nin inward thoughts. For the mind takes as much pleasure in creating of\nFancies, as Nature to create and dissolve, and create Creatures anew:\nFor Fancy is the Minds creature, & imaginations are as\nseveral worlds, wherein those Creatures are bred and born, live and\ndye; thus the mind is like infinite Nature. (Playes, 184)\n\n\nWe might concede that Cavendish is right that a fictional world can\noften be a welcome alternative to our actual everyday affairs (also\nWalters 2014, 167\u2013168), but we might worry that she is\noverstating the case if she supposes that we can be just as fulfilled\nimagining a life with which we identify as we can by living it in\nfact. There is a difference between inhabiting a world of fictional\ncharacters \u2013 for example in an engrossing book or play \u2013\nand inhabiting a world that represents our own longing for a life that\nhas been denied to us. To inhabit the latter sort of world might just\nbring despair. Cavendish does not appear to think so, however, but she\nmight also be supposing that there is pleasure in capturing for the\nrecord why a particular world has been cut off from us, rather than\njust allowing ourselves to dissolve into one of the lives that has\nbeen made available. She might also be supposing that we can achieve\nan afterlife of fame if we write about alternative worlds and what\nthey have going for them, in a way that helps them to come to be. If\nthere is an alternative world that is much more desirable than the one\nin which we find ourselves, a written record of it might have both a\npersonal and a social impact.\n\nCavendish indeed speaks in a wide spectrum of texts of the ways in\nwhich the seventeenth-century world that surrounds her is not as\naccommodating to the pursuits and goals of women as it is to the\npursuits and goals of men. In some of these texts she says that the\nclimate for women has been so hostile that it is in fact true that\nwomen do not have the same capacities as men: women are either denied\nthe relevant training and expertise, or they are not taken seriously\nand their capacities are not allowed a platform. She writes,\n\nI here present the sum of my works, not that I think wise School-men,\nand industrious, laborious students should value my book for any\nworth, but to receive it without a scorn, for the good incouragement\nof our sex, lest in time we should grow irrational as idiots, \u2026\nthrough the carelesse neglects, and despisements of the masculine sex\nto the effeminate, thinking it impossible we should have either\nlearning or understanding, wit or judgement, as if we had not rational\nsouls as well as men, and we out of a custom of dejectednesse think so\ntoo, which makes us quit all industry towards profitable knowledge\nbeing imployed onely in loose, and pettie imployments, which takes\naway not onely our abilities towards arts, but higher capacities in\nspeculations, so as we are become like worms that onely live in the\ndull earth of ignorance, winding our selves sometimes out, by the help\nof some refreshing rain of good educations which seldom is given us;\nfor we are kept like birds in cages to hop up and down in our houses,\nnot sufferd to fly abroad to see the several changes of fortune, and\nthe various humors, ordained and created by nature; thus wanting the\nexperiences of nature, we must needs want the understanding and\nknowledge and so consequently prudence, and invention of men: thus by\nan opinion, which I hope is but an erronious one in men, we are shut\nout of all power, and Authority by reason we are never imployed either\nin civil nor marshall affaires, our counsels are despised, and laught\nat, the best of our actions are troden down with scorn, by the\nover-weaning conceit men have of themselves and through a dispisement\nof us. (Cavendish 1663, \u201cTwo the Two Universities,\u201d\nunnumbered)\n\n\nThere will be many Heroick Women in some Ages, in others very\nPropheticall; in some Ages very pious, and devout: For our Sex is\nwonderfully addicted to the spirits. But this Age hath produced many\neffeminate Writers, as well as Preachers, and many effeminate Rulers,\nas well as Actors. And if it be an Age when the effeminate spirits\nrule, as most visible they doe in every Kingdome, let us take the\nadvantage, and make the best of our time, for feare their reigne\nshould not last long ; whether it be in the Amazonian Government, or\nin the Politick Common-wealth, or in flourishing Monarchy, or in\nSchooles of Divinity, or in Lectures of Philosophy, or in witty\nPoetry, or any thing that may bring honour to our Sex. (Cavendish\n1653, \u201cTo all Writing Ladies,\u201d unnumbered)\n\n\nsince all Heroick Actions, Publick Employments, as well Civil as\nMilitary, and Eloquent Pleadings, are deni\u2019d my Sex in this Age, I may\nbe excused for writing so much. (Cavendish 1671, C4)\n\n\nIn this last passage Cavendish is suggesting that one outlet for the\nenergies of an individual who is blocked from pursuing their more\noutwardly directed aspirations is to write. In Blazing World,\nBell in Campo, and other texts, Cavendish indeed utilizes\nthat outlet to enact roles that are regularly denied to women in the\nplenum of seventeenth-century England. The plenum does not allow women\nto take on any number of roles, and it does not advance them the\nopportunity to acquire the requisite skill and training and know-how.\nBut even if women did acquire that training, there is an\nimportant sense in which they would still lack the capacities for the\nroles in question. Consider the following scene that Cavendish\nconstructs in the Introduction to her Playes:\n\n1. Gentleman. This Play that I would have you go to, is a new Play.\n\n\n2. Gentleman. But is there newes in the Play, that is (is there new\nwit, fancyes, or new Scenes) and not taken out of old storyes, or old\nPlayes newly translated?\n\n\n1. Gentleman. I know not that, but this Play was writ by a Lady, who\non my Conscience hath neither Language, nor Learning, but what is\nnative and naturall.\n\n\n2. Gentleman. A woman write a Play! Out upon it; out upon it, for it\ncannot be good, besides you say she is a Lady, which is the likelyer\nto make the Play worse, a woman and a Lady to write a Play; sigh,\nsigh.\n\n\n3. Gentleman. Why may not a Lady write a good Play?\n\n\n2. Gentleman. No, for a womans wit is too weak and too conceived to\nwrite a Play.\n\n\n1. Gentleman. But if a woman hath wit, or can write a good Play, what\nwill you say then?\n\n\n2. Gentleman. Why, I will say no body will believe it, for if it be\ngood, they will think she did not write it, or at least say she did\nnot, besides the very being a woman condemnes it, were it never so\nexcellent and care, for men will not allow women to have wit, or we\nmen to have reason, for if we allow them wit, we shall lose our\nprehemency \u2026 .\n\n\nWe might consider alternative cases that are just as easy to envision\n\u2013 a woman who is highly trained as doctor or attorney, but who\ndoes not come across as sufficiently authoritative to a patient or\njury; an Asian-American who is a seriously talented actor but who\ncannot get a role in a movie except as a caricature, if that is all\nthat audiences are willing to see; a highly-trained African\nAmerican carpenter who has trouble getting hired to build a backyard\nfence or deck if that means leaving him with a key to enter the house\nduring the day; a figure like Mersault in Camus\u2019s The\nStranger, who would have easily merited acquittal by self-defense\nif he had not come across as such an outsider. In all of these cases,\nthere are the motions that take place on the side of the agent, and\nthere are the motions that occur in the outside environment. Cavendish\nis pointing out that our ability to live a life with which we identify\nis a function of both kinds of motion and that the second kind of\nmotion is much more amenable to some than to others. The judge and\njury in all such cases do not necessarily run through a conscious\npattern of exclusionary reasoning to single out the agent in question;\nthere might just be a feeling of discomfort, and often it is easiest\nto take the path of least resistance.\n\nThere are number of explicit reasons that Cavendish suggests as to why\nthe construction of imaginary worlds would be of benefit. There are\nadditional reasons that she might have as well, but to posit these on\nher behalf is a bit more speculative and requires further research.\nThe reasons include: (5) they allow us to model a picture of a world\nthat might come to be \u2013 that is, to model a route by which we\nmight get there, and to shine a light on otherwise invisible obstacles\nthat might be in our way; (6) they habituate other minds and ready\nthem for change that would otherwise feel sudden and abrupt; and (7)\nwritten records of the most successful of our imaginings might survive\nand secure us an afterlife of fame. Cavendish was fairly conservative\nin her politics, but that does not mean that the she did not single\nout particular phenomena for criticism, and it does not mean that she\nhad an in-principle aversion to social\n change.[42]\n In passages that we have considered, she certainly takes issue with\npractices that perpetuate gender inequality, and she models\nscience-fictional worlds that expose how that inequality would be\ndramatically reduced if our own world were very different. She also\nindicates in some passages that an advantage of modeling alternative\nscenarios in imagination, as opposed to straightforwardly imposing\nthem on the world, is that certain kinds of violence and unrest can be\navoided. In the Epilogue to Blazing World, she writes,\n\nBy this Poetical Description, you may perceive, that my ambition is\nnot onely to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole World; and that the\nWorlds I have made, both the Blazing- and the other Philosophical\nWorld, mentioned in the first Part of this Description, are framed and\ncomposed of the most pure, that is, the Rational parts of Matter,\nwhich are the parts of my Mind; which Creation was more easily and\nsuddenly effected, than the Conquests of the two famous Monarchs of\nthe World, Alexander and Cesar. Neither have I made such disturbances,\nand caused so many dissolutions of particulars, otherwise named\ndeaths, as they did; for I have destroyed but some few men in a little\nBoat, which dyed through the extremity of cold, and that by the hand\nof Justice, which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing\naway a young and beauteous Lady. And in the formation of those Worlds,\nI take more delight and glory, than ever Alexander or Cesar did in\nconquering this terrestrial world; and though I have made my\nBlazing-world a Peaceable World, allowing it but one Religion, one\nLanguage, and one Government; yet could I make another World, as full\nof Factions, Divisions and Warrs, as this is of Peace and Tranquility;\nand the Rational figures of my Mind might express as much courage to\nfight, as Hector and Achilles had; and be as wise as Nestor, as\nEloquent as Ulysses, and as beautiful as Hellen. But I esteeming Peace\nbefore Warr, Wit before Policy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the\nfigures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses,\nHellen, &c. chose rather the figure of Honest Margaret Newcastle,\nwhich now I would not change for all this Terrestrial World; and if\nany should like the World I have made, and be willing to be my\nSubjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean\nin their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to\nbe Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern\nthemselves as they please. (Cavendish 1666, 109)\n\n\nIn this passage, Cavendish speaks to the way in which participation in\nfictional stories does not lead to some of the difficult and\nproblematic consequences that would occur if those stories unfolded in\nreal life. We know that Cavendish witnessed the horrors of civil war\nin her own time, and she might subscribe to the view that social\nchange needs to be gradual if it is to occur at all and not lead to\nsuch consequences \u2013 in particular, to the kind of backlash that\nsets progress back further still. Writing is no doubt a platform that\ncan make more malleable some of the resistance to social change. If a\ntradition is predominant and entrenched, and a critical mass of\nindividuals benefit from its continued existence, the attempt to\noverturn it in real life will be countered with at least as much\nforce. Imagination would appear to be more fluid, and over the long\nhaul a vividly entertained scenario might become so familiar as to be\ninnocuous. If we are the author of that scenario, we might even become\nfamous for playing a part in changing the world.\n10. Conclusion\n\nCavendish\u2019s philosophical work was not taken very seriously in the\nseventeenth century, but it is certainly relevant today. She is\npresumably right to warn about the inconsistency in insisting that God\nis utterly transcendent while being utterly confident in putting\nforward claims about His nature. She has also anticipated a\ncontemporary emphasis on the study of the brain and body in addressing\nmental health. In addition, she has made a contribution to the current\ndebate about how to understand the relation between the most basic\nelements of body and the mental activity that is manifested in human\nbeings and other organisms (Strawson 2008; McGinn 1999, 6\u201318;\nChalmers 1996, 3\u20136; and Nagel 1974, 435\u2013450). She is also\nimportant insofar as she anticipates the arguments and views of early\nmodern thinkers who are firmly in the canon and who already secure a\ngreat deal of attention. Finally, she offers extremely compelling\ninsights into issues of agency and authority. She argues that one of\nthe reasons why an individual is often unsuccessful in embodying a\nlife with which they identify is that, even if everything is in order\non the side of their decisions and talents and skills, there is often\nsocial and political corrosion in the interface between their\ndecisions and the world.\n",
