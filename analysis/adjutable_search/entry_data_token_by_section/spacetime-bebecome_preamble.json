    "main_text": "\n\nWhat is time, and is it real? If it is, does time flow or lapse or\npass? Are the future or the past as real as the present? These\nmetaphysical questions have been debated for more than two millennia,\nwith no resolution in sight. Modern physics provides us, however, with\ntools that enable us to sharpen these old questions and generate new\narguments. Does the special theory of relativity, for example, show\nthat there is no temporal passage or that the future is as real as the\npresent? The focus of this entry will be on these new insights into\nthose old questions.\n",
