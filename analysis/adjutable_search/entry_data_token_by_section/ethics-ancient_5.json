    "main_text": "Cyrenaics\n6. Cyrenaics\n\nThe first of the Cyrenaic school was Aristippus, who came from Cyrene,\na Greek city on the north African coast. The account of his teachings,\nin Diogenes Laertius, can seem sometimes inconsistent. Nevertheless,\nAristippus is interesting because, as a thorough hedonist, he is\nsomething of a foil for Epicurus. First of all, pleasure is the end or\nthe goal of life \u2013 what everyone should seek in life. However,\nthe pleasure that is the end is not pleasure in general, or pleasure\nover the long term, but immediate, particular pleasures. Thus the end\nvaries situation by situation, action by action. The end is not\nhappiness because happiness is the sum of particular pleasures (DL II\n87\u201388). Accumulating the pleasures that produce happiness is\ntiresome (DL II 90). Particular pleasures are ones that are close-by\nor sure. Moreover, Aristippus said that pleasures do not differ from\none another, that one pleasure is not more pleasant than another. This\nsort of thinking would encourage one to choose a readily available\npleasure rather than wait for a \u201cbetter\u201d one in the\nfuture. This conclusion is reinforced by other parts of his teaching.\nHis school says that bodily pleasures are much better than mental\npleasures. While this claim would seem to contradict the idea that\npleasures do not differ, it does show preference for the immediately\nor easily available pleasures of bodily gratification over, e.g., the\nmental pleasure of a self-aware just person. In fact,\nAristippus\u2019 school holds that pleasure is good even if it comes\nfrom the most unseemly things (DL II 88). Aristippus, then, seems to\nhave raised improvidence to the level of a principle.\n\nStill, it is possible that the position is more than an elaborate\njustification for short-sighted pleasure-seeking. Cyrenaics taught\nthat a wise man (sophos) (one who always pursues immediate\ngratification) will in general live more pleasantly than a foolish\nman. That prudence or wisdom (phron\u00easis) is good, not\nin itself but in its consequences, suggests that some balance, perhaps\neven regarding others, is required in choosing pleasures (DL II 91).\nThe Cyrenaic attitude to punishment seems to be an example of\nprudence. They hold that nothing is just, fine, or base by nature but\nonly by convention and custom; still a good man will do nothing out of\nline through fear of punishment (DL II 93). Finally, they hold that\nfriendship is based in self-interest (DL II 91). These aspects of\nCyrenaic teaching suggest they are egoist hedonists. If so, there are\ngrounds for taking the interest of others into account as long as\ndoing so is based on what best provides an individual pleasure.\n\nNevertheless, Aristippus\u2019 school holds that the end of life is a\npsychological good, pleasure. Still, it is particular pleasures not\nthe accumulation of these that is the end. As a consequence, their\nmoral theory contrasts sharply with others in antiquity. If we take\nthe claims about the wise man, prudence, and friendship to be\nreferences to virtue, then Aristippus\u2019 school denies that virtue\nis indispensable for achieving the end or goal of life. While they\nhold that virtue is good insofar as it leads to the end, they seem\nprepared to dispense with virtue in circumstances where it proves\nineffective. Even if they held virtue in more esteem, the Cyrenaics\nwould nonetheless not be eudaimonists since they deny that happiness\nis the end of life.\n",
