    "main_text": "The Soul, Theurgy and Religion || The soul\u2019s place in the system\n6.1 The soul\u2019s place in the system\n\nAccording to Iamblichus, \u201csoul\u201d is but the last and\nweakest link in the chain of \u201chigher genera\u201d\n(kreittona gen\u0113). In the Reply to Porphyry,\nthose entities are enumerated in full:\ngods\u2014archangels\u2014angels\u2014demons\u2014heroes\u2014archons\nruling the world\u2014enmattered archons\u2014souls. This is a token\nof Iamblichus\u2019 receptiveness towards the religious speculation\nof his day, although most of this theological bestiary was in fact\nalready present in Porphyry\u2019s Letter to Anebo.\nIamblichus\u2019 acceptance of \u201cevil demons\u201d (cf.\nO\u2019Neill 2018) is particularly interesting, since it seems to\nundermine Iamblichus\u2019 monism and providentialism, and is best\nexplained as reflecting the influence of the Chaldean\nOracles.\n\nIn contradistinction with the gods, the soul receives a plethora of\nnegative traits: it is imperfect, intermittent, it leans towards\nmatter; and while the causes of Order and Beauty exist in full\ncommunion with the gods, the soul can never be given more than a mere\nshare of it (Reply to Porphyry I, 6\u20137 [SS-2013:\n15.14\u201317.7]). The immutability of this celestial hierarchy is\nstriking, and foreshadows the later works of Hierocles, Proclus, and\npseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Although the soul\u2019s\nversatility\u2014its ability to \u201cmake use of varied forms and\nlife-principles\u201d\u2014allows it to attach itself to superior\nbeings and lay claim \u201cto receiving perfection as an angelic,\nimmaculate soul\u201d (Reply to Porphyry II, 2 [SS-2013:\n51.10\u201352.11]), on closer reading it appears to be unable to\nescape its condition by virtue of its own essence: its ascent is never\ncomplete (it is an endeavor, ephesis or\nhen\u014dsis, with a suffix expressing verbal action) and it\npresupposes, moreover, the gods\u2019 \u201cgoodwill and\nillumination\u201d. Porphyry had previously drawn a similar\ndistinction between demons that are so \u201cby essence\u201d\n(kat\u2019 ousian) or by mere \u201crelation\u201d\n(kata skhesin), the latter being those humans who, by virtue\nof their excellent life, are allotted demonic status. On the other\nhand, the human soul is also unable to be relegated to the rank of\nanimals via metempsychosis (cf. the title of one of Iamblichus\u2019\npsychological works preserved by Nemesius of Emesa, On the Nature\nof Man, chap. 2, p. 35.7\u201311 Morani). Some points, however,\nremain unclear, such as how exactly Iamblichus\u2019 generic\ndistinction between human souls and \u201cdivine\u201d ones would\nfit within such a structure; or what we are to make of the souls of\nexceptional, even semi-divine characters such as Pythagoras or the\ntheurgists. Similar preoccupations underlie Frs. 82 and 83 In\nTimaeum [D-1973], interpreting Timaeus 41d.\n\nLastly and perhaps most importantly, the soul is irremediably inferior\nto the intellect. Rejecting any internalist interpretation of\nintellectual processes, Iamblichus regards them as the result of the\nsoul\u2019s illumination by a transcendent entity. Our information on\nthis matter is to be gathered mostly from the late Aristotelian\ncommentators, pseudo-Simplicius (see In De anima\n313.1\u201310, with a reference to the \u201cunparticipated\u201d\nintellect which, if genuinely Iamblichean, would predate Proclean\nterminology) and Priscian of Lydia (Metaphrasis in\nTheophrastum): these relatively neglected texts are the object of\nthe pioneering work Steel 1978. Indeed, such a position implies some\nknowledge of the philosophical debates on this issue within the\nAristotelian tradition (Theophrastus, Alexander). Its significance is\nenormous, insofar as it directly leads to the rejection of\nPlotinus\u2019 doctrine of the undescended soul: that is, the idea\nthat something of the soul always remains in the intelligible world.\nThus, rejecting the notion that the soul shares homeomereia\nwith the remaining intellectual entities, Iamblichus writes:\n\n\nthe doctrine opposed to this separates soul, insofar as it is born\nsecond with regard to the intellect as a distinct hypostasis, and\ninterprets what, in it, partakes of intellect as something dependent\nfrom intellect, although it is susceptible of individual existence;\nand it separates it from all the higher genera. (De anima,\nsect. 7 [DF-2002])\n\n\nIamblichus also fiercely attacks Plotinus (as well as Theodorus of\nAsine) for the assumption that \u201cthere is something in us that is\nimpassible and always thinking\u201d (In Timaeum [D-1973:\nFr. 87]; on this text see Rist 1975 and Dillon 2005). However, here\nagain the attitude of the superior souls with regard to their descent\nis somewhat obscure: according to Damascius (In Parm. IV,\n24.1\u20137 Comb\u00e8s & Westerink), Iamblichus taught that\nthe first class of souls \u201cdescends while not descending\u201d,\nand that the descent \u201conly effects a presence alongside what is\nhere\u201d. This problem was tackled by van den Berg (1997; opting\nfor the existence of unaffected pure souls and thus positing\nIamblichus as an intermediary between Plotinus and Proclus) and\nTaormina (2012; emphasizing that every soul remains separated from the\nintelligible and only relates to it through participation). It is, in\nany case, clear that Iamblichus conceived of the soul\u2019s presence\nin this world as something natural and normal, not as a transitory\nexile, even less as \u201calways an evil\u201d (the theory of\nCronius, Numenius and Harpocration, criticized in De anima\nsect. 29 [DF-2002]).\n",
