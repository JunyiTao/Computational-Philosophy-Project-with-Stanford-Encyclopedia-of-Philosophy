    "main_text": "Hume\u2019s Problem\n1. Hume\u2019s Problem\n\nHume introduces the problem of induction as part of an analysis of the\nnotions of cause and effect. Hume worked with a picture, widespread in\nthe early modern period, in which the mind was populated with mental\nentities called \u201cideas\u201d. Hume thought that ultimately all\nour ideas could be traced back to the \u201cimpressions\u201d of\nsense experience. In the simplest case, an idea enters the mind by\nbeing \u201ccopied\u201d from the corresponding impression (T.\n1.1.1.7/4). More complex ideas are then created by the combination of\nsimple ideas (E. 2.5/19). Hume took there to be a number of relations\nbetween ideas, including the relation of causation (E. 3.2). (For more\non Hume\u2019s philosophy in general, see Morris & Brown\n2014).\n\nFor Hume, the relation of causation is the only relation by means of\nwhich \u201cwe can go beyond the evidence of our memory and\nsenses\u201d (E. 4.1.4, T. 1.3.2.3/74). Suppose we have an object\npresent to our senses: say gunpowder. We may then infer to an effect\nof that object: say, the explosion. The causal relation links our past\nand present experience to our expectations about the future (E.\n4.1.4/26).\n\nHume argues that we cannot make a causal inference by purely a\npriori means (E. 4.1.7). Rather, he claims, it is based on\nexperience, and specifically experience of constant conjunction. We\ninfer that the gunpowder will explode on the basis of past experience\nof an association between gunpowder and explosions.\n\nHume wants to know more about the basis for this kind of inference. If\nsuch an inference is made by a \u201cchain of reasoning\u201d (E.\n4.2.16), he says, he would like to know what that reasoning is. In\ngeneral, he claims that the inferences depend on a transition of the\nform:\n\n\nI have found that such an object has always been attended with\nsuch an effect, and I foresee, that other objects, which are, in\nappearance, similar, will be attended with similar effects. (E.\n4.2.16)\n\n\nIn the Treatise, Hume says that\n\n\nif Reason determin\u2019d us, it would proceed upon that principle\nthat instances, of which we have had no experience, must resemble\nthose, of which we have had experience, and that the course of nature\ncontinues always uniformly the same. (T. 1.3.6.4)\n\n\nFor convenience, we will refer to this claim of similarity or\nresemblance between observed and unobserved regularities as the\n\u201cUniformity Principle (UP)\u201d. Sometimes it is also called\nthe \u201cResemblance Principle\u201d, or the \u201cPrinciple of\nUniformity of Nature\u201d.\n\nHume then presents his famous argument to the conclusion that there\ncan be no reasoning behind this principle. The argument takes the form\nof a dilemma. Hume makes a distinction between relations of ideas and\nmatters of fact. Relations of ideas include geometric, algebraic and\narithmetic propositions, \u201cand, in short, every affirmation,\nwhich is either intuitively or demonstratively certain\u201d.\n\u201cMatters of fact\u201d, on the other hand are empirical\npropositions which can readily be conceived to be other than they are.\nHume says that\n\n\nAll reasonings may be divided into two kinds, namely, demonstrative\nreasoning, or that concerning relations of ideas, and moral reasoning,\nor that concerning matter of fact and existence. (E. 4.2.18)\n\n\nHume considers the possibility of each of these types of reasoning in\nturn, and in each case argues that it is impossible for it to supply\nan argument for the Uniformity Principle.\n\nFirst, Hume argues that the reasoning cannot be demonstrative, because\ndemonstrative reasoning only establishes conclusions which cannot be\nconceived to be false. And, he says,\n\n\nit implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change, and\nthat an object seemingly like those which we have experienced, may be\nattended with different or contrary effects. (E. 4.2.18)\n\n\nIt is possible, he says, to clearly and distinctly conceive of a\nsituation where the unobserved case does not follow the regularity so\nfar observed (E. 4.2.18, T. 1.3.6.5/89).\n\nSecond, Hume argues that the reasoning also cannot be \u201csuch as\nregard matter of fact and real existence\u201d. He also calls this\n\u201cprobable\u201d reasoning. All such reasoning, he claims,\n\u201cproceed upon the supposition, that the future will be\nconformable to the past\u201d, in other words on the Uniformity\nPrinciple (E. 4.2.19).\n\nTherefore, if the chain of reasoning is based on an argument of this\nkind it will again be relying on this supposition, \u201cand taking\nthat for granted, which is the very point in question\u201d. (E.\n4.2.19, see also T. 1.3.6.7/90). The second type of reasoning then\nfails to provide a chain of reasoning which is not circular.\n\nIn the Treatise version, Hume concludes\n\n\nThus, not only our reason fails us in the discovery of the\nultimate connexion of causes and effects, but even after\nexperience has inform\u2019d us of their constant\nconjunction, \u2019tis impossible for us to satisfy ourselves by\nour reason, why we shou\u2019d extend that experience beyond those\nparticular instances, which have fallen under our observation. (T.\n1.3.6.11/91\u20132)\n\n\nThe conclusion then is that our tendency to project past regularities\ninto the future is not underpinned by reason. The problem of induction\nis to find a way to avoid this conclusion, despite Hume\u2019s\nargument.\n\nAfter presenting the problem, Hume does present his own\n\u201csolution\u201d to the doubts he has raised (E. 5, T.\n1.3.7\u201316). This consists of an explanation of what the inductive\ninferences are driven by, if not reason. In the Treatise Hume\nraises the problem of induction in an explicitly contrastive way. He\nasks whether the transition involved in the inference is produced\n\n\nby means of the understanding or imagination; whether we are\ndetermin\u2019d by reason to make the transition, or by a certain\nassociation and relation of perceptions? (T. 1.3.6.4)\n\n\nAnd he goes on to summarize the conclusion by saying\n\n\nWhen the mind, therefore, passes from the idea or impression of one\nobject to the idea or belief of another, it is not determin\u2019d by\nreason, but by certain principles, which associate together the ideas\nof these objects, and unite them in the imagination. (T. 1.3.6.12)\n\n\nThus, it is the imagination which is taken to be responsible for\nunderpinning the inductive inference, rather than reason.\n\nIn the Enquiry, Hume suggests that the step taken by the\nmind,\n\n\nwhich is not supported by any argument, or process of the\nunderstanding \u2026 must be induced by some other principle of\nequal weight and authority. (E. 5.1.2)\n\n\nThat principle is \u201ccustom\u201d or \u201chabit\u201d. The\nidea is that if one has seen similar objects or events constantly\nconjoined, then the mind is inclined to expect a similar regularity to\nhold in the future. The tendency or \u201cpropensity\u201d to draw\nsuch inferences, is the effect of custom:\n\n\n\u2026 having found, in many instances, that any two kinds of\nobjects, flame and heat, snow and cold, have always been conjoined\ntogether; if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind\nis carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and to believe,\nthat such a quality does exist and will discover itself upon a nearer\napproach. This belief is the necessary result of of placing the mind\nin such circumstances. It is an operation of the soul, when we are so\nsituated, as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love, when we\nreceive benefits; or hatred, when we meet with injuries. All these\noperations are a species of natural instincts, which no reasoning or\nprocess of the thought and understanding is able, either to produce,\nor to prevent. (E. 5.1.8)\n\n\nHume argues that the fact that these inferences do follow the course\nof nature is a kind of \u201cpre-established harmony\u201d (E.\n5.2.21). It is a kind of natural instinct, which may in fact be more\neffective in making us successful in the world, than if we relied on\nreason to make these inferences.\n",
