    "main_text": "Reasons for Singular Propositions: The argument from indexicals and demonstratives\n3. Reasons for Singular Propositions: The argument from indexicals and demonstratives\n David Kaplan, in (1977/1989), and John Perry, in (1977), (1979), \n(1980a/b), and (2001), argued that an adequate theory of indexicality requires\nsingular propositions. An indexical is an expression whose content is\nnot fixed by its linguistic meaning alone but requires\nextra-linguistic contextual supplementation. Take, for example, the\nsentence \u2018I am happy\u2019, considered in isolation from any\nparticular utterance or specifications of who is uttering it at what\ntime. The question of whether or not it is true is hardly\nsensible. That question makes sense only when we either consider an\nutterance of the sentence or provide the specification of at least an\nagent as speaker. (We remain neutral on the issue whether utterances\nof sentences are the primary bearers of semantic values or sentences\nin context.) Both Kaplan and Perry argue that a Fregean account of\nindexical expressions like \u2018I\u2019, \u2018today\u2019, and\n\u2018here\u2019 and demonstrative expressions like\n\u2018he\u2019, \u2018this\u2019, and \u2018there\u2019 is\ninadequate. We focus here on Perry's view.\n\n Perry argued against the Fregean claim that there is a single entity\n\u2014 sense \u2014 that answers to the three principles of sense\nindividuation presented in section 1. He argued that this\nidentification leads to several problems when applied to\nindexicals. Perry's position is that one entity answers to\nAccept and a distinct entity answers\nto Truth and Attitude. More\ngenerally, Perry argued that an adequate account of indexicals and\ndemonstratives in thought and language requires that we have one\nentity serving as cognitive values and a distinct entity serving as\nthe contents of thoughts and sentences and bearers of truth value. The\nmistake of the Fregean is to think that there is a single item that\ncan do all of the work.\n\n Consider the following sentence.\n\n (6) George quit his job today.\n \n\n (6) doesn't express a complete proposition on its own because\n\u2018today\u2019 does not have a complete sense on its own. Suppose\nthat George held exactly one job, which he quit on 1 Aug 2000. (6) is\nthen true as uttered on 1 Aug 2000 and false as uttered on any other\nday. Perry considers three Fregean accounts of the sense expressed by\na use of \u2018today\u2019 in (6) and argues that they all\nfail. The first identifies the sense of \u2018today\u2019 with\nits role or character; the second identifies it with an equivalence\nclass of ordinary Fregean senses; and the third involves looking to\nthe beliefs of the speaker for its sense.\n\n We begin with the first, according to which the sense of a use of\n\u2018today\u2019 is its role. This account, in effect, denies that\n\u2018today\u2019 is an indexical. This is because the role of an\nexpression is the rule that takes one from a particular utterance of\nthe expression to its content on that use, which is the same across\nall uses. An expression's role is related to its linguistic\nmeaning. The role of \u2018today\u2019 is a rule that takes one from\na given use to the day of that use and the role of \u2018I\u2019 is a\nrule that takes one from a given use to the speaker of that use. So,\nif the sense of \u2018today\u2019 were its role, the same thought\nwould be expressed by every utterances of (6), regardless of the day\nof occurrence. But, as we have seen, different utterances of (6) have\ndifferent truth values. But then, by Truth, those\nutterances express different thoughts. Furthermore, the account\nviolates Accept, as it is possible to rationally take\ndifferential attitudes towards different utterances of (6). The sense\nof a use of \u2018today\u2019,then, is not its role.\n\n\nAccording to the second Fregean account, the sense of a use of an\nindexical like \u2018today\u2019 is the class of referentially\nequivalent ordinary Fregean senses. The equivalence class of thoughts\nfor an utterance of (6) on 1 Aug 2000 is the class of thoughts\ncomposed of the (incomplete) sense of \u2018George quit his\njob\u2019 and any completing sense that determines 1 Aug\n2000. Referential equivalence classes function much like singular\npropositions, in that they do not place any restrictions on the way in\nwhich the agent conceives of the referent of the thought. This makes\nthem poor candidates for accounting for the cognitive value of a\nsentence, as they lead to violations of\nAccept. Consider the following case, derived from a\ncase of Perry's. Suppose that you are sitting in a large harbor city\nand see the bow of a ship, with the name \u2018Enterprise\u2019\nclearly in view, sticking out behind a building. You also see the\nstern of a ship, with no name, sticking out behind another building\ntwo blocks away. The water view is obstructed by buildings for the\nintervening blocks. You might then accept your companion's\nutterance of the sentence \u2018This is the Enterprise\u2019,\npointing at the bow of the ship, but reject her utterance of the\nsentence \u2018This is the Enterprise\u2019, pointing at the stern\nof the ship. Associated with both utterances is the same equivalence\nclass of Fregean senses, as both uses of \u2018this\u2019 refer to\nthe same ship. But, because you competently accept the one and not the\nother, by Accept, different senses are expressed. We\nget the same results for (6) by considering someone who is confused\nabout what day it is. She might then accept an utterance of (6) on 1\nAugust 2000 while rejecting an utterance of \u2018George quit his job\non 1 August 2000\u2019, without a change of mind and despite the fact\nthat the same equivalence class is associated with both. If the sense\nof a use of \u2018today\u2019 is intended to capture that use's\ncognitive significance, as it clearly should on a Fregean account, we\nshould reject this second account.\n\n\nThe failings of the first two accounts as plausible Fregean accounts\nof (6) are fairly evident. The third Fregean account turns to the\nattitudes of the speaker to determine the sense of a given use of an\nindexical. Perry presented the key idea as follows.\n\n To understand a demonstrative, is to be able to supply a sense for it\non each occasion, which determines as reference the value the\ndemonstrative has on that occasion\u2026. [W]e can say that for each\nperson the sense of the demonstrative \u2018today\u2019 for that\nperson on a given day is just the sense of one of the descriptions\nD (or some combination of all the descriptions) such that on\nthat day he believes [\u2018Today is D\u2019].\n(1977, 11\u201312) \n \n\n  Perry required that the descriptions D should be\nnonindexical.  Perry then presented three arguments against this\nsuggestion. (Kaplan developed similar arguments against what he calls\nthe Fregean theory of demonstratives in (1977/1989).)\n\n\nThe first objection is the irrelevancy of belief\nobjection. Believing that you live in that time and possessing\naccurate descriptive information of the medieval age does not make\nyour uses of \u2018today\u2019 about 1 August 1204, even though that\nis the date that best fits your conception of the date of your\nutterance. Uses of \u2018today\u2019 are about whatever day they\noccur on, whatever descriptions one associate with one's uses of the\nexpression and however one conceives of the day of one's\nutterance. But if the sense of a use of a \u2018today\u2019 were\ndetermined by the beliefs of the speaker, and if sense determines\nreference, then it would seem that your utterance is about 1204. So,\nthe beliefs of the speaker are irrelevant to the day an utterance of\n\u2018today\u2019 is about. \n This objection works best with \u201cautomatic\u201d or\n\u201cpure\u201d indexicals like \u2018today\u2019 and\n\u2018I\u2019 rather than \u201cnon-automatic\u201d indexicals or\n\u201ctrue\u201d demonstratives like \u2018she\u2019 and\n\u2018this\u2019, which require an associated demonstration to refer\nin context. This is because the reference of a use of a true\ndemonstrative is at least arguably determined in part by the speaker's\nbeliefs and audience-directed intentions, whereas the reference of a\npure indexical is settled by objective, attitude-independent factors\nof the occasion of utterance, like who is speaking when and\nwhere. (There is a debate about whether or not speaker beliefs and\nintentions are relevant even to true demonstratives. See Bach 1992,\nBertolet 1993, and Reimer 1991a/b and 1992.)\n\n\nWe noted above that Perry assumed that the descriptive beliefs that\ndetermine the sense of a use of \u2018today\u2019 themselves are not\nindexical. Lifting this ban removes some of the sting from the\nirrelevancy of belief objection. For consider the agent's belief that\nshe would express by saying, \u2018\u2018Today is the day of this\nvery utterance.\u2019\u2019 While the purely qualitative descriptive\nconditions a speaker believes the day of her speech satisfies may be\nsatisfied by a different day, it is much less clear that the above\ndescriptive condition is satisfied by the wrong day. (It is also\nharder to imagine a nonproblematic case where the agent is confused\nabout whether or not the day referred to by her use of\n\u2018today\u2019 satisfies this description.) But there are at\nleast two problems with the Fregean appealing to such\ndescriptions. The first is that it is unclear that ordinary agents\nactually have such beliefs when they competently utter a sentence like\n(6). It is also questionable whether all speakers who competently use\n\u2018today\u2019 have the concepts of an utterance. If\nthey do not, then they are in a position to believe what is expressed\nby an utterance of \u2018Today is fine\u2019 without believing what\nis expressed by an utterance of \u2018The day of this utterance is\nfine\u2019, in which case, by Accept, the two\nsentence express different propositions. Second, even if they did, the\nsame question of the sense of the use of \u2018this\u2019 would\narise once again, with all of the problems Perry raises for the sense\nof (6). There is no room, in Frege's system, for irreducibly indexical\nthoughts, as Frege is clear that thoughts are true or false\nabsolutely, which an irreducibly indexical thought could not\nbe (just as the sentence \u2018I am happy\u2019 is not itself true\nor false absolutely). Insofar as the Fregean claims that truth is an\nabsolute property of thoughts, she must explicate the indexicality of\nlanguage and judgments using only nonindexical propositions or\nthoughts. (A proponent of a broadly Fregean view might claim that the\ntruth or falsity of a thought (and not just a sentence) is relative to\na sequence of parameters like a person, place, time, etc.. She could\nthen claim that the thought expressed by an utterance of (6) is itself\nirreducibly indexical and is only true or false relative to an\nassignment of parameters and in particular to a day.)\n\n\nPerry's second objection is the nonnecessity of belief\nobjection. This objection turns on the fact that a speaker can\nrefer to the time at which she is speaking with her use of\n\u2018today\u2019 even though she lacks any adequate purely\nqualitative conception of what day it is. Consider the case of Rip Van\nWinkle. \u201cWhen he awakes on October 20, 1823, and says with\nconviction \u2018Today is October 20, 1803,\u2019 the fact that he\nis sure he is right does not make him right, as it would if the\nthought expressed were determined by the sense he associated with\n\u2018today\u2019\u201d (1977, 12). (The case of Rip Van Winkle is\nvery rich. For further discussion, see Evans 1981/1985, Kaplan\n1977/1989 (538), and Perry 1997.) Van Winkle need not have a correct\nconception of the day of his utterance to be talking and thinking\nabout that day with his use of \u2018today\u2019. It suffices to\nsimply be located on that day and say, \u2018\u2018Today is\nfine,\u2019\u2019 knowing the general rule of how uses of\n\u2018today\u2019 function. A similar point can be made about\n\u2018I\u2019, using a case of a person suffering complete amnesia,\nwho intuitively still speaks of herself when she says, \u2018\u2018I\nam alive\u2019\u2019, despite lacking true beliefs of identifying\nbiographical information, and \u2018here\u2019, using a case of a\nperson who is completely confused about where she is. As was the case\nwith Perry's first objection, however, the nonnecessity of belief\nobjection is less persuasive with true demonstratives, where some kind\nof correct conception of the intended reference is arguably needed to\ndemonstrate it.\n\nIn his response to Perry, Gareth Evans (1981/1985) claimed that\nretaining indexical beliefs across changes in circumstance requires\nkeeping track of the objects those beliefs are about. So, for example,\nto believe the same thing today that I believed yesterday when I\nuttered (yesterday) the sentence \u2018Today is fine\u2019 requires\nmore than simply competently uttering today the sentence\n\u2018Yesterday was fine\u2019. I must in addition, Evans claimed,\nhave kept track of the day and so properly registered the change in\nday. This makes belief necessary for retention of indexical beliefs,\neven beliefs expressed by sentences with pure indexicals. As Van\nWinkle does not successfully track the twenty some years between his\nfalling asleep and waking up, he does not retain the temporally\nindexical beliefs he had the night he fell asleep. Evans is less\nclear, however, that a proper conception of the day is necessary for\nformation (as opposed to retention) of a temporally\nindexical belief, which is what Perry's second objection denies. Does\nVan Winkle not think a thought about 1823 when he awakes and thinks to\nhimself, \u2018Today is fine\u2019?) Furthermore, the tracking\ncondition has consequences that seem contrary to key tenets of\nFregeanism. Losing track of time isn't something that is always\ninternally accessible. Rip Van Winkle and his less well-known brother\nKip, both of whom went to sleep after a fine day in October 1803. Kip\nwoke up 10 hours later and, recalling the previous day, thought to\nhimself, \u2018Yesterday was fine\u2019; Rip slept an additional 20\nyears and woke with memories of what he took to be the previous day\nand thought to himself, \u2018Yesterday was fine\u2019, being\nunaware of the additional passage of time. Because \u201ceverything\nis all the same\u201d as far as Kip and Rip are concerned upon\nwaking, there is some pressure to say that their beliefs have the same\ncontent, assuming belief contents are intended to capture how the\nagent conceives the world, which is the motivation behind a principle\nlike Accept. (There is equally strong pressure to say\nthat they believe different things, as Kip's belief is true and Rip's\nfalse. But that is not generated from Accept but\nTruth and Perry's point is that, for important cases,\nthose principles pull in opposite directions.)\n\n\nPerry's third objection is the nonsufficiency of\nbelief. Consider the case of Hume and Heimson. Heimson believes\nthat he is Hume. But Heimson isn't just crazy, but also well informed\nabout every aspect of Hume's life. Still, Hume says something true\nwhen he utters the sentence \u2018I wrote the\nTreatise\u2019 and Heimson says something false. If so,\nthen, by Truth, they say different things, despite\nthe similarity in their qualitative descriptive beliefs. Even though\nHeimson's descriptive beliefs about who he is best fit Hume, still his\nself-thoughts are about Heimson and not Hume. The Fregean cannot,\nPerry claims, account for this.\n\n\nPerry assumed that Fregean thoughts are generally accessible, as they\nare entirely composed of logical operations and purely qualitative\nconditions. But then the thought Hume grasps when he thinks to himself\n\u2018\u2018I wrote the Treatise\u2019\u2019 is a thought\navailable for Heimson to grasp as well. (This assumption of general\naccessibility is at odds with what Frege says in his late work\n(1918/1956), where he claims that \u201ceveryone is presented to\nhimself in a particular and primitive way, in which he is presented to\nno-one else\u201d (298). In his discussion of Dr. Lauben, Frege\ndenies that all thoughts are generally accessible and that the thought\nDr. Lauben grasps when he thinks to himself, \u2018\u2018I am\ncold,\u2019\u2019 for example, is a thought that can be expressed by\nany sentence with a proper name. It is important to realize that this\nlimited accessibility thesis Frege held in later work is distinct from\nthe view alluded to above according to which a thought is irreducibly\nindexical. The former view is consistent with Dr. Lauben's thought\nbeing absolutely true or false, whereas the latter view is not. Frege\ndid not always hold this limited accessibility view, however. In an\nearlier, unpublished work intended as a logic textbook he writes:\nIn this case [the sentence \u2018I\nam cold\u2019] the mere words do not contain the entire sense; we\nhave in addition to take into account who utters it. There are many\ncases like this in which the spoken words have to be supplemented by\nthe speaker's gesture and expression, and the accompanying\ncircumstances. The word \u2018I\u2019 simply designates a different\nperson in the mouths of different people. It is not necessary that the\nperson who feels cold should give utterance to the thought that he\nfeels cold. Another person can do this by using a name to designate\nthe one who feels cold. (1914, 134\u20135)\n \n Frege here seems to be claiming that the thought you have when you\nsay to yourself, \u2018\u2018I am cold,\u2019\u2019 is a thought\nsomeone else can express by pointing at you and saying,\n\u2018\u2018S/he is cold,\u2019\u2019 which is exactly what he\ndenied in (1918/1956). Furthermore, although Frege only posits private\nsenses only for \u2018I\u2019, the worries that drove him to this\nview can be raised with other indexicals like \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018today\u2019, and \u2018now\u2019. It becomes less and less\nplausible to posit context-bound senses for each place, day, and\nmoment. In any event, the move to such perspective-bound thoughts has\nnot been generally accepted, even by followers of Frege.) \n\n\nAny generally accessible, absolutely true or false thought, Perry\nargued, will violate Accept. For suppose that there\nwere a purely qualitative descriptive condition F\nHume associated with his use of \u2018I\u2019 that gives its sense;\nsay, the condition expressed by the expression \u2018the philosopher\nwho argued against the rationality of induction\u2019. It would seem\nthat, insofar as Hume forgot (or never knew) that he himself is\nuniquely F but retained his ability to think of\nhimself with the expression \u2018I\u2019, it is possible for him to\ncompetently, reflectively, and sincerely accept the sentence \u2018I\nwrote the Treatise\u2019 while not accepting \u2018The\nF wrote the Treatise\u2019. No such purely\nqualitative, generally accessible proposition, Perry concluded, is\nequivalent in cognitive significance to Hume's thought that he himself\nwrote the Treatise. But Fregeanism entails that there is such\na thought. So Fregeanism is false.\n\n\nSo far we have focused on Perry's case against Fregean accounts of\nindexicals in thought and language. Let's move briefly to Perry's\npositive, anti-Fregean view of indexicality. Perry's views have gone\nthrough important and often drastic changes from his early views in\n(1977) and (1979) to his later views in his (2001), which we shall not try to\nsort out here, focusing primarily on the earlier view. A view broadly\nsimilar to Perry's early view is developed in Kaplan 1977/1989,\nwhere Kaplan distinguishes content and character, claiming that the\nlatter captures the cognitive significance of an expression and the\nformer is the bearer of truth value and the object of the\npropositional attitudes, often being a singular proposition. Perry\ninitially (1977) distinguished \u201cthoughts\u201d and\n\u201csenses,\u201d but later (1979) and (1980a/b) made the same\ndistinction in terms of belief contents and belief states. (Perry also\ninitially identified the \u201cthought\u201d associated with an\nexpression with its role, which is proven false by cases like the\nEnterprise case discussed above. If an expression's role is identified\nwith its linguistic meaning, then the two occurrences of\n\u2018this\u2019 surely have the same role. The two utterances of\n\u2018this\u2019 have distinct associated demonstrations, but\ndemonstrations are not part of linguistic meaning.) The core idea is\nthat an adequate account of indexicality in thought and language\ninvolves two distinct items, one that is roughly characterized by\nTruth and Attitude \u2014\npropositions \u2014 and the other that is roughly characterized by\nAccept and is intended to capture the\n\u201ccognitive significance\u201d of an expression and through\nwhich propositions are grasped. The former is, in the case of\nindexical beliefs, a singular proposition. This distinction, Perry\nclaimed, is the key to solving the problems with self-locating beliefs\nthat we have discussed above; it is the Fregean's identification of\nthe items that answer to Accept,\nTruth, and Attitude that leads to\nthe problems surveyed above.\n\n\nLet's apply the view to the case of Heimson. What, on Perry's view,\ndistinguishes Hume from Heimson? Both Hume and Heimson are in the same\nfirst-person belief state when they say to themselves,\n\u2018\u2018I wrote the Treatise.\u2019\u2019\nFurthermore, the belief content Hume has when he is in that belief\nstate \u2014 namely, the singular proposition [Hume wrote the\nTreatise] \u2014 is a belief content readily available for\nHeimson to entertain as well. However, only Hume can grasp that belief\ncontent by being in a first-person belief state. When Heimson is in a\nfirst-person belief state, he grasps the distinct singular proposition\n[Heimson wrote the Treatise] and when Heimson grasps the\nsingular proposition [Hume wrote the Treatise], it is only in\nvirtue of being in a third-person belief state. Perry is thus able to\naccount for the similarities between Heimson and Hume (they are in the\nsame belief state) and what is distinctive of Hume (only he grasps the\nsingular proposition [Hume wrote the Treatise] when in a\nfirst-person belief state).\n Belief states are important because they are involved in\nexplaining, predicting, and rationalizing behavior. Perry provided a\nhost of memorable cases that make this point. Here's one. Consider two\npeople who both utter to themselves the sentence \u2018I am being\nattacked by a bear\u2019. All other things being equal, both people\nwill act in similar ways. There is a common explanation of their\nbehaviors only in terms of their shared belief states, as they\napprehend distinct propositions, each believing a proposition about\nhimself. Furthermore, it is crucial to how our agents act that they\ngrasp the relevant singular proposition in a first-person way and not,\nsay, as one would if one saw one's own reflection in a mirror with the\nreflection of a bear sneaking up without realizing that the person\nbeing seen is oneself. So, explanation, prediction, and\nrationalization are all sensitive to belief states. To quote Perry on\nthis point:\n\n  [I]n virtue of being in a belief state in a certain environment, we\nbelieve a certain object. Because the same object can be believed in\ndifferent ways, from different environments or \u201cpoints of\nview,\u201d classifying people by objects believed is not always\nparticularly useful\u2026. Consider the sentence \u2018There is a\nhungry lion coming towards me\u2019. Now consider the contexts\nrelative to which this sentence is true. They all consist of persons\nand times such that the person is being approached by a hungry lion at\nthat time. It is a good idea for all of these people to run like crazy\n[presumably, at that time or at least shortly thereafter]. In a sense\nthey do not need to know what they believe. Even if they have\nforgotten who they are and lost track of time, they know enough to\nrun. (In another sense, they do know what they believe even then.)\nMost of these people will not believe the same thing. But each of them\nwill believe in something that provides them with good reason to\nrun. (1980a, 323)\n\nBut belief states are not contents; they are not true or false and\nthey are not what we express when we utter a sentence. We must thus\nalso recognize belief contents as distinct elements.
