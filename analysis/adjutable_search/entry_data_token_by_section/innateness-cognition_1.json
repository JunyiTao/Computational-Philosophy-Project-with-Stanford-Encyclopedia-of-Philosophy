    "main_text": "The Chomskyan Revolution in Linguistics || Exporting the Revolution: Problems and Prospects\n1.2 Exporting the Revolution: Problems and Prospects\n1.2.1 The problem of linguistic exceptionalism\n\n\nAlthough Chomskyan linguistics set the stage for a general Nativist\nrevival, it took a while for this train to leave the station, and it\nwill help to understand why. Part of the problem was that the\noriginal case for linguistic Nativism had been made, at least in part,\nby focusing on what looked to be unique features of language.\nLanguage has long been seen as exceptional; as the\ndistinguishing feature of human cognition. Chomsky championed\nthis view, and argued that language is central to a special kind of\nhuman creativity (Chomsky 1966).\n\n\nWe have already noted one facet of this exceptionalism: the fact\nthat grammars are very complex. But there are also unexpected\nsingularities in how children learn; in the learning process\nitself. Each child is exposed to an idiosyncratic sample of the\nlanguage (their primary linguistic data). Each sample is\ncompatible with any number of non-equivalent grammars that all generate\nthe pld sample so far, but give different verdicts about new\ncases not in the pld. We might therefore expect (i) that\nthe grammar a child acquires reflects the idiosyncrasies of the\npld the child was exposed to, (ii) that, as a consequence,\nchildren will disagree about what is and what is not grammatical, and\n(iii) that adults will therefore have to correct them to smooth out\nerrors that reflect those idiosyncrasies. But this, Chomsky\nargued, is not what we find (Chomsky 1965). Children learning a\nlanguage somehow converge on the same grammar, as evidenced by\ntheir agreement about well-formedness, and by the distinctive types of\nerrors they make and don\u2019t make in the course of\nlearning. If this is right, it suggests that the child must have\nprior information that somehow constrains or orders the hypothesis\nspace that steers the child to the right grammar, and it is hard to see\nhow this information can be acquired through experience.\nFurthermore, the pld contain ungrammatical and incomplete\nsentences, but children somehow filter out this noise, and do so\nwithout explicit instructions or feedback. There are a\nnumber of other striking features about language learning that Chomsky\ndrew attention to: (1) it is acquired rapidly, (2) the speed of\nacquisition does not correlate with intelligence, (3) it does not\nrequire reinforcement or extensive explicit training, and (4) it is\nacquired in a critical period\u2014a relatively fixed window\nin the maturation process\u2014during which other less complex systems\n(counting, for instance\u2014see below section 2.3) cannot be\nmastered. Each of these claims has prompted a long trail of\nexperimentation and theory construction, and all remain controversial\n(see, for example, the discussion in Menn et al. 2003). But\ntheir overall effect was to single out language learning as\nexceptional, and perhaps unique. Chomsky himself marked this\ndifference by speaking of language acquisition and contrasting\nit with learning, a term he reserved for induction-based\nprocesses.\n\n\nSo on Chomsky\u2019s view, language is doubly exceptional. It\nis the distinctive human cognitive trait, and is essentially\ndifferent from all known animal communication systems. The fact\nthat we have it makes us exceptional as a\n species.[8]\nIt is also exceptional in that\nthe pattern of its acquisition suggests that it stands apart from all\nthat we learn about the world; it simply grows in us. Taken\ntogether, these considerations supported a Nativist account of language\nlearning, but tended to discourage the idea of\nexporting the Nativist revolution beyond language. After\nall, how much of the rest of the child\u2019s untutored knowledge of\nthe world is as complex as grammars reveal human languages to be?\nAnd how much of that knowledge comes to the child as effortlessly and\nwithout explicit instruction?\n1.2.2 The expanding prospect(s)\n\n\nIn time, the arguments for linguistic exceptionalism gave way to a\nbroader view of the Nativist project. Chomsky (1975) set out a\nfully general schema for Poverty of the Stimulus arguments that did\nnot depend on the distinctive features of grammars and\nlanguage acquisition, which had been featured in making the original\nNativist case. Chomsky began to speak of language as one of\npossibly many mental organs that grow in the\nindividual. This naturalistic biological model embeds Nativism\nabout mental organs into a wider and uncontroversial biological\nNativism. It is uncontroversial that kidneys do not develop as a\nresponse to the environment, and they certainly do not copy the\nenvironment. The human body is organized in such a way that in\nnormal (fetal) environments, kidneys will form. This point could\nnow be deployed against the Empiricist. To presume that the basic\nfeatures of our physical-biological nature are\ninternally pre-determined, but that our\nmental-psychological nature is not, but is wholly\nexternally determined, is to introduce a dualism that requires\na special defense. But Empiricism seems to make just this\npresumption, and offers no credible defense. So the tables are\nturned. The Nativist has been freed from the earlier\nsupernaturalism charge, the simplicity-card of Empiricist models turns\nout to be spurious, and now the Empiricist seems to be the one carrying\nan unmotivated dualism as excess\n baggage.[9]\n\n\nThe mental organs approach has proven to be extremely influential in\nboth philosophy and the cognitive sciences. In its most general\nform, it has displaced the idea of information in the mind as (for the\nmost part) a single uniform set of sentences or data points, and put in\nits place an alternative architecture of systems and subsystems of\nknowledge and information, each, possibly, having its own design,\npattern of representations, specialized function, pattern of\nactivation, level of integration with other systems, (sometimes)\nspecific locus in the brain, and so on. We mention here a number\nof developments significant to the Nativist side that that have grown\nout of this central theme.\n\nThe modularity of mind hypothesis. Fodor (1983) proposed a\nview of our overall cognitive architecture that rested on a rough\ndistinction between input systems, or relatively rigid computational\n\u201cmodules\u201d that are designed to pick up specific types of\ninformation, and more flexible central processors that integrate that\ninformation in various ways. Each of these modules has a specific\ntask-orientation, and does its work independently of much of what is\ngoing on in the rest of the system. So, for instance, we more-or-less\nautomatically hear sound patterns as sentences of our native language,\nperceive patterns of light and shadow as configurations of objects in\nspace, and so on. In these terms, the language organ is just one\nof a set of freestanding mental modules. Fodor suggested a\nchecklist of properties that such modules could be expected to have,\nand among them is that they are innately\n determined.[10]\nThe architectural claim about modular\norganization does not in itself imply an innate basis, but the\nhypothesis that the sorts of response patterns to linguistic and visual\ninput (like those just mentioned) have a strong innate basis is\nplausible and has been experimentally pursued. Fodor\u2019s\nversion of the view is now termed a moderate modularity\nthesis, because he holds that much of the business of cognition\ninvolves \u2018central\u2019 processing that is decidedly\nnon-modular. Modules do the work of \u2018presenting the\nworld\u2019 to highly integrated non-modular global psychological\nprocesses. But others, like Carruthers (2006), have argued that\nwith some adjustment to Fodor\u2019s original characterization of\nmodules, we can argue for massive modularity.\n\nEvolutionary Psychology. One of the controversial\narguments used to defend massive modularity claims is that evolution\nfavors this sort of architecture. This brings us to the central\ndoctrine of Evolutionary Psychology\u2014i.e., that cognition is best\nunderstood as a \u2018Swiss army knife\u2019 of special purpose\npsychological-computational mechanisms that evolved to enhance the\nsurvival of our\n ancestors.[11]\nOne much-discussed example of such a\nmechanism is a \u2018cheater detection\u2019 module. Our\nancestors needed to distinguish fair-traders from freeloaders.\nThose who could be consistently taken advantage of in exchanges were at\na significant disadvantage in terms of survival. At some point, a\nmechanism evolved\u2014a computational program in the brain, a mental\norgan (or mini-organ?)\u2014that made such vigilance and\nrecord-keeping second nature, and we now all have this module as part\nof our innate endowment. It\u2019s been argued\u2014but the\nclaim continues to be controversial\u2014that the operation of this\nmodule explains the (purported) fact that although we fall prey to a\nclass of reasoning mistakes, we do not make as many of these errors\nwhen our reasoning is related to cheater-detection. For\nEvolutionary Psychologists, the mind is a collection of evolved\nsub-systems adapted to the environments of our Pleistocene ancestors,\nnot to our own\n environment.[12]\nEvolutionary Psychology is arguably the most\nradical Nativist-inspired paradigm, because it looks to make the range\nof the Empiricist\u2019s general purpose learning mechanism smaller\nand smaller.\n\n\nTo keep the players straight, we must note that Chomsky himself has\nhad a very complicated relationship with evolutionary explanations of\nmind and\n cognition.[13]\nHe\nis certainly not a friend of Evolutionary Psychology, and has joined\nwith its critics in questioning its adaptationist\n perspective.[14]\n\nCognitive Ethology. The modularist position, and the\nNativism that fits it so well, have been supported by recent work on\nanimal cognition, especially the discovery of very sophisticated\ninformation-rich sub-systems in the animal brain (see Andrews 2010 for\na philosophy-oriented review). Early discoveries about complex\nanimal behavior\u2014like Von Frisch\u2019s work on the dance of the\nbees (Frisch 1971)\u2014remained in the shadows during the heyday of\nBehaviorism, but more and more such systems have come to light since\nthen. Just to take navigation as an example, desert ants have an\ninnate dead reckoning module for navigation, and various birds species\nhave intricate innately-based systems based on the fixed stars,\nmagnetic fields, the azimuth angle of the Sun, and so\n on.[15]\nAll these cognitive\nmodules/mechanisms are innately specified subsystems, and add\nplausibility to the Nativist theme that nature has built human beings\nin the same way.\n\n\nWe have explained the ways in which Chomsky\u2019s work in\nlinguistics inspired subsequent Nativist thinking in the cognitive\nsciences. But there is an irony here in that, except for the very\ngeneral Poverty of the Stimulus schema (which can be traced back to\nPlato), linguistics and language acquisition have not served as\neasy-to-use templates or paradigms for developing Nativist hypotheses\nin other domains. We so far have no reason to think that there is\nany domain outside language that requires anything as complex as a\ngrammar of a natural language to represent it. So linguistic\ncompetence remains an exceptional element in our\ncognitive\n make-up.[16]\nAnd even\nthough some of the distinctive features of language acquisition have\ncounterparts in other domains\u2014sensitive and critical periods in\nthe development of visual perception, for example\u2014there does seem\nto be something exceptional about the way virtually every normal child\ncomes to master a language. We might say that for Nativists,\nlanguage has been more an inspiration than a working model. But\nat the same time, as Nativists move beyond language, they may avoid\nmany of the methodological challenges to the Chomskyan approach\n(including: is a grammar a theory of competence, in what sense are\ngrammars \u2018mentally represented\u2019, is the pld all\nthat\u2019s relevant to acquisition, etc).\n",
