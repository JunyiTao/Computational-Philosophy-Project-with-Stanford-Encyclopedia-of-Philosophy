    "main_text": "Does altruism exist? || Hunger and desire\n2.4 Hunger and desire\n\nBut the assumption that all desires are like hunger in the relevant\nrespect is open to question. Hunger is not satisfied if one still\nfeels hungry after one has eaten. It seeks a certain kind of\nconsciousness in oneself. But many kinds of desires are not like that.\nSuppose, for example, that I want my young children to be prosperous\nas adults long after I have died, and I take steps that increase to\nsome small degree their chances of achieving that distant goal. What\nmy desire is for is their prosperity far into the future, not my\ncurrent or future feeling of satisfaction. I don\u2019t know and\ncannot know whether the steps that I take will actually bring about\nthe goal I seek; what I do know is that I will not be alive when they\nare adults, and so even if they are prosperous, that will give me no\npleasure. (Since, by hypothesis I can only hope, and do not feel\nconfident, that the provisions I make for them will actually produce\nthe good results I seek for them, I get little current satisfaction\nfrom my act.) It would make no sense, therefore, to suggest that I do\nnot want them to be prosperous for their sake, but only as a means to\nthe achievement of some goal of my own. My goal is their well-being,\nnot my own. In fact, if I allocate to them resources that I myself\nneed, in the hope that doing so will make their lives better, I am\ndoing something that one form of psychological egoism says is\nimpossible: sacrificing my own good, to some degree, for the sake of\nothers. If the psychological egoist claims that such self-sacrifice is\nimpossible because all desire is like hunger, the reply should be that\nthis model does not fit all cases of desire.\n\nRecall the two premises used by the armchair psychological egoist: (i)\nWhat motivates us to act is always a desire; (ii) all desires are to\nbe understood on the model of hunger. The second premise is\nimplausible, as we have just seen; and, since both premises must be\ntrue for the argument to reach its conclusion, the argument can be\nrejected. \n",
