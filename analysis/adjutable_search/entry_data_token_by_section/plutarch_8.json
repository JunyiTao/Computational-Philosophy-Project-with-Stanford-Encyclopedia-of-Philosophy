Poetics and Educational theory\n\n\nGiven Plutarch's concern for the education of character and of the\ncity as a whole, it is hardly surprising that he wrote works on\neducation (On the Education of Children, De liberis\neducandis, which is considered spurious, however, by Ziegler\n1951, 809\u2013812) and especially on the effect that poetry has on\nthe education of one's character. His most important work in this\nfield is On How the Young Man Should Listen to Poets\n(Quomodo adolscens poetas audire debeat; De aud. poet.),\nwhile he also wrote a treatise on Homer (De Homero) that is\nno loner extant. In the former work Plutarch deals with the question\nof how young people should read and understand poetry, since poetry\ncan be both beneficial and harmful, depending on its\ninterpretation. Following the Republic, Plutarch argues that\npoetry is a mimetic art; it imitates the character and lives of\nvarious people, good and bad alike (De aud. poet. 17E-F,\n26A). In the course of this, Plutarch claims, poets tell lies and\npresent obscene stories and images (ibid. 16A). Plutarch selects\nexamples of such poetic habits mainly from the Republic,\nfocusing on stories from Homer in particular. Plutarch does not\ncondemn poetry altogether; he rather finds a convenient middle\nsolution. He tries to show how one should read the poets in the most\nbeneficial way. In order to do so, Plutarch argues, first one should\navoid reading the deliberate lies made in poetry, which can\nunnecessarily upset one (ibid. 17B; see Russell 1989, 303). Second,\nPlutarch recommends that the reader, especially the young one, should\nlearn how to read poetry allegorically, in such a way that this can\nhave a beneficial effect on one's character (ibid.  19E-20B; see Lamberton\n2001, 48-50). This is the approach that Plutarch himself applies to\nthe myth of Isis and Osiris in his work with that title. Plutarch\nillustrates the search for the correct (morally uplifting) meaning of\na poetic saying also in parts of the Table Talks\n(Quaestiones Conviviales 622C, 673C; see Russell 1989, 305). The\nyoung man needs to learn the skill of how to recover and isolate the\nbeneficial elements of poetry and absorb them alone. In that way\npoetry can guide one to virtue (ibid. 28E-F). Plutarch likens properly\neducated young men in their attitude towards poetry to the way bees\nselect the best from flowers (32E), a simile adopted by the\nChristians, Basil (To young men on the right use of\nliterature 4.7\u20138), and Gregory of Nazianzus\n(Orationes 43.13.1). Such a use of poetry, Plutarch claims,\nprepares youths for their education in philosophy (De\naud. poet. 15F, 37B). This happens in two ways.  First, poetry\ncan guide youths towards philosophy by familiarizing them with the\nconcepts that philosophers also use; second, poetry, as we have seen,\nwhen properly used, can guide to virtue, and this, Plutarch argues, is\na requirement for philosophical education (De aud.\npoet. 36D-37B). Plutarch actually maintains that the best of\npoetry is nothing other than philosophy in disguise (ibid. 15F), and\nthroughout his work he tries to illustrate precisely this through a\nselection of verses from the most well known ancient poets. In On\nMaking Progress in Virtue (79B-D) Plutarch goes so far as to\ntreat poetry and history as complementary to philosophy in educating\none's character. Regarding the educative role of poetry, Plutarch\nappears to be influenced by the Stoics, who were using poetry in\neducation, but he goes further than they in devising specific\nstrategies meant to turn young men into good readers of poetry (see\nBlank 2011).\n\nFrom this point of view, one may relate Plutarch's Lives to\nhis philosophical works (see Gill 2006, 421\u2013424). Plutarch\nhimself says he wrote the Lives for the improvement of\nothers, assuming that the actions of virtue will instigate emulation\nin the reader (Pericles 1\u20132; see Russell 1973,\n100\u2013101). Perhaps, then, the Lives also aim to train\nthe reader's character, and in such a way to prepare them for the life\nof philosophy. If this is the case, then the Lives are\ncomplementary with Plutarch's ethical works of practical orientation\nthat I discuss in the previous section.\n",
