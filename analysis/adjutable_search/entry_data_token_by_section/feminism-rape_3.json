    "main_text": "Criteria: What Counts? || Mens rea\n2.2 Mens rea\n\nA further complicating question is whether the criminal law\u2019s\nusual requirement of mens rea (or \u201cguilty mind\u201d)\nshould apply to rape and, if so, how that requirement should be\ninterpreted. In the most general terms, a mens rea\nrequirement means that the prosecution must show not only that\nnonconsensual sex occurred, but also that the man was in a certain\nstate of mind with regard to the woman\u2019s lack of consent. Just\nwhat that state of mind is\u2014what counts as mens rea in\ncases of rape\u2014is a matter of some dispute (Burgess-Jackson 1996,\n137\u2013161).\n\nThe most conservative position\u2014defended most famously in the\n1976 DPP v Morgan decision (Baron 2001,\n9\u201314)\u2014holds that a man has mens rea only if he\nbelieves the woman is not consenting (or that she is at least probably\nnot consenting). On this view, a man who sincerely believes that the\nwoman is consenting is not guilty of rape, no matter how unreasonable\nhis belief may be under the circumstances. A more moderate view is\nthat a man has mens rea if he either believes the woman is\nnot consenting or believes unreasonably that she is consenting. Thus,\nin jurisdictions where this understanding of mens rea is in\nforce, the question of whether the woman actually consented often\ngives way\u2014particularly in cases of date and acquaintance\nrape\u2014to the question of whether the man reasonably believed she\nconsented.\n\nTheorists have different views about the conditions under which it is\nreasonable for a man to believe that a woman is consenting to sexual\nintercourse. Husak and Thomas (1992) argue that there are social and\nbehavioral conventions (or \u201ccourtship rituals\u201d) by which\nwomen manifest their willingness to have sex, and that where a woman\nhas engaged in such conventions, it is reasonable for a man to believe\nshe is consenting to sexual intercourse. Archard (1997) argues\nforcefully against this view, however, pointing out that any such\nconventions are likely to be ambiguous and not universally understood\n(particularly since research shows that men routinely interpret\nwomen\u2019s behavior in more sexual terms than women mean or\nintend), that a man risks doing serious harm by relying on his beliefs\nabout such conventions, and that there is a ready alternative to\nrisking such harm, namely, inquiring explicitly as to his\npartner\u2019s consent or lack thereof.\n\nOne influential interpretation of \u201creasonable belief\u201d in\nsexual consent is that of Lois Pineau (1989), who points out that\njudgments of reasonableness in this area must be based on some\nnormative conception of healthy, normal sexual interaction. The\nprevailing conception, which she calls the\n\u201caggressive-contractual model,\u201d holds that women\u2019s\nsexually provocative behavior generates enforceable agreements to have\nsex, that male sexuality is uncontrollable past a certain point, and\nthat women are not to be trusted in matters of sexuality. Pineau\nbelieves that this model is the backdrop against which many people\nbase their judgments about reasonable belief in rape cases. The\naggressive-contractual model should be replaced, she argues, with a\nmodel of \u201ccommunicative sexuality,\u201d one that emphasizes\n\u201can atmosphere of comfort and communication, a minimum of\npressure, and an on-going checkup on one\u2019s partner\u2019s\nstate\u201d (1989, 231). Communicative sexuality is most likely to be\nrewarding for both parties, allows them to promote each other\u2019s\nsensual ends non-manipulatively and non-paternalistically, and\nobserves norms appropriate to friendship and trust. Because it is\nthrough communication that one gains knowledge of one\u2019s\npartner\u2019s desires or lack thereof, Pineau contends that\n\u201cwhere communicative sexuality does not occur, we lack the main\nground for believing that the sex involved was consensual.\u201d She\ncontinues:\n\nwhere a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, he acts either\nout of reckless disregard, or out of willful ignorance. For he cannot\nknow, except through the practice of communicative sexuality, whether\nhis partner has any sexual reason for continuing the encounter. And\nwhere she does not, he runs the risk of imposing on her what she is\nnot willing to have. All that is needed, then, in order to provide\nwomen with legal protection from date rape is to make both reckless\nindifference and willful ignorance a sufficient condition of mens\nrea, and to make communicative sexuality the accepted norm of sex\nto which a reasonable woman would agree. (239\u201340)\n\n\nIn short, if a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, then he\ndoes not really know whether his partner is consenting; thus, if he\nnonetheless believes that she is consenting, then that belief is\nunreasonable.\n\nFinally, some feminists have argued that rape should be a strict\nliability offense, that is, one with no mens rea requirement\nat all. According to MacKinnon, a mens rea requirement means\nthat \u201cthe man\u2019s perceptions of the woman\u2019s desires\ndetermine whether she is deemed violated,\u201d and this approach is\nproblematic because \u201cmen are systematically conditioned not even\nto notice what women want\u201d (1989, 180\u201381). Adopting a\n\u201creasonable belief\u201d standard does not help, in her view,\nbecause the standard for \u201creasonableness\u201d masquerades as\nobjectivity while almost inevitably relying on patriarchal and\npornographic assumptions; thus \u201cmeasuring consent from the\nsocially reasonable, meaning objective man\u2019s, point of view\nreproduces the same problem under a more elevated label\u201d\n(181).\n\nHere MacKinnon speaks to a broader debate in feminist legal theory, in\nwhich some feminists have argued for the adoption of a\n\u201creasonable woman standard\u201d in matters ranging from sexual\nharassment to stalking, battering, and rape. Proponents of this\napproach believe that a gender-neutral standard of reasonableness is\nimpossible given the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nsocial positioning. They point out, for instance, that men have\ngreater social and (in most cases) physical power than women and,\nrelatedly, that women\u2019s beliefs and reactions are shaped by the\nconstant threat of male violence with which women live (Kerns 2001).\nBecause of these differences, women and men often have divergent\nperceptions of interpersonal behavior (Scheppele 1991, 45): for\ninstance, behavior that men see as merely flirtatious may be\nexperienced by women as offensive or even threatening, and women may\nsee advances as physically intimidating that men see as aggressively\namorous. Proponents thus contend, in the words of Hubin and Haely (who\nreject this approach), that \u201cwhen we seek to determine whether\nthe actions and words of the victim constitute or indicate consent to\nsexual intercourse \u2013 it is the standard of the reasonable\nwoman we must employ\u201d (1999, 119). Thus, for example,\nin assessing the reasonableness of an alleged victim\u2018s judgment\nthat it would be dangerous to resist a particular sexual advance, a\njury would ask whether a reasonable woman in that situation\nwould so judge. Opponents of the reasonable woman standard contend\nthat it is both possible and desirable to account for common\ndifferences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s physiologies, social\nexperiences, and perceptions without importing gender into the\ndefinition of reasonableness itself. For instance, while granting that\na reasonable person standard should often yield different conclusions\nfor men than for women, Hubin and Haely contend that \u201cthis is\nnot because the reasonable person standard fails to present a single\n(gender neutral) standard, but because the standard we are employing\nis sensitive to features of the agent and the situation that are\ncorrelated with gender\u201d (1999, 133).\n",
