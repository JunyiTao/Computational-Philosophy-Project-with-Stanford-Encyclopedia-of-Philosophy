    "main_text": "Sequential decisions || The EU axioms revisited\n7. Concluding remarks\n\nLet us conclude by summarising the main reasons why decision theory,\nas described above, is of philosophical interest. First, normative\ndecision theory is clearly a (minimal) theory of practical\nrationality. The aim is to characterise the attitudes of agents who\nare practically rational, and various (static and sequential)\narguments are typically made to show that certain practical\ncatastrophes befall agents who do not satisfy standard\ndecision-theoretic constraints. Second, many of these constraints\nconcern the agents\u2019 beliefs. In particular, normative\ndecision theory requires that agents\u2019 degrees of beliefs satisfy\nthe probability axioms and that they respond to new information by\nconditionalisation. Therefore, decision theory has great implications\nfor debates in epistemology and philosophy of science; that is, for\ntheories of epistemic rationality.\n\nFinally, decision theory should be of great interest to philosophers\nof mind and psychology, and others who are interested in how people\ncan understand the behaviour and intentions of others; and, more\ngenerally, how we can interpret what goes on in other people\u2019s\nminds. Decision theorists typically assume that a person\u2019s\nbehaviour can be fully explained in terms of her beliefs and desires.\nBut perhaps more interestingly, some of the most important results of\ndecision theory\u2014the various representation theorems, some of\nwhich have discussed here\u2014suggest that if a person satisfies\ncertain rationality requirements, then we can read her beliefs and\ndesires, and how strong these beliefs and desires are, from her choice\ndispositions (or preferences). How much these theorems really tell us\nis a matter of debate, as discussed above. But on an optimistic\nreading of these results, they assure us that we can meaningfully talk\nabout what goes on in other people\u2019s minds without much evidence\nbeyond information about their dispositions to choose.\n",
