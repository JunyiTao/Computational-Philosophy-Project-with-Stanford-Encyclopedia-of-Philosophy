They\nare merely a slight modification of existing models of belief for\nsituations of ambiguity. Often your credences will be precise enough,\nand your available actions will be such that you act more or\nless as if you were a strict Bayesian. One might analogize imprecise\nprobabilities as the \u201cTheory of Relativity\u201d to the strict\nBayesian \u201cNewtonian Mechanics\u201d: all but indistinguishable\nin all but the most extreme situations. This analogy goes deeper: in\nboth cases, the theories are \u201cempirically\nindistinguishable\u201d in normal circumstances, but they both differ\nradically in some conceptual respects. Namely, the role of absolute\nspace in Newtonian mechanics/GR; how to model ignorance in the\nstrict/imprecise probabilist case. Howson\n(2012) makes a similar analogy between modelling belief and\nmodels in science. Both involve some requirement to be somewhat\nfaithful to the target system, but in each case faithfulness must be\nweighed up against various theoretical virtues like simplicity,\ncomputational tractability and so\non. Likewise Hosni (2014) argues that\nwhat model of belief is appropriate is somewhat dependent on\ncontext. There is of course an important disanalogy in that models of\nbelief are supposed to be normative as well as descriptive,\nwhereas models in science typically only have to play a descriptive\nrole. Walley (1991) discusses a similar\nview but is generally sceptical of such an interpretation.\n3.4.1 What is a belief?\nOne standard interpretation of the probability calculus is that\nprobabilities represent \u201cdegrees of belief\u201d or\n\u201ccredences\u201d. This is more or less the concept that under\nconsideration so far. But what is a degree of belief? There are a\nnumber of ways of cashing out what it is that a representation of\ndegree of belief is actually representing.\nOne of the most straightforward understandings of degree of belief\nis that credences are interpreted in terms of an agent\u2019s limiting\nwillingness to bet. This is an idea which goes back\nto Ramsey (1926)\nand de Finetti (1964, 1990 [1974]). The\nidea is that your credence in \\(X\\)\nis \\(\\alpha\\) just in\ncase \\(\\alpha\\) is the value at which you are\nindifferent between the gambles:\n\nWin \\(1-\\alpha\\) if \\(X\\), lose \\(\\alpha\\) otherwise\nLose \\(1- \\alpha \\) if \\(X\\), win \\(\\alpha\\) otherwise\n\nThis is the \u201cbetting interpretation\u201d. This is the\ninterpretation behind Dutch book arguments: this interpretation of\nbelief makes the link between betting quotients and belief strong\nenough to sanction the Dutch book theorem\u2019s claim\nthat beliefs must be probabilistic. Williamson in fact takes\nissue with IP because IP cannot be given this betting\ninterpretation (2010: 68\u201372). He\nargues that Smith\u2019s and Walley\u2019s contributions notwithstanding\n(see formal appendix), the\nsingle-value betting interpretation makes sense as a standard for\ncredence in a way that the one-sided betting interpretation\ndoesn\u2019t. The idea is that you may refuse all bets unless they are at\nextremely favourable odds by your lights. Such behaviour doesn\u2019t speak\nto your credences. However, if you were to offer a single\nvalue then this tells us something about your epistemic\nstate. There is something to this idea, but it must be traded off\nagainst the worry that forcing agents to have such single\nnumbers systematically misrepresents their epistemic states. As Kaplan\nputs it\n\nThe mere fact that you nominate \\(0.8\\)\nunder the compulsion to choose some determinate value for\n[\\(p(X)\\)] hardly means that you have\na reason to choose \\(0.8\\). The\northodox Bayesian is, in short, guilty of advocating false\nprecision. (Kaplan 1983: 569, Kaplan\u2019s\nemphasis)\n\nA related interpretation of credence is to understand credence as\nbeing just a representation of an agent\u2019s dispositions to act. This\ninterpretation sees credence as that function such that your elicited\npreferences and observed actions can be represented as those of an\nexpected utility maximiser with respect to that probability\nfunction (Briggs 2014: section 2.2). Your\ncredences just are that function that represents you as a\nrational agent. For precise probabilism, \u201crational agent\u201d\nmeans \u201cexpected utility maximiser\u201d. For imprecise\nprobabilism, rational agent must mean something slightly different. A\nslightly more sophisticated version of this sort of idea is to\nunderstand credence to be exactly that component of the preference\nstructure that the probability function represents in the\nrepresentation theorem. Recall the discussion of incompleteness\n(section 2.2). IP represents you as the agent\nconflicted between all the \\(p \\in P\\) such\nthat unless the \\(p\\) agree\nthat \\(X\\) is better\nthan \\(Y\\) or vice versa, you find them\nincomparable. What a representation theorem actually proves is a\nmatter of some dispute (see Zynda 2000; H\u00e1jek\n2008; Meacham and Weisberg 2011).\nOne might take the view that credence is modelling some kind of\nmental or psychological quantity in the head. Strength of belief is a\nreal psychological quantity and it is this that credence should\nmeasure. Unlike the above views, this interpretation of credence isn\u2019t\neasy to operationalise. It also seems like this understanding of\nstrength of belief distances credence from its role in understanding\ndecision making. The above behaviourist views take belief\u2019s\nrole in decision making to be central to or even definitional of what\nbelief is. This psychological interpretation seems to divorce belief\nfrom decision. Whether there are such stable neurological structures\nis also a matter of some controversy (Fumagalli\n2013; Smithson and Pushkarskaya 2015).\nA compromise between the behaviourist views and the psychological\nviews is to say that belief is characterised in part by its\nrole in decision making. This leaves room for belief to play an\nimportant role in other things, like assertion or reasoning and\ninference. So the answer to the question \u201cWhat is degree of\nbelief?\u201d is: \u201cDegree of belief is whatever psychological\nfactors play the role imputed to belief in decision making contexts,\nassertion behaviour, reasoning and inference\u201d. There is room in\nthis characterisation to understand credence as measuring some sort of\npsychological quantity that causally relates to action, assertion and\nso on. This is a sort of functionalist reading of what belief\nis. Eriksson and H\u00e1jek (2007) argue that\n\u201cdegree of belief\u201d should just be taken as a primitive\nconcept in epistemology. The above attempts to characterise degree of\nbelief then fill in the picture of the role degree of belief\nplays.\n3.4.2 What is a belief in \\(X\\)?\nSo now we have a better idea of what it is that a model of belief\nshould do. But which part of our model of belief is representing which\npart of the belief state? The first thing to say is\nthat \\(P(X)\\) is not an adequate\nrepresentation of the belief in \\(X\\). That\nis, one of the values of the credal set approach is that it can\ncapture certain kinds of non-logical relationships between\npropositions that are lost when focusing on, say, the associated set\nof probability values. For example, consider tossing a coin of unknown\nbias. \\(P(H)=P(T)=[0,1]\\), but this fails to\nrepresent the important fact\nthat \\(p(H)=1-p(T)\\) for\nall \\(p\\in P\\). Or that getting a heads on the\nfirst toss is at least as likely as heads on two consecutive\ntosses. These facts that aren\u2019t captured by the sets-of-values view\ncan play an important role in reasoning and decision.\n\\(P(X)\\) might be a good enough\nrepresentation of belief for some purposes. For example in the\nEllsberg game these sets of probability values (and their associated\nsets of expectations) are enough to rationalise the non-probabilistic\npreferences. How good the representation needs to be depends on what\nit will be used for. Representing the sun as a point mass is a good\nenough representation for basic orbital calculations, but obviously\ninadequate if you are studying coronal mass ejections, solar flares or\nother phenomena that depend on details of the internal dynamics of the\nsun.\n3.5 Regress\nImprecise probabilities is a theory born of our limitations as\nreasoning agents, and of limitations in our evidence base. If only we\nhad better evidence, a single probability function would do. But since\nour evidence is weak, we must use a set. In a way, the same is true of\nprecise probabilism. If only we knew the truth, we could represent\nbelief with a truth-valuation function, or just a set of sentences\nthat are fully believed. But since there are truths we don\u2019t know, we\nmust use a probability to represent our intermediate confidence. And\nindeed, the same problem arises for the imprecise probabilist. Is it\nreasonable to assume that we know what set of probabilities best\nrepresents the evidence? Perhaps we should have a set of sets of\nprobabilities\u2026 Similar problems arise for theories of\nvagueness (Sorensen 2012). We objected\nto precise values for degrees of belief, so why be content with\nsets-valued beliefs with precise boundaries? This is the problem of\n\u201chigher-order vagueness\u201d recast as a problem for imprecise\nprobabilism. Why is sets of probabilities the right level to stop the\nregress at? Why not sets of sets? Why not second-order probabilities?\nWhy not single probability\nfunctions? Williamson (2014)\nmakes this point, and argues that a single precise probability is the\ncorrect level at which to get off the \u201cuncertainty\nescalator\u201d. Williamson advocates the betting interpretation of\nbelief, and his argument here presupposes that interpretation. But the\npoint is still worth addressing: for a particular interpretation of\nwhat belief is, what sort of level of uncertainty is appropriate. For\nthe functionalist interpretation suggested above, this is\nsomething of a pragmatic choice. The further we allow this regress to\ncontinue, the harder it is to deal with these belief-representing\nobjects. So let\u2019s not go further than we need.\nWe have seen arguments above that IP does have some advantage over\nprecise probabilism, in the capacity to represent suspending\njudgement, the difference between weight and balance of evidence and\nso on. So we must go at least this far up the uncertainty\nescalator. But for the sake of practicality we need not go any\nfurther, even though there are hierarchical Bayes models that would\ngive us a well-defined theory of higher-order models of belief. This\nis, ultimately, a pragmatic argument. Actual human belief states are\nprobably immensely complicated neurological patterns with all the\nattendant complexity, interactivity, reflexivity and vagueness. We\nare modelling belief, so it is about choosing a model at the\nright level of complexity. If you are working out the trajectory of a\ncannonball on earth, you can safely ignore the gravitational influence\nof the moon on the cannonball. Likewise, there will be contexts where\nsimple models of belief are appropriate: perhaps your belief state is\njust a set of sentences of a language, or perhaps just a single\nprobability function. If, however, you are modelling the tides, then\nthe gravitational influence of the moon needs to be involved: the\nmodel needs to be more complex. This suggests that an adequate model of\nbelief under severe uncertainty may need to move beyond the single\nprobability paradigm. But a pragmatic argument says that we should\nonly move as far as we need to. So while you need to model the moon to\nget the tides right, you can get away without having Venus in your\nmodel. This relates to the contextual nature of appropriateness for\nmodels of belief mentioned earlier. If one were attempting to\nprovide a complete formal characterisation of the ontology of\nbelief, then these regress worries would be significantly harder to\navoid.\nLet\u2019s imagine that we had a second order\nprobability \\(\\mu\\) defined over the set of\n(first order) probabilities \\(P\\). We could\nthen reduce uncertainty to a single function\nby \\(p^*(X) = \\sum_P \\mu(p)p(X)\\)\n(if \\(P\\) is finite, in the interests of\nkeeping things simple I discuss only this case). Now\nif \\(p^*(X)\\) is what is used in decision\nmaking, then there is no real sense in which we have a genuine IP\nmodel, and it cannot rationalise the Ellsberg choice, nor can it give\nrise to incomparability. If there is some alternative use\nthat \\(\\mu\\) is put to, a use that allows\nincomparability and that rationalises Ellsberg choices, then it might\nbe a genuine rival to credal sets, but it represents just as much of a\ndeparture from the orthodox theory as IP does.\nG\u00e4rdenfors and Sahlin\u2019s Unreliable Probabilities model\nenriches a basic IP approach with a \u201creliability index\u201d\n(see the\n historical appendix).\n Lyon (2017)\nenriches the standard IP picture in a different way: he adds a\nprivileged \u201cbest guess\u201d probability. This modification\nallows for better aggregation of elicited IP estimates. How best to\ninterpret such a model is still an open question. Other enriched IP\nmodels are no doubt available.\n3.6 What makes a good imprecise belief?\nThere are, as we have seen, certain structural properties that are\nnecessary conditions on rational belief. What exactly these are\ndepends on your views. However, there are further ways of assessing\nbelief. Strongly believing true things and strongly believing the\nnegations of false things seem like good-making-features of\nbeliefs. For the case of precise credences, we can make this\nprecise. There is a large literature on \u201cscoring rules\u201d:\nmethods for measuring how good a probability is relative to the actual\nstate of the world (Brier 1950; Savage 1971;\nJoyce 2009; Pettigrew 2011). These are numerical methods of\nmeasuring how good a probability is given the true state of the\nworld.\nFor the case of imprecise probabilities, however, the situation\nlooks bleak. No real valued scoring rule for imprecise probabilities\ncan have the desirable property of being strictly\nproper (Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane\n2012). Schoenfield (2017) presents a simple version of the result. Since strict propriety is a desirable property of a\nscoring rule (Br\u00f6cker and Smith 2007; Joyce\n2009; Pettigrew 2011), this failing is serious. So further work\nis needed to develop a well-grounded theory of how to assess imprecise\nprobabilities.\nMayo-Wilson and Wheeler (2016) provide a neater version of the proof, and offer a property weaker than strict propriety that an imprecise probability scoring rule can satisfy.\nCarr (2015) and Konek (forthcoming) both present positive suggestions for moving forward with imprecise scoring rules.\nLevinstein (forthcoming) suggests that the problem really only arises for determinately imprecise credences, but not for indeterminate credence.\n4. Summary\n\n\nImprecise probabilities offer a model of rational belief that does\naway with some of the idealisation required by the orthodox precise\nprobability approach. Many motivations for such a move have been put\nforward, and many views on IP have been discussed. There are still\nseveral open philosophical questions relating to IP, and this is\nlikely to be a rich field of research for years to come.",
