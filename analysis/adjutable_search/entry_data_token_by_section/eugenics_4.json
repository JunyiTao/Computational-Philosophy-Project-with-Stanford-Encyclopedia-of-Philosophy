    "main_text": "Criticisms of \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics || The comparison problem\n3.1 The comparison problem\n\n\nThe reproductive choices that prospective parents are encouraged\n\u2013 or morally required \u2013 to make regarding their offspring are\nchoices about selecting or enhancing their children or selecting the\nbest they can have. All involve comparisons about traits that\ncontribute to better or worse lives. But deciding which traits are\npositive, and of those, which are better than others, is a task far\nfrom simple. Critics point to the difficulty of ranking the expected\nwell-being of future possible lives, given 1) disagreements about what\ntraits are positive and negative, and the need to contextualize such\ntraits in a particular environmental or societal context or family\nsituation, and 2) the reality that most embryos will have a complex\nmixture of positive and negative traits making meaningful pairwise\ncomparisons very difficult (de Melo Martin 2004; 2017; Parker\n2007).\n\n\nSavulescu and Kahane have tried to reply to these\nconcerns in various ways. For instance, they have argued that critics\nare overstating their case and that we do this kind of ranking all the\ntime when we make decisions about bringing up and educating our\nchildren. Ordinary morality, they argue, already asks parents to make\nthese comparisons (Savulescu and Kahane 2009).\n\n\nBut it is far from obvious that this is the case\n(de Melo-Martin 2017). Clearly, common morality requires that\nprospective parents care about their children\u2019s wellbeing, not\nthat they maximize it. Moreover, in ordinary life, parents are not\nrequired to choose between child A and child B in virtue of which one\nis more likely to have the best life. Rather, when prospective parents\nmake decisions that are likely to have an impact on their\nchildren\u2019s welfare, such decisions involve comparisons between\nthe life of a child if one does A or if one does B (e.g., if one\npromotes music training or sports).\n\n\nSavulescu and Kahane (2009) also contend that in\ncomplex cases where different forms of life might be equally good or\nthat are likely to contain incomparable forms of well-being,\nprospective parents choosing the child whose life can be expected to go\nbest are free to choose any of the available options.\n\n\nWhile this response suggests some greater\nflexibility in their view than might be apparent from the language of\nobligation, they do not always seem consistent in advocating for this\nflexibility (Sparrow 2007). Moreover, how will\nwe know when different forms of life are equally\ngood or when the associated well-being is incomparable?\n\n\nRather than giving a substantive account of\nwell-being (they argue that their account is compatible with several\ntheories of wellbeing such as hedonism, desire-fulfillment accounts,\nand objective list theories), Savulescu and Kahane simply assert\nconfidence that we will be able to find an agreeable one. They offer\nsimple examples to illustrate their view. Mild asthma, though only a\nminor impediment to well-being, is nonetheless not acceptable to choose\nif we have the information and an alternative embryo without the mild\nasthma. Deafness is clearly a detriment to well-being \u2013 at least in\nthis society \u2013 and so should not be selected. They are careful to\nadd that their view can appreciate deafness and recognize that it is\nclearly compatible with a good, even flourishing\nlife. But a life without asthma or deafness, they submit, would\nclearly be better. Our obligation is to produce the best, not\njust a life compatible with flourishing. They thus see the need for two\nsteps: finding a reasonable theoretical model of well-being, and then\ninvestigating whether a particular trait or condition is, on balance, a\ndetriment to overall well-being on that view.\n\n\nDespite their confidence, there is reason to think\nthere will be significant disagreement in both steps. A theory of\nwell-being that is acceptable to most might be so abstract as to fail\nto offer any significant help, and then the matter of determining how\ntraits or conditions in question are related to expected\nwell-being \u2013 such that we can do a comparison and select the\nbest \u2013 will be even more difficult (Parker 2007). Parents who see\nvalue in a wide variety of ways of being in the world \u2013 both for\nthe individual, and for society as a whole \u2013 may welcome children\nwho have traits that are not standardly considered advantageous.\nConsider, for instance, positive accounts about raising children with\nDown syndrome (Berube 1998; Estreich 2011; Kaposy 2018), and even\nprofound cognitive and physical disability (Kittay 1999). Indeed, as\nSparrow (2007) has pointed out, on any of the accounts of wellbeing\nthat Savulescu and Kahane consider, their proposal to choose the best\nchild will turn out to have either counterintuitive or incoherent\nresults. For instance, prospective parents who have a hedonist\nconception of wellbeing would be justified in choosing \u2013indeed\nobligated to do so \u2013 the child whose brain chemistry is more likely to\ncause feelings of pleasure. Similarly, on a desire-fulfillment account,\nparents would have reasons to choose children who will grow up to have\nless ambition or curiosity as their preferences will be more likely\nsatisfied, and thus would have better lives.\n",
