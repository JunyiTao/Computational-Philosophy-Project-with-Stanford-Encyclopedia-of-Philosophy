    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness\n6. Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness\n A variety of hypotheses have been put forward by scientists and\nphilosophers about which animals are conscious and which are\nnot. These views span a huge range of possibilities, from the\nnarrowest, which is that only humans are conscious, to some authors\narguing that almost all animals, even simple invertebrates, have a\nbasic capacity to experience the world. Some authors have even argued\nthat single-celled organisms (Margulis 2001) or plants (A. Nagel 1997)\nare conscious, and some have given arguments for versions of\npan-psychism, the view that consciousness is a property of fundamental\nphysical entities, much in the same way that mass and charge are\n(Chalmers 2015). It is worth noting that neither the attribution of\nconsciousness to single-celled organisms, nor to fundamental physical\nentities, implies that all animals are conscious. In the former case,\nit may be that the information processing complexity and integration\nof relatively complex single-celled organisms outstrips that of the\nsimplest animals. In the latter case, while the version of panpsychism\ndeveloped by Chalmers attributes \u2018microexperience\u2019 to\n\u2018fundamental physical entities\u2019, this does not imply that\nany particular macroscopic object (like an animal) has\n\u2018macroexperience\u2019 \u2014 i.e. \u201cthe sort of conscious\nexperience had by human beings\u201d (Chalmers 2015). This view is\ncompatible with the possibility that a given animal has no conscious\nexperience, although it is composed of microphysical entities which\npossess conscious microexperience.  These issues will not be discussed\nfurther here, as they fall outside the scope of Animal\nConsciousness. \nThe question of which lineages (species, or more inclusive\ngroupings such as class or phylum) of animals are conscious,\ninevitably goes hand-in-hand with considerations of the evolutionary\norigin of consciousness. This is a logical implication of the broadly\nDarwinian view of life, on which modern organisms have evolved through\ndescent, with modification, from a small number (perhaps one) of very\nancient ancestors.  If a trait is characteristic of a given species,\nit either arose in that species, or is derived from an ancestor\n\u2014 in which case, it will be present in other species derived\nfrom that ancestor, unless it has been secondarily lost in those\nspecies. Did consciousness first arise in humans, or in an earlier,\nnonhuman ancestor? If the latter, then what was this ancestor? Another\npossibility is that consciousness may have arisen multiple times, like\nwinged flight, which evolved independently in insects, birds, bats,\nand pterosaurs. \n",
