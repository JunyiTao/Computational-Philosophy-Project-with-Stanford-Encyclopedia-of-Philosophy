    "main_text": "The classical heritage\n6. The religious component\n\nJust like philosophy, as a way towards salvation, is an imitation of\nGod and implies that the disciple is provided not only of an acute\nmind, but also of a pure heart (through which God will be recognized\nas the sole and the supreme teacher in knowledge and deeds, as the\nHoly Book demonstrates, cf., e.g., Qur., II, 31: \u2018And He taught\nAdam the names', mentioned in Epistle 28, III, 18, 14\u201316 and in\nEpistle 31, III, 112, 19 and 141, 13\u201314; cf. also Epistle 23,\nII, 381, 17), the Ikhw\u00e2n consider prophetic message (both\nesoteric and exoteric, hidden and clear) as the second necessary means\nfor human salvation and happiness. This brings us back to the second\naspect of the encyclopedia, its religious commitment.\n\nWe already saw that the Ikhw\u00e2n rework the classical heritage in\nreligious terms. They also deal with doctrinal questions linked to\nreligion. Epistle 42 On opinions and religions, the other\n\u201cprogrammatic\u201d treatise of the encyclopedia that opens the\nfourth section, is a discussion of the basic ideas of the Brotherhood\nsuch as the multifaceted epistemological problems, the origin of the\nworld, morals and theodicy and the imamate as well as the various\ndoctrines critically considered by the Ikhw\u00e2n, such as\neternalism and dualism. It also develops the apologetic side of\nIkhwanian thought.\n\nEpistle 40 On causes and effects addresses the\ncrucial problem of the origin of the world. The Ikhw\u00e2n subvert\nto religious purposes Aristotle\u2019s teleological approach that\n\u201cnature does not make anything in vain.\u201d Understanding\ncreation, one of the basic Muslim tenets, is recognized as the highest\nattainment of knowledge. So, the ancients are defended from the charge\nof eternalism (cf. III, 356, 11\u201318) and, for the sake of the\nmasses, creation is even explained through the comparison of God with\na confectioner. However the Ikhw\u00e2n \u2013 like the\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis \u2013 adopt Neoplatonic views as the\nbest explication of the origin of the world by God. The world, then,\nemanates from God through the hypostases of Intellect and Soul.\nEmanationism is the philosophical expression of creation; it also\nexplains the encyclopaedic structure of the treatises. The various\nlevels of reality down to the three kingdoms of the generated beings\n(animal, vegetable and mineral) originate continuously through\nintermediaries from the One. For this reason, by acquiring all the\nsciences from the lowest to the highest it is possible to attain the\ncommon source of everything, the \u2018science of God\u2019 in the\ndouble sense of pertaining to God and concerning God \u2013 the\nancient metaphysics (met\u00e0 ta physik\u00e0) no\nlonger indicates what comes \u201cafter\u201d physics but what is\n\u201cbeyond\u201d it. Thus, rather than a mere foreign source,\nNeoplatonism (merged with Neopythagorism) can be considered as the\nIkhw\u00e2n\u2019s proper philosophy. Philosophy as imitation of God\ncontinues as the guiding principle of the Ikhw\u00e2n\u2019s system,\ntogether with equal emphasis on divine revelation.\n\nFrom Epistle 43 onwards, the Ikhw\u00e2n build their own system from\na religious point of view, often in the fragmentary style typical of\nMuslim esoteric writings. Epistle 43 considers the way towards God\nthrough purification; then the beliefs of the Ikhw\u00e2n\nal-Saf\u00e2\u2019 and of the so-called \u201cDivines,\u201d the\nheirs of a prophetic tradition whose origin is ascribed to the ancient\nwise men (Epistle 44). Epistle 45 expounds the organization of the\nBrotherhood based on mutual help. Epistle 46 considers the faith, not\nonly of Islam, but also of the former monotheistic religions and of\nthe ancient wise men. Epistle 47 considers prophecy and the imamate.\nEpistle 48 discusses propaganda. Epistle 49 deals with a key theme in\nthe encyclopedia \u2013 the existence of disembodied agents in the\nworld, based on the Ikhw\u00e2n\u2019s idea that the full truth of\nthe Qur\u2019\u00e2n, obscured in their time by ignorance and\ndistortions, could only be restored thanks to the study of the\nrational sciences developed by the Greek philosophers. In the\nsurviving manuscript tradition, Epistle 49 appears in two versions, a\nshort and a long one. The short one clearly preserves an older text.\nThe long one contains a detailed elaboration of part of the short one.\nThe short version also consists of two parts; the second is a\ncommentary on the Epistle by an author other than that of the first,\nnamely Maslama al-Qurtub\u00ee al-Majr\u00ee\u1e6d\u00ee, during\nhis stay at Basra in 936-7. At the same time, Maslama should have also\ncomposed what de Callata\u00ff identified as the \u201cshort\nversion\u201d of Epistle on Magic, to which Epistle 49 was to\nbe an introduction. In fact, both treatises aim to prove the existence\nof spiritual beings: magic in all its forms consists precisely in the\nacts of such spiritual beings. The long version would have been\ncomposed by Maslama after his return to Cordoba. In the printed\neditions, the final part of the short version is added to the text of\nthe long version, but the addition is not found in any of the MSS\nexamined in the new edition, while it might be found in the MS on\nwhich the first printed edition was based (that of Bombay, 1887-1889);\nbut we do not know if such MS still exists (Madelung et al. 2019,\n1\u20133). Epistle 49 is a complex exposition of Ikhwanian cosmology,\nremarkably different and richer than that exposed in any other\nepistle. This exposition is merged with the authors\u2019 religious\nvision on the relationship between God and the world (Uy in Madelung\net al. 2019, 8). A new vision of the Ikhw\u00e2n\u2019s magic as the\n\u201cconceptual and practical pivot\u201d of their\nreligious-political reform based on inclusion and tolerance is in Saif\n2019; a study of the so-called \u201clonger version\u201d of Epistle\n52 in Saif 2020. Epistle 50 discusses the various kinds of\n'administration' (physical, spiritual, personal, familiar, etc.), the\ncore of the Epistle being the religious and philosophical approach to\nGod. In the new edition, the treatise appears purged of all the\npassages that led Corbin to his esoteric interpretation (Baffioni in\nMadelung et al. 2019, 148 ; Baffioni 2019d). Some MSS provide\nadditions and/or versions radically different from those reported in\nthe other consulted manuscripts and in the printed versions available\n(Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019, Appendices A\u2013D,\n237\u2013364; with regard to additions to other epistles see Baffioni\n2019a, 2019c). Noteworthy is the addition in MS Esad Efendi 3638 that\nexplains the story of Adam meant as the progenitor of huimankind, the\nfirst speaking prophet and the heavenly im\u00e2m (ed. and tr.\nby Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019, 237\u2013277; cf. also Baffioni\n2020b). Apparently, Epistle 51 duly gathers up the threads of the\nwhole (often repeating contexts of previous treatises), but its\nrecent editor has also ascertained the existence of two versions of\nit, maybe even three (Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 381ff.).\nEpistle 52 On magic is the last in\nthe corpus, missing in some editions and considered by\nsome scholars (Bausani 1978, 12 and 279) as spurious, and of little\nvalue, so the Ris\u00e2la\nal-J\u00e2mi\u2018a would be the true fifty-second one\n(cf. de Callata\u00ff 2011, 3). However, de Callata\u00ff inclines to\nthe view that the \u2018short version\u2019 of this treatise,\nnamely, the part approximately corresponding to the first thirty pages\nof the Beirut edition, is genuine (de Callata\u00ff 2011, 5ff).\n\nThat a text exists in different versions is not an isolated case. Two\nversions of Epistles 32 have been found by Walker (Walker et al. 2015,\n5, 7\u20138). Similarly, there are two versions of Epistle 48; one is\nbased on a group of MSS that appear to have been copied from an\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli specimen; the other is based on a second\ngroup of MSS, including Atif Efendi 1618. Despite the permanence of\nSh\u00ee\u2018ite elements, Hamdani believes that the material in\nthe second version has been rearranged in order to provide a version\nacceptable to Sunni-Sufi readers. Although one must believe to the\nstory handed down by al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee, there must have been an\nearlier sh\u00ee\u2018i version of the Ras\u00e2\u2019il\n(Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 383).\n\nThe existence of different versions of a same epistle raises questions\nabout the history of its transmission and about how such existence\nshould be interpreted. Which version should have priority? Should the\nvarious versions be considered to be different stages or different\naspects of the same authorial project? On what basis should they be\nassessed? The date of a MS, although of considerable importance for\ndetermining its value, cannot be taken as the sole criterion for\ndeciding the authenticity or the greater antiquity of a textual\ntradition, since a late MS may have been copied from a very ancient\none. Also, due to problems related to the transmission of MSS\nthemselves, to their dating, and to the nature of the various\nepistles, it is difficult to decide which versions is older or more\nauthentic (Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 382\u2013383).\n\nThe corpus addresses other main religious issues in Muslim\nfaith: the unity and uniqueness, and the attributes of God, angels,\nhuman destiny, good and evil, resurrection. Divine will and power are\nalso considered when trying to explain evil in the world, though, of\ncourse, Muslim faith does not allow identifying God as the cause of\nevil (Epistle 19). Ultimately, the Ikhw\u00e2n attribute it to human\nresponsibility, or, better, to the responsibility of creatures in\ngeneral and they do so in quite a Mu\u2018tazilite perspective. In\nthe hierarchical disposition of universe there are\n\u201cintermediate\u201d beings to which everything that happens in\nthe world may be related. God, a quite remote \u201cfirst\nbeloved\u201d is beyond all this, like the kings, whose orders are\nbehind everything built during their reigns. Epistle 39 On the\nkinds of movement considers the movement of the whole cosmos,\nfrom that of the stars down to those (natural and voluntary) of human\nbeings. Its aim is to demonstrate the existence of a God who created\nthe world and who will bring it to an end. In Epistle 27 souls (that\nare self-subsistent according to the ancient doctrine) unite\nthemselves to human bodies in order to ensure human salvation; hence\nwise men and prophets are said to be the \u201cphysicians of the\nsouls\u201d (III, 13, 7 ff.). The main religious topic is, however,\nresurrection, thoroughly examined in Epistle 38 where it is also\nconsidered as the supreme science (III, 288, 3\u20135). The theme was\nalready addressed in Epistle 29 (wisdom is recognizable in death in\nthat it allows the vision of God, hence the highest sorrow is\ndamnation). On the same line, Epistle 30 states that the real\n\u201cHell\u201d is earth, \u201cParadise\u201d is heaven.\nHowever, the Ikhw\u00e2n deem as \u201cprovidential\u201d the\nignorance of the beauties of the afterlife, which might urge people to\ndesire death before the natural end of life. In doing so, they are far\nfrom the Pythagorean doctrine that considered the soul as a fallen\ndivinity imprisoned within the body as in a \u201ctomb\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion, whereas in Ihs\u00e2\u2019\nal-\u2018ul\u00fbm (\u201cThe Enumeration of the\nSciences\u201d), al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee deals with Muslim\nsciences such as theology (kal\u00e2m) and law\n(fiqh), the Ikhw\u00e2n mainly stress religion. In the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il, the usual distinction between\nphilosophy/sciences (the rational or \u2018aqliyya\nknowledge) and theology (the received or naqliyya knowledge),\nor between reason and faith is not valid as both are combined.\n\nOn the formal side, the religious commitment appears in the frequent\nQur\u2019anic quotations in support of ancient doctrines, sometimes\nthrough interpretations that are not in line with the theological\nones. Above all, the Ikhw\u00e2n appropriate the Muslim ideal of\nattaining happiness in this world and the hereafter and indicate in\nthe treatises how to reach it. In physical terms it is by caring for\nthe body, which when healthy and balanced is the condition of the\npurification of the soul. In metaphysical terms, the purified soul is\nsaid to be capable of knowledge, so of being saved \u2013 even\nthough, like the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis, the Ikhw\u00e2n deny\nsalvation as attainable through solely philosophy.\n\nProphethood is an undeniable part of the theoretical experience\nfeatured by the Ikhw\u00e2n. Their political vision is linked to this\nand implies that attainment of happiness is considered in political\nterms, too, where it results in examination of what has to be\naccomplished to be worthy of entering the entourage of the\nim\u00e2m. In Epistle 40 the science of the esoteric\ninterpretation of the Qur\u2019\u00e2n (explaining its hidden\nmeaning) is emphasized as the highest divine gift (in doing this the\nIkhw\u00e2n give an interpretation of Qur., III, 7 which precedes\nthat, much more well-known, given by Averroes two centuries later, cf.\nIII, 344, 10\u2013345, 5).\n\nThe second pivot of the Ikhw\u00e2n's philosophy in addition to\ncreation is their discussion of the imamate. It has its first origin\nin Epistle 31 On the diversity of languages (now considered\nfrom the standpoint mentioned in the title by Albert Reyna 2009). Here\nthe Ikhw\u00e2n show that religious creeds change as a result of\nlanguage transformations. More particularly, differences and contrasts\nwithin the umma due to changes in the Arabic language are\nlinked to the debate regarding the identity of the Messenger's deputy,\nwhich is the main cause of schism in Islam \u201cuntil their\ntime,\u201d the Ikhw\u00e2n say (cf. Epistle 31, III, 153,\n8\u201310 and 165, 8\u201312). While everybody agrees on the tasks\nof the im\u00e2m, there is a disagreement as to his\nidentity. This is because imamate is of two kinds: prophetic and\nregal. Usually the tasks of the ruler are neatly distinguished from\nthose of the prophet, because governance is a mundane business and\nprophecy is related to the life to come (III, 497, 5\u20136). On\noccasion these qualities are combined in a single person, who is then\nthe delegated prophet and also the ruler (III, 495, 18\u201319).\nWhile the Prophet Muhammad was both prophet and ruler of the Muslim\numma, so ensuring its best defence, his possible successors\ndid not always match him in nobility. Subsequently, prophecy and\ngovernance are sometimes found in two different persons, one of whom\nis the prophet delegated to that community and the other the person\nwho has been given power over them. They support one another (III,\n495, 19\u201321). The real problem seems, then, to be the dignity of\nthe person appointed as the caliph, which alone is the condition of a\nlegitimate prophetical succession. The Ikhw\u00e2n's specific idea on\nthe identity of such a person is not clear. In addition, there is\napparently no distinction between the prophet, the im\u00e2m\nor the ruler with regard to the required qualities, as Epistle 47\nOn the essence of divine Law demonstrates. The sole\n\u201cdoctrinal\u201d solution offered in the encyclopedia seems\nthat a ruler with ascetic tendencies can legitimately take the place\nof the im\u00e2m.\n\nThe political ideas of the Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 have not\nbeen extensively analyzed by scholars, except when they have been\nconsidered as a political movement. (The Ikhw\u00e2n's interest in\npolitical issues is mainly emphasized by Eastern scholars who in\ngeneral incline towards the hypothesis of their being\n[\u201cfilo]-Isma\u2018ili.\u201d Cf. Hijab, 1982; Tamir,\n1983, 89\u2013108). In fact, the \u201cPure Brethren\u201d are\ncontrasted with the \u201cphilosophers,\u201d who were understood to\nhave taken an outsider position with regard to the political\nexpectations of the society in which they lived, as a consequence of\ntheir evaluation of Plato's Republic (cf. e.g. Kraemer 1987\nand Stroumsa 2003). However, the Ikhw\u00e2n do not fail to approach\npolicy from a theoretical standpoint and the philosophical doctrines\ndeveloped in their Epistles can be understood to be a functional\nelement of their political vision. In Epistle 48 On the invitation\nto God, a mad\u00eena f\u00e2dila (perfect city) is\nfeatured \u2013 less known but no less worthy than that proposed by\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee. This time the Ikhw\u00e2n do not hide\nthemselves behind the ancient Platonic heritage: they openly adapt a\nGreek idea to a Muslim situation, and various aspects of the\n'Ismailism' of the treatise have been highlighted in Baffioni,\n2014a.\n\nWere the Ikhw\u00e2n Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis? This of course\nopens the way to the second side of the argument \u2013 the\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli commitment of the Ikhw\u00e2n.\n\nThe saying \u201cd\u00een and mulk are\ntwins\u201d in reference to the prophet and the king empowered to\nperform the functions of the im\u00e2m in the sense preached\nby the Ikhw\u00e2n perfectly fits the Fatimid rulers. If this\nhypothesis is tenable, the debated \u201ctraditions\u201d mentioned\nin Epistle 31 with reference to the misunderstandings due to the\ndiversity of languages might be understood as the Fatimid versions of\nthe divine Law. If the Ikhwanian \u201cLawgiver\u201d is identified\nwith the historical incarnation of the Isma\u2018ili faith, that is,\nwith the Fatimid caliph, and if the \u201cperfect city\u201d is the\none ruled by these caliphs, then the Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019\nare his du\u2018\u00e2\u2019. Epistle 48, with the mention\nof the term da\u2018wa in the title, might further support\nthe hypothesis of a project of concrete militancy by the\nIkhw\u00e2n.\n\nThe Ikhw\u00e2n appear as the learned people who have the task of\npromoting propaganda (da\u2018wa). Sometimes they even seem\nto appropriate the qualities of the king-im\u00e2m; in\nEpistle 47 they introduce themselves as the best guides for the\ndefence of Islam in terms of al-hukam\u00e2\u2019 wa\nal-fal\u00e2sifa wa al-fudal\u00e2\u2019 (\u201cwise men,\nphilosophers and excellent people\u201d) and of the\nanbiy\u00e2\u2019, khulaf\u00e2\u2019\nal-anbiy\u00e2\u2019 wa al-a\u2019imma\nal-mahdiy\u00fbn (\u201cprophets, successors of the prophets\nand well-guided imams,\u201d IV, 126, 5-17). That the\nIkhw\u00e2n aim to be the guides of the elect community is further\nconfirmed by a passage in Epistle 9. The ascetics are described as\nthose \u201cwho know the shortcomings [of the world], who crave for\nthe hereafter and are convinced of it, firmly rooted in its science,\nthat is the sincere Friends of God, [His] faithful servants, the cream\nof all [His] creatures, whom the Creator \u2013 may [He] be exalted\n\u2013 called \u2018persons of understanding, persons of view,\npersons of mind\u2019\u201d (I, 357, 5\u20139). These qualities\ncorrespond to those of the Ikhw\u00e2n engaged, as the leaders of\ntheir community, in their philosophy of salvation; but they also fit\nthe prophets and the im\u00e2ms perfectly. From\nthis point of view the reading of the Holy Book our authors have in\nmind \u2013 rather than a Sh\u00ee\u2018i or Isma\u2018ili\nperspective \u2013 might be the ta\u2019w\u00eel performed\nin their own encyclopedia, where God's Word is continually quoted and\ncommented (Baffioni 2012b; Gobillot 2013). And they refer to the\nspiritual city as \u201cour spiritual city,\u201d which coincides\nwith Paradise.\n\nIn Epistle 47 the legacy of the Prophet is said to be inherited by\n\u201cthe most intelligent\u201d (al-\u2018uqal\u00e2\u2019\nal-akhy\u00e2r) which emphasizes the epistemological function of\nthe Sh\u00ee\u2018ite caliph. In this case a temporal ruler, the\n\u201cruler im\u00e2m,\u201d is no longer necessary\nbecause the rational Law is the real guide, \u201cincarnated\u201d\nin the \u201crightly guided\u201d im\u00e2m and in his\nreason and knowledge. In contrast to Baffioni 2006, 149\u2013150,\nHeck (2008, 205\u2013209) seems to side with Netton's reading of the\nintellect-guide in terms of a rational intellect.\n\nFurther elements allow a better defining of the Ikhw\u00e2n's\npolitical position. The history of early Islam is approached from a\nSh\u00ee\u2018i perspective; some important events of the prophet\nMuhammad's life and mission are recalled; soon attention shifts to two\nfatal events which led to the defeat of Sh\u00ee\u2018ism, the\nbattle of Siff\u00een and the slaughter of Karbal\u00e2\u2019. In a\npassage on the struggles for im\u00e2mate, the \u201crepresentatives\nof the Muhammadic (Muhammadiyya) Law and of the Hashimi\nfederation\u201d (cf. Epistle 31, III, 165, 11\u201312) are opposed.\nIf the latter are the \u2018Abbasids (or even the supporters of\nAb\u00fb H\u00e2shim, son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya), the former\nshould be understood as the direct descendants of the Prophet through\nF\u00e2tima, whence the Ikhw\u00e2n's strict \u2018Alid militancy\nshould be demonstrated.\n\nAnother passage from Epistle 31 (III, 153, 11\u2013156, 9) might urge\nto suppose that the authors' target was the caliph\nal-Ma\u2019m\u00fbn, in spite of his pro-\u2018Alid policy (and\npolitical support of Mu\u2018tazilism). The Ikhw\u00e2n report on a\nruler, who encouraged politico-religious controversies among the\n\u2018ulam\u00e2\u2019 (learned) of different persuasions,\nclaiming for himself the right to interpret the Law on the basis of\nthe Mu\u2018tazili doctrine of the created Qur\u2019\u00e2n.\nJuxtaposed to him is ahl bayt al-nubuwwa (the immediate\nfamily of the Prophet: Muhammad, his daughter F\u00e2tima, his cousin\nand son-in-law \u2018Al\u00ee and their sons, al-Hasan and\nal-Husayn) as the guarantors of the true tradition concerning\nprophetic succession. The Ikhw\u00e2n could then still be identified\nwith the supporters of the strict \u2018Alid conception of the\nimamate, according to which the science of caliphate belongs to the\nfamily of the Prophet only.\n\nIf this hypothesis is tenable, Epistle 31 contains not only the core\nof the Ikhw\u00e2n's political thought, but also of their\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli commitment. Their presentation of the\n\u201cperfect city,\u201d in which mutual love is the basis and the\ngoal of the community, does not help us to ascertain whether the\nIkhw\u00e2n have in mind spiritual rule or a true government such as\nthat of the Fatimid caliph, of whom they might be the\ndu\u2018\u00e2\u2019. Scholars tend to consider this\n\u201cperfect city\u201d as utopian as the Farabian (cf. e.g.\nMarquet 1973, 153; Hamdani 1999, 81). The defeat of evil people is\nalso often foreshadowed in the encyclopedia (cf. e.g. Epistle 31, III,\n154, 19\u201324 and 156, 2\u20133). In Epistle 4 the Ikhw\u00e2n\npresent a cyclical conception of ruling dynasties, and state that\n\u201cthe dynasty of the evil reached its apex,\u201d hence only\ndecline and diminution are to be expected in the future. According to\nTibawi (1955, 37, note 4), the Ikhw\u00e2n forebode here the fall of\nthe \u2018Abbasids. Cf. also Tibawi, 1978, 60.) The dynasty of the\ngood begins when the learned agree \u201con a unique doctrinal school\nand a single religion,\u201d commit themselves to mutual help, and\ndesire the vision of God and doing God's will as their [sole] reward\n(I, 181, 14\u2013182, 2). In Epistle 48, the Ikhw\u00e2n\ndeclare that the one whose advent in the world is expected is coming,\nand it will be a wonderful event (IV, 190, 13), in which the welfare\nof both religion and the world will be gathered. Magic, astronomy and\ntrue dreams helped them establish even the year and month of the\nadvent of the \u201clord of the cycle\u201d (s\u00e2hib\nal-amr) \u2013 but, of course, the date is not mentioned in the\nencyclopedia.\n\nGrounding himself on the S\u00eerat ibn \u1e24awshab of the\nFatimid d\u00e2\u2018\u00ee Ja\u2018far b. Mans\u016br\nal-Yaman (d. second half of the 10th century), Hamdani\nhypothesizes the epistles to have been written under Ahmad b.\n\u2018Abd All\u00e2h b. Mu\u1e25ammad b.\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eel\u2019s im\u00e2mate, who was considered as\nthe expected im\u00e2m. Ahmad, however, was not their author,\nbut their munshi\u2019 (\u201cissuer\u201d). Therefore, the\nIkhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 would have been a think-tank at the\nservice of the Fatimid propaganda, a secret organization with the\nfunction of gaining support from the non-initiates (Hamdani, Soufan\n2019, 1\u20132). Moh. Jalub Farhan, however, describes the\nIkhw\u00e2n as opposed to the Buyid regime, in spite of the fact that\nit supported science (1999, 30, 31). The Brethren who cooperated in\nthe final version of the encyclopedia in the tenth century might have\nbeen disguised adversaries of the Buyids, who were\nSh\u00ee\u2018ites, not Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis. Poonawala\nalso proposes the Ras\u00e2\u2019il to have been written by\npropagandists belonging to the entourage of Ahmad, half a century\nafter al-Ma\u2019m\u00fbn (Walker et al. 2015, 66; De Smet 2017,\n157\u2013158). More recently, Hamdani has noted in the encyclopedia\nalso Sunni-Sufi elements; thereby, the Ikhw\u00e2n would be a secret\nthink-tank made up of taf\u1e0d\u00eel\u00ee Sunnis (that\nis, they assert the superiority of \u2018Al\u00ee over all the\nsuccessors of the Prophet), who hoped to replace the \u2018Abbasids\nwith a \u2018alid caliphate, displaying in their work also liberalism\nand religious tolerance (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 32\u201333).\n\nOn the whole, the political vision outlined above appears to\nbe founded on doctrinal elements of Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli\nnature. The division between the \u201celect\u201d and the\n\u201cmasses\u201d destines the former only for investigation of the\ncurriculum studiorum at the basis of the \u201cphilosophy of\nsalvation\u201d. A rigid hierarchy of universe links each level of\nexistence, physical and spiritual, to that which precedes and that\nwhich follows it where the beings that belong to the various levels\ncannot go beyond them. (It should be noted that this may question the\nidea of \u201cevolution\u201d in the Ikhw\u00e2n that some scholars\nhave ascribed to them; cf. e.g. Vernet Gin\u00e9s 1990, 190; Marquet\n1992). The didactic aims of the ruler mirror the aspect of\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli propaganda known as\nta\u2018l\u00eem (lit.: \u201cteaching\u201d).\n\nThe influence of the Epistles on later (after the\n12th century) Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli literature\nhas been widely recognized (Stern 1964, 416\u2013417; Diwald 1975, 26\nss.; Daftary 2007, 236). Their content has been transmitted and\ndeveloped by subsequent thinkers of various persuasions. It is\nnoteworthy, however, that extended literal quotations (and even\ntranslations) from the Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 are found in\nthe famous Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli thinker and missionary\nN\u00e2sir-e Khosrow (1004\u20131074) (see Saccone 2007,\n67\u201368; Baffioni 2013c and Poonawala in Baffioni, Poonawala\n2017, 285 ff.): this may be a proof of the use of the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il in 11th century\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli authors. If the Ikhw\u00e2n\nal-Saf\u00e2\u2019 were Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis or in someway\nlinked to Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism, then\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism influenced a much wider part of Islamic\nthought and culture than previously recognized.\n\nWith regard to an Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli commitment to the\nIkhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019, some aspects of their philosophy of\nnature (geology, mineralogy, and botany) have been recently examined\n(Baffioni 2008, 2009, 2010b; de Callata\u00ff 2008). Mineralogy and\nbotany have been explored in order to find similarities with\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli philosophy, in particular with the\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli thinker and missionary Ham\u00eed\nal-D\u00een al-Kirm\u00e2n\u00ee. The result is that they share\nmany basic views, but the Ikhw\u00e2n has greater detail. Moreover,\nsome aspects of the Ikhw\u00e2n\u2019s cosmology, and in particular\ntheir use of the term and concept of ibd\u00e2\u2018, are\nrelevant in identifying the similarities (Baffioni 2011a; 2013b;\n2013d).\n\nHowever, the radical change of hypotheses about the dating of the\nepistles after the identification of the role that Maslama\nal-Qurtub\u00ee would have played in them, also led to rethinking the\npolitical (and possibly messianic) beliefs of the Ikhw\u00e2n and the\nattempts to identify the polemical targets of their assertions.\nMadelung remarks that while the Fatimids were used to see both\nUmayyads and \u2018Abbasids as usurpers and enemies of\n\u2018Al\u00ee, the Ikhw\u00e2n had no longer contacts with any\nhidden im\u00e2m, as they believe that the advent of the\nMahd\u00ee has been delayed to a remote future. Therefore, they\nadopted a quietist attitude towards the existing regimes: their\npurpose was only to purify Islam through the study of ancient thought,\nthus preparing humanity for the advent of the true Mahd\u00ee.\nMaslama al-Qurt\u0323ub\u00ee remained a loyal subject of the Umayyad\ngovernor of Andalus, \u2018Abd al-Rah\u0323m\u00e2n III. Hence, the\nIkhw\u00e2n no longer regarded the Umayyads as the inveterate enemies\nof the Family of the Prophet. The im\u00e2m, direct\ndescendants of the Prophet, are instead described as the only ones\nentitled to rule humanity, and for this purpose divinely chosen; but\ntheir persecutors \u2013 although denounced as tyrants \u2013 are\nnot identified.
