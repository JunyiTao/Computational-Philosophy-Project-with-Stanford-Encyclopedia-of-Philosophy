    "main_text": "The Range and Types of Special Obligations || Parental Obligations\n6.2 Parental Obligations\n\nIn our society the least questioned of all apparent special\nobligations is that of a parent to his or her children. We seem to\nreserve our harshest moral condemnations for those who fail to see to\nthe best interests of their children. We also seem to see the special\nobligations of parents to their children as requiring great\nself-sacrifice, perhaps more than is demanded by any other special\nrelationship. But what explains these highly stringent\nobligations?\n\nDavid Archard makes the important distinction between having \u201can\nobligation to ensure that someone acts as a parent to the child\u201d\nand having an obligation to act as a parent oneself. He calls the\nformer \u2018parental obligations,\u2019 and the latter are dubbed\n\u2018parental responsibilities\u2019 (104\u2013105). Archard\ndefends a causal theory of parental obligations, according to which\n\u201cthose who cause children to exist thereby incur an obligation\nthat they are adequately cared for\u201d (127). Thus, a parent could,\naccording to Archard, fulfill her parental obligations that result\nfrom conceiving and bearing a child, by finding adoptive parents who\nwill assume parental responsibilities for the child. As Archard\nacknowledges, anyone offering a causal account owes us a view about\nwhat role one needs to play in the causal generation of a child in\norder to have parental obligations: if I rent an apartment to a couple\nthat makes it possible for them to have the privacy to pursue the\ncreation of a family, I play a causal role in bringing their child\ninto existence, but surely I do not have parental obligations of any\nkind.\n\nOn the other side of the debate is the voluntarist account of parental\nobligations, according to which one comes to have parental obligations\nonly by voluntarily accepting such obligations (see Brake for a\ndefense of this view, and Prusak for critique of Brake). Of course,\nany such view owes us an account of what would count as voluntary\nassumption of parental obligations. Certain accounts of what counts as\nvoluntary assumption \u2013 i.e., ones that count engaging in\nprocreative sexual activity as voluntary assumption of parental\nobligations \u2013 could cause the voluntarist view to collapse back\ninto the causal account. Clearly, getting the appropriate account of\ncausation \u2013 if we accept the causal view \u2013 and of\nvoluntary assumption \u2013 if we accept the voluntarist view \u2013\nis important if we are to apply these views to issues such as\nabortion, child support, surrogate motherhood, and new reproductive\ntechnologies.\n",
