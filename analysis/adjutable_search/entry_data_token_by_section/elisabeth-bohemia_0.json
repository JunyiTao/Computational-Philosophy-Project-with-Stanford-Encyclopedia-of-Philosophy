    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nElisabeth Simmern van Pallandt, born on 26 December 1618, was the\nthird of thirteen children and eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector\nPalatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England and\nsister of Charles I. She died on 8 February 1680, in Herford, Germany,\nwhere she was abbess of the convent there.\n\nIn 1620, Frederick V, having been installed as King of Bohemia,\npromptly lost his throne in events usually taken to have precipitated\nthe Thirty Years War. In the 1620s, Elisabeth lived in Brandenburg\nwith her grandmother and aunt until the children joined their parents,\nliving in exile, in The Hague, where they were sheltered by Maurice of\nNassau, Frederick\u2019s maternal uncle. Akkerman (2021) reconstructs\nElisabeth\u2019s education at the Prinsenhof, in Leiden, largely from\nthe memoirs of Elisabeth\u2019s sister Sophie, which were transcribed\nby Leibniz. Although some of the details of Elisabeth\u2019s education\nremain sketchy, it is clear that she and her siblings were tutored in\nlanguages, including Greek, Latin, French, English and German and\nperhaps others. We can infer that Elisabeth was taught logic,\nmathematics, politics, philosophy and the sciences, and it is reported\nthat her intellectual accomplishments earned her the nickname\n\u2018La Greque\u2019 from her siblings. She also was schooled in\npainting, music and dancing, and might well have been tutored by\nConstantijn Huygens. Pal (2012) provides more detail of the\nintellectual environment of the court in The Hague.\n\nWhile her correspondence with Descartes comprises the only substantive\nextant philosophical writings of Elisabeth of which we are currently\naware, we do know of other correspondence: with John Pell, concerning\nDescartes\u2019s Geometry; exchanges with Quakers, including\nRobert Barclay, George Keith, and William Penn; and letters written\nboth by and to her concerning political and financial matters in the\nEnglish Calendar of State Papers. There is also record of a brief\nexchange with Nicholas Malebranche. She is also known to have been\nconnected to Francis Mercury van Helmont, who is reported to have been\nat her deathbed. Ebbersmeyer (2020) provides the first inventory of\nthe extant correspondence of Elisabeth, which includes not only the\ncorrespondence of which we were already aware and letters to family,\nbut also letters with intellectuals associated with her stay in\nHeidelberg, where her elder brother Charles Louis was rebuilding the\nUniversity after the Thirty Years War, including correspondence in\nwhich she circulated Descartes\u2019 mathematical letters to her. The\ncorrespondence with Descartes reveals her to have been involved with\nan appointment in mathematics to the University of Leiden,\ncontemporary discussions of astronomy (Ebbersmeyer 2018), the\ndissemination of Cartesian natural philosophy in Germany (Shapiro\n2019), as well as in negotiations on a number of matters, including\nthe imprisonment of her brother Rupert in conjunction with his efforts\naround the English Civil War, negotiations of the marriage of her\nsister Henrietta, negotiations of the Treaty of Westphalia, and the\nfinances of her family after the end of the Thirty Years War.\n\nIn 1660 Elisabeth entered the Lutheran convent at Herford, and in 1667\nshe became abbess of the convent. She seems to have been an effective\nmanager of the convent lands, but also she welcomed more marginal\nreligious sects, including the Labadists, at the request of Anna Maria\nvan Schurman (see De Baar 2021 for a discussion of the extended\nfriendship between Elisabeth and van Schurman), and Quakers, including\nPenn and Barclay.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the accomplishments of some of her siblings. As\nnoted above, her older brother Charles Louis was responsible for\nrestoring the University of Heidelberg after the Thirty Years War.\nRupert, the brother born next after her, gained fame for his chemical\nexperiments as well as for his military and entrepreneurial exploits,\nincluding the founding of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Louise Hollandine,\na younger sister, was an accomplished painter and student of Gerritt\nvan Honthorst. Sophie, her youngest sister, became the electress of\nHanover and was renowned for her intellectual patronage, particularly\nthat of Leibniz. Sophie\u2019s daughter, Sophie-Charlotte, was tutored by\nLeibniz, and both women carried on substantive philosophical\ncorrespondence with Leibniz in which he clarified his philosophical\nviews.
