    "main_text": "Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Causal Inference || Specific Debates: Causal Interaction, Average Effects, Mediators\n3.2 Specific Debates: Causal Interaction, Average Effects, Mediators\n\nCartwright\u2019s innovations for probabilistic accounts of causality\nhave triggered various debates related to Simpson\u2019s Paradox. We\nhighlight three of them here:\nDebate 1: Causal Interaction\n\nCartwright claims that causes raise the probabilities of their effects\nacross all background\n contexts,[4]\n but many purported causes only raise the probabilities of their\neffects in some contexts. In the latter cases, causes\ninteract with background factors in producing their effects.\nTo give Cartwright\u2019s own example (1979: 428), ingesting an acid\npoison generally causes death, except in contexts where one also\ningests an alkali poison (in which case the two cancel one another\nout). The problem of such interactive causes for probabilistic\naccounts is that they threaten Cartwright\u2019s picture on which the\neffect of probability-raising causes is \u201cconcealed\u201d by a\nstronger negative cause which \u201cdominates\u201d them. These\nmetaphors suggest that the probability-raising relationship between a\ncause and its effect reflects an intrinsic relationship between the\nvariables that exists even when not manifested, an idea further\ndeveloped in (Cartwright 1989). Interaction means that causes do not\noperate in a vacuum, but rather only in the presence of background\nfactors (for further discussion, see Otte 1985; Eells 1986; Hardcastle\n1991).\n\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox should not be conflated with causal\ninteraction, however. What is distinctive of the paradox is not that\nthe probabilistic relationship reverses upon partitioning, but rather\nthat it reverses in all of the resulting subpopulations.\nDebate 2: Average Effects\n\nCartwright requires \\(\\b{K}\\) to include all causes of \\(\\r{E}\\), and\nthus to evaluate effects relative to homogenous background contexts.\nThe account thus does not allow for average effects. For example,\nsuppose that a particular treatment \\((\\r{T})\\) raises the probability\nof heart disease \\((\\r{H})\\) in individuals who were born prematurely\n\\((\\r{P})\\) but not individuals who were not, and that \\(\\r{P}\\) is\nnot correlated with \\(\\r{T}\\). In the whole population, the amount by\nwhich \\(\\r{T}\\) lowers or raises the probability of \\(H\\) will be an\naverage of the effects in the \\(\\r{P}\\) and \\(\\neg\\r{P}\\) populations,\nweighted by their size. Dupr\u00e9 (1984) argues for abandoning the\nrequirement that \\(\\b{K}\\) include all causes of \\(E\\), and thus for\nallowing average effects.\n\nA tempting lesson to draw from our opening example is that\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox arises as a result of averaging over the\npopulations of males and females, and that the only way to eliminate\nit is by ruling out average effects. However, causal heterogeneity\ndoes not by itself lead to the\n paradox.[5]\n Cases with heterogeneous background factors only produce association\nreversal if the factors are correlated with the causal\nvariable\u2014as demonstrated by\n Theorem 1\n in\n Section 2.2.\nDebate 3: Mediators\n\nAccording to Cartwright, the set \\(\\b{K}\\) should not include\nvariables that are causally intermediate between \\(C\\) and \\(E\\). Such\nvariables are called mediators. To see why, imagine a\ndrug reduces the risk of heart disease by producing a chemical,\nrepresented by variable \\(Z\\), in the blood stream, and via no other\nfactors. If \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) have no common causes, they will be\nprobabilistically independent conditional on \\(Z\\). Intuitively, one\nshould not hold the blood chemical fixed in evaluating the effect,\nsince it is the means by which the effect is brought about.\n\nWhen there are multiple paths between cause and\neffect, the question becomes more complex. Hesslow (1976)\nprovides an example where taking birth control pills promotes a\nblood-clotting condition called thrombosis via a chemical in the\nblood, but inhibits it via preventing pregnancy, which itself is a\ncause of thrombosis. As a result, taking birth control intuitively\ninfluences thrombosis both positively and negatively. If one is\ninterested in the net effect of \\(C\\) on \\(E\\)\u2014as opposed to the\neffects via particular paths (Hitchcock 2001)\u2014then one should\nnot condition on mediators. However, conditioning is necessary for\ncalculating path-specific effects (e.g., Pearl 2001; Weinberger\n2019).\n\nDistinguishing mediators from common causes is crucial for analyses of\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox. For example, the causal models \\(C\\to Z \\to\nE\\) and \\(C\\leftarrow Z \\to E\\) exhibit the same conditional\nindependencies: \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) will be associated unconditionally,\nbut independent conditional on \\(Z\\). Only causal knowledge enables us\nto decide how we shall deal with the association reversal, and whether\nwe need to condition upon \\(Z\\) when estimating the causal effect of\n\\(C\\) on \\(E\\) (we do in the second model, but not in the first).
