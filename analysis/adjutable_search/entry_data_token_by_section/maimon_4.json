    "main_text": "From Dogmatism to Skepticism (and Back?)\n5. From Dogmatism to Skepticism (and Back?)\n\nMaimon describes his position as \u201cHumean dogmatism,\u201d (or,\nalternately, as \u201cLeibnizian skepticism\u201d), and this\ncharacterization is apt \u2013 he is both a rational dogmatist and an\nempirical skeptic. His commitment to both camps, however, makes the\nquestion of his ultimate allegiance a difficult one. While Maimon\nagrees with the rationalists about the standards provided by reason,\nhe claims to follow Hume in denying that there can ever be a proof of\nthe applicability of reason to the world of experience. In this\nrespect, the status of the principle of determinability encapsulates\nMaimon\u2019s position: while we can comprehend what the standard of\nreal thought involves (since we have an example in mathematics), we\ncan never be sure about its application to empirical matters (since we\ncannot guarantee the requisite determinable relation between subject\nand predicate). Maimon\u2019s skepticism arises \u201cfrom the lack\nof the required ground for this use [of the categories], namely, the\ninsight into the relation of determinability (that the subject, as the\ndeterminable, can be an object of consciousness in itself, while the\npredicate cannot be so in itself, but only as a determination [of the\nsubject]). The categories are therefore, according to me, determined\nnot for empirical use, but only for the objects of mathematics\ndetermined a priori\u201d (GW V, 495\u20136 | VnL\n437\u20138).\n\nMaimon here exposes what seem to be the skeptical implications of his\nrationalism, for while the standards of real thought are available to\nus as finite cognizers, the satisfaction of these criteria remains\nbeyond our power. According to this skeptical rationalism, the\nconditions that allow us entry into the realm of reason can never be\nsatisfied in our relations to the sensible world: reason tells us what\nstandards our explanations must meet, but nothing in our experience\ncan discharge these demands. Rather, in our dealings with the sensible\nworld, we must remain Humean skeptics, who can appeal to regularities\nand customs in our attempts to explain the empirical world, but who\nrecognize that these explanations always remain provisional and\nunsure, since they never meet the demands of reason.\n\nBut while Maimon\u2019s skepticism commits him to the view that human\nknowledge remains incomplete, he does not abandon the notion of\nintellectual progress. While we can despair of ever reaching complete\nknowledge, the rationalist project at least holds out the hope of\nadvancing us in our conceptual grasp of the world (on this point, see\nChicharel 2020). In this sense, while Maimon is led by his skeptical\nconclusions to see human cognition as essentially antinomial, he\nretains the prospect of a solution:\n\nThought in general consists in a relation of a form (a rule of the\nunderstanding) to matter (the given subsumed by [the form]). Without\nmatter one cannot attain consciousness of the form, and consequently\nthe matter is a necessary condition of thought; that is, for the real\nthought of a form or rule of the understanding, there must necessarily\nbe given a matter to which this form relates. On the other hand,\nhowever, the completeness of the thought of an object requires that\nnothing be given in [this completeness], but rather that everything\nmust be thought. Since we cannot deny either of these demands, we must\ntherefore try to satisfy both, in that we make our thought ever more\ncomplete, whereby the matter always approaches the form, through\ninfinity \u2014 and this is the solution of this antinomy\n(GW III, 186\u20137 | PW 162\u20133).\n\n\nThis relation between skepticism and rationalism is nicely captured in\na biblical metaphor Maimon offers:\n\nReason, which in its theoretical employment is conditioned by given\nobjects, and is thus very limited, is now, in its practical use in\nrelation to the will, absolute. The principle which it presents is\nboth determined in itself, and in its application is capable of no\nillegitimacy. This highly pleasant prospect is certainly doubted by\nthe skeptic, who reduces any law, as an original fact, into many. An\nuplifting and at once humbling voice calls out to him: \u201cYou\nshould see the promised land from afar, but you may not enter\nit!\u201d [Deut 34:4] Still, fortunately the seeing and the entering\nare the same: for those who boast of being able to enter can, for\ntheir legitimation, do no more than show the distant view (GW\nVII, 554).\n\n\nThe vision of the promised land is an especially apt characterization\nof Maimon\u2019s skepticism: we can see what conditions would need to\nbe satisfied for real cognition, but we are barred from ever knowing\nif these conditions are met. When pressed for a warrant for his claims\nto certainty, the dogmatist can do no more than simply point to the\nfar-off land of philosophical milk and honey.\n",
