    "main_text": "The Interim Account: 1903 || The Ten Classes of Signs\n3.4 The Ten Classes of Signs\n\nPeirce believed that the three elements, and the respective\nclassifications they imposed upon signs, could be combined to give a\ncomplete list of sign types. That is, since a sign has a sign-vehicle\nit can be classified as either a qualisign, a sinsign, or legisign.\nAdditionally, since that sign has an object it can be classified as\neither an icon, an index, or a symbol. And finally, since that sign\nwill also determine an interpretant it can be classified as either a\nrheme, a dicent, or a delome. Each sign is then classifiable as some\ncombination of each of its three elements, that is, as either one of\nthe three types of sign-vehicle, plus one of the three types of\nobject, plus one of the three types of interpretant. Initially, this\nseems to yield twenty-seven possible classificatory combinations, but,\nbecause of certain of Peirce\u2019s phenomenological theories, there are\nrestrictions on how we can combine the different elements that mean\nthere are, in fact, only ten types of sign. (For more on the relation\nbetween Peirce\u2019s phenomenological categories, and his sign typology,\nsee Lizska 1996, Farias and Queiroz 2014, and Savan 1988.)\n\nThe rules for the permissible combinations are actually quite simple\nso long as we bear two things in mind. First, types of each element\nare classifiable as either a quality, an existential fact, or a\nconvention. That is, across the three elements of a sign, there are\nthree types deriving from qualities (the qualisign, the icon, and the\nrheme), three deriving from existential facts, (the sinsign, the\nindex, and the dicent), and three deriving from conventions (the\nlegisign, the symbol, and the delome). Second, the classification of\nthe interpretant depends upon the classification of the object, which\nin turn depends upon the classification of the sign-vehicle. The rules\nthat determine permissible classifications, then, are that if an\nelement is classified as a quality, then its dependent element may\nonly be a classified as a quality. If an element is classified as an\nexistential fact, then its dependent element may be classified as\neither an existential fact, or a quality. And if an element is\nclassified as a convention, then its dependent element may be\nclassified as either a convention, an existential fact, or a quality.\nThis leaves us with ten permissible combinations between a\nsign-vehicle, object and interpretant, and so ten possible kinds of\nsigns. They look something like this:\n\n\n\nInterpretant\nObject\nSign-Vehicle\nExamples (from CP2.254\u2013263 1903) \n\n\n\nRheme\nIcon\nQualisign\n\u201cA feeling of red\u201d \n\nRheme\nIcon\nSinsign;\n\u201cAn Individual Diagram\u201d \n\nRheme\nIndex\nSinsign\n\u201cA spontaneous cry\u201d \n\nDicent\nIndex\nSinsign\n\u201cA Weather Cock\u201d \n\nRheme\nIcon\nLegisign\n\u201cA diagram [type]\u201d \n\nRheme\nIndex\nLegisign\n\u201cA demonstrative pronoun\u201d \n\nDicent\nIndex\nLegisign\n\u201cA street cry\u201d \n\nRheme\nSymbol\nLegisign\n\u201cA common noun\u201d \n\nDicent\nSymbol\nLegisign\n\u201cOrdinary proposition\u201d \n\nDelome\nSymbol\nLegisign\n\u201cAn argument\u201d  \n\n\nThese ten types of sign are simply called after the combination of\ntheir elements: an ordinary proposition is a\ndicentic-symbolic-legisign, a spontaneous cry a\nrhematic-indexical-sinsign, and so on.\n\nDespite its apparent completeness and complexity, however, Peirce soon\nbegan rethinking his 1903 account of signs. Over the final years of\nhis life, he introduced further complexities and nuance to his\nsemiotics.\n",
