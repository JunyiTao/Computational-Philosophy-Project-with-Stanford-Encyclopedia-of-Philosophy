    "main_text": "Ethics || Benefit and Happiness\n3.2 Benefit and Happiness\n\nAs in early Mohism, \u201cbenefit\u201d (l\u00ec\n\u5229) is the fundamental standard of what is moral or right\n(y\u00ec \u7fa9), which underlies moral duties and\nvirtues: \u201cMorality is benefit\u201d (A8, B76). Benevolence\n(r\u00e9n \u4ec1, also kindness) is \u201ccaring about\nindividuals\u201d (A7). \u201cCare\u201d (\u00e0i\n\u611b) is left unexplained, though the texts indicate that the\nmorally good care constitutive of benevolence (r\u00e9n)\ninvolves caring about others for their own sake, and not as a means to\nan end (A7), and that a characteristic feature of care is desiring\nbenefit for and disliking harm to a person (EC7). \n\nEarlier Mohist texts give no simple, unified definition of benefit\n(l\u00ec \u5229), instead characterizing it loosely as an objective list of material and social goods, specifically\nwealth, population, and social order, this last good \n comprising a list of virtues and patterns of conduct. \n By contrast, the Canons\ntake happiness or delight (x\u01d0 \u559c) as a criterion\nof benefit (l\u00ec) and thus of what is morally right\n(y\u00ec): \u201cBenefit is what we get and are\nhappy\u201d (A26). Accordingly, \u201cdislike\u201d is a criterion\nof harm and thus of what is wrong: \u201cHarm is what we get and\ndislike\u201d (A27). This characterization of benefit and harm in\nterms of psychological attitudes is a remarkable shift from earlier\nMohism. The new account can probably explain the older one, insofar as\nthe Mohists might claim that wealth, population, and social order are\nbasic needs whose satisfaction makes all people happy. But the new\naccount opens up conceptual room to revise and expand Mohist ethics.\nSince what makes people happy is likely to vary in different\ncircumstances, the content of the social d\u00e0o \u9053\nmay change over time, and wealth, population, and social order may not\nbe the only goods that it aims to promote. \n\nThe Mohist appeal to happiness and dislike is interestingly different\nfrom that of classical utilitarianism in the West. Utilitarians such\nas Bentham and Mill held a hedonistic theory of value, on which\nhappiness is the fundamental good. Moral value for them lies in\nmaximizing happiness. For the Mohists, by contrast, happiness is not a\nfundamental good, but a criterion by which to identify the goods that\nconstitute benefit. Their theory thus sidesteps a well-known criticism\nof hedonistic theories of value, namely that happiness is an\nunconvincing explanation of or basis for moral value, since it\ngenerally is not a fundamental good but a byproduct of our achieving\nother goods. \n\nOn the other hand, the Mohists seem to assume without discussion that\nwhat is genuinely to our benefit will make us happy and that what\nmakes us happy will be beneficial and morally right. Both of these\npoints are open to question. A critic might object, for instance, that\nthere may be goods that produce benefit without delighting us or\nthings that produce delight without genuinely benefiting us (heroin\nuse being a standard example). In the Mohists\u2019 defense, one\nmight argue that all goods at least produce some general feeling of\nsatisfaction, if not delight, and that things that do not genuinely\nbenefit us produce at best only a transient, unstable, or otherwise\ndeficient form of satisfaction or delight. Under critical scrutiny,\nthen, the Mohists\u2019 explanation of benefit seems\npromising\u2014there may well be a connection, perhaps even a\nnecessary one, between benefit and some form of psychological\nsatisfactoriness\u2014but it probably needs to be revised or\ndeveloped further. \n\nWhose benefit counts in determining what morality (y\u00ec\n\u7fa9) is, and what are the scope of our moral duties? The Mohists\nhold that everyone\u2019s benefit counts equally in determining what\nconduct or practices are right or wrong. As individuals, though, we\nmay not each have a duty to treat everyone equally. In our basic\nmotivations or intentions (zh\u00ec \u5fd7), we are to\ntake \u201call under Heaven\u201d\u2014the world of living\nthings\u2014as our \u201cportion\u201d (f\u00e8n\n\u4efd), or scope of responsibility, whose benefit we are committed\nto promoting (A8). But provided we are committed to the benefit of all\nand capable of acting on our commitment when the chance arises, we\nneed not actually benefit everyone. Individuals\u2019 moral worth is\ndetermined not by how much they actually benefit the world, which may\nbe beyond their control (they may die young, for instance (EC3)), but\nby their intentions and abilities, which are largely within their\ncontrol. (The Mohists may recognize an exception to this rule in the\ncase of moral heroes, such as the ancient sage king Yu, whose moral\nworth surpasses other people\u2019s.) Unless we hold high political\noffice or are responding to an emergency, most of us will not have the\nchance to benefit the whole world directly and need not try to do\nso.\n\nInstead, the extent to which we should seek to benefit others will\nnormally depend on our relationship to them. The Mohists propose that\nour conduct toward others be guided by a code of responsibilities\nassociated with various relationships, which they plausibly would have\nregarded as justified by its efficacy in promoting the welfare of all.\nThis code is an articulation of the earlier Mohists\u2019 commitment\nto the virtues associated with the paradigm social relations of ruler,\nsubject, father, son, and brother. It may also have been a response to\nthe criticism that impartial care for all undermines special personal\nrelationships, which most of us agree are of great value. The Mohists\noften expressed their doctrine of all-inclusive care as \u201ccaring\nabout others\u2019 as one cares about one\u2019s own,\u201d a\nformulation open to the uncharitable construal that, for instance, one\nshould treat everyone else\u2019s father as having a status identical\nto one\u2019s own. As the Mohists\u2019 critics were quick to point\nout, the result would be that we fail to treat our father as our\nfather, rather than simply as one male elder among others. On\nthese grounds, Mencius, one of the Mohists\u2019 Confucian opponents,\nclaimed that the Mohist doctrine was tantamount to denying one\u2019s\nfather. The Mohists themselves clearly did not consider this a\nconsequence of their position, which they repeatedly indicated was\ncompatible with filial devotion (xi\u00e0o \u5b5d). But\nto settle the issue, an explicit account was needed of the role of\nspecial personal relationships in their ethics.\n",
