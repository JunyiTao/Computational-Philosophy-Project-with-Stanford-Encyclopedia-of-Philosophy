Kant on sexuality and objectification\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s views on sexual objectification have been\nparticularly influential for contemporary feminist discussions on this\ntopic. Kant thought that sexuality is extremely problematic when\nexercised outside the context of monogamous marriage, arguing that in\nsuch instances it leads to objectification. He characteristically\nwrites in the Lectures on Ethics that \u201csexual love\nmakes of the loved person an Object of appetite; as soon as that\nappetite has been stilled, the person is cast aside as one casts away\na lemon which has been sucked dry. \u2026 as soon as a person\nbecomes an Object of appetite for another, all motives of moral\nrelationship cease to function, because as an Object of appetite for\nanother a person becomes a thing and can be treated and used as such\nby every one\u201d (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 163).\n\nObjectification, for Kant, involves the lowering of a person, a being\nwith humanity, to the status of an object. Humanity, for\nKant, is an individual\u2019s rational nature and capacity for\nrational choice. The characteristic feature of humanity is an\nindividual\u2019s capacity for rationally setting and pursuing her\nown ends. A being with humanity is capable of deciding what is\nvaluable, and of finding ways to realise and promote this value.\nHumanity is what is special about human beings. It distinguishes them\nfrom animals and inanimate objects. Because human beings are special\nin this sense they, unlike animals and objects, have a\ndignity (an \u2018inner worth\u2019, as opposed to a\n\u2018relative worth\u2019) (Kant 1785, 42). It is crucial, for\nKant, that each person respects humanity in others, as well as\nhumanity in their own person. Humanity must never be treated merely as\na means, but always at the same time as an end (Kant 1797, 209).\n\nKant is worried that when people exercise their sexuality outside the\ncontext of monogamous marriage, they treat humanity merely as a means\nfor their sexual purposes. In the Lectures on Ethics Kant\noften speaks about \u2018degradation\u2019,\n\u2018subordination\u2019, and \u2018dishonouring\u2019 of\nhumanity when exercise of sexuality is involved. He goes so far as to\nsay that sexual activity can lead to the loss or\n\u2018sacrifice\u2019 of humanity (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n163\u20134). The loved person loses what is special to her as a human\nbeing, her humanity, and is reduced to a thing, a mere sexual\ninstrument. Kant\u2019s notion of objectification, therefore, focuses\nlargely on instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a mere tool\nfor the lover\u2019s purposes. Objectification, for Kant, involves\nregarding someone \u201cas an object, something for use\u201d\n(Herman 1993, 57). According to Alan Soble, for Kant, \u201cboth the\nbody and the compliant actions of the other person are tools (a means)\nthat one uses for one\u2019s sexual pleasure, and to that extent the\nother person is a fungible, functional thing\u201d (Soble 2002a,\n226). The idea that within sexual relationships people are reduced to\nobjects, that they lose their rational nature, is an extreme one.\nHalwani rightly points out that this reduction to the status of an\nobject rarely happens in sexual objectification. He explains that\n\u201cOutside rape, it is rare to treat our sexual partners as\nobjects: not only are we aware of their humanity; we are also mindful\nof it.\u201d (Halwani 2010, 193) Halwani offers a more sensible\nreading of Kant\u2019s claim here, in admitting that there is truth\nto the idea that \u201cSexual desire is powerful enough to make\nreason its own tool; it can subvert our rational capacity to set\nends\u201d (Halwani 2010, 209). In this way, people can\n\u201cendanger their dignity by undermining their reason\u201d\n(Halwani 2010, 209). Therefore, even though the view that humanity is\ncompletely destroyed when people exercise their sexuality is an\nunappealing one, it is not unreasonable to think that, in some cases,\nsexual desire and exercise of sexuality can undermine our\nrationality.\n\nKant thought that in theory both men and women can be objectified, but\nhe was well aware that in practice women are the most common victims\nof objectification. This is obvious in Kant\u2019s discussions of\nprostitution and concubinage. Exercise of sexuality within these\nmorally problematic sexual contexts leads to the reduction of women\n(prostitutes and concubines) to men\u2019s objects of appetite.\n\nKant defines prostitution as the offer for profit of\none\u2019s person for another\u2019s sexual gratification. A person,\nKant holds, cannot allow others to use her body sexually in exchange\nfor money without losing her humanity and becoming an object. He\nexplains that \u201c\u2026 a man is not at his own disposal. He is\nnot entitled to sell a limb, not even one of his teeth. But to allow\none\u2019s person for profit to be used for the satisfaction of\nsexual desire, to make of oneself an Object of demand, is to dispose\nover oneself as over a thing\u201d (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n165). The prostitute\u2019s commodification necessarily leads to her\nobjectification; she is reduced to \u201ca thing on which another\nsatisfies his appetite\u201d (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 165).\nKant states that \u201chuman beings are \u2026 not entitled to\noffer themselves, for profit, as things for the use of others in the\nsatisfaction of their sexual inclinations. In so doing, they would run\nthe risk of having their person used by all and sundry as an\ninstrument for the satisfaction of inclination\u201d (Kant\nLectures on Ethics, 165). Kant blames the prostitute for her\nobjectification. He takes her to be responsible for sacrificing her\nhumanity, in offering herself as an object for the satisfaction of the\nclients\u2019 sexual desires.\n\nThe other relationship in which objectification is, for Kant, clearly\npresent is concubinage. According to Kant, concubinage is the\nnon-commodified sexual relationship between a man and more than one\nwoman (the concubines). Kant takes concubinage to be a purely sexual\nrelationship in which all parties aim at the satisfaction of their\nsexual desires (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 166). The inequality\nthat is involved in this relationship makes it problematic. Kant\nexplains that \u201cthe woman surrenders her sex completely to the\nman, but the man does not completely surrender his sex to the\nwoman\u201d (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 169). Since body and\nself are for Kant inseparable and together they constitute the person,\nin surrendering her body (her sex) exclusively to her male partner,\nthe woman surrenders her whole person to the man, allowing him to\npossess it. The man, by contrast, who has more than one sexual\npartner, does not exclusively surrender himself to the woman, and so\nhe does not allow her to possess his person. In allowing her male\npartner to possess her person, without herself being able to similarly\npossess his person, Kant believes that eventually the concubine (and\nthis also applies to the woman in any other polygamous relationship,\nincluding polygamous marriage) loses her person and is made\n\u2018into a thing\u2019 (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n166).\n\nThe only relationship in which two people can exercise their sexuality\nwithout the fear of reducing themselves to objects is monogamous\nmarriage. Monogamy is required to ensure that there is\nequality and reciprocity in the surrender and ownership of the two\nspouses\u2019 persons. The spouses exclusively surrender their\npersons to one another, so neither of them is in danger of losing his\nor her person and becoming an object. This perfect equality and\nreciprocity between the spouses is described by Kant as follows:\n\u201c\u2026 if I yield myself completely to another and obtain the\nperson of the other in return, I win myself back; I have given myself\nup as the property of another, but in turn I take that other as my\nproperty, and so win myself back again in winning the person whose\nproperty I have become. In this way, the two persons become a unity of\nwill\u201d (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 167). Furthermore, this\nmutual exchange of the two spouses\u2019 persons must, for Kant, be\nlegally enforced. Kant explains that marriage is\n\u201csexual union in accordance with law\u201d (Kant 1797, 62). He\nwants something external, namely, the law, to guarantee this lifelong\nownership of the two parties\u2019 persons in marriage. He argues\nthat this legal obligation to surrender one\u2019s person to\none\u2019s spouses makes marriage different from a monogamous\nrelationship between two unmarried partners.\n",
