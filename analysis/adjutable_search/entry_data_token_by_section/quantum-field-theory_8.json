Axiomatic Reformulations of QFT and their Interpretive Significance\n\nThere are three main motives for reformulating conventional QFT. The\nfirst motive is operationalism, the second one mathematical rigour and\nthe third one finding a way to deal with the availability of\ninequivalent Hilbert space representations for systems with an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom, such as fields. While in\nprinciple the three motives are independent of one another there are\nmultiple interconnections in their actual implementation. One way in\nwhich the three motives are connected is the following: In QFT the\nquests for operationalism and mathematical rigour seem to go hand in\nhand, i.e., the best means to achieve one is also the best way to\nachieve the other. Moreover, it leads to an algebraic formulation that\navoids privileging one amoung various available inequivalent\nrepresentations, which tacitly happens in conventional QFT.\n",
