    "main_text": "Some Broader Implications of Chaos || Chaos and Determinism\n7.1 Chaos and Determinism\n\nRecall that mathematically, chaos is a property of dynamical systems\nwhich are deterministic (\u00a71.2.1). Since\nthe 18th century, the best models of and support for metaphysical\ndeterminism were thought to be the determinism of theories and models\nin physics. But this strategy is more problematic and subtle than has\nbeen typically realized (e.g., due to the difficulties with faithful\n models, \u00a73.). So perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that some have argued that chaos reflects some form of\nindeterminism; hence, the world is not metaphysically\ndeterministic. Of course, chaotic systems are notorious for their\nunpredictability, and some such as Karl Popper (1950) have argued that\nunpredictability implies indeterminism. Yet this is to identify\ndeterminism (an ontological property) with predictability (an\nepistemic property).\n\n\nAn example of someone who has pushed the claim that chaotic behavior\nimplies that determinism fails for our word is physicist turned\nAnglican priest, John Polkinghorne: \u201cThe apparently\ndeterministic proves to be intrinsically unpredictable. It is\nsuggested that the natural interpretation of this exquisite\nsensitivity is to treat it, not merely as an epistemological barrier,\nbut as an indication of the ontological openness of the world of\ncomplex dynamical systems\u201d (1989, p. 43). Giving a critical\nrealist reading of epistemology and ontology, Polkinghorne seeks to\nlink the epistemological barrier with an ontological failure of\ndeterminism because of ontological openness to influences not fully\naccounted for in our physics descriptions. Nevertheless, the\nmathematical properties of dynamical systems (e.g., their\ndeterministic character) present a serious problem with this line of\nreasoning. Determinism as unique evolution appears to be preserved in\nour mathematical models of chaos, which serve as our ontic\ndescriptions of chaotic\n systems.[14]\n\n\nWhat would it take to raise questions about the determinism of\nactual-world systems? For nonlinear dynamical systems, their presumed\nconnection with target systems is one place to start. Mathematical\nmodeling of actual-world systems requires distinctions between\nvariables and parameters as well as between systems and their\nboundaries. However, where linear superposition is lost such\ndistinctions become problematic (Bishop 2010a). This situation raises\nquestions about our epistemic access to systems and models in the\ninvestigation of complex systems, but also raises questions about\ninferring the supposed determinism of target systems based on these\nmodels. Moreover, if the system in question is nonlinear, then the\nfaithful model assumption (\u00a71.2.3)\nraises difficulties for inferring the determinism of the target system\nfrom the deterministic character of the model.\n\n\nConsider the problem of the mapping between the model and the target\nsystem. There is no guarantee that this mapping is one-to-one even for\nthe most faithful model. The mapping may actually be a many-to-one\nrelation or a many-to-many relationship. A one-to-one relationship\nbetween a deterministic model and target system would make the\ninference from the deterministic character of our mathematical model\nto the deterministic character of the target system more\nsecure. However, a many-to-one mapping raises problems. One might\nthink this can be resolved by requiring the entire model class in a\nmany-to-one relation be deterministic. Such a requirement is\nnontrivial, though. For instance, it\u2019s not uncommon for different\nmodeling groups to submit proposals for the same project, where some\npropose deterministic models and others propose nondeterministic\nmodels. Nonlinear models render any inferences from physics to\nmetaphysical determinism shaky at best.\n\n",
