    "main_text": "Bodin\u2019s Politics: Sovereignty or Absolutism?\n4. Bodin\u2019s Politics: Sovereignty or Absolutism?\nBodin\u2019s major work, the Six Books of the Commonwealth, is\na treatment of \u201cpolitical science,\u201d a term which Bodin\njustly claimed he has coined.  The books are titled:\n\n\nThe Final End of the Well-ordered Commonwealth \nOf the Different Kinds of Commonwealth \nThe Council \nThe Rise and Fall of Commonwealths \nThe Order to be Observed in Adapting the Form of the\n Commonwealth to the Diverse Condition of Men and the Means of\nDetermining their Dispositions\nThe Census and the Censorship.\n\n\n\n  Bodin\u2019s primary contribution to political science of his day is his\ndefinition of sovereignty.  Sovereignty, he contends, has an impact\nupon both the internal affairs of the State (such as in its exercise\nof full political power) as well as its external affairs (such as in\nits conduct of war and international relations). \u201cMajesty or\nsovereignty is the most high, absolute, and perpetual power over the\ncitizens and subjects in a Commonwealth, which the Latins call\nMajestas\u201d (R\u00e9publique, I, 8 [Mc] 84). Bodin\u2019s\ndiscussion of tyrannicide is consistent with his political theory. For\ninstance, while he states that there are instances when tyrannicide is\njustified (for example against tyrannical usurpers), killing a prince\npresumed to be a tyrant is forbidden if \u201cthe prince is an\nabsolute sovereign.\u201d Bodin explains (R\u00e9publique\nII, 5): \n\n If the prince is an absolute sovereign, as are the true kings of\nFrance, Spain, England, Scotland, Ethiopia, Turkey, Persia and\nMuscovy, whose authority is unquestionably their own, and not shared\nwith any of their subjects, then it is in no circumstances permissible\neither by any of their subjects in particular, or in general, to\nattempt anything against the life and honor of their king, either\nby process of law or force of arms, even though he has committed all\nthe evil, impious and cruel deeds imaginable. (see [To] and [Mc] 222)\n \n\n\nBodin paid particular attention to differentiating between the forms\nof State and the forms of government.  For instance he defined a\nmonarchy as the rule of one; aristocracy as the rule of a few; and\ndemocracy as the rule by all people. Yet monarchies might still be\ndemocracies according to Bodin, if the prince allows all of the people\nto have access to magistracies and State offices without regard for\nnobility, wealth, or virtue. Otherwise, a monarchy can be a form of\naristocracy if the prince bestows State responsibilities only to the\nmost noble, the richest, or the most virtuous. The same observations\nhold true for aristocratic and popular regimes. \n\n\nThe distinctions between the forms of State and the forms of\ngovernment are essential for understanding the differences between\nroyal monarchies, despotic monarchies, and tyrannical monarchies. The\nlast two are easily confused.  Bodin writes\n(R\u00e9publique II, 2): \n \n Despotic monarchy must not be confused with tyranny. There is nothing\nunfitting in a prince who has defeated his enemies in a good and just\nwar, assuming an absolute right to their possessions and their persons\nunder the laws of war, and thereafter governing them as his slaves;\njust as the head of a household is the master of his slaves and their\ngoods, and disposes of them as he thinks fit, under the law of\nnations. But the prince who by an unjust war, or any other means,\nenslaves a free people and seizes their property is not a despot but a\ntyrant.  (see [To]; cf. [Mc] 201)\n \n\n\nThe difference between despotism and tyranny is crucial.  Despotism\nis legitimate and sometimes legal.  Tyranny, on the other hand, is\nalways illegitimate, illegal, and contrary to natural and divine laws.\nTherefore Bodin demonstrates that he is in process of constructing his\ntheory of sovereignty not that of despotism. The same can be observed\nconcerning absolute monarchies. When Bodin used the adjective\n\u201cabsolute\u201d to define a sovereign, he did so as a Romanist,\nand as an historian of Roman law for whom the word absolutus\nwas linked to legibus solutus\u2014the prerogative of the\none who is sovereign. One must pay close attention to Bodin\u2019s writing\nto understand his concept of \u201cabsolute.\u201d For Bodin a\nsovereign is \u201cnot bound\u201d (absolutus) by the civil\nor positive laws which he or his predecessors had\npromulgated. Nevertheless a sovereign is always bound to natural and\ndivine law.  Sovereignty, according to Bodin, is as supreme as one\nwishes, but is also limited by natural and divine law.  The Kings of\nFrance were glorious because their sovereignty was limited by divine\nand natural law (cf. Methodus, [Me] 208\u2013209).  Unfortunately,\nwith the introduction of the word \u201cabsolutism\u201d in the\nnineteenth century, historians of political philosophy began to\nconsider Bodin as a theoretician of absolutism. This is a tendency\nthat continues even today.  In so doing, some historians have ascribed\na doctrine to Bodin that was foreign to him. Instead Bodin\nsystematized and defined a theory of sovereignty. But this problem\nof historical interpretation depends on the methodology and on the\nsynchronic and diachronic perspective: when historians do not compare\nBodin to Machiavelli, they study often Bodin in comparison to those\nwho came after him: Grotius, Althusius, Locke, and particularly\nHobbes, Montesquieu and Rousseau. Nothing should stop the historian\nfrom making such comparisons as long as it is not his or her sole\nmethod of analysis. As all historians understand, in order to fully\nand accurately understand an author, it is necessary to place his work\nsquarely within the context and debates of his historical\nperiod. Therefore one should judge and interpret Bodin based on the\nworks, sources, and documents current in his century rather than on\nthose that would appear in the future.\n",
