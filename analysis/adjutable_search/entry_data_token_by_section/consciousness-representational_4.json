In the\nprevious section, it was assumed that the putative representata are\nenvironmental features such as the colors of physical objects. But\nothers have been suggested (Byrne (2001), Levine (2003)): e.g.,\nperceptual experience might instead represent sense-data, or\nnonexistent colorish properties that physical objects do not really\nhave. Shoemaker (1994) defends the view that a color experience\nrepresents a dispositional property, viz., the disposition to cause an\nexperience of just that type. (Kriegel (2002b) and Levine (2003)\ndefend versions of Shoemaker\u2019s view in order to keep sensory\nqualities narrow and to handle various inversion cases.) On one\ninterpretation at least, Thau (2002) posits a special sort of\nquasi-color property, distinct from but related to actual colors.\n\nNotice that even on the straightforward view that the representata are\nthe ostensible colors of physical objects, the representational theory\ndoes not presuppose color realism. It is true that we have been using\ncolor words such as \u201cgreen\u201d to mean public properties of\nphysical objects, and one could not (without circularity) explicate\nphenomenal greenness in terms of represented real-world public color\nand then turn around and construe the latter real physical greenness\nas a mere disposition to produce sensations of phenomenal greenness,\nor in any other way that presupposed phenomenal greenness. But one may\nhold an error theory of physical color, taking the colors of physical\nobjects to be ultimately illusory, and yet maintain that physical\ncolor concepts are explanatorily and/or conceptually prior to\nphenomenal ones.\n\n(There can be more general issues, in other sense modalities, of\nidentifying the relevant worldly representata. E.g., Gray (2003)\nargues that sensations of heat represent neither heat, nor\ntemperature, nor conductivity, nor energy.)\n\nChalmers (2004) calls attention to the distinction between Russellian\ncontents and Fregean contents. The former can be a singular\nproposition or a configuration of objects and their properties. Though\nthe proposition may be believed (etc.) under a mode of presentation,\nthe mode of presentation is not part of the content itself. By\ncontrast, a Fregean content includes the mode of presentation, and\ndoes not include individual objects themselves. Representationalists\nhave most often thought in Russellian terms about perceptual contents,\nbut Chalmers argues that the content of a perceptual experience is\nFregean. Because it neglects the objects themselves, the Fregean\noption would lend itself to a narrow representationalist account, if\nsuch is wanted; also, it helps to accommodate inversion examples\n(Section 4.4).\n",
