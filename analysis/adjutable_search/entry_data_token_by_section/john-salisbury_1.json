    "main_text": "Classical Philosophical Sources\n2. Classical Philosophical Sources\n\nIt was once supposed that John of Salisbury was \u201cthe best-read\nman of the twelfth century\u201d (Poole 1932: 191). Janet Martin,\nhowever, has convincingly demonstrated that much of John\u2019s\nfamiliarity with Latin (and, to some extent, Greek) classics derived\nfrom so-called florilegia, collections of brief passages\n(Martin 1977, 1979, 1984). These compilations were probably readily\navailable in the extensive (pre-Reformation) library of Christ Church\nmonastery, attached to Canterbury Cathedral. This does not mean that\nJohn lacked direct acquaintance with ancient philosophical texts and\nideas. At minimum, a list of his personal library (which he left to\nChartres Cathedral, where he served as bishop from 1176 to 1180)\nmentions Cicero\u2019s De officiis and De oratore,\nSeneca\u2019s Naturalium quaestionum libros, and Valerius\nMaximus (Webb 1932: 65\u201369). Of course, John knew many more\nancient Latin authors and texts than those contained in his own\ncollection. In addition to Christ Church\u2019s library, John\u2019s\ntravels afforded him access to considerable textual resources.\nMoreover, intellectuals of the time often traded volumes or\ncommissioned copies thereof. Hence, the Latin philosophers, especially\nCicero and Seneca, enjoyed wide dissemination during the twelfth\ncentury, and John relied heavily upon them (see the comprehensive\noverview by Hermand-Schebat 2015).\n\nAmong the Greek philosophers, John\u2019s knowledge was meager at\nbest, if only because the language of ancient Greece was almost\nentirely absent in the Latin West during the twelfth century. Until\nthe dissemination of Latin translations of the Aristotelian corpus,\nand a few works by Plato, over the course of the thirteenth century,\nlittle in the way of acquaintance was possible. The only one of\nPlato\u2019s texts that John could have accessed was the\nTimaeus in the partial translation by Calcidius; among\nAristotle\u2019s writings, he clearly was somewhat familiar with the\nsix books of the Organon, which formed the foundation for the\nAristotelian logical and \u201cscientific\u201d system. In an\nundated letter to his former teacher Richard of\nl\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque, John expresses interest in acquiring\n(unspecified) works by Aristotle (JL2: 294\u201395). (Bloch 2012\noffers a thorough analysis of the technical aspects of John\u2019s\nuse of classical sources in his philosophy, with special, but not\nexclusive, attention to Aristotle.)\n\nYet John clearly knew a great deal more about the doctrines of the\nclassical Greek philosophers than this account might indicate. There\nwere a number of Latin-language writers who transmitted to the Middle\nAges accounts of Greek philosophical teachings, including Apuleius,\nCalcidius, Cicero, Seneca, Lactantius, and St. Augustine (O\u2019Daly\n2018). Thus, for example, John was aware of the existence of\nPlato\u2019s Republic and some of its leading ideas, even\nthough that text did not circulate in Europe until the fifteenth\ncentury (Dutton 1983; PC: 54, 137). He was also able to make\nconsiderable reference to Epicurus, albeit primarily filtered through\nthe highly critical writings of Cicero and other Latin authors\n(Nederman and Bollermann 2011). And, the translated texts of ancient\nGreek thinkers sometimes contained passing references to other of\ntheir philosophical precepts, forming so-called\n\u201cunderground\u201d sources (a term applied to John by Nederman\nand Br\u00fcckmann 1983: 228\u201329). One instance of this is\nJohn\u2019s use of key elements of Aristotelian ethical theory in his\nmajor writings, nearly one hundred years before the circulation of a\nLatin version of the Nicomachean Ethics, explicable by\nAristotle\u2019s occasional references to his moral principles in the\nOrganon (Nederman 1997).\n\nDespite the relative paucity of John\u2019s access to ancient\nphilosophical writings, he pieced together a great deal of information\nabout the ideas posited by their authors. This was central to\nJohn\u2019s vision of his intellectual enterprise. In a famous\ncomment in the Metalogicon, John speaks of the heritage to\nwhich he owes a great debt:\n\n\n\u2026 our age enjoys the benefit of the age preceding, and often\nknows more than it, not indeed because our intelligence outstrips\ntheirs, but because we depend on the strength of others and on the\nabundant learning of our ancestors. Bernard of Chartres used to say\nthat we are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants so that we\nare able to see more and further than they, not indeed by the\nsharpness of our own vision or the height of our bodies, but because\nwe are lifted up on high and raised aloft by the greatness of giants.\nWith these words I will readily concur\u2026. (ML: 257)\n\n\nWhile what John owes to the great Christian theologians of the past\nshould by no means be diminished, he clearly and stridently viewed\nhimself as heir to the ancient traditions of philosophical inquiry.\nFor this reason, among others, the term \u201chumanist\u201d has\nbeen bestowed upon him (by Leibsch\u00fctz 1950 and more recently\nNederman 2005: 41\u201343, but challenged by Olsen 1998 and later\nBloch 2012: 61). The issue is not whether John read his classical\npredecessors \u201caccurately\u201d, but how he found inspiration in\nand adapted them in such a manner as to defend and further his own\nendeavors as a philosopher.\n",
