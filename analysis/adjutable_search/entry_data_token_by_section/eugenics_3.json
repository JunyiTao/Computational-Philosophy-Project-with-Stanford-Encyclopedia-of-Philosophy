Criticisms of \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics\n\n\nGiven the historical horrors associated with\neugenics, it should be unsurprising that criticisms of liberal eugenics\n\u2013 whether regarding permission or obligation \u2013 are numerous and\nvaried. Proponents have tried to address some of those criticisms in\nmore or less convincing ways. In this section, we discuss some of the\nmost significant criticisms that have been presented against liberal\neugenics.\n\n\nSome critics point out the difficulty of making\nmeaningful comparisons about what is the \u201cbest\u201d life (de\nMelo Martin 2004; Parker 2007).  Other theorists \u2013 attentive\nto pervasive unjust discrimination in respect to sexism, racism,\nclassism, and heterosexism \u2013 emphasize the broadly negative\nconsequences of promoting or allowing liberal eugenic policies, given\nthe aggregation of many individual choices, and the slippery slope to\nan older style of coercive eugenics (Duster 1990; Sparrow 2011a). When\nsome parents insist that eliminating a trait will increase their\nchild\u2019s relative freedom and the group of people who live with that\ntrait point to the ways in which that choice contributes to and\nreinforces social prejudice against their group (Lane and Grodin 1997;\nSaxton 2000; Asch 2000; Kaposy 2018), how are we to proceed with the\nregulation of \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics?  Other critics call\nattention to the problematic conceptions of disability that underlie\nmany of the arguments as well as the negative effects liberal eugenics\nis likely to have on existing people with disabilities (Asch 1999;\nSaxton 2000; Amundson 2005). Still other critics highlight potential\ndamage to some core values, such as our conception of ourselves\n(Habermas 2003), what it means to be human (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003),\nand the parent-child relationship. When parents attempt to design their\nchildren, critics argue, they demonstrate a lack of humility in the\nface of nature, and more specifically, an attempt to control where they\nshould instead appreciate what is given (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003).\n",
