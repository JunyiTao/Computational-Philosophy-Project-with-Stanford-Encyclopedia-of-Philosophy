    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nCompared to the many biographical accounts of Addams\u2019 life, relatively\nfew comprehensively consider her philosophy. However, her\nphilosophical insights are closely tied to her life experiences which\nare briefly recounted below.\n\nLaura Jane Addams was born in Cedarville, Illinois, on September 6,\n1860. She grew up in the shadow of the Civil War and during a time\nwhen Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species achieved widespread\ninfluence. Her childhood reflected the material advantage of being the\ndaughter of a politician and successful mill owner, John Addams. When\nJane was two years old, her mother, Mary, died giving birth to her\nninth child. Subsequently, the precocious Addams doted upon her father\nand benefited emotionally and intellectually from his attention.\nAlthough John Addams was no advocate of feminism, he desired higher\neducation for his daughter. Therefore, he sent her to the\nall-women\u2019s institution, Rockford Seminary (renamed later\nRockford College) in Rockford, Illinois. As a result, Addams became\npart of a generation of women that were among the first in their\nfamilies to attend college. At Rockford, she experienced the\nempowerment of living in a women-centered environment, and she\nblossomed as an intellectual and a social leader. Her classmates and\nteachers acknowledged this leadership. Ultimately, Addams spearheaded\nan effort to bring baccalaureate degrees to the school and, after\nserving as class valedictorian, received the first one.\n\nLike many women of her time, Addams\u2019 prospects after college\nwere limited. She made a failed attempt at medical school and then,\nprecipitated by her father\u2019s death, slipped into a nearly decade-long\nmalaise over the direction of her life. At first, the energy and\nspirit of her undergraduate college experience did not translate into\nany clear career path, given that she had rejected both marriage and\nreligious life. Moreover, Addams\u2019 malady was somewhat analogous\nto the unidentified illness that her later acquaintance, Charlotte\nPerkins Gilman (as described in The Yellow Wallpaper),\nsuffered. As a member of the privileged class, her soul searching\nincluded a trek to Europe, which Addams made twice during this period.\nOn the second trip, she visited Toynbee Hall, a pioneering Christian\nsettlement house in London, which was to inspire her in a direction\nthat propelled her toward international prominence (TYH 53).\n\nToynbee Hall was a community of young men committed to helping the\npoor of London by living among them. After engaging the leaders of\nToynbee Hall, Addams was rejuvenated by the idea of replicating the\nsettlement in the United States. She enlisted a college friend, Ellen\nGates Starr, in the plan. However, identifying their vague idea as a\n\u201cplan\u201d is a bit of hyperbole. There were very few specific\nblueprints for what the settlement would be other than a good neighbor\nto oppressed peoples. Nevertheless, Addams found a suitable\nlocation in a devastatingly poor Chicago immigrant neighborhood, and\non September 18, 1889, Hull House opened its doors. Working amidst one\nof the most significant influxes of immigrants the United States has\never known, Hull House got off to a slow start as neighbors did not\nknow what to make of the residents and their intentions. However,\nAddams and Starr built trust, and in a short time, Hull\nHouse became an incubator for new social programs and a magnet\nfor progressives wanting to make society a better place. Without\nformal ideological or political constraints, the settlement workers\nresponded to the neighborhood\u2019s needs by starting project after\nproject. The list of projects created at Hull House is astounding,\nincluding the first little theatre and juvenile court in the United\nStates and the first playground, gymnasium, public swimming pool, and\npublic kitchen in Chicago. In addition, the work of Hull House\nresidents would result in numerous labor union organizations, a labor\nmuseum, tenement codes, factory laws, child labor laws, adult\neducation courses, cultural exchange groups, and the collection of\nneighborhood demographic data. Hull House was a dynamo of progressive\ninitiatives, all of which Addams oversaw.\n\nThe reputation of the settlement rapidly grew, and women, primarily\ncollege-educated, came from all over the country to live and work\nat Hull House. Although Hull House was co-educational, it was a\nwoman-identified space. There were male residents at Hull House, some\nof whom later became prominent leaders. However, the policies,\nprojects, decision-making, and methodologies of the Hull House\ncommunity were gynocentric\u2014foregrounding women\u2019s\nexperience, analysis, and concerns. Furthermore, although a few\nresidents were married, most were single, and some were in committed\nrelationships with other women. Given the drastic shifts in sexual\nmores in the twentieth century, the contemporary understanding of what\nit means to be lesbian cannot straightforwardly be mapped onto the\nlate and post-Victorian eras. Still, it can be argued that Hull\nHouse was a lesbian-friendly space. Addams set the tone for this\nidentification with her own long-term intimate relationships with\nwomen, first with Starr and then with Mary Rozet Smith (Brown,\n2004).\n\nFrom the outset of its operation, Addams theorized about the nature\nand function of Hull House. The language she used reflected her\nphilosophical approach. For example, in one published essay, Addams\ndescribes the application and reorganization of knowledge as the\nfundamental problem of modern life and then claims that settlements\nare like applied universities: \u201cThe ideal and developed\nsettlement would attempt to test the value of human knowledge by\naction, and realization, quite as the complete and ideal university\nwould concern itself with the discovery of knowledge in all\nbranches\u201d (FSS 187). This kind of reflective analysis and wider\nthematization of her work and the social settlement work was a\nhallmark of Addams\u2019 writing. Because of her insightful\nreflections on the Hull House community, Addams became a popular\nauthor and sought-after public speaker. Eventually, she extended her\ncosmopolitan analysis to race, education, and world peace issues.\nFor Addams, local experiences were always a springboard for political\ntheorizing.\n\nAddams became one of the most respected and recognized individuals in\nthe nation. She played a crucial role in numerous progressive\ncampaigns. Addams was a founding figure in the National Association\nfor the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and\nFreedom. Her popularity was such that when Theodore Roosevelt sought\nthe presidential nomination of the Progressive Party in 1912, he asked\nJane Addams to second the nomination, the first time a woman had\nparticipated in such an act. There was a gendered dimension to this\npopularity, however. Addams had challenged the borders of the public\nand private spheres through her work at Hull House. Still, her\nforays into masculine domains were masked by the \u201csocial\nhousekeeping\u201d characterization of the settlement activism. After\nWorld War I broke out in Europe, her outspoken pacifism and refusal to\nendorse the war or the U.S. entry into it was more gender role\ntransgression than the public could tolerate from a woman.\nAddams\u2019 popularity fell, and she became the victim of vicious\ngender-specific criticism. Biographer Allen Davis reports that one\nwriter indicated that what Addams needed to disabuse her of her\npacifism was \u201ca strong, forceful husband who would lift the\nburden of fate from her shoulders and get her intensely interested in\nfancy work and other things dear to the heart of women who have homes\nand plenty of time on their hands\u201d (240). A reporter for the\nLos Angeles Times quipped,\n\nIf Miss Addams and her peace mission are a sample of women in world\naffairs, I want to take it all back. I am sincerely sorry I voted for\nsuffrage. (Davis, 253)\n\n\nHer new role as social outcast and critic allowed the public\nphilosopher in Addams to reflect on the nature of citizenship and\npatriotism in her many books and articles\u2014some of which had\ndifficulty getting into print because she was perceived as\nanti-American. Although she had written on peace early in her public\ncareer (NIP), from 1914 through the end of her life, Addams\u2019\npublications became decidedly more focused on issues of peace and war,\nincluding two books exclusively dedicated to the topic (WH, PBT) and\nseveral books with sections devoted to the nature and politics of war\n(LRW, STY, MFJ). Although initially criticized, Addams\u2019 pacifist\ntenacity was ultimately lauded with the Nobel Peace Price (1931). In\nthe last years of her life, she spent less time at Hull House and more\ntime working for world peace and an end to racism. Addams died of\ncancer on May 21, 1935, leaving a tremendous intellectual legacy that\nhas yet to be fully explored.\n",
