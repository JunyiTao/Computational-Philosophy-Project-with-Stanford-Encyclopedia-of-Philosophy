    "main_text": "The Psychological Basis for a Theory of Value || Good and Evil as Modes of Thinking\n3.1 Good and Evil as Modes of Thinking\n\n\nBefore defining \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 formally,\nSpinoza at IV Preface regards good and evil as labels, \u201cmodes of\nthinking,\u201d that human beings apply to things but which really reveal\nlittle about the things to which they are applied: \nAs far as good and evil are concerned, they also indicate\nnothing positive in things, considered in themselves, nor are they\nanything other than modes of thinking, or notions we form because we\ncompare things to one another. For one and the same thing can be good,\nand [evil], and also indifferent. For example, Music is good for one\nwho is melancholy, [evil to] one who is mourning, and neither good nor\n[evil] to one who is deaf.\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cnothing positive in things\u201d means perhaps that an\nobserver of people would find that \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018evil\u2019, as people use them are two place predicates rather\nthan one place predicates. If Martha calls music evil, then, what that\nindicates to one who knows about the human use of these terms is that\nthe music is evil to Martha. Moreover, since the same music can be good\nor evil for different people, or for people in different states, the\ntwo-place predication reveals more about Martha than about the music.\nIt must be some fact about the person, rather than some fact about the\nthing called good or evil, that is of central importance to the\nunderstanding of the label.\n\n\nIIIp9s suggests that the fact about the person which the label\nreveals is her conative state:\nIt is clear that we neither strive for, nor will, neither\nwant, nor desire anything because we judge it to be good; on the\ncontrary, we judge something to be good because we strive for it, will\nit, want it, and desire it.\n\n\nSpinoza finds that the designation of a thing as good follows from a\nperson\u2019s conative state: Martha is averse to music and therefore she\ncalls it evil. Should the music become good to another person, or\nperhaps Martha herself in different circumstances, it would not be\nbecause the music has changed, but because the person\u2019s conative state\nis different: she desires the music. (This analysis of the good is\nsimilar to Hobbes\u2019s at Leviathan VI. Maimonides, another of\nSpinoza\u2019s influences, also has a similar analysis:\nGuide of the Perplexed, III, 13.)\n\nIIIp39s builds upon IIIp9s. There Spinoza writes that, \u201ceach\none, from his own affect, judges, or evaluates, what is good and what\nis [evil]\u2026So the greedy man judges an abundance of money best,\nand poverty worst. The ambitious man desires nothing so much as esteem\nand dreads nothing so much as shame.\u201d However, IIIp39s also uses\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of the affects to introduce new definitions of\ngood and evil:\nBy good here I understand every kind of joy, and whatever\nleads to it, and especially whatever satisfies any kind of longing,\nwhatever that may be. And by evil, every kind of sadness and especially\nwhat frustrates longing.\n\n\nIIIp28, the proposition establishing Spinoza\u2019s doctrine that human\nbeings desire whatever will bring joy and are averse to whatever will\nlead to sadness, allows Spinoza to connect the objects of any human\ndesire with joy or the avoidance of sadness. So, if it is true that we\ncall a thing good only if we desire it, then it will also be true that\nanything we call good will be joy or what leads to it. Understood in\nthis way, IIIp39s simply restates the doctrine of IIIp9s in light of\nIIIp28.\n\n\nHowever, Spinoza might be extending rather than merely restating his\nposition at IIIp39s. Every kind of joy we experience is not presumably\na result of conscious desire, and Spinoza allows at IIIP39s that these\ninstances of joy (i.e., those which do not satisfy any kind of\nlonging) are also good. On this view, not only is whatever Martha desires good\nfor her, but, in addition, anything which she does not desire but\nwhich nonetheless might bring her joy will also be good. Perhaps, for example, Martha will take delight in a view that she never anticipated, a serendipitous good. IIIp39s, so understood, identifies the good and evil for a person with broader\nclasses of things, and makes possible an analysis of good and evil in\nterms of something other than an individual person\u2019s current\ndesires. Because, in giving an account of the right way of living in\nParts IV and V, Spinoza presumably urges people to desire and do\nthings in a way different from what they desire and do already, this\nbroadening of the application of the terms \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018evil\u2019 (to apply to things other than what people\npresently desire or are averse to) contributes to the plausibility of\nhis ethical naturalism.\n",
