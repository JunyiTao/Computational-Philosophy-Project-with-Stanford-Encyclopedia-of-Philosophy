    "main_text": "Brief Characterisation of Brouwer\u2019s Intuitionism\n3. Brief Characterisation of Brouwer\u2019s Intuitionism\n\n\nBased on his philosophy of mind, on which Kant and Schopenhauer were\nthe main influences, Brouwer characterised mathematics primarily as\nthe free activity of exact thinking, an activity which is founded on\nthe pure intuition of (inner) time. No independent realm of objects\nand no language play a fundamental role. He thus strived to avoid the\nScylla of platonism (with its epistemological problems) and the\nCharybdis of formalism (with its poverty of content). As, on Brouwer\u2019s\nview, there is no determinant of mathematical truth outside the\nactivity of thinking, a proposition only becomes true when the subject\nhas experienced its truth (by having carried out an appropriate mental\nconstruction); similarly, a proposition only becomes false when the\nsubject has experienced its falsehood (by realizing that an\nappropriate mental construction is not possible). Hence Brouwer can\nclaim that \u201cthere are no non-experienced truths\u201d (Brouwer,\n1975, p.488).\n\n\nBrouwer was prepared to follow his philosophy of mind to its ultimate\nconclusions; whether the reconstructed mathematics was compatible or\nincompatible with classical mathematics was a secondary question, and\nnever decisive. In thus granting philosophy priority over traditional\nmathematics, he showed himself a revisionist. And indeed, whereas\nintuitionistic arithmetic is a subsystem of classical arithmetic, in\nanalysis the situation is different: not all of classical analysis is\nintuitionistically acceptable, but neither is all of intuitionistic\nanalysis classically acceptable. Brouwer accepted this consequence\nwholeheartedly.\n",
