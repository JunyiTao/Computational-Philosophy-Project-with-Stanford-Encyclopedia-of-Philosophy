At least, as we have seen, a Tarskian theory can be seen as\nshowing how the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by the\nsemantic properties of its parts. More generally, as we see in much of\nthe work of Davidson and of Dummett (e.g., 1959; 1976; 1983; 1991),\ngiving a theory of truth conditions can be understood as a crucial\npart of giving a theory of meaning. Thus, any theory of truth that\nfalls into the broad category of those which are theories of truth\nconditions can be seen as part of a theory of meaning. (For more\ndiscussion of these issues, see Higginbotham (1986; 1989) and the\nexchange between Higginbotham (1992) and Soames (1992).)\n\nA number of commentators on Tarski (e.g., Etchemendy, 1988; Soames,\n1984) have observed that the Tarskian apparatus needs to be understood\nin a particular way to make it suitable for giving a theory of\nmeaning. Tarski\u2019s work is often taken to show how to\ndefine a truth predicate. If it is so used, then whether or\nnot a sentence is true becomes, in essence, a truth of mathematics.\nPresumably what truth conditions sentences of a natural language have\nis a contingent matter, so a truth predicate defined in this way\ncannot be used to give a theory of meaning for them. But the Tarskian\napparatus need not be used just to explicitly define truth. The\nrecursive characterization of truth can be used to state the semantic\nproperties of sentences and their constituents, as a theory of meaning\nshould. In such an application, truth is not taken to be explicitly\ndefined, but rather the truth conditions of sentences are taken to be\ndescribed. (See Heck, 1997 for more discussion.)\n",
