    "main_text": "Infinity and the universe\n6. Infinity and the universe\n\nCosmological theory has gone through many phases and proposals over\nthe past 100 years. Some have included universes with infinite pasts\nand these were mentioned previously. However, for the past forty years\nthere has been a strong consensus on the modern big bang theory which\nhas a finite past. But even if the universe is temporally finite in\nthe past, it may well be spatially and materially infinite. If space\nis infinite and the cosmological principle is assumed to be valid, the\nuniverse will contain an infinite number of galaxies, stars, atoms and\neverything else. Such actual infinities not only cause philosophical\nand logical problems, they may also cause problems of a theological\nnature. In his thought experiment known as \u201cHilbert\u2019s\nhotel\u201d the famous mathematician David Hilbert argued that\n(countable) actual infinities are so bizarre that they cannot have\nanything to do with the real world we live in. In this thought\nexperiment, Hilbert imagines that he arrives at a hotel with an\ninfinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied. The desk clerk\nclaims nonetheless that there is a vacancy. He then proceeds to ask\neach guest to move to the room with the next highest number in the\nsequence (see Oppy 2006, 8; Kragh 2014, Other Internet Resources).\n\nHilbert himself was uninterested in religion, but later philosophers\nand theologians have occasionally used his peculiar hotel\napologetically, as an argument for the existence of God and also for\nthe finitude of the universe.\n\nThe theological problems related to an infinitely large universe are\nnot specifically related to modern physical cosmology but have been\ndiscussed since the early days of Christianity. On the other hand,\nthey may be seen as even more relevant today, when the favored\ncosmological model has zero curvature, meaning that space is flat.\nAlthough a flat cosmic space does not necessarily imply an infinite\nuniverse, many cosmologists assume that the universe is indeed\nspatially infinite.\n\nThe theological implications of an infinite universe were discussed by\nthe church fathers and, in greater detail, by Johannes Philoponus in\nthe sixth century. Many of the arguments were of the same kind as\nthose used in the attempts to prove the impossibility of a temporal\ninfinity. At the time of the scientific revolution it was commonly\nassumed that physical space cannot be truly infinite, only\nindefinitely large. Infinity was seen as a divine attribute not to be\nfound elsewhere; to claim that nature is infinite would be to endow it\nwith divinity, a heretical view characteristic of pantheism. While the\ngenerally accepted view among theists was, and to some extent still\nis, that an infinite universe is philosophically absurd and\ntheologically heretical, there was no consensus on the issue. In fact,\nseveral Christian thinkers, from Descartes in the seventeenth century\nthrough Kant in the eighteenth to Edward Milne in the twentieth, have\nargued that an infinite universe is in better agreement with\nGod\u2019s will and omnipotence than a finite one. According to\nMilne, \u201cIt requires a more powerful God to create an infinite\nuniverse than a finite universe; it requires a greater God to leave\nroom for an infinity of opportunities for the play of evolution than\nto wind up a mechanism, once and for all\u201d (Milne 1948, 233). The\ncorrelation between finitism and theism, and infinitism and atheism,\nshould be seen as historically contingent rather than justified by\neither scientific or theological reasons.\n\nDuring the early period of modern cosmology, relativistic models with\nzero or negative curvature were sometimes associated with materialism\nand atheism because they implied a universe of infinite size.\nConversely, Einstein\u2019s closed and finite universe was welcomed\nby theists. According to Ernest W. Barnes, the mathematically trained\nbishop of Birmingham, infinite space was \u201ca scandal to human\nthought,\u201d (Barnes 1931, 598). His argument was epistemic as well\nas theological: only if God\u2019s universe is finite can we hope to\nunderstand the full range of his activity. Lema\u00eetre thought\nlikewise that the universe had to be finite in order to be\ncomprehensible. In agreement with his later warning against the\n\u201cnightmare of infinite space\u201d (Kragh 2004, 139), both of\nhis two innovative cosmological models, the expanding model of 1927\nand the big-bang model of 1931, were spatially closed. The\nsteady-state model of the 1950s was not only unpopular among\nChristians because of its lack of a cosmic creation, but also because\nit implied a homogeneous universe of infinite extent. According to\nStanley Jaki, a Benedictine priest and historian of science, the\ninfinite universe is a scientific cover-up for atheism. Mormons do not\nagree, though, for they need a universe which is infinite in both time\nand space.\n\nThe present consensus model of a geometrically flat accelerating\nuniverse is usually taken to imply an infinite cosmos. The general\nattitude of cosmologists is to ignore the troublesome philosophical\nproblems and speak of the infinite universe as just an indefinitely\nlarge one. They rarely reflect on the weird epistemic consequences of\nan actual infinity and even more rarely on the theological\nconsequences. Ellis is an exception to the rule. He and his\ncollaborators have argued forcefully against an infinite universe,\nsuggesting that the flat space of the consensus model is probably an\nabstraction that does not hold physically (Ellis, Kirchner and Stoeger\n2004). If the universe is really infinite and uniform it can be (and\nhas been) argued that there will be an infinity of identical copies of\nall human beings and indeed of everything. Such a consequence, as\ndiscussed by Ellis, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth and others, clearly is\ntheologically disturbing.\n\nEven more disturbing, says Ellis, is that God may then not be able to\nkeep track of and give attention to the infinite number of beings in\nthe universe. Moreover, if there is a multitude of cosmic regions,\neach of which is inhabited with intelligent beings, one may need to\ncontemplate a multitude of Christ-figures, incarnations and\ncrucifixions. Ellis was not only willing to consider such a scenario,\nhe also thought that it strengthened the case for a finite universe,\nfor then \u201cwe would have to countenance only a finite number of\ncivilizations needing redemption. Surely an infinite number of\nChrist-figures must be too much, no matter how one envisages\nGod\u201d (Ellis 1993, 394).\n",
