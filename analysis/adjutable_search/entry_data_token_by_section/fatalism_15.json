    "main_text": "Theological Fatalism: Pike\u2019s argument and God\u2019s omniscience || An Ockhamist solution\n5.2 An Ockhamist solution\n\nOckham\u2019s answer to the problem of divine foreknowledge was to\ninvoke the difference between propositions which are really about the\npast (those that express \u201chard\u201d facts about the past) and\nthose which are verbally about the past but which are really in part\nabout the future (those that express \u201csoft\u201d facts about\nthe past). The crucial point was that, even if someone lacked the\npower to do something inconsistent with a hard fact about the past,\none might have the power to do something inconsistent with a soft fact\nabout the past. To make such a solution work in the case of the\nproblem posed by Pike\u2019s argument, it would be necessary to show,\nor at any rate to make it plausible, that to act in a way which was\ninconsistent with God\u2019s belief that Jones would mow the lawn in\n1/1/2000 was in fact open to Jones, because what he would be\nbringing about would be inconsistent with a soft fact about the past,\nnot a hard fact. The difficulty for this strategy, though, is to give\nan account of soft facts about the past, or at least a species of soft\nfacts about the past, which meets two conditions: (1) it makes it true\nthat what Jones would be bringing about would be inconsistent with a\nsoft fact of the right sort, and also (2) it is such that it is\nplausible (at any rate in advance of any fatalist proofs to the\ncontrary) that in the case of soft facts of that sort it is in\nprinciple possible at a later date to bring things about which are\ninconsistent with them. (The Introduction to Fischer 1989, and many of\nthe articles in it are relevant to these issues.)\n\nIt is easy enough to give an account of soft facts which fails,\napparently, to meet the second condition. For instance we might say\nthat the following makes it a soft fact that God believes that\nJones will mow the lawn: given the nature of God, the fact that God\nbelieves that Jones will mow the lawn entails and is entailed\nby the fact that Jones will mow the ;awn. But that would not help\nus to see how it would be possible to act in a way which is\ninconsistent with a soft fact of this sort, if we did not already have\nan answer to Pike\u2019s argument. \n\nIt is also, as we have seen in connexion with logical fatalism, easy\nenough to delineate a species of soft facts about the past\nwhich meet the second condition. We have already met an example\nof one such species: \u201cit was true in 1900 that there would be a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100.\u201d Another example is: \u201cit was true in 1900\nthat Jones would mow the lawn in 1/1/2000.\u201d These are cases where the\ntruth of the propositons is constituted, in part, by a fact about\nthe future. But it is difficult to see how the truth that God\nbelieves that Jones will mow the lawn is constituted, in part, by the\nfact that Jones mows the lawn. Another species of soft fact that would\nmeet the second condition is exemplified by, \u201cthe construction of\nStonehenge predated Jones\u2019s mowing of the lawn.\u201d The truth of this is\nconstitued by a relation the first element of which does not\nnecessitate the second element, and the second element of which\nis a future event (the relation of temporal prioriy, of course).\nBut it is difficult to see how the truth that God believes that Jones\nwill mow the lawn is constituted by a relation which something bears\nto Jones\u2019s mowing without necessitating it.\n\nThis is not to say that there could not be a solution in terns of soft\nfacts, but it is not at all obvious what such a solution would look\nlike.\n\nOf course, the prospects of providing a solution would be satisfying\nif it could be made plausible that in some cases it is in\npeople\u2019s powers to do things which are inconsistent with\nhard facts about the past, not just soft facts. But to take\nthat approach is, in effect, to abandon the idea of an Ockhamist\nsolution, and to move on to the next solution.\n",
