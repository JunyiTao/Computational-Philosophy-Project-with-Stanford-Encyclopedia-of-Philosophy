    "main_text": "Extensions of the Theory of Descriptions || Descriptive theories of proper names\n4.1 Descriptive theories of proper names\n\nIf the theory of descriptions can unburden us metaphysically in the\ncase of nondenoting expressions like \u2018the present king of\nFrance\u2019 can it do the same for us with nondenoting names like\n\u2018Pegasus\u2019? Perhaps, but there is no shortage of\ndifficulties.\n\nOne problem has to do with the fact that there is often no single\nshared description for certain fictions. Even a simple case like\n\u2018Santa Claus\u2019 presents difficulties here. Many people will\nassociate many different descriptions with the name \u2018Santa\nClaus\u2019. Which, if any of those descriptions is the correct one,\nand in what sense can we say that all the people deploying the name\n\u2018Santa Claus\u2019 and associating different descriptions with\nthe term are talking about the same thing? Complicating the matter\nfurther, others might not use the term \u2018Santa Claus\u2019 but a\nname like \u2018Saint Nick\u2019 or \u2018Babbo Natale\u2019, and\nassociate those terms with descriptions that converge to some degree\nwith typical Santa descriptions.\n\nAt best the Russellian can argue that others are in the same boat\nhere. Consider the option of non-existent objects. If such objects are\nindividuated by their properties then we can again ask which\nproperties the non-existent object Santa Claus is supposed to have.\nAnd is the Italian who deploys the term \u2018Babbo Natale\u2019\ntalking about the same nonexistent object as an American that deploys\nthe name \u2018Santa Claus\u2019? (See Everett and Hofweber (2000)\nand French and Wettstein (2001) for papers on these general issues,\nand see Zalta (1983, 1988) for a robust defense of the nonexistent\nobject strategy).\n\nOn the face of it then, a na\u00efve application of the descriptive\ntheory of names faces some serious difficulties. Devitt and Sterelney\n(1998, 48 ff.) catalogue them as follows:\n\nThe principled basis objection. There are a number of\ndifferent descriptions that people might associate with a name like\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019. An historian might favor the description of\n\u2018the teacher of Alexander the Great\u2019, a Catholic Church\nhistorian might know him under the description of \u2018the leading\ninfluence on Saint Aquinas\u2019, some philosophers might know him\nunder the description of \u2018the pupil of Plato and author of\nThe Metaphysics and The Nichomachean Ethics\u2019,\nPlato himself might have known him under the description \u2018the\nobnoxious student of mine.\u2019 Which of these descriptions is the\ncorrect one, what is the principled basis that determines which\ndescription is correct? \nThe unwanted ambiguity objection. Suppose that we respond to\nthe principled basis objection by letting many flowers bloom. That is,\nsuppose we argue that there is no single correct description\nassociated with the name but there are many. We now run into the teeth\nof the problem of unwanted ambiguity. Are there really that many\ndifferent names, each corresponding to an different description? If\nso, why does \u2018Aristotle was Aristotle\u2019 seem so much less\ninformative than \u2018the teacher of Alexander the Great was the\nleading influence on Saint Aquinas\u2019? \nThe unwanted necessity objection. Consider a sentence like\n\u2018Aristotle taught Alexander the Great\u2019. This seems to be a\ncontingent claim\u2014one that is true but matters could have gone\notherwise. Aristotle could have decided it was immoral to take the\nposition, or Phillip of Macedonia could have decided that Aristotle\nwas not the best tutor for his young Alexander. We can imagine\nnumerous possible worlds in which the sentence turns out to be false\n(unlike necessary claims like \u20185+7=12\u2019 which appear to be\ntrue in every possible world). But now consider this sentence with the\ndescription unpacked. We get something like \u2018The pupil of Plato\nand teacher of Alexander the Great taught Alexander the Great\u2019,\nand it seems that this would have to be true in every world in which\nsomeone satisfies the relevant description. The problem is that the\nRussellian analysis seems to turn a contingent proposition into a\nnecessary proposition. \n\n\nSearle (1958, 1969; 162 ff.) offers some modifications designed to\novercome these difficulties with the descriptive theory of names.\nConsider a name like \u2018Socrates\u2019. Is it really part of the\nmeaning of that name that its bearer drank hemlock, taught Plato and\ndid all of the other things that we are told that he did when we study\nthe history of philosophy? Searle suggests that we needn\u2019t\nassociate the meaning of a name with a description that contains all\nof these elements\u2014it might be enough that most of them hold, or\nthat a suitably weighted bundle of them hold. (Other versions of this\nidea were proposed in Strawson (1959; 180 ff.) and Wilson (1959).)\n\nHow does Searle\u2019s proposal help with the objections just listed?\nThe unwanted necessity objection collapses immediately because the use\nof a name does not commit the speaker to the object in question having\nall the properties in the bundle. When I say Aristotle authored the\nNichomachean Ethics it is as though I uttered the\nfollowing:\n\n(9) The individual who is associated with some significant number of\nthese properties (taught by Plato, taught Alexander, wrote the\nNichomachean Ethics, etc.) wrote the Nichomachean\nEthics.\n\n\nSomeone might be associated with this bundle of properties and not\nhave written the Nichomachean Ethics (so long as they had\nenough of the other properties).\n\nThe principled basis objection is supposed to collapse\nbecause there is now no issue of choosing which description is the\ncorrect one\u2014if the theologian, the historian, and the\nphilosopher all associate different descriptions and hence different\nproperties with Aristotle, all of those properties will make it into\nthe bundle of properties for the name \u2018Aristotle\u2019. We\ndon\u2019t need to worry about the principled basis for choosing the\nrelevant properties because we don\u2019t have to choose period. We\ntake them all.\n\nThe unwanted ambiguity objection is supposed to collapse\nbecause every use of the name \u2018Aristotle\u2019 is now\nassociated with the same bundle of properties. \u2018Aristotle is\nAristotle\u2019 is uninformative because it is shorthand for\n(10).\n\n(10) The individual who is associated with some significant number of\nthese properties (taught by Plato, taught Alexander, wrote the\nNichomachean Ethics, etc.) is the individual who is associated with\nsome significant number of these properties (taught by Plato, taught\nAlexander, wrote the Nichomachean Ethics, etc.).\n\n\nAs compelling as Searle\u2019s proposal may seem at first blush, it\nsoon runs into problems of its own. As Devitt and Sterelny observe,\nthe three objections to the traditional descriptive theory of names\ncome creeping back. For starters, one presumably doesn\u2019t want\nevery single fact about Aristotle to make it into the bundle of\nproperties that we associate with his name (that would lead us down\nthe path to an extreme holism in which every fact that we acquire\nchanges the meaning of the name), so what is the principled basis for\ndeciding what goes into the bundle? Worse, what is the principled\nbasis by which we weight the importance of the properties in the\nbundle?\n\nThe unwanted ambiguity objection returns as well if we allow that\ndifferent people will associate different bundles of properties with a\nname or at least weight those properties differently. One might be\ntempted to dodge this problem by arguing that the relevant bundle of\nproperties for a name is socially fixed and does not vary between\nindividuals, but then it is hard to see how names like\n\u2018Scott\u2019 and \u2018Sir Walter\u2019 could be associated\nwith different bundles of properties since the community as a whole is\nlikely to attribute the same bundle of properties (with the same\nweights) to these names. This is a problem, because different bundles\nof properties are needed to distinguish the differences in cognitive\nsignificance between \u2018Scott\u2019 and \u2018Sir Walter\u2019.\nThere is a dilemma then: one can avoid the problem of unwanted\nambiguity only at the expense of the problem of accounting for the\ncognitive significance of names.\n\nFinally, as Kripke (1980) argued, Searle\u2019s solution really\ndoesn\u2019t help with the problem of unwanted necessity. Aristotle\nmight have had none of the properties that we ordinarily associate\nwith his name. Searle certainly didn\u2019t think this was\npossible\u2014for him, if nothing had the properties in question (or\nenough of them) then Aristotle did not exist. But Kripke (ch. 2)\nenlisted a number of arguments to show that the behavior of names in\nmodal environments suggests otherwise. For example even if we concede\nthat Aristotle did all the things he was supposed to have done, it is\nstill the case that Aristotle could have refrained from doing any of\nthe things he did. He could have forsaken philosophy for other\npursuits. He could have been run over by a chariot at age two. But\nthen how do we make sense of a descriptive name in a sentence like\n(11)?\n\n(11) It could have happened that Aristotle was run over by a chariot\nat age two.\n\n\nIf the description is unpacked, we get something like (11\u2032).\n\n(11\u2032) It could have happened that the philosopher who was taught\nby Plato, taught Alexander, etc. was run over by a chariot at age two.\n\n\nBut (11\u2032) is false. There is no nearby possible world where\nAristotle did all those things by age two.\n\nKripke held that the behavior of names in these environments could\nonly be explained if we think of the names as being rigid\ndesignators\u2014i.e., as devices that rigidly pick out an individual\nacross possible worlds. Kripke also stressed that this is not really a\npoint about conditional or modal sentences\u2014the same point can be\nmade for simple declarative sentences evaluated in a counterfactual\nsituation. So, for example, take a simple sentence like (12).\n\n(12) Aristotle was run over by a chariot at age two.\n\n\nWe can evaluate this sentence in other possible worlds. We can say\nthat it might have been true under certain circumstances. But it does\nnot seem plausible that there is a nearby possible world where the\nfollowing is true.\n\n(13) The philosopher who was taught by Plato, taught Alexander, etc.\nwas run over by a chariot at age two.\n\n\nFinally, Donnellan (1972) and Kripke (1980) both argued that the\nDescriptive Theory of Names suffers from an important epistemological\ndefect. The descriptions that we associate with names routinely do not\ndescribe the individuals that we intend to refer to. Asked to come up\nwith a description to substitute for the name \u2018Einstein\u2019,\nmany people would write \u2018The inventor of the atom bomb\u2019\n(which of course he was not). Others might write \u2018the inventor\nof the theory of relativity\u2019, but then asked what the theory of\nrelativity was would respond \u2018the theory that Einstein\ninvented\u2019. The descriptive information that we associate with\nnames just is not sufficient to pick out the intended referent.\n\nKripke\u2019s positive proposal\u2014suggestion really\u2014was\nthat names are associated with a causal chain; there is an initial\nbaptism of an individual (e.g., Albert Einstein as \u2018Albert\nEinstein\u2019) and that referent is passed along to other users of\nthe name. Likewise the referent of \u2018Aristotle\u2019 is not\nfixed by some description, but by a causal chain linking our use of\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 with some historical individual. (This is not\nthe place for an extended discussion of this proposal, but see Devitt\n1981 and Salmon 1991 for development of this idea and Evans (1973,\n1980) for criticism.)\n\nIn spite of the great force of Kripke\u2019s criticism of the\ndescriptive theory of names, there have been some significant attempts\nto answer them. One idea (explored by Loar (1976), McDowell (1977),\nand Schiffer (1978)) would have the description be something like\n\u2018the individual designated by the name \u2018Aristotle\u2019.\nFor Kripke (1980), and Devitt (1981) this sort of approach was\nhopelessly circular. Indeed, Devitt and Sterelny disparagingly\nreferred to the position as \u201ccircular descriptivism\u201d (but\nsee Kroon (1989) for an attempt to disarm the circularity charge).\nAnother idea (taken up in Kroon (1987) and Jackson (1998)) was to\nbuild reference to the causal chain into the description itself. Thus,\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 might stand proxy for \u2018the individual\nlinked by a causal chain to \u2018Aristotle\u2019\u2019 (this view\nwas dubbed \u201ccausal descriptivism\u201d by Lewis (1984)).\nWhatever the merits of these views, they clearly abandon some of the\nkey motivations for the descriptive theories of names\u2014in\nparticular the idea that the description could do the work of\nproviding the sense of the name.\n\nStill, from a linguistic point of view, we should note that there are\nfeatures of names in natural language that make them appear to be\nsimilar to descriptions. Names can take determiners like\n\u2018a\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019 (indeed in some languages they\nroutinely do so), which suggests that they are behaving more like\nnouns than like saturated referring expression. Indeed it is a\nwidespread linguistic analysis of names that they have possibly empty\ndeterminer positions, so that a name like Aristotle has at a minimum\nthe following structure, which represents a syntactic structure for a\ndeterminer phrase having an empty determiner and the noun\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 as constituents:\n\n[DP [Det \u2205 ] [N Aristotle]]\n\n\nIn addition, Burge (1973) offered a number of arguments in support of\nthe idea that names really are predicates, and further support has\ncome from Hornsby (1976), Larson and Segal (1995) and Eluguardo\n(2002). (But see Boer (1975), Bach (1987), and Higginbotham (1988) for\ncriticism.)\n\nThe Burge story had the determiner as something like a bare\ndemonstrative. It is not a long step to the supposition that the\ndefault interpretation of the null element is to treat it as the\ndefinite determiner \u2018the\u2019. This is in effect the proposal\noffered in Larson and Segal (1995); \u2018Aristotle\u2019 stands in\nfor an incomplete definite description of the form \u2018the\nAristotle\u2019. In both cases, the predicate in question would be\nsomething like being named \u2018Aristotle\u2019, so again it is\ndifficult to see how this general approach (without emendation) can\nsatisfy Russell\u2019s desiderata that the description play the role\nof senses.\n\nAn alternative riff on these ideas which has been widely discussed,\nbut not, so far as I know, published, would be to suppose that there\nis a rigid property of being Aristotle\u2014one that only Aristotle\ncould have in any possible world (this property would be completely\nindependent of being named \u2018Aristotle\u2019). The idea is that\nthe content of the description could consist solely of that property.\nFor example, when we say that \u2018Aristotle might have been run\nover by a chariot\u2019 we would in effect be saying there is a\npossible world in which the unique individual who has the property of\nbeing Aristotle was run over by a chariot. It seems that charges of\ncircularity are not so easily advanced here, although the view does\nraise questions about the nature of these rigid properties and our\nepistemic access to them. (See Parsons (1982) for an account of the\nlogic of rigid properties.)\n\nAnother class of responses has attempted to retain the standard\ndescriptive content of names but moved to circumvent Kripke\u2019s\nmodal worries. Dummett (1973; 111\u2013135, 1981) and Sosa (1996; ch.\n3, 2001) proposed that the behavior of names in modal contexts can be\naccounted for if we take names to be descriptions with mandatory wide\nscope. So, for example, (11) could be taken to have the following\nlogical form.\n\n(11\u2033) [The x: x taught Alexander etc.]\npossibly (it was the case that x was run over by a chariot at\nage two)\n\n\nKripke discussed this possibility briefly in the Preface to (1980),\nholding that the move overlooks the fact that we can simply evaluate\n(12) in other possible worlds, hence no embedding within modal\noperators is really necessary. For that matter, consider a sentence\nlike \u2018(12) might have been true\u2019. How does a wide scope\nstory help us in this case? More recently, Soames (2002; ch. 2) has\nexpanded on Kripke\u2019s points and marshaled a number of additional\narguments against the wide scope thesis, including the observation\nthat if one embeds a name within a propositional attitude environment\nand in turn embeds the propositional attitude in a modal environment\nthen one is in the peculiar position of needing the description to\nescape the modal environment (to honor the rigidity facts) but not\nescape the propositional attitude environment (to honor the\n\u2018Scott\u2019/\u2018Sir Walter\u2019 cases that Russell (1905)\nemployed to motivate the descriptive theory of names). In other words,\nthe description theorists need to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nAnother possibility (considered in Nelson (2002)) would be to argue\nthat names are \u201crigidified descriptions\u201d (i.e.,\ndescriptions like \u2018The individual who actually was a student of\nPlato, taught Alexander, etc.\u2019 or perhaps rigidified causal\ndescriptions. This general strategy is criticized by Soames (2002; ch.\n2), who argues that \u2018the actual F is G\u2019\nand \u2018n is G\u2019, where n is a\nname, do not express the same proposition. The argument for this turns\non cases where these expressions are embedded in propositional\nattitude environments, as in (14a) and (14b).\n\n(14a) Smith believes that n is G.\n\n(14b) Smith believes that the actual F is G.\n\n\nAccording to Soames, there are contexts of utterance and worlds of\nevaluation where (14a) is true but (14b) is false. Accordingly,\n\u2018the actual F is G\u2019 and\n\u2018n is G\u2019 cannot express the same\nproposition. Hence names cannot be rigidified descriptions. See Nelson\n(2002) for a response to this argument.\u00a0(Accounts of rigidified\ndescriptions have been offered elsewhere,\u00a0see for example Zalta\n(1988; chapter 5), but typically not as a way to account for the\nbehavior of descriptions in propositional attitude environments.)\n\nYet another approach to defending descriptions would be to employ a\n\u201c2-dimensionalist\u201d semantics (in the sense of Stalnaker\n(1978, 1990), Davies and Humberstone (1980)) to account for the\nbehavior of descriptive names in modal environments. Some form of this\nidea has been offered by Evans (1982), Stanley (1997a, 1997b),\nChalmers (2000, 2002), and Jackson (1998). Here the basic idea is that\nthe content of a description picks out different contents in different\npossible worlds. Accordingly, if we want to evaluate the descriptive\ncontent of \u2018Aristotle\u2019 in another possible world, we do\nnot use the descriptive content \u2018student of Plato\u2026\u2019\nin every world, since that is only an appropriate descriptive content\nfor some worlds. In other worlds we will draw on other descriptive\ncontents. As Jackson (1998, 112) puts the idea:\n\nIf speakers can say what refers to what when various possible worlds\nare described to them, description theorists can identify the property\nassociated in their [the speaker\u2019s] minds with, for example, the\nword \u2018water\u2019: it is the disjunction of the properties that\nguide the speaker in each particular possible world when they say\nwhich stuff, if any, in each world counts as water. This disjunction\nis in their minds in the sense that they can deliver the answer for\neach possible world when it is described in sufficient detail, but it\nis implicit in the sense that the pattern that brings the various\ndisjuncts together as part of the, possibly highly complex,\ndisjunction may be one they cannot state.\n\n\nSoames (2009) has responded that this particular 2-dimensionalist\napproach is tantamount to the claim that descriptive theories of\nreference determination are priori irrefutable, since any evidence\nthat a term refers to an object is automatically taken to demonstrate\nthe existence of an implicit description in our minds that\nsuccessfully determines reference, whether or not we can successfully\nstate it. Additional criticism of 2-dimensionalism criticism can be\nfound in Block and Stalnaker (1998) and Byrne and Pryor (2006).\n",
