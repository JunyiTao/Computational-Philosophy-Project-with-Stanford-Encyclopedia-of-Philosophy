As explained in Section 2.1 above,\nseveral of Plato\u2019s dialogues criticize the view that virtues are\nmerely tendencies to act in particular ways. Bravery requires more\nthan standing up against threats to oneself and others. Bravery also\nrequires recognizing when standing up to these threats is reasonable\nand appropriate, and it requires acting on one\u2019s recognition.\nThis led the Greek moralists to conclude that virtuous traits of\ncharacter have two aspects: (a) a behavioral aspect \u2013 doing\nparticular kinds of action and (b) a psychological aspect \u2013\nhaving the right motives, aims, concerns, and perspective. The Greek\nphilosophers disagree mostly about what (b) involves. In particular,\nthey differ about the role played in virtuous traits of character by\ncognitive states (e.g., knowledge and belief) on the one hand and\naffective states (e.g., desires, feelings, and emotions) on the other.\nSocrates and the Stoics argued that only cognitive states were\nnecessary for virtue, whereas Plato and Aristotle argued that both\ncognitive and affective states were necessary.\nSocrates (469\u2013399 BCE)\n\nIn Plato\u2019s Protagoras, Socrates seems to identify\nhappiness with pleasure and to explain the various virtues as\ninstrumental means to pleasure. On this view (later revived by\nEpicurus, 341\u2013271 BCE), having a virtuous character is purely a\nmatter of being knowledgeable of what brings us more pleasure rather\nthan less. In the Protagoras, Socrates recognizes that most\npeople object to this view. The \u201cmany\u201d suppose that having\na virtuous character requires more than knowledge, because knowledge\ndoes not guarantee that one will act on one\u2019s knowledge and do\nthe virtuous action. Someone may be overcome by anger, fear, lust, and\nother desires, and act against what he believes will bring him more\npleasure rather than less. He can, in other words, be incontinent or\nweak-willed. Socrates replies that such cases should be understood\ndifferently. When, for example, a cowardly person flees from battle\nrather than endanger his life, even though he may seem to be pursuing\nthe more pleasant action, he is really just ignorant of the greater\npleasure to be achieved by entering battle and acting bravely. In\nother words, incontinence is not possible, according to Socrates. \nPlato (428\u2013347 BCE)\n\nThe \u201cmany\u201d\u2019s worry about the inadequacy of knowledge\nto ensure virtuous action suggests that virtuous character includes\nnot only a cognitive element, but also some affective element. Both\nPlato and Aristotle argue that virtuous character requires a\ndistinctive combination of cognitive and affective elements. In the\nRepublic, Plato divides the soul into three parts and gives\nto each a different kind of desire (rational, appetitive, or\nspirited). As types of non-rational desire, appetitive and spirited\ndesires can conflict with our rational desires about what contributes\nto our overall good, and they will sometimes move us to act in ways we\nrecognize to be against our greater good. When that happens, we are\nincontinent. To be virtuous, then, we must both understand what\ncontributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive\ndesires educated properly, so that they agree with the guidance\nprovided by the rational part of the soul. Plato describes the\neducation of the non-rational parts of the soul in Books II and III of\nthe Republic. A potentially virtuous person learns when young\nto love and take pleasure in virtuous actions, but must wait until\nlate in life to develop the understanding that explains why what he\nloves is good. Once he has learned what the good is, his informed love\nof the good explains why he acts as he does and why his actions are\nvirtuous. \n",
