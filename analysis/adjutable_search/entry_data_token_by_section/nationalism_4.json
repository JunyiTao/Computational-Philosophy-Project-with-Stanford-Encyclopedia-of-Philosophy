    "main_text": "The Moral Debate || Classical and liberal nationalisms\n3.1 Classical and liberal nationalisms\n\nRecall the initial normative question centered around (1) attitudes\nand (2) actions. Is national partiality justified, and to what extent?\nWhat actions are appropriate to bring about sovereignty? In\nparticular, are ethno-national states and institutionally protected\n(ethno-) national cultures goods independent from the individual will\nof their members, and how far may one go in protecting them? The\nphilosophical debate for and against nationalism is a debate about the\nmoral validity of its central claims. In particular, the ultimate\nmoral issue is the following: is any form of nationalism morally\npermissible or justified, and, if not, how bad are particular forms of\n it?[17]\n Why do nationalist claims require a defense? In some situations they\nseem plausible: for instance, the plight of some stateless national\ngroups\u2014the history of Jews and Armenians, the historical and\ncontemporary misfortunes of Kurds\u2014lends credence to the idea\nthat having their own state would have solved the worst problems.\nStill, there are good reasons to examine nationalist claims more\ncarefully. The most general reason is that it should first be shown\nthat the political form of the nation-state has some value as such,\nthat a national community has a particular, or even central, moral and\npolitical value, and that claims in its favor have normative validity.\nOnce this is established, a further defense is needed. Some classical\nnationalist claims appear to clash\u2014at least under normal\ncircumstances of contemporary life\u2014with various values that\npeople tend to accept. Some of these values are considered essential\nto liberal-democratic societies, while others are important\nspecifically for the flourishing of creativity and culture. The main\nvalues in the first set are individual autonomy and benevolent\nimpartiality (most prominently towards members of groups culturally\ndifferent from one\u2019s own). The alleged special duties towards\none\u2019s ethno-national culture can and often do interfere with\nindividuals\u2019 right to autonomy.\n\nLiberal nationalists are aware of the difficulties of the classical\napproach, and soften the classical claims, giving them only a\nprima facie status. They usually speak of \u201cvarious\naccretions that have given nationalism a bad name\u201d, and they are\neager to \u201cseparate the idea of nationality itself from these\nexcesses\u201d (Miller 1992, 2000). Such thoughtful pro-nationalist\nwriters have participated in an ongoing philosophical dialogue between\nproponents and opponents of the\n claim.[18]\n In order to help the reader find their through this involved debate,\nwe shall briefly summarize the considerations which are open to the\nethno-nationalist to defend their case (compare the useful overview in\nLichtenberg 1997). Further lines of thought built upon these\nconsiderations can be used to defend very different varieties of\nnationalism, from radical to very moderate ones.\n\nFor brevity, each line of thought will be reduced to a brief argument;\nthe actual debate is more involved than one can represent in a sketch.\nSome prominent lines of criticism that have been put forward in the\ndebate will be indicated in brackets (see Miscevic 2001). The main\narguments in favor of nationalism will be divided into two sets. The\nfirst set of arguments defends the claim that national communities\nhave a high value, sometime seen as coming from the interests of their\nindividual member (e.g., by Kymlicka, Miller, and Raz) and sometimes\nas non-instrumental and independent of the wishes and choices of their\nindividual members, and argues that they should therefore be protected\nby means of state and official statist policies. The second set is\nless deeply \u201ccomprehensive\u201d, and encompasses arguments\nfrom the requirements of justice, independent from substantial\nassumptions about culture and cultural values.\n\nThe first set will be presented in more detail since it has formed the\ncore of the debate. It depicts the community as the source of value or\nas the transmission device connecting its members to some important\nvalues. For the classical nationalist, the arguments from this set are\ncommunitarian in a particularly \u201cdeep\u201d sense since they\nare grounded in basic features of the human condition.\n\nThe general form of deep communitarian arguments is as follows. First,\nthe communitarian premise: there is some uncontroversial good (e.g., a\nperson\u2019s identity), and some kind of community is essential for\nacquisition and preservation of it. Then comes the claim that the\nethno-cultural nation is the kind of community ideally suited for this\ntask. Then follows the statist conclusion: in order for such a\ncommunity to preserve its own identity and support the identity of its\nmembers, it has to assume (always or at least normally) the political\nform of a state. The conclusion of this type of argument is that the\nethno-national community has the right to an ethno-national state and\nthe citizens of the state have the right and obligation to favor their\nown ethnic culture in relation to any other.\n\nAlthough the deeper philosophical assumptions in the arguments stem\nfrom the communitarian tradition, weakened forms have also been\nproposed by more liberal philosophers. The original communitarian\nlines of thought in favor of nationalism suggest that there is some\nvalue in preserving ethno-national cultural traditions, in feelings of\nbelonging to a common nation, and in solidarity between a\nnation\u2019s members. A liberal nationalist might claim that these\nare not the central values of political life but are values\nnevertheless. Moreover, the diametrically opposing views, pure\nindividualism and cosmopolitanism, do seem arid, abstract, and\nunmotivated by comparison. By cosmopolitanism we refer to moral and\npolitical doctrines claiming that\n\none\u2019s primary moral obligations are directed to all human\nbeings (regardless of geographical or cultural distance), and\npolitical arrangements should faithfully reflect this universal\nmoral obligation (in the form of supra-statist arrangements that take\nprecedence over nation-states).\n\n\nConfronted with opposing forces of nationalism and cosmopolitanism,\nmany philosophers opt for a mixture of liberalism-cosmopolitanism and\npatriotism-nationalism. In his writings, B. Barber glorifies \u201ca\nremarkable mixture of cosmopolitanism and parochialism\u201d that in\nhis view characterizes American national identity (Barber 1996: 31).\nCharles Taylor claims that \u201cwe have no choice but to be\ncosmopolitan and patriots\u201d (Taylor 1996: 121). Hilary Putnam\nproposes loyalty to what is best in the multiple traditions in which\neach of us participates, apparently a middle way between a\nnarrow-minded patriotism and an overly abstract cosmopolitanism\n(Putnam 1996: 114). The compromise has been foreshadowed by Berlin\n(1979) and Taylor (1989,\n 1993),[19]\n and in the last two decades it has occupied center stage in the\ndebate and even provoked re-readings of historical nationalism in its\n light.[20]\n Most liberal nationalist authors accept various weakened versions of\nthe arguments we list below, taking them to support moderate or\nultra-moderate nationalist claims.\n\nHere are then the main weakenings of classical ethno-nationalism that\nliberal, limited-liberal, and cosmopolitan nationalists propose.\nFirst, ethno-national claims have only prima facie strength\nand cannot trump individual rights. Second, legitimate ethno-national\nclaims do not in themselves automatically amount to the right to a\nstate, but rather to the right to a certain level of cultural\nautonomy. The main models of autonomy are either territorial or\nnon-territorial: the first involves territorial devolution; the\nsecond, cultural autonomy granted to individuals regardless of their\ndomicile within the\n state.[21]\n Third, ethno-nationalism is subordinate to civic patriotism, which\nhas little or nothing to do with ethnic criteria. Fourth,\nethno-national mythologies and similar \u201cimportant\nfalsehoods\u201d are to be tolerated only if benign and inoffensive,\nin which case they are morally permissible despite their falsity.\nFinally, any legitimacy that ethno-national claims may have is to be\nderived from choices the concerned individuals are free to make.\n",
