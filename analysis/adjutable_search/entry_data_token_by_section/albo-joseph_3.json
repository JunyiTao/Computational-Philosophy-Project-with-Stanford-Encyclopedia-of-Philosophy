    "main_text": "The Theory of Law\n4. The Theory of Law\n\n\nIn striving to formulate a list of the fundamental beliefs of religion\nfrom within his theory of principles (which we will explain in the\nnext section), Albo abandons the status quo of similar lists composed\nby his predecessors. Instead of naming the principles of Mosaic law\n(\u201cthe Torah of Moses\u201d) as, for example, Maimonides did in\nhis well-known list of thirteen principles, Albo widens his target and\nlists the principles of \u201cdivine law.\u201d By this term he\nrefers to the entire system of laws whose source is in the revelation\nof God to humanity. This change leads Albo to dedicate a particularly\nlong discussion (treatise 1, chapters 5\u20138) to the topic of the\nvarious types of law. Albo distinguishes three such types. The first\nof these is divine law, meaning a law whose origin is in divine\nrevelation, such as Judaism. The second type is conventional law, a\nsystem of laws that human beings establish by mutual agreement in\nnumerous political and social frameworks. Its purpose is to maintain\nthe moral order of society and ensure the ongoing function of its\nsystems. The third form of law according to Albo is natural law, or\nthe basic laws of morality that aim to prevent injustice and promote\nhonest behavior. Following is a short explanation of two main aspects\nof Albo\u2019s theory of law that the academic literature covers: the\nconcept of natural law, its origins, meaning and influence; and the\nmethod of verification of divine law.\n\nNatural law. Albo was one of the first Jewish\nphilosophers to specifically address the concept of natural law along\nwith his contemporary Zerahia Halevi Saladin. Apparently, this was due\nto the influence of the Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas, who\nclassified laws in his book Summa Theologica. Albo\u2019s\nview of natural law has attracted the attention of many scholars, in\ncomparison to other topics in his philosophy, but the popular view\namong these scholars is that Albo did not attach great importance to\nthis concept (Guttmann 1955, 176\u2013184; Lerner 1964; Novak 1983,\n319\u2013350; Melamed 1989; Ehrlich 2006; Ackerman 2013).\n\nVerification of divine law. One of the formative\nfactors in Albo\u2019s philosophy was the anti-Christian polemic. For this\nreason, one of the questions that engages him is the method of\ndistinguishing between the true divine law, meaning the Torah of Moses,\nand a false religion that also claims to be of divine origin, meaning\nChristianity. Albo proposes two criteria for distinguishing between the\ntwo. Firstly, the true divine law is the one whose beliefs do not\ncontradict any one of the necessary principles of divine law. Secondly,\nthe true divine law provides incontrovertible proof of the credibility\nof its messenger, who informs the world of the law\u2019s existence and\ndivine origin (treatise 1, chapter 18). An important study on this\nissue argued that the first point is problematic, because it assumes\nthat philosophy defines the basic beliefs of divine law and thus\ndetermines which law is truly divine. This is in opposition to the\nAverroistic approach, which disallows the use of philosophy for\nverifying religious matters. The solution for this problem lies in an\nalternate understanding of the role of philosophy in inter-religious\ndebate. Philosophy does not serve as an affirming mechanism to validate\ncertain beliefs, but only as a negating tool for identifying beliefs\nthat stand in direct conflict with the basic rules of logic. In other\nwords, Albo does not use philosophy to prove the validity of the\nbeliefs of Judaism, but rather to reject Christianity as a false\nreligion in light of its beliefs that stand in contradiction to\nphilosophy (Lasker 1980).\n",
