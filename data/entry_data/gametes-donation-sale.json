    "preamble": "\n\nThe donation and transfer of human gametes (eggs and sperm) for\nreproductive purposes raises many important and difficult questions.\nSome of these relate directly to policy and practice; others are more\nconceptual. Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within\nbioethics, having something in common both with other forms of\ndonation (blood and organs, for example) and with\nreproductive technologies not involving donation (ranging\nfrom IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo\nselection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features\nwith adoption and surrogacy, practices which also\n(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental\nduties and rights. (See the entries on\n cloning,\n eugenics,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n the donation of human organs, and\n parenthood and procreation.)\n\nConceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable \u2018lens\u2019\nthrough which to re-examine questions such as:\n\nWhat grounds parental rights and responsibilities?\nWhat rights and obligations do parents have regarding their\nchildren (actual or future) and to what extent can these be\ntransferred or delegated?\n\n\nIt also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:\n\nShould there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm\ndonor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the\nbasis for these?\nDo donor-conceived children have a right to know about their\norigins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?\nWhat \u2018matching\u2019 and selection decisions should the\nprospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about\ndonors should they be given?\nIs it acceptable to \u2018buy and sell\u2019 gametes? And is\nthat any different morally from arrangements in which women are\noffered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for\nsome of their eggs?\n\n\nSuch questions are the subject of this entry.\n\nBefore proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should\nbe noted.\n\nFirst, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes for\nreproductive purposes, as opposed to for research. The rationale\nfor this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical\nissues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social\nrelations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children\ncreated, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The\nmain exception to this is\n section 4 (Payment)\n where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been\nraised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis & McLeod\n2007).\n\nSecond, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete\ndonation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term\n\u2018gamete donation\u2019 to apply to those situations in which\n\u2013\n\nA (the donor) voluntarily provides B (the recipient\nor recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); and\nA expects that and/or intends that B will use those\ngametes to create C (a child or some children);\nand\nBoth A and B expect that and/or intend that A\nwill not become a social or legal parent of C.\n\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors\n\nThe rights and responsibilities that attach to parenthood are\ngenerally understood to be very weighty. Consequently, determining\nwhether or not gamete donors are parents is a question that has\nattracted much attention. But even if gamete donors are not parents in\nthe deeper ethical sense, they may still have considerable rights and\nobligations towards their biological offspring. While there is\nconsiderable overlap here with the parenthood literature (see the entry on\n parenthood and procreation)\n questions about parenthood in the context of gamete donation have\ngarnered much specific attention. In what follows we will examine\nthree distinctive questions that have emerged: (1) Are gamete donors\nparents? (2) Can parental responsibilities be transferred to others?\n(3) Do gamete providers acquire any non-parental obligations?\n1.1 Arguments in Favour of Gamete Donor Parenthood\n\nA common starting point for the claim that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is to highlight the strong intuitions we\nhave about parenthood in cases other than gamete donation. Normally we\nthink that those who wilfully engage in procreative acts acquire\nparental obligations if children are created as a result. This is true\neven when procreation is unintended, due to faulty contraception for\nexample. The strength of this intuition is used as motivation for\nadopting a causal view of parental obligations. On such views,\ncreating offspring in the right kind of way is sufficient for the\nacquisition of parental responsibilities. Those who think that gamete\ndonors have parental obligations proceed by arguing that the most\nplausible causal accounts of parenthood must include gamete donors\n(Nelson 1999; Fuscaldo 2006; Blustein 1997).\n\nFor instance, Nelson argues that our common-sense understanding of\nmoral responsibility is what best explains our intuitions about\nparenthood following unintentional procreation. On the common-sense\nview, individuals are morally responsible for the consequences of\ntheir free actions when (1) their actions are sufficient to bring\nabout those consequences, and (2) their actions are causally proximate\nto the consequence in question. Gamete donors satisfy these\nconditions. Nelson further argues that gamete donors\u2019 causal\ninvolvement in creating children does not significantly depart from\nthat of unintentional parents (at least not in morally relevant\nrespects) and therefore consistency demands that gamete donors be\nascribed parental responsibilities as well (Nelson 1999, 2014). \n\nAnother route is to argue that reproduction is a special kind of case,\nand that special rules apply when determining what moral\nresponsibilities arise for reproducers. Consider for example what\nDavid Benatar (1999) calls \u2018reproductive autonomy\u2019.\nBenatar argues that individuals\u2019 reproductive autonomy both\nentitles them to make reproductive decisions, and requires them to\ntake responsibility for the consequences of those decisions. He argues\nthat this is a special feature of our ability to reproduce that is not\nfully reducible to genetics or mere causality, and results in a\npresumptive duty to parent the children created from our gametes.\nThis, he argues, best explains why parental responsibilities arise in\naccidental pregnancy cases. Though in some circumstances the\npresumptive duty to parent one\u2019s genetic children may be\noverridden, this is not the case for most instances of gamete\nprovision (Benatar 1999). \n\nOne worry about Benatar\u2019s argument is that it relies heavily on\nstipulating that unique moral features attach to reproduction, and so\nrisks begging the question. Rivka Weinberg (2008) offers an argument\nfor a similar conclusion, but on more general grounds. Weinberg argues\nthat when individuals exercise control over materials that pose grave\nrisks to others (what she calls \u2018hazardous materials\u2019)\nthey are liable for the consequences that arise, regardless of the\nprecautions they take. For instance, the owner of a pet lion is liable\nfor damage done by the lion regardless of the precautions the owner\ntakes to keep the lion contained. Calling this the \u201cHazmat\nTheory\u201d, Weinberg argues that it applies to gametes because\ntheir use can have morally weighty consequences for third parties\n\u2013 namely the children that may result from the union of gametes.\nConsequently, Weinberg argues that gamete providers are obliged to\ncare for the children that result from the voluntary use of their\ngametes (Weinberg 2008). \n\nImportantly, none of the preceding arguments rely on genetic\nrelatedness as grounds for parenthood. It is not the genetic\nsimilarity between gamete donors and their biological offspring that\nis doing the work, but rather considerations about the kind of thing\ngametes are (things that can create people) and how gamete donors use\nthem.\n\nDavid Velleman (2005, 2008), however, does argue that being parented by\nclose genetic relations is of great importance to the wellbeing of\nchildren, and that for this reason we ought to be sceptical of the\nease with which society permits the separation of social parenthood\nfrom biological parenthood. \n1.2 Arguments Against Gamete Donor Parenthood\n\nThose who argue that gamete donation does not result in parental\nresponsibilities find fault with causal accounts of parenthood. One\nprominent move is the \u2018too many parents\u2019 objection. The\ncore of this objection is the claim that causal theorists have no\nprincipled way to distinguish members of the causal chain who acquire\nparental responsibilities from those who ought not be ascribed such\nresponsibilities. As a result, causal accounts ascribe parenthood to\ntoo many people. \n\nFor instance, Tim Bayne (2003) argues that both Benatar and Nelson are\ncommitted to including biological grandparents and great grandparents\netc. amongst those who acquire parental responsibilities for\ndonor-conceived children. Bayne thinks Benatar is committed to this\nconclusion because subsequent generations are the result of an\nindividuals\u2019 exercise of reproductive autonomy. He thinks that\nNelson is committed to this conclusion because biological grandparents\nand great grandparents are necessary causes of their donor-conceived\nchildren, and so satisfy Nelson\u2019s criteria for parenthood.\n\nIt is however unclear whether Bayne\u2019s criticism is apt.\nNelson\u2019s account does rely on causal proximity, but he\nexplicitly rejects the view that merely being a necessary part of a\ncausal chain that results in the creation of a child is sufficient for\nparenthood (Nelson 1991, 53). The actions of intervening agents\nplausibly restricts the scope of individuals who are causally\nproximate. \n\nAnd Benatar\u2019s view does not ascribe obligations for all the\ndownstream consequences of one\u2019s exercise of reproductive\nautonomy. Indeed, autonomous control over the use of particular\ngametes is an important feature of Benatar\u2019s account.\nGrandparents and great grandparents do not normally possess autonomous\ncontrol over the use of their offspring\u2019s gametes, and so would\nnot normally be parents on this view. \n\nJason Hanna (2019) advances a better version of the objection. Hanna\nargues that medical professionals do exercise control over gametes and\nare proximate causes of the children created through their use. After\nall, medical professionals often perform the critical steps necessary\nfor conception. Indeed, in many cases medical professionals are more\ncausally proximate and exercise more control over the creation of\nchildren than gamete donors. Consistency thus demands that at least\nsome of the medical professionals involved in gamete donation be\nascribed parenthood. According to Hanna, the most promising way for\ncausal theorists to escape this reductio is to accept that causal\nresponsibilities do not extend to cases in which: (a) one individual\nacts for the sake of another in an employee/employer type relationship\nand (b) that individual has reasonable assurances that the employer\nwill ensure that any obligations arising from their actions will be\nfulfilled. This move has intuitive appeal. We do not think that an\nemployee whose assigned task produces pollutants has a special\nresponsibility to clean up those pollutants if her employer fails to\ndo so as promised. Hanna notes that this limit on the scope of causal\nresponsibility insulates gamete donors from weighty obligations\nbecause gamete donors provide services for commissioning parents in\nsomething like an employee/employer relationship. \n\nElizabeth Brake advances another challenge to causal views of\nparenthood. Brake (2005, 2010) argues that we are mistaken to think\nthat being causally involved in creating offspring suffices for\nacquiring parental responsibilities. According to Brake, many of the\nsocial practices that causal theorists appeal to, like child\nmaintenance obligations in accidental pregnancy cases, are in fact\nmistaken. Brake argues that instead, we ought to be voluntarists about\nparenthood. This does mean that those who cause children to exist are\nfree from obligations altogether. Brake argues that we ought to\ndistinguish between what she calls \u2018procreative costs\u2019 and\nthe more demanding obligations of parenthood. While causal actors may\nbe responsible for procreative costs, they certainly do not have\nparental responsibilities. More will be said about Brake\u2019s\nprocreative costs in\n section 1.4\n\n1.3 The Transferability of Parental Responsibilities\n\nOne way we might sidestep concerns about the parental status of gamete\ndonors is to argue that parental responsibilities can be transferred\nto others. If such transfers are possible then presumably gamete\ndonors do so when they make their gametes available to others. That\nsuch transfers are at least sometimes possible is a view that is held\nby many (O\u2019Neill 1979; Bayne 2003; Fuscaldo 2006; Benatar\n1999). Those who defend the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities argue that parents often transfer some of their\nresponsibilities to others, such as school teachers, nannies, and\ndoctors. So long as gamete donors have reason to believe that those to\nwhom the responsibilities are transferred will do an adequate job,\nsuch transfers are unproblematic. On this view, we ought to treat\ngamete donation as a comprehensive transfer of responsibilities that\nis no different in kind from these other commonplace transfers of\nresponsibility. However, accepting the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities does not imply that current practice is morally\npermissible. We might think that many gamete donors fail to take the\nnecessary steps to ensure that their biological offspring will be\nadequately reared (Benatar 1999). \n\nThe transferability of parental responsibilities is however\ncontroversial. Many argue that the move from some transfers of\nresponsibility to the complete abdication of parental responsibility\nis too quick (Velleman 2008; Weinberg 2008; Nelson 1991; Brandt 2016).\nFor instance, Velleman (2008) argues that while adoption is acceptable\nwhen there is no other means to provide a child with an adequate life,\nthis should not be confused with the intentional creation of children\nwhose social link to their genetic parents will be severed. Because\nVelleman believes that preserving the social connection between\nchildren and genetic parents is important for the wellbeing of\nchildren, he argues that, unless there is pressing reason to do\notherwise, children ought to be parented by their genetic\nprogenitors.\n\nWeinberg (2008) argues that parental responsibilities cannot be\ntransferred in full because certain kinds of intimate responsibilities\ncan only be fulfilled by particular individuals: individuals in the\nright intimate relationship. For instance, parents cannot transfer the\nobligation to celebrate their children\u2019s achievements to others\nby having strangers attend their children\u2019s music recitals or\naward ceremonies. Weinberg thinks that gamete donors have a\nresponsibility to love their children and that the responsibility to\nlove a particular person is paradigmatic of the kind that cannot be\ntransferred. Consequently, at least some parental responsibilities are\nnot transferable.\n\nBrandt (2006) disputes the claim that partial transfers of parental\nresponsibilities are commonplace. When a responsibility is delegated\nbut not transferred, the individual delegating the responsibility must\nstill ensure that the responsibility is fulfilled. For instance,\nparents have a duty to ensure that their children are in fact\nreceiving proper education from their teachers, and must take\ncorrective measures if this is not the case. The duty to educate is\nthus delegated to teachers, but not transferred to them. In general, the\nexamples offered to show that partial transfers of parental\nresponsibility are commonplace tend to be in fact examples of\ndelegation. This undermines the claim that a complete transfer of\nparental responsibility is merely an extension of already accepted\npractices because it is delegation that is the norm, not transfer.\n\n1.4 Non-Parental Responsibilities\n\nEven if gamete donors are not parents, they may still have substantial\nobligations towards their offspring. Bayne (2003) argues that gamete\ndonors have the responsibility to prevent certain kinds of lives from\ncoming about. For instance, they may be obliged to refrain from\ncreating children with severe congenital diseases that would result in\na \u2018life not worth living\u2019. Many authors (Bayne 2003;\nArchard 2010; Porter 2014; Fuscaldo 2006; O\u2019Neill 1979, Brandt\n2016) also think that gamete donors must take steps to ensure that\ntheir offspring will be parented in at least a minimally acceptable\nmanner.\n\nWhile the preceding responsibilities concern pre-conditions for the\npermissible transfer of gametes, there might also be donor\nresponsibilities that extend into the lives of donor-conceived\noffspring. For instance, as noted above, Brake (2005, 2010) argues\nthat gamete donors might have an ongoing duty to ensure that their\nbiological offspring receive a minimum level of care (she calls these\n\u2018procreative costs\u2019), but that this should not be confused\nwith parental responsibilities, which are more intimate and more\nmorally weighty in nature. Likewise Brake, Porter (2012, 2014) and\nBrandt (2016, 2020) similarly argue that gamete donors must continue\nto take steps to ensure that their offspring have a decent life,\nthough they are not necessarily obligated to parent their offspring\nthemselves. \n\nThere are reasons to think that these responsibilities do not go far\nenough. For instance Prusak (2011) argues that the gap between\nBrake\u2019s \u2018procreative costs\u2019 and parental\nresponsibility is not as pronounced as it initially appears.\nConsequently, for all practical purposes gamete donors have\nresponsibilities edging on full blown parenthood. Conversely,\narguments originating in the abortion literature imply that gamete\ndonors need only ensure that their offspring have lives worth living.\nFor a discussion of these arguments and a response see Brandt (2020).\n\n\nAnother kind of non-parental obligation that gamete donors might have\nis to remain open to the possibility of forming relationships with\ntheir biological offspring, though this openness does not entail an\nobligation to in fact form such relationships (Little 1999; Kolodny\n2010). \n1.5 Offspring Limits\n\nIn addition to obligations that focus on the wellbeing of potential\noffspring and the competence of intending parents, another question is\nwhether there ought to be limits on the number of offspring that can\nbe created from a single gamete provider. This question is most\nsignificant in sperm provision because of the relative ease of\ncreating large numbers of children from the gametes provided by a\nsingle individual. Three major justifications have been offered for\noffspring limits: the risk of accidental consanguineous relationships,\nthe likelihood of convoluted social relationships with kin, and\ngeneral social discomfort with large offspring numbers (Wright 2016).\nWhile the last might not be a plausible justification on its own, it\nis worth mentioning because in practice such concerns have had an\ninfluential role on imposed offspring limits (Deech 1998; Warnock\nReport 1984).\n\nLimiting offspring numbers in order to reduce the likelihood of\naccidental consanguineous relationships between offspring of the same\ndonor was initially proposed by individuals concerned about possible\nrisks of congenital disease (Curie-Cohen 1980). Recent work has\nattempted to quantify these risks (De Boer et al. 1995; Wang et al.\n2007). While the increased risk of congenital disease resulting from\nunintentional consanguinity is dependent on the size of the population\nserved by a sperm bank, the risk is lower than might be initially\nthought. For instance, Dutch models suggest that an offspring limit of\nup to 25 would not result in any significant increased risk, given\ntheir particular demographic makeup (De Boer et al. 1995). However,\nthere is also the risk of psychological harm for individuals that\ndiscover they have unwittingly entered into a consanguineous\nrelationship, given the associated social taboos (Wright 2016).\nFurthermore, there may be legal complications if an accidental\nconsanguineous marriage is discovered after the fact (Cahn 2009a). One\nway to mitigate these risks without imposing offspring limits would be\nto increase openness in gamete provision, including actively informing\nindividuals about the identity of their genetic siblings. However,\neven in the absence of such measures there is little agreement about\nhow the risks associated with consanguinity should be translated into\noffspring limits, especially given the broad reproductive freedom\nindividuals are generally afforded (Wright 2016; HFEA 2011).\n\nThe main worry in relation to social relationships with kin is that\ninitiating and maintaining relationships with progenitors and/or\ngenetic siblings is made much more challenging if there are large\nnumbers to accommodate. The extent to which this justifies offspring\nlimits will depend on the importance placed on such relationships and,\nas noted previously, there is much disagreement about this.\nFurthermore, some empirical research into kin relationships following\ngamete provision has found that having large numbers of genetic\nsiblings is not necessarily an impediment to the formation of\nmeaningful relationships (Freeman, Jadva, & Slutsky 2016).\n2. Donor Anonymity\n\nThere is general agreement that it is permissible for donor-conceived\nindividuals to have information about and contact with their genetic\nprogenitors. However, gamete donation arrangements in which there is\nan expectation that donors remain anonymous are more contentious. \n\nAdvocates of children\u2019s rights to access identifying information\nabout their donors generally appeal to harms that might arise in the\nabsence of such information, and/or a purported fundamental right to\ninformation about one\u2019s genetic origins (Ravitsky 2010, 2012;\nVelleman 2005, 2008; McGee, Brakeman, and Gurmankin 2001; Blyth and\nFarrand 2004). Possible harms considered include psychological\ndistress, damaged familial relationships, reduced self-knowledge, and\nincomplete or incorrect medical records. Those who favour permitting\nanonymous donation argue that it is a mistake to place a great deal of\nimportance on genetic origins, and question both the severity of the\nharms caused by anonymous donation and whether the existence of such\nharms constitutes a decisive argument against donor-anonymity\n(Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014; Haslanger 2009).\n\nThe philosophical debate takes place within a background of changing\nlegal norms governing donor anonymity (Clark 2011; Frith 2001;\nBernstein 2010). While maintaining donor anonymity was once common\npractice (and is mandatory in certain jurisdictions, such as France)\nthere has been a strong trend towards enshrining in law\ndonor-conceived children\u2019s rights to access identifying\ninformation about their donor, at least once they reach the age of\nmajority (Clark 2011; Frith 2001; Bernstein 2010; Brunet and Kunstmann\n2013). \n2.1 Psychological Distress and Self-Knowledge\n\nOne reason for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is the distress\nthat advocates of disclosure claim many donor-conceived children\nsuffer as a consequence of the absence of identifying information\nabout their biological progenitors. This distress is sometimes\nreferred to as \u2018genealogical bewilderment\u2019, a term\noriginally coined in reference to the distress experienced by\nadoptees, and its symptoms are said to include difficulty developing a\npersonal identity that feels genuine, anguish about not knowing the\nidentity of one\u2019s genetic relations, and an obsession with\ntrying to find out information about one\u2019s genetic relations\n(Sants 1964; Cahn 2009b). Advocates of the right to know point to both\nscientific studies and general social observations, such as the rise\nof services to help donor-conceived individuals find their biological\nrelations, as evidence of the severity of this harm (McWhinnie 2001;\nFrith 2001; Ravitsky 2010).\n\nA related argument is that donor-conceived individuals are denied an\nimportant good if they are not given access to detailed information\nabout their biological relations. More than simply satisfying\ncuriosity, some argue that knowledge about one\u2019s biological\nrelations (especially through contact) is important for self-knowledge\n(Velleman 2005, 2008). On this view, while a name and biographical\ndetails may not replace being reared by biological relations, they do\nat least provide donor-conceived individuals with some\ninformation, and make contact later in life possible.\n\nHowever, both these arguments have been challenged on empirical and\nphilosophical grounds. While some studies do indeed show that a subset\nof donor-conceived individuals suffer psychological distress from not\nknowing the identity of their progenitors, others show that such\ndistress is not common, and is not particularly severe when it does\narise (Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014; Haslanger 2009). Studies also show\nthat early disclosure helps children incorporate the fact that they\nwere donor-conceived into their identity and sense of self, thus\nhelping donor-conceived children avoid some of psychological harms\nassociated with genealogical bewilderment (Golombok et. al. 2002).\nAdvocates of the permissibility of donor anonymity thus argue that\nthere is no clear evidence that donor anonymity is likely to result in\nsevere harm to offspring. If anything, the evidence suggests that we\nshould have a policy of early disclosure.\n\nFurthermore, some argue that any psychological harm that does arise is\nlikely socially constructed. As evidence, they point to studies\nshowing that individuals who are unaware that they were\ndonor-conceived do no worse than their peers when it comes to\npsychological wellbeing (Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014; Haslanger 2009).\nConsequently, they argue that any psychological harms experienced by\ndonor-conceived individuals arise in virtue of the social importance\nplaced on biological ties rather than any \u2018necessary\u2019\ndeficit arising from being reared by individuals who are not genetic\nrelations. Similar arguments have also been raised in response to\nVelleman\u2019s views regarding the value of contact with genetic\nrelations for self-knowledge (Haslanger 2009). \n\nIf the psychological harms arising from donor-anonymity are socially\nconstructed, then prohibiting anonymous gamete donation may exacerbate\nthe harms suffered by donor-conceived children. This is because such a\nprohibition could further reify the importance of biological ties\n(sometimes referred to as \u2018biologism\u2019), which is what\ngives rise to the harm in the first place (Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014;\nLeighton 2014; Haslanger 2009). By signalling the importance of\nbiological ties, prohibiting donor anonymity might further stigmatize\nthose raised by non-biological parents.\n\nHowever, that a harm is socially constructed does not make it any less\nreal, or less in need of redress. This results in a difficult bind for\nthose who agree that the harms are socially constructed. They are left\nhaving to balance the interests of donor-conceived offspring with the\nbroader social goal of eliminating unjust socially constructed harms.\nThe best way to go about doing so is unclear (Haslanger 2009).\n2.2 Medical Records\n\nAnother reason offered for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is\nthat it prevents donor-conceived individuals from making health\ndecisions informed by family medical history. If individuals are not\ninformed about being donor-conceived, they risk making medical\ndecisions on the incorrect assumption that their social family\u2019s\nmedical background reflects their own. And even if such individuals\nare informed that they are donor-conceived, they still suffer from an\nabsence of medical information that is generally available to others\n(Ravitsky 2012). While it is true that medical information could be\nprovided at the time of donation in a manner that preserves the\nanonymity of the donor, some argue that, as our understanding of\ncongenital disease changes, new information is likely to become\nrelevant (Leighton 2014; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\nAdditionally, certain relevant medical conditions might only become\napparent long after the donation. While a system could be put in place\nfor donors to update their medical information, some argue that such a\nsystem would likely be too cumbersome for donor-conceived individuals\nto receive the medical information they need in a timely fashion\n(McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\n\nHowever, those who defend the permissibility of donor anonymity argue\nthat the value of medical history is overstated, and will become less\nimportant as we move towards personalized medicine (Melo-Mart\u00edn\n2014). In fact, in a report recommending against permitting\ndonor anonymity, the UK\u2019s Nuffield Council on Bioethics stated\nthat medical interests alone were not sufficient grounds for\nprohibiting donor anonymity (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2013).\n2.3 Family Cohesion\n\nAnother argument against donor anonymity is that secrecy about origins\nhas the potential to damage the relationships between donor-conceived\nchildren and their social parents, especially in cases where the\nsocial parent(s) know the identity of the gamete donor(s) Some argue\nthat the strain of having to \u2018keep the secret\u2019 is a cause\nof stress for social parents, and that this stress has a negative\nimpact on familial wellbeing (Landau 1998). A potentially more\nsignificant source of family tension is accidental disclosure,\nespecially when donor-conceived children are older. In this latter\ncase, several harms might arise, and may be greatly exacerbated if\nchildren were not aware that they were donor-conceived. Children might\ndevelop feelings of distrust towards their social parents, and may\nhave difficulty incorporating facts about their genetic history into\ntheir personal identity (Turner & Coyle 2000).\n\nWhile harms caused by both secrecy and accidental disclosure can be\nmitigated to some extent without making identifiable information\navailable, by simply disclosing to children at a young age that they\nare donor-conceived for example, some argue that more openness is\nbetter for familial unity, and that providing children with an\nopportunity to find out the identity of their donors (even if that is\ndelayed until they are older) is usually best (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2009).\n\nThose who favour permitting anonymous gamete donation argue that, at\nbest, the evidence suggests a slight improvement in familial wellbeing\nwhen information about a donor is provided along with disclosure about\nthe method of their conception. Families in which children do not have\naccess to identifying information about their donors still report good\nhome-life and have positive relationships with their parents\n(Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014). Thus, while non-disclosure might not be\noptimal, it is probably not so harmful that it falls outside of the\ndomain of parental discretion. Furthermore, if the harms are socially\nconstructed, as some have argued is the case in genealogical\nbewilderment, then we may have additional reasons for concluding that\nthe harms to family cohesion do not justify prohibiting anonymous\ndonation, since doing so would only further contribute to biologism\n(Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014).\n2.4 Fundamental Rights\n\nThe arguments against donor anonymity considered thus far focus on\nharms that might arise as a result of the practice. Another kind of\nargument is that individuals have a fundamental right to knowledge\nabout their origins. In the legal literature, some have argued that\nthe UN\u2019s Declaration on The Rights of The Child and the European\nConvention on Human Rights establishes individuals\u2019 rights to\ninformation about the circumstances of their conception, including\ninformation about their progenitors (Blyth & Farrand 2004). Apart\nfrom appeals to such declarations of rights, some attempts have been\nmade to motivate recognition of a fundamental right to know via appeal\nto other fundamental goods.\n\nOne strategy is to tie the right to know to the right to an identity.\nHere the argument is that individuals require genuine facts about\ntheir biological history in order to develop a proper personal\nidentity (Ravitsky 2010). However, one response is that while\nchildren have a right to an identity, they do not have a right to a\nparticular kind of identity, such as one based primarily on\nhistorical biological ties (Allen 1996). Another route is to argue\nthat children have a right to be respected, and that hiding facts\nabout their origins is a form of deception that we ought not permit\n(Freeman 1996). However, deception about origins is only a severe form\nof disrespect if we think that biological ties are important in the\nfirst place, and thus this argument risks begging the question.\n2.5 Policy Argument from Analogy to Adoption\n\nOffspring\u2019s ability to access adoption records have oscillated\nquite substantially over the past century and a half, even within the\nsame jurisdiction (Samuels 2000). More recently, regulatory structures\nhave shifted in favour of providing adoptees with a legal right to\naccess identifying information about their progenitors (Besson 2007,\nHildebrand 1999). In such jurisdictions, some have argued that,\nbecause gamete donation is sufficiently similar to adoption,\nregulatory consistency demands that anonymous gamete donation be\nprohibited as well (Pratten v. British Columbia (Attorney\nGeneral) 2012 BCCA 480; Chisholm 2012; Cahn 2009c \u2013 see\nOther Internet Resources). While this parity argument only goes so far\nin the absence of philosophical justification for prohibiting\nanonymous adoption (mere consistency could conversely be achieved by\npermitting anonymous adoption) it does give pause to examine the\nrelevant similarities between the two practices.\n\nThe core of the parity argument is that in both adoption and gamete\ndonation, children are reared by individuals other than their genetic\nprogenitors. If we think that access to information about genetic\nprogenitors is important enough to be elevated to the status of a\nright in adoption, then we ought to extend the same right to\ndonor-conceived individuals as well.\n\nIn response, Leighton has argues that there are important disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation such that there may be no\ninconsistency in prohibiting anonymity in one case but not the other\n(Leighton 2014). For instance, adoptees are generally relinquished by\ntheir initial parent(s), and are often not raised by either of their\ngenetic parents. In the case of gamete donation there is no similar\nrelinquishing of parenthood, and often one of the genetic parents is\nalso a social parent. These differences may very well result in\ndivergences in the experiences of adoptees and donor-conceived\nindividuals. For instance, adoptees might feel abandoned by their\ninitial parents, and be curious about why they were relinquished,\nsomething that is unlikely to be the case in gamete donation.\nFurthermore, Leighton argues that since adoption has a history of\nstigmatization in the West while gamete donation has no such history,\nthere is good reason to think that the psychological impact of\nanonymous adoption on adoptees will be different from the\npsychological impact of anonymous gamete donation on donor-conceived\nindividuals (Leighton 2014).\n\nWhile simply demonstrating that there are relevant disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation does not show that anonymity is\npermissible in the latter case but not the former, it does show that\nit is not outright inconsistent to have different policies governing\nanonymity for each.\n3. Donor Matching and Selection\n\nRecipients of donated gametes often wish to have some say in what\ntheir donor is \u2018like\u2019. The characteristics made available\nto inform donor selection decisions differ greatly dependent on both\nthe countries and clinics in which such choices are made. However,\nsuch information tends to include medical, morphological, and\nbiographical information similar to that found on dating websites,\nsuch as hair colour, eye colour, ethnicity, educational attainment,\njob type, hobbies, and religion.\n\nFew commentators suggest that recipient-parents should be barred\ncompletely from accessing information about prospective donors, but\nneither is it generally assumed that they should be afforded\nunfettered liberty to choose their donors\u2019 characteristics.\nThus, the debate in this area tends to focus on where the line between\nmorally acceptable and unacceptable selection practices lies.\n3.1 Motivations Underlying Donor Selection\n\nThree main categories of motivation underlie donor selection\ndecisions.\n\nThe first is selection against donors posing a threat to the physical\nwellbeing of pregnant women. This form of selection is ubiquitous such\nthat the barring of donors with sexually transmissible diseases such\nas HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis is mandated by national and\ninternational guidelines on gamete donation (see, for example HFE Act\n2008: s. T52 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources). This motivation\nfor selection is widely seen as morally unproblematic and will, for\nthis reason, be largely ignored here.\n\nThe second and third categories of motivation, termed here, selection\nfor \u2018matching\u2019 and selection for \u2018design\u2019 are,\nunlike the first, based on parental and/or societal preferences or\nvalues. In practice, most donor selection decisions will fall into\nboth categories, but a theoretical distinction is nonetheless made\nbetween the two in the philosophical literature.\n\nSelection for \u2018matching\u2019 is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child who bears a similarity to the recipient parents.\nThus, gamete donors are selected (or deselected) by reference to the\nextent to which their physical (and sometimes social and\npsychological) characteristics match those of recipient parents\n(Quiroga, 2017). As Braverman and Frith (2014) note, the aim of this\npractice is often:\n\n\nto enable secrecy and concealment of gamete donation. This practice\nincorporates a popular knowledge of genetics and enables the child to\n\u2018pass\u2019 as a naturally conceived child. This is an attempt\nto avoid overt \u2018difference\u2019 between child and couple and\nwhen a good match is achieved the donor disappears from view.\n(Braverman & Frith 2014: 135)\n\n\nThere may however, be aims other than secrecy and concealment. These\nmay have their basis in concerns regarding compatibility (wanting our\nchildren to be \u2018like us\u2019 and to \u2018fit in\u2019)\n(Ruddick 2000; Wong 2017), premised on physical or psychological\ndesire (we often choose our reproductive partners because they possess\ncharacteristics that please us), or even with the aim of avoiding\noffence \u2013 a member of a couple may be offended if his/her partner\nprefers a donor with characteristics markedly different from his/her\nown (Pennings 2000). Importantly, matching motivations are\ndistinguished from other motivations for selection as they are limited\nonly to desires to select for donors with characteristics possessed by\none/both intended social parents and should be based only in a desire\nto attain resemblance between parent and child.\n\nSelection motivated by design, however, is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child with characteristics which may or may not be\npossessed by the recipient parents but which are, nonetheless, deemed\nby them (and/or society) to be desirable (and often advantageous).\nSuch selection may thus be performed with several aims in mind. These\ninclude but are not limited to desires to increase the life prospects\nof one\u2019s children by preventing the birth of children with\ndisadvantageous or without advantageous characteristics, to satisfy\npreferences for a particular \u2018kind of child\u2019, or with the\neugenic aim of improving the gene pool through the selection of donors\ndeemed to possess \u2018superior\u2019 heritable traits.\n\nOf these two categories, a desire for matching is generally\nthought to be less morally problematic than a desire for\ndesign, since desires for familial resemblance, secrecy\n(within limits), and to avoid offence are often considered relatively\nbenign. This is not, however, to say that no critical work has been\ndone on this topic as shall be seen in\n subsection 3.3\n which looks to the question of whether race-based matching and\nselection practices are morally permissible.\n\nDesign-based motivations for selection, however, have been the subject\nof a great deal more debate. This discussion largely mirrors (or is\nsubsumed by) many of the discussions had regarding the ethics of\nselective reproductive technologies, such as pre-implantation and\npre-natal genetic diagnosis, and such topics as sex selection and\nhuman enhancement (see the entries on\n pregnancy, birth & medicine,\n and\n eugenics).\n For, although in the context of gamete donor selection there are no\nembryos or fetuses involved, nor genetic manipulation performed, there\nhas been much focus on questions of:\n\nWhether it might be obligatory for recipient parents and/or\nclinics to select against \u2018disadvantageous\u2019 genetic\ncharacteristics in their future offspring via donor selection.\nWhether selection for/against certain characteristics may be\nimpermissible on grounds that it explicitly or implicitly expresses\nmisinformed or \u2018ugly\u2019 and discriminatory attitudes towards\nexisting persons with \u2018deselected\u2019 characteristics.\nWhether the desire to influence children\u2019s genetic\nconstitutions through gamete donor selection represents troubling\nparental attitudes which may be contrary to common conceptions of the\ngood parent and parental virtues such as \u2018unconditional\nlove\u2019 and \u2018openness to the unbidden\u2019\n\n\nWith this in mind, throughout the following subsections such debates\nwill be explored in turn.\n3.2 Selection against Disability and Disadvantage\n\nThe desire to have a child free from disability and disease is often\nconsidered the least contentious ground for gamete donor selection.\nParents and prospective parents, after-all, tend to want the best for\ntheir children and diseases and disabilities can make the attainment\nof a \u2018good life\u2019 harder. Given this, and the fact\nthat donor selection, unlike other forms of selective reproduction,\nraises few thorny questions regarding women\u2019s rights over their\nown bodies and the moral permissibility of abortion or the destruction\nof embryos, the dominant position among philosophers regarding gamete\nselection for the purpose of disability avoidance is one of\npermissiveness (see for example: Robertson 1994; Glover et al.\n1989; Glover 2006; Strong 1997; Bennett 2001; Wilkinson 2010).\nRobertson (1994) sums up this view well when he states:\n\n\nThe desire not to have a child with serious defects is not itself\nimmoral, and actions to avoid such a reproductive outcome should be\nrespected as an important aspect of procreative liberty. The question\nthen is what means to achieve that goal are acceptable \u2026\nPreconception selection by voluntary selection of mates or gametes\nraises the fewest problems \u2026 Concern with the genetic fitness of\na mate may not be romantic but it is rational if one is concerned\nabout the health of spouse and offspring. Mate selection should thus\nbe left to the individual. Similarly, the selection of a gamete donor\nshould be left to the couple that needs this service. (Roberson 1994:\n154)\n\n\nSome go further, arguing that donor selection for the purpose of\ndisability-avoidance is not merely permissible but, in certain\ncircumstances, obligatory (see, for example: Savulescu 2001; Savulescu\n& Kahane 2009; Harris 1985, 2002; Buchanan et al 2000; Glover\n1989; Glover 2006). Discussions regarding this matter have tended to\nfocus less on gamete donor selection and more on the selection of\nembryos and fetuses through pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic\ndiagnosis. However, as Holm and Bennett (2014) and Williams (2017)\nnote, arguments suggesting a moral obligation to select against\ndisability in these contexts apply to gamete donor selection too.\n\nIndeed, that this is the case can be seen clearly in the negative\nmedia reaction and public outrage directed towards a deaf couple who,\nafter deliberately conceiving a deaf child in the early 2000s via the\nuse of a 5th generation deaf sperm donor, were vilified by\nthe tabloid media and condemned by the US National Association of the\nDeaf. (For interesting and insightful commentaries on this case see\nSavulescu 2002; Spriggs 2002; Fahmy 2011.) It can also be seen in the\nfact that many countries require that clinics screen out\npotential donors for heritable diseases prior to their inclusion on\nthe donor register. A notable example of this is the UK\u2019s Human\nFertilisation and Embryology Act which, since 2008, has included a\nclause prohibiting the selection of gamete donors and embryos\n\n\nthat are known to have a gene, chromosome, or mitochondrion\nabnormality involving a significant risk that a person with the\nabnormality will have or develop: (a) a serious physical or mental\ndisability, (b) a serious illness, or (c) another serious medical\ncondition. (HFE Act 2008, s. 14(4)(9) \u2013 see Other Internet\nResources)\n\n\nYet on what grounds might such an obligation be based? Some suggest\nthat a moral basis for such an obligation may be found by focusing\non the interests of and/or the rights of the children that will result\nfrom our procreative decisions (see Davis 2001 for a\nrights-focused approach). Arguments falling into this category thus\nfocus on person-affecting reasons, picking out the harms or limits to\nopportunity associated with certain disabilities as providing good\nreason to select against donors with traits liable to result in such\nharms and limits to opportunity. Such an approach is intuitive.\nHowever, given the conclusions of the Non-Identity Problem (see the entry\non\n the non-identity problem),\n many question the logic of appeals to the interests of the child\ncreated in all but cases of the most severe disabilities. For, as it\nis generally held that a life with a disease or disability is better\nthan no life at all, and selection decisions alter who it is that\ncomes to exist rather than the prospects of determinate future\npersons, a focus on the interests of future children cannot ground\nsuch an obligation (Bennett 2009; Parfit 1984; Parker 2007; Robertson\n1994).\n\nOthers suggest that although the objects of our procreative efforts\nmay not be harmed by being born with a disability, prospective parents\nmay nevertheless have good moral reason to select against disability\nin their offspring on the basis of other considerations. These include\nappeals to the interests of others whose interests may be affected by\nour reproductive decisions such as existing children and other\ndependents (Roberts 2009) and taxpayers in countries with socialized\nmedical and welfare systems (Heyd 1995; Fahmy 2011; Rakowski 2002;\nWilliams 2017); appeals to the claim that to fail to take reasonable\nsteps to prevent disability in one\u2019s future children is contrary\nto common conceptions of the good parent (Steinbock & McClamrock\n1994); and to the suggestion that that those who fail to avoid\ndisability in their offspring act wrongly as they deliberately or\nnegligently choose to create a state of affairs that is strictly worse\n(in terms of some particular value such as happiness/preference\nsatisfaction) than the state of affairs that could have been created\nhad they chosen differently (Harris 1985; Parfit 1984; Glover 1989;\nGlover 2006). (See the entry on\n eugenics\n for a more detailed treatment and criticisms of different arguments\nin support of an obligation to select against disability.)\n\nSuch arguments have, however, been criticized on a number of grounds.\nSome suggest that parental obligations to their offspring cannot be so\nstrong as to ground an obligation to select against disability\n(Williams 2017); others claim that \u201ccomplex concepts such as the good\nlife, the best life, and human flourishing, are not reducible to\nsimple elements or constituent parts which might be identified by the\ntesting of embryos [and selection of sperm donors]\u201d (Parker 2007:\n281); and others still question the link between disability and low\nlevels of welfare (Barker & Wilson, 2019) and/or claim that\nappealing to impersonal harms devalues those with disabilities by\nsuggesting that their lives are worth less than those without\ndisabilities (Asch 2003; Bennett 2009). Yet, while many authors\nsuggest that there cannot be an obligation to select against\ndisability, it is often held that prospective parents should still be\nat liberty to select against disability in their offspring on the\nbasis of personal preferences.\n\nAmong a number of authors associated with the disability rights\nmovement however, a different claim is made. For, such authors suggest\nthat not only can there be no moral obligation to select against\ndisability, parental preferences to screen out disabled donors are\nmorally problematic for two reasons. The first regards the messages\nthat such preferences send about and towards persons living with\ndisabilities, ones which may be seen as discriminatory and offensive:\n\u201cexpress[ing] a hurtful attitude about and a hurtful message to\npeople who live with [disabilities]\u201d (Parens & Asch 1999:\nS2). The second is that the desire to select against disabling genetic\ntraits is based on misinformation regarding both the severity and true\nnature of disability. In terms of severity, for example, it has been\nwidely reported that persons with disabilities tend to report good\nquality of life despite the fact that most (non-disabled) observers\nsuggest the opposite (for work on the disability paradox see Albrecht\n& Devlieger 1999). Regarding the true nature of disability, it is\nclaimed that contrary to the views of many, who hold that disability\nis inherently disadvantageous, many (and, for those who take an\nextreme approach, all) of the harms associated with disability are\nsocially constructed. That is, they are often not the result of\nfailures in functioning but society\u2019s failing to account for\neveryone when designing physical, economic, and social institutions\n(Glackin 2010). Thus, it is suggested that as disability is often not\na feature intrinsic to those who suffer it, to attempt to prevent\ndisability by preventing the existence of persons with disabilities is\nvery much akin to attempts to prevent sexism or racism by preventing\nthe births of black people and women: an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem (Asch 2003).\n\nTaken to extremes, however, social constructivism is often viewed as\nirredeemably flawed by the academic community and a great number of\nable bodied and disabled persons alike. Robert Kitcher expresses this\nwell when he notes that if we take a wholly social constructivist\nview\n\n\nattempts to decrease the incidence of Tay-Sachs will be no different\nfrom Northern Indian sex selection or from anticipated future efforts\nto cure lesbians. (Kitcher 1996: 215)\n\n\n(See the entries on\n parenthood and procreation\n &\n eugenics\n for more in depth discussion of the suggestion that there may be a\nmoral obligation to select against disability in our offspring and the\nentry\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for more information on models of disability.)\n3.3 Characteristics Related to \u2018Race\u2019\n\nQuestions and concerns have also been raised regarding the\nappropriateness of selection on the basis of characteristics related\nto \u2018race\u2019, such as skin, eye, and hair colour. Had gamete\ndonor selection been well known in the 1980s when discussion raged\nconcerning whether trans-racial adoption practices constituted a step\nin the right direction towards the social ideal of colour-blindness, a\nform of racial and cultural genocide, or something in between the two,\none might have expected to see similar discussions regarding donor\nselection. This, however, has not been the case and instead, the\nphilosophical literature on race-based selection has tended to focus\non the question of whether selection of race-based characteristics is\nappropriate at all.\n\nFor the most part, this focus is due to contemporary debates regarding\nthe question of whether the concept of race is philosophically and\nscientifically defensible. Thus, work suggesting the removal of racial\nidentifiers on donor catalogues seems to owe a great deal to authors\nsuch as K. Anthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) who\nboth deny that race is a coherent concept and recommend discarding it\nentirely (see the entry on\n race).\n\nFogg-Davis (2001), for example, suggests that both the practice of\nreproducing race through assisted reproduction and selecting donors on\nthe basis of different race-linked characteristics are problematic as\nthey raise two major linked ethical issues:\n\n\none is the harm that racial stereotyping causes to individuals, and\nthe second is the public awareness that racial stereotyping is an\naccepted feature of this largely unregulated market.\n\n\nShe suggests that those who use racial classification to inform donor\nselection decisions are communicating that\n\n\nrace is heritable and relevant to their vision of family\nstructure \u2026 that a person\u2019s gametes are transmitters of\nracial meaning that can and should be selectively transmitted to their\nchild through the use of reproductive technologies. (Fogg-Davis 2001:\n18)\n\n\nHarris (1998) too questions the legitimacy of the desire to match\ndonors to recipient parents on the basis of race-linked\ncharacteristics such as skin tone, and hair and eye colour. He\nnotes:\n\n\nWhy do so many people firmly believe that children should be like\ntheir parents, particularly in terms of their general colour and\nracial characteristics? It is difficult not to view this desire, and\nattempts to implement it, as a form of \u2018ethnic cleansing.\u2019\nIt smacks very much of the pressure that so many societies and\ncultures have put upon their members not to \u2018marry out\u2019 or\nto put it more bluntly, not to mate with somebody of another tribe or\nrace. (Harris 1998: 21)\n\n\nOthers suggest, however, that there is \u201cno evidence to suggest that\nracial prejudice accounts for why sperm banks sort sperm donors\naccording to race or why many prospective parents hope for a child of\na particular race.\u201d (Fox 2009: 1860) Such authors hold instead that\nracial preferences in gamete donation are more likely to stem from a\ndesire to replicate the family structure of the biological family, to\navoid deficient access to racial culture and consciousness (Maung\n2019:114), to increase their children\u2019s prospects in unjust\nsocial contexts (Savulescu & Kahane 2009), or premised on a desire\n\u201cto make the donor invisible and to conform the new-founded\nfamily to the ideal of the natural family\u201d (Pennings 2000: 508).\nAs Wong (2017) notes: \u201crecipient parents who choose not to prioritise\nmatching \u2026 may embark on a project of queering heteronormative family\nstructures and place great trust in both their own children and\nchanging social attitudes to reduce stigma and generate acceptance for\nnon-traditional families.\u201d (Wong 2017:77).\n\nGiven such considerations, it has been argued that although race-based\nselection should not be condemned in all cases it is important to\n\u201csoften the prominence of race in donor selection by taking\nmeasures to frustrate wholesale filtering of sperm donors on the basis\nof race\u201d (Fox 2009: 1893). Others still note that those who\ndesire to select for race-linked characteristics for these \u2018less\nobjectionable\u2019 reasons must still consider the wider\nconsequences of doing so. Maung (2019), for example, suggests that\nwhile a desire to respect the rights of marginalised communities to\nmaintain their ethnic identities, and to ensure that donor conceived\nchildren from historically subjugated ethnic groups develop a positive\nethnic identity, and reap the benefits of belonging to a community\nwith a rich shared history, such concerns should be \u201ccounterbalanced\nby the concern about capitulating to the racialist assumptions that\nenabled that subjugation in the first place\u201d (Maung 2019:115).\nBerkowitz & Snyder (1998), Agar (2004) and Marway (2018) make\nsimilar points when considering the question of race-based selection\nof offspring. They suggest that while the aim of increasing the life\nprospects of one\u2019s children in racist and homophobic societies\nby selecting for heterosexual and light skinned offspring is not\nobjectionable, such practices should not be permitted. For, not only\nwould such selection collude with prejudice, constituting an\ninappropriate response to a social problem, but it would likely also\nundermine attempts to change racist and homophobic social attitudes\nand practices.\n3.4 Parental Virtues, Expectations, and Openness to the Unbidden\n\nGamete donor selection may also be motivated by a desire to parent a\n\u2018particular kind of child\u2019 such as where a music lover\nseeks out a concert pianist in order to increase the likelihood that\nthe future child will possess such talents, or where a couple seek out\ngamete donors with genius level IQ in order to increase the likelihood\nof rearing an academically gifted child (as with the couples who\npurchased sperm in the 1990s from the \u2018repository of germinal\nchoice\u2019) (Plotz 2006) .\n\nSuch cases raise a different kind of concern about whether selection,\nwhen performed in order to satisfy these kinds of preferences,\nencourages and facilitates the development of ethically troubling\nattitudes on the part of prospective parents.\n\nThis concern has been expressed in various different ways. Some, for\nexample, suggest that selection motivated by such desires is\nincompatible with parental virtues such as \u2018acceptingness\u2019\n(McDougall 2007), \u2018openness to the unbidden\u2019 (Sandel\n2007), and \u2018unconditional love\u2019 (Herrisone-Kelly 2007).\nThose who take this view hold onto the traditional notion of the child\nas a gift and correspondingly suggest that parents ought to care, not\nabout the traits that their children possess, but about developing a\nloving relationship with and raising whatever child they receive.\nOthers take a more Kantian line, suggesting that such parents\nare wrongfully instrumentalising their children: treating them as a\nmeans of fulfilling parental hopes and dreams rather than as entities\nwho, once born, exist for their own sake (Davis 1997).\n\nYet the suggestion that a selective mentality is incompatible with\nimportant parental virtues or problematically instrumentalises\none\u2019s future children has been the subject of some debate.\nAuthors such as Ruddick (2000) and Green (2008), challenge the\n\u2018maternalist assumption\u2019 that parents\n\n\nwho want a child should accept and welcome any child they happen to\nreceive, prepared to appreciate the child\u2019s developing\nindividuality, however different from their own. (Ruddick 2000:\n102)\n\n\nThey hold instead that other conceptions of parenthood can, provided\nthey are not taken to extremes, be perfectly adaptive, and crucially,\ndo not require parents to refrain from all attempts to shape the\ncharacteristics of their prospective children. They suggest that\nparents should rightly be viewed as both guardians of the\nchildren\u2019s future interests, and \u2018gardeners\u2019 who may\nshape and raise children in line with their own preferences and\npriorities.\n\nOthers question whether the virtues of the prospective parent are the\nsame as those of an existing parent. For, although some hold that a\ndesire to have a hand in the characteristics of one\u2019s future\nchildren is part of a broader desire to parent and thus requires\n\u201ccommitting oneself to acting and evaluating one\u2019s actions\nand decisions in light of the project of parenthood\u201d (Vehmas\n2001: 439), others argue that a desire to select is not incompatible\nwith such a commitment. Kamm argues, for example, that a distinction\ncan be made between \u2018caring to have\u2019 a particular child\nand \u2018caring about\u2019 one\u2019s future children once born\nand suggests that there is little reason to assume that the desire to\nseek out certain attributes in one\u2019s children is incompatible\nwith parental virtues or common conceptions of the good parent. She\nnotes\n\n\none can know that one will care about someone just as much whether or\nnot she has certain traits and yet care to have someone that has,\nrather than lacks such traits. (Kamm 2009: 113)\n\n\nThis is echoed by Wilkinson who, discussing a hypothetical example of\ntwo prospective parents who seek to ensure the birth of a blue eyed\nchild and agree that they will put it up for adoption after birth\nshould it not possess such characteristics, notes\n\n\nit is not the desire to select that violates the principle of\nunconditional love [or other parental virtues], but rather the plan to\nreject the child if it does not live up to expectations \u2026 it is\nentirely possible to want to select characteristics while not having\nthis problematic attitude of rejection. (Wilkinson 2010: 29)\n\n\nSome suggest, however, that although selection is not necessarily\nmorally problematic, we should still be concerned that a selective\nmentality may be a precursor of conditional, as opposed to\nunconditional, love once the child is born, or to unrealistic\nexpectations and feelings of entitlement. Thus, the suggestion here is\nthat people who go to great lengths and incur great expense in\nprocuring what are, for them, the \u2018perfect\u2019 gametes, may\nbe more likely to reject or otherwise mistreat their children should\nthey fail to develop the \u2018right\u2019 capacities and interests\n(see, for example: Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). Again, however, it is not\nat all clear that the link between a selective mentality in\nreproduction and overzealous and unforgiving parenting styles is a\nnecessary one, as the majority of parents are not liable to be so\nna\u00efve as to \u201cpresume to know what they are getting simply\nbecause they had a hand in selecting some of their child\u2019s\ngenetic features\u201d (Fahmy 2011: 7), or indeed that gamete donor\nselection is as likely as other more expensive and\neffective forms of selective reproduction (such as genetic\nengineering) to produce such problematic expectations and\nattitudes.\n4. Payment\n\nShould gamete providers be paid? If so, should such payments be\nlimited to compensation (possibly including compensation for time and\ninconvenience)? Or is incentivising or rewarding providers also\nmorally acceptable?\n\nIn favour of payment, the main reason cited is increased supply, thus\nenabling recipients to have children that they wouldn\u2019t\notherwise have had\u2014or, where scarcity per se is not an\nissue, giving recipients more choice. In addition, supporters of\npayment cite justice (gamete providers deserve to be rewarded) and\nautonomy (providers and recipients should be allowed to contract with\neach other as they see fit). Finally, pragmatic arguments are\nsometimes offered, such as the cost of prohibition or the possibility\nof its leading to an unregulated \u2018black\u2019 or\n\u2018grey\u2019 market in gametes. (Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004;\nWilkinson 2013)\n4.1 Familiar Arguments from Other Contexts\n\nSome of the arguments and issues concerning payment for gametes\nclosely resemble ones arising in other areas such as organ sales, sex\nwork, and commercial surrogacy (see the entries on\n exploitation,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n feminist perspectives on sex markets,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the sale of human organs).\n We deal with these briefly here before moving on to consider in\ngreater detail some of the more distinctive issues raised by paying\ngamete providers. The focus here is on gametes for clinical use in\nhuman reproduction, rather than gametes for research purposes,\nalthough many of the same issues also arise in a research setting.\n4.1.1. Harm and/or Risk to Donors\n\nOne of the most obvious issues is harm or risk to the providers\n(Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004).\n\nIn the case of sperm, the physical risks of donating are negligible,\nbut concerns have been raised about psychosocial risks, especially if\none man is permitted to generate numerous offspring. What happens, for\nexample, if a single sperm donor produces hundreds of children and a\nsignificant proportion of those contact him years later? That could\nhave a significant impact on the man\u2019s life (and on the welfare\nof the children, discussed below). One way of containing this risk\nwould be to limit donor offspring numbers; another would be to allow\ndonor anonymity, although that may be objectionable on other grounds\n(see our earlier discussions of donor anonymity and donor offspring\nlimits).\n\nProducing hundreds of children is unlikely to be a problem for egg\ndonors but, unlike sperm donors, these women do face non-negligible\nphysical risks: notably OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome).\n\nAs with the organ sale debate, though, it is not clear why the\nexistence of these risks constitutes an objection to payment,\nas opposed to an objection to the whole practice of gamete\ndonation (paid or otherwise) since the risks don\u2019t increase\nas a result of payment (Wilkinson 2013). In response to this, in the\ncase of sperm donation, it could be argued that the scenario where one\nman produces hundreds of children is much more likely to happen if\npayment is allowed, as some men seek to become \u2018professional\nsperm donors\u2019. As has been noted, however, it should be possible\nto neutralise this risk by enforcing donor offspring limits.\n4.1.2. Consent, Exploitation, and Inducements\n\nAnother set of issues is the negative effect that payments, or\npayments above a certain level, are supposed to have on the quality of\nconsent\u2014a concern that is closely linked to worries about\nexploitation. Financial incentives, it is argued, encourage people to\ndo things that they would not otherwise do, encourage them to do\nthings that are harmful, and make their actions, consents, and\ndecisions less likely to be autonomous and voluntary (Resnick 2001;\nSteinbock 2004; Wilkinson 2013). These arguments are more often\ndirected at paid egg donation than paid sperm donation, because the\ndirect physical risks and the sums of money involved for eggs tend to\nbe much greater. Thus, people have been concerned that vulnerable\nyoung egg donors might be lured into the egg market and then exploited\nby clinics, egg banks, or recipients. These concerns structurally\nparallel ones that people often have about commercial surrogacy and\nsex work.\n\nArguments of this kind are dealt with in much more detail in the\nentries on\n Exploitation,\n Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets,\n Parenthood and Procreation,\n Informed Consent, and\n The Sale of Human Organs.\n For the present, we simply note that, while the possibility of\ndefective consent and exploitation must be taken seriously in any\nsystem of paid gamete donation, there seems no reason in principle why\npaying for gametes must be exploitative, nor why it cannot be validly\nconsented to. Provided that the payment-levels are fair, and that the\nprovider\u2019s situation, mental capacities, and access to\ninformation are all sufficiently favourable, it is hard to see\nwhy\u2014in common with other financial transactions\u2014gamete\nprovision can\u2019t be validly consensual and non-exploitative.\n4.1.3. Commercialisation and Selection\n\nFinally, we note here that there is a connection between remuneration\narrangements and selection practices (discussed above). In particular,\none objection to allowing payment\u2014or at least to the unfettered\ncommercialisation of gametes\u2014is that it may encourage a market\nin which particular traits can, for those willing to pay a high price,\nbe aggressively selected for. For example, in the USA, young\nattractive white female egg donors attending \u2018Ivy League\u2019\nuniversities can command a higher fee for their eggs than other\ndonors\u2014and anyone who is willing to pay can have access to those\neggs. So, anyone who regards selection practices like this as\nproblematic may also regard the commercialisation of gametes as\nproblematic inasmuch as it underpins and enables fine-grained\nselection by \u2018gamete consumers\u2019 to take place.\n4.2 Payment and the Welfare of the Child\n\nWe turn now to some of the more \u2018distinctive\u2019 issues\nrelating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of\nthe child created. While this issue is \u2018distinctive\u2019\ninasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,\nfor example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,\nnotably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000).\n\nThe main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out\nthat money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,\nthis will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme case,\nthey may come to feel that they were \u2018bought\u2019 (HFEA 2011).\nWhat follows from this possibility, however, is unclear.\n\nTo start with, there are empirical questions about how many\ndonor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their\nnegative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have\nnegative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may\nnot care what their donors\u2019 motives were. So, if this concern is\ngoing to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid\nevidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises.\n\nSimilarly, there is a set of questions not so much about what donors\u2019\nactual motives are, but about what they write on their\ndonation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to\ntheir offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the\nchild, it would be better for donors to \u2018tell a story\u2019\n(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find\nmore palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.\nAnother is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with\nappropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then\nany problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2013).\n\nStill, let\u2019s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that\nthese problems are insurmountable: that\u2014whatever we do\u2014a\nsignificant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially\nharmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from\nthis?\n\nFirst, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of\nthe Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that\n(let\u2019s assume) many paid sperm donors would not have donated\nbut for the money, it is plausible to supposed that children who\nsuffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors\nwould not have existed if there hadn\u2019t been payments.\nTherefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,\nthey may not be harmed by the practice of payment\u2014or at\nleast not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off\nthan they would otherwise have been). (See the entry on the\n non-identity problem.)\n So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against\npayment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal\nwelfare considerations.\n\nGiven this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an\nadequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the\nreasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as\nadministrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)\nthen the fact that payment will adversely affect the welfare of donor-conceived children does\nlooks like a good (albeit prima facie) reason to prefer\naltruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a\npopulation of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a\ndifferent but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as\nwe\u2019re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life\nthen there is a strong \u2018impersonal\u2019 reason, other things\nbeing equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look\nrather different though if the choice is instead between a population\nof donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different and\nsignificantly smaller population, for then it would be necessary\nto \u2018trade off\u2019 a higher average quality of life against\nboth (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm\ndone to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a\ndonor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and\nthis goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure\nan adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things\nconsidered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived\npeople\u2019s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016).\n4.3 Egg Sharing\n\nSome countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or\nstrictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby\n\u2018egg sharers\u2019 (women who are themselves undergoing\ninfertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)\ncan receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price\ninfertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments\nto egg donors to \u00a3750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can\nhave their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds\n(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13).\n\nThis raises the question of whether ethically egg sharing is\npreferable to egg selling and, if so, why\u2014along with the closely\nrelated question of whether egg sharing should be treated more\nfavourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth & Golding\n2008).\n\nThe main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that\n\u2018sharers\u2019 are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk\nthan donors (paid or otherwise), since they are already\nundergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing\ntreatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg\nsharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than\nincentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness\nof encouraging people to take \u2018excessive\u2019 risks, or\nbecause financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks\n(Wilkinson 2013).\n\nThis does seem like a sound prima facie reason to prefer egg\nsharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special\ntypes of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who\ndon\u2019t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of\nhaving a child by giving away \u2018surplus\u2019 eggs (Scott,\nWilliams, Ehrich, & Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,\nconcerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as\nto egg sellers, especially if some of these are\n\u2018desperate\u2019 to have a child and egg sharing is their only\nway of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth & Golding\n2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument\u2014if it\nworked\u2014would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid\ndonation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks\nare the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013).\n\nA different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably\nthan egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers\u2019 motives\nwill typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In\nparticular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically\nmotivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a\nsense of solidarity with potential recipients\u2014in particular\nbecause both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.\nBoth need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a\nchild (HFEA 2011; Prainsack & Buyx 2011).\n\nHowever, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of\nbenefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from\nclear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes:\n\n\nWhat is known about donor motivation \u2026 is that it is\nmultifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and\ncompetent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,\nburdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An\nincentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely\nbecause of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both\ndonors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:\nsection 2, 4.4 [p. 8])\n\n\nThis suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical\ndifference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg\nsharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may\nbe more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid\ndonors would be \u2018in it just for the money\u2019, others\n(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility\nproblems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could\nbe moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that\nthey are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no\nmeans obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of\nsolidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.\nIndeed, it is by no means obvious even that most egg sharers\nare motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases\nwhen state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings\n2009).\n\nFinally, and more fundamentally, even if donations motivated\nby altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more\nself-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for\nmoney, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter\nare wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former\nare supererogatory: that while paid donation is merely\npermissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity that\ngoes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).\n",
