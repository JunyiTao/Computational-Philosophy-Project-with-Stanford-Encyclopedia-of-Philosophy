In this case we are\ninterested in how the information flow among scientists impacts their\ndistribution of research across different rival hypotheses. The\nimportance of scientific interaction for the production of scientific\nknowledge has traditionally been emphasized in social epistemology\n(Goldman 1999). But how exactly does the structure of communication\nimpact scientists\u2019 generation of knowledge? Are scientists\nbetter off communicating within strongly connected social networks, or\nrather within less connected ones, and under which conditions of\ninquiry? These and related questions belong to the field of\nnetwork epistemology, which studies the impact of\ncommunication networks on the process of knowledge acquisition.\nNetwork epistemology has its origin in economics, sociology and\norganizational sciences (e.g., Granovetter 1973; Burt 1992; Jackson\n& Wolinsky 1996; Bala & Goyal 1998) and it was first combined\nwith agent-based modeling in the philosophical literature by Zollman\n(2007) (see also Zollman 2013).\n\nSimulations of scientific interaction originated in the idea that\ndifferent communication networks among scientists, characterized by\nvarying degrees of connectedness (see\n Figure 1),\n may have a different impact on the balance between\n\u201cexploration\u201d and \u201cexploitation\u201d of scientific\nideas. Suppose a scientist is trying to find an optimal treatment for\na certain disease, since the existing one is insufficiently effective.\nOn the one hand, she could pursue the currently dominant hypothesis\nconcerning the causes of the disease, hoping that it will eventually\nlead to better results. On the other hand, she could explore novel\nideas hoping to have a breakthrough leading to a more successful cure\nfor the disease. The scientist thus faces a trade-off between\nexploitation as the use of existing ideas and exploration as the\nsearch of new possibilities, long studied in theories of formal\nlearning and in organizational sciences (March 1991). The information\nflow among scientists could impact this trade-off in the following\nway: if an initially misleading idea is shared too quickly throughout\nthe community, scientists may lock-in on researching it, prematurely\nabandoning the search for better solutions. Alternatively, if the\ninformation flow is slow and sparse, important insights gained by some\nscientists, which could lead to an optimal solution, may remain\nundetected by the rest of the community for a lengthy period of time.\nABMs were introduced to investigate whether and in which circumstances\nthe information flow could have either of these effects. For instance,\nif scientists are assumed to be rational agents, could a tightly\nconnected community end up exploring too little and miss out on\nsignificant lines of inquiry?\n\nBesides studying communities consisting of \u201cepistemically\nuncompromised\u201d scientists\u2014that is, agents whose inquiry\nand actions are directed at discovering and promoting the\ntruth\u2014similar questions can be posed about communities in which\nepistemic interests have been overridden. For instance, the impact of\nindustrial interest groups on science may lead to biased or deceptive\npractices, which may sway the scientific community away from its\nepistemic goals (Holman & Elliott 2018). While recent\nphilosophical discussions on this problem have largely focused on the\nrole of non-epistemic values in science (Douglas 2009; Holman &\nWilholt 2022; Bueter 2022; Peters 2021), ABMs were introduced to\nexamine how epistemically pernicious strategies can impact the process\nof inquiry, as well as to identify interventions that can be used to\nmitigate their harmful effects.\n\nIn addition to the problem of theoretical diversity, network\nepistemology has been applied to a number of other themes, such as\noptimal forms of collaboration, factors leading to scientific\npolarization, effects of conformity on the collective inquiry, effects\nof demographic diversity, the position of minorities, optimal\nregulations of dual-use research, argumentation dynamics, and so\nforth. We will look at the models studying theoretical diversity and\nthe communication structure of science in\n Section 4.2\n and\n Section 4.6.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nFigure 1: Three types of idealized\ncommunication networks, representing an increasing degree of\nconnectedness: (a) a cycle, (b) a wheel, and (c) a complete graph. The\nnodes in each graph stand for scientists, while edges between the\nnodes stand for information channels between two scientists.\n\n",
