Extensions of the Theory of Descriptions\n\nThe analysis of descriptions has been extended from canonical examples\nof descriptions (expressions of the form \u2018the F\u2019\nand \u2018an F\u2019) to expressions that don\u2019t have\nthis surface form. As we noted in section 3, one of the key\nmotivations for Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions was the idea\nthat it could ameliorate the problem of non-denoting\nexpressions\u2014expressions like \u2018the golden mountain\u2019,\nand \u2018the present king of France\u2019. But the account has been\nextended to other constructions as well, including proper names,\npronouns, and temporal anaphors, all with mixed results.\n",
