    "main_text": "\n\nOf knowledge naught remained I did not know,\nOf secrets, scarcely any, high or low;\nAll day and night for three score and twelve years,\nI pondered, just to learn that naught I know.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Sa\u2018id\u012b \n  1991, 125)\n\nUmar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of the 11th century CE. Whereas his mathematical works and poetry have been the subject of much discussion, his recently edited and published philosophical works have remained a largely neglected area of study. In what follows, we shall review and comment on the salient features of Khayyam\u2019s poetry and philosophy, their relationship with one another, and Khayyam\u2019s pioneering views on mathematics.\nTraditionally, Umar Khayyam\u2019s significance in the annals of Islamic intellectual tradition is due to his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t (quatrains) and his scientific works, especially those in the field of mathematics. The latter have always been overshadowed by his poetry. In recent years, critical editions of the philosophical works of Khayyam have been published which not only provide us with an insight into his philosophical thought but also provide a context for a more philosophical interpretation of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t.\nIn his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Khayyam challenged religious doctrines, alluded to the hypocrisy of the clergy, cast doubt on almost every facet of religious belief, and appears to have advocated a type of humanism. It is no wonder that some referred to him as the \u201cEastern Voltaire\u201d (Dole 1901, 81). This Western image, solidified by the Victorian sense of the exotic, romantic, and often erotic notions attached to the East, was echoed through the rendition of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t by Edward FitzGerald in the 19th century.\n",
