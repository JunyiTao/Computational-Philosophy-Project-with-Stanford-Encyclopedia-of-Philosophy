    "main_text": "\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (1149\u20131210) was one of the\nmost innovative and influential thinkers in the first stage of what is\nsometimes called \u201cpost-classical\u201d Islamic thought. Along\nwith other major thinkers of the Islamic East in the twelfth century,\nnotably Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b and\nal-Suhraward\u012b, Fakhr al-D\u012bn reacted critically to the\nphilosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna). He produced a voluminous\ncorpus that is often elusive in terms of conveying Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn\u2019s own considered opinions, but is packed with subtle\nphilosophical argumentation on pretty well every aspect of Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s thought. Fakhr al-D\u012bn did also stake out\ndistinctive positions of his own, for example with respect to the\nproblem of providing real definitions, the distinction between essence\nand existence, the principles of physics, the unity of the human soul,\nand the source of ethical norms. This abundant output in philosophy\nwas only one part of his life\u2019s work, which includes texts on\nIslamic law, theology, astrology, and one of history\u2019s most\nimportant commentaries on the Quran.\n",
