    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues of Secession || The distinction between a (mere) justification and having a claim-right\n1.1 The distinction between a (mere) justification and having a claim-right\n\n\nWe begin with a distinction between unilateral and consensual\nsecession. The former is secession without the consent of the state\nfrom which a portion of territory is taken by the seceding group or\nwithout constitutional sanction. A theory of the right to unilateral\nsecession is most urgently needed, not only because unilateral\nsecession occurs more frequently than consensual secession, but also\nbecause it is both more controversial and more likely to result in\nlarge-scale violence.\n\n\nConsensual secession results either from a negotiated agreement\nbetween the state and the secessionists (as occurred when Norway\nseceded from Sweden in 1905) or through constitutional processes (as\nthe Supreme Court of Canada recently envisioned for the secession\nof\n Quebec).[1] \n Constitutionally\nsanctioned secession is achieved either by the exercise of an explicit\nconstitutional right to secede (which only a few constitutions\ncurrently contain) or by constitutional amendment.\n\n\nA second important distinction is between being justified in\nseceding unilaterally and have a (claim-) right to unilateral\nsecession. It is not always clear whether a theorist is advancing a\ntheory of the conditions under which secession is morally justified\n(that is, the conditions under which a group has a moral liberty-right\nor mere moral permission to secede), or a theory of the conditions\nunder which a group has the claim-right to secede unilaterally. Talk\nabout \u201cthe right to secede\u201d is often ambiguous between\nthese alternatives. A claim-right includes not only a liberty-right or\nmere permission (i.e., that a group is justified in seceding in the\nsense that if they do so they do not thereby act impermissibly), but\nalso a correlative obligation on the part of others not to interfere\nwith the attempted secession.\n\n\nThe distinction between establishing that a group is morally\njustified in unilaterally seceding (in the sense of having a\nliberty-right) and establishing that the group has a moral claim-right\nto unilaterally secede is crucial, though it is rarely explicitly drawn\nby philosophers writing about secession. Having the liberty-right does\nnot imply having the claim-right: a group might be morally justified in\nseceding and yet it might not be the case that others (including the\nstate from which the group is seceding) are obligated to refrain from\ninterfering with the group\u2019s attempt to secede.\n\n\nTherefore, an argument that suffices to establish that a group is\njustified in seceding under such and such conditions may not suffice to\nestablish that the group has a (claim-) right to secede under those\nconditions. Yet when philosophers attempt to develop a moral theory of\nsecession by appealing to intuitions about hypothetical examples of\nsecession, it is often unclear whether the intuition elicited is about\nthe moral justifiability of the secession (the mere permissibility) or\nabout the existence of a moral claim-right.\n",
