    "main_text": "Further Clarification\n2. Further Clarification\nAgain, EC is a semantic thesis: it concerns the truth conditions of \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences, and/or the propositions expressed by utterances thereof.[4] The thesis is that it is only relative to a contextually-determined standard that a \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentence expresses a complete proposition: change the standard, and you change what the sentence expresses; acontextually, however, no such proposition is expressed. In this respect, \u2018knowledge\u2019 utterances are supposed to resemble utterances involving uncontroversially context-sensitive terms. For instance, just what proposition is expressed by an utterance of\n\n\u2018It is raining,\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m hungry,\u2019 or\n\u2018That\u2019s red,\u2019\n\ndepends upon such facts as the location or identity of the speaker, and/or the referent of the demonstrative. Similarly, it is plausible (though not universally accepted\u2014see, e.g., Capellen and LePore, 2005a & b) that \u2018tallness\u2019 and \u2018flatness\u2019 are context-sensitive, insofar as there are varying standards that one might have mind in applying either predicate which affect what is thereby said. Note, though, that insofar as the truth value of such utterances depends on context, that is because their truth conditions\u2014or, the propositions expressed thereby\u2014are so dependent. That is, it is not that (1)-(3) each has fixed truth-evaluable content, the truth value of which depends on context. Rather, what propositions these sentences express depends on the location of the utterer of (1), the identity of the speaker (2), and so on. It is only relative to such facts that tokenings of such sentences have specific contents, and just what contents they do have depends on context. So too for EC. It is misleading to say that \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences\u2019 truth values are context-variable (e.g., Rieber 1998, 190, Cohen 1998, 289 and 2014, 70). According to EC, those truth values shift only because different propositions are expressed in different contexts.\nLikewise, just because EC is a thesis about \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences\u2019 truth conditions, it is not a thesis about the nature of the attributed \u201cknowledge\u201d. In the same way: the token-reflexivity of \u2018I\u2019 has no metaphysical implications about the self, that \u2018here\u2019 is an indexical has no implications about who\u2019s where or what it is to be at some location, etc. So it is misleading too when attributor contextualism is described as bearing on the nature of knowledge or as implying that whether one knows depends upon context (see Bach 2005, 55, n. 4 for some examples). EC concerns the standards, not for the \u201cknowledge\u201d attributed, but for the application of the term \u2018knowledge\u2019 and cognate expressions (Feldman 2004, 24; cf. Cohen 1999, 65; Bach 2005, 54\u201355).\nEC, then, is an epistemological theory because, and only because, it concerns sentences using \u2018knowledge\u2019 and kindred expressions, as opposed to those employing non-epistemic terms; it is not a theory about any epistemic property or relation itself. Nonetheless, as we will see, when various proponents of EC flesh out their preferred version of the views, the differences among the resulting theories mirror some major lines of division among leading theories of knowledge.\nFinally, EC should be distinguished from the general semantical-linguistic approach, or cluster of theses, called \u201ccontextualism,\u201d which sees context as central in one or another way to certain fundamental linguistic issues, most centrally meaning itself. (See, e.g., Recanati (1989, 1994, 2005), Searle (1980).)\n",
