    "main_text": "Objectivity as Absence of Normative Commitments and the Value-Free Ideal || Acceptance of Scientific Hypotheses and Value Neutrality\n3.2 Acceptance of Scientific Hypotheses and Value Neutrality\n\nLacey\u2019s characterization of value-free science and the VNT were\nonce mainstream positions in philosophy of science. Their widespread\nacceptance was closely connected to Reichenbach\u2019s famous\ndistinction between context of discovery and\ncontext of justification. Reichenbach first made this\ndistinction with respect to the epistemology of mathematics:\n\n\nthe objective relation from the given entities to the solution, and\nthe subjective way of finding it, are clearly separated for problems\nof a deductive character [\u2026] we must learn to make the same\ndistinction for the problem of the inductive relation from facts to\ntheories. (Reichenbach 1938: 36\u201337)\n\n\nThe standard interpretation of this statement marks contextual values,\nwhich may have contributed to the discovery of a theory, as irrelevant\nfor justifying the acceptance of a theory, and for assessing\nhow evidence bears on theory\u2014the relation that is crucial for\nthe objectivity of science. Contextual values are restricted to a\nmatter of individual psychology that may influence the discovery,\ndevelopment and proliferation of a scientific theory, but not its\nepistemic status.\n\nThis distinction played a crucial role in post-World War II philosophy\nof science. It presupposes, however, a clear-cut distinction between\ncognitive values on the one hand and contextual values on the other.\nWhile this may be prima facie plausible for disciplines such\nas physics, there is an abundance of contextual values in the social\nsciences, for instance, in the conceptualization and measurement of a\nnation\u2019s wealth, or in different ways to measure the inflation\nrate (cf. Dupr\u00e9 2007; Reiss 2008). More generally, three major\nlines of criticism can be identified.\n\nFirst, Helen Longino (1996) has argued that traditional cognitive\nvalues such as consistency, simplicity, breadth of scope and\nfruitfulness are not purely cognitive or epistemic after all, and that\ntheir use imports political and social values into contexts of\nscientific judgment. According to her, the use of cognitive values in\nscientific judgments is not always, not even normally, politically\nneutral. She proposes to juxtapose these values with feminist values\nsuch as novelty, ontological heterogeneity, mutuality of interaction,\napplicability to human needs and diffusion of power, and argues that\nthe use of the traditional value instead of its alternative (e.g.,\nsimplicity instead of ontological heterogeneity) can lead to biases\nand adverse research results. Longino\u2019s argument here is\ndifferent from the one discussed in\n section 3.1.\n It casts the very distinction between cognitive and contextual values\ninto doubt.\n\nThe second argument against the possibility of value-free science is\nsemantic and attacks the neutrality of scientific theories: fact and\nvalue are frequently entangled because of the use of so-called\n\u201cthick\u201d ethical concepts in science (Putnam\n2002)\u2014i.e., ethical concepts that have mixed descriptive and\nnormative content. For example, a description such as \u201cdangerous\ntechnology\u201d involves a value judgment about the technology and\nthe risks it implies, but it also has a descriptive content: it is\nuncertain and hard to predict whether using that technology will\nreally trigger those risks. If the use of such terms, where facts and\nvalues are inextricably entangled, is inevitable in scientific\nreasoning, it is impossible to describe hypotheses and results in a\nvalue-free manner, undermining the value-neutrality thesis.\n\nIndeed, John Dupr\u00e9 has argued that thick ethical terms are\nineliminable from science, at least certain parts of it (Dupr\u00e9\n2007). Dupr\u00e9\u2019s point is essentially that scientific\nhypotheses and results concern us because they are relevant to human\ninterests, and thus they will necessarily be couched in a language\nthat uses thick ethical terms. While it will often be possible to\ntranslate ethically thick descriptions into neutral ones, the\ntranslation cannot be made without losses, and these losses obtain\nprecisely because human interests are involved (see\n section 6.2\n for a case study from social science). According to Dupr\u00e9,\nthen, many scientific statements are value-free only because their\ntruth or falsity does not matter to us:\n\n\nWhether electrons have a positive or a negative charge and whether\nthere is a black hole in the middle of our galaxy are questions of\nabsolutely no immediate importance to us. The only human interests\nthey touch (and these they may indeed touch deeply) are cognitive\nones, and so the only values that they implicate are cognitive values.\n(2007: 31)\n\n\nA third challenge to the VNT, and perhaps the most influential one,\nwas raised first by Richard Rudner in his influential article\n\u201cThe Scientist Qua Scientist Makes Value Judgments\u201d\n(Rudner 1953). Rudner disputes the core of the VNT and the context of\ndiscovery/justification distinction: the idea that the acceptance of a\nscientific theory can in principle be value-free. First, Rudner argues\nthat\n\n\nno analysis of what constitutes the method of science would be\nsatisfactory unless it comprised some assertion to the effect that the\nscientist as scientist accepts or rejects hypotheses.\n(1953: 2)\n\n\nThis assumption stems from industrial quality control and other\napplication-oriented research. In such contexts, it is often necessary\nto accept or to reject a hypothesis (e.g., the efficacy of a drug) in\norder to make effective decisions.\n\nSecond, he notes that no scientific hypothesis is ever confirmed\nbeyond reasonable doubt\u2014some probability of error always\nremains. When we accept or reject a hypothesis, there is always a\nchance that our decision is mistaken. Hence, our decision is also\n\u201ca function of the importance, in the typically ethical\nsense, of making a mistake in accepting or rejecting a\nhypothesis\u201d (1953: 2): we are balancing the seriousness of two\npossible errors (erroneous acceptance/rejection of the hypothesis)\nagainst each other. This corresponds to type I and type II error in\nstatistical inference.\n\nThe decision to accept or reject a hypothesis involves a value\njudgment (at least implicitly) because scientists have to judge which\nof the consequences of an erroneous decision they deem more palatable:\n(1) some individuals die of the side effects of a drug erroneously\njudged to be safe; or (2) other individuals die of a condition because\nthey did not have access to a treatment that was erroneously judged to\nbe unsafe. Hence, ethical judgments and contextual values necessarily\nenter the scientist\u2019s core activity of accepting and rejecting\nhypotheses, and the VNT stands refuted. Closely related arguments can\nbe found in Churchman (1948) and Braithwaite (1953). Hempel (1965:\n91\u201392) gives a modified account of Rudner\u2019s argument by\ndistinguishing between judgments of confirmation, which are\nfree of contextual values, and judgments of acceptance. Since\neven strongly confirming evidence cannot fully prove a universal\nscientific law, we have to live with a residual \u201cinductive\nrisk\u201d in inferring that law. Contextual values influence\nscientific methods by determining the acceptable amount of inductive\nrisk (see also Douglas 2000).\n\nBut how general are Rudner\u2019s objections? Apparently, his result\nholds true of applied science, but not necessarily of fundamental\nresearch. For the latter domain, two major lines of rebuttals have\nbeen proposed. First, Richard Jeffrey (1956) notes that lawlike\nhypotheses in theoretical science (e.g., the gravitational law in\nNewtonian mechanics) are characterized by their general scope and not\nconfined to a particular application. Obviously, a scientist cannot\nfine-tune her decisions to their possible consequences in a wide\nvariety of different contexts. So she should just refrain from the\nessentially pragmatic decision to accept or reject hypotheses. By\nrestricting scientific reasoning to gathering and interpreting\nevidence, possibly supplemented by assessing the probability of a\nhypothesis, Jeffrey tries to save the VNT in fundamental scientific\nresearch, and the objectivity of scientific reasoning.\n\nSecond, Isaac Levi (1960) observes that scientists commit themselves\nto certain standards of inference when they become a member of the\nprofession. This may, for example, lead to the statistical rejection\nof a hypothesis when the observed significance level is smaller than\n5%. These community standards may eliminate any room for contextual\nethical judgment on behalf of the scientist: they determine when she\nshould accept a hypothesis as established. Value judgments may be\nimplicit in how a scientific community sets standards of inference\n(compare\n section 5.1),\n but not in the daily work of an individual scientist (cf.\nWilholt 2013).\n\nBoth defenses of the VNT focus on the impact of values in theory\nchoice, either by denying that scientists actually choose theories\n(Jeffrey), or by referring to community standards and restricting the\nVNT to the individual scientist (Levi). Douglas (2000: 563\u2013565)\npoints out, however, that the \u201cacceptance\u201d of scientific\ntheories is only one of several places for values to enter scientific\nreasoning, albeit an especially prominent and explicit one. Many\ndecisions in the process of scientific inquiry may conceal implicit\nvalue judgments: the design of an experiment, the methodology for\nconducting it, the characterization of the data, the choice of a\nstatistical method for processing and analyzing data, the\ninterpretational process findings, etc. None of these methodological\ndecisions could be made without consideration of the possible\nconsequences that could occur. Douglas gives, as a case study, a\nseries of experiments where carcinogenic effects of dioxin exposure on\nrats were probed. Contextual values such as safety and risk aversion\naffected the conducted research at various stages: first, in the\nclassification of pathological samples as benign or cancerous (over\nwhich a lot of expert disagreement occurred), second, in the\nextrapolation from the high-dose experimental conditions to the more\nrealistic low-dose conditions. In both cases, the choice of a\nconservative classification or model had to be weighed against the\nadverse consequences for society that could result from\nunderestimating the risks (see also Biddle 2013).\n\nThese diagnoses cast a gloomy light on attempts to divide scientific\nlabor between gathering evidence and determining the degree of\nconfirmation (value-free) on the one hand and accepting scientific\ntheories (value-laden) on the other. The entire process of\nconceptualizing, gathering and interpreting evidence is so entangled\nwith contextual values that no neat division, as Jeffrey envisions,\nwill work outside the narrow realm of statistical inference\u2014and\neven there, doubts may be raised\n (see section 4.2).\n\nPhilip Kitcher (2011a: 31\u201340; see also Kitcher 2011b) gives an\nalternative argument, based on his idea of \u201csignificant\ntruths\u201d. There are simply too many truths that are of no\ninterest whatsoever, such as the total number of offside positions in\na low-level football competition. Science, then, doesn\u2019t aim at\ntruth simpliciter but rather at something more narrow: truth\nworth pursuing from the point of view of our cognitive, practical and\nsocial goals. Any truth that is worth pursuing in this sense is what\nhe calls a \u201csignificant truth\u201d. Clearly, it is value\njudgments that help us decide whether or not any given truth is\nsignificant.\n\nKitcher goes on to observing that the process of scientific\ninvestigation cannot neatly be divided into a stage in which the\nresearch question is chosen, one in which the evidence is gathered and\none in which a judgment about the question is made on the basis of the\nevidence. Rather, the sequence is multiply iterated, and at each\nstage, the researcher has to decide whether previous results warrant\npursuit of the current line of research, or whether she should switch\nto another avenue. Such choices are laden with contextual values.\n\nValues in science also interact, according to Kitcher, in a\nnon-trivial way. Assume we endorse predictive accuracy as an important\ngoal of science. However, there may not be a convincing strategy to\nreach this goal in some domain of science, for instance because that\ndomain is characterized by strong non-linear dependencies. In this\ncase, predictive accuracy might have to yield to achieving other\nvalues, such as consistency with theories in neighbor domains.\nConversely, changing social goals lead to re-evaluations of scientific\nknowledge and research methods.\n\nScience, then, cannot be value-free because no scientist ever works\nexclusively in the supposedly value-free zone of assessing and\naccepting hypotheses. Evidence is gathered and hypotheses are assessed\nand accepted in the light of their potential for application and\nfruitful research avenues. Both cognitive and contextual value\njudgments guide these choices and are themselves influenced by their\nresults.\n",
