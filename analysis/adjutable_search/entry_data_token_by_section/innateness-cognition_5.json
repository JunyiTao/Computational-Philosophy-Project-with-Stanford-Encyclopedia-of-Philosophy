    "main_text": "Empirical Findings and Theories || Number\n2.3 Number\n2.3.1 The analog number system\n\n\nThere is currently a great deal of empirical research\u2014and\nphilosophically sophisticated\n debate[21]\u2014on\nthe underpinnings of numerical knowledge\nin adults and children. There is strong evidence for the view\nthat in addition to an exact number system that underlies\nformal mathematical thinking, adults also have an analog magnitude\nsystem for representing approximate number (see Dehaene\n1997). For example, if we are very briefly shown 2 bowls of rice,\none with 20 grains and one with 50, we can tell immediately which has\nmore, even though we couldn\u2019t say exactly how many grains of rice\nwere in either. Similarly, shown a book with 70 pages and a book\nwith 100 pages, we can see instantly which has more pages\u2014though\nagain without knowing the exact number of pages in either book.\nControlled tests show that such judgments are independent of variables\nthat correlate with magnitude, such as the extent of space occupied or\nthe size of the individual stimuli. The \u2018signature\u2019\nof this analog magnitude system is its ratio dependence: that\nis, the difficulty in comparing two analog magnitudes decreases as the\nratio difference between them grows. Recent studies indicate that\nthe smallest ratio difference needed for adults to successfully\ndiscriminate 2 different analog magnitudes is 8:7. If the ratio\nis smaller, error rates in comparing magnitudes spike up.\n\nAnalog magnitude representations in\ninfants. Recent studies have shown have\nshown that 6-month-olds use this same analog system to discriminate\nnumerical arrays (McCrink & Wynn 2004b; Xu\n& Spelke 2000). In one study (Xu & Spelke 2000),\ninfants were habituated to displays of either 8 dots or 16 dots.\nWhen shown novel dot displays, babies who had originally seen 16 dots\ndishabituated to displays of 8, but remained habituated to the new\ndisplays of 16. Similarly, babies who had been habituated to 8\ndots dishabituated to novel displays of 16, but not novel displays of 8\ndots. (Again, researchers controlled for the cumulative amount of\nspace occupied by the dots, the density of the dots, and the size of\nthe dots.) A series of studies have now shown that 6-month-old\nbabies can use the analog magnitude system successfully so long as the\nmagnitudes differ by a 2:1 ratio. When presented with dots\ndisplays that have a 3:2 ratio, such as 24 to 16, babies this age do\nnot show discrimination. Note that the necessary ratio for\ndiscrimination gets smaller with age, so that 9-month-olds succeed when\nthe magnitudes differ by 3 to 2. One might have thought that this\nability to discriminate approximate quantities is somehow implemented\nin the visual system, but the analog number system has been shown to\noperate at a more abstract level (or perhaps to be implemented in a\nnumber of perceptual modalities). At any given age, the same\nratio applies no matter whether the stimulus is a number of dots in a\nspatial array or the number of tones in an auditory sequence (Lipton\n& Spelke, 2003)\u2014or even a number of events (jumps) in a\nvisual display (Wood & Spelke, 2005).\n\n\nNot only do these representations support comparisons of magnitude,\nthey have also been shown to support approximate addition and\nsubtraction in babies as young as 9-months-old. In one study,\nbabies were presented with a set of 5 objects that moved behind a\nscreen so they were no longer visible. Then another set of 5\nobjects was presented and they too moved behind the screen. When\nthe screen was removed, babies looked longer if there were only 5 objects\nthan if there were 10. In a parallel subtraction condition, where\nbabies first saw 10 objects move behind the screen, and then saw\n5 objects taken away, they stared longer when the screen was removed to\nshow a display of 10 objects (McCrink & Wynn, 2004a).\n\n\nThe approximative analog system we have been discussing is different\nfrom the object-tracking system mentioned earlier (for instance, in the graham cracker\nstudy). The infant\u2019s object-tracking system has a severely\nlimited set size, and this is true of the adult\u2019s tracking system\nas well. The analog magnitude system does not. It has also\nbeen found that infants\u2019 success shows the ratio-dependence\nprofile of the analog magnitude system. The fact that 6-month-old\nbabies appear to use the same system of analog representation that\nadults do\u2014although, again, their discriminations are less\nfine\u2014strongly suggests that humans come equipped with an innate\nsystem that makes it possible for them to make relative size\ndistinctions across modalities. Very recently this hypothesis has\nbeen given strong confirmation by a study showing that the analog\nmagnitude system operates in newborn babies (Izard et al. 2009).\nIn this study, newborns were familiarized with auditory sequences\ncontaining a fixed number of syllables and were then tested with\nvisual-spatial images of the same or a different number of\nobjects. Infants spontaneously associated stationary,\nvisual-spatial arrays of 4\u201318 objects with auditory sequences\n(spoken syllables) on the basis of approximate number, providing\nevidence for abstract numerical representations at the very\nbeginning of postnatal\n experience.[22]\n\nIs the analog system species universal? If this\nanalog numerical system is innate, it should be found in all human\nsocieties, no matter how urban or rural, educated or unschooled,\nwhether in technologically advanced societies or remote and isolated\ntribal villages in other parts of the\n world.[23]\nIf it is the same system evident in the\nyoungest infants, it should not require exposure to any symbolic\nrepresentations of number, such as Arabic numerals or a number\nlexicon. To test this hypothesis, investigators explored the\nanalog number system in the Amazonian Munduruku people, an isolated\ntribe whose language has no words for numbers greater than 5. As\npredicted, the Munduruku compared and added large approximate numbers\nfar beyond their naming range. Moreover, performance decreased as\nthe ratios decreased, just as it did in a group of French control\nsubjects (Dehaene et al. 2008).\n\nAnimal representation of approximate quantities. If this\nnumerical system (what Dehaene has called our number sense) is\npart of our innate endowment, might it be evident in other primate\nspecies? Hauser and his colleagues (Hauser et al. 2003)\npresented cotton-top tamarins with auditory sequences of syllables of\ndifferent numerosities. Like humans, monkeys orient their\nattention to unexpected stimuli. When they hear a sequence of\nsyllables of an unexpected numerosity, they turn their heads toward the\naudio speaker from which the sounds are emanating, providing a reliable\nindicator of their discrimination of the novel number. The\nresults are similar to those of the infant studies: cotton-top tamarins\ndiscriminated between sequences of syllables based on approximate\nnumerosity alone. Moreover, discriminability depended on the\nratio of the numbers, just as it does in humans. Indeed, adult\ntamarins showed comparable discrimination abilities to nine-month-old\nhuman babies.\n\n\nThere is now a sizeable literature showing the presence of analog\nmagnitude representations in many different kinds of animals, including\nrats, crows, pigeons, a parrot, rhesus macaques, apes, and dolphins\n(see Carey 2009 for review). In short, there appears to be\nexcellent evidence from studies of human adults, human babies, and\nanimals, all suggesting the presence of an ancient evolutionary system\nof approximate number representation.\n2.3.2 The analog system, the tracking system, and the concept of number\n\n\nIf one steps back from the theoretical heat of the\nEmpiricist-Nativist debates, it should not be surprising that we have\nan innate system for discriminating sets by their approximate size, and\nthat this system is found in other animals too. Animals typically\nneed to take some measure, for example, of the relative size of food\nsources, of the relative number of predators on their left and right\nflanks, and so on. In some animals, these abilities may be part\nof an encapsulated system devoted to a specific task. The\nbee\u2019s awareness of the relative size of a discovered food\nsource\u2014information communicated in the scout\u2019s\ndance\u2014is a popular example of this sort of ability (Frisch\n1953). In other animals, the system operates more broadly, and\ndifferent sorts of inputs can be measured in this way (heard sounds,\nperceived jumps, and so on). It is as if the brain has an\n\u2018accumulator\u2019; a bar graph system of some kind that maps\ninput arrays into some neutral format and appends the elements together\ninto a stack, and a scanner that judges relative stack size.\nGelman and Gallistel and others have explored such systems extensively\n(starting with Gelman & Gallistel 1978).\n\n\nEqually unremarkable is the fact that crawling infants distinguish 1\ncracker from 2 and 2 from 3. This discrimination is beyond the\nabilities of the posited analog approximative systems. But it\nsuggests that there is another system in the child that is in a limited\nway sensitive to number. This system\u2014which seems more tied\nto attention\u2014is the subject of current research (see, for\ninstance, Pylyshyn 2007). Animals need to keep track of changing\nelements in their immediate environment. One idea under investigation is that there\nis a psychological subsystem system that \u2018tags\u2019 elements in\na perceptual array and keeps track of them by assigning properties to\nthe tag. Without such a system, we would lack the ability to\nre-identify changing elements from one moment to the next. Such a\nsystem therefore seems to be a prerequisite for any perception of a\nworld/scene, as involving things that are moving and changing. It\nis difficult to see how an animal that does not track in this way could\nlearn to do so (although the ability might grow).\n\n\nIf current thinking about these systems is on the right track, we\nhave two innate systems, each of which deals with number in some\nsense. The analog system takes a range of perceptual\npresentations and assigns an ordering by relative magnitude. The\nsecond system identifies and tracks (a limited number of) discrete\nelements in an environment. A current research question that is\nof particular interest to philosophers is this: what is the relation of\nthese innate systems to the adult concept of number.\nNotice that the analog system does not get us to the concept of an\nexact number. Only ranges are detected\u2014the system can judge\nthat two sets are in the same range (below the ratio-threshold for\ndiscrimination), but two arrays that are \u201cthe same\u201d in this\nway need not have the same number of elements. The\nsecond system is not approximative. If the subject has\ntracked 2 objects and 1 is added, as in Wynn\u2019s studies, the\ndifference is noted and the subject\u2019s expectations change\naccordingly. So this object-tracking system is sensitive to\nthe number of units in play, and in this respect is closer to\nthe adult notion of number. But it has an extremely constricted\nrange, and is useless when it comes to problems that extend\nbeyond its range. The crawling infant in the study cited earlier\ndoesn\u2019t represent an added 4th cracker as one more\nthan the 3 previously tracked. The infant doesn\u2019t even\ntrack the 4th element: the system seems to\n(eccentrically) shut down completely when its range is exceeded.\nSo the concept of number\u2014the successor function and all that it\nbrings in its wake\u2014is not implemented in this system.\n\n\nFor these reasons, some have argued that aside from these\nwell-evidenced systems, there must be a third element in the human\nmind\u2014viz., an innate concept of number, which must involve the\ngrasp of a fully-general successor function\u2014that grounds adult\nmathematical competence (see Leslie, Gallistel & Gelman 2007,\nfor example). Others, like Carey (2009) have argued that the\nconcept of exact number is not innate, but is constructed by\nthe kind of language-based bootstrapping sketched out by Quine (1960).\nThe debate here is especially interesting because although both sides\nare Nativist\u2014in that both accept innate \u2018numerical\u2019\nsystems\u2014there are still learning elements in play in the search\nfor an adequate psychological account of our distinctive arithmetic\ncompetence.\n\n\nThe simple question: \u201cIs number innate?\u201d turns out to be\ntoo simple. However the current debates play out, we can expect\nthat the achievement of adult number competence is quite complex and\ninvolves significant innate and learned elements. We should be\nprepared to find that things are no less complicated on other\nEmpiricist-Nativist battlegrounds.\n2.4 Mind and Intentional Agency\n2.4.1 The Theory of Mind experimental paradigm\n\n\nIn a seminal paper of 1978, Premack and Woodruff posed the question\nof whether chimpanzees have a \u2018theory of mind\u2019; that is, do\nthey attribute mental states to others, and do they, like adult humans,\npredict and explain action on the basis of hypotheses about these\nstates. It was a mark of Piaget\u2019s influence that no one had\nas yet asked this question in regard to human infants; Piaget thought that they did not yet have a robust notion of an external world at all, let alone of a world containing minds.  The chimp\nstudies led to an explosion of research into the development of a\ntheory of mind in human beings. In responses to Premack and\nWoodruff\u2019s paper, Dennett and others commented that the\nsuccessful prediction of another\u2019s action does not yet constitute\nevidence for a theory of mind. Consider the following: a child\nparticipant in a study is told a story about a boy named Max who has a\npiece of candy. Max puts it into the red cabinet and goes out to\nplay in the yard. The child participant is asked, \u201cWhen Max\nreturns and wants to get his candy, where will he look for\nit?\u201d The child might answer correctly because he\nor she understands that Max will think that the candy is where\nhe left it or last saw it (i.e., the red cabinet). This involves\nattributing mental states to Max. But the child might also answer\ncorrectly because that\u2019s where the candy actually is. That\nis, the child with no theory of mind might still answer correctly\nsimply by reasoning that people go to get things where they\nare. The way to resolve this uncertainty, Dennett proposed,\nwas the false belief task. In this task, which quickly\nbecame the litmus test of a theory of mind, the story includes a second\ncharacter who enters the scene while Max is still outside in the\nyard. This second character finds the candy in the red cabinet\nand puts it into the yellow cabinet. Once again, the child\nparticipant\u2014who has seen the transfer\u2014is asked where Max will look for his candy when he returns\nto the kitchen. Only if the child is successful now, responding\nthat Max will look in the red cabinet\u2014even though the\nchild knows that the candy is really in the yellow cabinet\u2014can we\nlegitimately attribute to the child a theory of mind. There is\nnow a very large literature involving the false belief task and the\nbottom line appears to be that most young 3-year-olds incorrectly\npredict that Max will look in the yellow cabinet (or, in some studies,\nsay that Max thinks it\u2019s in the yellow cabinet)\nbecause that\u2019s where it is, while somewhere between the\nages of 3.5 and 4, children begin to succeed on the\n task.[24]\n\n\nFor two decades, success on the false belief task was considered the\nonly really hard evidence for a claim that one had a theory of mind.\nWhatever social competence children showed before passing the\nfalse belief test was widely considered a precursor to having\na theory of mind. More recently, however, cognitive\ndevelopmentalists have argued that success on the false belief task is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for the attribution of a theory of\nmind, and that focusing nearly exclusively on it has led to an overly\nnarrow view of the conceptual domain (Bloom & German\n2000). The last several years have seen a plethora of studies\ninvestigating the attribution of mental states, and social cognition\nmore broadly, in infants. The next section focuses on a group of\nkey concepts involved in understanding minds including\ngoals, agency, and rationality.\n2.4.2 Goals\n\n\nWoodward\u2019s 1998 study on goal understanding in 6-month-olds is\na good example of the pattern of recent work in this area.\nInfants watched a hand move across a stage and repeatedly grasp one of\nthe two objects on opposite sides of the stage. The hand always\nmoved along the same path to the same side of the stage and then always\ngrasped the same object. After the infants habituated to this\ndisplay, Woodward switched the location of the two objects. Now\none of two events occurred: either the hand took a different\npath to grasp the same object it had always grasped (that object now being on the other side of the stage) or it took the\nsame path as before, but now grasped the other\nobject. Looking time showed that infants were more surprised when\nthe hand followed the same path and grasped the other object than when\nit followed a new path and grasped the originally grasped object.\nThis would make sense if the infants understood in some sense that the\npreviously grasped object was the hand\u2019s preferred\ngoal. To see if this was really the basis of the\nbabies\u2019 looking responses, control conditions were included to\nrule out a variety of other possibilities.\n\n\nIn a control condition, the hand was replaced with a rod that had a\nmulti-fingered sponge at the end. When the rod/sponge followed\nits old path and touched the new object, babies did not dishabituate;\nthey dishabituated only when the rod/sponge followed a new path to the\nold object. The suggestion is that the babies did not see the\naction of the rod/sponge (whose shape was similar to the shape of the\nhand) as a goal-directed action. What is it about the\npresence of the human arm that signals a goal? Would any movement\ninvolving repeated contact between a human hand and one of the toys\ntrigger goal attribution? Woodward (1999) shows that this is not the\ncase. In this study, a human arm was used again, but this time\nthe arm merely dropped onto the display, and contact was between the\nback of the hand and the toy. In this case, there was contact,\nbut not grasping. In this condition, adults would be less likely\nto interpret the action as purposeful, and the same was true of the\nbabies. When the hand/arm followed its earlier path (touching the\nnew object), babies did not dishabituate; they did however dishabituate\nwhen it followed the new path, even though it made contact with the\nsame object as before. This suggests that 5-month old babies,\nlike adults, attribute goal-directedness (again: \u2018in some\nsense\u2019) to human arms and hands that reach and grasp,\nbut not to arms that only drop and make passive contact with the\nobject.\n\n\nWhat clues do babies use to determine if a perceived motion is\ngoal-directed? The previous study suggests that they are finely tuned to complex patterns of self-directed bodily activity.  One might hypothesize that babies first\nrestrict their attributions of goals to humans only and then, with\nexperience, extend the range to include non-humans as well (Woodward\n2005; Meltzoff 2005). But a recent study, however, suggests that this\nmay not be so. In this study (Luo & Baillargeon 2005),\nbabies reliably attributed goals to a moving box, which they were\npreviously shown could move on its own. The key difference\nbetween the rod/sponge in Woodward\u2019s study and the moving box in\nthis study appears to be information about autonomous\nmotion. The rod/sponge never showed such capacity; the\nmoving box did. Autonomous motion, the authors argue, signals an\nobject\u2019s status as an agent, and agents, for the baby,\nhave goals. These results have recently been extended to\n3-month-olds (Luo 2011).\n\n\nA very recent study has shown that infants are sensitive not only to\nclues indicating an agent\u2019s capacity for autonomous motion, but\nto the perceptual information available to the agent as well and to the agent\u2019s preferences.\nRemarkably, this is true even when this information differs from\ntheir own. In Luo and Johnson (2009), 6-month-old babies saw another person look at 2 different objects and repeatedly reach for the same one. As indicated by their looking times, babies in this condition attributed to the other person a preference for the chosen object.  In contrast, in a condition where the baby saw 2\nobjects, but also saw that the other person could see only one, no preference was attributed. In this case, it seems, the baby\nappreciates that the other person cannot see the second object and that\ntherefore the repeated grasping of the first object does not indicate a\npreference. This suggests that babies at this age can already\nattribute different perceptual information to different perceivers\n(what I see vs. what she sees). Nativists expect to find\nsimilar sorts of perceptual preparedness for other systems of knowledge\nand action (for instance, a system of face recognition as preparedness\nfor social and family life).\n\n\nThe cognitive resources we bring to bear on the problem of\nresponding to and carrying out goal-directed behavior is complicated;\nthese studies provide evidence that some of these resources are in\nplace very early in life. They do not show that the\ninfant\u2019s goal-directedness abilities are innate; they might\nsomehow be learned on the basis of early experience. But again,\nsuch findings shift the burden. The earlier that resources\ninvolving notions like intention, goal,\npreference, and so on appear, the greater the challenge to\nEmpiricist claims that the categories are learned solely on the basis\nof prior experience.\n2.4.3 Agency, cooperation, and the beginnings of moral cognition\n\n\nAnother set of studies (Kuhlmeier et al. 2003; Hamlin et al. 2007)\nprovide evidence that infants are not only sensitive to displays of\nagency, but also have a sense of (something like)\ncooperative behavior: they readily distinguish between\nhelpers and hinderers. In the 2007 study,\nbabies were shown animated displays that adults interpret as a red\ncircle trying to climb a hill but having trouble making it all the way\nup \n(Hamlin et al. 2007 video display on line).\nIn half the trials, the babies see a yellow triangle gently\n\u2018helping\u2019 the circle up the hill; in the other half, they\nsee a blue square gently pushing the triangle down to the bottom.\nAdults plainly see the yellow triangle as a helper, an agent\nwhose goal is to assist the circle in getting up the hill; they see the\nblue square as a hinderer, an agent whose goal is to stop the\ntriangle from getting up the hill. Babies make such a distinction\nas well. Six-months-olds showed surprise in test trials that came\nafter the hindering and helping scenarios, in which the red circle is\nseen approaching its hinderer rather than its helper.\nFurthermore, in a live action version of the task, the 3-month-old babies\nthemselves chose to touch the helper more than the hinderer when they\nwere given both to\n choose.[25]\n\n\nFollow-up studies suggest that infants\u2019 understanding of social\ninteractions goes deeper still.  Hamlin 2015 reviews a\nseries of findings that show that their preference for helpers is\nsurprisingly nuanced.  First, they are not simple helper-lovers.  By\nthe time they are 5-months-old, they prefer those who hinder\nhinderers to those who help them.  (As Hamlin 2015 points\nout, there is very little, if anything, in the babies\u2019\nexperience that supports such a pro-hindering attitude.)  Second,\ntheir preferences are not just personal; they rise to the second\norder.  They prefer other actors who help helpers and hinder\nhinderers to those who do the opposite.  Third, by the time they are\n10-months-old, they are able to factor in information about actor\n\\(A\\)\u2019s preferences, and about actor \\(B\\)\u2019s knowledge of\n\\(A\\)\u2019s preferences, in determining whether \\(B\\)\u2019s\naction should be classified as a case of helping or hindering (or as\nneutral).  So, for example, if the baby sees \\(A\\) express a\npreference for toy\\(_1\\) over toy\\(_2\\) (by repeatedly choosing toy\\(_1\\) when given\nthe option), and the baby also sees that \\(B\\)\nsees \\(A\\)\u2019s pattern of choosing, then the baby will\ncount \\(B\\)\u2019s giving toy\\(_1\\) as a helping behavior, but not\ntoy\\(_2\\).  Fourth, and perhaps most surprising, by 8-months, babies do not\njudge actors on the basis of outcomes, but\nrather intentions.  An unsuccessful helper is preferred over\na hinderer and (neutral bystanders) at the same rate as a\nsuccessful helper; the same holds for unsuccessful\nhinderers, mutatis mutandis.\n\n\n\nIt would seem, then, that sometime between 3 and 9 months, babies are\narguably already on their way to a concept of desert.  Much\nremains to be discovered about the contours of their concept and its\nsubsequent development.  As Hamlin points out, apart from the\nhelper-hinderer contrast, we don\u2019t know how they determine who\ndeserves what.  Relevant here is the finding that babies prefer not\nonly helpers, but also those who are relevantly similar, who like the\nsame toy or candy, for example (Mahajan and Wynn 2012).  How much of\ntheir apportionment of desert is dependent on such factors as opposed\nto factors that adults might consider morally relevant, like fairness,\nresponding to need, and so on. How, if at all, does their early\nconcept connect to egalitarian notion of fairness?  \n\n\nIf we consider morality as a system that evolved to enhance cooperation within large groups of unrelated individuals (Bloom 2013, Joyce 2006), we see that infants have some of the key prerequisites in place for such a system:  (1) they have a positive attitude towards cooperation, (2) they have some grasp of other actors\u2019 preferences and their informational point of view, (3) they are sensitive to actors\u2019 intentions as embodied in their actions, and (4) they are ready to enforce rules by punishing violators and rewarding adherers, and they approve others who do likewise.  \n\n\nWe are moving towards a better understanding of the early cognitive and motivational underpinnings of moral norms, understood as social rules or expectations that all are expected to obey and enforce.  As we noted, there is still much to learn here about both the early state and what is likely to be a very complicated developmental story about maturation and the influence of the child\u2019s social environment. (Bloom and Wynn 2016 provides a useful and philosophically informed summary of the sate of research on which features of our moral cognition are, or are not, part of an early core.)  But there is mounting evidence that from early in their first year infants are social cognizers with (at least) a hold on the moral realm.  It is hard to see any way that all of this can be learned from experience (Hamlin 2015).\n2.4.4 Rationality\n\n\nOur understanding of goal-directed behavior is characterized by a\nprinciple of rationality; that is, that all things being equal, agents\ntake the easiest, most direct, and most efficient means available to\nachieve their goal. In a series of studies, Csibra, Gergely and\ntheir colleagues provide evidence that infants use this principle\n(Csibra et al. 1999 and 2003). In Csibra et al. 2003,\n12-month-old babies were habituated to a ball rolling along a path,\napparently jumping while its path is hidden by a screen, and then\ncontinuing rolling along its path once it has emerged from behind the\nscreen. In the test trials, the screen was removed and babies\nwere shown one of two displays: one with an obstacle on the path, one\nwith no obstacle. Longer looking times at the display with no\nobstacle indicate that jumping for no apparent reason is unexpected for\nthe infant. In contrast, when there is an obstacle on the path,\njumping over it is a direct and efficient means to achieving\none\u2019s goal and is therefore not a violation of expectation.\n\n\nAnother study by Gergely and his colleagues (2002) followed up on a\nfinding of Meltzoff (1988) showing that 14-month-olds imitate the means\nan agent employs to attain a goal, even if those means are not the most\ndirect or efficient. Meltzoff showed infants that tapping a panel\nlight with his head made it light up. When babies returned to the\nlab the following week, they too used their heads to turn on the light,\nrather than simply pressing it with their hands. Gergely\nsuggested that this seeming violation of rationality was not in fact\nirrational. He suggested that the baby might reason that\nif the light could be turned on with one\u2019s hand, the\nadult they were imitating would have used his hand. The fact that\nthe adult used his head to turn on the light suggests to the child that\nthis must be a necessary means to achieve the goal. To test this\nhypothesis, the researchers added a condition in which the adult actor\ncould not use his hands because they were otherwise engaged: the actor\npretended to be very cold and used his hands to hold a blanket wrapped\naround him. With hands thus busy, the adult actor used his head\nto tap the panel light. They then compared the babies\u2019\nresponses to the panel light in this hands-busy condition with the\nresponses in the original Meltzoff condition where the actor\u2019s\nhands were simply resting on the table. In the original Meltzoff\ncondition, babies used their heads to turn on the light, but in the\nactor\u2019s-hands-busy condition, the babies did not imitate the\nactor but instead used their hands. This supports the view that\nthese babies already are acting on the basis of some principle\nconnecting efficiency and goal-directedness, and that this principle is\nstronger than their tendency to imitate.\n2.4.5 Belief and theory of mind\n\n\nLet us return to the False Belief Task. It was noted earlier\nthat children younger than 3-1/2 do not succeed in the classic\nparadigm. But in a recent study, Onishi and Baillargeon (2005)\nshowed that infants as young as 13- to 15-months could succeed on a\nfalse belief task. In this study, babies were familiarized to a\ndisplay of an adult placing a toy (a plastic watermelon slice) into one\nof two boxes and then reaching into the box as if to grasp it.\nThe point of these familiarization trials was to indicate to the baby\nthat reaching the toy was the adult\u2019s goal. The toy was\nthen moved from the box in which the adult had placed it to the other\nbox. Although the baby always saw the toy move, and thus\nunderstood its new location, the adult did not always see the toy move;\nhalf the time, the adult\u2019s view was blocked. The question is this: on the\ntrials where the adult did not see the toy move to the new\nbox\u2014that is, when the adult had a false belief about the\ntoy\u2019s location\u2014where do babies expect the adult to look for\nthe toy? Looking time measures indicated that babies were\nsurprised when the adult looked in the new box, even though babies knew\nit was the correct location. In contrast, on the trials in which\nadults saw the toy move to the new box, babies were surprised if adults\ndid not look in the new location. At present there is no\nsatisfactory account of why 3-year-olds fail the standard false belief\ntask, given that 15-month-old babies seem to be able to attribute false beliefs to\nothers. What else does the 3-year-old need, beyond what the\n15-month-old already has, to succeed on the classic task? There\nare many candidate answers, but the Onishi and Baillargeon results have\nconsiderably changed the debate.\n2.4.6 Animals and theory of mind\n\n\nAs noted above, questions about the development of a theory of mind\nwere first posed with respect to chimpanzees, and it is to chimpanzees\n(and other nonhuman primates) that we now return. Until recently,\nmost researchers agreed that there was little evidence to support the\nclaim that nonhuman primates represented agency, goals, attention or\nthe like (Povinelli 2000; Tomasello & Call 1997).\nHowever, chimpanzees, macaques, and other primates do follow eye\ngaze. Researchers have probed whether they appreciate the\nrelationship between the direction of gaze and attention, or\nbetween seeing something and acquiring\ninformation. A number of recent studies have shown that\nchimps prefer to steal food from a person (or, in some conditions, a\nmore dominant chimp) who cannot see them as opposed to a person (or\nmore dominant chimp) who can (see Flombaum & Santos 2005; Hare\net al. 2000; and Carey 2009 for review). If dedicated\nmechanisms to identify agents and to support our reasoning about them\nis part of our evolutionary heritage, as seems increasingly plausible,\nit should not surprise us to find them in some of our distant\nrelatives\u2014and in the very young.\n\n\nOnce again, the studies of newborn chicks are particularly\nilluminating. Regolin and colleagues (2000) habituated newborn\nchicks to a video display involving 2 balls, one red and one\nblue. At first the balls are presented as static. The red\nball then moves, bumps into the blue ball, and then the blue ball\nmoves. After habituation the chicks were presented with a fuzzy\noval-shaped red ball and a fuzzy oval-shaped blue ball. The\nchicks imprinted to the red ball, not the blue one. It seems that\nthey are sensitive to agency\u2014that they see the red ball\nas an agent, while the blue ball may be a passive object. To make\nsure it was the red ball\u2019s autonomous movement that was critical,\nexperimenters partly occluded the red ball as it began its movement so\nthat it wasn\u2019t clear whether the movement was autonomous or set\nin motion by someone or something else. In this condition, the\nimprinting preference for the red ball disappeared. These chicks\nwere newly hatched, so an explanation for these data that appeals to\nlearning from sensory experience is unavailable. Once again, the\nchick studies provide an existence proof of an innately specified\ndetection mechanism closely related to agency. Note that the\nquestion of what precisely the chick is detecting or representing is\nstill open\u2014is it autonomous motion or agency or some other\nproperty.\n3. The Resurgence of Empiricism\n\n\nThe studies summarized in section 2 are representative of the\nNativist resurgence. Not surprisingly, cognitive scientists with\nEmpiricist sympathies continue to push back: to search for\ncountervailing evidence, to question the methodologies involved in\nthese studies, to develop alternative interpretations of the data, and\nso on. Moreover, as we mentioned at the outset, it is not only\nNativism that has experienced a resurgence; there are important\nresearch directions in the cognitive sciences that seem inherently more\nfriendly to the Empiricist position. In this section we briefly\ndescribe and contextualize some of these developments.\n3.1 Connectionism and Dynamic Systems Theory\n\n\nOne important trend has been the development of Connectionism as an\nalternative to the \u2018Classical\u2019 conception of the mind\n(Newell & Simon 1976; see Garson 2010 for an overview).\nOn the Classical view, the cognitive mind is best understood on\nthe model of a digital computer that (i) uses symbolic representations\nthat have a combinatorial syntax and semantics, and (ii) manipulates\nthese representations following structure-sensitive processing rules.\nConnectionists replace the Classical view with a model of\npsychological processes as involving networks of simple units with\nweighted connections among the units that control the spread of\nactivation through the network, and \u2018learning\u2019 algorithms\nfor resetting the weights of the connections on the basis of earlier\nbehavior of the network in response to some task. There is\ncontinuing debate about whether the Classical and Connectionist models\nare really incompatible, and some have argued that Connectionist\nsystems are best viewed as implementations of classical symbol-based\nsystems (see Pinker & Prince 1988 for discussion). But\nthe research on psychological processing within the Connectionist\nframework is very different from what one finds in the Classical\ntradition.\n\n\nConnectionism is relevant to the Nativism-Empiricism in two related\nways. In the first place, Connectionism provides a natural format\nfor the Empiricist idea that perception provides the basic elements of\nthe mental system (ideas/network-nodes) and experienced regularities\namong ideas strengthens their connection (associations/weightings) and\nin this way accounts for learning. But a more important idea is\nthat if Connectionism could be established as a real\nalternative to the Classical symbol manipulation approach (and\nnot simply as providing implementations of Classical systems), it could\nhelp undercut a key argument of Chomsky-style Nativism. Here is a\nsimplified version of the target\n argument.[26]\nChomskyans, as we noted (section 1.1.2),\nargued that grammars\u2014and by extension, the rules governing other\ndomains of knowledge\u2014are \u2018psychologically\nreal\u2019. If they are, and the Classical view is correct, then\nit would seem that such rules are present in the mind as symbolic\nconstructions. But these rules, as linguistic grammars make\nplain, involve abstract concepts that are not perceptually available in\nthe data. So if the rules are symbolically represented, then\nthese abstract concepts, which are the constituent elements of the\nrules, are also internally represented. But if the relevant\nconcepts are not perceptually available, how could they be learned by\nEmpiricist-style mechanisms that only track regularities in the stream\nof experience? This sort of Nativist argument was developed in\nFodor 1981. Connectionism rejects the view of mental\nrepresentation on which this argument depends. For the\nConnectionist, information is not in the mind as the semantics of\nmental symbols; as the meanings of terms in the language of\nthought. For the Connectionist, information is distributed as a\npattern of weightings in a network in which none of the nodes\nrepresents anything. So: if this sort of anti-Classical\nConnectionist approach is successful, this particular version of the\nPoverty of the Stimulus argument for Nativism is blocked. \n\n\nThere is continuing controversy about whether Connectionism has\nin-principle limitations that disqualify it as a general model of\ncognitive processing (see Fodor & Pylyshyn 1988 and the\nliterature this critique spawned, which is reviewed in Garson\n2010). But there is a practical problem that is less\ncontroversial, and to understand it, we need to consider more closely\nhow Connectionist nets learn. Imagine that one wants the net to\nlearn the difference between (photos of) male and female faces. A\nset of input nodes will code the photo, activation will pass through a\nset of intermediate nodes, and an answer will appear on the output\nnodes. If the output on a particular input is incorrect (a male\nis misidentified as a female for example), the algorithm that governs\nthe dynamics of the network automatically adjusts the weights of the\nconnections between the various intermediate-layer nodes \u2018in the right\ndirection\u2019 and more inputs are cycled through the system.\nWhen the output is correct over some range of inputs, the net has been\n\u2018trained up\u2019; it has successfully learned to tell male from\nfemale faces in photos. The art in Connectionist modeling is to\ndiscover the best network structure and the right algorithm for\nadjusting the weightings. The problem is that such networks learn\nvery slowly; they often need hundreds of thousands of cycles of inputs,\noutputs, and weight adjustments. But humans and animals learn\nmany things very quickly, sometimes even from one instance and often\nfrom a small set of instances (Garcia et al. 1955; Markman 1989).\n\n\nOne way to approach this discrepancy is to see it as due to the fact\nthat in the typical Connectionist set up, the weights between nodes are\ninitially set to random values, and are (very) slowly reset on the\nbasis of small adjustments. But the fact that the initial\nweightings provide no prior information is arguably an artifact of the\nmodeler\u2019s Empiricist commitment to have all the learning\n\u2018come from experience\u2019. There is nothing in the\ngeneral structure of Connectionist models that would prevent the\nmodeler from starting with a highly constrained set of\nweightings\u2014in this case one that already holistically contains\ninformation of the general features of human faces, and perhaps\ninformation about differences between male and female faces. The\nupshot, then, is that although most actual Connectionist models are\nEmpiricist-friendly in their format and in their representational\ncommitments, they can also be implemented in a way that is congenial to\nNativist ideas. The prior information that the Nativist claims is\npart of the initial state of the organism can be realized by setting\nthe initial patterns of weightings between the nodes in the network in\nsuch a way that learning will happen much more quickly. So while\nConnectionism may avoid the very general commitment to Nativism that\nsome have argued is built into the Classical conception, it is neutral\non the question of whether learning in a particular domain is wholly\nbased on experience or uses innate information (suitably distributed\nacross networks).\n\n\nThis last point applies to Dynamic Systems Theory approaches to\ncognition as well (Thelen & Smith 1994; Port & van\nGelder 1995). Dynamicists hold that human behavior should be\nexplained in terms of sets of differential equations that represent a\nsubject\u2019s trajectory in real time through a space of possible\ntotal cognitive-behavioral states. Because they, like\nanti-Classical Connectionists, reject the Classical paradigm\u2019s\ncommitment to symbol manipulation and computation, they also avoid the\nNativist consequences of that view. But neither Connectionists\nnor Dynamicists are in principle anti-Nativist. However\nwe model an organisms cognitive processes\u2014as executing a\nClassical Von Neumann style program, as reassigning weights to nodes in\nline with a Connectionist back-propagation algorithm, or as moving\nthrough a Dynamicist state space as described by a set of differential\nequations\u2014the question remains: what are the built in initial\nbiases of the system and what role do they play in determining the\nsteady state. One can construct a Connectionist system that is\nantecedently tuned to converge on a specific steady-state, and as such\nwill have a significant Nativist element (Hummel & Biederman\n1992 presents such a system for shape recognition). The same\nseems true of Dynamic Systems models. The oft-used Dynamicist\nexample of a pendulum is \u2018innately specified\u2019 to reach a\nspecific steady state (its point attractor) despite wide\nvariability in its inputs. If very young children do indeed\ndistinguish helpers from hinderers, for example, then this capacity\nwill need to figure in the Dynamicist model. It will be\nappropriate to then ask about the role that the child\u2019s initial\nstructure or configuration played in its coming to have this\ncapacity.\n3.2 Bayesian approaches\n\n\nEven at the height of Chomsky\u2019s influence, it was clear that\nthe strength of the Nativist position rested, to a great extent, on the\nweakness of the Empiricist alternative. The central argument from\nthe Poverty of the Stimulus was that Empiricism had failed to make\nits case, and that the Nativist hypothesis was therefore more\nplausible. But it was implicit in this dialectic that if\na more powerful Empiricist learning theory were developed, it could\nchange the terms of the debate. Furthermore, Empiricists argued\nthat there had to be a stronger general learning theory\nbecause learning theory as developed up until that time did not have\nthe resources to account for much learning that was plainly\nbased on experience (Harman 1967; Putnam 1967). Some would argue that these Empiricist\nhopes for a more powerful learning theory have been realized. Learning theory has advanced\nsignificantly, especially in the last decade, and Empiricism can now\ndraw upon new resources; specifically, learning algorithms based on\nBayes\u2019 Theorem. The power of Bayesianism raises the\npossibility that the earlier Poverty of the Stimulus arguments\nunderestimated what could be learned from experience by general\nlearning mechanisms.\n\n\n\u2018Bayesianism\u2019 is a general term for a range of\nsophisticated statistical methods, algorithms, and tools that draw upon Bayes\u2019\nTheorem/Rule, which tells us how to revise our beliefs given new\ninformation; that is, how to choose the best of a set of alternative\nhypotheses given new data. The calculation requires (i) the prior\nprobability of the data, (ii) the probability of the data given the\nhypothesis, and (iii) the prior probability of the\n hypothesis.[27]\n\nThe relevance of Bayes\u2019 Theorem to Cognitive\nScience. Bayesianism is in its origins a normative theory of\nwhat one ought to believe under specific epistemic\ncircumstances, and as such it has been applied extensively in\nunderstanding theory confirmation in the sciences. It first came\nto the fore in the cognitive sciences as an ideal against which one\ncould measure human irrationality. Kahneman and Tversky\n(1972) famously showed that ordinary reasoners typically fall short of\nBayesian standards when they are asked to decide the bearing of\nevidence on hypotheses, in part because they misjudge the relevance of\nthe prior probability of the hypotheses. But in recent years, Bayesian methodologies have become a unifying framework for analyzing all aspects of cognition that can be represented as inference under uncertainty.  For example, \nBayesian ideas have been successfully applied to the processing\nunderlying perception\u2014especially the visual system (Knill\n& Richards 1996; Rao et al. 2002). In visual perception,\na pattern of light hits the eye (the proximal stimulus), and the visual\nsystem needs to determine the nature of the visual scene in the\nenvironment (the distal stimulus) that caused that pattern. The\nproximal stimulus is compatible with a number of different distal\nstimuli. So the system faces something like the\nunder-determination problem that a scientist faces. Both must\nselect one view about what the world is like on the basis of\ninformation that still leaves other possibilities open. It turns\nout that Bayesian methods have been very successful at modeling how the\nvisual system resolves these uncertainties.\n\n\nThe visual system gets an image on the retina (D), and must\ndetermine what the real-world scene is like (H). The\nimage is compatible with many different possible scenes, but the visual\nsystem is very good at overcoming this uncertainty and reliably settles\non the most likely scene. In Bayesian terms, the visual system\nmust do this calculation:\n\n\\[ \n\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Scene}\\mid\\text{Image}) =\n\\frac{\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Image}\\mid\\text{Scene})\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Scene})}{\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Image})}\n\\]\n\n\n\nConsider this (again simplified) example, drawn from Scholl\n2005. In Figure 1, the circles are ambiguous; they can be either\nconvex bumps or concave depressions. Viewers normally see (a) as\nconvex and (b) as concave, (but if the display is turned upside down, the\nproperties are reversed).\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe fact that we see these as we do can be explained in Bayesian\nterms. To figure out the most likely scene/source of (a), the visual\nsystem must assign a probability to the hypotheses \\(H_2\\) (that the circle\nin a is convex) and to \\(H_2\\) (that it is concave). One key assumption\nthe visual system makes is that the scene in both (a) and (b) is\nilluminated by a single light source coming from overhead. So if\nthe bottom of the circle is in shadow, we tend to see it as convex; if\nthe top, we tend to see it as concave. When we look at\n(a), this assumption about the light source translates into the\nprior probability of \\(H_1\\) being higher than the prior probability of\n\\(H_2\\). So the priors in this case give us an antecedent ordering of\nthe hypothesis space (here we ignore other hypotheses that could\naccount for the image), and the visual system settles on (a) as\nconvex.\n\n\nBayesian approaches are appealing because they provide a natural way\nto solve the problem that troubles theories, like Connectionism, that\nare built on associationist lines. Associationist learning is\nbottom-up. It depends on keeping track of correlations in the\nstream of experience and slowly modulating expectations on the basis of\nthese correlations. But as we noted earlier, humans and animals\nlearn about the world very quickly, and on the basis of a very small\nnumber of exposures and interventions. A child hears the word\n\u2018horse\u2019 applied to a few instances (and probably\nhears stray utterances of the word too) and reliably learns the\nextension of the term (Markman 1989). A rat made sick by a food\none time, will not eat food with that smell again (Garcia et\nal 1955). These \u2018fast-mappings\u2019 are a problem\nfor Associationist models. But they are more easily accommodated\nin Bayesian models, which essentially quantify the role of background\nknowledge\u2014the top-down contribution\u2014in the fixation of\nbelief. If the rat already knows, as part of its background\nknowledge\u2014its \u2018factory settings\u2019, so to\nspeak\u2014that when it comes to foods, smell is an indicator of\nedibility, then single-case learning is less mysterious. The\nprior probability of hypotheses linking edibility to smell may be\nantecedently set as very high, and hypotheses linking edibility to\norientation may be set as very low. So one association between\nsick-making food \\(f\\) and smell \\(s\\) will be enough for the rat to\n\u2018adopt the hypothesis\u2019 that \\(f\\) and \\(s\\) are regularly\nlinked. In contrast, if sick-making food \\(f\\) is always in a\nparticular orientation \\(o\\), the rat may have a hard time making the\nconnection even if it may be sensitive to orientations in other\ncontexts. Similarly, if the child comes to the word-learning task\nwith the assumption that new words most likely pick out unfamiliar\nextensions\u2014again, with this assumption implemented in the\npriors\u2014then her job is made easier. Bayes\u2019 Theorem\ngives us a way to factor in this top-down background\n knowledge.[28]\n\n\nThe key issue in considering the bearing of Bayesianism on the\nNativist-Empiricist controversy is the\n priors.[29]\nWhere do they come from? If we are talking about simple, repeatable events like coin flips, the priors are a\nmatter of well-defined relative frequencies given by probability\ntheory. But the prior in the concave-convex case (which was\nchosen to highlight this point) seems to involve domain-specific facts\nabout light and shadow, and their relation to the shape of objects.\nScholl 2005 argues that the priors here are innate, and many\nscientists studying visual perception would agree. We don\u2019t\nlearn from experience that the objects in our perceptual world\nwill typically have overhead illumination. Rather, this is one of\nthe \u2018factory settings\u2019 of the visual system. As\nKersten (2004) puts it (speaking more generally): \u2018the priors are\nin the genes\u2019. Ullman (1979) argues that the same may well\nhold for the general constraints relating the rigidity of objects to\nfacts about motion. The view that the illumination constraint is\ninnate is also supported by the fact that chickens reared in an\nabnormal illuminated-from-below environment still react as we do to\nstimuli (a) and (b) (Hershberger 1970). So we have evidence that this\nprior can be innate.\n\n\nLet us assume that there are significant innate priors that operate\nin perceptual processing. Does this score points for the Nativist\nposition in general? In one way it does, because it is in line\nwith the basic Nativist theme that humans are tailored for their\nnatural environment. But in another sense, the Empiricist might\ndownplay the importance of this kind of Perceptual Nativism for the\nlarger debate. Empiricists have always taken it for granted that\nwe perceive as we do, in large part, because of our\nbiological-psychological nature. The traditional Empiricist focus\nhas usually been on that part of our understanding that goes beyond\nwhat we actually perceive. Its main claim is that anything that\ngoes beyond what we perceive is constructed out of what\nwe\u2019ve perceived by domain-general\nprinciples. So even if (some of) the priors involved in Bayesian\nmodels of perceptual processing are innate, the more critical arena for\nthe Nativist is domain-specific cognitive processing,\nto which we now turn. Nativists would expect that the best\nBayesian models of cognitive processing would have to incorporate\ninnate priors that reflect domain-specific knowledge.\nEmpiricists would expect that domain-specific priors are themselves\nlearnable by Bayesian methods from experience plus domain-general\nconstraints on learning.\n\n\nWe do not yet know enough to settle these questions, but they are\nnow beginning to be addressed. Most recently, a number of\ntheorists have used Bayesian techniques to model not just low-level\nperceptual processing but also aspects of higher-order cognitive\nprocesses. Areas of current research include concept learning\n(Tenenbaum 1999), word learning (Xu 2007), and causal reasoning\n(Griffiths & Tenenbaum 2005; Griffiths et al. 2011), and the\nlist is\n growing.[30]\nContemporary research on the application of Bayesian techniques\nto higher-level cognition has generally ignored the battle lines of the\nNativist-Empiricist debate. The real interest is in the\npossibility of developing statistical techniques that, as Tenenbaum et al 2006 puts it, \u201cintegrate bottom-up and top-down\ninfluences.\u201d (For a very useful state of the art in Statistical learning along with concrete suggestions about deploying top-down information in such models, see Lake et al, forthcoming.)  We already have sophisticated statistical\nanalyses of the bottom-up part; the perceptual phenomena. The\nchallenge is to develop quantitative representations and analyses of\nthe levels of top-down background knowledge that operate in particular\ndomains. In section 2, for instance, we considered as part of the\nchild\u2019s background information his theory of mind.\nIt was on the basis of this theory that the child could develop a\nstructural analysis of a situation in terms of agents, beliefs, goals,\nhelp/hindrance, and so on. But the information contained in such\na theory and the structural analyses of particular situations that this\ntheory makes available, cannot yet be integrated into Bayesian\nstatistical analyses. The challenge for Bayesians is to develop\nways to recast the top-down elements and the analyses they make\navailable in quantitative terms. Only then will we be in a position to address\nwhether and to what extent top-down information is learned or\ninnate.\n\n\nWe can use the case of language understanding, a well-studied area\nand arguably a Nativist stronghold, to illustrate how these Bayesian\ngoals might be achieved. The phenomenon is familiar: you hear a\nsentence \\(S_1\\) as having a specific meaning. The theoretical\napproach mirrors the vision case: \\(S_1\\) (as auditorily processed) is\ncompatible with a number of competing structural representations, but your parser\nsomehow chooses the best one: \\(\\mathrm{sr}(S_1)'\\). The Bayesian says\nthat the parser is able to do this because it can do a statistical analysis\nthat integrates bottom-up and top-down information. In this case,\nthe bottom-up element is \\(S_1\\). But the range of possible\nstructured representations the parser can select from is top-down\ninformation, as is the algorithm that chooses \\(\\mathrm{sr}(S_1)'\\)\nover other candidates. The problem: how to assign a prior\nprobability to a complex structured representation like \\(\\mathrm{sr}(S_1)'\\)\n(for instance, a syntactic tree)\u2014a probability that depends on the probability\nassigned to the sub-elements. We know how to assign the prior\nprobability of a series of heads for a fair coin. But the question comes up again: how do we\nassign a prior probability to a linguistic representation, or to a\ncomplex visual scene, or to a complicated representation of the goals,\nroles, and perceptual beliefs of a player in one of the Theory of Mind\nscenarios? The events are more complex, the\nrepresentations of the events are therefore more complex, and the\nhypothesis space is more complex (Chater et al. 2006).\n\n\nIn the language case, the Bayesian can hope to draw on a good deal\nof what contemporary linguists have already achieved in understanding\nthe structures underlying sentence comprehension, and some\ncomputational linguists are beginning to merge such analyses with\nprobability theory (for instance, Chater & Manning 2006).\nBut even here, the problem of finding the best structure to assign to\nan input is daunting. As Chater et al. 2006 puts it:\n\n\u201cMore challenging is inferring representational structures over\nwhich parameters are optimized. One problem is that the space of\npossible structures is often large and discontinuous; a second is that\na direct application of probabilistic methods would involve assessing\neach structure by integrating a prior over its parameters, which seems\ncomputationally prohibitive; a third is that structures appear to be\nconstrained in potentially highly abstract ways.\u201d \n\n\nIn the case of theory of mind, on the other hand, we don\u2019t yet have\ndeveloped theories about the relevant structures (but see the related\nwork on causality collected in Gopnik & Schulz 2007). So it is\nonly if Bayesians can get a handle on these representational and\nstatistical problems, that they will be able to attack our\nquestion: how is the space of such structures generated in the first\nplace? Is there innate domain-specific information at work or is there\na Bayesian hierarchy, a two-level-up Bayesian account that explains\nhow this one-level-up information is acquired (that is, a Bayesian\nlearning-theoretic account that explains why the child represents\nlinguistic input, for example, using tree structures, but integers in\nterms of a very different linear structure; for further discussion see\nTenenbaum et al. 2011).\n\n\nSo, for example, children might know that animals are arranged in a\ntaxonomy of a specific sort, and this prior background knowledge helps\nthem learn about animals. But how do they get this prior? It might be\nthat they have a prior higher-order principle \\(P\\) that provides a\nprobabilistic ordering on different graph structures, and that the\ntaxonomy they use has a higher prior probability than other ways to\nstructure the animal world (say, a ring structure). But how do they\nget \\(P\\)? Do they learn it or is it simply there innately? To tackle\nthese questions, all sorts of objects\u2014structured representations\none finds in a grammar, graph-structures one might find in a taxonomic\nrepresentation of causal or kin relations, schemas applied to scene or\nevent analysis, etc.\u2014will need to be formalized and assigned\nprobabilities. So there is much to be done. There is no a priori\nanswer about how far up the Bayesian can go, and we do well to keep an\nopen mind about the nature of the unlearned priors. But we should also\nnot overlook findings like the chick\u2019s stubborn presumption of\nillumination from above, which suggest that nature can build\nin unlearned priors, and that they can be domain specific. It would\nbe, at the very least, extremely surprising if nothing like this\noperates in human psychology.\n\n\nBayesianism, then, focuses the Nativist-Empiricist question on the\npriors. First, we need to find out where the background\nknowledge brought to bear in any particular task comes from. Is\nsome part of it innate, or can its presence be accounted for in terms\nof higher-order Bayesian learning? At some point, the Bayesian\nwill come up against what is not learned by Bayesian methods (at the\nvery least, the Bayesian machinery\n itself[31]),\nand we will want to understand its specific\ncharacter. Will it be information implemented in our perceptual\nsystems or domain-general information that applies no matter what is\nbeing learned, supporting the Empiricist view, or will some of it be\ntailored to specific ranges and domains of knowledge, vindicating the\nNativist? We are still at the beginning of the road to the\nanswers to these questions.\n\n\nIt is important not to underestimate the challenge that Empiricists face.  The Bayesian formalism might make it seem that all that needs to be explained is why the hypotheses compatible with the data are ordered in the way they are.  So, for example, if it could be shown that the bias for a light from above explanation of the retinal image (in section 3.2) could, in principle, have been learned from experience, then it might appear that the Empiricist wins the round.  It is plausible that some of the priors relevant to scene recognition will be learnable in this way, so this may be right as far as it goes.  But it does not get to the heart of the challenge.\n\n\nOnce we shift our attention away from the Bayesian formalism and focus\non the fact that we are looking for an account of the\ncognitive/computational machinery that processes inputs and generates\ncomplex structural analyses of the world\u2014think here of the\nsubsystem that generates theory of mind representations of interacting\nagents in terms of goals, rationality, cooperation, desert, and so\non\u2014then it becomes clearer that the burden on the Empiricist is\nmuch greater.  She must not only explain where the representation\ntypes come from, she must also account for the cognitive\nprocessing over these representation types. So even if there were a\nsatisfactory Empiricist account of how the infant sorts inputs into\nthe categories agent, hinderer, and so on, we still need a separate\naccount of where the cognitive machinery that operates over these\ntypes comes from.  Without that, the infant will have a static\ntypology with no way to anticipate the dynamics of the situation.\nHere, then, the Empiricist seems to have two choices.  She must make\nthe case that the machinery involved is either (i) generic and\ndomain-independent, or (ii) domain-specific, but itself the product of\nhigher-order learning.\nThe point is that the Empiricist must account for the repertoire of\nrepresentation types that figure in the processing and for\nthe machinery that does the processing.  The ultimate outcome of this\ndebate will depend in part on how distinctive and complex the\ncomputational machinery turns out to be.  If the engine for theory of\nmind dynamics only needs to do tree search or production rule\napplication (for example), then the case for Empiricism is\nstrengthened, because these are very general computational capacities.\nOnly the content of the specific rules or the content at the nodes\nwill be domain-specific.  But the more idiosyncratic the computational\nmachinery in a specific subsystem\u2014for example, a simulator that\nanticipated motions and locations in a dynamic physical\nscene\u2014the greater the challenge for the Empiricist to explain\nhow such an internal computational device is acquired from experience\nalone.\n\nAs we noted, although Bayesianism has had a special appeal for Empiricists, one can use Bayesian methodologies and remain open to Nativist possibilities.  There is nothing to prevent a Bayesian from starting with an innate system of representations and computational machinery and then using Bayesian algorithms to figure out how learning from experience might work for such a system.  This approach is very much in line with the Core Nativist theorizing discussed in section 2.  (For a detailed defense of this methodology, see Lake et. al. forthcoming).\n\n\nIn summary, then, Bayesianism appeals to Empiricists for at least two\nimportant reasons. First, because it reinstates\nlearning from experience as a central process in cognitive\ndevelopment and change. This focus on learning contrasts sharply with\nthe first wave of Nativist cognitive research, which, inspired by\nChomsky\u2019s work in linguistics, tended to assign a diminished\nrole to learning from experience. Experience was thought to act as a\ntrigger/releaser of innate information, or, as in some linguistic\ntheorizing, as setting values to parameters that were left unspecified\nby our innate endowment. The lead role, again following Chomsky, was\nassigned to growth, understood simply as biological maturation. The\nsecond reason is that the current Bayesian mindset tends in\nsome ways towards Empiricism.  This is primarily because Bayesian\nlearning can, at least in principle, be extended hierarchically, in\nthe ways we\u2019ve discussed. But Bayesianism also has some appeal\nto Nativists, because it focuses attention on the role of background\nknowledge in learning, and this is a theme that Nativists have pressed\nagainst bottom-up Associationist forms of Empiricism from the\noutset. Nativists can welcome a renewed focus on learning, and join in\nthe development of Bayesian theories of cognitive development. So in\nthe end, Bayesianism\u2014as an approach to cognitive\ndevelopment\u2014is, like Connectionism, compatible with\nNativism. (For recent discussion of this last point, see Colombo 2017;\nfor a more pessimistic assessment of the potential contribution of\nBayesian approaches to psychology see Jones and Love 2011.)\nConcluding remarks: Nativism and Rationalism\n\n\nNativism, as we have seen, is a vigorous program in contemporary cognitive science.  But there is very little talk of Rationalism.   The term is sometimes repurposed as another name for Nativism, and in some cases it is explicitly disowned, with Nativism taken to be the only plank in the original Rationalist platform worth saving.  But following up on our previous discussion, there is a case to be made that this common attitude misses an important and distinctly Rationalist feature of current Core Nativist research.  Here we briefly sketch the key ideas behind this claim.\n\n\nThe Classical Nativist-Empiricist debate is an expression of a\ndisagreement about a bigger question: what is the (cognitive)\nmind and what is it for?  For the Empiricist (Hume 1975/1738\nbeing an especially clear example), the mind is first and foremost\na pattern detector, and it is for prediction.  For\nthe Humean, all we have to work with is one experience and then\nanother.  Cognitive processing is at bottom experience mining:\ndeploying our domain general cognitive machinery like statistical\nlearning routines, memory retrieval, attentional mechanisms,\nassociative connectivity, and so on, to detect patterns in the\nsequences of traces (Hume\u2019s ideas) that experience\nleaves behind in memory.\n\n\nFor the Rationalist, mind is for understanding.\nUnderstanding is of course connected to pattern detection and\nprediction, but it also involves making sense of the patterns\nat some deeper level.  The Classical Rationalist view is that Reason\n(with a capital \u2018R\u2019), in part embodied in our innate endowment,\nsomehow makes this sort of deeper understanding possible.  Descartes\u2019\nfamous wax example (Descartes 1996/1641) is aimed at making clear the\ndifference between detecting patterns in the flow of perceptual ideas\nthat are prompted by a piece of wax and having a real understanding of\nwhat a piece of wax is.  The Humean Empiricist rejects this search for\ndepth as illusory; pattern detection is all understanding is or can\nbe.\n\n\nOur point is that the Core Cognition approach retains this\ndistinctively Rationalist emphasis on understanding.  Core\nsystems like our intuitive physics and theory of mind help us\nconstruct models of the world based on innate abstract\nframeworks.  By deploying these theories we can go beyond the input\npatterns and come to understand not just how things look, but\nalso what they are, why they are as they are, why\nthey change in the ways they do, how things might be\nif relevant parameters were different, and so on.  When the baby sees\ntriangles pushing a square up a hill, she constructs a rich\nconceptualization of the scene that breaks things up into different\nkinds of elements, and assigns properties to the elements; properties\ninvolving agency, physical object, goals, private intentions,\ninformation states, rationality, number, shape, etc..  She can use\nthis conceptualization\u2014her intuitive theory\u2014to understand\nthe dynamics of what she sees and in that way make sense of\nthe situation.\n\n\nDespite this commonality, Core Nativists are not one with Classical\nRationalists.  Descartes took our innate Rational notion of the\nphysical to be at the heart of the true physics.  Newton showed that\nthis was wrong, and that we needed to go beyond our intuitive physics\nif we wanted to get a deeper understanding of the world.  Core\nKnowledge theorists reject the Classical assumption that our innate\nsense-making frameworks are necessarily true.  But true or\nnot, what is innate provides a framework that we use to make\nsense of the world.  To this extent, the Core Knowledge program\nrevitalizes this key Rationalist idea.  It remains an open question\nhow we are to understand this notion of (deep) understanding.  This\nsearch goes back at least as far as Plato.  But our point here has not\nbeen to defend the revival of this Rationalist theme; only to note the\ncommonality.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the studies that we surveyed\nin section 2 provide compelling evidence that\nwe have been underestimating how much infants and young children\nunderstand about the world. At the same time, it is clear that adult\ncompetence goes far beyond the child\u2019s in virtually every\ndomain. The Bayesian framework we discussed\nin section 3 has the potential to address both\nissues at once. It provides a systematic and quantifiable approach to\ndevelopment, and is at the same time open to incorporating innate\nelements. Whether it will succeed in unifying a learning-theoretic\napproach to cognitive development with the built-in representations\nfavored by Nativists remains to be seen.",
