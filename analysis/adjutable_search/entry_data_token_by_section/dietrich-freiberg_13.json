    "main_text": "The Separation of the Intellect\n14. The Separation of the Intellect\n\n\nThe causal relationship that the agent intellect enjoys with respect\nto the soul of man raises one last question for Dietrich: to what\nextent if any is the intellect separated in its existence from man?\nThis question of course had been debated in the schools by the\ngeneration of scholars that immediately preceded Dietrich. But it was\nstill a question that attracted attention in his own day. There were\nphilosophers then, as there probably always will be, who wanted to\nargue that the intellect was a function of the soul, having no\nexistence outside of the soul. Dietrich, however, basing his position\nsquarely upon an old Augustinian tradition, argued just the opposite.\nSeparation is a characteristic of intellect as such, and in man it is\nidentified with the \u201cinteriority\u201d which Augustine claimed\nwas not joined to the body as its form. T\u00e9treau points out that\nDietrich never attempts to prove his doctrine of separation, but\nassumes it on the basis of a passage in Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima (III, 5, 430a17\u201318) where Aristotle claims that mind\nand its act of thought cannot be subjected to temporality. This,\nhowever, is not exactly accurate. It has already been shown that\nDietrich has in mind Augustine\u2019s notion of a separate\ninteriority in man that he identifies with his agent intellect. But\nthe fact that Dietrich does not offer a proof for his doctrine is not\ndue to his appeal to the authority of Aristotle and Augustine. Rather,\nas Mojsisch shows, the separation of the intellect is due to its\nessential intellectuality. Since Dietrich claims that the agent\nintellect is intellect through its own essence, he need not\ndemonstrate its property of separateness when it acts as efficient\ncause of the human soul. Separateness is a property of its essential\nintellectuality.\n",
