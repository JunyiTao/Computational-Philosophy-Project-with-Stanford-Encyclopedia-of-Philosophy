    "main_text": "Life and Background\n1. Life and Background\n\nSidgwick was born on May 31, 1838, in the small Yorkshire town of\nSkipton. The extended Sidgwick family was well-known in the area and\nquite prosperous, with their cotton-spinning mills representing the\noldest manufacturing firms in the town (Dawson 1882; Schultz 2017).\nBut Henry was the second surviving son of Mary Crofts and the Reverend\nWilliam Sidgwick, the headmaster of the grammar school in Skipton, who\ndied when Henry was only three. Henry\u2019s older brother William\nwent on to become an Oxford don, as did his younger brother Arthur.\nHis sister Mary, known as Minnie, ended up marrying a second cousin,\nEdward White Benson, who in addition to being an early mentor of\nHenry\u2019s (and Rugby master) went on to become the archbishop of\nCanterbury. The Sidgwick and Benson families would contribute much to\nEnglish letters and science over the course of the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries, though their legacies have also been\ncontroversial on some counts (Askwith 1971; Bolt 2011; Goldhill\n2016).\n\nHenry was educated at Rugby and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where\nhe took his degree in 1859. As an undergraduate, he excelled at both\nmathematics and, especially, classics, in due course becoming Craven\nScholar, 33rd Wrangler, and Senior Classic, also winning the\nChancellor\u2019s Medal. He wound up staying at Cambridge his entire\nlife, first, beginning in October of 1859, as a Fellow of Trinity and\na lecturer in classics\u2014a position that in the later sixties\nevolved into a lectureship in the moral sciences\u2014then, from\n1875, as praelector in moral and political philosophy, and finally,\nfrom 1883, as Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy. He resigned\nhis Fellowship in 1869 because he could no longer subscribe in good\nconscience to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, as\nthe position required. This act helped inspire the successful\nopposition to such requirements. In 1881 he was elected an honorary\nFellow, and in 1885, he regained a full Fellowship, remarking on the\nchanging times: \n\n\nLast time I swore that I would drive away strange doctrine; this time\nI only pledged myself to restore any College property that might be in\nmy possession when I ceased to be a Fellow. (Memoir: 400)\n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s Cambridge career was rich in reformist activity\n(Rothblatt 1968; Harvie 1976; Todd 1999). As an undergraduate, he had\nbeen elected to the \u201cApostles\u201d, the secret Cambridge\ndiscussion society that did much to shape the intellectual direction\nof modern Cambridge; Sidgwick\u2019s allegiance to this group was a\nvery significant feature of his life and work (Lubenow 1998). The\n1860s, which he described as his years of \u201cStorm and\nStress\u201d over his religious views and commitments, were also the\nyears in which his identity as an academic liberal took shape, and he\ngot caught up in a range of causes emphasizing better and broader\neducational opportunities, increased professionalism, and greater\nreligious freedom. He evolved into an educational reformer committed\nto downplaying the influence of classics, introducing modern subjects,\nand opening up higher education to women. Much influenced by the\nwritings of F. D. Maurice and J. S. Mill, he would become one of the\nleading proponents of higher education for women and play a guiding\nrole in the foundation of Newnham College, Cambridge, one of the first\ncolleges for women in England (McWilliams Tullberg 1975 [1998];\nSutherland 2006). He was also active in the cause of university\nreorganization generally, in due course serving on the General Board\nof Studies, the Special Board for Moral Sciences, and the Indian Civil\nService Board, and he worked tirelessly to expand educational\nopportunities and professionalize educational efforts through such\nvehicles as correspondence courses, extension lectures, the Cambridge\nWorking Men\u2019s College, and the University Day Training College\nfor teachers (initiated by Oscar Browning). Such educational reforms\nwere, he held, also of political value in overcoming class conflict\nand social strife. But Sidgwick\u2019s broader political commitments,\nwhich ranged from academic liberal to Liberal Unionist\u2014he joined\nthe breakaway faction of the Liberal Party opposing Gladstone\u2019s\npolicy of Home Rule for Ireland\u2014to independent, were complex and\nshifting; he was not able to rise above the marked imperialistic and\norientalist, racist tendencies of the late Victorian era (Schultz\n2004; Bell 2007, 2016).\n\nIn 1876 Sidgwick married Eleanor Mildred Balfour, the sister of his\nformer student, Arthur Balfour, the future prime minister. An\naccomplished and independent woman with serious scientific\ninterests\u2014she collaborated with her brother-in-law Lord Rayleigh\non many scientific papers\u2014Eleanor Sidgwick worked as an equal\npartner with her husband on many fronts, particularly higher education\nfor women and parapsychology. She eventually took over as Principal of\nNewnham in 1892, and was for many decades a mainstay of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, an organization that Henry had helped to found\n(in 1882) and several times headed, though his interest in the\nparanormal had been evident long before. The Sidgwicks hoped that\ntheir psychical research might ultimately support some core religious\nclaims, particularly concerning the personal survival of physical\ndeath, which they deemed a vital support for morality. Their extensive\nand often quite methodologically sophisticated investigations were not\nas conclusive as they had hoped, but following Henry\u2019s death\nfrom cancer on August 28, 1900, Eleanor did become persuaded that he\nhad succeeded in communicating from \u201cthe other world\u201d. The\nSidgwicks\u2019 work in this field continues to this day to be\ndebated by academic parapsychologists (Gauld 1968; Braude 2003;\nMcLuhan & Gauld 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nAlthough Sidgwick published extensively in his lifetime, he is best\nknown for his first major book, The Methods of Ethics, which\nfirst appeared in 1874 and went through five editions during his\nlifetime. His second most widely read book would be his Outlines\nof the History of Ethics for English Readers, which appeared in\n1886 as an expanded version of the article on the subject that he had\ncontributed to the famous ninth edition of the Encyclopedia\nBritannica. But he also published The Principles of Political\nEconomy (1883), The Elements of Politics (1891), and\nPractical Ethics, A Collection of Addresses and Essays\n(1898), and after his death, Eleanor Sidgwick worked with various of\nhis former colleagues to bring out Lectures on the Ethics of T. H.\nGreen, H. Spencer, and J. Martineau (1902), Philosophy, Its\nScope and Relations (1902), The Development of European\nPolity (1903), Miscellaneous Essays and Addresses\n(1904), Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant and Other Philosophical\nLectures and Essays (1905), and Henry Sidgwick, A Memoir\n(1906), which Eleanor and Arthur Sidgwick assembled largely from his\ncorrespondence and journal. These posthumous works are typically quite\npolished and shed a great deal of light on the works that Sidgwick\nhimself saw through publication (Schneewind 1977).\n\nAs Sidgwick\u2019s publications attest, he was not only a pre-eminent\nmoral philosopher, with sophisticated views on both going\ncontroversies in ethics and metaethics and the history of these\nsubjects, but also an accomplished epistemologist, classicist,\neconomist, political theorist, political historian, literary critic,\nparapsychologist, and educational theorist. If he was a founder of the\nCambridge school of philosophy, he was also a founder of the Cambridge\nschool of economics (along with his colleague and sometimes nemesis\nAlfred Marshall) and of the Cambridge school of political theory\n(along with such colleagues as Browning and Sir John Seeley). If such\nstudents as Moore and Russell owed him much, so too did such students\nand admirers as Balfour, J. N. Keynes, F. W. Maitland, F. Y.\nEdgeworth, James Ward, Frank Podmore, and E. E. Constance Jones. He\nhad serious interests in many areas of philosophy and theology, and\nalso wrote insightfully about poetry and literature, two of his great\nloves (at Newnham, he lectured on Shakespeare, along with such\nsubjects as philosophy and economics). Indeed, Sidgwick was a force in\nthe larger cultural developments of his age, active in such\ninfluential discussion societies as the Metaphysical Society and the\nSynthetic Society. His friends included George Eliot, T. H. Green,\nJames Bryce, H. G. Dakyns, Roden Noel, and, of special importance,\nJohn Addington Symonds, the erudite cultural historian, poet, and man\nof letters who was a pioneer in the serious historical study (and\npromotion) of same sex love (Schultz 2004). Sidgwick\u2019s versatile\nand many-sided intellect\u2014not to mention his keen wit\u2014are\ntypically better displayed in his essays and letters than in his\nbest-known academic books. He was in fact much loved for his gentle\nhumor (or \u201cSidgwickedness\u201d) and sympathetic conversation,\nand his philosophical students prized him for his candor. As Balfour\nput it: \n\n\nOf all the men I have known he was the readiest to consider every\ncontroversy and every controversialist on their merits. He never\nclaimed authority; he never sought to impose his views; he never\nargued for victory; he never evaded an issue. (Memoir:\n311)\n\n",
