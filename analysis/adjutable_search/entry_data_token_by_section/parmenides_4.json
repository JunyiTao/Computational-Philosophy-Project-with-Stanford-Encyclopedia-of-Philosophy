    "main_text": "Overview of Parmenides\u2019 Poem || The Way of Mortals\n2.4 The Way of Mortals\n\nWe have decidedly less complete evidence for the revelation\u2019s\nsecond phase, Parmenides\u2019 cosmology. The direct evidence\nprovided by the last lines of fragment 8 (50\u201364) and by the\nother fragments plausibly assigned to this portion of the poem (frs. 9\nthrough 19) originally accounted for perhaps only ten percent of the\ncosmology\u2019s original length. Since a number of these fragments\nare programmatic, we still have a good idea of some of the major\nsubjects it treated. From the end of fragments 8 and fragments 9\nthrough 15a we know that these included accounts of the cosmos\u2019\ntwo basic principles, light and night, and then of the origin, nature,\nand behavior of the heavens and their inhabitants, including the\nstars, sun, moon, the Milky Way, and the earth itself. Witness the\nprogrammatic remarks of fragments 10 and 11:\n\n\nYou will know the aether\u2019s nature, and in the aether all the/\nsigns, and the unseen works of the pure torch/ of the brilliant sun,\nand from whence they came to be,/ and you will learn the wandering\nworks of the round-eyed moon/ and its nature, and you will know too\nthe surrounding heaven,/ both whence it grew and how Necessity\ndirecting it bound it/ to furnish the limits of the stars. (Fr.\n10)\n\n\u2026how the earth and sun and moon/ and the shared aether and the\nheavenly milk and Olympos/ outermost and the hot might of the stars\nbegan/ to come to be. (Fr. 11)\n\n\nA few fragments, including one known only via Latin translation, show\nthat Parmenides also dealt with the physiology of reproduction (frs.\n17\u201318) and with human thought (fr. 16). Fortunately, the sketchy\npicture of the cosmology furnished by the fragments is significantly\nimproved by the testimonia. The impression given by the\nfragments of the range of subjects is confirmed by both Simplicius,\nwho comments after quoting fr. 11 that Parmenides\u2019 account of\nthe genesis of things extended down to the parts of animals (Simp.\nin Cael. 559.26\u20137), and likewise by Plutarch\u2019s\njudgment that Parmenides\u2019 cosmology has so much to say about the\nearth, heaven, sun, moon, and stars, right down to the genesis of\nhuman beings, that it omits none of the major subjects typically\ntreated by ancient natural philosophers (Plu. Col. 1114B-C).\nA particularly important testimonium in the doxographer\nA\u00ebtius paraphrases, explicates, and supplements fr. 12 in ways\nthat give us a better picture of the structure of Parmenides\u2019\ncosmos (A\u00ebt. 2.7.1 = 28A37a Diels-Kranz). Likewise,\nTheophrastus\u2019 comments on fragment 16 at De Sensibus\n1\u20134 appear to provide more information about Parmenides\u2019\nviews on cognition. The ancient testimonia tend to confirm\nthat Parmenides sought to explain an incredibly wide range of natural\nphenomena, including especially the origins and specific behaviors of\nboth the heavenly bodies and the terrestrial population. One\nfundamental problem for developing a coherent view of\nParmenides\u2019 philosophical achievement has been how to understand\nthe relation between the two major phases of the goddess\u2019\nrevelation.\n",
