Is Divine Simplicity Compatible with Creaturely Freedom and God\u2019s Contingent Knowledge?\n\nSuppose a creaturely agent freely performs an action A. He\nfiles his tax return, say, by the April 15th deadline. Suppose that\nthe freedom involved is not the compatibilist \u201cfreedom of the\nturnspit\u201d (to borrow Kant\u2019s phrase) but the robust freedom\nthat implies both that the agent is the unsourced source of the action\nand that the agent could have done otherwise. The performance of\nA makes true a number of contingent propositions, all of them\nknown by God in his omniscience. Now if subject S knows that\nproposition p, and p is contingent, then it would\nseem that S\u2019s knowing that p is or involves an\naccidental (as opposed to essential) intrinsic state of\nS. If God is omniscient, then he knows every (non-indexical)\ntruth, including every contingent truth. It seems to follow that God\nhas at least as many accidental intrinsic states as there are\ncontingent truths. But this contradicts DDS according to which there\nis nothing intrinsic to God that is distinct from God.\n\nConsider the mental state God is in when he knows that Tom freely\nfiles his tax return on April 14th, 2014. This divine mental state is\nan intrinsic state God is in contingently. If God were identical to\nthis state, then he could not be a se. For if God were\nidentical to the state, then God would be dependent on something\n\u2013 Tom\u2019s libertarianly free action \u2013 that is external\nto God and beyond his control. Now anything that compromises the\ndivine aseity will compromise the divine simplicity, the latter being\nan entailment of the former. So it seems that an omniscient God cannot\nbe simple if there are free creaturely agents and God knows what they\ndo and leave undone. There is also the problem that if the divine\nmental state in question were identical to God, then the truth God\nknows when he knows that Tom files on April 14th would be\nnecessarily true.\n\nThe problem is expressible as an aporetic pentad:\n\nEvery free agent is a libertarianly-free (L-free)\nagent.\nGod is ontologically simple (where simplicity is an entailment of\naseity and vice versa): there is nothing intrinsic to God that is\ndistinct from God.\nThere are contingent items of divine all-knowledge that do not\n(wholly) depend on divine creation, but do (partially) depend on\ncreaturely freedom.\nNecessarily, if God knows some truth t, then (i) there an\nitem intrinsic to God such as a mental act or a belief state (ii)\nwhereby God knows t.\nGod exists necessarily.\n\n\nEach limb of the above pentad has a strong, though not irresistible,\nclaim on a classical theist\u2019s acceptance. As for (1), if God is\nL-free, as he must be on classical theism, then it is\nreasonable to maintain that every free agent is L-free. For\nif \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019 is an essential ingredient\nin the analysis of \u2018Agent A freely performs action\nX,\u2019 then it is highly plausible to maintain that this\nis so whether the agent is God or Socrates. Otherwise,\n\u2018free\u2019 will means something different in the two cases.\nFurthermore, if man is made in the image and likeness of God, then it\nis surely arguable if not obvious that part of what this means is that\nman is a spiritual being who is libertarianly free just as God is. If\na man is a deterministic system, then one wonders in what sense man is\nin the image of God.\n\nAs for (2), some reasons were given earlier for thinking that a theism\nthat understands itself must uphold God\u2019s ontological simplicity\ninasmuch as it is implied by the divine aseity. An example of (3) is\nOswald\u2019s shooting of Kennedy. The act was freely performed by\nOswald, and the proposition that records it is a contingent truth\nknown by God in his omniscience.\n\nThe plausibility of (4) may be appreciated as follows. Whatever else\nknowledge is, it is plausibly regarded as a species of true belief. A\nbelief is an intrinsic state of a subject. Moreover, to unpack the\nsecond clause of (3), beliefs are individuated by their contents:\nbeliefs or believings with different contents are different beliefs.\nIt cannot be that one and the same act of believing has different\ncontents at different times or in different possible worlds.\n\n(5), if not obvious on its own, could be taken as an entailment of\n(2). If in God essence and existence are one, then God cannot not\nexist.\n\nBut although each limb of the pentad is plausibly maintained and is\ntypically maintained by theists who uphold DDS, they cannot all be\ntrue. Any four limbs, taken together, entail the negation of the\nremaining one.\n\nTo illustrate, let us consider how the limbs of the pentad, excepting\n(2), entail the negation of (2). Being omniscient, God knows that\nOswald freely chose to kill Kennedy. But Oswald\u2019s\nL-freedom precludes us from saying that God\u2019s knowledge\nof this contingent fact depends solely on the divine will. For it also\ndepends on Oswald\u2019s L-free authorship of his evil deed,\nan authorship that God cannot prevent or override once he has created\nL-free agents. But this is inconsistent with the divine aseity. For to\nsay that God is a se is to say that God is not dependent on\nanything distinct from himself for his existence or intrinsic\nproperties or states. But, by (4), God is in the state of knowing that\nOswald freely chose to kill Kennedy, and his being in this state\ndepends on something outside of God\u2019s control, namely,\nOswald\u2019s L-free choice. In this way the divine aseity\nis compromised, and with it the divine simplicity.\n\nIt seems, then, that our aporetic pentad is an inconsistent pentad.\nThe defender of DDS cannot deny either the divine simplicity or the\ndivine necessity, which is an entailment of simplicity. But an\nupholder of the divine simplicity has the option of denying (1) and\nmaintaining that, while God is L-free, creaturely agents are\nfree only in a compatibilist sense (\u2018C-free\u2019). If\ncreaturely agents are C-free, but not L-free, then\nOswald could not have done otherwise, and it is possible for the\nupholder of divine simplicity to say that that Oswald\u2019s\nC-free choice is no more a threat to the divine aseity than\nthe fact that God knows the contingent truth that creaturely agents\nexist. The latter is not a threat to the divine aseity because the\nexistence of creaturely agents derives from God in a way that\nOswald\u2019s L-free choice does not derive from God.\n\nA second and perhaps better response would be to reject (4) in one of\nthe ways canvassed by W. M. Grant (2012). Here are two ways that\nappear promising. On what Grant calls the Belief Model, God\u2019s\nknowledge is a species of true belief, but God\u2019s beliefs are not\nintrinsic states of God. They are not mental acts or episodes. Beliefs\nare relational. To have a belief is to be related to a proposition,\nwhere propositions are not contents of belief states, but abstract\nentities that exist independently of the subjects who believe them.\nFor God to believe that Oswald killed Kennedy is for God to stand in a\nrelation to a proposition without it being the case that there is\nanything intrinsic to God that grounds his standing in the belief\nrelation to the Oswald proposition as opposed to any other\nproposition. Believing, at least in the case of God, is an external\nrelation, not an internal relation grounded in an intrinsic feature of\nthe believer. Various objections can be brought against this Belief\nModel of divine cognition, but if they can be turned aside, then (4)\nfalls and the pentad is solved.\n\nA second way to reject (4) is by adopting what Grant calls an\nImmediate Cognition Model of divine knowing. Accordingly, God\u2019s\nknowledge is not mediated by propositions or anything else, but is\ndirectly of contingent realities. God\u2019s knowledge of Socrates\nhas as an essential constituent Socrates himself, warts and all. On\nthis externalist model, as on the Belief Model, there nothing internal\nto God and intrinsic to him in virtue of which he possesses contingent\nknowledge, and thus nothing contingent in him to compromise his\nsimplicity.\n\nOne ought to ask, however, whether either model preserves the divine\naseity which is a main motive for the divine simplicity (Brower 2009).\nIf the simple God\u2019s knowing of Socrates includes the man himself\nin his bodily reality, this would seem to make God dependent on\nsomething other than himself. Brower thinks the problem can be defused\nby observing that God is the cause of the contingent entities on which\nhis contingent knowledge depends. Grant (2012, 267), however, thinks\nthat neither externalist model poses a problem for aseity whether or\nnot God causes the contingent objects he knows. If God exists from\nhimself, then he is a se. But the existence of a thing is\nintrinsic to it, not relational. So it suffices for the divine aseity\nthat God not depend on anything else for what he is intrinsically.\nThat God\u2019s knowing of Socrates depends on Socrates is not to the\npoint: this knowing is purely relational and not intrinsic to God.\n",
