    "main_text": "Naked Statistical Evidence || Non-revisionist responses\n6.4 Non-revisionist responses\n\nBelow are six non-revisionist moves legal probabilists can make in\nresponse to the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence.\n\nFirst, legal probabilists can deny that in scenarios such as\nGatecrasher the probability of liability is high enough to\nmeet the required threshold. Kaye (1979a) argues that whenever there\nis no other evidence besides naked statistical evidence, this is not\nenough for the plaintiff to win because the evidence is suspiciously\nthin. This circumstance should lead the fact-finders to lower the\nprobability of liability below the requisite threshold. Along similar\nlines, Nance (2016) argues that when the evidence presented at trial\nis incomplete\u2014that is, evidence that one would reasonably expect\nto see at trial is missing\u2014the defendant should not be found\nliable. This strategy  might work in\nscenarios such as Blue Bus in which the paucity of the\nevidence could well be the plaintiff\u2019s fault. But the difficulty is, it is unclear\nwhether this strategy works for scenarios such as Gatecrasher\nor Prisoner in which the paucity of the evidence is a\ncharacteristic of the scenarios themselves, not anyone\u2019s\nfault.\n\nSecond, legal probabilists can appeal to the reference class problem\n(Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001; see also later \n Section 7). An individual may fall under different\nreference classes. If 3% of those who smoke have lung cancer and 0.1%\nof those who exercise regularly have lung cancer, what about someone\nwho smokes and exercises regularly? In Gatecrasher, it is\narbitrary to single out the group of people at the stadium and not the\ngroup of people with a history of trespassing. There is no clear\nreason why one or the other reference class was chosen. The choice of\nanother reference class could have led to a different conclusion about\nthe defendant\u2019s probability of liability. This approach has also\nbeen endorsed by scholars who are decidedly opposed to legal\nprobabilism (Allen and Pardo 2007). Critics of this approach note\nthat the reference class problem affects any evidence-based judgment.\nIn assessing the strength of any piece of evidence, different\nreference classes can be used, say the class of witnesses who give\ndetailed descriptions of what they saw or the class of witnesses who\nare nervous (Redmayne 2008).\n\nThird, legal probabilists can observe that probabilistic claims based\non naked statistical evidence are not resilient enough against\npossible countervailing evidence (on the notion of resilience and\nstability of belief, see Skyrms 1980; Leitgeb 2014). If an eyewitness\nwere to assert that the prisoner did not participate in the riot, the\nprobability that he would be guilty of killing the guard should be\nlowered significantly. Presumably, trial verdicts cannot be so\nvolatile. They should aim to some degree of stability even in light of\npossible further evidence (Bolinger 2021). A problem with this\napproach is that more evidence could always be found that would change\none\u2019s probabilistic assessment. A further problem is that the\npuzzles of naked statistical evidence are cases in which no further\nevidence is\u2014or could possibly be\u2014available. But adding the\nassurance that the probabilistic claims could not be revised does not\nmake the naked statistics less problematic.\n\nFourth, legal probabilists can insist that verdicts solely based on\nnaked statistics do not promote the goal of expected utility\nmaximization. This is not so much because the naked statistics are bad\nevidence, but rather, because reliance on them may have a number of\nunintended costs, such as suboptimal allocation of the burden of error\nor lack of deterrence. In Blue Bus, for example, a verdict\nagainst the company with the largest market share might create a\nperverse economic incentive against larger companies (Posner 1973). It\nis unclear how this explanation could be extended to other cases such\nas Gatecrasher or Prisoner, and there are even\nvariants of Blue Bus not susceptible to this objection (Wells\n1992). Alternatively, Dahlman (2020) argues that verdicts based on\nnaked statistical evidence do not provide any added incentive for\nlawful conduct because they would not make a distinction between\nlawful and unlawful behavior. (On deterrence and naked statistics, see\nalso Enoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015).\n\n\nFifth, another line of response for legal probabilists is to concede\nthat the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence demonstrate the\ninadequacy of simple probabilistic thresholds as proof standards\n(Urbaniak 2019). Instead of the posterior probability of liability, a\nnumber of scholars have focused on the likelihood ratio \\(P(E\\pmid\nH)/P(E \\pmid H')\\). Their argument is that, even though naked\nstatistical evidence can support a high posterior probability of\nliability, the likelihood ratio of this evidence equals one because it\ncould be presented against a defendant no matter what the defendant\ndid. If so, naked statistical evidence should have no evidential value\n(Cheng 2012; Sullivan 2019). However, Dahlman (2020) has criticized\nthis argument noting that, under plausible assumptions, the likelihood\nratio of naked statistical evidence is significantly greater than one.\n Di Bello (2019) argues that in cases such as Prisoner and\nGatecrasher the likelihood ratio could take a range of\ndifferent values depending on the background information that is taken\ninto account. The likelihood ratio of naked statistical evidence in\nthose scenarios is therefore neither one nor greater than one, but\nstrictly speaking unknown (for a critique of this argument, see\nUrbaniak et al. 2020).\nFinally, legal probabilists can reformulate probabilistic standards\nof proof using the concept of knowledge. Moss (2018) argues that a\nprobabilistic belief, just like a full belief, can constitute\nknowledge.  This notion of probabilistic knowledge can be used to\nformulate an account of standards of proof for trial decisions (Moss,\n2018: ch. 10; Moss, forthcoming). The preponderance standard for civil\ncases would be met if, based on the evidence presented at trial,\njudges or jurors have at least .5 credence that the defendant is\nliable, and this probabilistic belief constitutes knowledge.  The\nstandard in criminal cases\u2014proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\u2014would instead require knowledge of the probabilistic\nbelief that the defendant is extremely likely to be guilty or simply\nfull-fledged knowledge of guilt. To the extent that naked statistical\nevidence does not warrant full-fledged knowledge or probabilistic\nknowledge, knowledge-based accounts offer a solution to the puzzles of\nnaked statistical evidence. In addition, the probabilistic knowledge\naccount of standards of proof promises to vindicate the intuition that\nprobability alone is not enough for legal proof while also\nacknowledging the key role that probability plays in decision-making\nat trial (however, for a critique of knowledge-based accounts of legal\nproof from a legal standpoint, see Allen 2021).\n\n\n",
