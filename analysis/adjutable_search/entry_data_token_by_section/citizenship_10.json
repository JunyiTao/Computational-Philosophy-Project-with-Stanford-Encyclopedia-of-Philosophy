    "main_text": "Citizenship\u2019s new frontier?\n5. Conclusion\n\nOur survey of contemporary discussions has highlighted important\ndifferences over each of the three dimensions of citizenship. As a\nlegal status, citizenship remains the keystone of contemporary\nconceptions: its normative core is the principle that citizens shall\nenjoy equal rights, although most would now agree that, in certain\ncircumstances, equal consideration of individuals\u2019 interests may\njustifiably result in differential treatment by the state. This broad\nagreement on principle leaves ample room for disagreement over the\nparticulars, as witnessed by the recurring debates over affirmative\naction and minority rights. These discussions have become a hallmark\nof contemporary liberal societies, and our legal and political\ndiscourses are well equipped to handle them. The deeper worry, which\nnew forms of political violence have made more acute, centres upon\nachieving a proper balance between the recognition of difference and\nthe affirmation of common principles to which all citizens adhere.\n\nHow robust an identity can citizenship provide in complex and\ninternally diverse societies? There is a tension here that is\ndifficult to resolve: our awareness of the pluralist nature of\ncontemporary societies leads us to underscore the importance of\ngeneral legal and political principles (democracy, human rights, rule\nof law) rather than the traditional emblems of nationality: common\nhistory and culture. Postnationalists, in particular, emphasize the\nrole of democratic political practice in securing social integration.\nYet, the complexity and scale of contemporary liberal societies tend\nto make this practice less significant in the lives of most citizens,\na fact reflected in declining levels of participation in formal\npolitical institutions. Are we not expecting too much from democratic\npolitical practice under current circumstances?\n\nThis question brings us face to face with the difficult issue of\ncitizens\u2019 political agency, which has long been central to\ndebates between liberals and republicans. Whether we understand\ndemocracy in terms of civic self-government (republican version) or as\nthe ability to exercise control over government (liberal version), it\nis not easy to determine how, and through what institutional\nmechanisms, citizens can exercise meaningful political agency in\ncomplex societies. This difficulty is epitomized in the debate over\ntransnational citizenship. Although global citizenship is conceivable\nfirst and foremost as a legal status securing a number of fundamental\nhuman rights, most authors agree that it should not be strictly legal\nin nature and must have a significant political dimension. One senses,\nhowever, a distinct malaise when it comes to identifying appropriate\nnormative standards and to locating the institutions through which\nthese could be approximated.\n\nIn the end, our dismissal of the\nencyclop\u00e9diste\u2019s interest in distinguishing\nsubject and citizen may have been too hasty. If being a citizen in a\nliberal-democratic political community is to mean something more than\nthe status of legal subject, we must be ready to state what\nthis \u201cmore\u201d entails. This stubborn blind-spot of theories\nof citizenship leads us to some of the most difficult issues\npertaining to the very possibility of democracy in the contemporary\nworld.\n",
