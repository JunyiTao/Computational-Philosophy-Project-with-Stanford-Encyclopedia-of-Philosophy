    "main_text": "Psychoanalysis and Utopian Vision || Repression\n4.2  Repression\n\n\nMarcuse introduces two new terms to distinguish between the biological\nvicissitudes of the instincts and the social.  Basic\nrepression refers to the type of repression or modification of\nthe instincts that is necessary \u201cfor the perpetuation of the\nhuman race in civilization\u201d (Marcuse 1955: 35). At this level,\nrepression does not lend itself to domination or\noppression. Surplus repression, on the other hand, refers to\n\u201cthe restrictions necessitated by social domination\u201d\n(Marcuse 1955: 35). The purpose of surplus repression is to shape the\ninstincts in accordance with the present \u201cperformance\nprinciple\u201d which is \u201cthe prevailing form of the\nreality principle\u201d (Marcuse 1955: 35).\n\nIt is in this idea of the performance principle where Marx and Freud\nmeet.\n\n\nThe performance principle, which is that of an acquisitive and\nantagonistic society in the process of constant expansion, presupposes\na long development during which domination has been increasingly\nrationalized: control over social labor now reproduces society on a\nlarge scale and under improving conditions. For a long way, the\ninterests of domination and the interests of the whole coincide: the\nprofitable utilization of the productive apparatus fulfills the needs\nand faculties of individuals. For the vast majority of the population,\nthe scope and mode of satisfaction are determined by their own labor;\nbut their labor is work for an apparatus which they do not control,\nwhich operates as an independent power to which individuals must\nsubmit if they want to live. And it becomes the more alien the more\nspecialized the division of labor becomes. Men do not live their own\nlives but perform pre-established functions. While they work, they do\nnot fulfill their own needs and faculties but work in\nalienation. (Marcuse 1955: 45)\n\nMarcuse\u2019s point here is that while work is necessary for the\nmaintenance of life, in our society there has been a transition from\nthe basic amount of work needed to maintain life to what we might call\nsurplus work. There is a distinction here between the work that\nis needed for one\u2019s satisfaction and work that is needed for the\napparatus. The worker has no control insofar as he has no say in\nwhat his wages will be and cannot determine the amount of work that is\nneeded to meet his needs. Work in a capitalist society extends\nitself beyond what is required for the satisfaction of the worker to\nwhat will maximize profit for the capitalist. The\n\u201cpre-established function\u201d of the worker is to produce\ncommodities and maximize profit for the capitalist. The worker\nmust work to live but the conditions under which she works is\ndetermined by the apparatus. \n\nBeing used by the apparatus requires conformity with the\napparatus. This is what Marcuse means by the performance\nprinciple. Members of society must perform according to the\ndictates of their pre-established function. This performance\nrequires the restriction of the libido. The worker must be\nmanipulated in such a way so that these restrictions seem to function\nas rational, external objective laws which are then internalized by the\nindividual. The desires of the individual must conform to the\ndesires of the apparatus. The individual must define himself as\nthe apparatus defines all humanity. As Marcuse puts it, \u201che\ndesires what he is supposed to desire\u201d (Marcuse 1955: 46).  \n\nAlthough Marcuse\u2019s theory of repression and the recognition of\ntwo forms of repression is a useful theoretical tool for understanding\nwhy we have not entered a revolutionary period, it falls short of\nexplaining how desires are manipulated in such a way that\none-dimensional identities are formed. One of the most\ninteresting and fruitful criticisms of what is now called the\n\u201crepression hypothesis\u201d (Foucault 1976 [1990]: 17\u201349). \nFor Foucault, forms of subjectivity or identity are not a result of the\nrepression of some primordial desire. Rather, identities are\nformed through power and certain discursive practices. Further,\nin the process of identity-formation, knowledge is not repressed but\nrather, called forth or produced. In his critique of Marcuse,\nFoucault writes:\n\n I would also distinguish myself from para-Marxist like Marcuse who\ngive the notion of repression an exaggerated role\u2014because power\nwould be a fragile thing if its only function were to repress, if it\nworked only through the mode of censorship, exclusion, blockage and\nrepression, in the manner of a great Superego, exercising itself only\nin a negative way. If, on the contrary, power is strong this is\nbecause, as we are beginning to realize, it produces effects at the\nlevel of desire\u2014and also at the level of knowledge. Far from\npreventing knowledge, power produces it. (Foucault 1980: 59)\n",
