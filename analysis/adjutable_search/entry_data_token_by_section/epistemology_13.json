    "main_text": "What is Justification? || Internal vs. External\n3.3 Internal vs. External\n\nConsider a science fiction scenario concerning a human brain that is\nremoved from its skull, kept alive in a vat of nutrient fluid, and\nelectrochemically stimulated to have precisely the same total series\nof experiences that you have had. Call such a brain a\n\u201cBIV\u201d: a BIV would believe everything that you believe,\nand would (it is often thought) be justified in believing those things\nto precisely the same extent that you are justified in believing them.\nTherefore, justification is determined solely by those internal\nfactors that you and your envatted brain doppelganger share. This view\nis what has come to be called \u201cinternalism\u201d about\n justification.[29]\n\nExternalism is simply the denial of internalism. Externalists say that\nwhat we want from justification is the kind of likelihood of truth\nneeded for knowledge, and the internal conditions that you share with\nyour BIV doppelganger do not generate such likelihood of truth. So\njustification involves external\n conditions.[30]\n\nAmong those who think that justification is internal, there is no\nunanimity on how to understand the notion of internality\u2014i.e.,\nwhat it is about the factors that you share with your BIV doppelganger\nthat makes those factors relevant to justification. We can distinguish\nbetween two approaches. According to the first, justification is\ninternal because we enjoy a special kind of access to J-factors: they\nare always recognizable on\n reflection.[31]\n Hence, assuming certain further premises (which will be mentioned\nmomentarily), justification itself is always recognizable on\n reflection.[32]\n According to the second approach, justification is internal because\nJ-factors are always mental states (see Conee and Feldman 2001).\nLet\u2019s call the former accessibility internalism and the\nlatter mentalist internalism.\n\nEvidentialism is typically associated with internalism of at least one\nof these two varieties, and reliabilism with\n externalism.[33]\n Let us see why. Evidentialism says, at a minimum, two things:\n\nE1 What makes\none justified in believing p is nothing over and above the\nevidence that one possesses.\nE2 What\nevidence one possesses is fixed by one\u2019s mental\nstates.\n\n\nBy virtue of E2, evidentialism is an instance of mentalist\ninternalism. Whether evidentialism is also an instance of\naccessibility internalism is a more complicated issue. The conjunction\nof E1 and E2 by itself implies nothing about the accessibility of\njustification. But mentalist internalists who endorse the first\nprinciple below will also be committed to accessibility internalism,\nand evidentialists who also endorse the second principle below will be\ncommitted to the accessibility of justification:\n\n\nLuminosity\n\nOne\u2019s own mind is cognitively luminous: Whenever one is in a\nparticular mental state, one can always recognize on reflection what\nmental states one is in, and in particular, one can always recognize\non reflection what evidence one\n possesses.[34]\n\nNecessity\n\nThe principles that determine what is evidence for what are\na priori\n recognizable.[35]\n Relying on a priori insight, one can therefore always\nrecognize on reflection whether, or the extent, to which a particular\nbody of evidence is evidence for\n p.[36]\n\n\nAlthough E1 and E2 by themselves do not imply access internalism,\ntheir conjunction with Luminosity and Necessity may imply access\n internalism.[37]\n\nNext, let us consider why reliabilism is an externalist theory.\nReliabilism says that the justification of one\u2019s beliefs is a\nfunction of the reliability of one\u2019s belief sources such as\nmemorial, perceptual and introspective states and processes. Even if\nthe operations of the sources are mental states, their reliability is\nnot itself be a mental state. Therefore, reliabilists reject mentalist\ninternalism. Moreover, insofar as the reliability of one\u2019s\nbelief sources is not itself recognizable by means of reflection, how\ncould reflection enable us to recognize when such justification\n obtains?[38]\n Reliabilists who take there to be no good answer to this question\nalso reject access\n internalism.[39]\n",
