    "main_text": "The Content of Religious Utterances || Paradoxical Content\n2.3 Paradoxical Content\n\nSome of the claims most commonly made about God\u2019s nature and\ndoctrinal claims, particularly those of Christianity, have been said\nto be absurd, paradoxical or impossible to understand. The most\nfamiliar version of this worry concerns the consistency of the\npredicates ascribed to God such as omnipotence and doctrinal views\nsuch as the Trinity. Considerable effort has been directed towards\nestablishing that religious claims are coherent (for example,\nSwinburne 1994). Those who concede that some religious claims are\nparadoxical have proposed a variety of different responses. Paradox in\nreligious claims has been seen as grounds for atheism (Martin 1990),\nfor modifying religious doctrine or changing our attitudes towards\nthem (Hick 1977a: 1993), or as an ineliminable part of faith\n(Kierkegaard [1844] 1985; see Evans 1989). However, there is a further\nquestion about what such claims mean. If we take paradoxical\nutterances (or ones that are in some way absurd or impossible to\nunderstand) as failing to express propositions, then allowing that\nsome of the principal expressions of faith are paradoxical (or absurd\nor impossible to understand) is thereby to reject (a*).\n\nA number of accounts of religious language appear potentially\nsympathetic with this approach. For example, Ronald Hepburn\n(1958)\u2014according to whom \u201cparadoxical and near-paradoxical\nlanguage is the staple of accounts of God\u2019s\nnature\u201d (16)\u2014proposes that religious ideas and stories may\nhave the role of imaginatively informing a moral way of life. This\nview has some similarities with fictionalism, discussed below. More\nrecently, Stephen Mulhall (2015) has suggested that some religious\nutterances can be understood as unresolvable riddles the meanings of\nwhich we are unable to grasp fully, inviting an open-ended process of\narticulating their meaning that is pursued by those engaged in\nreligious discourse.\n\nAlso relevant here are the works of authors in the apophatic and\nmystical tradition that was particularly prominent from mid-antiquity\nthrough to the late medieval period. Although a variety of accounts of\nreligious language are suggested by the writings of authors in this\ntradition, some of what they say appears sympathetic to paradoxicalism\nabout utterances about God\u2019s nature. Two themes that are found\nin their writings are particularly notable. First, God\u2019s nature\nis taken to be both inconceivable and inexpressible (Dionysius The\nMystical Theology: ch. 5; Gregory of Nyssa Contra Eunomium\nII: 61; Maximus the Confessor, Chapters on Knowledge:\npart one 1\u20132, part two 2; Maimonides, The Guide of the\nPerplexed: ch. 58). It appears to follow from this that in\nsaying, for example, \u201cGod is good\u201d, one does not succeed\nin representing God in either thought or language. A second theme\nfound in some apophatic writers is that an important aspect of\nreligious engagement is establishing a secure relationship with\nGod\u2014sometimes characterised as an \u201cascent\u201d to God\n(Dionysius The Mystical Theology: ch. 1.1; Cloud of\nUnknowing: ch. 4)\u2014and a recognition of the abject failure\nof what we say to communicate any representation of God\u2019s nature\nmay form part of that process. Far from being pointless, religious\ndiscourse about God may assist in the recognition of our intellectual\nand linguistic limitations (Cloud of Unknowing: ch. 8). For\nfurther discussion and other interpretations of these works see Turner\n1995 and for a detailed review focused on religious language see Scott\nand Citron 2016, G\u00e4b 2020 and Hewitt 2020.\n\nOne difficulty that might be pressed by supporters of the face value\ntheory is these theories, as least to the extent that they are\nproviding accounts of religious language, appear revisionary rather\nthan descriptive of the meanings of religious utterances. For example,\nthe proposal that \u201cGod is good\u201d does not simply express\nthe proposition that God is good seems, in the case of apophaticism,\nto be based on a contentious theological view about what can be\nrepresented in thought and language rather than what speakers mean\nwhen they utter this sentence. The sentence is used in a variety of\napparently descriptive ways by speakers: it is said to be true (or\nfalse), it is used in apparently valid arguments, can be embedded in a\nconditional, it is said to be a matter of belief or even of knowledge.\nAny account of religious language will need to do justice to the\nevidence that religious utterances are used descriptively,\nparticularly ones that put (a*) into question.\n",
