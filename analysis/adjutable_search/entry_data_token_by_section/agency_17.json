Concerning\nperception it was common to assume, often without any elaboration,\nthat the reference to the guiding role of beliefs takes care of the\nrole of perception. The standard theory does not limit the causal role\nof beliefs to those that the agent considers or possesses prior to the\nexecution of the action, and so we may assume that the beliefs that\nare supposed to play a causal guidance role include perceptual beliefs\nthat the agent acquires during the performance of the action. More\nrecent work (Mele 2003; Pacherie 2008; Schlosser 2012a) has shown that\nthe standard theory is compatible with the feedback-comparator model\nof movement control outlined above (see section\n4.5). This model accounts not only for the role of perceptual and\nproprioceptive input, but also for the guidance provided by internal\npredictions in the fine-tuning and execution of motor control.\n\nThe role of attention, however, was almost entirely unacknowledged, as\npointed out by Wu (2011, 2016). Whenever we pursue a goal, we must not\nonly select appropriate means. We must also select which features of\nthe situation to attend to in the guidance of action. Wu\nconceptualizes this in terms of a \u201cmany-many problem\u201d: in the pursuit\nof a goal we face typically too many perceptual inputs and too many\npossible behavioral outputs. The formation of an intention provides\nonly a partial solution. The content of an intention usually includes\nthe selection of the appropriate means. One intends, for instance, to\nopen the window in order to let in some fresh air. This constrains the\nrange of behavioral outputs and the range of perceptual inputs that\none needs to attend to. But it does not determine a specific enough\ninput-output mapping. Generally, the content of intentions is not\nfine-grained enough in order to properly guide the execution of\nmovements and the direction of attention. Wu suggests that the\nmany-many problems at those finer-grained levels are solved by\nattention. Following William James, Wu proposes that\nattention is the missing selection for action: the selection\nof perceptual inputs for the implementation of motor control. On this\nview, intention-mediated attention is an essential component\nof embodied agency. This raises the question of whether the selection\nof attention can itself be a genuine exercise of agency, and whether\nthe proposed account can be extended so as to account for the\nintentional direction and control of attention.\n",
