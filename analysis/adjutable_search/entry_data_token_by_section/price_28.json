    "main_text": "Recognition || The Imagist Theory of Occurrent Thinking\n5.6 The Imagist Theory of Occurrent Thinking\n\nAnother major focus is Price\u2019s analysis and criticism of the\nImagist Theory of (Occurrent) Thinking (e.g., Berkeley 1710; see\n1953a: 234ff). Price deserves credit for opposing the tendency amongst\nphilosophers of his time to underestimate the importance of images\n(Hamlyn [1984: 95] also remarks on Price\u2019s seriousness regarding\nimagism). Price claims that images, especially visual images (1953a:\n235\u2013237), are employed in thinking, for instance by enabling us\nto calculate things, or remember things.\n\nPrice contrasts imagism as a theory of thinking with\n\u201cverbalism\u201d, the theory that we think in words. Price\nallows that we do think in words. Imagists claim, however, that this\nverbal thinking is secondary, and if it is to be contentful, it has to\nbe cashable in images, whereas thinking in images does not require\nanything else to confer content on it. Price notes that strictly when\nsomeone thinks privately in words, they are employing images of words.\nBut on his understanding, an imagist about thinking means by\n\u201cimages\u201d non-verbal images and takes the basic components\nof thought to be \u201crepresentative images\u201d (1953a: 245;\n1951\u20131952: 143).\n\nHe argues that we ordinarily think in absence, with non-instantiative\nparticulars, that is, items which do not instantiate that which they\nenable us to think about (1953a: 253ff). He then affirms that images,\nin his sense, come closer to being instances of the concepts under\nwhich the topical objects fall than do words. They are, he says,\n\u201cquasi-instantiative\u201d (1953a: 255). Although Price is\nhimself prepared to say this, it is hard to understand talk of\ncloseness with regard to instantiation. Price helpfully\nsuggests that such things as models and diagrams also more closely\ninstantiate concepts than words do: they\u2019re also\n\u201cquasi-instantiative\u201d. Price\u2019s final criticism is\nthis: imagists have no good reason to insist that thinking has to\nemploy \u201cquasi-instantiative\u201d things. He says that thinking\nin words has content in virtue of links between the words and\nostensive definitions of those words. These definitions ground\nrecognitional capacities which get activated when experience presents\nthe right sorts of particular. Price puts it this way: \n\n\nmy memory of what a crocodile is like is already operating in another\nway, because my word-producing and word-recognising capacity is firmly\nlinked to it. (1953a: 263) \n\n\nThus, (A) occurrent thinking need not be carried by images, and (B)\nthinking in words is perfectly possible.\n\nPrice\u2019s understanding of how thinking, when it is carried by\nimages, works, is sketched in his answers to the traditional problems\nof resemblance. \n\n(1)\nThere are no hard rules about how closely images (say of a\ncrocodile) must resemble the thing thought about (the crocodile).\n\n(2)\nHow do images fix content by resemblance when crocodile-images\nresemble not only crocodiles but also other reptiles, and green images\nof crocodiles resemble green? \n\n\nPrice replies that images can be used to focus on one thing rather\nthan another by the presence of a word or a stimulating perception and\nbeing situated in a mental set (1953a: 268ff). To flesh this out, he\n(1953a: 273ff, 283\u2013284, 296) mentions Hume\u2019s proposal that\nsome images are \u201cpresent in power\u201d though not\n\u201cpresent in fact\u201d (1739\u20131740: I, i, 7; also\ndiscussed here: 1959c: 483), that is, that the subject has a\n\u201cmultiform image-producing capacity\u201d (1953a: 273), is\ndisposed to produce a sequence of multiple images, say, of a\ncrocodile, and not just one crocodile-image. These images fix what is\nfocused upon with a word or thought, though sometimes a word, say\n\u201ccrocodile\u201d, itself fixes the setting, the interpretation,\nand \u201cwhich of these resemblances will be the psychologically\neffective one\u201d (1953a: 269).\n\nPrice also addresses the traditional problem of generality, how\nimage-based thinking can have general content. Price argues that it is\nan illusion that it is somehow easy in an image-based model of\nthinking to account for thoughts about individuals. One has an image\nof a face but which individual face is it an image of? Couldn\u2019t\nanother person have a face that resembles that image? Price thinks\nHume makes some progress by postulating the availability of many other\nimages. Price also allows that in some cases it may be possible to\nhave generic images akin to composite images formed by superimposing\nlots of photographs. But in some cases of generality (e.g., the class\nof triangles) no such composite can be imagined. Price also allows\nindeterminate images, like Locke\u2019s (1689) suggested abstract\nideas, to sustain generality (1953a: 287\u2013294). Real spatial\nentities cannot be indeterminate, but images may be in a realm where\nindeterminacy is possible. Such speculative proposals about\nimage-realms are also central to his famous account of the afterlife\non which the \u201cNext world, if there is one, might be a world of\nmental images\u201d (1953c: 3; 1968b: 3; 1972: ch. 6; for discussion:\nBadham 1976: 68, 133\u2013146; Hick 1968: 110; Aldwinckle 1972:\n97\u201399; Lewis 1973: 142; Ducasse 1961: 128; Ayers [1971: 397]\ndefends Price against Penelhum\u2019s [1970: 47\u201353] charge of\nsolipsism).\n\nFor Price (1953a: 297), imagism\u2019s \u201cvery serious\ndefect\u201d is its inability to account for logical thinking (e.g.,\nwith negation, disjunction, possibility/actuality, and\nquantification).\n",
