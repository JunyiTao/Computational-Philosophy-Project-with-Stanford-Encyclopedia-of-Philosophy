    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks || Marx and Mill\n3.4 Marx and Mill\n\nAnother illustration of the use of Greek views of character can be\nfound in the writings of Karl Marx (1818\u20131883) and John Stuart\nMill (1806\u20131873). Although Marx is best known for his virulent\ncriticism of capitalism and Mill for his exposition and defense of\nliberal utilitarianism, these philosophers are treated together here\nbecause their approach to character is at crucial points deeply\nAristotelian. Both Marx and Mill accept Aristotle\u2019s insight that\nvirtue and good character are based on a self-esteem and\nself-confidence that arises from a satisfaction taken in the fully\nrealized expression of the rational powers characteristic of human\nbeings. They also accept Aristotle\u2019s recognition that the\nproduction and preservation of this type of self-esteem require that\nindividuals be part of specific socio-political structures. Aristotle\nemphasized the need for a special type of political community. Marx\nattended to smaller democratic workplaces. Mill\u2019s focus, still\ndifferent, was on political equality and equality in the family. \n\nMarx\u2019s early Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of\n1844 is famous for the discussion of how the organization of work\nunder capitalism alienates workers and encourages them to accept the\nvalues of capitalist society. Workers who are committed to capitalist\nvalues are characterized primarily by self-interested attitudes. They\nare most interested in material advancement for themselves, they are\ndistrustful of others\u2019 seemingly good intentions, and they view\nothers primarily as competitors for scarce positions. Given these\nattitudes, they are prone to a number of vices, including cowardice,\nintemperance, and lack of generosity.\n\nMarx\u2019s discussion of alienated labor suggests how work can be\nre-organized to eliminate alienation, undermine commitment to\ntraditional capitalist values and goals, and produce attitudes more\ncharacteristic of Aristotle\u2019s virtuous person. The key to this\ntransformation lies in re-organizing the nature of work so that\nworkers can express what Marx calls their \u201cspecies-being\u201d\nor those features of the self that are characteristically human. Very\nmuch like Aristotle, Marx seems to mean by this an individual\u2019s\nability to reason, and in particular his powers of choosing, deciding,\ndiscriminating, and judging. If work is re-organized to enable workers\nto express their rational powers, then each worker will perform tasks\nthat are interesting and mentally challenging (no worker will perform\nstrictly monotonous, routine, unskilled tasks). In addition, workers\nwill participate in deliberations about the ends to be achieved by the\nwork they do and how to achieve those ends. And, finally, these\ndeliberations will be organized democratically so that the opinions of\neach worker are fairly taken into account. When these conditions are\nput into place, labor is no longer \u201cdivided\u201d between\nskilled and unskilled or between managerial and non-managerial. Marx\nsuggests that if work is reorganized in these ways, it will promote\nfeelings of solidarity and camaraderie among workers and eventually\nbetween these workers and those in similar situations elsewhere. For\nthe fact that workers can express their characteristic human powers in\naction, coupled with the egalitarian conditions in the workplace, can\nupset competitive feelings and promote respect by removing the bases\nfor inferiority and superiority. Workers then come to exhibit some of\nthe more traditional virtues such as generosity and trustfulness, and\navoid some of the more traditional vices such as cowardice,\nstinginess, and self-indulgence.\n\nThat Marx\u2019s views seem derivative of Aristotle\u2019s in\nimportant ways is not surprising, for, unlike Hume whose knowledge of\nAristotle is not fully known, Marx explicitly drew upon\nAristotle\u2019s works. For further discussion of the extent to which\nMarx drew on Aristotle, see DeGolyer (1985).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) defended a version of liberal\nutilitarianism, but scholars disagree about what kind of\nutilitarianism that was. We can safely say that, as a utilitarian,\nMill thought human conduct should promote the happiness or welfare of\nthose affected. But was Mill an act-utilitarian, who thought that\nright acts are those that promote as much happiness as can be done on\nthe particular occasion, given the alternatives available to the\nagent? Or was he a rule-utilitarian, who thought that right conduct\nwas conduct permitted by rules that, when publicly known to be\ngenerally accepted or followed, would maximize happiness or welfare?\nOr was he a motive-utilitarian, who thought that one should act as the\nperson with the motives or virtues most productive of happiness should\nact? (For a discussion of these interpretive questions, see the\nrelated entry on\n Mill\u2019s moral and political philosophy.)\n Although this entry will steer clear of these interpretive hurdles\nand will concentrate on Mill\u2019s discussion of the nature of\nhappiness and of some of the institutional structures that can promote\nhappiness, these questions of interpretation will be relevant to a\nfinal assessment of Mill in Section 4, below.\n\nIn his essay On Liberty Mill claims that his version of\nutilitarianism rests on a conception of happiness that is appropriate\nto people as \u201cprogressive\u201d beings (Mill 1975, 12). And in\nUtilitarianism he suggests that this conception is focused on\nthe \u201chigher pleasures\u201d that serve to distinguish humans\nfrom animals (Mill 1979, 7\u201311). These higher pleasures turn out\nto be the activities and pursuits that exercise what in\nAristotle\u2019s view are our powers of practical deliberation\n\u2013 of choosing, judging, deciding, and discriminating. In On\nLiberty, Mill writes: \u201cHe who lets the world \u2026\nchoose his plan of life for him has no need of any other faculty than\nthe ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself\nemploys all his faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning\nand judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision,\ndiscrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and\nself-control to hold his deliberate decision\u201d (Mill 1975, 56).\nAs a person develops his powers of practical deliberation and comes to\nenjoy their exercise, he gains the self-esteem that is the basis of a\nvirtuous and well-lived life.\n\nFor further discussion of Mill\u2019s view of happiness, see Brink\n(1992).\n\nMill argued that seriously unequal societies, by preventing\nindividuals from developing their deliberative powers, mold\nindividuals\u2019 character in unhealthy ways and impede their\nability to live virtuous lives. For example, Mill argued, in deep\ndisagreement with the views of his own time, that societies that have\nsystematically subordinated women have harmed both men and women,\nmaking it almost impossible for men and women to form relationships of\ngenuine intimacy and understanding. In The Subjection of\nWomen, Mill wrote that the family, as constituted at his time,\nwas a \u201cschool of despotism,\u201d which taught those who\nbenefited from it the vices of selfishness, self-indulgence, and\ninjustice. Among working class men, the fact that wives were\nexcessively dependent on their husbands inspired meanness and\nsavagery. In chapter IV of The Subjection of Women, Mill goes\nso far as to claim that \u201c[a]ll the selfish propensities, the\nself-worship, the unjust self-preference, which exist among mankind,\nhave their source and root in, and derive their principal nourishment\nfrom, the present constitution of the relation between men and\nwomen\u201d (Mill 1988, 86). Women who have been legally and socially\nsubordinated to men become meek, submissive, self-sacrificing, and\nmanipulative. In brief, men evidence the vices of the slave master,\nwhile women evidence the vices of the slave. For moral lives and\npsychologically healthy relationships to be possible, Mill called for\naltered marital arrangements, supported by changes in law, that would\npromote the development and exercise of women\u2019s deliberative\npowers along with men\u2019s. Only under such conditions could women\nand men acquire feelings of real self-esteem rather than feelings of\nfalse inferiority and superiority.\n\nLike Aristotle, Mill recognized the power of political institutions to\ntransform individuals\u2019 desires and aims and to improve them\nmorally. In chapter III of Considerations on Representative\nGovernment, Mill writes approvingly of the democratic\ninstitutions of ancient Athens. He believed that by participating in\nthese institutions, Athenians were called upon to rise above their\nindividual partialities and to consider the general good. By\nco-operating with others in governing their community, he wrote, each\ncitizen \u201cis made to feel himself one of the public, and whatever\nis their interest to be his interest\u201d (Mill 1991, 79).\n\nAnd like Marx, Mill recognized the morally disturbing effects of a\nlife limited to routine and unskilled labor. In Principles of\nPolitical Economy, he recommended that relations of economic\ndependence between capitalists and workers be eliminated in favor of\ncooperatives either of workers with capitalists or of workers alone.\nIn these associations members were to be roughly equal owners of\ntools, raw materials, and capital. They worked as skilled\ncraftspersons under self-imposed rules. They elected and removed their\nown managers. By elevating the dignity of labor, Mill thought such\ncooperatives could convert \u201ceach human being\u2019s daily\noccupation into a school of the social sympathies and the practical\nintelligence\u201d and bring people as close to social justice as\ncould be imagined (Mill 1900, vol. 2, 295).\n",
