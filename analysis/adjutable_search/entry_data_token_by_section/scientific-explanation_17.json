    "main_text": "Pragmatic Theories of Explanation || Introduction\n6.1 Introduction\n\nDespite their many differences, the accounts of Hempel (focusing now\non just the DN rather than the IS model), Salmon,\nKitcher, and others discussed above, largely share a common overall\nconception of what the project of constructing a theory of explanation\nshould involve and (to a considerable extent) what criteria such a\ntheory should satisfy if it is to be successful.\n\u201cPragmatic\u201d theories of explanation depart from this\nconsensus in important respects. Let us say that a theory of\nexplanation contains \u201cpragmatic\u201d elements if (i) according\nto the theory, those elements require irreducible reference to facts\nabout the interests, beliefs or other features of the psychology of\nthose providing or receiving the explanation and/or (ii) irreducible\nreference to the \u201ccontext\u201d in which the explanation\noccurs. (For what this means, see below.) Although the writers\ndiscussed above agree that pragmatic elements play some role in the\nactivity of giving and receiving explanations, they assume that there\nis a non-pragmatic core to the notion of explanation, which it is the\ncentral task of a theory of explanation to capture. That is, it is\nassumed that this core notion can be specified without reference to\npsychological features of explainers or their audiences and with\nreference to non-contextual features that are sufficiently general,\nabstract and \u201cstructural,\u201d in the sense that they hold\nacross a range of explanations with different contents and across a\nrange of different contexts. Relations like deductive entailment or\nstatistical relevance are examples of candidates for such\n\u201cstructural\u201d relationships. In addition, these writers see\nthe goal of a theory of explanation, as capturing the notion of a\ncorrect explanation, as opposed to the notion of an\nexplanation\u2019s being considered explanatory by a particular\naudience or not, a matter which presumably depends on such\nconsiderations as whether the audience understands the terms in which\nthe explanation is framed. (In this sense, \u201ccorrectness\u201d\nrequires (at least) that the explanans be true or \u201cwell-confirmed\u201d and that the explanans stands in the right\nrelationship to the explanandum.) Finally, as noted in the\nIntroduction to this entry, writers in this tradition have\nnot had the goal of capturing all the various ways in which\nthe word \u201cexplanation\u201d is used in ordinary English. They\nhave instead focused on a much more restricted class of examples in\nwhich what is of interest is (something like) explaining\n\u201cwhy\u201d some outcome or general phenomenon occurred, as\nopposed to explaining, e.g., the meaning of a word or how to solve a\ndifferential equation. The motivation for this restriction is simply\nthe judgment that an interesting and non-trivial theory is more likely\nto emerge if it is restricted in scope in this way. For ease of\nreference, let us call this the \u201ctraditional\u201d conception\nof the task of a theory of explanation.\n\nSome or all of these assumptions and goals are rejected in pragmatic\naccounts of explanation. Early contributors to this approach include\nMichael Scriven (e.g., 1962) and Sylvan Bromberger (e.g., 1966), with\nmore systematic statements, due to van Fraassen (1980) and Achinstein\n(1983) appearing in the 1980s. Since it is not always clear just what\nthe points of disagreement are between pragmatic and traditional\naccounts, some orienting remarks about this will be useful before\nturning to details. Defenders of pragmatic approaches to explanation\ntypically stress the point that whether provision of a certain body of\ninformation to some audience produces understanding or is illuminating\nfor that audience depends on the background knowledge of the audience\nmembers and on other factors having to do with the local context. For\nexample, an explanation of the deflection of starlight by the sun that\nappeals to the field equations of General Relativity may be highly\nilluminating to a trained physicist but unintelligible to a layperson\nbecause of their background. Factors of this sort are grouped together\nas \u201cpragmatic\u201d and their influence is taken to illustrate\nat least one way in which pragmatic considerations enter into the\nnotion of explanation.\n\nTaken in itself, the observation just described seems completely\nuncontroversial and not in conflict with traditional approaches to\nexplanation. Indeed, as remarked above writers like Hempel and Salmon\nexplicitly agree that explanation has a pragmatic dimension in the\nsense just described\u2014in fact, Hempel invokes the role of\npragmatic factors at a number of points to address prima-facie\ncounterexamples to the DN model. This suggests that, often at least,\nwhat is distinctive about pragmatic approaches to explanation is not\njust the bare idea that explanation has a \u201cpragmatic\ndimension\u201d but rather the much stronger claim that the\ntraditional project of constructing a model of explanation pursued by\nHempel and others has so far been unsuccessful ( and perhaps is\nbound to be unsuccessful) and that this is so\nbecause pragmatic or contextual factors play a central and\nineliminable role in explanation in a way that resists incorporation\ninto models of the traditional sort. On this view, much of what is\ndistinctive about pragmatic accounts is their opposition to\ntraditional accounts and their diagnosis of why such accounts\nfail\u2014they fail because they omit pragmatic or contextual\nelements. It will be important to keep this point in mind in what\nfollows because there is a certain tendency among advocates of\npragmatic theories to argue as though the superiority of their\napproach is established simply by the observation that explanation has\na pragmatic dimension; instead it seems more appropriate to think that\nthe real issue is whether traditional approaches are inadequate in\nprinciple because of their neglect of the pragmatic dimension of\nexplanation.\n\nA second issue concerns an important ambiguity in the notion of\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d. On one natural understanding of this notion,\na pragmatic consideration is one that has to do with utility or\nusefulness in the service of some goal connected to human interests,\nwhere these interests are in some relevant sense\n\u201cpractical\u201d. Call this notion\n\u201cpragmatic1\u201d. On this construal, Hempel\u2019s\nDN model might be correctly characterized as a\npragmatic1 theory since it links explanatory information\nclosely to the provision of information that is useful for purposes of\nprediction and prediction certainly qualifies as a pragmatic goal. For\nsimilar reasons, Woodward\u2019s (2003) theory of explanation might\nalso be counted as a pragmatic1 theory since it connects\nexplanation with the provision of information that is useful for\nmanipulation and control\u2014unquestionably useful goals. As these\nexamples suggest, models of explanation that aspire to traditional\ngoals can be pragmatic1 theories.\n\nIn the context of theories of explanation, however, the label\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d is usually intended to suggest a somewhat\ndifferent set of associations. In particular, as noted above,\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d is typically used to characterize\nconsiderations having to do with facts about the psychology\n(interests, beliefs etc.) of those involved in providing or receiving\nexplanations and/or to characterize considerations involving the local\ncontext, often with the suggestion that both sets of considerations\nmay vary in complex and idiosyncratic ways that resist incorporation\ninto the sort of general theory sought by traditional\n models.[10]\n Call this set of associations \u201cpragmatic2\u201d. Neither Hempel\u2019s nor Woodward\u2019s theory is\npragmatic2. In particular, as the example of the\nDN model illustrates, the fact that a theory is\npragmatic1 in the sense that it appeals to facts about\ngoals generally shared by human beings (such as prediction) to help to\nmotivate a model of explanation does not preclude attempting\nto construct models of explanation satisfying traditional goals and\ndoes not require commitment to the idea that explanation must be\nunderstood as a pragmatic2 notion. We need to be careful to\ndistinguish these two different ways of thinking about the\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d dimension of explanation.\n\nFinally, as emphasized above, a concern with the pragmatics of\nexplanation naturally connects with an interest in the\n\u201cpsychology\u201d of explanation and this in turn suggests the\nrelevance of empirical studies of sorts of information that various\nsubjects (ordinary folks, scientists) find explanatory, treat as\nproviding \u201cunderstanding\u201d, the distinctions subjects make\namong explanations and so on. Although there is a growing literature\nin this area, the most prominent philosophical advocates of pragmatic\napproaches to explanation have so far tended not to make use of it. In\nthis connection, it is worth pointing out that this psychological\nliterature goes well beyond the truisms found in philosophical\ndiscussion about different people finding different sorts of\ninformation explanatory depending on their interests. In particular,\npsychologists have been very interested in exploring general features\nor structural patterns present in information that various subjects\nfind explanatory. For example, Lombrozo (2010) finds evidence that\nsubjects prefer explanations that appeal to relationships that are\nrelatively stable (in the sense of continuing to hold across changing\n circumstances)[11]\n and Lien and Cheng (2000) present evidence that in cases in which the\nexplanandum \\(E\\) has a single candidate cause \\(C\\),\nsubjects prefer levels of explanation/causal description that maximize\n\\(\\Delta p = \\Pr(E\\pmid C) - \\Pr(E \\pmid \\text{not-}C)\\).\n\nNotice that in both cases these are relationships or patterns of the\nsort that traditional accounts of explanation attempt to capture. As\nthese examples bring out, there is no necessary incompatibility\nbetween the project of trying to formulate an account of explanation\nthat satisfies traditional goals and an interest in the psychology of\nexplanation. It may be that subjects find certain sorts of information\nexplanatory or understanding-producing because certain\nstructural features of the sort that traditional accounts attempt to\ncharacterize are present in that information\u2014indeed this is what\nthe Lombrozo and Lien and Cheng papers suggest. Thus, we should\ndistinguish the project of investigating the empirical psychology of\nexplanation (which can be pursued with a variety of different\ncommitments about how to best theorize about explanation) from the\nmore specific claim that the characterization of what it is for an\nexplanatory relationship to hold between explanans and explanandum\nmust be given in \u201cpsychologistic\u201d terms, in the sense that\nthis requires irreducible reference to psychological facts about\nparticular audiences such as the vagaries of what they happen to be\ninterested in. \n",
