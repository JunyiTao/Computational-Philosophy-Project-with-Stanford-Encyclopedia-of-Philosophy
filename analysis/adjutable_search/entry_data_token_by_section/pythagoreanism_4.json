    "main_text": "The Most Prominent Pythagoreans of the Fifth and Fourth Century || The Pythagoreans of the Table of Opposites\n2.4 The Pythagoreans of the Table of Opposites\n\nAt Metaphysics 986a22, after presenting his account of the\nphilosophy of \u201cthe so-called\u201d Pythagoreans (985b23), which\nhas strong connections to the philosophy of Philolaus, Aristotle turns\nto \u201cothers of this same group\u201d and assigns to them what is\ncommonly known as the table of opposites (the opposites arranged\naccording to column [kata sustoichian]). These Pythagoreans\npresented the principles of reality as consisting of ten pairs of\nopposites:\n\n\nlimit\nunlimited \n\nodd\neven \n\nunity\nplurality \n\nright\nleft \n\nmale\nfemale \n\nrest\nmotion \n\nstraight\u00a0\u00a0\ncrooked \n\nlight\ndarkness \n\ngood\nbad \n\nsquare\noblong \n\n\nAristotle then contrasts these Pythagoreans with Alcmaeon of Croton,\nwho said that the majority of human things come in pairs, and praises\nthe Pythagoreans for carefully defining the pairs of opposites both in\nnumber and character, whereas Alcmaeon seemed to present a randomly\nselected and ill-defined group of opposites. Aristotle suggests that\neither Alcmaeon was influenced by these Pythagoreans or they by him.\nAristotle was thus not sure of the date of these Pythagoreans but\nseems to entertain the idea that they either lived a little before\nAlcmaeon or a little after, which would make them active anywhere from\nthe late 6th to the mid 5th century. Aristotle\u2019s manner of\nintroducing these Pythagoreans suggests that they are distinct from\nPhilolaus and his pupil Eurytus and perhaps earlier (Schofield 2012:\n156), but it is not possible to be more specific about their identity.\nIt is possible that Aristotle only knows of the table through oral\ntransmission and that there were no specific names attached to it.\n\nThe table shows a strong normative slant by including good in one\ncolumn and bad in the other. In contrast, while Philolaus posits the\nfirst two opposites in the table, limit and unlimited, as first\nprinciples, there is no suggestion in the extant fragments of\nPhilolaus that limit was good and unlimited bad. Opposites played a\nlarge role in most Presocratic philosophical systems. The Pythagoreans\nwho posited the table of opposites differed from other early Greek\nphilosophers not only in the normative view of the opposites but also\nby including strikingly abstract pairs such as straight and crooked\nand odd and even, in contrast to the more concrete opposites such as\nhot and cold, which are typical elsewhere in early Greek philosophy.\nSimilar tables of opposites appear in the Academy (Aristotle,\nMetaph. 1093b11; EN 1106b29 referring to Speusippus;\nSimplicius in CAG IX. 247. 30ff.), and Aristotle himself\nseems at times to adopt such a table (Metaph. 1004b27 ff.;\nPhys. 201b25). Later Platonists and Neopythagoreans will\ncontinue to develop these tables (see Burkert 1972a, 52, n. 119 for a\nlist). The table of opposites thus provides one of the clearest cases\nof continuity between early Pythagoreanism and Platonism. Zhmud argues\nthat the table has little to do with early Pythagoreanism and is\nlargely a product of the Academy (2012: 449\u2013452), but\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of it in connection with Alcmaeon clearly\nshows that he regarded it as belonging to the fifth-century and it is\nimplausible to suppose that he confused the work of his contemporaries\nin the Academy with Pythagorean ideas that were developed over a\ncentury earlier. It may well be that the similarity between this\nPythagorean table of opposites and later Academic versions led to the\nNeopythagorean habit, starting already in the early Academy, of\nmistakenly assigning the fundamental pair of opposites in\nPlato\u2019s late metaphysics, the one and the indefinite dyad, back\nto Pythagoras (see on Neopythagoreanism below).\n",
