Logic\n\nRoyce understood logic as the science of order focused on\n\u201cproblems regarding, not the methods by which a thinker\nsucceeds, nor yet the norms, but rather the Forms, the\nCategories, the Types of Order, which characterize\nany realm of objects\u201d (Royce 1913a, 69). In a variety of work\nbeginning with The World and The Individual (1900) continuing\nthrough the remainder of his life in published and unpublished papers,\nRoyce proposed a logical system with both formal and informal,\nphilosophical implications. He called his logic \u201cSystem\n\\(\\Sigma\\).\u201d\n",
