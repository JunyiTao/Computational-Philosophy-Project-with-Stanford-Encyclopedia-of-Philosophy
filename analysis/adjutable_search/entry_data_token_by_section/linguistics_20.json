The\ntopic was placed squarely on the agenda by Chomsky (1965); and a\nhugely influential mathematical linguistics paper by Gold (1967)has\ndominated much of the subsequent discussion.\n4.2.1 The Gold paradigm\n\nGold began by considering a reformulation of the standard\nphilosophical problem of induction. The trouble with the question\n\u2018Which hypothesis is correct given the totality of the\ndata?\u2019 is of course the one that Hume saw: if the domain is\nunbounded, no finite amount of data can answer the question. Any\nfinite body of evidence will be consistent with arbitrarily many\nhypotheses that are not consistent with each other. But Gold proposed\nreplacing the question with a very different one: Which tentative\nhypothesis is the one to pick, given the data provided so far,\nassuming a finite number of wrong guesses can be forgiven?\n\nGold assumed that the hypotheses, in the case of language learning,\nwere generative grammars (or alternatively parsers; he proves results\nconcerning both, but for brevity we follow most of the literature and\nneglect the very similar results on parsers). The learner\u2019s task\nis conceived of as responding to an unending input data stream\n(ultimately complete, in that every expression eventually turns up) by\nenunciating a sequence of guesses at grammars.\n\nAlthough Gold talks in developmental psycholinguistic terms about\nlanguage learners learning grammars by trial and error, his extremely\nabstract proofs actually make no reference to the linguistic content\nof languages or grammars at all. The set of all finite grammars\nformulable in any given metalanguage is computably enumerable, so\ngrammars can be systematically numbered. Inputs\u2014grammatical\nexpressions from the target language\u2014can also be numerically\nencoded. We end up being concerned simply with the existence or\nnon-existence of certain functions from natural number sequences to\nnatural numbers.\n\nA successful learner is one who uses a procedure that is guaranteed to\neventually hit on a correct grammar. For single languages, this is\ntrivial: if the target language is L and it is generated by a\ngrammar G, then the procedure \u201cAlways guess\nG\u201d does the job, and every language is learnable. What\nmakes the problem interesting is applying it to classes of\ngrammars. A successful learner for a class C is one who uses\na procedure that is guaranteed to succeed no matter what grammar from\nC is the target and no matter what the data stream is like\n(as long as it is complete and contains no ungrammatical\nexamples).\n\nGold\u2019s work has interesting similarities with earlier\nphilosophical work on inductive learning by Hilary Putnam (1963; it is\nnot clear whether Gold was aware of this paper). Putnam gave an\ninformal proof of a sort of incompleteness theorem for inductive\nregularity-learning devices: no matter what algorithm is used in a\nmachine for inducing regularities from experience, and thus becoming\nable to predict events, there will always be some possible\nenvironmental regularities that will defeat it. (As a simple example,\nimagine an environment giving an unbroken sequence of presentations\nall having some property a. If there is a positive integer\nn such that after n presentations the machine will\npredict that presentation number n + 1 will also have property\na, then the machine will be defeated by an environment\nconsisting of n presentations of a followed by one\nwith the incompatible property b\u2014the future need not\nalways resemble the past. But if on the other hand there is no such\nn, then an environment consisting of an unending sequence of\na presentations will defeat it.)\n\nGold\u2019s theorems are founded on certain specific idealizing\nassumptions about the language learning situation, some of which are\nintuitively very generous to the learner. The main ones are these:\n\nPre-set grammar class. A class of grammars from\namong which to select is fixed ab initio, and the learner\u2019s\nstrategy can be one that only works for that class.\nPre-set vocabulary. A finite universal vocabulary\nof elements V is fixed ab initio, and the learner can rely on\nnot encountering any other elements (though the learner does not know\nwhich subset of V is used in the target language).\nUnending input. The input (the evidence presented\nto the learner) goes on forever\u2014though it may contain arbitrary\nrepetitions, and a successful learner will always reach a point where\nno future evidence will cause a change of guess.\nExhaustive evidence. Ultimately every expression\nin the language will appear in the evidence presented to the\nlearner.\nNo noise. Every input example is a grammatical\nexpression of the target language.\nNo ordering restrictions. Any expression may\nappear at any point in the input data stream.\nNo memory limit. The learner can remember every\nexpression ever presented.\nNo time limit. Learning must be achieved after\nsome finite time, but no fixed bound is set in advance.\nGenerative grammar target. What is ultimately\nlearned is a generative grammar.\nNo statistics. Frequency of particular\nexpressions in the input plays no role in the learning process.\n\n\nThe most celebrated of the theorems Gold proved (using some reasoning\nremarkably similar to that of Putnam 1963) showed that a language\nlearner could be similarly hostage to malign environments. Imagine a\nlearner being exposed to an endless and ultimately exhaustive sequence\nof presented expressions from some target language\u2014Gold calls\nsuch a sequence a \u2018text\u2019. Suppose the learner does not\nknow in advance whether the language is infinite, or is one of the\ninfinitely many finite languages over the vocabulary V. Gold\nreasons roughly thus:\n\nThere must be some n such that an environment consisting\nof a sequence of n presented expressions all taken from a\ncertain finite language L1 (possibly with many\nrepetitions) will cause the learner to guess the target language is\nL1. (If there is not, then we already know how to\nbaffle the learner: the learner will be unable to learn\nL1 from any text.)\nBut if there is such an n, then the learner will be\nbaffled by any infinite target language that is a superset of them\nall: a text consisting of n presentations of expressions from\nL1 followed by n presentations of a\nslightly larger finite language L2, and so on\nforever (there is no largest finite language, and ex hypothesi the\nlearner will keep trying them all).\n\n\nLeaping too soon to the conclusion that the target language is\ninfinite will be disastrous, because there will be no way to retrench:\nno presented examples from a finite language\nLk will ever conflict with the hypothesis\nthat the target is some infinite superset of\nLk.\n\nThe relevance of all this to the philosophy of linguistics is that the\ntheorem just sketched has been interpreted by many linguists,\npsycholinguists, and philosophers as showing that humans could not\nlearn languages by inductive inference based on examples of language\nuse, because all of the well-known families of languages\ndefined by different types of generative grammar have the crucial\nproperty of allowing grammars for every finite language and for at\nleast some infinite supersets of them. But Gold\u2019s paper has\noften been over-interpreted. A few examples of the resultant mistakes\nfollow.\n\nIt\u2019s not about underdetermination. Gold\u2019s\nnegative results are sometimes wrongly taken to be an unsurprising\nreflection of the underdetermination of theories by finite bodies of\nevidence (Hauser et al. 2002 seem to make this erroneous equation on\np. 1577; so do Fodor and Crowther 2002, implicitly\u2014see Scholz\nand Pullum 2002, 204\u2013206). But the failure of\ntext-identifiability for certain classes of languages is different\nfrom underdetermination in a very important way, because there are\ninfinite classes of infinite languages that are identifiable\nfrom text. The first chapter of Jain et al. (1999) discusses an\nillustrative example (basically, it is the class containing, for all\nn > 0, the set of all strings with length greater than\nn). There are infinitely many others. For example, Shinohara\n(1990) showed that for any positive integer n the class of\nall languages generated by a context-sensitive grammar with not more\nthan n rules is learnable from text.\n\nIt\u2019s not about stimulus poverty. It has also\nsometimes been assumed that Gold is giving some kind of argument from\npoverty of the stimulus (there are signs of this in Cowie 1999, 194ff;\nHauser et al. 2002, 1577; and Prinz 2002, 210). This is very clearly a\nmistake (as both Laurence and Margolis 2001 and Matthews 2007 note):\nin Gold\u2019s text-learning scenario there is no stimulus poverty at\nall. Every expression in the language eventually turns up in the\nlearner\u2019s input.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news. It is sometimes\nforgotten that Gold established a number of optimistic results as well\nas the pessimistic one about learning from text. Given what he called\nan \u2018informant\u2019 environment rather than a text environment,\nwe see strikingly different results. An informant environment is an\ninfinite sequence of presentations sorted into two lists, positive\ninstances (expressions belonging to the target language) and negative\ninstances (not in the language). Almost all major language-theoretic\nclasses are identifiable in the limit from an informant environment\n(up to and including the class of all languages with a primitive\nrecursive characteristic function, which comes close to covering any\nlanguage that could conceivably be of linguistic interest), and all\ncomputably enumerable languages become learnable if texts are allowed\nto be sequenced in particular ways (see the results in Gold 1967 on\n\u2018anomalous text\u2019).\n\nGold did not give a necessary condition for a class to be identifiable\nin the limit from text, but Angluin (1980) later provided one (in a\nresult almost but not quite obtained by Wexler and Hamburger 1973).\nAngluin showed that a class C is text-identifiable iff every\nlanguage L in C has a finite \u201ctelltale\u201d\nsubset T such that if T is also proper subset of\nsome other language in C, that other language is not a proper\nsubset of L. This condition precludes guessing too large a\nlanguage. Once all the members of the telltale subset for L\nhave been received as input, the learner can safely make L\nthe current conjecture. The language to be identified must be either\nL or (if subsequent inputs include new sentences not in\nL) some larger language, but it can\u2019t be a proper\nsubset of L.\n\nJohnson (2004) provides a useful review of several other\nmisconceptions about Gold\u2019s work; e.g., the notion that it might\nbe the absence of semantics from the input that makes identification\nfrom text impossible (this is not the case).\n4.2.2 Gold\u2019s paradox\n\nSome generative Essentialists see a kind of paradox in Gold\u2019s\nresults\u2014a reductio on one or more of the assumptions he makes\nabout in-principle learnability. To put it very crudely, learning\ngenerative grammars from presented grammatical examples seems to have\nbeen proved impossible, yet children do learn their first languages,\nwhich for generative Essentialists means they internalize generative\npsychogrammars, and it is claimed to be an empirical fact that they\nget almost no explicit evidence about what is not in the\nlanguage (Brown and Hanlon 1970 is invariably cited to support this).\nContradiction. Gold himself suggested three escape routes from the\napparent paradox:\n\nAssume tighter limits on the pre-set grammar class. Perhaps, for\nexample, learners have an \u2018innate\u2019 grasp of some\ndefinition of the pre-set grammar class that guarantees its\nlearnability. (For example, identifiability in the limit from text\ncould be guaranteed by ensuring that the class of candidate languages\ndoes not contain both (a) some infinite set of finite languages and\n(b) some infinite language that is the union of all of them.)\nAssume learners get systematic information about what is\nnot in the language (perhaps indirectly, in ways not yet\nrecognized), so that the environment is of the informant type rather\nthan the text type.\nAssume some helpful feature is present in learning environments.\nThe \u2018no order restrictions\u2019 assumption might be false:\nthere could be regularities in the order of expressions in texts that\ncan support inferences about what is ungrammatical.\n\n\nAll three of these paths have been subsequently explored. Path (1)\nappealed to generative Essentialists. Chomsky (1981) suggested an\nextreme restriction: that universal grammar permitted only finitely\nmany grammars. This claim (for which Chomsky had little basis: see\nPullum 1983) would immediately guarantee that not all finite languages\nare humanly learnable (there are infinitely many finite languages, so\nfor most of them there would be no permissible grammar). Osherson and\nWeinstein (1984) even proved that under three fairly plausible\nassumptions about the conditions on learning, finiteness of the class\nof languages is necessary\u2014that is, a class must be\nfinite if it is to be identifiable from text. However, they also\nproved that this is not sufficient: there are very small finite\nclasses of languages that are not identifiable from text, so\nit is logically possible for text-identification to be impossible even\ngiven only a finite number of languages (grammars). These two results\nshow that Chomsky\u2019s approach cannot be the whole answer.\n\nPath (2) proposes investigation of children\u2019s input with an eye\nto finding covert sources of negative evidence. Various\npsycholinguists have pursued this idea; see the entry on\n language and innateness\n in this encyclopedia, and (to cite one example) the results of\nChouinard and Clark (2003) on hitherto unnoticed sources of negative\nevidence in the infant\u2019s linguistic environment, such as\nparental corrections.\n\nPath (3) suggests investigating the nature of children\u2019s\nlinguistic environments more generally. Making evidence available to\nthe learner in some fixed order can certainly alter the picture quite\nradically (Gold proved that if some primitive-recursive generator\ncontrols the text it can in effect encode the identity of the target\nlanguage so that all computably enumerable languages become\nidentifiable from text). It is possible in principle that limitations\non texts (or on learners\u2019 uptake) might have positive rather\nthan negative effects on learnability (see Newport 1988; Elman 1993;\nRohde and Plaut 1999; and the entry on\n language and innateness).\n4.2.3 The claimed link to \u2018rationalism\u2019 versus \u2018empiricism\u2019\n\nGold\u2019s suggested strategy of restricting the pre-set class of\ngrammars has been interpreted by some as a defense of rationalist\nrather than empiricist theories of language acquisition. For example,\nWexler and Culicover state:\n\nEmpiricist theory allows for a class of sensory or peripheral\nprocessing mechanisms by means of which the organism receives data. In\naddition, the organism possesses some set of inductive principles or\nlearning mechanisms\u2026Rationalist theory also assumes that a\nlearner has sensory mechanisms and inductive principles. But\nrationalist theory assumes that in addition the learner possesses a\nrich set of principles concerning the general nature of the ability\nthat is to be learned. (Wexler and Culicover 1980: 5)\n\n\nWexler and Culicover claim that \u2018empiricist\u2019 learning\nmechanisms are both weak and general: not only are they \u2018not\nrelated to the learning of any particular subject matter or cognitive\nability\u2019 but they are not \u2018limited to any particular\nspecies\u2019. It is of course not surprising that empiricist\nlearning fails if it is defined in a way that precludes drawing a\ndistinction between the cognitive abilities of humans and fruit\nflies.\n\nEquating Gold\u2019s idea of restricting the class of grammars with\nthe idea of a \u2018rationalist\u2019 knowledge acquisition theory,\nWexler and Culicover try to draw out the consequences of Gold\u2019s\nparadigm for the Essentialist linguistic theory of Chomsky (1965).\nThey show how a very tightly restricted class of transformational\ngrammars could be regarded as text-identifiable under extremely strong\nassumptions (e.g., that all languages have the same innately known\ndeep structures).\n\nMatthews (1984) follows Wexler and Culicover\u2019s lead and draws a\nmore philosophically oriented moral:\n\nThe significance of Gold\u2019s result becomes apparent if one\nconsiders that (i) empiricists assume that there are no constraints on\nthe class of possible languages (besides perhaps that natural\nlanguages be recursively enumerable), and (ii) the learner employs a\nmaximally powerful learning strategy\u2014there are no strategies\nthat could accomplish what that assumed by Gold cannot. These two\nfacts, given Gold\u2019s unsolvability result for text data,\neffectively dispose of the empiricist claim that there exists a\n\u2018discovery procedure\u2019. (1989: 60)\n\n\nThe actual relation of Gold\u2019s results to the\nempiricism/rationalism controversy seems to us rather different.\nGold\u2019s paradigm looks a lot more like a formalization of\nso-called \u2018rationalism\u2019. The fixed class of candidate\nhypotheses (grammars) corresponds to what is given by universal\ngrammar\u2014the innate definition of the essential properties of\nlanguage. What Gold actually shows, therefore, is not \u201cthe\nplausibility of rationalism\u201d but rather the inadequacy of a huge\nrange of rationalist theories: under a wide range of different choices\nof universal grammar, language acquisition appears to remain\nimpossible.\n\nMoreover, Matthews ignores (as most linguists have) the existence of\nlarge and interesting classes of languages that are\ntext-identifiable.\n\nGold\u2019s result, like Putnam\u2019s earlier one, does show that a\ncertain kind of trial-and-error inductive learning is insufficient to\npermit learning of arbitrary environmental regularities. There has to\nbe some kind of initial bias in the learning procedure or in the data.\nBut \u2018empiricism\u2019, the supposed opponent of\n\u2018rationalism\u2019, is not to be equated with a denial of the\nexistence of learning biases. No one doubts that humans have inductive\nbiases. To quote Quine again, \u201cInnate biases and dispositions\nare the cornerstone of behaviorism, and have been studied by\nbehaviorists\u201d (1972: 95\u201396). As Lappin and Shieber (2007)\nstress, there cannot be such a thing as a learning procedure (or\nprocessing mechanism) with no biases at all.\n\nThe biases posited in Emergentist theories of language acquisition are\nfound, at least in part, in the non-linguistic social and cognitive\nbases of human communication. And the biases of Externalist approaches\nto language acquisition are to be found in the distributional and\nstochastic structure of the learning input and the multitude of\nmechanisms that process that input and their interactions. All\ncontemporary approaches to language acquistion have acknowledged\nGold\u2019s results, but those results do not by themselves vindicate\nany one of our three approaches to the study of language.\n\nGold\u2019s explicit equation of acquiring a language with\nidentifying a generative grammar that exactly generates it naturally\nmakes his work seem relevant to generative Essentialists (though even\nfor them, his results do not provide anything like a sufficient reason\nfor adopting the linguistic nativist position). But another key\nassumption, that nothing about the statistical structure of the input\nplays a role in the acquisition process, is being questioned by\nincreasing numbers of Externalists, many of whom have used Bayesian\nmodeling to show that the absence of positive evidence can function as\na powerful source of (indirect) negative evidence: learning can be\ndriven by what is not found as well as by what is (see e.g. Foraker et\nal. (2009)).\n\nMost Emergentists simply reject the assumption that what is learned is\na generative grammar. They see the acquisition task as a matter of\nlearning the details of an array of constructions (roughly,\nmeaning-bearing ways of structurally composing words or phrases) and\nhow to use them to communicate. How such learning is accomplished\nneeds a great deal of further study, but Gold\u2019s paper did not\nshow it to be impossible.\n",
