Naturalistic Justifications of Simplicity\n\nThe rise of naturalized epistemology as a movement within analytic\nphilosophy in the second half of the 20th Century has\nlargely sidelined the rationalist style of approach. From the\nnaturalistic perspective, philosophy is conceived of as continuous\nwith science, and not as having some independently privileged status.\nThe perspective of the naturalistic philosopher may be broader, but\nher concerns and methods are not fundamentally different from those of\nthe scientist. The conclusion is that science neither needs\u2014nor\ncan legitimately be given\u2014external philosophical justification.\nIt is against this broadly naturalistic background that some\nphilosophers have sought to provide an epistemic justification of\nsimplicity principles, and in particular principles of ontological\nparsimony such as Occam\u2019s Razor.\n\nThe main empirical evidence bearing on this issue consists of the\npatterns of acceptance and rejection of competing theories by working\nscientists. Einstein\u2019s development of Special Relativity\u2014and its\nimpact on the hypothesis of the existence of the electromagnetic\nether\u2014is one of the episodes most often cited (by both\nphilosophers and scientists) as an example of Occam\u2019s Razor in action\n(see Sober 1981, p. 153). The ether is by hypothesis a fixed medium\nand reference frame for the propagation of light (and other\nelectromagnetic waves). The Special Theory of Relativity includes the\nradical postulate that the speed of a light ray through a vacuum is\nconstant relative to an observer no matter what the state of motion of\nthe observer. Given this assumption, the notion of a universal\nreference frame is incoherent. Hence Special Relativity implies that\nthe ether does not exist.\n\nThis episode can be viewed as the replacement of an empirically\nadequate theory (the Lorentz-Poincar\u00e9 theory) by a more\nontologically parsimonious alternative (Special Relativity). Hence it\nis often taken to be an example of Occam\u2019s Razor in action. The\nproblem with using this example as evidence for Occam\u2019s Razor is that\nSpecial Relativity (SR) has several other theoretical advantages over\nthe Lorentz-Poincar\u00e9 (LP) theory in addition to being more\nontologically parsimonious. Firstly, SR is a simpler and more unified\ntheory than LP, since in order to \u2018save the phenomena\u2019 a\nnumber of ad hoc and physically unmotivated patches had been\nadded to LP. Secondly, LP raises doubts about the physical meaning of\ndistance measurements. According to LP, a rod moving with velocity,\n\\(v\\), contracts by a factor of \\((1 - v^2 /c^2)^{1/2}\\). Thus\nonly distance measurements that are made in a frame at rest relative\nto the ether are valid without modification by a correction factor.\nHowever, LP also implies that motion relative to the ether is in\nprinciple undetectable. So how is distance to be measured? In other\nwords, the issue here is complicated by the fact that\u2014according\nto LP\u2014the ether is not just an extra piece of ontology but an\nundetectable extra piece. Given these advantages of SR over\nLP, it seems clear that the ether example is not merely a case of\nontological parsimony making up for an otherwise inferior theory.\n\nA genuine test-case for Occam\u2019s Razor must involve an ontologically\nparsimonious theory which is not clearly superior to its rivals in\nother respects. An instructive example is the following historical\nepisode from biogeography, a scientific subdiscipline which originated\ntowards the end of the 18th Century, and whose central\npurpose was to explain the geographical distribution of plant and\nanimal\n species.[12]\n In 1761, the French naturalist Buffon proposed the following law;\n\n(BL)\nAreas separated by natural barriers have distinct species.\n\n\nThere were also known exceptions to Buffon\u2019s Law, for example remote\nislands which share (so-called) \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 species\nwith continental regions a large distance away.\n\nTwo rival theories were developed to explain Buffon\u2019s Law and its\noccasional exceptions. According to the first theory, due to Darwin\nand Wallace, both facts can be explained by the combined effects of\ntwo causal mechanisms\u2014dispersal, and evolution by natural\nselection. The explanation for Buffon\u2019s Law is as follows. Species\ngradually migrate into new areas, a process which Darwin calls\n\u201cdispersal.\u201d As natural selection acts over time on the\ncontingent initial distribution of species in different areas,\ncompletely distinct species eventually evolve. The existence of\ncosmopolitan species is explained by \u201cimprobable\ndispersal,\u201d Darwin\u2019s term for dispersal across seemingly\nimpenetrable barriers by \u201coccasional means of transport\u201d\nsuch as ocean currents, winds, and floating ice. Cosmopolitan species\nare explained as the result of improbable dispersal in the relatively\nrecent past.\n\nIn the 1950\u2019s, Croizat proposed an alternative to the Darwin-Wallace\ntheory which rejects their presupposition of geographical stability.\nCroizat argues that tectonic change, not dispersal, is the principal\ncausal mechanism which underlies Buffon\u2019s Law. Forces such as\ncontinental drift, the submerging of ocean floors, and the formation\nof mountain ranges have acted within the time frame of evolutionary\nhistory to create natural barriers between species where at previous\ntimes there were none. Croizat\u2019s theory was the sophisticated\nculmination of a theoretical tradition which stretched back to the\nlate 17th Century. Followers of this so-called\n\u201cextensionist\u201d tradition had postulated the existence of\nancient land bridges to account for anomalies in the geographical\ndistribution of plants and\n animals.[13]\n\nExtensionist theories are clearly less ontologically parsimonious than\nDispersal Theories, since the former are committed to extra entities\nsuch as land bridges or movable tectonic plates. Moreover,\nExtensionist theories were (given the evidence then available) not\nmanifestly superior in other respects. Darwin was an early critic of\nExtensionist theories, arguing that they went beyond the\n\u201clegitimate deductions of science.\u201d Another critic of\nExtensionist theories pointed to their \u201cdependence on ad hoc\nhypotheses, such as land bridges and continental extensions of vast\nextent, to meet each new distributional anomaly\u201d (Fichman 1977,\np. 62) The debate over the more parsimonious Dispersal theories\ncentered on whether the mechanism of dispersal is sufficient on its\nown to explain the known facts about species distribution, without\npostulating any extra geographical or tectonic entities.\n\nThe criticisms leveled at the Extensionist and Dispersal theories\nfollow a pattern that is characteristic of situations in which one\ntheory is more ontologically parsimonious than its rivals. In such\nsituations the debate is typically over whether the extra ontology is\nreally necessary in order to explain the observed phenomena. The less\nparsimonious theories are condemned for profligacy, and lack of direct\nevidential support. The more parsimonious theories are condemned for\ntheir inadequacy to explain the observed facts. This illustrates a\nrecurring theme in discussions of simplicity\u2014both inside and\noutside philosophy\u2014namely, how the correct balance between\nsimplicity and goodness of fit ought to be struck. This theme takes\ncenter stage in the statistical approaches to simplicity discussed in\nSection 5.\n\nLess work has been done on describing episodes in science where\nelegance\u2014as opposed to parsimony\u2014has been (or may have\nbeen) the crucial factor. This may just reflect the fact that\nconsiderations linked to elegance are so pervasive in scientific\ntheory choice as to be unremarkable as a topic for special study. A\nnotable exception to this general neglect is the area of celestial\nmechanics, where the transition from Ptolemy to Copernicus to Kepler\nto Newton is an oft-cited example of simplicity considerations in\naction, and a case study which makes much more sense when seen through\nthe lens of elegance rather than of\n parsimony.[14]\n\nNaturalism depends on a number of presuppositions which are open to\ndebate. But even if these presuppositions are granted, the\nnaturalistic project of looking to science for methodological guidance\nwithin philosophy faces a major difficulty, namely how to \u2018read\noff\u2019 from actual scientific practice what the underlying\nmethodological principles are supposed to be. Burgess, for example,\nargues that what the patterns of scientific behavior show is not a\nconcern with multiplying entities per se, but a concern more\nspecifically with multiplying \u2018causal mechanisms\u2019 (Burgess\n1998). And Sober considers the debate in psychology over psychological\negoism versus motivational pluralism, arguing that the former theory\npostulates fewer types of ultimate desire but a larger number of\ncausal beliefs, and hence that comparing the parsimony of these two\ntheories depends on what is counted and how (Sober 2001, pp.\n14\u20135). Some of the concerns raised in Sections 1 and 2 also\nreappear in this context; for example, how the world is sliced up into\nkinds effects the extent to which a given theory\n\u2018multiplies\u2019 kinds of entity. Justifying a particular way\nof slicing becomes more difficult once the epistemological naturalist\nleaves behind the a priori, metaphysical presuppositions of\nthe rationalist approach.\n\nOne philosophical debate where these worries over naturalism become\nparticularly acute is the issue of the application of parsimony\nprinciples to abstract objects. The scientific data\nis\u2014in an important sense\u2014ambiguous. Applications of\nOccam\u2019s Razor in science are always to concrete, causally efficacious\nentities, whether land-bridges, unicorns, or the luminiferous ether.\nPerhaps scientists apply an unrestricted version of Occam\u2019s Razor to\nthat portion of reality in which they are interested, namely the\nconcrete, causal, spatiotemporal world. Or perhaps scientists apply a\n\u2018concretized\u2019 version of Occam\u2019s Razor unrestrictedly.\nWhich is the case? The answer determines which general philosophical\nprinciple we end up with: ought we to avoid the multiplication of\nobjects of whatever kind, or merely the multiplication of concrete\nobjects? The distinction here is crucial for a number of central\nphilosophical debates. Unrestricted Occam\u2019s Razor favors monism over\ndualism, and nominalism over platonism. By contrast,\n\u2018concretized\u2019 Occam\u2019s Razor has no bearing on these\ndebates, since the extra entities in each case are not concrete.\n",
