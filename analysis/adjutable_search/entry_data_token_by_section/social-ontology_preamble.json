    "main_text": "\n\nSocial ontology is the study of the nature and properties of the\nsocial world. It is concerned with analyzing the various entities in\nthe world that arise from social interaction.\n\nA prominent topic in social ontology is the analysis of social groups.\nDo social groups exist at all? If so, what sorts of entities are they,\nand how are they created? Is a social group distinct from the\ncollection of people who are its members, and if so, how is it\ndifferent? What sorts of properties do social groups have? Can they\nhave beliefs or intentions? Can they perform actions? And if so, what\ndoes it take for a group to believe, intend, or act?\n\nOther entities investigated in social ontology include money,\ncorporations, institutions, property, social classes, races, genders,\nartifacts, artworks, language, and law. It is difficult to delineate a\nprecise scope for the field (see\n section 2.1).\n In general, though, the entities explored in social ontology largely\noverlap with those that social scientists work on. A good deal of the\nwork in social ontology takes place within the social sciences (see\n sections 5.1\u20135.8).\n\nSocial ontology also addresses more basic questions about the nature\nof the social world. One set of questions pertains to the\nconstituents, or building blocks, of social things in general. For\ninstance, some theories argue that social entities are built out of\nthe psychological states of individual people, while others argue that\nthey are built out of actions, and yet others that they are built out\nof practices. Still other theories deny that a distinction can even be\nmade between the social and the non-social.\n\nA different set of questions pertains to how social categories are\nconstructed or set up. Are social categories and kinds produced by our\nattitudes? By our language? Are they produced by causal patterns? And\nis there just one way social categories are set up, or are there many\nvarieties of social construction?\n\nThe term \u2018social ontology\u2019 has only come into wide\ncurrency in recent years, but the nature of the social has been a\ntopic of inquiry since ancient Greece. As a whole, the field can be\nunderstood as a branch of metaphysics, the general inquiry into the\nnature of entities.\n",
