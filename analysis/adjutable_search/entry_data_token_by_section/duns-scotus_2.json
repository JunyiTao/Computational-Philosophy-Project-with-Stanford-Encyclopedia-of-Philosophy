    "main_text": "Natural Theology || Some methodological preliminaries\n2.1 Some methodological preliminaries\n\nNatural theology is, roughly, the effort to establish the existence\nand nature of God by arguments that in no way depend on the contents\nof a purported revelation. But is it even possible for human\nbeings to come to know God apart from revelation? Scotus certainly\nthinks so. Like any good Aristotelian, he thinks all our knowledge\nbegins in some way with our experience of sensible things. But he is\nconfident that even from such humble beginnings we can come to grasp\nGod.\n\nScotus agrees with Thomas Aquinas that all our knowledge of God starts\nfrom creatures, and that as a result we can only prove the existence\nand nature of God by what the medievals call an argument quia\n(reasoning from effect to cause), not by an argument propter\nquid (reasoning from essence to characteristic). Aquinas and\nScotus further agree that, for that same reason, we cannot know the\nessence of God in this life. The main difference between the two\nauthors is that Scotus believes we can apply certain predicates\nunivocally\u2014with exactly the same meaning\u2014to God and\ncreatures, whereas Aquinas insists that this is impossible, and that\nwe can only use analogical predication, in which a word as applied to\nGod has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of\nthat same word as applied to creatures. (See\n medieval theories of analogy\n for details.)\n\nScotus has a number of arguments for univocal predication and against\nthe doctrine of analogy (Ordinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q.\n1\u20132, nn. 26\u201355). One of the most compelling uses\nAquinas\u2019s own view against him. Aquinas had said that all our\nconcepts come from creatures. Scotus says, very well, where will that\nanalogous concept come from? It can\u2019t come from anywhere. If all\nour concepts come from creatures (and Scotus doesn\u2019t deny this),\nthen the concepts we apply to God will also come from creatures. They\nwon\u2019t just be like the concepts that come from\ncreatures, as in analogous predication; they will have to be the\nvery same concepts that come from creatures, as in univocal\npredication. Those are the only concepts we can have\u2014the only\nconcepts we can possibly get. So if we can\u2019t use the concepts we\nget from creatures, we can\u2019t use any concepts at all, and so we\ncan\u2019t talk about God\u2014which is false.\n\nAnother argument for univocal predication is based on an argument from\nAnselm. Consider all predicates, Anselm says. Now get rid of the ones\nthat are merely relatives, since no relative expresses the nature of a\nthing as it is in itself. (So we\u2019re not talking about such\npredicates as \u201csupreme being\u201d or \u201cCreator,\u201d\nsince even though those properly apply to God, they don\u2019t tell\nus anything about what God is in himself, only about how he is related\nto other things.) Now take the predicates that are left. Here\u2019s\nthe test. Let F be our predicate-variable. For any\nF, either\n\n(a) It is in every respect better to be F than not to be\nF.\n\n~or~\n\n(b) It is in some respect better to be not-F than\nF.\n\nA predicate will fall into the second category if and only if it\nimplies some sort of limitation or deficiency. Anselm\u2019s argument\nis that we can (indeed must) predicate of God every predicate that\nfalls into the first category, and that we cannot predicate of God any\npredicate that falls into the second (except metaphorically, perhaps).\nScotus agrees with Anselm on this point (as did Aquinas: see\nSCG I.30). Scotus has his own terminology for whatever it is\nin every respect better to be than not to be. He calls such things\n\u201cpure perfections\u201d (perfectiones simpliciter). A\npure perfection is any predicate that does not imply limitation.\n\nSo Scotus claims that pure perfections can be predicated of God. But\nhe takes this a step further than Anselm. He says that they have to be\npredicated univocally of God; otherwise the whole business of\npure perfections won\u2019t make any sense. Here\u2019s the\nargument. If we are going to use Anselm\u2019s test, we must first\ncome up with our concept\u2014say, of good. Then we check out the\nconcept to see whether it is in every respect better to be good than\nnot-good. We realize that it is, and so we predicate\n\u2018good\u2019 of God. That test obviously won\u2019t work unless\nit\u2019s the same concept that we\u2019re applying in both\ncases.\n\nOne can see this more clearly by considering the two possible ways in\nwhich one might deny that the same concept is applied to both God and\ncreatures. One might say that the concept of the pure perfection\napplies only to creatures, and the concept we apply to God has to be\nsomething different; or one might try it the other way around and say\nthat the concept of the pure perfection applies only to God, and the\nconcept we apply to creatures has to be something different. Take the\nfirst possibility. If we come up with the idea of a pure perfection\nfrom creatures and don\u2019t apply the same concept to God,\nwe\u2019re saying that we can come up with something that is in every\nrespect better to be than not to be, but it doesn\u2019t apply to\nGod. Such a view would destroy the idea that God is the greatest and\nmost perfect being. So then one might try the second possibility: the\nconcept of the pure perfection really applies only to God. Scotus\npoints out that that can\u2019t be right either. For then the\nperfection we apply to creatures won\u2019t be the pure perfection\nany more, and so the creature wouldn\u2019t be better off for having\nthis pseudo-perfection. But the whole way in which we came up with the\nidea of the pure perfection in the first place was by considering\nperfections in creatures\u2014in other words, by considering what\nfeatures made creatures better in every respect. So this possibility\ngets the test backwards: it says that we have to start with knowing\nwhat features God has and thereby determining what is a pure\nperfection, but in fact we first figure out what the pure perfections\nare and thereby know what features God has.\n\nNot only can we come up with concepts that apply univocally to God and\ncreatures, we can even come up with a proper (distinctive)\nconcept of God. Now in one sense we can\u2019t have a proper concept\nof God in this life, since we can\u2019t know his essence as a\nparticular thing. We know God in the way that we know, say, a person\nwe have heard about but have never met. That is, we know him through\ngeneral concepts that can apply both to him and to other things. In\nanother sense, though, we can have a proper concept of God, that is,\none that applies only to God. If we take any of the pure perfections\nto the highest degree, they will be predicable of God alone. Better\nyet, we can describe God more completely by taking all the pure\nperfections in the highest degree and attributing them all to him.\n\nBut these are all composite concepts; they all involve putting two\nquite different notions together: \u2018highest\u2019 with\n\u2018good\u2019, \u2018first\u2019 with \u2018cause\u2019, and\nso on. Scotus says that we can come up with a relatively\nsimple concept that is proper to God alone, the concept of\n\u201cinfinite being.\u201d Now that concept might seem to be every\nbit as composite as \u201chighest good\u201d or \u201cfirst\ncause,\u201d but it\u2019s really not. For \u201cinfinite\nbeing\u201d is a concept of something essentially one: a being that\nhas infinity (unlimitedness) as its intrinsic way of existing. I will\nreturn to the crucial role of the concept of infinite being in\nScotus\u2019s natural theology after I examine his proof of the\nexistence of God.\n",
