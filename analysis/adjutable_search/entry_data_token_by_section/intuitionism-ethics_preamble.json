    "main_text": "\n\n\nEthical Intuitionism was one of the dominant forces in British moral\nphilosophy from the early 18th century till the 1930s. It\nfell into disrepute in the 1940s, but towards the end of the twentieth\ncentury Ethical Intuitionism began to re-emerge as a respectable moral\ntheory. It has not regained the dominance it once enjoyed, but many\nphilosophers, including Robert Audi, Jonathan Dancy, David Enoch,\nMichael Huemer, David McNaughton, and Russ Shafer-Landau, are now\nhappy to be labelled intuitionists.\n\n\nThe most distinctive features of ethical intuitionism are its\nepistemology and ontology. All classical intuitionists maintain that\n basic moral propositions are\n self-evident,[1]\n and that moral properties are non-natural\nproperties. So the discussion of intuitionism will focus on just these\ntwo features. Some philosophers claim that ethical pluralism (the view\nthat there is an irreducible plurality of basic moral principles, and\nthat there is no strict priority of any one principle over another) is\nan essential feature of intuitionist thought, but not all intuitionists\nare pluralists, e.g., Sidgwick and Moore, so this feature will not be\ndiscussed here.\n",
