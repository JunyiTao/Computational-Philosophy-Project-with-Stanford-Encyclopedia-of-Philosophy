    "main_text": "Epistemic and Metaphysical Modality || Monism\n1.3 Monism\n\nAs mentioned above, monists explain the data described by Kripke by\nholding that the sentences that figure in Kripke\u2019s examples are\nassociated with two different propositions, one that is necessary and\nanother that is contingent. This view comes in two main versions.\nAccording to the first version, both propositions are semantically\nexpressed by the sentence. Proponents of this account need to\nformulate a semantic theory that explains how that is possible.\nAccording to the second version, only one of these propositions is\nsemantically expressed by the sentence, while the other is the\nproposition that is communicated by a typical assertoric use of the\nsentence. A philosopher holding this view needs to explain the\npragmatic mechanism by which an utterance of the sentence comes to\ncommunicate the second proposition.\n\nThe first version of monism has been developed by David Chalmers and\nFrank Jackson (Chalmers 1996, 1999, 2002a,b, 2004, 2006a,b; Chalmers\nand Jackson 2001; Jackson 1998, 2004, 2011), who build on earlier work\nby David Kaplan (1989a,b), Gareth Evans (1979) and Martin Davies and\nLloyd Humberstone (1980), and others. On Chalmers\u2019s and\nJackson\u2019s view, what explains the phenomena uncovered by Kripke\nis not a difference between two spaces of possible worlds. There is\nonly a single space of possible worlds: the metaphysically possible\nworlds\u2014the ways the world could have been\u2014just are the\nepistemically possible worlds: the ways the world might be for all we\ncan know independently of empirical evidence. What explains the data\nis a difference between two different ways in which sentences can be\nused to describe the worlds in that space, i.e., between two\ndifferent notions of a sentence\u2019s being true in a world. The\ndistinction can be illustrated by appeal to our example of the proper\nname \u2018Phosphorus.\u2019 Suppose that we have just introduced\nthis name by using the description \u2018the last celestial body\nvisible in the morning\u2019 to fix its reference. Consider a\npossible world \\(w\\) where the description singles out, not Venus (as\nin our world), but Saturn. Assume further that in \\(w\\) (as in the\nactual world), Venus is the second planet from the sun, but Saturn is\nnot. Consider:\n\n(5)\n Phosphorus is the second planet from the sun.\n\n\nIs (5) true in \\(w\\)? There are two different ways of understanding\nthis question. On the one hand, it could mean something roughly like\nthis: if \\(w\\) actually obtains (contrary to what astronomers tell\nus), is Phosphorus the second planet from the sun? The answer to that\nquestion is surely \u2018no.\u2019 \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 refers\nto whatever is actually the last celestial body visible in the\nmorning, and on the assumption that \\(w\\) actually obtains, that\nobject is Saturn, and is therefore not the second planet. As Chalmers\nwould put it, (5) is not true at w considered as\n actual.[5]\n But we can also interpret the question differently: if \\(w\\)\nhad obtained, then would Phosphorus have been the\nsecond planet? In considering that question, we are not hypothetically\nassuming that the object that actually satisfies the reference-fixing\ndescription is Saturn. Instead, we can draw freely on our belief that\nthe object actually fitting the description is Venus, so that the name\npicks out Venus in all possible worlds. Since Venus is the second\nplanet in \\(w\\), it is true to say: if \\(w\\) had obtained, then\nPhosphorus would have been the second planet. In Chalmers\u2019s\nterminology, (5) is true at w considered as\ncounterfactual.\n\nThe distinction between the two concepts of truth in a world can be\nexplained within a theoretical framework known as two-dimensional\nsemantics, which assigns to a sentence like (5) an intension that\nis a function, not from worlds to truth-values, but from\npairs of worlds to truth-values. The intension of (5) is the\nfunction that assigns the true to a pair of worlds \\(\\langle u; w\n\\rangle\\) just in case the object that is the last celestial body\nvisible in the morning in \\(u\\) is the second planet in\n \\(w\\).[6]\n This account makes it easy to define the two notions of truth in a\nworld. A sentence \\(P\\) is true in \\(w\\) considered as actual just in\ncase the two-dimensional function assigns the true to \\(\\langle w;\nw\\rangle\\). \\(P\\) is true in \\(w\\) considered as counterfactual just\nin case, where \\(u\\) is the actual world, the two-dimensional function\nassigns the true to \\(\\langle u; w\\rangle\\). Note that the\ntwo-dimensional intension of (5) determines whether (5) is true at a\nworld \\(w\\) considered as actual. But it does not in general determine\nwhether (5) is true at \\(w\\) considered as counterfactual. That also\ndepends on which world is actual. Knowledge of a sentence\u2019s\ntwo-dimensional intension is therefore not in general sufficient to\nknow whether the sentence is true at \\(w\\) considered as\ncounterfactual. Further empirical evidence may be required.\n\nWhen combined with the conception of a sentence\u2019s content as the\nset of worlds where it is true, the distinction between the two\nconcepts of truth in a world yields a distinction between two\ndifferent propositions expressed by a sentence. The first of these\npropositions is the function that assigns the true to a world \\(w\\)\njust in case the sentence is true in \\(w\\) considered as actual, while\nthe second proposition is the function that assigns the true to a\nworld \\(w\\) just in case the sentence is true in \\(w\\) considered as\ncounterfactual. Jackson calls the former proposition the\nsentence\u2019s \u2018A-intension\u2019 (for \u2018actual\u2019)\nand the latter its \u2018C-intension\u2019 (for\n\u2018counterfactual\u2019), while Chalmers calls the former the\n\u2018primary intension\u2019 and the latter the \u2018secondary\nintension.\u2019 The distinction between the two propositions\nexpressed by a sentence yields a distinction between two notions of\nsentential necessity: primary necessity, which applies to sentences\nwith necessary primary intensions, and secondary necessity, which\napplies to sentences with necessary secondary intensions. If a\nsentence has primary necessity, then that fact, and a\nfortiori the fact that the sentence is true, can be read off its\ntwo-dimensional intension. Therefore, if we know the two-dimensional\nintension, then that is enough to know that the sentence is true. No\nfurther empirical evidence is required. That motivates the thought\nthat the notion of primary necessity captures the idea of a prioricity\nor epistemic necessity. The notion of secondary necessity, on the\nother hand, may be taken to capture the Kripkean idea of metaphysical\nnecessity.\n\nThis account makes it straightforward to explain cases of a\nposteriori necessity: they are simply cases of sentences whose\nsecondary intensions are necessary, but whose primary intensions are\ncontingent. Suppose that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 were introduced, respectively, by the\nreference-fixing descriptions \u2018the first celestial body visible\nin the evening (if it exists)\u2019 and \u2018the last celestial\nbody visible in the morning (if it exists).\u2019 Since the two\ndescriptions single out the same object in the actual world, the\nsentence \u2018If Hesperus exists, then Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019\nis true in all worlds considered as counterfactual, and therefore has\na necessary secondary intension. However, in some non-actual worlds,\nthe two descriptions single out different objects. The sentence is\nfalse in such a world considered as actual. The primary intension of\nthe sentence is therefore contingent.\n\nAn analogous account can be given of Kripke\u2019s examples of the\ncontingent a priori: these concern sentences whose primary\nintensions are necessary and whose secondary intensions are\ncontingent. Assume again that the reference of \u2018Julius\u2019 is\nfixed by the description \u2018the inventor of the zip (if such a\nperson exists).\u2019 Then in every world considered as actual, the\nname singles out the person who is the inventor of the zip in that\nworld (if there is such a person) or nothing (if no such person exists\nin the world). The primary intension of (4) is necessary. However,\nwhen we evaluate (4) in a world \\(w\\) considered as counterfactual,\n\u2018Julius\u2019 picks out the individual who is the\nactual inventor of the zip (provided that there actually is\nsuch an individual and that he or she exists in \\(w)\\). And since\nthere are possible worlds where that individual exists but is not the\ninventor of the zip, the secondary intension of (4) is contingent.\n\nChalmers (2002a, 2010) and Jackson (1998) have tried to support their\nmodal monism by arguing that it is gratuitous to postulate two forms\nof modality, given that all the phenomena pointed out by Kripke can be\naccommodated by appeal to a single kind of modality. Dualists may\nreply that the greater simplicity in the view of modality has been\nachieved only by adding complexity to the semantic theory. That\nresponse could be answered by arguing that two-dimensional semantics\ncan be motivated by independent considerations. That, of course, is\ncontroversial, as is the general viability of two-dimensional\nsemantics (see the entry\n two-dimensional semantics\n for detailed discussion).\n\nIn addition, it is not obvious that the view of Chalmers and Jackson\ncan satisfactorily explain all the phenomena discussed in\n section 1.1.\n Some commentators have denied that it can give a viable general\naccount of Kripkean examples (see, e.g., Soames 2005; Vaidya 2008;\nRoca-Royes 2011). In any case, it is clear that the view can only\nexplain how necessity and epistemic necessity can come apart for\nsentences whose primary and secondary intensions differ. That may be\ntrue of the cases considered by Kripke, but it seems doubtful for the\nother examples considered in\n section 1.1\n (mathematical and metaphysical truths, laws, and principles\nconnecting the physical to the mental). In response, Chalmers has\nargued that none of the latter cases are genuine examples of the\nnecessary a posteriori (1999, 2002a).\n\nThe second version of monism allows us to accommodate the\nphenomena considered in\n section 1.1\n while staying much closer to the picture sketched in the introduction\nto\n section 1.\n On this view, the data can be explained by appeal to a single space\nof possible worlds and a single notion of truth in a world. The\nproposition semantically expressed by a sentence containing a proper\nname or natural-kind term is a function from individual worlds to\ntruth-values. The proposition expressed by \u2018Phosphorus\nexists,\u2019 e.g., is a function that assigns the true to those\nworlds where Venus exists and the false to the other worlds. (If the\nreference of \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 was determined by a\nreference-fixing description together with the facts about which\nentity meets the description, then that fact itself is not a\nsemantic fact, but a metasemantic one, i.e., it does\nnot concern the question of what the meaning of the word is, but the\nquestion of how the meaning of the word is determined.) What explains\nthe impression that a sentence like (1) expresses an a\nposteriori claim is the fact that the proposition asserted by a\ntypical utterance of the sentence is not the one that is semantically\nexpressed by it, but a different proposition that is contingent and\ncan only be known empirically.\n\nRobert Stalnaker (1978, 2001) has given a detailed account of the\npragmatic mechanism by which a contingent proposition comes to be\nasserted by the utterance of a sentence that semantically expresses a\nnecessary proposition. On his account, linguistic communication\nevolves in a context characterized by background assumptions that are\nshared between the participants. These assumptions can be represented\nby the set of worlds at which they are jointly true, which Stalnaker\ncalls the \u2018context set.\u2019 The point of assertion is to add\nthe proposition asserted to the set of background assumptions and\nthereby eliminate worlds where it is not true from the context set. To\nachieve this, every assertion needs to conform to the rule that the\nproposition asserted is false in some of the worlds that were in the\ncontext set before the utterance (otherwise there are no worlds to\neliminate) and true in others (since the audience cannot eliminate all\nworlds from the context set). Now consider a context where the shared\nbackground assumptions include the proposition that the references of\n\u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 were fixed by certain\ndescriptions but leave open whether the two descriptions single out\nthe same object. Suppose that someone says \u2018\\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\).\u2019 In every world in the context set, the sentence\nsemantically expresses either a necessary truth (if the two\ndescriptions single out the same object in the world) or a necessary\nfalsehood (if they don\u2019t). If the proposition that the speaker\nintends to assert were the one that is semantically expressed by the\nsentence, the aforementioned rule would be\n violated.[7]\n To avoid attributing this rule violation to the speaker, the audience\nwill construe the utterance as expressing a different proposition, and\nthe most natural candidate is the proposition that the sentence\nuttered semantically expresses a true proposition. (Stalnaker calls\nthis the \u2018diagonal proposition.\u2019) By exploiting this\nmechanism of reinterpretation, a speaker can use the sentence to\nexpress the diagonal proposition. This proposition is true in just\nthose worlds in the context set where the two descriptions single out\nthe same object. It is clearly a contingent proposition, and empirical\nevidence is required to know it. Stalnaker suggests an analogous\nexplanation of Kripke\u2019s proposed cases of contingent a\npriori truth (1978, 83f.).\n\nStalnaker\u2019s account of the necessary a posteriori\nrequires that the proposition semantically expressed by the sentence\nand the proposition that the sentence semantically expresses a truth\nhold in different worlds in the context set. And that seems to require\nthat the assumptions shared between the participants of the\nconversation don\u2019t determine what proposition is semantically\nexpressed by the sentence. It has been argued that that assumption is\nimplausible in some cases of Kripkean a posteriori\nnecessities (Soames 2005, 96\u2013105). Suppose that I point to the\ndesk in my office in broad daylight and say \u2018That desk (if it\nexists) is made of wood.\u2019 Unless the context is highly unusual,\nthe shared assumptions, so the argument goes, uniquely determine what\nproposition is expressed by the sentence.\n",
