    "main_text": "Perfectionism in Politics || Respecting Persons\n3.2 Respecting Persons\n\n\nStill, the principle of state neutrality, on its common\nformulations, remains an anti-perfectionist principle\u2014one with\nwide, if not completely unrestricted, scope. Its proponents\nseldom present it as a foundational normative commitment,\nhowever. As mentioned above, state neutrality is often defended\nas an appropriate response to the fact that reasonable people in modern\nsocieties disagree in good faith over the nature of the good and/or the\ngood life for human beings. But how exactly would state\nneutrality constitute an appropriate response to this purported\nfact?\n\n\nA popular answer appeals to a moral norm of respect for persons,\nwhere persons are understood as rational agents. The distinctive\nfeature of persons is \u201cthat they are beings capable of thinking\nand acting on the basis of reasons\u201d (Larmore 1996,\n137). To respect another person one must engage his capacity to\nrespond to reasons. In politics to respect another person is\n\u201cto insist that coercive or political principles be as\njustifiable to that person as they are to us\u201d (Larmore 1990,\n137). The mutual justification of political principles, it is then\nargued, is possible only if all citizens bracket their controversial\nviews about the good and seek to argue from common ground. Note\nthat this way of grounding state neutrality explains why the principle,\non its second and third formulations, does not rule out state promotion\nof shared or uncontroversial conceptions of the good. Since a\nshared conception of the good could figure in common ground\njustifications for political principles, its promotion need not express\ndisrespect to any citizen. State neutrality thus applies only to\ndisputed conceptions of the good.\n\n\nSuppose now that a modern state favors a disputed ideal of the\ngood. We need to explain why this action would be disrespectful\nto some of its citizens. The state might favor an unworthy ideal;\nbut if so, then its action would not be justified on perfectionist\ngrounds. So we must assume that it favors a sound ideal. On\nthis assumption, how would its action express disrespect to those whose\nviews were disfavored? Proponents of state neutrality point out\nthat people can have mistaken views, even while being appropriately\nreasonable. (This possibility is often explained by reference to\nwhat Rawls termed \u201cthe burdens of judgment.\u201d) They\nthen insist that if someone is appropriately reasonable, then his views\nabout the good should not be denigrated by the\n state.[12]\n\n\nThis argument immediately invites two questions. First, what\nis the connection between respecting a person\u2019s appropriately\nreasonable views about the good and respecting her? Second, how\nshould we construe the phrase appropriately reasonable\u2014that is,\nhow reasonable is appropriately reasonable? The first question is\npressing, since the argument, as it stands, appears to confuse respect\nfor persons with respect for the views that they currently endorse.\nPeople, after all, are not stuck with the conception of the good\nthat they affirm. As rational agents, they can revise their views\nin response to evidence, argument and reflection (Raz\n1998). If this is correct, then, so long as the state respects\ntheir capacities as rational agents, it is unclear why it must also\nrespect their mistaken, albeit reasonably affirmed, views.\n\n\nProponents of state neutrality can respond that there is an intimate\nconnection between the views about the good that a person affirms after\nreasonable examination and his social identity. By disrespecting\nthe former, the state disrespects the latter. As one writer\nexplains:\n\nOf course it remains the case that respect is for persons, not for\ntheir doctrines. But these doctrines are so deeply a part of\npeople\u2019s search for the meaning of life that public governmental\ndenigration of those doctrines puts those people at a disadvantage,\nsuggesting that they are less worthy than other citizens, and, in\neffect, not treating them as fully equal ends in themselves. (Nussbaum\n2011, 22)\n\n\nIn considering these claims it is important to keep in mind that we\nare assuming that the state is favoring a sound ideal of the good over\na misguided or false ideal. If we assume further that persons\nwith mistaken views about the good are not rationally sealed off from\ntrue beliefs about the good, then we can hold that the state in\nfavoring the sound ideal is, among other things, attempting to engage\nthe rational powers of its citizens. This will be true, at least,\nif state officials justify their favoritism toward the ideal by\nappealing to the reasons that establish its soundness. By doing\nso, state officials arguably would show respect for all citizens\nunderstood as rational agents (Galston 1991, 109).\n\n\nWe have arrived at two contrasting understandings of the norm of\nrespect for persons. For lack of better terms, let us call them\nRespect (1) and Respect (2).\n\n\nRespect (1): Respect for persons, understood as rational\nagents, requires the state to respect the rational powers of its\ncitizens, including their capacities to examine and revise their\nconception of the good. It also requires the state to justify its\nsupport for sound or true conceptions of the good by presenting valid\nreasons to its citizens for doing what it is doing.\n\nRespect (2): Respect for persons, understood as rational\nagents, requires the state to respect the doctrines that its citizens\naffirm, including their conceptions of the good, whether sound or not,\nprovided that these doctrines are (i) the product of the appropriately\nreasonable exercise of their rational powers and (ii) bound up with\ntheir sense of identity.\n\n\n\nNaturally, if Respect (1) is the favored view, then an appeal to the\nnorm of respect for persons will not ground the principle of state\nneutrality, at least on its common formulations. By contrast, if\nRespect (2) is the favored view, then it may provide a good measure of\nsupport for the principle. The type and degree of support that it\nprovides, however, will depend on how clauses (i) and (ii) get\nspecified.\n\n\nConsider clause (ii) first. It suggests that a person\u2019s\nbeliefs about the good can be bound up with her sense of\nidentity. We might call these identity-constituting\ncommitments. Other beliefs about the good may not be central\nto a person\u2019s identity, call them peripheral\ncommitments. The distinction is not sharp, and a commitment\nthat is peripheral for one person may be identity-constituting for\nanother. Still, while fluid, the distinction does seem to mark\nsomething important. Certain commitments are very tightly bound\nup with a person\u2019s sense of who he is, while others are\nnot. The present modest point is that, given Respect (2), respect\nfor persons requires the state to respond in the right way to its\ncitizens\u2019 identity constituting commitments. It does not\nspeak to the issue of how the state should respond to their peripheral\ncommitments. Thus an appeal to Respect (2) would not explain why\nstate action that favors disputed conceptions of the good that do not\nimpugn the identity-constituting commitments of any of its citizens\nwould be impermissible.\n\n\nNext consider clause (i), which is of greater importance and brings\nus to the question of how to construe the phrase \u201cappropriately\nreasonable\u201d in the statement of the respect for persons\nnorm. Respect for persons, on Respect (2), requires the state to\nrespect the conceptions of the good of its citizens provided that these\nconceptions are the products of the appropriately reasonable exercise\nof their rational powers. The standards of appropriate exercise\ncan be set high or low. Consider the\n following.[13]\n\n\n\nFully Reasonable: a conception of the good is appropriately reasonable\nso long as \u201cits adherents are stably disposed to affirm it as\nthey acquire new information and subject it to critical\nreflection\u201d (Cohen 2009, 52). Adherents of such a conception\napportion their beliefs to their evidence, are alert and attentive to\nnew evidence, and appropriately update their beliefs as new evidence\nbecomes available.\n\n\nModerately Reasonable: a conception of the good is appropriately\nreasonable so long as its adherents are stably disposed to affirm it,\ngiven the evidence that they have, and given that they satisfy minimal\nstandards of coherence and consistency. Adherents of such a conception\nupdate their beliefs as they become aware of new evidence.\n\n\nMinimally Reasonable: a conception of the good is appropriately\nreasonable so long as it is the product of a person\u2019s efforts to find\nmeaning or value in life. (Nussbaum 2011)\n\n\n\nThe first of these specifications is demanding, especially if the\nstandards of critical reflection are themselves demanding. Many\nconceptions of the good affirmed by people in modern societies will not\nqualify as appropriately reasonable under it. The second\nspecification lowers the standards, but it too is inconsistent with a\nrange of conceptions of the good that flout simple demands of\nconsistency and are not responsive to evidence, such as those oriented\naround astrology or New Age religions (Nussbaum 2011). If\neither of these specifications is factored into Respect (2), then the\nnorm of respect for persons will not rule out nonneutral state action\nthat favors some disputed conceptions of the good over other less\nreasonable conceptions.\n\n\nThe first two specifications, however, can do justice to the thought\nthat respect for persons is respect for their distinctive capacity to\nrespond to the reasons that apply to them. It is much less clear\nthat the third specification can do so. Since irrational and even\nsilly conceptions of the good can be the product of efforts to find\nmeaning or value in life, they are entitled to full respect under\nit. However, since these conceptions of the good are not the\nproduct of the exercise of rational capacities\u2014except in the\nvery minimal sense in which any belief is the product of such\ncapacities\u2014the third specification fits uncomfortably with the\nthought that respect for persons is respect for their rational capacity\nto respond to reasons. Yet this minimal specification of the\nstandards of reasonableness\u2014precisely because it is so\nundemanding\u2014can support a principle of state neutrality with\nwide scope.\n\n\nThere is a tension, then, between construals of Respect (2) that\ntake seriously the claim that the distinctive feature of persons is\ntheir capacity to respond to reasons and construals of Respect (2) that\ncan ground a principle of state neutrality that has the kind of wide\nscope associated with common understandings of the principle.\nThere may be no cogent construal of Respect (2) that both does justice\nto the thought that persons are owed respect in virtue of their\nrational capacities and grounds a principle of state neutrality with\nwide scope. Moreover, Respect (1) remains an eligible\ninterpretation of the norm of respect for persons and, as emphasized\nhere, it cannot ground a principle of state neutrality of the sort that\nproponents of the principle traditionally have wanted to defend.\n\n\nNo conclusions can be drawn in this entry concerning the best\ninterpretation of the norm of respect for persons. In light of\nthe foregoing discussion, two modest points can be registered.\nFirst, a simple and straightforward appeal to the norm of respect for\npersons cannot ground or justify the principle of state neutrality (on\nany of its common formulations), since this norm, like other normative\ncommitments, is subject to a range of interpretations, which are very\nmuch in dispute among moral and political philosophers.\nSecond, perfectionists and anti-perfectionists alike can\naccept that respect for persons is a factor relevant to assessing the\nlegitimacy of state action. Their disagreement over how this norm\nis best characterized is reflected in their disagreement over state\nneutrality.\n3.3  Self-Respect and Societal Excellence\n\nPutting respect for others aside, considerations of self-respect, and\nthe social conditions that support a secure sense of self-respect,\nhave been thought to bear on the advisability of perfectionist\npolitical action.  Most notably, Rawls claimed that a secure sense of\nself-respect, and the social conditions that support it, is a\nfundamental primary good, one that political institutions ought to\nsecure for those subject to them.  Self-respect, Rawls further\nclaimed, requires two elements: (i) a \u201csecure conviction that\n[one\u2019s] conception of [one\u2019s] good, [one\u2019s] plan of\nlife, is worth carrying out\u201d and (ii) \u201ca confidence in\none\u2019s ability, so far as it is within one\u2019s power, to\nfulfill one\u2019s intentions\u201d (Rawls 1971, 440).\n\nThe first of these elements \u2013 the conviction claim \u2013 may\ntell against state measures designed to promote some activities and\npursuits over others on the grounds that they are especially valuable\nor worthy of advancement.  For such state action could express the\nview that the disfavored pursuits are not equally worthwhile and this,\nin turn, could damage the self-respect of those whose conception of\nthe good is bound up with them.  Presumably, this is why Rawls held\nthat \u201cdemocracy in judging one another\u2019s aims is the\nfoundation of self-respect in a well-ordered society\u201d (Rawls\n1971,442).\n\nTwo perfectionist responses to this line of thought can be mentioned\nbriefly here.  First, state efforts to promote excellence can be\ndesigned to encourage a wide range of human achievements that can be\nappreciated by many who do not directly participate in them.  Further,\npeople\u2019s self-respect may be affected significantly by the\nexcellence realized by their society.  If so, then by promoting\nsocietal excellence, the state would further the self-respect of its\nmembers (Kramer 2017). These positive effects on self-respect of state\naction that promotes excellence would need to be balanced against any\nnegative effects of such action.  Second, self-respect, as\ncharacterized by Rawls, may not be the relevant good.  Rather, the\nrelevant good may be merited self-respect (Wall 2013b).  Put\notherwise, each person may have a genuine interest in living a life\nthat is valuable and worthwhile, not one that he merely has a secure\nconviction is valuable and worthwhile, whether or not it in fact is.\nOn this view of self-respect, perfectionist political action that\nfavors worthwhile pursuits over base pursuits can further the relevant\ngood by contributing to a social environment that nourishes it.  As\nthis second response brings out, concerns over self-respect engage\ndeeper questions in value theory that divide perfectionists from many\nof their critics.\n3.4 The Harm Principle\n\n\nThose who reject the principle of state neutrality entrust the state\nwith the task of promoting the good. This can give rise to the worry\nthat a perfectionist account of politics is insufficiently sensitive to\nthe harm of coercion and to the value of liberty. If the state need not\nbe neutral among rival understandings of the good, then is the door not\nopen for the coercive imposition of state policies designed to promote\nthe good? In fact, many versions of perfectionism drawn from the\nhistory of political thought have paid little heed to the value of\nindividual liberty. It is an important matter, then, to what extent\nperfectionist politics can be reconciled with a proper regard for\nindividual liberty.\n\n\nTo approach this issue, it will be helpful to consider the so called\nharm principle. The harm principle, as articulated by writers in the\nliberal political tradition from Mill to Feinberg, is often taken to\nbe an essential safeguard for individual freedom in political\nsociety. At least at first pass, the harm principle substantially\nrestricts the power of governments to promote the good. It holds that\ngovernments cannot coercively interfere with persons unless doing so\nis necessary to prevent them from causing clear and direct harm to\nothers. The harm principle requires interpretation and can be\nunderstood in different ways. But for present purposes our question is\nwhether the harm principle is best understood to be an\nanti-perfectionist principle\u2014a principle that provides reasons\nfor rejecting or limiting perfectionist politics.\n\n\nThe first thing to say is that not all perfectionist policies are\ncoercive. Governments can and do promote the good noncoercively. A\ngovernment may promote the good, for example, when it intelligently\nsubsidizes art. This perfectionist policy need involve no coercive\ninterference\n whatsoever.[14]\nSo the harm principle, even if sound, would\nnot bar all perfectionist policies. It would rule out only coercive\ngovernmental policies designed to favor some options and discourage\nothers. The question then is whether this restriction is itself\nanti-perfectionist.\n\n\nHere we need to proceed with caution. The extent to which\nperfectionism licenses the coercive promotion of the good depends,\namong other things, on the degree to which autonomy or liberty is\nitself recognized to be a perfectionist good. On some versions of\nperfectionism the harm principle would be an anti-perfectionist\nprinciple, while on others it would not be. Consider, in this\nregard, Mill\u2019s own defense of the harm principle. For Mill\n\u201cindividuality\u201d is an essential component of a good human\nlife. Mill\u2019s notion of individuality can be understood to be a\nconception of autonomy. A person is autonomous for Mill if he leads his\nlife on his own terms and develops his capacities and faculties\naccording to \u201chis own mode of laying out his existence\u201d\n(Mill 1859, 64). The important point for present purposes is not Mill\u2019s\nparticular characterization of autonomy, but rather the structure of\nhis view. Autonomy is understood to be an essential aspect of a good\nhuman life, not a separate norm. And the value of autonomy explains, at\nleast in part, why Mill recommends the harm principle.\n\n\nThe Millian defense of the harm principle sits well with the\nperfectionist focus on good human lives. (Brink 2013) Its availability nicely\nillustrates how perfectionist politics can be consistent with a strong\nrejection of state coercion. But it is natural to suspect that\nMill overstates his case. Even granting that\n\u201cindividuality\u201d is an aspect of a good human life, we\nshould wonder why it takes priority over all other aspects. If a\ngovernmental policy, say a policy that criminalizes the sale and use of\ndangerous recreational drugs, would prevent many from ruining their\nlives while infringing the individuality of only a few, then, contrary\nto Mill, the government may do better in discharging its duty to\npromote good human lives by adopting the policy than by not adopting\nit.\n\n\nThis point can be pushed further. Autonomy, it can be argued,\nrequires that one have access to an adequate range of valuable or\nworthwhile options (Raz 1986). This adequacy requirement does not imply\nthat every time an option is closed off one\u2019s autonomy will be set\nback. Moreover, what may be of value is not autonomous agency per se,\nbut valuable autonomous agency. Joseph Raz explains: \u201cSince our\nconcern for autonomy is a concern to enable people to have a good life\nit furnishes us with reason to secure that autonomy which could be\nvaluable. Providing, preserving or protecting bad options does not\nenable one to enjoy valuable autonomy\u201d (Raz 1986, 412). If\nvaluable autonomy, and not autonomy per se, is what has perfectionist\nvalue, then when governments eliminate, or make it more costly for\npersons to pursue, worthless options, then they may do no perfectionist\nharm and much perfectionist good.\n\n\nOn Raz\u2019s view, the harm principle is superseded by an autonomy\nprinciple that captures the truth in it while avoiding its\nexaggerations. The autonomy principle holds that the state has negative\nduties to respect the autonomy of its citizens as well as positive\nduties to promote and sustain social conditions that contribute to its\nrealization. The harm principle, to the extent that it is sound, is\nvindicated because it follows, given certain contingent facts, from the\nautonomy principle. This leads Raz to reformulate the harm principle as\na principle \u201cthat regards the prevention of harm to anyone\n(himself included) as the only justifiable ground for coercive\ninterference with a person\u201d (Raz 1986, 412\u201313). So construed, the\nharm principle would permit the coercive enforcement of at least some\nself-regarding duties.\n\n\nBoth Mill and Raz accept versions of the harm principle. But they\naccept it not as a limit on perfectionist politics, but rather as a\nprinciple that guides the proper promotion of the good. Their political\ntheories are examples of perfectionist liberalism and their discussions\nof the harm principle show how perfectionist politics can be supportive\nof individual liberty. It can be objected, however, that the defense of\nindividual liberty provided by perfectionist liberalism is\ninsufficient. Recall that on the perfectionist view discussed here\nautonomy is an aspect of a good human life. It is not a separate norm.\nA strong and uncompromising defense of the harm principle, it may be\nthought, must be based on a different understanding of the value of\nautonomy, one that holds that the autonomy of persons cannot be\ninfringed even when doing so is, all things considered, in their best\ninterests. Autonomy, on this view, is a sovereign right, not an ideal\nto be promoted (Feinberg 1989). The nature and plausibility of this\nalternative view of autonomy, however, are not matters that can be\ntaken up\n here.[15]\n3.5 Manipulation and Independence\n\n\nMost perfectionist writers accept that sometimes the state can\npermissibly use coercion to promote the good. Still, coercion is\nin general a clumsy device for pursuing perfectionist ends\n(Hurka 1993, 157). Noncoercive perfectionism, such as subsidizing\nvaluable pursuits, attaching penalties to worthless ones or creating\nnew valuable options, is often the better method for promoting\nthe\n good.[16]\nEven noncoercive\nperfectionist measures, however, may pose a threat to autonomy.\nAs one critic expresses the worry,\n\n\nMessing with the options that one faces, changing one\u2019s\npayoffs can be seen as manipulation \u2026 If it is done\nintentionally, it also takes on the insulting aspect of manipulation,\nfor it treats the agent as someone incapable of making independent\nmoral decisions on the merits of the case. (Waldron 1989,\n1145\u20131146)\n\n\nThe objection is that noncoercive state perfectionism is inherently\nmanipulative. It distorts the rational decision making of\ncitizens by altering the value of their options. It is also\ninsulting\u2014the state treats its subjects as if they were\nchildren\u2014and this is objectionable, over and above any impact\nit has on their autonomy.\n\n\nThese are important concerns. Before discussing them more\nfully, we need to clarify their character. The noncoercive\nperfectionist measures in question are paternalistic in the sense that\nthey are intended to help citizens lead better lives. Not every\nkind of noncoercive state perfectionism is paternalistic,\nhowever. Recall nonhumanistic versions of perfectionism.\nThose who accept these views might favor state support for excellence\nin science and art not because doing so will enable citizens to lead\nbetter lives, but because the state ought to promote excellence.\nThis defense of noncoercive state paternalism does not presume that\nsome citizens are not good at making independent moral decisions about\nhow to lead their lives. The manipulation objection to\nnoncoercive state perfectionism, accordingly, must target a subset of\nthese measures.\n\n\nFocus then on noncoercive state perfectionist measures that are\nintended to help citizens make better decisions about how to lead their\nlives. Even if these measures are well designed, they may invade\nautonomy. And if autonomy is itself a perfectionist good, then\nthere would be perfectionist reasons to oppose these perfectionist\nmeasures. These reasons would not establish that no such measures\nshould be undertaken. Presumably, the autonomy-based reasons\ncould be outweighed in some cases, but\u2014assuming again that\nautonomy is a perfectionist good\u2014these reasons would establish\nthat there is a pro tanto case against state perfectionism of\nthis kind.\n\n\nIs it true that noncoercive state perfectionism that aims to help\ncitizens make better choices is inherently manipulative in an\nautonomy-invading way? Perhaps not. No government\n\u201ccan avoid either nonrationally shaping its citizen\u2019s\npreferences or providing them with incentives\u201d (Sher 1997,\n66). This is true, since even if governments do not adopt\nperfectionist measures, the unintended consequences of state action\nwill have effects on citizen preferences for options and on the\nrelative costs of the different options that they confront. Thus\nit can be said that \u201cif all political arrangements do\nnonrationally shape preferences and provide incentives, a government\nwill not further diminish autonomy simply by producing these effects\nintentionally\u201d (Sher 1997, 67).\n\n\nThis line of argument can be extended further. Every political\nsociety provides its members with an ethical environment, an\nenvironment that consists of options and pressures, some rational and\nsome not, that affect how the options are perceived. A political\nsociety that does not engage in state perfectionism of any kind can be\nsaid to countenance the ethical environment that results from its\npolitical decisions. (It countenances this environment insofar as\nit could have made decisions that would have affected it, but chose not\nto do so.) It is possible that an ethical environment that\nresults from no state perfectionism will be ideal for the autonomous\ndecision making of its members. This may not always be the case,\nhowever. Noncoercive state perfectionist measures may be able to\ncounteract or cancel various pressures and influences that would\notherwise impede rational decision making by its citizens.\nDesigned well, such measures might contribute to an ethical environment\nin which people were best able to respond to the reasons for and\nagainst the options that they confront.\n\n\nThis argument puts the spotlight squarely on the effects of\nperfectionist measures. If these measures help citizens respond\nbetter to the reasons for and against the choices that they confront,\nthen they may not invade, but rather protect and promote, autonomous\ndecision making. If so, this state perfectionism could not be\nresisted by appeal to autonomy\u2019s perfectionist value.\nEven if this argument were accepted, however, it would not\naddress all the concerns that motivate the manipulation\nobjection. That objection points not only to the effect that\nnoncoercive state perfectionism can have on autonomous decision making,\nbut also to its potentially insulting character. And its\npotentially insulting character is a function of the fact that it is\nintentionally undertaken by the state.\n\n\nNoncoercive state perfectionism can take two forms. It might\nbe designed to protect and promote autonomous agency, or it might be\ndesigned to help citizens pursue or engage with valuable options\n(Wall 1998, 197\u2013198). The second form may seem insulting in the\nway that the first is not. For the first form of state\nperfectionism merely seeks to empower citizens to make authentic\ndecisions about how to lead their own lives. It does not attempt\nto encourage them to take up some pursuits over others on the grounds\nthat doing so would constitute a more valuable exercise of their\nautonomous agency. It is possible that people have a fundamental\nright to ethical independence that rules out at least this second form\nof state \n perfectionism.[17]\n\n\nWe cannot escape the influence of our ethical environment: we\nare subject to the examples, exhortations, and celebrations of other\npeople\u2019s ideas about how to live. But we must insist that\nthat environment be created under the aegis of ethical independence:\nthat it be created organically by the decisions of millions of people\nwith the freedom to make their own choices, not through political\nmajorities imposing their decisions on everyone. (Dworkin 2011,\n371)\n\n\nIf there is a right to ethical independence (and if people generally\nbelieved in its existence), then this would help to explain the sense\nof insult mentioned above. State perfectionism, it could be said,\nusurps the responsibility of people to lead their own lives as they see\nfit, provided that they allow others the same freedom. By so\ndoing, it treats adult citizens as if they were children.\n\n\nThe right to ethical independence may be thought to follow from\nsomething even more fundamental\u2014the equal moral status of\ncitizens. State perfectionist measures, whether coercive or not,\nthat aim to encourage some pursuits and discourage others on the\ngrounds that they have greater ethical value offends this status by\npresuming that some citizens are not fully capable of forming, pursuing\nand revising a conception of the good (Quong 2011, 101\u2013106).\nThis denial of equal moral status explains why such measures send an\ninsulting message, one that is objectionable over and above any impact\nit has on the autonomy of citizens.\n\n\nIn response, perfectionists can argue that the purported right to\nethical independence is an exaggeration of an important, but more\nmodest truth. If autonomy is a perfectionist good, and if it is a\ncentral component in a well lived life, then persons have rights to\nmake important life-shaping decisions that governments must\nrespect. By acknowledging and honoring these rights, governments\ntreat their citizens not as children, but as independent moral\nagents. However, these rights do not follow from, or add up to, a\ngeneral right of ethical independence, one that rules out all\ngovernmental efforts to promote the good.\n\n\nFurther, perfectionists can argue that it is no insult to a\nperson\u2019s status as a moral equal to treat him in ways that\npresume that his rational capacities are not perfect, but subject to\nerror. Our capacity to form, pursue and revise a conception of\nthe good, like our capacity for a sense of justice, can lead us to\nmistaken conclusions. When the state supports valuable pursuits\nover worthless ones, it no more denies the equal moral status of those\nwho reject its action than when it enforces a sound conception of\njustice that is in dispute. In both cases, presuming that\ncitizens can make errors does not express the view that they lack, or\nare deficient in, the capacities that constitute equal moral\nstatus.\n3.6 Indirect Arguments\n\n\nThe principle of state neutrality, the harm principle, and the\npurported right to ethical independence all impose moral limits on the\npower of governments to promote the good or the means by which they can\nuse to promote the good. But sometimes it is claimed not that\nperfectionist politics are in principle illegitimate, but rather that\nthey are or would be self-defeating. The best way for the state to\npromote the good, it is sometimes claimed, is for it to refrain\nscrupulously from all direct efforts at promoting the good (Kymlicka\n1990, 199\u2013205). An indirect argument against perfectionist politics\nthus grants that it is permissible for the state to promote good human\nlives, but seeks to shows that efforts by the state to do so will fail.\nIndirect arguments of this kind take different forms. Some arguments\nappeal to the nature of the human good, while others point to the\nincompetence of modern governments.\n\n\nThe most influential argument that appeals to the nature of the\nhuman good holds that for an activity or relationship to improve a\nperson\u2019s life he or she must endorse its value. This argument, which is\noften referred to as the endorsement constraint, holds that\npolitical measures that compel or guide people into activities or\npursuits that they do not value will be counterproductive. These\nmeasures will not improve the lives of anyone; and they may do harm by\ndirecting people away from activities and pursuits that would add value\nto their lives.\n\n\nThe endorsement constraint is based on a simple idea. To add value\nto a human life, an activity or relationship must be affirmed from the\ninside. \u201cNo life goes better by being led from the outside\naccording to values the person does not endorse\u201d (Kymlicka 1990,\n203). Questions can be raised about what constitutes endorsement of an\nactivity. For example, does endorsement require a positive affirmation\nof the value of an activity or does it merely require that one not be\nalienated from it? Different versions of the endorsement constraint can\nbe distinguished depending on how the motive that is taken to condition\nthe value of activities is characterized. And different versions of the\nendorsement constraint will have different implications for state\npolicies. Suppose, for example, that many citizens have no opinion\nwhatsoever on the value of art and that they are induced to attend art\nmuseums because their government gives them a tax break for doing so.\nHere they do not endorse the activity in the strong sense of positively\naffirming its value. Nevertheless, the government policy of giving tax\nbreaks to citizens who attend art museums may do some good if\nendorsement does not require positive affirmation. If the citizens are\nnot alienated from the activity, then they may derive value from\nit.\n\n\nThe endorsement constraint looks particularly compelling when\ncertain examples are considered. To take one such example: it is widely\nthought that for religious worship to add value to a life it must be\ntrue that the person actually sees the value of religious worship from\n\u201cthe inside.\u201d Critics of the endorsement constraint contend\nthat the argument overgeneralizes from these plausible examples (Wall\n1998). Critics also contend that the endorsement constraint has real\nforce when directed at state efforts to compel people to pursue\nparticular activities, but much less force when directed at state\nefforts to discourage, or forbid, certain worthless activities (Hurka\n1995, 47\u201348). For example, if the state criminalizes prostitution, then\nit need not compel anyone to pursue an activity that he or she judges\nto be of no value. Closing off a worthless option can leave many\nworthwhile options open for people to pursue according to their own\njudgments about the value of these options.\n\n\nThe endorsement constraint can be bolstered so that it speaks\nagainst state efforts to screen off bad options, even when these\nefforts leave citizens free to pursue valuable options according to\ntheir own judgments. The endorsement constraint, it is sometimes\nclaimed, is necessary to ensure that people lead lives of ethical\nintegrity. To lead a life of ethical integrity one must respond well to\nthe challenge one\u2019s life presents one with. And such a challenge, or so\nit may be argued, cannot be made better when \u201cit has been\nnarrowed, simplified, and bowdlerized by others in advance\u201d\n(Dworkin 1995, 271).\n\n\nThis defense of the endorsement constraint grounds it in a\nbackground conception of a good human life, one that holds that the\ngoodness of a human life lies in \u201cthe inherent value of a skilled\nperformance of living\u201d (Dworkin 1995, 244). This background\nconception of a good human life (a conception Ronald Dworkin refers to\nas \u201cthe challenge model\u201d) has been subject to telling\ncriticism (Arneson 2003); but its availability nicely illustrates how\nan ethical concern for promoting good human lives can ground resistance\nto perfectionist state policies designed to promote such lives.\n\n\nRather than appealing to a background conception of a good human\nlife, indirect arguments more frequently appeal to more mundane facts\nabout the competence of modern governments. For a variety of reasons,\nit is often thought that modern governments simply are not up to the\ntask of promoting the good. It will be helpful to distinguish local\nfrom global versions of this objection. It might be true that a\nparticular state should not directly promote the good. Those in power\nin this state might hold false beliefs about the good, for example. In\naddition, it might be true that states in general should not directly\npromote certain objective goods. Friendship is a good that plausibly\ncontributes to the objective value of human lives, but if states try to\npromote it directly they may do more harm than good. These are both\ninstances of local worries about perfectionist politics.\n\n\nThe global objection generalizes from either or both of these\nworries. It holds either that all states lack the competence to promote\nthe good or that all (or perhaps most) goods are such that it would be\ncounterproductive for the state directly to promote them. Local worries\nabout the effectiveness of perfectionist politics present no deep\nproblem for perfectionist political theory. No serious writer on\npolitics does not share them to some extent. Global distrust of\nperfectionist politics, however, may seem to present a genuine\nobjection. If global distrust of the competence of modern governments\nto promote the good were warranted, then the best policy for states to\nadopt might be state neutrality. For consequentialist reasons, a\nperfectionist approach to politics could recommend that the state never\naim to promote the good.\n\n\nThe global objection rests on very strong claims. Perfectionists can\nreply that those who advance them exaggerate valid worries about the\npotential for states to abuse their power. In addition, they can argue\nthat the global objection threatens more than perfectionist politics.\nIf states cannot competently promote the good, then, for the same\nreasons, they may not be able to enforce justice competently either\n(Caney 1991). Finally, perfectionists can argue that institutional\nsafeguards, such as legally codified rights, can be effective in\npreventing the abuse of state power, including state power that\npromotes perfectionist goods (Sher 1997).\n\n\nBe this as it may, it is important not to confuse means with ends.\nThe end of perfectionist politics is the protection and promotion of\nobjective goods and/or objectively valuable human lives. The question\nof where and how often the state should rely on indirect, rather than\ndirect, measures to promote the good is a question within perfectionist\npolitical\n theory.[18]\nThough nothing of much importance turns on it, one could categorize a\nview that holds that perfectionist political ends are, for contingent\nreasons, always best pursued indirectly as a genuine instance of\nperfectionism. Indeed, one can imagine a view that holds that\nperfectionist political ends will be best achieved if no state official\naccepts the perfectionist approach to politics. This would be an\nextreme limiting case\u2014a self-effacing perfectionism, but\nperhaps a perfectionist theory of politics nonetheless.\nAlternatively, one might conclude that a perfectionism that always\ncounseled its own rejection would not be worthy of the name.\n4. Conclusion\n\n\nPerfectionism has a distinguished pedigree in the history of ideas,\nbut like many theories in moral and political philosophy it remains\nvery much a work in progress. The topics discussed in this \nentry\u2014perfectionist value theory, perfectionist ethics and\nperfectionism as an approach to politics\u2014are subject to\non-going controversy and development. Moreover, these topics, while\ncomplementary, remain partially independent of one another. It is\npossible to affirm perfectionist ethics and reject perfectionism as an\napproach to politics. Likewise, it is possible to accept some of the\nclaims of perfectionist value theory while rejecting perfectionist\nethical and political conclusions.",
