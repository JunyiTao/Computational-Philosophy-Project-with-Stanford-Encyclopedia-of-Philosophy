If he derives satisfaction from giving \u2026 he can\nstill give, and nothing has been done to impair that right\n(Arrow 1972, 350).\n\n\n\nAs the quotation from Arrow (above) suggests, there is a puzzle\nabout why permitting payment for blood or organs should be thought to\nreduce the amount of altruism in the world. For why\ncouldn't paid and unpaid donation systems peacefully coexist,\nwith people who want to give freely continuing to do so? Furthermore,\npaid donations may even add to the amount of altruism in the world. For\nthere can be cases in which a person sells an organ not for\n\u2018selfish\u2019 reasons, but in order to pay (for example) for\nsomeone else's medical care (Brecher 1994).\n\n\nGiven this, how exactly will allowing organ sale lead to there being\nless altruism in the world? The main answer given is that it would\nundermine the practice of free donation. Abouna (1991, 167), for\nexample, claims that there is:\n\n\n\u2026 considerable evidence to indicate that marketing in human\norgans will eventually deprecate and destroy the present willingness of\nmembers of the public to donate their organs out of altruism.\n\n\n\nOne explanation for this is that when we give people financial\nincentives to do some act this undermines or reduce the extent to which\nthey feel morally obliged to do that act. In this way, financial\nincentives \u2018crowd out\u2019 altruism (Satz 2010, 193; Sandel 2012).\n\n\nBut is it really true that kidney sale would undermine the practice of\nfree donation? Well, it could do and ultimately this is a\ncontested empirical matter about which, as a mere philosopher, one\nought not to claim to have an authoritative view. That said, there are\nreasons for scepticism about the claim that kidney sale would\nundermine the practice of free donation.\n\nThe most important of these is that, at least as far as living\ndonation is concerned, there is not a very large practice out there to\nbe undermined. Given the pain and inconvenience involved, free\ndonation is likely to remain a minority pursuit. Living donation is\nadmittedly on the rise and, according to the National Kidney\nFoundation, almost a third of US kidney transplants in 2014 came from\nlive donors.  However, this is still a 'drop in the ocean' compared to\nthe 102,000 people on the waiting list and a majority of these live\ndonors are friends or (more commonly) relatives of the recipient, or\nare part of a 'pairing arrangement' (where A's relative donates to B,\nand B's relative donates to A).  Given such people's strong interest\nin saving their friends' or relatives' lives, one would think that\nmany of them will not be put off by the mere possibility of payment.\nAnd it is notable that fewer than 200 people in the US in the same\nyear became unrelated anonymous live donors.\n\n\nKidneys may then be importantly different from (say) blood. For if\nthere is no substantial system of free donation in place, then free\ndonation cannot be undermined by permitting sale. But if an almost\nadequate system of free donation does exist (as, in many countries, it\ndoes with blood) then there is a serious possibility of its being\nundermined. Thus, the argument which says that what is wrong with sale\nis that free donation would be undermined might well work for blood,\neven if it does not for kidneys. The same might be true of the\narguments in favour of an altruistic blood system proposed by Titmuss\nand others. Perhaps the voluntary blood donation system (and\nindeed a voluntary posthumous organ donation system) can be used as a\nmethod of encouraging a valuable culture of altruism, but this is much\nless likely to work in the case of living organ donation\n(Archard 2002; Campbell 2009; Titmuss 1997).\n\n\nThis difference between kidneys and blood reveals a general structural\ndifficulty for altruism arguments against sale. For altruism arguments\n(insofar as they work at all) work better for those things which are\nalready freely donated on a large scale, than for those things which\nare hardly freely donated at all. Hence, they will tend to be most\nsuccessful where, in a sense, they are needed least\u2014because if\nthere is already widespread free donation, then commercialization will\nbe unnecessary. This is not a decisive objection, since there are\nthings which are in short supply in spite of widespread free donation\n(blood and sperm might be examples of this).  But it is a problem for\nthis style of argument because there will be a tendency for it to be\nleast successful where it is most needed (Radcliffe Richards 1996,\n2009, 2012; Wilkinson & Moore 1999).\n",
