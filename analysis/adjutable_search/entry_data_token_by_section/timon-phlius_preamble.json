    "main_text": "\n\nTimon (c. 320\u2013230 BCE) was the younger contemporary and leading\ndisciple of\n Pyrrho\n of Elis. Unlike Pyrrho, he wrote numerous poems and prose works;\nfragments of and reports on some of these have survived, by far the\nlargest number (more than sixty) being from the Silloi\n(Lampoons). Several of these works were devoted to, or at\nleast included, laudatory descriptions of Pyrrho and his philosophy;\nthe Silloi appears to have contained some passages in this\nvein, but consisted largely of satirical thumbnail sketches of a wide\nrange of other philosophers, all of whom, in Timon\u2019s estimation,\nfailed wholly or partly to achieve the ideal outlook exemplified by\nPyrrho. Despite the hazards of attempting to extrapolate from this\nmeager and highly colored material, it constitutes much the best\nevidence we have for the character of Pyrrho\u2019s thought. There\nis, however, some indication that Timon also took stands on\nphilosophical matters about which Pyrrho is unlikely to have had\nanything to say. And even when he can be assumed to be emulating\nPyrrho\u2019s frame of mind, he may sometimes be expanding on or\nadapting Pyrrho\u2019s original position rather than simply reporting\nit. He should not, then, be regarded as a mere carbon copy of his\nteacher.\n\nThe present article concentrates on the nature of Timon\u2019s\nwritings, and on contributions to philosophy that may be thought to be\noriginal with him.\n",
