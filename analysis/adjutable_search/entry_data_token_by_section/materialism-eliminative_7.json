    "main_text": "Arguments For Eliminative Materialism || Specific Problems With Folk Psychology\n3.2 Specific Problems With Folk Psychology\n\nThe second family of eliminative materialist arguments focuses upon\nidiosyncratic features of folk-psychological posits and ultimately\ndenies that these features will be accommodated by a scientific\naccount of the mind. The most widely discussed features are two\nassociated with the apparent linguistic nature of beliefs and other\npropositional attitudes. First, as a number of philosophers have\nrecently noted, propositional attitudes appear to have a form similar\nto public language sentences, with a compositional structure and\nsyntax. For example, a person\u2019s belief that, say, the president\ndislikes terrorists appears to be composed of the concepts \u201cTHE\nPRESIDENT\u201d, \u201cDISLIKES\u201d, and\n\u201cTERRORISTS\u201d, and differs from the belief that terrorists\ndislike the president by virtue of something analogous to syntactic\narrangement. Second, beliefs resemble public sentences in that they\nhave semantic properties. Beliefs, like public linguistic\nrepresentations, are about different states of affairs. Both of these\nquasi-linguistic features of propositional attitudes\u2014their\nalleged sentential structure and their semantic (or intentional)\nproperties\u2014have been used by philosophers to mount arguments for\neliminativism.\n3.2.1 Challenging The Syntactic Structure Of Beliefs\n\nSome writers have emphasized the apparent mismatch between the\nsentential structure of propositional attitudes on the one hand, and\nthe actual neurological structures of the brain on the other hand.\nWhereas the former involves discrete symbols and a combinatorial\nsyntax, the latter involves action potentials, spiking frequencies and\nspreading activation. As Patricia Churchland (1986) has argued, it is\nhard to see where in the brain we are going to find anything that even\nremotely resembles the sentence-like structure that appears to be\nessential to beliefs and other propositional attitudes.\n\nIn response to this line of reasoning, many have argued that it is\na mistake to treat folk psychology as committed to a quasi-linguistic\nstructure to propositional attitudes (Horgan and Graham, 1991;\nDennett, 1991). And even for those who find this reading of folk\npsychology plausible, there is a further difficulty regarding the\nrelevance of neuroscience for determining the status of folk\npsychology. Some, such as Zenon Pylyshyn (1984), have insisted that\njust as the physical circuitry of a computer is the wrong level of\nanalysis to look for computational symbol structures, so too, the\ndetailed neurological wiring of the brain is the wrong level of\norganization to look for structures that might qualify as beliefs.\nInstead, if we view the mind as the brain\u2019s program, as many\nadvocates of classical AI do, then folk posits exist at a level of\nanalysis that is more abstract than the neuro-physical details.\nConsequently, many realists about the posits of folk psychology\ndiscount the importance of any apparent mis-match between neurological\narchitecture and the alleged linguistic form of propositional\nattitudes (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; McLaughlin & Warfield,\n1994).\n3.2.2 Challenging the Semantic Properties of Beliefs\n\nThe second type of argument against beliefs focuses upon their\nsemantic properties and concludes that these sorts of properties make\npropositional attitudes ill-suited for even a computational theory of\nthe mind. Stephen Stich (1983) has emphasized that folk psychology\nindividuates beliefs by virtue of their semantic properties, e.g., we\ntaxonomize states like beliefs by virtue of what they are about.\nHowever, according to Stich, there are a host of reasons for rejecting\na semantic taxonomy for scientific psychology. Semantic taxonomies\nignore causally salient aspects of cognitive states, involve a high\ndegree of vagueness, and break down in the case of the mentally ill or\nthe very young. In place of the semantic individuation method adopted\nby folk psychology, Stich argues for a syntactic taxonomy that is\nbased upon the causally relevant syntactic or physical properties of a\ngiven cognitive state.\n\nYet, as Stich himself notes, even if it should turn out that folk\nposits do not belong in a scientific psychology, more is needed to\nestablish that they do not actually exist. After all, we do not doubt\nthe existence of several sorts of things (e.g., chairs, articles of\nclothing) that are defined in ways that make them ill-suited for\nscience. Thus, Stich\u2019s account is not truly eliminativist for\nthe reasons we saw in Section 2.3: his prescription is for a\nscientifically superior taxonomy that still involves belief-like\nstates. Moreover, if our best scientific account posited states that\nshare many features with beliefs, such as similar causal roles, then\neven if the two taxonomies pulled apart in certain cases, we may still\nregard folk psychology as, in some sense, vindicated. While the\nscientific taxonomy may not list beliefs as basic cognitive states, it\ncould conceivably still provide the resources for developing a realist\ninterpretation of these and other folk psychological states.\n3.2.3 Eliminativism and Cognitive Science\n\nOne way to get a stronger eliminativist conclusion would be to argue\nthat there is nothing posited in a scientific account of cognition\nthat shares the central properties we attribute to folk psychological\nstates, at any level of analysis. For example, Ramsey, Stich\nand Garon (1990) have argued that if certain\n connectionist\n models of memory and inference prove successful, then this would form\nthe basis for eliminative materialism regarding states like\npropositional memories. Since some connectionist models store\ninformation in a highly distributed manner, there are no causally\ndiscrete, semantically evaluable data structures that represent\nspecific propositions. It is not just that these models lack the sort\nof sentential, compositional representations assumed in more\ntraditional (or \u201clanguage of thought\u201d) models. Rather, it\nis that in these networks there are no causally distinct structures\nthat stand for specific states of affairs. Consequently, there do not\nappear to be any structures in these networks that might serve as\ncandidates for beliefs and other propositional attitudes. This is\nnoteworthy since many critics of eliminativism claim it is virtually\nimpossible to imagine what a psychological theory would look like that\ndoesn\u2019t invoke propositional attitudes to explain cognition\n(Hannan, 1993). If Ramsey, Stich and Garon are right, certain\nconnectionist models may, for the first time, provide us with a\nplausible account of cognition that supports the denial of belief-like\nstates. More recently, Ramsey (2007) has argued that this earlier\nargument does not go far enough, insisting that connectionist models\nof this sort not only fail to invoke inner representations that are\nsufficiently similar to the posits of folk psychology, but that they\ndon\u2019t actually invoke inner representational states at all.\n\nRamsey, Stich and Garon\u2019s argument assumes that in highly\ndistributed networks, it is impossible to specify the semantic content\nof elements of the network that are causally responsible for various\ncognitive episodes. Some have responded to their argument by\nsuggesting that, with highly sophisticated forms of analysis, it\nactually is possible to pick out causally relevant pieces of stored\ninformation (Forster and Saidel, 1994). Others have argued that, like\nthe Churchlands, Ramsey, Stich and Garon have offered a mistaken\ninterpretation of folk psychology, suggesting it requires far less in\nthe way of explicit, discrete structures than they suggest (Dennett,\n1991; Heil, 1991). This is a common criticism of eliminative\nmaterialism, and we will look at it more closely in Section 4.3.\n\nAnother development in cognitive science that has pushed some people\nin the direction of eliminativism is the attempt to understand\ncognitive systems as neither classical nor connectionist computational\ndevices, but rather as dynamic systems, described using the\nmathematical framework of dynamic systems theory (Beer, 2000; van\nGelder, 1992; Port and van Gelder, 1995). This approach is often\nconjoined with some version of embodied cognition, as both place a\nstrong emphasis on the way cognitive agents move about and interact\nwith their environment. While neither the dynamic nor the embodied\napproaches are inherently anti-representational in nature, at least\nsome authors have employed them to develop accounts of cognitive\nprocesses that abandon inner representational states altogether. For\nexample, Anthony Chemero has promoted what he calls \u201cradical\nembodied cognitive science\u201d (Chemero, 2009). This theoretical\nframework treats the cognitive agent and environment as a complex\ncoupled system best explained by a mix of dynamics and James\nGibson\u2019s ecological theory of perception (Gibson, 1950). Chemero\nexplicitly endorses eliminativism by rejecting the traditional\nassumption that agents solve problems and navigate through the world\nby consulting mental representations. He thus joins others in the\ncognitive science community, like artificial intelligence researcher\nRodney Brooks (Brooks, 1991), who have tried to account for cognition\nwithout invoking representational entities. Of course, it is too early\nto know how successful these non-representational approaches will\nultimately be, and many defenders of representationalism argue that\nthese efforts are not likely to account for more sophisticated\n\u201crepresentation-hungry\u201d tasks like planning (Clark and\nToribio, 1994).\n\nA related theoretical development in the philosophy of cognitive\nscience that also pushes a strong anti-representational perspective,\nat least for basic cognitive states, and that has its roots in the\nembodied, embedded tradition is radical enactivism. Authors\nlike Daniel Hutto and Erik Myin reject the traditional\ninformation-processing outlook and insist that whey they call the\n\u201chard problem of content\u201d\u2014 the problem of providing\na naturalistic account of the semantic properties of representational\ncontent (as opposed to mere co-variation) \u2014 is probably\nunsolvable for most inner states commonly thought as mental\nrepresentations (Hutto and Myin, 2012). Thus, Hutto and Myin join\nother authors who have endorsed eliminativism about mental\nrepresentations by focusing upon the problematic nature of\ncontent.\n",
