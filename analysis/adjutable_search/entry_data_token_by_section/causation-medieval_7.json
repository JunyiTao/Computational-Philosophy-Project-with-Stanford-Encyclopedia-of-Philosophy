One question is this: do medieval thinkers,\nin practice, establish causal propositions on the basis of argument?\nAnd the other is this: what sort of metatheory of causal argument do\nthe medievals have?\n\n\nThe answer to the first question is quite straightforward. Ockham,\nlike other fourteenth-century theologians \n\u2013 see, for example,  (Biard 2000) on Buridan \u2013 frequently gives instances\nwhere we can make reliable causal inferences and come to know causal\npropositions on the basis of experience (Ockham, Ordinatio\nPrologue, qu. 2: Opera Theologica I, p. 87) These arguments\nfrequently rely on a theory of natural kinds: for example, Ockham\nwrites\nBecause someone sees that, after eating such an herb,\nhealth follows for someone with a fever, and because he can eliminate\nall other causes of health for that person, he knows evidently that\nthat herb was the cause of health; and thus he has knowledge\n(experimentum) in the singular case. It is, however, obvious\nto him that all individuals of the same kind have an effect of the same\nkind in a patient of the same kind; and thus he assents evidently, as\nto a principle, that every herb of such a kind cures fever. (Ockham,\nOrdinatio prologue, qu. 2: Opera Theologica I, p.\n87)\n\n\nThe second question is that of a metatheory. Here the story becomes\nsomewhat more complicated. There was a generally accepted metatheory,\nnamely that of Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics, according to\nwhich scientific demonstrations were syllogistic proofs, based on\nnecessary and self-evident premises. There were two sorts of these:\nproofs of the simple fact (demonstrationes quia) and proofs of\nthe reasoned fact (demonstrationes propter quid). In the\nlatter, the syllogisms involved must have middle terms that are\ncauses of the state of affairs which is to be demonstrated.\nThis gives a theory of scientific reasoning in which the structure of\nthe arguments is intimately tied up with the structure of the causal\nchains that they demonstrate.\n\n\nThere is, indeed, an extensive literature of medieval commentaries\non the Posterior Analytics, and much of this literature is\nvery important; we find in it a great deal of material on the authors\u2019\nattitudes to necessity, the structure of science, the relation between\nvarious sciences, the autonomy of philosophy vis-\u00e0-vis\ntheology, and the like. However, it cannot be taken to be automatically\nrelevant to the practice of reasoning in the Middle Ages: the\nlogical metatheory (that of the syllogism) is far too restrictive, and\nthe conditions placed on scientific demonstrations are far too\nstringent, for it to be a plausible description of very many actual\nprocesses of reasoning, in the Middle Ages or at any other time.\n",
