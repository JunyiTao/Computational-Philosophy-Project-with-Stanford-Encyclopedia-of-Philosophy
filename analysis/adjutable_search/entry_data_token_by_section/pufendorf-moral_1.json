    "main_text": "The Method of Modern Natural Law || Pufendorf\u2019s Philosophical Method\n2.2 Pufendorf\u2019s Philosophical Method\n\nLike other early modern reformist schemes, Pufendorf\u2019s project\nfaced the central question of method in more specific terms. Initially\nhe followed the example of Weigel, his Cartesian mentor at Jena (whose\nown Arithmetic Description of Moral Wisdom would appear only\nin 1674; see Weigel 2003), by employing a quasi-mathematical approach\nthat aspired to demonstrative certitude in moral matters in place of\nAristotelian probabilism. Thus, the early EJU (1660) was formally\ndivided into Definitions (Bk.1) and Principles (Bk.2), with the latter\nsubdivided into Axioms and Observations. The truth and necessity of\nthe Axioms flowed directly \u201cfrom reason itself\u201d and a\n\u201cbare intuition of the mind,\u201d without the apprehension of\nparticulars, or interpersonal discussion, while the certainty of the\nObservations was known by the \u201ccollation and perception of\nindividual things corresponding to one another,\u201d and by\n\u201ccommon sense and experience\u201d (EJU 1999, pp. 6, 117;\nDufour 1980, R\u00f6d 1970, Bach 2013).\n\nHowever, Pufendorf adapted this approach in subsequent works. Though\nhe purported still to favor a \u2018mathematical\u2019 over an\n(\u201clubrica, infinita, et vere invia\u201d) empirical approach\nwhen writing to (Johan Christian von) Boineburg (1622\u20131672) in\nJanuary 1663 (BW #16, 1996, p. 24), criticism by Hermann Conring\n(1601\u20131681) and Johann Heinrich Boecler (1611\u20131672; see\nPalladini 1997a), which urged him to include a consideration of other\nwriters, particularly the ancients, soon led to a change in style.\nThus, beginning with his dissertations at Heidelberg, and then in the\nmajor natural law writings at Lund that emerged therefrom, Pufendorf\neliminated the formal scaffolding of the mos geometricus and\ninteracted more explicitly and directly with other, historical\nauthors. The new approach enlisted his considerable erudition (DAS\ncites over two hundred sources) \u2013 in a transitional culture\nwhere a reputation for being learned remained important \u2013 while\navoiding mere commentary or appeal to intellectual authority,\nprocedures which he explicitly dismissed. Instead, Pufendorf now\nemployed an \u2018eclectic\u2019 method that still involved rational\nanalysis and argument, to be sure, but that also acknowledged the\ncontingency of both his worldly subject matter and its intellectual\nconstrual (Hochstrasser 2000). The goal remained comprehensive\nunderstanding and demonstrative certitude, but one informed by wide\nand reflectively appropriated experience (derived from a careful study\nof history and contemporary events), and thus yielding a more\nempirically grounded and realistic (think Thucydides, Tacitus,\nMachiavelli, Lipsius, Hobbes) sort of moral and political\nargument.\n",
