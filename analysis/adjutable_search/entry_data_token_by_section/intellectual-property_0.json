    "main_text": "History of Intellectual Property\n1. History of Intellectual Property\n\nOne of the first known references to intellectual property protection\ndates from 500 B.C.E., when chefs in the Greek colony of Sybaris were\ngranted year-long monopolies for creating particular culinary\ndelights. There are at least three other notable references to\nintellectual property in ancient times\u2014these cases are cited in\nBruce Bugbee\u2019s formidable work The Genesis of American\nPatent and Copyright Law (Bugbee 1967). In the first case,\nVitruvius (257\u2013180 B.C.E.) is said to have revealed intellectual\nproperty theft during a literary contest in Alexandria. While serving\nas judge in the contest, Vitruvius exposed the false poets who were\nthen tried, convicted, and disgraced for stealing the words and\nphrases of others.\n\nThe second and third cases also come from Roman times (first century\nC.E.). Although there is no known Roman law protecting intellectual\nproperty, Roman jurists did discuss the different ownership interests\nassociated with an intellectual work and how the work was\ncodified\u2014e.g., the ownership of a painting and the ownership of\na table upon which the painting appears. There is also reference to\nliterary piracy by the Roman epigrammatist Martial. In this case,\nFidentinus is caught reciting the works of Martial without citing the\nsource.\n\nThese examples are generally thought to be atypical; as far as we\nknow, there were no institutions or conventions of intellectual\nproperty protection in Ancient Greece or Rome. From Roman times to the\nbirth of the Florentine Republic, however, there were many franchises,\nprivileges, and royal favors granted surrounding the rights to\nintellectual works. Bugbee distinguishes between franchises or royal\nfavors and systems of intellectual property in the following way:\nfranchises and royal favors restrict access to intellectual works\nalready in the public domain, thus these decrees take something from\nthe people. An inventor, on the other hand, deprives the public of\nnothing that existed prior to the act of invention (Bugbee 1967). One\nof the first statutes that protected authors\u2019 rights was issued\nby the Republic of Florence on June 19, 1421, to Filippo Brunelleschi,\na famous architect. This statute not only recognized the rights of\nauthors and inventors to the products of their intellectual efforts;\nit built in an incentive mechanism that became a prominent feature of\nAnglo-American intellectual property protection. For several reasons,\nincluding Guild influence, the Florentine patent statute of 1421\nissued only the single patent to Brunelleschi. The basis of the first\nlasting patent institution of intellectual property protection is\nfound in a 1474 statute of the Venetian Republic. This statute\nappeared 150 years before England\u2019s Statute of Monopolies;\nmoreover, the system was sophisticated. The rights of inventors were\nrecognized, an incentive mechanism was included, compensation for\ninfringement was established, and a term limit on inventors\u2019\nrights was imposed.\n\nAmerican institutions of intellectual property protection are based on\nthe English system that began with the Statute of Monopolies (1624)\nand the Statute of Anne (1710). The Statute of Monopolies granted\nfourteen-year monopolies to authors and inventors and ended the\npractice of granting rights to \u201cnon-original/new\u201d ideas or\nworks already in the public domain. In contrast to patent institutions\nin Europe, literary works remained largely unprotected until the\narrival of Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press in the fifteenth\ncentury. Even then there were few true copyrights granted\u2014most\nwere grants, privileges, and monopolies.\n\nThe Statute of Anne (1710) is considered by scholars to be the first\nstatute of modern copyright. The statute begins:\n\n\u201cWhereas printers, booksellers, and other persons have lately\nfrequently taken the liberty of printing, reprinting, and publishing\nbooks without the consent of the authors and proprietors \u2026 to\ntheir very great detriment, and too often to the ruin of them and\ntheir families: for preventing therefore such practices for the\nfuture, and for the encouragement of learned men to compose and write\nuse books, be it enacted \u2026\u201d (Great Britain, Statute\nof Anne, 1710)\n\n\nThe law gave protection to the author by granting fourteen-year\ncopyrights, with a fourteen-year renewal possible if the author was\nstill alive.\n\nIn the landmark English case Miller v. Taylor (1769), the\ninherent rights of authors to control what they produce, independent\nof statute or law, was affirmed. While this case was later overruled\nin Donaldson v. Becket (1774), the practice of recognizing\nthe rights of authors had begun. Over the following decades other\nEuropean countries, including Belgium, Holland, Italy, and\nSwitzerland, followed the example set by England (Bugbee 1967).\nVarious international treaties like the Berne Convention treaty and\nthe Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS 1994)\nagreement have expanded the geographic scope of intellectual property\nprotection to include most of the globe.\n",
