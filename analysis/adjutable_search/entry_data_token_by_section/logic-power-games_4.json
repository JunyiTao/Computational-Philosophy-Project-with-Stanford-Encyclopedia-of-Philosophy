Analyzing Power\n\nThis section looks at games in which individuals or groups take their\nchoices independently and concurrently, and, we stress once more,\nabstracting away from how the interaction evolves in time. It pays\nparticular attention to the relation between players\u2019 choices\nand preferences, mentioning the role of knowledge, and most\nimportantly it deals with how to express solution concepts in a\nlogical language.\n\nThe section first describes the general setting of cooperative games,\nthen it considers the more restricted and possibly better-known class\nof non-cooperative games.\n",
