Historical understanding and the twentieth century\n\nEvery period presents challenges for the historian, and every period\nraises problems for historiography and the philosophy of history. The\ntwentieth century is exceptional, however, even by this standard.\nEvents of truly global significance occurred from beginning to end.\nWar, totalitarianism, genocide, mass starvation, ideologies of murder\nand extermination, and states that dominated their populations with\nunprecedented violence all transpired during the century. The\nHolocaust (Snyder 2010, 2015), the Holodomor (Applebaum 2017), the\nGulag (Applebaum 2003), and the cultural and ideological premises of\nthe Nazi regime (Rabinbach et al 2020) have all presented historians\nwith major new challenges of research, framing, and understanding. How\nshould historians seek to come to grips with these complex and\nhorrifying circumstances? These occurrences were highly complex and\nextended and often hidden: many thousands of active participants, many\ngroups and populations, millions of victims, conflicting purposes and\ngoals, new organizations and institutions, numerous ideologies.\nMoreover, through too many of these novelties is woven the theme of\nevil \u2013 deliberate destruction, degradation, and murder of masses\nof innocent human beings. The historian of virtually any aspect of the\ntwentieth century is confronted with great problems of frame-setting,\nexplanatory purpose, and moral reflection.\n\nThese facts about the twentieth century raise problems for the\nphilosophy of history for several reasons. They challenge historians\nto consider the depth, detail, and human experience that the historian\nmust convey of the events and experiences that war, genocide, and\ntotalitarianism imposed on millions of people. The discovery and\ntruthful documentation of the extent and lived experience of these\ncrimes is a painful but crucial necessity. Second, historians are\nforced to reflect on the assumptions they bring to their research and\ninterpretations \u2013 assumptions about geography, political\ncausation, individual motivation, and behavior resulting in these\ncrimes. Third, historians must reconsider and sharpen their hypotheses\nabout causation of these vast and extended crimes against humanity.\nFourth, it appears inescapable that historians have a human\nresponsibility to contribute to worldwide changes in culture, memory,\nand politics in ways that make genocide and totalitarian oppression\nless likely in the future.\n\nThe ways in which historians have sought to understand the Holocaust\nhave undergone important historical realignment in the past twenty\nyears. Raul Hilberg (1961) and Lucy Dawidowicz (1975) captured much of\nthe postwar historical consensus about the Holocaust. However, recent\nhistorians have offered new ways of thinking about the Nazi plan of\nextermination. Timothy Snyder (2010, 2015) argues that the Nazi war of\nextermination against the Jews has been importantly\nmisunderstood\u2014too centered on Germany, when the majority of\ngenocide and murder occurred further east, in the lands that he calls\nthe \u201cbloodlands\u201d of central Europe (Poland, Latvia,\nLithuania, Ukraine, the Soviet Union); largely focused on\nextermination camps, whereas most killing of Jews occurred near the\ncities and villages where they lived, and most commonly by gunfire;\ninsufficiently attentive to the relationship between extermination of\npeople and destruction of the institutions of state in subject\ncountries; and without sufficient attention to Hitler\u2019s own\nworldview, within which the Nazi war of extermination against\nEurope\u2019s Jews was framed. Alexander Prusin (2010) conceptualizes\nthe topic of mass murder in the period 1933\u20131945 in much the\nsame geographical terms. Like Snyder, Prusin defines his subject\nmatter as a region rather than a nation or collection of nations. The\nnational borders that exist within the region are of less importance\nin his account than the facts of ethnic, religious, and community\ndisparities that are evident across the region. Thus both historians\nargue that we need to understand the geography of the Holocaust\ndifferently. Snyder believes that these attempts at refocusing the way\nwe understand the Holocaust lead to a new assessment: bad as we\nthought the Holocaust was, it was much, much worse.\n\nAnother strand of re-thinking that has occurred in the study of the\nHolocaust concerns a renewed focus on the motivations of the ordinary\npeople who participated in the machinery of mass murder. A major field\nof research into ordinary behavior during the Holocaust was made\npossible by the availability of investigative files concerning the\nactions of a Hamburg police unit that was assigned special duties as\n\u201cOrder Police\u201d in Poland in 1940. These duties amounted to\ncollecting and massacring large numbers of Jewish men, women, and\nchildren. Christopher Browning (1992) and Daniel Goldhagen (1996) made\nextensive use of investigatory files and testimonies of the men of\nReserve Police Battalion 101. Both books came to shocking conclusions:\nvery ordinary, middle-aged, apolitical men of the police unit picked\nup the work of murder and extermination with zeal and efficiency. They\nwere not coerced, they were not indoctrinated, and they were not\nderanged; and yet they turned to the work of mass murder with\nenthusiasm. A small percentage of the men of the unit declined the\nshooting assignments, but the great majority did not. Another\nimportant example of research on ordinary people committing mass\nmurder is Jan Gross\u2019s (2001) case study of a single massacre of\nJews in Jedwabne, a small Polish town during the Nazi occupation, but\nnot ordered or directed by the German occupation. Instead, this was a\nlocal, indigenous action by non-Jewish residents in the town who\ngathered up their Jewish neighbors and then murdered large numbers of\nthem. Gross\u2019s account has stimulated much debate, but Anna\nBikont (2015) validates almost every detail of Gross\u2019s original\nnarrative.\n\nAs a different example, consider now the history of the Gulag in the\nSoviet Union. Anne Applebaum (2003) provides a detailed and honest\nhistory of the Gulag and its role in maintaining Soviet dictatorship.\nStalin\u2019s dictatorship depended on a leader, a party, and a set\nof institutions that worked to terrorize and repress the population of\nthe USSR. The NKVD (the system of internal security police that\nenforced Stalin\u2019s repression), a justice system that was\nembodied in the Moscow Show Trials of 1936\u201338, and especially\nthe system of forced labor and prison camps that came to be known as\nthe Gulag constituted the machinery of repression through which a\npopulation of several hundred million people were controlled,\nimprisoned, and repressed. Further, like the Nazi regime, Stalin used\nthe slave labor of the camps to contribute to the economic output of\nthe Soviet economy. Applebaum estimates that roughly two million\nprisoners inhabited several thousand camps of the Gulag at a time in\nthe 1940s, and that as many as 18 million people had passed through\nthe camps by 1953 (Applebaum 2003: 13). The economic role of the Gulag\nwas considerable; significant portions of Soviet-era mining, logging,\nand manufacturing took place within the forced labor camps of the\nGulag (13). Applebaum makes a crucial and important point about\nhistorical knowledge in her history of the Gulag: the inherent\nincompleteness of historical understanding and the mechanisms of\noverlooking and forgetting that get in the way of historical honesty.\nThe public outside the USSR did not want to know about these\nrealities. Applebaum notes that public knowledge of the camps in the\nWest was available, but was de-dramatized and treated as a fairly\nminor part of the reality of the USSR. The reality\u2014that the USSR\nembodied and depended upon a massive set of concentrations camps where\nmillions of people were enslaved and sometimes killed\u2014was never\na major part of the Western conception of the USSR. She comments, \"far\nmore common, however, is a reaction of boredom or indifference to\nStalinist terror\" (18). Wide knowledge in the West of the scope and\nspecific human catastrophe of the Gulag was first made available by\nAleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (1974).\n\nSimilar references could be offered concerning Stalin\u2019s war on\nthe kulaks in the Ukraine (1930s), mass starvation in China\n(1958\u201361), the widespread violence of the Cultural Revolution in\nChina (1966\u20131976), and the use of violence in the American South\nto enforce Jim Crow-era race relations (1930s\u20131960s). In each\ncase terrible things took place on a wide scale, and barriers exist\nthat make it difficult for historians and the public to come to know\nthe details of these periods.\n\nThe twentieth century poses one additional challenge for the\nhistorian\u00a0because it falls within the human memories of the\nliving generation of historians grappling with its intricacies. When\nTony Judt writes (2006) about the fall of Ceau\u0219escu in Romania in\n1989, or Timothy Snyder (2010) writes about the murderous actions of\nGerman order police in Ukraine in 1940, or Marc Bloch (1949) writes\nabout the \u201cstrange defeat\u201d of France in 1940, they are\nwriting about events for which they themselves, or their parents, or\nPoles and Ukrainian Jews with whom they can interact, have direct\nlived experiences and memories. Timothy Snyder\u2019s style of\nhistorical writing suggests that the nearness in time of the killings\nin the bloodlands both supports and warrants an especially personal\nand individual approach; thus Snyder\u2019s use of many individual\nstories of victims of the killings of peasants, Jews, and other human\nvictims of the killing machines of Hitler and Stalin suggests that he\nbelieves it is important for the historian to make an effort to convey\nthe individual meanings of these events affecting millions of people.\nHow does this accessibility of the recent past affect the problems\nfacing the historian? Does it influence the ways in which historians\nselect events, causes, and actions as \u201ccrucial\u201d? Does this\nexperiential access through living memory provide a more secure form\nof historical evidence than other sources available to the historian?\nDoes it give rise to an experiential content and detail to historical\nwriting that solve an interpretive problem for the reader \u2013 for\nexample, how to put oneself in the position of a Ukrainian peasant\nslowly starving to death? Did the stories told in the Judt household\nin London in 1942 about beloved cousins then facing deadly threats in\nBrussels shape the historical consciousness of the adult historian\n(Judt and Snyder 2012)? Did Marc Bloch\u2019s own experience as a\nFrench army officer in defeat at Dunkirk influence the way that he\nunderstood war and violence? Access to individuals who lived through\nthe Holodomor or the Spanish Civil War is of course valuable\nhistorical evidence.\u00a0Here too, however, Marc Bloch has important\ninsights, for Bloch specifically challenges the idea that participants\nhave an inherently more reliable or complete form of knowledge than\nmore temporally distant historians (1953: chapter II). Memories and\npersonal accounts are valuable for the historian, but equally,\nhistorians have access to other forms of historical evidence\n(archaeological, archival, government records, \u2026) which may be\ncomparably important and epistemically secure in attempting to piece\ntogether the complex history of Stalin\u2019s war on the Ukrainian\npeasantry.\n\nThese topics in twentieth-century history create an important reminder\nfor historians and for philosophers: a truthful understanding of\ninhuman atrocity is deeply important for humanity, and it is difficult\nto attain. We learn from Judt, Snyder, and Applebaum that there are\npowerful mechanisms of deception and forgetting that stand in the way\nof an honest accounting of these periods of the recent human past.\nDiscovering and telling the truth about our past is the highest and\nmost important moral imperative that history conveys.\n",
