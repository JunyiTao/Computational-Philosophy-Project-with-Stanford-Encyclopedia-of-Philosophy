(Uniqueness for\nLocations)\nTherefore\n(20)\nNecessarily, for any x, and y1 and any\ny2, if x is exactly located at\ny1 and x is exactly located at\ny2, then y1=y2\n(from (18) and (19).)\n\n\nTo see that the inference from (17) to (18) is valid, suppose that\nobject o is exactly located at regions\nra and rb. Since\no is exactly located at ra, o\nis (by (17)) weakly located at all and only the entities that overlap\nra. Likewise, since o is exactly\nlocated at rb, o is weakly located at\nall and only the entities that overlap rb. So\nra overlaps a given entity if and only if\no is weakly located at that entity; and\nrb overlaps a given entity if and only if\no is weakly located at that entity. Hence\nra and rb overlap\nexactly the same entities: in other words, they mereologically\ncoincide. The rest of the argument is self-explanatory.\n\nThe argument may persuade some. However, those who are initially\ninclined to take the possibility of multilocation seriously may see\nthis argument as a reason to doubt the first premise and the\nassociated definition (Gilmore 2006: 203; Effingham 2015). (A parallel\nargument runs through an alternative definition: \u2018x is\nexactly located at y\u2019 means \u2018for any z, if\nz is simple, then z lies within x if and only if\nz is a part of y\u2019. As we noted in\n Section 2,\n this definition has the additional vice that in the context of gunky\nspacetime, it yields the result that everything is exactly located at\nevery region.)\n",
