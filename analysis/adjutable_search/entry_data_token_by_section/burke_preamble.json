    "main_text": "\n\n\nEdmund Burke, author of Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance, is known to a wide public as a classic political thinker:\nit is less well understood that his intellectual achievement depended\nupon his understanding of philosophy and use of it in the practical\nwritings and speeches by which he is chiefly known. The present essay\nexplores the character and significance of the use of philosophy in\nhis political thought. That thought is of the very first importance\nfor intellectual history and for the conduct of politics. This essay\nis the first attempt to examine its philosophical character and to\nconnect the latter with Burke\u2019s political activity. In doing so it\nshows the importance of the philosophical elements in Burke\u2019s thought\nand that these contribute important ways to his political thought.\n",
