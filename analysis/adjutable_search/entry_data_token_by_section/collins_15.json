    "main_text": "Influences || In England\n6.2 On the continent\n\nCollins\u2019 influence on the continent in the second half of the\neighteenth century was much more considerable than his influence in\nEngland. O\u2019Higgins remarks that \n\n\nSmall though his part in English literature may have been, during his\nown lifetime there were few English writers who were more fully\nreported in the continental journals, or more noted in foreign\nuniversities. (O\u2019Higgins 1970: 203)\n\n\nPierre Desmaizeaux knew Collins for some 26 years and was his friend\nand collaborator. Desmaizeaux played an important role in raising\nCollins\u2019 reputation both in England and on the continent.\nCollins discussed Clarke\u2019s response to his book on determinism\nwith Desmaizeaux and Desmaizeaux kept Collins in contact with the\nintellectual life on the continent and also served as a publicist for\nCollins. He had Collins\u2019 Inquiry translated into French\nand handled the printing of his other books. In 1720, under\nCollins\u2019 direction, Desmaizeaux published A collection of\nseveral pieces of Mr. John Locke, never before printed, or not extant\nin his works. Pub. by the author of the Life of the ever-memorable Mr.\nJohn Hales, &c which contained a number of Locke\u2019s\nletters to Collins. There was considerable interest on the continent\nin the thinking-matter controversy. There is a certain amount of\ndebate about the influence of Collins\u2019 book on free will and\ndeterminism on Voltaire. O\u2019Higgins accepts the evidence produced\nby Torrey in Voltaire and the English Deists that Voltaire\nwas converted to determinism by reading Collins (O\u2019Higgins 1970:\n219\u201320). As time passed free-thinking came out into the open in\nFrance and Collins\u2019 name was associated with it. Finally, his\nworks on the materiality of the soul, determinism and free will and\nthe prophecies influenced the group around Baron d\u2019Holbach. (For\na detailed treatment of Collins\u2019 influence on the continent, see\nO\u2019Higgins 1970: Chapter XI.) Whether Collins would have been\nhappy with this depends on whether we view him as a deist with\nO\u2019Higgins, or as an atheist with David Berman and Jacopo\nAgnesina. This disagreement over whether to regard Collins as a deist\nor as an atheist (or someone whose views changed over time or were\nunclear even to himself) is our most serious unresolved problem in\ndetermining Collins\u2019 proper place in the history of ideas.\n",
