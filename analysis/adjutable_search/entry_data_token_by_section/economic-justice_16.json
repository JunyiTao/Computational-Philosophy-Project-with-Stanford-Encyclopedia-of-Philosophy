However, when there are more than two parties, it\nbecomes relevant to consider the possibility for subgroups\n(coalitions) to reach separate agreements. Such considerations lead to\nthe broader theory of cooperative games.\n\nThis broader theory is, however, more developed for the relatively\neasy case when coalition gains are like money prizes which can be\nallocated arbitrarily among coalition members (the \u201ctransferable\nutility case\u201d). In this case, for the two-party bargaining\nproblem the Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions coincide and give\nequal gains to the two parties. The Shapley value is a solution which\ngeneralizes this to any number of parties and gives a party the\naverage value of the marginal contribution that this party brings to\nall coalitions which it can join. In other words, it rewards the\nparties in proportion to the increase in coalition gain that they\nbring about by gathering with others.\n\nAnother important concept is the core. This notion generalizes the\nidea that no rational party would accept an agreement that is less\nfavorable than the disagreement point. An allocation of the total\npopulation prize is in the core if the total amount received by any\ncoalition is at least as great as the prize this coalition could\nobtain on its own. Otherwise, obviously, the coalition has an\nincentive to \u201cblock\u201d the agreement. Interestingly, the\nShapley value is not always in the core, except for \u201cconvex\ngames\u201d, that is, games such that the marginal contribution of a\nparty to a coalition increases when the coalition is bigger.\n\nThe basics of this theory are very well presented in Moulin (1988) and\nMyerson (1991). Cooperative games are distinguished from\nnon-cooperative games by the fact that the players can commit to an\nagreement, whereas in a non-cooperative game every player always seeks\nhis interest and never commits to a particular strategy. The central\nconcept of the theory of non-cooperative games is the Nash equilibrium\n(every player chooses his best strategy, taking others\u2019\nstrategies as given), which has nothing to do with Nash\u2019s\nbargaining solution. It has been shown, however, that Nash\u2019s\nbargaining solution can be obtained as the Nash equilibrium of a\nnon-cooperative bargaining game, in which players make offers\nalternatively, and accept or reject the other\u2019s offer.\n",
