He developed what has become known as the\nthesis of the theory-dependence of observation, building on the work\nof N. R. Hanson (1958) while also referring to psychological studies\ncarried out by his Harvard colleagues, Leo Postman and Jerome Bruner\n(Bruner and Postman 1949). The standard positivist view was that\nobservation provides the neutral arbiter between competing\ntheories. The thesis that Kuhn and Hanson promoted denied this,\nholding that the nature of observation may be influenced by prior\nbeliefs and experiences. Consequently it cannot be expected that two\nscientists when observing the same scene will make the same\ntheory-neutral observations. Kuhn asserts that Galileo and an\nAristotelian when both looking at a pendulum will see different things\n(see quoted passage below).\nThe theory-dependence of observation, by rejecting the role of\nobservation as a theory-neutral arbiter among theories, provides\nanother source of incommensurability. Methodological\nincommensurability (\u00a74.1 above) denies that there are universal\nmethods for making inferences from the data. The theory-dependence of\nobservation means that even if there were agreed methods of inference\nand interpretation, incommensurability could still arise since\nscientists might disagree on the nature of the observational data\nthemselves. \nKuhn expresses or builds on the idea that participants in different\ndisciplinary matrices will see the world differently by claiming that\ntheir worlds are different: \n In a sense I am unable to explicate further, the\nproponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different\nworlds. One contains constrained bodies that fall slowly, the other\npendulums that repeat their motions again and again. In one, solutions\nare compounds, in the other mixtures. One is embedded in a flat, the\nother in a curved, matrix of space. Practicing in different worlds,\nthe two groups of scientists see different things when they look from\nthe same point in the same direction (1962/1970a, 150).\n\nRemarks such as these gave some commentators the impression that\nKuhn was a strong kind of constructivist, holding that the way the\nworld literally is depends on which scientific theory is currently\naccepted. Kuhn, however, denied any constructivist import to his\nremarks on world-change. (The closest Kuhn came to constructivism was\nto acknowledge a parallel with Kantian idealism, which is discussed\nbelow in Section 6.4.)\nKuhn likened the change in the phenomenal world to the\nGestalt-switch that occurs when one sees the duck-rabbit diagram first\nas (representing) a duck then as (representing) a rabbit, although he\nhimself acknowledged that he was not sure whether the Gestalt case was\njust an analogy or whether it illustrated some more general truth\nabout the way the mind works that encompasses the scientific case\ntoo.\n",
