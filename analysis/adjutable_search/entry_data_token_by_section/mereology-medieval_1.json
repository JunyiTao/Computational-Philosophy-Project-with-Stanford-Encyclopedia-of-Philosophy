Plato tells us that\ncollection and division provide us with a way to understand the\nrelationships between some unity and some plurality (Phaedrus\n265d\u2013266b, and Philebus 16c\u201317a). Division is a process\nwhereby any sort of unity is resolved into a plurality. Collection is\nthe process whereby a plurality is collected into a unity.\n\nFor the Neoplatonists, division and collection are first and foremost\napplied to genera and species (such as Animal and Human), and\ninstances of these universals (such as Brownie the donkey and\nSocrates). This primary mode of division is often interpreted as a\nlogical exercise. In particular, it is a method for developing\ndefinitions of things, which can then be used in demonstrations.\nCollection is construed as a method for classification.\n\nThe primary purpose of division for Late Ancient philosophers is to\ndetermine the hierarchical relations between a universal and that\nwhich falls under it. But divisions are applied to a variety of other\nitems. There is no single, canonical list of divisions (for an\noverview, see Magee 1998, xxxvii\u2013xlix). The list presented by\nBoethius is the one bequeathed to the Latin West (On Division\n877c\u2013d).  Boethius distinguishes between two broad categories:\nsubstantial divisions and accidental divisions. These divisions are\ndivided further. Of the substantial divisions there are:\n\nThe division of the genus into its species.\nThe division of the whole into parts.\nThe division of a word into its meanings.\n\n\nOf the accidental divisions there are:\n\nThe division of a subject into accidents.\nThe division of accidents into subjects.\nThe division of accidents into accidents.\n\n\nThe most important material for our purposes is Boethius\u2019\ntreatment of the first and second substantial modes of division.\n",
