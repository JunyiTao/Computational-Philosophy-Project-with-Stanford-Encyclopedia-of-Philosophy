    "preamble": "\n\nQing philosophy refers to the topography of the intellectual terrain\nof seventeenth- and eighteenth-century China, which sported coherent\npatterns and modes of intellection and argumentation among the texts\nand writings of the scholars in the period. In accordance with the\ncurrent historiographical convention, the time-span fell within the\nso-called \u201clate imperial\u201d era that encompassed the\ntransition from the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) to the Qing\n(1644\u20131911), as well as the first half of the Qing imperium.\nThat Qing philosophy is distinguished as an independent subject and\nentity, with its presumed boundaries and prominent features, is not\nmerely a function of chronology. Rather, it points to a substantial\ndeparture from the preceding intellectual traditions, which in their\naggregate form, amounted to Neo-Confucianism of the Song\n(960\u20131279) and Ming times. While Neo-Confucianism was not a\nmonolith to be sure, to the extent that it argued robustly on behalf\nof individual moral introspection via one\u2019s nature\n(xing) and mind-heart (xin) as the realization of\nultimate metaphysical truths\u2014variously construed as heaven\n(tian), principle (li), the great ultimate\n(taiji), and the Way (dao)\u2014it represented the\nforemost unfolding and predictive reality-principle that was Song-Ming\nthought in its totality. Qing philosophy, being in many ways a\nnegative reaction to it, was a rupture to begin with, even though in\nterms of intellectual history, multifarious aspects of continuity,\napart from discontinuity, must be taken into account. \n\nIt is important to note that the coherent patterns and modes\nidentified with Qing philosophy are my own narrative and interpretive\nconstructions for the purpose of limning the lineaments of the\nintellectual landscape of a time. They are analytical categories that\nresult from my hermeneutic intervention within the intellectual\nhistory of late imperial China, the coherent features of which might\nnot have been evident to contemporary scholars in the Qing. In short,\nQing philosophy is a constructed period concept that denotes a\ndistinct worldview with a specific temporal location.\n\nThe present essay begins, in section 1, with a synthetic\nconceptualization of Qing philosophy as a period concept that conveys\nboth substantive intellectual contents and a particular temporal\nposition. From historiographical and historical vantage points, it\nargues on behalf of the distinctiveness of the modes and patterns of\nphilosophical intellection in Qing times, identifying their departure\nfrom antecedent Song-Ming thoughts while paying due attention to\naspects of continuity. These dominant manners of intellection that\ncharacterize Qing philosophy are represented by four ideal-types of\nthinking\u2014vitalism, historicism, utilitarianism, and\nintellectualism. Together, they furnished the fundamental orientations\nand standards by which learning was pursued, adjudicated, and\nevaluated in the Qing period.\n\nAccordingly, the rest of the essay is organized around the individual\nand respective examinations of the four ideal-types of philosophical\nthinking, and hence the quadripartite structure. Section 2 explores\nvitalism as the philosophical emphasis on qi (material force\nor psycho-physical force) as the metaphysical fulcrum on which the\nworld turns. Section 3 reveals the ways in which historicism\nengendered the tendency to seek meaning in human agency by\nappreciating particular contingencies in changing contexts.\nUtilitarianism, elucidated in section 4, is my hermeneutic rendering\nof the Confucian activist ideal of ordering the world by extending\nutility and function to the fullest (jingshi).\nIntellectualism, also discussed in section 4, is a representation of\nthe Confucian quest for external, discursive knowledge, most vividly\nand concertedly manifested in the intellectual movement of evidentiary\nresearch (kaozheng). \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Qing Philosophy: a Period Concept\n\nTo assert and describe the newness of Qing philosophical thinking\nabout the manifold dimensions of reality in late imperial China is to\nhighlight a sense of departure from the immediate past, that is, to\ntrace the transition from the Song-Ming mode of thinking to the Qing\none by pinpointing the disjunction and continuity. In other\nwords, it begs the question of the relationship between late imperial\nthought and the preceding intellectual traditions. Inquiries into the\nMing-Qing intellectual transition have tended to adopt two narrative\nand analytical strategies: first, the comparative approach that\ncreates paradigms of adjoining intellectual movements and then points\nout their stark contrasts and vast differences; second, the\ndevelopmental approach based on the assumption of continuity, governed\nby notions of tradition, influence, and evolution. The comparative\napproach that stresses rupture was in fact adopted by the some of the\ntowering late Ming-early Qing intellectual figures, such as Gu Yanwu\n(1613\u201382) and Wang Fuzhi (1619\u201392), who created an\narchetype of Ming thought and Song-Ming Confucianism as abstract,\nabstruse, feckless, and feeble, such that they became a monolithic\ntype of thinking represented by finicky metaphysical\nspeculation and passive moral introspection. By Qing times, such a\nmode of intellection became collectively known as \u201cSong\nlearning\u201d (Songxue), with its overt focus on moral\nprinciples (yili zhi xue), as opposed to \u201cHan\nlearning\u201d (Hanxue), scholarship anchored on the deep\nphilological probing of texts and words, and their literal meanings\n(wenzi xungu). The modern restatement of this position was\nmade by Liang Qichao (1873\u20131929), a most influential late Qing\nand Republican intellectual figure, who criticized the futility of\nSong-Ming thought as \u201cvague\u201d, \u201cintangible\u201d,\nand \u201cabstract\u201d. Because of the wide circulation and common\nusage of the English translation by Immanuel Hsu of one of\nLiang\u2019s book on Qing intellectual history (Liang 1921 [1959]),\nLiang\u2019s view became for a long time the basic interpretive\nreference point for the study of late imperial intellectual trends,\ncreating a dominant historiography that interprets the Ming-Qing\nintellectual transition as a cataclysmic event that ushered in a new\nspirit of thought. Another giant intellectual figure, a stalwart of\nthe New Culture (or May-Fourth) movement, Hu Shi (1891\u20131962),\nheld similar views, going so far as to advance the influential thesis\nof Qing philosophy as scientific and progressive (Hu 1967:\n104\u2013131).\n\nChinese Marxist scholarship in general likewise endorses this\ncataclysmic interpretation of the emergence of\n\u201cprogressive\u201d thought in the late imperial period. Such\nthesis of discontinuity also found echoes in older western\nscholarship, such as that of the late Joseph Levenson, which contends\nthat it was only in the seventeenth century that voices began to be\nraised against Song-Ming idealism and subjective idealism (1964). In\nsum, according to the thesis of rupture between Song-Ming learning and\nlate imperial thought, seventeenth-century scholars begrudged the\ncorruption of learning by indulgent moral introspection and arcane\nmetaphysical speculation. As a result, there emerged the study of\npractical statecraft for the ordering of the workaday world of\ninstitutions and administrations, which realized the time-honored\nideal of jingshi zhiyong (ordering the world and extending\nutility). Moreover, in order to rectify the abuses of the Song-Ming\nempty talk (kongtan), evidential research (kaozheng\nor kaoju) arose, especially in the area of philology,\notherwise known as Han learning, in contradistinction to Song learning\nthat pursued speculative introspection.\n\nThe developmental approach to the question of the Ming-Qing\nintellectual transition based on the notion of continuity appears in\nFeng Youlan\u2019s (1895\u20131990) classic survey of Chinese\nphilosophy (1934 [1952\u20131953]), ably translated into English by\nthe late Derk Bodde (1909\u20132003). Feng regarded Han learning in\nthe Qing as innovative and creative thinking, but he also insisted\nthat it was a continuation of Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism because it\nproduced no new metaphysical categories. More thoroughgoing in arguing\non behalf of the linkage between Qing learning and Song learning was\nthe eminent Qian Mu (1895\u20131990). To Qian (1937), the early Qing\nsavants did actually uphold the Song cultural ideals, but he pointed\nout that the dominant scholastic Han learning and evidential\nscholarship of the later Qianjia period (the period of the reigns of\nthe Qianlong and Jiaqing emperors, 1736\u20131820) strayed from the\ntrue moral way and political commitments of the late Ming and early\nQing. The most sustained effort to interpret the intimate nexus\nbetween Song-Ming Confucianism and Qing thought is found in the\nseminal trilogy of volumes (Bary 1970, 1975; Bary & Bloom 1979) on\nMing and Qing thought, edited by the late dean of Neo-Confucian\nStudies, Wm. Theodore de Bary (1919\u20132017), which examine the\nroots and nature of the intellectual transformation in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries in terms of its intimate ties with Song-Ming\nantecedents. This thesis of continuity is eloquently restated by Qian\nMu\u2019s eminent student Y\u00fc Ying-shih, who interprets the\nnovelty of late imperial Chinese learning with reference to its\norganic relation with Song-Ming Confucianism by delineating the inner\nlogic of Confucian thinking. As Y\u00fc claims,\n\u201cIntellectualism\u201d, or the ideal of \u201cfollowing the\nway of inquiry and learning\u201d (dao wenxue), took center\nstage in late imperial thought, whereas in Song-Ming times,\n\u201canti-intellectualism\u201d, or the ideal of \u201chonoring\none\u2019s heaven-endowed moral nature\u201d (zun dexing)\npredominated (Y\u00fc 1975: 105\u2013136).\n\nThe theme of intellectual continuity was also evident in much of\nJapanese scholarship which generally regards Wang Yangming\u2019s\nidea of liangzhi (innately spontaneous moral knowing) as a\nmajor spiritual resource for fundamental change. It credits the left\nwing of the Wang Yangming school for further unleashing the potentials\nof this liberating precept by espousing individualism and voluntarism\nthat signified moral autonomy. Furthermore, it argues that the Qing\nbelief in the possibility of \u201cobjective\u201d investigations of\nthe classics should be examined in the context of the\n\u201csubjectivism\u201d that unified the Song, Yuan, and Ming\nphilosophical views. This scholarship also explores the import of late\nimperial Chinese thought in terms of the idea of multiple early\nmodernities in world history, to the extent that the late Ming and\nQing witnessed the workings of the particular historical dynamics of\n\u201cearly modern\u201d (sen kindai) China, manifested in\nthe new conceptions of self and society that were reformulations of\nsome central leitmotifs and polarities in traditional Confucian\nthinking (Shimada 1970; Mizoguchi 1980).\n\nBe it the comparative or developmental approach, the contention is\nthat Chinese thought experienced notable changes in the late imperial\nperiod, roughly from the late Ming through the mid Qing. While\nscholars argue over the genesis, content, nature, and significance of\nthe new developments, most acknowledge and recognize the patterned\nfundamental shifts in intellectual trends and directions. Some of the\ninterrelated traits of the intellectual redirection included the\nfollowing: fungibility and syncretism in thinking that tended to\nmitigate the authority of received opinions; palpable impulse to\nreorder and manage the world, invoking the ideal of ordering the world\nthrough practical statecraft and statesmanship (jingshi);\ngeneral aversion toward metaphysical speculation and moral\nintrospection, and the corresponding interest in the pursuit of solid\nand practical learning (puxue and shixue), giving\nrise to utilitarian and instrumental notions of scholarship; valuing\npersonal practical experience, academic, political, social and\notherwise, such that one\u2019s actions in the phenomenal and\nexternal worlds loomed large; historicization of the classics\n(jing) that had hitherto been revered as sources of timeless\nauthority, rendering them into objects of scholarly scrutiny, thereby\nbreeding in time the meticulous scholarship of evidential research and\nlearning, which came to dominate the intellectual world in the\nso-called Qianjia period; preference for limpidity, clarity, and\nsimplicity in writing style and language; and finally, new and\nbroadening horizons of the meaning of community, as the\nliterati\u2019s place in state and society was redefined and\nreconceptualized. To be sure, these interlarded strains of thoughts\nwere by no means new in the Chinese intellectual universe. Yet, from\nthe late Ming on, there seemed to be an unmistakable convergence of\nthe various traits that fostered conceptual commonalities and\nintellectual confluences out of a socio-intellectual environ that was\nnevertheless characterized by manifold sectarian affiliations and\npolemics. Various modes of learning and thinking cohered to forge a\nnew orientation that seemed to give conscious life in the late\nimperial period an identifiable stamp and identity.\n\nThus, late imperial Chinese philosophy, or Qing philosophy, is a\nperiod concept, that is, a substantive designation of an independent\nhistorico-intellectual epoch with a distinct physiognomy, an internal\ncoherence, identifiable mental habit, and autonomous scholarly style,\ndistinguished from the preceding Song-Ming philosophical style and\ncontent, as represented by Neo-Confucianism. The construction of this\nperiod concept is an exercise in intellectual cartography by selecting\nand representing the significant ideational landmarks of an\nintellectual landscape, thereby providing a perspective and knowledge\nof the terrain. The major landmarks are the dominant modes, or\nideal-types, of intellectual articulation, and Qing philosophy sported\nfour\u2014vitalism, historicism, utilitarianism, and intellectualism.\nThey functioned as the basic criteria of intelligibility and\nimportance, offering the fundamental points of view according to which\nlearning was described, measured, valuated, and adjudicated. In the\nprocess, they dislodged and supplanted the moral metaphysics and\ninward ethical introspection of Song-Ming thought, which was premised\non the idea of realizing the totalizing dao (the Way),\nli (principle), and tian (heaven) through\nself-cultivation of the mind-heart (xin). To the extent that\nhumanity\u2019s moral nature (dexing) was endowed by heaven,\nmoral-ethico perfection was the realization of the mandate of heaven\n(tianming), manifested as the ritual order established by the\nancient sages. In Song-Ming thought, apprehending dao/li/tian\nwas not merely an epistemological process, in that knowledge of\ndao/tian/ti was a metapraxis in which virtue, reason,\nknowing, and action converged.\n\nQing philosophy, with vitalism, historicism, utilitarianism and\nintellectualism as its contextual and thematic patterns of thinking\nand articulation, heralded a new phase in Chinese intellectual\nhistory, interrogating antecedent concepts and ushering in new\napproaches. I use these \u201cisms\u201d advisedly as terms of art,\nnot technical ones. Vitalism in this context smacks not of the\nBergsonian metaphysical postulation of an \u00e9lan vital,\nand historicism does not appeal to the ancestral nomenclature of\nHegelian dialectics. Utilitarianism appeals not to Bentham\u2019s\nconsequentialist philosophy, and intellectualism elides the Socratic\nor Thomistic reference to rationality and ratiocination. Vitalism, in\nthe context of Qing thought, is a reference to the Neo-Confucian\nphilosophy of qi, commonly rendered into English as material\nforce or psycho-physical force. It denotes a view of reality that\nfocuses attention in large part to the evidence provided by life\ngrasped from within a body, the self, or external thing. This evidence\nrevealed embodied experience to be composed of concrete tendencies and\noccurrences not readily reduced to or dissolved in metaphysical\nspeculation or conception, such as the ontological notion of principle\n(li) or heaven (tian). Historicism describes the\nmental habit and endeavor to find and establish meaning in history as\nit was made by human agents, shunning supra-temporal principles and\ntranscendent norms of universal validity, such as the idea of the\nconstant Way (dao), and savoring instead the contingent and\nparticular in varying and changing contexts. Utilitarianism takes its\ncue from the Confucian activist ideal of \u201cordering the world by\nextending utility and function to the fullest\u201d (jingshi\nzhiyong), privileging the functional component of yong (utility)\nover ti (the essential substance of things) in the\nti-yong polarity that represented the interacting inner and\nouter realms of reality. Just as it gave priority to outer efforts of\nacting as opposed to the inner quiddity of being, so it presumed an\nintimate relation between knowledge and action in the experiential\nworld. Intellectualism is an abstraction from the Confucian external\ncultivational goal of \u201cfollowing the way of inquiry and\nlearning\u201d (dao wenxue), which placed a premium on\ndiscursive knowledge and scholarly pursuit as the means to comprehend\nthe classics, understood as the textual encasement and manifestations\nof the profound principles of the ancient sages. In time, it bred the\ncritical evidentiary research (kaozheng) that sought to\nthoroughly reveal the sages\u2019 teachings and messages via\nphilology.\n\nTo be sure, these modes of intellectual articulation were not entirely\nnew, but it was in the Qing that they coalesced, and they were\nemphasized and valued at the expense of other approaches. Hence the\nemergence of Qing philosophy as a coherent and integrated system of\nideas in terms of which reality and the world were understood.\n2. Vitalism: Metaphysical Reorientation\n\nVitalism as an expression of Qing philosophy focused on evidence\nprovided by the self, the body, and external things. Opposed to the\nmysticism of an eternal and transcendent creative power such as\nprinciple (li), heaven (tian) or the Way\n(dao) that represented the essence of being, vitalism was in\nfavor of a view of life grasped from within the actualities of the\nindividual self and the external world. It stressed the immediate and\nultimate completion of a concrete and dynamic life expressed in terms\nof qi (material force/psycho-physical force) and qi\n(concrete implements). It may be conceived as a dynamic monism:\ndynamic in the sense that it rejected an immutable dao in\nfavor of a relativized way of contingent and finite truths; and\nmonistic in that it dissolved the li-qi dichotomy, subsuming\nli, which had been considered to be the prior metaphysical\nand spiritual realm, under qi, the perceptual and\nexperiential realm that had been regarded as secondary. Life within\nthe vitalist framework was dependent on circumstances, particularized,\nand individualized by the external signs of the self\u2019s\ncontingency and finitude, including the senses, feelings, desires, and\nemotions. Scholars of late imperial Chinese thought, such as Theodore\nbe Bary, Irene Bloom, and Yamanoi Y\u016b , have pointed to the\ngrowing preponderance of this qi-based vitalist philosophy\nsince the late Ming period, which offered a new sense of coherence in\nthe thinking about individuals and the world. But it would be\nmisleading to characterize Qing philosophy as entirely grounded in\nsome sort of formalized qi-oriented metaphysics, to the\nextent that philosophical lucubration in terms of the Confucian\ncategories of li and qi had ceased to hold the\nimagination of the thinkers. While qi, representing the\nmaterial and experiential domain of life, did become ascendant in\nintellectual discourse, the Qing posture was distinctly averse to\nmetaphysical pondering. Vitalism, with qi as its predicate,\nwas a pervasive attitude that attached foremost importance to concrete\nrealities and actions, inverting the Neo-Confucian metaphysical\ntendency to reduce humanity and things to an attribute, manifestation,\nand appearance of li and dao. Qi now\nreigned supreme.\n\nIn the early Qing, the most systematic articulation of the vitalist\nphilosophy can be found in the writings of Wang Fuzhi\n(1619\u20131692), who expanded the qi-based metaphysics of\nthe celebrated Song master, Zhang Zai (1020\u20131077). Wang asserted\nthat qi was what li followed. He claimed: \n\n\nIn actuality, li exists within qi. Qi is nothing but\nli. When [qi] agglomerates and produces humanity and\nthings, forms (xing) appear. When [qi] disperses\ninto the supreme void (taixu), it is then formless. (Wang\nQSYS: 1:5b) \n\n\nWhile li and qi were one, it was the latter that\ngave reality its form. In fact, qi was the basic stuff of the\nultimate supreme void, as Wang averred: \n\n\nTo say that humanity is born without the nourishment of qi,\nthat li could be sought outside of qi, that forms\nare illusions, and that the nature (xing) is real, is to\ndegenerate into heterodoxy. (QSYS: 1:6b) \n\n\nIt is important to note that even though Wang followed Zhang, he\nrejected the latter\u2019s philosophical anthropology, which\nseparated humanity\u2019s so-called \u201cheaven-nature\u201d\nstemming from li from its \u201cphysical nature\u201d\nderived from qi. Wang told us:\n\n\nWhen one speaks of the physical nature, it is like saying that the\nnature lies within the matter of qi (qizhi). This\nmatter (zhi) is humanity\u2019s material form (qizhi zhi\nxing), within the confines of which the principle of life\n(sheng zhi li) is manifested. Since it [i.e., the principle\nof life] lies within this matter, qi permeates it, and just\nas what fills the universe both inside and outside the human body is\nnothing but qi, so it is nothing but principle. Principle\noperates within qi, where it controls and apportions\nqi. Thus the matter [of individual things] envelops\nqi, and qi envelops principle. It is because this\nmatter envelops qi that a given individual possesses a\nnature. For this reason, before one\u2019s development has taken\nplace, there can only be the li and qi of the\nuniverse but not the individual person. Once, however, there is the\nmatter incorporating qi, this qi then inevitably\npossesses principle. As far as humanity is concerned\u2026, this\nnature as found in the matter of qi [i.e., physical nature]\nis still the original nature. (quoted in McMorran 1975: 443)\n\n\nIn short, Wang contended that our so-called physical nature was the\noriginal nature, by no means secondary to our heaven-nature. He,\nunlike Zhang, did not attribute our aggressiveness and aggrandizement\nto the inferior qi of the physical nature. Wang saw both\nprinciple and human desires (yu) as natural (ziran).\nThe tradition of ritual-propriety (li) expressed our desires:\n\n\n\nAlthough ritual propriety is purely the external adornment of the\nprinciple of heaven, it must reside in human desires for it to be\nseen. That being the case, in the final analysis, there cannot be a\nheaven that is separate from humanity, or principle separate from\ndesires\u2026. Hence in sounds, colors, smells, and flavors, one can\nclearly see the communal desires (gongyu) of all beings and\ntheir communal principle (gongli). (Wang QSYS: 8:10b-11a)\n\n\n\nTo Wang, the way of kingship (wangdao) was also intimately\nrelated to human sentiments (renqing): \n\n\nThe way of kingship is based on human sentiments. Human sentiments are\nthe same sentiments shared by both the profound person\n(junzi) and petty person (xiaoren)\u2026. Mencius,\nunderstanding thoroughly the origin of the oneness of heaven\u2019s\nprinciple (tianli) and human sentiments, recognized the\npossibility of the way of kingship. After seeing the beginning, it\ncould then be extended and expanded\u2026. Heaven\u2019s principle\nresides in private desires (siyu). (Wang QSYS: 26:2a-3b)\n\n\nThus, Wang connected values\u2014ritual-propriety, the way of\nkingship, communal principle\u2014with private feelings, as the body\nand its affections became a locus of ethical experience,\nli-principle. In explicating the idea of \u201cfully\nrealizing our nature\u201d (jinxing), he argued that\neverything in the world was of the same origin as oneself. Therefore,\nthe individual was the fulcrum on which the world moved, and this\nmandated an active life. Practice, or xi, was the key to\nexhaustively realizing and fulfilling our nature, which was the\nnurturing of our very qi: \n\n\nAs for changing the bad to the good, it is a matter of nurturing\none\u2019s qi well. In time, one\u2019s substance\n(zhi) is altered accordingly\u2026. This is human ability,\nwhich is practice precisely. Thus, qi changes with practice,\nand nature is realized with practice. Substance is the residence of\nnature, nature is the regulating of qi, and qi is\nthe substantiation of substance. [Qi] is what practice can\ncontrol. (Wang QSYS: 7:11a-b) \n\n\nIn short, Wang not only collapsed the li-qi dyad into the\nmonism of qi but he also understood qi, the basic\nstuff of the universe, in terms of human agency and action.\n\nGu Yanwu (1613\u20131682), also saw qi as the generative\nforce in the cosmos: \n\n\nReplete in heaven-and-earth is qi. When qi prospers,\nit becomes shen (spirit). Shen is the qi of\nheaven-and-earth and the human mind. (Gu RZL: 1:20) \n\n\nHe continue to say, \n\n\nCoalescing to form a body is called wu (things/affairs);\ndispersal in a shapeless manner is called bian\n(change)\u2026. Coalescing is the coalescing of qi;\ndispersal is the dispersing of qi. (RZL: 1:20) \n\n\nQi was self-sufficient and all-pervasive, identified with\nthings, objects, events, and affairs, without which \u201cthe\ndao has nowhere to reside\u201d (RZL: 1:20). Similarly,\nHuang Zongxi (1610\u20131695), a polymath who was Gu Yanwu\u2019s\nand Wang Fuzhi\u2019s contemporary, saw the inextricable conflation\nof li and qi as a foremost ontological fact:\n\u201cLi is the li of qi. If there is no\nqi, then there is no li\u201d (Huang MRXA: 140).\nTheir difference rests merely on semantics: \n\n\nThe terms li and qi are made up by people. In\nspeaking of the phenomena of floating, submerging, rising, and\nfalling, there is qi. In speaking of the unmistakable laws of\nfloating, submerging, rising, and falling, there is li. In\nthe end, they are the two names of one entity, not two entities in one\nbeing. (Huang MRXA: 1064) \n\n\nHe further explained, \n\n\nWithin heaven-and-earth, there is only one qi. Its rise and\nfall, and comings and goings, are the li. Apprehended by a\nperson\u2026 [li] becomes the mind-heart, which is also\nqi. If qi is not self-governed, why is it that after\nspring, there inevitably come summer, autumn, and winter? What\ncontrols the blossoming and withering of plans, the mildness and\nruggedness of the topography, the good and the bad movements of\nastrological portents, and the birth and growth of humanity and\nthings? All are governed by qi. Since it is self-governed, it\nis called li. (Huang MRXA: 46) \n\n\nHuang dissolved the li-qi duality by arguing that li\nby itself did not exist, insofar as it was an abstraction of the\nmaterial and the experiential.\n\nIn anthropological terms, Huang remarked that \n\n\nwhat in heaven is qi is the mind-heart in humanity. What in\nheaven is li is the nature in humanity. Just as li\nand qi are the same, so too are the mind-heart and nature.\n(Huang MRXA: 1109)\n\n\nHere, Huang critiqued Zhu Xi\u2019s (1130\u20131200) tendency to\nseparate the original human nature from the mind-heart, which was the\nsite of sentiments and feelings of \u201cpleasure, anger, sorrow, and\njoy\u201d. To Huang, these emotions and affections, in their state of\n\u201cequilibrium and harmony\u201d, are the nature. Therefore, \n\n\nto seek the nature outside of this cognitively natural and\nself-regulating mind-heart is like abandoning the flexible and\nchanging qi in order to seek a separate li. (Huang\nMRXA: 1109\u20131110) \n\n\nHuang thus invested human feelings with the steadfast solidity of the\nontological substance of qi, which was the source of the\ncardinal virtues of ren (benevolence), yi\n(rightness), li (propriety) and zhi (wisdom): \n\n\nReplete in heaven-and-earth is qi. Movement of this one\nqi in the human mind-heart\u2026 naturally separates into\npleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy. Accordingly, the names of\nbenevolence, rightness, propriety, and wisdom arise. Separate from\nqi, there is no li; separate from the mind-heart,\nthere is no nature. (Huang MRXA: 1512) \n\n\nThe early Qing vitalist philosophy of qi found full\nexpression in the eighteenth century, which witnessed a strong\naffirmation of the primacy of materiality. In particular, Dai Zhen\n(1723\u20131777) systematically developed a philosophy based on the\npresupposition that the dao was constituted by things: \n\n\nDao is the name that refers to actual bodies and actual\naffairs\u2026. Speaking of the dao in terms of\nheaven-and-earth, it can readily be seen with reference to its actual\nbodies and actual affairs\u2026. Speaking of the dao in\nterms of humanity, it is the concrete affairs of quotidian\npracticality in human relations that pervade the dao\u2026.\nNone that arise from the body are not the dao\u2026. The\ndao is living, drinking, eating, talking, and moving.\nOne\u2019s self and what surround oneself are all appropriately\n[regarded as the dao]. (Dai MZZYSZ: 69\u201372) \n\n\nDai criticized the Song Neo-Confucians for artificially separating\nmoral values from everyday social relations and activities, insofar as\nthey identified the moral virtues of benevolence, rightness,\npropriety, and wisdom with the \u201cempty, boundless, and\nsubtle\u201d principle, which, being prior and primary, was\n\u201cabove the realm of corporeal forms\u201d (xing er\nshang), as opposed to diurnal actions and pursuits, which was\nseen to be \u201camidst the realm of corporeal forms\u201d (xing\ner xia) and therefore, posterior and secondary. As far as Dai was\nconcerned, such axiology could find no corroboration in the classics:\n\n\n\n[The Song Confucians claimed that] with respect to heaven-and-earth,\nyin-yang cannot be called the dao; with respect to humanity,\nthe physical endowment (qibing) cannot be called the nature\n(xing), and affairs and things of daily practicality in human\nrelations cannot be called the Way (dao). There is nothing in\nthe texts of the Six Classics, Confucius, and\nMencius that agrees with them. (Dai MZZYSZ: 71\u201372)\n\n\nTo Dai, principle was not abstract and transcendent: \u201cWith\nregard to heaven-and-earth, humanity and things, and affairs and\nactions, I have not heard of a principle that cannot be verbally\narticulated\u201d (Dai MZZYSZ: 38). Li, as the inner texture\nof things (tiaoli), did not exist in the mind-heart as a\nmetaphysical entity and was found in the midst of all things. Indeed,\nit could not be severed from human feelings (qing) and\ndesires (yu). Dai differentiated between what was naturally\n(ziran) and what was necessarily so (biran): \n\n\nThe desires of the nature are the signs of the natural. The virtue of\nthe nature is conducive to the attainment of what was necessarily so.\nWhat is conducive to the attainment of what was necessarily so\nconforms to and perfects what is natural about heaven-and-earth. This\nis called the utmost attainment of that which is naturally so. (quoted\nin Y\u00fc Ying-shih 1982: 386) \n\n\nWhat were naturally so were the desires and daily activities of human\nbeings; that which was necessarily so was the inner texture of the\nnatural, that is, principle. The natural was the foundation on which\nthe necessitarian principle rested: \n\n\nThe ears, the eyes, and all the other bodily organs desire those\nthings on which our physical nature (qizhi zhi xing) depends\nfor nourishment. The so-called human desires of human nature originate\nfrom the Way of the formation and transformation of heaven-and-earth\n(tiandao). In the case of humanity, they are rooted in human\nnature and expressed in daily affairs. In this sense, they constitute\nthe Way of humanity (rendao). (Chung-ying Cheng 1971: 76).\n\n\n\nSince desires, as integral parts of the physical nature, constituted\nboth the Way of humanity and the Way of heaven, human nature could not\nbe, as the Song masters had contended, bifurcated into its\nmoral-heavenly manifestation and material-earthly disclosure. Dai\nasserted that the nature, xing, was whole, comprising both\nblood and breath (xueqi)\u2014the\npsycho-physiological\u2014and the mind-heart and wisdom\n(xinzhi)\u2014the cognitive-spiritual.  Both, as a whole,\nwere derived from \u201cyin-yang and the five agents\u201d, and\n\u201coriginated from the process of the production and\ntransformation of heaven-and-earth\u201d (yuan yu tiandi zhi\nhua). He waxed rhetorical, \n\n\nAs for the fact that a person is a person, if physical endowment\n(qibing) and physical constitution (qizhi) are cast\naside, in what way can a person be described as a person? (Dai MZZYSZ:\n51)\n\n\nDai\u2019s arguments struck at the heart of the Neo-Confucian\nmetaphysical conception of principle, the Way of heaven, and moral\nnature as prior and fundamentally substantive. Instead, he construed\nqi as the basic stuff out of which all things and the nature\nwere wrought, and in the process, he stressed the materiality and\nconcreteness of all beings.\n\nIn sum, a vitalist sensibility animated the philosophical thoughts of\nmany a Qing thinker, placing qi and its manifestations at the\ncenter of life and the world. But we must bear in mind the caveat that\nsuch thinking amounted to no materialism or naturalism in the western\nphilosophical sense of the words. Material human desires in themselves\nwere never considered to be a principle, even though they were\nconceived as integral and authentic components of a holistic nature.\nNevertheless, if it was not full-fledged formal philosophy, the\nqi-based worldview was a fundamental attitude and disposition\nthat located life\u2019s meanings, possibilities, and motives in the\nactualities of the corporeal world. As qi dislodged the\nimportance of li, knowledge acquired through the\nsenses\u2019 commerce with the workaday world (wenjian zhi\nzhi), as opposed to moral knowledge attained through intuitive\nknowing of the virtuous nature (dexing zhi zhi), claimed\npriority. In an a-metaphysical age that was the Qing, there was no\ntriumph of qi-oriented thinking qua philosophy, but a\nvitalist ontology did furnish a criterion of intelligibility that\nundergirded the other modes of intellection\u2014historicism,\nutilitarianism, intellectualism.\n3. Historicism: Contingency and Constancy\n\nNeo-Confucian thought in the Song-Ming times bore a strong dimension\nof ontological ultimacy, such that its criteria of intelligibility may\nbe considered as essentially metaphysical in nature. As the vitalist\nsensibility began to take center stage in the late Ming and early\nQing, there was a shift from the ontological (the essential and\ntranscendent) to the ontic (the contingent and experiential), and the\nlatter came to be expressed as a historicism\u2014a prevailing\nworldview that appreciated changing particulars rather than a\nfoundational metaphysics of eternal universals. Thus, the term\n\u201chistoricism\u201d, as it is used in the context of Qing\nphilosophy, is interchangeable with descriptions such as \u201cthe\nsense of history\u201d, \u201cthe historical\u201d and\n\u201chistorical-mindedness\u201d. Indeed, a permeating sense of\nhistory seemed to have formed a common thread that ran through the\nlearning of the intellectual stalwarts who personified the Ming-Qing\nintellectual transition, such as the aforementioned Wang Fuzhi, Gu\nYanwu, and Huang Zongxi. They pursued their subject-matters, such as\nthe classics, institutions, statecraft, and phonology, by coming to\ngrips with their patterns of development and growth, taking into\naccount their diversity and particularity. They were inclined to\neschew totalizing metaphysical views that conferred on things and\naffairs an underpinning unity. Instead, they embraced a historicist\nperspective that shunned supra-historical principles and transcendent\nnorms, subjecting the investigation of phenomena to a logic of\nbecoming, not being. Lest we exaggerate the extent and influence of\nthis time-bound and relativist historicist perspective, a note of\nreservation and qualification is needed. While the Qing philosophical\nmode of intellection no doubt diverged from the ahistoricist\nNeo-Confucianism that saw history as a function of some ultimate truth\nsuch as li, tian, ordao, it was not\nentirely freed from the belief in some transhistorical and universal\nreality. The historicism in Qing philosophy was fraught with tension,\nto the extent that the appreciation for the particularity was tempered\nby a transhistorical sense of abiding universal order. \n\nOur ideal-typical historicism found expression in Huang Zongxi\u2019s\nand Wang Fuzhi\u2019s efforts to reformulate the Neo-Confucian\nontology. Huang\u2019s historicist sensibility can be seen in the\nvery first lines of his masterpiece, the Mingru xue\u2019an\n(Intellectual Records of Ming Scholars), in which he lay out a\nmetaphysical predicate: \n\n\nThroughout heaven and earth is the mind-heart (xin), whose\nchanges are unpredictable. It is inexorably manifested in myriad\ndifferent forms. The mind-heart has no fundamental substance.\nFundamental substance is that which is achieved by its efficacious\neffort. Therefore, to plumb the principle (li) is to probe\nthe myriad different forms of this mind-heart, not the myriad\ndifferent forms of the myriad things. (Huang MRXA: preface 9) \n\n\nWhile Huang asserted the mind-heart as the point of departure, he\nmoved away from the orientations of the so-called learning of the\nmind-heart (xinxue) in Neo-Confucianism. Instead of focusing\non \u201cfundamental substance\u201d, Huang emphasized\n\u201cefforts\u201d. Rather than moving inward toward the\nmind-heart, Huang\u2019s position drifted outward into the outer\nphysical phenomenal world, in which there were the ever-changing\n\u201cmyriad different forms\u201d, differences perceived through\nthe one mind notwithstanding. In other words, although there was the\noverarching universal mind-heart, this mind-heart was no incorporeal\noriginal substance hovering above the concrete variegated world of\nparticularities and efforts. There was no immutable fundamental\nsubstance as such, as the mind-heart was developmental in nature,\nmanifested in the external myriad differences.\n\nHuang also had a dynamic view of institutional evolution. Upon\nexamining the historical origins and evolutions of the various\nspecific institutions, he concluded that imitation of the institutions\ndescribed in the ancient classics was impractical, stating that\n\u201cunder heaven\u2026 there have not been laws and institutions\nthat could not be overthrown\u201d (quoted in Gu Qingmei 1978: 146).\nHuang saw his own time as one bound to a long historical series, as\none segment contiguous with the preceding and succeeding epoch. There\nwere the ancient Three Dynasties with their magnificent order,\nfollowed by two thousand years of disorder after the death of\nConfucius. Now, the time for change had again come. \n\nWang Fuzhi reordered the Neo-Confucian ontology through his\nhistorico-philosophical theory of shi (conditions)\nvis-\u00e0-vis li (principle). Wang accorded principle\npriority as the immanent pattern of all things and affairs, that is,\nas that which is \u201cthe certain\u201d (guran),\n\u201cthe necessary\u201d (biran), \u201cthe\nself-evident\u201d (dangran), \u201cthe why and\nwherefore\u201d (suoyiran) and \u201cthe natural\u201d\n(ziran). But principle was embedded in concrete\npsycho-physical force (qi) and manifested in actual\nconditions: \n\n\nTherefore, originally, there is principle which can be readily seen in\nmaterial force. Accordingly, this obtained principle naturally becomes\nconditions. Thus principle can be seen in these necessary conditions.\n(Wang QSYS: 48:9.5a) \n\n\nPrinciple and conditions should always \u201cbe discussed\nsyncretically as a whole\u201d (Wang QSYS: 48:9.5a-b). This\nrelational integrity presumed that the primacy of principle was\npredicated on the immediacy of differentiation: \u201cConditions\nbecome different when times are different; principle also becomes\ndifferent when conditions are different\u201d (Wang QSYS: 58:15.3b).\nLi-qi as a totality represented the universe as complex\nphenomena of perpetually appearing contingencies, subject to the\nworkings of human agency: \u201cWhen one accords with the times, one\ncomplies with that which the time makes inevitable in order to save\noneself, and so escape from disaster\u201d (quoted in McMorran 1975:\n457).\n\nAs with Huang Zongxi, Wang Fu-chih saw the development of institutions\nthrough a historicist perspective. The institutions of each age were\ncompositely the shi, or conditions sui generis. They\nwere the Way of that age, which human beings with volitions and\ntransformative leverage followed. Every age had its own appropriate\ninstitutions: \n\n\nThe rule of every epoch should be in accordance with its own time,\nestablishing [the particular] institutions of an epoch\u2026. Never\nhas there been the successful establishment of governance as a result\nof imitating the one merit of just the one thing of the ancients, or\nchampioning one ancient thing, obtrusively injected into the present.\n(Wang QSYS: 21:5b-6a) \n\n\nEven the Classics prescribed no unchanging models: \n\n\nAs to setting up schemes or arranging for details, neither the\nBook of History nor Confucius said anything about\nthem\u2026. Because the ancient institutions were meant to govern\nthe ancient world and cannot be followed today, the superior man does\nnot base his activities on them, and because what is suitable today\ncan govern the world of today but will not necessarily for the future,\nthe superior man does not hand it down to posterity as a model.\n(quoted in Chan 1963: 701)\n\n\nGu Yanwu, unlike Huang and Wang, eschewed metaphysical pondering\naltogether. He advanced the view that dynamic historical change was\nthe rule of the day with regard to institutional development. The\nvalue of institutions was determined by the contexts of both their\norigins and their subsequent functional uses. He, for instance,\nhammered home this message in his proposal to reform the\nweisuo (guard and battalion) military system of the late Ming\ndynasty: \n\n\nWithout the change of institutions, current problems cannot be\nrectified. If in a circumstance where change is inevitable, one still\nconceals the actuality of [the need for] change and obstinately clings\nto the position of not changing, it will certainly lead to the gravest\nof calamities. (Gu GTLSWJ: 128) \n\n\nThere must be periodic reforms to forestall calamities: \n\n\nIf we understand that the feudal system changed into the prefectural\nsystem, we also understand that as the prefectural system in turn\nfalls into decay, it too must change. Does it mean that there will be\na return to feudalism? No, this is impossible. But if some sage who\ncould invest the prefectural system with the essential meaning of\nfeudalism were to appear, then the world would attain order\u2026.\nNow, the defects of the prefectural [system] have developed to their\nutmost\u2026. But still, it was followed in all its details. That is\nwhy the livelihood of people is diminishing daily; that is why China\nis growing weaker daily. (GTLSWJ: 12)\n\n\nBut it is noteworthy that while Huang, Wang, and Gu argued for\nexpedient change relative to the time and its particular conditions,\nthey all subscribed to the universal values ensconced in the ancient\nClassics. Huang embraced the enduring principles bequeathed by the\nancient Three Dynasties. In his famous Mingyi daifang lu (A\nPlan for the Prince), he affirmed the constancy of the ancient\nprinciple of governance which was, in brief, unswerving devotion to\npromoting the interests and benefits of the people: \n\n\nWhen the sagely rulers appeared, they did not treat their own profits\nas profits, but would seek to benefit the world. [They did] not regard\nharm to themselves as the only harm, but would seek to release the\nworld from harm. They had to work thousands of times harder than other\npeople in the world. (Huang MYDFL: 2) \n\n\nWang Fuzhi also posited timeless principle in the historical process\nof governance. He balanced the particularities of the dynasties\nagainst the constant principles of the Classics: \n\n\nFor the best way of government, there is nothing better than to\nexamine the Classic of Documents and modify it with the words\nof Confucius. But the central point is whether the ruler\u2019s heart\nis serious or dissolute\u2026. The great function of government is\nto make use of worthy men and promote education. In dealing with\npeople, it should bestow humanity and love to the highest degree.\nWhether in the government of Yao and Shun, in the Three Dynasties, or\n[in the period] from the Qin and Han down to the present, in no case\ncan these principles not be extended and applied. (quoted in Chan\n1963: 701) \n\n\nWang saw excellence in the ancient sage-rulers\u2019 achievements and\nthus regarded historical changes as divergence from the Golden Past.\nGu Yanwu also enjoined rulers to uphold the Confucian \u201cfour\nbonds\u201d (siwei) as the overarching principles that\nguided history: \n\n\nPropriety (li) and righteousness (i) are the supreme\nways in ruling people. Integrity (lian) and the sense of\nshame (chi) are the great principles in cultivating humanity.\nWithout integrity, there is nothing that is not coveted; without the\nsense of shame, there is no [wicked] deed that is not committed. If\npeople are like that, catastrophe, failure, disorder, and death will\ncome. (Gu RZL: 5:53) \n\n\nIn his Records of Daily Knowledge (Rizhi lu), Gu\nsurveyed the entire course of Chinese history, from the Zhou to his\nown time, and concluded that only when ethics and morals were\nchampioned that peace and prosperity could be attained.\n\nThus, Huang, Wang, and Gu\u2019s admiration of the ancient past\nimbued their historicism with a sense of ultimacy achieved once upon a\ntime. While they might not be seeking literal return to the past, they\nbetrayed their yearning for the constant and the transhistorical.\nTheir goal of encrusting measures apposite to current needs with\nancient principles suggested that there was more to history than the\ncontingencies and expediencies of any one time.\n\nThe mid-Qing witnessed the predominance of the intellectualist pursuit\nof evidential research (kaozheng), with particular regard to\nthe exegetical and philological investigations of the classics, driven\nby the fundamentalist goal to retrieve the antique Way enshrined in\nthe classical texts. Nevertheless, when the classics and antiquity\nwere subjected to meticulous scrutiny and rigorous examination, the\nancient past came to be interrogated and problematized. Which were the\nauthentic classics? Which part of antiquity was to be restored? How\nshould we go about apprehending the past? Therefore, what began as a\nclassicization of antiquity aimed at cutting through the Neo-Confucian\nmetaphysical babel ended as a partial historicization of the classics.\nThe ancient past and the classics became objects in time to\nbe studied, thereby given their historicity. The works and thoughts of\nDai Zhen (1724\u201377) and Zhang Xuecheng (1738\u20131801)\nexemplified the historicist temper of the time.\n\nDai Zhen, as we have seen, contended that everything had its\nprinciple, which varied in accordance with the thing itself.\nUniversality was broken into particularities, such that principle\n(li) was the \u201cinner texture of things\u201d\n(tiaoli), the organizational pattern and textural\nconfiguration of the psycho-physical force (qi), manifested\nas \u201cliving, drinking, eating, talking and acting\u201d (Dai\nMZZYSZ: 110\u2013113). Dai questioned the notion of an essential\nprinciple invariant through time through his idea of \u201cexpedient\nweighing of circumstances\u201d (quan), associated with the\nidea of change (bian): \n\n\nWith quan, the insignificant and important can be\ndistinguished\u2026. Constancy refers to the obvious insignificant\nand important [things], observed by all throughout time. As for the\nimportant becoming insignificant, or insignificant becoming important,\nit is change (bian). Change cannot be fully known without the\ncorrect measure resulting from intelligent exhaustive observations and\ninvestigations. (MZZYSZ: 125) \n\n\nConsequently, right and wrong (shifei) should be gauged in\nrelationship to expediency: \n\n\nObstinately adhering to the apparently important and insignificant as\nseen by all, [many people] affirm what is right, and criticize what is\nwrong. In fact, [they] do not realize that timely expediency renders\nthe important into the insignificant, the insignificant important.\n(MZZYSZ: 128) \n\n\nIn his masterly essay, \u201cProbing the Original Goodness\u201d\n(Yuanshan), Dai identified expediency as one of the\ncharacteristics of the pervading common virtue of\n\u201cgoodness\u201d (shan): \u201cBecause of its\ncoherence with changes, it is called the norm of expediency\u201d\n(Chung-ying Cheng 1971: 68). This appreciation for change was\ntransposed epistemologically into Dai\u2019s preoccupation with\nmeticulous examination of the origins and developments of multifarious\nthings in history: ancient pronunciations of characters, attire and\ncostumes, changes in place names, implements of the artisans,\nnomenclature and categories of fauna and flora, mathematics, musical\ninstruments, and the like. The principles and meanings of the sages,\nand indeed the Way itself, had to be found in the actual\n\u201cstatutes, laws, institutions and measures\u201d (Dai DZWJ:\n145), that is, things in the historical records.\n\nYet, there was no consistent historicism in Dai\u2019s philosophy.\nHis conception of change was ultimately constrained by his abiding\nsense of the ultimacy of \u201cthe necessary\u201d (biran):\n\n\n\nThe Odes says, \u201cWhere there is a thing, there is a\nrule\u201d. \u201cThing\u201d is the name for an actual body and an\nactual matter. \u201cRule\u201d is the name for its primary\nfundamental quintessence. All actual bodies and actual matters are\nnatural, which ultimately return to the necessary. (Dai MZZYSZ: 60)\n\n\n\nThe \u201cprimary fundamental quintessence\u201d and \u201cthe\nnecessary\u201d, in space and time respectively, denoted the totality\nof all beings. Individuality was simply a variation or expression of\nthe totalizing Way, or common goodness: \n\n\n[G]oodness is used to mean what is inherent in humanity [and\nthings.]\u2026 The so-called goodness is nothing other than the\nformation and transformation of heaven-and-earth and the function and\ncapacities of nature. (Chung-ying Cheng 1971: 33\u201334) \n\n\nIndividual nature was the result of the \u201callotment\u201d\n(fen) by the \u201cdao of heaven\u201d.\nOne\u2019s destiny, as mandated by the Way of heaven, accounted for\none\u2019s individual nature: \u201cThe limit set by\n[Heaven\u2019s] allotment is called destiny which, in producing a\nkind of constitution, is called nature\u201d (1971: 2) This\nfoundational perspective of inexorability became in Dai\u2019s\nclassical learning the confirmation of the universality of the\nsages\u2019 ancient values: \n\n\nIf we do not seek to understand the utterances and deeds of the\nancient sages, there is no way we can investigate their mind [which\npervades] the ensuing thousands of years. Therefore, it is through\n[the study of] the Classics, mathematics, institutions and categories\nof things that [the meaning of their] language can be comprehended,\nthereby meeting them with one mind. (Dai DZWJ: 177)\n\n\nDai Zhen\u2019s philosophy was inspired by faith in the eternality of\nthe ancient Way, concerned with effecting the return of a moral system\nalready established in antiquity. Yet, this return was enabled only by\nthe examination of the historical records, which yielded a keen\nawareness of differentness, particularity, individuality and\ncontingency\u2014a historicist sensibility. Dai juxtaposed the\nclassics (the Way/dao) and history\n(expediency/quan), such that historical pursuits were\ncomplementary with fundamentalist classical studies aimed at restoring\nancient truths.\n\nA testimonial of the synthesis of history and classics was Zhang\nXuecheng\u2019s famous statement in his Wenshi tongyi\n(General principles of literature and history): \u201cThe\nSix Classics are all histories\u201d. He further said, \u201cThe\nancients never did talk of principles separated from affairs. The Six\nClassics are the statutes and records of the government of the ancient\nrulers\u201d (Zhang WSTY: 2). These claims formed the foundation of\nZhang\u2019s view of history: history referred to the history of the\ninstitutions and laws of antiquity, and principles could only be\ndiscussed with reference to actual events\u2014history. If the\nclassics were time-bound, that is, within antiquity, then the\ndao resided therein was temporally circumscribed: \n\n\nThe meanings concealed in what had occurred once upon a time [in\nantiquity] can be adequately explained through glossing and\netymological study of the [classical] texts. As to the development of\nevents which occurred thereafter, the classics could not have anything\nto say. (WSTY: 42) \n\n\nThe classics recorded only the laws and institutions of the ancient\nrulers, the material realities of the ancient Way: \n\n\nThe learning of the Three Dynasties recognized only history and not\nthe classics. [It was because it] was intimately related to human\naffairs\u2026. [O]ne who talks about human nature and heaven\u2019s\nmandate must study history. (WSTY: 52) \n\n\nIn order to know the dao-in-history, one had to examine the\nentire course of history. Recent history revealed the recent Way, and\nancient history shed light on the ancient one. Consequently, Zhang\npromoted the study of current history and the development of an\nawareness of \u201cvaluing the institutions of the current\nruler\u201d. Learning involved investigations of the existing\ninstitutions closely connected to human relations and daily utility.\nNo matter how advanced scholarship on the ancient past was, without\nknowing the present, it would be \u201cinappropriate for practical\napplication\u201d (WSTY: 53).\n\nBut Zhang did not see the past simply as successive parades of\nrelative spatial forms and temporal segments. Instead of\nparticularizing the ancient past and the classics once and for all,\nZhang often sought in them the universally normative. The\ndao-in-history pertained to the pattern of change of the\npolitical, social and institutional polity, things such as\n\u201cgovernment, pedagogy, marking out boundaries, delimiting\nprefectures, well-field system, feudalism and education\u201d (WSTY:\n34). These were changing forms of life relative to their own place and\ntime, embodying their own Way. But overarching these particular Ways\nwas the transhistorical dao of the ancient sages, enshrined\nin the classics, which Zhang called the \u201cthe essential\nWay\u201d (daoti): \n\n\nThe essential Way leaves nothing unembodied. It is exhaustively\nexplicated in the Six Classics. The various other philosophers were\nable to write at all, maintaining their well-reasoned viewpoints and\nmaking logical sense, because [they] invariably had attained\n[understanding] of one aspect of the essential dao. (WSTY:\n16\u201317) \n\n\nThis transhistorical Way was thus the provenance of all learning and\nphilosophy. Elsewhere, Zhang regarded this Way as \u201cmoral-ritual\nteachings\u201d (mingjiao): \n\n\nWhat the ancient sage-rulers showed the world to enlighten the people\nwere nothing but [their] moral-ritual teachings. Since ancient times,\nnone have achieved peace without moral-ritual teachings. (WSTY: 95)\n\n\n\nMoral-ritual teachings were the very stuff and source of governance.\nWhen Zhang urged that post-antiquity history be examined independently\nof the Six Classics, he did not aim at demolishing the classics\u2019\nsacral authority. He only cautioned against any literal usage of them\nin historical endeavors, which could swamp all sense of change after\nthe Three Dynasties. Zhang enjoined us to \u201cvalue summing up the\nessence of the principles of the Six Classics and narrate events in\ntime in order to probe the great dao\u201d (WSTY: 42).\nHistory, in a sense, was the unfurling of this authoritative\n\u201cgreat Way\u201d (dadao), the meanings and messages of\nwhich were expounded in the classics: \n\n\nThe great meaning of the Six Classics is brilliant as the sun and\nmoon. [The lessons of] losses and gains in the Three Dynasties can be\nprojected [as guides for the subsequent] hundred ages. (WSTY: 50) \n\n\nThus, in the \u201cessential dao\u201d, the \u201cgreat\ndao\u201d or the essential and great \u201cmoral-ritual\nteachings\u201d, Zhang\u2019s historicism was dissolved.\n\nAs the cases of Dai Zhen and Zhang Xuecheng show, Qing thought\ninvolved the rethinking of the individual as a historical being who\nverified the validity of institutions and laws through the authority\nof history, resisting values and norms that were conceived as the\nformulaic good applied to all times and cases. Yet, it dislodged\nno telos of the ancient Way, as a mainspring of Qing\nphilosophy was surely the retrieval of the dao of the\nclassics. Historicism as a means of evaluating the past achieved no\nhegemony. What occurred was a critical hermeneutical exploration of\nthe ancient classics and writings. Within the boundaries of the\ninherited intellectual tradition, the classicist endeavors bred a\nhistoricist sensibility, problematizing the nature of the Way as the\nembodiment of truth-in/above-history. This historicism signified a\ndiscursive tension that placed a strain on an intellectual field, but\none nevertheless circumscribed by age-old Confucian values.\n4. Utilitarianism: Thought and Action\n\nIn traditional China, the Confucian literati did not consider thought\nand learning to be separate from action in the public world at large.\nThey were, in fact, much inspired by a beatific vision of a public\nspace in which social and political actions yielded a world of peace\nand order. In the classic text, Doctrine of the Mean\n(Zhongyong), the profound paradigmatic person\n(junzi) is described as one who reverently realizes\none\u2019s virtuous, heaven-conferred nature, and pursues inquiry and\nlearning. The Great Learning (Daxue) further tells\nus that these efforts have a three-pronged end: cultivating the self\n(xiuxin), ordering the state (zhiguo), and bringing\npeace to the world (ping tianxia). Thus, the individuated\ninternal goal of achieving sagehood (neisheng) is\ninextricably bound to the outer concerns of implementing the Way of\nkingship (waiwang). In contradistinction to Plato\u2019s or\neven Hegel\u2019s otherworldly philosophy\u2014Plato saw the\nphilosopher as one whose body (not mind) inhabited the city of his\nfellow human beings, and Hegel viewed philosophy as a world stood on\nits head, from the vantage point of commonsense\u2014Confucianism\nregarded the world of workaday affairs as coterminous with the world\nof ideas in which thinkers dwelled. The abiding ideal of\n\u201cordering the world and extending utility\u201d (jingshi\nzhiyong) demanded the conjugation of private moral cultivation\nand its public realization. In Qing philosophy, there was this\npalpable intellectual purport based on the utilitarian ideal of\nordering the world, which bred a moral seriousness about the everyday\nrealities of society and state. This utilitarianism posited an\nintimate relation between thought and action, regarding as\ninsignificant or irrelevant metaphysical concepts that resisted\ntranslation into some form of effort leading to concrete outcomes. The\ncorollaries of xue (learning) and zhi (knowing) were\nyong (utility) and xing (action).\n\nTo be sure, this utilitarianism was not devoid of moral and normative\nimperatives, to the extent that actions had to be inspired and guided\nby values such as moral rulership (wang), rightness and\nintegrity (yi), and public-mindedness (gong). At the\nsame time, it embraced an ethical perspective that invested value in\nthe utility and function of secular, institutional amelioration. From\nthe late Ming onward, thought did gravitate far more toward\nactualities and practicalities, as the ideal and slogan of\njingshi, ordering the world, took center stage. Gu Yanwu\nloathed what he considered to be the \u201cempty and vacuous\nlearning\u201d (kongxu zhi xue) in the Ming times, which\n\n\n\ndisposed of and refrained from talking about the ills and deprivations\nwithin the four seas, and spoke always about lofty imperceptible\nsubtlety and absolute holistic purity. (Gu GTLSWJ: 43) \n\n\nFollowing the examples of the sages who never severed the ties between\nlearning and socio-political concerns, Gu proclaimed that \n\n\nhe would not pursue any learning that does not relate to the central\nprinciple of the Six Classics and the affairs and responsibilities in\nthe current world. \n\n\nJust as \n\n\nall the books written by them [the sages] were for the purpose of\ndiscarding the wrong and returning to the right, and of changing\ncustoms and practices so as to attain order and harmony, (GTLSWJ: 142)\n\n\n\nso \u201ca profound person pursues learning to illuminate the Way and\nsave the world\u201d (GTLSWJ: 103). Gu wrote his masterwork,\nRecords of Daily Knowledge (Rizhi lu), to urge\nparticipation in society, a life-long endeavor that \u201cdid not end\nuntil death\u201d (si er hou yi). The book formulated\npractical views that would be useful for the rulers: \n\n\nI wrote\u2026the Records of Daily Knowledge, the first part\nof which is on classical studies, the middle part on the way of\ngovernance, and the final part on general experience and general\nknowledge, altogether over thirty fascicles. In the event a prince\nappears, he would discern in it actual practices and affairs. With it,\nhe could elevate this current age to the prosperity of the ancient age\nof order. (GTLSWJ: 103)\n\n\nA similar utilitarian thread ran through Huang Zongxi\u2019s thought.\nHe defined the existential mission of a Confucian profound person,\njunzi, to which everyone should aspire: \u201cTo bring peace\nto the country and to preserve society are the obligations of a\njunzi\u201d (Huang MYDFL: 32). His learning was meant to\nform \u201cthe warp and the woof of heaven-and-earth\u201d\n(jingwei tiandi), and so he criticized scholars for \n\n\ntrying futilely to manage the world by lavish and high-sounding ideas\nof establishing the ultimate in order to regenerate the masses, of\nestablishing the mind-heart of the universe, and of following the\neverlasting peace of the thousand ages. \n\n\nArrogantly, they \n\n\nview those who manage finances and taxation as engaging in hoarding\nprofit and wealth\u2026 and those who carefully supervise\nadministration and government as tawdry officials. \n\n\nBut \n\n\nwhen the day to serve the country comes, they are bemused and\nbefuddled, as though they are sitting within a cloud. Therefore, the\nways of the world (shidao) have become corrupt and rotten.\n(Huang NLWDHJ: vol. 6, p. 549) \n\n\nThe practical ways of the world could be found in the classics and\nhistories: \u201cThe Six Classics are all books that recorded the\nWay\u2026, the actual rulership (shizhi)\u2026, the\nactual practices (shixing)\u201d (Huang NLWDHJ: vol. 6, p.\n442\u2013443). \u201cAll that was recorded in the Twenty-one\nHistories was the enterprise of ordering the world\u201d (Huang NLWY:\nvol. 6, p. 351).\n\nWang Fuzhi also castigated the late Ming literati for embracing empty\nintuitionism, \u201cbecoming lax about maintaining clear distinctions\nin social relations (minglun) and investigating\nthings\u201d, such that they no longer cared about \u201cwhether or\nnot names correspond to realities\u201d (quoted in McMorran 1975:\n434). Learning, to Wang, must have a practical intellectual purport:\n\n\n\nEvery paragraph, every title, every work, and every sentence should\nlead one back to one\u2019s body and mind-heart. They should cohere\nwith one\u2019s grand purpose, \n\n\nwhich is \n\n\nto distinguish its grand meaning in order to establish the basis for\ncultivating oneself and governance. (quoted in Ji Wenfu 1978:\n1\u20133) \n\n\nWang privileged the study of history precisely because of its\npractical utility: \u201cWhat is valuable about history is its\naccount of the past as the teacher of the future\u201d. History would\nbe ill written if \u201cthe general framework of ordering the world\n(jingshi) is not illuminated\u201d (quoted in 1978: 1). In\nshort, historical learning, in the end, was statecraft.\n\nWhile it seemed evident that utilitarian thinking that actively\ncombatted moral intuitionism predominated in the early Qing in the\nseventeenth century, its edges might have been dulled in the\neighteenth century. The conventional explanation is that scholars\nchanneled their energy into the sort of pedantic studies of philology\nand classical texts, as represented by the so-called movement of\nevidential learning (kaozheng xue) that received the\ncourt\u2019s approval and encouragement. But it is a very partial\nview that fails to convey the whole picture, as utilitarian thinking\nwas in fact alive and well among the kaozheng practitioners\nand partisans, many of whom continued to see the classics as guides to\nordering the world. Qian Daxin (1728\u20131804), a towering figure in\nthe kaozheng movement, touted the practical value of these\nancient texts: \n\n\n[The Five Classics] were employed by the sages to make the warps and\nwoofs of the world. The ultimate goal was to render the world good.\nThe secondary function was to rule oneself. (Qian QYTWJ: 310) \n\n\nQian referred to the classics specifically in terms of the ideals of\njingshi and zhiyong\u2014ordering the world and\nextending utility: \n\n\nConfucian learning rests with the illumination of the substance in\norder to extend utility. The Odes, Documents, and\nRites are all writings for the ordering of the world. In the\nAnalects with twenty fascicles and Mencius with\nseven fascicles, more than half are discussions on administration and\ngovernment. What the masters and students discussed and sought at the\ntime were the principles of sustaining oneself, of living in the\nworld, of refusal, of acceptance, of receiving, and of giving. As for\n[the philosophical questions of] nature and the Way of heaven, even\nthose who were eminently upright did not hear of them. In this manner,\nthe Confucians worked on practicality and utility, and did not value\nempty talks. (QYTWJ: 373) \n\n\nIn short, wen, literary expressions and writings, must seek\nto realize the following practical goals: illuminating the Way\n(mingdao), ordering the world (jingshi), revealing\nthe subtle (chanyu), and rectifying customs\n(zhengsu).\n\nZhang Xuecheng\u2019s historiographic thinking was anchored on the\ngoal and ideal of ordering the world. Because the classics\n\u201coutlined the ordering of the world by the kings and the\nemperors\u201d, they were histories indeed. Zhang proclaimed that\n\u201chistorical learning is for the ordering of the world\u201d\n(shixue suoyi jingshi): \n\n\nI say, \u201chistorical learning is for the ordering of the world. It\nis surely not writings of empty words\u201d. For instance, the Six\nClassics all came from Confucius. The early Confucians thought that\nhis greatest achievement was the Spring and Autumn Annals. It\nwas precisely because it was intimately related to the social\nrealities of the time. Those of the later ages who spoke about\nwritings disregarded social realities, and discussed in an abstract\nmanner the nature and heaven. Thus, I know they achieved nothing.\nScholars who do not know such purport [of learning] are not qualified\nto talk about historical learning. \n\n\nZhang criticized the Han learning scholars for dwelling on the trivial\nceremonial details (quli) while neglecting and ignoring the\nbasic political institutions (jingli). Practical learning\nmeant understanding \u201cthe essential substance of the ancients in\norder to enlarge the mind-heart\u201d, so that one could\n\u201cdetermine what is right for the present\u201d (Zhang WSTY:\n53).\n\nThe discursive production of Qing philosophy was empowered and powered\nby the utilitarian impulse to engender and yield utility, seeking\nemancipation from the moral introspection of Song-Ming thought. As\nQing philosophical thought abjured abstract pondering of metaphysical\nmatters and questions, it turned to advocacy for ameliorative actions\nthat directly bettered the state and society.\n5. Intellectualism: External Knowledge and Inquiry\n\nA protuberant ideational strand that made up the Qing philosophical\nuniverse was the affirmative outlook regarding discursive knowledge\nand intellectual pursuit of the dao as the Way of the\nexterior world, supplanting the introspective endeavor and spiritual\ncontemplation aimed at internal enlightenment and realization. A word\nhere about the socio-political context of this shift is necessary. The\nintellectualist reorientation that characterized the Ming-Qing\ntransition owed much to the literati\u2019s conception of the\npalpable political, social, and economic problems of dynastic decline,\nwhich eventuated in the fall of the Ming and the establishment of a\nconquest dynasty. As they saw it, the root cause of dynastic\ndeclension and demise was the pervasive moral and spiritual\ndegeneration brought on by the intellectual bankruptcy of the late\nMing, as learning and thinking fell under the pernicious sway of empty\nintuitionism and internal introspection. A moribund culture and a weak\nstate could only be reinvigorated with the right kind of learning that\nwas concrete, practical, and substantive. This culture of criticism as\na result placed a premium on the classics, the actual words of the\nancient sages as the substantive source of authority. Antiquity\nitself, personified by the efficacious virtuous deeds of the sages,\nserved as the exemplar of order and amelioration. As particular\nattention was lavished on the thorough, literal understanding of these\ntexts and words, an intellectualist philosophical outlook emerged in\nthe world of thought and learning. Y\u00fc Ying-shih has famously\nlabeled this outlook \u201cintellectualism\u201d, which is an\nideal-type thinking abstracted from the Confucian quest for \u201cthe\nway of inquiry and learning\u201d (dao wenxue), in\ncontradistinction to the anti-intellectualist enterprise of\n\u201chonoring the heaven-endowed moral virtuous nature\u201d\n(zun dexing). The former sought data and corroborations of\nrealities in the external realm of myriad phenomena and things,\nwhereas the latter appealed intuitively to the internal realm of\none\u2019s very nature, whose quiddity was morally good, insofar as\nit was endowed by heaven. If Song-Ming philosophical thought was\ncharacterized by its identification with inner moral reckoning and\nawakening, then the Qing counterpart was marked by its special\nfocusing on external, objective knowledge, whose basis and point of\ndeparture were the classical texts as objects of cognitive\ninquiries.\n\nYet, the point must be made that embedded in this rupture was\ncontinuity in some important ways. The entire Song-Ming tradition of\nthought was no doubt subjected to wholesale reexamination, but to\nbegin with, the basis of their criticism and construction stemmed from\na well-established preexisting strand of learning. One famous Song\ndefinition of the quintessence of the Confucian tradition by Liu Yi\n(1017\u20131086) identified the three principal components of\nti (substance, essence, spirit, principle, core, and soul),\nyong (function, utility, practicality, application, action,\nand effort) and wen (literature, writings, philology,\nbelles-lettres, textual learning, classical studies). Together, they\nconstituted the goals and contents of Confucian learning. Qing\nintellectualism focused on the primacy of wen as a central\nmanifestation of yong. Moreover, the scholars, despite their\ngeneral discontent with what they perceived to be empty and recondite\nSong-Ming learning and their desire to reform it, continued to\ndelineate their scholarly and philosophical allegiance in terms of\nassociation with the two schools of Neo-Confucianism: the so-called\nCheng-Zhu school and Lu-Wang school. In fact, many of them engaged in\nintellectualist enterprises precisely for the purpose of wielding\nphilology as a weapon to defend their philosophical views while at the\nsame time seeking to weaken and demolish those of their opponents.\n\n\nNevertheless, even though Qing intellectualism was an outgrowth of the\nConfucian tradition with a time-worn pedigree, it was also new in the\nsense that the kaozheng (evidential research) movement and\nmethodology, the utmost expression of the intellectualist spirit, by\nvirtue of its intellectual scale and density, wrought an epochal\nbreakthrough. It came to be inescapably and unmistakably identified\nwith the special Qing way of construing reality and the world.\nKaozheng scholarship opened up hermeneutic issues of\ninterpretation. As Benjamin Elman has pointed out, the classics as a\nwhole were unproblematically recognized as assent-eliciting cultural\nand textual capital, but once they were subjected to interrogation as\nindividual separate texts, dissent and disquiet arose. The\nauthenticity of some texts came to be questioned; their places in the\nheterogeneous commentarial came to be debated; their authority came to\nbe reassessed; and the manner of retrieving the antique messages came\nto be argued. In short, the classics were historicized. Moreover, what\nbegan as studies of the classics spilled over into other areas of\ninquiry\u2014bronze artifacts, pre-Qin thinkers and texts, history,\ngeography, cosmology, science, and so on.\n\nGu Yanwu, in the early Qing, asserted that the study of principle\n\n(lixue) was irredeemably contracted to the study of the\nclassics (jingxue). According to him, in ancient times, any\nstudy of principle was perforce an investigation of the classics, in\nwhich the basis and operation of principle could be discerned and\nunderstood. Hence his research of ancient phonology: \n\n\nI think that the study of the Nine Classics should begin with textual\nanalysis, and the study of textual analysis should begin with a\nknowledge of phonology. It is the same with the study of all the\nvarious philosophers and the hundred schools. (Gu GTLSWJ: 76) \n\n\nGu criticized his contemporaries for pursuing what was to him empty\nand abstract \u201cChan Buddhist learning\u201d (Chanxue),\nsince they relied on the \u201crecords of dialogues\u201d\n(yulu) of the Song-Ming scholars and ignored the classics,\nwhich were the ben of learning, that is, the root, substance,\nand basis. He rejected the totalizing methodology of yiguan zhi\nfa (the way of connecting everything), which was the\nepistemological orientation of Song-Ming learning that eschewed and\nswamped concrete particulars. Instead, Gu called for \u201cduoxue\ner shi (to get to know through multifarious learning)\u201d and\n\u201cduojian er shi (to get to know through multifarious\nobservation)\u201d, such that one achieved \u201cboxue yu\nwen (erudition in all writings)\u201d (Gu GTLSWJ: 43\u201344).\nTo him, the classics recorded and consisted of nothing but \u201cwhat\nthe sages had heard and seen (shengren suowen suojian)\u201d\n(Gu RZL: 37\u201338). His intellectualist stance was a classic\nexpression of \u201cfollowing the way of learning and inquiry\u201d\n(dao wenxue), involving empirical observations and\npainstaking accumulation of broad knowledge.\n\nHuang Zongxi, as a self-touted follower of the Lu-Wang tradition, made\na point to reinterpret Wang Yangming\u2019s central idea of\n\u201czhi liangzhi\u201d (extending spontaneous moral\nknowing to the utmost) in intellectualist terms. While Wang tended to\nthink that knowledge must be grasped in terms of the ultimate\nsubstance of one\u2019s own mind-heart and could not be made clear in\nwords, thereby casting doubt on the efficacy of words and discursive\npractices, Huang spoke on behalf of the Ming master by claiming that\nthe act of \u201cextending\u201d (zhi) innate moral knowing\nwas practice, that is, the very act of \u201cbroad learning,\nexamining and inquiring, deliberation with utmost care, and\nidentifying differences clearly are all practices\u201d (Huang MRXA:\nv.2, p. 53). Later, Quan Zuwang (1705\u20131755), an admirer of\nHuang\u2019s scholarship, would offer this encomium by citing\nHuang\u2019s words: \n\n\n[Huang] once said, \u201cThe profession of [studying] the classics is\nfor the ordering of the world (ordering the world).\u201d Therefore,\nhe did not pursue the learning of the petty Confucians but commanded\n[himself] to study the classics and history. He also said,\n\u201cWithout [such] study, the changes and transformations of\nprinciple (i) cannot be verified\u201d. (quoted in Gu\nQingmei 1978: 118)\n\n\nWang Fuzhi also repudiated the Neo-Confucian epistemological\nassertions of the possibility of mingjie (esoteric\nunderstanding) and miaowu (mysterious enlightenment), both\nwhich were anti-intellectualist in conception, in that they referred\nto direct intuitive apprehension of the truth without the intervention\nof actual study. He insisted that \u201cthe principles of the\nmultitudinous things cannot be known without learning and cannot be\ndistinguished without erudition\u201d. Knowledge, for Wang, came from\nour direct engagement with and experience of the \u201cchanging\nexternal forms\u201d (kexing) in the universe, such as \n\n\nthe rising, setting, waning, and waxing of the sun and moon, and the\nsuccession of the seasons, the birth and death of the myriad things,\nand wind, rain, dew, and thunder. (quoted in Hou Wailu 1958, 108) \n\n\nHe claimed that \n\n\nwhen a thing is known, then its name is known. When its name is known,\nthen its significance is known. Without contact with things, even if\nthe mind-heart is imbued with its innate ability, [it] cannot name the\nnames, and things cannot be accomplished. (ibid., 108***see\nprevious*) \n\n\nWang thus argued strongly in favor of \u201cinvestigation of\nthings\u201d (gewu), which employed both the mind-heart, and\nour senses of hearing and seeing, that is, empirical observation. He\ndefined their inexorable interrelation and interaction in the quest\nfor knowledge: \n\n\nThe effort of the investigation of things employs both the faculty of\nthe mind-heart, and hearing and seeing. Study and inquiry are the\nmainstay, aided by thinking and distinguishing between\ndifferences\u2026. Hearing and seeing are the resources for the\nfunctioning of the mind-heart, setting the direction for it to follow.\n(quoted in Ji Wenfu 1978: 45) \n\n\nWang\u2019s theory of knowledge affirmed the irreducibility of\ndiscursive knowledge gained thorough investigating things\u2014study\nand inquiry\u2014to morality spontaneously apprehended by the\nmind-heart.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, when the kaozheng (evidential\nresearch) movement held sway, the common consensus was that learning\nmust be concrete and empirical. The ultimate goal was to retrieve and\nrestore, via philological explications (xungu), the pristine\nand unadulterated meanings of the sages\u2019 words, so that their\nmoral meanings (yili) could come to the fore, crystal clear.\nQian Daxin said it well: \n\n\nThere are first writings and words (wenzi) and then there are\nphilological explications of the classics. There are first\nphilological explications and then there are moral principles.\nPhilological explications of the classics are the sources from which\nmoral meanings are derived. (Qian QYTWJ: 349) \n\n\nHe asked, \n\n\nUnder heaven, is there any endeavor that abandons study and inquiry\nand specifically pursues the reverent realization of one\u2019s moral\nnature? (QYTWJ: 245) \n\n\nHere, he explicitly affirmed the importance of following the way of\ninquiry and learning, warning against exclusive focus on the\nrealization of our putatively moral nature. This intellectualist\nstance was shared by Dai Zhen, who also waxed rhetorical: \n\n\nBut if the pursuit of study and inquiry was abandoned, would it then\nbe possible to lead a life for the reverent realization of one\u2019s\nmoral nature? (Dai DZWJ: 140) \n\n\nFor Dai, to study and inquire was to \u201chear the dao\n(wendao)\u201d (DZWJ: 145). Thus, the intellectualist quest\nwas antecedent to any attempt to apprehend principle and the nature:\n\n\n\nTo seek the most appropriate [principles] means that knowledge comes\nfirst. In no way does sagely learning ever call for eliminating\nselfishness without also seeking to remove befuddlement, or\nemphasizing action without first emphasizing knowledge. (quoted in\nY\u00fc Ying-shih 1982: 389) \n\n\nTo put it plainly, \u201cmoral nature\u2026 feeds on learning and\ninquiry in order to develop sagely intelligence\u201d (quoted in\n1982: 390).\n\nZhang Xuecheng shared the kaozheng scholars\u2019 enthusiasm\nfor concrete and critical study of the classics (which he regarded as\nhistories) and their aversion toward esoteric moral speculation. He\nstated, \u201cThe ancients never did talk about principle removed\nfrom things and affairs\u201d, and \u201cthose who talk about nature\nand heaven\u2019s mandate must study history\u201d (quoted in\nY\u00fc Ying-shih 1976: 46). Like Huang Zongxi, he redefined, in\nintellectualist terms, what Wang Yangming\u2019s notion of zhi\nliangzhi (extending spontaneous moral knowing to the utmost)\nmeant. Wang\u2019s liangzhi was innate, spontaneous,\nineffable, and intuitive, realizable through internal introspection.\nBy contrast, Zhang\u2019s version referred to \u201cwhat a learner\nconsidered to be closest to his talents (cai) [and]\u2026\naffective and emotive predispositions (xingqing)\u201d, both\nof which were natural predispositions \u201cto learn\u201d\n(xue). On the other hand, Zhang explained the notion of\n\u201cextending\u201d zhi as \u201cthe learner\u2019s\neffort to search for knowledge\u201d (xuezhe qiuzhi zhi\ngong) (quoted in Y\u00fc Ying-shih 1976: 79\u201380).\n\nIn sum, intellectualism, as a leitmotif in the constellation of Qing\nphilosophy, expresses itself in two ways. As a methodology, it\nreferred to the pursuit of inferential and empirical knowledge, most\nprominently manifested in textual philological research. As a\nphilosophical outlook, it reevaluated and revised the central\nNeo-Confucian notion of internal self-cultivation aimed at spontaneous\nrealization of the heaven-endowed moral nature, arguing instead in\nfavor of the quest for external knowledge mediated by the noetic\nsenses. Intellectual cognitive faculties would take precedence over\nthe intuitive power of the mind-heart.\n",
