Two things\nhave however been argued. First, that tropes (and not, as is more\ncommonly supposed, objects or persons or states of affairs) are the\nbearers of final value. Second, that moral non-naturalists (who hold\nthat moral facts are fundamentally autonomous from natural facts) must\nregard properties as tropes to be able to account for the\nsupervenience of the moral on the natural.\n\nThat tropes are the bearers of (final) value is a view held by several\ntrope theorists. To say that what we value are the particular\nproperties of things and persons is prima facie\nintuitive (Williams 1953a: 16). And since concrete\nparticulars\u2014but not tropes\u2014are sometimes the subjects of\nsimultaneous yet conflicting evaluations, tropes seem\nespecially suited for the job as (final) value-bearers\n(Campbell 1997 [1981]: 130\u2013131). That tropes are the\nonly bearers of final value has however been questioned.\nAccording to Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2003), this is\nbecause different pro-attitudes are fitting with respect to different\nkinds of valuable objects. However, according to Olson (2003), even if\nthis is so, it does not show that tropes are not the only bearers of\nfinal value. For that conclusion only follows if we assume that, to\nwhat we direct our evaluative attitude is indicative of where value is\nlocalized. But final value should be understood strictly as the value\nsomething has for its own sake, which means that if e.g., a\nperson is valuable because of her courage, then she is not valuable\nfor her own sake but is valuable, rather, for the sake of one of her\nproperties (i.e., her tropes). But this means that, although the\nevaluative attitude may well be directed at a person or a thing, the\nperson or thing is nevertheless valued because of, or for the sake of,\nthe tropes which characterize it.\n\nNon-naturalists, next, are often charged with not being able to\nexplain what appears to be a necessary dependence of moral facts on\nnatural facts. Normally this dependence is explained in terms of\nsupervenience, but in order for such an account to be compatible with\nthe basic tenets of moral non-naturalism, it has been argued, this\nsupervenience must, in turn, be explainable in purely non-naturalistic\nterms (for an overview of this debate, cf. Ridge 2018).\nAccording to Shafer-Landau (2003) (as interpreted by Ridge 2007) this\nproblem is solved if moral and physical properties in the sense of\nkinds, are distinguished from moral and physical properties in the\nsense of tokens, or tropes. For then we can say, in analogy with what\nhas been suggested in the debate on the causal relevance of mental\nproperties, that although (necessarily) every moral trope is\nconstituted by some concatenation of natural tropes, it does not\nfollow that every moral type is identical to a natural type. This\nsuggestion is criticized in Ridge (2007).\n",
