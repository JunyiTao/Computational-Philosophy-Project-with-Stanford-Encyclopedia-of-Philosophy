    "main_text": "Can God Restore Virginity?\n4. Can God Restore Virginity?\n\n\nTo determine whether God can restore virginity, we need to find out\nwhether getting virginity back is a good thing. In Damian\u2019s view, there\nis no doubt about it. As the loss of virginity is an evil, getting\nvirginity back would be a good thing. Since God Almighty can will and\ndo anything that is good, he can will to restore virginity, and he can\nrestore it. This is Damian\u2019s general solution to the first question\n(599C\u2013600B).\n\n\nDamian expands his solution by explaining that there are two\nrelevant ways of understanding what the restoration of virginity means\n(see 600C\u2013601B). Restoring virginity concerns either the fullness of\nmerits (iuxta meritorum plenitudinem) or the integrity of the\nflesh (iuxta carnis integritatem). Restoration of virginity\naccording to merit is possible, maintains Damian, for it consists of\nreturning to the Lord. And, surely, the creator of humans can also\nrepair the damage that the loss of virginity causes to the flesh. Thus,\nDamian can end his main discussion concerning the first question by\nboldly declaring that God can restore virginity to a woman, no matter\nhow many husbands she has had, and that he can also repair the sign of\nvirginity in her flesh, so that it is as good as when she emerged from\nher mother\u2019s womb.\n\n\nAs already intimated (Section 2), the restoration of virginity that\nDamian affirms as possible does not imply any interfering with past\nevents. This goes both for restoration of fullness of merits and\nrestoration of the integrity of the flesh. In the remarks related to\nrestoration of virginity that Damian presents later in De divina\nomnipotentia, he mainly concentrates on the restoration of\nvirginity according to the integrity of the flesh (see 611B\u2013D,\n614C).\n\n\nDamian makes some comparisons that make it clear that the\nrestoration of virginity is a miracle within some present moment of\ntime. Damian says that restoring virginity is a lesser miracle than the\nvirgin birth. The virgin birth is like going through doors without\nopening them; the restoring of virginity is like closing doors that\nhave been opened (611B\u2013C). Damian further compares the virgin birth and\nthe restoration of virginity to the eternal life of Enoch (Sirach\n44:16; Hebrews 11:5) and the resurrection of Lazarus (John 11) (614C).\nWhat seems to be common to the restoration of virginity, the\nresurrection, and the closing of doors is that, in all three cases,\nsomething is restored to its original state. Such a restoration need\nnot affect the past in any way. Restoring virginity does nothing to the\nfact that a woman has lost her virginity and has been without it, as\nthe resurrection of Lazarus does not remove the fact that he has died\nand been dead. Restoration of virginity is an \u201cordinary\u201d\nmiracle comparable to some of the miracles that are reported in the\nBible.\n\n\nIn De divina omnipotentia, Damian presents some systematic\nremarks concerning God\u2019s power to produce miracles. God has sovereign\npower over nature. As the author of nature and its laws, he has\nreserved to himself the right to change the laws of nature according to\nhis free choice and bend them as he wishes. Nature cannot but obey the\nwill of its maker (612B\u2013D). As evidence for this view, Damian\nenumerates a large number of miracles and miraculous phenomena that are\ncontrary to the ordinary laws of nature (612D\u2013614B; cf. 610D\u2013611D). The\ndiscussion ends with the renewed affirmation that God is capable of\nrestoring virginity if he wills (614C). None of the miracles that\nDamian mentions imply that God could undo the done or bring about a\ncontradictory state of affairs. The aim of Damian\u2019s discussion appears\nto be to argue that God can miraculously restore the physical integrity\nof the flesh even though it is not possible to change the past (cf.\n615A\u2013B and\n Section 2).\n",
