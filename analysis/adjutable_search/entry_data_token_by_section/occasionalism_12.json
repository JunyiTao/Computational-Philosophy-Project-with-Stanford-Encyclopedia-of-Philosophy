The issue of how to interpret\nthe CCC thesis, however, is at the center of the dispute, since\noccasionalists like Malebranche deny creaturely causation\nbecause they accept the CCC thesis, while concurrentists like\nLeibniz affirm genuine creaturely causation despite upholding\nthe CCC thesis. \n\nBefore proceeding further, we might briefly examine why the CCC thesis\nwas so broadly accepted as the orthodox view, by considering what\nimplications the rejection of the CCC thesis was thought to entail.\nThe most significant implication of rejecting the CCC thesis, from the\nperspective of the proponents of the CCC thesis, is the consequence\nthat divine causal activity at creation is markedly different from\ndivine causal activity in moments of conservation, such that the\ndifference is sufficient to deny the identity of the two acts. Hence,\nconservation is not continuous creation. An intuitive way of\ncashing out this difference, which indeed is how \u201cmere\nconservationists\u201d such as Durandus proceeded, is to think that\nwhile God does everything there is to be done, causally speaking, at\nthe moment of creation, God does less in subsequent moments of\nconservation such that God merely conserves the creatures in\nexistence. How is God doing less in conservation, according to the\nconservationist? In moments of conservation, if the event that is\ncaused is a non-miraculous natural event, the direct,\nimmediate cause of this event is a creaturely cause, and not\ndivine. God is involved, even for the conservationist, but only in a\nmediated, indirect manner\u2014God works in the background,\nas it were, keeping the creaturely cause in existence, allowing the\ncreature to exercise its causal powers in a direct, immediate fashion.\nFor instance, if the fire of a gas range causes the water in the\ncoffee pot to boil, the boiling of the water is directly and\nimmediately caused by the fire, even if it is fully granted that the\nexistence of the fire must be directly conserved by God. Thus, God, in\nkeeping the fire in existence, which in turn allows the fire to boil\nthe water directly and immediately, is mediately and remotely involved\nin the boiling of the water, according to the mere conservationist.\nGod is merely conserving the fire (and water) and not\ndirectly causing the water to boil. From our contemporary perspective,\nthis indirect, mediated involvement on the part of God might seem\nsufficient to give divine causality its due place in nature. But the\ntheistic philosophers of the late Scholastic and early modern period\nfound this way of securing the role of divine causality theologically\ninsufficient and suspect. The main worry appears to have been that to\nthink that the dependence of creatures on God is somehow reduced, once\ncreation has past, fundamentally misrepresents the critical dependence\ncreatures have on God throughout their existence, be it\ncreation or conservation. Because in terms of creaturely dependence\nconservation and creation are fundamentally the same, these\nphilosophers seemed to have been thinking, what other differences\nthere might be between conservation and creation, these differences\nare negligible. It is from this perspective that the orthodox view was\nto affirm the identity between conservation and\n creation.[25]\n\n\nAn early version of something close to the core idea behind the CCC\nargument emerges in the views of al-Ash\u2018ari (873\u2013935), the\nfounder of Ash\u2018arite school. As Perler and Rudolph have argued,\naccording to al-Ash\u2018ari, God rearranges the atoms that make up\nthis world anew at every instant, and in so doing God continuously\ncreates the accidents that inhere in these atomic substances (Perler\nand Rudolph 2000, 28\u201362). The view seems to have been one where\nthe accidents of a substance possess only a momentary existence.\nHence, at every instant, God brings about the accidents that inhere in\nthe substances by continuously recreating these modes. If God sustains\nthe existence of the atoms themselves, while continuously recreating\nall of their modes, then, barring causal overdetermination, the\noccasionalist conclusion that God is the only genuine cause does seem\nto follow from this interpretation of divine conservative\nactivity.\n\nOn the European continent, the most artful presentation of the CCC\nargument is found in Malebranche. But the argument is not thought to\nhave originated with Malebranche, and it has typically been traced\nback to Descartes, though whether he was himself indeed an\noccasionalist is some matter of controversy, as noted earlier. One of\nthe main texts surrounding this controversy comes from the Third\nMeditation:\n\n\u2026 [I]t does not follow from the fact that I existed a little\nwhile ago that I must exist now, unless there is some cause which as\nit were creates me afresh at this moment\u2014that is, which\npreserves me. For it is quite clear to anyone \u2026 that the same\npower and action are needed to preserve anything at each individual\nmoment of its duration as would be required to create that thing anew\nif it were not yet in existence. Hence the distinction between\npreservation and creation is only a conceptual one, and this is one of\nthe things that are evident by the natural light. (AT VII 49/CSM II\n 33)[26]\n\n\nTaken in isolation, this passage does suggest that Descartes took our\nsouls to be continuously created by God in a way that would preclude\nany genuine causal activity on our part. For if, in initially creating\nof my soul\u2014that is, in its creation ex nihilo\u2014God\nbrings about both the existence of my soul and its modes or\nmodification, then, since the \u201csame power and action\u201d of\nGod is required in preserving my existence subsequent to creation\nab initio, God would be the sole causal agent that brings\nabout my preserved existence with the modes I possess. But to conclude\non the basis of this interpretation that Descartes was an\noccasionalist would be premature, since there is a good supply of\nother texts that suggest Descartes\u2019 affirmation of our genuine\ncausal efficacy.\n\nIn contrast, Louis de la Forge\u2019s commitment to the occasionalist\nthesis, at least with regard to bodies, seems unquestionable. For he\nmakes explicit the critical claim that God\u2019s causal activity of\nproducing a body is inseparable from his producing the particular\nmodes of the body in question:\n\nNot only must [God] continue to produce [a body], if he wants it to\npersevere in existence; but in addition, because he cannot create it\neverywhere nor outside of any particular place, he must himself put it\nin place [lieu] B if he wants it there. (TEH 240)\n\n\nThe central idea is that God\u2019s causal activity with regard to\nthe production of a body is an \u201call or nothing\u201d affair, in\nthe sense that if God produces the body, God produces it with all of\nits specific modes or properties. In other words, though God need not\ncreate a body, as long as he does create or conserve it, he cannot do\nso without bringing about its specific spatial properties or modes.\nWhy, we might ask, is this the case? Even if one grants that there can\nbe no abstract or general Cartesian body, as it were\u2014that is, a\nbody that is extended in general without any specific spatial\nproperties or modes\u2014such that even God could not create such a\nbody in the abstract, the concurrents could still wonder, why is it\nthe case that the cause that gives the esse to a given body\nmust also be the cause that produces its specific modes and properties\nas well? It is here that the CCC thesis provides the missing link. For\nif conservation is but continuous creation, in the sense that the\ncharacter and degree of dependence is identical in the two cases, then\ninsofar as there was total dependence at creation, there would have to\nbe total dependence in conservation. Occasionalism with regard to\nbodies would follow. Given that God has a monopoly over producing both\nthe body itself and its modes, no other cause is operative in bringing\nabout any aspect of the world. Conservation is but continuous\ncreation.\n\nAt this point, we might want to consider the possibility of\noverdetermination. Could we not think that some creaturely effects are\noverdetermined in conservation? That is, might we not grant that God\nis the total and direct cause of a creature\u2019s modes but also\nhold that the creature causes its modes as well such that certain\neffects are causally overdetermined? Moreover, if it is only the modes\nof the creature that are overdetermined, then it seems as though there\nis no violation of the central tenet that God is the unique causal\nsource of the esse that creatures have. As we have discussed\nearlier, divine causal power importantly involves that of keeping the\nbeing or esse of the creature in existence, and even the\nconservationist grants that the role of a conserving cause\u2014that\nis, the causal power of keeping the being of creatures in\nexistence\u2014is the unique prerogative of God as the causa\nsecundum esse. That is, all parties in this dispute concerning\nthe issue of secondary causation in nature agree, regardless of their\nviews about the reality of creaturely causal powers, that the being or\nesse of a creature when the creature is conserved is just as\ndependent on God as when the creature is created ex nihilo.\nGod is the unique creative and conserving cause of any being or\nesse in this world.\n\nThe overdetermination of modes, thus, cannot be ruled out on the mere\ngrounds that such overdetermination involves a malignant type of\ncausal overreach on the part of creatures, overflowing into the\nexclusive divine realm of providing esse. For the proponents\nof overdetermination are taking the creaturely power to be restricted\nto that of bringing about a creature\u2019s modes. The creature\ntherefore would not share in the power of the causa secundum\nesse, and what power the creature would have to produce modes or\nmodifications would be effective only insofar as the creature\u2019s\nbeing or esse has been produced by God. Hence, the critical\ndependence of the creature\u2019s esse or being on God is\nmaintained. It is in this sense that cases of overdetermination of\nmodes might present a noteworthy challenge to the advocates of\noccasionalism arguing on the basis of the CCC thesis.\n\nBut this is not to say that the occasionalist is left without possible\nresponses to this challenge. First of all, the occasionalists might\nsuggest that such overdetermination implies that God is engaging in\nneedlessly redundant causal behavior. Not only would God be producing\nthe modes himself but he would also be producing the causal power of\nthe creature that is an overdetermining cause of these modes. And the\noccasionalist could go on to argue that such redundancy is\nproblematic. Second, and more importantly, if a core intuition behind\nthe CCC thesis, as pointed out earlier, is the point that a\ncreature\u2019s dependence on God when it is conserved is no less\nthan when it is initially created ex nihilo, then we might\nthink that the overdetermination of an effect in conservation\nconflicts with this symmetric dependency. For if some effects are\noverdetermined in conservation, then with regard to those effects of\nthe creature, the creature\u2019s dependence is in some significant\nsense less than in creation, since the effects would come about even\nif the mode-producing causal activity of God were absent. The fact\nthat the occurrence of these effects is causally guaranteed through\noverdetermination\u2014particularly in virtue of the creature\u2019s\nproductive power\u2014could be thought to be inconsistent with the\nradical dependence of creatures expressed in the doctrine of creation\nex nihilo. A different way to put the point would be to argue\nthat the view that allows for overdetermination in the production of\nmodes would come dangerously close to mere conservationism in that the\ncreaturely cause on the overdetermination view is capable of directly\nand immediately bringing about the mode in question. For the\noverdetermination scenario suggests that even if God were not to\nproduce the mode directly, the mode would come about from the\ncreature\u2019s power in virtue of God conserving the creature with\nits power. Thus, insofar as the creature is an overdetermining cause,\nits causal power, in effect, is of a type that is typically endorsed\nby\n conservationists.[27]\n Though neither La Forge nor Malebranche directly address the\npossibility of overdetermination, the following passage from La Forge\nseems to support the view that this intuition about the symmetry of\ndependence is indeed part of his motivation behind his endorsement of\nthe CCC thesis:\n\nIt was necessary for [God] to employ his omnipotent power in order to\nbring all of Nature out of nothing. \u2026 It would all return to\nnothing if God ceased bringing it out of nothing at each moment that\nhe conserves\n it.[28]\n\n\nAs we have seen, the success of the CCC argument relies heavily on the\nclaim that the act of creation ex nihilo and the act of\nconservation are indistinguishable in terms of both the dependence of\nthe creature on God and the role and content of divine causal\nactivity. That is, the two acts are qualitatively identical in terms\nof what God is doing, causally speaking. Malebranche reinforces this\nclaim in his Dialogues by emphasizing that God\u2019s causal\nactivity of sustaining the being or esse of a creature and\nhis causal activity of bringing about the modes of a creature cannot\ncome apart:\n\nCreation does not pass, because the conservation of creatures\nis\u2014on the part of God\u2014simply a continuous creation, a\nsingle volition subsisting and operating continuously. Now, God can\nneither conceive nor consequently will that a body exist nowhere, nor\nthat it does not stand in certain relations of distance to other\nbodies. Thus, God cannot will that this armchair exist, and by this\nvolition create or conserve it, without situating it here, there, or\nelsewhere. \u2026 Now it is a contradiction that God wills this\narmchair to exist, unless He wills it to exist somewhere and unless,\nby the efficacy of His will, He puts it there, conserves it there,\ncreates it there. (OCM XII 160/ Dialogues\n115\u20136)\n\n\nMalebranche here is assuming that in the case of creation ex\nnihilo God is the cause of not only the being or esse of\na creature but also its modes\u2014presumably because no other\npossible cause actually exists prior to the act of creation ex\nnihilo. So by taking God\u2019s conserving activity to be\nqualitatively identical to his activity as creator ex nihilo,\nMalebranche appears to arguing that even in cases where the creatures\nare conserved, God is the unique cause of both their esse and\nmodes. Since the modes of a creature cannot in principle have been\ncausally overdetermined in the case of creation ex\nnihilo\u2014for creation ex nihilo suggests that no\ncause exists prior to the act of creation\u2014if the\ncreature\u2019s dependence on God in instances of conservation is\nidentical to the instance of creation ex nihilo, then there\ncan be no overdetermination in the production of modes in cases of\nconservation. Now the concurrentist might reply at this point that\nconcurrentists deny overdetermining creaturely causes as well, since\ntheir point is that the creature is a concurring cause of the\nmodes of the creature: the causal contribution of neither God nor the\ncreature are redundant, since both are necessary in some manner. But\nnotice that if it is indeed the case that the act of creation ex\nnihilo should be understood to imply that God is the unique cause\nof both the esse and modes of the creature, and if\nconservation is qualitatively identical to continuous creation ex\nnihilo in causally relevant respects, then the concurrentist\nwould have to either reject the CCC thesis or suggest a different\naccount of what is going on at creation ex\n nihilo.[29]\n For if this way of understanding continuous creation rules out\noverdetermining causes, it also rules out concurring causes. \n\nHowever, some have suggested that identifying conservation with\ncreation ex nihilo this closely effectively pushes us to\nregard conservation as continuous recreation, where the\ncreature that is supposedly \u201cconserved\u201d falls out of\nexistence instantaneously before it is repeatedly\n recreated.[30]\n Interestingly, this \u201ccontinuous recreation\u201d reading seems\nwell-motivated from the occasionalist perspective. If one wants to\nenforce a strict identity between conservation and creation, why not\ngo all out and take conservation to be recreation ex nihilo,\nin which case the absence of any cause other than God will be\nguaranteed, thereby automatically securing the occasionalist thesis?\nOn this reading as continuous recreation, conservation is in fact the\ncontinuous resuscitation of the creature from the void of\nnon-existence, into which the creature is thrust instantaneously after\nits momentary existence. Some, such as Winkler, have suggested that\nthe continuous recreation reading of the CCC thesis would indeed do\nthe work of establishing occasionalism, since at every moment of\nconservation, there would literally be no creature around, as it were,\nto cooperate as a concurring\n cause.\u201d[31]\n Continuous creation as recreation, however, raises a number of\nconcerns, including the question of whether the transtemporal identity\nof creatures can be maintained. For, on the recreation model, the\nprevious creature ex hypothesi goes out of existence, and\nanother one is created anew and the two would then seem to be\nnumerically distinct. \n\nPerhaps more serious is the following type of challenge by the\nconcurrentist. The concurrentist at this point might protest and\nquestion whether and why the identity of conservation and creation\nneed be taken in this manner. Given that the concurrentist wishes to\nmaintain theological orthodoxy and endorse the CCC thesis as well, the\nconcurrentist might suggest that an alternative understanding of the\nidentity between creation and conservation is available in the\nfollowing manner: to say that conservation is but continuous creation\njust is to say that the act of creation and conservation is but a\nnumerically single act on the part of God, and thus it need not be the\ncase that what God does, causally speaking, remains qualitatively the\nsame throughout this one, continuous act. For example, one might take\na single, continuous walk during which the pace is at times brisk, at\ntimes leisurely, but such difference in terms of exertion throughout\nthe walk does not split the walk into two distinct\n acts.[32]\n On such a model, the concurrentist could argue that she also agrees\nthat conservation is continuous with creation and thus conservation\nand creation comprise a single, identical act, but the affirmation of\nthe CCC thesis, cashed out in this way, need not imply that there is\nno creaturely contribution in moments of conservation. God, on this\n\u201ccontinuous maintenance\u201d reading (Winkler 2011, 301)\nmaintains the creature throughout its existence in a single, unified\nact, but what God does at the initial point of creation differs from\nwhat God does when he merely conserves the creature. Note that this\n\u201ccontinuous maintenance\u201d reading targets not only the\n\u201ccontinuous recreation\u201d reading but \u201cqualitative\nidentity\u201d reading as well. For the latter two readings share the\nintuition that the identity in question is one in which divine causal\ncontribution be thought to be qualitatively the same, regardless of\nwhether it be in the form of recreation or not. \n\nThe dialectic then at this point can be understood as a debate between\ntwo fundamentally different readings of the CCC thesis. On the one\nhand, there are those, like Malebranche, who take the CCC thesis as a\npremise toward occasionalism in that the identity in question is one\nof qualitative identity in the sense that what God does causally\nspeaking at creation ex nihilo is the same as what God does\nin conservation\u2014let\u2019s call this the \u201cqualitative\nidentity\u201d reading. On the other hand, there are who read the\nidentity as a mere numerical identity, wherein God continuously\nmaintains the creature throughout its existence, but what God does\nqualitatively at creation is different from what God does in\nconservation. God does less in conservation than at creation, but the\nacts comprise one continuous whole\u2014let\u2019s call this the\n\u201cnumerical identity\u201d reading. If the numerical identity\nreading was more comfortable to those divine concurrents who wanted to\nboth endorse the CCC thesis and allow for genuine causation\nat the creaturely level, one might think that the contribution of\noccasionalists like La Forge and Malebranche to the debate was to\npresenting a strong case as to why the qualitative identity reading\nought to be preferred as the correct interpretation of the CCC thesis.\nHere actually is Malebranche pressing precisely this case:\n\n\u201cThe moment of creation has passed!\u201d But if this moment\ndoes not pass, then you are in a spot, and will have to yield.\nTherefore take note. God wills that a certain kind of world exist. His\nwill is omnipotent, and this world is thus created. Let God no longer\nwill there to be a world, and it is thereby annihilated. For the world\nassuredly depends on the will of the creator. If the world subsists,\nit is because God continues to will its existence. Thus, the\nconservation of creatures is, on the part of God, nothing but their\ncontinued creation. I say on the part of God who acts. For on the part\nof creatures there appears to be a difference, since by the act of\ncreation they pass from nothingness to being, whereas by the act of\nconservation they continue to be. But in essence the act of creation\ndoes not cease, because in God creation and conservation are but a\nsingle volition which, consequently, is necessarily followed by the\nsame effects. (Dialogues 112, my emphasis)\n\n\nNote in the last sentence that the identity of the volition is cashed\nout in terms of the identity of the effects, which supports the view\nthat for Malebranche, the proper reading of the CCC thesis is the\nqualitative identity reading. For the numerical identity reading\nentails that God\u2019s effect in conservation ought to be\ndistinguished from God\u2019s effect at creation in that God does\nless in conservation than creation.\n\nLastly, we note that, while La Forge appears to have limited his\noccasionalism to extended substances and held that we as minds are\ncausally active in producing our ideas (TEH 166), Malebranche\nextends his occasionalism to thinking substances. Consider the\nfollowing passage from the Treatise on Ethics (1684):\n\nGlory and Honor belong to God alone. Toward Him alone, all the\nmovements of all minds ought to tend, because only in Him does power\nreside. All willing by creatures is inefficacious in itself. Only\nHe who gives being could be able to give the ways of being, since the\nways of being are nothing but beings themselves, in this or that\nfashion. Nothing is more evident to one who knows how to consult\nthe inner truth. For what is more evident than that if God, for\nexample, keeps a body always in one place, then no creature could move\nit to another? Or that no man could even move his own arm unless God\nwills to concur in doing that which ungrateful and stupid man thinks\nhe is doing by himself? And the same goes for the ways of being of\nminds. If God keeps or creates the soul in a way of being which\nafflicts it, such as with pain, no mind can deliver itself therefrom,\nnor make itself to feel pleasure thereby, unless God concurs with it\nto carry out its desires. (OCM XI 160/TE 147, my\nemphasis)\n\n\nHere we get something close to a generalized version of the key claim\nof the CCC argument in the Dialogues that God cannot will\nthat an extended substance exist, \u201cwithout at the same time\nwilling that it exist either here or there and without His will\nplacing it somewhere\u201d (OCM XII 156/Dialogues\n110): only he who gives being could be able to give the ways of being.\nAnd, importantly, this principle is said to be applicable to the\n\u201cways of being of\n minds.\u201d[33]\n In effect, we are presented with an explicit denial of the\npossibility that God\u2019s sustaining activity of the being or\nesse of a creature can be separated from his activity of\nbringing about the modes of the creature, regardless of whether the\ncreature is an extended or thinking substance. Hence, the CCC argument\nseems to be fully applicable to the modes or ways of the being of the\nminds, just like bodies.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s extension of the thesis of occasionalism to\nthinking substances, as presented here in the Treatise on\nEthics, is not an aberration. In one of his most careful\nstatements about how minds relate to his occasionalism, Malebranche\nclaims as follows:\n\nI agree that God is the sole author of all substances and of all their\nmodes, that He is the author of all beings: not only of all bodies but\nof all minds. But be careful: I understand by a mode of a\nsubstance only that which cannot change without there being some real\nor physical change in the substance of which it is the mode. \u2026\nOnce again, I agree that God is the sole efficacious cause of all the\nreal changes that take place in the world (Pr\u00e9motion\nPhysique, OC XVI 40; the translation is from Kremer 2000,\n210\u201311).\n\n\nHere, once again, we get an explicit statement that God is the sole\nauthor of all substances and their modes. Note, however, that\nMalebranche is careful to specify what he means by a\n\u201cmode\u201d of a substance. This clarification is motivated by\nthe attempt to make room for a kind of power within minds or thinking\nsubstances that will allow for the attribution of freedom and moral\nresponsibility to them. This power of consent or withholding of\nconsent is further developed in the following:\n\nThere are in the soul two different powers or activities. The first is\nproperly only the action of God \u2026 [who] continually creates the\nsoul with the invincible desire to be happy, or continually moves it\ntoward the good in general. But the second \u2026 which is the\nessence of freedom, is \u2026 very different from the first. It\nconsists in a true power, not to produce, by its own efficacy, new\nmodifications in itself, that is, new interesting perceptions or new\nmovements in the will, but \u2026 a true power of the soul to\nsuspend or to give its consent to the movements that follow naturally\nupon interesting perceptions. (OCM XVI 46\u20137; the\ntranslation is from Kremer 2000, 1999)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, this power of the soul is described as not being\na power that produces modifications, which is an expression\nof Malebranche\u2019s attempt to reconcile the positing of such\npowers in minds with his occasionalism about minds. That is, insofar\nas all powers that bring about changes in modes are in God, and merely\nnon-modal powers are in the creature, then Malebranche seems to be\nthinking that such non-modal powers of creatures are consistent with\nhis occasionalism. This, however, raises the question of whether such\nnon-modal powers are robust enough to anchor the free will and moral\nresponsibility of thinking\n substances.[34]\n\nIf we bracket the issue of how to render a full-blown occasionalism\nwith a sufficiently robust account of free will, then, as we have\nhopefully seen, the CCC argument is a fairly powerful argument as an\nargument for global occasionalism.\n",
