    "main_text": "Maxwell, Szilard and Landauer || Maxwell's demon\n1.1 Maxwell's demon\n\n\nMaxwell's demon was first mentioned in a letter written to Tait in\n1867. Maxwell was one amongst a number of researchers in the\ndeveloping field of thermodynamics who was interested in seeking an\nunderstanding of thermal phenomena in terms of an underlying atomic\nphysics. However, unlike Boltzmann and Clausius, who were attempting\nto prove the law of entropy increase from such atomic physics, Maxwell\nhad realised that if thermodynamics was ultimately grounded in atomic\ntheory, then the second law of thermodynamics could have only a\nstatistical validity.\n\n\n\n\nThe standard demon is supposed to be able to create a temperature\ndifference in a gas, without expending work. The gas is in a\ncontainer, divided in two by an insulated partition, but there is a\nhole in the partition just large enough for a single molecule to pass\nthrough. The gas has been allowed to equilibrate at some well defined\ntemperature, and as a result the average kinetic energy of each\nmolecule is (3/2)kT (we ignore internal degrees of\nfreedom and assume the gas is monatomic), where\nT is the absolute (Kelvin) temperature scale and k\nis Boltzmann's constant.\n\n\nThe demon is equipped with a shutter that is able to block the\nhole. If a molecule that is moving faster than average approaches the\nhole from the left hand side, the demon closes the hole with the\nshutter, and the molecule is elastically reflected back to the\nleft. If a molecule approaches from the left hand side, but moving\nslower than average, the demon leaves the hole unblocked, and the\nmolecule proceeds through to the right. When a molecule approaches the\nhole from the right hand side, the demon's sorting procedure is\nreversed: slow molecules are blocked and fast molecules are allowed to\npass through.  The result is a gradual accumulation of faster\nmolecules on the left and slower molecules on the right. Further\ncollisions between molecules will distribute this kinetic energy\nthroughout each side, resulting in the gas in the left side getting\nhotter and the right side getting cooler. As the collisions with the\nshutter are elastic, and moving the shutter is frictionless, no work\nis performed by the demon. The temperature difference that develops\ncould be exploited by a conventional heat engine to extract work, in\nviolation of second law of thermodynamics.\n\n\n\n\nA simpler demon could be constructed simply by always blocking\nmolecules coming from the left and never blocking molecules approaching\nfrom the right. This pressure demon would cause a pressure difference\nto develop between the two sides of the partition and again, a\nconventionally operating engine could exploit such a difference to\nextract work.\n\n\nHis thought experiment was intended to demonstrate the possibility\nof a gas evolving from a higher to a lower entropy state. The later\ntime reversal and recurrence arguments of Loschmidt and Poincare\nsimilarly challenged the H-theorem of Boltzmann (see Uffink (2006),\nSection 4, for a discussion of these arguments), but time reversal\nrequires great sensitivity and recurrence takes a very long time.\nAlthough they show the law of entropy increase is not absolute, we\nmight still be surprised to actually witness a large decrease in\nentropy happen through these means. With the demon we to appear to need\nanother explanation of why such systems are not seen to occur\nspontaneously in nature, or why we cannot arrange for such a decrease\nin entropy to occur.\n\n\nMaxwell's original discussions emphasised that the demon needed to\nhave powers of perception and handling the individual molecules far\ngreater than our own. This makes its operation simply a matter of scale\nand the statistical nature of the second law not probabilistic, but\ndue to our inability to discriminate the exact state of a large number\nof particles (similar to our inability to exploit Loschmidt's\nreversibility objection). This leaves open the possibility of a device\nwhich could discriminate fluctuations in individual atomic velocities\nand it is not clear that any probabilistic argument would prevent work\nbeing extracted from this. The explanation of Brownian motion by\nEinstein in 1905, as the effect of statistical mechanical fluctuations,\nmade them appear directly observable and open to exploitation. Earman\nand Norton (1998) includes a historical review of early attempts to\ndesign such devices.\n\n\nSmoluchowski (1914) is generally credited with having proposed the\nexplanation that prevents their operation. He replaced the demon by a\nphysical device, in this case a gentle spring that presses the trapdoor\nagainst the side of the partition. The combined spring and trapdoor is\nsupposed to act as a valve. The trapdoor is held shut if a molecule\ncollides from the left, but is opened by a fast collision from the\nright, so that a pressure difference develops. However, the spring is a\nsystem with its own kinetic and potential energy. The collisions will\ntransfer energy to the spring, making it oscillate. When the internal\nenergy of the spring matches the temperature of the gas, it is flapping\nback and forth, effectively randomly. It becomes as likely as not to be\nspontaneously open when a molecule arrives from the left and to be\nswinging shut when a molecule arrives from the right. This balance\nmeans pressure or temperature differences are no more likely to occur\nthan they would spontaneously if the hole was simply left open. If the\ninternal energy of the spring is out of equilibrium with the gas, it\nwill be heated (or cooled) by the collisions with the molecules until\nequilibrium is reached.\n\n\nThe trapdoor may appear to violate the second law over short\nperiods, but the behaviour is such that it is not violated in the long\nrun. Smoluchowski suggested that a modified second law should express\nthe inability of a device to produce continuous, reliable reductions in\nentropy.\n",
