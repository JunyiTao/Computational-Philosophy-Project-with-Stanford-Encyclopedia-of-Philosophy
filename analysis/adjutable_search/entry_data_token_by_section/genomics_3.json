    "main_text": "Reading the Genome || The Run-up to the HGP\n2.1 The Run-up to the HGP\n\nA decade after Sanger and Maxam and Gilbert published their DNA\nsequencing methods in 1975 the first concrete talk of a human genome\nproject started to appear in writing (Dulbecco 1986) and at different\nworkshops (Sinsheimer 1989; Palca 1986). The Human Genome Project\n(HGP) itself became a reality in 1990 when it was officially launched\nas a US federal program (see 1990 in a brief history and timeline\n[NHGRI] in the \n Other Internet Resources section\n below).\n\nIn the run-up to the HGP there were high expectations (some would say\n\u201chype\u201d) developing, which inevitably also brought critics\nof the project onto the scene (Koshland 1989; Luria et al. 1989). As\nso often, the issue of funding had a key role to play. When the HGP\nwas initiated there were no \u2018big science\u2019 projects being\npursued in the life sciences. The HGP therefore was a true first for\nbiology. But pushing such a large project that absorbed a significant\nproportion of the funding allocated to the biological sciences\nencountered a lot of resistance from other scientists.\n\nThere were three key criticisms: 1) Some claimed that the HGP was a\nwaste of money because much useless (read: junk) DNA was sequenced;\nthe focus should be more directly on the functional parts of the\ngenome, i.e., the genes or regulatory elements, which could be\nachieved using simpler and less expensive methods (Brenner 1990;\nWeinberg 1991; Rechsteiner 1991; Lewontin 1992; Rosenberg 1994).\nOthers claimed 2) that the HGP was a waste of money as it was merely a\ndescriptive and not a hypothesis-driven project. This was an issue\nthat became much more prominent ten years after the project was\nfinished, when it became clear that big data science was here to stay\n(see, e.g., Weinberg\n 2010).[8]\n\nAnd last but not least there was also the critique 3) that the HGP is\nfundamentally misguided as it assumes that by using sequence knowledge\nalone we would be able to develop an understanding of how our body\nworks, how it develops disease, and that this understanding will\neventually lead to cures for many diseases (Lewontin 1992; Tauber\n& Sarkar 1992; Kitcher 1994). This more general critique of a\nnarrowly sequence-focused approach to biomedical issues also comes up\n20 years later in discussions about the use of common genetic variants\nto learn more about common diseases and traits (see\n Section 3.1.2).\n \n\nIt is difficult to evaluate criticisms of the last kind. There is no\ndoubt that enthusiasm for the HGP and many other successor projects in\ngenomics has often been grounded in simplistic assumptions about the\npower of DNA and its pre-eminent role in biological systems. On the\nother hand it is arguable that many unanticipated benefits have\nderived from genomics quite independently of such assumptions. For\ninstance the ability to make very precise comparisons of genome\nsequences has led to major advances in unraveling the details of\nevolutionary history, not to mention its application to technologies\nsuch as forensic DNA testing. Moreover, it can be argued with Waters\n(2007b) that what makes\ngenomes so central to biological research is not the erroneous belief\nthat they are the ultimate causes of everything, but rather the unique\npossibilities they present for precise intervention in organisms or\ncells.\n",
