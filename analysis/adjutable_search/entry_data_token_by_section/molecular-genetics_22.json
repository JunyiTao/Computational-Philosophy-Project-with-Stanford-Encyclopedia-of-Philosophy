Why is so much biological research centered on genes and DNA?\n\n\nIn official and public contexts, scientists appeal to the fundamental\ntheory associated with molecular genetics to justify centering\nresearch on genes and DNA (e.g., see the websites of funding agencies\nsuch as National Center for Biotechnology Information). Genes are\ntypically referred to as \u201cthe fundamental units\u201d that are\nresponsible for guiding all basic life processes. Usually a\ncombination of causal and information metaphors are invoked to explain\nthe role of genes. Genes are said to produce RNA and polypeptides, to\nprovide instructions, or direct processes. But philosophical\ninvestigation has shown that these kind of sweeping claims cannot\nwithstand careful scrutiny. Why, then, is so much research centered on\ngenes and DNA? One answer to this question is that biologists are\nblinded by an ideology of genetic determinism. But Wagner's defense of\ngene centrism suggests another answer, an answer that resonates with\nKeller's explanation (2000) of why gene talk is useful.\n\n\nIt has been proposed that the real reason biologists center attention\non genes and DNA is that genes are difference makers that can be used\nto trace and manipulate a broad range of biological processes (Waters\n2004a and 2006). This scientific practice makes sense independently of\nany fundamental theory associated with molecular genetics. In the case\nof molecular genetics, it is investigative pragmatics, not fundamental\ntheorizing, that drives scientific research. The basic theory suffices\nto explain the investigative utility and results of gene-centered\napproaches. The fundamental theory is, in an important sense,\nepiphenomenal with respect to the design and implementation of\ngene-centered research. On this view, the role of the fundamental\ntheory should be understood in Latourian terms (1987, 1988), as a\nplatform for rallying the troops and bringing resources to research\nendeavors.  The design of the laboratory experiments and the reason\nwhy the experiments work, can be explained in terms of broad\ninvestigative strategies, the basic causal theory of molecular\ngenetics, and the details of the experimental contexts.\n",
