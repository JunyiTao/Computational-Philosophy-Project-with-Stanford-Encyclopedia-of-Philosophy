    "main_text": "Eliminativism about pain || Other arguments for eliminativism\n7. Conclusion\n\nWhen we look at the science of pain, especially at what has happened\nsince the publications of Melzack and Wall\u2019s (1965) and Melzack\nand Casey\u2019s (1968), which revolutionized the scientific research\non pain, we see that the science of pain has increasingly conceived of\npain as less like perception of an objective reality and more like\nemotions (affective states) by first drawing the sensory/affective\ndistinction and then emphasizing more and more its affective aspect.\n(For a review see Price 1999. See Gustafson 2006 for a sustained\nargument that pain is primarily an emotion. A.D. Craig 2003 claims on\nscientific grounds that pains are homeostatic emotions. See also\nChapman & Nakamura 1999 as well as Vogt 2005 for scientific\ngrounds linking pain to emotion.) As we have seen, the trend in\nphilosophy, until very recently, had been in the other direction: as\nnaturalism has started to become an orthodoxy in the second part of\nthe 20th century, philosophers have increasingly sought for ways in\nwhich they could assimilate pain to ordinary perception like vision,\naudition, etc.\n\nOne of the main motivations behind the perceptual/representational\nviews of pain in philosophy is the belief (or hope) that perception as\na species of information gathering can be accounted for entirely in\nphysicalistic terms. Of course, this is a controversial claim. There\nare many who think that perception involving as it does conscious\nphenomenal experience cannot be a purely physical\n phenomenon.[20]\n However, even these theorists may agree that it is a plausible\ntheoretical strategy to pursue an understanding of pain and other\nintransitive bodily sensations in perceptual/representational terms.\nThis strategy, if it works, minimizes the diversity of mental\nphenomena, and thus potentially offers the prospects of a more unified\ntheory of mind. If this theory turns out to be in harmony with the\nrest of our sciences and their fundamental metaphysical and\nmethodological assumptions, so much the better. Indeed, it was the\nplausibility of this strategy and the belief that we will eventually\nsucceed in understanding perception in purely naturalistic terms that\nhave prompted many philosophers to advance perceptual/representational\ntheories of pain. Many in fact believe that philosophy has made some\nprogress in the second half of the last century in developing the\nconceptual tools for a better and more naturalistic understanding of\nperception and the mind in general \u2014 e.g., the notion of a\nmental representation and its (broadly) computational processing.\n\nBut does the scientific trend towards understanding pain as a\nsubjective experience less like a perception and more like an emotion\nwith quite a variable link to injurious stimuli undermine the\nphilosophical project? There is no simple answer. We may say,\n\u201cyes it does,\u201d if we take the perceptual/representational\ntheories as making the strong claim that pain is strictly nothing but\na perception just like other standard perceptions. We may say,\n\u201cno it doesn\u2019t\u201d if we take their claim in a weaker\nsense to the effect that pain involves some form of\nperception understood in a certain way (on the assumption that the\nperceptualists can answer other arguments against their views, such as\nthe argument from focus). Nothing in the scientific understanding of\npain by itself seems to show that pain involves no sensory perception\nat all. On the contrary, as the science of pain has unearthed in the\nlast fifty years or so, there are relatively specialized systems that\nprocess noxious stimuli from the moment they affect peripheral\nreceptors to the central processing of these signals in the spinal\ncord and the brain.\n\nIf we take the weaker claim to the effect that feeling pain involves\nsensory perception but that this doesn\u2019t exhaust its nature\nmostly due to its affective dimension, we may still preserve a\nnaturalistic view of pain by giving a functionalist (or,\npsychofunctionalist) account of its affective aspect. According to\nthis proposal, even though the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain\ncan perhaps be handled\n representationally,[21]\n the affective aspect reduces to the way in which the\nsensory-discriminative information is processed, not for analysis to\nextract information about the proximal or distal properties of the\nstimuli, but rather for its significance for learning as well as the\neffector or motor systems, to set learning and motivational parameters\nfor action on the basis of stimuli\u2019s informational content.\nThere is in fact strong supporting evidence for such a thesis in the\nevolutionary stories of different organisms at different developmental\nhierarchies. The neuroscientific evidence about the affective brain\nseems also to support this idea in\n general.[22]\n\nThis is a view that treats pain as both a weakly representational and\na functional state. Such a view still needs to provide a good answer\nto the problem of focus that we have seen afflicts all\nperceptual/representationalist views. Why is there an asymmetry in\nconcept application, or in the focus of conceptual categorization?\nPointing out that pain has a deeply pronounced negative affect seems\nnot entirely adequate even when we have an adequate account of what\nthis affect consists in.\n\nThese are the major questions that an adequate perceptual account of\npain ought to give satisfactory answers to. Thus, despite significant\nadvances in our philosophical and scientific understanding of pain in\nthe last fifty years or so, there is still a lot of work to be done to\ndevelop a fully satisfactory account of pain.\n\nThere are other philosophical as well as scientific questions about\npain. Do animals feel pain? If they do, is it comparable to the way we\nfeel pain? What are the social, economical, ethical and religious\nimplications of affirmative answers to these questions? How can animal\npain be scientifically studied? What should be the methodology of\nscientific research on animals in general and of animal pain in\nparticular? How can we project the results obtained by pain research\non animals onto humans (or vice versa)? Parallel or similar questions\narise in the case of fetuses and young infants that are even more\npressing and urgent for obvious reasons. What is the relationship\nbetween pain and pleasure, or pain and emotions in general? What are\nthe ethical and religious significance and implications of pain? These\nand many other questions remain to be the focus of many researchers in\nthe field. (The literature addressing these questions is huge and\nstill growing; consult the bibliography of publications on pain cited\nin the Other Internet Resources section below for representative\nworks.) \n",
