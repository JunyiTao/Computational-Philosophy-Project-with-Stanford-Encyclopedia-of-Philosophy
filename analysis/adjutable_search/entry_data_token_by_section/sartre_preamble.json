    "main_text": "\n\nFew philosophers have been as famous in their own life-time as\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905\u201380). Many thousands of Parisians packed\ninto his public lecture, Existentialism is a Humanism,\ntowards the end of 1945 and the culmination of World War 2. That\nlecture offered an accessible version of his difficult treatise,\nBeing and Nothingness (1943), which had been published two\nyears earlier, and it also responded to contemporary Marxist and\nChristian critics of Sartre\u2019s \u201cexistentialism\u201d.\nSartre was much more than just a traditional academic philosopher,\nhowever, and this begins to explain his renown. He also wrote highly\ninfluential works of literature, inflected by philosophical concerns,\nlike Nausea (1938), The Roads to Freedom trilogy\n(1945\u201349), and plays like No Exit (1947),\nFlies (1947), and Dirty Hands (1948), to name just a\nfew. He founded and co-edited Les Temps Modernes and\nmobilised various forms of political protest and action. In short, he\nwas a celebrity and public intellectual par excellence, especially in\nthe period after Liberation through to the early 1960s. Responding to\nsome calls to prosecute Sartre for civil disobedience, the then French\nPresident Charles de Gaulle replied that you don\u2019t arrest\nVoltaire.\n\nWhile Sartre\u2019s public renown remains, his work has had less\nacademic attention in the last thirty or so years ago, and earlier in\nFrance, dating roughly from the rise of\n\u201cpost-structuralism\u201d in the 1960s. Although Gilles Deleuze\ndedicated an article to his \u201cmaster\u201d in 1964 in the wake\nof Sartre\u2019s attempt to refuse the Nobel Prize for literature\n(Deleuze 2004), Michel Foucault influentially declared Sartre\u2019s\nlate work was a \u201cmagnificent and pathetic attempt of a man of\nthe nineteenth century to think the twentieth century\u201d (Foucault\n1966 [1994: \n 541\u20132])[1].\n In this entry, however, we seek to show what remains alive and of\nongoing philosophical interest in Sartre, covering many of the most\nimportant insights of his most famous philosophical book, Being\nand Nothingness. In addition, significant parts of his oeuvre\nremain under-appreciated and thus we seek to introduce them. Little\nattention has been given to Sartre\u2019s earlier, psychologically\nmotivated philosophical works, such as Imagination (1936) or\nits sequel, The Imaginary (1940). Likewise, few philosophers\nhave seriously grappled with Sartre\u2019s later works, including his\nmassive two-volume Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960), or\nhis various works in existential psychoanalysis that examine the works\nof Genet and Baudelaire, as well as his multi-volume masterpiece on\nFlaubert, The Family Idiot (1971\u20132). These are amongst\nthe works of which Sartre was most proud and we outline some of their\ncore ideas and claims. \n",
