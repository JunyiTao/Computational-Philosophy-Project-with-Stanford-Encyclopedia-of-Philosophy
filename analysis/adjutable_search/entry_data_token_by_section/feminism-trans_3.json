The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\nIn 1977 a controversy erupted in lesbian-separatist circles over\nSandy Stone, an openly transsexual woman and an engineer who had been\nworking at Olivia Records (an all-woman recording company). Both she\nand Olivia were explicitly targeted by Raymond in The Transsexual\nEmpire. After leaving Olivia, Stone earned her doctorate under\nDonna Haraway at Santa Cruz, and in 1991 published a reply to Raymond\nand what would become the founding essay in transgender\nstudies, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A (post)transsexual\nmanifesto\u201d (Stryker 2008, 105, 124\u20135).\n",
