    "main_text": "Time Travel\n10. Time Travel\n\nWe are all familiar with time travel stories, and there are few among\nus who have not imagined traveling back in time to experience some\nparticular period or meet some notable person from the past. But is\ntime travel even possible?\n\nOne question that is relevant here is whether time travel is permitted\nby the prevailing laws of nature. This is presumably a matter of\nempirical science (or perhaps the correct philosophical interpretation\nof our best theories from the empirical sciences). But a further\nquestion, and one that falls squarely under the heading of philosophy,\nis whether time travel is permitted by the laws of logic and\nmetaphysics. For it has been argued that various absurdities follow\nfrom the supposition that time travel is (logically and\nmetaphysically) possible. Here is an example of such an argument:\n\n(1)\nIf you could travel back in time, then you could kill your\ngrandfather before your father was ever conceived. (For what\u2019s\nto stop you from bringing a gun with you and simply shooting\nhim?)\n(2)\nIt\u2019s not the case that you could kill your grandfather\nbefore your father was ever conceived. (Because if you did, then you\nwould ensure that you never existed, and that is not something that\nyou could ensure.)\n\u2234 (3)\nYou cannot travel back in time.\n\n\nAnother argument that might be raised against the possibility of time\ntravel depends on the claim that presentism is true. For if presentism\nis true, then neither past nor future objects exist. And in that case,\nit is hard to see how anyone could travel to the past or the\nfuture.\n\nA third argument, against the possibility of time travel to the past,\nhas to do with the claim that backward causation is impossible. For if\nthere can be no backward causation, then it is not possible that, for\nexample, your pushing the button in your time machine in 2020 can\ncause your appearance, seemingly out of nowhere, in, say, 1900. And\nyet it seems that any story about time travel to the past would have\nto include such backward causation, or else it would not really be a\nstory about time travel.\n\nDespite the existence of these and other arguments against the\npossibility of time travel, there may also be problems associated with\nthe claim that time travel is not possible. For one thing,\nmany scientists and philosophers believe that the actual laws of\nphysics are in fact compatible with time travel. And for another\nthing, as we mentioned at the beginning of this section, we often\nthink about time travel stories; but when we do so, those thoughts do\nnot have the characteristic, glitchy feeling that is normally\nassociated with considering an impossible story. To get a sense of the\nrelevant glitchy feeling, consider this story: Once upon a time\nthere was a young girl, and two plus two was equal to five. When\nyou try to consider that literary gem, you mainly have a feeling that\nsomething has gone wrong (you immediately want to respond, \u201cNo,\nit wasn\u2019t\u201d), and the source of that feeling seems to be\nthe metaphysical impossibility of the story being told. But nothing\nlike this happens when you consider a story about time travel\n(especially if it is one of the logically consistent stories about\ntime travel, such as the one depicted in the movie Los\nCronocr\u00edmenes (Timecrimes)). One task facing the\nphilosopher who claims that time travel is impossible, then, is to\nexplain the existence of a large number of well-known stories that\nappear to be specifically about time travel, and that do not cause any\nparticular cognitive dissonance.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Bernstein 2015,\n2017; Dyke 2005; Earman 1995; Markosian (forthcoming); Meiland 1974;\nMiller 2017; Sider 2001; Thorne 1994; Vihvelin 1996; Yourgrau\n1999.\n",
