Tort Law in the History of Philosophy\n\nTort law has been an object of philosophical reflection at least since\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics. It also figured in\nmedieval discussions by Thomas Aquinas and Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n(Gordley 2006), as well as in early modern discussions of the law of\nobligations by writers such as Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf.\nAristotle distinguished between the role of a court in providing a\nremedy in a private dispute from the role of other public officials in\nseeing to it that some good or burden was allocated in accordance with\na specified criterion. Justinian\u2019s Digest (533), a\ncompilation of Roman law from the sixth century, included extended\ndiscussions of tort cases and principles. Civil law jurisdictions also\ndrew heavily on the writings of legal scholars. Historically, the\ncommon law did not begin with any attempt at theoretical\nsystematization, but rather developed through the decisions of judges\nwho considered it important to limit their reasoning to the particular\ncase and pleading before them. Until the nineteenth century, English\nlaw had highly specialized \u201cforms of action\u201d determining\nthe ways in which the plaintiff could plead a case. The forms of\naction did not classify various specific wrongs as falling under a\ngeneral category of tort. Academic writing tended to stay close to the\ndoctrine, with only occasional general pronouncements and with little\nby way of systematic elaboration (Seavey 1942). Some writers continue\nto express doubts about whether tort law can be systematized (Weir\n2006; Murphy 2019; Stapleton 2021; for further discussion, see Thomas\n2019).\n\nPhilosophical writing about the common law of torts developed in the\ntwentieth century, largely but not exclusively in response to a series\nof seminal arguments by the legal scholar and jurist Oliver Wendell\nHolmes Jr. in his 1881 book The Common Law. Holmes set the\nstage for much of contemporary philosophy of torts by asking how we\nshould understand tort law\u2019s apparent use of straightforward\nmoral terminology\u2014duties, rights, wrongs, injustice, malice,\nintent. Holmes himself was concerned with responding to what he saw as\nthe excessive formalism of legal scholarship and education, as\nexemplified in the writings and introduction of methods of study by\nChristopher Columbus Langdell, Dean of Harvard Law School. A central\ntheme of Holmes\u2019s book is captured by his famous claim that\n\u201cthe life of the law has not been logic; it has been\nexperience\u201d (1881: 1). Throughout his discussion of the common\nlaw, Holmes aimed to bring the resources of social science to bear on\nunderstanding law in terms of the facts available to decision-makers\nand the likely consequences of legal rules. He believed that this\napproach would make the study of law more practical and useful,\nenabling lawyers to better advise their clients about the likely\nconsequences of various courses of action.\n\nTort law has a central place in this Holmesian shift of focus, not\nonly because a lawyer would want assistance in advising clients on\nwhether to settle tort claims, but also for a systematic philosophical\nreason. Holmes recognized the clear parallels between the law of torts\nand familiar parts of commonsense morality, and wanted to emphasize\nthe differences. He therefore begins his discussion of tort law by\nnoting that \n\n\nThe law of torts abounds in moral phraseology. It has much to say of\nwrongs, of malice, fraud, intent and negligence. Hence it may\nnaturally be supposed that the risk of a man\u2019s conduct is thrown\nupon him as a result of some moral short-coming. (1881: 79) \n\n\nHolmes suggests that the appearance is misleading, and that the law is\nmuch more concerned with practical problem solving than with how a\nwrongdoer would be judged \u201cin the courts of heaven\u201d (1881:\n108). Much of the philosophical discussion of tort law over the past\nhalf century has been focused on understanding the role and\nsignificance of the moral vocabulary that pervades tort law.\n\nTogether with the English legal scholar Sir Frederick Pollock, with\nwhom he corresponded for many decades, Holmes also set a pair of\nquestions for tort theory. The first is whether there is a general\nprinciple of liability underlying all of tort law or simply a\nmiscellany of different causes of action. The Holmes/Pollock answer\nwas affirmative: they each argued in their own way that the basis of\nliability was causing harm without justification or excuse. As Pollock\nput it: \n\n\nAll members of a civilised commonwealth are under a general duty\ntowards their neighbors to do them no hurt without lawful cause or\nexcuse. The precise extent of the duty, as well as the nature and\nextent of the recognised exceptions, varies according to the nature of\nthe case. (1897: 1) \n\n\nThe Holmesian formulation of this idea is still a commonplace of legal\neducation in North America; Holmes\u2019s analysis draws attention to\nmultiple factors that might serve to justify otherwise objectionable\nharms, most of which focused on the economic and social benefits of\npermitting people to harm each other in particular situations\n(1894).\n\nHolmes and Pollock raised their second question by introducing a\nclassification of bases for liability, with a distinction between\nwrongs for which liability was strict, wrongs for which liability was\npredicated on negligence, and wrongs for which intention was required\n(Stevens 2019). These classifications had an important role in shaping\nsubsequent debates, raising questions of both conceptual analysis and\nnormative justification.\n\nHolmes\u2019s main focus was the tort of negligence. It is the tort\nthat generates the most litigation in contemporary legal systems. It\nis also the tort that has been most frequently supplanted by\nalternative systems, such as no-fault automobile insurance and\nworkplace safety regulation and compensation schemes and, in the case\nof New Zealand, a general public insurance scheme which replaced\nactions in negligence in cases of personal injury (Woodhouse Report\n1967; Price Waterhouse Cooper Report 2008). Policy debates about doing\naway with the tort of negligence give philosophical debates about its\nstructure and purpose a special urgency. If, as most scholars are\nprepared to concede, a legal system acts within its proper authority\nin introducing these alternative responses to accidental injury, is\nanything of moral significance lost when they are?\n\nHolmes\u2019s discussion of the tort of negligence drew attention to\nanother set of philosophical questions about tort law. One of the\nelements of the tort of negligence requires that the plaintiff\nestablish that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care. The\nstandard of care is said to be \u201cobjective\u201d in the sense\nthat the inquiry is not about whether the defendant exercised the most\ncare of which they were capable but rather whether the defendant\nexercised the degree of care that a reasonable person would exercise\nin the circumstances. The leading case involved a farmer who was\nwarned that his hayrick was at risk of spontaneous combustion; his\nwell-meaning attempt to reduce the risk increased it, and the\nresulting fire spread to some cottages owned by his neighbor. Although\nthe court accepted his claim that he had acted to the best of his\nabilities, he was held liable anyway. Holmes marks the contrast in\nterms of the question before the court: \n\n\nSuppose that a defendant were allowed to testify that, before acting,\nhe considered carefully what would be the conduct of a prudent man\nunder the circumstances, and, having formed the best judgment he\ncould, acted accordingly. If the story was believed, it would be\nconclusive against the defendant\u2019s negligence judged by a moral\nstandard which would take his personal characteristics into account.\nBut supposing any such evidence to have got before the jury, it is\nvery clear that the court would say, Gentlemen, the question is not\nwhether the defendant thought his conduct was that of a prudent man,\nbut whether you think it was. (1881: 107) \n\n\nHolmes points to the objectivity of the standard as evidence of the\nnon-moral character of the law\u2019s seemingly moral vocabulary,\nwriting \n\n\nIf, for instance, a man is born hasty and awkward, is always having\naccidents and hurting himself or his neighbors, no doubt his\ncongenital defects will be allowed for in the courts of heaven, but\nhis slips are no less troublesome to his neighbors than if they sprang\nfrom guilty neglect. (1881: 108)\n\n\nThe character of the reasonable person is at once completely familiar\nand perplexing. English cases historically referred to the reasonable\nperson as the \u201cman in[on] the Clapham Omnibus\u201d (McQuire v\nWestern Morning News 1903), and American cases have described him as\n\u201cthe man who takes the magazines at home and in the evening\npushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves\u201d (Hall v Brooklands\nAuto Racing Club 1933), using these familiar stereotypes with all of\ntheir cultural baggage as exemplars. The philosophically interesting\nquestion is why these stereotypes are held out as the standard for\npeople who differ from them: given differences in attention, strength,\nand ability, why is there a uniform standard for everyone?\n\nYet another central question in contemporary debates in tort theory\nconcerns the point of the entire practice of tort liability. In his\nclassic discussion, Holmes suggested that the point of tort liability\ncould not be compensation, because a tort action is an extremely\ninefficient mechanism for delivering compensation. Compared to such\nthings as the workplace safety compensation schemes that were being\nintroduced in Holmes\u2019s time, the tort system is extremely\nexpensive in its delivery of compensation to injured parties, because\nit spends so much time and money litigating disputes, and only\ndelivers compensation to those who are injured by others who have been\nfound to be wrongdoers and who can afford to pay. Holmes\u2019s own\nproposal, echoed by some in more recent decades, is to require each\nperson to carry their own insurance against injury or property damage\n(Atiyah 1997). A system of first-party private or social insurance\nwould compensate injured parties based on the seriousness of the\ninjury they suffered, rather than based on a distinction, which is\narbitrary from the point of view of compensation, between injuries\nsuffered as a result of the careless acts of others and all other\ninjuries.\n\nConsidered as a system of compensation, Holmes concluded, tort\nliability is an abject failure. In its place, Holmes proposed that the\npoint of tort liability was two-fold: to hold people responsible for\ndamage that they cause and to deter others from creating dangers. Each\nof these ideas has been important to subsequent analyses of tort law.\nThe idea of responsibility figures in Holmes\u2019s threefold account\nof degrees of culpability. It sharpens the issue of the basis of the\nobjective standard in negligence, which holds people to a standard\nthey may be unable to meet. Various developments of this emphasis on\nresponsibility figure prominently in some contemporary accounts of\ntort liability, particularly those of Tony Honor\u00e9 and those\ninfluenced by him (Honor\u00e9 1999; Perry 2001; Gardner 2001;\n2018). Holmes\u2019s emphasis on deterrence, in turn, is the source\nof much writing seeking to show that the law of tort is a method of\nregulating safety by providing incentives for people to take\nprecautions against the risk of injury. In the second half of the last\ncentury, this aspect of Holmes\u2019s approach shaped the development\nof the economic analysis of law, which has become a dominant force in\nlegal scholarship and education in the United States.\n\nHolmes is not always explicit about whether he is proposing to explain\nthe law as he finds it or to revise it; he suggests that the\ntraditional law may be inadequate to its tasks of providing for safety\nin an industrialized world: \n\n\n[o]ur law of torts comes from the old days of isolated, ungeneralized\nwrongs, assaults, slanders, and the like, \n\n\nwhereas \n\n\nthe torts with which our courts are kept busy today are mainly the\nincidents of certain well known businesses \u2026 railroads,\nfactories, and the like\u2026 The public really pays the damages,\nand the question of liability, if pressed far enough, is really the\nquestion how far it is desirable that the public should insure the\nsafety of those whose work it uses. (1897: 467)\n\n\nAs a judge on the US Supreme Court, Holmes decided cases in ways that\nsome have argued are at odds with his theoretical pronouncements about\nthe law of negligence, focusing on the rights of the parties rather\nthan questions of insurance. One important case concerned the question\nof whether the defendant could be liable for causing economic losses\nin the absence of damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property. Holmes\nheld that there was no liability because no right had been violated.\nThe absence of liability in such cases is largely settled, but this\nrationale for disallowing pure economic losses continues to be\ncontested.\n\nHolmes\u2019s efforts to treat tort law as a unified subject and to\nanalyze that unity in terms of its social and economic effects shaped\ndoctrinal scholarship in the United States of America in the middle\npart of the twentieth century. Skeptical of the ways in which legal\ndoctrine presents itself, scholars sought to analyze tort law in terms\nof how it functions to brings about certain social and economic\neffects. The rise of functionalism in tort theory interacted with the\nrise of legal realism with its more general skepticism about the\nability of legal rules to generate determinate results and its related\nemphasis on the ways in which judges sought to achieve particular\npolitical and economic purposes through legal decisions. This approach\nwas captured in the title of a prominent article, \u201cTort Law:\nPublic Law in Disguise\u201d (Green 1959). Some realist-inspired\nwriters suggested that the function of tort law was to achieve both\ndeterrence and compensation; others emphasized one or the other of\nthese goals (Prosser 1941).\n",
