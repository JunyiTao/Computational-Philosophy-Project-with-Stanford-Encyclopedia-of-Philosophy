Let us start with the degenerate case in which\n(supposedly) there is no intentional content to begin with.\n4.5.1 Nonintentional mental states\n\nIf every sensory quality is a represented property, then phenomenal\ncharacter in sense (3) is exhausted by the intentionality of the\nrelevant experience. Since vision is pretty plainly representational,\nit is no surprise that representationalists have talked mainly about\ncolor qualities. But many other mental states that have phenomenal\ncharacter are not intentional and do not represent anything: bodily\nsensations, and especially moods. Rey (1998): \u201cMany have noted\nthat states like that of elation, depression, anxiety, pleasure,\norgasm seem to be just overall states of oneself, and not\nfeatures of presented objects\u201d (p. 441, italics original). For\nthat matter, it is hardly obvious that every specifically perceptual\nexperience represents\u2014smell, for example, does not clearly do\nso.\n\nThe representationalist has several options here. First, s/he could\nrestrict the thesis to perceptual experiences, or to states that are\nadmitted to be intentional. But that would be ad hoc, and would leave\nthe phenomenal character of the excluded mental states entirely\nunexplained.\n\nSecond, representationalists such as Lycan (1996, 2001) and Tye (1995,\n2003b) have, in some detail, defended Brentano\u2019s thesis that in\nfact every mental state is intentional, including bodily sensations\nand moods. It is easy enough to argue that pains and tickles and even\norgasms have some representational features (see Tye (1995) and Lycan\n(1996)). For example, a pain is felt as being in a certain part of\none\u2019s body, as if that part is disordered in a certain\nway; that is why pains are described as \u201cburning,\u201d\n\u201cstabbing,\u201d \u201cthrobbing\u201d and the like. Though\nit is harder to maintain that a mood has intentional content, it is\nplausible to say that a state of elation, for example, represents\none\u2019s surroundings as being beautiful and exciting, and\nfree-floating anxiety represents that something bad is about to\nhappen. However, this does not answer the previous objection that even\nwhen it is admitted that a pain, a tickle, or a general depression\ndoes represent something, that representational content does not loom\nvery large in the overall phenomenal character of the mental state in\nquestion.\n\nThird, if transparency is rejected, other introspectible features of\nan experience can be allowed to count as part of its phenomenal\ncharacter. Lycan (1998) argues that for some mental states, sensory\nqualities do not exhaust their \u201coverall feel.\u201d Consider\npains. Armstrong (1968) and Pitcher (1970) argued convincingly that\npains are representational and have intentional objects, real or\nunreal as usual, which objects are unsalutary conditions of body\nparts; pain is a kind of proprioception. But those intentional objects\nare not all I can introspect about a pain. I can also introspect its\nawfulness, its urgency. We should distinguish the pain\u2019s sensory\nquality, its specifically sensory core (say, the throbbing character\nof a headache) from the pain\u2019s affective and conative aspect\nthat constitutes its awfulness. Those are not normally felt as\ndistinct, but two different neurological subsystems are responsible\nfor the overall experience, and they can come apart. The quality is\nwhat remains under morphine; what morphine blocks is the affective\naspect\u2014the desire that the pain stop, the distraction, the urge\nto pain-behave. It is then open to the materialist to treat the\naffective components as functional rather than representational, and\nthat is not ad hoc.\n\nFourth, recall the distinction between senses (3) and (4) of the\ntricky term \u201cphenomenal character.\u201d As always, the\nrepresentational theory addresses only sense (3). But sense (4), that\nof \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to entertain a given sensory\nquality, can be generalized: It is not only qualities that have the\nhigher-order what-it\u2019s-like property; arguably propositional\nattitudes and other states that do not involve qualities in sense (3),\nsuch as occurrent thoughts, have it too (Siewert (1998), Pitt (2004)).\nSo the representationalist can accuse the present objection of\nconfusing (4) with (3). It remains to be argued how plausible that\naccusation would be.\n4.5.2 Same intentional contents, different sensory qualities\n\nPeacocke (1983) gave three examples of this kind, Block (1995, 1996) a\nfew others; for discussion of those, see Lycan (1996). Tye (2003a)\nprovides an extensive catalogue of further cases, and rebuts them on\nthe representationalist\u2019s behalf. In each case, the\nrepresentationalist tries to show that there are after all intentional\ndifferences underlying the qualitative differences in question.\n\nTrees. In Peacocke\u2019s leading example, your experience\nrepresents two (actual) trees, at different distances from you but as\nbeing of the same physical height and other dimensions; \u201c[y]et\nthere is also some sense in which the nearest tree occupies more of\nyour visual field than the more distant tree\u201d (p. 12). That\nsense is a qualitative sense, and Peacocke maintains that the\nqualitative difference is unmatched by any representational\ndifference.\n\nTye (1995) and others have rejoined that there are after all\nidentifiable representational differences constituting the qualitative\ndifferences in the trees example. Tye points to the fact that one of\nthe trees subtends a larger visual angle from the subject\u2019s\npoint of view, and he argues that this fact is itself\n(nonconceptually) represented by the visual experience. Lycan contends\nthat perceptual representation is layered, and vision in particular\nrepresents physical objects such as trees by representing\nitems called \u201cshapes,\u201d most of which are nonactual; in the\ntrees case differing shapes are represented. Much more promisingly,\nSchellenberg (2008) appeals to \u201csituation-dependent\u201d\nproperties of external objects, by perceiving which we also perceive\nthe high-level properties of the same objects. Byrne (2001) merely\nobserves that one of the trees is represented as being farther from\nthe subject than the other. Bourget (2015) even less commissively\npoints out that your experience represents fewer small features of the\nfarther tree. For further discussion, see Millar (2010).\n\nPeacocke\u2019s second and third examples concern, respectively,\nbinocular vision and the Necker reversible-cube illusion. On the\nformer, see Tye (1992) and Lycan (1996). The latter has given rise to\na distinctive literature.\n\nAspect-perception and attention. The Necker cube is one of a\ngrowing family of alleged counterexamples involving aspect-perception\nor selective attention. Others include ambiguous pictures such as the\nfamous duck-rabbit; arrays of dots or geometric figures which can be\n\u201cgrouped\u201d by vision in alternate ways; or other displays\nwhich can be attended to in multiple ways. In each case, a single and\nunchanging figure that seems to be univocally represented by vision\nnonetheless gives rise to differing visual experiences.\n\nRepresentationalists of course respond by trying to specify distinct\nproperties as characteristic representata in the differing\nexperiences. For example, a \u201cduck\u201d experience of the\nduck-rabbit will represent the property of being a bill without\nrepresenting that of being an ear; the \u201crabbit\u201d experience\nwill do the opposite. One way of grouping dots will mobilize the\nconcept of a row but not that of a column, etc. Macpherson (2006)\noffers a rich survey of such examples and rebuts representationalist\nreplies both existing and anticipated.\n\nOne of the most interesting recent examples (not discussed by\nMacpherson) is offered by Nickel (2007):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\u00a01\u00a0\n\u00a02\u00a0\n\u00a03\u00a0 \n\n\u00a04\u00a0\n\u00a05\u00a0\n\u00a06\u00a0 \n\n\u00a07\u00a0\n\u00a08\u00a0\n\u00a09\u00a0  \n   \n\n\n\nNickel says we can see an arbitrarily chosen set of constituent\nsquares \u201cas prominent.\u201d For example, in Figure 1 we can\nsee the squares corresponding to 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 as prominent, or\nalternately see 2, 4, 6, and 8 as prominent, without changing where we\nlook and, it seems, while representing just the same figure and its\nelements all the while. In particular, we need not change the focus of\nour vision, but leave it on the center of Figure 1, yet have different\nexperiences.\n\nThe representationalist has several options here. First, focusing on\nNickel\u2019s phrase \u201csee as prominent,\u201d s/he could claim\nthat a distance illusion is created, so that the \u201cfarther\naway\u201d relation is represented; or, noting that the preposition\n\u201cas\u201d seems already to be representational language, s/he\ncould appropriate Nickel\u2019s own term \u201cprominent\u201d as\ndesignating a property and just leave it unexplicated. Second, the\nrepresentationalist could insist that the figure is pictorial, and\nthen invoke some version of figure-ground, or assimilate the case to\nseeing-as of some other sort (assuming s/he had already provided a\nrepresentational account of seeing-as more generally). Third, s/he\nmight reject Nickel\u2019s assumption that the whole figure is\nactually seen at one time, writing off the contrary impression as what\nNo\u00eb (2004) calls \u201cpresence as absence.\u201d And there are\nother possibilities, though each is bound to be contentious.\n\nBlock (2010) offers cases in which shifts of attention seem to change\nsensory qualities (Carrasco (2006)). \u201cThe effect of attention is\nexperienced in terms of appearance of contrast, speed, size, color\nsaturation, etc. Attended things look bigger, faster, more saturated,\nand higher in contrast\u201d (p. 44). Realism about contrast, speed\nand the rest being assumed, it would seem clear that if an attended\nthing looks (e.g.) bigger than its actual size, that is just a false\nor inaccurate representation. But Block takes pains to forestall that\ninference. For further defense of representationalism against\nthese and still more examples of subjective differences in\n\u201cgrouping\u201d and/or \u201cprominence,\u201d see Green\n(2016).\n\n\nBlurry vision. We must revisit that case (which actually was\nintroduced as a problem for representationalism by Boghossian and\nVelleman (1989)), because it requires a wrinkle in the\nrepresentationalist strategy. The normal representationalist move\nwould be to say that the visual experience represents the relevant\npart of the world as being blurry, but here we want to concede that\nthere is a phenomenal difference between seeing an object as being\nblurry and blurrily seeing a nonblurry object. Tye (2003a) points out\nthat that difference can be characterized informationally: In the\nformer case, as when looking at a blurry painting, vision represents\nthe blurred edges as such, and just where they lie. But in the latter,\nvision provides less information, and fails to represent the sharp\nedges. Tye distinguishes similarly between nonveridically seeing a\nsharp object as blurry, which experience incorrectly represents the\nboundaries as fuzzy, and seeing the same object blurrily, which does\nnot represent them, except to place them within broad limits. Allen\n(2013) contends, to the contrary, that a blurry visual experience\nrepresents objects as having multiple boundaries. Bourget (2015)\nargues that, whatever the positive details, a blurry experience\nloses some of the content that would be represented by a\nsharper experience of the exact same scene.\n4.5.3 Inversions\n\nInversion examples in the tradition of Locke\u2019s \u201cinverted\nspectrum\u201d form a special category of alleged counterexamples to\nrepresentationalism. Some fit the foregoing model (same intentional\ncontents, different sensory qualities), some do not. Lockean inversion\nwas that of color qualities with respect to behavioral dispositions,\nwhich is regarded as possible by everyone except behaviorists and\nWittgensteinians. To find an inversion counterexample to the\nrepresentational theory, the objector would have to posit qualities\ninverted with respect to all representational contents, or, in the\ncase of \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201cquasi-\u201d\nrepresentationalism, qualities inverted with respect to all\nrepresentational contents and all the relevant functional\netc. properties. (It is important to see that the latter inversion\nhypothesis is much more ambitious and should be much more\ncontroversial than the original Lockean idea.)\n\nShoemaker (1991) contends that this strong sort of inversion is\npossible, i.e., that sensory qualities could invert with respect to\nrepresentational contents. But his only argument seems to be that such\nan inversion is imaginable, or conceivable in a thin sense. Since the\nrepresentationalist\u2019s claim is precisely that sensory qualities\njust are representational contents of a certain kind, but not that\nthis is analytically or conceptually true, Shoemaker has given her/him\nno reason to think that the inversion is really, metaphysically,\npossible. (Also, it is too easy to think of color looks inverting with\nrespect to mere representation; cf. the opening paragraph of\nSection 2. One has to try to imagine their inverting with respect to\nvisual representation of the appropriate type.) Yet there are\nfurther inversion scenarios, supported by argument, that the\nrepresentationalist must take seriously.\n\nFish-heads. Building on an example of Byrne\u2019s (2001),\nLevine (2003) supposes that there are creatures whose eyes are on\nopposite sides of their heads and whose heads are fixed, so that they\nnever look at an object with both eyes. Now, imagine one such creature\nwhose eyes\u2019 lenses are color-inverted with respect to each\nother. (It is not that one lens has been inverted; the creatures are\nborn thus mismatched.) It seems that identically colored objects\nsimultaneously presented will look, say, green to one eye but red to\nthe other. Yet the same worldly color property (i.e., a reflectance\nproperty of whatever sort) is being represented by each eye. Now,\nevery eye is normal within the population, so neither can easily be\ndescribed as misrepresenting the colors of red objects. Each\neye just sees the colors differently, and so the difference is not\nexhausted by the common representatum.\n\nThe first point to be made on the representationalist\u2019s behalf\nis that, as Levine goes on to admit (p. 71), the eyes seem to be\nrepresenting the world differently; \u201cspace appears differently\nfilled on the two sides of the head.\u201d Also, if the fish-head\nwere able to turn and look at the same object first with one eye and\nthen with the other and back again, the object would successively\nappear to it to be different colors. So we do not here have a\ncase of phenomenal difference without representational difference.\n\nBut there is still a puzzle. If the two eyes are representing\ndifferent properties and neither is misrepresenting, and only the one\nsurface reflectance property is involved, what are the two distinct\nrepresentata? Several options are available. (i) One could try to find\na basis for saying that one of the eyes is (after all)\nmisrepresenting, though it is hard to imagine what basis that might\nbe. (ii) As Levine points out, one could fall in with the view of\nShoemaker (1994) mentioned in Section 2, that the eyes are\nrepresenting distinct dispositions even though the\ndispositions are realized by the same physical properties. (iii) If\nthe eyes are mutually color-inverted, then they differ functionally. A\npsychosemantics such as Dretske\u2019s (1986) that makes essential\nreference to function might therefore distinguish representata here.\n(iv) To the extent that each creature\u2019s two eyes differ\nfunctionally from each other, the creature has two different and\nnonequivalent visual systems. Perhaps, then, we cannot say that either\neye represents its red object as red, or as green; the same\nreflectance property is one color for one of the visual systems and a\ndifferent color for the other, as it might be between two different\nspecies of organism, and we do not know what those colors are. That\nthe realizing reflectance property is the same in each case does not\nestablish sameness of representatum, because that property may be a\ncommon disjunct of each of two distinct disjunctive properties that\nare respectively colors for the two types of visual system.\n\nInverted Earth. Block (1990) appeals to an \u201cInverted\nEarth,\u201d a planet exactly like Earth except that its real\nphysical colors are (somehow) inverted with respect to ours. The\nInverted Earthlings\u2019 speech sounds just like English, but their\nintentional contents in regard to color are inverted relative to ours:\nWhen they say \u201cred,\u201d they mean green (if it is green\nInverted objects that correspond to red Earthly objects under the\ninversion in question), and green things look green to them\neven though they call those things \u201cred.\u201d Now, an\nEarthling victim is chosen by the customary mad scientists, knocked\nout, fitted with color inverting lenses, transported to Inverted\nEarth, and repainted to match that planet\u2019s human skin and hair\ncoloring. Block contends that after some length of time\u2014a few\ndays or a few millennia\u2014the victim\u2019s word meanings and\npropositional-attitude contents and all other intentional contents\nwill shift to match the Inverted Earthlings\u2019 contents, but,\nintuitively, the victim\u2019s color qualities will remain the same.\nThus, sensory qualities are not intentional contents.\n\nA natural representationalist reply is to insist that if the\nintentional contents would change, so too would the qualitative\ncontents. Block\u2019s nearly explicit argument for denying this is\nthat \u201cqualia\u201d (he fails to distinguish sensory qualities,\nsense (3), from their higher-order \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\nproperties, sense (4)) are narrow, while the intentional contents\nshift under environmental pressure precisely because they are wide. If\nsensory qualities are indeed narrow, and all the intentional contents\nare wide and would shift, then Block\u2019s argument succeeds.\n(Stalnaker (1996) gives a version of Block\u2019s argument that does\nnot depend on the assumption that the qualities are narrow; Lycan\n(1996) rebuts it.)\n\nThree replies are available, then: (i) To insist that the visual\nintentional contents would not shift. Word meanings would shift, but\nit does not follow that visual contents ever would. (ii) To hold that\nalthough all the ordinary intentional contents would shift, there is a\nspecial class of narrow though still representational contents\nunderlying the wide contents; sensory qualities can be identified with\nthe special narrow contents. (iii) To deny that qualitative content is\nnarrow and argue that it is wide, i.e., that two molecularly\nindistinguishable people could indeed experience different qualities.\nThis last is the position that Dretske (1996) has labelled\n\u201cphenomenal externalism,\u201d though (again) in our\nterminology that would have been \u201cqualitative\u201d\nexternalism.\n\nReply (i) has not been much pursued. (ii) has, a bit, by Tye (1994)\nand especially Rey (1998). Rey argues vigorously that\n\u201cqualia\u201d are narrow, and then offers a narrow\nrepresentational theory. (But as previously mentioned, it turns out\nthat Rey\u2019s theory is not a theory of sensory qualities; see\nSection 4.5.) Note that Fregean as opposed to Russellian\nrepresentationalism is well suited to (ii); even if the Russellian\ncontents shift, the Fregean contents need not. Chalmers (2004)\nadvocates such a view. (Papineau (2014) offers a fourth alternative:\nto say that although sensory states do represent worldly properties\nsuch as color and shape, the sensory qualities themselves are simply\nnot representata and do not shift when the environment is inverted;\nrather, they are just narrow properties of subjects. He tries to\nexplain away our feeling that sensory qualities are presented to the\nmind as worldly.)\n\nReply (iii) has been defended by Dretske (1995, 1996), Tye (1995) and\nLycan (1996, 2001). A number of people (even Tye himself (1998)) have\nsince called the original contrary assumption that sensory qualities\nare narrow a \u201cdeep / powerful / compelling\u201d intuition, but\nit proves to be highly disputable. Here are two arguments, though not\nvery strong arguments, for the claim that the qualities are wide.\n\nFirst, if the representational theory is correct, then sensory\nqualities are determined by whatever determines a psychological\nstate\u2019s intentional content; in particular, the color properties\nrepresented are taken to be physical properties instanced in the\nsubject\u2019s environment. What determines a psychological\nstate\u2019s intentional content is given by a\npsychosemantics, in Fodor\u2019s (1987) sense. But every\nknown plausible psychosemantics makes intentional contents wide. Of\ncourse, the representational theory is just what is in question; but\nif one grants that it is independently plausible or at least\ndefensible, the further step to externalism is not a giant step.\n\nSecond, suppose sensory qualities are narrow. Then Block\u2019s\nInverted Earth argument is plausible, and it would show that either\nthe qualities are narrow functional properties or they are properties\nof a very weird kind whose existence is suggested by nothing else we\nknow (see Ch. 6 of Lycan (1996)). But sensory qualities are not\nfunctional properties, at least not narrow ones: recall the Bertie\ndilemma. Also, they are ostensibly monadic properties, while\nfunctional properties are all relational; and see further\nBlock\u2019s anti-functionalist arguments in Block (1978). So, either\nsensory qualities are wide or weirdness is multiplied beyond\nnecessity. Of course, that dichotomy will be resisted by anyone who\noffers a narrow representationalist theory as in (ii) above.\n\nThe Scrambler. Biggs (2009) constructs a complicated example\nin which a human-like species has evolved in such a way that the\nsensory qualities inhering in its members\u2019 perceptual states are\nentirely disconnected both functionally and causal-historically from\ntheir worldly environments. Biggs argues that those states simply lack\nrepresentational content, and he anticipates and rebuts the most\nlikely replies. \n",
