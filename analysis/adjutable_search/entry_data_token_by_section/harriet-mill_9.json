    "main_text": "Taylor Mill\u2019s Influence on Mill || The Middle Ground\n4.4 The Middle Ground\n\nTo feel entirely confident about any judgment about how far Taylor\nMill influenced Mill, we would need not only access to her letters\nwhich were destroyed but recordings from inside their home at\nBlackheath. But as with the descriptions of Taylor Mill\u2019s\ncharacter and ability discussed above, there is a wide middle ground\nbetween the minimalist and maximalist assessments. One intermediate\nview is that of Bain, who suggests that just as Mill\u2019s friend\nJohn Sterling \u201coverflowed in suggestive talk, which Mill took up\nand improved in his own way,\u201d so Taylor Mill might have done as\nwell (1882, 173\u20134). Robson comments that \u201c[I]n what we\nhave of her writings, Harriet constantly has her eye on the future,\neven when criticizing the present; she was a woman of dreams and\naspirations, and she must constantly have breathed into Mill a hopeful\nand expansive view of human possibilities\u201d (1966,\n 178).[8]\n What Bain seems to be suggesting is that Taylor Mill\u2019s greatest\ncontribution to the Mills\u2019 collaboration, apart from any writing\nthat she did herself, was to turn Mill\u2019s attention to the\ndefense of a set progressive ideals and causes reflective of these\npossibilities: Socialism, women\u2019s rights, individual liberty,\nand above all a \u201cutopian\u201d view of humanity\u2019s\nimprovability. This is not necessarily to say that he held these\npositions just because she did, which he explicitly tells us was not\nthe case with women\u2019s rights ([ALE], 253n). Nor must it mean\nthat she contributed little or nothing to the arguments by which he\ndefends them. Bain knew Mill extremely well, and even though he says\nthat his friend was under \u201can extraordinary hallucination as to\nthe personal qualities of his wife,\u201d and \u201coutraged all\nreasonable credibility in describing her matchless genius,\u201d he\nis also adamant not only that Mill \u201cwas not such an egoist as to\nbe captivated by the echo of his own opinions\u201d but also that he\nwould only have been stimulated by someone with \u201cindependent\nresources\u201d who had a \u201cgood mutual understanding as to the\nproper conditions of the problem at issue\u201d (1882,\n173\u20134).\n\nRecent work by feminist scholars also makes a strong case that Taylor\nMill may have influenced Mill\u2019s work in more subtle and less\ndirect ways than commentators usually consider. Helen McCabe suggests\nthat Taylor Mill helped Mill \u201cdevelop an emotional language that\nhad previously been alien to him \u2026 and made him acknowledge,\nface up to, and express his emotions\u201d; she describes this as\n\u201cthe most profound influence anyone could have had\u201d on\nMill, since it \u201cmade him into a much more human, sensitive and\nempathetic philosopher than he would otherwise have been\u201d\n(McCabe 2017, 115). And Philips observes that Taylor Mill\u2019s own\nexperience of patriarchy meant that she brought knowledge to her\ncollaboration with Mill that he could never have acquired on his own\n(Philips 2018).\n",
