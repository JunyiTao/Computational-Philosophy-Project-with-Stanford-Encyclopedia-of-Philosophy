    "main_text": "Non-Separability of Luck and Effort\n10. Relational Egalitarianism and the Critique of Luck-Egalitarianism\n\nMost egalitarians want to compensate people for bad brute luck but not\nfor bad option luck. Moreover, they have tended to assume that this is\nessentially what justice is about. Recently, this attitude has been\ncriticized as either leaving out of the picture an important\nnon-distributive egalitarian concern, to wit, an egalitarian concern\nfor the nature of social relations, or, more radically, as being a\ncomplete misconstrual of egalitarian justice (Anderson 1999; Anderson\n2010; Anderson 2012; Scanlon 2018; Scheffler 2003; Scheffler 2005;\nSchemmel 2021; for an overview see Fourie et. al. (eds.) 2015).\n\nJonathan Wolff defends the moderate position that while distributive\nconcerns about bad brute luck are part of what justice is about, that\nis not the whole story: \u201cDistributive justice should be limited\nin its application by other egalitarian concerns\u201d (Wolff 1998,\n122; cp. Scheffler 2015), for the ideal of justice also includes the\nview that we should respect one another as equals. According to Wolff,\nthis introduces a reason not to strive for perfect equality of\nopportunity. For making people equally well off in terms of\nopportunity would require \u201cshameful revelations\u201d on the\npart of people who must, for instance, pass on to others (and thus\nthemselves come to terms with) the information that they have no\ntalent (for a discussion, see Albertsen and Nielsen 2020; Elford\n2017a; Hinton 2001; Inoue 2022; Lang 2009, 329\u2013338; Preda and\nVoigt 2022; Wolff 2010).\n\nWolff\u2019s point is well made, but luck-egalitarians may be able to\naccommodate it. First, insofar as they accept Wolff\u2019s factual\nobservation, they may think that this points to a strong (welfarist)\nluck-egalitarian reason not to implement equality of opportunity: we\ncan know in advance that collecting the relevant information is likely\nto make some of those who are already worse off through bad luck even\nworse off. Of course, this would not show that if we could\ncollect the relevant information without bad side effects, we should\nnot aim to compensate bad brute luck alone. Additionally,\nluck-egalitarians may simply concede that the pursuit of the\nluck-egalitarian ideal is constrained by, or otherwise balanced\nagainst the pursuit of, other ideals, including that of equal respect.\nIn any case, luck-egalitarians are unlikely to claim that\nluck-neutralization is the only ideal, as that would imply that a\nworld where everyone lives miserable lives is better, all things\nconsidered, than a world where half the people live tremendous lives\nand the other half live even better lives.\n\nLike Wolff, Elizabeth Anderson argues that egalitarians believe people\nshould live in communities based on principles that \u201cexpress\nequal respect and concern for all citizens\u201d (Anderson 1999, 289;\ncompare Scheffler 2003, 22,31). Unlike Wolff, however, Anderson makes\nthe more radical claim that (true) egalitarians have, in a way, no\nnon-instrumental concern about distribution at all: they are concerned\nabout distribution only indirectly, their direct concern being that\nmembers of the community should stand as equals (compare Scheffler\n2003, 22; Anderson 2010). No doubt, to achieve this, large scale\nredistribution of income, wealth, etc., might be required, but the\nelimination of differential brute luck or for that matter distributive\ninequalities per se is not. What is required is the ability of all to\nfunction as equal human beings in civil society and in political\ndecision making.\n\nLuck-egalitarians, inter alia, question whether this picture is\ncorrect (Barry 2006; Knight 2005; Gheaus 2018; Knight 2009,\n122\u2013166; Navin 2011; Tan 2008; Miklosi 2018; but see Kaufman\n2004). First, they might dispute the very way in which Anderson\ndescribes the disagreement. They might do so because they think social\nstanding can be seen as a good, which, setting aside considerations\nabout responsibility, should be distributed equally from a luck\negalitarian point of view (Lippert-Rasmussen 2015a,b;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2018). If so, luck egalitarianism might be able to\naccommodate many of Anderson\u2019s concerns. Or they might think\nthat (most) luck egalitarians and critics like Anderson simply address\ndifferent questions. The former ask what constitutes a fair\ndistribution, whereas the latter asks what we owe one another\n(Vallentyne 2015). These are different (though possibly related)\nquestions, because, arguably, distributions might be unfair even if no\none has failed to do what they owe others, say, if some die young and\nothers die old, and there is nothing anyone could do to prevent this\nfrom being so (cp. Lippert-Rasmussen 2018; Moles and Parr 2019).\nSecond, suppose resources are distributed in such a way that equal\nfunctioning in civil society and in political decision making is\nassured. Suppose, moreover, that we can choose between two\ndistributions: one that benefits those who are worse off in terms of\nhow well their lives go, and another that benefits those who are best\noff in terms of how well their lives go. Since this choice will not\naffect democratic equality, these options are equally good on\nAnderson\u2019s account. To many, this is an unattractive implication\nof her view. Of course, if the threshold of equal functioning is very\nhigh the problem becomes less serious. However, with high thresholds a\ndifferent problem becomes more serious. For if people should be\nassured of equal functioning at a very high level irrespective of\nwhether they act (perhaps repeatedly) in irresponsibly foolish ways,\nit will not seem fair to impose the cost of their choices on\nothers\u2014i.e., the cost of bringing them up to the appropriate\nthreshold of equal functioning (Arneson 2000, 347\u2013348; for a\nreply, see Anderson (Other Internet Resources, 2(e)). Intuitively,\nthen, the complaint is that democratic equality ascribes no\nsignificance to the fact that responsibility can negate luck. It is\nfar from clear that concern about equal status overturns the pivotal\nbelief that justice is concerned with compensation for bad luck (see,\nhowever, Scheffler 2003; Scheffler 2005; Scheffler 2015). Indeed, the\npresent line of thought suggests that luck-ist versions of the\nrelational ideal might be more plausible than non-luckist versions.\nWhile much of the relational egalitarian critique of luck\negalitarianism has focused on the weight it gives to considerations\nconcerning luck, the issue of how this question is resolved is a\ndifferent issue from the issue of whether justice concerns\ndistributions or relations (or both). This is reflected in the fact\nthat two possible views are outcome egalitarianism and luckist\nversions of relational egalitarianism, according to which to relate as\nequals the way in which we treat one another must reflect differential\nchoice, responsibility etc. On the latter view I might not relate to\nothers as equals if I expect them to bear the costs of my\nirresponsible choices.\n",
