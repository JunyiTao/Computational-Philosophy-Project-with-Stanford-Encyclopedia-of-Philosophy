A brief\nlook at those criticisms follows, with recommendations for further\nreading at the end of the entry.\n\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962) begins with a well-known shot across the bow for philosophers\nof science:\n\n\nHistory, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or\nchronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of\nscience by which we are now possessed. (1962: 1)\n\n\nThe image Kuhn thought needed transforming was the a-historical,\nrational reconstruction sought by many of the Logical Positivists,\nthough Carnap and other positivists were actually quite sympathetic to\nKuhn\u2019s views. (See the entry on the\n Vienna Circle.)\n Kuhn shares with other of his contemporaries, such as Feyerabend and\nLakatos, a commitment to a more empirical approach to philosophy of\nscience. Namely, the history of science provides important data, and\nnecessary checks, for philosophy of science, including any theory of\nscientific method.\n\nThe history of science reveals, according to Kuhn, that scientific\ndevelopment occurs in alternating phases. During normal science, the\nmembers of the scientific community adhere to the paradigm in place.\nTheir commitment to the paradigm means a commitment to the puzzles to\nbe solved and the acceptable ways of solving them. Confidence in the\nparadigm remains so long as steady progress is made in solving the\nshared puzzles. Method in this normal phase operates within a\ndisciplinary matrix (Kuhn\u2019s later concept of a paradigm) which\nincludes standards for problem solving, and defines the range of\nproblems to which the method should be applied. An important part of a\ndisciplinary matrix is the set of values which provide the norms and\naims for scientific method. The main values that Kuhn identifies are\nprediction, problem solving, simplicity, consistency, and\nplausibility.\n\nAn important by-product of normal science is the accumulation of\npuzzles which cannot be solved with resources of the current paradigm.\nOnce accumulation of these anomalies has reached some critical mass,\nit can trigger a communal shift to a new paradigm and a new phase of\nnormal science. Importantly, the values that provide the norms and\naims for scientific method may have transformed in the meantime.\nMethod may therefore be relative to discipline, time or place\n\nFeyerabend also identified the aims of science as progress, but argued\nthat any methodological prescription would only stifle that progress\n(Feyerabend 1988). His arguments are grounded in re-examining accepted\n\u201cmyths\u201d about the history of science. Heroes of science,\nlike Galileo, are shown to be just as reliant on rhetoric and\npersuasion as they are on reason and demonstration. Others, like\nAristotle, are shown to be far more reasonable and far-reaching in\ntheir outlooks then they are given credit for. As a consequence, the\nonly rule that could provide what he took to be sufficient freedom was\nthe vacuous \u201canything goes\u201d. More generally, even the\nmethodological restriction that science is the best way to pursue\nknowledge, and to increase knowledge, is too restrictive. Feyerabend\nsuggested instead that science might, in fact, be a threat to a free\nsociety, because it and its myth had become so dominant (Feyerabend\n1978).\n\nAn even more fundamental kind of criticism was offered by several\nsociologists of science from the 1970s onwards who rejected the\nmethodology of providing philosophical accounts for the rational\ndevelopment of science and sociological accounts of the irrational\nmistakes. Instead, they adhered to a symmetry thesis on which any\ncausal explanation of how scientific knowledge is established needs to\nbe symmetrical in explaining truth and falsity, rationality and\nirrationality, success and mistakes, by the same causal factors (see,\ne.g., Barnes and Bloor 1982, Bloor 1991). Movements in the Sociology\nof Science, like the Strong Programme, or in the social dimensions and\ncauses of knowledge more generally led to extended and close\nexamination of detailed case studies in contemporary science and its\nhistory. (See the entries on\n the social dimensions of scientific knowledge\n and\n social epistemology.)\n Well-known examinations by Latour and Woolgar (1979/1986),\nKnorr-Cetina (1981), Pickering (1984), Shapin and Schaffer (1985) seem\nto bear out that it was social ideologies (on a macro-scale) or\nindividual interactions and circumstances (on a micro-scale) which\nwere the primary causal factors in determining which beliefs gained\nthe status of scientific knowledge. As they saw it therefore,\nexplanatory appeals to scientific method were not empirically\ngrounded.\n\nA late, and largely unexpected, criticism of scientific method came\nfrom within science itself. Beginning in the early 2000s, a number of\nscientists attempting to replicate the results of published\nexperiments could not do so. There may be close conceptual connection\nbetween reproducibility and method. For example, if reproducibility\nmeans that the same scientific methods ought to produce the same\nresult, and all scientific results ought to be reproducible, then\nwhatever it takes to reproduce a scientific result ought to be called\nscientific method. Space limits us to the observation that, insofar as\nreproducibility is a desired outcome of proper scientific method, it\nis not strictly a part of scientific method. (See the entry on\n reproducibility of scientific results.)\n\nBy the close of the 20th century the search for the\nscientific method was flagging. Nola and Sankey (2000b) could\nintroduce their volume on method by remarking that \u201cFor some,\nthe whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year\u2019s\ndebate \u2026\u201d.\n",
