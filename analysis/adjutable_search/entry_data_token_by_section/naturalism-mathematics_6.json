    "main_text": "Elucidating Methodological Naturalism || The boundary problem and the scientific method\n3.2 The boundary problem and the scientific method\n\n\nNaturalism sets up an opposition between X-standards (scientific,\nmathematical or scientific-cum-mathematical) and other types of\nstandards, e.g., astrological, theological, or the standards of common\nsense. Another example of standards that the naturalist sees as\non the wrong side of the tracks are \u2018fundamental\u2019\nphilosophical ones. Goodman and Quine (in his pre-naturalist phase)\nonce began an article by declaring that the basis for their nominalism\nwas a fundamental philosophical intuition irreducible to scientific\ngrounds (1947). Naturalists reject appeal to such standards.\n\n\nAn apparent problem with naturalism is that there do not seem to be\nsharp boundaries between science and non-science and between\nmathematics and non-mathematics. For example, the transition from\nphysics to philosophy of physics to physics-heavy metaphysics to\ncommon-or-garden metaphysics seems to be gradual. When a mathematician\nwrites a research article, an undergraduate textbook, a popular book on\nmathematics, a book expounding his personal philosophy of mathematics\nand his psychological associations with various mathematical theories,\nat what point exactly has he stopped doing mathematics? When research\nmathematicians get together after the seminar and agree over coffee\nthat the Riemann Hypothesis is the most important outstanding problem\nin mathematics, is this a strictly mathematical claim or a personal\njudgement recognised by mathematicians as outside the province of\nmathematics proper?\n\n\nMany philosophers follow Quine by citing a\nstandard cluster of principles putatively constitutive of scientific\nstandards: empirical adequacy, ontological economy, simplicity,\nfertility, and so on (Quine 1955, 247; Quine and Ullian 1970, chapter\n5). However, lists of this kind are unsatisfactory for several\nreasons.  For one thing, the principles come in different\nversions. Yet it is doubtful whether the general versions are the\nscientifically sanctioned ones. Some writers claim, for example, that\nscientific appeal to ontological parsimony does not extend to the\npostulation of abstract objects (Burgess 1998). Others maintain that\nscientific appeals to simplicity are not best captured by the utterly\ngeneral slogan \u2018Prefer any theory T1 to\nany less simple theory T2 (in this respect)\u2019\n(Paseau 2007). Moreover, lists of this kind do not tell us how to\nbalance desiderata against one another.\n\n\nSince the explosion of science studies in the 1960s, more attention\nis now paid to the nuances of scientific practice. Yet a more\nprecise articulation of scientific standards and their weights remains\nelusive. The existence of an algorithm encapsulating the scientific\nmethod is generally questioned (though many human beings apparently\nmanage to implement the scientific method, so if the method is not\nalgorithmic then neither are our minds). What is not questionable,\nhowever, is that its exhibition currently escapes us.\n\n\nHaving said that, it is not clear how serious the boundary problem\nis for naturalists. Perhaps they can argue that there is a fairly\nsharp boundary, though one that is hard to define. Perhaps\nmathematicians implicitly know when something counts as a piece of\nmathematics and when it is a non-mathematical commentary on\nmathematics. In any case, naturalism seems to survive the absence of a\nsharp boundary. Naturalism can apparently rest its claims on a set of\nstandards with fuzzy boundaries.\n",
