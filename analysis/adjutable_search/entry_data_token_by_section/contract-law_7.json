    "main_text": "Philosophical Themes in the Law of Contracts || Language, meaning, and interpretation\n2.1 Language, meaning, and interpretation\n\nThe law of contracts includes rules that map the parties\u2019 speech\nacts onto legal effects. What the rules are that relate speech to\nlegal obligation and what they ought to be are questions for legal and\nmoral theory. But the conventional answers may be clarified using\nresources from the philosophy of language (Farnsworth 1967; Rosen\n2011).\n\nWe begin with rules specifying the legally relevant feature of the\nparties\u2019 speech. What a person intends to mean by their words\ncan come apart from the actual meaning (the semantic content) of the\nwords. In general, contract law is said to privilege\n\u201cobjective\u201d over intended (or, as lawyers sometimes say:\n\u201csubjective\u201d) meaning as the basis for the parties\u2019\nlegal obligations, at least where the intended meaning is not evident\nfrom context:\n\n\nA contract has, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the personal, or\nindividual, intent of the parties. \u2026 If \u2026 it were proved\nby twenty bishops that either party, when he used the words, intended\nsomething else than the usual meaning which the law imposes upon them,\nhe would still be held, unless there were some mutual mistake or\nsomething else of the sort. (Hotchkiss v. National City Bank\n1911)\n\n\nThis preference for objective meaning, moreover, reaches the\ninterpretation of the speech acts through which contracts are entered\ninto, such as offers and acceptances (R2: \u00a724). Proponents of the\nso-called \u201cobjective theory of contracts\u201d regularly invoke\nthe \u201cusual\u201d, \u201cobjective\u201d,\n\u201creasonable\u201d, or \u201cplain\u201d meaning as\ndistinguished from the meaning that the parties \u201cattached\u201d\nto their words (R2: \u00a7201). Since talk of meaning is often\nambiguous, we must be cautious in interpreting such locutions. The\ngloss that\u2019s sometimes given in law is that objective meaning\nconcerns what a reasonable person in the position of the addressee\nwould have inferred was meant based on the available evidence.\n\nA related set of legal rules specify the core contractual text to be\ninterpreted and what evidence determines its meaning. The \u201cparol\nevidence rule\u201d (\u201cPER\u201d) establishes a preference for\nwritings over prior or contemporaneous oral agreements (UCC:\n\u00a72-202). The rule, in its traditional statement, entails that\nwhere a writing exists, oral agreements (inferable from testimony)\nthat are \u201cextrinsic\u201d to the \u201cfour corners of the\ndocument\u201d do not become part of the contract. Some versions of\nthe PER forbid the use of extrinsic evidence to \u201cintroduce an\nambiguity\u201d into a writing whose terms are otherwise clear and\nunambiguous. In addition, once the contours of a contractual text are\nset, principles of contract interpretation favor (to varying degrees\nin different jurisdictions) giving words meanings that are familiar to\njudges rather than meanings that are idiosyncratic to the parties. The\ninteraction between the PER and the principles of interpretation\nentails a complication that runs through the legal practice of\nextracting meaning\u2014namely that contracts themselves (especially\nwritten contracts) often seek to set their own boundaries and regulate\ntheir own interpretation, and the law both permits and resists such\nefforts.\n\n\u201cTextualism\u201d in contract law can be defined as the view\nthat (a) contractual obligations stem from the objective meaning of\nthe parties\u2019 speech acts, (b) writings trump oral communication,\nand (c) a text\u2019s meaning must be inferred from a restricted\nevidence-base. \u201cContextualists,\u201d by contrast, favor\nconsidering prior and contemporaneous oral agreements, which might\nhelp interpret, add to, or even vary the terms of a writing. There are\ngood reasons in favor of either textualist or contextualist approaches\nto fixing meaning, relating to the costs of drafting in the shadow of\nvarious interpretive regimes, the costs of litigating meaning, and the\ntemptations that parties face to make opportunistic claims about what\ntheir contracts require. But textualists and contextualists\nsometimes\u2014and much less plausibly\u2014cast their positions as\nrequired by basic and very general features of language.\n\nTextualists\u2014for example, Alex Kozinski, formerly a judge of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit)\u2014worry that\ncontextualism:\n\n\nchips away at the foundation of our legal system. By giving\ncredence to the idea that words are inadequate to express\nconcepts, [contextualism] undermines the basic principle that\nlanguage provides a meaningful constraint on public and private\nconduct. (Trident Center v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.\n1988)\n\n\nContextualists, for their part, sometimes seem to reject widely shared\nassumptions about language. Kozinski\u2019s opinion criticized a\nleading contextualist opinion by Roger Traynor, writing as Chief\nJustice of the Supreme Court of California. Traynor held that courts\nshould consider all extrinsic, contextual evidence to determine\nwhether written terms are ambiguous, while defending the holding based\non doubts about the \u201cinherent meaning of words\u201d:\n\n\nIf words had absolute and constant references, it might be possible to\ndiscover the contractual intention in the words themselves and in the\nmanner in which they were arranged. Words, however, do not have\nabsolute and constant references. A word is a symbol of thought but\nhas no arbitrary fixed meaning like a symbol of algebra or chemistry.\n(Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage &\nRigging Co. 1968)\n\n\nTraynor followed an influential tradition in legal scholarship\nskeptical not just of the parol evidence rule, but of the very\npossibility that the impersonal semantic content of the parties\u2019\nspeech acts might come apart from the contextually salient intended\nmeaning (see, e.g., Wigmore 1923: 378).\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, these general arguments paint too\nquickly and with too broad a brush. On the one hand, practical\nconsiderations that support looking to broader context when\ninterpreting writings plainly do not undermine anything so general as\nthe idea that words can convey shared meaning. On the other hand, it\nwould equally be surprising if embracing contextualism meant having to\ndeny the platitude that speakers of language can be mistaken in ways\nthat allow public (or even legal) meaning to come apart in\ncontextually manifest ways from intended meaning. Contextualist\nskepticism about impersonal semantic content is surely separable from\nthe practical question of whether restricting the evidence base for\ndiscerning meaning best serves the various goals of contract law,\nincluding fairness to the parties and minimizing burdens on courts\n(Rosen 2011).\n\nGideon Rosen suggests an alternative conceptual framework for the\ndebate between textualists and contextualists, one that deemphasizes\nthe parties\u2019 semantic intentions. Following Grice (1957), we can\ndistinguish the parties\u2019 semantic intentions in relation to\ntheir speech acts (intentions to mean this or that by one\u2019s\nwords) from their pragmatic and distinctly legal intentions (the\nintent to cause legal effects via one\u2019s speech acts, like the\ncreation of a judicially enforceable promise). The parties\u2019\nlegal intentions\u2014which seem to matter, ultimately\u2014can come\napart from their semantic intentions. In re Soper\u2019s\nEstate (1935) offers an illustration. In that case, the deceased\ndesignated his \u201cwife\u201d as the beneficiary of his estate.\nHowever, Soper was legally married to person 1, faked his own death,\nand then \u201cmarried\u201d person 2. We can set aside what\n\u201cwife\u201d objectively means in this context. We can also\nstipulate that Soper\u2019s legal intention was to leave his estate\nto person 2. Suppose Soper\u2019s semantic intention was to refer to\n2 under the description my wife in the legal sense on the\nerroneous assumption that his prior marriage to 1 was not a legal\nimpediment. Clearly, the semantic intention to refer to 2 as his\nlegally recognized wife would have been irrelevant to what Soper was\ntrying to accomplish legally by writing his will. We can, of course,\nconstruct alternative scenarios where the semantic intention\nis relevant to Soper\u2019s legal intent. Indeed, contract\nlaw\u2019s interest in semantic intentions is explained by the fact\nthat, in general, what we intend to mean by our words bears on what we\nare trying to accomplish legally. But In re Soper\u2019s\nEstate illustrates that the connection is contingent\u2014the\nalignment that usually exists between the legal effects that we intend\nto produce and the descriptions under which we intend to produce them\nis far from guaranteed.\n\nAccordingly, the debate between textualists and contextualists might\nbe fruitfully recast in terms of: (a) whether the parties\u2019\nspeech acts should be mined for impersonal semantic content or the\nparties\u2019 legal intentions, and (b) whether the court should rely\non a narrow or broad evidence base to infer the legally relevant facts\nabout speech (Rosen 2011, 163). Rosen\u2019s framework is not\nintended to apply to situations where the parties have conflicting\nlegal intentions or cases where the contract is silent on the\nparties\u2019 responsibilities. Separate legal rules and\nconsiderations\u2014those concerning misunderstanding (R2: \u00a7201)\nand gap-filling (R2: \u00a7204)\u2014bear on such cases.\n\nIn re Soper\u2019s Estate illustrates a more general\nphenomenon of philosophical interest: natural language as a source of\ncontract disputes (Farnsworth 1967). Work in this area aims to\ncharacterize and distinguish the ways in which the parties\u2019\nlinguistic choices can interfere with contractual coordination. Famous\ncontract disputes have involved homonymy (two ships bear the name\n\u201cPeerless\u201d and the parties do not intend to refer to the\nsame ship: Raffles v. Wichelhaus (1864)), semantic ambiguity\n(the word \u201cchicken\u201d in the trade has a broader and\nnarrower meaning: Frigaliment Importing v B.N.S (1960)),\nsyntactic ambiguity (an insurance policy covers any \u201cdisease of\norgans of the body not common to both sexes\u201d: Business\nMen\u2019s Assur. Ass\u2019n v. R (1927)), pragmatic or\n\u201clatent\u201d ambiguity (In re Soper\u2019s Estate,\ndiscussed above); vagueness (parties agree that a \u201cmaterially\nadverse change\u201d to the financial health of a business qualifies\nthe buyer\u2019s obligations: In re Carter\u2019s Claim\n(1957)) and under-specification (parties agree to the sale of\n\u201cone of the seller\u2019s warehouses\u201d). For a general\ndiscussion of how to distinguish these and related phenomena, see the\nentry on\n ambiguity.\n",
