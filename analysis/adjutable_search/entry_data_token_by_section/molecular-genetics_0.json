    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe term molecular genetics is now redundant because\ncontemporary genetics is thoroughly molecular. Genetics is not made up\nof two sciences, one molecular and one non-molecular. Nevertheless,\npracticing biologists still use the term. When they do, they are\ntypically referring to a set of laboratory techniques aimed at\nidentifying and/or manipulating DNA segments involved in the synthesis\nof important biological molecules. Scientists often talk and write\nabout the application of these techniques across a broad swath of\nbiomedical sciences. For them, molecular genetics is an\ninvestigative approach that involves the application of\nlaboratory methods and research strategies. This approach presupposes\nbasic knowledge about the expression and regulation of genes at the\nmolecular level.\n\n\nPhilosophical interest in molecular genetics, however, has centered, not on\ninvestigative approaches or laboratory methods, but on theory. Early\nphilosophical research concerned the basic theory about the\nmake-up, expression, and regulation of genes. Most attention\ncentered on the issue of theoretical reductionism. The motivating\nquestion concerned whether classical genetics, the science of T. H.\nMorgan and his collaborators, was being reduced to molecular genetics.\nWith the rise of developmental genetics and developmental biology,\nphilosophical attention has subsequently shifted towards critiquing a\nfundamental theory associated with contemporary genetics. The\nfundamental theory concerns not just the make-up,\nexpression, and regulation of genes, but also the overall role of genes\nwithin the organism. According to the fundamental theory, genes and\nDNA direct all life processes by providing the information that\nspecifies the development and functioning of organisms.\n\n\nThis article begins by providing a quick review of the basic theory\nassociated with molecular genetics. Since this theory incorporates\nideas from the Morgan school of classical genetics, it is useful to\nsketch its development from Morgan's\ngenetics. After reviewing the basic theory, I examine four questions\ndriving philosophical investigations of molecular genetics. The first\nquestion asks whether classical genetics has been or will be reduced to\nmolecular genetics. The second question concerns the gene concept and\nwhether it has outlived its usefulness. The third question regards the\ntenability of the fundamental theory. The fourth question, which\nhasn't yet attracted much philosophical attention,\nasks why so much biological research is centered on genes and\nDNA. \n",
