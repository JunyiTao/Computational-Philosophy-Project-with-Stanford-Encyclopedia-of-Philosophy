One prominent methodological\nstrand of philosophical theology is perfect being theology,\nin which the nature of God is made more explicit by identifying God as\nan absolutely perfect being and working out what features an\nabsolutely perfect being must exhibit (Morris 1989c; Rogers 2000;\nNagasawa 2008). As it is a commonplace that one of the perfections\nthat would have to be exhibited by any being that would qualify as\nabsolutely perfect is perfect goodness, it is obvious why\nphilosophical theologians employing perfect being theology would be\nmotivated to reflect in some detail on the character of perfect\ngoodness and to consider various challenges to the very idea.\n\nThis article will take for granted the importance of situating\nreflection on perfect goodness within philosophical theology. But it\nshould be noted that one need not proceed in this way. One might\ninstead attempt to reflect on the character of perfect goodness in a\nway that entirely abstracts from theological concerns, or indeed any\nconcerns about the particular being by whom, or by which, perfect\ngoodness is realized (McGinn 1992; Conee 1994). But typically such\nreflection focuses specifically on perfect goodness as realized in\nGod, a being that exhibits not only perfect goodness, but every\nother perfection as well. One might also wonder whether there is any\nsuch thing as a general standard for perfect goodness; perhaps perfect\ngoodness is kind-relative, such that there is nothing that privileges\nthe question of what counts as perfect goodness for God over the\nquestion of what counts as perfect goodness for humans, or angels, or\nMartians, or any other particular type of rational being. (Indeed, one\nmight go further, asking why we should privilege the goodness of\nrational beings over that of hedgehogs, movies, or landscapes.) But\nthis article will take the perfect goodness of God as privileged, and\nwill treat as a crucial difficulty for some conception of perfect\ngoodness that it cannot be exemplified with other features that an\nabsolutely perfect being would have to exemplify.\n", "toc": [{"#PerGooPerGenVerPerGooSpePer": "1.

Perfect goodness as perfection in general versus perfect goodness as a specific perfection\n\nThere is a potential ambiguity in the expression \u2018perfect\ngoodness\u2019 that needs to be resolved. One might think that the\ninvestigation of the character of perfect goodness is nothing more or\nless than the investigation of the character of absolute perfection.\nOne might think, that is, that what one means when one applies the\nexpression \u2018perfectly good\u2019 to some being is the same as\nwhat one means when one applies the expression \u2018absolutely\nperfect\u2019 to some being; to say that a being is perfectly good is\njust to say that it instantiates perfectly those features that make a\nbeing intrinsically good. Here \u2018perfect goodness\u2019 just is\nperfection in general, and to call a being perfectly good is just to\nsay that it qualifies as an absolutely perfect being (Reichenbach\n1982, p. 138; Morris 1989d, p. 43; and Wierenga 1989, p. 202.)\n\u2018Perfect goodness\u2019 in that sense, though, is not what is\nunder investigation here; that sort of \u2018perfect goodness\u2019\nis the subject of perfect being theology generally. By contrast,\nsometimes the expression \u2018perfect goodness\u2019 is used to\npick out a particular perfection, a particular way in which a\nthing can be great, and to refer to the upper limit of greatness of\nthat sort. Thus we see that perfect goodness is often included in\nlists of the perfections exhibited by an absolutely perfect being:\nthat being would not only be omniscient and omnipotent, but would also\nbe perfectly good. \n\nWhat is this perfect goodness, a particular perfection exhibited by\nany absolutely perfect being? In recent work in philosophical theology\n\u2013 understandably, primarily in contexts in which the problem of\nevil is at issue \u2013 perfect goodness is understood as a\npractical excellence, an excellence concerned with desire,\ncharacter traits, and action. A perfectly good being has the best\ndesires that a being can have, and exhibits the best traits of\ncharacter, and acts in an unsurpassably excellent way. This practical\nexcellence is, furthermore, typically understood as moral\nexcellence (Morris 1989b, p. 26; Wierenga 1989, p. 202). So when one\nsays that any being who counts as God must be perfectly good, the\nclaim is that any such being would have desires and traits of\ncharacter and perform actions that are those of a being that exhibits\nmoral perfection. The idea, then, is this. We may call all of\nthese practically-oriented features of a being \u2013 that\nbeing\u2019s desires, character traits, actions, etc. \u2013 its\n\u2018agency\u2019. A being\u2019s agency might be morally better\nor morally worse. A morally perfect being, though, has morally\nunsurpassable agency. \n\nThe perfect being theologian who appeals to moral perfection as part\nof the nature of the absolutely perfect being inherits all of the\nuncertainty in metaethics about the proper formal characterization and\ndemarcation of the moral and all of the uncertainty in normative\nethics about the proper criteria for assessing moral goodness. In this\narticle we will not attempt a comprehensive account of such disputes,\nbut will simply take for granted a few widely-made assumptions. First,\nwe will assume that there are truths of the matter about the extent to\nwhich a being\u2019s agency exhibits moral goodness. Second, while\nthe considerations that are relevant in assessing moral goodness are\ndisputable, and it is even disputable whether the criteria for moral\ngoodness are relative to the kind of being in question, it seems clear\nthat the sort of moral goodness that is typically ascribed to the\nperfect being is moral goodness of a familiar, welfare-oriented kind.\nIn particular, it is assumed that morally good beings treat the\nwelfare of humans and at least some other sentient beings as\npractically relevant considerations, so that, other things equal,\nmorally good beings favor the promotion of well-being and disfavor\nsetbacks to it. So it is taken for granted that perfect moral goodness\ncannot involve opposition or indifference to the flourishing of\nsentient beings; the claim that perfect moral goodness might be so\ndifferent for God than for humans that God\u2019s perfect moral\ngoodness might involve God\u2019s being indifferent to the suffering\nof creatures would be taken as a rejection of the claim that God must\nbe perfectly morally good, not a gloss on it. As Mill writes,\n\nIf in ascribing goodness to God I do not mean what I mean by goodness;\nif I do not mean the goodness of which I have some knowledge, but an\nincomprehensible attribute of an incomprehensible substance, which for\naught I know may be a totally different quality from that which I love\nand venerate \u2026 what do I mean in calling it goodness? \u2026\nTo say that God\u2019s goodness may be different in kind from\nman\u2019s goodness, what is it but saying, with a slight change of\nphraseology, that God may possibly be not good? (Mill 1865, pp.\n42\u201343)\n\n2. Perfect goodness as a necessary or contingent feature of the absolutely perfect being\n\nWhat is the modality with which perfect goodness is exhibited by an\nabsolutely perfect being? Is any absolutely perfect being\nnecessarily perfectly good, or is such a being only\ncontingently perfectly morally good? (The necessity in\nquestion here is de re; it is far less controversial that it\nis a de dicto necessary truth that an absolutely perfect\nbeing is perfectly good.) One might think that an absolutely perfect\nbeing must be essentially perfectly good, for a being who is perfectly\ngood in all possible worlds is better than a being who is perfectly\ngood in only some worlds. This is the standard thinking behind the\nidea that the divine perfections are exhibited by God not only\ncontingently, but necessarily: a perfect being is not only omniscient,\nbut necessarily omniscient; a perfect being is not only omnipotent,\nbut necessarily omnipotent; and so forth. As it is better to have a\nperfection necessarily rather than only contingently, if having some\nfeature is a perfection, then having that feature necessarily is a\nperfection as well. \n\nBut this argument is not decisive. It works only if having the\nperfection in question necessarily is itself a coherent notion, and it\nmay be that there is some sort of incoherence involved in the notion\nof necessary perfect goodness that is not involved in the notion of\nperfect goodness simpliciter. (For an endorsement of this\nline of argument, with a recognition of the needed qualification, see\nMorris 1989d, p. 63\u201365.) Some arguments to this conclusion are\nconsidered below. One might, then, argue that the best that a being\ncould possibly exhibit with respect to perfect goodness would be to\nactually, though only contingently, exhibit it. \n\nSome defenders of perfect being theology have suggested that it is\nantithetical to the very idea of perfect being theology that there be\nperfections that could be exemplified only contingently. It is true\nthat certain ambitions that some perfect being theologians have\nharbored \u2013 for example, to provide an a priori\nargument, in the style of Anselm\u2019s ontological argument, for the\nexistence of an absolutely perfect being \u2013 would have to be\nabandoned if any divine perfection is exhibited at most contingently\n(Guleserian 1985). (Even if there are some sound a priori\narguments for contingent truths, this sort of proof of God\u2019s\nexistence is not a case in which this is a live possibility.) An\nabsolutely perfect being might exist, and even exist necessarily, but\nit would not be essential to it that it is an absolutely perfect\nbeing. (That is, if A is an absolutely perfect being, then\nA might exist necessarily, but it would not be necessary both\nthat A exists and is absolutely perfect.)\n\nSome defenders of perfect being theology have ridiculed the idea that\nan absolutely perfect being might be only contingently perfectly good,\nfor even if a being were to exhibit all of the marks of perfect\ngoodness up to a certain time, we would have no basis to think that\nthe absolutely perfect being would not break bad at some point in the\nfuture (Rogers 2000, p. 122). But it is not clear why the contingency\nof the fact\u2019s (the being\u2019s being perfectly good)\nholding precludes our knowing that it holds; and it is very plausible\nthat perfect goodness is, for God at least, what Morris calls a\n\u201cstable\u201d property, such that if God has it at some time in\na world, then God has it at all times in that world (Morris 1989e, pp.\n92\u201397).\n\nIf we were to become convinced that necessary perfect goodness is\nincoherent, it is unclear why we should take that to be any more\nproblematic for the notion that God is perfectly good than our\nbecoming convinced that water is necessarily identical to\nH2O would be for the notion that God\u2019s perfection\nincludes omnipotence. Just as we do not take God\u2019s omnipotence\nto be threatened by God\u2019s not being able to make water that is\nnot H\u00ad2O, we need not take God\u2019s perfect goodness\nto be threatened by the fact that God cannot exhibit that feature\nnecessarily. If the upper limit of perfect goodness is to have it\ncontingently, then it is not as if a being who is actually morally\nperfect is surpassable in moral goodness merely by having its perfect\nmoral goodness only contingently. (Though see Carter 1982 and Garcia\n1987 for attempts to show that God cannot be contingently morally\nperfect; on these views, God is either essentially morally perfect or\nessentially morally defective.)\n3. Is perfect goodness, whether necessary or contingent, actually exemplified?\n\nWe are investigating perfect goodness in the context of its\nexemplification in an absolutely perfect being. Whether we should\nthink perfect goodness is actually exemplified in an absolutely\nperfect being will depend not only on whether we think that some being\nexemplifies perfect goodness but also on whether we think that being\nexemplifies the other perfections, say, omniscience and omnipotence.\n(One might think that perfect goodness presupposes omniscience and\nomnipotence \u2013 that perfect goodness requires complete knowledge,\nperfect freedom, and full effectiveness.) That task would require\nconsideration of the various arguments within philosophical theology\nfor the existence of an absolutely perfect being \u2013 the\nontological, cosmological, teleological,\nand moral arguments, among others \u2013 as well as various\narguments that no such arguments are required for such belief to be\nrational and perhaps even warranted. (See the entries on\n ontological arguments,\n the\n cosmological argument,\n moral arguments, and\n teleological arguments\n for God\u2019s existence.)\n\nIt is worth noting, though, that there is a crucial argument that\ntypically relies on perfect goodness (understood as perfect moral\ngoodness) as a perfection in order to argue that there is no\nabsolutely perfect being. This is the argument from evil, which holds\nthat because the world contains evil (or evil of some specific type,\nor of some amount, or distributed in some way), then this world is not\nunder the control of an absolutely perfect \u2013 at least,\nomniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect \u2013 being. There is a\nmassive classical and contemporary literature on the problem of evil;\nconsideration of formulations of the argument from evil and of\nattempts to reconcile the existence of evil and the existence of an\nabsolutely perfect being is beyond the scope of this article. (But see\nentry on\n the problem of evil.)\n\nThe argument from evil typically employs a lemma that an omniscient,\nomnipotent being is not justified in allowing the sorts of evil that\nwe find in the world. But one might make an even stronger claim, and\nhold that even if an omniscient, omnipotent being were fully justified\nin creating the world as it is, that being is nevertheless not morally\nperfect, just because that being\u2019s agency is marred by being the\nactive or permissive cause of that which is intrinsically disvaluable\n(Graves 2012). It is a controverted question whether one\u2019s\nagency can be judged to be in any way morally worse simply because it\nbrings about something bad, even something very bad. No one should\ndoubt that one can judge facts involving agency to be in some\nway bad if the agency brings about something bad; one might\nregret that the bad was brought about, or that the world was\nsuch that the bad\u2019s being brought about was the best of the\noptions available. What is doubtful is that this is any basis for\njudging the agency in question to be in any way morally bad.\n\n\nConsider an analogy. We look at the career of an executive and we see\nthat her career includes an occasion on which she laid off a dozen\nworkers, costing them their jobs with the company but offering them an\nextensive severance package. Does that fact all by itself\nshow that she was in any way less than a perfect executive? Does it\nmar her career? It is hard to see how; if she was brought on board to\ndeal with a company in severe trouble, and laying off that dozen\nworkers while offering them an extensive severance package really was\nthe best possible response that the executive could have made to a\nproblem not of her own making, it is hard to see how this event counts\nagainst her perfection as an executive. What marks one as a good\nexecutive is how one deals with the opportunities and challenges that\none has available to one; it is not affected by the range of\nopportunities and challenges themselves (except, of course, insofar as\nthat range is up to one\u2019s one making). \n\nSimilarly, what makes agency morally good, one might say, is its\nresponsiveness to what is valuable; it is in no way made worse simply\nbecause the options available each contain some regrettable features.\nBut the idea that God\u2019s agency is marred simply because the\nworld contains bad presupposes that God\u2019s agency is in some way\nmarred on account of features of the options of choice rather than on\naccount of God\u2019s orientation to what is valuable. (We will\nconsider issues related to this one in the next section in the context\nof the possibility that there is no intrinsic maximum of moral\ngoodness of agency.) \n4. Is perfect goodness possibly exemplified?\n\nThe argument from evil, noted in the previous section, appeals to\ncontingent facts about the world in order to call into question the\nexistence of a being of perfect goodness (who exhibits perfect\nknowledge and power as well). But one might call into question the\nexistence of such a being without appeal to supplementary premises\nabout contingent facts concerning the existence of evil. One might say\nthat perfect goodness is not even a real possibility.\n\nIs perfect goodness a possibility? One might think that it is obvious\nthat it is. After all, whatever standard of moral goodness that one\nputs forward as the ideal, it must be a standard that is possible for\nagents to meet, for \u2018ought\u2019 \u2013 at least, the moral\n\u2018ought\u2019 \u2013 implies \u2018can.\u2019 But one might\nclaim that the standard for moral goodness is not really like that.\nInstead of putting forward an ideal, the standard of moral goodness is\na comparative standard: with respect to cases of appropriate\ncomparison, the standard of moral goodness tells one how the two items\nbeing compared \u2013 whether desires, traits of character, actions\n\u2013 are ordered with respect to one another. So the standard of\nmoral goodness declares one set of desires morally better than\nanother, or declares them equally good; or declares one set of\ncharacter traits better than another, or declares them equally good;\nor declares one career of actions better than another, or declares\nthem equally good. (Put to the side the possibility that some such\nitems are simply incommensurable.) Understood in this comparative way,\nthe standard of moral goodness could still honor \u2018ought implies\ncan\u2019: perhaps if A\u2019s performing action X is\nmorally better than A\u2019s performing action Y, this\ncomparison presupposes that performing X is possible for\nA and performing Y is possible for A. But the key\npoint is that, understood in this comparative way, it is not at all\nobvious that perfect moral goodness is possible. For it may\nbe that the facts about what it is possible for A to do and the\ncomparative moral standard together entail that for every action that\nA might perform, there is a morally better action that it is\npossible for A to perform.\n\nThis possibility has been most intensively discussed with respect to\n\u2018no best world\u2019 scenarios. Say that God \u2018actualizes\na world\u2019 when some maximal state of affairs obtains as a result\nof God\u2019s choosing to create or choosing to refrain from\ncreating. (Whether God actualizes a world is thus not an open\nquestion; God actualizes some world, and the only questions are\nwhether it will include items other than God and if so, which ones.)\nSuppose that there are infinitely many possible worlds, each of which\nis within God\u2019s power to actualize. For each of these worlds,\nthere is another that is better from a moral perspective, i.e. for\neach world, one who takes the moral point of view will prefer some\nother world\u2019s being actual to its being actual. Since a possible\nworld is a maximal state of affairs, God cannot actualize more than\none of these. So whichever world God chooses to actualize, it will be\ntrue that God could have actualized a morally better one. One might\nthink that it is clear that an action of actualizing a world that is\nbetter from a moral point of view is morally better than an action of\nactualizing a world that is worse from a moral point of view. It\nfollows that in a \u2018no best world\u2019 scenario, there is no\nagency that God could exhibit that is unsurpassable. Since God is\nperfectly good only if God\u2019s agency is unsurpassable,\nnecessarily, God is not perfectly good.\n\nThe argument is as follows:\n\nNecessarily, God actualizes some world\nNecessarily, for each actualizable world w1,\nthere is an actualizable world w2 such that from the\nmoral point of view one would prefer w2 to\nw1\nNecessarily, for whatever world that God actualizes, there is a\nmorally better world that God does not actualize yet could have (from\n(2))\nNecessarily, for whatever world that God actualizes, God\u2019s\nact of actualizing that world is not as morally good as some other act\nthat God does not perform but could have (from (3))\nNecessarily, for whatever world that God actualizes, God\u2019s\nagency is not as morally good as it could have been (from (4))\nNecessarily, God\u2019s agency is not perfectly good (from (1),\n(5))\n\n\nSome have found the reasoning from no-best-world to\nno-perfect-goodness persuasive, while drawing different morals from\nthat entailment. Leibniz concludes that, because there is a God, there\nis a best world (\u201cEssays on the Justice of God,\u201d \u00a78);\nRowe and Wielenberg, by contrast, conclude that this entailment can\nserve as part of an argument against God\u2019s existence (Rowe 2004,\npp. 88\u2013150; Wielenberg 2004). Others have been unmoved.\n\nThe main sticking point in this argument is the move from (3) to (4).\n(For a denial of (2) based on the possibility and moral\nunsurpassability of an infinitely valuable world, see Climenhaga\n2018.) Detractors of this argument wonder whether it follows from the\nfact that any world actualized by God is morally surpassable that any\nact of actualizing a world is morally surpassable. It is easy to be\ntempted by the following line of thought. If we think of an action as\na state of affairs to be evaluated in terms of moral goodness in the\nsame way that any other state of affairs is to be evaluated, then\nthere is a pretty straightforward argument for the view that any act\nof actualizing a world will be surpassable. For if one prefers from a\nmoral point of view the obtaining of possible world\nw2 to the obtaining of possible world\nw1, then it seems very plausible that one would,\nfrom the moral point of view, prefer God\u2019s actualizing\nw2 to God\u2019s actualizing\nw1.\n\nThis line of thought requires the assumption that the standard of\nmoral goodness that applies to actions, in virtue of which a\nbeing\u2019s agency counts as morally good, is the same as the\nstandard that applies to states of affairs generally. But this is not\nobvious. One might think that while the standard of moral goodness\napplying to states of affairs is third-personal in character \u2013\none considers various items, and asks what one would prefer from a\nparticular perspective, the moral point of view \u2013 the standard\nof moral goodness applying to actions is first-personal in character,\nmore closely tied to the quality of the agent\u2019s deliberation in\ndeciding what to do. We can put things in a slightly different way. We\ncan consider an agent\u2019s action as simply an event in the world,\nand evaluate whether we prefer the agent\u2019s having performed it\nto the agent\u2019s having performed some other action. Or we can\nconsider an agent\u2019s action as the outcome of deliberation, as a\ndecision of what the agent is to do as a result of considering the\nvarious reasons in play. It may be that even though,\nconsidered as an event, God\u2019s actualizing a world is necessarily\nsurpassable, considered as an action, as a choice to carry out a plan,\nGod\u2019s actualizing that world is unsurpassable.\n\nIf we think that the evaluation of worlds is distinct from the\nevaluation of actions, then there is room to resist the move from (3)\nto (4), and this is indeed the standard point at which to resist. One\nmight object that this resistance is bound to come to nothing. A world\nis a maximal state of affairs; everything that is morally relevant,\nand thus can give God reason to choose to actualize one world over\nanother, is included in its value. So it of course follows that, from\nthe deliberative perspective, God must have more reason to realize a\nworld with more value, and given the no-best-world scenario, it will\nfollow that God never does what God has most reason to do, and thus\nGod\u2019s action is never supremely morally good. But again, there\nis plenty of room for resistance. It does not follow from the fact\nthat all of the value to be realized in God\u2019s acting is included\nin the world actualized that these are the only reasons that bear on\nGod\u2019s choice. For there may be, in addition to these first-order\nreasons, second-order reasons (Raz 1999, p. 39). A second-order reason\nis a reason to act for, or not to act for, a reason; and that there\nare such reasons makes a difference in assessing actions in terms of\ntheir moral worth. \n\nEngage in a bit of picture-thinking. Suppose we imagine God trying to\nchoose which world to actualize in a no-best-world scenario. We\nimagine God trying to do so on the basis of first-order reasons of the\nvalue of various worlds that might be actualized. But God of course\nwould know that this would be to no avail. God cannot treat the fact\nthat one world realizes more value than another world as a\ndifference-making consideration, for if it were, that would render God\nunable to make any choice. The fact that relying on some consideration\nwould undermine the possibility of reaching a decision is itself a\nconsideration relevant to deliberation; if one has good reason to\nreach a decision, and relying on some consideration precludes one from\nreaching a decision, that very fact constitutes a reason relevant to\none\u2019s deliberation. It is a second-order reason, a reason of a\nsort that Joseph Raz calls \u201cexclusionary\u201d: an exclusionary\nreason is a reason that directs one not to treat a first-order reason\nas relevant in one\u2019s deliberation (Raz 1999, p. 39). \n\nIf this account is right, then the reasons relevant to God\u2019s\ndecision about which world to actualize are not exhausted by the\nfirst-order reasons constituted by the value of the worlds actualized;\nthese reasons also include second-order reasons, reasons that direct\nGod not to make the choice by comparing worlds\u2019 first-order\nvalue. God\u2019s decision to actualize a world might then be morally\nunsurpassable, in that it correctly responds to the reasons relevant\nto the choice in precisely the way that those reasons call for, even\nif the world that is thereby created is surpassable (Howard-Snyder and\nHoward-Snyder 1994; Langtry 2008, pp. 74-78). God might make this\ndecision on the basis of some personal, non-morally-objectionable\nconsiderations rather than on the basis of considerations salient from\nthe moral point of view, or God might just pick, in Ullman-Margalit\nand Morgenbesser\u2019s sense (Ullman-Margalit and Morgenbesser\n1977).\n5. Is necessary perfect goodness possible?\n\nSuppose that it is allowed that there is no obstacle to the coherence\nof the notion that God is perfectly good. Whatever the morally\nrelevant reasons that bear on divine agency, that agency is perfectly\nresponsive to those reasons. As we saw above, it is standard within\nperfect being theology to conclude from the fact that exhibiting some\nfeature is a great-making feature that necessarily exhibiting that\nfeature is a great-making feature as well. As we also saw, an\nimpediment to this reasoning would be the incoherence of exhibiting\nthat feature necessarily. So we might ask whether there is any such\nimpediment to holding that God is necessarily perfectly morally\ngood.\n5.1 The applicability of moral norms\n\nOne potential obstacle, which received extensive discussion in\nresponse to some worries raised by William Alston (1990), is that\nthere might be thought to be a tension between the theses that God is\nnecessarily perfectly good (again, understood de re) and the\nthesis that the sort of goodness that God exhibits is moral goodness.\nFor it might be thought that to be morally good is to act in\naccordance with the true set of moral norms that applies to one, but\none might think that a set of moral norms can apply to one only if it\nis possible that one fail to perform an action that that set of norms\nrequires (Alston 1990, pp. 310\u2013315). Such an argument, if\nsuccessful, would show not only that an account of moral goodness that\ncharacterized it entirely in terms of compliance with some set of\nmoral norms could not be a correct standard in terms of which to\nunderstand God\u2019s perfect goodness; it would also show that an\naccount of moral goodness that took adherence to some set of moral\nnorms to be an irreducible part of moral goodness to be an\nimproper standard as well.\n\nThe idea that moral norms apply only to beings that can fail to act in\naccordance with them has a Kantian provenance, but the Kantian\nargument applies only to moral norms understood in a very specific\nway, as imperatives of a certain sort; Kant\u2019s view\nallows that moral norms can play a role in the lives of agents who are\nperfectly good, agents whom Kant calls \u201choly wills\u201d (Kant,\nGroundwork, 4: 414.) That holy wills invariably perform the\nactions that the moral norms call for does not show that these moral\nnorms do not apply to them. Far from it: that they apply\nexplains why the holy will acts in accordance with them, for\nif (per impossibile) those norms did not apply, the holy will\nmight well not act in accordance with them. There seems to be little\njustification for thinking that God\u2019s goodness could not be\nmoral goodness simply from the fact that God is necessarily perfectly\ngood. (See Stump 1992 and Leftow 1989 and 2013.)\n5.2 Divine freedom\n\nAnother frequently-raised objection to the prospect of necessary\nperfect goodness concerns the relationship between freedom and moral\ngoodness (see, for example, Pike 1969, p. 215; Reichenbach 1982, pp.\n133\u2013134). Not all beings are subject to moral assessment; we do\nnot judge rocks to be dutiful because they never violate a moral duty.\nIt is plausibly thought that one of the features that a being must\nexhibit in order to be subject to moral assessment is freedom. We\nfrequently take as an excuse for morally bad behavior that the agent\nwas not really free not to act badly; such excuses function by\nclaiming that the conditions under which the agent acted preclude the\nagent\u2019s behavior from being used as a basis for morally\nassessing the agent. Generalizing from thoughts such as these, it is\nplausible to hold that God is subject to moral assessment \u2013\nincluding the assessment \u2018perfectly good\u2019 \u2013 only if\nGod acts freely. And even apart from the connection between being free\nand being subject to moral assessment, it seems to be a great-making\nfeature of a being that its agency is free agency. (See the entry on\n divine freedom.)\n\nIt seems, then, that we must think that God is free. There seems to be\nno conflict between holding that God is free and that God is perfectly\ngood. A free being may have a perfectly good set of desires, slate of\ncharacter traits, and career of actions. It may even be true that\nevery counterfactual about what that agent would freely do were\ncircumstances somewhat different involves that agent\u2019s agency\nbeing perfectly good. But there may be a conflict between holding that\nthe agent is free with respect to issues of moral relevance \u2013\nwhat has been called being \u201csignificantly\u201d free (Plantinga\n1979, p. 166) \u2013 and being necessarily perfectly good.\nFor many hold the view that freedom of action involves a capacity to\nact otherwise \u2013 that if an agent is free with respect to\n\u03c6-ing, then it is possible that A \u03c6s and it is possible that A\nrefrains from \u03c6-ing. But if freedom involves the possibility of\nacting either way with respect to matters of moral relevance, then a\nfree being cannot be necessarily perfectly good. For there is no\npossible world in which a necessarily perfectly good being acts\nwrongly; but for every significantly free being there is a possible\nworld in which that being acts wrongly.\n\nThere are various ways to resist this argument. Many\ncompatibilists about free will deny that this sort of ability\nto do otherwise is a requirement on freedom; even if they insist on\nthere being some possibility of the agent\u2019s acting otherwise\ngiven some alternative possible set of desires, they do not hold that\nat the point of action, with all held constant, it must be possible\nfor the agent to act otherwise. (See the entry on\n compatibilism.)\n So given compatibilism, we cannot object that God is unfree simply\nbecause at the point of divine choice the only real possibility is\nthat God declines to choose to do wrong. Furthermore, God\u2019s\nwilling is not constrained by anything other than the constraints of\nlogical possibility, and there is nothing that can (efficiently) cause\nGod to choose one way rather than other; God is the ultimate source of\nGod\u2019s action, such that nothing is causally explanatorily prior\nto God\u2019s choice. If compatibilism is the true view about the\nrelationship between freedom and the capacity to act otherwise, then\nit seems that the fact that there is no possible world in which God\nacts in any but the best way does not call into question that\naction\u2019s being free and thus subject to moral assessment.\n\nIncompatibilists about free will \u2013 those who hold that\nfree will is incompatible with determinism \u2013 have not been of\none mind about whether the ability to act otherwise is a condition of\nfree will, and if so, in what sense, or whether there is some other\nrequirement on free action in the vicinity. (See the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism.)\n Those who hold to a strong version of the incompatibilist view might\nclaim that for an action to be free, then at the very point of\ndecision to perform the action, holding everything else constant, it\nmust be possible for the agent to choose to act one way or the other.\nSuch a view would indeed be incompatible with necessary moral goodness\non the assumption that only free action is creditable to the agent.\nBut other incompatibilists have held that even given a strong\nlibertarian account of free will, it is possible for there to be\nbeings whose orientation toward the good and vivid awareness of it is\nsuch that acting wrongly is not a real possibility for them. On such\nviews, it is possible for an agent to \u03c6 or not to \u03c6 only if\nthe agent judges there to be good reason to \u03c6 and good reason not\nto \u03c6 or there is some feature of that agent that is interfering\nwith that agent\u2019s orientation to act on what that agent judges\nthere to be good reason to do. So on Aquinas\u2019s view, while\nhumans in their natural state are capable of freely acting wrongly\nbecause they see some good in acting that way, in their glorified\nstate in heaven they are unable to sin, for they see no point in\nsinning and they are not such that their agency can be interfered with\nby external factors. It would be misleading to say that the glorified\nin heaven act rightly, but unwillingly; rather, they are hyper-willing\nto act rightly, and sinning is simply unthinkable, off the table, not\na serious deliberative possibility for them (Stump 1990; Kretzmann\n1991; see also Swinburne 1993, p. 202).\n\nThis condition of free perfect agency is realized to the greatest\nextent in God, it may be argued: nothing external to God can interfere\nwith God\u2019s willing, and God sees immediately and completely what\nis worth doing and why. On this view, God\u2019s choices against evil\nare free, even though doing wrong is not a serious deliberative\npossibility for God, and so there is no possible world in which God\nacts wrongly.\n\nIf one insists upon a libertarian account of free will in which to be\nfree with respect to an action requires the possibility of acting\notherwise, then the connection between freedom and moral assessability\nentails that God\u2019s lack of freedom to do evil precludes\nGod\u2019s being perfectly morally good. It is unclear how damaging\nthat outcome would be. If one is convinced that moral goodness is a\ngreat-making feature that God must exhibit, then there is a deep\nproblem for perfect being theology, as it seems that God must be free\nand God must be perfectly morally good, yet these cannot be\nco-realized. On the other hand, one might take this as occasion to\nreconsider whether divine perfection requires moral goodness: perhaps\nwhile moral goodness in the human case requires freedom, special\nfeatures of the divine case make that sort of freedom unnecessary\n(see, for example, Bergmann and Cover 2006); or perhaps the perfection\nof God\u2019s agency need not be moral perfection. (We will consider\nsome suggestions toward this latter possibility below.)\n5.3 Divine freedom and divine rationality\n\nSuppose that we allow that God cannot act wrongly, and that this does\nnot threaten divine freedom, given the best account of divine freedom.\nOne might nevertheless think that there is a difficulty concerning how\nto reconcile God\u2019s necessary moral goodness with God\u2019s\nbeing both perfectly free and perfectly rational. It seems that we\nmust ascribe to God perfect rationality: God is a rational agent, and\nit seems obvious that if we hold that God is in any way suboptimal,\nrationally speaking, then that would count as a defect in God.\n\nTo be perfectly rational is to have one\u2019s agency shaped by the\nreasons that bear on one\u2019s agency in the way that those reasons\ndictate. It is not assumed by this characterization of perfect\nrationality that reasons are the only thing that shape one\u2019s\nagency; the only requirement here is that one\u2019s agency does not\nflout what the relevant reasons require. \n\nDo God\u2019s perfect rationality and God\u2019s perfect moral\ngoodness cohere? Can one be perfectly rational and perfectly morally\ngood? If the requirements of rationality can require an action that is\nruled out by the requirements of morality, or vice versa, then we have\na problem: the absolutely perfect being cannot be both perfectly\nrational and perfectly morally good. So anyone who wishes to defend\nperfect moral goodness as a feature of the absolutely perfect being\nmust hold that what moral goodness requires is at least compatible\nwith the requirements of rationality. \n\nThe compatibility of the requirements of rationality with the\nrequirements of moral goodness is a relatively weak constraint, one\nthat could be satisfied by holding merely that what rationality\nrequires is thin compared to what morality requires: perhaps\nrationality leaves a lot of open space within which agents are not\nrationally constrained to choose one way or the other, and one of the\nways that they might choose is the way required by morality. But one\nmight argue that this weak constraint is not enough, given that God is\nmorally good necessarily. For what is to explain why God\nnecessarily acts in accordance with the requirements of moral\ngoodness, if God is perfectly free? Perhaps a perfectly free being\nwill conform to the reasons that are relevant in the situation of\nchoice; but is it compatible with perfect freedom to hold that God\nmust act in a certain way, even though there are (ex\nhypothesi) entirely adequate reasons to act some other,\nincompatible way?\n\nThe tension being discussed here could be resolved if we were to\naccept a certain sort of internalist thesis about moral norms, a\nthesis that Michael Smith calls \u201crationalism\u201d (Smith 1994,\np. 62), though it would need to be affirmed in a somewhat stronger\nform than that which Smith affirms. The rationalist thesis as Smith\ndescribes it holds no more than that the fact that an act is morally\nright for an agent to perform entails that the agent has a good reason\nfor performing it. The strengthened rationalist thesis holds that the\nfact that an action is the morally best action for an agent to perform\nentails that it is the action that the agent has most reason to\nperform. What is being supposed here is that rationality, vis-a-vis\nmorality, is very demanding: moral requirements just are rational\nrequirements, so that a failure to act morally is a failure to act\nrationally.\n\nThis strengthened rationalist thesis is of course a controversial\nmetaethical view: some would deny that there must be any reason at all\nfor an agent to do what morality requires, much less that there is\ndecisive reason to do so. But it is one route to the reconciliation of\ndivine rationality and freedom with perfect moral goodness.\n\nThose who incline toward a compatibilist account of divine freedom\nmight think that there is less of a problem here. Why must we try to\npreserve divine freedom by holding that God\u2019s adherence to the\nnorms of morality is a matter of God taking the route most supported\nby reasons? Why not just say that the structure of divine character\n\u2013 God\u2019s virtues \u2013 is that of a morally perfect\nbeing? Since divine action proceeds from the divine nature itself, one\nmight say, it counts as free; and since that nature is morally\nperfect, the action that proceeds from it will be perfectly good as\nwell. We do not need to advert to any controversial metaethical\nthesis, then, to explain how divine freedom and rationality fit with\nperfect moral goodness.\n\nWhile this is an open strategy, there are some worries that can be\nraised with respect to it. The first is that it is unclear whether\ndivine freedom is really being adequately respected. One might wonder\nhow it could be that God\u2019s agency counts as free if God is\nunable to take seriously in choice options that God nevertheless\nrecognizes that there are adequate reasons to perform. But that is an\nimplication of the view as described: because rationality does not\nrule out immoral options, yet the structure of God\u2019s desires\nprecludes God from taking those options, God is unable to take\nseriously options that there are entirely sufficient reasons to carry\nout. This has an appearance of a lack of freedom, not the perfection\nof it.\n\nThe second is about how we should think about the perfection of moral\ngoodness on this view. One of the key issues within the methodology of\nperfect being theology is how the presence of certain items on the\nlist of perfections is to be justified. There are some uncontroversial\nways of ruling items off the list \u2013 if the perfection\npresupposes an imperfection, for example \u2013 but whether some\nfeature that passes these negative tests counts as an intrinsically\ngood-making feature is a more difficult question. If moral goodness is\na requirement of rationality, it seems much easier to make a case that\nmoral goodness is a divine perfection. For it seems undeniable that\nrationality counts as a perfection for God, as it must for any agent.\nAnd so if moral goodness is itself a matter of responding\nappropriately to reasons, as it is on the strong rationalist thesis\ndescribed above, then moral goodness must count as a perfection as\nwell. But if moral goodness is not a requirement of reason, is it so\nclear that moral goodness is a divine perfection? What considerations\nmight one forward for the view that moral goodness is a perfection, if\nGod has adequate reasons not to act in the morally best way?\n\nIn order to square perfect moral goodness with perfect rationality and\nperfect freedom, one must either (a) affirm a strong account of the\nreason-giving character of moral norms or (b) explain both why\nGod\u2019s freedom is not compromised by not being able to make a\nchoice fully supported by reasons and why moral goodness counts as a\ndivine perfection (Murphy 2017).\n6. Is moral goodness a pure perfection?\n\nWe have seen that there are resources to defend the coherence of the\nnotion of perfect goodness and even necessary perfect goodness, though\nmaking use of those resources requires one to take on further\ncontroversial commitments. It is worth asking, in light of these\nfurther commitments that one would have to make, how strong the\nreasons are to ascribe perfect goodness, understood as perfect\nmoral goodness, to the absolutely perfect being in the first\nplace.\n\nIsn\u2019t it obvious that perfect moral goodness is to be ascribed\nto God? After all, we would think of a human being who fails to live\nup to the standards of moral goodness as being imperfect in some way;\nsurely, a fortiori, we ought to think of an omniscient and\nomnipotent being as imperfect if that being fails to be perfectly\nmorally good. But even if it is obviously true that an absolutely\nperfect being must be morally perfect, this is a bad argument for that\nthesis. For the fact that a perfect X must exhibit feature\nF does not show that F is among the perfections of an\nabsolutely perfect being. A perfect frog has webbed toes, but the\nabsolutely perfect being need not have any toes at all, much less\nwebbed ones.\n\nIt is now traditional within perfect being theology to distinguish,\nfollowing John Duns Scotus, between pure perfections and impure, or\nmixed, perfections (Ordinatio 1.3.1, found in\nPhilosophical Writings, p. 24). Pure perfections are those\nthat do not presuppose limitation of some sort, while impure\nperfections do so presuppose. Only pure perfections are features that\nit is simply better to have rather than not to have. Impure\nperfections presuppose some limiting factor that sets the perfection\nin question \u2013 for example, membership in some natural kind. So\nbeing a frog is a relevant sort of limitation, and sets a\nrange of features that count as perfections for instances of that\nkind. But it is not true of these impure perfections that it is simply\nbetter to have them than not to have them; it is not simply better to\nhave webbed toes, a tongue attached at the front of the mouth, and so\nforth, though a frog in good shape will have those features.\n\nSo a key question is whether perfect moral goodness is a pure or\nimpure perfection. Recall that the moral goodness with which we are\nconcerned is familiar welfare-oriented moral goodness, so that while\nit is consistent with moral goodness\u2019s being a pure perfection\nthat what counts as moral goodness may in some way vary from one being\nto another \u2013 the particular content of moral norms may differ\nbetween God and human beings \u2013 it must not vary too\nmuch: the content of moral goodness must involve a positive agential\norientation to human well-being as well as to that of other sentient\nbeings.\n\nThere is a good deal of confidence expressed, particularly in the\ndiscussion of the argument from evil, that moral goodness is a pure\nperfection, but it is not clear whether that confidence is\nwell-placed. \n\nAgainst the notion that it is obvious that moral goodness is a pure\nperfection, it is worth noting that many accounts by which moral norms\nare allegedly explained in a non-debunking way make reference to\nfeatures specific to human life, or at least the life of\nbeings similar to humans in important ways. Humeans, for example,\nappeal to the structure of human sentiments; Hobbesians, to rough\nequality and mutual vulnerability; Aristotelians, to the conditions\nfor the flourishing specific to our kind. None of these accounts is\ndesigned at all to explain why moral norms of the familiar\nwelfare-oriented sort would be applicable to the absolutely perfect\nbeing, and thus give some reason to think that moral goodness is a\npure perfection. This is not to deny that there are some views that\nwould make a better case for moral goodness as pure perfection. If the\nvalue to which agents morally respond is intrinsic value, good in\nitself and giving reasons for action to all agents capable of\nrecognizing and being motivated by it (see, for example, Davison 2012,\np. 12), then we could see why moral goodness would be a pure\nperfection. This would require the working out, defense, and\ncommitment to that particular conception of intrinsic value, one that\nsome theists would take to be in tension with theism itself.\n(Anselm\u2019s own view denies that anything could be good in itself\nother than God (Anselm, Monologion, I, 14); see also Murphy\n2011, pp. 61\u201368.) Kant\u2019s view was that moral norms would\nhave to apply to all rational beings (Groundwork 4: 408), but\nthis thesis is more announced than argued for. At any rate, the key\npoint is that actual theories of moral norms on the ground are not of\none voice about whether moral norms appropriately apply to even the\nabsolutely perfect being, and this gives support to the view that it\nis an open question whether moral goodness is a pure perfection\n(Murphy 2017, 2019a, 2019b).\n\nSome writers have argued that the idea that the goodness of\nGod\u2019s agency is not the moral goodness to which human agents\nought to aspire is a familiar one in the history of philosophy. Davies\nargues that it is a mistake to think that in Aquinas\u2019s view, God\nis \u201cwell-behaved\u201d according to the system of moral law\nthat binds humans (Davies 2011, p. 72); and McCord Adams makes similar\nclaims regarding Scotus\u2019s views (Adams 1987). So here the\ndisagreement is not simply by implication; arguably, there is explicit\nrejection in these major figures of the notion that moral goodness of\na familiar sort is a pure perfection.\n\nIf moral goodness is rejected as a pure perfection, it does not follow\nthat there is no sense in which perfect goodness is a specific\nperfection. After all, we might understand perfect goodness as the\nspecific perfection of divine agency without taking the relevant\nstandards to be the familiar welfare-oriented moral standards.\nGod\u2019s being perfectly good might involve God\u2019s responding\nperfectly to value in a way appropriate for an absolutely perfect\nbeing to do so. It was a common notion in the medieval period to hold\nthat God must love Godself but that God is not necessitated to act by\nthe prospect of the well-being of humans or other sentient creatures.\nThus God did not have to create at all, and needs no reason not to\npromote the well-being of creatures more than God in fact does. (This\nposition is defended in Murphy 2017, 2019a, and 2019b, and in a very\ndifferent way in Rubio 2017.) This position is compatible with the\nnotion that God might place Godself under certain norms contingently,\nby promises, for example. But it would reject the notion that God is\nby nature subject to the same system of norms to which we humans are\nsubject.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Marilyn McCord, 1987. \u201cDuns Scotus on the Goodness of\nGod,\u201d <em>Faith and Philosophy</em>, 4: 486\u2013505.", "Adams, Robert M., 1972. \u201cMust God Create the Best?,\u201d\n<em>Philosophical Review</em>, 81: 317\u2013332.", "Almeida, Michael, 2012. <em>God, Freedom, and Worlds</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Alston, William P., 1990. \u201cSome Suggestions for Divine\nCommand Theorists,\u201d in Beaty 1990: 303\u2013326.", "Anselm, 1996. <em>Monologion</em>, in <em>Monologion and\nProslogion</em>, ed. and trans.
