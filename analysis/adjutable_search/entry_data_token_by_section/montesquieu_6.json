    "main_text": "The Spirit of the Laws || Climate and Geography\n4.3 Climate and Geography\n\n\nMontequieu believes that climate and geography affect the temperaments\nand customs of a country's inhabitants. He is not a determinist, and\ndoes not believe that these influences are irresistible. Nonetheless,\nhe believes that the laws should take these effects into account,\naccommodating them when necessary, and counteracting their worst\neffects.\n\n According to Montesquieu, a cold climate constricts our bodies'\nfibers, and causes coarser juices to flow through them. Heat, by\ncontrast, expands our fibers, and produces more rarefied juices. These\nphysiological changes affect our characters. Those who live in cold\nclimates are vigorous and bold, phlegmatic, frank, and not given to\nsuspicion or cunning. They are relatively insensitive to pleasure and\npain; Montesquieu writes that \"you must flay a Muscovite alive to make\nhim feel\" (SL 14.2). Those who live in warm climates have stronger but\nless durable sensations. They are more fearful, more amorous, and more\nsusceptible both to the temptations of pleasure and to real or\nimagined pain; but they are less resolute, and less capable of\nsustained or decisive action. The manners of those who live in\ntemperate climates are \"inconstant\", since \"the climate has not a\nquality determinate enough to fix them\" (SL 14.2). These differences\nare not hereditary: if one moves from one sort of climate to another,\none's temperament will alter accordingly.\n\n A hot climate can make slavery comprehensible. Montesquieu writes\nthat \"the state of slavery is in its own nature bad\" (SL 15.1); he is\nparticularly contemptuous of religious and racist justifications for\nslavery. However, on his view, there are two types of country in which\nslavery, while not acceptable, is less bad than it might otherwise\nbe. In despotic countries, the situation of slaves is not that\ndifferent from the situation of the despot's other subjects; for this\nreason, slavery in a despotic country is \"more tolerable\" (SL 15.1) than\nin other countries. In unusually hot countries, it might be that \"the\nexcess of heat enervates the body, and renders men so slothful and\ndispirited that nothing but the fear of chastisement can oblige them\nto perform any laborious duty: slavery is there more reconcilable to\nreason\" (SL 15.7). However, Montesquieu writes that when work can be\ndone by freemen motivated by the hope of gain rather than by slaves\nmotivated by fear, the former will always work better; and that in\nsuch climates slavery is not only wrong but imprudent. He hopes that\n\"there is not that climate upon earth where the most laborious\nservices might not with proper encouragement be performed by freemen\"\n(SL 15.8); if there is no such climate, then slavery could never be\njustified on these grounds.\n\n The quality of a country's soil also affects the form of its\ngovernment. Monarchies are more common where the soil is fertile, and\nrepublics where it is barren. This is so for three reasons. First,\nthose who live in fruitful countries are more apt to be content with\ntheir situation, and to value in a government not the liberty it\nbestows but its ability to provide them with enough security that they\ncan get on with their farming. They are therefore more willing to\naccept a monarchy if it can provide such security. Often it can, since\nmonarchies can respond to threats more quickly than republics. Second,\nfertile countries are both more desirable than barren countries and\neasier to conquer: they \"are always of a level surface, where the\ninhabitants are unable to dispute against a stronger power; they are\nthen obliged to submit; and when they have once submitted, the spirit\nof liberty cannot return; the wealth of the country is a pledge of\ntheir fidelity\" (SL 18.2). Montesquieu believes that monarchies are\nmuch more likely than republics to wage wars of conquest, and\ntherefore that a conquering power is likely to be a monarchy. Third,\nthose who live where the soil is barren have to work hard in order to\nsurvive; this tends to make them \"industrious, sober, inured to\nhardship, courageous, and fit for war\" (SL 18.4). Those who inhabit\nfertile country, by contrast, favor \"ease, effeminacy, and a certain\nfondness for the preservation of life\" (SL 18.4). For this reason, the\ninhabitants of barren countries are better able to defend themselves\nfrom such attacks as might occur, and to defend their liberty against\nthose who would destroy it.\n\n These facts give barren countries advantages that compensate for the\ninfertility of their soil. Since they are less likely to be invaded,\nthey are less likely to be sacked and devastated; and they are more\nlikely to be worked well, since \"countries are not cultivated in\nproportion to their fertility, but to their liberty\" (SL 18.3). This\nis why \"the best provinces are most frequently depopulated, while the\nfrightful countries of the North continue always inhabited, from their\nbeing almost uninhabitable\" (SL 18.3).\n\n Montesquieu believes that the climate and geography of Asia explain\nwhy despotism flourishes there. Asia, he thinks, has two features that\ndistinguish it from Europe. First, Asia has virtually no temperate\nzone. While the mountains of Scandinavia shelter Europe from arctic\nwinds, Asia has no such buffer; for this reason its frigid northern\nzone extends much further south than in Europe, and there is a\nrelatively quick transition from it to the tropical south. For this\nreason \"the warlike, brave, and active people touch immediately upon\nthose who are indolent, effeminate and timorous; the one must,\ntherefore, conquer, and the other be conquered\" (SL 17.3). In Europe,\nby contrast, the climate changes gradually from cold to hot; therefore\n\"strong nations are opposed to the strong; and those who join each\nother have nearly the same courage\" (SL 17.3). Second, Asia has larger\nplains than Europe. Its mountain ranges lie further apart, and its\nrivers are not such formidable barriers to invasion. Since Europe is\nnaturally divided into smaller regions, it is more difficult for any\none power to conquer them all; this means that Europe will tend to\nhave more and smaller states. Asia, by contrast, tends to have much\nlarger empires, which predisposes it to despotism.\n",
