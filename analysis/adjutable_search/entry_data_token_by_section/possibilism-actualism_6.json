    "main_text": "Possibilism and Possible World Semantics || Possibilism, Necessitism, and Logical Truth\n3.3 Possibilism, Necessitism, and Logical Truth\n\nIn addition to the degree of clarity it brings to the issues, a\ncompelling reason for expressing the possibilism-actualism debate in\nformal terms is how starkly it illustrates the inextricable link\nbetween logic and metaphysics, in particular, the dramatic impact our\nmetaphysical choices have on quantified modal logic. Arguably the best\nknown illustration of this is seen in the validity of the inference\nfrom\n (2)\n to\n (4)\n in SQML and, more generally, in the validity of the Barcan\n Formula:[43]\n\nBF:\n\\(\\Diamond\\exists \\nu \\varphi \\to \\exists \\nu\n\\Diamond\\varphi\\)\n\n\nThat is, informally, if there could be something satisfying\nany given description \\(\\varphi,\\) then there is something\nthat could satisfy that description, a thing that is\npossibly \\(\\varphi.\\) The validity of BF in\nSQML rests on two facts:\n first,\n that in the model theory of SQML (as in all varieties of possible\nworld semantics), the possibility operator \\(\\Diamond\\) is literally\nan existential quantifier ranging over all possible worlds; and\n second,\n that, in evaluating an existentially quantified formula\n\\(\\exists\\nu\\varphi\\) at a possible world \\(w,\\) the initial\noccurrence of \\(\\exists\\nu\\) in the formula ranges unrestrictedly over\nall individuals. Hence, switching the order of adjacent occurrences of\n\\(\\Diamond\\) and \\(\\exists\\nu\\) in a formula will not alter its truth\nvalue; to say that some world and some object are thus and so is to\nsay no more and no less than that some object and some world are thus\nand\n so.[44]\n And this is what warrants, in particular, the inference from\n (2)\n to\n (4).\n Letting \u201c\\(\\sfB\\)\u201d represent the predicate \u201cis\nBergoglio\u2019s child\u201d, the logical form of\n (2)\n is \\(\\Diamond\\exists \\sfx\\, \\sfB\\sfx\\). Expressed semantically in\nSQML: some world and some individual are such that, in that world,\nthat individual is Bergoglio\u2019s child. But that is to say no more\nand no less than that some individual and some world are such that, in\nthat world, that individual is Bergoglio\u2019s child, \\(\\exists\n\\sfx\\,\\Diamond \\sfB\\sfx,\\) i.e.,\n (4).\n\nIn its validation of BF, then, SQML underwrites in\ngeneral, and as a matter of logic, the possibilist\u2019s thesis that\nde dicto modal truths like\n (2)\n asserting simply that there could be things that are thus\nand so are in fact grounded in de re modal truths\nabout the modal properties of individuals, i.e., the properties they\nhave at some or all possible\n worlds.[45]\n If, as in the case of\n (2),\n that appears to commit us to things like merely possible human\nbeings, things that, for actualists anyway, intuitively do not in any\nsense exist, things that in no sense are, so much the worse\nfor actualist intuitions; or so says the possibilist.\n\nBF is not the only controversial logical truth of\nSQML or even, perhaps, the most controversial one. Another is its\nconverse:\n\nCBF:\n\\(\\exists \\nu \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Diamond\\exists \\nu\n\\varphi\\)\n\n\nThat is, informally, if there is, in fact, something that\ncould satisfy a given description \\(\\varphi,\\) then it is\npossible that something satisfy that description. CBF\nis valid for exactly the same reason that BF is: the\norder of adjacent occurrences of \\(\\exists\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\) in a\nformula does not alter its logical content.\n\nTo see why CBF is controversial, especially for\ntypical actualists, note that most all of us believe that there are\ncontingent beings, things that reality might just as well have lacked\nas to have contained, things like you and me that simply might have\nfailed to be identical to anything:\n\nCB:\n\\(\\exists \\sfx\\, \\Diamond \\neg \\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx\\)\n\n\nHowever, CBF is incompatible with the existence of\ncontingent beings! For, as an instance of CBF we\nhave\n\nCBF*:\n\\(\\exists \\sfx\\, \\Diamond \\neg \\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx \\to\n\\Diamond \\exists \\sfx\\, \\neg\\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx\\)\n\n\nHence, by MP, we can infer\n\n\ud83d\ude31:\n\\(\\Diamond \\exists \\sfx\\, \\neg\\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx\\)\n\n\nwhich says that there could be something that is distinct from\neverything (including, in particular, itself) and that, of course, is\nlogically impossible. Hence, CB is logically false in\nSQML and so it is a logical truth of SQML that there are no contingent\nbeings, i.e., that, rather, everything is necessarily identical with\nsomething:\n\nN:\n\\(\\forall \\sfx\\, \\Box\\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx\\)\n\n\nIndeed, since logical truths in SQML are all necessary,\nN is itself a necessary truth:\n\n\\(\\Box\\)N:\n\\(\\Box\\forall \\sfx \\Box\\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx\\)\n\n\nSo SQML yields not only possibilism (given BF and\n (2)\n and its ilk) but necessitism, that is, the thesis that\neverything there is and, indeed, everything there ever could be, is a\nnecessary\n being;[46]\u2014you,\n me, the Eiffel Tower, Bergoglio\u2019s possible children, merely\npossible members of exotic species that never in fact evolved, merely\npossible suns that never formed, etc. Otherwise put: everything there\ncould possibly be already is and, moreover, could not have\nfailed to be.\n\nAlthough it is a logical truth of SQML, necessitism is not\nanalytically entailed by possibilism. There is, in particular, nothing\nin the idea of a mere possibile that demands its necessity,\nnothing that rules out worlds from which it might be altogether\nabsent, worlds (in addition to those in which it is either concrete or\nnon-concrete) in which nothing is identical to it. This might lead one\nto wonder whether SQML, by building necessitism into its logical\nfoundations, has (from a possibilist perspective) gotten the logical\ncart before the philosophical horse. On reflection, however, it is\nclear that necessitism is, not only a natural complement to\npossibilism, but an essential component of it. For, as we\u2019ve\nseen, the central justification for possibilism is that it provides\ntruthmakers for modal propositions like\n (2);\n it grounds them in the modal properties of individuals. If the\npurported truthmakers for those propositions could fail altogether to\nbe, if it could be that there are no such things, then, for\nall we know, it might just as well be that there are in fact\nno such things and, hence, that there are no truthmakers for\n (2)\n and its ilk after all; and with that, possibilism\u2019s central\nphilosophical justification collapses. Necessitism closes the door on\nthis prospect: both possibilia and actually existing things\nalike are necessary\n beings.[47]\n\nAt first sight, of course, necessitism is a shocking philosophical\ndoctrine. For, most compellingly, the urgent intuition of our own\ncontingency\u2014that at one time in the past we did not exist and\nthat at another in the not too distant future we will forever cease to\nbe\u2014is a central element of our lived human experience. But by\nnecessitism, not only have we always existed and will so continue\nforever into the future, we\u2014no less than God and the number\n17\u2014could not have failed to be. The possibilist, however, will\nrespond that the worry here has badly conflated existence in the sense\nof being, in the sense of mere identity with something, and\nexistence in the sense of actuality. More specifically, the\nworry has confused two corresponding notions of contingency, viz.,\ncontingency as the possibility of absolute non-being, i.e.,\n\nCont\u2203:\n\\(\\textsf{Contingent}_{\\boldsymbol{\\exists}}(\\sfx) \\eqdf\n\\Diamond\\neg\\exists \\sfy\\, \\sfy=\\sfx\\)\n\n\nand contingency as the possibility of non-actuality, i.e.,\n\nCont\\(_{\\sfA!}\\):\n\\(\\textsf{Contingent}_{\\sfA!}(\\sfx) \\eqdf \\Diamond\\neg\n\\sfA!\\sfx\\)\n\n\nAs per SQML, says the possibilist, contingency\u2203\nis a logical\nimpossibility. However, they continue, contingency\\(\\sfA!\\)\ncomports fully\nwith our lived experience and, in fact, is all that our experience\nwarrants: our sense of our own contingency is rooted in our possible,\nindeed imminent, non-actuality and, hence, in the fact that, in the\nnot-too-distant future, we shall forever cease to be actual.\nWe shall thus forever cease to be conscious, to be embodied, to love\nand be loved, etc.; nothing distinctive of our human existence will\nsurvive. That something identical to each of us\u2014a mere\npossibile, a featureless point in logical space\u2014remains\nat worlds and times where we are non-actual offers no existential\nsolace. (See Williamson 2013: Ch. 1, esp section 3, 6, and 8 for\nrelated reflections on necessitism.)\n\nThe actualist, of course, in denying possibilism, i.e., in denying\nthat there could be any contingently non-concrete objects, allows no\ndaylight between being, existence, and actuality: to be is to exist\nand to exist to be actual. Hence, for the actualist,\ncontingency\u2203, the possibility of non-being, is the\nonly concept of contingency on the table. As contingency in this sense\nis a logical impossibility according to SQML, the actualist clearly\nneeds an alternative quantified modal logic tuned to their\nmetaphysical sensibilities.\n\nSQML thus throws\n the twofold challenge\n that possibilism presents to actualism into stark relief. The notion\nof an intended SQML interpretation of an applied modal language, with\nits single domain of actual and merely possible individuals and its\nrecursive account of truth at a world, vividly traces the semantic\ndependence of complex propositions down to the individuals on which\ntheir truth values are grounded. And the corresponding deductive\nsystem SQML provides the possibilist with a clean, complete\nframework in which to represent their reasoning. In the remaining\nsections of this entry we will look at prominent actualist responses\nto the two-fold possibilist challenge. \n",
