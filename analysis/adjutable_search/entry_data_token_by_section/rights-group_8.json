    "main_text": "Group rights and individual rights: co-existence and complementarity?\n9. Group rights and human rights\n\nIn seeking to reconcile group rights and individual rights, should we\ntake a further step and deem some group rights to be human rights?\nSome international human rights documents already suggest that we\nshould. The preambles to the UN\u2019s Covenants on Civil and Political\nRights (1966) and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)\ncharacterise the rights each Covenant recognises as human rights. The\nfirst articles of both Covenants ascribe to all \u201cpeoples\u201d\nthe right of self-determination, the right freely to dispose of their\nnatural wealth and resources, and the right not to be deprived of\ntheir means of subsistence. These are manifestly group rights but for\nthe Covenants they would also seem to be human rights. The UN\ninstrument that recognises collective human rights most expressly and\nabundantly is its Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,\n2007. The rights the Declaration announces include, for example, the\nrights of indigenous peoples \u201cto maintain and strengthen their\ndistinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural\ninstitutions\u201d (art.5), their right that their cultures shall not\nbe destroyed (art.8), and their right not to be forcibly removed from\ntheir lands and territories (art.10).\n\nThe mere existence of these international instruments does not, of\ncourse, establish that the ascription of human rights to groups is\neither conceptually coherent or morally defensible and, for the most\npart, drafters of UN human rights documents have studiously avoided\nany suggestion that human rights might be other than individually\nheld. For many commentators, human rights are necessarily and only the\nrights of human individuals; groups may possess rights but they will\nnot be human rights (e.g. Donnelly 2013, 45\u201354; Graff 1994;\nGriffin 2008, 256\u201376; Jovanovi\u0107 2012, 166\u2013195; Miller\n2002; Nickel 2007, 163\u2013167; Nordenfelt 1987; Waldron 1993,\n339\u201369). Others insist that some goods that are fundamental to\nhuman well-being are collective in nature and an adequate theory of\nhuman rights would accommodate that reality and recognise group as\nwell as individual human rights (e.g. Beitz 2009, 181\u2013186;\nCasals 2006; Crawford 1988; Felice 1996; Freeman 1995; Holder 2006;\nJones 1999b, 2013; Kymlicka 2001, 69\u201390; Malik 1996; Mende 2018;\nThompson 2015).\n\nWhere we stand on this issue may turn on what we understand a human\nright to be. The orthodoxy among moral and political philosophers has\nbeen that human rights are moral rights which individuals possess in\nvirtue of their humanity. If we opt instead for a purely legal\nconception of human rights (e.g. Buchanan 2013; Macklem 2015), the\nquestion of whether group rights might be human rights may be settled\nby legal fiat: if law declares a group right to be a human right, a\nhuman right it will be. Similarly, if we adopt a\n\u201cpolitical\u201d conception of human rights, according to which\na right is \u201chuman\u201d not because it is grounded in our\nhumanity but in virtue of the role it plays, or should play, in\ninternational political practice (e.g. Beitz 2009; Rawls 1999; Raz\n2010), group rights will figure among human rights if they are\nreckoned suitable for that role. But, if we stick with the traditional\nmoral conception of human rights and take the adjective\n\u201chuman\u201d seriously (e.g. Griffin 2008; Tasioulas 2007;\nWellman 2011), the possibility of group human rights remains\ncontroversial. Human beings are individual beings so that, if human\nrights are rights we hold as human beings, they would seem to be of\nnecessity individual rights. Moreover, the misgivings many people\nentertain about the potential of group rights to rival and threaten\nindividual rights are likely to be all the greater if the rights we\nascribe to groups are human rights which might match and override the\nhuman rights of individuals.\n\nThe main count on the other side of the argument is that many goods\nthat matter to human beings are collective in nature and many that are\nalready well-established objects of individual human rights have\ncollective dimensions. Consider, for example, collective acts of\nworship or other shared expressions of religious faith, or provision\nfor a minority\u2019s language in public documentation and public signage.\nIf these collective goods are objects of human rights, those rights\nwould seem to be of necessity group rights. UN documents sometimes\nseek to avoid that conclusion by distinguishing between the possession\nand the exercise of human rights. Individuals may exercise some human\nrights \u201cin community with others\u201d rather than individually\nbut the rights they exercise together will still be rights\nthey possess individually. But that distinction can be\ndifficult to maintain (Jones 2018, 2020). If, for example, a\npopulation engages in an act of collective self-determination, that\nact is not intelligible as the simultaneous exercise of so many\nindividually-held rights of individual self-determination; the act is\na collective act with a collective outcome and the right to perform it\ncan only be a group right. Similarly, a right to perform an integrated\nact of worship as an integrated act makes sense only as a\ngroup right. Individuals may possess individual rights to participate\nin the collective act but the right to stage the act of worship\nas a collective act will be a group right. If, with the\nVienna Declaration (1993, Part II, para. 22), we deem the human right\nto freedom of religion to include the right of religious communities\nthat their sacred sites shall not be desecrated, that too would seem\ninescapably to be a group right.\n\nThe distinction between the corporate and collective conceptions of\ngroup rights is of first importance here. A group right corporately\nconceived is a right held by the group as a corporate entity\npossessing moral standing as that entity. It is a right borne by an\nentity other than a human being and is therefore not plausibly a human\nright. A group right collectively conceived is a right held by\nindividuals, but a right held by those individuals jointly rather than\nindividually. So understood, a group right is readily intelligible as\na human right. Of course, not all collective rights will be human\nrights, just as not all individual rights are human rights. But a\nright need not fall outside the domain of human rights just because\nthe individuals who hold it do so collectively rather than\nindividually.\n\nWhat then of fears that ascribing human rights to groups will be to\nthe detriment of individuals and their human rights? If we ascribe\nhuman rights to groups understood as corporate entities, those fears\nare easily understood since potentially we pit the rights of two\ndifferent entities, groups and individuals, against one another. But,\nif we ascribe human rights to groups understood as collectivities, we\ndo nothing of the kind since the individuals who hold human rights\ncollectively will be the same individuals as those who hold human\nrights individually. The task of the human rights theorist will then\nbe to structure the entire set of human rights so that, for all who\nhold them, they constitute a morally optimal and compossible set.\n",
