    "main_text": "Sexual Equality || The Case for Sexual Equality\n5.1 The Case for Sexual Equality\n\nMill rejects sexual inequality in both domestic and social contexts.\nHe discusses domestic equality primarily in Chapter II. There, he\nfocuses on the rights of wives and mothers, recognizing women\u2019s\nequal rights over their bodies or persons (SW 283\u201386),\nto own and control property (284\u201385, 297) to control various\naspects of domestic decision-making and household management\n(290\u201392), to custody and care of children (285), and to\nseparation and divorce (285\u201386). But Mill is not only concerned\nwith wives and mothers in domestic contexts. He also defends equal\nrights to education (315\u201316), to professional\nopportunities (299; cf. PPE IV.vii.3), to vote in political\nelections (301), and to run for political office (301). In addition to\nthese rights, Mill presumably also endorses equal rights to freedom of\nexpression, worship, and association. One assumes that he sees the\nmain threats to these rights as occurring in the domestic realm and\ncoming from husbands, fathers, and brothers.\n\nAt times, Mill defends sexual equality on explicitly consequentialist\ngrounds as a way of making fuller use of people\u2019s talents and\npromoting a culture of equal opportunity, accountability, and genuine\nmeritocracy (326\u201328). But Mill also defends sexual equality as a\nmatter of individual rights and justice.\n\n\nThus far, the benefits which it has appeared that the world would gain\nby ceasing to make sex a disqualification for privileges and a badge\nof subjection, are social rather than individual; consisting in an\nincrease of the general fund of thinking and acting power, and an\nimprovement in the general conditions of the association of men and\nwomen. But it would be a grievous understatement of the case to omit\nthe most direct benefit of all, the unspeakable gain in private\nhappiness to the liberated half of the species; the difference to them\nbetween a life of subjection to the will of others, and a life of\nrational freedom. After the primary necessities of food and raiment,\nfreedom is the first and strongest want to human nature. (336)\n\n\nIn elaborating this claim about women\u2019s higher-order interests\nin liberty, he says that personal independence is an \u201celement of\nhappiness\u201d (336\u201337). This echoes the arguments in On\nLiberty for claiming that basic liberties are necessary for\npersons to exercise the deliberative capacities that make them\nprogressive beings.\n\nIn defending women\u2019s rights, Mill also appeals to the\ndistinctively modern and progressive commitment to equal\nopportunity for welfare (272\u201373). At several points, he\nlikens the status of women inside and outside of marriage to slavery\n(284\u201386, 323). Mill is not much impressed by those who would\ndispute the analogy on the ground that women are treated much better\nthan slaves. Gilded cages are still cages that restrict freedom and\nopportunity. And often the cages are not gilded; Mill insists that\nhusbands can be and often are just as violent and abusive as masters\n(285\u201386, 288\u201389). Indeed, with the demise of slavery in\nAmerica, he views sexual inequality as the last vestige of slavery in\nthe West.\n\n\nThe law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all\nthe principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through\nwhich those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out. It\nis the sole case, now that negro slavery has been abolished, in which\na human being in the plenitude of every faculty is delivered up to the\ntender mercies of another human being, in the hope forsooth that this\nother will use the power solely for the good of the person subjected\nto it. Marriage is the only actual bondage known to our law. There\nremain no legal slaves, except the mistress of every house. (323)\n\n\nThe restrictions contained in Victorian marriage law that give\nhusbands complete control over the person and property of their wives\nand that do not allow for unilateral divorce or separation make\nmarriage a form of sexual or gendered slavery. Slavery is an\nimpermissible restriction of the liberty of another. Slavery would be\nimpermissible even if the wife consented to marriage (270). Mill might\nquestion whether the consent is meaningful given the social pressures\nto marry and to defer to their husbands, the limited options for those\nwho do not marry, and the adverse consequences to women of expressing\ndissent within marriage (270). But the quality of consent should be in\nany case irrelevant, because we know that Mill thinks that it is\nimpermissible to contract into slavery and that paternalistic laws\nthat prevent such contracts are not only permissible but obligatory\n(OL V 11). Presumably, this is just the sort of case that\nMill has in mind when he suggests that the prohibition of selling\noneself into slavery is a principled exception to the usual\nprohibition on paternalism that has \u201cwider application.\u201d\nThis norm of equal opportunity for welfare, which is violated by\nVictorian marriage law, is a demand of justice (SW 325) and\ngrounds a claim of right.\n",
