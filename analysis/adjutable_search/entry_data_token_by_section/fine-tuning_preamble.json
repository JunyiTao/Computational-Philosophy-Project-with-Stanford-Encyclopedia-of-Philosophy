    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cfine-tuning\u201d is used to characterize\nsensitive dependences of facts or properties on the values of certain\nparameters. Technological devices are paradigmatic examples of\nfine-tuning. Whether they function as intended depends sensitively on\nparameters that describe the shape, arrangement, and material\nproperties of their constituents, e.g., the constituents\u2019\nconductivity, elasticity and thermal expansion coefficient.\nTechnological devices are the products of actual\n\u201cfine-tuners\u201d\u2014engineers and manufacturers who\ndesigned and built them\u2014but for fine-tuning in the broad sense\nof this article to obtain, sensitivity with respect to the values of\ncertain parameters is sufficient.\n\nPhilosophical debates in which \u201cfine-tuning\u201d appears are\noften about the universe\u2019s fine-tuning for life:\naccording to many physicists, the fact that the universe is able to\nsupport life depends delicately on various of its fundamental\ncharacteristics, notably on the form of the laws of nature, on the\nvalues of some constants of nature, and on aspects of the\nuniverse\u2019s conditions in its very early stages. Various\nreactions to the universe\u2019s fine-tuning for life have been\nproposed: that it is a lucky coincidence which we have to accept as a\nprimitive given; that it will be avoided by future best theories of\nfundamental physics; that the universe was created by some divine\ndesigner who established life-friendly conditions; and that\nfine-tuning for life indicates the existence of multiple other\nuniverses with conditions very different from those in our own\nuniverse. Sections 1\u20134 of the present article review the case\nfor this fine-tuning for life, the reactions to it, and major\ncriticisms of these reactions. Section 5 turns from fine-tuning for\nlife to the criterion of naturalness\u2014a condition of no\nfine-tuning in a rather different sense which applies to theories in\nquantum field theory and plays a large role in contemporary particle\nphysics and cosmology.\n",
