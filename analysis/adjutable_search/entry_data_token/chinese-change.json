Every day, we take\nactions to smooth out inconsistencies and irregularities to make our\nlives look manageable and meaningful. Every day, we perform our duties\nto our families and our professional organizations to present an image\nof loyalty and responsibility. Yet, despite our best efforts, we know\nthat we must have missed a great deal of opportunities and overlooked\na lot of options because we, knowingly or unknowingly, tend to be\ndistracted by immediate interests, unexpected circumstances, and\nunanticipated events. The fact of the matter is that in the end, we do\nnot fully know the results of our decisions: Are they truly effective\nin solving problems or repairing estranged relationships? Or are they\nmerely hiding problems or delaying solutions? Or are they\ninadvertently causing further damages or sowing the seeds for bigger\nproblems to come?\n\nYet, despite worry, anxiety, and self-pity, we continue to move\nforward. Occasionally, if we think hard enough, we may even find\nblessings in disguise\u2014a missed opportunity leads us to a new\ndevelopment; a wrong turn directs us onto a fruitful path; a hurdle\npushes us to think more carefully about alternative solutions. In the\nend, we must admit that the world is far more complicated than we can\nimagine. To live, we must take a pragmatic and provisional attitude:\nwe do our best to make informed decisions, but we do not know how far\nwe can go and how much we can accomplish.\n\nThis quest to be at peace with the complicated world is central to the\nphilosophy of the Book of Changes (Yijing\n\u6613\u7d93, Zhouyi \u5468\u6613 or I\nChing, hereafter Changes). Despite its multiple authors\nand divergent layers, the Changes focuses on one question:\nGiven that we have no full knowledge of ourselves and our surroundings\ndue to the constant changes in the world, how do we conduct our life\nmeaningfully and responsibly? Seemingly alarming, this question is\nbased on an understanding of human condition that includes three\nparts: (1) our finitude due to the limits of our cognitive abilities;\n(2) our reliance on a system of signs to understand our surroundings\nand to guide our actions, and (3) our hubris to take full control of\nour lives, even to the point of planning every step in our daily\nschedule (Hon 2019).\n\nDirectly addressing these three aspects of human condition, the\nChanges aims to alleviate our self-inflicted anxiety and\nagony. It reminds us of our limited ability to know our surroundings.\nIt offers us a system of symbols to navigate the complicated world. It\nprovides us with a set of divination rituals to calm our minds.\nThrough these three measures, the Changes helps us develop an\nappreciation of ourselves\u2014not only knowing who we are, but also\nfinding out what we can and cannot do. In short, the Changes\nhelps us develop self-confidence so that we can face changes with\ndignity, humility, and resolve.\n\nAs a text, the Changes is unique in two ways. Firstly, it is\nmulti-layered. Traditional accounts claim that the first layer of the\ncore text were graphic symbols\u2014the 8 trigrams and 64 hexagrams\n(see the images of trigrams and hexagrams in\n Appendixes 1 and 2).\n Created by a mythical figure, Fu Xi \u4f0f\u7fb2, these symbols\nmimic the continuous unfolding of the universe and denote the fluidity\nand complexity of human existence. The second layer of the core text\nincluded hexagram and line statements (see the names of the 64\nhexagrams in\n Appendix 3).\n Allegedly composed by King Wen \u6587\u738b and the Duke of Zhou\n\u5468\u516c in the 11th century BCE, these written statements\ninvoked concrete historical events\u2014such as the downfall of the\nShang dynasty and the rise of the Zhou dynasty\u2014to elucidate the\nconstancy of change in human society. The third layer were seven\npieces of writings from 5th century to 2nd century BCE. Divided into\nten segments (hence, the name \u201cTen Wings\u201d,\n\u5341\u7ffc shiyi), these writings deduced philosophical\ninsights from the graphic symbols and the hexagram and line statements\n(see the list of the Ten Wings in\n Appendix 4).\n By 135 BCE, the core text and the Ten Wings were combined to form\nwhat we now call the Changes\u2014a composite text\nconsisting of symbols, divination reports, historical records,\nfolklores, and philosophical treatises (Nylan 2001: 202\u201352;\nRedmond & Hon 2014: 1\u2013157; R. Smith 2012: 1\u201347;\nShaughnessy 2022: 5\u201364).\n\nSecondly, because of its multiple layers, the nature of the\nChanges is hard to pin down. If one focuses on the 64\nhexagrams, the Changes resembles a manual of divination. Each\nhexagram is a record of fortune-telling, consisting of a hexagram name\ndescribing a specific situation (e.g., marriage, mobilizing an army,\nor cleaning a well) and six lines detailing the alternative moves in a\ngiven situation. But if one focuses on the Ten Wings, one finds\nlengthy discussions of process cosmology, the philosophy of symbolic\nforms, and moral-metaphysics. Since its canonization in 135 BCE, the\nChanges was often read by the Chinese educated elites as a\nphilosophical text. And it was this philosophical reading that made\nthe Changes a living text throughout imperial China that\nconstantly posed critical questions to its readers and commentators\n(R. Smith 2008: 57\u2013194; Redmond & Hon 2014:\n158\u2013180).\n\nFor readers today, a major challenge of reading the Changes\nis overcoming the dichotomy between philosophy and divination. To many\nof us, divination and philosophy are diametrically opposed. Whereas\ndivination is based on a belief in a god or deity who communicates\nmessages to believers through coveted symbols or trusted mediums,\nphilosophy is based on rational thinking, cool-headed analysis, and\nprecise articulation. To the authors of Changes, however,\ndivination is intrinsically philosophical because its goal is to\nprovide an opportunity for self-reflection. While performing the\nritualistic acts of divination, the inquirers find a quiet moment to\nreview their past, examine their present, and make plans for the next\nstep. For the inquirers, it is unimportant whether there is a deity or\na spirit during the process of reflection, apprehension, and\nanticipation; it is more important that they reach a decision after\ncarefully evaluating the available options, and make critical moves to\nimprove their lives.\n\nIn the following, we will examine the philosophy of the\nChanges from four perspectives: the human finitude in the\ncosmic great dance, the need for decision-making to come to terms with\nchanges, the use of symbols to understand the complexity of the world,\nand the importance of rituals to find a direction in everyday life.\nTogether, these four aspects underscore both our limitations as\nsensitive souls constantly perplexed and perturbed by changes, and our\nabilities as sensible beings to face changes with courage and dignity.\nMore importantly, these four aspects help us appreciate the richness\nof the voluminous commentaries written on the Changes in\nimperial China. Despite their differences in tone, style, and\nstructure, these commentaries revealed the hidden meanings of the\nChanges and developed three distinctive approaches to come to\nterms with changes: the cosmological approach, the rational humanistic\napproach change, and the divination approach.\n", "toc": [{"#TextBookChan": "1.

The Text of the Book of Changes\n1.1 Human Finitude\n\nUnderlying the philosophy of the Changes is the notion that\nthe cosmos is an organismic process without beginning or end. As a\nprocess, the cosmos resembles a great flow in which \u201call of the\nparts of the entire cosmos belong to one organic whole\u201d and all\nthe parts \u201cinteract as participants in one spontaneously\nself-generating process\u201d (Tu 1985: 35). As such, there are three\ncharacteristics of this great flow: continuity, wholeness, and\ndynamism. It is continuous because it never stops in renewing itself.\nIt is holistic because it includes everything in the universe and\npermeates in all aspects of life. It is dynamic because it is full of\nmotion and movement, generating energy and strength all the time (Tu\n1985: 38\u201339). In this cosmic flow, there is no distinction\nbetween the natural realm and the human realm, between an observing\nsubject and an observed object, and between the inner world and the\nouter world. Everything is part of a totality, a group dance that\nnever stops.\n\nBecause of its origin, the philosophy of the Changes was\nembedded in the practices of divination. In early China, divination\nwas intrinsically philosophical because they were undertaken by the\nupper classes to make critical decisions, such as starting a war,\nstopping a natural disaster, or choosing a spouse to continue the\nfamily line. Before divination, an inquirer must have a question in\nmind to seek guidance from a deity or the spirit of an ancestor. The\nresult of a divination would be transmitted to the inquirer in a code\n(as shown in the engravings in the oracle bones) and the inquirer must\ninterpret the code to formulate an action plan. In the whole process,\ninterpreting the code\u2014known as prognostication\u2014was the\nmost important step where the inquirer, aided by experts, made\ncritical decisions based on the message (Shaughnessy 2014: 1\u201336;\n2022: 68\u201384). Hence, divination was not a blind faith in a\nsupernatural power. Rather, it was an attempt to make an informed\ndecision based on a reflection of the past, an apprehension of the\npresent, and an anticipation of the future (Allan 1991; Gotshalk 1999;\nMarshall 2001; Raphals 2013, Redmond 2017; Shaughnessy 1992\n[1997]).\n\nMore importantly, underlying the practice of divination was the notion\nthat human beings must accept their limitations. First and foremost,\nhuman beings cannot fully understand the cosmos because it is an\norganismic process. As part of the great flow, human beings are bound\nby specific time and space. Like a drop of water in an ocean, we are\nconditioned by the totality of the ocean and its dynamism. We act,\nreact, push, and pull, but we never know the vastness and depth of the\nocean.\n\nParadoxically, acknowledging our finitude gives us courage and\nflexibility to actively involve into our lives. As a drop of water in\nan ocean, we can reinvent ourselves in every moment. Our\naction\u2014intentional or unintentional\u2014will cause a change in\nthe world; through the butterfly effect, our action will subsequently\ncome back to affect us in our lives. Consequently, every action we\ntake is both a result of a precedent situation and a cause of the\nfollowing situation. Bounded and yet free, we are part of the process\nof creative-creation where, as Alfred North Whitehead puts it,\n\u201cthe many become one and are increased by one\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978]: 342\u2013351).\n\nIn the Changes, this interdependence of subject and object,\ninner and outer, cause and effect, are presented graphically in the\nsymbols of yin \u9670 (the passive force), a broken line (\u2012\n\u2012), and yang \u967d (the active force), a straight line\n(\u2015). By mixing the straight and broken lines, trigrams\n(three-line grids) and hexagrams (six-line grids) are formed.\nAllegedly developed by Fu Xi, these trigrams and hexagrams can be seen\nas coded messages from a supernatural power. But these trigrams and\nhexagrams can also be understood as a system of signs that helps us\nunderstand the fluidity and complexity of the cosmic flow. In the\nXici \u7e4b\u8fad (The Attached Statements, one of the\nTen Wings), we find a description of how Fu Xi developed the eight\ntrigrams to represent the world:\n\n\nWhen in early antiquity Pao Hsi [Fu Xi] ruled the world, he looked\nupward and contemplated the images in the heavens; he looked downward\nand contemplated the patterns on earth. He contemplated the markings\nof birds and beasts and the adaptations to the regions. He proceeded\ndirectly from himself and indirectly from objects. Thus he invented\nthe eight trigrams in order to enter into connection with the virtues\nof the light of the gods and to regulate the conditions of all beings.\n(WB67: 328\u2013329)\n\n\nFor the authors of Xici, the eight trigrams (\u2630,\n\u2631, \u2632, \u2633, \u2634, \u2635, \u2636, \u2637) ) are\npotent symbols. They are \u201csignifiers\u201d that help us, the\nperceivers, develop a sense of what the \u201csignified\u201d may\nlook like. With different combinations of a straight line (\u2014)\nand a broken line (\u2012 \u2012), the trigrams symbolize the ebb\nand flow of the yin and the yang cosmic forces. Similarly, a hexagram\n(a six-lines grid) is also a symbol of the unfolding of the universe.\nFor example, a hexagram can be divided into two trigrams: the lower\ntrigram (lines 1\u20133) and the upper trigram (lines 4\u20136).\nWith one trigram below and one trigram above, a hexagram symbolizes\nthe interaction of two sets of yin-yang configuration, demonstrating\nthe multiple ways in which the yin and yang forces interact and\ntransform each other. One may also take the lower two lines of a\nhexagram as representing the earth (di \u5730), the middle\ntwo lines as representing humankind (ren \u4eba), and the\ntop two lines as representing heaven (tian \u5929). Then,\nwe have a trigram within a hexagram. Known as the \u201cthree\npotencies\u201d (san cai \u4e09\u624d), the relation of\nheaven, earth, and humankind highlights the co-dependence between the\nnatural realm (tian and di) and the human realm\n(ren).\n\nFor the authors of Xugua \u5e8f\u5366 (Explaining the\nSequence of Hexagrams, one of the Ten Wings), there are meanings in\nthe sequence of the 64 hexagrams. The sequence depicts a continuous\ndevelopment of human society. The process begins with satisfying basic\nhuman needs (such as food, shelter, and security) and founding a\npatrilineal family structure. Subsequently, the patrilineal family\nstructure is further expanded into a complex socio-political system\nbased on the distinctions between kings and officials and rulers and\nthe ruled. Yet, this seemingly triumphant march to perfect human\nsociety is repeatedly interrupted by hesitations and disruptions,\nobstacles and blunders, and reforms and rebellions. At the end, this\nquest for a better society becomes a never-ending process, like the\ngreat flow of the cosmos.\n\nTo the authors of Xugua, this never-ending process of\nbuilding a better society is symbolized by the last hexagram,\nWeiji \u672a\u6fdf (\u4dff Ferrying Incomplete, #64).\nIf ended with Jiji \u65e2\u6fdf (\u4dfe Ferrying\nComplete, #63), the Changes would have been perfect because\nJiji is the best hexagram in terms of yin-yang\ncorrespondence. Reading Jiji\n\n\n\u4dfe\n\n\nfrom the bottom to the top, the first yang line of Jiji\ncorresponds with the fourth yin line, the second yin line corresponds\nwith the fifth yang line, and the third yang line corresponds with the\ntop yin line. In addition, Jiji is perfect in the position of\nthe six lines: a yang line at the first position, a yin line at the\nsecond position, a yang line at the third position, a yin line at the\nfourth position, a yang line at the fifth position, and a yin line at\nthe top position. Ended with Jiji, the Changes would\nhave an optimistic tone. It would suggest that if not now, at least in\nthe distant future, all problems in this world are going to be\nresolved. Sooner or later, we will reach the paradise.\n\nEnded with Weiji, however, the Changes becomes\nominous and open-ended. On the surface, the configuration of\nWeiji\n\n\n\u4dff\n\n\nis undesirable. Looking at the hexagram line positions, Weiji\nmust be in a dreadful condition: its yang positions (first, third, and\nfifth) are occupied by yin lines, and its yin positions (second,\nfourth, and sixth) are occupied by yang lines. Being in the wrong\npositions, all six lines cannot fully utilize their potential. It is\nsomewhat like what we see during the Covid-19 pandemic where the\nsupply chains and production lines were disrupted, dislocated, and\ndisplaced due to travel bans and shutdowns. At the same time, although\nall positions of Weiji are in the wrong order, the lines\ncorrespond with one another in terms of their yin-yang nature: the yin\nlines at the first and third positions correspond respectively with\nthe yang lines at the fourth and sixth positions, and the yang line at\nthe second position corresponds with the yin line at the fifth\nposition. Because of the correspondence amongst the six lines,\nWeiji is full of vital potentials. Once these vital\npotentials are activated, Weiji will flourish. It is similar\nto the potentials of inter- and intra-regional collaborations in the\nworld system that have developed over the last four decades. The\ntemporary disruptions and shutdowns during the pandemic did not cause\ndamages the structure of the system. The system bounces back quickly\nafter the travel bans and shutdowns are lifted.\n1.2 Decision Making\n\nTogether, Jiji and Weiji show that human agency is\nthe key driving force that would transform a dreadful situation (e.g.,\nWeiji) into a more positive, enterprising situation (e.g.,\nJiji). For the authors of Xici, this is where\ndecision matters. In a favorable situation, if someone can make good\ndecisions as to what to do, how to do, and when to do, it will yield\n\u201cgood fortune\u201d as opposite to courting\n\u201cmisfortune.\u201d Even in an undesirable situation, if people\nare smart, they can find ways to make a horrendous situation into a\nmild \u201cremorse\u201d or even a less less-harmful\n\u201chumiliation.\u201d\n\nIn the hexagram and line statements, the importance of decision making\nis spelled out clearly. For instance, in the\nprognostications\u2014inquirers\u2019 interpretations of the\nmessages received in divination\u2014we find both positive utterances\nsuch as \u201causpicious\u201d (ji \u5409) and\n\u201cwithout blame\u201d (wujiu \u65e0\u548e) and\nstern warnings such as \u201ccalamity\u201d (xiong\n\u51f6), \u201cblame\u201d (jiu\u548e),\n\u201cregret\u201d (hui \u6094) and \u201cremorse\u201d\n(lin \u541d). These contrasting prognostications highlight\nthe reality of human existence that when the wind of luck is on our\nside, we will do well, but when we are out of luck, we will be doomed\nto failure.\n\nTake, for instance, Qian \u4e7e (\u4dc0 The Creative,\n#1). The line statements depict the six yang lines as a dragon in\nvarious positions (for a translation of Qian, see WB67:\n3\u201310). Reading from the bottom to the top, the first line of\nQian is a \u201chidden dragon\u201d, the second line an\n\u201cemerging dragon\u201d, the third line \u201ca gentleman\n(perhaps a stand in of a dragon) in deep thought all day long\u201d,\nthe fourth line a \u201cwavering dragon\u201d, the fifth line a\n\u201cflying dragon\u201d, and the top line an \u201carrogant\ndragon\u201d (see\n Appendix 5).\n In addition, each line statements of Qian suggest a proper\ncourse of action in respective to the position of the dragon. Thus,\nthe \u201chidden dragon\u201d should avoid taking aggressive action,\nthe \u201cemerging dragon\u201d and the \u201cflying dragon\u201d\nmost look for assistance from \u201ca great man\u201d, the\n\u201cwavering dragon\u201d should take flight over the depths\ndespite the danger and apparent risks, and the \u201carrogant\ndragon\u201d will regret being stubborn and excessively\nconfident.\n\nBut, as a hexagram, Qian is ambiguous. On the one hand, in\nfive of its six lines, the tone seems to be upbeat, projecting an\nimpression of an incessant progress from a hidden dragon to an\nemerging dragon, a wavering dragon and finally a flying dragon. On the\nother hand, the progression is abruptly interrupted by the swift\ndownfall of an arrogant dragon. Like a Greek tragedy, the rapid fall\nof the arrogant dragon suggests hubris, highlighting the danger of\nexcessive human pride in making strenuous efforts to pull oneself\nup.\n\nTo highlight the danger of hubris, the authors of Tuan zhuan\n\u5f56\u50b3 (Commentary on the Decision, one of the Ten Wings),\nemphasize the importance of creatively and continuously assuming the\npositions of the six dragons in response to the challenges in daily\nlife (for a translation of the Tuan zhuan statement, see\nWB67: 370\u201372). By taking up all six positions of the six\ndragons, the authors of Tuan Zhuan mean two things. First,\nthey view Qian not as a structure of six discrete steps\nstarting from the first line and ending with the top line. Rather they\nsee Qian as a continuum, a cycle of events that keeps\nrepeating itself. Even if one strictly follows the incremental\nprogress from a hidden dragon (the first line) to an emerging dragon\n(the second line) to a flying dragon (the fifth line), upon reaching\nthe top (an arrogant dragon), one must go back down to a hidden dragon\nand to start all over again. Second, the authors of Tuan\nzhuan suggest readers when facing a challenge in their lives,\nthey should choose a dragon most suitable to the circumstances, such\nas to assume the position of a hidden dragon when starting a new\nbusiness or beginning a new career, to act like an emerging dragon\nafter receiving recognition from peers or bosses, to be like a\nwavering dragon when making crucial transition in career or location,\nto be like a flying dragon when everything seems to be flourishing,\nand last but not least, to avoid becoming an arrogant dragon when\neverything looks perfect but a decline is imminent.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors of Xici also highlight the\nimportance of decision-making by putting strong emphasis on human\nprecariousness. To draw attention to making wise decisions, the\nauthors of Xici focus on \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d\n(youhuan \u6182\u60a3) as a main theme of the\nChanges. For instance, they link the rise of the popularity\nof the Changes to the political crisis during the Shang-Zhou\ntransition (Xici II: 7; WB67: 345). To them, the popularity\nof hexagram divination was a consequence of the \u201cfear and\nanxiety\u201d arisen from the transferal of the \u201cmandate of\nheaven\u201d (tianming \u5929\u547d) from the Shang\nrulers to the Zhou rulers. Particularly, they view the epic battle\nbetween the last ruler of Shang (King Zhou \u7d02\u738b) and the\nfirst ruler of Zhou (King Wen \u6587\u738b) as the turning point\nin this drastic shift in political fortune, where the evil king was\nbrought low by the superior power of a virtuous ruler. In this epic of\nShang-Zhou translation, the authors of Xici find an\naffirmation of the Mandate of Heaven\u2014an invisible force of the\nuniverse in choosing wise rulers, and also a stern warning in the\nconcrete facts that a once powerful King Zhou was brought low due to\nthe circumstances. Particularly in the downfall of the evil King Zhou,\nthe authors of Xici remind readers of the disastrous\nconsequences of bad decisions and reckless moves.\n\nFor the authors of Xici, whether provoking fear or instilling\nanxiety, the effect of hexagram divination is the same. It forces\nreaders to reflect on their arrogance, complacency, and\nself-indulgence. It shocks them to look for ways to come to terms with\ncontingency and uncertainty. Above all, it directs attention to the\ndark side of human beings such as complacency, jealousy, greediness,\nand wickedness.\n1.3 Symbols\n\nDespite warning of hubris and human wickedness, the\nXici\u2019s authors also assure readers that if they learn\nto read hexagrams properly, they will discern the pattern behind\nincessant changes. They write:\n\n\nThe Changes is a book from which one may not hold aloof. Its\ndao [i.e., pattern] is forever changing\u2014alternating,\nmovement without rest, flowing through the six empty places [of a\nhexagram]; rising and sinking without fixed law, firm and yielding\ntransform each other. They cannot be confined within a rule; it is\nonly change that is at work here. They move inward and outward\naccording to fixed rhythms. Without and within, they teach caution.\nThey also show care and sorrow and their causes. Though you have no\nteacher, approach them as you would your parents. (Xici II:\n7; WB67: 348\u201349, with modifications)\n\n\nSeen in this light, the 64 hexagrams are no longer oracles. They\nbecome symbols of the constant movements in the universe and the\nceaseless changes in one\u2019s life. More significantly, they point\nto the intricate networks of factors or forces\u2014from near to far\naway, from simple to complicated, from visible to invisible\u2014that\nshape the movements and changes around us.\n\nYet, while scholars of Changes generally agree that trigrams\nand hexagrams are symbols of the cosmic group dance, there is no\nconsensus as to how they understand symbolic and verbal\nrepresentation. Do they view visual and verbal symbols as realistic\nrepresentation of the dynamic unfolding of the universe? Or do they\nview visual and verbal symbols as selective depictions of the outside\nworld?\n\nThe former is a version of the \u201ccopy theory of\nrepresentation\u201d where symbols are tools, accurately and\nrealistically copying the outside world for our perusal. It assumes\nthat there is an objective world out there, and we develop tools to\ncopy it. And the effectiveness of the tools is determined by how\nrealistically they are in capturing the objective reality. The latter\nsmacks of Ernst Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of symbolic forms where\nsymbols are schemas, conceptually and homologically classifying the\noutside world to support our images of the world. It assumes that the\nuniverse is far more complex and complicated than humans can\napprehend, and therefore, the best humans can do is developing tools\nto give them a sense of the universe. Thus, the tools created are\npartly subjective and partly objective. They are subjective in the\nsense that they are man-made and limited by human cognitive and\nemotive capabilities. They are objective in the sense that they\nprovide an image of the world, allowing humans to function in daily\nlife.\n\nIn the Xici, we find passages that support the copy theory of\nrepresentation. The clearest example is the story of Bao Xi (Pao Hsi\n\u5305\u72a7, another name for Fu Xi \u4f0f\u7fb2) in Part 2,\n2:1. In that passage, Bao Xi reportedly created a system of signs\nafter observing the meteorological patterns in the sky and the\ngeographical patterns on the ground. This story goes like this:\n\n\nWhen in early antiquity Bao Xi ruled the world, he looked upward and\ncontemplated the images in heavens; he looked downward and\ncontemplated the patterns on earth. He contemplated the markings of\nbirds and beasts and the adaptations to the regions. He proceeded\ndirectly from himself and indirectly from objects. Thus he invented\nthe eight trigrams in order to enter into connection with the virtues\nof the light of the gods and to regulate the conditions of all beings.\nHe made knotted cords and used them for nets and baskets in hunting\nand fishing. He probably took this from the hexagram of THE CLINGING\n(\u201cLi\u201d). (Xici II: 2; WB67: 328\u2013329 with\nmodifications)\n\n\nTo some scholars, this story not only explains the creation of\ntrigrams and hexagrams but also proves that the graphic symbols are\nrealistic representation of the world. They point out that the two key\nterms in the Bao Xi story\u2014contemplation (guan \u89c0)\nand proceeding [from what is close to us to what is far beyond]\n(qu \u53d6)\u2014denote an active quest for empirical\nknowledge through careful observation and rational deduction that\nleads to a factual understanding of the workings of the universe.\n\nFurthermore, the Bao Xi story continues after his death. We are told\nthat another mythical figure, the Divine Husbandman (shennong\n\u795e\u8fb2) drew inspiration from the hexagram Yi\n\u76ca (Increase #42) and used his knowledge to teach people\nfarming. He also drew lessons from the hexagram Shihe\n\u566c\u55d1 (Biting Through, #21) to teach people how to exchange\ngoods to improve their lives. After the Divine Husbandman, Yellow\nEmperor, Shao and Shun continued to draw inspirations from a long list\nof hexagrams. They used their knowledge to teach people to improve\ntheir living conditions, including farming, government, and housing.\nThe experiences of all these mythical figures show that the trigrams\nand hexagrams are realistic representations of the empirical world.\nLike a Google Map or a satellite image in our times, the trigrams and\nhexagrams help the mythical figures navigate the complex reality and\nachieve what they want in everyday life.\n\nHowever, this \u201ccopy theory of representation\u201d only appears\nin a small number of passages in the Xici. Most of the other\npassages remind us of Ernst Cassirer\u2019s subjective use of\nsymbols. Take, for instance, Xici I: 2 in which we find a\ndifferent perspective of the creation of symbols.\n\n\nThe holy sages instituted the hexagrams, so that phenomena might be\nperceived therein. They appended the judgments, in order to indicate\ngood fortune and misfortune. As the firm and the yielding lines\ndisplace one another, change and transformation arise. Therefore good\nfortune and misfortune are the images of gain and loss; remorse and\nhumiliation are the images of sorrow and forethought. (Xici\nPart I: 2; WB67: 287\u2013288)\n\n\nHere, the creation of trigrams and hexagrams is described as a\ndeliberate act of representing the world. We are told that the holy\nsages \u201cinstituted\u201d (she \u8a2d) the hexagrams\nand \u201cappended\u201d (xi \u7e4b) the Xici.\nIn both cases, the creation of knowledge is understood as a calculated\nact to convey a particular view of the empirical world. More\nimportantly, in the last line of the quoted paragraph, the authors of\nXici clearly explain the goal of this production of\nknowledge. They see the system of signs as a tool to help readers\nmaximize fortune, minimize misfortune, assuage remorse, and avoid\nhumiliation. In other words, the system of signs is intended to assist\nreaders to make decisions to improve their lives, rather than to mimic\nrealities of the world.\n\nIn another passage, this deliberate act of representation is even more\nexplicit. In Xici I:12, we find a soliloquy of the Master\n(presumably Confucius) who questions the efficacy of words and images\nin conveying reality:\n\n\nThe Master said: Writing cannot express words completely. Words cannot\nexpress thoughts completely. Are we then unable to see the thoughts of\nthe holy sages?\n\nThe Master said: The holy sages set up the images in order to express\ntheir thoughts completely; they devised the hexagrams in order to\nexpress the true and the false completely. Then they appended\njudgements and so could express their words completely. (Xici\nI:12; WB67: 322)\n\n\nThrough the Master, the authors of Xici assert that the\ntrigrams and hexagrams express the thoughts of their creators and not\nreflect the reality of the outside world. Similarly, the hexagram\nstatements (or Judgments) are not summaries of empirical facts but\nsuggestions of taking appropriate actions to solve pressing problems\nin life.\n\nTo followers of Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of symbolic forms, the\nargument in Xici is music to their ears. In his influential\narticle, \u201cGeist and Life\u201d, Cassirer describes human\nexistence as a constant battle between the vicissitudes of life (Life)\nand the symbols that are deployed to make sense of our surroundings\n(Form). While the former is \u201cobjective\u201d, involving\nempirical data and concrete facts in the tangible world, the latter is\n\u201csubjective\u201d, based on artificial schemas that presents a\npicture of external reality to the perceivers. For Cassirer, it is\nthis tension between what is external and internal, factual and\nrepresentational, objective and subjective, and realistic and\nidealistic, that characterizes creativity in human existence. In this\ncontinuum between Life and Form, and necessity and freedom, Cassirer\nurges us to develop our \u201cWill to Formation\u201d to align our\nunderstanding of the world with our system of symbols (Ernest Cassirer\n1930 [1996:15\u201318]). To him, developing the \u201cWill to\nFormation\u201d is more important than developing the \u201cWill to\nPower\u201d, as Nietzsche suggests, because it helps us come to terms\nwith the plurality, ambiguity, and conflicts in our lives (Cassirer\n1930 [1996: 29\u201333]).\n\nWhile in principle the authors of Xici may accept\nCassirer\u2019s active theory of representation, they are totally\ncommitted to trigrams and hexagrams as their preferred system of\nsigns. Having invested so much in pairing trigrams and hexagrams with\nthe cosmic great dance, these authors have no intention to include\nother systems of symbols to depict the universe, such as the visual\narts, literature, or poetry, as Cassirer recommends (Cassirer 1930\n[1996: 34\u2013111]). Herein, perhaps, lies their blind spot. Their\nunwavering commitment to trigrams and hexagrams leads them to a blind\nalley where they fail to see the value of other systems of signs (such\nas the number system that appears in Xici I:8).\n1.4 Rituals\n\nIf one just reads the Shuogua and the Xugua,\ndivination does not seem to have a role in decision making. However,\nin the Xici, divination plays an important role in helping\ninquirers to make critical decisions. In fact, an extended passage is\ndevoted to discussing how to perform divination with 50 yarrow stalks\n(Xici I: 8, more about it later). In addition, the\nXici authors identify divination as one of four ways to use\nthe hexagrams: (1) to use the hexagram statements and line statements\nas warnings against danger and downfall; (2) to use the\nChanges in trigrams and hexagrams to understand the ceaseless\nchanges in the natural realm and the human realm; (3) to use hexagram\nimages to enhance rulers\u2019 authority; (4) to use divination to\nprovoke inquirers to think more deeply about their choices\n(Xici I: 9; WB67: 314). Based on these four-fold uses of\nhexagrams, the Xici authors highlight the broad appeal of the\nChanges. It can be a book of \u201cwisdom\u201d\n(zhi \u667a) for those who are interested in pondering the\ncauses and patterns of change; it can be a book of\n\u201ckindness\u201d (ren \u4ec1) for those who are\ninterested in improving the political order; it can be a book of\n\u201clife\u201d (riyong \u65e5\u7528) for those who\njust want to live, overcome obstacles, and make fewer mistakes\n(Xici I: 4; WB67: 298).\n\nRecently, Chung-ying Cheng has suggested that we must stop explaining\n\u201cthe source, the formation, and the system of underlying\nphilosophy\u201d in interpreting the Xici. Rather, we should\nlook at its philosophy as a sustained discussion about time, location,\nand judgment that are derived from the divinatory practices (Cheng\n2020: xi\u2013xvi). In other words, instead of seeing divination and\nphilosophy as categorically exclusive, we see them as a continuum. It\nis from divination that we develop an acute sensitivity to the\ncombined effects of temporal and spatial factors that determine our\njudgment. And it is this acute sensitivity to time and space that\ngives us the mental resources to develop a strategy to solve problems,\na courage to face challenges, and a determination to overcome fear in\ncrises.\n\nFrom this perspective, the discussion of divination in Xici\nI:8 is revealing. The passage goes as follows:\n\n\nThe number of the total is fifty. Of these forty-nine are uses. They\nare divided into two portions, to represent the two primal forces.\nHereupon one is set apart, to represent the three powers. They are\ncounted through by fours, to represent the four seasons. The remainder\nis put aside, to represent the intercalary month. There are two\nintercalary months in five years, therefore the putting aside is\nrepeated, and this gives us the whole. (WB67: 310\u2013311)\n\n\nSet in terse language, the rituals include several steps, as Richard\nWilhelm summarizes.\n\n\nOne takes fifty yarrow stalks, of which only forty-nine are used.\nThese forty-nine are first divided into two heaps [at random], then a\nstalk from the right-hand heap is inserted between the ring finger and\nthe little finger of the left hand. The left heap is counted through\nby fours, and the remainder (four or less) is inserted between the\nring finger and the middle finger. This constitutes one change. Now\none is holding in one\u2019s hand either five or nine stalks in all.\nThe two remaining heaps are put together, and the same process is\nrepeated twice. These second and third times, one obtains either four\nor eight stalks. The five stalks of the first counting and the four of\neach of the succeeding countings are regarded as a unit having the\nnumber value three; the nine stalks of the first counting and the\neight of the succeeding countings have the numerical value two. When\nthree successive changes produce the sum 3+3+3=9, this makes the old\nyang, i.e., a firm line that moves. The sum 2+2+2=6 makes the old yin,\na yielding line that moves. Seven is the young yang, and eight the\nyoung yin; they are not taken into account as individual line. (WB67:\n311)\n\n\nThe goal of these elaborate and repeated rituals is finding hexagrams\nby counting yarrow stalks. In every step of the process, the inquirer\nis reminded that his or her action is part of the continual unfolding\nof the universe. In the end, the inquirer finds a hexagram from which\nhe or she can draw lessons. Hence, the purpose of the entire process\nis stilling the mind, making one more reflexive, and preparing one to\nmake critical decisions.\n\nIn the final passage of Xici II we see a discussion of the\nimportance of decision making in divination.\n\n\nThe eight trigrams point the way by means of their images; the words\naccompanying the lines, and the decisions, speak according to the\ncircumstances. In that the firm and the yielding are interspersed,\ngood fortune and misfortune can be discerned.\n\nChanges and movements are judged according to the furtherance (that\nthey bring). Good fortune and misfortune change according to the\nconditions. Therefore: Love and hate combat each other, and good\nfortune and misfortune result therefrom. The far and the near injure\neach other, and remorse and humiliation result therefrom. The true and\nthe false influence each other, and advantage and injury result\ntherefrom. In all the situations of the Changes it is thus:\nWhen closely related things do not harmonize, misfortune is the\nresult: this gives rise to injury, remorse, and humiliation.\n(Xici II: 12; WB67: 355\u2013355)\n\n\nNo matter how we call it\u2014a critical moment, a pivotal juncture,\nor a turning point\u2014an inquirer engaged in divination is at a\ncrossroads in search of a direction. It is a time when the person\nfeels most vulnerable and perplexed. That person is totally alone in\nthis challenging situation when there is no precedent to guide him or\nher forward, nor are there rule books to help him or her navigate the\ncomplex situation. It is this revealing moment of\n\u201cnothingness\u201d\u2014no precedence, no guidance, nothing to\nhold on to\u2014that the trigrams and hexagrams are intended to\ncapture.\n\nYet, the tone of the authors of Xici is decidedly upbeat and\nproactive in discussing this moment of \u201cnothingness.\u201d They\ntell us that when we engage in divination, we can adjust our plans in\naccordance with the circumstances, think more broadly and creatively\nin searching for solutions, and develop strategies that are outside of\nthe conventions. The goal of practicing the rituals of divination,\nthey declare, is to balance the competing claims, and to make the\nimpossible possible.\n2. The Commentaries of the Book of Changes\n2.1 The Cosmological Approach\n\nThese four aspects of the Changes text\u2014the human\nfinitude, the decision making, the symbols, and the rituals\u2014were\nthe bases upon which the Changes commentators philosophized\nchange throughout imperial China. Over the two thousand years after\nthe canonization of the Changes in 135 BCE, commentators\ndeveloped three distinct approaches toward changes\u2014the\ncosmological approach, the rational humanistic approach, and the\ndivination approach. Now, let us first turn to the cosmology of\nchange.\n\nAfter its canonization in 125 BCE, the Changes text was\nsealed but its meaning continued to grow and expand in the following\ntwo thousand years, as readers repeatedly interpreted the classic to\nrespond to challenges of their times. By writing commentaries to\nexplicate the subtle meanings of the Changes, readers\ndeveloped what Hans-Georg Gadamer calls a \u201cfusion of\nhorizons\u201d (Gadamer 1989: 3\u201391; Tracy 1987: 1\u201327),\nwhere they responded to the \u201ccall to attention\u201d from the\nChanges in finding answers to questions that perplexed them.\nThroughout imperial China from the 2nd century BCE to 1911 CE,\nwhenever there were momentous changes in the socio-political order,\nthe Changes attracted tremendous attention as a living text\nthat offered insights and inspirations to those who were suppressed,\noppressed, or felt downtrodden.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE), when China was first\nunified for a long period of time, the dominant trend in interpreting\nthe Changes was the Images and Numbers (Xiangshu\n\u8c61\u6578) School. Focusing on the hexagram images and the\nsequence of hexagrams, the Images and Numbers School attracted the\nattention of the ruling elite who were preoccupied with building an\neternal empire. For the ruling elite, they felt that they had a\nmission to build a socio-political system that not only mimicked the\nrecurrent pattern of the universe but also responded proactively to\nthe ebb and flow of cosmic forces (Pines 2009, 2012; Loewe 1994, 2005;\nWang 2000).\n\nWhat underpinned the Numbers and Images School was a correlative\ncosmology. By aligning the hexagrams to depict the ebb and flow of the\ncosmic forces, the Numbers and Images School demonstrated what Sarah\nQueen calls the \u201cmutual responsiveness of heaven and\nhumanity\u201d (Queen 1996: 1\u201353). This mutual responsiveness\nwas based on two assumptions. First, the cosmos is orderly and stable.\nIts orderliness and stability are shown in the regular succession in\ntime, such as the four seasons, the twelve months, the 365 days.\nSecond, the same orderliness of the natural world is found in the\nhuman realm in the forms of life cycles, the rhythm of work and rest,\nand the rise and fall of family fortunes. Despite the vicissitudes on\nthe surface, the natural and human worlds are balanced, systematic and\npredictable. They are perfect mirrors of each other, such that when\none moves, the other responds.\n\nThe goal of correlative cosmology was not to develop a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the universe. Rather, it was to legitimize the\ntransition \u201cfrom the concept of imperial sovereignty based on\nmight into the need to support a claim to rule with intellectual\nsanctions\u201d (Loewe 1994: 121\u201341). Thus, the emperor was\nsaid to be the crucial link between the natural and human realms. In\nfact, according to the Han scholar Dong Zhongshu\n\u8463\u4ef2\u8212 (ca. 195\u2013105 BCE), the Chinese\ncharacter for king (\u738b) reflected the solemn responsibility of\nthe emperor (symbolized by the vertical stroke in the middle) for\nconnecting the three potencies \u2630: heaven (tian), earth\n(di) and humankind (ren) (Redmond & Hon 2014:\n159\u201361). As such, the emperor was indeed the Son of Heaven\n(tianzi) who was omnicompetent, omnipotent and omniscient\n(Loewe 2011; Queen 1996).\n\nTo support absolutism, Han commentators transformed the\nChanges into a cosmological manual reflecting the ebb and\nflow of cosmic forces. They earnestly reorganized the hexagram\nsequence to match the cosmic rhythm, demonstrating that the natural\nand human realms are one and the same. Although most of the writings\nof the Han commentators are lost, in an 8th-9th\ncentury text, Zhouyi jijie \u5468\u6613\u96c6\u89e3\n(A Collection of Explanations on the Changes of Zhou Dynasty)\nedited by Li Dingzuo \u674e\u9f0e\u795a, we have glimpses of the\nambition of the Han commentators who spent their lives fathoming the\ncosmos and ordering the world (R. Smith 2008: 57\u201388).\n\nFor instance, Jing Fang (77\u201337 BCE) created the Hexagrams of\nEight Palaces (ba gong gua): Qian\u4dc0,\nKun \u4dc1, Zhen \u4df2, Xun \u4df8,\nKan \u4ddc, Li \u4ddd, Gen \u4df3,\nDui \u4df9. These eight palace hexagrams are the doubles of\nthe eight trigrams. For Jing, each of these palace hexagrams leads a\ngroup of seven hexagrams. For example, Qian \u4dc0 leads\n\u4deb, \u4de0, \u4dcb, \u4dd3, \u4dd6, \u4de2, \u4dcd.\nIn this new alignment of hexagrams, there is both a steady increase or\ndecrease of the yin and yang cosmic forces, and the\nthe hidden power of the two forces even when they are dormant (for the\nnew sequence of 64 hexagrams based on eight palaces, see Nielson 2003:\n3).\n\nAnother new sequence of hexagrams was the \u201cwaning and waxing\nhexagrams\u201d (xiaoxi gua \u6d88\u606f\u5366)\nperfected by Yu Fan (164\u2013233). Representing the ebb and flow of\nthe yin and yang cosmic forces, the \u201cwaning\nand waxing hexagrams\u201d go as follows:\n\n\nFu\n\n\u4dd7[24]\n \u2192\n\n\nLin\n\n\u4dd2[19]\n \u2192\n\n\nTai\n\n\u4dca[11]\n \u2192\n\n\nDazhuang\n\n\u4de1[34]\n \u2192\n\n\nGuai\n\n\u4dea[43]\n \u2192\n\n\nQian\n\n\u4dc0[1]\n \u2192\n\n\nGou\n\n\u4deb[44]\n \u2192\n\n\nDun\n\n\u4de0[33]\n \u2192\n\n\nPi\n\n\u4dcb[12]\n \u2192\n\n\nGuan\n\n\u4dd3[20]\n \u2192\n\n\nBo\n\n\u4dd6[23]\n \u2192\n\n\nKun\n\n\u4dc1[2]\n \u2192\n\n\n(back to Fu)\n\n\n\nWhen reading from Fu to Qian, the yang\nforce gradually increases while the yin force decreases. When\nreading from Gou to Kun, the yin force\nincreases while the yang force decreases. As a system, the\ntwelve hexagrams are continuous. When the series ends with\nKun, it begins anew with Fu (Nielson 2003:\n275\u201376).\n\nBy developing these new hexagram sequences, the Han Changes\ncommentators wanted to achieve two goals. First, they freed themselves\nfrom the original sequence of the 64 hexagrams that was, to them,\nincoherent and inconsistent. To the Han commentators, the problem of\nthe original sequence was its failure in lining up hexagrams in\naccordance with their graphic images. By creating new sequences, the\nHan scholars were able to match perfectly the hexagram images with the\nebb and flow of cosmic forces (Redmond & Hon 2014: 159\u2013163).\nSecond, with the new sequences, the Han commentators were better\nequipped to synchronize the hexagrams with the lunar calendar, showing\na direct correspondence between the ebb and flow of the cosmic forces\nand the cycles of life in human society (R. Smith 2008: 62\u201377).\nFor instance, the \u201cwaning and waxing hexagrams\u201d were\nassigned to represent months in the lunar calendar (Nielson 2003:\n275\u201376):\n\n\n\nFu\n\u4dd7\nthe eleventh month \n\nLin\n\u4dd2\nthe twelfth month \n\nTai\n\u4dca\nthe first month of the following year \n\nDazhuang\n\u4de1\nthe second month \n\nGuai\n\u4dea\nthe third month \n\nQian\n\u4dc0\nthe fourth month \n\nGou\n\u4deb\nthe fifth month \n\nDun\n\u4de0\nthe sixth month \n\nPi\n\u4dcb\nthe seventh month \n\nGuan\n\u4dd3\nthe eighth month \n\nBo\n\u4dd6\nthe ninth month \n\nKun\n\u4dc1\nthe tenth month  \n\n\nThe same could be done for the hexagrams sequence based on the eight\npalaces. By matching the new sequence of the 64 hexagrams with 12\nmonths, the Han commentators allotted eight months to four hexagrams\nand four months to eight hexagrams (Nielson 2003: 5).\n\nTo Han commentators, while the new hexagram sequences highlighted\ncertainty in the universe\u2019s self-renewal, each hexagram\nrepresented the possibility of coping with the changing environment.\nThese differing functions addressed a fundamental question in ruling a\nhuge empire: How to formulate flexible policies while keeping a\nsemblance of unity and uniformity? To give themselves flexibility in\ninterpreting hexagrams, the Han commentators created new interpretive\nstrategies. One common strategy called for linking one hexagram to\nfour hexagrams. Take, for instance, Qian \u4dc0 (The\nCreative, #1). To interpret the hexagram, one can link it to its\nopposite, Kun \u4dc1 (The Receptive, #2), known as\n\u201claterally linked hexagrams\u201d (pangtong) (Nielson\n2003: 185\u201388). In addition, Qian can also be read along\nwith its preceding hexagram and following hexagram in accordance with\nthe sequence of the \u201cwaning and waxing hexagrams\u201d. So,\nQian can be read in relation to Guai \u4dea\n(Resolution, #43), its antecedent, and Gou \u4deb\n(Encounter, #44), its posterior. And then, within a hexagram, one can\nalso create \u201cinterlocking trigrams\u201d (hugua or\nhuti), that is, using four or five of the hexagram lines to\nform two new trigrams (Nielson 2003: 111\u201314). In the case\nofQian, it is not possible to create \u201cinterlocking\ntrigrams\u201d due to all six lines being yang. But in other\ncases, the \u201cinterlocking trigrams\u201d are significant in\ndeciphering the meaning of a hexagram. Take, for instance, Ge\n\u4df0 (Radical Change, #49). Its second, third, and fourth lines\nform a Sun trigram \u2634 and its third, four, and fifth\nform a Qian trigram \u2630 Combining Sun and\nQian forms Gou \u4deb (Encounter, #44).\n\nAnother strategy of expanding the scope of interpretation was to turn\na hexagram into a different one by transposing some of its lines.\nKnown as \u201cchanging the positions of hexagram lines\u201d\n(yiwei), this strategy allowed Han scholars to introduce\nother hexagrams when having problems interpreting a hexagram. For\ninstance, Tai \u4dca (Peace, #11) can become Jiji\n\u4dfe (Ferrying Complete #63) by transposing its second line (a\nyang) and its fifth line (a yin). Likewise,\nDazhuang \u4de1 (Great Strength, #34) can turn into\nXu \u4dc4 (Waiting, #5) by switching its fourth line (a\nyang) and its fifth line (a yin). Much more\nversatile than other methods, the transposition of hexagram lines gave\nHan commentators the liberty to inject a broad range of alternatives\nwhen interpreting a hexagram.\n\nThus, by giving themselves flexibility in interpreting hexagrams, the\nHan commentators reaffirmed the orderliness, stability, and\npredictability of the cosmic and human realms. They transformed the\nChanges into a cosmological manual to match the rhythm of\ncosmic forces. In doing so, the Han commentators suppressed and\nexternalized the human fear of uncertainty. They suppressed fear by\nfocusing attention on the repeated rhythm of the universe, as\nevidenced by the seasonal changes and the passage of time from month\nto month. They externalized fear by concentrating on the grand scheme\nof the universe\u2019s renewal that did not seem to give room to\nuncertainty or rupture. More importantly, by matching the cosmic realm\nwith the human rhythm, they created an illusion that the\nChanges was a ruler\u2019s playbook to fathom the cosmos and\norder the world (Ch\u2019en 1986: 798\u2013801; R. Smith 2008:\n62\u201388).\n2.2 The Rational Humanistic Approach\n\nBut the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 CE reveals a fundamental\nproblem of correlative cosmology, namely, human beings are incapable\nof fully discerning the cosmic pattern, nor can they completely apply\nthe cosmic pattern to human affairs. Even if they tried to mimic the\ncosmic rhythm in governing the human world, the human world is far too\ncomplicated for anyone to handle. In the following seven hundred\nyears, Changes scholars retreated from fathoming the cosmos.\nInstead, they turned their attention to ordering the human world and\nlooked for its deep structure.\n\nThe major figure who started this turn to the human world was Wang Bi\n\u738b\u5f3c (226\u2013249). Born six years after the collapse of\nthe Han dynasty, Wang Bi was thrown into a situation in which there\nseemed to be few certainties in life. With China divided into three\nseparate kingdoms\u2014the Wei, the Shu, and the Wu\u2014there was\nwidespread disorder in the country. When everything was in ruin, fewer\nand fewer people followed the Confucian precepts of honesty, loyalty,\nand filial piety. Instead, trickery, usurpation and pragmatic\ncalculation became the accepted strategies for survival. Apparently,\nWang Bi\u2019s experience after the collapse of the Han dynasty\nbrought him face to face with fear and anxiety\u2014the two recurrent\nthemes in the Changes (Hon 2010). Before his premature death\nat the age of 23, Wang wrote a commentary on the Changes\nalong with a commentary on the Laozi. Attached to his\nChanges commentary, the Zhouyi zhu\n\u5468\u6613\u6ce8 (A Commentary on the Zhou Changes),\nwere seven essays in which he discussed how to read the classic. In\nthese essays (rendered as \u201cGeneral Remarks on the Changes of\nthe Zhou\u201d by Richard John Lynn, see Lynn 1994:\n25\u201339), he revisited themes that had been discussed in the\nXici, including what a hexagram symbolizes and what the six\nlines of a hexagram tell us about human existence. In these essays, he\npresented a notion of change that was completely new.\n\nFirst and foremost, unlike the Han commentators, Wang Bi did not\nconsider the hexagram sequence as important. Instead, he regards each\nof the 64 hexagrams as a discrete situation. Furthermore, he points\nout that the uniqueness of each hexagram is succinctly summarized in\nTuan (one of the \u201cTen Wings\u201d), such as\nZhun \u4dc2 (Difficulty at the Beginning #3) discusses the\ndifficulty when someone starts an endeavor, Meng \u4dc3\n(Youthful Folly, #4) focuses on how a teacher hone his or her skills\nin teaching; Xu \u4dc4 (Waiting #5) suggests a pause to\nreflect on one\u2019s precarious situation (\u201cMing Tuan\u201d,\nLynn 1994: 25\u201327). As such, readers do not have to strictly\nfollow the hexagram sequence in reading hexagrams. They can pick and\nchoose hexagrams that appear to directly address questions in mind. No\nmatter which hexagrams they pick, the key point is to see a hexagram\nas a field of action where different forces or players interact.\n\nIn his essay \u201cMing Xiang\u201d \u660e\u8c61 (Clarifying the\nImages), Wang Bi explains why he wants to change the way of reading\nthe Yijing. He writes:\n\n\nImages are the means to express ideas. Words are the means to explain\nthe images. To yield up ideas completely, there is nothing better than\nthe images, and to yield up the meaning of images, there is nothing\nbetter than words. The words are generated by the images, thus one can\nponder the words and so observe what the images are. The images are\ngenerated by ideas, thus one can ponder the images and so observe what\nthe ideas are. The ideas are yielded up completely by the images, and\nthe images are made explicit by the words. Thus since the words are\nthe means to explain the images, once one gets the images, he forgets\nthe words, and since the images are the means to allow us to\nconcentrate on the ideas, once one gets the ideas, he forgets the\nimages. (Lynn 1994: 31)\n\n\nHere, Wang Bi is criticizing the Han exegetes for believing a direct\ncorrespondence exists between symbols and reality, words and\nreferents. For him, the Han exegetes are doomed to failure in using\nthe 64 hexagrams to match the unfolding of the universe. Given the\nscope and scale of the universe, whatever system of knowledge that the\nHan exegetes create will not be able to include all the animate and\ninanimate beings, nor can it capture the fluidity and diversity in the\nconstant transformation in the universe. Furthermore, the repeated\npatterns that the Han exegetes identify are merely what human beings\nobserve or experience; they are not the \u201creal cosmic\npatterns\u201d that the universe follows, as the frequent appearance\nof anomalies, calamities, disasters, and unexplained events\ndemonstrate. For this reason, Wang Bi suggested that \u201conce one\ngets the images, he forgets the words\u201d (dexiang zai\nwangyan \u5f97\u8c61\u5728\u5fd8\u8a00) and \u201conce\none gets the ideas, he forgets the images\u201d (deyi er\nwangxiang \u5f97\u610f\u800c\u5fd8\u8c61).\n\nIn the latter part of the essay, Wang borrows the Zhuangzi metaphors\nof \u201crabbit snares\u201d (ti \u8e44) and \u201cfish\ntrap\u201d (quan \u7b4c) to underscore the need to look at\nreality without being distracted by words or images. He writes:\n\n\nSimilarly, the rabbit snare exists for the sake for the rabbit; once\none gets the rabbit, he forgets the snare. And the fish trap exists\nfor the sake of fish; once one gets the fish, he gets the trap. If\nthis is so, then the words are snares for the images, and the images\nare traps for the ideas. (Lynn 1994: 31)\n\n\nFor Wang Bi, \u201cimages\u201d (xiang \u8c61) are traps\nbecause they give us a false sense of reality, confusing a\nrepresentation of reality with the reality itself. Particularly in the\nHan period, the commentators of the Changes deployed the\nhexagrams to depict the rise and fall Yin and Yang forces, as if the\nsequence of hexagrams could accurately map the unfolding of the\nuniverse. In a sarcastic tone, Wang questions the effectiveness of\nusing the hexagrams to mimic the cosmic patterns. He writes:\n\n\nIf the lines really do fit with the idea of compliance, why is it\nnecessarily that hexagram Kun \u5764 (The Receptive, #2)\nrepresent only the cow; and if its concept really corresponds to the\nidea of dynamism, why is it necessary that hexagram Qian\n\u4e7e (The Creative, #1) represent only the horse? (Lynn 1994:\n32)\n\n\nWorse still, when the matching of hexagrams with the unfolding of the\nuniverse did not work, the Han exegetes created even more methods,\nsuch as \u201coverlapping trigrams\u201d and \u201ctrigram\nchange\u201d, to make the correspondence look tenable (Lynn 1994:\n32). For Wang Bi, when more of these methods are created, more gaps\nand exceptions will appear in human systems of knowledge, showing\ntheir falsity and inadequacy.\n\nWang Bi\u2019s goal in critiquing the Han exegetes was to put forward\na new method of reading the text. Rather than creating a system of\nhuman knowledge that matched the vast scope and scale of the universe,\nWang suggested that we should accept the limit of our\nknowledge\u2014namely, we only know what we can know. We know that\nthe universe is a totality, but we can only apprehend its grand unity\nin our daily life and through our surroundings. Because of our\nfinitude, we should see hexagrams as symbols helping us to link with\nthe universe. They are pointers, in the form of temporal-spatial\ngrids, that reveal the totality of the universe in the concrete\nsituation of our life. As such, whichever hexagram is picked, it will\nprovoke a conversation between the symbol and the reader, allowing the\nreader to see the field of action in front of him.\n\nThus, for Wang Bi, the purpose of reading hexagrams is to reflect on\none\u2019s situation (see \u201cMingyao tongbian\u201d\n\u660e\u723b\u901a\u8b8a, Lynn 1994: 27\u201329). The six\nlines of a hexagram\u2014even a bad one like Gu \u4dd1\n(Ills to Be Cured, #18)\u2014offer options to respond to a situation.\nThey represent the room to maneuver within a system or the\npossibilities of altering an existing power structure. Precisely in\nthis juncture that exists between what is already set and what can be\nchanged, Wang Bi sees the fluidity of human affairs. With proper\naction, one can turn what appears to be a failure into a blessing.\nConversely, lacking appropriate action, one can make what appears to\nbe flourishing into a disaster.\n\nFor this reason, Wang Bi does not find the inauspicious hexagram\nSun \u4de8 (Diminution, #41) terribly frightening (Lynn\n1994: 387\u201396). Judging from its hexagram image and line\nstatements, Sun suggests a situation where those who are high\nup take advantage of those who are in lower positions, or those who\nare physically strong victimize those who are weak. Yet, despite the\ninjustice denoted in the hexagram, Wang Bi believes there is still\nroom for optimism. \u201cSupreme good fortune\u201d will come, he\ndeclares, if someone finds ways to benefit the public. Similarly, the\n\u201coppressions\u201d in hexagram Kun \u4dee (Impasse,\n#47) are avoidable (Lynn 1994: 428\u201337). Judging from its line\nstatements, Kun is hopeless. All of its six lines are plagued\nwith some form of oppression: the first line is buried under a barren\ntree, the second line is burdened with excessive drinking and eating,\nthe third line is caught in rocks, the fourth line is locked in a\ngolden carriage, the fifth line is bullied by a man with purple knee\nbands, and the sixth line is wrapped by creeping vines. Yet Wang Bi\nargues that by making the right decision one can reverse what seems to\nbe an oppressive situation into an opportunity for growth and\nadvancement.\n\nBy stressing human agency and activism, Wang Bi sees hexagrams as\npointers, directing our attention to the source of human creativity\nand ingenuity. As pointers, hexagrams and hexagram lines serve\ndifferent functions. While a hexagram connotes a field of action, the\nsix hexagram lines stand for the six players (or the six options) in\nthat field of action (see \u201cMinggua shibian\ntongyao\u201d \u660e\u5366\u9069\u8b8a\u901a\u723b,\nLynn 1994: 29\u201331). Symbolizing the whole, a hexagram represents\na web of relations governing the actions and interactions of the six\nplayers. Symbolizing the parts, hexagram lines represent what the six\nplayers can or cannot do to advance their interests. Hence, in reading\nhexagrams, Changes readers are constantly reminded that every\naspect of human life, big or small, is governed by the part-whole\nrelationship. To cope with change, Wang Bi asserts, we must find out\nthe part-whole relationship in each given situation\u2014be it in\nfamily, society, or a solitary quest for spiritual communion with\nnature.\n\nWith the different functions of hexagrams and hexagram lines in mind,\nwe can understand why Wang Bi stresses the mutual dependency of\nsomethingness (you \u6709) and nothingness (wu\n\u65e0) in his commentary on Xici 1.8 as preserved by Han\nKangbo \u97d3\u5eb7\u4f2f (332\u2013380 CE). As discuss\nearlier, Xici 1.8 describes an elaborate process to select a\nhexagram by counting 50 yarrow stalks. Known as \u201cthe number of\nGreat Expansion\u201d (dayan zhi shu\n\u5927\u884d\u4e4b\u6578), the selection begins with the\ndiviner separating the 50 yarrow stalks into two piles: (a) a group of\n49 stalks that will be used to select a hexagram, and (b) an unused\nstalk that will be set aside in the rest of the divination procedure.\nWang Bi views the group of 49 stalks as somethingness and the unused\nstalk as nothingness. He writes:\n\n\nAfter expanding the numbers of heaven and earth, we find that the ones\nthat are of benefit to us number fifty, and of these we actually use\nforty-nine, thus leaving one unused. Although this one is not used,\nyet through it the use of the other numbers becomes readily possible,\nand although this one is not one of the numbers, yet through it the\nother numbers are formed. As this one represents the supreme ultimate\nof change, the other forty-nine constitute the ultimate of numbers.\nNothingness cannot be brought to light by means of nothingness but\nmust take place through somethingness. Therefore, by applying\nourselves constantly to this ultimate among things that have\nsomethingness, we shall surely bring to light the primogenitor from\nwhich all things derive. (Lynn 1994: 60\u201361; translation\nmodified)\n\n\nIn his comments, Wang Bi cleverly turns the discussion of divination\ninto a meditation on the co-dependence of somethingness and\nnothingness. He argues that somethingness depends on nothingness\nbecause the forty-nine yarrow stalks become useful only when they are\nutilized in casting a hexagram. Conversely, nothingness cannot fulfill\nitself without somethingness because there is no way to perform a\ndivination without the 49 yarrow stalks. Representing the practice of\ndivination, nothingness gives the purpose, the unity, and the\ncoherence to the act of throwing of the 49 yarrow stalks. Representing\nthe actual steps of casting a hexagram by throwing the yarrow stalks,\nsomethingness makes divination possible.\n\nAn analogy would be a performance of Beethoven\u2019s fifth symphony.\nAs members of the audience, we see musicians playing notes under the\nbaton of a conductor. As listeners, we hear Beethoven\u2019s music\nthat is invisible and ineffable yet transcends everything that happens\non stage. Here, the key point is the mutual dependency of the tangible\nand intangible, what we see and what we hear. Without\nBeethoven\u2019s music (a structure of notes), there would not have\nbeen a performance of the fifth symphony. Conversely, without a\nperformance by an orchestra in front of an audience, Beethoven\u2019s\nscores remain but scribbles on paper\u2014a potentiality that is\nuntapped and unrealized.\n\nOne may argue that Wang Bi\u2019s reading of the hexagrams limits the\nChanges to concrete human affairs. Unlike the Han dynasty\ncommentators, Wang had little interest in cosmology and rejected any\nattempt to match the cosmic and human realms. But in seeing the\nhexagrams as temporal-spatial grids, Wang reminds us that the\nChanges is meant to be read metaphorically. In focusing on\nthe hexagrams as pointers\u2014pointing toward something hidden,\nimplicit, yet fundamental in time and space\u2014he avoids the\npitfall of the Han dynasty commentators who turned the\nChanges into a copious system of signs to document the\nmultifarious changes in the universe. For him, the Han dynasty\ncommentators\u2019 attempt is futile because they do not accept the\nbasic tenet of the Changes\u2014the limits of human\nknowledge.\n\nIn returning to the root of the Changes as symbols, Wang Bi\ndirects readers\u2019 attention to the metaphorical significance of\nthe hexagrams. As pointers, hexagrams help readers develop a mental\npicture of their surroundings, allowing them to sort out the\nopportunities as well as the limitations in each given situation.\nHexagrams also expand readers\u2019 horizons by directing their\nattention from what is near to what is distant, from what is apparent\nto what is concealed. Above all, they give readers hope by showing the\ninfinite possibilities of changing our lives if we pay careful\nattention to our surroundings.\n\nOn this score, Wang Bi is right that the Changes is simple\nbut profound. Its symbols appear to be simple but the message they\ncarry is profound. The profundity of the Changes lies in the\nfact that the book not only offers hope and encouragement in facing\nthe challenges of life, but it also stresses human agency and activism\nin coming to terms with serendipity and uncertainty. With a critical\nassessment of our surroundings through a reading of hexagrams, we are\nempowered to turn what appears to be a failure into a blessing, or an\nimpasse into a test of character. We live because we are ready to take\ncharge of our lives. We live because we have (in Paul Tillich\u2019s\nwords) the \u201ccourage to be\u201d as part of the whole and as\noneself (Tillich 1952: 86\u2013147).\n2.3 The Divination Approach\n\nWang Bi\u2019s Changes commentary became the standard for\ninterpreting the classic throughout mid-imperial China. Its august\nstatus was confirmed by the state-approved Zhouyi zhengyi\n\u5468\u6613\u6b63\u7fa9 (The True Meanings of the Zhou\nChanges) edited by Kong Yingda \u5b54\u7a4e\u9054\n(574\u2013648). Throughout the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) and the\nSong dynasty (960\u20131126), knowledge of Wang Bi\u2019s\nChanges commentary was tested in civil service examinations.\nIts longevity as the standard Changes commentary indicated\nconsensus among the Chinese elite that attention must be paid to\nsolving the pressing problems in the country rather than building an\neternal empire that mimicked the cosmic rhythm (Hon 2004, 2005; R.\nSmith 2008: 89\u2013139).\n\nHowever, while Wang Bi criticized the Han commentators for being\noverly ambitious in blending the natural and human realms, he was also\noverly ambitious in using human reason to discern the hidden principle\nof human affairs. Whereas Han commentators suppressed and externalized\nthe human fear of uncertainty, Wang also suppressed and externalized\nthe same fear. In viewing hexagrams as fields of action, he suppressed\nthe fear by absorbing it into part-whole relations in human affairs.\nBy turning hexagrams into pointers, he externalized the fear by\nconnecting it to a search for the principle of change in the rises and\nfalls of human life. In the end, both the Han scholars and Wang Bi\nwere hubristic in assuming they were omniscient.\n\nIn contrast, Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\u2014a key\nfigure of the Cheng-Zhu School of Neo-Confucianism of late imperial\nChina\u2014argued that the \u201coriginal meaning\u201d\n(benyi \u672c\u7fa9) of Changes was divination.\nOn the surface of it, Zhu Xi\u2019s argument seemed redundant. It had\nbeen well-known that the first two layers of the classics were oracles\noriginating from the Western Zhou period. But Zhu Xi\u2019s point was\nthat for more than a thousand years since the canonization of the\nChanges, the classic had never been read properly as a\ndivination manual. For this reason, Zhu Xi believed that the true\nmeaning of Changes lay in the imagery of the 64 hexagrams. To\ndistinguish the 64 hexagrams from the Ten Wings, Zhu Xi created two\nseparate categories in his commentary, the Zhouyi benyi\n\u5468\u6613\u672c\u7fa9 (The Original Meaning of the Zhou\nChanges). One category was the \u201cclassic\u201d\n(jing \u7d93) which covered the 64 hexagrams; the other the\n\u201ccommentarial materials\u201d (zhuan \u50b3) which\nincluded the Ten Wings. With these two categories, Zhu made clear that\nthe Ten Wings were at best supplementary materials in understanding\nthe hexagrams.\n\nUnderlying his view was a different understanding of the formation of\nthe Changes. Unlike other Changes commentators, Zhu\ndid not see the classic as an evolution from divination to philosophy.\nFor him, the sixty-four hexagrams are the foundation of the\nChanges because they are symbols of the constant changes in\nthe natural and human worlds. This pictorial depiction of\ntransformation\u2014started by Fu Xi and completed by King Wen and\nthe Duke of Zhou\u2014was later turned into a discussion of cosmology\nand morality by Confucian scholars. As a result, the Changes\nceased to be a pictorial description of the awesome and awe-inspiring\ntransformation in the universe; it became merely another text (like\nthe Book of Poetry and the Book of History in the\nConfucian canon) that taught morality to kings, nobles and government\nofficials (Hon 2008).\n\nBy privileging Fu Xi\u2019s hexagrams over Confucius\u2019s Ten\nWings, Zhu Xi wanted to achieve two goals. First, he underscored the\nimportance of divination as a method of self-cultivation. For him,\ndivination is not a superstitious act of seeking guidance from a\nsupernatural power. Rather, it is an enriching experience of\nencountering the unknown and unfathomable. In the process of\ndivination, one faces the multiple forces that shape human life, and\nthereby becomes aware of the opportunities and resources for improving\none\u2019s situation. As Joseph Adler observes, divination is\n\u201ca way of learning\u201d to Zhu Xi because it helps learners\n\u201c\u2018respond\u2019 (ying) to\n\u2018incipient\u2019 change (chi), both in external events\nand in the mind\u201d (Adler 1990: 190). Second, by focusing on the\nvisual imagery of the hexagrams, Zhu Xi saw the Changes as\nsignificantly different from other Confucian classics. Rather than\nlimiting to kings, nobles and government officials, the\nChanges appeals to a broad audience who, literate or\nilliterate, are concerned with uncertainties in life (Hon 2011).\n\nFor this reason, Zhu Xi emphasized the ambiguity of line statements.\nTo highlight their ambiguity, he divided the line statements into two\nseparate utterances: a summary of the image of the hexagram line, and\na prognostication based on a careful consideration of the image of the\nhexagram line. By dividing a line statement into two parts, Zhu Xi\nturns a line statement into a dialogue between the oracle\u2019s\ncalling to attention and the reader\u2019s response. In this\nhermeneutical circle, nothing is certain or preordained. The\nconversation can lead in many directions, sometimes predictable and\nsometimes unpredictable.\n\nOn the surface of it, like Wang Bi, Zhu Xi appears to use the\nChanges to provoke readers to reflect on their surroundings.\nHowever, there is one fundamental difference. For Zhu Xi, a reading of\nthe Changes does not necessarily answer all questions or\nsolve all problems. Rather, it heightens the reader\u2019s\nsensitivity to the uncertainty and serendipity of human existence. For\ninstance, Ge \u9769 \u4df0 (Radical Change, #49) and\nDing \u9f0e \u4df1 (The Cauldron, #50) are known for\nhighlighting the anxiety and fear in a drastic political change. In\nGe, the reader is encouraged to lead a revolt against a\ntyrant ruler who is causing harm to the public. To underscore the\nurgency of addressing the political crisis, the revolt is compared to\nthe renewal of lives in seasonal changes; it is paired with the\npivotal event of the Shang dynasty being replaced by the Zhou dynasty.\nAbove all, it is described as a timely intervention in human affairs\nto restore order for the benefit of the masses (for a translation of\nGe, see WB67: 189\u2013192). While Ge advocates a\nregime change, Ding demands the restoration of political\norder immediately following the revolt. Graphically, the six lines of\nDing \u4df1 resemble a cauldron\u2014the bottom line\nrepresents the legs of the cauldron; the second to fourth lines\nsymbolize the belly of the cauldron; the fifth line denotes the ears\nof the cauldron, and the top line suggests the bar that carries the\ncauldron from place to place. Thus, the reader is encouraged to clean\nthe cauldron to make food, or, in the aftermath of a regime change, to\nimmediately re-establish the political order (for a translation of\nDing, see WB67: 195\u201397).\n\nFor centuries, the Changes\u2019s commentators heeded the\nXugua authors\u2019 advice to read Ge and\nDing together as two phases of a regime change (see WB67:\n635, 641). While Ge discusses the destructive phase of\ntoppling an old regime, Ding refers to the constructive phase\nof rebuilding the political order. The two hexagrams jointly call\nattention to the danger of political corruption, the fear of a tyrant,\nand the anxiety of losing control amid political upheaval. More\nimportant, the two hexagrams highlight the importance of making the\nright decision amidst power struggles. For this reason, through the\ncenturies, Ge and Ding received special attention\nfrom commentators who were interested in political philosophy (see,\nfor instance, Wang Bi\u2019s commentary in Lynn 1994:\n444\u201359).\n\nFor Zhu Xi, however, there was no need to connect Ge with\nDing. Instead, he sees them as separate situations where\nreaders can ask different questions and express different concerns.\nFor him, the anxiety and fear in the Changes appear not in\nthe hexagram sequence, but in the dialogue between the oracle and the\nreader. To downplay the political connotations of these two hexagrams,\nZhu Xi stresses the intensity of the oracle-reader dialogue. Take, for\nexample, the hexagram statement of Ge which seems to suggest\nthe possibility of \u201cthe disappearance of remorse\u201d after\npolitical change. For Zhu, there is no way to tell whether \u201cthe\ndisappearance of remorse\u201d is possible without considering the\nreader\u2019s situation. If the reader is doing the right things,\nthen remorse will automatically disappear. But if the reader is making\na mistake, remorse will remain. Hence, \u201cthe disappearance of\nremorse\u201d is provisional; whether the oracle will come true rests\nin reader\u2019s motive, sincerity and action. Similarly, \u201cthe\ndisappearance of remorse\u201d in the fourth line of Ge is\nprovisional as well. Traditionally, the fourth line is read as a\nleader ready to lead a political change. For Zhu Xi, the fourth line\ndoes not look like a situation ripe for political change. Rather, he\nsees \u201cthe disappearance of remorse\u201d as a warning against\nrushing to make drastic changes (Hon 2008).\n\nLikewise, Zhu Xi does not see in Ding a roadmap to form a new\nregime. Instead, he sees each line of Ding as a separate\nsituation challenging the Changes reader. For instance, in\nthe first yin line, Zhu Xi is not worried about the\nline\u2019s peripheral position. Rather, he is interested in the\nprognostication which indicates that the line is \u201cwithout\nremorse\u201d (wujiu \u65e0\u548e). In his comments, Zhu\nXi focuses on the subtle meaning of \u201cwithout remorse\u201d and\nurges the reader to be positive about the future. He tells the reader\nthat \u201cwithout remorse\u201d is a result of the first\nline\u2019s determination to come back from behind and its will to\nsucceed despite its humble position (Hon 2008).\n\nUltimately, for Zhu Xi, all the Changes oracles are\nprovisional. Their goal is to provoke thought, command attention, and\nabove all, make readers aware of the contingency of human existence.\nBy highlighting fear and anxiety in reading hexagrams, Zhu Xi\nincorporated the Changes into his Neo-Confucian\nproject\u2014an endeavor, he hoped, that would lead to the triumph of\nthe pure and perceptive \u201cmind of the Dao\u201d (daoxin\n\u9053\u5fc3) over the perturbed and perverse \u201chuman\nmind\u201d (renxin \u4eba\u5fc3). To develop a Confucian\nmoral-metaphysics, Zhu Xi turned to the split second of decision\nmaking as a battle ground of one\u2019s moral cultivation. In that\nsplit second, Zhu Xi claimed, the human mind is deeply torn between\n\u201cthe mind of the Dao\u201d and \u201cthe human\nmind\u201d, and between \u201cthe heavenly principle\u201d\n(tianli) and \u201chuman desires\u201d (renyu)\n(Adler 2014; Tu 1985: 131\u201348). In this mental battle, the\nChanges reader is put into a moral-metaphysical journey. The\nhexagrams give the readers hope without losing sight of the immense\nchallenge of overcoming mishaps and failure. They promise success if\nreaders find the means to tame their searching minds and to counter\nthe distractions in their lives. Above all, they give spiritual depth\nto the readers\u2019 moral struggle, turning it into a battle ground\nbetween following the dictates of the flesh, or elevating oneself to\nform a \u201ctrinity with heaven and earth\u201d.\n\nIn this way, Zhu Xi opened the Changes to a wide range of\naudience. By focusing on divination and the symbolism of the 64\nhexagrams, Zhu Xi made the Changes relevant to readers who\nmight not be well educated. While it remained a canonical text, it was\ntransformed into \u201ca book of life\u201d for common people who\nstruggled daily to make the right decision between the purity of\n\u201cthe heavenly principle\u201d and the perversion of\n\u201chuman desires\u201d (Hon 2012). From the Ming dynasty\n(1368\u20131644) to the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), Zhu\nXi\u2019s interpretation of the Changes was promoted by the\nimperial government. It was included in the state-approved\nChanges commentaries, the Zhouyi daquan\n\u5468\u6613\u5927\u5168 (The Compendium of Cheng Yi\u2019s\nand Zhu Xi\u2019s Commentaries on the Zhou Changes) of the\nMing dynasty, and the Zhouyi zhezhong\n\u5468\u6613\u6298\u4e2d (Balanced Annotations of the Zhou\nChanges) of the Qing dynasty.\n3. Face Changes with Courage and Dignity\n\nOn the surface, these three approaches\u2014the cosmological\napproach, the rational humanistic approach, and the divination\napproach\u2014appear to steadily narrow the scope of philosophizing\nchange. They seem to continuously move away from the cosmos to the\nhuman world, and from the human world to an individual\u2019s moral\ncogitations. One may even say that in this narrowing of the scope, we\nsee a retreat from the empirical to the intellectual, and from the\nobjective to the subjective.\n\nYet, in their own ways, these three approaches offer answers to the\nhuman anxiety over uncertainty. They give hope to readers by\ntransforming the trigrams and hexagrams into symbols to discuss the\nhuman roles in the unfolding of the universe (Cheng 2003; Cheng &\nNg 2009; Redmond & Hon 2014: 140\u201357; R. Smith 2008:\n31\u201348). Together, they make three arguments:\n\nBecause the universe is an open system that is self-generative and\nself-transformative, we must live with ceaseless change;\nBecause changes take place all the time, we must find ways to\nunderstand their patterns and to navigate their complexity;\nIn every moment, we must be ready to make difficult decisions in\norder to find peace and comfort in life.\n\n\nBy emphasizing our need to make difficult decisions in the world of\nconstant changes, the authors of Changes are not suggesting\nus to be over-worried. Rather, they remind us of our limited ability\nin understanding the complexity and fluidity of our world. After\nhonestly accepting our finitude, the authors of Changes\nsuggest us to be active and aggressive in reshaping our situation.\nHere, the turnaround rests on our wisdom of knowing what we can and\ncannot do. We must remain humble and circumspective in our every step.\nBut based on what we know, we make plans to gradually improve our\nenvironment. Like a droplet, we rise and fall with the wave of the\nocean. Since both the objective reality and the subjective condition\nare perpetually shifting, the moment of finding a harmonious\nintegration between attainable and unattainable is always transient.\nWhen either the objective reality and the subjective condition\nchanges, or worse still, both of them change, the whole equilibrium is\nupset, and the process of searching for a new equilibrium has to begin\nanew. On this note, that is no better ending to the Changes\nthan hexagram Weiji \u672a\u6fdf (\u4dff Ferrying\nIncomplete, #64) because the act of balancing the competing claims and\nfinding certainty in an uncertain world are going to be continuous\nwithout end.\n\nFor us today, this philosophy of change is refreshing and energizing\nbecause it encourages us to be spontaneous, creative, and experimental\nin coping with the complexity in life. It also draws our attention to\nthe reality of the 21st century world that is dynamic,\nfluid, multi-layered, and multi-causal due to the global economy and\nthe transnational networks of circulation. More importantly, it\nreminds us that we are both a subject and an object in making\ndecisions. On the one hand, we are the products of our environment; on\nthe other hand, we are active players in reshaping our environment. In\nthe end, we are who we are\u2014constantly finding our paths in an\never-changing world. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources and <em>Changes</em> Translations", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources and <em>Changes</em> Translations": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Li Dingzuo \u674e\u9f0e\u795a, 1984, <em>Zhouyi jijie</em>\n\u5468\u6613\u96c6\u89e3 (A Collection of Explanations on the\n<em>Zhou</em> Changes), Beijing: Zhongguo shudian.", "Lynn, Richard John (trans.), 1994, <em>The Classic of Changes: A\nNew Translation of the <span class=\"plain\">I Ching</span> as\nInterpreted by Wang Bi</em>, (Translations from the Asian Classics),\nNew York: Columbia University Press.", "Rutt, Richard (trans.), 1996, <em>Zhouyi: The Book of Changes: A\nBronze Age Document Translated with Introduction and Notes by Richard\nRutt</em>, (Durham East-Asia Series, 1), Richmond, Surrey:\nCurzon.", "Redmond, Geoffrey (trans.), 2017, <em>The <span class=\"plain\">I\nChing</span> (Book of Changes): A Critical Translation of the Ancient\nText</em>, London: Bloomsbury.", "Wang Bi \u738b\u5f3c [226\u2013249], 1980, <em>Wang Bi ji\njiaoshi</em> \u738b\u5f3c\u96c6\u6821\u91cb (A Collection of\nWritings by Wang Bi, Annotated and Explicated), Lou Yulie\n\u6a13\u5b87\u70c8 (ed.), Beijing: Zhonghua shuju.", "WB67, 1967,<em>The I Ching or Book of Changes: The Richard Wilhelm\ntranslation rendered into English by Cary F.
