    "main_text": "Propositions in themselves || Forms of propositions\n3.1 Forms of propositions\n\nIn Bolzano\u2019s view, propositions can be expressed more or less\nadequately by sentences, and consideration of linguistic structures\naccordingly informs his treatment of the parts and structures of\npropositions. Consider a sentence such as \u2018Romeo loves\nJuliet\u2019, for instance. We recognize that we could replace\n\u2018Romeo\u2019 with another proper name such as\n\u2018Othello\u2019 and still have a perfectly grammatical sentence.\nMoreover, given a set of proper names, we can specify a class of\nsentences that differ from \u2018Romeo loves Juliet\u2019 at most by\nhaving a different one of those names at the beginning. We could\nproceed similarly with \u2018loves\u2019 and a suitable set of\ntransitive verbs. Or we could consider the class of sentences\nobtainable when both sorts of replacements are permitted, and so on.\nThese classes of sentences would correspond to the sentential\nforms \u2018a loves Juliet\u2019, \u2018Romeo V\nJuliet\u2019, and \u2018a V Juliet\u2019, respectively.\n\nSo too, Bolzano clearly thinks, with propositions in themselves. Given\na proposition, we can think of others just like it except for having\ndifferent parts (ideas) at certain places. And though there can be no\nactual variation, i.e., no change in time, in the realm of\npropositions in themselves, nor any places strictly speaking, we can\nnonetheless speak metaphorically of making substitutions at certain\nplaces within propositions, using this as a fa\u00e7on de\nparler about atemporal relations between propositions and their\nparts. Given a proposition, then, we can consider certain of its parts\nvariable, i.e., subject to replacement by other parts, and,\ngiven classes of suitable substituends for each site of substitution,\nwe can again determine a class of propositions.\n\nIf certain parts of a sentence correspond to parts of the proposition\nit expresses, the sentential forms we obtain by replacing one or more\nof these parts with signs for variables, along with a specification of\npermissible substituends, will determine not just a class of sentences\nbut also a class of propositions of the kind just described. Bolzano\nsometimes calls such classes of propositions propositional\nforms. Strictly speaking, however, he reserves this term for the\nsentential forms that determine such classes:\n\n\n[T]he proposition \u201cSome people have white skin\u201d occurs in\nlogic at best as an example, and not as the subject of a theorem,\nwhile a class of propositions, such as the class determined by the\nexpression \u201cSome A are B\u201d may well be the\nsubject of a theorem. If these classes of propositions are to be\ncalled general forms of propositions, then it is permissible\nto say that logic is concerned with forms rather than with individual\npropositions. (Actually, only the written or oral expression\n\u201cSome A are B\u201d, and not the class itself,\nshould be called a form) (TS, \u00a712, no. 2 [I.48]). \n\n\nNote that a sentence need not be perfectly distinct (i.e., such that\nthere is a one-to-one structure-preserving correspondence between its\nparts and the parts of the proposition is expresses) to be used in\nthis way, provided only that the parts of the sentence that are\nreplaced by signs for variables do correspond to parts of the\nproposition. For instance, if we are satisfied that\n\u2018mammal\u2019 and \u2018bear\u2019 correspond to parts of the\nproposition [Some mammal is a bear], we can use the sentential form\n\u2018Some A is a B\u2019 to determine a class of propositions, even\nif it turns out that this proposition might be more distinctly\nexpressed by a different sentence, e.g., by \u2018There exists an\nindividual that is a mammal and that is also a bear.\u2019\n\nSince different parts of a proposition may be considered variable,\neach proposition belongs to a number of different forms. In\nparticular, there is no absolute distinction between the form and\nmatter of propositions on Bolzano\u2019s definition.\n",
