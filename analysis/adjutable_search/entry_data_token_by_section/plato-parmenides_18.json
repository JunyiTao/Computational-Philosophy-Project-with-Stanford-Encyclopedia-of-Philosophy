Within D6, there are four Arguments with the\nfollowing Conclusions: If the one is not, then the one in no way is\n(D6A1C1), the one in no way partakes of being (D6A1C2), the one in no\nway comes to be (D6A2C1), the one in no way ceases to be (D6A2C2), the\none is not altered in any way (D6A2C3), the one is not in motion\n(D6A2C4), the one is not at rest (D6A2C5), the one does not partake of\nthe small (D6A3C1), the one does not partake of the large (D6A3C2),\nthe one does not partake of the equal (D6A3C3), the one does not\npartake of the like (D6A3C4), the one does not partake of the\ndifferent (D6A3C5), the others are not like the one (D6A4C1), the\nothers are not unlike the one (D6A4C2), the others are not the same as\nthe one (D6A4C3), the others are not different from the one (D6A4C4),\nnone of the following (namely, of that,\nto that, something, this, of this,\nof another, to another, time past, time future, time\npresent, knowledge, perception, opinion, account, and name) is\napplicable to the one (D6A4C5), and the one is in no state at all\n(D6A4C6).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D6 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The\nexceptions are D6A1C1 and D6A4C5, which do not depend on any previously\nestablished Conclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007,\n223\u2013228).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D6 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first five Deductions, the Arguments of D6 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D5 (but not D1,\nD2, D3, D4, or the Appendix). Again, it appears that most of the\npremises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of view, either\ndefinitionally true or just plain obvious. Thus it appears that,\nfrom Plato\u2019s point of view, D6 establishes, without reliance on\nPurity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption, that if the\none is not, then the one has neither of a host of contrary\nproperties.\n\n\nWhen combined with the results of D5, this result entails that the one\nis. To see this, consider the following. D5 establishes that if the\none is not, then the one is both F and con-F; and D6\nestablishes that if the one is not, then the one is neither F nor\ncon-F. So if both D5 and D6 are valid and based on acceptable\npremises, then D5 and D6 together establish that if the one is not,\nthen the one has contradictory properties. Given that it is\nimpossible for something to have contradictory properties, it\nis a direct consequence of the conjunction of D5 and D6 that it is not\nthe case that the one is not. That is to say, D5 and D6 together\nentail that the one is.\n\n\nThis is a significant result, for two reasons. First, it\nreinforces the earlier result obtained from the conjunction of D1, D2,\nand D5 (and from the conjunction of D3, D4, and D5), namely that\nPurity-F is false. For D1 and D2 (as well as D3 and D4) together\nentail that if the one is, then Purity-F is false. But D6\nestablishes that the one is. It then follows directly by modus\nponens that Purity-F is false. Second, the result that the one is\ncan be generalized to establish the being of any form whatever.\nThe reason is that none of the reasoning in the Deductions up to this\npoint depends on the one\u2019s having been chosen as the main subject\nof the Deductions. Every Argument of D1\u2013D6 would go through if\nsome other form were substituted for the one as the main topic of\ndiscussion. Earlier, Parmenides had said that \u201conly a very\ngifted man can come to know that for each thing there is some kind, a\nbeing itself by itself\u201d (135a\u2013b). So he has now revealed\nhimself to be the \u201cvery gifted man\u201d of whom he had\nspoken.\n",
