    "main_text": "Axiology/Value Theory || A Functional View of Values\n2.2 A Functional View of Values\n\nOn Locke's view, though the value-mode is determined immediately by\nthe affective character of the value, this is not the final\ndetermination of the value. Even after the value-mode has been\nascertained, the legitimacy of the value may still be in question, its\nplace in the overall value scheme may be unclear, and particular\naspects of the context of valuation may be uncertain. This leads Locke\nto conclude that the primary normative character of value norms is\nbest sought in their functional role as stereotypes of feeling\nattitudes and as habitual impulses toward certain choices of actions.\nThis would make them culturally specific, as well as temporally and\ngeographically contingent as values can only be habituated and\nfunction with any degree of reliability in specific contexts.\nMoreover, as in the case of apprehending value-modes, the\nfunctionality of a given value is to be discovered experientially;\nrather than, postulated a priori. Values, then, would only\nbecome absolutes\u2014should they become absolute at\nall\u2014because reason and judgment secondarily re-enforce them as\nsuch. In their immediate character and quality values are affective,\nbut they are further mediated by reason and judgment. Value\npredication depends on reason and judgment; but the predicates\nthemselves are determined by the modal quality of the value. So, the\njudgment that an object is beautiful or ugly involves reason and\njudgment, but that the object is experienced as aesthetic depends on\nits affective apprehension; its being experienced aesthetically. \n\nCommenting on his own preference for a functional theory of value\nLocke writes:\n\nI confess at the outset to a preference for a functional theory of\nvalue, but my brief for a functional analysis of value norms is not\ncompletely parti pris, but is made rather because a\nfunctional approach, even should it lead to a non-functionalist theory\nof value, of necessity treats the value varieties in terms of their\ninterrelationships, guaranteeing a comparative approach and a more\nrealistic type of value analysis. (FVVU 81)\n\n\nMoreover, a functional account of value has the theoretical advantages\nof being able to account for parallels between values, value\ninterchangeability, and transvaluation. It is perhaps in taking a\nfunctional view of values and their associated imperatives where\nLocke's theory of value is most pragmatic. A functional view of values\nemphasizes the fact that values are an essential feature of our\nlived-experiences. At its most basic level value functionality aims to\nprovide a way of understanding how particular values operate as\ncoordinating mechanisms for individual and collective action. Some\nvalues have a specific social role; a societal aim or goal that they\nhave been modified and adapted over time to help achieve or maintain.\nSuch values are often codified in the customs and traditions of a\nculture and can sometimes remain ritualized long after their\nfunctional role is obsolete. The importance and usefulness of a\nfunctional view of values in Locke's social and political philosophy\nis further explored in\n section 3.2\n below.\n",
