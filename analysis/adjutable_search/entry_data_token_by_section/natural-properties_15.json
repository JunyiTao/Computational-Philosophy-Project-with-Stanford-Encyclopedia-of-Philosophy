    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Laws of nature\n4.6 Laws of nature\n\nOne of Lewis\u2019s signature applications of the notion of\nnaturalness is in the analysis of the notion of a law of\nnature, a notion of great importance for the philosophy of\nscience and for the theory of causation and counterfactuals. In brief,\nLewis\u2019s proposal is that it is a law of nature that \\(P\\) just\nin case the proposition that \\(P\\) belongs to every \u201cbest\nsystem\u201d, where a system is a set of true propositions closed\nunder necessitation, and the \u201cgoodness\u201d of a system is a\ncombination of two factors: simplicity and\n strength.[43]\n The relevant notion of simplicity can, according to Lewis, be\nunderstood in terms of\n naturalness.[44]\n The idea is that the simplicity of a system is a matter of the\nsyntactic simplicity of the its simplest axiomatisation,\nwhere an axiomatisation of a system is a set of sentences which\nexpress propositions which jointly entail exactly the propositions in\nthe system, on some interpretation where their non-logical constants\nall stand for perfectly natural\n properties.[45]\n\n\nNote that, given that Lewis also analyses relative naturalness in\nterms of perfect naturalness and syntactic simplicity, he could just\nas well have identified the degree of simplicity of a system with the\ndegree of naturalness of the strongest proposition in the system\n(i.e.\u00a0the conjunction of all the elements of the system). This\nversion of the account may be preferable to those who reject the\nprogram of analysing relative naturalness in terms of perfect\nnaturalness.\n\nFor discussion of the motivations for this \u201cbest system\u201d\nanalysis and its discontents, see the entry on\n laws of nature.\n Especially noteworthy here are objections which specifically target\nthe role of naturalness in the analysis. The most prominent\nsuch objection (van Fraassen\n 1989;\n Loewer\n (2007);\n Cohen and Callender\n 2009)\n is that the account will make it impossible to know what the laws\nare, because it will allow for the possibility that even scientists\nwho arrive at true theories by impeccable reasoning nevertheless\ngo wrong in taking the axioms of these theories to be laws,\nbecause they are mistaken in thinking that the properties expressed by the\nbasic predicates of these theories are highly natural. This is a hard\nobjection to make stick, since the form of inference involved \u2014\nfrom the possibility of error about some question to the conclusion\nthat we are not in a position to know the answer to that question\n\u2014 leads, when generalized, to a rampant scepticism.\nNon-sceptical epistemologists tend to think that possibilities of\nerror need to meet some further condition of \u201ccloseness\u201d\nor \u201crelevance\u201d in order to undermine knowledge; but it is\nunclear why one would think that this condition is met in the present\ncase. As we will see in\n \u00a74.7\n below, natural properties are widely held to be easier to refer to,\nceteris paribus. So, arguably, a situation where people ended up with\ntrue scientific theories stated in a language whose basic predicates\nwere too unnatural for the axioms to meet the bar for lawhood would\nhave to be quite remote and unusual.\n\nIf one rejects not just the details but the general program of\nanalysing lawhood in terms of naturalness, one might instead consider\nan analysis of naturalness in terms of lawhood: \u201cnatural\nproperties are the ones that figure in laws of nature\u201d (Lewis\n 1983,\n 344). (If one is analysing perfect naturalness, one might\nwant to specify that the laws should be \u201cbasic\u201d rather\nthan \u201cderived\u201d.) A central challenge for working out this\nprogram is to explain what \u2018figure in\u2019 means. To get\nanything like the desired extension for \u2018natural\u2019, we need\nan extremely fine-grained theory of propositions. For example, unless\nwe are comfortable with the consequence that being either\nnon-\\(F\\) or \\(G\\) is perfectly natural whenever the proposition\nthat everything \\(F\\) is \\(G\\) is a law, we will need to deny that\nthat property \u201cfigures in\u201d that proposition. This will\nplausibly require denying that the property is identical to the\nproposition that everything is either non-\\(F\\) or \\(G\\), and denying\nthat the latter proposition is a law despite its necessary equivalence\nto the former. As we will see in\n \u00a74.10\n below, there are formidable obstacles to developing a consistent\ntheory of properties and propositions that is fine-grained in the\nneeded\n ways.[46]\n The thesis that only perfectly natural properties \u201cfigure\nin\u201d (basic) laws of nature also faces other objections. For\nexample, Hicks and Schaffer\n (2017)\n argue against it on the grounds that, for example, acceleration\nfigures in a basic law, namely \\(F=ma\\), but is not perfectly\n natural.[47]\n\n",
