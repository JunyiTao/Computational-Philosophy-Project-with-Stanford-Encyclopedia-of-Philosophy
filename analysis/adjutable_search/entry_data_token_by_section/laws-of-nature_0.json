    "main_text": "The Basic Question: What is it to be a Law?\n1. The Basic Question: What is it to be a Law?\n\nHere are four reasons philosophers examine what it is to be a law of\nnature: First, as indicated above, laws at least appear to have a\ncentral role in scientific practice. Second, laws are important to\nmany other philosophical issues. For example, sparked by the account\nof counterfactuals defended by Chisholm (1946, 1955) and Goodman\n(1947), and also prompted by Hempel and Oppenheim\u2019s (1948)\ndeductive-nomological model of explanation, philosophers have wondered\nwhat makes counterfactual and explanatory claims true, have thought\nthat laws play some part, and so also have wondered what distinguishes\nlaws from nonlaws. Third, Goodman famously suggested that there is a\nconnection between lawhood and confirmability by an inductive\ninference. So, some sympathetic to Goodman\u2019s idea come to the\nproblem of laws as a result of their interest in the problem of\ninduction. Fourth, philosophers love a good puzzle. Suppose that\neveryone here is seated (cf., Langford 1941, 67). Then, trivially,\nthat everyone here is seated is true. Though true, this generalization\ndoes not seem to be a law. It is just too accidental. Einstein\u2019s\nprinciple that no signals travel faster than light is also a true\ngeneralization but, in contrast, it is thought to be a law; it is not\nnearly so accidental. What makes the difference?\n\nThis may not seem like much of a puzzle. That everyone here is seated\nis spatially restricted in that it is about a specific place; the\nprinciple of relativity is not similarly restricted. So, it is easy to\nthink that, unlike laws, accidentally true generalizations are about\nspecific places. But that is not what makes the difference. There are\ntrue nonlaws that are not spatially restricted. Consider the\nunrestricted generalization that all gold spheres are less than one\nmile in diameter. There are no gold spheres that size and in all\nlikelihood there never will be, but this is still not a law. There\nalso appear to be generalizations that could express laws that are\nrestricted. Galileo\u2019s law of free fall is the generalization\nthat, on Earth, free-falling bodies accelerate at a rate of\n9.8 meters per second squared. The perplexing nature of the puzzle is\nclearly revealed when the gold-sphere generalization is paired with a\nremarkably similar generalization about uranium spheres:\n\nAll gold spheres are less than a mile in diameter.\n\n\nAll uranium spheres are less than a mile in diameter.\n\n\nThough the former is not a law, the latter arguably is. The latter is\nnot nearly so accidental as the first, since uranium\u2019s critical\nmass is such as to guarantee that such a large sphere will never exist\n(van Fraassen 1989, 27). What makes the difference? What makes the\nformer an accidental generalization and the latter a law?\n",
