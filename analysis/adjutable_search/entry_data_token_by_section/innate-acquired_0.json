    "main_text": "Outline of scientific debates over nativism\n1. Outline of scientific debates over nativism\n\nIn human and animal psychology since Darwin there have been a number\nof periods when the innate/acquired distinction was the subject of\nheated scientific controversy. This section reviews some of these\ndebates. It provides a sense of how different scientists have\nconceptualized instinct or innateness, the kinds of evidence\nmarshalled to support nativist hypotheses, and some of the recurring\nobjections that nativist proposals have encountered. In scientific\npsychology the words \u201cinnate\u201d and\n\u201cinstinctive\u201d have been used to refer to the same cluster\nof properties, \u201cinstinct\u201d being a now somewhat antiquated\nterm for an innate psychological trait. Hence, in this section we take\nolder debates over instinct to be about the same set of issues as more\nrecent debates over innateness.\n",
