Systems Closely Related to Mainstream Relevance Logic\n\nThere are some systems that deserve to be called relevant\nthat are not mainstream relevant logic. One such system is Graham\nPriest\u2019s logic N\\(_4\\). The easiest way to present this logic is\nto explain its semantics.\n\nA model for N\\(_4\\) consists in a set of world that is\npartitioned into normal and non-normal worlds. At every world,\nformulas are given one of four truth values, in accordance with Dunn\u2019s\nsemantics explained in section 2 above, with regard to conjunction,\ndisjunction, and negation. But the treatment of implication is rather\ninteresting. At normal worlds, an implication\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\), is true if and only if in every world w,\nif \\(A\\) is true in w, then \\(B\\) is also true in w. The\nimplication is false if there is at least one world in which\n\\(A\\) is true and \\(B\\) is false. At non-normal worlds,\nimplications are made true and false randomly. \n\nN\\(_4\\) is a relevant logic. It has the variable-sharing\nproperty. And it has a very simple and intuitive semantics. It is,\nhowever, a very weak logic. It does not contain any transitivity\naxioms for implication. It has a transitivity rule. It does not\ncontain either the contraposition axiom nor the rule form of\ncontraposition.\n\nAnother very interesting logic is Neil Tennant\u2019s Core Logic. One of\nthe \u201cfallacies\u201d that relevance logic was created to avoid\nis ex falso quodlibet, or explosion \u2013 the inference from a\ncontradiction to any proposition whatsoever. C.I. Lewis justified\nexplosion by means of a little argument. He started with the\npremise \\(p \\amp \\neg p\\). By conjunction elimination he\nderived, \\(p\\), and by disjunction\nintroduction, \\(p\\vee q\\). From the premise, he also\nderived \\(\\neg p\\), by conjunction elimination. Thus, he\nhad \\(p\\vee q\\) and \\(\\neg p\\). From these, by\ndisjunctive syllogism, Lewis derived \\(q\\). Mainstream relevance\nlogicians block this argument by rejecting disjunctive syllogism. The\nrejection of disjunctive syllogism, however, has become one of the\nmost controversial aspects of relevance logic.\n\n\nTennant\u2019s core logic, however, accepts disjunctive syllogism. It also\naccepts conjunction elimination and disjunction introduction. In fact,\nCore Logic supports all the standard primitive rules that we find in\nthe proof theory of \n intuitionist logic. Thus, one could say\nthat the meanings of the connectives in Core logic are just their\nmeanings in intuitionist logic. What is different is its treatment of\none of the structural rules of proof -- it rejects the transitivity of\nlogical consequence in its most general form. \n\nYet another logical system that is closely related to relevance logic\nis William Parry\u2019s logic of Analytic Implication. Analytic Implication\nis motivated by the desire to satisfy a very strong form of\nvariable-sharing. No implication \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) is\nprovable in this logic unless \\(\\mathbf{all}\\) the variables in \\(B\\)\nare contained in \\(A\\). In order to satisfy this strong\nvariable-sharing principle, the principle of disjunction introduction\nneeds to be restricted. So, instead of having\n\\(A\\rightarrow(A\\vee B)\\) as a theorem for all\nformulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), this schema is valid only when all\nthe propositional variables in \\(B\\) are also in \\(A\\). The\nprinciple of contraposition and some transitivity principles for\nimplication also have to be restricted. \n\nAnalytic Implication has been given an elegant possible worlds\nsemantics by Kit Fine. Fine adds to a possible worlds model a domain\nof subject matters. An implication holds at a world if and only if it\nboth preserves truth at all accessible worlds and also every subject\nmatter of the consequent is also a subject matter of the antecedent\n(Fine 1986).\n\nFor a comparison of Analytic Implication and relevance logic, see\nRoutley, et al., 1982, pages 96\u2013101. For a detailed examination and\ndefense of Analytic Implication, see Ferguson (2017).\n",
