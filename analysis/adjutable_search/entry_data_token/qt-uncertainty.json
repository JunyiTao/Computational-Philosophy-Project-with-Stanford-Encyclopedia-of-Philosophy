Introduction\n\nThe uncertainty principle is certainly one of the most famous aspects\nof quantum mechanics. It has often been regarded as the most\ndistinctive feature in which quantum mechanics differs from classical\ntheories of the physical world. Roughly speaking, the uncertainty\nprinciple (for position and momentum) states that one cannot assign\nexact simultaneous values to the position and momentum of a physical\nsystem. Rather, these quantities can only be determined with some\ncharacteristic \u201cuncertainties\u201d that cannot become\narbitrarily small simultaneously. But what is the exact meaning of\nthis principle, and indeed, is it really a principle of quantum\nmechanics? (In his original work, Heisenberg only speaks of\nuncertainty relations.) And, in particular, what does it mean to say\nthat a quantity is determined only up to some uncertainty? These are\nthe main questions we will explore in the following, focusing on the\nviews of Heisenberg and Bohr.\n\nThe notion of \u201cuncertainty\u201d occurs in several different\nmeanings in the physical literature. It may refer to a lack of\nknowledge of a quantity by an observer, or to the experimental\ninaccuracy with which a quantity is measured, or to some ambiguity in\nthe definition of a quantity, or to a statistical spread in an\nensemble of similarly prepared systems. Also, several different names\nare used for such uncertainties: inaccuracy, spread, imprecision,\nindefiniteness, indeterminateness, indeterminacy, latitude, etc. As we\nshall see, even Heisenberg and Bohr did not decide on a single\nterminology for quantum mechanical uncertainties. Forestalling a\ndiscussion about which name is the most appropriate one in quantum\nmechanics, we use the name \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d simply\nbecause it is the most common one in the literature.\n2. Heisenberg\n2.1 Heisenberg\u2019s road to the uncertainty relations\n\nHeisenberg introduced his famous relations in an article of 1927,\nentitled Ueber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen\nKinematik und Mechanik. A (partial) translation of this title is:\n\u201cOn the anschaulich content of quantum theoretical\nkinematics and mechanics\u201d. Here, the term anschaulich\nis particularly notable. Apparently, it is one of those German words\nthat defy an unambiguous translation into other languages.\nHeisenberg\u2019s title is translated as \u201cOn the physical\ncontent \u2026\u201d by Wheeler and Zurek (1983). His\ncollected works (Heisenberg 1984) translate it as \u201cOn the\nperceptible content \u2026\u201d, while Cassidy\u2019s\nbiography of Heisenberg (Cassidy 1992), refers to the paper as\n\u201cOn the perceptual content \u2026\u201d. Literally,\nthe closest translation of the term anschaulich is\n\u201cvisualizable\u201d. But, as in most languages, words that make\nreference to vision are not always intended literally. Seeing is\nwidely used as a metaphor for understanding, especially for immediate\nunderstanding. Hence, anschaulich also means\n\u201cintelligible\u201d or\n \u201cintuitive\u201d.[1]\n\n\nWhy was this issue of the Anschaulichkeit of quantum\nmechanics such a prominent concern to Heisenberg? This question has\nalready been considered by a number of commentators (Jammer 1974;\nMiller 1982; de Regt 1997; Beller 1999). For the answer, it turns out,\nwe must go back a little in time. In 1925 Heisenberg had developed the\nfirst coherent mathematical formalism for quantum theory (Heisenberg\n1925). His leading idea was that only those quantities that are in\nprinciple observable should play a role in the theory, and that all\nattempts to form a picture of what goes on inside the atom should be\navoided. In atomic physics the observational data were obtained from\nspectroscopy and associated with atomic transitions. Thus, Heisenberg\nwas led to consider the \u201ctransition quantities\u201d as the\nbasic ingredients of the theory. Max Born, later that year, realized\nthat the transition quantities obeyed the rules of matrix calculus, a\nbranch of mathematics that was not so well-known then as it is now. In\na famous series of papers Heisenberg, Born and Jordan developed this\nidea into the matrix mechanics version of quantum theory.\n\nFormally, matrix mechanics remains close to classical mechanics. The\ncentral idea is that all physical quantities must be represented by\ninfinite self-adjoint matrices (later identified with operators on a\nHilbert space). It is postulated that the matrices \\(\\bQ\\)\nand \\(\\bP\\) representing the canonical position and\nmomentum variables of a particle satisfy the so-called canonical\ncommutation rule\n\n\\[\\tag{1} \n\\bQ\\bP - \\bP\\bQ = i\\hslash\\]\n\n\n where \\(\\hslash = h/2\\pi\\), \\(h\\) denotes\nPlanck\u2019s constant, and boldface type is used to represent\nmatrices (or operators). The new theory scored spectacular empirical\nsuccess by encompassing nearly all spectroscopic data known at the\ntime, especially after the concept of the electron spin was included\nin the theoretical framework.\n\nIt came as a big surprise, therefore, when one year later, Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger presented an alternative theory, that became known as\nwave mechanics. Schr\u00f6dinger assumed that an electron in an atom\ncould be represented as an oscillating charge cloud, evolving\ncontinuously in space and time according to a wave equation. The\ndiscrete frequencies in the atomic spectra were not due to\ndiscontinuous transitions (quantum jumps) as in matrix mechanics, but\nto a resonance phenomenon. Schr\u00f6dinger also showed that the two\ntheories were equivalent.[2]\n\n\nEven so, the two approaches differed greatly in interpretation and\nspirit. Whereas Heisenberg eschewed the use of visualizable pictures,\nand accepted discontinuous transitions as a primitive notion,\nSchr\u00f6dinger claimed as an advantage of his theory that it was\nanschaulich. In Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s vocabulary, this\nmeant that the theory represented the observational data by means of\ncontinuously evolving causal processes in space and time. He\nconsidered this condition of Anschaulichkeit to be an\nessential requirement on any acceptable physical theory.\nSchr\u00f6dinger was not alone in appreciating this aspect of his\ntheory. Many other leading physicists were attracted to wave mechanics\nfor the same reason. For a while, in 1926, before it emerged that wave\nmechanics had serious problems of its own, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\napproach seemed to gather more support in the physics community than\nmatrix mechanics.\n\nUnderstandably, Heisenberg was unhappy about this development. In a\nletter of 8 June 1926 to Pauli he confessed that \u201cThe more I\nthink about the physical part of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s theory, the\nmore disgusting I find it\u201d, and: \u201cWhat Schr\u00f6dinger\nwrites about the Anschaulichkeit of his theory, \u2026 I\nconsider Mist\u201d (Pauli 1979: 328). Again, this last\nGerman term is translated differently by various commentators: as\n\u201cjunk\u201d (Miller 1982) \u201crubbish\u201d (Beller 1999)\n\u201ccrap\u201d (Cassidy 1992), \u201cpoppycock\u201d\n(Bacciagaluppi & Valentini 2009) and perhaps more literally, as\n\u201cbullshit\u201d (Moore 1989; de Regt 1997). Nevertheless, in\npublished writings, Heisenberg voiced a more balanced opinion. In a\npaper in Die Naturwissenschaften (1926) he summarized the\npeculiar situation that the simultaneous development of two competing\ntheories had brought about. Although he argued that\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s interpretation was untenable, he admitted\nthat matrix mechanics did not provide the Anschaulichkeit\nwhich made wave mechanics so attractive. He concluded: \n\n\nto obtain a contradiction-free anschaulich interpretation, we\nstill lack some essential feature in our image of the structure of\nmatter. \n\n\nThe purpose of his 1927 paper was to provide exactly this lacking\nfeature.\n2.2 Heisenberg\u2019s argument\n\nLet us now look at the argument that led Heisenberg to his uncertainty\nrelations. He started by redefining the notion of\nAnschaulichkeit. Whereas Schr\u00f6dinger associated this\nterm with the provision of a causal space-time picture of the\nphenomena, Heisenberg, by contrast, declared:\n\n\nWe believe we have gained anschaulich understanding of a\nphysical theory, if in all simple cases, we can grasp the experimental\nconsequences qualitatively and see that the theory does not lead to\nany contradictions. Heisenberg 1927: 172)\n\n\nHis goal was, of course, to show that, in this new sense of the word,\nmatrix mechanics could lay the same claim to Anschaulichkeit\nas wave mechanics.\n\nTo do this, he adopted an operational assumption: terms like\n\u201cthe position of a particle\u201d have meaning only if one\nspecifies a suitable experiment by which \u201cthe position of a\nparticle\u201d can be measured. We will call this assumption the\n\u201cmeasurement=meaning principle\u201d. In general, there is no\nlack of such experiments, even in the domain of atomic physics.\nHowever, experiments are never completely accurate. We should be\nprepared to accept, therefore, that in general the meaning of these\nquantities is also determined only up to some characteristic\ninaccuracy.\n\nAs an example, he considered the measurement of the position of an\nelectron by a microscope. The accuracy of such a measurement is\nlimited by the wave length of the light illuminating the electron.\nThus, it is possible, in principle, to make such a position\nmeasurement as accurate as one wishes, by using light of a very short\nwave length, e.g., \\(\\gamma\\)-rays. But for \\(\\gamma\\)-rays, the\nCompton effect cannot be ignored: the interaction of the electron and\nthe illuminating light should then be considered as a collision of at\nleast one photon with the electron. In such a collision, the electron\nsuffers a recoil which disturbs its momentum. Moreover, the shorter\nthe wave length, the larger is this change in momentum. Thus, at the\nmoment when the position of the particle is accurately known,\nHeisenberg argued, its momentum cannot be accurately known:\n\n\nAt the instant of time when the position is determined, that is, at\nthe instant when the photon is scattered by the electron, the electron\nundergoes a discontinuous change in momentum. This change is the\ngreater the smaller the wavelength of the light employed, i.e., the\nmore exact the determination of the position. At the instant at which\nthe position of the electron is known, its momentum therefore can be\nknown only up to magnitudes which correspond to that discontinuous\nchange; thus, the more precisely the position is determined, the less\nprecisely the momentum is known, and conversely. (Heisenberg 1927:\n174\u20135)\n\n\nThis is the first formulation of the uncertainty principle. In its\npresent form it is an epistemological principle, since it limits what\nwe can know about the electron. From \u201celementary\nformulae of the Compton effect\u201d Heisenberg estimated the\n\u201cimprecisions\u201d to be of the order \n\n\\[\\tag{2} \\delta p\\delta q \\sim h\\]\n\n\nHe continued: \u201cIn this circumstance we see the direct\nanschaulich content of the relation \\(\\boldsymbol{QP} -\n\\boldsymbol{PQ} = i\\hslash\\).\u201d\n\nHe went on to consider other experiments, designed to measure other\nphysical quantities and obtained analogous relations for time and\nenergy: \n\n\\[\\tag{3} \\delta t \\delta E \\sim h\\]\n\n and action \\(J\\) and angle \\(w\\) \n\n\\[\\tag{4} \\delta w \\delta J \\sim h\\]\n\n which\nhe saw as corresponding to the \u201cwell-known\u201d relations\n\n\\[\\tag{5} \n\\boldsymbol{tE} - \\boldsymbol{Et} = \n i\\hslash \\text{ or } \\boldsymbol{wJ} - \\boldsymbol{Jw} = i\\hslash\\]\n\n\nHowever, these generalisations are not as straightforward as\nHeisenberg suggested. In particular, the status of the time variable\nin his several illustrations of relation\n (3)\n is not at all clear (Hilgevoord 2005; see also\n Section 2.5).\n\nHeisenberg summarized his findings in a general conclusion: all\nconcepts used in classical mechanics are also well-defined in the\nrealm of atomic processes. But, as a pure fact of experience (rein\nerfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df), experiments that serve to provide\nsuch a definition for one quantity are subject to particular\nindeterminacies, obeying relations\n (2)\u2013(4)\n which prohibit them from providing a simultaneous definition of two\ncanonically conjugate quantities. Note that in this formulation the\nemphasis has slightly shifted: he now speaks of a limit on the\ndefinition of concepts, i.e., not merely on what we can know,\nbut what we can meaningfully say about a particle. Of course,\nthis stronger formulation follows by application of the above\nmeasurement=meaning principle: if there are, as Heisenberg claims, no\nexperiments that allow a simultaneous precise measurement of two\nconjugate quantities, then these quantities are also not\nsimultaneously well-defined.\n\nHeisenberg\u2019s paper has an interesting \u201cAddition in\nproof\u201d mentioning critical remarks by Bohr, who saw the paper\nonly after it had been sent to the publisher. Among other things, Bohr\npointed out that in the microscope experiment it is not the change of\nthe momentum of the electron that is important, but rather the\ncircumstance that this change cannot be precisely determined in the\nsame experiment. An improved version of the argument,\nresponding to this objection, is given in Heisenberg\u2019s Chicago\nlectures of 1930.\n\nHere (Heisenberg 1930: 16), it is assumed that the electron is\nilluminated by light of wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) and that the scattered\nlight enters a microscope with aperture angle \\(\\varepsilon\\).\nAccording to the laws of classical optics, the accuracy of the\nmicroscope depends on both the wave length and the aperture angle;\nAbbe\u2019s criterium for its \u201cresolving power\u201d, i.e.,\nthe size of the smallest discernable details, gives \n\n\n\\[\\tag{6} \n\\delta q \\sim \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin \\varepsilon}.\\]\n\n\nOn the other hand, the direction of a scattered photon, when it enters\nthe microscope, is unknown within the angle \\(\\varepsilon\\), rendering\nthe momentum change of the electron uncertain by an amount \n\n\\[\\tag{7} \n\\delta p \\sim \\frac{h \\sin \\varepsilon}{\\lambda}\\]\n\nleading again to the result\n (2).\n\nLet us now analyse Heisenberg\u2019s argument in more detail. Note\nthat, even in this improved version, Heisenberg\u2019s argument is\nincomplete. According to Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cmeasurement=meaning\nprinciple\u201d, one must also specify, in the given context, what\nthe meaning is of the phrase \u201cmomentum of the electron\u201d,\nin order to make sense of the claim that this momentum is changed by\nthe position measurement. A solution to this problem can again be\nfound in the Chicago lectures (Heisenberg 1930: 15). Here, he assumes\nthat initially the momentum of the electron is precisely known, e.g.,\nit has been measured in a previous experiment with an inaccuracy\n\\(\\delta p_{i}\\), which may be arbitrarily small. Then, its position\nis measured with inaccuracy \\(\\delta q\\), and after this, its final\nmomentum is measured with an inaccuracy \\(\\delta p_{f}\\). All three\nmeasurements can be performed with arbitrary precision. Thus, the\nthree quantities \\(\\delta p_{i}, \\delta q\\), and \\(\\delta p_{f}\\) can\nbe made as small as one wishes. If we assume further that the initial\nmomentum has not changed until the position measurement, we can speak\nof a definite momentum until the time of the position measurement.\nMoreover we can give operational meaning to the idea that the momentum\nis changed during the position measurement: the outcome of the second\nmomentum measurement (say \\(p_{f}\\) will generally differ from the\ninitial value \\(p_{i}\\). In fact, one can also show that this change\nis discontinuous, by varying the time between the three\nmeasurements.\n\nLet us try to see, adopting this more elaborate set-up, if we can\ncomplete Heisenberg\u2019s argument. We have now been able to give\nempirical meaning to the \u201cchange of momentum\u201d of the\nelectron, \\(p_{f} - p_{i}\\). Heisenberg\u2019s argument claims that\nthe order of magnitude of this change is at least inversely\nproportional to the inaccuracy of the position measurement:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{8} \\abs{p_{f} - p_{i}} \\delta q \\sim h\\]\n\n\nHowever, can we now draw the conclusion that the momentum is only\nimprecisely defined? Certainly not. Before the position measurement,\nits value was \\(p_{i}\\), after the measurement it is \\(p_{f}\\). One\nmight, perhaps, claim that the value at the very instant of the\nposition measurement is not yet defined, but we could simply settle\nthis by a convention, e.g., we might assign the mean value \\((p_{i} +\np_{f})/2\\) to the momentum at this instant. But then, the momentum is\nprecisely determined at all instants, and Heisenberg\u2019s\nformulation of the uncertainty principle no longer follows. The above\nattempt of completing Heisenberg\u2019s argument thus overshoots its\nmark.\n\nA solution to this problem can again be found in the Chicago Lectures.\nHeisenberg admits that position and momentum can be known exactly. He\nwrites:\n\n\nIf the velocity of the electron is at first known, and the position\nthen exactly measured, the position of the electron for times previous\nto the position measurement may be calculated. For these past times,\n\\(\\delta p\\delta q\\) is smaller than the usual bound. (Heisenberg\n1930: 15)\n\n\nIndeed, Heisenberg says: \u201cthe uncertainty relation does not hold\nfor the past\u201d.\n\nApparently, when Heisenberg refers to the uncertainty or imprecision\nof a quantity, he means that the value of this quantity cannot be\ngiven beforehand. In the sequence of measurements we have\nconsidered above, the uncertainty in the momentum after the\nmeasurement of position has occurred, refers to the idea that the\nvalue of the momentum is not fixed just before the final\nmomentum measurement takes place. Once this measurement is performed,\nand reveals a value \\(p_{f}\\), the uncertainty relation no longer\nholds; these values then belong to the past. Clearly, then, Heisenberg\nis concerned with unpredictability: the point is not that the\nmomentum of a particle changes, due to a position measurement, but\nrather that it changes by an unpredictable amount. It is, however\nalways possible to measure, and hence define, the size of this change\nin a subsequent measurement of the final momentum with arbitrary\nprecision.\n\nAlthough Heisenberg admits that we can consistently attribute values\nof momentum and position to an electron in the past, he sees little\nmerit in such talk. He points out that these values can never be used\nas initial conditions in a prediction about the future behavior of the\nelectron, or subjected to experimental verification. Whether or not we\ngrant them physical reality is, as he puts it, a matter of personal\ntaste. Heisenberg\u2019s own taste is, of course, to deny their\nphysical reality. For example, he writes, \n\n\nI believe that one can formulate the emergence of the classical\n\u201cpath\u201d of a particle succinctly as follows: the\n\u201cpath\u201d comes into being only because we observe it.\n(Heisenberg 1927: 185) \n\n\nApparently, in his view, a measurement does not only serve to give\nmeaning to a quantity, it creates a particular value for this\nquantity. This may be called the \u201cmeasurement=creation\u201d\nprinciple. It is an ontological principle, for it states what is\nphysically real.\n\nThis then leads to the following picture. First we measure the\nmomentum of the electron very accurately. By \u201cmeasurement=\nmeaning\u201d, this entails that the term \u201cthe momentum of the\nparticle\u201d is now well-defined. Moreover, by the\n\u201cmeasurement=creation\u201d principle, we may say that this\nmomentum is physically real. Next, the position is measured with\ninaccuracy \\(\\delta q\\). At this instant, the position of the particle\nbecomes well-defined and, again, one can regard this as a physically\nreal attribute of the particle. However, the momentum has now changed\nby an amount that is unpredictable by an order of magnitude \n\\(\\abs{p_{f} - p_{i}} \\sim h/\\delta q\\). The meaning and validity of\nthis claim can be verified by a subsequent momentum measurement.\n\nThe question is then what status we shall assign to the momentum of\nthe electron just before its final measurement. Is it real? According\nto Heisenberg it is not. Before the final measurement, the best we can\nattribute to the electron is some unsharp, or fuzzy momentum. These\nterms are meant here in an ontological sense, characterizing a real\nattribute of the electron.\n2.3 The interpretation of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relations\n\nHeisenberg\u2019s relations were soon considered to be a cornerstone\nof the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Just a few\nmonths later, Kennard (1927) already called them the \u201cessential\ncore\u201d of the new theory. Taken together with Heisenberg\u2019s\ncontention that they provide the intuitive content of the theory and\ntheir prominent role in later discussions on the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, a dominant view emerged in which the uncertainty\nrelations were regarded as a fundamental principle of the theory.\n\nThe interpretation of these relations has often been debated. Do\nHeisenberg\u2019s relations express restrictions on the experiments\nwe can perform on quantum systems, and, therefore, restrictions on the\ninformation we can gather about such systems; or do they express\nrestrictions on the meaning of the concepts we use to describe quantum\nsystems? Or else, are they restrictions of an ontological nature,\ni.e., do they assert that a quantum system simply does not possess a\ndefinite value for its position and momentum at the same time? The\ndifference between these interpretations is partly reflected in the\nvarious names by which the relations are known, e.g., as\n\u201cinaccuracy relations\u201d, or: \u201cuncertainty\u201d,\n\u201cindeterminacy\u201d or \u201cunsharpness relations\u201d.\nThe debate between these views has been addressed by many authors, but\nit has never been settled completely. Let it suffice here to make only\ntwo general observations.\n\nFirst, it is clear that in Heisenberg\u2019s own view all the above\nquestions stand or fall together. Indeed, we have seen that he adopted\nan operational \u201cmeasurement=meaning\u201d principle according\nto which the meaningfulness of a physical quantity was equivalent to\nthe existence of an experiment purporting to measure that quantity.\nSimilarly, his \u201cmeasurement=creation\u201d principle allowed\nhim to attribute physical reality to such quantities. Hence,\nHeisenberg\u2019s discussions moved rather freely and quickly from\ntalk about experimental inaccuracies to epistemological or ontological\nissues and back again.\n\nHowever, ontological questions seemed to be of somewhat less interest\nto him. For example, there is a passage (Heisenberg 1927: 197), where\nhe discusses the idea that, behind our observational data, there might\nstill exist a hidden reality in which quantum systems have definite\nvalues for position and momentum, unaffected by the uncertainty\nrelations. He emphatically dismisses this conception as an unfruitful\nand meaningless speculation, because, as he says, the aim of physics\nis only to describe observable data. Similarly, in the Chicago\nLectures, he warns against the fact that the human language permits\nthe utterance of statements which have no empirical content, but\nnevertheless produce a picture in our imagination. He notes, \n\n\nOne should be especially careful in using the words\n\u201creality\u201d, \u201cactually\u201d, etc., since these words\nvery often lead to statements of the type just mentioned. (Heisenberg\n1930: 11) \n\n\nSo, Heisenberg also endorsed an interpretation of his relations as\nrejecting a reality in which particles have simultaneous definite\nvalues for position and momentum.\n\nThe second observation is that although for Heisenberg experimental,\ninformational, epistemological and ontological formulations of his\nrelations were, so to say, just different sides of the same coin, this\nis not so for those who do not share his operational principles or his\nview on the task of physics. Alternative points of view, in which\ne.g., the ontological reading of the uncertainty relations is denied,\nare therefore still viable. The statement, often found in the\nliterature of the thirties, that Heisenberg had proved the\nimpossibility of associating a definite position and momentum to a\nparticle is certainly wrong. But the precise meaning one can\ncoherently attach to Heisenberg\u2019s relations depends rather\nheavily on the interpretation one favors for quantum mechanics as a\nwhole. And because no agreement has been reached on this latter issue,\none cannot expect agreement on the meaning of the uncertainty\nrelations either.\n2.4 Uncertainty relations or uncertainty principle?\n\nLet us now move to another question about Heisenberg\u2019s\nrelations: do they express a principle of quantum theory?\nProbably the first influential author to call these relations a\n\u201cprinciple\u201d was Eddington, who, in his Gifford Lectures of\n1928 referred to them as the \u201cPrinciple of Indeterminacy\u201d.\nIn the English literature the name uncertainty principle became most\ncommon. It is used both by Condon and Robertson in 1929, and also in\nthe English version of Heisenberg\u2019s Chicago Lectures (Heisenberg\n1930), although, remarkably, nowhere in the original German version of\nthe same book (see also Cassidy 1998). Indeed, Heisenberg never seems\nto have endorsed the name \u201cprinciple\u201d for his relations.\nHis favourite terminology was \u201cinaccuracy relations\u201d\n(Ungenauigkeitsrelationen) or \u201cindeterminacy\nrelations\u201d (Unbestimmtheitsrelationen). We know only\none passage, in Heisenberg\u2019s own Gifford lectures, delivered in\n1955\u201356 (Heisenberg 1958: 43), where he mentioned that his\nrelations \u201care usually called relations of uncertainty or\nprinciple of indeterminacy\u201d. But this can well be read as his\nyielding to common practice rather than his own preference.\n\nBut does the relation\n (2)\n qualify as a principle of quantum mechanics? Several authors,\nforemost Karl Popper (1967), have contested this view. Popper argued\nthat the uncertainty relations cannot be granted the status of a\nprinciple on the grounds that they are derivable from the theory,\nwhereas one cannot obtain the theory from the uncertainty relations.\n(The argument being that one can never derive any equation, say, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, or the commutation relation\n (1),\n from an inequality.)\n\nPopper\u2019s argument is, of course, correct but we think it misses\nthe point. There are many statements in physical theories which are\ncalled principles even though they are in fact derivable from other\nstatements in the theory in question. A more appropriate departing\npoint for this issue is not the question of logical priority but\nrather Einstein\u2019s distinction between \u201cconstructive\ntheories\u201d and \u201cprinciple theories\u201d.\n\nEinstein proposed this famous classification in Einstein 1919.\nConstructive theories are theories which postulate the existence of\nsimple entities behind the phenomena. They endeavour to reconstruct\nthe phenomena by framing hypotheses about these entities. Principle\ntheories, on the other hand, start from empirical principles, i.e.,\ngeneral statements of empirical regularities, employing no or only a\nbare minimum of theoretical terms. The purpose is to build up the\ntheory from such principles. That is, one aims to show how these\nempirical principles provide sufficient conditions for the\nintroduction of further theoretical concepts and structure.\n\nThe prime example of a theory of principle is thermodynamics. Here the\nrole of the empirical principles is played by the statements of the\nimpossibility of various kinds of perpetual motion machines. These are\nregarded as expressions of brute empirical fact, providing the\nappropriate conditions for the introduction of the concepts of energy\nand entropy and their properties. (There is a lot to be said about the\ntenability of this view, but that is not our topic here.)\n\nNow obviously, once the formal thermodynamic theory is built, one can\nalso derive the impossibility of the various kinds of\nperpetual motion. (They would violate the laws of energy conservation\nand entropy increase.) But this derivation should not misguide one\ninto thinking that they were no principles of the theory after all.\nThe point is just that empirical principles are statements that do not\nrely on the theoretical concepts (in this case entropy and energy) for\ntheir meaning. They are interpretable independently of these concepts\nand, further, their validity on the empirical level still provides the\nphysical content of the theory.\n\nA similar example is provided by special relativity, another theory of\nprinciple, which Einstein deliberately designed after the ideal of\nthermodynamics. Here, the empirical principles are the light postulate\nand the relativity principle. Again, once we have built up the modern\ntheoretical formalism of the theory (Minkowski space-time), it is\nstraightforward to prove the validity of these principles. But again\nthis does not count as an argument for claiming that they were no\nprinciples after all. So the question whether the term\n\u201cprinciple\u201d is justified for Heisenberg\u2019s relations,\nshould, in our view, be understood as the question whether they are\nconceived of as empirical principles.\n\nOne can easily show that this idea was never far from\nHeisenberg\u2019s intentions. We have already seen that Heisenberg\npresented the relations as the result of a \u201cpure fact of\nexperience\u201d. A few months after his 1927 paper, he wrote a\npopular paper \u201c\u00dcber die Grundprincipien der\nQuantenmechanik\u201d (\u201cOn the fundamental principles of\nquantum mechanics\u201d) where he made the point even more clearly.\nHere Heisenberg described his recent break-through in the\ninterpretation of the theory as follows: \u201cIt seems to be a\ngeneral law of nature that we cannot determine position and velocity\nsimultaneously with arbitrary accuracy\u201d. Now actually, and in\nspite of its title, the paper does not identify or discuss any\n\u201cfundamental principle\u201d of quantum mechanics. So, it must\nhave seemed obvious to his readers that he intended to claim that the\nuncertainty relation was a fundamental principle, forced upon us as an\nempirical law of nature, rather than a result derived from the\nformalism of the theory.\n\nThis reading of Heisenberg\u2019s intentions is corroborated by the\nfact that, even in his 1927 paper, applications of his relation\nfrequently present the conclusion as a matter of principle. For\nexample, he says \u201cIn a stationary state of an atom its phase is\nin principle indeterminate\u201d (Heisenberg 1927: 177,\n[emphasis added]). Similarly, in a paper of 1928, he described the\ncontent of his relations as: \n\n\nIt has turned out that it is in principle impossible to know,\nto measure the position and velocity of a piece of matter with\narbitrary accuracy. (Heisenberg 1984: 26, [emphasis added])\n\n\nSo, although Heisenberg did not originate the tradition of calling his\nrelations a principle, it is not implausible to attribute the view to\nhim that the uncertainty relations represent an empirical principle\nthat could serve as a foundation of quantum mechanics. In fact, his\n1927 paper expressed this desire explicitly: \n\n\nSurely, one would like to be able to deduce the quantitative laws of\nquantum mechanics directly from their anschaulich\nfoundations, that is, essentially, relation\n [(2)].\n (ibid: 196) \n\n\nThis is not to say that Heisenberg was successful in reaching this\ngoal, or that he did not express other opinions on other\noccasions.\n\nLet us conclude this section with three remarks. First, if the\nuncertainty relation is to serve as an empirical principle, one might\nwell ask what its direct empirical support is. In Heisenberg\u2019s\nanalysis, no such support is mentioned. His arguments concerned\nthought experiments in which the validity of the theory, at least at a\nrudimentary level, is implicitly taken for granted. Jammer (1974: 82)\nconducted a literature search for high precision experiments that\ncould seriously test the uncertainty relations and concluded they were\nstill scarce in 1974. Real experimental support for the uncertainty\nrelations in experiments in which the inaccuracies are close to the\nquantum limit have come about only more recently (see Kaiser, Werner,\nand George 1983; Uffink 1985; Nairz, Andt, and Zeilinger 2002).\n\nA second point is the question whether the theoretical structure or\nthe quantitative laws of quantum theory can indeed be derived on the\nbasis of the uncertainty principle, as Heisenberg wished. Serious\nattempts to build up quantum theory as a full-fledged Theory of\nPrinciple on the basis of the uncertainty principle have never been\ncarried out. Indeed, the most Heisenberg could and did claim in this\nrespect was that the uncertainty relations created \u201croom\u201d\n(Heisenberg 1927: 180) or \u201cfreedom\u201d (Heisenberg 1931: 43)\nfor the introduction of some non-classical mode of description of\nexperimental data, not that they uniquely lead to the formalism of\nquantum mechanics. A serious proposal to approach quantum mechanics as\na theory of principle was provided more recently by Bub (2000) and\nChiribella & Spekkens (2016). But, remarkably, this proposal does\nnot use the uncertainty relation as one of its fundamental principles.\nThird, it is remarkable that in his later years Heisenberg put a\nsomewhat different gloss on his relations. In his autobiography\nDer Teil und das Ganze of 1969 he described how he had found\nhis relations inspired by a remark by Einstein that \u201cit is the\ntheory which decides what one can observe\u201d\u2014thus giving\nprecedence to theory above experience, rather than the other way\naround. Some years later he even admitted that his famous discussions\nof thought experiments were actually trivial since \n\n\n\u2026 if the process of observation itself is subject to the laws\nof quantum theory, it must be possible to represent its result in the\nmathematical scheme of this theory. (Heisenberg 1975: 6)\n\n2.5 Mathematical elaboration\n\nWhen Heisenberg introduced his relation, his argument was based only\non qualitative examples. He did not provide a general, exact\nderivation of his\n relations.[3]\n Indeed, he did not even give a definition of the uncertainties\n\\(\\delta q\\), etc., occurring in these relations. Of course, this was\nconsistent with the announced goal of that paper, i.e., to provide\nsome qualitative understanding of quantum mechanics for simple\nexperiments.\n\nThe first mathematically exact formulation of the uncertainty\nrelations is due to Kennard. He proved in 1927 the theorem that for\nall normalized state vectors \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) the following\ninequality holds:\n \n\\[\\tag{9} \n\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bP \\Delta_{\\psi}\\bQ \\ge \\hslash/2 \\]\n\n\nHere, \\(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bP\\) and\n\\(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bQ\\) are standard deviations of position\nand momentum in the state vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), i.e.,\n\n\\[\\tag{10}\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bP)^2 &=   \n  \\expval{\\bP^2}_{\\psi} - \\expval{\\bP}_{\\psi}^2 \\\\\n(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bQ)^2 &=  \n  \\expval{\\bQ^2}_{\\psi} - \\expval{\\bQ}_{\\psi}^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n where \\(\\expval{\\cdot}_{\\psi} = \\expvalexp{\\cdot}{\\psi}\\)\ndenotes the expectation value\nin state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\). Equivalently we can use the wave\nfunction \\(\\psi(q)\\) and its Fourier transform: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{11} \\psi(q) &= \\braket{q}{\\psi} \\\\\n\\notag \\tilde{\\psi}(p) & = \\braket{p}{\\psi} \n   =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\hbar} }\\int \\! \\! dq\\, e^{-ipq/\\hbar} \\psi(q) \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n to write\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n(\\Delta_\\psi {\\bQ})^2 & = \\! \\int\\!\\! dq\\, \\abs{\\psi(q)}^2 q^2 - \n  \\left(\\int \\!\\!dq \\, \\abs{\\psi(q)}^2 q \\right)^2 \\\\ \n(\\Delta_\\psi {\\bP})^2 & = \\! \\int \\!\\!dp \\, \\abs{\\tilde{\\psi}(p)}^2 p^2 - \n  \\left(\\int\\!\\!dp \\, \\abs{\\tilde{\\psi}(p)}^2 p \\right)^2 \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n The inequality\n (9)\n was generalized by Robertson (1929) who proved that for all\nobservables (self-adjoint operators) \\(\\bA\\) and\n\\(\\bB\\): \n\n\\[\\tag{12} \n\\Delta _{\\psi}\\bA \\Delta_{\\psi}\\bB \\ge \n  \\frac{1}{2} \\abs{\\expval{[\\bA,\\bB]}_{\\psi}}\n\\]\n\n where \\([\\bA,\\bB] := \\bA\\bB - \\bB\\bA\\) denotes the commutator.\n\nSince the above inequalities\n (9)\n and\n (12)\n have the virtue of being exact, in contrast to Heisenberg\u2019s\noriginal semi-quantitative formulation, it is tempting to regard them\nas the exact counterpart of Heisenberg\u2019s relations\n (2)\u2013(4).\n Indeed, such was Heisenberg\u2019s own view. In his Chicago Lectures\n(Heisenberg 1930: 15\u201319), he presented Kennard\u2019s\nderivation of relation\n (9)\n and claimed that \u201cthis proof does not differ at all in\nmathematical content\u201d from his semi-quantitative argument, the\nonly difference being that now \u201cthe proof is carried through\nexactly\u201d.\n\nBut it may be useful to point out that both in status and intended\nrole there is a difference between Kennard\u2019s inequality and\nHeisenberg\u2019s previous formulation\n (2).\n The inequalities discussed here are not statements of empirical fact,\nbut theorems of the quantum mechanical formalism. As such, they\npresuppose the validity of this formalism, and in particular the\ncommutation relation\n (1),\n rather than elucidating its intuitive content or to create\n\u201croom\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d for the validity of this\nformalism. At best, one should see the above inequalities as showing\nthat the formalism is consistent with Heisenberg\u2019s empirical\nprinciple.\n\nThis situation is similar to that arising in other theories of\nprinciple where, as noted in\n Section 2.4,\n one often finds that, next to an empirical principle, the formalism\nalso provides a corresponding theorem. And similarly, this situation\nshould not, by itself, cast doubt on the question whether\nHeisenberg\u2019s relation can be regarded as a principle of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nThere is a second notable difference between\n (2)\n and\n (9).\n Heisenberg did not give a general definition for the\n\u201cuncertainties\u201d \\(\\delta p\\) and \\(\\delta q\\). The most\ndefinite remark he made about them was that they could be taken as\n\u201csomething like the mean error\u201d. In the discussions of\nthought experiments, he and Bohr would always quantify uncertainties\non a case-to-case basis by choosing some parameters which happened to\nbe relevant to the experiment at hand. By contrast, the inequalities\n (9)\n and\n (12)\n employ a single specific expression as a measure for\n\u201cuncertainty\u201d: the standard deviation. At the time, this\nchoice was not unnatural, given that this expression is well-known and\nwidely used in error theory and the description of statistical\nfluctuations. However, there was very little or no discussion of\nwhether this choice was appropriate for a general formulation of the\nuncertainty relations. A standard deviation reflects the spread or\nexpected fluctuations in a series of measurements of an observable in\na given state. It is not at all easy to connect this idea with the\nconcept of the \u201cinaccuracy\u201d of a measurement, such as the\nresolving power of a microscope. In fact, even though Heisenberg had\ntaken Kennard\u2019s inequality as the precise formulation of the\nuncertainty relation, he and Bohr never relied on standard deviations\nin their many discussions of thought experiments, and indeed, it has\nbeen shown (Uffink and Hilgevoord 1985; Hilgevoord and Uffink 1988)\nthat these discussions cannot be framed in terms of standard\ndeviations.\n\nAnother problem with the above elaboration is that the\n\u201cwell-known\u201d relations\n (5)\n are actually false if energy \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) and action\n\\(\\boldsymbol{J}\\) are to be positive operators (Jordan 1927). In that\ncase, self-adjoint operators \\(\\boldsymbol{t}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{w}\\)\ndo not exist and inequalities analogous to\n (9)\n cannot be derived. Also, these inequalities do not hold for angle and\nangular momentum (Uffink 1990). These obstacles have led to a quite\nextensive literature on time-energy and angle-action uncertainty\nrelations (Busch 1990; Hilgevoord 1996, 1998, 2005; Muga et al. 2002;\nHilgevoord and Atkinson 2011; Pashby 2015).\n3. Bohr\n\nIn spite of the fact that Heisenberg\u2019s and Bohr\u2019s views on\nquantum mechanics are often lumped together as (part of) \u201cthe\nCopenhagen interpretation\u201d, there is considerable difference\nbetween their views on the uncertainty relations.\n3.1 From wave-particle duality to complementarity\n\nLong before the development of modern quantum mechanics, Bohr had been\nparticularly concerned with the problem of particle-wave duality,\ni.e., the problem that experimental evidence on the behaviour of both\nlight and matter seemed to demand a wave picture in some cases, and a\nparticle picture in others. Yet these pictures are mutually exclusive.\nWhereas a particle is always localized, the very definition of the\nnotions of wavelength and frequency requires an extension in space and\nin time. Moreover, the classical particle picture is incompatible with\nthe characteristic phenomenon of interference.\n\nHis long struggle with wave-particle duality had prepared him for a\nradical step when the dispute between matrix and wave mechanics broke\nout in 1926\u201327. For the main contestants, Heisenberg and\nSchr\u00f6dinger, the issue at stake was which view could claim to\nprovide a single coherent and universal framework for the description\nof the observational data. The choice was, essentially between a\ndescription in terms of continuously evolving waves, or else one of\nparticles undergoing discontinuous quantum jumps. By contrast, Bohr\ninsisted that elements from both views were equally valid and equally\nneeded for an exhaustive description of the data. His way out of the\ncontradiction was to renounce the idea that the pictures refer, in a\nliteral one-to-one correspondence, to physical reality. Instead, the\napplicability of these pictures was to become dependent on the\nexperimental context. This is the gist of the viewpoint he called\n\u201ccomplementarity\u201d.\n\nBohr first conceived the general outline of his complementarity\nargument in early 1927, during a skiing holiday in Norway, at the same\ntime when Heisenberg wrote his uncertainty paper. When he returned to\nCopenhagen and found Heisenberg\u2019s manuscript, they got into an\nintense discussion. On the one hand, Bohr was quite enthusiastic about\nHeisenberg\u2019s ideas which seemed to fit wonderfully with his own\nthinking. Indeed, in his subsequent work, Bohr always presented the\nuncertainty relations as the symbolic expression of his\ncomplementarity viewpoint. On the other hand, he criticized Heisenberg\nseverely for his suggestion that these relations were due to\ndiscontinuous changes occurring during a measurement process. Rather,\nBohr argued, their proper derivation should start from the\nindispensability of both particle and wave concepts. He pointed out\nthat the uncertainties in the experiment did not exclusively arise\nfrom the discontinuities but also from the fact that in the experiment\nwe need to take into account both the particle theory and the wave\ntheory. It is not so much the unknown disturbance which renders the\nmomentum of the electron uncertain but rather the fact that the\nposition and the momentum of the electron cannot be simultaneously\ndefined in this experiment (see the \u201cAddition in Proof\u201d to\nHeisenberg\u2019s paper).\n\nWe shall not go too deeply into the matter of Bohr\u2019s\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics since we are mostly interested in\nBohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty principle. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the former we refer to Scheibe (1973), Folse (1985),\nHonner (1987) and Murdoch (1987). It may be useful, however, to sketch\nsome of the main points.  Central in Bohr\u2019s considerations is\nthe language we use in physics. No matter how abstract and\nsubtle the concepts of modern physics may be, they are essentially an\nextension of our ordinary language and a means to communicate the\nresults of our experiments.  These results, obtained under\nwell-defined experimental circumstances, are what Bohr calls the\n\u201cphenomena\u201d. A phenomenon is \u201cthe comprehension of\nthe effects observed under given experimental conditions\u201d (Bohr\n1939: 24), it is the resultant of a physical object, a measuring\napparatus and the interaction between them in a concrete experimental\nsituation. The essential difference between classical and quantum\nphysics is that in quantum physics the interaction between the object\nand the apparatus cannot be made arbitrarily small; the interaction\nmust at least comprise one quantum.  This is expressed by Bohr\u2019s\nquantum postulate:\n\n\n[\u2026 the] essence [of the formulation of the quantum theory] may\nbe expressed in the so-called quantum postulate, which attributes to\nany atomic process an essential discontinuity or rather individuality,\ncompletely foreign to classical theories and symbolized by\nPlanck\u2019s quantum of action. (Bohr 1928: 580)\n\n\nA phenomenon, therefore, is an indivisible whole and the result of a\nmeasurement cannot be considered as an autonomous manifestation of the\nobject itself independently of the measurement context. The quantum\npostulate forces upon us a new way of describing physical\nphenomena:\n\n\nIn this situation, we are faced with the necessity of a radical\nrevision of the foundation for the description and explanation of\nphysical phenomena. Here, it must above all be recognized that,\nhowever far quantum effects transcend the scope of classical physical\nanalysis, the account of the experimental arrangement and the record\nof the observations must always be expressed in common language\nsupplemented with the terminology of classical physics. (Bohr 1948:\n313)\n\n\nThis is what Scheibe (1973) has called the \u201cbuffer\npostulate\u201d because it prevents the quantum from penetrating into\nthe classical description: A phenomenon must always be described in\nclassical terms; Planck\u2019s constant does not occur in this\ndescription.\n\nTogether, the two postulates induce the following reasoning. In every\nphenomenon the interaction between the object and the apparatus\ncomprises at least one quantum. But the description of the phenomenon\nmust use classical notions in which the quantum of action does not\noccur. Hence, the interaction cannot be analysed in this description.\nOn the other hand, the classical character of the description allows\nus to speak in terms of the object itself. Instead of saying:\n\u201cthe interaction between a particle and a photographic plate has\nresulted in a black spot in a certain place on the plate\u201d, we\nare allowed to forgo mentioning the apparatus and say: \u201cthe\nparticle has been found in this place\u201d. The experimental\ncontext, rather than changing or disturbing pre-existing properties of\nthe object, defines what can meaningfully be said about the\nobject.\n\nBecause the interaction between object and apparatus is left out in\nour description of the phenomenon, we do not get the whole picture.\nYet, any attempt to extend our description by performing the\nmeasurement of a different observable quantity of the object, or\nindeed, on the measurement apparatus, produces a new phenomenon and we\nare again confronted with the same situation. Because of the\nunanalyzable interaction in both measurements, the two descriptions\ncannot, generally, be united into a single picture. They are what Bohr\ncalls complementary descriptions:\n\n\n[the quantum of action]\u2026forces us to adopt a new mode of\ndescription designated as complementary in the sense that any given\napplication of classical concepts precludes the simultaneous use of\nother classical concepts which in a different connection are equally\nnecessary for the elucidation of the phenomena. (Bohr 1929: 10)\n\n\nThe most important example of complementary descriptions is provided\nby the measurements of the position and momentum of an object. If one\nwants to measure the position of the object relative to a given\nspatial frame of reference, the measuring instrument must be rigidly\nfixed to the bodies which define the frame of reference. But this\nimplies the impossibility of investigating the exchange of momentum\nbetween the object and the instrument and we are cut off from\nobtaining any information about the momentum of the object. If, on the\nother hand, one wants to measure the momentum of an object the\nmeasuring instrument must be able to move relative to the spatial\nreference frame. Bohr here assumes that a momentum measurement\ninvolves the registration of the recoil of some movable part of the\ninstrument and the use of the law of momentum conservation. The\nlooseness of the part of the instrument with which the object\ninteracts entails that the instrument cannot serve to accurately\ndetermine the position of the object. Since a measuring instrument\ncannot be rigidly fixed to the spatial reference frame and, at the\nsame time, be movable relative to it, the experiments which serve to\nprecisely determine the position and the momentum of an object are\nmutually exclusive. Of course, in itself, this is not at all typical\nfor quantum mechanics. But, because the interaction between object and\ninstrument during the measurement can neither be neglected nor\ndetermined the two measurements cannot be combined. This means that in\nthe description of the object one must choose between the assignment\nof a precise position or of a precise momentum.\n\nSimilar considerations hold with respect to the measurement of time\nand energy. Just as the spatial coordinate system must be fixed by\nmeans of solid bodies so must the time coordinate be fixed by means of\nunperturbed, synchronised clocks. But it is precisely this requirement\nwhich prevents one from taking into account of the exchange of energy\nwith the instrument if this is to serve its purpose. Conversely, any\nconclusion about the object based on the conservation of energy\nprevents following its development in time.\n\nThe conclusion is that in quantum mechanics we are confronted with a\ncomplementarity between two descriptions which are united in the\nclassical mode of description: the space-time description (or\ncoordination) of a process and the description based on the\napplicability of the dynamical conservation laws. The quantum forces\nus to give up the classical mode of description (also called the\n\u201ccausal\u201d mode of description by\n Bohr[4]:\n it is impossible to form a classical picture of what is going on when\nradiation interacts with matter as, e.g., in the Compton effect.\n\n\nAny arrangement suited to study the exchange of energy and momentum\nbetween the electron and the photon must involve a latitude in the\nspace-time description sufficient for the definition of wave-number\nand frequency which enter in the relation [\\(E = h\\nu\\) and \\(p =\nh\\sigma\\)]. Conversely, any attempt of locating the collision between\nthe photon and the electron more accurately would, on account of the\nunavoidable interaction with the fixed scales and clocks defining the\nspace-time reference frame, exclude all closer account as regards the\nbalance of momentum and energy. (Bohr 1949: 210)\n\n\nA causal description of the process cannot be attained; we have to\ncontent ourselves with complementary descriptions. \u201cThe\nviewpoint of complementarity may be regarded\u201d, according to\nBohr, \u201cas a rational generalization of the very ideal of\ncausality\u201d.\n\nIn addition to complementary descriptions Bohr also talks about\ncomplementary phenomena and complementary quantities. Position and\nmomentum, as well as time and energy, are complementary\n quantities.[5]\n\n\nWe have seen that Bohr\u2019s approach to quantum theory puts heavy\nemphasis on the language used to communicate experimental\nobservations, which, in his opinion, must always remain classical. By\ncomparison, he seemed to put little value on arguments starting from\nthe mathematical formalism of quantum theory. This informal approach\nis typical of all of Bohr\u2019s discussions on the meaning of\nquantum mechanics. One might say that for Bohr the conceptual\nclarification of the situation has primary importance while the\nformalism is only a symbolic representation of this situation.\n\nThis is remarkable since, finally, it is the formalism which needs to\nbe interpreted. This neglect of the formalism is one of the reasons\nwhy it is so difficult to get a clear understanding of Bohr\u2019s\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and why it has aroused so much\ncontroversy. We close this section by citing from an article of 1948\nto show how Bohr conceived the role of the formalism of quantum\nmechanics:\n\n\nThe entire formalism is to be considered as a tool for deriving\npredictions, of definite or statistical character, as regards\ninformation obtainable under experimental conditions described in\nclassical terms and specified by means of parameters entering into the\nalgebraic or differential equations of which the matrices or the\nwave-functions, respectively, are solutions. These symbols themselves,\nas is indicated already by the use of imaginary numbers, are not\nsusceptible to pictorial interpretation; and even derived real\nfunctions like densities and currents are only to be regarded as\nexpressing the probabilities for the occurrence of individual events\nobservable under well-defined experimental conditions. (Bohr 1948:\n314)\n\n3.2 Bohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty relations\n\nIn his Como lecture, published in 1928, Bohr gave his own version of a\nderivation of the uncertainty relations between position and momentum\nand between time and energy. He started from the relations\n\n\\[\\tag{13} E = h\\nu \\text{ and } p = h/\\lambda\\]\n\n\n which connect the notions of energy \\(E\\) and momentum\n\\(p\\) from the particle picture with those of frequency \\(\\nu\\) and\nwavelength \\(\\lambda\\) from the wave picture. He noticed that a wave\npacket of limited extension in space and time can only be built up by\nthe superposition of a number of elementary waves with a large range\nof wave numbers and frequencies. Denoting the spatial and temporal\nextensions of the wave packet by \\(\\Delta x\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\), and\nthe extensions in the wave number \\(\\sigma := 1/\\lambda\\) and\nfrequency by \\(\\Delta \\sigma\\) and \\(\\Delta \\nu\\), it follows from\nFourier analysis that in the most favorable case \\(\\Delta x \\Delta\n\\sigma \\approx \\Delta t \\Delta \\nu \\approx 1\\), and, using (13), one\nobtains the relations \n\n\\[\\tag{14} \\Delta t \\Delta E \\approx \\Delta x \\Delta p \\approx h\\]\n\n\nNote that \\(\\Delta x, \\Delta \\sigma\\), etc., are not standard\ndeviations but unspecified measures of the size of a wave packet. (The\noriginal text has equality signs instead of approximate equality\nsigns, but, since Bohr does not define the spreads exactly the use of\napproximate equality signs seems more in line with his intentions.\nMoreover, Bohr himself used approximate equality signs in later\npresentations.) These equations determine, according to Bohr: \n\n\nthe highest possible accuracy in the definition of the energy and\nmomentum of the individuals associated with the wave field. (Bohr\n1928: 571).\n\n\nHe noted, \n\n\nThis circumstance may be regarded as a simple symbolic expression of\nthe complementary nature of the space-time description and the claims\nof causality.\n (ibid).[6]\n\n\n\nWe note a few points about Bohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty\nrelations. First of all, Bohr does not refer to discontinuous\nchanges in the relevant quantities during the measurement\nprocess. Rather, he emphasizes the possibility of defining\nthese quantities. This view is markedly different from\nHeisenberg\u2019s view. A draft version of the Como lecture is even\nmore explicit on the difference between Bohr and Heisenberg:\n\n\nThese reciprocal uncertainty relations were given in a recent paper of\nHeisenberg as the expression of the statistical element which, due to\nthe feature of discontinuity implied in the quantum postulate,\ncharacterizes any interpretation of observations by means of classical\nconcepts. It must be remembered, however, that the uncertainty in\nquestion is not simply a consequence of a discontinuous change of\nenergy and momentum say during an interaction between radiation and\nmaterial particles employed in measuring the space-time coordinates of\nthe individuals. According to the above considerations the question is\nrather that of the impossibility of defining rigorously such a change\nwhen the space-time coordination of the individuals is also\nconsidered. (Bohr 1985: 93)\n\n\nIndeed, Bohr not only rejected Heisenberg\u2019s argument that these\nrelations are due to discontinuous disturbances implied by the act of\nmeasuring, but also his view that the measurement process\ncreates a definite result:\n\n\nThe unaccustomed features of the situation with which we are\nconfronted in quantum theory necessitate the greatest caution as\nregard all questions of terminology. Speaking, as it is often done of\ndisturbing a phenomenon by observation, or even of creating physical\nattributes to objects by measuring processes is liable to be\nconfusing, since all such sentences imply a departure from conventions\nof basic language which even though it can be practical for the sake\nof brevity, can never be unambiguous. (Bohr 1939: 24)\n\n\nNor did he approve of an epistemological formulation or one in terms\nof experimental inaccuracies:\n\n\n[\u2026] a sentence like \u201cwe cannot know both the momentum and\nthe position of an atomic object\u201d raises at once questions as to\nthe physical reality of two such attributes of the object, which can\nbe answered only by referring to the mutual exclusive conditions for\nan unambiguous use of space-time concepts, on the one hand, and\ndynamical conservation laws on the other hand. (Bohr 1948: 315; also\nBohr 1949: 211)\n\nIt would in particular not be out of place in this connection to warn\nagainst a misunderstanding likely to arise when one tries to express\nthe content of Heisenberg\u2019s well-known indeterminacy relation by\nsuch a statement as \u201cthe position and momentum of a particle\ncannot simultaneously be measured with arbitrary accuracy\u201d.\nAccording to such a formulation it would appear as though we had to do\nwith some arbitrary renunciation of the measurement of either the one\nor the other of two well-defined attributes of the object, which would\nnot preclude the possibility of a future theory taking both attributes\ninto account on the lines of the classical physics. (Bohr 1937:\n292)\n\n\nInstead, Bohr always stressed that the uncertainty relations are first\nand foremost an expression of complementarity. This may seem odd since\ncomplementarity is a dichotomic relation between two types of\ndescription whereas the uncertainty relations allow for intermediate\nsituations between two extremes. They \u201cexpress\u201d the\ndichotomy in the sense that if we take the energy and momentum to be\nperfectly well-defined, symbolically \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta p\\) = 0, the\nposition and time variables are completely undefined, \\(\\Delta x =\n\\Delta t = \\infty\\), and vice versa. But they also allow intermediate\nsituations in which the mentioned uncertainties are all non-zero and\nfinite. This more positive aspect of the uncertainty relation is\nmentioned in the Como lecture:\n\n\nAt the same time, however, the general character of this relation\nmakes it possible to a certain extent to reconcile the conservation\nlaws with the space-time coordination of observations, the idea of a\ncoincidence of well-defined events in space-time points being replaced\nby that of unsharply defined individuals within space-time regions.\n(Bohr 1928: 571)\n\n\nHowever, Bohr never followed up on this suggestion that we might be\nable to strike a compromise between the two mutually exclusive modes\nof description in terms of unsharply defined quantities. Indeed, an\nattempt to do so, would take the formalism of quantum theory more\nseriously than the concepts of classical language, and this step Bohr\nrefused to take. Instead, in his later writings he would be content\nwith stating that the uncertainty relations simply defy an unambiguous\ninterpretation in classical terms:\n\n\nThese so-called indeterminacy relations explicitly bear out the\nlimitation of causal analysis, but it is important to recognize that\nno unambiguous interpretation of such a relation can be given in words\nsuited to describe a situation in which physical attributes are\nobjectified in a classical way. (Bohr 1948: 315)\n\n\nFinally, on a more formal level, we note that Bohr\u2019s derivation\ndoes not rely on the commutation relations\n (1)\n and\n (5),\n but on Fourier analysis. These two approaches are equivalent as far\nas the relationship between position and momentum is concerned, but\nthis is not so for time and energy since most physical systems do not\nhave a time operator. Indeed, in his discussion with Einstein (Bohr\n1949), Bohr considered time as a simple classical variable. This even\nholds for his famous discussion of the \u201cclock-in-the-box\u201d\nthought-experiment where the time, as defined by the clock in the box,\nis treated from the point of view of classical general relativity.\nThus, in an approach based on commutation relations, the\nposition-momentum and time-energy uncertainty relations are not on\nequal footing, which is contrary to Bohr\u2019s approach in terms of\nFourier analysis. For more details see (Hilgevoord 1996 and 1998).\n4. The Minimal Interpretation\n\nIn the previous two sections we have seen how both Heisenberg and Bohr\nattributed a far-reaching status to the uncertainty relations. They\nboth argued that these relations place fundamental limits on the\napplicability of the usual classical concepts. Moreover, they both\nbelieved that these limitations were inevitable and forced upon us.\nHowever, we have also seen that they reached such conclusions by\nstarting from radical and controversial assumptions. This entails, of\ncourse, that their radical conclusions remain unconvincing for those\nwho reject these assumptions. Indeed, the operationalist-positivist\nviewpoint adopted by these authors has long since lost its appeal\namong philosophers of physics.\n\nSo the question may be asked what alternative views of the uncertainty\nrelations are still viable. Of course, this problem is intimately\nconnected with that of the interpretation of the wave function, and\nhence of quantum mechanics as a whole. Since there is no consensus\nabout the latter, one cannot expect consensus about the interpretation\nof the uncertainty relations either. Here we only describe a point of\nview, which we call the \u201cminimal interpretation\u201d, that\nseems to be shared by both the adherents of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation and of other views.\n\nIn quantum mechanics a system is supposed to be described by its wave\nfunction, also called its quantum state or state vector. Given the\nstate vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), one can derive probability\ndistributions for all the physical quantities pertaining to the\nsystem, usually called its observables, such as its position,\nmomentum, angular momentum, energy, etc. The operational meaning of\nthese probability distributions is that they correspond to the\ndistribution of the values obtained for these quantities in a long\nseries of repetitions of the measurement. More precisely, one imagines\na great number of copies of the system under consideration, all\nprepared in the same way. On each copy the momentum, say, is measured.\nGenerally, the outcomes of these measurements differ and a\ndistribution of outcomes is obtained. The theoretical momentum\ndistribution derived from the quantum state is supposed to coincide\nwith the hypothetical distribution of outcomes obtained in an infinite\nseries of repetitions of the momentum measurement. The same holds,\nmutatis mutandis, for all the other physical quantities\npertaining to the system. Note that no simultaneous measurements of\ntwo or more quantities are required in defining the operational\nmeaning of the probability distributions.\n\nThe uncertainty relations discussed above can be considered as\nstatements about the spreads of the probability distributions of the\nseveral physical quantities arising from the same state. For example,\nthe uncertainty relation between the position and momentum of a system\nmay be understood as the statement that the position and momentum\ndistributions cannot both be arbitrarily narrow\u2014in some sense of\nthe word \u201cnarrow\u201d\u2014in any quantum state. Inequality\n (9)\n is an example of such a relation in which the standard deviation is\nemployed as a measure of spread. From this characterization of\nuncertainty relations follows that a more detailed interpretation of\nthe quantum state than the one given in the previous paragraph is not\nrequired to study uncertainty relations as such. In particular, a\nfurther ontological or linguistic interpretation of the notion of\nuncertainty, as limits on the applicability of our concepts given by\nHeisenberg or Bohr, need not be supposed.\n\nOf course, this minimal interpretation leaves the question open\nwhether it makes sense to attribute precise values of position and\nmomentum to an individual system. Some interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, e.g., those of Heisenberg and Bohr, deny this; while\nothers, e.g., the interpretation of de Broglie and Bohm insist that\neach individual system has a definite position and momentum (see the\nentry on\n Bohmian mechanics).\n The only requirement is that, as an empirical fact, it is not\npossible to prepare pure ensembles in which all systems have the same\nvalues for these quantities, or ensembles in which the spreads are\nsmaller than allowed by quantum theory. Although interpretations of\nquantum mechanics, in which each system has a definite value for its\nposition and momentum are still viable, this is not to say that they\nare without strange features of their own; they do not imply a return\nto classical physics.\n\nWe end with a few remarks on this minimal interpretation. First, it\nmay be noted that the minimal interpretation of the uncertainty\nrelations is little more than filling in the empirical meaning of\ninequality\n (9).\n As such, this view shares many of the limitations we have noted above\nabout this inequality. Indeed, it is not straightforward to relate the\nspread in a statistical distribution of measurement results with the\ninaccuracy of this measurement, such as, e.g., the resolving\npower of a microscope, or of a disturbance of the system by\nthe measurement. Moreover, the minimal interpretation does not address\nthe question whether one can make simultaneous accurate\nmeasurements of position and momentum.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one can show that the standard formalism of\nquantum mechanics does not allow such simultaneous measurements. But\nthis is not a consequence of relation\n (9).\n Rather, it follows from the fact that this formalism simply does not\ncontain any observable that would accomplish such a task. The\nextension of this formalism that allows observables to be represented\nby positive-operator-valued measures or POVM\u2019s, does allow the\nformal introduction of observables describing joint measurements (see\nalso\n section 6.1).\n But even here, for the case of position and momentum, one finds that\nsuch measurements have to be \u201cunsharp\u201d, which entails that\nthey cannot be regarded as simultaneous accurate measurements.\n\nIf one feels that statements about inaccuracy of measurement, or the\npossibility of simultaneous measurements, belong to any satisfactory\nformulation of the uncertainty principle, one will need to look for\nother formulations of the uncertainty principle. Some candidates for\nsuch formulations will be discussed in\n Section 6.\n First, however, we will look at formulations of the uncertainty\nprinciple that stay firmly within the minimal interpretation, and\ndiffer from\n (9)\n only by using measures of uncertainty other than the standard\ndeviation.\n5. Alternative measures of uncertainty\n\nWhile the standard deviation is the most well-known quantitative\nmeasure for uncertainty or the spread in the probability distribution,\nit is not the only one, and indeed it has distinctive drawbacks that\nother such measures may lack. For example, in the definition of the\nstandard deviations\n (11)\n one can see that that the probability density function \n\\(\\abs{\\psi(q)}^2\\) is weighed by a quadratic factor \\(q^2\\) that\nputs increasing emphasis on its tails. Therefore, the value of\n\\(\\Delta_\\psi \\bQ\\) will depend predominantly at how this\ndensity behaves at the tails: if these falls off very quickly, e.g.,\nlike a Gaussian, it will be small, but if the tails drop off only\nslowly the standard deviation may be very large, even when most\nprobability is concentrated in a small interval.\n\nThe upshot of this objection is that having a lower bound on the\nproduct of the standard deviations of position and momentum, as the\nHeisenberg-Kennard uncertainty relation\n (9)\n gives, does not by itself rule out a state where both the\nprobability densities for position and momentum are extremely\nconcentrated, in the sense of having more than \\((1- \\epsilon)\\) of\ntheir probability concentrated in a a region of size smaller than\n\\(\\delta\\), for any choice of \\(\\epsilon, \\delta >0\\). This means,\nin our view, that relation\n (9)\n actually fails to express what most physicists would take to be the\nvery core idea of the uncertainty principle.\n\nOne way to deal with this objection is to consider alternative\nmeasures to quantify the spread or uncertainty associated with a\nprobability density. Here we discuss two such proposals.\n5.1 Landau-Pollak uncertainty relations\n\nThe most straightforward alternative is to pick some value \\(\\alpha\\)\nclose to one, say \\(\\alpha = 0.9\\), and ask for the width of the\nsmallest interval that supports the fraction \\(\\alpha\\) of the total\nprobability distribution in position and similarly for momentum:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{15} W_{\\alpha}(\\bQ, \\psi) &:=\n \\inf_{\\abs{I}} \\left\\{ I: \\int_I {\\abs{\\psi(q)}}^2 dq \\geq \\alpha \\right\\} \\\\ \n\\notag W_{\\beta}(\\bP,\\psi) &:= \\inf_I \\left\\{\\int_I \\abs{\\tilde\\psi(p)}^2 dp \\geq \\beta \\right\\} \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nIn a previous work (Uffink and Hilgevoord 1985) we called such\nmeasures bulk widths, because they indicate how concentrated\nthe \u201dbulk\u201d (i.e., fraction \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\)) of the\nprobability distribution is. Landau and Pollak (1961) obtained an\nuncertainty relation in terms of these bulk widths. \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag{16} W_\\alpha (\\bQ, \\psi) W_\\beta (\\bP, \\psi) &\\geq \n 2\\pi \\hbar \\left( \\alpha \\beta - \\sqrt{(1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)} \\right)^2 \\\\\n\\notag &\\mbox{if } \\alpha+ \\beta \\geq 1/2 \n\\end{align*}\\label{LP}\\]\n\n\nThis Landau-Pollak inequality shows that if the choices of \\(\\alpha,\n\\beta\\) are not too low, there is a state-independent lower bound on\nthe product of the bulk widths of the position and momentum\ndistribution for any quantum state.\n\nNote that bulk widths are not so sensitive to the behavior of the\ntails of the distributions and, therefore, the Landau-Pollak\ninequality is immune to the objection above.Thus, this inequality\nexpresses constraints on quantum mechanical states not contained in\nrelation\n (9).\n Further, by the well-known Bienaym\u00e9-Chebyshev inequality, one\nhas \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{17} W_\\alpha (\\bQ,\\psi) &\\leq \\frac{2}{\\sqrt {1- \\alpha}} \\Delta_\\psi \\bQ \\\\ \n\\notag   W_\\beta (\\bP, \\psi) &\\leq \\frac{2}{\\sqrt {1- \\beta}} \\Delta_\\psi \\bP \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n so that inequality\n (16)\n implies (by choosing \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) optimal) that \\( \\Delta_\\psi\n\\bQ \\Delta_\\psi \\bP \\geq 0.12 \\hbar \\). This,\nobviously, is not the best lower bound for the product of standard\ndeviations, but the important point is here that the Landau-Pollak\ninequality\n (16)\n in terms of bulk widths implies the existence of a lower\nbound on the product of standard deviations, while conversely, the\nHeisenberg-Kennard equality\n (9)\n does not imply any bound on the product of bulk widths. A\ngeneralization of this approach to non-commuting observables in a\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space is discussed in Uffink 1990.\n5.2 Entropic uncertainty relations\n\nAnother approach to express the uncertainty principle is to use\nentropic measures of uncertainty. The foremost example of these is the\nShannon entropy, which for the position and momentum\ndistribution of a given state vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) may be\ndefined as: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{18} H(\\bQ, \\psi) &:= -\\int \\abs{\\psi(q)}^2 \\ln \\abs{\\psi(q)}^2 dq \\\\ \n\\notag   H(\\bP, \\psi) &:= -\\int \\abs{\\tilde{\\psi}(p)}^2 \\ln \\abs{\\tilde{\\psi}(p)}^2 dp \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n One can then show (see Beckner 1975;\nBia\u0142inicki-Birula and Micielski 1975) that \n\n\\[\\tag{19} H(\\bQ, \\psi) + H(\\bP,\\psi) \\geq \\ln (e \\pi \\hbar) \\]\n\n\nA nice feature of this entropic uncertainty relation is that it\nprovides a strict improvement of the Heisenberg-Kennard relation. That\nis to say, one can show (independently of quantum theory) that for any\nprobability density function \\(p(x)\\) \n\n\\[\\tag{20} -\\int\\!  p(x) \\ln p(x) dx \\leq  \\ln (\\sqrt{2 \\pi e} \\Delta x )\\]\n\n\n\nApplying this to the inequality\n (19)\n we get: \n\n\\[\\tag{21}\n\\frac{\\hslash}{2} \\leq(2\\pi e)^{-1} \\exp (H(\\bQ, \\psi) + H(\\bP,\\psi)) \\leq \n  \\Delta_\\psi \\bQ\\Delta_\\psi \\bP\n\\]\n\n\n showing that the entropic uncertainty relation\nimplies the Heisenberg-Kennard uncertainty relation. A drawback of\nthis relation is that it does not completely evade the objection\nmentioned above, (i.e., these entropic measures of uncertainty can\nbecome as large as one pleases while \\(1-\\epsilon\\) of the probability\nin the distribution is concentrated on a very small interval), but the\nexamples needed to show this are admittedly more far-fetched.\n\nFor non-commuting observables in a \\(n\\)-dimensional Hilbert space,\none can similarly define an entropic uncertainty in the probability\ndistribution \\(\\abs{\\braket{a_i}{\\psi}}^2\\) for a\ngiven state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and a complete set of\neigenstates \\(\\ket{a_i}\\), \\( (i= 1, \\ldots n)\\), of the\nobservable \\(\\bA\\): \n\n\\[\\tag{22} \nH(\\bA ,\\psi) := -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{\\braket{a_i}{\\psi}}^2 \\ln \\abs{\\braket{a_i}{\\psi}}^2\n\\]\n\n\n and \\(H(\\bB,\\psi)\\) similarly in terms of the probability distribution \n\\(\\abs{\\braket{b_j}{\\psi}}^2\\) for a complete set\nof eigenstates \\(\\ket{b_j}\\), (\\(j =1, \\ldots, n\\)) of\nobservable \\(\\bB\\). Then we obtain the uncertainty relation\n(Maassen and Uffink 1988):\n\n\\[\\tag{23} \nH( bA, \\psi) + H(\\bB, \\psi) \\geq 2 \\ln \\max_{i,j} \\abs{\\braket{a_i}{b_j}},\n\\]\n\n\n which was further generalized and improved\nby (Frank and Lieb 2012). The most important advantage of these\nrelations is that, in contrast to Robertson\u2019s inequality\n (12),\n the lower bound is a positive constant, independent of the state.\n6. Uncertainty relations for inaccuracy and disturbance\n\nBoth the standard deviation and the alternative measures of\nuncertainty considered in the previous subsection (and many more that\nwe have not mentioned!) are designed to indicate the width or spread\nof a single given probability distribution. Applied to quantum\nmechanics, where the probability distributions for position and\nmomentum are obtained from a given quantum state vector, one can use\nthem to formulate uncertainty relations that characterize the spread\nin those distribution for any given state. The resulting inequalities\nthen express limitations on what state-preparations quantum mechanics\nallows. They are thus expressions of what may be called a\npreparation uncertainty principle:\n\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is impossible to prepare any system in a\nstate \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) such that its position and momentum\nare both precisely predictable, in the sense of having both the\nexpected spread in a measurement of position and the expected spread\nin a momentum measurement arbitrarily small.\n\n\nThe relations\n (9,\n 16,\n 19)\n all belong to this category; the mere difference being that they\nemploy different measures of spread: viz. the standard deviation, the\nbulk width or the Shannon entropy.\n\nNote that in this formulation, there is no reference to simultaneous\nor joint measurements, nor to any notion of accuracy like the\nresolving power of the measurement instrument, nor to the issue of how\nmuch the system in the state that is being measured is\ndisturbed by this measurement. This section is devoted to\nattempts that go beyond the mold of this preparation uncertain\nprinciple.\n6.1 The recent debate on error-disturbance relations\n\nWe have seen that in 1927 Heisenberg argued that the measurement of\n(say) position must necessarily disturb the conjugate variable (i.e.,\nmomentum) by an amount that is inversely proportional to the\ninaccuracy of measurement of the former. We have also seen that this\nidea was not maintained in the Kennard\u2019s uncertainty relation\n (9),\n a relation that was embraced by Heisenberg (1930) and most textbooks.\n\nA rather natural question thus arises whether there are further\ninequalities in quantum mechanics that would address\nHeisenberg\u2019s original thinking more directly, i.e., that do deal\nwith how much one variable is disturbed by the accurate measurement of\nanother. That is, we will look at attempts that would establish a\nclaim which may be called a measurement uncertainty\nprinciple.\n\n\nIn quantum mechanics, there is no measurement procedure by which one\ncan accurately measure the position of a system without disturbing it\nmomentum, in the sense that some measure of inaccuracy in position and\nsome measure of the disturbance of momentum of the system by the\nmeasurement cannot both be arbitrarily small.\n\n\nThis formulation of the uncertainty principle has always remained\ncontroversial. Uncertainty relations that would express this alleged\nprinciple are often called \u201cerror-disturbance\u201d relations\nor \u201cnoise-disturbance\u201d relations We will look at two\nrecent proposals to search for such relations: Ozawa (2003) and Busch,\nLahti, and Werner (2013).\n\nIn Ozawa\u2019s approach, we assume that a system \\(\\cal S\\) of\ninterest in state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) is coupled to a\nmeasurement device \\(\\cal M\\) in state \\(\\ket{\\chi}\\), and\ntheir interaction is governed by a unitary operator \\(U\\). On the\nHilbert space of the joint system the observable \\(\\bQ\\) of\nthe system \\(\\cal S\\) we are interested in is represented by\n\n\\[\\tag{24} \\bQ_{\\rm in}  =   \\bQ  \\otimes \\mathbb{1}\\]\n\n\n The measurement interaction will allow us to perform an\n(inaccurate) measurement of this quantity by reading off a pointer\nobservable \\(\\boldsymbol{Q'}\\) of the measurement device after the\ninteraction. Hence this inaccurate observable may be represented as\n\n\\[\\tag{25}\n\\bQ'_{\\rm out} = U^\\dagger( \\mathbb{1} \\otimes \\bQ') U\\]\n\n\nThe measure of noise in the measurement of \\(\\bQ\\) is then\nchosen as: \n\n\\[\\tag{26} \n\\epsilon_\\psi(\\bQ) := \\expval{(\\bQ'_{\\rm out} - \\bQ_{\\rm in})^2}_{\\psi \\otimes \\chi}^{1/2}\\]\n\n\nA comparison of the initial momentum \n \\(\\bP_{\\rm in} = \\bP \\otimes \\mathbb{1}\\) \nand the final momentum after the measurement \n \\(\\bP_{\\rm out} = U^\\dagger (\\bP \\otimes \\mathbb{1})U\\) is made by choosing \na measure of the disturbance of \\(\\bP\\) by the measurement procedure: \n\n\\[\\tag{27} \n\\eta_\\psi(\\bP):= \\expval{(\\bP_{\\rm in} - \\bP_{\\rm out})^2}_{\\psi\\otimes\\chi}^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n\n Ozawa\nobtained an inequality involving those two measures, which, however,\nis more involved than previous uncertainty relations. For our\npurposes, however, the important point is that Ozawa showed that the\nproduct \\(\\epsilon_\\psi (\\bQ) \\eta_\\psi (\\bP)\\)\nhas no positive lower bound. His conclusion from this was that\nHeisenberg\u2019s noise-disturbance relation is violated.\n\nYet, whether Ozawa\u2019s result indeed succeeds in formulating\nHeisenberg\u2019s qualitative discussion of disturbance and accuracy\nin the microscope example has come under dispute. See Busch, Lahti and\nWerner (2013, and 2014 (Other Internet Resources)), and Ozawa (2013,\nOther Internet Resources).\n\nAn objection raised in this dispute is that a quantity like\n\\(\\expval{(\\bQ'_{\\rm out} - \\bQ_{\\rm in})^2}^{1/2}\\) tells us very\nlittle about how good the observable \\({\\bQ'}_{\\rm out}\\) can stand in\nas an inaccurate measurement of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\). The main point to\nobserve here is that these operators generally do not commute, and\nthat measurements of \\(\\bQ'_{\\rm out}\\), of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\) and of\ntheir difference will require altogether three different measurement\ncontexts. To require that \\(\\epsilon_\\psi(\\bQ)\\) vanishes, for\nexample, means only that the state prepared belongs to the linear\nsubspace corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the operator \n\\(\\bQ'_{\\rm out} - {\\bQ}_{\\rm in}\\), and therefore that \n\\(\\expval{\\bQ'_{\\rm out}}_\\psi = \\expval{\\bQ_{\\rm in}}_\\psi\\), \nbut this does not preclude that the probability\ndistribution of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm out}\\) in state \\(\\psi\\) might be wildly\ndifferent from that of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\). But then no one would think\nof \\(\\bQ_{\\rm out}\\) as an accurate measurement of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\)\nso that the definition of \\(\\epsilon_\\psi(\\bQ)\\) does not express what\nit is supposed to express. A similar objection can also be raised\nagainst \\(\\eta_\\psi (\\bP)\\).\n\nAnother observation is that Ozawa\u2019s conclusion that there is no\nlower bound for his error-disturbance product for is not at all\nsurprising. That is, even without probing the system by a measurement\napparatus, one can show that such a lower bound does not exist. If the\ninitial state of a system is prepared at time \\(t=0\\) as a Gaussian\nquasi-monochromatic wave packet with \\(\\expval{\\bQ_0}_\\psi =0\\) and \nevolves freely, we can use a time-of-flight\nmeasurement to learn about its later position. Ehrenfest\u2019s\ntheorem tells us: \\(\\expval{\\bQ_t}_\\psi = \\frac{t}{m} \\expval{\\bP}_\\psi\\).\n\nHence, as an approximative measurement of the position\n\\(\\bQ_t\\), one could propose the observable\n\\(\\bQ'_t = \\frac{t}{m}\\bP\\). It is known that\nunder the stated conditions (and with \\(m\\) and \\(t\\) large) this\napproximation holds very well, i.e., we do not only have \n\\(\\expval{\\bQ'_t -\\bQ_t}_\\psi =0\\), but also \n\\(\\expval{(\\bQ'_t -\\bQ_t)^2} \\approx 0\\),\nas nearly as we please. But since \\(\\bQ'_t\\) is just the\nmomentum multiplied by a constant, its measurement will obviously not\ndisturb the momentum of the system. In other words, for this example,\none has \\(\\epsilon_\\psi (\\bQ)\\) as small as we please with\nzero disturbance of the momentum. Therefore, any hopes that there\ncould be a positive lower bound for the product \\(\\epsilon_\\psi\n(\\bQ) \\eta_\\psi (\\bP)\\) seem to be dashed, even\nwith the simplest of measurement schemes, i.e.\u00a0a free evolution.\n\nOzawa\u2019s results do not show that Heisenberg\u2019s analysis of\nthe microscope argument was wrong. Rather, they throw doubt on the\nappropriateness of the definitions he used to formalize\nHeisenberg\u2019s informal argument.\n\nAn entirely different analysis of the problem of substantiating a\nmeasurement uncertainty relation was offered by Busch, Lahti, and\nWerner (2013). These authors consider a measurement device \\(\\cal M\\)\nthat makes a joint unsharp measurement of both position and momentum.\nTo describe such joint unsharp measurements, they employ the extended\nmodern formalism that characterizes obervables not by self-adjoint\noperators but by positive-operator-valued measures (POVM\u2019s). In\nthe present case, this means that the measurement procedure is\ncharacterized by a collection of positive operators, \\(M(p,q)\\), where\nthe pair \\(p,q\\) represent the outcome variables of the measurement,\nwith \n\n\\[\\tag{28}\nM(p,q) \\geq 0, \\iint \\! dp dq \\, M(p,q) =\\mathbb{1} .\\]\n\n\nThe two marginals of this POVM, \n\n\\[\\tag{29}\n\\begin{align*}\nM_1(q)   &= \\int\\! dp  M(p,q)\\\\\nM_2(p)   &= \\int\\! dq  M(p,q)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\n are also POVM\u2019s in\ntheir own right and represent the unsharp position \\(Q'\\) and unsharp\nmomentum \\(P'\\) observables respectively. (Note that these do\nnot refer to a self-adjoint operator!)\n\nFor a system prepared in a state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), the joint\nprobability density of obtaining outcomes \\((p,q)\\) in the joint\nunsharp measurement\n (28)\n is then \n\n\\[\\tag{30}\n\\rho(p,q) := \\expvalexp{M(p,q)}{\\psi},\\]\n\n while the marginals of this joint probability\ndistribution give the distributions for \\(Q'\\) and \\(P'\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{31} \\mu'(q) &: = \\int \\! dp \\, \\rho(p,q) = \\expvalexp{M_1(q)}{\\psi} \\\\\n\\notag  \\nu'(p) &:= \\int \\! dp \\, \\rho(p,q) = \\expvalexp{M_2(q)}{\\psi} \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n Since a joint sharp measurement of position and momentum\nis impossible in quantum mechanics, these marginal distributions\n (31)\n obtained from \\(M\\) will differ from that of ideal measurements of\n\\(\\bQ\\) and of \\(\\bP\\) on the system of interest\nin state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\). However, one can indicate how\nmuch these marginals deviate from separate exact position and momentum\nmeasurements on the state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) by a pairwise\ncomparison of\n (31)\n to the exact distributions \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag{32} \\mu(q)  &:= \\abs{\\braket{q}{\\psi}}^2 \\\\\n\\notag   \\nu(p)  &:= \\abs{\\braket{p}{\\psi}}^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nIn order to do so, BLW propose a distance function \\(D\\) between\nprobability distributions, such that \\(D(\\mu, \\mu')\\) tells us how\nclose the marginal position distribution \\(\\mu'(q)\\) for the unsharp\nposition \\(Q'\\) is to the exact distribution \\(\\mu(q)\\) in a sharp\nposition measurement, and likewise, \\(D(\\nu ,\\nu')\\) tells us how\nclose the marginal momentum distribution \\(\\nu'(p)\\) for \\(P'\\) is to\nthe exact momentum distribution \\(\\nu(p)\\).\n\nThe distance they chose is the Wasserstein-2 distance, a.k.a. (a\nvariation on) the earth-movers distance.\n\nDefinition (Wasserstein-2 distance)\n\nLet \\(\\mu(x)\\) and \\(\\mu'(y)\\) be any two probability distributions on\nthe real line, and \\(\\gamma(x,y)\\) any joint probability distribution\nthat has \\(\\mu'\\) and \\(\\mu\\) as its marginals. Then: \n\n\\[\\tag{33} \nD(\\mu, \\mu') := \\inf_\\gamma \\left(\\iint (x-y)^2 \\gamma (x,y) dx dy \\right)^{1/2}\\]\n\n\nApplying this definition to the case at hand, i.e.\u00a0 pairwise to the\nquantum mechanical distributions \\(\\mu'(q)\\) and \\(\\mu(q)\\) and to\n\\(\\nu'(p)\\) and \\(\\nu(p)\\) in\n (31)\n and\n (32),\n BLW\u2019s final step is to take a supremum over all possible input\nstates \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) to obtain \n\n\\[\\tag{34}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta(Q, Q') & =   \\sup_{\\ket{\\psi}}  D(\\mu, \\mu')  \\\\\n\\Delta(P, P') & =   \\sup_{\\ket{\\psi}}  D(\\nu, \\nu')\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n From these\ndefinitions, they obtain \n\n\\[\\tag{35}\\Delta(Q, Q')   \\Delta (P,P')   \\geq   \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\]\n\n\nArguing that \\(\\Delta(Q, Q')\\) provides a sensible measure for the\ninaccuracy or noise about position, and \\(\\Delta(P, P')\\) for the\ndisturbance of momentum by any such joint unsharp measurement, the\nauthors conclude, in contrast to Ozawa\u2019s analysis, that an\nerror-disturbance uncertainty relation does hold, which they take as\n\u201ca remarkable vindication of Heisenberg\u2019s\nintuitions\u201d in the microscope thought experiment.\n\nIn comparison of the two, there are a few positive remarks to make\nabout the Busch-Lahti-Werner (BLW) approach. First of all, by focusing\non the distance\n (33)\n this approach is comparing entire probability distributions\nrather than just the expectations of operator differences. When this\ndistance is very small, one is justified to conclude that the\ndistribution has changed very little under the measurement procedure.\nThis brings us closer to the conclusion that the error or disturbance\nintroduced is small. Secondly, by introducing a supremum over all\nstates to obtain \\(\\Delta( Q, Q')\\), it follows that when this latter\nexpression is small, the measured distribution \\(\\mu'\\) differs only\nlittle from the exact distribution \\(\\mu\\) whatever the state of\nthe system is. As the authors argue, this means that\n\\(\\Delta(Q,Q')\\) can be seen as a figure-of-merit of the measurement\ndevice alone, and in this sense analogous to the resolving power of a\nmicroscope.\n\nBut we also think there is an undesirable feature of the BLW approach.\nThis is due to the supremum over states appearing twice, both\nin \\(\\Delta(Q,Q')\\) and in \\(\\Delta(P,P')\\). This feature, we argue,\ndeprives their result from practical applicability.\n\nTo elucidate: In concrete applications, one would prepare a system in\nsome state (not exactly known) and perform a given joint measurement\n\\(M\\) of \\(Q'\\) and \\(P'\\). If it is given that, say, \\(\\Delta(Q,Q')\\)\nis very small, one can safely infer that \\(Q\\) has been measured with\nsmall inaccuracy, since this guarantees that the measured position\ndistribution differs very little from what an exact position\nmeasurement would give, regardless of the state of the system. Now,\none would like to be able to infer that in this case the disturbance\nof the momentum \\(P\\) from \\(P'\\) must be considerable for the\nstate prepared. But the BLW only gives us: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta(P, P') = \\sup_{\\ket{\\psi}} D(\\nu, \\nu') \\geq \n   \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta(Q, Q')}\n\\]\n\n\n and this\ndoes not imply anything for the state in question! Thus, the BLW\nuncertainty relation does not rule out that for some states it might\nbe possible to perform a joint measurement in which both \\(D(\\mu,\n\\mu')\\) and \\(D(\\nu, \\nu')\\) are very small, and in this sense have\nnegligibe error and disturbance. It seems premature to say that this\nvindicates Heisenberg\u2019s intuitions.\n\nSumming up, we emphasize that there is no contradiction between the\nBLW analysis and the Ozawa analysis: where Ozawa claims that the\nproduct of two quantities might for some states be less than the usual\nlimit, BLW show that product of different quantities will satisfy this\nlimit. The dispute is not about mathematically validity, but about how\nreasonable these quantities are to capture Heisenberg\u2019s\nqualitative considerations. The present authors feel that, in this\ndispute, Ozawa\u2019s analysis fail to be convincing. On the other\nhand, we also think that the BLW uncertainty relation is not\nsatisfactory. Also, we would like to remark that both protagonists\nemploy measures that are akin to standard deviations in being very\nsensitive to the tail behavior of probability distributions, and thus\nface a similar objection as raised in\n section 5.\n The final word in this dispute on whether a measurement uncertainty\nprinciple holds has not been reached, in our view.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Bacciagaluppi, G. and A.
