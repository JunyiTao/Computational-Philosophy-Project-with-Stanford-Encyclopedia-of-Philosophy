    "main_text": "Applications\n7. Applications\n\n\nBy clearing away some biased approaches to moral and political\ntheorizing, the work of feminist philosophers has greatly and\nbeneficially influenced the philosophy of disability. Nevertheless,\nbecause feminist philosophy is woman-centered, and most women do not\nidentify as being disabled themselves, the interests and emphases of\nfeminist thinkers are not always congruent with those of activists\naspiring to liberate the disabled from oppressive social arrangements\nor of scholars formulating liberatory theories that guide and justify\ndoing so. Two conversations where the alliance between feminist\nphilosophy and the philosophy of disability is strained relate to\nwomen's liberty to shape their own relationships, and their\nliberty to reproduce. Although disability activists and scholars\nnever deny that women should be thoroughly free, some have concerns\nabout women's exercising their freedom in ways that curtail or\ndismiss disabled people's freedom.\n",
