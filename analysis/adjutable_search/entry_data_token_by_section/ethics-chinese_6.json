    "main_text": "Confucian Ethics || Confucianism and the situationist problem for virtue ethics\n2.7 Confucianism and the situationist problem for virtue ethics\n\nIn recent years, Gilbert Harman (1998\u201399, 1999\u20132000) and\nJohn Doris (2002) have pointed to the influence of situations over\nattitude and behavior as a problem for virtue ethics. Citing empirical\nwork in social psychology, Harman and Doris claim that the extensive\nand surprising influence of situational factors undermines the\ncommonsense idea that people possess stable character traits that\nexplain what they do. Some of the classic psychological studies used\nin this argument appear to show that ordinary respectable American\ncitizens will administer dangerous electrical shocks to an innocent\nperson when urged to do so by an experimenter in a lab coat (Milgram\n1974), and that being late for an appointment is the most influential\nfactor in whether a seminary student will stop and help someone who\nseems to be falling ill, even if the appointment is to attend a\nlecture on the Good Samaritan (Darley and Batson 1973). Such studies\npose a problem not only for the commonsense conception of character\ntraits, but also for virtue ethics, which appear to assume the\npossibility of achieving stable character traits that are virtues.\nPerhaps human beings are inevitably creatures who are influenced by\nthe situation in which they act and not by any characterlogical\ndispositions they bring with them to the situation. If so, it appears\nthat the ideal of attaining virtues is misguided.\n\nThere are good reasons to expect Confucianism to offer some\ndistinctive resources for dealing with this problem. First, as pointed\nout in 2.3, Confucians appreciate the relational nature of human life:\nwho we are as persons very much includes our social context: the\npeople with whom we are in relationship and our institutions and\npractices. So they are very much in a position to appreciate\nsituational influences on how human beings think, feel, and act.\nSecond, they appear to hold something like a conception of virtues as\nstable character traits that are resistant to undue situational\ninfluences. As noted in 2.3, and this pertains to the challenge posed\nby the Milgram study, the Confucians emphasize the importance of\nliving according to one\u2019s own understanding of what is right and\ngood even if others do not see it the same way. Third, as noted at the\nbeginning of this entry, Chinese philosophy in general is\ndistinguished by a focus on the practical. This is illustrated in the\nConfucian case by the tradition of scholar-officials who not only\nwrote about and taught the importance of the ethical to the political\nlife, but strove to enact this importance in their own careers. As a\nconsequence, they were very much concerned with specifying in\npractical terms how one could go about cultivating the virtues in\noneself. Fourth, and this is very much in response to the combination\nof the previous points, they describe a long and arduous program of\nethical training to inculcate the virtues.\n\nAs Edward Slingerland (2011) has put it, Confucianism is in a good\nposition to appreciate the \u201chigh bar\u201d challenge of\nsituational influence to the project of cultivating the virtues in\noneself and others. In response to this challenge, their program of\nethical training includes study of the classics (after the ancient\nperiod, the classics came to include, of course, the Analects\nand the Mencius), memorized and rehearsed until they become\nfully internalized and embedded in the unconscious patterns of thought\nthat are so powerful in shaping what we do in everyday life (see\nSlingerland 2009). This is one characteristic pattern of Confucian\nself-cultivation: one consciously, deliberately and assiduously\nundertakes a program that inculcates dispositions to have ethically\nappropriate emotional responses and patterns of conduct. The intent is\nto make the dispositions for these responses reliable and resistant to\nundue situational influence.\n\nFurthermore, the Confucians very much appreciated the power of models\nto inspire, to make one want to transcend one\u2019s present self\n(see Tan, 2005 and Olberding, 2008, 2012, 2016). The psychologist\nJonathan Haidt (2003) has given empirical evidence for an emotion he\ncalls \u201celevation,\u201d which is something like awe and\nadmiration upon contemplating the morally admirable. The\nAnalects, in fact, has been read as a record of how a group\nof men gathered around a teacher with the power to elevate, and as a\nrecord of how this group created a culture in which goals of\nself-transformation were treated as collaborative projects. These\npeople not only discussed the nature of self-cultivation but enacted\nit as a relational process in which they supported one another,\nreinforced their common goals, and served as checks on each other in\ncase they went off the path, the dao. They were each\nother\u2019s situational influences. See Sarkissian, 2010 for the\nargument that Confucius shows how one can turn the power of situations\non people\u2019s attitudes and behavior toward positive ends; if\nsituations can influence people, one can through small details of\ncomportment and attitude be a situational influence on others that\ntilts things toward a better course.\n\nTraining in ritual, li, takes on another dimension of\nimportance in light of the situationist problem. As noted in section\n2.2 Confucian rituals help to express attitudes of respect and\nreverence for others that can exist independently of the rituals\nthemselves, but rituals provide conventionally established, symbolic\nways to express these attitudes toward others. Ritual forms,\ntherefore, give participants manifold and (just as importantly)\nregularly recurring ways to act on and therefore to strengthen the\nright attitudes and behavioral dispositions. Given the renewed\nappreciation in contemporary psychology for the power of emotions to\ninfluence attitude and behavior, the resource offered by ritual\ntraining should not be ignored by anyone concerned about the problem\nof how to resist undue situational influence.\n\nFinally, Confucianism points to the possibility that individuals,\nunder the right circumstances and encouragement, can enhance their\nreflective control of their own emotions and impulses. Mencius\u2019\nconversation with King Xuan can be conceived as an attempt to get the\nking to nourish his moral sprouts by reflecting on them, to become\naware of what his moral emotions are (such as compassion) and to take\naction to grow them. It should be noted that contemporary psychology\nis exploring the factors that work into the development of\nself-control of one\u2019s emotions and impulses (e.g., chapter 3 in\nBelsky et al., 2022). See Lieberman (2011) and Creswell (2007) for\nstudies indicating that meditation focused on cultivating compassion\nin oneself can be effective through enhancing one\u2019s ability to\nidentify and gain better control of one\u2019s emotions.\n\nFinally, in considering why robust character traits that could qualify\nas virtues are so rare, we should consider the perspective that very\nmuch informs the self-cultivation projects of Confucius and his\nstudents. They were very much aware of the lack of virtue as a social\nand political condition and not merely as an individual condition that\njust happened to be widespread (Hutton 2006 makes this point). There\nis a reason why Confucius and Mencius after him sought to have kings\nadopt their teachings. If in fact the achievement of robust virtues\nrequires long and hard training, supported and guided by others who\nhave taken similar paths before, and if as Mencius 1A7 holds, people\ncannot engage in such training until they have the material security\nthat enables them to take their minds off the sheer task of survival,\nthen it is no mystery at all why there are no such traits in societies\nstructured to achieve very different goals. Ironically, the\nsituationist psychological experiments do not take into account this\nunderlying relational factor that might deeply influence the ability\nof people to form robust virtues, and neither do the philosophical\ncritics of virtue ethics who rely on the situationist experimental\nevidence.\n",
