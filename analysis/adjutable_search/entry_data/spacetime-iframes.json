    "preamble": "\n\nA \u201cframe of reference\u201d is a standard relative to which\nmotion and rest may be measured; any set of points or objects that are\nat rest relative to one another enables us, in principle, to describe\nthe relative motions of bodies. A frame of reference is therefore a\npurely kinematical device, for the geometrical description of motion\nwithout regard to the masses or forces involved. A dynamical account\nof motion leads to the idea of an \u201cinertial frame,\u201d or a\nreference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamical\nproperties. For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood as\na spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time,\nso that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions.\nThe laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition: an\ninertial frame is a reference-frame with a time-scale, relative to\nwhich the motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinear\nand uniform, accelerations are always proportional to and in the\ndirection of applied forces, and applied forces are always met with\nequal and opposite reactions. It follows that, in an inertial frame,\nthe center of mass of a closed system of interacting bodies is always\nat rest or in uniform motion. It also follows that any other frame of\nreference moving uniformly relative to an inertial frame is also an\ninertial frame. For example, in Newtonian celestial mechanics, taking\nthe \u201cfixed stars\u201d as a frame of reference, we can, in\nprinciple, determine an (approximately) inertial frame whose center is\nthe center of mass of the solar system; relative to this frame, every\nacceleration of every planet can be accounted for (approximately) as a\ngravitational interaction with some other planet in accord with\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion.\n\nThis appears to be a simple and straightforward concept. By inquiring\nmore narrowly into its origins and meaning, however, we begin to\nunderstand why it has been an ongoing subject of philosophical\nconcern. It originated in a profound philosophical consideration of\nthe principles of relativity and invariance in the context of\nNewtonian mechanics. Further reflections on it, in different\ntheoretical contexts, had extraordinary consequences for\n20th-century theories of space and time.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Relativity and reference frames in classical mechanics\n1.1 The origins of Galilean relativity\n\nThe term \u201creference frame\u201d was coined in the\n19th century, but it has a long prehistory, beginning,\nperhaps, with the emergence of the Copernican theory. The significant\npoint was not the replacement of the earth by the sun as the center of\nall motion in the universe, but the recognition of both the earth and\nthe sun as merely possible points of view from which the motions of\nthe celestial bodies may be described. This implied that the basic\ntask of Ptolemaic astronomy\u2014to represent the planetary motions\nby combinations of circular motions\u2014could take any point to be\nfixed, without sacrificing predictive power. Therefore, as Copernicus\nsuggested in the opening arguments of On the Revolutions of the\nHeavenly Spheres, the choice of any particular point required\nsome justification on grounds other than mere successful astronomical\nprediction. The most persuasive grounds, seemingly, were physical: we\ndon\u2019t perceive the physical effects that we would expect the\nearth\u2019s motion to produce. Copernicus himself noted, however, in\nreply, that we can indeed undergo motions that are physically\nimperceptible, as on a smoothly moving ship (1543, p.6). At least in\nsome circumstances, we can easily treat our moving point of view as if\nit were at rest. \n\nAs the basic programme of Ptolemy and Copernicus gave way to that of\nearly classical mechanics as developed by Galileo, this equivalence of\npoints of view was made more precise and explicit. Galileo was unable\nto present a decisive argument for the motion of the earth around the\nsun. He demonstrated, however, that the Copernican view does not\ncontradict our experience of a seemingly stable earth. He accomplished\nthis through a principle that, in the precise form that it takes in\nNewtonian mechanics, has become known as the \u201cprinciple of\nGalilean relativity\u201d: mechanical experiments will have the same\nresults in a system in uniform motion that they have in a system at\nrest. Arguments against the motion of the earth had typically appealed\nto experimental evidence\u2014e.g., that a stone dropped from a tower\nfalls to the base of the tower, instead of being left behind as the\nearth rotates during its fall. But Galileo argued persuasively that\nsuch experiments would happen just as they do whether the earth were\nmoving or not, provided that the motion is sufficiently uniform. (See\nFigure 1.) Galileo\u2019s account of this was not precisely the\nprinciple that we call \u201cGalilean relativity\u201d; he seems to\nhave thought that a system in uniform circular motion, such as a frame\nat rest on the rotating earth, would be indistinguishable from a frame\ntruly at rest. The principle was named in his honor because he had\ngrasped the underlying idea of dynamical equivalence: he understood\nthe composition of motion, and understood how individual motions of\nbodies within a system\u2014such as the fall of a stone from a\ntower\u2014are composed with the motion of the system as a whole.\nThis principle of composition, combined with the idea that bodies\nmaintain their uniform motion, formed the basis for the idea of\ndynamically indistinguishable frames of reference. \n\n\n\nFigure 1: Galileo\u2019s Argument If\nthe earth is rotating sufficiently uniformly, a stone dropped from the\ntower will fall straight to the base, just as a stone dropped from the\nmast of a uniformly moving ship will fall to the foot of the mast. In\nboth cases the stone\u2019s vertical motion will be smoothly composed\nwith its horizontal motion. Hence a sufficiently uniform motion will\nbe indistinguishable from rest.\n\n1.2 Philosophical controversy over absolute and relative motion\n\nLeibniz, later, articulated a more general \u201cequipollence of\nhypotheses\u201d: in any system of interacting bodies, any hypothesis\nthat any particular body is at rest is equivalent to any other.\nTherefore neither Copernicus\u2019 nor Ptolemy\u2019s view can be\ntrue\u2014though one may be judged simpler than the\nother\u2014because both are merely possible hypothetical\ninterpretations of the same relative motions. This principle clearly\ndefines (what we would call) a set of reference frames. They differ in\ntheir arbitrary choices of a resting point or origin, but agree on the\nrelative positions of bodies at any moment and their changing relative\ndistances through time.\n\nFor Leibniz and many others, this general equivalence was a matter of\nphilosophical principle, founded in the metaphysical conviction that\nspace itself is nothing more than an abstraction from the geometrical\nrelations among bodies. In some form or other it was a widely shared\ntenet of the 17th-century \u201cmechanical\nphilosophy\u201d. Yet it was flatly incompatible with physics as\nLeibniz himself, and the other \u201cmechanists,\u201d actually\nconceived it. For the basic program of mechanical explanation depended\nessentially on the concept of a privileged state of motion, as\nexpressed in the common assumption that was the forerunner of the\n\u201cprinciple of inertia\u201d: bodies maintain a state of\nrectilinear motion until acted upon by an external cause. Thus their\nfundamental conception of force, as the power of a body to change the\nstate of another, likewise depended on this notion of a privileged\nstate. This dependence was clearly exhibited in the vortex theory of\nplanetary motion, which presupposed that any planet would move in a\nstraight line unless impeded. Its actual orbit was therefore explained\nby the balance between the planet\u2019s inherent centrifugal\ntendency (its tendency to follow the tangent to the orbit) and the\npressure of the surrounding medium.\n\nFor this reason, the notion of a dispute between\n\u201crelativists\u201d or \u201crelationists\u201d and\n\u201cabsolutists\u201d or \u201csubstantivalists\u201d, in the\n17th century, is a drastic oversimplification. Newton, in\nhis controversial Scholium on space, time, and motion, was not merely\nasserting that motion is absolute in the face of the mechanists\u2019\nrelativist view. He was arguing that a conception of absolute motion\nwas already implicit in the views of his opponents\u2014that it was\nimplicit in their conception, which he largely shared, of physical\ncause and effect. The general equivalence of reference-frames was\nimplicitly denied by a physics that characterized forces as powers to\nchange the states of motion of bodies.\n\nThis development placed the subject of reference frames in a new\ntheoretical context. Having set aside the reference frame of common\nsense\u2014the frame in which the earth is at rest in the center,\nwith the heavens revolving around it\u2014the mechanical physics of\nthis time naturally tied this subject with novel theoretical\nconceptions of motion, and its physical causes and effects. Copernicus\nargued for a heliocentric system, not from a physical theory of\nmotion, but from the comparative simplicity and reasonableness that it\nintroduced into astronomy; he worked within the established theory of\nthe causes of celestial motions, namely, the revolutions of the\nheavenly spheres. After Copernicus, however\u2014more precisely,\nafter the model of revolving spheres was largely\nabandoned\u2014determining the right frame of reference was connected\nwith discovering the true physical causes of the planets\u2019\nmotions. Philosophers such as Kepler, Descartes, Huygens, Leibniz, and\nNewton held vastly differing views of physical causation, motion. and\nthe relativity of motion. They agreed, however, that the heliocentric\npicture was uniquely suited for giving a causal account of planetary\nmotions, as the effects of physical actions originating in the sun. To\nKepler and Descartes, for example, the rotation of the sun on its\naxis, in the same sense in which the planets revolved, identified it\nas the cause of those revolutions.\n\nThe link between the causal account of motion and the more general\nconceptual account of \u201ctrue\u201d motion was never obvious or\nstraightforward. Descartes\u2019s heliocentric causal account, in\nwhich the planets moved in vortices arising from the sun\u2019s\nrotation, was disconnected from his abstract account of motion\n\u201caccording to the truth of the matter,\u201d or \u201cin the\nproper sense\u201d (Descartes 1642, part II section XXV). Since there\nare innumerable objects to which one might refer the motion of any\ngiven body, the reference may appear to be a matter of arbitrary\nchoice. The unambiguous reference for the motion of any body, he\nargued, is provided by the bodies immediately touching it. Newton, in\nresponse, argued that Descartes\u2019s philosophical account of\nmotion is flatly incompatible with his causal account. To Newton, it\nwas incoherent to appeal to a causal account of motion when explaining\nthe centrifugal tendency of a body in its orbit around the sun, while\nidentifying its \u201cproper\u201d motion only by its relations to\nthe bodies immediately contiguous to it (Newton 1684a, Stein 1967,\nRynasiewicz 2014). Hence Newton\u2019s argument that the only\nunambiguous standard of motion is a body\u2019s change of position\nwith respect to space itself. To space understood in this sense, as\nthe universal frame of reference with respect to which the\ndisplacements of bodies constitute their true motions, Newton gave the\nname \u201cabsolute space\u201d (1687b, p. 5ff). \n\nEvidently Newton was aware that \u201cabsolute space\u201d was not a\nreference frame in any practical sense. He emphasized that \u201cthe\nparts of space cannot be seen,\u201d and that no observable bodies\ncan be known to be at rest. Hence there is no way to determine motion\nwith respect to space by direct observation; it must be known by its\n\u201cproperties, causes, and effects\u201d (1687b, p. 7\u20138).\nThe question arises, then, what properties, causes, or effects\nindicate a body\u2019s change of position in absolute space? It is\nconceivable, for example, that there might be some physical correlate\nfor velocity, in the sense that a body might have some observable\nphysical state that depends on its velocity. It follows, in that case,\nthat a body would be in a distinct physical state when it is at rest\nin space. If a body could be known to be in that state, therefore, it\nwould (in principle) provide a physical marker for a truly resting\nframe of reference. On Leibniz\u2019s conception of force, for\ninstance, a given force is required to generate or to maintain a given\nvelocity. For objects \u201cpassively\u201d resist motion, but\nmaintain their states of motion only by \u201cactive\u201d\nforce\u2014so that, on dynamical grounds, \u201cevery body truly\ndoes have a certain amount of motion, or, if you will, force\u201d\n(Leibniz 1694, p. 184; see also 1716, p. 404). It would follow from\nthis that there must be, in principle, a distinguished frame of\nreference in which the velocities of bodies correspond to their true\nvelocities, i.e. to the amounts of moving force that they truly\npossess. It would also follow that, with respect to any frame that is\nin motion relative to this one, bodies will not have their true\nvelocities. In short, such a conception of force, if it could be\napplied physically, would give a precise physical application of\nNewton\u2019s conception of absolute space, by providing a physical\ncorrelate for change of absolute place. \n1.3 Galilean relativity in Newtonian physics\n\nThe difficulty with Newton\u2019s view of absolute space comes, not\nfrom the epistemological arguments of relationalism, but from\nNewton\u2019s own conception of force. If force is defined and\nmeasured solely by the power to accelerate a body, then obviously the\neffects of forces\u2014in short, the causal interactions within a\nsystem of bodies\u2014will be independent of the velocity of the\nsystem in which they are measured. So the existence of a set of\nequivalent \u201cinertial frames\u201d is imposed from the start by\nNewton\u2019s laws. Suppose that we determine for the bodies in a\ngiven frame of reference\u2014say, the rest frame of the fixed\nstars\u2014that all observable accelerations are proportional to\nforces impressed by bodies within the system, by equal and opposite\nactions and reactions among those bodies. Then we know that these\nphysical interactions will be the same in any frame of reference that\nis in uniform rectilinear motion relative to the first one. Therefore\nno Newtonian experiment will be able to determine the velocity of a\nbody, or system of bodies, relative to absolute space. In other words,\nthere is no way to distinguish absolute space itself from any frame of\nreference that is in uniform motion relative to it. Newton thought\nthat a coherent account of force and motion requires a background\nspace consisting of \u201cplaces\u201d that \u201cfrom infinity to\ninfinity maintain given positions with respect to one another\u201d\n(1687b, p. 8\u20139). But the laws of motion enable us to determine\nan infinity of such spaces, all in uniform rectilinear motion relative\nto each other. The laws furnish no way of singling out any one as\n\u201cimmovable space.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, no one in the 17th century, or even before\nthe late 19th century, expressed this equivalence of\nreference-frames any more clearly than Newton himself. However, the\ncredit for articulating this equivalence precisely for the first time,\nbelongs to Christiaan Huygens, who introduced it as one of the\nHypotheses of his first work on the rules of impact (1656).\n\u201cHypothesis I\u201d was the first clear statement of the\nprinciple of inertia: \u201cAny body, once in motion, if nothing\nopposes it, continues to move always with the same velocity and along\nthe same straight line\u201d (1656, pp. 30\u201331). The first\nprecise statement of the relativity principle followed as Hypothesis\nIII: \n\nThe motion of bodies, and their speeds equal or unequal, are to be\nunderstood respectively, in relation to other bodies which are\nconsidered as at rest, even though perhaps both the former and the\nlatter are subject to another motion that is common to them. In\nconsequence, when two bodies collide with one another, even if both\ntogether undergo another equable motion, they will move each other no\ndifferently, with respect to a body that is carried by the same common\nmotion, than if this extraneous motion were absent from all of them.\n(1656, p. 32).\n\n\nHuygens illustrated this principle by the example of an impact that\ntakes place on a uniformly moving boat, asserting its equivalence to\nthe same impact taking place at rest. Thus he made precise the\nargument of Galileo, in light of his more precise understanding of the\nprinciple of inertia and the dynamical difference between inertial and\ncircular motion.\n\nNewton\u2019s first statement of the same principle appears in one of\nthe series of papers that culminated in the Principia,\n\u201cDe motu sph\u00e6ricorum corporum in fluidis\u201d (1684b).\nLike Huygens, Newton presents the relativity principle as a\nfundamental principle, \u201cLaw 3\u201d: \n\nThe motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among\nthemselves whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly in a\nstraight line without circular motion. (1684b, p. 40r)\n\n\nNewton\u2019s first statement of the Galilean relativity principle\nevidently recapitulates Huygens\u2019 version, which was probably\nknown to Newton. The same may be said of \u201cLaw 4\u201d in this\nmanuscript, the principle of conservation of the center of gravity:\n\n\nBy the mutual actions between bodies their common centre of gravity\ndoes not change its state of motion or rest. (ibid., p. 40r)\n\n\nBut, uniquely, Newton immediately went on to consider the deeper\ntheoretical significance of these principles: they radically\nreconceptualize the problem of \u201ctrue motion\u201d in the\nplanetary system. First, they implied that the entire system must be\nseen as included in a space that may, itself, be either at rest or in\nuniform motion. Second, they implied that the only truly fixed point\nin such a system is the center of gravity of the relevant bodies.\nThis, too, may therefore be in uniform motion or at rest:\n\nMoreover the whole space of the planetary heavens either rests (as is\ncommonly believed) or moves uniformly in a straight line, and hence\nthe communal centre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) either rests\nor moves along with it. In both cases (by Law 3) the relative motions\nof the planets are the same, and their common centre of gravity rests\nin relation to the whole space, and so can certainly be taken for the\nstill centre of the whole planetary system. (ibid., p. 47r)\n\n\nNewton now realized, in short, that the dispute between the\nheliocentric and geocentric views of the universe had been mistakenly\nframed. The proper question about \u201cthe system of the\nworld\u201d was not \u201cwhich body is at rest in the\ncenter?\u201d but \u201cwhere is the center of gravity of the\nsystem, and which body is closest to it?\u201d For in a system of\norbiting bodies, only their common center of gravity will be\nunaccelerated, and by \u201cLaw 3\u201d, the motions of the bodies\nin the system will be the same, whether its center of gravity is at\nrest or in uniform rectilinear motion. By explicitly asserting the\ndynamical equivalence of \u201cwhole spaces\u201d that may moving\nuniformly or at rest, Newton made it clear that the solution to the\nproblem of \u201cthe system of the world\u201d is the same with\nrespect to any such moving space as it is with respect to immobile\nspace. Thus he came as close to articulating the concept of the\ninertial frame as anyone before the late 19th century.\n\nIn the successive drafts of his Principia, Newton gradually\nclarified its conceptual structure, and in particular the\nframe-independent character of its concepts of motion, force, and\ninteraction. He arrived at the new axiomatic structure whose only laws\nare the familiar \u201cNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion\u201d; the\nprinciple of the conservation of the center of gravity, and the\nrelativity principle, were no longer presupposed, but derived from the\nLaws as Corollaries IV and V:\n\nCorollary IV: The common center of gravity of bodies does not change\nits state, whether of motion or rest, by the actions of those bodies\namong themselves; therefore the common centre of gravity of all bodies\n(external impediments excluded) rests or moves uniformly in a straight\nline (1687b, p. 17).\n\n\nCorollary V: When bodies are enclosed in a given space, their motions\namong themselves are the same whether the space is at rest, or whether\nit is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion\n(1687b, p. 19).\n\n\nThese principles illuminate the relationship between the theory of\nabsolute space, as articulated in Newton\u2019s Scholium to the\nDefinitions, and the overarching scientific problem of the\nPrincipia. According to Newton, \u201cthe aim for which I\ncomposed\u201d the book was to show \u201chow to gather the true\nmotions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences, and\nconversely, from the motions, true or apparent, to gather their causes\nand effects\u201d (1687b, p. 11); the more specific aim of Book III\nwas \u201cto exhibit the constitution of the system of the\nworld\u201d (1687b, p. 401). \n\nOn the one hand, Corollary V, like \u201cLaw 3\u201d in De Motu,\nprecisely restricts what Newton\u2019s procedure can determine about\nthe structure of the system of the world. It cannot determine anything\nabout the velocity of the system as a whole; it can only determine the\nposition of the center of gravity of the bodies that comprise it, and\nthe configuration of those bodies with respect to that center. In this\nsense it can, in principle, decide between a Keplerian and a Tychonic\ninterpretation of the motions of these bodies. The system is indeed\napproximately Keplerian: the sun has by far the greatest mass and is\ntherefore little disturbed from the center of gravity by its\ninteractions with the planets. The sun therefore remains very close to\nthe common focus of the nearly Keplerian ellipses in which the planets\norbit the sun. But by Corollary V, the actions of the bodies among\nthemselves would not reveal whether their center was moving uniformly\nor at rest. On the other hand, Newton recognized that motion with\nrespect to absolute space is unknowable. This restriction, therefore,\nmeant that the solution to the system of the world is secure in spite\nof our ignorance. The nearly-Keplerian structure of the system is\nknown completely independently of the system\u2019s state of motion\nin absolute space.\n\nThe Galilean relativity principle thus contained, in Newton\u2019s\nconception, a broader insight: that different states of uniform\nmotion, or different uniformly-moving frames of reference, determine\nonly different points of view on the same physically objective\nquantities, namely force, mass, and acceleration. We can see this\ninsight expressed more explicitly in the evolution of Newton\u2019s\nconcept of inertia. The term had been introduced by Kepler, and played\na central role in his physical conception of planetary motion.\nRejecting the Aristotelian idea that the planets are carried by\nrotating crystalline spheres, Kepler held that the planets have a\nnatural tendency to rest in space\u2014what he called their natural\ninertia\u2014and argued that they must be moved by active powers that\novercome their natural inertia. Newton, well before working on\nPrincipia, had based his conception of inertia on the idea of\nGalileo and Huygens, that bodies tend to persist in uniform motion:\nInertia, on this new conception, was a resistance to change in motion.\nEven so, Newton\u2019s early understanding of inertia was essentially\npre-relativistic, because it implied a conceptual distinction between\na body\u2019s power to resist external forces, and the power of a\nmoving body to change the motion of another. The manuscript De\ngravitatione et aequipondio fluidorum (1684a), for example, was\nevidently written before Newton fully recognized the importance of the\nrelativity principle; here Newton\u2019s Definitions distinguish\n\u201cconatus,\u201d \u201cimpetus,\u201d and\n\u201cinertia\u201d as conceptually separate properties:\n\nDefinition 6: Conatus (endeavor) is impeded force, or force in so far\nas it is resisted.\n\n\nDefinition 7: Impetus is force in so far as it is impressed on\nanother.\n\n\nDefinition 8: Inertia is the internal force of a body, so that its\nstate may not be easily changed by an external force (1684a).\n\n\nLeibniz (among others), as we saw, made a corresponding distinction:\nmoving force, the power of a body to change the motion of another, was\ndetermined by velocity. Leibniz therefore distinguished this force as\nan active power, fundamentally different from the passive power of a\nresting body to resist any change of position. Newton, in contrast, as\nhe developed the Principia, and recognized the existence of a\nclass of indistinguishable relative spaces, gradually came to\nunderstand the \u201cforce of inertia\u201d as what we would call a\nGalilei-invariant quantity. Impetus and resistance were therefore\nrecognized as appearances of that invariant quantity in different\nframes of reference:\n\nA body truly exerts this force only in a change of its state brought\nabout by another force impressed upon it, and the exercise of this\nforce is, under different aspects, both resistance and impetus:\nresistance in so far as the body, to maintain its state, opposes the\nimpressed force; impetus insofar as the same body, yielding only with\ndifficulty to the force of a resisting obstacle, strives to change the\nstate of that obstacle. Resistance is commonly attributed to resting\nbodies and impetus to moving bodies; but motion and rest, as commonly\nunderstood, are only relatively distinguished from each other; and\nbodies commonly seen as resting are not always truly at rest (1687b,\np. 2).\n\n\nThere are two noteworthy points about this explication of inertia.\nFirst, it shows that Newton recognized properties that were commonly\nregarded as distinct (e.g. in the Leibnizian distinction between\npassive and active) as merely frame-dependent representations of the\nsame fundamental property. That is, they represent the same invariant\nquantity seen from different points of view. The principle that a body\nexerts this force \u201conly in a change of its state\u201d\ndecisively separates Newton\u2019s new view from the older notion of\na specific power that is required to maintain a body in motion. This\nchange has been noted by modern commentators (see Herivel 1965, p. 26;\nsee also DiSalle 2013, p. 453; Disalle 2017, in Other Internet\nResources). But it was already noted in Newton\u2019s own time by\nGeorge Berkeley, who emphasized the contrast between Newton\u2019s\nconception and that of Leibniz:\n\nLeibniz confuses impetus with motion. According to Newton, impetus is\nin truth the same as the force of inertia\u2026 (Berkeley 1721\n[1992], p.  79)\n\n\n\u2026it is established by experience that it is a primary law of\nnature that a body persists \u201cin a state of motion or of rest as\nlong as nothing happens from elsewhere to change that state,\u201d\nand therefore it is inferred that the force of inertia is under\ndifferent aspects either resistance or impetus, in this sense a\nbody can indeed be said to be by nature indifferent to motion and\nrest. (Berkeley, 1721 [1992], p.  96)\n\n\nBerkeley thus made clear that the older understanding of inertia,\nunlike that expressed in the Principia, did not respect the\nprinciple of relativity. Second, Newton\u2019s explication implicitly\ninvokes all three laws of motion (cf. Stein 2002). Newton\u2019s\nfirst law alone came to be identified as \u201cthe principle of\ninertia.\u201d Newton himself, however, understood that inertia has\nthree inseparable aspects: the tendency to persist in motion, the\nresistance to change in motion, and the power to react against an\nimpressed force. All are essential to the explication of inertial mass\nas a measurable theoretical quantity. To many later commentators,\nNewton\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cforce of inertia\u201d\nsuggested a conceptual confusion. On the contrary, it was\nNewton\u2019s way of drawing attention to the precise role of\ninertial mass as an invariant quantity in physical interactions,\nunderlying the various ways in which its manifestations had been\npreviously conceived.\n1.4 The lingering problem of absolute space\n\nNewton understood the Galilean principle of relativity with a degree\nof depth and clarity that eluded most of his \u201crelativist\u201d\ncontemporaries and critics. It may seem bizarre, therefore, that the\nnotion of inertial frame did not emerge until more than a century and\na half after his death. He had identified a distinguished class of\ndynamically equivalent \u201crelative spaces,\u201d in any of which\ntrue forces and masses, accelerations and rotations, would have the\nsame objectively measured values. Yet these spaces, though dynamically\nequivalent and empirically indistinguishable, were yet not equivalent\nin principle. Evidently, Newton conceived them as moving with various\nvelocities in absolute space, though those velocities could not be\nknown. Why should not he, or someone, have recognized the equivalence\nof these spaces, and the dispensability of a distinguished resting\nspace\u2014\u201cabsolute\u201d space\u2014immediately?\n\nThis is not the place for an adequate answer to this question, if\nindeed one is possible. For much of the 20th century, the\naccepted answer was that of Ernst Mach: Newton lived in an age\n\u201cdeficient in epistemological critique.\u201d He was therefore\nunable to draw the conclusion that these dynamically\nindistinguishable spaces must be equivalent in every\nmeaningful sense, so that no one of them deserves even in principle to\nbe designated as \u201cabsolute space.\u201d Yet even those whom the\n20th century credited with more sophisticated\nepistemological views, such as Leibniz, evidently had difficulties\nunderstanding force and inertia in a Galilei-invariant way, despite a\nphilosophical commitment to relativity. We may plausibly suppose that\nit was difficult to abandon the intuitive association of force or\nmotion with velocity in space. It must also have been difficult, in\nthe mathematical context of Newton\u2019s time, to conceive of an\nequivalence-class structure as the fundamental spatio-temporal\nframework. It required a level of abstraction that became possible\nonly with the extraordinary development of mathematics, especially of\na more abstract view of geometry, that took place in the\n19th century. Newton\u2019s arguments established, for the\nassumptions of classical dynamics, the need for a dynamical space-time\nstructure beyond the kinematical structure required to represent\nchanges of relative position over time. But absolute space, with its\nsuperfluous elements, was the only such structure imagined for the\nnext two centuries. It was accepted as the only realistic alternative\nto theories with no dynamical structure at all. There was as yet no\nnotion of a structure that expressed all and only what was\nrequired by the dynamical laws. Euler, for example, in a penetrating\ncritique of Leibnizian relationalism (1748), argued that the laws of\nmotion require a notion of sameness of direction in space, and of\nuniform motion with respect to time. The truth of the laws of\nmotion\u2014which, for Euler, were more securely established than any\nprinciple of metaphysics\u2014could not, therefore, be reconciled\nwith any account of space and time as merely ideal. But he did not see\nthe possibility of separating true acceleration and rotation from true\nvelocity with respect to absolute space. \n\nIn the 17th century, only Huygens came close to expressing\nsuch a view; he held that not velocity, but velocity-difference, was\nthe fundamental dynamical quantity. He therefore understood, for\nexample, that the \u201cabsoluteness\u201d of rotation had nothing\nto do with velocity relative to absolute space. Instead, it arose from\nthe difference of velocity among different parts of a rotating body.\nIf a disk is translated through space without rotation, then its parts\nmove in parallel lines, but if it is rotating, then they move in\ndifferent directions, even though they are at rest relative to one\nanother on account of the bonds holding them together. The\ndifferences, evidently, would be the same irrespective of the velocity\nof the body as a whole in absolute space. Unfortunately, Huygens\nexpressed this view only in manuscripts that remained unpublished for\ntwo centuries. (Cf. Stein, 1977, pp. 9\u201310 and Appendix III.)\nHuygens also reflected on the possibility of replacing absolute space\nwith (what we would call) empirical frames of reference, again in\nunpublished notes that have only been brought to light in recent work\nby Stan (2016). But the complete concept of the inertial frame emerged\nonly in the late 19th century, when it did not seem to be\nof any great immediate importance (see below). Indeed, even after the\nconcept of inertial frame had been widely discussed, the notion\npersisted that true rotation could only be understood as rotation with\nrespect to absolute space. Poincar\u00e9, for example, convinced of\nthe essential \u201crelativity of space\u201d as well as the\nrelativity of motion, considered the concept of absolute space to be\nsomething of a philosophical embarrassment. But it was not clear to\nhim how the dynamical phenomena of rotation could be understood\nwithout it (cf. DiSalle 2014). So the failure of Newton and Huygens to\nformulate the concept of inertial frame, two centuries earlier, seems\nless remarkable than the progress that each of them made in\nunderstanding the relativity of motion. As we will see, articulating\nthis concept involved synthesizing (in effect) insights of Newton,\nHuygens, and Euler.\n1.5 19th-century analyses of the law of inertia\n\nThe development of this concept began with a renewed critical analysis\nof the notion of absolute space, for reasons not anticipated by\nNewton\u2019s contemporary critics. Its starting point was a critical\nquestion about the law of inertia: relative to what is the motion of a\nfree particle uniform and rectilinear? If the answer is\n\u201cabsolute space,\u201d then the law would appear to be\nsomething other than an empirical claim, for no one can observe the\ntrajectory of a particle relative to absolute space. Two quite\ndifferent answers to the question were offered in 1870, in the form of\nrevised statements of the law of inertia. Carl Neumann proposed that\nwhen we state the law, we must suppose that there is a body somewhere\nin the universe\u2014the \u201cbody Alpha\u201d\u2014with respect\nto which the motion of a free particle is rectilinear, and that there\nis a time-scale somewhere relative to which it is uniform (Neumann\n1870). Ernst Mach (1883) claimed that the law of inertia, and\nNewton\u2019s laws generally, implicitly appeal to the fixed stars as\na spatial reference-frame, and to the rotation of the earth as a\ntime-scale. At any rate, he maintained, such is the basis for any\ngenuine empirical content that the laws can claim. The notion of\nabsolute space, it followed, was only an unwarranted abstraction from\nthe practice of measuring motions relative to the fixed stars.\n\nMach\u2019s proposal had the advantage of a clear empirical\nmotivation; Neumann\u2019s \u201cbody Alpha\u201d seemed no less\nmysterious than absolute space, and almost sounds comical to the\nmodern reader. But Neumann\u2019s discussion of a time-scale was\nsomewhat more fruitful, and employed the principle that Euler had\nalready expressed (1748): the law of inertia defines a time-scale, by\nwhich equal intervals of time are those in which a free particle\ntravels equal distances. He also noted, however, that this definition\nis quite arbitrary. For, in the absence of a prior definition of equal\ntimes, any motion whatever can be stipulated to be uniform. It is no\nhelp to appeal to the requirement of freedom from external forces,\nsince the free particles presumably are known to us only by their\nuniform motion. We have a genuine empirical claim only when we state\nof at least two free particles that their motions are\nmutually proportional. Equal intervals of time can then be\ndefined as those in which two free particles travel mutually\nproportional distances.\n1.6 The emergence of the concept of inertial frame\n\nNeumann\u2019s definition of a time-scale directly inspired Ludwig\nLange\u2019s conception of \u201cinertial system\u201d (Lange\n1885). An inertial coordinate system ought to be one in which free\nparticles move in straight lines. But any trajectory may be stipulated\nto be rectilinear, and a coordinate system can always be constructed\nin which it is rectilinear. And so, as in the case of the time-scale,\nwe cannot adequately define an inertial system by the motion of one\nparticle. Indeed, for any two particles moving anyhow, a coordinate\nsystem may be found in which both their trajectories are rectilinear.\nSo far the claim that either particle, or some third particle, is\nmoving in a straight line may be said to be a matter of convention. We\nmust define an inertial system as one in which at least three free\nparticles move in straight lines. Then we can state the law of inertia\nas the claim that, relative to an inertial system so defined, the\nmotion of any fourth particle, or arbitrarily many particles, will be\nrectilinear. The notions of inertial system and Neumann\u2019s\ntime-scale, which Lange called an \u201cinertial time-scale,\u201d\nmay be combined as follows: relative to a coordinate system in which\nthree free particles move in straight lines and travel\nmutually-proportional distances, the motion of any fourth free\nparticle will be rectilinear and uniform. The questionable Newtonian\nconcepts of absolute rotation and acceleration, Lange proposed, could\nnow be replaced by the concepts of \u201cinertial rotation\u201d and\n\u201cinertial acceleration,\u201d i.e. rotation and acceleration\nrelative to an inertial system and inertial time-scale. See Figures 2\nand 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(a)\n(b) \n\n\nFigure 2: Neumann\u2019s Time-Scale By\nNewton\u2019s first law, a particle not subject to forces travels\nequal distances in equal times. But which particles are free of\nforces? This might appear to be a matter of convention.\n\n(a) Either \\(P_1\\) or \\(P_2\\) can be arbitrarily stipulated to be at\nthe origin of a system of coordinates, and to serve as the measure of\nequal times\n\n(b) But one can say of two particles with different velocities: in\nintervals of time in which one moves a given distance \\(d_1\\), the\nother moves a proportional distance \\(d_2 = kd_1\\) (where k is\na constant; i.e., \\(d_1/d_2 = k\\)). Or one can compare a particle to a\nfreely rotating planet: in intervals of time through which the planet\nrotates through equal angles, the particle moves equal distances. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Lange\u2019s Definition of\n\u2018inertial system\u2019 (1885) An inertial system is a\ncoordinate system with respect to which three free particles,\nprojected from a single point and moving in non-coplanar directions,\nmove in straight lines and travel mutually-proportional distances. The\nlaw of inertia then states that relative to any inertial system, any\nfourth free particle will move uniformly. \n\n\nAt about the same time, apparently unaware of the work of Mach,\nNeumann, and Lange, James Thomson\u2014older brother of William\nThomson, Lord Kelvin\u2014expressed the content of the law of\ninertia, and the appropriate frame of reference and time-scale\n(\u201cdial-traveller\u201d), in a somewhat simpler manner:\n\nFor any set of bodies acted on each by any force, a REFERENCE FRAME\nand a REFERENCE DIAL-TRAVELLER are kinematically possible, such that\nrelatively to them conjointly, the motion of the mass-centre of each\nbody, undergoes change simultaneously with any infinitely short\nelement of the dial-traveller progress, or with any element during\nwhich the force on the body does not alter in direction nor in\nmagnitude, which change is proportional to the intensity of the force\nacting on that body, and to the simultaneous progress of the\ndial-traveller, and is made in the direction of the force. (Thomson\n1884, p. 387)\n\n\nThomson did not reject the term \u201cabsolute rotation\u201d.\nInstead, he held that it is properly defined as rotation relative to a\nframe that satisfies his definition of a reference frame. A body that\nis rotating with respect to a reference frame (and dial-traveller) is\nrotating with respect to any other frame in uniform motion relative to\nthe first. The definition does not express, as Lange\u2019s does, the\ndegree of arbitrariness involved in the construction of an inertial\nsystem by means of free particles. By dispensing with the idealization\nof free particles, Thomson\u2019s definition aims to characterize an\ninertial frame for an actual system of interacting bodies. However, it\ndoes not quite fulfill its aim. Like Lange\u2019s definition, it\nleaves out a crucial condition for an inertial system as we understand\nit: all forces must belong to action-reaction pairs. Otherwise we\ncould have, as on a rotating sphere, merely apparent (centrifugal)\nforces that are, by definition, proportional to mass and acceleration,\nand so the rotating sphere would satisfy Thomson\u2019s definition.\nTherefore the definition needs to be completed by the stipulation that\nto every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. (This\ncompletion was actually proposed by R.F. Muirhead in 1887.) \n\nBut, so completed, Thomson\u2019s definition makes the essential\npoint about the relation between Newton\u2019s laws of motion and the\ninertial frames: that the laws assert the existence of at least one\ninertial frame. If one inertial frame is posited, in which\naccelerations properly correspond to Newtonian forces, then any other\ninertial frame is in uniform motion with respect to the first; the\nforces, masses, and accelerations measured in one will have the same\nmeasures in any other. Any one may be arbitrarily designated as an\nall-encompassing \u201cimmobile space\u201d in which all others are\nmoving uniformly. Thus the original question, \u201crelative to what\nframe of reference do the laws of motion hold?\u201d is revealed to\nbe wrongly posed. For the laws of motion essentially\ndetermine a class of reference frames, and (in principle) a\nprocedure for constructing them. For the same reason, a skeptical\nquestion that is still commonly asked about the laws of\nmotion\u2014why is it that the laws are true only relative to a\ncertain choice of reference frame?\u2014is also wrongly posed. If\nNewton\u2019s laws are true, then we can construct an inertial frame;\ntheir truth doesn\u2019t depend on our ability to construct such a\nframe in advance. Mach expressed the situation particularly\nclearly:\n\nIt is very much the same whether we refer the laws of motion to\nabsolute space, or express them abstractly, without express indication\nof the system of reference. The latter course is unproblematic and\npractical, for in treating particular cases the student of mechanics\nlooks for a suitable system of reference. But owing to the fact that\nthe first way, whenever there was any actual issue at stake, was\nnearly always interpreted as having the same meaning as the latter,\nNewton\u2019s error was much less dangerous than it would otherwise\nhave been. (1933, p. 269.)\n\n\nMach\u2019s remark roughly corresponds to Newton\u2019s actual\nprocedure. Even though, for Newton, absolute space was the implicit\nreference-frame for stating the laws of motion, the frame for their\napplication was the standard one for most of the history of astronomy:\nthe fixed stars. This seemingly arbitrary starting-point did not\nundermine Newton\u2019s procedure as an account of the \u201ctrue\nmotions.\u201d For the framework of the fixed stars, initially taken\nfor granted, turns out to be justified in the course of Newton\u2019s\ndynamical analysis. If all the accelerations relative to the fixed\nstars can be analyzed into action-reaction pairs involving bodies\nwithin the system\u2014leaving no \u201cleftover\u201d\naccelerations that need to be traced to some yet-unknown\ninfluence\u2014then we can conclude that the stars are a suitable\n(sufficiently inertial) frame of reference after all. Newton could\nappeal to a particular case to test this general point: the orbits of\nthe outer planets were stable with respect to the fixed stars, their\nperihelia showing no measurable precession (unlike the perihelion of\nMercury, for a famous example). Newton argued, then, that a relative\nspace in which these apsides are stable is a sufficient approximation\nto a space at rest or in uniform motion (cf. Book III, Proposition\nXIV, 1687b, p. 420). \n\nMach took particular notice of Newton\u2019s use of the relativity\nprinciple in determining an appropriate reference-frame:\n\nIn order to have a generally valid system of reference, Newton\nintroduced Corollary V of the Principia. He thought\nof\u2026 a coordinate system for which the law of inertia holds,\nfixed in space without rotation relative to the fixed stars. He could\nalso allow an arbitrary origin and uniform translation of this\nsystem\u2026 without losing its usefulness\u2026 One can see that\nthe reduction to absolute space was in no way necessary, since the\nreference frame is just as relatively determined as in any other case.\n(1933, p. 227.)\n\n\nFor Mach, this was an important acknowledgement of Newton\u2019s\ninsight into the relativity of motion. Starting from Corollary V, the\nconcept of the inertial frame solved the problem of absolute rotation\nand acceleration, as a problem internal to the system of\nNewton\u2019s laws. Absolute space could be dispensed with, without\nundermining Newton\u2019s dynamical distinctions among states of\nmotion. Of course, this point did not dismiss Mach\u2019s skeptical\nquestions regarding the laws themselves. Instead, it posed them in a\nmore precise form: Are Newton\u2019s laws truly general laws of\nnature, that determine a class of privileged frames? Or do they only\ndescribe motions relative to a particular material frame, the fixed\nstars? Empirical evidence was insufficient to decide. Eventually\nMach\u2019s question helped to motivate Einstein\u2019s search for\nnew laws in which privileged frames would not play an essential role.\nFirst, however, by comparing Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell\u2019s\nelectrodynamics, Einstein placed the notion of inertial frame on an\nentirely new footing (see below,\n Section 2.2\net seq.). \n1.7 \u201cQuasi-inertial\u201d frames: Newton\u2019s Corollary VI\n\nA striking aspect of Newton\u2019s treatment of indistinguishable\nframes of reference was his discovery of approximately\nindistinguishable frames: spaces that are accelerating, yet can be\ntreated, for practical purposes, as if they were at rest or in uniform\nmotion. Newton made this notion precise in Corollary VI to the laws of\nmotion: \n\nIf bodies are moved in any way among themselves, and are urged by\nequal accelerative forces along parallel lines, they will all continue\nto move among themselves in the same way as if they were not acted on\nby those forces. (1687b, p. 20.)\n\n\nAs Corollaries IV and V implied, for a given system of interacting\nbodies, their center of gravity is unmoved by the actions of the\nbodies among themselves, and will remain at rest or in uniform motion\nas long as the bodies are not disturbed by any external forces. This,\nas we noted, was as close as Newton could come to the notion of an\ninertial frame. Corollary VI shows that, in very special ideal\ncircumstances\u2014accelerative forces that act equally on all bodies\nwithin a system, and accelerate them all in parallel\ndirections\u2014an accelerating system of bodies will behave,\ninternally, as if there were no external forces acting on it at all.\nYet Newton\u2019s discovery was not limited to the point made\nexplicitly in Corollary VI. Rather, it was threefold. The second point\nwas that there was in fact a force acting equally and in parallel\nlines, at least to a high approximation, on important systems of\ncelestial bodies. The system of Jupiter and its satellites, for\nexample, is obviously accelerating, as its center of gravity completes\nan approximately elliptical orbit around the Sun bound by accelerative\nforces toward the Sun\u2019s center. But because the accelerations of\nall the bodies are nearly equal and parallel, their motions among\nthemselves are nearly the same as if no such forces acted, and the\nsystem may be treated as the sort of system described in Corollary V.\nEvidently the accelerations are unequal, since Jupiter and the\nsatellites are at varying distances from the sun, and they cannot be\nparallel since they are all directed at the center of the sun. But\nthese differences of distance and direction are so small, in\ncomparison with the distance of the entire system from the sun, that\nthey may be neglected. And the same applies to the centripetal\nacceleration of Saturn\u2019s system. \n\nNewton applied this same reasoning to the entire solar system: even if\nthe entire system were accelerating toward some unknown gravitational\nsource, he could treat the solar system itself as if it were an\nisolated system. He argued, from the analysis of accelerations within\nthe system, that outside forces must be acting more or less equally\nand in parallel directions on all parts of the system.\n\nIt may be imagined that the sun and planets are impelled by some other\nforce equally and in the direction of parallel lines; but such a force\n(by Cor. VI of the Laws of Motion) would not change the situation of\nthe planets among themselves, nor would produce any sensible effect;\nbut we are concerned with the causes of sensible effects. Let us,\ntherefore, neglect every such force as precarious, and of no bearing\non the phenomena of the heavens\u2026. (1687a, article 13.)\n\n\nNewton raised this point in order to show that the possibility of such\na force acting on the whole solar system would not affect his\ncalculations of the forces acting within the system. In the\ncalculation relevant to this passage, Newton was using Corollary VI to\ndefend the inference that the force responsible for Jupiter\u2019s\norbit is directed to the Sun rather than to the Earth: neglecting any\nsuch imaginary force, \u201cthen all the remaining force by\nwhich\u2026 Jupiter is urged will tend (by prop. 3, corol. 1) toward\nthe center of the sun\u201d (ibid). This calculation formed an\nimportant step in the argument for a heliocentric system. Such a use\nof Corollary VI parallels, therefore, his use of Corollary V (and its\nearlier form, \u201cLaw 3\u201d) to show that the \u201cframe of\nthe system of the world\u201d could be determined without regard to\nthe system\u2019s uniform motion in absolute space. \n\nIndeed, the analogy between the two kinds of case helps to explain\nNewton\u2019s changing the relativity principle from a law to a\nCorollary, for this coincides historically with his first use of\nCorollary VI. The two Corollaries identify two classes of frames of\nreference that may be treated as equivalent, because they involve,\nrespectively, theoretically and practically indistinguishable states\nof motion. The frames corresponding to Corollary VI may be called\n\u201cquasi-inertial,\u201d because \u201capproximately\ninertial\u201d might be misleading: a closed orbit around the\nSun\u2014like that of Jupiter\u2019s system\u2014is not a good\napproximation to an inertial motion, and the system can hardly be\nconsidered isolated. But over sufficiently limited segments of its\norbit, its motion is sufficiently close to being inertial.\nMoreover\u2014and most important\u2014the accelerative forces toward\nthe sun are close enough to being equal and parallel that the forces\nacting within the system can be effectively isolated from the forces\nfrom without. Hence, while \u201cquasi-inertial\u201d is a useful\nterm for the reference-frame corresponding to such a group of bodies,\na useful description for the group itself is George Smith\u2019s\n\u201cquasi-insular system\u201d (Smith 2019). A system of masses\nbound in orbit around a larger mass is by no means isolated, yet in\nthe right conditions it may be treated as if it were. The modern term,\n\u201clocal inertial frame,\u201d is not inappropriate (cf. Schutz\n1990, p. 124). But it typically designates the local coordinate frame\nof a given inertial observer, rather than the sort of \u201cwhole\nspace\u201d that Newton had in mind, as encompassing a celestial\nsystem as large as that of Jupiter, or the solar system as a whole.\nMoreover, it is typically used in a context in which a global inertial\nframe, with respect to which any such Newtonian system has a definite\nacceleration, would not be assumed to exist. \n\nThis last point leads to the third point of Newton\u2019s discovery:\nthat the \u201cquasi-inertial\u201d system is part of a mathematical\nframework for approximative reasoning, to determine the precise degree\nof isolation that a group of interacting bodies may be said to\npossess. Proposition III of the Principia established\nNewton\u2019s method for treating a body orbiting a second body which\nis, itself, subject to a centripetal force:\n\nProposition III, Theorem III: Every body, that, by a radius drawn to\nthe centre of another body, in any way moved, describes areas about\nthat centre proportional to the times, is urged by a force compounded\nout of the centripetal force tending to that other body, and of all\nthe accelerative force by which that other body is impelled.(1687b, p.\n39).\n\n\nIn other words, if an orbiting body obeys Kepler\u2019s area law,\nthen any accelerative force acting on the central body is simply added\nto the centripetal force that maintains the orbiting body in its\norbit.\n\nThis principle of composition formed the mathematical basis for\nNewton\u2019s treatment of quasi-inertial frames. When a system of\nlesser bodies is, as a whole, revolving around a greater body, we have\na geometrical framework to describe how closely the motions of the\nlesser system approximate the conditions of Corollary VI:\n\nBook I, Proposition LXV, Case 2: Suppose that the accelerative\nattractions towards the greater body to be among themselves\nreciprocally as the squares of the distances; and then, by increasing\nthe distance of the great body till the differences of the straight\nlines drawn from that to the others in respect of their length, and\nthe inclinations of those lines to each other, are less than any\ngiven, then the motions of the parts of the system, will continue with\nno errors except such as are less than any given. And because, by the\nsmall distance of those parts from each other, the whole system is\nattracted as if it were only one body, it will therefore be moved by\nthis attraction as if it were one body\u2026.(1687b, p. 172.)\n\n\nThus the situation described by Corollary VI, in Newton\u2019s\nanalysis, emerges as a limiting case of an orbiting system under an\ninverse-square force. As the size of the orbit is arbitrarily\nincreased, the accelerations toward the center become\nindistinguishable from equal and parallel accelerations. Evidently,\nNewton\u2019s proposition provides, characteristically, a general\nmethod for treating a variety of possible configurations. But it\nenabled Newton to address the specific physical fact of the variation\nin the Sun\u2019s gravity, and its consequences for the superposition\nupon it of lesser gravitating systems. At the distance of Jupiter or\nSaturn, a revolving system can be a very nearly regular Keplerian\nsystem. As the distance to the Sun decreases, however, differences in\nmagnitude and direction of the accelerations become significant, and\nat the distance of the Earth-Moon system the motions become nearly\nintractable. The decisive factor is the proportion between the size of\nthe orbiting system and its distance from the center of attraction.\n\n\nThe actual existence of quasi-inertial frames, corresponding to the\nabstract cases of Proposition LXV, was a crucial part of\nNewton\u2019s argument for universal gravitation\u2014more\nprecisely, that the force holding the planets and their satellites in\ntheir respective orbits is, in fact, the same force as gravity. One\ncrucial ground for the identification was the fact that the\ninterplanetary force shares the most striking feature of terrestrial\ngravity, namely, that it imparts the same acceleration to all\nterrestrial bodies. This principle was discovered by Galileo, of\ncourse, but Newton tested it more severely, and with a greater variety\nof test bodies. He constructed pendulums of identical wooden boxes\nsuspended from strings of equal length, which he filled with different\nmaterials; he found that these differences made no difference to the\nspeed of falling over many oscillations of the pendulums. By this\nmeans he showed that Galileo\u2019s principle holds to a much higher\ndegree of accuracy than Galileo was able to show, and inferred that a\nbody\u2019s weight toward the earth is generally proportional to its\nmass. (1687b, Book III, Proposition VI). But Newton extended this\nprinciple beyond terrestrial gravity, to the accelerative forces\nacting on the planets and their satellites. Proposition IV, Corollary\nVI, from Book I, showed that an orbiting body that obeys\nKepler\u2019s third law is urged toward the center by an\ninverse-square force. Newton could then show that the centripetal\nforces acting on Jupiter\u2019s moons depend only on the\ninverse-square of the distance towards Jupiter\u2019s center: \n\nsince the satellites of Jupiter perform their revolutions in times\nthat observe the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from\nJupiter\u2019s center, their accelerative gravities towards Jupiter\nwill be inversely as the squares of their distances from\nJupiter\u2019s centre; that is, equal, at equal distances\u2026.\nAnd by the same argument, if the circumsolar planets were let fall at\nequal distances from the Sun, they would, in their descent towards the\nSun, describe equal spaces in equal times. But forces that equally\naccelerate unequal bodies must be as those bodies; that is to say, the\nweights of the planets towards the Sun must be as their quantities of\nmatter. (Ibid.)\n\n\nIn each of these cases, that is, Newton found that the centripetal\nacceleration behaves like gravitational acceleration, and so the\nbodies\u2019 forces toward their respective centers are, essentially,\ntheir weights toward those centers. Moreover, the orbits of\nJupiter\u2019s moons provided a completely novel test of\nGalileo\u2019s principle, on an extremely large scales of mass and\ndistance. For he showed that Jupiter and its moons\u2014within the\nlimits of observational accuracy\u2014undergo the same accelerations\ntoward the sun (cf. 1687b, Book I, Proposition 65; Book III,\nProposition VI). Any non-negligible difference in these accelerations\nwould produce corresponding irregularities in the satellites\u2019\norbits. \n\nThe proportionality of weight to mass was understood in its broader\nfoundational significance, as the equivalence of gravitational and\ninertial mass, through Einstein\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nequivalence\u201d (cf. Einstein 1916; see also Norton 1985). In\nEinstein\u2019s reasoning, the identity of inertia and gravitation\nhelped to undermine the special status of inertial motion, and\nsuggested the extension of the relativity principle from inertial\nframes to frames in any state of motion whatever. If an inertial\nframe, K, cannot be distinguished from another frame K\u2032 that is\nuniformly accelerated with respect to K, then K\u2032 may equally be\ntreated as a \u201cprivileged\u201d or \u201cstationary\u201d\nframe: \u201cthey have equal title as systems of reference for the\ndescription of physical phenomena\u201d (Einstein 1916, p. 114). This\ncircumstance undermines a defining characteristic of inertial frames:\nthat with respect to a given inertial frame, every other inertial\nframe is in uniform rectilinear motion. Corollary VI points the way,\nafter all, toward an extended relativity principle.\n\nThe assumption of the complete physical equivalence of the systems of\nco-ordinates, K and K\u2032, we call the \u201cprinciple of\nequivalence;\u201d this principle is evidently intimately connected\nwith the theorem of the equality between the inert and the\ngravitational mass, and signifies an extension of the principle of\nrelativity to co-ordinate systems which are in non-uniform motion\nrelatively to each other. In fact, through this conception we arrive\nat the unity of the nature of inertia and gravitation. (Einstein\n1922).\n\n\nThis reasoning, in turn, suggested the connection between the\ngravitational field and the curvature of space-time. (See Einstein\n1916; see also Related Entries:\n Einstein, Albert: philosophy of science |\n \n general relativity: early philosophical interpretations of).\n \n\nEven independently of Einstein\u2019s theory, however, one might see\nin hindsight that Newton\u2019s application of Corollary VI, and his\nidentification of what we\u2019ve been calling quasi-inertial frames,\nalready undermined the idea of an inertial frame. As we saw, Newton\ncould treat a quasi-inertial system like that of Jupiter and its\nmoons, not as essentially different from the system of the Earth and\nthe Moon, but as a limiting case of such a system: as the whole system\nbecomes sufficiently far from the central body, the differences among\nthe accelerations of its parts toward their common center become\nnegligibly small. In other words, Newton could treat such systems, and\nthe mathematical description of the differences among them, as\nrevealing the structure and workings of the sun\u2019s gravity,\nrather than as questioning the fundamental distinction between uniform\nand accelerated motion. In that sense, he was not proposing the\n\u201ccomplete physical equivalence\u201d of uniformly accelerating\nsystems with uniformly moving systems (inertial frames). But even\nNewton recognized, as we also saw, that the solar system as a whole\nmight have an unknown and practically unknowable acceleration. In\neffect, he explained why his analysis of accelerations of the bodies\nin the system, among themselves, required no knowledge of any absolute\naccelerations. In the 19th century, Maxwell, without questioning the\nunderlying framework of absolute space and time, pointed out that\nCorollary VI implied a kind of relativity of acceleration (1878, pp.\n51\u201352). Viewing the foregoing in hindsight, more recent\nliterature has suggested that the physics of the Principia did not\nreally require the notion of inertial frame at all, and therefore that\na weaker geometry than Newtonian spacetime would be a sufficient\nbackground structure for Newton\u2019s dynamical reasoning (cf.\nSaunders, 2013). It is further suggested, following Cartan (1923,\n1924), that the space-time structure and the gravitational field be\nunified in a curved space-time (cf. section 9, below), as a Newtonian\nversion of general relativity (cf. Malament 2012, chapter 4; see also\nKnox, 2014 and Weatherall 2018). The relevant conceptual resources and\nmathematical techniques for such approaches, evidently, developed only\nin the aftermath of general relativity. We return to this theme in\n2.5.\n2. Inertial frames in the 20th century: special and general relativity\n2.1 Inertial frames in Newtonian spacetime\n\nBy the early years of the 20th century, the notion of\ninertial system seems to have been widely accepted as the basis for\nNewtonian mechanics, even if the specific works of Lange and Thomson\nwere little noticed. In writing \u201cOn the electrodynamics of\nmoving bodies\u201d in 1905, Einstein took it to be obvious to his\nreaders that classical mechanics does not require a single privileged\nframe of reference, but an equivalence-class of frames, all in uniform\nmotion relative to each other, and in any of which \u201cthe\nequations of mechanics hold good.\u201d Two inertial frames with\ncoordinates \\((x, y, z, t)\\) and \\((x', y', z', t')\\) are related by\nthe Galilean transformations, \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n x' &= x - vt \\\\\n y' &= y \\\\\n z' &= z \\\\\n t' &= t\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n(assuming that the x-axis is defined to be the direction of their\nrelative motion). These transformations clearly preserve the invariant\nquantities of Newtonian mechanics, i.e. acceleration, force, and mass\n(and therefore time, length, and simultaneity). As far as Newtonian\nmechanics was concerned, then, the problem of absolute motion was\ncompletely solved; all that remained was to express the equivalence of\ninertial frames in a simpler geometrical structure. \n\nThe lack of a privileged spatial frame, combined with the obvious\nexistence of privileged states of motion\u2014paths defined as\nrectilinear in space and uniform with respect to time\u2014suggests\nthat the geometrical situation ought to be regarded from a\nfour-dimensional spatio-temporal point of view.\u00a0The\nstructure defined by the class of inertial frames can be captured in\nthe statement that space-time is a four-dimensional affine\nspace, whose straight lines (geodesics) are the trajectories of\nparticles in uniform rectilinear motion. See Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Inertial Trajectories as\nStraight Lines of Space-time\n\n\nThat is, space-time is a structure whose automorphisms\u2014the\nGalilean transformations that relate one inertial frame to\nanother\u2014are affine transformations: they take straight lines\ninto straight lines, and parallel lines into parallel lines. The\nformer condition implies that an inertial motion in one frame will be\nan inertial motion in any other frame, and likewise for an\naccelerating or rotational motion. The latter implies that\nuniformly-moving particles or observers who are relatively at rest in\none frame will also be relatively at rest in another. An inertial\nframe can be characterized as a family of parallel straight lines\n\u201cfilling\u201d space-time, representing the possible\ntrajectories of a family of free particles that are relatively at\nrest. See Figure 5. Therefore, to assert that an inertial frame exists\nis to impose a global structure on space-time; it is equivalent to the\nassertion that space-time is an affine space that is flat. \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Each of these families of\nstraight lines, \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\), represents the trajectories of a\nfamily of free particles that are relatively at rest, and therefore\neach defines an inertial frame. Relative to each other, the frames\ndefined by \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\) are in uniform motion.\n\nEach of the surfaces S is a \u201chypersurface of absolute\nsimultaneity\u201d representing all of space at a given moment;\nevidently (given the Galilean transformations) two inertial frames\nwill agree on which events in space-time are simultaneous.\n\n\nThe form of the Galilean transformations shows that, in addition to\nbeing affine transformations, they also preserve metrical relations on\ntime and space. Distinct inertial frames will agree on simultaneity,\nand on (ratios of) time-intervals; they will also agree on the spatial\ndistance between points at a given moment of time. Therefore, in the\nfour-dimensional picture, the decomposition of space-time into\nhypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity is independent of the choice of\ninertial frame. Another way of putting this is that Newtonian\nspace-time is endowed with a projection of space onto time,\ni.e. a function that identifies space-time points that have the same\ntime-coordinate. Similarly, absolute space arises from a projection of\nspace-time onto space, i.e. a function that identifies space-time\npoints that have the same spatial coordinates. See Figure 6. \n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nBut Galilean relativity implies that this latter projection is\narbitrary. While it assumes that we can identify the same time at\ndifferent spatial locations, Newtonian mechanics provides no physical\nway of identifying the same spatial point at different times. Thus the\nequivalence of inertial frames can be thought of as the arbitrariness\nof the projection of space-time onto space. Any such projection is,\nessentially, the arbitrary choice of some particular inertial frame as\na rest-frame. In the relativized version of Newton\u2019s theory,\nthen, the class of inertial frames replaces absolute space, while\nabsolute time remains. The structure of Newtonian space-time (also\nknown as Galilean space-time, or neo-Newtonian space-time) expresses\nthis fact in a direct and obvious way. (See Stein 1967 and Ehlers 1973\nfor further explanation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFigure 7:\n(a) Here is a space-time diagram of motions relative to the inertial\nframe in which \\(O_1\\), \\(O_2\\), and \\(P_1\\) are at rest. This can be\nseen as arising from the projection of each of their inertial\ntrajectories onto a single point of space. \\(O_3\\) is in uniform\nmotion. \\(O_4\\) is accelerating any old way. \\(O_5\\) and \\(O_6\\) are\nrevolving around their common center of gravity \\(P_1\\), which (as\nnoted above) is at rest. \\(O_7\\) and \\(O_8\\) are revolving around\ntheir center of gravity \\(P_2\\), which is in uniform motion.\n\n(b) Here is the same situation viewed from an inertial frame in which\n\\(O_3\\) and \\(P_2\\) are at rest. Now \\(O_1,\\) \\(O_2,\\) and \\(P_1\\) are\nin uniform motion. \\(O_4\\) is accelerating any old way. \\(O_5\\) and\n\\(O_6\\) are revolving around their common center of gravity \\(P_1\\),\nwhich is in uniform motion. \\(O_7\\) and \\(O_8\\) are revolving around\ntheir center of gravity \\(P_2\\), which (as noted above) is at\nrest.\n\n2.2 The conflict between Galilean relativity and modern electrodynamics\n\nBy the time that this representation of the Newtonian space-time\nstructure was developed, however, the Newtonian conception of inertial\nframe had been essentially overthrown. First, 19th-century\nelectrodynamics raised again the question of a privileged frame of\nreference: the conception of light as an electromagnetic wave in the\nether implied that the rest-frame of the ether itself should play a\ndistinguished role in electrodynamical phenomena. On the one hand,\nphysicists such as Maxwell and Lorentz were careful to point out that\nvelocity relative to the ether was not equivalent to absolute\nvelocity, because the state of motion of the ether itself was\nnecessarily unknown. In other words, this conception of light did not\nnecessarily violate the classical principle of relativity. On the\nother hand, the existence of such a preferred frame made the\nequivalence of inertial frames correspondingly less interesting, even\nif it was true in principle. This is why the appearance of the idea of\ninertial frame in the 1880s, as suggested earlier, was not of pressing\nphysical interest to the majority of physicists, and seemed to be a\nmere philosophical sidelight. The attempts to measure the effects of\nmotion relative to the ether commanded considerably more\nattention.\n\nSecond, the abandonment of the ether\u2014following the failure of\nattempts to measure velocity relative to the ether and, more\ngenerally, the apparent independence of all electrodynamical phenomena\nof motion relative to the ether\u2014did not vindicate the Newtonian\ninertial frame. Rather, it required a dramatically revised conception.\nSpecial relativity might be said to have applied the relativity\nprinciple of Newtonian mechanics to Maxwell\u2019s electrodynamics,\nby eliminating the privileged status of the rest-frame of the ether\nand admitting that the velocity of light is independent of the motion\nof the source. As Einstein expressed it, \u201cthe same laws of\nelectrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference\nfor which the equations of mechanics hold good.\u201d (1905, p. 38.)\nBut as Einstein also pointed out, the invariance of the velocity of\nlight and the principle of relativity, at least in its Galilean form,\nare incompatible. It simply makes no sense, according to Galilean\nrelativity, that any velocity should appear to be the same in inertial\nframes that are in relative motion.\n2.3 Special relativity and Lorentz invariance\n\nEinstein solved this difficulty through his analysis of simultaneity:\nframes in relative motion can agree on the velocity of light only if\nthey disagree on simultaneity. Only the relativity of simultaneity\nmakes possible the invariance of the velocity of light. This means\nthat the transformations between inertial frames that preserve the\nvelocity of light will not preserve simultaneity. These are the\nLorentz transformations: \n\n\\[\nx' = \\frac{x-vt}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \\quad y'=y \\quad z'=z \\quad t'=\\frac{t-vx/c^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\n\n\\]\n\n\nEvidently these transformations preserve the velocity of light, but\nthey do not preserve length and time. So the invariant quantities of\nNewtonian mechanics, which presuppose invariant measures of length and\ntime, must now depend on the choice of inertial frame. In other words,\nacceleration is an invariant quantity only when it is zero, for the\nmagnitude of a non-zero acceleration will differ for observers in\nrelative motion. Therefore the notions of force, mass, and\nacceleration no longer provides an appropriate definition of an\ninertial frame, except in the ideal case of a frame in which no forces\nare acting. Einstein\u2019s definition instead appeals to the\ninvariant quantities of electrodynamics: an inertial frame is one in\nwhich light travels equal distances in equal times in arbitrary\ndirections. What seems impossible, from the point of view of Galilean\nrelativity, is that a frame that moves uniformly relative to one frame\nthat satisfies Einstein\u2019s definition should also satisfy the\ndefinition. But that seeming impossibility rests, again, on the\nassumption that two inertial frames will have a common measure of\nsimultaneity. Einstein showed that light-signals provide an\nempirically and theoretically reasonable definition of simultaneity,\nin light of the empirical soundness of Maxwell\u2019s equations and\nthe apparent invariance of the velocity of light. In the absence of an\nempirically reasonable alternative compatible with Galilean\ninvariance, there is no sound criterion of simultaneity that will give\nthe same results in different inertial frames. Of course, it would\nremain true that in a given inertial frame, the motions of free\nparticles would satisfy the requirements of Lange\u2019s definition,\nand particles that move uniformly in one such frame would also move\nuniformly in any other. But such a definition is not a substitute for\nEinstein\u2019s definition, since it must itself presuppose a\ndefinition of simultaneity. Otherwise, its appeal to the measurement\nand comparison of times and distances is without a sound empirical\nbasis. Einstein\u2019s definition places such measurements on an\nempirical basis. Their results, however, will depend on the choice of\nan inertial frame, and will vary systematically according to the\nrelative velocities of different inertial frames.\n\nThe space-time structure of special relativity thus differs\nessentially from Newtonian space-time, and is called \u201cMinkowski\nspace-time\u201d since Minkowski (1908) first formulated\nEinstein\u2019s theory in its four-dimensional form. It is an affine\nspace, like Newtonian space-time. In both cases, the trajectories of\nfree particles are straight lines of the affine structure, and a set\nof parallel inertial trajectories (geodesics) corresponds to an\ninertial frame. As we just saw, however, Newtonian space-time\npresupposes the invariant division of space-time into\nthree-dimensional hypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity, and an\nobjective measure of distance between points at a given moment of\nabsolute time. Minkowski space-time is a four-dimensional vector space\nwith an invariant four-dimensional metrical structure, imposed by the\ninvariance of the speed of light. Instead of an invariant spatial\ninterval between simultaneous events, there is an invariant\nspatio-temporal interval between any two points in space-time. Since\nthere is no invariant relation of simultaneity, the sets of\nsimultaneous events for any inertial frame are the hyperplanes\northogonal to the trajectories that determine that frame. In other\nwords, the choice between two inertial frames determines a choice\nbetween two distinct divisions of space-time into space and time. See\nFigure 8:\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The inertial frames \\(F\\) and\n\\(F'\\) are in relative motion, and therefore, as the Lorentz\ntransformations indicate, they disagree on simultaneity. \\(F\\) and\n\\(F'\\) thus determine distinct decompositions of space-time into\ninstantaneous spaces, \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\), respectively \n\n2.4 Simultaneity and reference-frames\n\nThe details of Einstein\u2019s argument and the structure of\nMinkowski space-time can be found elsewhere (see, e.g., Einstein 1951\nand Geroch 1978). Here only one more point is worth making. It could\nbe argued that Einstein\u2019s and Lorentz\u2019s view are\ncompletely equivalent. That is, we could assume that there is indeed a\nprivileged frame of reference, and that the apparent invariance of the\nvelocity of light is explained by the effects on bodies of their\nmotion through the ether (the Lorentz contraction and time dilation).\nThis purported distinction between empirically indistinguishable\nframes has often been criticized on straightforward methodological\ngrounds, but it could be (and surely has been) argued that it is more\nintuitively plausible than the relativity of simultaneity. After all,\nknowing that (as Einstein showed) the Lorentz contraction can be\nderived from the invariance of the velocity of light does not, by\nitself, entitle us to say which of the two is the more convincing\nstarting-point.\n\nThis is why it is so important that Einstein\u2019s 1905 paper begins\nwith a critical analysis of the entire notion of a frame of reference.\nIt is tacitly assumed by Lorentz\u2019s theory, and classical\nelectrodynamics generally, that we have a reference-frame in which we\ncan measure the velocity of light, and that there is a distinguished\nframe\u2014at rest with respect to the ether\u2014in which its true\nvelocity would be measured. But how is such a reference-frame\ndetermined? The distances between points in space can only be\ndetermined if it is possible to determine which events are\nsimultaneous. In practice this is always done by light-signalling, if\nonly in the informal sense that we identify simultaneous events when\nwe see them at the same time. But if the spatial frame of reference is\ndetermined by light-signals, and is then to be used to measure the\nspeed of light, we would appear to be going in a circle. For this\nreason, Poincar\u00e9 concluded that determining the speed of light\nis partly a matter of convention (1898). Before Einstein, however, it\nwas tacitly assumed that, while light-signalling is useful and\npractical, it is not essential to the definition of simultaneity.\nThere would be, therefore, a fact of the matter about which events are\nsimultaneous that is independent of this method of signalling. This\nassumption was actually made explicit by James Thomson. He\nrecognized\u2014as few did before Poincar\u00e9 and\nEinstein\u2014that the measurement of distance involves\n\nthe difficulty as to imperfection of our means of ascertaining or\nspecifying, or clearly idealizing, simultaneity at distant places. For\nthis we do commonly use signals by sound, by light, by electricity, by\nconnecting wires or bars, and by various other means. The time\nrequired in the transmission of the signal involves an imperfection in\nhuman powers of ascertaining simultaneity of occurrences at distant\nplaces. It seems, however, probably not to involve any difficulty of\nidealizing or imagining the existence of simultaneity. Probably it may\nnot be felt to involve any difficulty comparable to that of attempting\nto form a distinct notion of identity of place at successive times in\nunmarked space. (1884, p. 380).\n\n\nIn other words, Thomson assumed that it was not a difficulty in\nprinciple, like the difficulty of determining rest in absolute space.\nBut Einstein showed that it was precisely the same kind of difficulty:\ndeterminations of simultaneity involve reference to an arbitrary\nchoice of reference-frame, just as much as determinations of velocity.\nEinstein\u2019s conclusion is, of course, entirely contingent on the\nempirical facts of electrodynamics. It could have been avoided if\nthere were in nature a useful signal of some kind whose transmission\nwould provide a criterion of absolute simultaneity, so that the same\nevents would be determined to be simultaneous in all inertial frames.\nOr, experiments such as those of Michelson and Morley might have\nsucceeded in exhibiting the dependence of the velocity of light on the\nstate of motion of the source. Then synchronization by light-signals\ncould still have been regarded as a mere practical substitute for a\nnotion of absolute simultaneity that stood on independent grounds,\nempirically as well as conceptually. But as Einstein saw, because of\nthe apparent independence of the velocity of light of the motion of\nthe source, even \u201cidealizing or imagining the existence of\nsimultaneity\u201d involves light-signalling more essentially than\nanyone could have realized. Unless some other criterion of\nsimultaneity is provided, therefore, the establishment of a spatial\nframe of reference involves light-signalling in an essential way. In\nthe absence of such a criterion the speed of light cannot be, as\nLorentz supposed, empirically measured against the background of an\ninertial frame. By appealing to the speed of light in defining\nsimultaneity, Einstein gave an empirically sound construction both for\nspatio-temporal measurement and for a dynamically distinct class of\nreference-frames. (Cf. DiSalle 2006, ch. 4.) \n2.5 From special relativity and Lorentz invariance to general relativity and general covariance\n\nIt may seem surprising that, after this insightful analysis of the\nconcept of inertial frame and its role in electrodynamics, Einstein\nshould have turned almost immediately to call that concept into\nquestion. But he became convinced, largely by his reading of Mach,\nthat the central role of inertial frames was an \u201cepistemological\ndefect\u201d that special relativity shared with Newtonian mechanics.\nOnly relative motions are observable, yet both of these theories\npurport to identify a privileged state of motion and use it to explain\nobservable effects (such as centrifugal forces). Coordinate systems\nare not observable, yet both of these theories assign a fundamental\nphysical role to certain kinds of coordinate system, namely, the\ninertial systems. In either theory, inertial coordinates are\ndistinguished from all others, and the laws of physics are said to\nhold only relative to inertial coordinate systems. In an\nepistemologically sophisticated theory, both of these problems would\nbe solved at once: the new theory would only refer to what is\nobservable, which is relative motion; it would admit arbitrary\ncoordinate systems, instead of confining itself to a special class of\nsystem. Why, after all, should any genuine physical phenomenon depend\non the choice of coordinate system?\n\nAnother way of expressing Einstein\u2019s view is to say that, in\nNewtonian mechanics and special relativity, rotation is\n\u201cabsolute\u201d because the transformations between inertial\nframes (Galilean or Lorentzian) preserve rotational states. Thus the\n\u201cabsoluteness\u201d of rotation arises precisely from singling\nout one type of frame, by one type of transformation, instead of\nallowing arbitrary transformations and arbitrary frames. Einstein held\nthat this epistemological insight had a natural mathematical\nrepresentation in the principle of general covariance, or the\nprinciple that the laws of nature are to be invariant under\narbitrary coordinate transformations. More precisely, what\nthis means is that coordinate transformations are no longer required\n(as in the affine spaces of Newtonian mechanics and special\nrelativity) to take straight lines to straight lines, and to preserve\nfurther metrical structures appropriate to each theory, but only to\npreserve the smoothness of curves (i.e. their differentiability). The\ngeneral theory of relativity was intended to be a generally covariant\ntheory of space-time, and its general covariance was intended to\nexpress the general relativity of motion (Cf. Einstein 1916, section\n3). The extent to which the theory realized Einstein\u2019s original\naims remains a topic of philosophical debate. (Cf. Related Entries:\n \u201cspace and time: the hole argument,\u201d\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s philosophy of science\u201d.) \n\nThe central role of inertial frames in Newtonian and Minkowski\nspace-time theories, in sum, rested on their shared assumption of the\nuniformity of space-time. In Newtonian mechanics and special\nrelativity, the formal relations between inertial coordinate\nsystems\u2014the Galilean and Lorentz transformations,\nrespectively\u2014correspond to symmetry transformations of uniform\nspace-time, that is, a space-time with non-trivial global symmetries.\nIn Einstein\u2019s context, a coordinate transformation from the\ncoordinates of one \u201cstationary system\u201d to those of another\nwould generally not reflect a global symmetry of space-time, just to\nthe extent that the two were relatively accelerating. \n\nAt the same time, we can say that the concept of inertial frame\nretains at least one aspect of the relevance that it had for Newton.\nAs we saw, Newton was aware that he could not determine (to put it in\nour language) an actual inertial frame from his analysis of the solar\nsystem; Corollary VI implied that all local phenomena were compatible\nwith an acceleration of the entire system, by nearly equal and nearly\nparallel accelerative forces acting on the sun, the planets, and their\nsatellites. By the very same reasoning, however, he established that\nsuch a uniformly accelerating frame was sufficient for a successful\nanalysis of the relevant causes acting within the system\u2014those\ncauses that determine the system\u2019s configuration. From this\nanalysis he could determine the configuration of the system, that is,\ndetermine that our system is approximately Keplerian, with small\ndeviations from Keplerian motion accounted for by perturbative actions\nof the members of the system on each other. In other words, though a\ntrue inertial frame cannot be determined, a sufficient approximation\nto an inertial frame provides a sufficient basis for this causal\naccount. \n\nIn empirical testing and measurement in general relativity, the\ntreatment of individual gravitating systems follows an analogous\npattern. For the analysis of interactions within a local system, an\nasymptotically flat solution to Einstein\u2019s equation plays a role\nanalogous to the Newtonian system that approximates the conditions of\nCorollary VI. In general relativity, there can be non-negligible\npost-Newtonian effects, such as spatial curvature, and the non-linear\nsuperposition of gravitational fields. When they appear, empirical\nconsequences such as anomalous precessions and light-bending provide\ntests of general relativity and other relativistic gravitation\ntheories. (See Will 2018, ch. 4, especially 4.1\u20134.3).\nAbstractly, we might wish to treat such a system as isolated within a\nregion of space-time that \u201cflattens out\u201d at infinity.\nPractically, it suffices to consider a region in which, at a\nsufficient remove from a system of mutually gravitating masses,\ncurvature becomes negligible in comparison with the curvature induced\nby those masses locally. In other words, analogously to the Newtonian\ncase, it is not necessary that such a system be isolated from external\ninfluences. It suffices that external influences make a negligible\ndifference to the actions of the masses among themselves, and to the\nresulting configuration of the system. In short, instead of providing\nan exact account of the global symmetries of space-time, the idea of\nan inertial frame still provides a crucial practical tool for the\nempirical study of actual physical interactions.\n",
