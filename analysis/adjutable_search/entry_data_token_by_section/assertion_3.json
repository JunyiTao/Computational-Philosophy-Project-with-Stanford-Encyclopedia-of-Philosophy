However, when using\n (9b),\n but not when using\n (9a),\n the speaker indicates that there is a contrast of some kind between\nworking with real estate and liking fishing. The speaker is not\nasserting that there is a contrast. We can test this, for\ninstance, by forming a conditional with\n (9b).\n The antecedent of (10) preserves the contrast rather than make it\nhypothetical, showing that the contrast is not asserted, forming a\nconditional with\n (9b)\n in the antecedent preserves the contrast rather than make it\nhypothetical:\n\n(10)\nIf John works with real estate but likes fishing, I think we can\nbring him along.\n\n\nIt is usually said that the speaker in cases like\n (9b)\n and\n (10)\nimplicates that there is a contrast. These are examples of\nimplicature. H. Paul Grice (1975, 1989) developed a general\ntheory of implicature. Grice called implicatures of the kind\nexemplified conventional, since it is a standing feature of\nthe word \u201cbut\u201d to give rise to them.\n\nMost of Grice\u2019s theory is concerned with the complementing kind,\nthe conversational implicatures. These are subdivided into\nthe particularized ones, which depend on features of the\nconversational context, and the generalized ones, which\ndon\u2019t (Grice 1975: 37\u20138). The particularized\nconversational implicature rely on general conversational maxims, not\non features of expressions. These maxims are thought to be in force in\nordinary conversation. For instance, the maxim Be orderly!\nrequires of the speaker to recount events in the order they took\nplace. This is meant to account for the intuitive difference in\ncontent between\n\n(11)\n\n\na.\nJohn took off his shoes and sat down.\nb.\nJohn sat down and took off his shoes.\n \n\n\nAccording to Grice\u2019s account, the speaker doesn\u2019t assert,\nonly implicates that the events took place in the order recounted.\nWhat is asserted is just that both events did take place.\n\nReal or apparent violations of the maxims generate implicatures, on\nthe assumption that the participants obey the over-arching\nCooperative Principle. For instance, in the conversation\n\n(12)\n\n\nA:\nWhere does John spend the summer?\nB:\nSomewhere in Canada.\n \n\n\nB implicates that he doesn\u2019t know where in Canada John\nspends the summer. The reasoning is as follows: B violates\nthe Maxim of Quantity to be as informative as required. Since\nB is assumed to be cooperative, we can infer that he cannot\nsatisfy the Maxim of Quantity without violating some other maxim. The\nbest candidate is the sub-maxim of the Maxim of Quality, which\nrequires you not to say anything for which you lack sufficient\nevidence. Hence, one can infer that B doesn\u2019t know.\nAgain, B has not asserted that he doesn\u2019t know, but\nstill managed to convey it in an indirect\n manner.[7]\n",
