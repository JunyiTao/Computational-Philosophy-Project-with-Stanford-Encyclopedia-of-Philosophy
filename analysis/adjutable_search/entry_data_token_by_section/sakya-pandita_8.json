    "main_text": "Preserving the True Path: Clarifying the Sage\u2019s Intent\n5. A Buddhist Approach to Scholarship: The Gateway to Learning\n\nIn the sections above, we have seen Sapa\u1e47 criticize his\ncontemporaries for their mistaken views and practices, which he\nbelieved threatened the integrity and the effectiveness of the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings. As a result of these writings, he was\nvalorized as a great scholar with deep mastery of Buddhist doctrine,\nbut he was also often criticized and sometimes lampooned for being\nstodgy, conservative, and self-satisfied. He certainly believed that\nhe had a clearer and more accurate view of the truth of the doctrine\nthan most Tibetans of his time. Yet he believed the reason he was\nsuperior was easy to explain: He had studied and internalized the vast\nintellectual traditions of India, the land of Buddhism\u2019s source.\nHis learning provided him the means and the justification for\ndefending the dharma against other teachers whose understanding was,\nby comparison, spotty. \n\nIn the Gateway to Learning (D. Jackson 1987 and Gold 2007),\nSapa\u1e47 made his case for the importance of scholastic learning\nfor Tibetans, and provided a clear program of study so that anyone\nwith sufficient diligence could attain the expertise necessary to be a\ndefender of the dharma like himself.  The work is a rare example of a\nmedieval treatise on the goals and means of education, and it is\narticulated with philosophical precision from a Buddhist perspective\nand with a remarkable awareness of the social- and\nhistorical-locatedness of Tibet of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ntime. The Gateway is divided into three chapters, each\ndedicated to a category of scholarly learning: composition,\nexposition, and debate. Over the course of these chapters, Sapa\u1e47\nprovides introductory sketches of and occasional excurses into the\ntopics that, in his view, make up the model of Indian\npa\u1e47\u1e0dityam and the most important practices of\nscholarship. The work draws upon the Vy\u0101khy\u0101yukti\nof Vasubandhu in the first two chapters and the\nV\u0101dany\u0101ya of Dharmak\u012brti in the debate\nchapter, and roughly follows an outline from the\nMah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra, but it\nis unique in its scope, its Buddhist philosophical bent, and its\nselection of topics precisely targeted to the needs of Tibetans.\n\nAmong the most original and significant analyses here is\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s approach to translation and translation theory. A\nkey theme of Tibetan Buddhist self-understanding has always been a\nkeen sense of Tibet\u2019s proximity to India as the source of the\ndharma, but also its cultural and linguistic distance from India. This\nis a reason that the great translators (and of course,\npa\u1e47\u1e0ditas) were venerated as a bridge to the\noriginal source of the dharma in Sanskrit. Sakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\nwas himself a translator and he was very much aware of various kinds\nof shifts and transitions that took place when the dharma moved from\nSanskrit into Tibetan language. In the Gateway he explains\nthe choices made by the translators in a way that reveals just how\ndeep a Tibetan interpreter\u2019s knowledge needs to be in order not\nto be fooled by the translations. It is, in this way, an early\napplication of the cultural studies approach to translation studies\n(see Bassnett & Lefevere 1999). In his analysis, the translations\nare shown to embody the cultural distance between India and Tibet,\nbetween the true dharma and its likely misinterpretation, which can\nonly be overcome by very precise linguistic expertise.\n\nOne example Sapa\u1e47 notes is the use of the Tibetan translation\nye shes to distinguish the Sanskrit original\nj\u00f1\u0101na from praj\u00f1\u0101. There is\nnothing in the source term to reflect the ye, which means,\nfor Sapan, that it is a mistake to think of ye shes as\n\u201cprimordial wisdom\u201d\u2014a common reading in certain\nTibetan schools. The dharma as translated is, in this way, a minefield\nof interpretive problems. It is very easy to make mistakes that can\nlead to false teachings. But it would be wrong to think that this\nlinguistic and cultural distance makes for an essential distinction\nbetween the dharma as it originated in its unadulterated form from the\nmouth of a Buddha, and the dharma as received by Tibetans. Such an\nessentialization would be to reify linguistic entities in a way that\nis non-Buddhist. The key to translation is not to uncover some\nessential nature of meanings embedded in the words. Sapa\u1e47\ntherefore provides a Buddhist philosophical defense of the possibility\nof translation.\n\nSapa\u1e47 draws upon the epistemology of Dharmakirti discussed\nabove, and says that there is no essential relation between words and\nmeanings. Rather, meaning in language depends upon nothing but the\nspeaker\u2019s intention, which is always context-dependent. In the\ncase of the dharma, that means the teacher\u2019s intention to move a\nparticular set of beings forward on the path toward liberation. The\nkey in transmitting the teachings from generation to generation is to\npreserve, as well as possible, the capacity of the teachings to have\nthat effect. And the only way to do that is to preserve an\nunderstanding of the speaker\u2019s specific intentions in\nusing language as expressed in the particular texts we have. Teachers\nhave to know just what the meaning was meant to be, when these words\nwere uttered. So, a detailed understanding of the language of the\ndharma\u2014the contexts of its origination in the forms that we have\nit\u2014is inseparable from the larger project of the sangha, to\ncommunicate the teachings from generation to generation. The\ntranslations, because they are vulnerable to misinterpretation,\nrequire special handling and expertise. Sapa\u1e47 says we need a\ncommunity of experts to protect the teachings and preserve their\nproper interpretation. We need an interpretive community that can act\nas a bulwark against the decline of the dharma. Every aspect of the\nscholar\u2019s toolbox\u2014from elementary Sanskrit language study\nto literary theory to the regulation of debate methods\u2014is\nprovided with an explanation and justification of the norms of this\nidealized Buddhist guard.\n\nIn the section on debate, Sapa\u1e47 again explained a number of\npoints of particular interest to Tibetans of his time. Of great\ninterest here is his discussion of debate based on scripture, in which\nhe explains strategies for showing contradictions in the\nVedas while defending against critics who claim that the\nBuddhist scriptures are inconsistent. These instructions cohere with\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s stated understanding that debate proper is a\ncompetition between adherents of different tenets. Of course, students\nmay practice debate to test their understanding of treatises, but the\nreal reason to engage in debate is to defend the dharma. Here we see\ndebate as a skill that is properly the culmination of the previous\ntrainings from Sanskrit language to poetics, all of which have as\ntheir ultimate aim to defend the Buddha\u2019s dharma against its\nenemies, whether they be indirectly or unintentionally damaging it\nthrough misreadings and misrepresentations, or attacking it openly in\nthe promotion of non-Buddhist doctrines. Sapa\u1e47 envisions\nTibetans training for a translocal courtly stage, where traditions\nlived or died by royal decree. Perhaps his own fame and skill as a\ndefender of the dharma contributed to Sakya\u2019s attaining control\nover a united Tibet under Mongol rule.\n",
