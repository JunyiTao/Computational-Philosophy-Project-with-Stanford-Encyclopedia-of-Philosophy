    "main_text": "Premise III: The Anomalism Principle || The Rationality Arguments\n4.2 The Rationality Arguments\n\nWhat is responsible for the possibility of indeterminacy, however, is\nthe role of the principle of charity in formulating a theory of\nanother person\u2019s behavior (Davidson 1970, 222\u201323). And\nthis principle is closely aligned for Davidson with mental anomalism.\nAccording to this principle, we must \u201ctry for a theory that\nfinds him consistent, a believer of truths, and a lover of the good\n(all by our own lights, it goes without saying)\u201d (Davidson 1970,\n222). In the process of coming to understand another, by ascribing\nmental states and events to him and meanings to his words, we must,\nDavidson claims, stand ready to adjust previous assignments of\nmeanings and mental states and events based upon new evidence about\nthe person and how it relates to the overall project of finding him\nand his behavior intelligible. There are two key points here that for\nDavidson suggest mental anomalism. First, we never have all possible\nevidence\u2014we must maintain an openness to better interpretations\nof previous behavior as new evidence becomes available. Interpretation\nis always ongoing. And second, \u2018better\u2019 interpretations\nare those made in light of the constitutive ideal of rationality.\nConsequently, Davidson claims, \n\n\nthere cannot be tight connections between the realms [of the mental\nand the physical] if each is to retain allegiance to its proper source\nof evidence. (Davidson 1970, 222)\n\n\nRationality is claimed by Davidson to be constitutive of the\nmental in the sense that something only counts as being a\nmind\u2014and thus an appropriate object of psychological\nattributions\u2014if it meets up to certain rational standards. This\nconstitutive idea is open to weaker and stronger interpretations. The\nweaker interpretation sees only very basic logical, semantic or\nconceptual constraints on understanding others\u2014and thus what is\nconstitutive of minds\u2014which allows for significant variation as\none moves further out from these to more substantive principles of\npractical reasoning and theoretical reasoning, and even more when\nextending out further to desires and values. The stronger\ninterpretation appears to be suggested in the quote from Davidson\nimmediately above. In requiring consistency, true beliefs and\nappropriate desires, it appears to require maximizing agreement\nbetween interpreter and interpreted, and thus a maximal conception of\nwhat is constitutive of minds. The weaker interpretation instead\nrequires merely minimizing inexplicable error on the part of the\ncreature being interpreted, thus allowing for significant deviations\nfrom psychological assignments that might be required by the stronger\ninterpretation. On this view, the interpreter puts himself into the\nshoes of the interpreted, acknowledging evidential and cognitive\nlimitations that might prevent her from achieving maximal rationality\n(Grandy 1973). As we will see in this section, how one interprets the\nnotion of rationality as constitutive directly affects how the\nargument for mental anomalism is interpreted to work.\n\nWhile Davidson never offers any substantive account of what the proper\nsource of evidence is for the physical, he often invokes the notion of\nrationality as constraining mental ascription, and it is clear that\nwhatever constrains physical ascription is supposed to pull in a\ndifferent and potentially conflicting direction. One suggestive way of\ngetting at Davidson\u2019s idea here is through the traditional\ndistinction between \u2018normative\u2019 and\n\u2018descriptive\u2019 concepts. When we look to uncover\ngeneralizations in the physically described world, what we find to\nfollow from a certain set of physical conditions is a brute\nfact; our world is constituted in certain ways (in its governing\nlaws) that we could imagine to be different. We may come to an\nempirical investigation with certain theoretical commitments that\ninevitably lead us to read the data in some ways rather than others;\nand there may indeed, as Davidson himself suggests, be constitutive\na priori principles that govern very basic physical concepts\nsuch as \u2018object\u2019 and \u2018event\u2019 (Davidson 1970,\n220; 1974b, 239; 1973a, 254; see\n 3.2\n above). However, the constraints are far looser and allow for a wide\nvariation in terms of empirical content\u2014of what physical events\nand states can follow from others. This is contrasted with mental\nascription, where the normative notion of rationality rules out the\npossibility of certain mental states following from others. This line\nof thinking is suggestive, but it is in need of considerable\ntightening.\n4.2.1 Normative vs. Descriptive Principles (Kim)\n\nJaegwon Kim\u2019s account of Davidson\u2019s position (Kim 1985)\nattempts to do just this. Kim argues that if there were strict lawlike\nrelations between mental and physical predicates, the \u2018brute\nfactness\u2019 and contingency of the physical would\n\u2018infect\u2019 the mental. For instance, rationality\nconsiderations will typically lead us to attribute a belief that q to\na person if we attribute a belief that p and also attribute a\nbelief that p entails q. According to Kim\u2019s account, beliefs\ninvolving very basic logical, semantic or conceptual relations like\nthis hold of necessity\u2014we cannot make sense of possible worlds\nwhere beliefs of the first two kinds are attributed but not the\nthird.\n\nNow, this may appear to be too strong a claim, in light of\nDavidson\u2019s rejection of strict, purely psychological\nlaws\u2014mental anomalism rejects the possibility of any strict laws\nin which mental predicates figure, but Kim here appears to be\ndeploying laws of the form\n\u2018M1\u00a0&\u00a0M2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M3\u2019.\nKim would reply that Davidson is only interested in rejecting strict\ndescriptive (i.e., explanatory, predictive) laws, not strict normative\nlaws (see below). \n\nIf physical predicates stood in strict lawful relations to mental\npredicates, this contingency would \u2018infect\u2019 the mental in\nthe following sense. Suppose that there were strict bridge laws\ncorrelating the instantiation of mental and physical properties,\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2194\u00a0M1\u2019\nand\n\u2018P2\u00a0\u2194\u00a0M2\u2019.\nThen, Kim argues, rational principles of the form\n\u2018M1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\nM2\u2019 would enable the logical derivation of\nphysical laws like\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P2\u2019.\nIndeed, the reverse would be true as well; starting with the physical\nlaw\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P2\u2019,\nand assuming the psychophysical bridge laws, one could derive the\nrational principle\n\u2018M1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M2\u2019.\nHowever, the metaphysical status of the rational principle and the\nphysical law are importantly different\u2014rational principles are\nnecessary, true in all possible worlds, while physical laws, being\ncontingent, are not. In particular, with the bridge laws in place, a\ncontingent physical law could explain (through derivation) the\nrational principle, undermining its status as necessary. Since it is\nthe bridge laws that enable these troublemaking derivations,\nthey\u2014and thus strict psychophysical laws\u2014are to be\nrejected. This is how Kim makes sense of Davidson\u2019s suggestive\nclaim that mental anomalism is grounded in the fact that mental and\nphysical explanation owe their allegiance to different sources of\nevidence. (For related discussion, see the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.)\n\nKim\u2019s argument rests upon two central assumptions. First, it\nassumes that no distinction between strict and ceteris\nparibus laws need play any role in reconstructions of\nDavidson\u2019s argument. It is, purportedly, not the scope\nof a psychological law which accounts for an asymmetry with physical\nlaws, but rather the point of each type of law (Kim 1985,\n381). Second, it assumes that there is a firm distinction between\ndescriptive laws and relations, on the one hand, and normative laws\nand relations, on the other, that can bear the weight of mental\nanomalism (Kim 1985, 383) The first assumption is clearly mistaken; as\nalready noted, Davidson heavily emphasizes the focus on strict laws in\nhis own discussions of Anomalous Monism, and explicitly allows for the\npossibility of hedged laws incorporating mental predicates.\nKim\u2019s reductio strategy, then, would fail to uniquely\nidentify the culprit responsible for producing the trouble as the\nbridge laws rather than the rational principle, all of which\nare strict. And while Davidson does emphasize the normative status of\nmental predicates, he also recognizes, as we have already noted\n (3.2\n and\n 4.2),\n a normative component to the physical realm, in constitutive a\npriori principles. There does not appear to be a significant\ndistinction between descriptive and normative principles in\nDavidson\u2019s framework that can bear the burden of mental\nanomalism, as required on Kim\u2019s interpretation. (For further\ndiscussion of Kim\u2019s interpretative strategy, see the supplement\non\n Kim\u2019s Reductio Strategy for Establishing Mental Anomalism.)\n4.2.2 Uncodifiability and Strong Rationality as An Ideal (McDowell)\n\nJohn McDowell also focuses on the normative nature of rationality, but\nemphasizes a very strong conception of rationality as an ideal\nconstitutive of the mental, taking in more than merely the familiar\ndeductive relations\u2014logical, semantic or\nconceptual\u2014deployed in Kim\u2019s reading (McDowell 1985,\n391\u20134). McDowell appears to be guided by some of\nDavidson\u2019s broader formulations and discussions of the principle\nof charity\n (4.2),\n which extend to more general principles governing action and belief\nformation, highlighted in Davidson\u2019s discussions of\nirrationality (see Davidson 1982). For example, the principle of\ncontinence requires one to act on the basis of all available\nconsiderations, and the principle of total evidence requires one to\nbelieve the hypothesis supported by all of one\u2019s evidence. And\nthe broad formulations entail that our conception of rationality\nincludes conceptions of the Good, and so the formation of rationally\nappropriate desires, thus extending beyond constraints on belief and\naction. According to McDowell, those inclined to think that mere\ndeductive relations can be captured in physical terms (see Loar 1981)\nwill find mental anomalism much more difficult to deny when taking\ninto account this stronger conception of rationality. \n\nThis stronger conception of rationality puts McDowell in a position to\nexploit a crucial gap between rational norms and actual explanations\nof behavior:\n\n\nFinding an action or propositional attitude intelligible, after\ninitial difficulty, may not only involve managing to articulate for\noneself some hitherto merely implicit aspect of one\u2019s conception\nof rationality, but actually involve becoming convinced that\none\u2019s conception of rationality needed correcting, so as to make\nroom for this novel way of being intelligible. (McDowell 1985,\n392)\n\n\nJust as our beliefs about empirical matters can be mistaken in any\ngiven case, and we can make genuine discoveries about empirical\nreality, just so with rationality. Clearly this claim is much more\nplausible with the stronger conception of rationality that McDowell is\nurging than the weaker conception limited to mere deductive relations.\nMcDowell goes on to argue that because of this feature, we must be\nopen to the possible reinterpretation of a person\u2019s behavior and\npsychological states in light of our changing conception of\nrationality, and how it changes cannot be anticipated in advance so\nthat rationality could be captured in a permanent set of principles\nfrom which strict laws could be fashioned. For this reason,\nrationality is uncodifiable. According to McDowell, this is\nwhat underlies mental anomalism.\n\nOne might understand the reasoning here in the following way: because\nit is built into our conception of rationality that our own particular\ngrasp of rationality may be mistaken on any given occasion and is also\ninherently limited, no statement of psychological or psychophysical\ngeneralizations could exhaust, and therefore explain, our conception\nof rationality. If the concept of rationality does not simply\nconsist in one\u2019s conception, at any given time, of\nrationality, then it cannot be captured in terms of the\nactual goings on in one\u2019s brain (the same point applies\nif we substitute \u201ceveryone\u2019s\u201d for\n\u201cone\u2019s\u201d). Therefore, strict lawlike relations\nbetween the mental and the physical are impossible. This contrasts\ninterestingly with Kim\u2019s strategy: on McDowell\u2019s reading,\nit is partly because no detailed statement of a rational principle\ncould be claimed to be necessarily true that there can be no\npsychophysical laws.\n\nA number of questions arise in considering McDowell\u2019s argument.\nIt appears to be heavily influenced by Davidson\u2019s remarks about\nthe ongoing nature of interpretation (Davidson 1970, 223;\n see 4.2).\n However, Davidson appeals to the fact that new\nevidence\u2014in the form of behavior and environmental\ncontext\u2014is always coming in that can force us to revise existing\ninterpretations of an agent. There is no mention of shifting\nstandards, or unarticulated or inarticulable conceptions of\nrationality. Indeed, the implication is that a stable\nstandard, when taking into account new evidence, can lead to revised\ninterpretations of prior behavior. So McDowell appears to be going\nbeyond Davidson\u2019s own views about the concept of rationality.\nIndeed, the idea that one is not able to fully articulate a concept in\nthe way suggested by McDowell\u2014that it is in effect\nineffable \u2013does not clearly sit comfortably with\nDavidson\u2019s views about conceptual relativism and rejection of\nthe idea of untranslatable languages (see further the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism).\n\nFurther, and more importantly, McDowell\u2019s distinctive\nuncodifiability claim, which rests on this view of rationality, looks\nto be too general to underwrite a specific thesis like mental\nanomalism. This becomes apparent when one asks why the very same\nfeatures that he is insisting are true of our conception of\nrationality aren\u2019t also true of the key concepts that figure in\nexplanations of the physical world. Surely our concepts of physical\nreality outstrip any particular conception we have at any given time,\nand the possibility of mistaken application is built into them. And\nscientists are in the same position as interpreters in terms of the\npossibility of new evidence and its bearing on how previous evidence\nwas understood. So far this looks to be nothing more than a\ncombination of a completely general point about concepts together with\nthe familiar problem of induction, which plagues all empirical\nenquiry. McDowell\u2019s assertion that \u201csomeone who aims at\nexplanations of the ideal-involving kind must be alive to the thought\nthat there is sure to be a gap between actual current conception and\nideal structure in his own case as well as others\u201d (McDowell\n1985, 392) doesn\u2019t appear to uniquely pick out any particular\nexplanatory framework. It therefore cannot tell us anything\ndistinctive about the metaphysical status of psychology.\n\nIf, however, the emphasis here falls on constitutive\nprinciples in particular\u2014as surely it must\u2014then two other\nproblems arise. First, McDowell\u2019s reasoning doesn\u2019t tell\nus what exactly it is about such principles that makes them resistant\nto reduction, since, as we\u2019ve just seen, that reasoning has\nfailed to distinguish them from empirical concepts in the physical\nsciences. And second, as noted in\n 4.2,\n Davidson holds that there are constitutive a priori\nprinciples underlying the physical sciences which play a similar role\nthere that rationality plays in psychological explanation. So we are\nstill in need of an explanation of why psychology and physics cannot\nstand in strict lawlike relations. Now, we did note there that such\nphysical constitutive principles are far more lenient than\nrationality, allowing for a greater variety of empirical\ncontent\u2014of what can follow from what. This indeed accounts for\nan important asymmetry between mental and physical explanation. And\nMcDowell heavily emphasizes this point in his discussion: that it is\nnot merely a brute fact that rationality marks the limits of\nintelligibility, while physical explanations do bottom out in brute\nfacts (McDowell 1985, 394). However, this point appears to be entirely\nseparable from the distinctive feature of McDowell\u2019s reading of\nthe argument for mental anomalism\u2014it has nothing especially to\ndo with the idea of rationality as uncodifiable in\nMcDowell\u2019s specific sense. In fact, it is the key point behind\nKim\u2019s strategy, and it appears to have no essential connection\nto McDowell\u2019s stronger views about rationality. One can think of\nrationality as constitutive, as normative and as asymmetrical to the\nphysical in the way just noted\u2014as Kim does\u2014without buying\ninto McDowell\u2019s distinctive picture of it. So it looks like the\nsalvageable part of McDowell\u2019s actual argument for mental\nanomalism ultimately reduces to Kim\u2019s. Uncodifiability appears\nto be a red herring.\n\nTherefore, despite McDowell\u2019s extremely subtle and interesting\nviews about the nature of the ideal of rationality, in the end those\nviews do not appear to provide a secure foundation for mental\nanomalism. It is only what is shared in common with Kim\u2019s\nstrategy\u2014the modal asymmetry between rational and physical\nexplanation\u2014that bears directly on mental anomalism. And that\nleaves McDowell\u2019s reading facing the sorts of concerns raised in\n 4.2.1.\n4.2.3 The Context/Complexity Argument (McDowell and Child)\n\nAs we have seen above, Kim thinks that mental anomalism is susceptible\nof a kind of proof. This seems to be something stronger than Davidson\nhimself claims (Davidson 1970, 215). In light of Davidson\u2019s\nmodesty about provability, and lack of explicit argumentation, some\ncommentators (Child 1992; see also McDowell 1979) have suggested that\nmere reflection on the kinds of generalizations that we draw upon in\ncoming to understand each other supports (but cannot prove) mental\nanomalism. Such generalizations are rules of thumb that hold only for\nthe most part, and require, for their application to a given case,\ndetailed contextual supplementation that cannot, by its nature, be\nincluded in anything like a universal generalization. The suggestion\nis that the sheer amount of contextual detail that would need to be\naccounted for in any statement with even a hope of being true is\ninappropriate for inclusion in strict lawful statements. A related\nstrategy is to point to a lack of fixed, predetermined ends that all\nhumans (or even any particular human over the course of her life) aim\nfor in situations of choice, or values to maximize when deciding what\nto believe (such as simplicity, scope, and consistency in the case of\ntheory choice) (Child 1992). The thought here is that if there are no\nsuch fixed ends or values, then no psychological generalization could\nbe complete\u2014since in particular contexts such ends or values\nplay a crucial explanatory role in determining what to do or\nbelieve.\n\nIt would seem, however, that reflection on the level of detail\nrequired for strict laws in the physical sciences fails to provide for\nan interesting asymmetry here. If one considers the number of factors\nthat would have to be taken in to account in order to state conditions\nthat guarantee that when a match is struck it will produce a flame,\nthe resulting strict law would be quite complex, and in a way not\nobviously different from any putative strict laws in which mental\npredicates figure, with contextual features included. And if there are\nindeed no fixed ends or values in the realm of choice and a decision,\nthis can be accommodated in the same way\u2014the contextual ends or\nvalues could themselves be included in the putative strict laws. This\nwould complicate and expand the set of such laws, but as already noted\nthis is not something that would set mental generalizations apart from\nphysical ones. (For further discussion of rationality and the argument\nfor Anomalous Monism see Yalowitz 1997 and Latham 1999.)\n4.3 The Causal Definition Argument\n\nWe have been looking at different ways of making sense of and\njustifying Davidson\u2019s claim that mental anomalism stems from the\nconstitutive role of rationality in mental ascription. In\nDavidson\u2019s writings, however, another line of argument often\nsurfaces which focuses less on the rational nature of mental events\nand more on their causal nature. As we have already seen, in his\nearliest work on action Davidson argued that reasons explain actions\nby causing them, and he later came to emphasize that what makes mental\nstates and events what they are is determined in part by their causes\nand effects. Particular psychological explanations are causal (they\ninvoke causes\u2014Davidson 1963), and are formulated in terms of\ncausally defined concepts (for propositional attitudes, see Davidson\n1987b, 41; for mental contents, see Davidson 1987a, 44). In later work\nhe frequently notes the anomic nature of causal concepts and causal\nexplanations, and how mental properties and reasons explanations are\nanomic because of this\u2014\u201creason-explanations\u2026are in\nsome sense low-grade; they explain less than the best explanations in\nthe hard sciences because of their heavy dependence on causal\npropensities\u201d (Davidson 1987b, 42; see also Davidson 1991, 162).\nIf mental concepts are causally defined, and strict laws do not employ\ncausally defined concepts, then mental anomalism appears to follow\nstraight away, without need of any detour through issues concerning\nthe rationality of mental concepts.\n\nExtending this reasoning, Davidson writes that\n\n\n[m]ental concepts\u2026appeal to causality because they are\ndesigned, like the concept of causality itself, to single out from the\ntotality of circumstances which conspire to cause a given event just\nthose factors that satisfy some particular explanatory interest.\n(Davidson 1991, 163)\n\n\nThis appears to ground the causal definition of anomic properties\n(whether mental or otherwise) in the fact that they answer to\nparticular explanatory interests. This is contrasted with the case of\n\u2018ultimate physical\u2019 properties: \u201cExplanation in\nterms of the ultimate physics, though it answers to various interests,\nis not interest relative\u201d (Davidson 1987b, 45). This seems to\ncollapse the distinction between psychology and all the other special\nsciences with respect to the question of anomalism. All of the latter\nanswer to particular explanatory interests, and are thus\nselective with respect to the total sufficient condition for\nan effect-type (see Davidson 1987b, 45); the causal definition, and\nthus anomalism, of their vocabularies is owed to this\ninterest-relativity and selectivity. \u2018Ultimate physics\u2019,\non the other hand, \u201ctreats everything without exception as a\ncause of an event if it lies within physical reach (falls within the\nlight cone leading to the effect)\u201d (Davidson 1987b, 45).\n\nDavidson repeats these sorts of claims about the anomic nature of\ncausally defined properties in a number of places in later writings,\nbut at no point does he clearly bring them into contact with his early\nremarks concerning the constitutive role of rationality in\npsychological ascription. And he never provides argument in support of\nthis general thesis concerning causality. It is natural to wonder why,\ngiven this general thesis about causally defined concepts, rationality\nshould be thought to underwrite mental anomalism. And it becomes\nimperative to know why that general thesis is plausible (for\ndiscussion, see Yalowitz 1998a).\n\nWith regard to the first issue, there is some evidence that Davidson\nis confusing two distinct questions: why mental concepts cannot stand\nin lawlike relation to physical concepts, and why mental concepts\ncannot be eliminated in favor of physical concepts in the explanation\nof human behavior. Given the general thesis about causally defined\nproperties, we have an understanding of why mental concepts are\nanomic. But this leaves open the question whether we ought to continue\nto traffic in anomic concepts generally, and mental concepts in\nparticular. Why not eliminate them in favor of the nomic physical\nconcepts? Here, the rationality of mental concepts may be thought to\nprovide an answer. If we wish to understand why an agent performed the\naction that she did, as opposed to having a full sufficient causal\nexplanation of why her body moved as it did, we are interested in a\nselective explanation\u2014that part of the total sufficient\ncondition that satisfies the particular explanatory interests behind\nreasons-explanations (Davidson 1991, 163). Those interests highlight\nthe normative nature of reason and action\u2014their responsiveness\nto the principle of charity and ideal of rationality. Rationality, on\nthis line of thinking, does not account for mental anomalism; but it\ndoes speak to the question of mental realism (see further\n 6.2).\n (For further discussion of the anomic nature of causally defined\nconcepts and its bearing on Anomalous Monism, see Yalowitz 1998a. For\nmore on the relation between rational explanation and mental realism,\nsee the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.\n For discussion of issues closely related to the causal definition\nargument, see\n 6.3\n and the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism).\n5. Monism\n\nSo far we have looked at Davidson\u2019s three premises in support of\nAnomalous Monism\u2014the interaction, cause-law and anomalism\nprinciples. In this section, we examine the conclusion that Davidson\ndraws on the basis of these principles\u2014the token-identity theory\nof mental events, according to which every causally interacting mental\nevent is token-identical to some physical event. We will look at the\nderivation and nature of this theory, some questions about its\nadequacy, as well as the additional thesis that mental properties\nsupervene on physical properties. As we shall see, both the\ntoken-identity and supervenience claims turn out to be controversial,\nin their motivation as well as in their consistency with mental\nanomalism. One key point to keep in mind at this point is that monism\nis supposed to be derived from the principles and other assumptions\nthat, taken individually, could be acceptable to positions opposing\nmonism.\n\nTo begin with, it is worth pointing out that Davidson is concerned\nonly with the ontological status of events, and not substances.\nDescartes, for instance, argued for the claim that mind and body are\ndistinct entities. While Descartes\u2019 position has implications\nfor accounts of mental events, the issues concerning event and\nsubstance identity are distinct (see Latham 2001). Davidson clearly\ntakes himself to be establishing something that is inconsistent with\nCartesian dualism, however, and it is useful briefly to look at how\nAnomalous Monism bears upon substance dualism.\n\nAccording to Descartes, mind and body are distinct substances in part\nbecause they do not share essential properties in common. In\nparticular, minds do not occupy a spatial location, while bodies\nnecessarily do. Since mental events thus constitute changes occurring\nin a nonspatially-located entity, they also do not occupy a spatial\nregion. Bodily events, on the other hand, do occupy spatial locations\nby virtue of being changes in material substances, which themselves\nare spatially located. On Descartes\u2019 view, then, particular\nmental and physical events cannot be token-identical, since they fail\nto share a crucial property in common without which identity is\nunintelligible. While Anomalous Monism is not officially concerned\nwith the ontological status of substances, it thus appears to have\nconsequences that are inconsistent with Descartes\u2019 substance\ndualism\u2014though it doesn\u2019t by itself establish substance\nmonism, it does rule out the Cartesian thought that mental and\nphysical events fail to be identical, and so conflicts with one of the\nbases for Cartesian substance dualism.\n5.1 Token Identity\n\nThe structure of Davidson\u2019s derivation of the token-identity of\ncausally interacting mental events with physical events appears to be\nstraightforward: causally interacting mental events (the interaction\nprinciple) must instantiate some strict law property (the cause-law\nprinciple) but mental properties are not suitable for inclusion in\nstrict laws (the anomalism principle). So mental events must\ninstantiate some other property, which is suitable for such inclusion.\nGiven Davidson\u2019s invocation of the causal closure of the\nphysical domain, according to which every physical event has a\nphysical explanation, he moves rather quickly to the conclusion that\nthis other property must be physical, since closure entails that\nphysical properties have a privileged status, which suggests that they\nhold out the promise of strict laws. (Davidson also has a tendency\nsimply to identify as \u2018physical\u2019 those properties that\nfigure in strict laws (Davidson 1970, 224; 1995a, 266), but this would\nof course beg the question of mental anomalism.) Consequently,\ncausally interacting mental events must be token-identical with\nphysical events, ruling out Cartesian as well as other forms of\ndualism.\n\nThere are serious problems with the assumption of causal closure of\nthe physical in Davidson\u2019s framework (for discussion, see the\nsupplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Anomalous Monism).\n It is difficult, however, to see how Davidson can move from the claim\nthat mental events must instantiate non-mental, strict law properties\nto the claim that these properties must be physical without assuming\nclosure. Why assume that only \u2018physical\u2019 properties are\nnomic? This raises interesting issues about the nomic status of other\nspecial sciences\u2014the relevant ones here being biology and\nchemistry\u2014but there do not appear to be explicit, conclusive\nresources in Davidson\u2019s own thinking for addressing this.\nYalowitz 1998a has, however, provided an interpretation of Anomalous\nMonism stressing Davidson\u2019s views on causality and the nomic\nstatus of dispositions (see\n 4.3)\n in which causal closure is derived from the\ncause-law principle, token-identity and the anomalism of causally\ndefined properties. On this interpretation, the strict law properties\nthat mental events must instantiate turn out to be physical because\nonly physical properties are non-causally individuated\u2014all\nspecial science properties are causally individuated, and all such\nproperties are anomic.\n\nDavidson\u2019s token-identity theory is dramatically different than\nprevious identity theories of mind, in both it\u2019s a\npriori status as well as its stance towards the role of laws in\njustifying monism. Previous theories had argued that claims concerning\nthe identity of particular mental and physical events depended upon\nthe discovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical\nproperties. These theories thus held that empirical evidence\nsupporting such laws was required for particular identity claims.\nAccording to Anomalous Monism, however, it is precisely\nbecause there can be no such strict laws that causally\ninteracting mental events must be identical to some physical\nevent. The token-identity thesis thus requires no empirical evidence\nand depends on there being no lawlike relations. It in effect\njustifies the token-identity of mental and physical events through\narguing for the impossibility of type-identities between mental and\nphysical properties or kinds (Davidson 1970, 209, 212\u201313; see\nJohnston 1985).\n\nAn important point to recognize in Davidson\u2019s version of\ntoken-identity is that he is not simply deriving the conclusion that\nmental events bear some property that we would intuitively acknowledge\nas \u2018physical\u2019 (such as spatial location). As pointed out\nin\n 2.1,\n the relevant \u2018physical\u2019 properties would more likely have\nto resemble the sorts of properties currently invoked in physics, our\nmost mature science and the one closest to issuing in strict laws.\nThis point has generated numerous objections to Davidson\u2019s\ntoken-identity theory, but it also has been overlooked by some\nobjectors (see below). Davidson\u2019s central claim is that what\nmakes a mental event identical to a physical event is that the mental\nevent has a physical description. In Davidson\u2019s original\nformulation, monism entailed that every mental event can be\nuniquely singled out using only physical concepts (1970,\n215). It is this position that became the target of some\nDavidson\u2019s critics\n (5.2).\n However, Davidson eventually came to explicitly deny that his monism\ncommits him to the possibility of providing descriptions of mental\nevents or actions in physical terms suitable for strict laws (Davidson\n1999d, 639; 1999b, 653\u20134). He noted that strict laws will say\nsomething to the effect that \u201cwhenever there is a certain\ndistribution of forces and matter in a field of a certain size at time\nt, it will be followed by a certain distribution of forces\nand matter in a field of a certain size at time\nt\u2032\u201d (Davidson 1999d, 639). And he claimed that\nboth the antecedents and consequents of such laws, when covering\nparticular mental events and actions, will cover much larger regions\nof space than merely the agent or her action. Why? Because while\nsingular causal statements are singular, and therefore select\nfrom a complete set of causal factors those that are salient or in\nline with our particular explanatory interests, strict laws\ndon\u2019t themselves select\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s what makes\nthem strict\u201d (Davidson 1999d, 640; see Yalowitz 1998a for an\nextended discussion of this issue and its bearing on the argument for\nboth mental anomalism as well as monism). Davidson soft-pedals how\nthis view bears on the uniqueness claim in the official statement of\nAnomalous Monism, parsing away that claim in favor of the blander idea\nthat \u201csome physical description applies to each mental\nevent\u201d (Davidson 1999b, 654). As subtle as it seems, this\nappears to be a fundamental shift in Davidson\u2019s thinking about\nmonism, though it goes unexplored in his later work and has failed to\nattract the attention of his critics.\n\nIn any case, Anomalous Monism thus does not inherit the problem of how\nto justify specific identifications between mental and physical\nevents, because the claim that there is a physical description for\neach mental event is established purely a priori. And the\nphysical descriptions are not (indeed, cannot be) specifiable in\nprecise and uniquely identifying spatial and temporal terms. As we are\nabout to see\n (5.2),\n each of these points is overlooked by many of Davidson\u2019s\ncritics. That the latter is overlooked is understandable, given its\nlate appearance. However, the former point has always been\nfundamental, and critics\u2019 failure to appreciate it is\ncurious.\n\nDavidson additionally claims that the relation between the mental and\nphysical properties is not merely haphazard or coincidental. A\nrelationship of supervenience obtains between the two (Davidson 1970,\n214; 1973a, 253; 1993; 1995a, 266). (Davidson never argues for\nsupervenience. For discussion, see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical.)\n A working statement of this relationship is that if two events fail\nto share a mental property, they will fail to share at least one\nphysical property (Davidson 1995a, 266)\u2014or, equivalently, if two\nevents share all of their physical properties, they will share all of\ntheir mental properties. It is meant to articulate a kind of\ndependency of the mental on the physical, and correlatively a kind of\nexplanatory primacy to the physical, but without claiming any kind of\nreductive relation between the mental and the physical. The working\nstatement\u2019s truth depends, it seems, on the thought that the\ndistribution of physical properties somehow explains the\ndistribution of mental properties\u2014failure to share a mental\nproperty depends upon/is explained by failure to share at\nleast one physical property. The supervenience relation is usually\nunderstood to issue in generalizations of the following kind:\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\n\u2018P2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\netc. (where antecedent and consequent occur at the same time). This\nallows for the empirical possibility that a number of different\nphysical state kinds underlie the same mental state kind (for more on\nthis, see the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). However, it also\nappears to suggest the existence of lawlike relations between physical\nand mental properties, and so to be in tension with mental anomalism.\nThis issue will be explored in\n 5.3.\n5.2 Objections to Token Identity\n\nThe token-identity thesis has been the subject of a number of\ninteresting criticisms. Many of them, however, are difficult to bring\nfully into contact with Davidson\u2019s own particular version of the\nthesis, primarily because Davidson\u2019s version is derived a\npriori from the other premises in his framework. So, for\ninstance, it has been argued that mental events do not bear the burden\nof the spatiotemporal precision of physical events that they would\nneed to if the former were genuinely identical to the latter (Hornsby\n1981; Leder 1985). For example, it would seem arbitrary to identify\nthe deduction of some conclusion from a chain of reasoning with some\nparticular neural event or set of neural events occurring at a\nspecific time and place in the brain\u2014especially given the\nmicro-precision of the neural framework. Compare attempting to provide\nphysical description for the action of paying back a debt\u2014how\ndoes one determine the spatial and temporal parameters with the\nprecision demanded by the language of physics? Distinguishing between\n\u201cthe\u201d physical event, as opposed to its causes and its\neffects, can seem daunting if not outright nonsensical (Leder 1985;\nsee also di Pinedo 2006). Further, it has been argued that the only\npossible empirical evidence for specific token-identity claims could\nbe type-identities between either those or other mental and physical\nproperties, because evidence needs to be drawn from variant cases in\norder to sort out merely coincident from identical events (Leder\n1985).\n\nSuch criticisms become difficult to evaluate given Davidson\u2019s\na priori procedure for establishing the token-identity\nthesis. He can respond that we already know, a priori, that\nany particular mental event must instantiate some physical property if\nit causally interacts with any mental or physical event, given the\ncause-law and anomalism principles. Questions about how this physical\nproperty, whatever it is, relates to properties currently invoked in\nneuroscience come later and are necessarily secondary to this monistic\nconclusion. And there is no guarantee (indeed, it is quite unlikely)\nthat neuroscientific properties currently in vogue are candidates for\nstrict-law properties. As we have just seen\n (5.1),\n Davidson eventually came to explicitly associate the physical\nproperties that cover mental events with broad descriptions covering\nlarge space-time regions. Further, it would confuse epistemology with\nmetaphysics to insist that, because we can only establish which\nphysical property some mental token event instantiates by leaning on\nsome type-correlations between other mental and physical properties,\ntoken-identity claims presuppose type-identity. How we discover the\nparticular physical properties is one thing; whether there can be\npsychophysical laws is quite another, and not settled by the method of\ndiscovery.\n\nWe also need to keep in mind that Davidson embraces the possibility of\nsubstantive mental-physical correlations (ceteris paribus\npsychophysical laws), which directly address these epistemological\nissues. More generally, Davidson\u2019s token-identity claim is that\nthe predicates that come to form the vocabulary of the as-yet unknown\nstrict-law science will be capable of being used to describe mental\nevents. While we cannot judge this claim by appealing to features of\ncurrent neuroscience, it also seems that it should be possible to\nadjudicate conceivability concerns. And, putting aside\nDavidson\u2019s later views, while we are not currently in the\nbusiness of assigning fine-grained spatiotemporal parameters to mental\nevents, it does not seem obvious that we couldn\u2019t come to accept\nsuch assignments on the basis of theoretical considerations without\nthereby committing ourselves to the existence of type-identities.\nHowever, Davidson\u2019s official position, early and late, has\nalways been that we do not need to be capable of making such\nassignments in order to assert token-identity\u2014there must simply\nbe such true assignments, and this is something we know on the basis\nof a purely a priori argument. (Davidson 1999b; for further\ndiscussion of this issue, see the supplement on\n Related Views\n (Bare Materialism); for a different criticism of token-identity, see\nthe supplement on\n Related Views\n (Other Positions). For a criticism based upon Davidson\u2019s own\ntreatment of causal explanation, see Horgan and Tye 1985. For\ndiscussion of the criticism that Davidson\u2019s monism is too weak\nto warrant the label \u2018materialism\u2019, see the supplement on\n Token-Identity and Minimal Materialism).\n5.3 Is Supervenience Consistent with Mental Anomalism?\n\nWe have seen that Davidson supplements his monism with a claim of\nsupervenience. There are many different conceptions of the\nsupervenience relation (see Kim 1993b), and Davidson ultimately came\nto identify his version with what is called \u201cweak\u201d\nsupervenience, in contrast to \u201cstrong\u201d and\n\u201cglobal\u201d supervenience. Briefly, the basic differences\nbetween these positions are as follows. Weak supervenience links\nspecific mental and physical properties within but not across possible\nworlds, while strong supervenience links those properties across\nworlds. Global supervenience links the class of mental properties as a\nwhole with the class of physical properties as a whole within but not\nacross worlds, but does not constrain relations between specific pairs\nof mental and physical properties. Weak supervenience comes down to\nthe view that mental properties depend upon those physical properties\nthey are correlated with within a particular possible world, but those\nvery same physical properties may, in another possible world,\ncorrelate with very different (or even no) mental properties. Weak\nsupervenience is thus stronger than global supervenience, in that it\nposits correlations between particular pairs of mental and physical\nproperties, but weaker than strong supervenience in that it recognizes\nthe possibility that these correlations can fail to obtain in other\npossible worlds. (It should be noted that Davidson never brought his\nviews on supervenience into contact with his later views, noted above,\nabout the broad nature of the physical properties that mental events\nmust instantiate according to Anomalous Monism. It is not at all clear\nwhether or how these views can be combined. In the following\ndiscussion of supervenience, this complication will be ignored, and it\nwill be assumed that the physical properties in question are not of\nthis broad nature, since this is how Davidson\u2019s own discussions\nof supervenience seem to proceed, and certainly what his critics\npresuppose.)\n\nThe puzzling aspect of Davidson\u2019s doctrine of supervenience\narises independently of fine points of the disagreement between the\ncompeting conceptions of supervenience sketched above. Whether the\ndependency is between particular mental and physical properties, or\nsets of the two, and whether or not the dependency holds only within\nor also across possible worlds, it appears that it entails that there\nwill exist strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be\npredicted and explained that were supposed to be ruled out by the\nanomalism principle. Davidson sometimes claims (Davidson 1995a, 266)\nthat supervenience is actually entailed by Anomalous Monism,\nin which case it would appear to follow that Anomalous Monism itself\nis an inconsistent theory\u2014entailing both that there cannot be\nany strict psychophysical laws (the anomalism principle) and that\nthere must be such laws (supervenience). But generally his position\nappears to be that Anomalous Monism is simply consistent with\nsupervenience (Davidson 1993, 7). If supervenience and Anomalous\nMonism are indeed inconsistent, and the former is rejected, the\nquestion of the plausibility of a materialist position with no\ndiscernible relation between mental and physical properties arises\n(see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n (The caveat about the relation between Davidson\u2019s later views\nabout physical descriptions and supervenience noted at the end of\n 5.1.\n should be kept in mind here.)\n\nWhy does supervenience appear to generate strict laws? When Davidson\nfirst stated the supervenience claim, he articulated it in the\nfollowing terms: \u201cthere cannot be two events alike in all\nphysical respects but differing in some mental respects\u201d\n(Davidson 1970, 214)). This formulation appears to entail strict\npsychophysical laws of the form\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\nM1\u2019. Davidson later came to focus on the\ninversion of this formulation: \u201cif two events fail to share a\nmental property, they will fail to share at least one physical\nproperty\u201d (Davidson 1995a, 266). The advantage of this\nreformulation is that it brings out the fact that the requisite\nphysical differences need not be the same in each case of\nmental difference (see Davidson 1973a, 253\u20134). As Davidson says,\n\n\n\nalthough supervenience entails that any change in a mental property\np of a particular event e will be accompanied by a\nchange in the physical properties of e, it does not entail\nthat a change in p in other events will be accompanied by an\nidentical change in the physical properties of those other events.\nOnly the latter entailment would conflict with [Anomalous Monism].\n(Davidson 1993, 7)\n\n\nThere seem to be two problems here, however. First, the inverted\nreformulation actually entails the original thesis\u2014that if two\nevents share all physical properties they will share all mental\nproperties\u2014and so once again generates strict psychophysical\nlaws. Second, even if the accompanied physical changes can be\ndifferent, that simply generates more strict psychophysical\nlaws\u2014\u2018\nP1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\n\u2018P2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\nand so on. So it is hard to see why Davidson thinks that the second\nformulation is consistent with the anomalism principle.\n\nSome defenders of Davidson (Child 1992, 224; see also Davidson 1973,\n258) have responded to the apparent tension between supervenience and\nmental anomalism by emphasizing that the degree of detail that would\nhave to go into the formulation of such laws would make them useless\nfor prediction, since it is unlikely that the relevant initial\nconditions will repeat. But as we have seen\n (4.2.3),\n this seems to be true of any candidate for a strict law\u2014it must\ntake into account all possible interfering conditions, and doing so\nbecomes quite unwieldy for generating predictions. And in any case,\nsuch laws would still provide strict explanations of mental\nevents, contrary to Davidson\u2019s own formulation of mental\nanomalism. So the problem that supervenience \u2018laws\u2019 seem\nto pose for the anomalism principle remains.\n\nOther defenders of Davidson (see Macdonalds 1986) have responded to\nthis problem by arguing that the existence of strict supervenience\nlaws is compatible with mental anomalism so long as we are not\nactually able to state any such laws and thus be in a position to use\nthem to predict and explain actual mental events\u2014which is\ncertainly the case currently and likely for the foreseeable future.\nThis suggestion exploits a literal reading of Davidson\u2019s\nofficial statement of the anomalism principle, which denies the\npossibility of strict laws on the basis of which mental events can\nbe explained or predicted. But in doing so, it makes Anomalous\nMonism into a much weaker position, dependent on the cognitive\nlimitations of human beings. It in effect becomes a contingent\nepistemological position rather than the necessary metaphysical\ndoctrine it purports to be.\n\nDavidson in one place offers a very different suggestion in response\nto the problem. He claims that the supervenient relations between\nmental and physical predicates that he envisages are of a ceteris\nparibus nature. He accepts the requirement that any satisfactory\naccount of the relation between mental and physical properties must\npermit appeal to local correlations and dependencies between specific\nmental and physical properties (Davidson 1993, 9). But he blocks any\nentailment from this requirement to strict psychophysical laws,\nsuggesting that such \u2018correlations\u2019 and\n\u2018dependencies\u2019 are of a ceteris paribus form.\n\nSuch a ceteris paribus conception of supervenience has not\nbeen discussed in the extensive literature on the topic (its\npossibility is recognized and endorsed by Kim 1995, 136; however, see\nKim 1993, 24\u201325) and it is unclear whether it can deliver a\nsuitably strong notion of dependency to satisfy materialist\nintuitions. But it does seem to be an attractive way of reconciling\nsupervenience with mental anomalism so that Anomalous Monism remains a\nconsistent theory.\n6. The Epiphenomenalism Objections\n\nIt has been widely held that Anomalous Monism cannot avoid\nepiphenomenalism\u2014the view that mental events lack\ncausal/explanatory powers. At a first approximation, the concern\nderives from a tension between mental anomalism and the apparently\nprivileged status assigned to physical properties in Davidson\u2019s\nframework\u2014in particular, that all events are physical, and all\nphysical events have a strict explanation in terms of other physical\nevents. It then becomes an important question what sort of\ncausal/explanatory role mental properties can play when all events\nalready have a physical explanation.\n\nSome welcome this result, holding that mental events explain actions\nin a sui generis way not accountable for in the terms of\ntypical scientific explanations (see von Wright 1971; Stoutland 1976;\nWilson 1985; Ginet 1995; Campbell 1998 and 2005 and related discussion\nin the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism).\n Many, however, see this charge as devastating to the prospects of\nAnomalous Monism\u2019s attempt to occupy a position between\nreductionist materialism and dualism. Without a distinctive causal\nrole for mental events to play in the explanation of action, many\nthink that they would lack the sort of robust reality needed to\ncompete with reductionism and dualism. On this way of thinking, only\ncausal powers can justify mental realism. So if Anomalous Monism\ncannot avoid epiphenomenalism, it appears to open the door to\neliminativist materialism, which holds that mental vocabulary and\nexplanations are vacuous and ought to be thrown out and replaced by\nneuroscience (assuming, which seems extremely doubtful, that\nneuroscience can itself supply strict laws\u2014if not, then this\nline of thought would lead to throwing out all but\n\u2018physical\u2019 strict law properties and explanations).\n\nAs noted, the epiphenomenalist worry arises from two points that are\nabsolutely basic to Anomalous Monism\u2014first, that mental events\nare at the same time physical events, and, second, that while mental\npredicates cannot figure into strict causal laws, physical predicates\nmust. Early critics moved quickly from these points to the\nepiphenomenalist conclusion that mental properties are causally\nirrelevant, because there are always strict law\nproperties\u2014physical properties\u2014to causally explain the\noccurrence of an event. (For detailed discussion of this line of\nargument, see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance.)\n Among many other problems with this line of argument, however, there\nis the one immediately capitalized on by Davidson: that within the\nextensionalist metaphysical framework in which Anomalous Monism is\ndeveloped\n (2.1\n above), properties don\u2019t cause anything, and so can be neither\ncausally relevant nor irrelevant. According the Davidson, only events\nare causal relata. He expresses general skepticism about\nepiphenomenalist objections to Anomalous Monism that depend on the\nidea that events cause \u2018by virtue\u2019 of the properties they\ninstantiate (Davidson 1993, 6, 13). This is closely connected to his\nsharp distinction between causation\u2014a metaphysical relation\nbetween particular events independently of how they are\ndescribed\u2014and explanation\u2014which relates events only as\nthey are described in particular ways. But as we will now see, this\ndoesn\u2019t end the concerns about epiphenomenalism. (For related\ndiscussion concerning epiphenomenalism and its bearing on the\nrelationship between Anomalous Monism and human freedom, see \n Related Issues: 3.2 Anomalous Monism and Contemporary Compatibilism.)\n6.1 Mental Properties and Explanatory Relevance\n\nCritics of this extensionalist line of defense insisted that related\nquestions remained about Anomalous Monism even taking into account the\ndistinction between causation and explanation. In particular, they\nquestioned whether mental properties could play any genuine\nexplanatory role\u2014whether they had explanatory\nrelevance\u2014given the priority assigned to physical\nproperties in Davidson\u2019s framework. Why think that mental\nproperties explain anything given that the events which instantiate\nthem always also instantiate physical properties that figure in causal\nlaws? One thought here is that genuine explanations require laws, and\nmental anomalism, in ruling out psychological and psychophysical laws,\ncannot account for any explanatory role for mental properties vis a\nvis physical or mental events.\n\nIn response, Davidson notes that while Anomalous Monism rejects the\npossibility of strict laws in which mental predicates can figure, it\nallows for ceteris paribus psychological and psychophysical\nlaws (Davidson 1993, 9\u201312). His point appears to be that if\nbacking by law is sufficient for explanatory relevance, then mental\nproperties are explanatorily relevant. (Davidson and his critics often\nslide between the issues of causal and explanatory relevance, but the\nlatter issue is clearly what is at stake given Davidson\u2019s views\nabout causal efficacy and properties.) Second, Davidson appeals to the\nsupervenience of mental properties on physical properties in order to\nground the explanatory role of mental properties. Davidson says\nthat\n\n\nproperties are causally efficacious if they make a difference to what\nindividual events cause, and supervenience ensures that\nmental properties do make a difference to what mental events cause.\n(Davidson 1993, 15)\n\n\nThe first point does not get developed by Davidson in any systematic\nway, though it has been explored by others interested in defending\nnonreductive monism from epiphenomenalist concerns. Some have focused\non exploiting ceteris paribus covering laws for\npsychophysical causal relations, claiming that this allows mental\nproperties to be sufficient for their effects, thus providing the\nneeded type of explanatory role (McLaughlin 1989; Fodor 1989, 1991).\nOthers have attempted to sidestep the issue of covering laws entirely\nby appealing directly to the truth of psychological and psychophysical\ncounterfactuals in grounding the explanatory role of mental properties\n(LePore and Loewer 1987, 1989; Horgan 1989). Davidson himself instead\nfocused on supervenience (although as we are about to see, the\npossibility of ceteris paribus laws enters into his\naccount).\n\nSupervenience implies that\n\n\nif two events differ in their psychological properties, they differ in\ntheir physical properties (which we assume to be causally\nefficacious). If supervenience holds, psychological properties make a\ndifference to the causal relations of an event, for they matter to the\nphysical properties, and the physical properties matter to causal\nrelations. (Davidson 1993, 14) \n\n\nThe point here is not simply that mental properties inherit or\npiggyback on the causal powers of the physical properties on which\nthey supervene. Rather, Davidson appears to be claiming that mental\nproperties influence the causal powers of their subvenient\nphysical properties.\n\nOne problem with Davidson\u2019s response here is its reversal of the\ndependency relationship between mental and physical properties\ntypically claimed in supervenience relationships. A central rationale\nfor positing supervenience is to mark a kind of explanatory primacy to\nthe subvenient properties (see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n And this is reflected in the first part of Davidson\u2019s\nformulation above\u2014surely a difference in psychological\nproperties entails (requires) a difference in physical properties\nbecause the difference in physical properties is needed in\norder to explain the difference in psychological properties.\nSo the sense in which psychological properties \u2018matter\u2019 to\nphysical properties is that changing the former amounts to a change in\nthe latter because a change in the latter explains a change\nin the former. This does not appear to be helpful in establishing the\nexplanatory relevance of mental properties. Another problem, discussed\nabove\n (5.3),\n is that it is difficult to see how a supervenience relation of\nsufficient power to make mental properties explanatory of an\nevent\u2019s physical properties in the way Davidson seems to suggest\ndoes not issue in strict laws. So it is unclear how supervenience is\nconsistent with the anomalism principle, and thus how it can help\nblock epiphenomenalist concerns, although we did previously note one\npotentially worthwhile but unexplored possibility\u2014a ceteris\nparibus supervenience relation\u2014which Davidson endorses.\n6.2 Interest-Relativity and the Dual Explananda Strategy\n\nKim has explored a related but different route from Anomalous Monism\nto mental epiphenomenalism\u2014the problem of explanatory exclusion\n(Kim 1989, 44). A causal explanation of an event cites a sufficient\ncondition for that event\u2019s occurrence. This seems to exclude the\npossibility of other independent causes or explanations of that event.\nSo if, as Anomalous Monism entails, physics can provide a sufficient\nexplanation of any particular event, there appears to be no room for\nan independent and irreducible mental explanation of an event\n(Davidson 1993, 15). It is because the cause instantiated some\nparticular physical property that the effect (which happens to\ninstantiate a mental property) came about. Any mental properties that\nthe cause instantiates seem superfluous in explaining why the effect\noccurred\u2014unless those properties are identical or related in\nsome strict lawlike way to the physical properties, something ruled\nout by the anomalism principle.\n\nDavidson responds by arguing that citing only the physical properties\nof the cause to provide a sufficient explanation of an action does not\naddress the particular interests that psychological explanations of\nactions serve\u2014providing the reasons of the agent in light of\nwhich she performed the action that she did. Serving these explanatory\ninterests compensates for the fact that such explanations cannot be\nsharpened into strict laws or folded neatly into physical laws\n(Davidson 1991, 163). We only understand why the agent waved her\nhand\u2014why the effect is of the mental kind \u2018waving\none\u2019s hand\u2019 (as opposed to merely \u2018one\u2019s hand\ngoing up and down\u2019)\u2014by citing mental properties\nof the causing event, such as her wanting to greet her friend. The\ncitation of physical properties of the causing event and the\nassociated mere bodily movement will not bring about such\nunderstanding, assuming mental anomalism, because of the lack of any\nreductive relationship between either the physical properties of the\ncause and the agent\u2019s reasons or the physical properties of the\neffect and the agent\u2019s action.\n\nHere we see the interest-relativity of explanation and its bearing on\nexplanatory relevance (see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance)\n playing an important role for Davidson. Mental properties must be\ncited if we want a rational explanation of mental\neffects. Davidson\u2019s response to epiphenomenalist concerns can\nthus be described as a kind of \u2018dual explananda\u2019\ntheory of the explanatory role of mental properties. According to this\ntheory, for every (causally interacting) mental event there are two\ndistinct explananda in need of explanation: an event of a\ncertain physical type and an event of a certain mental type. Mental\nproperties are accorded an ineliminable and (given Anomalous Monism)\nirreducible explanatory role by virtue of their singular capacity to\nmake intelligible the occurrence of other mental properties through\nthe sui generis relation of rationalization. This reflects\nthe point made at the end of\n 4.3\n by the causal definition interpretation of the argument for mental\nanomalism: that rationality underlies, not mental anomalism, but\nrather mental realism. (For related discussion of the dual\nexplananda approach, see Macdonalds 1995 and Gibbons\n2006.)\n\nIt should be noted, however, that it is not the case that\nonly mental properties can explain and be explained by the\noccurrence of mental properties. That would lead to an\n\u201coutlet\u201d problem, with mental properties being\nexplanatorily insulated from physical properties\u2014something\ninconsistent with the way in which we ordinarily think of\nmental-physical interaction. A blow to the head can, for instance,\nexplain the occurrence of a thought. And a thought can explain the\nmovement of an object, as when my decision to quench my thirst leads\nto the movement of a glass of water to my lips. However, the blow\ncannot rationalize the thought, and the decision cannot rationalize\nthe movement of the glass (though it can rationalize the\naction of moving the glass). Davidson\u2019s dual\nexplananda strategy provides no account of such phenomena\n(for discussion of the outlet problem, see Gibbons 2006). Nonetheless,\nso long as there are occurrences of mental properties in need of the\ndistinctive kind of explanation provided by rationalization, mental\nproperties occupy an ineliminable explanatory role. And given\nAnomalous Monism, that role is irreducible. It is worth noting that\nthis dual explananda strategy is consistent with\nDavidson\u2019s commitment to the causal closure of the physical\ndomain (Crane 1995 seems to miss this point)\u2014every physical\nevent can have a physical explanation, even if the mental component of\nsome physical events can be rationally explained only through appeal\nto mental components of the causing event. Therefore, however causal\nclosure ultimately enters into Anomalous Monism (see the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical and Anomalous Monism),\n it does not appear to create any further problems for Anomalous\nMonism\u2019s ability to account for the ineliminable, irreducible\nexplanatory role of mental properties.\n\nThe interest-relativity of causal explanation is thus crucial in\nDavidson\u2019s grounding of the ineliminable explanatory role of\nmental properties within the framework of Anomalous Monism. If, as\nAnomalous Monism contends, mental event-types such as actions are not\nreducible to physical-event types, then the only way to explain\nactions (as opposed to mere bodily movements) so as to make them\nintelligible is by appeal to the mental properties of the\ncause\u2014reasons. (For discussion of whether, in light of this,\nreason explanations can still be maintained to be causal\nexplanations within the framework of Anomalous Monism, see the\nsupplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.)\n6.3 The Causal Constitution of Reasons\n\nA final point to consider in evaluating the epiphenomenalist\nobjections to Anomalous Monism is the way in which causality enters\ninto the constitution of reasons and reasons-explanations according to\nDavidson. Before we have established the anomalism principle, or go on\nto derive monism, we already know that reasons explain actions by\ncausing them (the \u2018because\u2019 problem discussed in\n 2.2).\n And, as we have seen\n (4.3),\n we know that propositional attitudes and mental contents are\nindividuated, and thus defined, partially in terms of what they are\ncaused by and cause (for attitudes, see Davidson 1987b, 41; for\ncontents, see Davidson 1987a, 444, and extended discussion in the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). But if something cannot\neven be recognized as a reason unless it is a cause, then the charge\nthat mental properties are causally impotent appears to have\ndifficulty getting any traction. And since these claims are prior to\nthe argument for monism, they are neutral about whatever else reasons\nmust be in order to be causes. So reasons must be recognized as causes\nprior to any discovery that they are also physical events. This\nappears to secure the causal potency of reasons in a way entirely\nindependent of the claim of token-identity. Within Davidson\u2019s\nframework, reasons can only play the rationalizing and explanatory\nrole that they do by virtue of their causal nature.\n\nMany of Anomalous Monism\u2019s epiphenomenalist critics do not\naddress this rich causal background. As we have seen, the background\nis not sufficient by itself to silence all epiphenomenalist concerns.\nBut it does significantly affect how those concerns can be formulated\nand addressed. Anomalous Monism is clearly deeply committed, at a\nnumber of levels, to the causal explanatory relevance of the mental,\nand so charity suggests that we try to understood it in a way such\nthat these commitments are respected. The dual explananda\nstrategy discussed above\n (6.2)\n provides one promising framework for doing this, while at the same\ntime displaying sensitivity to the sorts of concerns driving the\nepiphenomenalist objections.\n7. Conclusion\n\nDespite the initial appearance of simplicity in its assumptions,\nstructure and argumentation, we have turned up several important\nproblems and lacunae that stand in the way of any overall final\nassessment of the plausibility of Anomalous Monism. While the central\nobjections it has faced have derived from epiphenomenalist concerns,\nthe force of these objections is not clear. Arguably, the most serious\ndifficulties for Anomalous Monism are not with its adequacy but with\nits justification. We still stand in need of a clear argument for how\nrationality leads to the anomalism principle; there are the\nsubstantial problems surrounding the status of the causal closure of\nthe physical and its bearing on monism; and the cause-law\nprinciple\u2019s strictness requirement is still in need of a\ncompelling rationale. Even with these problems, Anomalous Monism\ncontinues to provide an extremely useful framework for exploring\nfundamental issues and problems in the philosophy of mind, and has\nearned a central place on the rather short list of important positions\non the relation between mental and physical events and properties.",
