Aristotle\u2019s\nPosterior Analytics contains his account of demonstrations\nand their role in knowledge. From a modern perspective, we might think\nthat this subject moves outside of logic to epistemology. From\nAristotle\u2019s perspective, however, the connection of the theory\nof sullogismoi with the theory of knowledge is especially\nclose.\n",
