    "main_text": "Why the Distinction Matters\n7. Conclusion.\n\nThe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is extremely important to\na wide range of debates in normative philosophy. Yet the distinction\nis often drawn in very different ways, with the risk that philosophers\nare simply talking past one another. In this entry, different ways of\ndrawing the distinction have been distinguished, and the virtues of a\nmodified version of the principle-based approach has been defended.\nThe distinction so drawn is different from a wide range of other\ndistinctions with which it might easily be confused; these\ndistinctions are laid out here to help guard against such confusions.\nFinally, the distinction so drawn is an important one in structuring\ncentral debates in normative theory, such as how to understand the\ndivide between consequentialists and deontologists.\n",
