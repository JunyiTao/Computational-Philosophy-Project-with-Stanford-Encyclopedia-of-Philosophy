    "main_text": "Modal Conditions || Safety\n5.2 Safety\n\nAlthough few epistemologists today endorse a sensitivity condition on\nknowledge, the idea that knowledge requires a subject to stand in a\nparticular modal relation to the proposition known remains a popular\none. In his 1999 paper, \u201cHow to Defeat Opposition to\nMoore\u201d, Ernest Sosa proposed that a safety condition\nought to take the role that sensitivity was intended to play. Sosa\ncharacterized safety as the counterfactual contrapositive of\nsensitivity.\n\nSensitivity:\nIf p were false, S would not believe that p.\n\n\nSafety:\nIf S were to believe that p, p would not be\n false.[18]\n\nAlthough contraposition is valid for the material conditional \\((A\n\\supset B\\) iff \\(\\mathord{\\sim} B \\supset \\mathord{\\sim}A)\\),\nSosa suggests that it is invalid for counterfactuals, which is why\nsensitivity and safety are not equivalent. An example of a safe belief\nthat is not sensitive, according to Sosa, is the belief that a distant\nskeptical scenario does not obtain. If we stipulate that George,\ndiscussed above, has never been at risk of being the victim of a\nCartesian demon\u2014because, say, Cartesian demons do not exist in\nGeorge\u2019s world\u2014then George\u2019s belief that he is not\nsuch a victim is a safe one, even though we saw in the previous\nsection that it could not be sensitive. Notice that although we\nstipulated that George is not at risk of deceit by Cartesian demons,\nwe did not stipulate that George himself had any particular\naccess to this fact. Unless he does, safety, like sensitivity, will be\nan externalist condition on knowledge in the\n\u201caccess\u201d sense. It is also externalist in the\n\u201cstate\u201d sense, since the truth of the relevant\ncounterfactuals will depend on features outside the subject.\n\nCharacterizing safety in these counterfactual terms depends on\nsubstantive assumptions about the semantics of counterfactual\n conditionals.[19]\n If we were to accept, for instance, David Lewis\u2019s or Robert\nStalnaker\u2019s treatment of counterfactuals, including a strong\ncentering condition according to which the actual world is always\nuniquely closest, all true beliefs would count as safe according to\nthe counterfactual analysis of\n safety.[20]\n Sosa intends the relevant counterfactuals to be making a stronger\nclaim, requiring roughly that in all nearby worlds in which\nS believes that p, p is not false.\n\nRather than resting on a contentious treatment of counterfactuals,\nthen, it may be most perspicuous to understand the safety condition\nmore directly in these modal terms, as Sosa himself often does:\n\n\nSafety:\n\nIn all nearby worlds where S believes that p, p\nis not false.\n\n\nWhether a JTB+safety analysis of knowledge could be successful is\nsomewhat difficult to evaluate, given the vagueness of the stated\n\u201cnearby\u201d condition. The status of potential\ncounterexamples will not always be straightforward to apply. For\nexample, Juan Comesa\u00f1a (2005) presents a case he takes to\nrefute the requirement that knowledge be safe. In\nComesa\u00f1a\u2019s example, the host of a Halloween party enlists\nJudy to direct guests to the party. Judy\u2019s instructions are to\ngive everyone the same directions, which are in fact accurate, but\nthat if she sees Michael, the party will be moved to another location.\n(The host does not want Michael to find the party.) Suppose Michael\nnever shows up. If a given guest does not, but very nearly does,\ndecide to wear a very realistic Michael costume to the party, then his\nbelief, based in Judy\u2019s testimony, about the whereabouts of the\nparty will be true, but could, Comesa\u00f1a says, easily have been\nfalse. (Had he merely made a slightly different choice about his\ncostume, he would have been deceived.) Comesa\u00f1a describes the\ncase as a counterexample to a safety condition on knowledge. However,\nit is open to a safety theorist to argue that the relevant skeptical\nscenario, though possible and in some sense nearby, is not\nnear enough in the relevant respect to falsify the safety condition.\nSuch a theorist would, if she wanted the safety condition to deliver\nclear verdicts, face the task of articulating just what the relevant\nnotion of similarity amounts to (see also Bogardus 2014).\n\nNot all further clarifications of a safety condition will be suitable\nfor the use of the latter in an analysis of knowledge. In particular,\nif the respect of similarity that is relevant for safety is itself\nexplicated in terms of knowledge, then an analysis of knowledge which\nmade reference to safety would be in this respect circular. This, for\ninstance, is how Timothy Williamson characterizes safety. He writes,\nin response to a challenge by Alvin Goldman:\n\n\nIn many cases, someone with no idea of what knowledge is would be\nunable to determine whether safety obtained. Although they could use\nthe principle that safety entails truth to exclude some cases, those\nare not the interesting ones. Thus Goldman will be disappointed when\nhe asks what the safety account predicts about various examples in\nwhich conflicting considerations pull in different directions. One may\nhave to decide whether safety obtains by first deciding whether\nknowledge obtains, rather than vice versa. (Williamson 2009: 305)\n\n\nBecause safety is understood only in terms of knowledge, safety so\nunderstood cannot serve in an analysis of knowledge. Nor is it\nWilliamson\u2019s intent that it should do so; as we will see below,\nWilliamson rejects the project of analyzing knowledge. This is of\ncourse consistent with claiming that safety is a necessary condition\non knowledge in the straightforward sense that the latter entails the\nformer.\n",
