    "main_text": "\n\nJuan Luis Vives (1493\u20131540) was a Spanish humanist and\neducational theorist who strongly opposed scholasticism and made his\nmark as one of the most influential advocates of humanistic learning\nin the early sixteenth century. His works are not limited to education\nbut deal with a wide range of subjects including philosophy,\npsychology, politics, social reform and religion. Vives was not a\nsystematic writer, which makes it difficult to classify him as a\nphilosopher. His thought is eclectic and pragmatic, as well as\nhistorical, in its orientation. He took what he considered most valid\nfrom a variety of sources and combined these elements into a\nChristianized Aristotelianism.\n",
