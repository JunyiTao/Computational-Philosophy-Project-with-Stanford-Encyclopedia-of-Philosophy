    "main_text": "The History of the Hole Argument || Einstein Falls into the Hole\u2026\n8.1 Einstein Falls into the Hole\u2026\n\nThe hole argument was created by Albert Einstein late in 1913 as an\nact of desperation when his quest for his general theory of relativity\nhad encountered what appeared to be insuperable obstacles. Over the\nprevious year, he had been determined to find a gravitation theory\nthat was generally covariant in the sense introduced above. He had\neven considered essentially the celebrated generally covariant\nequations he would settle upon in November 1915 and which now appear\nin all the textbooks.\n\nUnfortunately, Einstein had at least initially been unable to see that\nthese equations were admissible. Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation\nworked virtually perfectly for weak gravitational fields. So it was\nessential that Einstein\u2019s theory revert to Newton\u2019s in\nthat case. But try as he might, Einstein could not see that his\nequations and many variants of them could properly mesh with\nNewton\u2019s theory. In mid 1913 he published a compromise: a sketch\nof a relativistic theory of gravitation that was not generally\ncovariant. (For further details of these struggles, see Norton\n(1984).)\n\nHis failure to find an admissible generally covariant theory troubled\nEinstein greatly. Later in 1913 he sought to transform his failure\ninto a victory of sorts: he thought he could show that no generally\ncovariant theory at all is admissible. Any such theory would violate\nwhat he called the Law of Causality\u2014we would now call it\ndeterminism. He sought to demonstrate this remarkable claim with the\nhole argument.\n\nIn its original incarnation, Einstein considered a spacetime filled\nwith matter excepting one region, the hole, which was matter-free. (So\nin this original form, the term \u201chole\u201d makes more sense\nthan in the modern version.) He then asked if a full specification of\nboth metric and material fields outside the hole would fix the metric\nfield within. Since he had tacitly eschewed Leibniz Equivalence,\nEinstein thought that the resulting negative answer sufficient to damn\nall generally covariant theories.\n",
