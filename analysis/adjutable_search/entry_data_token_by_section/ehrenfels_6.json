    "main_text": "Cosmology\n7. Legacy\nInevitably, what comes to mind first and foremost when speaking of\nEhrenfels\u2019 legacy, is the idea of Gestalt. Whatever the\ninspiration by Mach or parallel developments in Husserl, it was\nEhrenfels\u2019 seminal paper \u201c\u00dcber\nGestaltqualit\u00e4ten\u201d that gave rise to\nthe ensuing debates in the school of Brentano and beyond. As Smith\n(1988, 12) observes: \u201cThe importance of Ehrenfels\u2019 paper\nrests on the fact that it contains the first concentrated reflections\non the question \u2018what complex perceived formations such as\nspatial figures or melodies might be\u2019.\u201d Ehrenfels\u2019\noriginal proposal of\n\u201cGestaltqualit\u00e4ten\u201d still\nleft many issues open or unclear, which were soon taken up in various\nways by his fellow Brentanians. Despite opposition against his\nterminological choice and the development of alternative terminologies,\nsuch as Meinong\u2019s \u201cfounded contents\u201d (1891, 253) and\nHusserl\u2019s \u201cfigural moments\u201d (1891, 236 n. 1) or\n\u201cmoments of unity\u201d (1901, 230), Ehrenfels\u2019 article\nfixed the terminology and many of the conceptual categories. At\nvariance with Brentano\u2019s other pupils, Ehrenfels did not manage\nto establish a school or movement of his own, although he was the first\nteacher of Max Wertheimer in Prague. While Ehrenfels\u2019 work\nsketched the larger picture and provided a general framework to\napproach Gestalt phenomena, many of the details were worked\nout subsequently by the Graz and Berlin schools of Gestalt\npsychology, formed by the students of Stumpf (Max Wertheimer, Kurt\nKoffka and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler) and Meinong (Stephan Witasek and\nVittorio Benussi). Systematically, the schools differ mainly in their\nviews on how Gestalt qualities originate. Contra Ehrenfels,\nthe Graz school argued that Gestalten are actively produced by\nour intellect on the basis of the Gestalt switch phenomenon\n(see, among others, Smith 1994, 259 ff.).\nHowever, the results that may be regarded as Ehrenfels\u2019 most original and\ninfluential contributions, both the original article on\nGestalt as well as his engagement with value theory, were\nmostly products of his early career (compare PSII, 21 ff.). The\nendeavors Ehrenfels passionately pursued later on, even though\npartially related to and building on his earlier work, ended for the\nmost part in failure. His proposals for sexual and social reforms fell\nflat, the idea of establishing a new religion went nowhere, and the\ndiscovery of the one and only law of primes turned out to be a very\nminor accomplishment (cf. PSII, 53).\nThe notion of Gestalt, to the contrary, obtained great\ninfluence also beyond the school of Brentano and its offspring (compare\nZimmer in Albertazzi et al. 2001, 141 ff.). In particular, the idea of\nGestalt switch and a holistic interpretation of higher-order\nphenomena in various contexts, has served as a metaphor and inspiration\nfor (among others) the idea of incommensurability of scientific theories in\nThomas Kuhn and the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle,\nparticularly Rudolf Carnap\u2019s holism, which in turn influenced\nW. V. O. Quine\u2019s. While increasingly removed from its original\nformulation, the historical starting point for it all is\nEhrenfels\u2019 article on Gestalt qualities.\n",
