    "preamble": "\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of mathematics is its\napplicability to empirical science. Every branch of science draws upon\nlarge and often diverse portions of mathematics, from the use of\nHilbert spaces in quantum mechanics to the use of differential\ngeometry in general relativity. It\u2019s not just the physical\nsciences that avail themselves of the services of mathematics either.\nBiology, for instance, makes extensive use of difference equations and\nstatistics. The roles mathematics plays in these theories is also\nvaried. Not only does mathematics help with empirical predictions, it\nallows elegant and economical statement of many theories. Indeed, so\nimportant is the language of mathematics to science, that it is hard\nto imagine how theories such as quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity could even be stated without employing a substantial amount\nof mathematics. \n\nFrom the rather remarkable but seemingly uncontroversial fact that\nmathematics is indispensable to science, some philosophers have drawn\nserious metaphysical conclusions. In particular, Quine (1976; 1980a;\n1980b; 1981a; 1981c) and Putnam (1979a; 1979b) have argued that the\nindispensability of mathematics to empirical science gives us good\nreason to believe in the existence of mathematical entities. According\nto this line of argument, reference to (or quantification over)\nmathematical entities such as sets, numbers, functions and such is\nindispensable to our best scientific theories, and so we ought to be\ncommitted to the existence of these mathematical entities. To do\notherwise is to be guilty of what Putnam has called\n\u201cintellectual dishonesty\u201d (Putnam 1979b, p. 347).\nMoreover, mathematical entities are seen to be on an epistemic par\nwith the other theoretical entities of science, since belief in the\nexistence of the former is justified by the same evidence that\nconfirms the theory as a whole (and hence belief in the latter). This\nargument is known as the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for\nmathematical realism. There are other indispensability arguments, but\nthis one is by far the most influential, and so in what follows,\nwe\u2019ll mostly focus on it. \n\nIn general, an indispensability argument is an argument that purports\nto establish the truth of some claim based on the indispensability of\nthe claim in question for certain purposes (to be specified by the\nparticular argument). For example, if explanation is\nspecified as the purpose, then we have an explanatory indispensability\nargument. Thus we see that inference to the best explanation is a\nspecial case of an indispensability argument. See the introduction of\nField (1989, pp. 14\u201320) for a nice discussion of\nindispensability arguments and inference to the best explanation. See\nalso Maddy (1992) and Resnik (1995a) for variations on the\nQuine-Putnam version of the argument. We should add that although the\nversion of the argument presented here is generally attributed to\nQuine and Putnam, it differs in a number of ways from the arguments\nadvanced by either Quine or\n Putnam.[1]\n\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Spelling Out the Quine-Putnam Indispensability Argument\n\nThe Quine-Putnam indispensability argument has attracted a great deal\nof attention, in part because many see it as the best argument for\nmathematical realism (or platonism). Thus anti-realists about\nmathematical entities (or nominalists) need to identify where the\nQuine-Putnam argument goes wrong. Many platonists, on the other hand,\nrely very heavily on this argument to justify their belief in\nmathematical entities. The argument places nominalists who wish to be\nrealist about other theoretical entities of science (quarks,\nelectrons, black holes and such) in a particularly difficult position.\nFor typically they accept something quite like the Quine-Putnam\n argument[2])\n as justification for realism about quarks and black holes. (This is\nwhat Quine (1980b, p. 45) calls holding a \u201cdouble\nstandard\u201d with regard to ontology.) \n\nFor future reference, we\u2019ll state the Quine-Putnam\nindispensability argument in the following explicit form:\n\n(P1)\n We ought to have ontological commitment to all and only the entities\nthat are indispensable to our best scientific theories.\n\n\n(P2) Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific\ntheories.\n\n(C) We ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical\nentities.\n\n\nThus formulated, the argument is valid. This forces the focus onto the\ntwo premises. In particular, a couple of important questions naturally\narise. The first concerns how we are to understand the claim that\nmathematics is indispensable. We address this in the next section. The\nsecond question concerns the first premise. It is nowhere near as\nself-evident as the second and it clearly needs some defense.\nWe\u2019ll discuss its defense in the following section. We\u2019ll\nthen present some of the more important objections to the argument,\nbefore considering the Quine-Putnam argument\u2019s role in the\nlarger scheme of things \u2014 where it stands in relation to other\ninfluential arguments for and against mathematical realism. \n2. What is it to be Indispensable?\n\nThe question of how we should understand\n\u2018indispensability\u2019 in the present context is crucial to\nthe Quine-Putnam argument, and yet it has received surprisingly little\nattention. Quine actually speaks in terms of the entities quantified\nover in the canonical form of our best scientific theories rather than\nindispensability. Still, the debate continues in terms of\nindispensability, so we would be well served to clarify this term.\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that \u2018dispensability\u2019 is not\nthe same as \u2018eliminability\u2019. If this were not so,\nevery entity would be dispensable (due to a theorem of\n Craig).[3]\n What we require for an entity to be \u2018dispensable\u2019 is for\nit to be eliminable and that the theory resulting from the\nentity\u2019s elimination be an attractive theory. (Perhaps, even\nstronger, we require that the resulting theory be more\nattractive than the original.) We will need to spell out what counts\nas an attractive theory but for this we can appeal to the standard\ndesiderata for good scientific theories: empirical success;\nunificatory power; simplicity; explanatory power; fertility and so on.\nOf course there will be debate over what desiderata are appropriate\nand over their relative weightings, but such issues need to be\naddressed and resolved independently of issues of indispensability.\n(See Burgess (1983) and Colyvan (1999) for more on these issues.)\n\nThese issues naturally prompt the question of how much\nmathematics is indispensable (and hence how much mathematics carries\nontological commitment). It seems that the indispensability argument\nonly justifies belief in enough mathematics to serve the needs of\nscience. Thus we find Putnam speaking of \u201cthe set theoretic\n\u2018needs\u2019 of physics\u201d (Putnam 1979b, p. 346) and Quine\nclaiming that the higher reaches of set theory are \u201cmathematical\nrecreation ... without ontological rights\u201d (Quine 1986, p. 400)\nsince they do not find physical applications. One could take a less\nrestrictive line and claim that the higher reaches of set theory,\nalthough without physical applications, do carry ontological\ncommitment by virtue of the fact that they have applications in\nother parts of mathematics. So long as the chain of applications\neventually \u201cbottoms out\u201d in physical science, we could\nrightfully claim that the whole chain carries ontological commitment.\nQuine himself justifies some transfinite set theory along these lines\n(Quine 1984, p. 788), but he sees no reason to go beyond the\nconstructible sets (Quine 1986, p. 400). His reasons for this\nrestriction, however, have little to do with the indispensability\nargument and so supporters of this argument need not side with Quine\non this issue.\n3. Naturalism and Holism\n\nAlthough both premises of the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument\nhave been questioned, it\u2019s the first premise that is most\nobviously in need of support. This support comes from the doctrines of\nnaturalism and holism. \n\nFollowing Quine, naturalism is usually taken to be the philosophical\ndoctrine that there is no first philosophy and that the philosophical\nenterprise is continuous with the scientific enterprise (Quine 1981b).\nBy this Quine means that philosophy is neither prior to nor privileged\nover science. What is more, science, thus construed (i.e. with\nphilosophy as a continuous part) is taken to be the complete story of\nthe world. This doctrine arises out of a deep respect for scientific\nmethodology and an acknowledgment of the undeniable success of this\nmethodology as a way of answering fundamental questions about all\nnature of things. As Quine suggests, its source lies in\n\u201cunregenerate realism, the robust state of mind of the natural\nscientist who has never felt any qualms beyond the negotiable\nuncertainties internal to science\u201d (Quine 1981b, p. 72). For the\nmetaphysician this means looking to our best scientific theories to\ndetermine what exists, or, perhaps more accurately, what we ought to\nbelieve to exist. In short, naturalism rules out unscientific ways of\ndetermining what exists. For example, naturalism rules out believing\nin the transmigration of souls for mystical reasons. Naturalism would\nnot, however, rule out the transmigration of souls if our best\nscientific theories were to require the truth of this\n doctrine.[4]\n\n\nNaturalism, then, gives us a reason for believing in the entities in\nour best scientific theories and no other entities. Depending on\nexactly how you conceive of naturalism, it may or may not tell you\nwhether to believe in all the entities of your best\nscientific theories. We take it that naturalism does give us\nsome reason to believe in all such entities, but that this is\ndefeasible. This is where holism comes to the fore: in particular,\nconfirmational holism.\n\nConfirmational holism is the view that theories are confirmed or\ndisconfirmed as wholes (Quine 1980b, p. 41). So, if a theory is\nconfirmed by empirical findings, the whole theory is\nconfirmed. In particular, whatever mathematics is made use of in the\ntheory is also confirmed (Quine 1976, pp. 120\u2013122). Furthermore,\nit is the same evidence that is appealed to in justifying belief in\nthe mathematical components of the theory that is appealed to in\njustifying the empirical portion of the theory (if indeed the\nempirical can be separated from the mathematical at all). Naturalism\nand holism taken together then justify\n P1.\n Roughly, naturalism gives us the \u201conly\u201d and holism gives\nus the \u201call\u201d in P1.\n\nIt is worth noting that in Quine\u2019s writings there are at least\ntwo holist themes. The first is the confirmational holism discussed\nabove (often called the Quine-Duhem thesis). The other is semantic\nholism which is the view that the unit of meaning is not the single\nsentence, but systems of sentences (and in some extreme cases the\nwhole of language). This latter holism is closely related to\nQuine\u2019s well-known denial of the analytic-synthetic distinction\n(Quine 1980b) and his equally famous indeterminacy of translation\nthesis (Quine 1960). Although for Quine, semantic holism and\nconfirmational holism are closely related, there is good reason to\ndistinguish them, since the former is generally thought to be highly\ncontroversial while the latter is considered relatively\nuncontroversial.\n\nWhy this is important to the present debate is that Quine explicitly\ninvokes the controversial semantic holism in support of the\nindispensability argument (Quine 1980b, pp. 45\u201346). Most\ncommentators, however, are of the view that only confirmational holism\nis required to make the indispensability argument fly (see, for\nexample, Colyvan (1998a); Field (1989, pp. 14\u201320); Hellman\n(1999); Resnik (1995a; 1997); Maddy (1992)) and my presentation here\nfollows that accepted wisdom. It should be kept in mind, however, that\nwhile the argument, thus construed, is Quinean in flavor it is not,\nstrictly speaking, Quine\u2019s argument.\n4. Objections\n\nThere have been many objections to the indispensability argument,\nincluding Charles Parsons\u2019 (1980) concern that the obviousness\nof basic mathematical statements is left unaccounted for by the\nQuinean picture and Philip Kitcher\u2019s (1984, pp. 104\u2013105)\nworry that the indispensability argument doesn\u2019t explain\nwhy mathematics is indispensable to science. The objections\nthat have received the most attention, however, are those due to\nHartry Field, Penelope Maddy and Elliott Sober. In particular,\nField\u2019s nominalisation program has dominated recent discussions\nof the ontology of mathematics. \n\nField (2016) presents a case for denying the second premise of the\nQuine-Putnam argument. That is, he suggests that despite appearances\nmathematics is not indispensable to science. There are two parts to\nField\u2019s project. The first is to argue that mathematical\ntheories don\u2019t have to be true to be useful in applications,\nthey need merely to be conservative. (This is, roughly, that\nif a mathematical theory is added to a nominalist scientific theory,\nno nominalist consequences follow that wouldn\u2019t follow from the\nnominalist scientific theory alone.) This explains why mathematics\ncan be used in science but it does not explain why it\nis used. The latter is due to the fact that mathematics makes\ncalculation and statement of various theories much simpler. Thus, for\nField, the utility of mathematics is merely pragmatic \u2014\nmathematics is not indispensable after all.\n\nThe second part of Field\u2019s program is to demonstrate that our\nbest scientific theories can be suitably nominalised. That is, he\nattempts to show that we could do without quantification over\nmathematical entities and that what we would be left with would be\nreasonably attractive theories. To this end he is content to\nnominalise a large fragment of Newtonian gravitational theory.\nAlthough this is a far cry from showing that all our current\nbest scientific theories can be nominalised, it is certainly not\ntrivial. The hope is that once one sees how the elimination of\nreference to mathematical entities can be achieved for a typical\nphysical theory, it will seem plausible that the project could be\ncompleted for the rest of\n science.[5]\n\n\nThere has been a great deal of debate over the likelihood of the\nsuccess of Field\u2019s program but few have doubted its\nsignificance. Recently, however, Penelope Maddy, has pointed out that\nif\n P1\n is false, Field\u2019s project may turn out to be irrelevant to the\nrealism/anti-realism debate in mathematics.\n\nMaddy presents some serious objections to the first premise of the\nindispensability argument (Maddy 1992; 1995; 1997). In particular, she\nsuggests that we ought not have ontological commitment to all\nthe entities indispensable to our best scientific theories. Her\nobjections draw attention to problems of reconciling naturalism with\nconfirmational holism. In particular, she points out how a holistic\nview of scientific theories has problems explaining the legitimacy of\ncertain aspects of scientific and mathematical practices. Practices\nwhich, presumably, ought to be legitimate given the high regard for\nscientific practice that naturalism recommends. It is important to\nappreciate that her objections, for the most part, are concerned with\nmethodological consequences of accepting the Quinean doctrines of\nnaturalism and holism \u2014 the doctrines used to support the first\npremise. The first premise is thus called into question by undermining\nits support.\n\nMaddy\u2019s first objection to the indispensability argument is that\nthe actual attitudes of working scientists towards the components of\nwell-confirmed theories vary from belief, through tolerance, to\noutright rejection (Maddy 1992, p. 280). The point is that naturalism\ncounsels us to respect the methods of working scientists, and yet\nholism is apparently telling us that working scientists ought not have\nsuch differential support to the entities in their theories. Maddy\nsuggests that we should side with naturalism and not holism here. Thus\nwe should endorse the attitudes of working scientists who apparently\ndo not believe in all the entities posited by our best\ntheories. We should thus reject\n P1.\n\nThe next problem follows from the first. Once one rejects the picture\nof scientific theories as homogeneous units, the question arises\nwhether the mathematical portions of theories fall within the true\nelements of the confirmed theories or within the idealized elements.\nMaddy suggests the latter. Her reason for this is that scientists\nthemselves do not seem to take the indispensable application of a\nmathematical theory to be an indication of the truth of the\nmathematics in question. For example, the false assumption that water\nis infinitely deep is often invoked in the analysis of water waves, or\nthe assumption that matter is continuous is commonly made in fluid\ndynamics (Maddy 1992, pp. 281\u2013282). Such cases indicate that\nscientists will invoke whatever mathematics is required to get the job\ndone, without regard to the truth of the mathematical theory in\nquestion (Maddy 1995, p. 255). Again it seems that confirmational\nholism is in conflict with actual scientific practice, and hence with\nnaturalism. And again Maddy sides with naturalism. (See also Parsons\n(1983) for some related worries about Quinean holism.) The point here\nis that if naturalism counsels us to side with the attitudes of\nworking scientists on such matters, then it seems that we ought not\ntake the indispensability of some mathematical theory in a physical\napplication as an indication of the truth of the mathematical theory.\nFurthermore, since we have no reason to believe that the mathematical\ntheory in question is true, we have no reason to believe that the\nentities posited by the (mathematical) theory are real. So once again\nwe ought to reject\n P1.\n\nMaddy\u2019s third objection is that it is hard to make sense of what\nworking mathematicians are doing when they try to settle independent\nquestions. These are questions, that are independent of the standard\naxioms of set theory \u2014 the ZFC\n axioms.[6]\n In order to settle some of these questions, new axiom candidates have\nbeen proposed to supplement ZFC, and arguments have been advanced in\nsupport of these candidates. The problem is that the arguments\nadvanced seem to have nothing to do with applications in physical\nscience: they are typically intra-mathematical arguments. According to\nindispensability theory, however, the new axioms should be assessed on\nhow well they cohere with our current best scientific theories. That\nis, set theorists should be assessing the new axiom candidates with\none eye on the latest developments in physics. Given that set\ntheorists do not do this, confirmational holism again seems to be\nadvocating a revision of standard mathematical practice, and this too,\nclaims Maddy, is at odds with naturalism (Maddy 1992, pp.\n286\u2013289).\n\nAlthough Maddy does not formulate this objection in a way that\ndirectly conflicts with\n P1\n it certainly illustrates a tension between naturalism and\nconfirmational\n holism.[7]\n And since both these are required to support P1, the objection\nindirectly casts doubt on P1. Maddy, however, endorses naturalism and\nso takes the objection to demonstrate that confirmational holism is\nfalse. We\u2019ll leave the discussion of the impact the rejection of\nconfirmational holism would have on the indispensability argument\nuntil after we outline Sober\u2019s objection, because Sober arrives\nat much the same conclusion.\n\nElliott Sober\u2019s objection is closely related to Maddy\u2019s\nsecond and third objections. Sober (1993) takes issue with the claim\nthat mathematical theories share the empirical support accrued by our\nbest scientific theories. In essence, he argues that mathematical\ntheories are not being tested in the same way as the clearly empirical\ntheories of science. He points out that hypotheses are confirmed\nrelative to competing hypotheses. Thus if mathematics is confirmed\nalong with our best empirical hypotheses (as indispensability theory\nclaims), there must be mathematics-free competitors. But Sober points\nout that all scientific theories employ a common mathematical\ncore. Thus, since there are no competing hypotheses, it is a mistake\nto think that mathematics receives confirmational support from\nempirical evidence in the way other scientific hypotheses do.\n\nThis in itself does not constitute an objection to\n P1\n of the indispensability argument, as Sober is quick to point out\n(Sober 1993, p. 53), although it does constitute an objection to\nQuine\u2019s overall view that mathematics is part of empirical\nscience. As with Maddy\u2019s third objection, it gives us some cause\nto reject confirmational holism. The impact of these objections on P1\ndepends on how crucial you think confirmational holism is to that\npremise. Certainly much of the intuitive appeal of P1 is eroded if\nconfirmational holism is rejected. In any case, to subscribe to the\nconclusion of the indispensability argument in the face of\nSober\u2019s or Maddy\u2019s objections is to hold the position that\nit\u2019s permissible at least to have ontological commitment to\nentities that receive no empirical support. This, if not outright\nuntenable, is certainly not in the spirit of the original Quine-Putnam\nargument.\n5. Explanatory Versions of the Argument\n\nThe arguments against holism from Maddy and Sober resulted in a\nreevaluation of the indispensability argument. If, contra Quine,\nscientists do not accept all the entities of our best scientific\ntheories, where does this leave us? We need criteria for when to treat\nposits realistically. Here is where the debate over the\nindispensability argument took an interesting turn. Scientific\nrealists, at least, accept those posits of our best scientific\ntheories that contribute to scientific explanations. According to this\nline of thought, we ought to believe in electrons, say, not because\nthey are indispensable to our best scientific theories but because\nthey are indispensable in a very specific way: they are\nexplanatorily indispensable. If mathematics could be shown to\ncontribute to scientific explanations in this way, mathematical\nrealism would again be on par with scientific realism. Indeed, this is\nthe focus of most of the contemporary discussion on the\nindispensability argument. The central question is: does mathematics\ncontribute to scientific explanations and if so, does it do it in the\nright kind of way.\n\nOne example of how mathematics might be thought to be explanatory is\nfound in the periodic cicada case (Yoshimura 1997 and Baker 2005).\nNorth American Magicicadas are found to have life cycles of 13 or 17\nyears. It is proposed by some biologists that there is an evolutionary\nadvantage in having such prime-numbered life cycles. Prime-numbered\nlife cycles mean that the Magicicadas avoid competition, potential\npredators, and hybridisation. The idea is quite simple: because prime\nnumbers have no non-trivial factors, there are very few other life\ncycles that can be synchronised with a prime-numbered life cycle. The\nMagicicadas thus have an effective avoidance strategy that, under\ncertain conditions, will be selected for. While the explanation being\nadvanced involves biology (e.g. evolutionary theory, theories of\ncompetition and predation), a crucial part of the explanation comes\nfrom number theory, namely, the fundamental fact about prime numbers.\nBaker (2005) argues that this is a genuinely mathematical explanation\nof a biological fact. There are other examples of alleged mathematical\nexplanations in the literature but this remains the most widely\ndiscussed and is something of a poster child for mathematical\nexplanation.\n\nQuestions about this case focus on whether the mathematics is really\ncontributing to the explanation (or whether it is merely standing in\nfor the biological facts and it is these that really do the\nexplaining), whether the alleged explanation is an explanation at all,\nand whether the mathematics in question is involved in the explanation\nin the right kind of way. Finally, it is worth mentioning that\nalthough the recent interest in mathematical explanation arose out of\ndebates over the indispensability argument, the status of mathematical\nexplanations in the empirical sciences has also attracted interest in\nits own right. Moreover, such explanations (sometimes called\n\u201cextra-mathematical explanations\u201d) lead one very naturally\nto think about explanations of mathematical facts by appeal to further\nmathematical facts (sometimes called \u201cintra-mathematical\nexplanation\u201d). These two kinds of mathematical explanation are\nrelated, of course. If, for example, some theorem of mathematics has\nits explanation rest in an explanatory proof, then any applications of\nthat theorem in the empirical realm would give rise to a prima facie\ncase that the full explanation of the empirical phenomenon in question\ninvolves the intra-mathematical explanation of the theorem. For these\nand other reasons, both kinds of mathematical explanation have\nattracted a great deal of interest from philosophers of mathematics\nand philosophers of science in recent years.\n6. Conclusion\n\nIt is not clear how damaging the above criticisms are to the\nindispensability argument and whether the explanatory version of the\nargument survives. Indeed, the debate is very much alive, with many\nrecent articles devoted to the topic. (See bibliography notes below.)\nClosely related to this debate is the question of whether there are\nany other decent arguments for platonism. If, as some believe, the\nindispensability argument is the only argument for platonism\nworthy of consideration, then if it fails, platonism in the philosophy\nof mathematics seems bankrupt. Of relevance then is the status of\nother arguments for and against mathematical realism. In any case, it\nis worth noting that the indispensability argument is one of a small\nnumber of arguments that have dominated discussions of the ontology of\nmathematics. It is therefore important that this argument not be\nviewed in isolation. \n\nThe two most important arguments against mathematical realism\nare the epistemological problem for platonism \u2014 how do we come\nby knowledge of causally inert mathematical entities? (Benacerraf\n1983b) \u2014 and the indeterminacy problem for the reduction of\nnumbers to sets \u2014 if numbers are sets, which sets are they\n(Benacerraf 1983a)? Apart from the indispensability argument, the\nother major argument for mathematical realism appeals to a\ndesire for a uniform semantics for all discourse:\nmathematical and non-mathematical alike (Benacerraf 1983b).\nMathematical realism, of course, meets this challenge easily, since it\nexplains the truth of mathematical statements in exactly the same way\nas in other\n domains.[8]\n It is not so clear, however, how nominalism can provide a uniform\nsemantics.\n\nFinally, it is worth stressing that even if the indispensability\nargument is the only good argument for platonism, the failure\nof this argument does not necessarily authorize nominalism, for the\nlatter too may be without support. It does seem fair to say, however,\nthat if the objections to the indispensability argument are sustained\nthen one of the most important arguments for platonism is undermined.\nThis would leave platonism on rather shaky ground.\n",

Colyvan (2001) presents a\nsustained defence of the argument. </p>\n<p>\nSee Chihara (1973), and Field (1989; 2016) for attacks on the second\npremise and Colyvan (1999; 2001), Lyon and Colyvan (2008), Maddy\n(1990), Malament (1982), Resnik (1985), Shapiro (1983) and Urquhart\n(1990) for criticisms of Field\u2019s program. See the preface to the\nsecond edition of Field 2016 for a good retrospective on these\ndebates. For a fairly comprehensive look at nominalist strategies in\nthe philosophy of mathematics (including an excellent discussion of\nField\u2019s program), see Burgess and Rosen (1997), while Feferman\n(1993) questions the amount of mathematics required for empirical\nscience. See Azzouni (1997; 2004; 2012), Balaguer (1996b; 1998), Bueno\n(2012), Leng (2002; 2010; 2012), Liggins (2012), Maddy (1992; 1995;\n1997), Melia (2000; 2002), Peressini (1997), Pincock (2004), Sober\n(1993), Vineberg (1996) and Yablo (1998; 2005; 2012) for attacks on\nthe first premise. Baker (2001; 2005; 2012), Bangu (2012), Colyvan\n(1998a; 2001; 2002; 2007; 2010; 2012), Hellman (1999) and Resnik\n(1995a; 1997) reply to some of these objections.</p>\n<p>\nFor variants of the Quinean indispensability argument see Maddy (1992)\nand Resnik (1995a).</p>\n<p>\nThere has been a great deal of recent literature on the explanatory\nversion of the indispensability argument. Early presentations of such\nan argument can be found in Colyvan (1998b; 2002), and most explicitly\nin Baker (2005), although this work was anticipated by Steiner (1978a;\n1978b) on mathematical explanation and Smart on geometric explanation\n(1990). Some of the key articles on the explanatory version of the\nargument include Baker (2005; 2009; 2012; 2017; 2021), Bangu (2008;\n2013), Baron (2014), Batterman (2010), Bueno and French (2012),\nColyvan (2002; 2010; 2012; 2018), Lyon (2012), Rizza (2011), Saatsi\n(2011; 2016) and Yablo (2012).</p>\n<p>\nArising out of this debate over the role of mathematical explanation\nin indispensability arguments, has been a renewed interest in\nmathematical explanation for its own sake. This includes work on\nreconciling mathematical explanations in science with other forms of\nscientific explanation as well as investigating explanation within\nmathematics itself. Some of this work includes: Baron (2016), Baron et\nal. (2017; 2020), Colyvan et al.
