    "main_text": "Obligations in the Law\n1. Obligations in the Law\n\nEvery legal system contains obligation-imposing laws, but there is no\ndecisive linguistic marker determining which these are. The term\n\u201cobligation\u201d need not be used, nor its near-synonym,\n\u201cduty\u201d. One rarely finds the imperative mood. The Canadian\nCriminal Code imposes an obligation not to advocate genocide thus:\n\n\nEvery one who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding\nfive years.\n\n\nThe English Sale of Goods Act says that,\n\n\nWhere the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an\nimplied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of\nmerchantable quality.\n\n\nThat these laws create obligations follows from the way\n\u201coffence\u201d and \u201cimplied condition\u201d function in\ntheir respective areas of law, not from the language in which they are\nexpressed.\n\nOn the face of it, some laws have other functions. A requirement that\n\u201ca will must be signed\u201d generally imposes no\nduty\u2014not a duty to make a will, and not even a duty to have it\nsigned if you do\u2014it sets conditions in the absence of which the\ndocument simply does not count as a valid will. Nonetheless, some\nphilosophers argue that the content of every legal system can and\nshould be represented solely in terms of duty-imposing and\nduty-excepting laws (Bentham Of Laws in General; Kelsen 1960\n[1967]). Bentham asks,\n\n\nWhat is it that every article of law has in common with the rest? It\ncommands and by doing so creates duties or, what is another\nword for the same thing, obligations. (Bentham, Of Laws\nin General [1970: 294])\n\n\n(For a related contemporary view, see Harris 1979: 84\u2013106.) They\nthink that analysing laws this way reveals what legislators or\nsubjects most need to know: under what conditions the coercive power\nof law will ultimately be met. Others argue that even if such a\nreduction were possible, it would be unwieldy, uninformative and\nunmotivated, concealing as it does the different social functions that\nlaws fulfil (Hart 1961 [1994: 26\u201349]) and the different kinds of\nreasons for action that they create (Raz 1975 [1990]). Others still,\ndespairing of any principled way of knowing what a law is, have\nabandoned the problem entirely and tried to develop a theory of law\nthat bypasses it (Honor\u00e9 1977; Dworkin 1978: 71\u201378). At a\nminimum, it does seem clear that whether or not all laws impose\nobligations, they can only be fully understood through their\nrelations to those that do. Thus, a legal right is an interest that\nwarrants holding others under an obligation to protect it, a legal\npower is the ability to create or modify obligations, and so\nforth.\n\nWhat then are legal obligations? They are legal requirements with\nwhich law\u2019s subjects are bound to conform. An\nobligatory act or omission is something the law renders non-optional.\nSince people plainly can violate their legal obligations,\n\u201cnon-optional\u201d does not mean that they are physically\ncompelled to perform, nor even that law leaves them without any\neligible alternative. On the contrary, people often calculate whether\nor not to perform their legal duties. Could it be then that\nobligations are simply weighty reasons to perform, even if sometimes\nneglected or outweighed? This cannot be a sufficient condition: high\ncourts have important reasons not to reverse themselves too\nfrequently, but no legal obligation to refrain. Nor is it necessary:\none has an obligation, but only a trivial reason, not to tread on\nsomeone\u2019s lawn without his consent.\n\nIf their content does not account for the stringency of obligations,\nwhat does? An historically important, though now largely defunct,\ntheory explained it in terms of penalty. According to this view, to\nhave a legal obligation is to be subject to a sovereign command to do\nor forbear, where a command requires an expression of will together\nwith an attached risk, however small, of suffering an evil for\nnon-compliance. As the English jurist John Austin puts it,\n\n\n[w]hen I am talking directly of the chance of incurring the\nevil, or (changing the expression) of the liability or obnoxiousness\nto the evil, I employ the term duty, or the term\nobligation\u2026. (Austin 1832 [1995: 18]; see also Bentham\nOf Laws in General; Hobbes 1651 [1968])\n\n\nOthers conceived an indirect connection between duty and sanction,\nholding that what is normally counted as the content of a legal duty\nis in reality only part of a triggering condition for the mandatory\nnorm which commands or authorizes officials to impose a sanction.\nAccording to this view,\n\n\na norm: \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d is superfluous, if a norm\nis valid: \u201cHe who murders ought to be punished\u201d. (Kelsen\n1960 [1967: 55])\n\n\nThus,\n\n\n[l]egal obligation is not, or not immediately, the behavior that ought\nto be. Only the coercive act, functioning as a sanction, ought to be.\n(Kelsen 1960 [1967: 119])\n\n\nNone of these versions of the sanction theory survived H.L.A.\nHart\u2019s criticisms (Hart 1961 [1994: 27\u201342]; cf. Hacker\n1973; but see Schauer 2015 for a recent reformulation of this\napproach). First, they misleadingly represent a range of disparate\nlegal consequences\u2014including compensation and even\ninvalidation\u2014as if they all function as penalties. Second, they\nrender unintelligible many familiar references to duties in the\nabsence of sanctions, for example, the duty of the highest courts to\napply the law. Third, they offer an inadequate explanation of\nnon-optionality. \u201cYou have an obligation not to murder\u201d\ncannot merely mean \u201cIf you murder you will be punished\u201d,\nfor the law is not indifferent between people, on the one hand,\nmurdering and being jailed, and on the other hand not murdering at\nall. \u201cThe right to disobey the law is not obtainable by the\npayment of a penalty or a licence fee\u201d (Francome v. Mirror\nGroup Newspapers Ltd. [1984] 2 All ER 408 at 412). Such dicta are\ncommonplace and reflect familiar judicial attitudes. Most important,\nthe normal function of sanctions in the law is to reinforce duties,\nnot to constitute them. It is true that one reason people are\ninterested in knowing their legal duties is to avoid sanctions, but\nthis is not the only reason nor is it, contrary to what Oliver Wendell\nHolmes supposed, a theoretically primary one (Holmes 1897). Subjects\nalso want to be guided by their duties\u2014whether in order\nto fulfil them or deliberately to infringe them\u2014and officials\ninvoke them as reasons for, and not merely consequences of,\ntheir decisions.\n\nSensitivity to such matters led Hart to defend a rule-based\ntheory. He says that while sanctions might mark circumstances in which\npeople are obliged to conform, they have an\nobligation only when subject to a practised social rule requiring\nan act or omission. The fact that subjects use it as a rule marks it\nas normative. Three further features distinguish obligation-imposing\nrules: they must be reinforced by serious or insistent pressure to\nconform; they must be believed important to social life or to some\nvalued aspect of it; and their requirements may conflict with the\ninterests and goals of the subject (Hart 1961 [1994: 85\u201388]).\nThis account of the nature of obligations is not an account\nof their validity. Hart does not say that a legal duty is\nbinding whenever there is a willingness to deploy serious pressure in\nits support, etc. He holds that a duty is legally valid if it is part\nof the legal system (i.e., if it is certified as such by the tests for\nlaw in that system), and a legal duty is morally valid only if there\nare sound moral reasons to comply with it. But, at least in his early\nwork, he offers the practice theory as an explanation of duties\ngenerally\u2014legal duties are the creatures of legal rules, moral\nduties of moral rules and so on. (Hart later modified this view, see\n1982: 255\u2013268; and 1961 [1994: 256].)\n\nThe constitutive role of social pressure is sometimes considered an\nAustinian blemish on Hart\u2019s theory, but there are in any case\nmore serious problems with it as a general account of obligations\n(Dworkin 1978: 50\u201354; Raz 1975 [1990: 53\u201358]). People\nreadily speak of obligations when they are well aware that there are\nno relevant social practices, as might a lone vegetarian in a meat\neating society. And Hart\u2019s practice conditions may be satisfied\nin cases where there is no obligation but only generally applicable\nreasons, as when victims are regularly urged to yield their wallets to\na mugger. At best, Hart\u2019s theory will apply only to a special\nclass of obligations in which the existence of a conventional practice\nis an essential part of the reasons for conformity, though even here,\nthe theory is open to doubt (see Dworkin 1978: 54\u201358; Green\n1988: 88\u2013121; cf. Marmor 2011: ch. 3). More recently, some have\nobjected that Hart\u2019s attempt to reduce social rules to social\npractices fails because rules and practices belong to different\nmetaphysical categories. If so, grounding one in the other is a\ncategory mistake. Instead, we should think of the rules of our legal\nsystem as grounded in the planning activities of various officials\nwhose intent is to regulate the behaviour of individuals (as well as\nother bodies) operating within the legal system (Shapiro 2011).\n\nA third account is reason-based. On this view, what\nconstitutes obligations is neither the social resources with which\nthey are enforced, nor the practices in which they may be expressed,\nbut the kind of reasons for action that they offer. Legal obligations\nare content-independent reasons that are both categorical and\npre-emptive in force. The mark of their content-independence is that\ntheir force does not depend on the nature or merits of the action they\nrequire: in most cases, law can impose an obligation to do X\nor to refrain from doing X (Hart 1958; 1982: 254\u201355;\nbut cf. Markwick 2000; Sciaraffa 2009; Valentini 2018). That they are\npre-emptive means that they require the subject to set aside his own\nview of the merits and comply nonetheless. That they are categorical\nmeans that they do not condition their claims on the subject\u2019s\nown goals or interests.\n\nThis view is foreshadowed both in Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, but\nits most influential contemporary version is due to Joseph Raz (1975\n[1990: 35\u201384]). Raz argues that obligations are categorical\nreasons for action that are \u201cprotected\u201d insofar as they\nare combined with special second-order reasons that require\nus to exclude from our deliberation some of the competing first\norder reasons for action. \u201cFirst-order reasons\u201d are\nnormal reasons for action grounded in self-interest, desires or\nmorality; \u201csecond-order reasons\u201d are reasons that we have\nto act (or refrain from acting) on first-order reasons. Thus, the\ndistinctive feature of obligations, according to Raz, is that they\nexclude some contrary reasons\u2014typically at least\nreasons of convenience and ordinary preference\u2014from our\npractical deliberation. Some but not all. An \u201cexclusionary\nreason\u201d is not necessarily a conclusive reason. The stringency\nof an obligation is thus a consequence not of its weight or practice\nfeatures, but of the fact that it supports the required action by\nspecial normative means, insulating it from the general competition of\nreasons. Or at any rate this is what obligations do when they have the\nforce they claim, i.e., when they are binding. The theory does not\nassume that all legal obligations actually are binding from the moral\npoint of view, but it does suppose that the legal system puts them\nforth as if they were\u2014a consequence that some have doubted (Hart\n1982: 263\u2013267; Himma 2001: 284\u2013297). And while this\naccount is invulnerable to the objections to sanction-based and\npractice-based theories, it does need to make good the general idea of\nan \u201cexclusionary reason\u201d, and some philosophers have\nexpressed doubts on that score also.\n\nSome have criticized the very existence of reasons to act for (or\nagainst) other reasons by pointing out that acting for (or against)\nother reasons is not something we can choose to do (Whiting 2017;\nAdams 2021). Others have pointed out that the reasons provided by\nauthoritative directives are best understood as reasons that causally\nconstrain our capacity not to conform with the directives in question\n(Shapiro 2002). Others have argued that what Raz calls exclusionary\nreasons are ultimately simply reasons that outweigh competing reasons\n(Mian 2002), reasons that affect the weight of first order reasons\n(Perry 1989) or reasons that causally change the factual circumstances\nin a way that triggers pre-existing reasons (Enoch 2011 and 2014).\nFinally, others have accepted that exclusionary reasons exist, while\nrejecting the claim that it is ever reasonable to exclude\nentirely from consideration otherwise valid reasons (Regan\n1987; Gur 2007). This has led to formulation of alternative models,\naccording to which obligations are best understood as providing\n\u201cpresumptive reasons\u201d, as opposed to exclusionary reasons\nfor action (Schauer 1991; Renzo 2019). According to these models,\ncompeting reasons for action are not excluded altogether from the\ndeliberation of the agent. Rather, the second-order reasons created by\nthe obligation merely create a presumption in favour of their\nexclusion. Subject to certain epistemic conditions being met, the\npresumption can be rebutted (but see Venezia 2020).\n",
