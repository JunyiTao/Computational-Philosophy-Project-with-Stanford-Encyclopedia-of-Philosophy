    "preamble": "\n\nBonaventure of Bagnoregio (b. ca. 1221, d. 15 July 1274) was a\nFranciscan, a master of philosophy and theology at the University of\nParis, Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor (O.F.M.), a\nBishop and Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. During his lifetime\nhe rose to become one of the most prominent men in Latin Christianity.\nBonaventure\u2019s known works all derive from his career as a\nstudent and master of theology at the University of Paris and from his\ncareer as Minister General. Throughout his corpus, Bonaventure\nwitnesses to his philosophical training and makes philosophical claims\nthat influenced later thinkers. He is perhaps best known today for\nThe Journey of the Mind into God, a philosophical,\ntheological, and spiritual classic.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nBonaventure was born in Civita di Bagnoregio in central Italy, an\nancient city perched atop a constantly eroding volcanic butte. Though\nDante placed Bonaventure among the saints in his Paradiso\n(Canto 12), and reports of Bonaventure\u2019s holiness circulated in\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, no official cult emerged\nafter his death and the papacy did not recognize him as a saint until\n1482 (on Bonaventure\u2019s canonization see Finucane 2011:\n33\u201370). Had Bonaventure been canonized earlier, there might be\nmore information about his life to sift, as there is in the case of\nhis contemporary, Thomas Aquinas. What we can know about\nBonaventure\u2019s early life comes from his own hagiographical work\non St. Francis of Assisi, the Legenda major and\nminor, where he attests to being healed miraculously by St.\nFrancis:\n\n\nwhen I was a boy, as I still vividly remember, I was snatched from the\njaws of death by his invocation and merits. (Legenda maior,\nprol. 3, [FA:ED: Volume 2, 528]; cf. Legenda minor, lec. 8.\nTexts of Bonaventure will be quoted in the Quaracchi edition,\n1882\u20131902, unless a more recent edition\n exists[1])\n\n\nOne certain date, Bonaventure\u2019s election as Minister General of\nthe Franciscans on 2 February 1257, permits a broad division of his\nlife into two clear periods: an academic and a pastoral\n period.[2]\n The academic period runs from c. 1235\u20131257. During those years,\nBonaventure studied and taught philosophy and theology at the\nUniversity of Paris and acquired the degree of Master in both\ndisciplines. The pastoral period runs from 1257\u20131274. During\nthat time, Bonaventure served as Minister General, relinquishing the\noffice on 19 May 1274 when Jerome of Ascoli was elected to replace\nhim. On 28 May 1273 Bonaventure became a Cardinal and was later\nconsecrated bishop of Albano (11 November 1273). Bonaventure died at\nthe second council of Lyon, 15 July 1274.\n\nA fuller chronology of Bonaventure\u2019s academic period can emerge\nfrom sifting through various chronicles and from utilizing the data of\nscholars\u2019 evolving knowledge of the medieval University of Paris\nand its degree programs. The general consensus remains that\nBonaventure left Bagnoregio for Paris in 1235 and studied philosophy\nuntil 1243. A student\u2019s guidebook from the faculty of arts at\nParis (c. 1240) provides a glimpse of Bonaventure\u2019s training,\nwhile his own works display his mastery of this discipline (anonymous,\nLe \u201cguide de l\u2019\u00e9tudiant\u201d).\nBonaventure clearly knew and utilized the emerging corpus of Aristotle\nand his Arabic commentators. The Parisian program in arts favored\nlogic and Bonaventure mastered and utilized this art, displaying his\nmastery in discussion of metaphysical and theological issues. A text\nlike Peter of Spain\u2019s Summaries of Logic\n(13th century) displays the kind of logical training\nBonaventure probably received. Notably, scholars have not yet\nidentified any works from Bonaventure\u2019s period as a student or\nmaster of philosophy at Paris.\n\nBy 1244 Bonaventure had completed his degree in philosophy and was a\nprofessed Franciscan friar. Bonaventure\u2019s Letter to an\nUnknown Master (commonly dated to the mid 1250s) gives some\ninsight into why he chose the Franciscans and displays his attitude to\nphilosophy at this\n time.[3]\n In one important passage of the Letter he writes:\n\n\nAnd so, if the writings of the philosophers are sometimes of much\nvalue in understanding truth and refuting errors, we are not departing\nfrom the purity of faith if we at times study them, especially since\nthere are many questions of faith which cannot be settled without\nrecourse to them. (trans. Monti 1994: 53)\n\n\nBonaventure\u2019s corpus shows that while he could be deeply\ncritical of positions he identified as philosophical errors\n(especially in his last work, the Collationes in\nHexa\u00ebmeron), he consistently utilized philosophy and\nphilosophical authors in his theological and spiritual writings.\n\nFrom 1243 to 1248, Bonaventure studied theology at Paris, surely\nworking closely with the Franciscan masters of this period: Alexander\nof Hales (d. 1245), John of La Rochelle (d. 1245), Eudes Rigaud\n(master c. 1245\u20131248), and then William of Middleton (master c.\n1248\u20131254). At this point, Salimbene provides another important\ndate but one that requires some interpretation. Writing about 1280,\nSalimbene states:\n\n\nBr. John of Parma [Franciscan Minister General] gave the license to\nBr. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio to read at Paris, which he had never yet\ndone because he was not yet installed in a Chair. He then read the\nwhole Gospel of St. Luke, a commentary that is very beautiful and\ncomplete. This was in 1248. (Salimbene, Cronica\n[Hodder-Egger: 209] and Hammond\n 2009)[4]\n\n\nSalimbene\u2019s report cannot mean that John of Parma gave\nBonaventure a license in theology from the University of Paris, since\nJohn had no authority to confer this degree. The license John granted\nBonaventure must therefore have been internal to the Order. Perhaps\nJohn made Bonaventure a lector or granted him what scholars have\ncalled the Franciscan\u2019s second, internal chair at\n Paris.[5]\n In any case, the usual interpretation is that Bonaventure lectured on\nthe Bible cursorie as a \u201cBachelor of the Bible\u201d,\nbetween 1248 and 1250/51. Then, from c. 1252\u201353 he commented on\nthe Sentences, likely lecturing on the whole of the\nSentences in one year, in the typical order\n I\u2013IV\u2013II\u2013III.[6]\n Once Master, he revised the Commentary (Commentaria in\nQuattuor Libros Sententiarum), his major philosophical and\ntheological work. In 1253 he was a \u201cformed Bachelor\u201d of\nTheology, performing the three duties of a Master: lecturing on the\nBible, engaging in disputations, and preaching. In 1253 the Masters\nand students of the University of Paris went on strike, all but the\nfriars. The two Dominican masters and the Franciscan William of\nMiddleton continued to teach and refused to take an oath of loyalty to\nthe University. They were expelled from the \u201cuniversity of\nmasters\u201d, an action defended by the University in a letter of 4\nFebruary (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis I, no. 230:\n252\u20138, trans. Thorndike\n 56\u201364).[7]\n Bonaventure received the licentia docendi by Easter 1254, in\nthe midst of this conflict. He assumed the Franciscan Chair in\ntheology immediately, but taught only at the Franciscan convent,\nunrecognized by the University.\n\nBonaventure performed all three tasks of a Master of Theology from\n1254\u201357. He revised his commentary on Luke and composed\ncommentaries on John and Ecclesiastes. He also held three sets of\ndisputed questions. The questions On the Knowledge of Christ\n(De scientia Christi), which develop his illumination theory\nof knowledge, may come from 1254. The questions, On the Mystery of\nthe Trinity (De mysterio Trinitatis), which elaborated\nhis view of God, certainly followed On the knowledge of\nChrist, since they cite this disputation. Bonaventure also\ndisputed a third set of questions On Evangelical Perfection\n(De perfectione evangelica). These questions defended the\nfriars\u2019 way of life from the attacks of non-mendicant Masters\nled by William of St. Amour in 1255 (Bougerol 1982; Traver 1995 and\n1999). In October 1256, Pope Alexander IV ordered the secular Masters\nat Paris to accept Bonaventure and the Dominican Thomas Aquinas in\ntheir rightful places as Masters of Theology, but it was not until 12\nAugust 1257 that they did so. Six months earlier Bonaventure had been\nappointed Minister\n General.[8]\n In addition to the normal writings pertaining to his tasks as a\nMaster of Theology, Bonaventure produced numerous sermons during this\nperiod. One text, related to the genre of sermons and known as On\nRetracing the Arts to Theology (Opusculum de reductione\nartium ad theologiam) may have originated as the second half of\nBonaventure\u2019s inaugural sermon as a Master of Theology (Benson\n2012). In 1257, while leaving the University and beginning his tenure\nas Minister General, Bonaventure also managed to compose his\nBreviloquium, a brief and popular synthesis of theology.\n\nAs noted above, Bonaventure\u2019s \u201cpastoral period\u201d runs\nfrom 1257\u20131274. Scholars can often pinpoint Bonaventure\u2019s\nactivities at this time by utilizing his sermons and by studying\ndocuments related to the Franciscan Order (Quinn 1974; Bourgerol (ed.)\n1990). Bonaventure traveled extensively to visit Franciscan houses but\nmaintained Paris as his chief residence (Monti 2014). During this\nperiod, Bonaventure\u2019s writings reflected the needs of the Order,\nbut he did not cast aside his Parisian philosophical and theological\ntraining. Bonaventure quickly set a firm direction for the Order in an\n\u201cencyclical letter\u201d to all the friars on 23 April 1257,\nwhich admonished them to recover the \u201csomewhat tarnished\u201d\nluster of the Order (Monti 1994). Amid his other duties, Bonaventure\ncomposed three extremely popular tracts between 1257 and 1260 for the\nspiritual training of the friars: A Soliloquy about Four Mental\nExercises (Soliloquium de quatuor mentalibus\nexercitiis), The Tree of Life (Lignum vitae),\nand The Triple Way (De triplici via) (Coughlin 2006;\nCousins\n 1978).[9]\n\nBonaventure\u2019s most popular work today was also composed at this\ntime. For Francis\u2019s feast day in October, 1259, Bonaventure\nvisited Mt. Alverna, the very place where Francis himself had received\na mystical vision of Christ \u201cunder the appearance\u201d of\n\u201ca Seraph having six wings\u201d and had \u201cimprinted in\nhis flesh\u201d the stigmata or wounds of Christ (Legenda\nmaior 13.3 [FA:ED: Volume 2, 632\u2013633]). Here Bonaventure\nconceived the idea for his Journey of the Mind to God\n(Itinerarium mentis in Deum), a mental and spiritual journey\nto God whose basic outline\u2014though not its details\u2014could be\nunderstood by even the simplest friar (Armstrong 2020 is the most\nrecent English translation, offering extensive notes). The text\ndisplays Bonaventure\u2019s philosophical and theological training in\nthe service of articulating how to contemplate God. The journey\nfollows the route first charted by St. Augustine\u2014from the\nexterior world to the interior mind, and from the interior but\ninferior human mind to the superior mind, namely, to God. Bonaventure\nunderstood the six wings of the angelic Seraph Francis saw to stand\nfor six ways God can be approached. Among other things, the series of\nsix chapters also stood for Bonaventure as the six days of creation.\nHe therefore arranged his Journey into six chapters of mental\nwork followed by a seventh chapter on mystical rest. The two lower\nwings of the Seraph symbolize seeing God through \u201cfootprints\n(vestigia)\u201d, signs in the sub-human world that point to\nGod, including signs in the physical universe itself (c. 1) and signs\nfound in the sensory life humans have in common with other animals (c.\n2). The two middle wings of the Seraph symbolize seeing God in his\n\u201cimage\u201d, namely, in humans understood as bearing within\ntheir intellectual nature special signs pointing to God. Here\nBonaventure distinguished signs of God found in the\n\u201cnatural\u201d exercise of the mind in theoretical knowledge\n(c. 3) from those found in its exercise in the practical sphere\n\u201creformed by grace\u201d (c. 4). The two highest wings of the\nSeraph symbolize seeing the light of God, first in the way reason sees\nGod as having one divine nature (c. 5) and then as faith sees God in\nthe Trinity of persons (c. 6). These three sets of twin\n\u201csteps\u201d culminate in the \u201cmental and mystical\ntransport\u201d found in mystical experience (c. 7), the end of the\nJourney. For each step, Bonaventure used material from\nearlier writings; but the Journey, like all his later works,\nis a synthesis the Minister General never had the leisure to expand.\nIn the Journey, he achieves a combination of scriptural\nimagery, philosophic depth, mystical yearning, and a density more\nmeditative than demonstrative, as befitting the genre of the text. The\nJourney, nevertheless, provides an appropriate outline for\nlooking at Bonaventure\u2019s philosophy which will be pursued\nbelow.\n\nThe General Chapter of 1260 held in Narbonne, France, the first where\nBonaventure presided, ratified his codification of the legal statutes\nunder which Franciscans lived, known as the \u201cConstitutions of\nNarbonne\u201d and also asked him to write a definitive Life of\nSt. Francis, which he did in 1261. These two works set the Order\non a moderate course that lasted for centuries and led Franciscans to\nrevere Bonaventure as their \u201csecond founder\u201d.\n\nFor most of the period from 1257 through 1266 Bonaventure trekked\nthrough France and Italy by foot, as did all friars when they\ntraveled. In 1266 he returned to Paris, where his friars were under\nattack both from conservatives in the Theology faculty and from\nradicals in Arts. Bonaventure began giving a series of collations\n(sermons offered in the morning and evening) which he considered a\nsequence: Collations on the Ten Commandments (Collationes\nde decem praeceptis), Lent of 1267; Collations on the Seven\nGifts of the Holy Spirit (Collationes de septem donis\nSpiritus sancti), Lent of 1268; and Collations on the\nHexa\u00ebmeron (Collationes in Hexa\u00ebmeron) during\nEaster-tide of 1273, a series that was never finished and is often\nregarded as a masterpiece of medieval theology. Though the issues\ncovered in these collations range across nearly the whole of Christian\ntheology, they have come to be understood as Bonaventure at his most\npolemical, since in them he attacks the three philosophical errors\nthat he believes are the most dangerous: the eternity of the world,\nthe necessity of fate, and that there is one intellect for all human\nbeings (On these collations see Ratzinger 1959 [1971] and\n 2009).[10]\n Bonaventure thought all three of these errors undermined Christian\nfaith, the last of the three impacting the doctrineof salvation\n itself.[11]\n Notably, the series of collations are close in time to 10 December\n1270, when certain Aristotelian positions were condemned by the Bishop\nof Paris, \u00c9tienne Tempier.\n\nIn addition to these important collations, in 1269 Bonaventure again\ndefended mendicant life from the critiques of secular clergy in his\nApologia pauperum (Defense of the Mendicants). The\nlast period of Bonaventure\u2019s life saw him rise to become one of\nthe most prominent men in Christendom. During the three-year Papal\nvacancy, from 29 November 1268 to 1 September 1271, Bonaventure\npreached an important sermon in Viterbo and was perhaps instrumental\nin ending the vacancy. He is said to have been offered the papacy by\nthe electors and to have suggested Teobaldi Visconti instead. After\nTeobaldi\u2019s election as Pope Gregory X, he appointed Bonaventure\ncardinal on 28 May 1273 (Franchi, 1981); Bartholomew of Pisa, the\nearliest source for Bonaventure suggesting Teobaldo\u2019s name,\nwrote ca. 1385.). At the Second Council of Lyon, Bonaventure labored\nfor the reunification of eastern and western Churches, a major goal of\nthe Council which seemed to have been achieved when he suddenly fell\nill on 15 July 1274. The acts of the council then report:\n\n\nat the hour of Matins died Br. Bonaventure of happy memory, Bishop of\nAlbano, who was a man eminent for his knowledge and eloquence\n(homo eminentis scientie et eloquentie), a man outstanding\nfor his sanctity and acknowledged for the excellence of his life, both\nreligious and moral \u2026 Br. Peter of Tarantasia [also a Cardinal]\ncelebrated the funeral mass and preached on the theme \u201cI am\nsaddened over you, my brother Jonathan\u201d. There were many tears\nand much weeping, for the Lord had given him such grace that the\nhearts of all who saw him were seized with a desire for his love.\n(Franchi 1965: 95; in Bougerol, 1988: 11)\n\n2. Philosophy, Faith, and Theology \n\nWithout exception, every word of philosophy Bonaventure ever wrote is\ncontained in works explicitly religious\u2014in sermons, works of\nspiritual direction, and theology. He never wrote the kind of\nintroductions to the principles of metaphysics and natural philosophy\nthat Thomas Aquinas composed in his On Being and Essence\n(De ente et essentia) and On the Principles of\nNature (De principiis naturae), nor have any\ncommentaries on Aristotle\u2019s works under his name been\nidentified. Scholars writing during the twentieth century\nNeo-Thomistic revival compared Bonaventure with three other thinkers:\nAristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. P. Mandonnet thought he had no\nphilosophy of his own, but was an Augustinian theologian, pure and\nsimple, all of whose conclusions depend on faith. E. Gilson thought\nBonaventure developed an Augustinian philosophy within his\ntheology:\n\n\nwith St. Bonaventure the mystical synthesis of mediaeval\nAugustinianism was fully formed, just as that of Christian\nAristotelianism was fully formed with St. Thomas. (Gilson 1924 [1938:\n490]).\n\n\nF. Van Steenberghen thought his philosophy a failed Aristotelianism\nseparate from but at the service of his Augustinian\n theology.[12]\n None of these interpretations quite captures Bonaventure\u2019s\nrelation to these three philosophers or his own approach to the\nrelations among reason, faith, and theology, because they implicitly\nemployed a Thomistic model for being an Aristotelian, with the result\nthat Bonaventure\u2019s failures derive from his not being the kind\nof Aristotelian Thomas Aquinas was.\n\nBonaventure\u2019s approach to Aristotle was quite different from\nAlbert and Thomas. He felt no need for detailed knowledge of the text\nof Aristotle. As a student in Arts he had learned from his Masters,\nnot from detailed study of Aristotle\u2019s text, broadly\nAristotelian philosophical principles\u2014the categories and\ntranscendentals, the causes and predicables, and fundamental notions\nlike potency and act, possible and necessary\u2014sufficient to do\nhis own work. As a philosopher and theologian, he was perfectly\ncapable of using such borrowed principles to draw his own conclusions,\nones which he himself said depended more on Alexander of Hales than on\nany philosopher:\n\n\nFor I do not intend to advocate new opinions, but to reweave the\ncommon and approved ones (\u201cPraelocutio,\u201d Quaracchi II: 1a, trans.\nauthors).\n\n\nConsequently, Bonaventure was not a failed Aristotelian for the simple\nreason that he never tried to be an Aristotelian in the Dominican way\nat all. On the other hand, while Augustine was clearly\nBonaventure\u2019s favorite theological authority, he was not,\nproperly speaking, an Augustinian. Even when he draws Augustinian\nconclusions, Bonaventure does not employ Augustinian arguments. In\ntruth, Bonaventure was, broadly speaking, an Aristotelian in his\nphilosophical principles, but not in his conclusions. A better way to\ndescribe his philosophical conclusions and his way of drawing them is\nthat his thought was Franciscan in inspiration and Bonaventurean in\nexecution.\n\nThe pressing issue concerning philosophy, faith, and theology in the\n1250s was how to set up theology as an Aristotelian demonstrative\nscience. Albert had done so in his commentary on the\nSentences (1243\u20139), which Bonaventure had on hand when\nwriting his own commentary. Demonstration is causal knowledge, and a\nscience in Aristotle\u2019s sense is systematic knowledge of one\nlimited subject developed through demonstrating necessary conclusions\nby making use of certain fundamental causal principles relevant to the\nsubject at hand. The task theology had set itself, then, was to\ndiscover and present systematically the truths set out in that most\nunsystematic of books\u2014the Bible.\n\nSince a \u201cscience\u201d is causal knowledge, Bonaventure devoted\nthe four questions of the prologue to his commentary on Book 1 of the\nSentences, which serves as his introduction the whole\n\u201cscience\u201d of theology, to its four causes\u2014efficient,\nfinal, formal, and material. These causes in turn clarify the\nrelations between philosophy, faith, and theology.\n\nSince science exists as an intellectual habit in the mind of the\nknower, the efficient cause of any book of theology is the\nauthor who wrote it, Peter Lombard in the case of his\nSentences, Bonaventure himself in the case of his commentary.\nLombard was no mere scribe, compiler, or commentator; he was an\n\u201cauthor\u201d, and the same is true of Bonaventure himself.\nThis simple point distinguishes faith, whose sole efficient cause is\nGod working through grace, from both philosophy and theology, whose\nefficient cause is the human mind, though even here God has a role to\nplay.\n\nWhen he came to clarify the end of theology, Bonaventure\nunderstood that Aristotle had sharply distinguished practical\nscience\u2014whose end is deeds\u2014from theoretical\nscience\u2014whose end is knowledge. So he asks whether theology is\n\u201cfor the sake of contemplation or for the sake of our becoming\ngood\u201d. The answer is that theology is more perfect than any\nphilosophical science because it breaks through the bounds of this\nAristotelian dichotomy. Neither theoretical knowledge nor practical\ndeeds get to the center of the moral life, which is love\u2014both\nthe \u201caffection\u201d of love and the theological virtue of\ncharity. The kind of intellectual virtue that prepares the mind for\ncharity is a \u201cwisdom\u201d that \u201cinvolves knowledge and\naffection together\u201d. The \u201cknowledge that Christ died for\nus\u201d, for example, is far different from the knowledge of the\ngeometer or the knowledge of the general. Consequently, theological\nwisdom is both\n\n\nfor the sake of contemplation and also for our becoming good, but\nprincipally for the sake of our becoming good (Quaracchi III: 13b;\ntrans. Houser and Noone 2013: 12)\n\n\nthrough enlivening our knowledge and deeds with Christian\n\u201caffection\u201d.\n\nThe form that produces \u201cscience\u201d is its\n\u201cmethod of proceeding\u201d. Now\n\n\nthe end imposes necessity on the means, since \u201cteeth are sharp\nin order to cut\u201d, as Aristotle says.\n\n\nSince theology is \u201cdesigned to promote the faith\u201d, it\nemploys \u201cthe method of argumentation or inquiry\u201d first\ndeveloped by Aristotle. By adapting the philosophical method to the\ndata of faith, theology attempts to \u201cconfound the adversaries of\nthe faith\u201d, \u201cstrengthen those weak in their faith\u201d,\nand \u201cdelight those whose faith is complete\u201d. Bonaventure\nsituated theology within the hierarchy of the sciences by adverting to\nAristotle\u2019s notion of \u201csubalternated sciences\u201d. The\nPhilosopher had recognized that optics\u2014which studies visible\nlines\u2014is a science \u201csubalternated\u201d to\ngeometry\u2014which studies lines as such. Theology depends upon\nScripture in a similar way, for scripture offers certain truths to be\nbelieved, but theology looks at the same truths \u201cas made\nintelligible\u201d. In this way, theology is different from the faith\nit tries to understand and from the Scripture that offers faith to us\n(In I Sent. prol. q. 1 ad 5m; 2c [Quaracchi I: 8b]; trans.\nHouser and Noone 2013, 5).\n\nTo understand theology as a \u201cscience\u201d making faith\nintelligible, Bonaventure must clarify its material cause.\nDetermining that material cause of theology is the same as\nsettling on its subject. On this point, there had been\nconsiderable dispute among the Masters. Aristotle\u2019s\n\u201csciences\u201d were all limited to a particular genus, such as\n\u201canimal\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cmemory\u201d or\n\u201cethics\u201d. Even his universal science of metaphysics was\nlimited to studying substances; it eschewed the other categories.\nTheology, by contrast, cuts across all genera and includes God, who is\nnot confined within any genus. Bonaventure was familiar with many\naccounts of the subject of theology: \u201cthings and signs\u201d,\nthe work of \u201creparation for sin\u201d, \u201cChrist\u2014head\nand members\u201d, \u201cGod\u201d, and \u201cthe object of\nbelief\u201d (credibile). To throw light on these\nconflicting answers, Bonaventure turned to his study of the Arts.\nPriscian had noted three different senses of the subject of grammar.\nIts subject in the sense of its \u201croot principle\u201d is the\n\u201cletter\u201d that makes up words; its subject conceived as an\n\u201cintegral whole\u201d is \u201ca fitting and complete\noration;\u201d and its subject conceived as \u201cuniversal\nwhole\u201d is \u201cmeaningful sound, articulated and\nordered\u201d. There are three correlative senses of the subject of\ntheology: \u201cGod\u201d is the \u201cprinciple\u201d of the\nsubject and \u201cChrist\u2014head and members\u201d is the\n\u201cintegral whole\u201d, the entirety of what theology studies.\nBut the most important sense of \u201csubject\u201d is the\n\u201cuniversal whole\u201d. Therefore, \u201cthe subject of this\nbook, properly speaking\u201d, is the \u201cobject of belief\u201d,\na subject that lets theology range over all realities and all thoughts\nabout which one can have religious faith. (Quaracchi I: 6\u20138; trans.\nHouser and Noone 2013, 1\u20136).\n\nBonaventure does not explicitly address the principles of theology.\nBut he further clarifies its \u201csubject\u201d in a way that\npoints to those principles. To faith, Scripture adds the notion of\n\u201cauthority\u201d, and to the faith and authority of Scriptural\nrevelation, theology adds \u201cproof\u201d. Theology presupposes\nfaith but adds to it rational demonstrations about matters of faith.\nConsequently, Bonaventure adds a telling qualification to his\ndescription of the subject of theology. Theology\u2019s subject is\nthe object of belief\n\n\nin so far as the object of belief passes over into\nintelligibility by the addition of reasoning.\n\nprout tamen credibile transit in rationem intelligibilis, et hoc\nper additionem rationis.\n\n(In I Sent. prol., q. 1 conclusio [Quaracchi I: 7b]; trans.\nHouser and Noone 2013, 4)\n\n\nWith this concise formula, Bonaventure includes within theology both\nreligious belief transformed by arguments from natural reason and\nnatural reason transformed by arguments based on religious revelation.\nIf so, then theology must have the kinds of principles that make\npossible both kinds of arguments: the fundamental truths of faith\ndrawn from the Bible and tradition, but also fundamental truths of\nreason. What makes all such basic truths theological is their\nargumentative function. Theological arguments may draw from revelation\nby using revealed truths as premises and they may draw from reason by\nusing rational truths as premises. Both kinds of arguments are\ntheological because of the use to which they are put. In this way,\nphilosophical reasoning has an integral place within the\ndomain of Bonaventurean theology.\n\nBonaventure showed how philosophical reasoning works in theology in\nthe very structure of his disputed question On the Mystery of the\nTrinity. Each question is divided into two articles, the first\nproven using rational premises and the second proven using premises\ndrawn from faith. In Question 1, for example, God is rationally proven\nto exist in Art. 1, then shown to be a trinity of persons using\narguments based on faith and reason in Art. 2. Theology, then,\nconsists most fundamentally in the understanding that results from\njoining rational arguments and faith-based arguments\n together.[13]\n The same mode of reasoning is found in On Retracing the Arts to\nTheology. Here \u201creduction\u201d consists in developing\nanalogies that move the mind from the liberal arts to theology and\nback again. Bonaventure argues for each point by combining one claim\nbased on reason with another based on revelation, as though they were\nwall and buttress of the cathedral of theology. Philosophical\nreasoning, then, is an absolutely integral part of Bonaventure\u2019s\nfaith-based theology.\n3. Physical Creation\n\nIn the first step of the Journey Bonaventure focuses upon the\nsensible objects of the physical world around us, both taken in\nthemselves and in reference to our sense awareness of them. Like all\ncreatures, sensible things are understood to be signs that ultimately\ncan direct humans to the divine art or wisdom through which all things\nhave been made. Bonaventure\u2019s semiotics distinguishes four sorts\nof signs. All creatures can be seen as \u201cshadows\u201d\n(umbra) and \u201cvestiges\u201d (lit. footprints,\nvestigia):\n\n\nFor a creature is called a shadow based on its properties which point\nto God in some type of causality in an indeterminate way. But a\ncreature is called a vestige based on properties which point to God as\ntriple cause\u2014efficient, formal, and final cause; for example,\nthe properties: one, true, and good. (In I Sent. d. 3, pars\n1, q. 2, ad 4 [Quaracchi I: 73b], trans. Houser and Noone, 77\u201378)\n\n\nIn addition, Bonaventure posits two higher types of semiosis pertinent\nsolely to rational creatures, which are \u201cimages\u201d\n(imago) pointing to the First Principle through its properly\nrational powers which have their source and highest object in God and\n\u201clikenesses\u201d (similitudo) of God to the extent\nthat they are recipients of divine grace and conform themselves to the\ndivine will. All creatures, from rocks to angels, are signs in the\nsense of shadows and traces of God, for they all bear a relation of\ncausal dependency upon God as their source; but only rational\ncreatures can have the divine as an object of their activities and,\nfor that reason, can conform themselves to the divine will and become\nlikenesses of God.\n3.1 The Physical World\n\nBonaventure\u2019s understanding of the physical world is heavily\nindebted to two fundamental sources: the Biblical account of creation,\nmediated by Patristic commentaries, and the Aristotelian view of\nnature, taken chiefly from Aristotle\u2019s writings on natural\nphilosophy, such as the Physics (Physica) and On\nthe Heavens (De caelo), but combined with the\ncommentaries of Averroes, the tracts of Avicenna, and the\nTimaeus of Plato in the Latin translation of Calcidius.\nBonaventure constructs a view of the physical world that is indebted\nto both of his fundamental sources, but ultimately gives the\nScriptural text and the related Patristic tradition precedence\nwhenever his sources come into conflict. His manner of synthesizing\nthose sources into a coherent and impressive whole is what gives his\nviews on nature their distinctive character.\n3.2 Creation\n\nThe tension between the newly translated Aristotelian corpus and the\ntraditional theological teaching of the Church regarding the doctrine\nof creation was well understood by Bonaventure\u2019s time. Indeed,\nthe prohibitions of 1215 and 1231 regarding the teaching of the\nAristotelian writings on natural philosophy had given way to the\ndirect teaching of Aristotle in the Faculty of Arts by the time\nBonaventure took his master of arts degree at the University of Paris,\nand by the time he left the University, the Aristotelian corpus in its\nentirety was a subject of examination for candidates for degrees in\nthe Faculty of Arts. Yet the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of\nthe world was given various interpretations. Some favored a benign\ninterpretation, claiming that all Aristotle meant in Physics\nVIII was that the world and its motion did not arise from some earlier\nmotion, but rather time, moveable things, and motion were all coeval\nand\n concomitant.[14]\n Others, however, chief among them Robert Grosseteste, argued that the\nviews of Aristotle should be taken at face value and what the\nStagirite intended was the eternity of the past; the Greek Fathers and\nAristotle\u2019s own commentators both were in accord that the\nAristotelian outlook involved the beginninglessness of the past and\nunoriginated\n matter.[15]\n\nBonaventure\u2019s own position takes its origins from a combination\nof elements coming from Alexander of Hales and Grosseteste. Following\nthe lead of the latter, Bonaventure rejects, albeit with some\nhesitation, the benign reading of the Stagirite; in all likelihood,\nAristotle did intend to teach that the world was beginningless:\n\n\nAnd this view [i.e., that matter eternally existed under some form]\nseems more reasonable than its opposite, namely, that matter existed\neternally incomplete, bereft of form and divine influence, as some of\nthe philosophers posited. Indeed, this view seems so reasonable that\nthe most excellent of the philosophers, Aristotle, fell into this\nerror, at least as the saints impute it to him, his commentators\nexpound him, and his own words indicate. (In II Sent., lib.\nII, d. 1, pars 1, art. 1, qu. 2, resp. [Quaracchi II: 22b], trans.\n authors[16])\n\n\nYet the most striking feature of Bonaventure\u2019s account of the\nphilosophers is the manner in which he juxtaposes the doctrine of\ncreation, as he understands it, with the philosophical theory of\norigins. According to Bonaventure, only two theories regarding the\norigin of the cosmos are really tenable: first, the theory of the\npagan philosophers according to which the world is eternal and the\nmatter of the universe is without ultimate causal origin; second, the\nChristian doctrine of creation according to which the universe depends\nentirely for its being on God, is produced \u201cfrom nothing (ex\nnihilo)\u201d, and is temporally finite in the past. The third\npossibility, namely that the world is both produced from nothing and\neternal, Bonaventure vehemently rejects on the grounds that such a\nposition is inherently contradictory:\n\n\nResponse: To posit that the world is eternal or eternally produced,\nwhile positing likewise that all things have been produced from\nnothing, is altogether opposed to the truth and reason, just as the\nlast reason stated showed. Indeed, it is so opposed to reason that I\ndo not believe any philosopher, however small his intellectual\nabilities, took this position. For this involves, in itself, an\nobvious contradiction. To posit, however, that the world is eternal on\nthe supposition that matter is eternal seems reasonable and\nunderstandable\u2026. (In II Sent., d. 1, pars 1, art. 1,\nqu. 2 [Quaracchi II: 22a\u2013b], trans.\n authors[17])\n\n\nReturning to the last argument, we find the reasoning to which\nBonaventure refers. The argument is an elegant synthesis and\nrestatement of the position of Parisian theologians since the time of\nWilliam of Auxerre, but is especially indebted to the\nQuaestiones of Alexander of Hales. Everything that depends\nentirely for its being on something else is produced by that thing\nfrom nothing. The world depends entirely for its being on God. Hence,\nthe world must be produced from nothing. If the world is produced from\nnothing, it must either arise out of the \u201cnothing\u201d as out\nof matter or out of the \u201cnothing\u201d as out of a point of\norigin. The world cannot arise out of nothing as out of matter. Thus\nthe world must arise out of nothing as out of a point of origin. If,\nhowever, the world arises out of nothing as out of a point of origin,\nthen the world has being after non-being. Nothing having being after\nnon-being can be eternal. The world, as a created thing, has being\nafter non-being. Therefore, the world, precisely as created \u201cout\nof nothing\u201d, cannot be eternal (In II Sent., d. 1, pars\n1, art. 1, qu. 2 [Quaracchi II:\n 22a][18]).\n The philosophical force of the expression that there be a logical\nmoment at which we could say that the world is not and with reference\nto which the world begins to be. The ontological reference of such a\nlogical moment is the divine eternity with respect to which\n(\u201cafter\u201d which) the world begins.\n\nTo Bonaventure\u2019s mind, the creationist view of the universe\nalone accounts for the total being of the universe in the sense of\nexplaining both its structure and the fact that it exists; the view of\nthe ancients only explains the order and the pattern of the universe\nwithout reaching the depths of accounting for why the universe exists\nat all. A sign of this shortcoming is to be seen in the shared\npresupposition of Plato and Aristotle that matter is unoriginated.\nFurthermore, to the extent that the ancient pagan views of the\nuniverse involve the infinity of past time, with all the philosophical\ndifficulties that the eternity of past time entails, natural reason\nwould seem capable of arriving, in principle, at the conclusion that\nthe world was created, even though, historically speaking, the\ngreatest of the ancient philosophers failed to do so.\n3.3 Matter\n\nThe conflict between Scriptural sources and the Aristotelian writings\non the issue of the primordial state of matter is not so severe,\nbecause in the Aristotelian corpus there is no description of the\nprimordial state of matter, and the other sources available to\nBonaventure are themselves in disagreement. Augustine, for example,\nhad suggested in his literal commentary on Genesis that the matter of\nthe world could have been made all at once, whereas in his\nConfessions (Confessiones) he had suggested that\nthere might be an indeterminate and inchoate initial state of matter.\nThis possibility was further corroborated by such pagan authors as\nPlato and Ovid, who had posited a primordial chaotic state of matter\nout of which the present cosmic order gradually emerged (Plato,\nTimaeus 52D\u201353C, 54\u201355; Ovid,\nMetamorphoses, 43:5\u201345:7).\n\nBonaventure begins by distinguishing the consideration of matter from\nthe actual existence of matter in the order of natural history (In\nII Sent., d. 12, art. 1, q. 1 [Quaracchi II: 294a]). We may\nconsider matter simply as a constitutive principle of things and as\nsuch it is pure potency; this is the way that the concept of matter\nfunctions in Aristotle\u2019s Physics and, to\nBonaventure\u2019s mind, how Augustine spoke of matter in the\nConfessions. But we may also think of matter as it actually\nexists in time. In this respect, matter never exists and cannot exist\nas lacking all form. Such a claim, however, does not require that\nmaterial creation was brought forth as fully formed, even if such a\nposition might be more philosophically defensible than its opposite\n(In II Sent., d. 12, art. 1, q.2 [Quaracchi II: 296b]).\nInstead, Bonaventure suggests that physical matter was created in a\nstate wherein it had a tendency and capacity to admit many different\nforms, though it had none of them in its own right. Rather, its\npotentiality to develop distinct forms required further external,\ndivine agency in order for the distinct things having diverse forms to\nfully emerge (In II Sent., d. 12, art. 1, q.3 [Quaracchi II:\n299b\u2013300a]). Physical matter\u2019s properties in its\nincomplete state included extension and visibility (properties arising\nfrom the form common to all physical things, namely, light). These\nfeatures are still shared by all the items in the physical world, even\nthough Bonaventure admits, in accord with the Aristotelian teaching on\nthe heavens, that heavenly bodies, such as the stars, have matter that\ndiffers in kind from that of terrestrial things. Accordingly, after\nthings were fully produced matter was twofold, terrestrial and\ncelestial, but in its primordial state physical matter enjoyed a\ncorresponding unity that was one of contiguity, i.e., it was one mass\n(In II Sent., d. 12, art. 2, q.1 [Quaracchi II:\n 303a\u2013b]).[19]\n This primordial unity of physical matter continues to have some\nscientific bearing for Bonaventure since it grounds the consideration\nof the general physicist who may prescind from the process of\ngeneration and corruption and consider bodies simply in terms of their\nmobility in place and extension (In II Sent., d. 3, p. 1 art.\n1, q.2 [Quaracchi II: 97a]).\n3.4 Light\n\nBonaventure\u2019s treatment of light is mainly found in the\ndiscussion of light in his commentary on Lombard\u2019s\nSentences, Bk. 2, d. 13. In this theological context, light\nmainly bears upon the work of the six days of creation, and\nBonaventure must take a position on the Genesis account of the\ncreation of light. Though he acknowledges Augustine\u2019s\nspiritualizing interpretation of light, an interpretation that\nidentifies the light spoken of in Genesis with the creation and\nactivities of the angels, Bonaventure inclines to a more literal\ninterpretation (In II Sent. d. 13, art. 1, q. 1 [Quaracchi\nII: 312b\u2013313a]). This means that Bonaventure had to take a\nposition on the contemporary debates on light and its nature.\n\nThe two positions that Bonaventure discusses are what we may call a\nbroadly Aristotelian position, one eventually adopted by Thomas\nAquinas, and a broadly Augustinian position advocated by Robert\nGrosseteste in his On light (De luce). According to\nthe first, light is simply an accidental form, one found in degrees in\ndifferent bodies, but according to the second, light is perhaps a\nsubstance or at least a substantial form communicating extension and\nvisibility to physical things.\n\nBonaventure discounts the possibility that light is a substance,\nbecause it is purely active and if it were a substance in its own\nright it would be God and not a creature. He does allow, however, that\nlight is a substantial form and is the substantial form that is\nconcomitant with the mass of matter in its primordial state (In II\nSent. d. 13, art. 2, q. 2 [Quaracchi II: 320b\u2013321b]). In\nthis originating condition, light gave the mass of matter its\nextension and visibility and the hierarchy of heavenly bodies\ncorresponds to the hierarchy of things capable of partaking either\nmore or less in the light that renders bodies active and extended. For\nBonaventure, then, light is a substantial form, but only the partial\nperfection of any given physical substance, whether celestial or\nterrestrial. Since Bonaventure endorses, usually without any elaborate\nargumentation, the general claim that there is a plurality of\nsubstantial forms within any composite thing, his doctrine of light\nreally means that light is the first form, endowing each thing with\nextension, and preparing the way for further perfections such as the\nforms of the elements or the forms of mixtures or compounds.\n3.5 Seminal reasons\n\nThe transition in the order of natural history from bodies that are\nsimply such, extended and endowed with the ability to act and be acted\nupon, to the bodies of plants and animals is explained in part through\nthe motions of the celestial bodies and their causal influences on\nmatter. In part, however, matter itself has latent structures that\nsimply await the correct circumstances and conditions to cause the\nemergence of a higher type of body. These latent structures,\noriginally sown into matter at its creation, Bonaventure calls,\nfollowing the terminology of St. Augustine, rationes\nseminales or seminal reasons, a term hearkening back to the\ncosmology of the ancient Stoics. Seminal reasons amount to a lingering\nimpact of the creator on the matter of the physical world since their\npresence in matter originates with creation. In physical science,\nBonaventure believes seminal reasons help to explain the successive\nemergence of the different kinds of bodies suitable for higher and\nhigher types of life. But this process of gradual emergence does not\napply to the creation of human life, since human souls for Bonaventure\nare incorruptible and can only arise through the direct action of the\ncreator.\n\nThough from our post-Darwinian perspective we may be tempted to see in\nthe doctrine of seminal reasons, whether in Augustine or Bonaventure,\na curious, yet awkward anticipation of the doctrine of evolution,\nsimilarities between the doctrine of seminal reasons and certain\nelements in evolutionary theory are more apparent than real. First,\nthough seminal reasons do provide directionality and progression for\nthe succession of physical types in natural history, they are\nthemselves latent forms within matter and not reducible to more\nfundamental mechanical or chemical processes; rather, they underlie\nsuch processes. Second, seminal reasons are never appealed to in order\nto explain the demise of one living species and the emergence of\nanother species to replace the former, a key feature of Darwinian\nexplanations. Third, seminal reasons are not, as we have just seen,\nuniversal in their application to the living things that occur within\nthe order of natural history; human beings, at least in terms of their\nsouls, fall outside the range of influence of seminal reasons.\n3.6 Living Things\n\nBonaventure\u2019s doctrines regarding living things are mainly\ninspired by an Aristotelian biology. Living things are such thanks to\nthe kind of forms they have, namely, soul, which is defined as the\nfirst actuality of a body having life potentially. Soul is understood\nas the form that makes a thing alive and able to enjoy the type of\nlife that it does. Consequently, souls are termed either vegetative,\nsensitive, or rational, according to the functions that the living\nthings themselves exercise.\n3.7 Sense Cognition\n\nThe world as it is revealed to us through the senses provides the\nmeans for our re-entering ourselves and ascending to higher things.\nFurthermore, the senses themselves are equally signs of higher\nthings.\n\nPhysical things considered in their own right evidence \u201cweight,\nnumber, and measure\u201d (Psalm 83:8), thereby causing us to\ncontemplate their own measure, beauty, and order. These features are\ngrounded in the activities and natural powers of sensible substances.\nThe nature of sensible substances accordingly expresses in their\nactions and interactions the measure, beauty, and order of their\norigin and thereby attest to the power, wisdom, and goodness of the\nSource from which they spring (Journey cap. I, n. 11\n[Quaracchi V: 298b]). Likewise, the origin, size, number, beauty,\nfullness, function, and origin of physical things point to the Divine\nSource and its essential properties of power, wisdom, and goodness\n(Journey cap. I, n. 14 [Quaracchi V: 299a\u2013b]).\n\nThe pointing of physical things towards their Source finds its\nparallel in sense cognition itself, which also points towards that\nsame Source. Drawing his point of departure from the Neoplatonic theme\nof macrocosm and microcosm, Bonaventure discovers an analogy between\nAristotelian cosmology and the process of sensation. Each sensible\nobject generates a likeness of itself in the medium through which it\nis perceived, and that likeness in turn generates another likeness\nsuccessively in the sense organ, causing the sense power to apprehend\nthe sensible object. The process so described reflects the process of\nthe emanation of forms from the heavenly bodies and also the manner in\nwhich creatures, going forth from their Principle, return to their\nSource through the exercise of their natural activities. A similar\npattern emerges within the different acts exercised by each sense\npower: the sense apprehends (apprehensio) the object,\ndelights (delectatio) in its object, provided that the object\ndoes not exceed the natural limits of the organ, and judges\n(diiudicatio) or discriminates the quality of its object.\nThis last act, found in both the external senses and the internal\nsenses, takes on a special role for Bonaventure. Such a sense\njudgement, through comparative awareness, detaches the object from a\ngiven place and time, thereby preparing the way within the realm of\nsense cognition for intellectual cognition (Journey cap. II,\nn. 6 [Quaracchi V: 301a]).\n4. Intellectual Creatures\n\nWhen we arrive at the threshold of intellectual cognition, we are\nentering the next step along the Bonaventurean journey. This level of\ncreaturely being points to the Divine Source, but in ways that are\nmore direct than those in which sensible creatures do. In exercising\ntheir powers of intellect and will, intellectual creatures discover\nthe highest and most perfect object of their powers in the Divine\nSource of their being, since God is the First or Highest Truth and the\nFirst or Chief Good. Accordingly, intellectual creatures have God as\ntheir ultimate object, whereas all creatures have God as their Cause.\nConsequently, intellectual creatures show themselves to be\n\u201cimages\u201d and \u201clikenesses\u201d of God, while they\nshow that all creatures are \u201cshadows\u201d and\n\u201cvestiges\u201d of God.\n\nBonaventure traces out how intellectual creatures and intelligible\nobjects reflect the divine Source. If we begin with something as\nimmediate and basic as simple apprehension on the part of the human\nintellect, we find that an object of simple apprehension (such as the\nnatural kind \u201cdog\u201d) is susceptible of definition. Yet\nevery definition requires a genus and a differentia. Through the\ngeneric term we are led to a further object of simple apprehension,\nusually itself susceptible of definition. If the genus is definable,\nwe may state its definition, but we shall eventually find ourselves\nthrough continuing the process of definition arriving similarly at one\nof the supreme general or Aristotelian categories; if the genus is not\ndefinable, then we have arrived at one of the Aristotelian categories.\nOnce we arrive at a category, we confront an item not susceptible of\nfurther definition, though it admits of description. If the\ncategorical item is an accident, it satisfies the description of an\naccident as \u201cbeing through another;\u201d if we are dealing\nwith substance, then the item we are considering satisfies the\ndescription of substance as \u201cbeing in itself\u201d.\n\nThe resolution of all our items of simple apprehension into the\nconcept of being is metaphysically and epistemologically crucial:\nmetaphysically, it opens up a route of argumentation that leads to the\nexistence of God; epistemologically, such a resolution means that\nbehind all, even the most determinate and specific, conceptions of\nthings lies a transcendental awareness of being that informs all of\nour knowledge. If we take the concept of substance as being in itself,\nwe cannot come to know a particular substance\u2019s definition\nwithout the concept of being presupposed in the background, and in\naddition we are concomitantly aware of the transcendental properties\nof being (unity, truth, and goodness) in any such notion. Such\nco-extensive transcendental properties, however, are only one of the\ntwo types of properties that belong to being; the other transcendental\nproperties (later called disjunctive properties) prove extremely\nuseful for increasing our metaphysical knowledge. Being may be\nconceived of as either actual or potential, absolute or dependent,\nprior or posterior, immutable or mutable. Yet to conceive of being as\npotential, dependent, posterior, or mutable requires that we already\nbe acquainted with being as actual, independent, prior and immutable.\nIn other words, the more perfect of the two disjuncts in any of the\ndisjunctive transcendentals must be an item we acknowledge in our\nawareness of being:\n\n\nSince privations and defects may only be known through positive\nfeatures, our intellect does not fully resolve the understanding of\nany one created thing unless it is assisted by an understanding of the\npurest, most actual, complete, and absolute being, which is being\nsimply and eternally and in which are found all the formulas of things\nin their purity. Indeed, how can the mind know that this being is\ndefective and incomplete unless it has some awareness of being without\ndefect? And the same line of analysis pertains to the other conditions\nof being mentioned above. (Journey cap. III, n. 3 [Quaracchi\nV: 394a]; trans.\n authors)[20]\n\n\nAt one level, this line of argumentation is part of an argument for\nthe existence of God. But, at another level, it is an effort to\ndemarcate the proper object of the human mind as being and to point\nout that, if we reflect upon the notion of being (ens) in\nterms of its actuality (esse) we are inexorably led to the\nconclusion that there is a Perfect Being (Journey cap. V, n.\n3 [Quaracchi V:\n 308b\u2013309a][21]).\n We reach the same kind of conclusion if we reflect, not upon the\nprimary object of the mind, but upon its operations. The certainty of\njudgment requires that we be aware of the impossibility of our being\nmistaken combined with our awareness that the truth that we know\ncannot be otherwise; indeed, the most fundamental truths we know are\nall immutable. But, following Augustine, Bonaventure claims that there\nis no source for immutable truth other than God, since God is the only\nimmutable and unchanging Being Journey cap. III, n. 3\n[Quaracchi V:\n 304a\u2013b][22]).\n\nWhat we find when we look within ourselves is that we are pointed\nabove to God, who is the light of the mind, guaranteeing the certainty\nof our judgments. This thesis, usually called by scholars divine\nillumination, was quite ancient by Bonaventure\u2019s time; it was\npart of the philosophical teaching of Augustine. What makes\nBonaventure\u2019s version so philosophically distinctive is that he\nproposes to synthesize the epistemology of divine illumination with\nthe Aristotelian account of abstraction. Bonaventure is thoroughly\ncommitted to the integral role played by the agent and possible\nintellects in human intellectual cognition. The agent and possible\nintellects are not separated substances, in the way envisaged by\nAverroes, but properly human faculties essential to the constitution\nof the human soul (In II Sent. d. 24, pars 1, art 2, q. 4\n[Quaracchi II:\n 568b][23]).\n Hence, unlike his contemporaries, who often thought of the human\npossible intellect as being illumined by God functioning as an agent\nintellect, Bonaventure assigns each human being an agent intellect.\nDiffering from his contemporaries, Bonaventure also insists that the\npossible intellect always remains the recipient of the intelligible\nspecies abstracted by the agent intellect and the faculty of\napprehension; accordingly, the possible intellect continues to be part\nof the human soul even when the soul is separated by death from the\nbody (In II Sent. d. 24, pars 1 art. 2, q. 4 [Quaracchi II:\n569b\u2013570a]). Abstraction is, for Bonaventure, the main, though\nnot exclusive, source of our concepts of things. How then does\nillumination work and why is it necessary? The divine light works\ntogether with the human intellectual faculties as a \u201cregulative\nand moving cause\u201d, ensuring that the human mind grasps the\nimmutable truth of the creature; it does not and cannot replace the\nhuman intellectual faculties in their proper roles (De scientia\nChristi, q. 4 [Quaracchi V: 23b]). The appeal to divine\nillumination is justified, primarily if not exclusively, for the\nreason that there is an incommensurability between our intellectual\nfaculties and the ordinary objects we know as created and mutable, on\nthe one hand, and the immutable truths we come to know. Inasmuch as\nthings cannot give what they do not have, the only source of eternal\nand immutable truth is God\u2019s Light.\n\nIn general, the activities proper to intellectual creatures point much\nmore directly than merely sensible or sentient creatures to the divine\nSource. Both the objects of the understanding and the will are\nultimately rooted in God as Being and Goodness. This more direct\npointing to God on the part of the intellectual creature is also seen\nin the intellectual creature\u2019s constitution, both psychological\nand ontological. The image of God is found in the fundamental\ninterrelatedness of the memory, understanding, and will. Each act of\nmemory calls to mind the past, is aware of the present and anticipates\nthe future; each act of understanding presupposes the memory of first\nprinciples; and each act of will presupposes the act of understanding\nand moves the mind to further acts of memory. This triadic structure\nof the human mind reflects its Source: the Perfect Being that is\nsimultaneously, Highest Unity, Supreme Truth, and Ultimate Good\n(Itenerarium cap. III, n. 5\u20136 [Quaracchi V:\n305a\u2013b]). Likewise, the ontological constitution of intellectual\ncreatures, humans and angels, moves us along the road to the\nconsideration of God. Each intellectual creature is composed of act\nand potency, metaphysical principles that Bonaventure understands to\nbe co-extensive with matter and form (In II Sent. d. 3 pars\n1, art. 1, q. 2 resp. [Quaracchi II 97b]). Accordingly, even\nintellectual creatures are composed of form and matter (In II\nSent., d. 3, pars 1, art. 1, q. 1 resp. [Quaracchi II: 91a];\nIn II Sent. d. 17, art. 1, q. 2, resp. [Quaracchi II:\n414b\u2013415a]). For Bonaventure, it is the conjunction of form and\nmatter that explains the individuality of each thing (In II\nSent. d. 3, pars 1, art. 2, q. 3 resp. [Quaracchi II:\n109b\u2013110a]; on the principle of individuation in Bonaventure,\nsee King 1994). But that even the highest creatures are composed of\npotency and act in this fashion entails that they are derived from a\nSource that is not so composed, but is, instead, pure act and hence\npure form.\n5. God\n\nIn his Collations on the Hexameron Bonaventure read Genesis\nspiritually, distinguishing seven levels of \u201cvision\u201d\ncorresponding to the seven days of creation. The first level is\n\u201cunderstanding naturally given\u201d or philosophy, which he\ndivided following the Stoics into logic, ethics, and physics, the last\nfurther subdivided following Aristotle into natural philosophy,\nmathematics, and metaphysics. The focus of metaphysics is on causal\nrelations between God and creatures. Here\n\n\nthe philosophers\u2014the finest and the ancient\nphilosophers\u2014came to this conclusion: there is a beginning, and\nan end, and an exemplar cause\n\n\nof the universe (Collationes in Hexa\u00ebmeron 6.1\n[Quaracchi V: 360]; trans. authors), that is, God is the efficient,\nfinal, and formal cause of the world. Since efficient causality\nconnects metaphysics to physics and final causality connects it with\nethics, the \u201ctrue metaphysician\u201d focuses on\nexemplar causality (Collationes in Hexa\u00ebmeron\n1.13 [Quaracchi V: 331]; cf. Speer 1997: 30\u20131), a kind of formal\ncausality which is the grand theme of Bonaventurean metaphysics.\n\nTo pursue this theme, Bonaventure made use of materials drawn from\nearlier philosophers about three important points: the\ntranscendentals, the three Neoplatonic routes to God, and the\ndifference between scientific principles and conclusions. About the\ntranscendentals, Aristotle made metaphysics the science of substance.\nCenturies later, Avicenna transformed it into a science truly\nuniversal in scope by insisting that it study the nine accidents, as\nwell as substance, and also the attributes that transcend the\ncategories (Avicenna, Metaphysica, 1.5, 8). Philip the\nChancellor codified this doctrine into four\ntranscendentals\u2014being, one, true, and good (Aertsen 1996:\n25\u201370). Bonaventure opens consideration of God in his\nCommentary on the Sentences by noting that the categorical\nattributes of being are \u201cits special properties which\ncharacterize its imperfection\u201d, but the transcendentals\nare \u201cits general conditions which characterize its\nperfection\u201d (In I Sent. d. 3, pars 1, art. 1,\nq. 2 ad 1 [Quaracchi I: 72a\u2013b]; trans. Houser and Noone 2013,\n75). The transcendentals therefore set the terms for treating God.\n\nWhen he read \u201cthe books of the Platonists\u201d, Augustine\nopened up three routes to proving the existence of God, though he\nhimself explored only one. Arguments like Aristotle\u2019s that begin\nin the world must proceed from effect to cause and have been called\ncosmological arguments, though\naitiological\u2014meaning simply an argument uncovering\ncauses\u2014seems a better description. When Augustine\nturned within his mind he opened up two other routes to God. The\nsecond route also proceeds from effect to cause, but starts within the\nmind and searches out God as the ultimate cause of the mind\u2019s\nknowledge. This is the illumination argument for God.\nAugustine\u2019s turn inward also opened up a third route, later\ngiven by Kant the unhappy name of ontological argument. The\nfullest development of this neoplatonic approach to God stood ready to\nbe realized, when all three routes, the aitiological, illuminationist,\nand ontological, would be scouted out by one and the same\nphilosophical mind. That mind was not Augustine\u2019s or\nAnselm\u2019s but Bonaventure\u2019s.\n\nIf the transcendentals came primarily from Muslim Aristotelians,\nespecially Avicenna, and the three routes to God were opened by\nAugustine, the last set of materials Bonaventure used to construct his\narguments for the existence of God came from Aristotle himself.\n\u201cScience\u201d consists in knowledge of a limited subject\nachieved through demonstrating conclusions about it based on\nun-demonstrated principles. Bonaventure was one of a group of Parisian\ntheologians, including the Dominicans Albert and Thomas, who attempted\nto set up Christian theology as an Aristotelian science. He therefore\napproached the issue of the existence of God with a sharp distinction\nbetween principles and conclusions in mind. The question he asks is\nnot \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d but \u201cIs the divine being so\ntrue that it cannot be thought not to be?\u201d This Anselmian\nformulation offers two options: God\u2019s existence is either a\nprinciple or a demonstrated conclusion. Philosophers are inclined to\npick one route to God and reject all others, but Bonaventure had\nlearned from Francis, the poor man of Assisi, that the world is filled\nwith signs of God that even the simplest peasant can grasp.\nBonaventure\u2019s response to the problem of the existence of God\nwas therefore most unusual. He pursued all three routes to God; and he\neven ranked them: Illumination arguments make us \u201ccertain\u201d\nof God\u2019s existence; aitiological arguments give us \u201cmore\ncertain\u201d knowledge of God\u2019s existence; while ontological\narguments show that God\u2019s existence is\n\n\na truth that is most certain in itself, in as far as it is the\nfirst and most immediate truth. (De mysterio\ntrinitatis 1.1 concl. [Quaracchi V: 49; tr. Hayes 1979: 116])\n\n\nLet us look at each of them in turn.\n5.1 Bonaventure\u2019s Illumination Argument\n\nThe transcendental that initially opens up arguments for the existence\nof God is \u201ctruth\u201d. Bonaventure bases his illumination\nargument on the epistemological sense of truth, inspired by\nAugustine\u2019s memorable description of his own inward route to\nGod:\n\n\nAnd admonished by all this to return to myself, I entered inside\nmyself with you leading and I able to do so because you had become my\nhelper. And I entered and with the eye of my soul, such as it was, I\nsaw above that eye of my soul, above my mind, an unchangeable\nlight.\u2026Whoever knows the truth knows this\nlight\u2026. O eternal truth and true love and loved\neternity, you are my God; to you do I sigh both night and day.\n(Augustine, Confessiones, 7.10 [CCSL 27: 103])\n\n\nIn his Commentary on the Sentences, Bonaventure extracted\nfrom Augustine\u2019s stirring rhetoric the logical core of the\nillumination argument, reducing it to plain and dispassionate\nsyllogisms, as he had learned from his teachers in Arts at Paris:\n\n\nAll correct understanding proves and concludes to the truth\nof the divine being, because knowledge of the divine truth is\nimpressed on every soul, and all knowledge comes about through the\ndivine truth. Every affirmative proposition proves and concludes to\nthat truth. For every such proposition posits something. And when\nsomething is posited, the true is posited; and when the true\nis posited that truth which is the cause of the true is also\nposited. (In I Sent. d. 8, pars 1, art. 1, q. 2, resp.\n[Quaracchi I: 155a]; trans. Houser and Noone 2013, 108 [modified])\n\n\nBonaventure understood that the step from a true proposition to divine\ntruth is a large one, so he advocates a moderate illuminationist\nposition, one that depends on both divine and created causes.\nBonaventure\u2019s Augustinian illumination theory avoids the\nproblems of Platonism, which turns knowing the world into knowing God,\nand the problems of Muslim illuminationism, which thought a creature\ncould do what it takes the infinite mind of God to accomplish.\n\n\nFor certain knowledge, eternal reason is necessarily\ninvolved as a regulative and motive cause, however, not as the sole\ncause or in its full clarity, but along with a created cause\nand as contuited by us \u201cin part\u201d in accord with our\npresent state of life. (De scientia Christi q. 4 concl.\n[Quaracchi V: 23]; trans. Hayes 1992, 134 [modified])\n\n\nTo explain the contribution of the \u201ccreated\u201d causes of\nknowledge, Bonaventure noted that the content of human\nknowledge comes from four kinds of \u201ccreated\u201d causes: the\npassive intellect within the individual soul as material\ncause, for it receives knowledge; the individual agent intellect as\nefficient cause, for it abstracts the content of knowledge\nfrom sensation; the essence of an individual creature known as\nformal cause, for the creature is \u201cwhat\u201d we know;\nand epistemological truth as end. These \u201cproper\nprinciples\u201d of knowledge do not involve God (In II\nSent. d. 24, pars 1, art. 2, q. 4 [Quaracchi II: 567\u2013571];\ncf. J. Quinn 1973: 345\u2013352).\n\nAbove and beyond these \u201ccreated\u201d causes, knowledge also\nrequires an \u201ceternal\u201d cause. In the mental acts of\nabstracting universals and arguing inductively, the human mind\ngeneralizes well beyond the data of our experience. It is one thing to\nbe able to generalize so, quite another to be sure one has succeeded.\nIntuition into the essence of a creature involves truths that are not\nonly universal, but also necessary and certain. God is acquainted with\nthe full extension of any universal since the divine idea of any truth\nconsists in knowledge of that truth in absolutely all its actual\nand possible instantiations. The infinite extension of\nGod\u2019s knowledge is what makes divine understanding certain, and\nthis certainty in the divine mind is on loan, so to speak, to the\nhuman mind.\n\n\nIf full knowledge requires recourse to a truth which is fully\nimmutable and stable, and to a light which is completely\ninfallible, it is necessary for this sort of knowledge to have\nrecourse to the heavenly art as to light and truth: a light, I\nsay, which gives infallibility to the [created] knower, and a\ntruth which gives immutability to the [created] object of knowledge.\n(De scientia Christi q. 4, concl. [Quaracchi V: 23]; trans.\nHayes 1992, 135 [modified])\n\n\nHere Bonaventure makes more precise Augustine\u2019s\n\u201clight\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d. They are the two sides of\ncertitude, so it is the certainty, and only the certainty, found in\nhuman knowledge that requires divine illumination; all other features\nof human knowledge\u2014abstraction, universality,\ncorrespondence\u2014come from created causes.\n5.2 Bonaventure\u2019s Aitiological Argument\n\nThe aitiological argument is \u201cmore certain\u201d, because it\nbegins with a real effect outside the mind and therefore better fits\nAristotle\u2019s model of demonstration. But Bonaventure does not\nfollow Aristotle\u2019s argument from motion, because motion falls\nunder the categories. More promising were neoplatonic aitiological\narguments (Boethius Consolatio philosophiae, III 10; Anselm\nMonologion, 1\u20133), which combine an empirical premise\nwith a participation premise. This is how Bonaventure packed his\naitiological argument into a single syllogism:\n\n\nEvery truth and every created nature proves and leads to the existence\nof the divine truth. For if there is being by participation and from\nanother, there must exist a being due to its own essence and not from\nanother. (In I Sent. d. 8, art. 1, q. 2, resp. [Quaracchi I:\n155a]; trans. Houser and Noone 2013, 108)\n\n\nFor his empirical premise Bonaventure turns again to truth,\nbut ontological truth. All creatures are true to the extent that they\nactualize the potential perfections of their natures, and they are\nfalse to the extent that they fail to do so, because ontological truth\nis \u201cthe indivision of act and potency\u201d. So \u201cin a\ncreature there is indivision combined with difference between\nact and potency\u201d. All creatures are partial\nactualizations of truth. Ontological truth takes us to the heart of\nBonaventurean metaphysics. Aristotle\u2019s definition of prime\nmatter as pure potency means that everything that contains potency of\nany sort, even an angel, must contain matter. This universal\nhylomorphism leads in turn to Bonaventure\u2019s doctrine of\nbeing:\n\n\nMatter gives independent existence (existere) to form, while\nform gives the act of being (essendi actum) to matter.\n\nExistere dat materia formae, sed essendi actum dat forma\nmateriae (In II Sent. d. 3, pars 1, art. 2, q. 3 concl.\n[Quaracchi II: 110]; trans. authors)\n\n\nEvery created being (ens) is an ontological composite of\nindependent existence (existere) and being (esse),\nwhere esse signifies the nature or essence of the thing. From\nrocks to angels, all creatures are true to the extent that the\npotencies of their \u201cexistence\u201d given by matter are\nrealized through the perfection of their \u201cbeing\u201d through\nform.\n\nThe participation premise moves from effect to cause within\nthe line of formal causality. A necessary condition for the existence\nof any attribute by participation is that the same attribute\nis present in its exemplar essentially, that is,\nintrinsically. Participation does not immediately take us to God, but\ninitially describes relations between creatures. A statue or computer\ncan have certain human attributes\u2014shape, color, size,\ncomputational skill\u2014but only because these features are caused\nby the artisan who made it. This is how participation works within\nthe created order. It is transcendental \u201ctruth\u201d that\nmoves the argument beyond creatures to God. If incomplete realization\nof an intrinsically imperfect categorical attribute\u2014like white\nor horse or dirt\u2014implies that those attributes must also exist\nin some other creature \u201cessentially\u201d, then transcendental\nattributes should behave the same way. But no creature could be such\nan exemplar. The exemplar for ontological truth must therefore be God,\nwho perfectly realizes his own essence, which is to say that God is\ntrue \u201cessentially\u201d. In On the Mystery of the\nTrinity, Bonaventure expands this line of argument further in the\ndirection of the transcendentals. There he identifies nine more\ndisjunctive transcendentals, in addition to the pair \u201cby\nparticipation\u201d and \u201cessentially\u201d, where the lesser\nimplies the existence of the greater (De mysterio trinitatis\n1.1 arg. 11\u201320 [Quaracchi V:\n 46b\u201347b]).[24]\n\nJust as his illumination argument uncovered God as a kind of formal\nand efficient cause of certitude, so Bonaventure\u2019s aitiological\nargument uncovers God as formal cause of truth in creatures. But in\naddition, it ends just where his ontological argument begins. For what\ndoes an ontological argument do but peer into the inner logic of such\nan exemplar essence and try to capture the logical consequence that it\nmust exist?\n5.3 Bonaventure\u2019s Ontological Argument\n\nBonaventure was the first thirteenth-century thinker to pay serious\nattention to the ontological argument. He read the Proslogion\nof Anselm through Aristotelian lenses. Now Aristotle had recognized\nthree different kinds of scientific principles: common axioms\ngoverning all thought, so well-known that no one can deny them, and\nproper principles limited in range to a given science\u2014its\ndefinitions and postulates. Anselm seemed to mean that God\u2019s\nexistence is an axiom of thought known by all humans, and Bonaventure\nagrees:\n\n\nsince our intellect is never deficient in knowing about God if it\nis, so it cannot be ignorant of God\u2019s existence, absolutely\nspeaking, nor even think God does not exist. (In I Sent. d.\n8, a. 1, q. 2 concl. [Quaracchi I: 154b]; trans. Houser and Noone\n2013, 107)\n\n\nWhile Anselm thought this conclusion rules out even the possibility of\natheism, Bonaventure more realistically shows how atheism is possible.\nThe problem is with our defective knowledge of God\u2019s\nnature. Error there can lead by logical inference to the\nconclusion that God does not exist in the first place. We are\nspontaneously theists but can convince ourselves to become atheists.\nInadequate definition of God points to a second problem. Knowing God\nexists is similar to knowing axioms because both are recognized by\nall. The difference is that we are quite certain \u201cthe whole is\ngreater than the part\u201d, because the terms involved in this axiom\nare so familiar to us; but about God\u2019s existence we have more an\nopinion than certain knowledge, because we lack an adequate definition\nof God\u2019s nature.\n\nThere are two remedies for the defects in our knowledge of\n\u201cwhat\u201d God is, one taken from faith, the other from\nreason. Both make knowledge of God\u2019s existence more like a\npostulate known with certitude by the \u201cwise\u201d than like an\naxiom recognized by \u201call\u201d humans (Boethius, De\nhebdomadibus, 40). For Christian belief and for theology,\nGod\u2019s existence is an article of faith. The other remedy is\nBonaventure\u2019s adaptation of Anselm\u2019s argument conceived as\na philosophical argument on behalf of a metaphysical postulate.\n\nBonaventure\u2019s ontological argument contains two moments, so to\nspeak, one negative, the other positive. Negatively,\nBonaventure\u2019s ontological argument proceeds as a reduction to\nabsurdity of the atheistic proposition. Anselm had taken a peculiar\ndescription of God, \u201csomething than which a greater cannot be\nthought\u201d, which Augustine had used to argue through a\nreductio ad absurdum to the conclusion that God must be\nincorruptible, and Boethius used to argue that God must be good, and\nhe had used it to argue by reductio that God must exist in\nthe first place. Bonaventure recognized the affinity with arguing by\nreductio in support of the principle of\nnon-contradiction:\n\n\nAs a union of things in the greatest degree distant from each other is\nentirely repugnant to our intellect, because no intellect can think\nthat one thing at the same time both is and is not, so also\nthe division of something entirely one and undivided is entirely\nrepugnant to that same intellect. For this reason, just as it is most\nevidently false to say that the same thing is and is not, so\nalso it is most evidently false to say at the same time that the same\nthing is in the greatest degree and in no way is. (De\nmysterio trinitatis. 1.1, concl. [Quaracchi V: 49]; trans. Hayes\n1979, 116 [modified])\n\n\nBut his study of Aristotelian philosophy made Bonaventure more\nsensitive than Anselm to the limitations of reductio\narguments. Positive insight into principles is more than negative\nreductio leading up to principles, so snaring the atheist in\na contradiction is still one step away from affirming that God exists.\nTo make this step intelligible he emended the ontological argument in\na positive direction.\n\nBonaventure therefore explains what makes a proposition\n\u201cself-evident\u201d, which in turn opens the way for deducing\nGod\u2019s existence out of God\u2019s essence.\n\nPrinciples are \u201cself-evident\u201d (cf. Aristotle,\nTopics, 100a31\u2013b21). In the second of Aristotle\u2019s\nmodes of per se (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics,\n73a34\u2013b3), the essence of the subject causes the\npredicate. This provided Bonaventure with an ingenious explanation of\nwhy principles are self-evident:\n\n\nWe know principles to the extent that we understand the terms which\nmake them up, because the cause of the predicate is included\nin the subject.\n\n\nIf the essence of the subject term is what connects it to the\npredicate term in a self-evident proposition, then the essence of God\nmust be what makes \u201cGod exists\u201d self-evident. The positive\nontological argument contains an inference to the existence of God\nthat runs through the divine essence.\n\nMost descriptions of the divine essence are inappropriate for the\nontological argument, but the transcendentals are the right terms\nbecause they do not imply imperfection, can be predicated\nnon-metaphorically of God, and are primordial, the \u201cfirst\nnotions falling into the mind\u201d (Journey 3.3 [Quaracchi\nV: 304a]; cf. Avicenna, Metaphysica 1.5). All more specific\nconcepts presuppose transcendental notions, and Anselm\u2019s own\nformula was no exception to this rule. In his Commentary on the\nSentences Bonaventure used the transcendental \u201ctrue\u201d\nas the middle term of his positive ontological argument; in the\ndisputed question On the Mystery of the Trinity he used\n\u201cgood\u201d, and in the Journey of the Mind to God he\nused \u201cbeing\u201d.\n\nIn the Commentary, Bonaventure introduces his arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence with an elaborate treatment of truth. As a\nrelation, truth always involves a comparison. Epistemological truth is\nan \u201cindivision\u201d between the human mind and the thing\nknown. Ontological truth is an \u201cindivision\u201d between\npotency and act within a creature; the more it fulfills its nature,\nthe truer it is. These two senses of truth open up a comparison of\ncreature as participant to God as exemplar. All three,\nepistemological, ontological, participationist truths, are imperfect,\ncombinations of truth and falsity. They point to their exemplar, the\none \u201cpure\u201d truth, present only in God, where there is\n\u201cpure indivision mixed with no diversity\u201d (In I\nSent. d. 8, art. 1, q. 1 concl. [Quaracchi I: 151b]). This last\nsense of truth Bonaventure uses in his ontological argument:\n\n\nWe know principles to the extent that we understand the terms\nwhich make them up, because the cause of the predicate is included in\nthe subject. This is why principles are self-evident. The same\nthing is true about God. For God, or the highest truth, is being\nitself, that than which nothing greater can be thought. Therefore, God\ncannot be thought not to be, for the predicate is already included in\nthe subject. (In I Sent. d. 8, art. 1, q. 2 concl. [Quaracchi\nI: 155a; trans. Houser and Noone 2013, 108])\n\n\nBonaventure includes the negative reasoning so prominent in\nAnselm\u2019s version, but to Anselm\u2019s formula he adds\n\u201cbeing itself\u201d and \u201cthe highest truth\u201d. While\neach of these three descriptions casts a different light on why the\ninference to God\u2019s existence is valid, Bonaventure here seems to\nprefer \u201cthe highest truth\u201d because the definition of truth\nas \u201cindivision\u201d is the basis for re-conceiving the\nontological argument as establishing an \u201cindivision\u201d\nbetween the middle term and the predicate \u201cexists\u201d. If the\n\u201chighest truth\u201d is \u201cpure indivision\u201d, then the\nhighest truth cannot be divided off from existence.\n\nIn On the Mystery of the Trinity, Bonaventure changes the\nfocus of the ontological argument to goodness, with a memorable\nresult. The basic notion of goodness is not by itself sufficient to\nmount an ontological argument, but analysis of goodness uncovers the\nrelevant terms:\n\n\nNo one can be ignorant of the fact that this is true: the best is the\nbest; or think that it is false. But the best is a being which is\nabsolutely complete. Now any being which is absolutely complete, for\nthis very reason, is an actual being. Therefore, if the best is the\nbest, the best is. In a similar way, one can argue: If God is God,\nthen God is. Now the antecedent is so true that it cannot be thought\nnot to be. Therefore, it is true without doubt that God exists.\n(De mysterio trinitatis 1.1 fund. 29 [Quaracchi V: 48];\ntrans. authors)\n\n\nThe logic of \u201cthe best\u201d (optimum) is different\nfrom the logic of \u201cthe good\u201d. Since goodness completes or\nperfects something, \u201cthe best\u201d must be \u201ca being\nwhich is fully complete (ens completissimum)\u201d. Now what\nis absolutely complete must possess all possible perfections. But\nexistence is not just a perfection, one component among many\nmaking up such ontological completeness, it is the most\nfundamental feature of such completeness. Consequently, such an\nabsolutely perfect being must exist. Bonaventure\u2019s argument runs\nfrom the subject \u201cGod\u201d, through the middle terms\n\u201cthe best\u201d and \u201cabsolutely complete being\u201d, to\nthe predicate \u201cexists\u201d. In the shorter and even more\nmemorable formulation, \u201cIf God is God, God is\u201d, the\npremise If God is God is not an empty tautology (Seifert\n1992: 216\u2013217). It means \u201cif the entity to which the term\nGod refers truly possesses the divine essence\u201d. And the\nconclusion means that such an entity must exist.\n\nBonaventure was well aware of criticisms of the ontological argument,\nbeginning with Gaunilo\u2019s retort that the greatest of all\npossible islands should also really exist. His reply is more effective\nthan Anselm\u2019s because it uses the transcendentals. An island is\nan inherently imperfect being (ens defectivum) because\ncategorical; but ens completissimum is not because a\ntranscendental (De mysterio trinitatis 1.1 ad 6\n[Quaracchi V: 50]).\n\nIn The Journey of the Mind to God, c. 5, Bonaventure focuses\nthe ontological argument on \u201cbeing\u201d and develops it far\nbeyond anything he had previously done. He qualifies esse in\ntwo different ways, creating two different middle terms: \u201cdivine\nbeing\u201d (esse divinum) and \u201ccompletely pure being\n(esse purissimum)\u201d. First he uses \u201ccompletely\npure being\u201d to deduce the predicate \u201cexists\u201d, then\nuses \u201cdivine being\u201d to ensure that it is God who\nis so proven to exist. In this way the basic steps of this argument\nclosely parallel those of the argument based on goodness:\n\n\nGod (Deus) who is divine being (esse divinum) is\nalso seen to be completely pure being (esse purissimum) and\ntherefore must exist (est).\n\n\nBonaventure begins (Journey 5.3 [Quaracchi V:\n 308])[25]\n by repeating the essentials of the earlier versions of the argument,\nbut then moves well beyond them:\n\n\nFor completely pure being itself occurs only in full flight from\nnon-being, just as nothingness is in full flight from being.\nTherefore, complete nothingness contains nothing of being or its\nattributes, so by contrast being itself contains no non-being, neither\nin act nor in potency, neither in reality nor in our thinking about\nit. (Journey 5.3 [Quaracchi V: 308]; trans.\n authors[26])\n\n\nIf \u201cbeing itself\u201d (ipsum esse) distinguishes the\nbeing (esse) of a creature from its independent existence\n(existere), adding the superlative completely pure\nto being itself (esse purissimum) refers to the\nnotion of an essence that does not involve non-being in\nany way: a completely pure or perfect essence. The notion of\nesse purissimum does not presuppose the real existence of\nGod; rather, it implies that real existence. But at this point this\ninference may not yet be clear, so Bonaventure devotes the rest of\nthis short text to showing why the notion of completely pure being\nitself actually entails the real existence of God.\n\nIn contrast with creatures, which are mid-level on the scale of being\nbecause they are open to existence and non-existence, the notions of\ncomplete nothingness (omnino nihil) and completely pure being\n(esse purissimum) have absolutely opposed implications for\nexistence. \u201cComplete nothing-ness\u201d is logically\ninconsistent with real existence, so there is a perfectly valid\ninference from the notion of nothing to non-being\n(non-esse). Nothing cannot exist. If the nature of nothing\nentails its non-existence, the nature of its opposite, completely\npure being, entails its real existence. Making use of the\ncategories of his own metaphysics in this way shows more effectively\nthan merely backing the mind into a contradiction why the ontological\ninference is valid.\n\nThe basis for the argument thus far is a notion, not of God but of an\nessence, completely pure, of non-being. One might ask where\nBonaventure acquires this notion, seemingly drawn from thin air. His\nreply is that conceptual analysis of the first of all notions,\ntranscendental being (ens), reveals this purely metaphysical\nnotion.\n\n\nNow since non-being is the privation of being, it does not fall into\nthe mind except through being; while being does not fall into the mind\nthrough something else. For everything which is thought of is either\nthought of as a non-being, or as a being in potency, or as a being in\nact. Therefore, if a non-being is intelligible only through a being,\nand a being in potency is intelligible only through a being in act,\nand being denominates the pure actuality of a being, it follows that\nbeing is that which first falls into the intellect, and that this\nbeing is that which is pure actuality. (Journey 5.3\n[Quaracchi V: 308]; trans.\n authors)[27]\n\n\nHere Bonaventure peers into the notion of \u201ca being\u201d\n(ens) and finds it has two component principles: independent\nexistence (existere), which gives the being the potential to\nhave a certain essence; and being (esse), the actuality of\nsuch an essence. It is esse rather than existere\nwhich \u201cdenominates the pure actuality of a being\u201d. Here\n\u201cactuality\u201d (actus) means \u201cthat which makes\nthe being actually intelligible, by giving it the actual essence it\nhas\u201d. This movement of conceptual analysis opens the\nmind to see that we can understand a creature as \u201ca being\u201d\n(ens) only by referring to the notion of an act of being\nwhich is pure from non-being (esse purum), indeed, which is\npure from any non-being (esse purissimum). Implicit\nwithin the very notion of transcendental \u201cbeing\u201d\nand a presupposition of our understanding the notion of\ntranscendental being, is the notion of being with no hint of\nnon-being (esse purissimum). Even if only implicit, this\nnotion must be present in the mind of anyone who understands being\n(ens), that is, everyone who understands anything at all.\n\nOnce it has been shown that esse purissimum is a notion which\nimplies real existence and that we all possess this notion as a\ncomponent of the fundamental notion of a being (ens), it\nremains only to identify esse purissimum with God.\n\n\nBut this is not particular being, which is limited being because mixed\nwith potency, nor is it analogous being, because that has the least\nactuality, since it is to the least degree. Therefore, the result is\nthat this being is divine being. (Journey 5.3 [Quaracchi V:\n308\u2013309]; trans.\n authors)[28]\n\n\nIf esse purissimum really exists, as has been proven, it must\nexist in one of three modes. But since particular and intentional\nbeing cannot be completely perfect, esse purissimum must be\nidentical with the divine being.\n\nThe real but initially hidden starting point for Bonaventure\u2019s\nontological argument in the Journey is the notion of esse\npurissimum, taken not subjectively as existing as a concept in a\nhuman mind, but in its objective\n meaning,[29]\n that is, as signifying a certain kind of quiddity or essence. The\nachievement of the ontological argument, as Bonaventure saw it, is\ntwofold: it shows that this essence must really exist, and it shows\nthat this essence is none other than God.\n\nBonaventure locates knowledge of God\u2019s existence within all\nthree parts of an Aristotelian science\u2014as demonstrated\nconclusion, as common axiom, and as proper postulate. It can be proven\nthrough two kinds of demonstrations of the fact, by an illumination\nargument starting inside the mind and an aitiological argument\nstarting outside. Such proofs proceed from created truth as a\nvestige to the one God as its cause. But \u201cGod\nexists\u201d is also a principle recognized by virtually all humans,\na kind of axiom built upon creatures conceived as shadows of\nthe one divinity for whom explicit arguments specifying\nGod\u2019s causality are no more needed than for other axioms.\nFinally, there are two ways God\u2019s existence is known as a\npostulate: first, through the ontological argument, where the\ntranscendental attributes found in creatures function as\nvestiges providing the mind the notions it uses in the\nargument for the one God\u2019s existence; and second, as an\narticle of faith. Here faith is postulated on the authority of\nrevelation and is certain, but its certainty comes from God, not human\nreason. And here, too, features of intellectual creatures, especially\nhumans, function as images and likenesses of the\nTrinitarian God. Knowledge of God\u2019s existence, in sum,\nis ubiquitous. Thus spoke the follower of Francis.\n",
