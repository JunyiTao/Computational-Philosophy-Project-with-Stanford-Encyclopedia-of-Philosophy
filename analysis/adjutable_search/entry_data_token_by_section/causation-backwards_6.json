    "main_text": "Paradoxes\n3. Paradoxes\n\nOf all the philosophical problems to which backward causation (and\ntime travel) gives rise, the paradoxes are those that have generated\nthe most heat in both physics and philosophy because, if they are\nvalid, they exclude backward causation from being both metaphysically\nand logically possible. The paradoxes can grossly be divided into\nthree kinds: (1) Bootstrap paradoxes involve a causal or information\nloop; (2) Consistency paradoxes involve generating a possible\ninconsistency; and (3)Newcomb\u2019s paradox seems to foreclose free\nwill. So if backward causation (and time travel) should be logically\npossible, one has to show that the paradoxes can be resolved and that\ntherefore arguments based on them are invalid.\n",
