    "main_text": "Civil society\n8. Civil society\n\nHegel\u2019s civil society is primarily the place of work, as well\nas where he situates law and the legal system (see Sect. 5). Whereas\nthe Family is ideally a relation of unity from a natural law for each\nother, this gives way to the pursuit of the particular individual\nwithin the system of needs (PR \u00a7182). The Family is a\nsphere where it is all for one and one for all. In civil society, the\nneeds of all are met where I make my particular contribution in a\npro-market economic vision accepting a natural division of labour\n(PR \u00a7189, 198).\n\nHegel sees the world of work as a home away from home, or\n\u201csecond family\u201d (PR \u00a7252). Instead of\nfamilial love, there is a kind of brotherly love fostered through an\nindividual\u2019s connection to a corporation, grouped by the kind of\ntrade all are engaged in which educates and supports its member.\n\nInterestingly, Hegel sees market relations in modern society as a\nfoundation for the acquisition by free individuals of social identities\nincluding social solidarity. We develop our sense of selves through our\neconomic activities and the myriad of interconnections we forge with\nothers in an extra-familial but non-political way.\n\nA key problem is the problem of poverty. If possession of property\nis essential for the development of my sense of right and satisfaction\nof needs, a capitalist economic system which, Hegel accepts, makes\npoverty for at least some unavoidable raises a serious concern about\nwhether Hegel\u2019s ideal social and political philosophy is ideal\nfor all its citizens.\n\nThe problem of poverty is more than a concern about material needs.\nHegel describes those in poverty as forming a \u201crabble\u201d\nsaying \u201cpoverty in itself does not reduce people to a rabble; a\nrabble is created only by the disposition associated with poverty, by\ninward rebellion against the rich, against society, the government,\netc\u201d (PR \u00a7244, Addition). Thus we can understand\nthe rabble as having a conviction about their alienation that may be\nmore likely to find among those who are poorer, but not exclusively\nthem. To be in poverty is to be alienated and see one\u2019s state as\na separate, unfriendly other (Brooks 2020). While Hegel was a strong\nbeliever that through work we could develop our freedom to become\nreconciled to our social and political work, he lacks any convincing\nsolution to how the problem of poverty might be overcome short of\nchanging the economic system (Plant 1972).\n",
