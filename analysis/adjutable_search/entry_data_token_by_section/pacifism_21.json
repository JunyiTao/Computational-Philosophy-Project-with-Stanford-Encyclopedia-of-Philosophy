The clean hands objection holds\nthat pacifists are disconnected from the world of concrete human\nreality. As Anscombe puts this in her critique of pacifism, the\npacifist holds \u201cwithdrawal from the world as man\u2019s only\nsalvation\u201d (Anscombe 1981a, 52). This is tied to a theological\nobjection that holds that pacifists incorrectly believe that they can\novercome the limits of human nature. A version of this objection that\nis often directed against Christian pacifism holds that war will\nremain necessary because of the fallen and sinful nature of human\nbeings. This objection also reminds Christian pacifists that there is\nexplicit advocacy for war in the Old Testament and that Paul\u2019s\nletter to the Romans allows the sovereign to use the sword to\nexecute God\u2019s wrath. The objection holds that since we are not\nperfect, we must employ the imperfect means of war and violence to\nattain moral ends. From this standpoint, defenders of the idea of a\njust war argue that love of the neighbor and the need for a just\nsocial order will occasionally necessitate just wars.\n\nReply: Pacifists might reply to this sort of\nobjection by delving deeper into the requirements of both religious\nfaith and ethics. This objection is tied to a much larger problem of\ncoordinating the demands of ordinary political life with the\nrequirements of morality and religion. Christian pacifists will reply\nto the \u201cbad theology\u201d objection by focusing on the message\nof Jesus in the Gospels; and they will argue, as John Howard Yoder\ndoes, that just war theory is a later development of a lapsed sort of\n\u201cConstantinian\u201d (or Augustinian) Christianity. Moreover,\nChristian pacifists will argue that pacifism is part of a religious\nworldview that looks beyond a materialistic defense of the finite\ngoods of this world. For religiously oriented pacifists in many\ntraditions, a commitment to nonviolence is tied to the attempt to see\nthrough the vanity of temporal things. Nonreligious pacifists will\nreply to this objection by clarifying the importance of clean hands in\nmorality. Absolutists will claim that we have an obligation to uphold\nthe requirements of morality and keep our hands as clean as possible.\nThey will also claim that the world would be a better place if\neveryone took this obligation seriously and refused to compromise with\nevil.\n",
