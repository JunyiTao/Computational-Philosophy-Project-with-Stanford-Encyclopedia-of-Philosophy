And this is\ntrue in the feminist engagement with Confucian philosophy as well.\nFrom the turn of the twentieth century to the mid-1990s, the\nengagement between feminism and Confucian philosophy, as Terry Woo\nputs it, has been mostly a one-sided affair: feminists criticizing\nConfucianism for its victimization of women (Woo 1999: 110). The\ncommon caricature of Confucian philosophy as synonymous with\npatriarchy inevitably leads to the sentiment that Confucian philosophy\nis incompatible with feminist theorizing. Pushbacks from the\nChinese-comparative communities against this feminist caricature began\nin the mid-1990s, centering on the positive comparison between care\nethics and Confucian ren \u4ec1 on the ground that both\nshare the emphasis on caring relations and relational personhood (Li\n1994; Hall & Ames 1998: 79\u2013100; 2000: 75\u201396; and two\nspecial issues of the Journal of Chinese Philosophy: Lai\n[ed.] 2000 and Gu [ed.] 2009).\n\nSome care ethicists have voiced specific concerns regarding the\nincorporation of non-western intellectual traditions into feminist\ntheorizing, in that its distinctive \u201cfeminist\u201d as well as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d character is being adulterated by such\nincorporation (Held 2006: 22; Noddings 2010:\n 140).[13]\n \u201cIndigenous\u201d feminism that frames traditions in a\nprogressive idiom is dismissed as a \u201ccultural recovery\u201d\nproject, seen as easily coopted and swept away by the nationalistic\nefforts. The development of \u201cindigenous\u201d feminism is,\nhence, framed by some as \u201cTrojan horses\u201d from the\nconservative right that would only lead to further oppression of women\non the ground (Dalmiya 2009: 205\u2013207). Curiously, no such\nout-pouring worries are voiced when western intellectual\ntraditions/canonical thinkers are routinely incorporated into\ncontemporary feminist theorizing.\n",
