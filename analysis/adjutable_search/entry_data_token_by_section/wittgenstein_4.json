    "main_text": "The Early Wittgenstein || Interpretative Problems\n2.4 Interpretative Problems\n\nThe Tractatus is notorious for its interpretative\ndifficulties. In the decades that have passed since its publication it\nhas gone through several waves of general interpretations. Beyond\nexegetical and hermeneutical issues that revolve around particular\nsections (such as the world/reality distinction, the difference\nbetween representing and presenting, the Frege/Russell connection to\nWittgenstein, or the influence on Wittgenstein by existentialist\nphilosophy) there are a few fundamental, not unrelated, disagreements\nthat inform the map of interpretation. These revolve around the\nrealism of the Tractatus, the notion of nonsense and its role\nin reading the Tractatus itself, and the reading of the\nTractatus as an ethical tract.\n\nThere are interpretations that see the Tractatus as espousing\nrealism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects,\nstates of affairs, and facts. That this realism is achieved via a\nlinguistic turn is recognized by all (or most) interpreters, but this\nlinguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is\nseen to start off the Tractatus (\u201cThe world is all that\nis the case\u201d) and to run throughout the text (\u201cObjects\nform the substance of the world\u201d (TLP 2.021)). Such\nrealism is also taken to be manifested in the essential bi-polarity of\npropositions; likewise, a straightforward reading of the picturing\nrelation posits objects there to be represented by signs. As against\nthese readings, more linguistically oriented interpretations give\nconceptual priority to the symbolism. When \u201creality is compared\nwith propositions\u201d (TLP 4.05), it is the form of\npropositions which determines the shape of reality (and not the other\nway round). In any case, the issue of realism (vs. anti-realism) in\nthe Tractatus must address the question of the limits of\nlanguage and the more particular question of what there is (or is not)\nbeyond language. Subsequently, interpreters of the Tractatus\nhave moved on to questioning the very presence of metaphysics within\nthe book and the status of the propositions of the book\nthemselves.\n\n\u2018Nonsense\u2019 became the hinge of Wittgensteinian\ninterpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century.\nBeyond the bounds of language lies nonsense\u2014propositions which\ncannot picture anything\u2014and Wittgenstein bans\ntraditional metaphysics to that area. The quandary arises concerning\nthe question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense, since\nWittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to\nbe shown (rather than said) and does, indeed, characterize it as the\n\u2018mystical.\u2019 The traditional readings of the\nTractatus accepted, with varying degrees of discomfort, the\nexistence of that which is unsayable, that which cannot be put into\nwords, the nonsensical. More recent readings tend to take nonsense\nmore seriously as exactly that\u2014nonsense. This also entails\ntaking seriously Wittgenstein\u2019s words in 6.54\u2014his famous\nladder metaphor\u2014and throwing out the Tractatus itself,\nincluding the distinction between what can be said and what can only\nbe shown. The Tractatus, on this stance, does not point at\nineffable truths (of, e.g., metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, etc.),\nbut should lead us away from such temptations. An accompanying\ndiscussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized, what\nthis can possibly mean, and how it should be used, if at all.\n\nThis discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the\nethical reading of the Tractatus. Such a reading is based,\nfirst, on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein\u2019s\nconstruction of a world-language system, which takes up the bulk of\nthe Tractatus, and several comments that are made about this\nconstruction in the Preface to the book, in its closing remarks, and\nin a letter he sent to his publisher, Ludwig von Ficker, before\npublication. In these places, all of which can be viewed as external\nto the content of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein preaches\nsilence as regards anything that is of importance, including the\n\u2018internal\u2019 parts of the book which contain, in his own\nwords, \u201cthe final solution of the problems [of\nphilosophy].\u201d It is the importance given to the ineffable that\ncan be viewed as an ethical position. \u201cMy work consists of two\nparts, the one presented here plus all that I have not\nwritten. And it is precisely this second part that is the important\npoint. For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside, as it\nwere, by my book; \u2026 I\u2019ve managed in my book to put\neverything firmly into place by being silent about it \u2026. For\nnow I would recommend you to read the preface and the\nconclusion, because they contain the most direct expression\nof the point\u201d (ProtoTractatus, p.16). Obviously, such\nseemingly contradictory tensions within and about a text\u2014written\nby its author\u2014give rise to interpretative conundrums.\n\nThere is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein,\nwhich arises out of the questions above. This has to do with the\ncontinuity between the thought of the early and later Wittgenstein.\nAgain, the \u2018standard\u2019 interpretations were originally\nunited in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct stages of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought, even when ascertaining some\ndevelopmental continuity between them. And again, the more recent\ninterpretations challenge this standard, emphasizing that the\nfundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later\nWittgenstein should also be attributed to the early.\n",
