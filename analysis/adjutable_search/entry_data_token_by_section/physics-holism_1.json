    "main_text": "Methodological Holism\n2. Methodological Holism\n\nMethodologically, holism stands opposed to reductionism, somewhat as\nfollows.\n\nMethodological Holism: An understanding of a certain kind of\ncomplex system is best sought at the level of principles governing the\nbehavior of the whole system, and not at the level of the structure\nand behavior of its component parts.\n\n\nMethodological Reductionism: An understanding of a complex\nsystem is best sought at the level of the structure and behavior of\nits component parts.\n\n\nThis seems to capture much of what is at stake in debates about holism\nin social and biological science. In social science, societies are the\ncomplex systems, composed of individuals; while in biology, the\ncomplex systems are organisms, composed of cells, and ultimately of\nproteins, DNA and other molecules. A methodological individualist\nmaintains that the right way to approach the study of a society is to\ninvestigate the behavior of the individual people that compose it. A\nmethodological holist, on the other hand, believes that such an\ninvestigation will fail to shed much light on the nature and\ndevelopment of society as a whole. There is a corresponding debate\nwithin physics. Methodological reductionists favor an approach to\n(say) condensed matter physics which seeks to understand the behavior\nof a solid or liquid by applying quantum mechanics (say) to its\ncomponent molecules, atoms, ions or electrons. Methodological holists\nthink this approach is misguided: As one condensed matter physicist\nput it \u201cthe most important advances in this area come about by\nthe emergence of qualitatively new concepts at the intermediate or\nmacroscopic levels\u2014concepts which, one hopes, will be compatible\nwith one\u2019s information about the microscopic constituents, but\nwhich are in no sense logically dependent on it.\u201d (Leggett 1987,\np.113)\n\nIt is surprisingly difficult to find methodological reductionists\namong physicists. The elementary particle physicist Steven Weinberg,\nfor example, is an avowed reductionist. He believes that by asking any\nsequence of deeper and deeper why-questions one will arrive ultimately\nat the same fundamental laws of physics. But this explanatory\nreductionism is metaphysical in so far as he takes explanation to be\nan ontic rather than a pragmatic category. On this view, it is not\nphysicists but the fundamental laws themselves that explain why\n\u201chigher level\u201d scientific principles are the way they are.\nWeinberg (1992) explicitly distinguishes his view from methodological\nreductionism by saying that there is no reason to suppose that the\nconvergence of scientific explanations must lead to a convergence of\nscientific methods.\n",
