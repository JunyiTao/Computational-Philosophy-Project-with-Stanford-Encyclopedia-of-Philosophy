    "main_text": "Four Forms of Recognition || Elementary Recognition\n2.1 Elementary Recognition\n\n\nHegel\u2019s famous idea that we gain self-consciousness only\nthrough a process of mutual recognition (see 1.1 above) has been taken\nup by some neo-Hegelian philosophers of mind. They make the\nsocio-ontological claim that the world is always cooperatively\n(re)constructed by human agents (see Pinkard 1994, Pippin 2008, also\nthe contributions in Ik\u00e4heimo/Laitinen 2011). Only mutual\nrecognition that grants others the status of an epistemic authority\nallows us to construct a normative space of reasons: I know that the\ntruth of my judgment depends on you being able to share it (Brandom\n1994). Thus, such accounts try to explain how reason can enter the\nworld in the first place\u2014and therefore this kind of elementary\nrecognition does not seem to depend on values or norms but rather be a\nsource thereof. As early as the 1960s and 1970s, Karl-Otto Apel and J\u00fcrgen Habermas similarly developed their respective variants\nof discourse ethics stressing that the proper use of language already\npresupposes a certain form of recognition of all other speakers as\nequally authoritative (see on both Habermas 1991, ch. 2, for a critique of this argument Wellmer 1986, 108\u2013111, for a good introduction Baynes 2015). However, human beings never create their world\nor the reasons they use from scratch. Rather, they are embedded in\nholistic webs of meanings which they jointly reproduce (and\nmay hereby also redo). Theories of recognition hereby provide\nthe ground for a critique of atomistic views of subjectivity\n(especially in Taylor 1989, part I).\n\n\nSome have even argued that only empathy with other persons allows us\nto take over their perspective (Cavell 1969) which, again, seems to be\na prerequisite for sharing their evaluative reasons: recognition is\nprimary to cognition (Honneth 2005, 40\u201344). These ideas have gained\nadditional currency through psychological findings suggesting that the\nchild\u2019s brain can only develop cognitively if she is able\nto be emotionally attached to her primary care-givers. Only by being\ninterested in sharing experiences with other autonomous beings does the\nchild gain access to the world of meaning (Tomasello 1999, Hobson\n2002).\n\n\nIn this vein it has been argued that people come to recognize others\nas persons very early on. Already the baby learns to recognize her\nattachment figures as intelligible beings, i.e., as meaning-conferring\nand autonomous. Quite automatically, so the argument goes, the child\nthen later perceives all other humans as humans. Only\nafterwards the subject may become blind to this \u201cantecedent\nrecognition\u201d (Honneth 2005, 58). Such \u201cforgetfulness of\nrecognition\u201d is supposedly caused either by reifying social\npractices which prompt individuals to perceive subjects merely as\nobjects or by ideological belief systems that depict some human beings\nas non- or sub-human (Honneth 2005, 59\u201360).\n\n\nIn sum, this elementary form shows that recognition is not only\nneeded for the creation and preservation of a subject\u2019s identity,\nbut that it also denotes a basic normative attitude. Brandom emphasizes\nthat\u2014besides constituting self-consciousness as an\n\u201cessentially, and not just accidentally, [\u2026]\nsocial achievement [\u2026]\u2014recognition is a\nnormative attitude. To recognize someone is to take her to be\nthe subject of normative statuses, that is, of commitments and\nentitlements, as capable of undertaking responsibilities and exercising\nauthority\u201d (Brandom 2007, 136, emphasis in original). Whereas Brandom concentrates on\nrather basic normative ascriptions, all phenomena of recognition can be\ndescribed as inherently normative. In particular, there is one specific\nform of recognition in modernity that seems to flow quite naturally\nfrom our basic capacity of recognizing each other in the elementary\nform sketched so far, namely equal respect.\n",
