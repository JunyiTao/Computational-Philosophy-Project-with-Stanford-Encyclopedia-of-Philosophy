    "main_text": "\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) argued that the supreme principle of\nmorality is a principle of practical rationality that he dubbed the\n\u201cCategorical Imperative\u201d (CI). Kant characterized the CI\nas an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle that\nwe must follow despite any natural desires we may have to the\ncontrary. All specific moral requirements, according to Kant, are\njustified by this principle, which means that all immoral actions are\nirrational because they violate the CI. Other philosophers, such as\nHobbes, Locke and Aquinas, had also argued that moral requirements are\nbased on standards of rationality. However, these standards were\neither instrumental principles of rationality for satisfying\none\u2019s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rational principles\nthat are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas. Kant agreed\nwith many of his predecessors that an analysis of practical reason\nreveals the requirement that rational agents must conform to\ninstrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformity to the CI\n(a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moral requirements\nthemselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to rational\nagency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that a\nrational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the sense of\nbeing the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental principle\nof morality \u2014 the CI \u2014 is none other than the law of an\nautonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\nis a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs goes well\nbeyond that of a Humean \u2018slave\u2019 to the passions. Moreover,\nit is the presence of this self-governing reason in each person that\nKant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as possessed of\nequal worth and deserving of equal respect.\n\nKant\u2019s most influential positions in moral philosophy are found\nin The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (hereafter,\n\u201cGroundwork\u201d) but he developed, enriched, and in\nsome cases modified those views in later works such as The\nCritique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals,\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion\nwithin the Boundaries of Mere Reason as well as his essays on\nhistory and related topics. Kant\u2019s Lectures on Ethics,\nwhich were lecture notes taken by three of his students on the courses\nhe gave in moral philosophy, also include relevant material for\nunderstanding his views. We will mainly focus on the foundational\ndoctrines of the Groundwork, even though in recent years some\nscholars have become dissatisfied with this standard approach to\nKant\u2019s views and have turned their attention to the later works.\nWe find the standard approach most illuminating, though we will\nhighlight important positions from the later works where needed.\n",
