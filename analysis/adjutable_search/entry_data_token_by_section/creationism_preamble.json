    "main_text": "\n\nAt a broad level, a Creationist is someone who believes in a god who\nis absolute creator of heaven and earth, out of nothing, by an act of\nfree will. Such a deity is generally thought to be\n\u201ctranscendent\u201d meaning beyond human experience, and\nconstantly involved (\u2018immanent\u2019) in the creation, ready to\nintervene as necessary, and without whose constant concern the\ncreation would cease or disappear. Christians, Jews, and Muslims are\nall Creationists in this sense. Generally they are known as\n\u2018theists,\u2019 distinguishing them from \u2018deists,\u2019\nthat is people who believe that there is a designer who might or might\nnot have created the material on which he (or she or it) is working\nand who does not interfere once the designing act is finishing. The\nfocus of this discussion is on a narrower sense of Creationism, the\nsense that one usually finds in popular writings (especially in\nAmerica today, but expanding world-wide rapidly). Here, Creationism\nmeans the taking of the Bible, particularly the early chapters of\nGenesis, as literally true guides to the history of the universe and\nto the history of life, including us humans, down here on earth\n(Numbers 1992). \n\nCreationism in this more restricted sense entails a number of beliefs.\nThese include, first, that a short time has elapsed since the\nbeginning of everything. \u2018Young Earth Creationists\u2019 think\nthat Archbishop Ussher\u2019s seventeenth-century calculation of\nabout 6000 years is a good estimate. Second, that there are six days\nof creation \u2013 there is debate on the meaning of\n\u2018day\u2019 in this context, with some insisting on a literal\ntwenty-four hours, and others more flexible. Third, that there was a\nmiraculous creation of all life including Homo sapiens\n\u2014 with scope for debate about whether Adam and Eve came together\nor if Eve came afterwards to keep Adam company. Fourth, that there was\na world-wide flood some time after the initial creation, through which\nonly a limited number of humans and animals survived. Fifth, that\nthere were other events such as the Tower of Babel and the turning of\nLot\u2019s wife into a pillar of salt. Creationists (in this narrow\nsense) have variously been known as Fundamentalists or biblical\nliteralists, and sometimes \u2013 especially when they are pushing\nthe scientific grounds for their beliefs \u2013 as Scientific\nCreationists. Today\u2019s Creationists are often marked by\nenthusiasm for something that is known as Intelligent Design. Because\nthe relationship between Creationism in the sense of literalism and\nIntelligent Design is somewhat complex, examination of this\nrelationship will be left until later and, until stated otherwise, the\nfollowing discussion focusses on literalists. (Because\n\u2018literalist\u2019 is the common term, we continue to use it.\nMore accurately, such people are better known as\n\u2018inerrantists,\u2019 implying that the stress is less on the\nactual words and more on the interpretation, especially given the\nextent to which they interpret the Bible, especially when it comes to\nprophecies.)\n\nWith significant provisos to be noted below, Creationists are strongly\nopposed to a world created by evolution, particularly to a world as\ndescribed by Charles Darwin in his Origin of Species.\nCreationists (certainly traditional Creationists) oppose the fact\n(pattern) of evolution, namely that all organisms living and dead are\nthe end products of a natural process of development from a few forms,\nperhaps ultimately from inorganic materials (\u2018common\ndescent\u2019). Often this is known as \u2018macroevolution\u2019\nas opposed to \u2018microevolution,\u2019 meaning apes to humans\nrather than merely one species of finch to another. Creationists also\noppose claims about the total adequacy of the Darwinian version of the\ntheory of evolution, namely that population pressures lead to a\nstruggle for existence; that organisms differ in random ways brought\non by errors in the material of heredity (\u2018mutations\u2019 in\nthe \u2018genes\u2019); that the struggle and variation leads to a\nnatural form of selection, with some surviving and reproducing and\nothers failing; and that the end consequence of all of this is\nevolution, in the direction of well-adapted organisms.\n",
