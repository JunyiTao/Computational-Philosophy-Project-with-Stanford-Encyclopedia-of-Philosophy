Apparently, they ask of an aggregation procedure only that it\nwill come up with a social preference ordering no matter what\neverybody prefers (U and SO), that it will resemble\ncertain democratic arrangements in some ways (WP\nand I), and that it will not resemble certain undemocratic\narrangements in another way (D). Taken together, though,\nthese conditions exclude all possibility of deriving social\npreferences. It is time to consider them more closely. \n",
