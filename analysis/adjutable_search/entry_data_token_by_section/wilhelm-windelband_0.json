Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen,\nattending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and\nstudying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen.\nFischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s\nphilosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of\nphilosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom\nZufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s\nsupervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the\nGerman-French war. After his military service, he completed his\nhabilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as\n\u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in\n1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine\npsychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the\ncertainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study].\nIn 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have\nfour children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of\n\u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on\npsychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in\nFreiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the\nUniversity of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich\nand Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and\nphilosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core\nthemes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history.\nWindelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of\nStrasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until\n1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg.\nBetween 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of\nHeidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d.
