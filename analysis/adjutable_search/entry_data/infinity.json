    "preamble": "\n\nInfinity is a big topic. Most people have some conception of\nthings that have no bound, no boundary, no limit, no end. The rigorous\nstudy of infinity began in mathematics and philosophy, but the\nengagement with infinity traverses the history of cosmology,\nastronomy, physics, and theology. In the natural and social sciences,\nthe infinite sometimes appears as a consequence of our theories\nthemselves (Barrow 2006, Luminet and Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey 2005) or in\nthe modelling of the relevant phenomena (Fletcher et al. 2019).\nMathematics itself has appealed to some form of infinity from its\nbeginning (infinitely many numbers, shapes, iterated addition or\ndivision of segments) and its contemporary practice requires\ninfinitary foundations. Any field that employs mathematics at least\nflirts with infinity indirectly, and in many cases courts it\ndirectly.\n\nPhilosophy countenances infinity in myriad ways, either directly or\nindirectly, in most of its sub-fields\u2014here is a tiny sample\ntaken from the contemporary discussion (we shall discuss historical\nmaterial in Section\n 1\n and in Section\n 2,\n and many further examples in later sections). Some metaphysicians\ncontend that there are infinitely many possibilities/possible worlds\nand canvas how big this infinity is (e.g. Lewis 1986). Philosophers of\nreligion debate whether the divine is infinite, whether the divine\ncreation is infinite, and whether the value of the afterlife is\ninfinite. Epistemologists debate whether there can be an infinite\nregress of justification, and if so, whether it is problematic (Klein\n2000, Peijnenburg 2007, Atkinson and Peijnenburg 2017). Formal\nepistemologists traffic largely in an infinitary notion of\n\u2018probability\u2019 (more in Section\n 6).\n Population ethics for infinite populations is a lively topic, and\nthey are thought to pose distinctive problems for consequentialism\n(Nelson 1991). Social and political philosophy appeal to the notion of\nconvention, often thought to involve \u2018common knowledge\u2019,\nwith a putative infinite hierarchy of mutual knowledge (Lewis 1969).\nPhilosophers of language and mind grapple with problems that\ninfinitary operations such as \u2018plus\u2019 create for meaning\nand rule-following (Kripke 1982), and whether language itself, or\nminds themselves, can be infinite (Nefdt 2019). Philosophers of\nmathematics debate whether stipulations that imply the existence of\ninfinitely many objects can be said to be analytic (Boolos 1997,\nWright 1999) and whether criteria of identity for infinite numbers\nmust necessarily be Cantorian (Mancosu 2016). See Section\n 4.\n Concerns about infinity (and human finitude) appear in continental\nphilosophy, not only in its 19th century historical sources (e.g.,\namong others, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche)\nbut in contemporary developments as well (e.g., among others,\nHeidegger 1929, Levinas 1961, Adorno 1966, Foucault 1966, Deleuze\n1969, Badiou 2019). This list can be continued, if not ad\ninfinitum, then ad nauseam.\n\nAt this point, one may be tempted to shout three cheers\u2014or\nperhaps infinitely many of them\u2014for infinity. Indeed, one may\nget the impression that we can\u2019t live without it. At\nthe same time, there are various apparent problems with infinity, and\nit starts to look less congenial. As they pile up, one might get the\nimpression that we can\u2019t live with it. Infinity, as we\nshall see, gives rise to numerous paradoxes that have preoccupied\nphilosophers for millennia. Any praise of infinity must be tempered\nwith circumspection and caution.\n\nSo we have good reason to want to understand infinity better.\nMathematicians and philosophers in particular have done much to\nenhance our understanding of it. This entry strives to give the reader\na sense of some of the main lines of thought regarding infinity.\n\nOur survey begins in section\n 1,\n which unpacks some meanings of \u2018infinite\u2019, and traces\nvarious philosophical conceptions of infinity from ancient times to\nthe 19th Century. Section\n 2\n turns to the historical development of the mathematics of infinity\nover a comparable period. This provides background to a presentation\nin section\n 3\n of modern mathematics\u2019 treatment of infinity\u2014some\ninfinite number systems, infinities of measure, of counting, of\ncalculus, and infinitary operations on numbers. This in turn sets the\nstage for our discussion of mathematical ontology in section\n 4.\n\nUp to this point, it appears that infinity has been domesticated. This\nappearance begins to be challenged in section\n 5,\n when we canvas some classic paradoxes and puzzles involving infinity.\nIt reappears as both friend and foe in the following sections on some\nphilosophically fecund applications of it. In sections\n 6\n and\n 7,\n it is both central to the formulation of probability and decision\ntheory, and the source of more conundrums; we discuss some putative\nsolutions to them. Section\n 8\n presents some problems concerning space and time, as well as some\nprogress that has been made on them\u2014Kant\u2019s antinomies, a\nZeno-style paradox concerning measure, developments in non-Euclidean\ngeometries and relativistic cosmology, and in determining whether\nspace is finite or infinite. We conclude in section\n 9,\n sanguine overall about our relationship with infinity.\n\nGiven the magnitude of our topic, we clearly cannot cover all aspects\nof it, or even a sizable proportion of them. For example, we do not\nengage much with the many roles infinitude plays in science and the\nsocial sciences (except in section\n 8),\n retaining our focus on its roles in philosophy. We limit our\ndiscussion to what can be understood without highly advanced\nmathematics, but provide links to a number of supplementary documents\nthat discuss further issues: infinite idealizations, quadratures of\nthe circle, overviews of two recent developments in mathematics that\npromise to make the infinite realm more tractable (numerosity theories\nand surreal numbers), further paradoxes (God\u2019s lottery, two\nenvelopes), and proofs of theorems. We ask for the forbearance of\nreaders whose favorite topics have been left out. We hope to mitigate\nthis somewhat with our large set of pointers to further topics, the\nreferences in our extensive bibliography, and other internet\nresources.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Infinity in philosophy: some historical remarks\n\nIn Greek, \u2018to apeiron\u2019 means \u2018the infinite\u2019:\n\u2018a\u2019 denotes privation and \u2018peras\u2019 the notion\nof \u2018limit\u2019 or \u2018bound\u2019. Etymologically, the\nEnglish word \u2018infinite\u2019 comes from the Latin word\n\u2018infinitas\u2019: \u2018in\u2019 = \u2018not\u2019 and\n\u2018finis\u2019 = \u2018end\u2019, \u2018boundary\u2019,\n\u2018limit\u2019, \u2018termination\u2019, or \u2018determining\nfactor\u2019. In contemporary English, there is a range of uses of\nthe word \u2018infinite\u2019:\n\nIn a loose or hyperbolic sense, \u2018infinite\u2019 means\n\u2018indefinitely or exceedingly great\u2019, \u2018exceeding\nmeasurement or calculation\u2019, \u2018immense\u2019, or\n\u2018vast\u2019.\nIn a strict but non-mathematical sense that reflects its\netymological history, \u2018infinite\u2019 means \u2018having no\nlimit or end\u2019, \u2018boundless\u2019, \u2018unlimited\u2019,\n\u2018endless\u2019, \u2018immeasurably great in extent (or\nduration, or some other respect)\u2019. This strict, non-mathematical\nsense is often applied to God and divine attributes, and to space,\ntime and the universe.\nThere is also a strict, mathematical sense, according to which\n\u2018infinite\u2019 quantities or magnitudes are those that are\nmeasurable but that have no finite measure; and \u2018infinite\u2019\nlines or surfaces or volumes are measurable lines or surfaces or\nvolumes that have no finite measure.\n\n\nRelated to the distinction between meanings (2) and (3) is a\ndistinction between metaphysical and mathematical meanings of\ninfinity. This has been usefully employed in some of the most\nencompassing accounts of infinity, such as Moore (1990/2019; for\nanother recent treatment that includes extensive discussion of the\nhistory of infinity see Zellini (2005)). Moore sees the metaphysical\nnotion as bound up with the notions of \u2018totality\u2019,\n\u2018absoluteness\u2019 and \u2018perfection\u2019. While our\nentry is focused on the strict mathematical sense of\n\u2018infinity\u2019, one cannot cleanly separate the various\nmeanings in the historical development of the subject, especially in\nthe first stages. In addition, treating infinity as a\n\u2018perfection\u2019 in theology from the outset does not mirror\nthe complexity of the historical development; for instance, we find\ntraces in the 13th century of thinkers who attributed finiteness to\nGod or in any case denied God\u2019s infinity even when not\nexplicitly stating the finiteness of God (see Cot\u00e9 2002,\n127\u2013144).\n\nThe infinite has been of central concern to Western thought since the\nvery first pre-Socratic fragment. It concerned the philosopher\nAnaximander (who flourished in the 6th century BCE), who identified\nthe principle and origin of existing things as to apeiron. In\nAnaximander, the principle has both an ontological and an ethical\nsignificance. The Pythagoreans (6th century BCE) saw the infinite\nnegatively and emphasized the lack of definiteness associated with it;\nthey also gave it spatial connotations. Indeed, in the 5th century BCE\nthe Pythagorean Archytas of Tarentum (see Huffman 2005, 540\u2013550)\ngave the following argument for the spatial infinitude of the cosmos\nbased on the contradiction that postulating a boundary to it would\nseem to entail. If the cosmos is bounded, then one could extend\none\u2019s hand or a stick beyond its boundary to find either empty\nspace or matter. And this would be part of the world, which thus\ncannot be bounded on pain of contradiction. So the world is\nunbounded. Archytas identified this with the world being\ninfinite. Kant similarly identified the unbounded and the\ninfinite in his cosmological antinomy. In Section\n 8\n we will see that these notions should be distinguished, but a\nmathematically precise articulation of the distinction had to wait\nuntil the development of new conceptions of space in the 19th\ncentury.\n\nThe Eleatics (Parmenides and Melissus, 5th century BCE) held a monist\nconception of reality, the One, and Melissus declared it to be\ninfinite. Such a monistic conception of reality sees change (or\nbecoming) as appearance, and Zeno\u2019s famous paradoxes of infinity\n(see the entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes)\n emerge in this context. Suffice here to say that Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes (the Achilles, the arrow, and others) involved the\ninfinitely small and were aimed at buttressing Parmenides\u2019\nmonism. Working across the 5th and the 4th century BCE, Democritus\ndefended an atomistic theory with an infinite void and infinitely many\natoms. The infinite by this time had shown some of its major aspects,\ntaken as substance by some and as plurality (of atoms, times,\ngeometrical points, etc.) by others.\n\nIf the urgency of problems related to the infinite reached Greek\nconsciousness with Zeno\u2019s paradoxes, the most influential\ndiscussion was due to Aristotle. In order to put Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion in perspective, we need to list a number of ways in which\nmathematical infinity had emerged not only in philosophy, as we have\ndescribed, but also in mathematics. We have already seen with Archytas\nthe notion of spatial infinitude of the cosmos. But in number theory,\nthe natural numbers were considered infinite, at least in the sense\nthat given any natural number a greater one could be found. In\ngeometry, we find both the infinite by addition (any segment can be\nextended) and by division (any segment can be halved). Thus,\nmathematics presented processes of iteration without limit. The most\nsophisticated technique for dealing with iterated processes in the\nmeasurements of plane and solid figures was developed by Eudoxus (4th\ncentury BCE), and we discuss it in Section\n 2.1.\n\nBy the time Aristotle (4th century BCE) developed his discussion of\nthe infinite, this concept had thus made its presence felt in\nphilosophy, mathematics, and natural philosophy (including cosmology,\nastronomy, and physics). It would be hard to exaggerate the role\nplayed by Aristotle in the history of infinity. He articulated some\nessential conceptual distinctions that were to influence all\nsubsequent discussions. He was a finitist in the sense that in his\nuniverse, everything is finite. The cosmos is finite, bodies are\nfinite, geometrical segments are finite, each number is finite, etc.\nHowever, there are processes that can be iterated indefinitely, giving\nrise to what he called \u2018potential infinity\u2019. He claimed in\nfact that \u201cin a sense [the infinite] is and in a sense it is\nnot.\u201d (Phys. 3.6, 206a13\u201314).\n\nAny arbitrary segment can be extended in length (subject to\ncosmological restrictions mentioned below) or halved without limit,\nbut at each stage we remain within the finite. Time is also\npotentially infinite in both directions and can be divided without\nlimit.\n\nThis conception stands in opposition to that of \u2018actual\ninfinity\u2019, which would result if some infinite processes could\nbe completed, carried out \u2018all at once\u2019, as it were. If\nactual infinity were real, then one could have infinitely long bodies,\ninfinitely long or infinitely small segments, the totality of natural\nnumbers, an infinite number, infinitely many instants of time, etc.\nAristotle rejected the notion of the infinite as a primordial\nsubstance, as we have encountered in Anaximander, and most of his\ndiscussion of the infinite takes place within a physical context,\nnamely one relating to spatio-temporal features of reality. As a\nconsequence, Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the infinite fell\nsquarely in what we have characterized as the\n\u2018mathematical\u2019 notion of infinity, where infinity applies\nfirst of all to magnitudes (continuous or discrete) and what is\nquantifiable (time, extension, numbers etc.). His Physics\ndiscusses the infinitely large, excluded because the world is finite;\nand the infinitely small, excluded because the division of matter can\nonly be potentially infinite and thus finite at each stage, never\nreaching an infinitesimal quantity\u2014one that is less than any\nfinite quantity, while being something. The exclusion of the\ninfinitely large also has as a consequence that Aristotle cannot allow\na potential infinity by addition in an unqualified manner (for\notherwise any finite extension could be added to itself sufficiently\nmany times to become larger than the size of the world). Infinity by\naddition, then, is to be conceptualized as a sort of inverse operation\nto infinity by division which gives us the primary evidence for the\nexistence of the potential infinite. This is the implicit force of the\ncontrastive \u201cbut\u201d in the following quote. Aristotle writes\n(our emphasis):\n\n\u2018To be\u2019, then, may mean \u2018to be\npotentially\u2019 or \u2018to be\nactually\u2019; and the infinite is either in\naddition or in division. It has been\nstated that magnitude is not in actual operation infinite; but it is\ninfinite in division \u2013 it is not hard to refute indivisible\nlines \u2013 so that it remains for the infinite to be potentially.\n(Physics 3.6, 206a14\u201324)\n\n\nThe Aristotelian distinction between potential and actual infinity has\nhad a major influence up to contemporary times. (For further\ndiscussion of Aristotle on infinity see Hintikka (1966), Lear (1980),\nKouremenos (1995), Coope (2012), Nawar (2015), Cooper (2016), Ugaglia\n(2018), and Hussey\u2019s commentary to Aristotle (1983).)\n\nAristotle\u2019s conception had, in addition to issues related to the\nconstitution of the physical continuum, important consequences in\ncosmology. While he considered the cosmos to be finite, he thought\nthat the movement of the celestial spheres had no beginning and no end\n(thus time for him, as we have noted, is potentially infinite in both\ndirections). The issue of the \u201ceternity of the world\u201d was\nto exercise some of the best theological and philosophical minds after\nAristotle, especially in connection to theological issues. For\ninstance, Johannes Philoponus (6th century CE; see Philoponus 2004)\nargued in favor of a beginning of the world by claiming that the\ncontrary thesis would lead to a paradox of infinity (we discuss this\nin Section\n 2.4).\n\nPhiloponus presented another paradox of infinity concerning infinite\ntime that we will discuss in the version formulated by\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (11th century CE)\u2014see the\n\nSupplement on al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s objection\n\n\nOf even more pressing significance was the abandonment of\nAristotle\u2019s view on the finiteness of the cosmos and the\nRenaissance move from the finite to the infinite universe described in\nthe classic text by Koyr\u00e9 (1957; see also Jammer 1993). While\nCopernicus (1473\u20131543) put the sun at the center of the\nuniverse, he still worked with a finite model of the universe.\nForeshadowed by Epicurus (341\u2013270), Hasdai Crescas\n(1340\u20131412), and Nicolaus Cusanus (1401\u20131464), Giordano\nBruno (1548\u20131600) defended the idea of infinitely many worlds,\neach of infinite size, existing simultaneously. Bruno is a good\nexample of how mathematical and theological notions of infinity were\nused simultaneously in the history of the concept. For instance, in\nOn the Infinite, the Universe, and Worlds (1584) he argued\nfrom God\u2019s infinite power to the infinitude of the universe.\n\nBy contrast, Kepler and Galileo did not think that the issue of\nwhether the world was infinite in size could be settled either way.\nKepler thought that the notion of an infinite universe was a\nmetaphysical one and not founded on empirical evidence. Galileo\nclaimed, in a famous letter to Francesco Ingoli written in 1624, that\nmankind would never be able to know whether the universe is finite or\ninfinite. The progressive geometrization of space (see De Risi 2015)\nled to Newton\u2019s gravitational theory in which the universe is\ninfinitely extended spatially and temporally. Physical space became\nidentified with the space of Euclid\u2019s geometry and in this way\nphysical space was geometrized.\n\nTheological elements were still present when Newton identified space\nwith the \u201csensorium Dei\u201d (\u201cGod\u2019s\nsensorium\u201d). For the next two centuries cosmology was developed\naccording to Newtonian theory: an infinite Euclidean space, flat and\nabsolute, which provides the receptacle for all physical objects whose\nrelations are structured by universal gravitation.\n\nWith Riemann in the mid-19th Century, and then with relativistic\ncosmology, one went back to a finite universe, but cosmologists are\nnow fully aware that the issue of the finitude of the world is very\nmuch an open question that depends crucially on the curvature and the\ntopology of space (see Section\n 8.2).\n\nOur discussion above indicates a few essential aspects of the concept\nof infinity that will be useful in the later discussion. There are\nobviously many areas of contact and/or intersection between the more\nmathematical notion of infinity and the qualitative notion of\ninfinity. Qualitative notions of infinity cannot be easily\ncharacterized directly but in general they appeal to features that do\nnot seem to have a clear quantitative aspect. For instance, God might\nbe defined as infinite because it has none of the limitations of\nfinite creatures; this property was accounted for in some Scholastic\nphilosophy by claiming that God, unlike finite creatures, is that\nunique entity in which essence and existence coincide. Often coupled\nwith this was the claim that God\u2019s infinity is incomprehensible,\nand this might be a good indicator that we cannot achieve a positive\naccount of qualitative infinity. At the same time, claims concerning\ninfinite divine power or goodness offer a possible connection to\nquantitative conceptions, and this explains why the boundary line\nbetween quantitative and qualitative conceptions is not so sharp.\n\nIndeed, according to some authors the qualitative and mathematical\nconceptions are inextricably tied. Consider for instance\nPascal\u2019s use of infinite distance both in projective geometry\nand in his Pens\u00e9es where he muses on the infinite\ndistance (and disproportion) between finite human beings and the\ninfinite God (see Cortese 2015). The following passage is\nrepresentative of the powerful and suggestive role that appeal to\nfiniteness and infinity plays in Pascal\u2019s apologetics:\n\nFor in the end what is humanity [l\u2019homme] in nature? A\nnothingness compared to the infinite, everything [un tout] compared to\na nothingness, a mid-point between nothing and everything, infinitely\nfar from understanding the extremes; the end of things and their\nbeginning [principe] are insuperably hidden for him in an impenetrable\nsecret. \\(\\langle\\)What can he therefore imagine? He is\\(\\rangle\\)\nequally incapable of seeing the nothingness from where he came, and\nthe infinite in which he is covered [englouti]. [\u2026] (Pascal\n2008: 70; we have added the French original where the translation\nseems less than faithful).\n\n\nMoreover, Pascal\u2019s pari (wager) is also intimately tied\nto the notion of infinity in the form of an infinite reward. (See\nSection\n 7.3\n on Pascal\u2019s wager) These topics are of great importance for\nphilosophy of religion, decision theory, and philosophical\nanthropology.\n\nHowever, this entry does not concern those conceptions of infinity\nthat are connected to infinite divine power, infinite modes, and in\ngeneral about those conceptions of infinity that are not of a\nmathematical kind. We do not intend to downplay the importance of\nthose aspects of the history of infinity to which giants such as\nPlotinus, Cusanus, Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, Fichte, Hegel, and\nKierkegaard contributed, among others. Leibniz and Kant also belong to\nthat list, but we will say more about them later on. But our entry\nwould lose focus if we were to try to pursue all these developments\neven at a superficial level, and the treatment of qualitative infinity\nis worthy of an article in its own right. Thus, we content ourselves\nwith a list of bibliographical references through which the reader can\nreconstruct the contributions to the topic.\n\nFor overviews of the history of infinity which include both\nmathematical and metaphysical aspects, see Moore (1990/2019) and\nZellini (2005). For further discussion of Aristotle\u2019s views on\ninfinity see the entries on:\n Aristotle;\n Aristotle and mathematics; and\n Aristotle and metaphysics.\n For ancient and medieval conceptions of infinity see Sweeney (1972),\nSweeney (1992), Kretzmann (1982), Cot\u00e9 (2002), Biard and\nCeleyrette (2005), Duhem (1987), Dewender (2002), Davenport (1999),\nMurdoch (1982), Uckelman (2015); for the early modern period see\nNachtomy and Winegar (2018); for infinity in Kant and the idealist\nperiod see Kreis (2015); Monnoyeur (1992) spans all periods.\n\nFor more on infinity in philosophy of religion, see the following\nreferences.\n\non divine infinity: Koetsier and Bergmans (2005), G\u00f6cke and\nTapp (2018), the papers in the final section of Heller and Woodin\n(2011), and various entries including\n God and other ultimates,\n ontological arguments,\n Nicolaus Cusanus,\n Robert Grosseteste,\n John Duns Scotus,\n and\n Ibn Arabi;\non infinity in God\u2019s creation, apart from our subsequent\ndiscussion of whether space and time are infinite: the entries\n cosmology and theology,\n cosmological argument,\n fine-tuning,\n infinite regress arguments,\n principle of sufficient reason,\n and\n being and becoming in modern physics;\n and\non \u2018heavenly infinity\u2019, apart from our subsequent\ndiscussion of Pascal\u2019s Wager: the entries on\n Pascal\u2019s wager,\n the meaning of life, and\n religion and morality.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that Cantor\u2019s development of set theory was\ninfluenced by theological considerations: see, for example, Dauben\n(1990) and Tapp (2005).\n\nAs we have said, we are mostly excluding the topic of infinity in\nscience and the social sciences from our purview, although see the\n\nSupplement on Infinite Idealizations.\n\nTo the extent that we discuss infinity in science (notably in Section\n 8),\n our focus is primarily on the mathematical machinery involved, which\nhas a venerable history. This brings us to the topic of the next\nsection.\n2. Infinity in mathematics: a brief historical overview\n\nIn this section we will begin by showing how Greek mathematics\nstudiously avoided the use of infinity in the presentation of its\nresults by making use of the method of exhaustion (3.1). Then\nwe will look at the widespread use of infinitary objects and\nprocedures in 17th-century mathematics (theory of indivisibles and\npoints at infinity in geometry (3.2), infinitesimals in the calculus\n(3.3)) and Galileo\u2019s problem of extending counting to infinite\ncollections (3.4). By the early 18th-century mathematics had undergone\nits first \u201cinfinitistic revolution\u201d (the second is\nassociated with the name of Cantor, see section\n 3).\n Infinity had become a pressing foundational problem, and this will\nlead us to section\n 3.\n2.1 The method of exhaustion\n\nWe have already mentioned that the potential infinite occurs in Greek\nmathematics from the outset, most obviously in the natural number\nseries and in the geometrical operations of addition and division of\nsegments and other geometrical magnitudes. The Greek mathematicians,\nstarting with Eudoxus, developed a technique for measuring plane and\nsolid figures that avoided recourse to the infinite even where an\ninfinite \u201climit\u201d process would seem to be forced by the\nsituation. This technique, known today as the method of\nexhaustion (the expression was coined in the 17th century by\nGregory of Saint Vincent), is found in Euclid\u2019s\nElements, book XII, and then in some of the most spectacular\nresults by Archimedes (3rd century BCE). The idea is to replace an\ninfinite approximation by a double reductio ad absurdum. That means\nthat one shows the equality in area or volume of two figures, say a\ncircle \\(C\\) and an associated triangle \\(T\\), by noting that \\(C \\lt\nT, C \\gt T\\) or \\(C = T\\) and then showing that the assumptions \\(C\n\\lt T\\) and \\(C \\gt T\\) both lead to a contradiction. (Here\n\u2018\\(C\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(T\\)\u2019 refer with systematic\nambiguity to the figures and their areas/volumes.) Further discussion\ncan be found in the\n\nSupplement on Quadratures of the Circle by Exhaustion and by Indivisibles.\n\nGreek mathematics generally avoids any recourse to the actual\ninfinite, and scholars have spoken of a \u201chorror of\ninfinity\u201d typical of Greek mathematics. This is in general\ncorrect with respect to the way mathematical results are presented in\ntheir final and public presentation. However, one should keep in mind\nthat no such \u201chorror of infinity\u201d is to be found when one\nlooks at the heuristic strategies pursued by Greek mathematicians. In\nthe case of Archimedes, this was made evident by the fortunate\nrediscovery of his method (found in 1906; see Netz and Noel 2007)\nwhere we see him using infinitary and mechanical considerations as\ntools he exploited for the discovery of geometrical theorems (see\nKnorr 1982, 1986 and Jullien 2015). For instance, in his description\nof the method for finding the proportion between the area of a\nparabolic segment and that of a related triangle, Archimedes thinks of\ngeometric figures (the parabolic segment and the related triangle, in\nthis case) as composed of infinitely many one-dimensional segments and\nthen exploits the law of the lever to gain the determination of the\nrelation between the areas in question. In a portion of the text of\nthe method that has only recently become available (a section of\nproposition XIV, see Netz and Noel 2007), Archimedes explicitly\noperates with infinite collections.\n2.2 The theory of indivisibles and points at infinity\n\nEarly modern mathematicians were impressed by the Euclidean and\nArchimedean rigor, but there was widespread suspicion (confirmed in\n1906) that Archimedes must have had a less rigorous heuristic method\nthat he used to discover his surprising results.\n\nIn the 17th century, infinitary considerations in geometry opened the\nway to new geometrical techniques in quadratures and\ncubatures\u2014i.e. the determination of areas of plane\nfigures and of volumes of solid figures, respectively. We owe to\nCavalieri and Torricelli a geometrical theory of indivisibles that was\nlater put in an arithmetico-algebraic setting by Wallis (1656).\nCavalieri\u2019s original idea (1635) was that the relation between\nthe areas of two plane figures could be obtained by a systematic\ncomparison of what he called the indivisibles of the figures.\nAn indivisible of a figure is a geometrical entity of lower dimension\nthan the figure itself. An indivisible of a line is a point; an\nindivisible of a plane figure is a line segment; an indivisible of a\nsolid is a plane figure. Consider a square with top side AB and bottom\nside CD. An indivisible of the square is any arbitrary segment with\nthe same length as AB that can be obtained by letting AB move parallel\nto itself until it reaches CD. See the\n\nSupplement on Quadratures of the Circle by Exhaustion and by Indivisibles\n\n\nfor an explanation of how to give the quadrature of the circle with\nthe indivisibilist method, and how this courts infinite\ncollections.\n\nCavalieri\u2019s applications of the theory of indivisibles were\nlimited to finite figures and thus did not go beyond the geometrical\nboundaries typical of Greek mathematics. However, Torricelli broke new\nground with the determination of the volume of an infinitely long\n(infinite longum) solid (Torricelli 1644). Up to then, all\nthe results concerning finite figures obtained through indivisibles\ncould easily be proved by finitary Archimedean techniques and by\navoiding any mention of infinity\u2014just as in the case of the\nquadrature of the circle presented in the\n\nSupplement on Quadratures of the Circle by Exhaustion and by Indivisibles.\n\nHowever, infinity figured explicitly in Torricelli\u2019s result that\nan infinitely long solid (FEOBMDC in the diagram) had a finite volume\n(the volume of the cylinder ACIH in the diagram).\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first infinitary result in Western mathematics, for the\ninfinite was not eliminable using some alternative finitary technique\nbut rather showed up as a feature of the very object that had to be\nmeasured. Torricelli\u2019s infinitary result put enormous pressure\non empiricist conceptions of infinity. The heuristic fruitfulness of\nthe indivisibilist method was also accompanied by paradoxes that\nthreatened its foundations. Among them was Tacquet\u2019s proof using\nindivisibles that all triangles have the same area. The\nindivisibilists were able to deal with such paradoxes in various ways,\nbut the foundations of the system remained shaky (for a detailed\ndiscussion of the foundations of the theory of indivisibles and the\nmathematical and philosophical issues connected to Torricelli\u2019s\nresult see Mancosu (1996) and Jullien (2015)).\n\nAnother area in which the infinite made its appearance in 17th century\ngeometry is in the work of Desargues (see Sakarovitch and Dhombres\n1994 and Desargues 1636). Whereas in Euclidean geometry parallel lines\ndo not meet, Desargues entertained the idea of having\nparallel lines meet at a point at infinity. This was a very fruitful\nidea that led to the development of projective geometry.\n2.3 The calculus\n\nThe most fruitful development in the use of infinity in 17th century\nmathematics was that of the calculus.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, the calculus provides techniques for\ndrawing tangents at an arbitrary point of a curve and for measuring\nthe area under a portion of a curve. The differential calculus treats\nthe first problem and the integral calculus the second. The\nfundamental theorem of the calculus states that these problems are\ninverses of each other. The calculus was developed independently by\nNewton and Leibniz, but its spread owed much to a significant number\nof mathematicians throughout Europe. The first textbook of the\ndifferential calculus was published in 1696 by the Marquis de\nl\u2019H\u00f4pital (1696; see Bradley et al. 2015 for a\ntranslation, which we follow below, with commentary). It is worthwhile\nto consider its axiomatized structure, for it will help us see\nimmediately the infinitary foundations on which the new discipline\npresented itself to the international community. We first have two\ndefinitions:\n\nDefinition I. Those quantities are called variable\nwhich increase or decrease continually, as opposed to constant\nquantities that remain the same while others change.\n\nDefinition II. The infinitely small portion by which\na variable quantity continually increases or decreases is called the\nDifferential.\n\nThe two postulates are as follows.\n\nPostulate I. We suppose that two quantities that\ndiffer by an infinitely small quantity may be used interchangeably, or\n(what amounts to the same thing) that a quantity which is increased or\ndecreased by another quantity that is infinitely smaller than it is,\nmay be considered as remaining the same.\n\nPostulate II. We suppose that a curved line may be\nconsidered as an assemblage of infinitely many straight lines, each\none being infinitely small, or (what amounts to the same thing) as a\npolygon with an infinite number of sides, each being infinitely small,\nwhich determine the curvature of the line by the angles formed amongst\nthemselves.\n\nWe see in the above the explicit infinitary characterization of some\nof the basic entities appealed to in the new calculus. Both postulates\nrequire something that the Greeks had studiously avoided, namely the\nconsideration of infinitely small quantities and the reduction of\ncurves to infinilateral polygons. While l\u2019H\u00f4pital and a\nnumber of French mathematicians were enthusiastic about going\n\u201cinfinitary\u201d, Leibniz himself developed a fictionalist\naccount of the appeal to infinitely small quantities (foreshadowed\nalready in his early De Quadratura which did not see the\nlight of day until 1993; see Leibniz (1993)). Also note the use of\ngeometrical and kinematic (i.e. based on movement, as implied by the\nnotions of continual increase or decrease) concepts. Much of the 19th\ncentury work on the calculus was devoted to removing geometrical and\nkinematic notions from the foundations of the discipline.\n\nThe literature in this area is enormous and we refer to Goldenbaum and\nJesseph (2008) for a recent collection of essays on Leibnizian\ninfinitesimals. The debates on the foundations of the calculus led to\nsome lively contributions, such as Berkeley\u2019s The\nAnalyst (1734) and more mathematical work. But even after\ninfinitesimals were eliminated from the calculus through the combined\nwork of Cauchy, Bolzano, Dedekind, and Weierstrass in the 19th\ncentury, they were widely employed in geometry. Moreover, contemporary\nalternative theories of analysis (non-standard analysis, infinitesimal\nanalysis etc.) have led to rigorous theories that, taken with a grain\nof salt, can be seen as vindicating some of the 17th century\nintuitions. We will come back to these developments below.\n2.4 Counting infinite collections\n\nThere is one final aspect of 17th century discussions of infinity that\nis relevant for later considerations: the problem of extending the\nconcept of counting from the finite to the infinite. This problem is\nrelated to the issue of whether there is only one infinity or whether\nthere might be different sizes of infinity. As we have mentioned,\nPhiloponus argued that the eternity of the world led to a\ncontradiction. In particular, he claimed, if the world has no\nbeginning in the past, then the number of individuals up to Socrates\nwould be infinite; but then by adding the number of individuals from\nSocrates to now, one would obtain an infinity larger than the previous\none, and this, he concluded, is \u201cone of the most impossible\nthings\u201d (see Sorabji 1983). It was typical of Greek thought to\nreject the idea that there can be different sizes of infinity.\n\nThe Islamic mathematician Ibn Qurrah (9th century CE) took a decidedly\ninfinitistic attitude and argued, against the Aristotelian\ncommentators, that there can be different sizes of infinity (see\nRashed 2009). He claimed, for instance, that the odd and the even\nnumbers have the same size, but that the multiples of three are 1/3 of\nthe total number of natural numbers. Contrary to what has been claimed\nin the literature, his intuition was not that the even numbers and the\nodd numbers have the same size because there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between them. Rather we have a\n\u201cfrequentist\u201d intuition: every even number is followed by\nan odd number; multiples of three appear every three numbers, etc. We\nfind a similar position in Grosseteste\u2019s treatise De\nLuce (see Mancosu 2009, 2016 for an overview of the historical\ndevelopments and further references).\n\nGalileo Galilei epitomized the paradoxical situation we run into when\ntrying to generalize counting from the finite to the infinite. In\nTwo New Sciences (1638; Galilei 1974), he presented a paradox\nof infinity. On the one hand, there is an intuition that there are\nfewer square numbers than natural numbers, since the first\ncollection is properly contained in the second (the former has some\nbut not all of the latter\u2019s members). On the other hand, there\nis an intuition that there are the same number of squares and\nnatural numbers, since there is a one-to-one correspondence\u2014a\nbijection\u2014between the natural numbers and their\nsquares. Galileo\u2019s own conclusion, following Oresme and Albert\nof Saxony who had discussed similar issues in the 14th century, was to\nclaim that one cannot apply the relations of equality,\ngreater than, and smaller than to infinite\ncollections. Much subsequent theorizing about infinity can be regarded\nas respecting one intuition at the expense of the other.\n\nThe intuition that if one set is a proper subset of another, the\nformer is smaller than the latter, traces back to Euclid\u2014call\nthis the part-whole intuition. Bolzano (1851) was sympathetic\nto it, and he tried to develop a theory of infinite sets that\npreserved it. He was not successful, but he warned his readers not to\nconflate one property of an infinite set\u2014that it can be put in\none-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of itself\u2014with a\ncriterion of \u2018size\u2019 (what he called the\n\u201cmultiplicity\u201d of a collection). Cantor (see Hallett\n1986), by contrast, later used one-to-one correspondence as the\ndefining characteristic of cardinal numbers: the numbers that\nanswer \u2018how many?\u2019 questions, and that generalize counting\nfrom the finite to the infinite in his set theory. He thus sided with\nthe intuition that if there is a bijection between two sets, they have\nthe same size\u2014call this the bijection intuition. The\nintuition is clearly correct for finite sets. For example, the set of\nfingers on a normal human hand can be paired up with the set of toes\non a normal human foot, and vice versa: there is a bijection between\nthese two sets. And of course, the two sets have the same size (five).\nA central question is whether the intuition is correct also for\ninfinite sets. We will discuss Cantor\u2019s theory and, by contrast,\nsome recent implementations of counting, known as theories of\nnumerosities, that preserve the part-whole intuition also for\ninfinite sets\u2014see the\n\nSupplement on Theories of Numerosities.\n\nIn conclusion, the \u201cinfinitistic revolution\u201d in the 17th\nand the early 18th century left an important legacy for philosophy and\nmathematics. The theory of indivisibles introduced new magnitudes\ncharacterized infinitarily (the collection of all the indivisibles of\na figure), and new infinitary geometrical objects extended the\nclassical geometrical universe. Moreover, the debates on the calculus\nwere focused on the nature of the infinitely small and the infinitely\nlarge. Finally, the issues emerging from Galileo\u2019s paradox were\na prelude to the problem of extending counting from finite to infinite\ncollections.\n\nThese problems were gradually addressed in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, and out of these discussions there emerged different\nmathematical notions of infinity. We will work our way in stages to\nthese conceptions, via a discussion of some landmarks in the\ncontemporary mathematics of infinity.\n\nAmong the numerous general treatments of the use of infinity in\nmathematics we recommend L\u00e9vy (1987), Zellini (2005), Moore\n(1990/2019), Vilenkin (1995), Barrow (2006). For more detailed\naccounts of the history of the calculus, see Kline (1990), Boyer\n(1959), Edwards (1979), and Grattan-Guinness (1980). The most recent\nscholarship on the theory of indivisibles is to be found in Jullien\n(2015). For recent collections on Leibnizian infinitesimals see\nGoldenbaum and Jesseph (2008) and Goethe, Beeley and Rabouin (2015).\nOn concepts of mathematical infinity in the 19th century see\nK\u00f6nig (1990).\n3. Mathematics: number systems, Cantor\u2019s paradise, and beyond\n\nTo deal with some of the issues concerning the infinite raised in\nSection\n 2,\n mathematicians have developed various different structures that\nexplicitly include infinities. These structures ascribe different\nproperties to infinities that are appropriate for different\napplications. In some cases, there are multiple kinds of structure\nthat can be developed for an application. Explicitly countenancing\ninfinities has opened up an enormous range of choices and\npossibilities, which has been a wellspring of development in modern\nmathematics.\n\nWe now give a very quick tour of infinity in modern mathematics.\nSection\n 3.1\n reminds the reader of several familiar number systems: the natural\nnumbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. Section\n 3.2\n discusses the infinite operations of limits and sums that underlie\ncalculus, and introduces the \u201cextended real numbers\u201d\n\\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\). The material in these two sections is\ncovered in most textbooks on real analysis, and even many calculus\ntextbooks, so some readers might already be familiar with it, while\nothers might benefit from having such a textbook on hand to expand on\nsome of the points.\n\nSections\n 3.3\n and\n 3.4\n are more mathematically advanced. Section\n 3.3\n introduces Cantor\u2019s more mathematically sophisticated\n\u201ccardinals and ordinals\u201d, which are probably the\nmathematical developments that have done the most to untangle many of\nthe conceptual confusions around infinity. This material is covered in\ngreater detail in most textbooks on set theory, and parts of it are\ndiscussed in many logic textbooks as well. It can be read largely\nindependently of the other sections.\n\nSection\n 3.4\n discusses a more recent mathematical theory of infinitely large and\ninfinitesimal numbers that provides an alternate setting for calculus.\nThis theory of \u201cnon-standard analysis\u201d has not become as\ncentral a part of the mathematics curriculum as real analysis and set\ntheory. It may thus be unfamiliar to most readers, and it is harder to\nfind accessible introductions elsewhere. Although non-standard\nanalysis is not as central a part of the cultural understanding of\ninfinity in mathematics as cardinals are, we include it both because\nit is a topic of growing interest in mathematics research, and because\nit can help make mathematically rigorous sense of both many intuitive\nthoughts about infinity and some of the early work on calculus in the\n17th and 18th centuries.\n\nUp to a point, various philosophical applications and puzzles\ninvolving infinity can be understood without much understanding of the\nmathematics of infinity. However, the mathematics helps us formulate\nand tackle them rigorously. Mathematics-shy readers could skip parts\nof our tour (particularly section\n 3.4)\n and still benefit from the later sections, but we encourage them to\nmake the effort and read on. The mathematical understanding of\ninfinity is a great achievement in its own right.\n3.1 Some number systems\n\nThe natural numbers form the most elementary number system.\n(Some mathematicians count \\(0\\) as a natural number as well, but some\nothers do not.) \\(1\\) is a natural number. For any natural number\n\\(n\\), \\(n+1\\)\u2014the successor of \\(n\\)\u2014is also a\nnatural number. The natural numbers\u2014\\(1, 2, 3, \\dots\\)\u2014are\nclosed under addition: if \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are natural numbers,\nthen so is \\(n_1+n_2\\). And they are closed under multiplication: if\n\\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are natural numbers, then so is \\(n_1 \\cdot n_2\\).\nWe use the natural numbers for counting \u2018how many\u2019 of\nsomething there are, though they clearly fail when applied to infinite\nsets, for instance the set of squares of natural numbers or the set of\nnatural numbers themselves. This is what \u2018infinities of\ncounting\u2019 will extend, in section\n 3.3.\n\nThe integers consist of the natural numbers, their additive\ninverses (a number and its additive inverse sum to \\(0\\)), and\n\\(0\\): \n\\[\\dots , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots.\\]\n\n\nThey form the most elementary number system that is also closed under\nsubtraction: If \\(j_1\\) and \\(j_2\\) are integers, then so is\n\\(j_1-j_2\\).\n\nThe rational numbers can be expressed in the form\n\\(j_1/j_2\\), where \\(j_1\\) and \\(j_2\\) are integers, \\(j_2\\neq 0\\).\nThey form the most elementary number system that includes the integers\nand that is closed under division, except by 0. If \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\)\nare rational numbers, \\(q_1/q_2\\) is also a rational number if\n\\(q_2\\neq 0\\).\n\nThe rational numbers are dense: for any two rational numbers\n\\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) such that \\(q_1 < q_2\\), there is at least one\nrational number \\(q_3\\) such that \\(q_1 < q_3 < q_2\\)\u2014for\nexample, the arithmetic mean of \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\), \\((q_1+ q_2)/2\\),\nlies between them. Indeed, for any two rational numbers \\(q_1\\) and\n\\(q_2\\) such that \\(q_1\\) is strictly less than \\(q_2\\), for any\nnatural number \\(n\\), there are more than \\(n\\) distinct rational\nnumbers that lie between \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). Where the integers\nspread infinitely \u2018outward\u2019 in both directions, the\nrationals also divide infinitely \u2018inward\u2019.\n\nHowever, the rational numbers still have \u201cgaps\u201d. For\ninstance, if we consider the equation, \\(y=x^3-2\\), we can verify that\nthere are values of \\(x\\) where \\(y\\) is negative, and values of \\(x\\)\nwhere \\(y\\) is positive. However, there is no rational number \\(x\\)\nfor which \\(y\\) is exactly equal to 0. To fill these gaps, we\nconstruct the \u201creal numbers\u201d.\n\nThe real numbers can be constructed out of the rational numbers by\ndefining each real number to be a Dedekind cut of the\nrationals. A Dedekind cut of the rationals is a pair of sets \\(L\\) and\n\\(R\\) such that:\n\n\n\nevery rational number belongs to exactly one of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\);\n\n\n\nevery member of \\(L\\) is less than each member of \\(R\\); and \n\n\n\\(L\\) has no largest element. \n\n\nWe refer to \\(L\\) as the \u2018left set\u2019 of the cut and \\(R\\)\nas the \u2018right set\u2019.\n\nFor any rational number \\(q\\), there is a Dedekind cut corresponding\nto it, where \\(L\\) consists of the numbers strictly less than \\(q\\),\nwhile \\(R\\) consists of \\(q\\) and all larger numbers. However, there\nare also other partitions, where \\(R\\) does not contain a smallest\nelement. For instance, we can let \\(L\\) include all the rational\nnumbers whose cube is less than 2, while \\(R\\) includes all the\nrational numbers whose cube is greater than 2. Since there is no\nrational number whose cube is exactly equal to 2, this pair of sets\nforms a partition, representing the real number we think of as the\ncube root of 2.\n\nIf \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two real numbers, represented by Dedekind cuts\nwith left sets \\(x_L\\) and \\(y_L\\), and right sets \\(x_R\\) and\n\\(y_R\\), we can define operations of addition and multiplication of\nreal numbers in terms of operations on the members of these sets. The\nleft set of \\(x+y\\) is the set of all rational numbers that result\nfrom adding a member of \\(x_L\\) and a member of \\(y_L\\), while the\nright set is the set of all rational numbers that result from adding a\nmember of \\(x_R\\) and a member of \\(y_R\\). (It takes a little work to\ncheck that every rational number is in fact in one of these two sets,\nbut the other conditions for being a Dedekind cut are straightforward\nto check.) If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both positive, then we can define\nthe right set of \\(x\\cdot y\\) as the set of all rational numbers that\nresult from multiplying a member of \\(x_R\\) by a member of \\(y_R\\),\nwith the left set defined as the set of all other rational numbers.\n(Some modifications of this definition are needed if either \\(x\\) or\n\\(y\\) is negative.) Subtraction and division can then be defined as\nthe inverses of these operations, just as for the rationals.\n\nThe real numbers are closed under addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division by all real numbers except 0. They have\nthe further feature that there are no \u201cgaps\u201d: for any\nbounded set of real numbers, there is a least upper bound, and for any\ncontinuous function from real numbers to real numbers, if the function\nis negative at one point and positive at another, there must be some\npoint at which it is exactly equal to 0. For further discussion, see\nthe entry on\n Dedekind\u2019s contributions to the foundations of mathematics.\n\nThere are several uses for which we want a number system with no gaps,\nand thus we use the real numbers. If you try to measure the amount of\nwater in a large vessel by counting out a specific number of small\ncups, there\u2019s no guarantee the number of cups will be an\ninteger. If you try to measure a long distance by counting out the\nlength of your foot, there\u2019s no guarantee the number of feet\nwill be an integer. We might know that something is more than 4 of the\nunits and less than 5. By moving to fractions of these units, we can\nget more precise\u20144 cups and 5 to 6 ounces, or 4 feet and 5 to 6\ninches\u2014but there\u2019s still no guarantee that a specific\nrational number will give the precise amount. But we can generate a\nsequence of approximations that get closer and closer by using smaller\nand smaller fractions of these units. So in measuring \u2018how\nmuch\u2019 of something there is, or giving coordinates to describe\nthe location of a point in geometric space, we use the real numbers,\nto guarantee, as we show in the next section, that there is some\nprecise value the sequence of approximations converges to.\n3.2 Limits, infinite sums, and the extended real numbers; \\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\)\n\nThe mathematical property of \u2018lacking gaps\u2019 is referred to\nas \u2018completeness\u2019 \u2014 the formal statement is that an\nordered set is complete if every bounded, increasing sequence\nof elements has a \u2018limit\u2019. These limits are the first\ninfinite operation that we define on numbers.\n3.2.1 Limits of sequences\n\nA sequence of numbers is an ordered list of numbers, which we\nmay symbolize: \n\\[a_1, a_2, \\dots\\]\n\n\nor \n\\[\\langle a_n\\rangle.\\]\n\n\nThe members of a sequence are indexed by the natural numbers, \\(n=1,\n2, \\dots\\).\n\nThe formal definition of a limit says the sequence \\(\\langle\na_n\\rangle\\) converges to \\(l\\), or has limit \\(l\\)\nif and only if the terms of the sequence eventually stay arbitrarily\nclose to \\(l\\). Formally: \n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n=l\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor each real number \\(\\epsilon>0\\), there exists a natural number\n\\(N\\), such that for every natural number \\(n>N\\),\n\\(|a_n-l|<\\epsilon\\).\n\n\nWe will say a bit more about the symbol \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019 that\nappears in this definition later, but for now it just indicates the\nbehavior of the sequence beyond any particular finite point.\n\nAs we will demonstrate shortly, not every sequence has a limit, but we\ncan define an important class of sequences that do. A sequence is\nincreasing if each term in the sequence is at least as large\nas the previous term. A sequence is bounded if there is some\nreal number that is larger than every term in the sequence. It turns\nout that every bounded, increasing sequence has a limit. The\nsuccessive approximations to the measurement of some physical quantity\nwith a finer and finer measuring unit will amount to a bounded,\nincreasing sequence of numbers, and thus this definition of a limit\nallows us to give a numerical representation of any physical\nquantity.\n\nTo show that every bounded, increasing sequence has a limit, consider\nthe Dedekind cuts defining the individual real numbers in the\nsequence. Let us define a new Dedekind cut by taking its left set to\ncontain every rational in the left set of at least one of these terms\nof the sequence, and taking its right set to contain every rational\nthat is in all of the right sets of these terms. Because the\nsequence is bounded, we know that the right set is non-empty, and the\nrest of the properties of a Dedekind cut are not hard to check.\n\nIt is not hard to check that the real number constructed in this way\nis the limit of the sequence. To see how this works in a specific\ncase, we can consider the sequence \\(1/2, 3/4, 7/8, \\dots, 1-1/2^n,\n\\dots\\) This sequence is increasing, since each term is greater than\nthe one that came before, and it is bounded, since 2 is a number that\nis strictly greater than every term in the sequence. The Dedekind cut\nconstructed as above will correspond to the number 1. To see this,\nnote that for any rational number q less than 1, we can let\n\\(\\epsilon=1-q\\). Then there is some \\(N\\) such that\n\\(1/2^N<\\epsilon\\). The \\(N\\)th term in the sequence will then be\ngreater than \\(q\\), so \\(q\\) will be in its left set, and thus in the\nleft set we constructed above. But 1 itself, and every rational number\ngreater than it, are all in the right set constructed above. This\nreasoning also shows that the sequence converges to 1 according to the\ndefinition of a limit. For any \\(\\epsilon\\), and an \\(N\\) such that\n\\(1/2^N<\\epsilon\\), the \\(N\\)th term in the sequence is within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of 1, and all later terms of the sequence are greater\nthan the \\(N\\)th term, but still less than 1, so they must also all be\nwithin \\(\\epsilon\\) of 1.\n\nThis fact about bounded, increasing sequences also underlies the use\nof infinite decimal notation for real numbers. When we say that the\nnumber \\(\\pi=3.1415926\\dots\\), we just mean that \\(\\pi\\) is the limit\nof the sequence \\(3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, \\dots\\). One fact about this\nnotation that many people find surprising is that the decimal notation\n\\(0.99999\\dots\\) is the limit of the sequence \\(.9, .99, .999,\n\\dots\\), and thus is precisely 1. Some people feel the intuition that\n\\(0.9999\\dots\\) should somehow denote a number \u2018infinitely\nclose\u2019 to 1, but not equal to it. We will be able to make sense\nof an idea like this in section\n 3.4,\n but it turns out that decimal notation is not the way to do it. For a\nuseful demonstration of this point, see Vi Hart\u2019s video\n 9.999... reasons that .999... = 1.\n\nMany sequences that are not increasing have limits as well. For\ninstance, the sequence \\(1, -1/2, 1/3, -1/4, \\dots, (-1)^n/n, \\dots\\)\ncan be seen to converge to the value 0, even though it is not\nincreasing. However, if a sequence is not bounded, like the sequence\n\\(1, 2, 3, \\dots\\), it does not have a limit\u2014if it had a limit,\nthere would have to be some values \\(l\\), \\(\\epsilon\\), and \\(N\\),\nsuch that all terms in the sequence beyond the first \\(N\\) are within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(l\\). But then any number that is larger than the\nfirst \\(N\\) terms of the sequence, and also larger than\n\\(l+\\epsilon\\), would be a bound for the sequence. And some sequences\nthat are not increasing also fail to have a limit\u2014for instance,\nthe sequence \\(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots\\) does not have a limit,\nbecause there is no value such that all terms of the sequence are\neventually within \\(1/3\\) of that value.\n3.2.2 Infinite sums and products\n\nWith the definition of the limit of a sequence, we can now also often\ndefine infinitary versions of the operations of addition and\nmultiplication. For a finite number of terms, we define the\n\u2018partial sum\u2019 \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=a_1+\\dots+a_n\\) and\n\u2018partial product\u2019 \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i=a_1\\cdot\\dots\\cdot\na_n\\). For an infinite sequence of numbers \\(a_n\\), their\ninfinite sum or product (when it is defined) is the limit of the\npartial sums or products: \n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty a_i=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i.\\]\n\n\nThus,\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2^i}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1}{2^i}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1-\\frac{1}{2^n})=1\\).\nWe can show that if an infinite sequence of terms has a sum that\nconverges, then the terms themselves must converge to 0. That\u2019s\nbecause the terms \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\) must converge, so that for any\n\\(\\epsilon\\), there must be \\(N\\), such that every one of the\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\) is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of the limit whenever\n\\(n>N\\). Thus, every such \\(a_n\\) must have absolute value less\nthan \\(2\\epsilon\\), so that both successive partial sums can be within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of this limit. (A similar condition holds also for\ninfinite products, but from now on we will focus only on infinite\nsums.)\n\nHowever, just having the terms \\(a_n\\) converge to 0 is not sufficient\nfor the sum to converge. A deep and important fact about infinite sums\nis that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i}\\) fails to converge, because\nthe partial sums eventually exceed any finite bound. To see this, note\nthat the first term is greater than \\(1/2\\), the next two terms are\nboth greater than \\(1/4\\), the next four terms are all greater than\n\\(1/8\\), and in general there are \\(2^{n-1}\\) terms that are each\ngreater than \\(1/2^n\\). So to get a partial sum greater than \\(n\\), it\nis sufficient to add the first \\(2^{2n}\\) terms.\n\nBut if the terms \\(a_n\\) converge to 0, and each one is smaller in\nabsolute value and has the opposite sign as the previous term, then\nthe infinite sum must converge. If the first term in the sequence is\npositive, this is because the even numbered partial sums form a\nbounded, increasing sequence, and the odd numbered partial sums form a\nbounded, decreasing sequence, and the difference between successive\nterms of these two sequences is a term of the original sequence and\nthus converges to 0. Thus, the sum\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^{i+1}}{i}\\) converges (in particular, to\nthe natural logarithm of 2). But a somewhat surprising fact, known as\nthe Riemann rearrangement theorem, states that if the positive terms\nof a sequence have no finite sum, and the negative terms of the\nsequence have no finite sum, but the individual terms themselves\nconverge to 0, then for any real number \\(x\\), the terms of the\nsequence can be put into some order so that \\(x\\) is the sum of the\nsequence in that order! To prove this, just rearrange the terms by\nbeginning with enough positive terms to bring a partial sum above\n\\(x\\), then enough negative terms to bring a partial sum below \\(x\\),\nthen enough partial sums to bring a partial sum above \\(x\\) again, and\nso on. This process must be able to be carried out, because the\npartial sum of the positive terms eventually exceeds any finite bound,\nand similarly with the partial sum of the negative terms. Since the\nindividual terms of the sequence are all eventually within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of 0, these partial sums must eventually never differ\nfrom \\(x\\) by more than \\(\\epsilon\\), and so the sum of this\narrangement of the terms must converge to \\(x\\).\n\nThus, infinite summation has some importantly different features from\nfinite summation. For any finite set of real numbers, the sum of those\nnumbers is well-defined, and doesn\u2019t depend on the order you add\nthem. But with an infinite sequence of real numbers, there may be no\nnumber that is the sum of that sequence in that order. And even if\nthere is, it may be possible to rearrange the terms of the sequence so\nthat they sum to another value.\n\nBut there are some cases in which the sum can be known to behave\nnicely. If all the terms in the sequence are positive, and there is\nsome order in which their sum converges, then their sum must\nconverge to this value in any order. This is because the\npartial sums form an increasing sequence, and for any two orderings of\nthe terms, and any partial sum of one of those orderings, there must\nbe some partial sum of the other ordering that includes all of the\nterms in that partial sum, and vice versa. Similarly, the value of the\nsum doesn\u2019t depend on the order of summation if all the terms\nare negative. And if the positive terms have a convergent sum, and the\nnegative terms of a series also do, then the sum of the series taken\nin any order must be equal to the sum of these two sums. Such a\nsequence is said to be absolutely convergent, as the sum of\nthe absolute values of the terms converges.\n3.2.3 Limits of functions and the extended real numbers \\(\\pm\\infty\\)\n\nInfinite sequences and sums aren\u2019t the only ways that limits\nappear in mathematics. Functions of a real value can also have limits.\nThe limit of a function of a real value \\(x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to\ninfinity is defined in a similar way to the limit of a sequence\nindexed by natural numbers. To say \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x)=l\\]\n\n\nis to say that for every \\(\\epsilon\\), there is an \\(N\\), such that\nwhenever \\(x>N\\), \\(f(x)\\) is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(l\\). For\nexample, \\(\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty}e^{-x}=0\\), because \\(e^{-x}\\) can be\nmade as small as one likes by choosing large enough \\(x\\). (Note that\nthe inputs to a function can be positive or negative, so we need to\nspecify that \\(x\\) approaches positive infinity to\ndistinguish this from the limit at the other end of the axis.)\n\nBut it is also often useful to be able to define the limit of a\nfunction at some particular finite real-valued input. For instance, we\nmight be interested in the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}\\) as\n\\(x\\) approaches 3. (As we will see in section\n 3.4,\n this sort of calculation is particularly important in defining the\nconcept of \u2018derivative\u2019 of a function, giving the slope of\na continuous curve at a point.) This particular function is defined\nfor all real numbers other than 3, and at any such input\n\\(x\\) it takes the value \\(x+3\\). We would like to be able to say that\nthe limit of this function as \\(x\\) approaches 3 is 6. The way we make\nthis precise is to say that \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=l\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor each real number \\(\\epsilon>0\\), there exists a \\(\\delta\\),\nsuch that for every \\(x\\) with \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\),\n\\(|f(x)-l|<\\epsilon.\\)\n\n\nThat is, for any degree of approximation to the limit that we want,\nthere is some degree of approximation for the input that suffices to\nguarantee that the function is that close. In the initial definition\nof a limit as \\(x\\) goes to \\(+\\infty\\), we required \\(x\\) to\n\u2018approximate\u2019 \\(+\\infty\\) by being sufficiently large, but\nnow we require it to approximate \\(a\\) by having a difference from\n\\(a\\) that is sufficiently small, just as the values of the sequence\nor function approximate the limit \\(l\\).\n\nWe can do the reverse to put \\(\\infty\\) on the right side of the limit\nas well. That is, we say \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=+\\infty\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor every \\(M\\), there exists a \\(\\delta\\), such that for every \\(x\\)\nwith \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(f(x)>M\\),\n\n\nand similarly \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x)=+\\infty\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor every \\(M\\), there exists an \\(N\\), such that for every\n\\(x>N\\), \\(f(x)>M\\).\n\n\nSince \\(\\infty\\) (or more precisely\n\u2018\\(+\\infty\\)\u2019\u2014similar methods work for\n\u2018\\(-\\infty\\)\u2019) can appear in each place where a real\nnumber can appear in this limit notation, it is natural to see if we\ncan extend the definition of real numbers so that it can be\nincluded.\n\nAnd in fact, if we take the definition of a Dedekind cut, and relax\nthe requirement that the left and right sets be non-empty, we get two\nnew elements\u2014the one with an empty right set is greater than\nevery rational number, and called \u2018\\(+\\infty\\)\u2019, while the\none with an empty left set is less than every rational number, and\ncalled \u2018\\(-\\infty\\)\u2019. Within these \u2018extended real\nnumbers\u2019, not only does every bounded increasing\nsequence have a limit, but every increasing sequence has a\nlimit.\n\nJust as the real numbers emerge naturally as the tools to measure\nfinite quantities, as the limits of rational approximations, the\nextended real numbers emerge naturally as the tools to measure\npotentially infinite quantities that can be approximated by finite\nquantities. \\(+\\infty\\) can be taken to be the area of an infinite\nregion, the length of an infinite line, the limit of \\(1/x^2\\) as\n\\(x\\) goes to 0, and so on. Although we are used to thinking of\nlengths and areas as positive numbers, it is sometimes useful to\nconsider them as negative as well, when we care about the direction\nthat they are pointing, and in this sort of situation \\(-\\infty\\) is\nuseful as well. Just as the real number operations of addition,\nmultiplication, subtraction, and division correspond to certain\noperations on the quantities they measure, these operations can often\nbe extended to these extended real numbers, as long as we are careful\nabout a few cases.\n\nAdding or subtracting a finite area from an infinite area leaves it\ninfinite. Adding a shape with infinite area to another shape of the\nsame infinite area leaves the total area unchanged, and subtracting a\nnegative infinite one from a positive one or vice versa is similar.\nBut \\((+\\infty) + (-\\infty)\\) cannot be meaningfully evaluated; nor\ncan \\((+\\infty) - (+\\infty)\\). If you take one infinitely large\nregion, and remove an infinitely large region, you might be left with\nnothing, or a positive region, but you might still be left with an\ninfinitely large region; or if the region you subtracted was larger\nthan the original region, you might be left with a negative\nregion\u2014even an infinite negative region.\n\nThese restrictions also apply to the use of these extended real\nnumbers as the limits of sequences or functions. Whenever two\nsequences or functions both have a finite limit, their sum or\ndifference will have a limit that is the sum or difference of their\nlimits. When one has a finite limit and the other is infinite, then\ntheir sum or difference will be determined by the one that is\ninfinite. But when both are infinite, there are problems. We can see\nthat \\(1/x^2\\), \\(2+1/x^2\\), and \\(1/x^4\\) are all functions that go\nto \\(+\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) goes to 0. If we add or subtract any of these\nfunctions from a function with a finite limit, the resulting function\nstill has limit of \\(+\\infty\\). If we add them to each other in any\ncombination, the result still has limit \\(+\\infty\\). But if we\nconsider their differences, we see that \\(1/x^2 - 1/x^2\\) has 0 as its\nlimit, \\(1/x^2 - 1/x^4\\) has \\(-\\infty\\) as its limit, and \\(1/x^2\n-(2+1/x^2)\\) has \\(-2\\) as its limit. So \u201c\\(\\infty -\n\\infty\\)\u201d is said to be an \u201cindeterminate form\u201d that\ncan\u2019t be evaluated.\n\nMultiplying or dividing an infinite number by a finite positive number\nleaves it unchanged, and multiplying or dividing by a finite negative\nnumber reverses its sign. Similarly for multiplying the infinite\nnumbers by themselves or each other. But an infinite number divided by\nan infinite number, or an infinite number multiplied by 0, are also\nindeterminate forms. As \\(x\\) approaches 0, the function\n\\(\\frac{1/x^2}{1/x^2}\\) has limit 1, while the function\n\\(\\frac{1/x^2}{1/x^4}\\) has limit \\(+\\infty\\). If we take the function\n\\(1/x^2\\) whose limit is \\(+\\infty\\) and multiply it by the function\n\\(x\\) whose limit is 0, we get the function \\(1/x\\), that has no limit\nas \\(x\\) approaches 0 (since it takes on both large positive and large\nnegative values in any small interval around 0\u2014this is why we\nhave used \\(1/x^2\\) and \\(1/x^4\\) as the paradigms of functions with\nlimit \\(+\\infty\\), rather than \\(1/x\\) or \\(1/x^3\\)). For similar\nreasons, these extended real numbers don\u2019t provide a way to\ndivide by 0. So although the extended real numbers have some nice\nproperties, and can be used for measurement in various cases,\narithmetic involving them is not as nice as the standard real\nnumbers.\n3.2.4 Related infinities\n\nThe Dedekind cut construction was done as a way to make sense of\nlimits of the rational numbers. This first created the real numbers,\nwhich can be thought of as the limits of bounded infinite sequences of\nrational numbers. We then considered all limits that made\nsense, including towards the ends of the real line, yielding the\nextended reals, including the standard reals as well as \\(+\\infty\\)\nand \\(-\\infty\\).\n\nVersions of this process can be carried out with other mathematical\nentities as well. Projective geometry adds additional points \u2018at\ninfinity\u2019 to the Euclidean plane, one for each family of\nparallel lines, to help explain features of visual geometry, like the\nway that parallel railroad tracks appear to meet at the horizon,\ninfinitely far away. Riemannian geometry extends the complex numbers\nby adding just a single number \\(\\infty\\) that one can\napproach simultaneously \u2018in all directions\u2019 in the complex\nplane. These alternate geometries provide foundations for material\ndiscussed in section\n 2.2,\n and also section\n 8.2.\n Several of these are discussed in the entry on\n nineteenth century geometry,\n and others are discussed in topology textbooks under the topic of\n\u2018compactification\u2019.\n\nBecause these infinities are inherently considered as limits of finite\napproximations, there is no way for one infinite element to lie\n\u201cbeyond\u201d another\u2014at most it can lie in a\n\u201cdifferent direction\u201d, the way that the points of\nconvergence of different families of parallel lines do, or the way\n\\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\) do in the extended reals.\n\nBut as we will shortly see, there are other notions of infinity for\nwhich one infinity can lie \u201cbeyond\u201d another. In section\n 3.3,\n we will discuss the ideas of infinity that we get from generalizing\nthe use of the natural numbers for counting, rather than generalizing\nthe use of the real numbers for measuring. And in section\n 3.4,\n we will discuss yet another mathematical theory of infinity, which\narises from an alternate formulation of calculus, where the\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\u2019s and \\(\\delta\\)\u2019s are treated as actually\nbeing infinitely small, rather than just being arbitrary finite\nmeasures of smallness.\n3.3 Infinities of counting\n3.3.1 Preliminaries\n\nAs mentioned above, this section is more mathematically dense than the\nprevious two. However, we need this level of mathematical rigor to\ndevelop Cantor\u2019s theory of ordinals and cardinals, which are\nwidely regarded as the most significant mathematical advance in our\nunderstanding of the infinite.\n\nAn insomniac, counting imaginary sheep to try to get to sleep, will\nnever run out of natural numbers to do the job: 1, 2, 3, \u2026.\nThere is no bound on the set of natural numbers. This is our first\ninfinite set. It is perhaps a natural thought that there is just one\ninfinity for counting infinite sets, which we might symbolise\n\u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019. The thought may seem even more natural when\nwe define an infinite set as one that has the same size (in a\nsense to be made precise shortly) as a proper subset of it. In fact,\nthe thought could hardly be more mistaken: as we will soon see,\naccording to mathematical orthodoxy\u2014namely contemporary set\ntheory and the attendant notion of cardinality of a set\u2014there\nare infinitely many infinities. This prompts a series of\nquestions: Is there a smallest one? Yes, as we will see. Is there a\nlargest one? No, as we will see. What can be said about the spacing\nbetween the infinities and how far infinities extend? Well, we will\nsee. We can also ask parallel questions about the infinitely\nsmall.\n\nRecall Galileo\u2019s paradox of infinity, based on the collision of\nthe part-whole intuition and the bijection intuition, and his\nconclusion that one cannot apply the relations of \u2018less\nthan\u2019, \u2018equality\u2019, and \u2018greater than\u2019 to\ninfinite collections. Modern mathematical orthodoxy, embodied in\ncontemporary set theory, rejects Galileo\u2019s conclusion. That\northodoxy is grounded in the bijection intuition, following Cantor\nrather than Euclid and Bolzano. When there is a bijection between two\nsets, we say that they have the same cardinality. The notion\nof cardinality does not respect the part-whole intuition. For example,\nthe squares of natural numbers are a proper subset of the natural\nnumbers, but they have the same cardinality since they can be put in\none-to-one correspondence.\n\nFoundational programs such as neo-logicism also start from a notion of\n\u201cequinumerosity\u201d based on the Cantorian bijection\nintuition. It was not until the early 2000s that a group of\nmathematicians working on non-standard analysis (Benci, di Nasso, and\nForti) developed a theory of \u201cnumerosities\u201d that agrees on\nfinite sets with Cantorian cardinality but that also upholds the\npart-whole intuition for infinite sets, and thus diverges from\nCantorian cardinalities. (See Benci and Di Nasso 2003, 2019; Benci, Di\nNasso and Forti 2006, 2007). One can consider numerosities as a\nrefinement of Cantorian cardinalities. Every two sets that have the\nsame numerosity have the same cardinality, but the converse does not\nhold. For instance, in this approach the set of squares has numerosity\nstrictly less than the set of natural numbers. See the\n\nSupplement on Theories of Numerosities.\n3.3.2 Set theory: \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\aleph\\)\n\nThe sort of infinities that are most familiar to philosophers are\ninfinities used for counting. In the early 1820s, Bolzano arrived at\nthe idea that an infinite set is one for which there is a bijection\nbetween the set and a proper subset of it. (Recall Galileo\u2019s\nparadox.) Dedekind (1884) gave this as a definition of being\ninfinite. It is easy to prove that a Dedekind-infinite set must\ncontain a set that is just as large as the natural numbers. See\nthe\n\nSupplement on Proofs of Theorems.\n\nDedekind\u2019s definition is only one among several alternative\ndefinitions of infinite set (and correspondingly of finite set) that\nhave been proposed by him and after him. If one assumes the Axiom of\nChoice, these alternative definitions turn out to be equivalent. (This\naxiom says that for every set \\(A\\) of pairwise-disjoint non-empty\nsets, there exists a function that selects exactly one element from\neach set in \\(A\\).) But without the Axiom of Choice, the definitions\ncan be shown not to be equivalent and the foundational situation is\nrather delicate but well understood (see Moore 1982).\n\nThe modern theory of infinities of counting derives from Cantor\n(1932). He observed that a natural way to set up a bijection between\nfinite sets is to order the elements of each set, and pair the first\nelement of one set with the first of the other, the second of one set\nwith the second of the other, and so on. This sometimes works with\ninfinite sets\u2014for example, it gives the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the natural numbers and the squares (considered\nunder their standard ordering). When there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between two sets, such that every pair of elements of\none set bears the same ordering as the corresponding pair of elements\nof the other set, the two ordered sets are said to have the same\norder type.\n\nBut for some infinite sets (notably the set of all integers,\nincluding the negative numbers, and also the set of rational numbers)\nthere is no first element under their standard ordering. In this case,\nit is possible to re-order the elements of the set so that every\nnon-empty subset has a first element, so that this process works. Such\nan ordering is called a well-ordering. (That every\nset can be well-ordered is, as Zermelo famously proved in 1904,\nequivalent to the Axiom of Choice.)\n\nWe can reorder the integers, alternating between positive and\nnegative: 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, \u2026. This ordering has the same\norder type as the natural numbers, and thus enables a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the natural numbers and the integers. One of\nCantor\u2019s most striking early observations is that the same is\npossible with the positive rational numbers. Every positive rational\nnumber can be written uniquely in lowest terms as some fraction\n\\(p/q\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are positive integers with no common\nfactor. We can then order these fractions by first comparing the sum\n\\(p+q\\) of numerator and denominator, and then if the sum is equal for\ntwo fractions, put the one with lower numerator \\(p\\) first. This\nordering begins 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, 4, 1/5, 5, 1/6, 2/5,\n3/4, 4/3, 5/2, 6, \u2026. (Note that fractions like 2/2, 2/4, 3/3,\n4/2, are missing from this list, because they are not written in\nlowest terms.) Every positive rational number must appear in this list\n(because it can be written in lowest terms with some particular finite\nsum of numerator and denominator), and only has finitely many\npredecessors (because there are at most \\(n+1\\) fractions whose sum of\nnumerator and denominator is \\(n\\)).\n\n\n\nThe ordering: 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, \u2026. Every\nrational number is eventually included.\n\n\nHowever, Cantor also observed that different well-orderings of the\nsame infinite sets will produce a different order type. For instance,\nwe can define an ordering on the integers where every non-negative\ninteger comes before every negative integer, with any two integers of\nthe same sign being ordered by their absolute value. To approximately\nrepresent this ordering we could write it as \\(0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, -1,\n-2, -3, \\dots\\). In this ordering, every non-empty subset still has a\nfirst element (the non-negative element of lowest absolute value if it\ncontains any non-negative elements, and the negative element of lowest\nabsolute value if it only contains negative elements). If we pair up\nthe first element of this ordering with the first of the standard\nordering on the natural numbers, and the second with the second, and\nthe third with the third, and so on, then the negative integers would\nnot be paired with any natural number. But we can put the natural\nnumbers into the same order type by declaring the odd numbers to be\nbefore the even numbers, and ordering them by size within these two\nsets: \\(1, 3, 5, \\dots, 0, 2, 4, \\dots\\). A single infinite set can be\ngiven orderings of many different order types, and also different\norderings of the same order type (for instance if we put the even\nnumbers first and the odd numbers second).\n\nCantor noted that for any two well-ordered sets, the initial positions\nin one ordering (the first, the second, the third, etc.) correspond to\nthe initial positions in the other, the way that they do for finite\nsets. In fact, he showed that all of the positions of one\nwell-ordering must correspond to initial positions in the other. (If\nthis weren\u2019t true, then the set of positions in one that\ndon\u2019t correspond to positions in the other would be non-empty\nfor each set, and the first elements of these sets would correspond,\nwhich would contradict the claim that these positions don\u2019t\ncorrespond.) Thus, there is a single list of all the possible\npositions in well-ordered sets, beginning with the first, second,\nthird, and so on, and these positions are called the ordinal\nnumbers. A well-ordered set can be said to have its own ordinal\nnumber, which is the first ordinal number that does not correspond to\na position in that set.\n\nA cardinal number (like \u201cone\u201d, \u201ctwo\u201d,\n\u201cthree\u201d)\u2014also called a\ncardinality\u2014represents how many elements a set has. Two\nsets have the same cardinal number if it is possible to come up with\nany correspondence at all between the members of one and the members\nof the other, even if this correspondence fails to respect the\nordering or any other structure of the sets. Two finite sets\nhave the same cardinal number if and only if they have the same\nordinal number. For infinite sets, if they are well-ordered and have\nthe same ordinal number, then they have the same cardinal number\n(because two sets well-ordered with the same order type have a unique\ncorrespondence between elements in corresponding positions of the\nordering). But they may have the same cardinal number without having\nthe same ordinal number: we have seen that sets of one cardinality can\nbe represented with many different order types.\n\nCantor used lowercase Greek letters to represent infinite ordinal\nnumbers, with \\(\\omega\\) representing the order type of the standard\nordering of the natural numbers. Addition of ordinal numbers\ncorresponds to the order type that results from taking an ordering of\nthe first type, followed by an ordering of the second type. Thus,\n\\(\\omega+\\omega\\) represents the order type of the integers with the\nnon-negative numbers first and the negative numbers afterwards, while\n\\(\\omega+1\\) represents the order type of the natural numbers with\njust one element put at the end. Note that \\(1+\\omega\\) is the order\ntype of a single element, followed by a copy of the natural numbers,\nwhich is in fact the same as the order type of the natural numbers!\nThus, \\(1+\\omega=\\omega\\), which is not equal to \\(\\omega+1\\). So\nordinal addition is not commutative.\n\nVon Neumann (1923) defined a canonical representation of ordinal\nnumbers, using the fact that the ordinals are themselves well-ordered.\nEach ordinal is represented by the set consisting of all smaller\nordinals. Thus 0 is represented by the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\), 1 by\nthe set containing the empty set \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\), 2 by the set\ncontaining both of those \\(\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\), and so on.\n\\(\\omega\\) is then the set containing all of these finite ordinals\n\\(\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\},\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\}\\},\\dots\\}\\),\n\\(\\omega+1\\) is the set containing it as well\n\\(\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\},\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\}\\},\\dots,\\omega\\}\\),\nand so on.\n\nMultiplication of ordinal numbers corresponds to replacing each\nelement of the second ordering by an entire ordering of the first\ntype. \\(\\omega\\cdot\\omega\\) represents the order type of an\n\\(\\omega\\)-sequence of \\(\\omega\\)-sequences, which we can have by\ntaking the positive rational numbers and sorting them first by\ndenominator, and then by numerator: 1, 2, 3, \u2026 1/2, 3/2, 5/2,\n\u2026, 1/3, 2/3, 4/3, 5/3, \u2026, 1/4, 3/4, 5/4, \u2026. Note\nthat \\(\\omega\\cdot 2\\) is 2 copies of \\(\\omega\\), while\n\\(2\\cdot\\omega\\) is \\(\\omega\\) copies of 2. \\(\\omega\\cdot 2\\) is thus\n\\(\\omega+\\omega\\), while \\(2\\cdot\\omega\\) is \\(2+2+2+\\dots\\), which is\n\\(\\omega\\). (This is the difference between the orderings 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u2026 and 1, \u22121, 2,\n\u22122, 3, \u22123, \u2026.) So again, ordinal multiplication is\nnot commutative.\n\n\n\n\nBut for any ordinal, one can generate another ordinal by putting one\nmore element at the end. And for any increasing sequence of ordinals,\nthere is a limit of that sequence. Cantor also defined a notion of\nexponentiation for ordinals, and this gives many different ordinal\nnumbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026 ,\\(\\omega,\\) \\(\\omega+1,\\) \\(\\omega+2,\\)\n\u2026, \\(\\omega+\\omega(=\\omega\\cdot 2),\\) \\(\\omega\\cdot 2+1,\\)\n\\(\\omega\\cdot 2+2, \\dots,\\) \\(\\omega\\cdot 3,\\) \\(\\omega\\cdot 4,\\)\n\u2026, \\(\\omega\\cdot \\omega(=\\omega^2),\\) \u2026, \\(\\omega^3,\\)\n\u2026, \\(\\omega^4,\\) \u2026, \\(\\omega^\\omega,\\)\n\\(\\omega^{\\omega+1},\\) \\(\\omega^{\\omega+2},\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\omega^{\\omega\\cdot\\omega}=\\omega^{\\omega^2},\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\omega^{\\omega^3},\\) \u2026, \\(\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega},\\)\n\\(\\epsilon_0\\) (defined as the limit ordinal for the sequence\n\\(\\omega,\\) \\(\\omega^\\omega,\\) \\(\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega},\\) \u2026).\nBut these ordinal numbers all correspond to the same cardinal number,\nwhich is that of the natural numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, one might be forgiven for thinking that there is no\ncardinal number greater than that of the natural numbers, just as\nthere is no extended real number larger than \\(+\\infty\\). However,\nCantor\u2019s second striking result is that the cardinality of the\npositive real numbers is in fact greater than the cardinality of the\npositive integers, and his third striking result is that for every\nset, the set of all its subsets\u2014its power set\u2014has an even\ngreater cardinality. Although many different infinite sets of\ndifferent order types can all be put into one-to-one correspondence\nwith each other, there are some infinite sets that cannot. Sets whose\ncardinality is equal to that of the natural numbers (like the integers\nand the rationals) are said to be countably infinite or\ndenumerable, while infinite sets that are not countable (like\nthe reals, and the power set of the naturals) are said to be\nuncountable. See proofs of the results in the\n\nSupplement on Proofs of Theorems.\n\nThus, just as there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite ordinal\nnumbers, which Cantor represented with lowercase Greek letters, there\nis also an infinite hierarchy of infinite cardinal numbers, which\nCantor represented with Hebrew letters, and in particular aleph,\n\u201c\\(\\aleph\\)\u201d. The finite cardinals are 0, 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026. The first infinite cardinal, that of the natural numbers\n(and all countable sets), is \\(\\aleph_0\\). Cantor\u2019s\n\u201cwell-ordering principle\u201d, stating that every set can be\nput into some well-ordered form (and equivalent to the Axiom of\nChoice), implies that every cardinal number can be represented by an\nordinal number, and the definition of ordinal numbers ensures that for\nany non-empty set of ordinal numbers there is always a first. So the\ncardinals must in fact be well-ordered. So Cantor used ordinal numbers\nto designate each cardinal\u2019s position in their ordering.\n\\(\\aleph_1\\) is the first cardinal beyond \\(\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\aleph_2\\)\nis the next beyond that, and after \\(\\aleph_3\\), \\(\\aleph_4\\), and so\non, we eventually reach \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), \\(\\aleph_{\\omega+1}\\),\n\\(\\aleph_{\\omega+2}\\), and so on with one cardinal for every\nordinal.\n\nBecause we have this one-to-one correspondence between the cardinals\nand the ordinals, one might be tempted to say that the set of\ncardinals and the set of ordinals have the same order type, and then\nask what the ordinal of this order type (and its cardinality) is.\nHowever, if there were such an ordinal, there would be a\nparadox\u2014it would have to contain, and thus be larger than, all\nordinals, including itself! This is the Burali-Forti paradox\n(see entry\n paradoxes and contemporary logic).\n\nRelatedly, since every set has a cardinality less than that of its\npower set, there can be no set that contains everything (since such a\nset would already include all its subsets, and thus be at least as\nlarge as its power set). The two results imply that there cannot be a\nset of all ordinals or a set of all sets. In a similar way one argues\nthat there cannot be a set of all cardinals. As a consequence of the\nabove results we can also answer some of the questions we raised at\nthe beginning: there are infinitely many cardinal numbers and\ninfinitely many ordinal numbers. However, there is neither a set of\nall cardinal numbers nor a set of all ordinal numbers. Thus, the\ninfinity of the cardinals and of the ordinals cannot be measured by a\ncardinal or an ordinal, for otherwise a paradox would ensue. (See also\nentry on\n Russell\u2019s paradox.)\n\nAlthough it took several decades from Cantor\u2019s work to find a\nsystem of axioms for set theory that avoids these paradoxes (see the\nentries on\n the early development of set theory\n and\n set theory),\n Cantor already saw, in this unreachability of the totality of all\nordinals or cardinals, a notion of \u201cabsolute infinity\u201d.\nAlthough in his system, there are many infinite sets that are\ntractable and graspable at many different levels, starting with the\nnatural numbers (which Aristotle had thought was merely potential\nrather than actual), he discovered an even greater Aristotelian\npotential infinity. This led to the distinction between a\n\u201cset\u201d as a totality that can be grasped in the relevant\nsense, and a \u201cproper class\u201d, which is too large even for a\nsystem that encompasses each of Cantor\u2019s many infinities.\n\nWe can define addition for cardinal numbers as the cardinality of a\nset that is the union of two disjoint sets of those cardinalities. We\ncan define multiplication for a pair of cardinal numbers as the\ncardinality of the set of all ordered pairs whose first elements are\ndrawn from a set of the first cardinality and whose second elements\nare drawn from a set of the second cardinality. But it turns out that\nthese operations are relatively trivial once we get beyond the finite\ncardinals\u2014just as we saw that the sum or product of two\ncountable ordinals was still countable, the sum or product of two\ninfinite cardinals is equal to whichever of the two is larger! (At\nleast this operation is commutative.) Thus, one can\u2019t get to\n\\(\\aleph_1\\) from \\(\\aleph_0\\) by means of addition or multiplication\n(as we saw when we considered order types achieved by addition and\nmultiplication).\n\nHowever, cardinal exponentiation is more powerful. It turns out to be\nnatural to define \\(2^\\kappa\\) as the cardinality of the power set of\na set whose cardinality is \\(\\kappa\\). (Greek letters \\(\\kappa\\) and\n\\(\\lambda\\) are traditionally used as variables to represent infinite\ncardinals, with letters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) used for ordinals.)\nIt turns out that the cardinality of the set of real numbers\n(otherwise called the \u201ccontinuum\u201d for its role in\nrepresenting continuous space) is the same as that of the power set of\nthe natural numbers, \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), and Cantor showed that\n\\(2^{\\aleph_0}>\\aleph_0\\). Cantor conjectured that \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\)\nwas in fact equal to \\(\\aleph_1\\), and this conjecture was called the\n\u201cContinuum hypothesis\u201d. (See the entry on\n the continuum hypothesis\n for more on this conjecture and why it hasn\u2019t been\nsettled.)\n\nJust as \\(\\aleph_1\\) is a cardinality that can\u2019t be reached by\nthe operations of ordinal addition, multiplication, or exponentiation,\neven in the limit, one might conjecture that even before one reaches\nthe Cantorian absolute infinity, there are further cardinalities that\ncan still be grasped in some sense, but can\u2019t be reached even by\nthe stronger operation of cardinal exponentiation, even in the limit.\nSuch conjectures have turned out to be surprisingly fruitful for the\nstudy of set theory and mathematical logic generally. (See the entry\non\n large cardinals and determinacy.)\n\nAlthough we have defined addition and multiplication for both ordinals\nand cardinals, their features make it hard to make sense of\nsubtraction or division. First, the non-commutativity of the ordinal\noperations, and the triviality of the cardinal operations, makes it\nhard to define meaningful inverses of these operations. (If it\u2019s\npossible to find an ordinal or cardinal that can be added or\nmultiplied to a first one to get a second one, then it is usually\npossible to find infinitely many that can.) But more importantly, the\nconceptual ideas of counting (whether by order type or by bijection)\ndon\u2019t really allow for negatives or fractions, the way that the\nconceptual ideas of measuring and geometry do (considered in section\n 3.2).\n Counting involves treating each element as discrete and unique, and\nthere is no way for multiple elements to combine to yield nothing (as\nsubtraction requires) or to yield a unit (as division does). However,\nmeasurement (e.g., of distance) involves a sort of structure on the\nthing being measured so that some measurements can be fractions of\nothers, or can point in the opposite direction, which yields\nmeaningful notions of division and subtraction.\n\nThis section has given just an introductory taste of the mathematics\nof ordinal and cardinal numbers\u2014it has come to be called\nCantor\u2019s Paradise. But we have already seen many\ncharacteristic features of these notions of infinity that\ndifferentiate them starkly from those discussed in the previous\nsection. Just as the differences between the natural numbers and the\nreal numbers demonstrate the differences between counting elements of\nsets, and measuring lengths, areas, and so on, the differences between\nCantor\u2019s cardinals and the extended reals further demonstrate\ndifferences between counting and measuring.\n\nFor further discussion of the kind of material presented in this\nsection, see the SEP entries on:\n set theory,\n the early development of set theory, and\n the axiom of choice.\n An excellent introduction to basic set theory is Enderton (1977); an\ninformal but still rigorous introduction is Sheppard (2014); more\nadvanced texts include Devlin (1993), Kunen (1983), and Jech (2006).\nFor the higher reaches, to which we will come back in section\n 4,\n see Kanamori (2003).\n\nSet theory provides a theory of cardinality that implements the idea\nthat \u201csameness of size\u201d upholds the bijection intuition.\nThe recent theory of numerosities, developed by Benci, Di Nasso, and\nForti, by contrast, upholds the part-whole intuition. See the\n\nSupplement on Theories of Numerosities.\n3.4 Infinitesimals and hyperreals\n\nWe have already discussed a notion of \\(+\\infty\\) and of \\(-\\infty\\)\nthat is designed to provide values for real-valued functions to take\nas limits at special points. But the understanding of limits\nthemselves was originally thought to require a notion of\n\u201cinfinitesimally small\u201d distances. While these quantities\nwere considered problematic for several centuries, in recent decades\nsome mathematical entities with their properties have been rigorously\nstudied.\n3.4.1 Newton and Leibniz\n\nAn infinitesimal is a number smaller in absolute magnitude than any\npositive finite number, and yet not zero. Infinitesimals have had a\nchequered history. Early work in the calculus, as we have seen when\npresenting the structure of L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s 1696\ntreatise, was mostly based on a geometrical or kinematic (i.e. based\non motion) understanding of infinitesimals. Here we treat\ninfinitesimals arithmetically, i.e. within the context of the real\nnumber system, while conveying the key features of how the early\nanalysts made use of them. To figure out the slope of the function\n\\(f(x)=x^2\\) precisely at one point, one considered an\n\u201cinfinitesimally small number\u201d \\(\\epsilon\\) and considered\nthe slope of the straight line through \\(f(x)\\) and\n\\(f(x+\\epsilon)\\).\n\n\n\nTo find the slope of a function, one considers the slope of a straight\nline that intersects it at two \u201cinfinitesmally close\u201d\npoints.\n\n\nThis slope is equal to \\(\\frac{(x+\\epsilon)^2-x^2}{\\epsilon}\\). In\norder for this fraction to make sense, \\(\\epsilon\\) must be non-zero.\nHowever, we can calculate that this value is\n\\(\\frac{2x\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon}\\), or \\(2x+\\epsilon\\). At\nthis point, we no longer need \\(\\epsilon\\) to be non-zero, so the\nslope can be said to be just \\(2x\\). This sort of slippage between\nnon-zero and zero for these infinitesimals is what made Berkeley refer\nto them as \u201cthe ghosts of departed quantities\u201d. However,\nengineers, scientists and mathematicians who actually made use of the\ncalculus rested content in the knowledge that the calculus delivered\nthe goods.\n\nIn the 19th century, Cauchy, Bolzano, Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor\nsought to establish foundations for real analysis that gave no role to\ninfinitesimals: in what became the canonical account of the calculus,\nCantorian set theory and the \\(\\epsilon\\)-\\(\\delta\\) formalization of\nthe notion of a limit described in section\n 3.2\n allowed for a fully rigorous development of real analysis.\n\nInstead of taking particular infinitesimal values, one\nquantifies over values of real-valued variables\n\\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\). For example, the claim that the slope of\nthe squaring function at \\(x\\) is \\(2x\\) is interpreted as saying that\nfor any desired degree \\(\\epsilon\\) of approximation,\nthere is some finite \\(\\delta\\) such that for any \\(x'\\)\nwithin \\(\\delta\\) of \\(x\\), the slope of the line from \\((x,x^2)\\) to\n\\((x', x'^2)\\) approximates \\(2x\\) to within \\(\\epsilon\\). A single\ninfinitesimal is replaced by a relation involving two nested\nquantifiers. The process of elimination of infinitesimal quantities\nfrom the calculus was a central part of a larger process known as the\n\u201carithmetization of analysis\u201d, which aimed at removing\nkinematical and geometrical notions from the calculus in favour of\npurely arithmetical notions. (These are broadly construed to include\nthe arithmetic of real and complex numbers. For a recent account of\nthe history of real and complex analysis in the 19th century that also\npays attention to foundational issues see Gray (2015).)\n\nThis infinitesimal-free program accomplished its goals\nsuccessfully\u2014among its major accomplishments were the rigorous\ndefinition of a continuous function at a point and the definition of\nthe Riemann integral. However, one should keep in mind that other\nareas of mathematics, such as geometry, continued exploiting\ninfinitesimal considerations and studied extensively\nnon-Archimedean number systems. Archimedes\u2019 axiom\nstates:\n\n\ngiven any two areas, or two distances, or any two quantities of the\nsame sort, say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), it is possible to add \\(A\\) to itself\nfinitely many times so that the quantity obtained is greater than\n\\(B\\).\n\n\nNon-Archimedean systems are ones in which this axiom does not hold. If\nthe 17th century engagement with infinity, and Cantor\u2019s work in\nset theory, can be seen as revolutions, the study of non-Archimedean\nmathematics in the second half of the 19th century can be likened to\nan infinitary uprising.\n\nMany of the quantities considered in 17th century calculus, such as\nLeibnizian infinitesimals, do not obey the Archimedean axiom. An\ninfinitesimal can be added to itself any finite number of times but\nthe outcome of that process will never be greater than any finite\nquantity, however small. A pervasive historiographical tradition has\nargued that with the elimination of infinitely small quantities from\nthe calculus, non-Archimedean quantities were relegated to engineering\npractice for a long time. According to the standard account, it was\nonly in the 1960s that infinitesimals came back when Abraham Robinson\npresented his theory of non-standard analysis, which has received a\nlot of attention from philosophers and mathematicians (see section\n 3.4.2).\n Robinson\u2019s theory gave a legitimate mathematical status to\ninfinitely small and infinitely large quantities in the reconstruction\nof the infinitesimal calculus, now developed accordingly to rigorous\nmodel-theoretic techniques. For a long time, Robinson\u2019s work was\nhailed as the first successful effort to develop a system of\nnon-Archimedean quantities. But Philip Ehrlich, in a series of\nfundamental papers (including 1994, 2012), has argued that this\nwidespread perception needs serious questioning. Indeed, he has shown\nconvincingly that interest in non-Archimedean mathematics emerged in\nthe 1870s and continued to grow in the hands of mathematicians such as\nVeronese, du Bois-Reymond, Levi-Civita, Hahn, Stolz, Hardy, and\nothers.\n\nIt would be out of place in this entry to attempt even a small survey\nof the developments mentioned above. We simply refer to the reader to\nEhrlich (1994) and (2006). The interconnection with many important\nrelated issues such as Conway\u2019s surreal numbers (see section\n 3.4.3)\n and other alternative approaches to the construction of the real\nnumbers, such as smooth infinitesimal analysis mentioned at the end of\nsection\n 3.4.2,\n cannot be properly addressed here. See Salanskis and Sinaceur (1992),\nEhrlich (1994), Berger, Osswald, and Schuster (2001), and Ehrlich\n(2012).\n3.4.2 Non-standard analysis and infinitesimal analysis\n\nAs a result of the rigorous definitions in the calculus mentioned\nabove, from the mid-19th century most mathematicians working in\nanalysis abandoned infinitesimals. However, in the mid-20th century,\nRobinson (1966) showed that it is possible to give a rigorous\ndefinition of infinitesimals, and that infinitesimals can be used in a\nnon-standard development of real analysis (D. Laugwitz also did\nsimilar work around the same time, but Robinson\u2019s system has\nbeen more widely discussed). While he developed his non-standard\nanalysis using model theory, subsequent developments have also been\ngrounded in algebra and topology. Robinson\u2019s approach supplies\nan extended number system\u2014the hyperreal number\nsystem\u2014that contains the standard real number system, plus\nfurther \u2018infinitesimal\u2019 numbers whose absolute values are\ngreater than 0, but less than any positive standard real number.\nRobinson\u2019s construction of the hyperreals provides a set with\nthe same cardinality as the standard reals. Simple modifications of\nthe construction can create sets of hyperreals of larger\ncardinality.\n\nImportantly, due to the logical techniques used in its construction,\nRobinson\u2019s system behaves exactly like the standard finite real\nnumbers for any sentence expressible within the algebraic language of\naddition and multiplication. Thus, every number other than 0 has a\nmultiplicative inverse, and if \\(x > y\\), then \\(1/y > 1/x\\). In\nparticular, this means that if \\(\\epsilon\\) is a positive\ninfinitesimal number, then \\(1/\\epsilon\\) is an infinitely large\nnumber! Unlike Cantorian infinities of counting from section\n 3.3\n these infinitely large numbers are subject to subtraction and\ndivision as well as addition and multiplication, and unlike the\ninfinities of the extended real line from section\n 3.2,\n they behave just as nicely as the finite numbers with respect to\nthem. For instance, statements such as these hold of standard real\nnumbers as well as of the new infinitely small and infinitely large\nnumbers:\n\n\\(x+y=y+x\\) (commutativity of addition);\n\n\\(x\\cdot y=y\\cdot x\\) (commutativity of multiplication);\n\n\\(x(y+z)=xy+xz\\) (distributivity of multiplication over addition).\n\nIn fact, Robinson\u2019s hyperreals satisfy a \u201ctransfer\nprinciple\u201d\u2014if statements are formulated entirely within a\nfirst-order language for the reals, then they are true of the standard\nreals if and only if they are true for the hyperreals. So any proof of\nsuch a theorem in one system can be transferred to the other. This\nsometimes greatly simplifies calculations and proofs of theorems.\n\nConsider the limit of the quantity \\(((x+h)^3-x^3)/h\\) as \\(h\\)\napproaches 0. In the standard reals, to show that this is \\(3x^2\\), we\nneed to show that for every \\(\\epsilon\\) there is a \\(\\delta\\) such\nthat for any value of \\(h\\) less than \\(\\delta\\), the corresponding\nvalue of this function is less than \\(\\epsilon\\) away from \\(3x^2\\).\nIn this case, it turns out that choosing \\(\\delta < \\epsilon/4x\\)\nworks when \\(x\\) is sufficiently large, and choosing \\(\\delta <\n\\epsilon\\) works when \\(x\\) is sufficiently small, but figuring out\nthese choices is difficult.\n\nFor the hyperreals though, it is sufficient to show that this value is\ninfinitesimally close to \\(3x^2\\) whenever h is infinitesimal.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{(x+h)^3-x^3}{h} &= \\frac{x^3+3x^2h+3xh^2+h^3-x^3}{h} \\\\\n &= 3x^2+3xh+h^2, \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nand for any real \\(x\\), \\(3xh+h^2\\) is infinitesimal whenever \\(h\\) is\ninfinitesimal.) For any particular real \\(\\epsilon\\), this shows that\nthere is some hyperreal \\(\\delta\\) that works (namely, any\ninfinitesimal), and by the transfer principle we can conclude that for\nthis real \\(\\epsilon\\) there is some real \\(\\delta\\) that\nworks, and we no longer need to worry about the details of how to find\nit. Thus, we can validate the reasoning of Newton and Leibniz that\nallows them to treat infinitesimals as non-zero for calculations until\nwe get to the final result, and then treat them as zero at the end.\nThey really work like the \u201cghosts of departed quantities\u201d\nthat Berkeley satirized! (The extent to which Robinson\u2019s system\nis a vindication of Leibniz and Newton was the subject of extended\ndiscussion in articles by Robinson and others. See Bos (1974) for a\nclassic source of this debate.)\n\nFor results stated in a first-order logical language, the hyperreals\nand the standard reals satisfy the transfer principle. But for results\nabout sets, they behave differently. Every bounded set of\nstandard reals has a least upper bound. However, for instance, the set\nof infinitesimal hyperreals is bounded (every member is less than\n.00001, among other bounds), but there is no least upper\nbound (no infinitesimal is an upper bound for all of the others, and\nevery finitely large upper bound can be decreased by some\ninfinitesimal amount to give a smaller one). Edward Nelson (1977)\npioneered an alternative approach\u2014Internal Set Theory\u2014on\nwhich the basic language of mathematics is enriched in order to allow\nus to distinguish between standard and non-standard real numbers, as\nwell as \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d sets. On\nNelson\u2019s approach, infinitesimals are non-standard real numbers\nthat are smaller in absolute value than any positive standard real\nnumbers. \u201cInternal sets\u201d are those that can be defined in\nthe basic language, and they behave just the same as standard sets of\nstandard reals\u2014for instance, bounded internal sets always have a\nleast upper bound. But the set of all infinitesimals, just like the\nset of all standard real numbers, is an \u201cexternal set\u201d of\nthe theory that can\u2019t be defined within the language, and thus\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily have a least upper bound.\n\nThe approaches pioneered by Robinson and Nelson do not allow us to\nprove results about the standard real numbers that cannot be\nproved using standard real analysis. However, these approaches do\nprovide simpler\u2014and, in some sense, more intuitive\u2014proofs\nof many theorems of standard real analysis. (On the pedagogical\nbenefits of non-standard analysis, see, for example, Keisler (1976)).\nAnd there are cases of results in real analysis that were first proven\nusing non-standard real analysis (see, for example, Bernstein and\nRobinson (1966).) Moreover, these approaches clearly show that we do\nnot need to adopt the \\(\\epsilon\\)-\\(\\delta\\) formalization of the\nnotion of a limit in order to have access to a fully rigorous\ndevelopment of real analysis.\n\nThe literature on non-standard analysis is very rich. See Dauben\n(1995) for a biography of Robinson with special emphasis on\nnon-standard analysis. See also Goldblatt (1998) for a recent formal\nintroduction and Cutland, di Nasso, and Ross (2006) for recent\nmathematical developments. The reader is referred to the extensive\nbibliographies contained in those volumes for further references.\n\nAn interesting alternative to nonstandard analysis, which allows for a\ndevelopment of substantive parts of mathematics, goes under the name\nof (smooth) infinitesimal analysis. This differs from both\nordinary and nonstandard analysis by allowing nilpotent\ninfinitesimals, namely \u2018linelets\u2019 \\(dx\\) such that\n\\(dx\\neq 0\\) but \\(dx\\cdot dx = 0\\). The consistency of such a theory\nis proved using toposes in category theory. The best exposition of the\ntopic is Bell (1998b) (see also Bell 1988a, 2019); philosophical\naspects of the theory are discussed in Hellman and Shapiro (2018).\nArthur (2013) discusses infinitesimal analysis in connection to\nLeibniz and makes points similar to those made by Bos (1974) on\nLeibniz and non-standard analysis. Constructive interpretations of\nnon-standard analysis are developed in Salanskis (1999), which\nincludes discussions of Nelson\u2019s approach as well as the French\nschool of non-standard analysis (Reeb, Harthong). For further\ndiscussion of infinitesimals, see Davis (1977), Thomason (1982), Bell\n(2005), and the entry on\n continuity and infinitesimals.\n3.4.3 Surreal numbers\n\nDedekind showed how to fill the gaps between rational\nnumbers; Cantor showed how to extend (ordinal and cardinal) numbers\nbeyond the existing finite numbers. John Conway (1976)\nintegrated both ideas. He developed a very different system that\ngeneralizes von Neumann\u2019s representation of Cantor\u2019s\nordinals, as well as Dedekind\u2019s representation of the real\nnumbers, to generate a much larger field that has become known as the\n\u201csurreal numbers\u201d. It contains a copy of each ordinal and\ncardinal number, while defining operations that work just like\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and\nthe taking of roots, on the standard reals. In particular, even the\ninfinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers are amenable to these\noperations. Thus, as well as familiar numbers, we now have numbers\nsuch as \\(\\sqrt\\omega, \\omega/2, -\\omega, 1/\\omega, -\\omega^\\omega,\\)\nand so on. Indeed, as Ehrlich (2001, 2012) observes, the surreal\nnumbers may plausibly be regarded as including \u201call numbers\ngreat and small\u201d! The surreal numbers can apparently be applied\nin cases where there is no straightforward way to use hyperreals, as\nfor example in the treatment of Pascal\u2019s Wager, discussed in\nsection\n 7.3\u2014see\n H\u00e1jek (2003a).\n\nBecause the field of surreal numbers contains copies of all the\nordinals, it is too big to form a set. But because the operations\nbehave like the operations on the standard reals, these copies of the\nordinals don\u2019t represent counting. See the\n\nSupplement on the Construction of Surreal Numbers\n\n\nfor a summary of Conway\u2019s construction of them. Other\nconstructions of this same structure have been carried out by Knuth\n(1974) and Gonshor (1986) in more introductory texts.\n3.5 Wrapup\n\nLet us take stock. In response to worries that infinities in\nmathematics are suspect (section\n 2),\n rigorous mathematical theories of infinity have been developed (this\nsection). But one might worry that, even if we can talk with\nmathematical rigor about infinities, they do not correspond to or\napply to anything in the real world (as we think finite quantities do,\nhowever they do). Infinities might just be castles in the sky.\nFurthermore, one might suspect that we can, by some further\nmathematical developments, remove any reference to infinities in any\npractically important mathematics. The following section places this\ndialectic in the context of general questions about mathematical\nontology, canvassing some important historical attempts to expunge the\ninfinite from mathematics. It then explains the very\ndifficult\u2014perhaps insurmountable\u2014challenges that any such\nattempt faces.\n4. Mathematical ontology\n\nVarious questions about infinity naturally arise in the course of\ntheorizing about ontology. If mathematical objects exist, are there\ninfinitely many of them? Do individual infinite objects like the ones\nmentioned above exist, in addition to the infinitely many individual\nfinite numbers? This article will not directly discuss the question of\nwhether and in what sense mathematical objects exist. Instead, we will\nfocus on the question of whether the infinities discussed above exist\nin the same sense as the finite integers. For more on the general\nquestions of mathematical existence, see the entries on:\n logic and ontology,\n philosophy of mathematics,\n platonism in the philosophy of mathematics,\n nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics,\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics,\n naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics, and\n logicism and neologicism.\n\nMost viewpoints in the philosophy of mathematics accept the existence\nof all of the finite and infinite objects mentioned so far in exactly\nthe same way that they accept the existence of finite integers.\n(Platonists might accept that this is literal existence, while\nfictionalists accept this as some sort of fictional existence, and\nothers might have a different idea of what this means.) Standard set\ntheories can prove the existence of all these objects, and for most\nmathematicians and philosophers, this is all that is needed. Logicist\nand neologicist accounts of mathematics may obtain the existence of\ninfinite sets or infinitely many numbers by explicit postulation (as\nin the case of the axiom of infinity in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s\nPrincipia Mathematica) or as the outcome of an implicit\npostulation (such as Hume\u2019s Principle in Scottish neologicism,\nsee Hale and Wright 2001, Heck 1997, 2011). While the axiom of\ninfinity is easily stated and understood, Hume\u2019s Principle has a\npeculiar form, for it postulates the existence of a function \\(\\#\\)\nthat sends concepts into objects while respecting an equivalence\nrelation \\(\\approx\\) among concepts. Formally it is stated as\nfollows: \n\\[\\tag{HP} \\forall B\\forall C\\, \\# B = \\# C \\text{ iff } B \\approx C \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(B \\approx C\\) is short-hand for one of the many equivalent\nformulas of pure second order logic expressing the equivalence\nrelation \u201cthere is a one to one correlation between the objects\nfalling under \\(B\\) and those falling under \\(C\\)\u201d. Informally,\nit can be read as saying that two concepts \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) have the\nsame \u2018number\u2019 if and only if there is a one to one\ncorrespondence among the objects that fall under \\(B\\) and those that\nfall under \\(C\\). Principles like HP that define a function from an\nequivalence relation are called abstraction principles. By\npresupposing the existence of a function that sends concepts into\nobjects, Hume\u2019s Principle exploits the possibility of defining\ninfinitely many concepts that do not stand in the equivalence relation\nmentioned in its right-hand side to generate infinitely many natural\nnumbers. There are other varieties of neologicism that do not\npostulate Hume\u2019s Principle or an axiom of infinity at the outset\nbut yield infinitely many natural numbers by means of other logical\nprinciples (see for instance Linsky and Zalta 2006). In addition, all\nthese varieties of neologicism generate at least an infinite cardinal\nnumbers and what is of philosophical relevance here is the different\nresources they use to establish these results.\n\nIncidentally, Frege\u2019s logicism and the neologicist program use\none-to-one correspondence to state identity criteria for\n\u201cconcepts\u201d even when infinitely many objects fall under\nthe concepts. For alternative criteria for assigning numbers to\ninfinite concepts see Mancosu (2015) and (2016).\n\nIn light of the paradoxes for early set theories (Russell\u2019s\nparadox, the Burali-Forti paradox, and others), some mathematicians\nand philosophers worried that standard set theory might be\ninconsistent as well. One alternative viewpoint on mathematics is\nintuitionism, which only accepts the existence of\nmathematical objects whose construction can be carried out in some\nsense by the human mind. Intuitionism requires a revision of logic,\nsince this limitation invalidates the Law of Excluded\nMiddle\u2014there are cases in which we can prove that the\nnon-existence of a certain type of object would lead to a\ncontradiction, but don\u2019t have any method of constructing such an\nobject, so that there might be a truth-value gap. Intuitionists often\naccept the Aristotelian limitation to \u201cpotential\ninfinities\u201d, rather than \u201cactual infinities\u201d, but\nthere is also sophisticated intuitionistic reasoning about what types\nof infinite entities might exist. (For more, see the entries on\n intuitionistic logic\n and\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nAnother viewpoint, associated with David Hilbert, is called\nfinitism (see Hilbert 1926). Most finitists accept classical\nlogic, but worry about the consistency of theories of infinite\nobjects. Hilbert\u2019s worries about consistency were fueled by the\nparadoxes that the new infinitary set-theoretic mathematics was giving\nrise to (Cantor\u2019s inconsistent sets; Burali-Forti Paradox;\nRussell\u2019s paradox etc.) Hilbert was convinced that\nquantification over such infinite totalities was at the root of the\ntroubles. Finite objects, like configurations of strokes corresponding\nto the natural numbers, and finite sentences of a formal language, are\ntaken by the Hilbertian finitist to be unproblematic, since these\nobjects can in some sense be grasped individually and thus in their\n(potential) totality. But infinite objects are taken to be\nproblematic: this includes Cantor\u2019s higher ordinals and\ncardinals, and all the geometric, algebraic, and topological objects\nof which mathematicians were starting to develop detailed theories at\nthe turn of the 20th century.\n\nHilbert\u2019s proposed project (sometimes taken to be the starting\npoint for formalism in the philosophy of mathematics) was to\nreplace talk of these infinitary entities themselves with talk of the\nfinitely long sentences that we ordinarily interpret as being about\nthe entities. His goal was to axiomatize the theories of these\ninfinite objects, and then to prove, using finitary means of syntactic\nreasoning about the language, that these theories are consistent.\nWhile this idea doesn\u2019t deny the existence of the\ninfinite objects, it suggests a methodological approach of only\nliterally accepting the finitary objects, whether strokes standing for\nthe integers or sentences. (See the entry on\n Hilbert\u2019s program.)\n\nSome mathematicians and philosophers have adopted finitism not merely\nas a methodological viewpoint, but also as a metaphysical one. Finite\nobjects, like numbers and sentences, exist (in whatever sense\nmathematical objects exist), but infinite objects (like the completed\nset of all the natural numbers, or even arbitrary irrational numbers\nrepresented by Dedekind cuts) don\u2019t. Versions of this view are\noften attributed to the 19th century number theorist and algebraist,\nLeopold Kronecker, who is quoted as saying \u201cThe dear God created\nthe whole numbers; everything else is the work of man.\u201d\nKronecker criticized Cantor\u2019s work as theology rather than\nmathematics. Hilbert started his program with the intent of defending\nCantor while working within a framework dialectically acceptable to\nKronecker\u2019s allies. But when Kurt G\u00f6del proved that no\nfinitary theory for arithmetic and syntax can even prove its\nown consistency, let alone prove the consistency of a\nstronger theory for talking about completed infinities,\nHilbert\u2019s program was taken to have failed at disabusing the\nmetaphysical finitists. G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems\napply most notably to Peano Arithmetic. The language of Peano\nArithmetic is given by \\(\\{0,\\,',\\, +,\\,\\times\\}\\), where '\nis the successor function (it adds 1 to each number).\nWithin it one can express ordinary arithmetical claims such as the\ncommutativity of addition and the infinitude of prime numbers. The\naxioms of Peano Arithmetic tell us that the function '\nis one-one; that 0 is not the successor of any\nnumber; that \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) satisfy the usual recursive\ndefinitions; and finally we have a schema of induction for every\nformula \\(A(x)\\) expressible in the language, i.e. if \\(A(0)\\) and for\nall \\(x, A(x) \\rightarrow A(x')\\), then for all \\(x, A(x)\\).\n\nThe detailed foundational work carried out in set theory and other\nfoundational areas has in many ways dispelled the fear of impending\ndoom that characterized the reaction to the paradoxes at the beginning\nof the twentieth century. As a consequence, most mathematicians today\nare perfectly happy to work with completed infinities. But there are\nstill some finitists and intuitionists.\n\nAn intermediate position is that defended by classical\n\u201cpredicativists\u201d such as Poincar\u00e9 and Weyl. The\ntheory, presented in a satisfactory logical way by Feferman and\nothers, accepts the excluded middle on the natural numbers (and as\nsuch it is arguably committed to the existence of the set of natural\nnumbers and in any case to accepting bivalence on the natural numbers)\nbut does not accept the existence of the power set of the natural\nnumbers. According to predicativism (see Feferman 2005), sets\nexist only if they are definable in some non-circular linguistic way.\nIn accepting the excluded middle on the natural numbers and in making\nthe existence of sets depend on our definitional abilities, this\nposition is a sort of a compromise between a classical and a\nconstructive viewpoint. In 1918, Hermann Weyl (Weyl 1918; see Kaufmann\n1930 for a related program) presented the foundations of analysis\nwithin this framework and showed that a great part of classical\nanalysis can be carried out within the framework by replacing talk of\narbitrary sets of real numbers with arithmetical sequences of real\nnumbers. Feferman 1988 gave a detailed formal presentation of the\ntheory and proved that, on a certain reconstruction, the theory is a\nconservative extension of Peano Arithmetic. In addition, he also used\nthe theory to state an important conjecture concerning how much\nmathematics is needed in physics. In Feferman 1984 and 1987, he\nproposed that all of mathematics used in physical theory can be\nrecaptured in a predicative system of analysis. Using the\nmetatheoretical result of conservativity mentioned above, he also\nexploited the argument to claim that Quine and Putnam\u2019s\nindispensability arguments (see the entry on\n indispensability arguments in philosophy of mathematics)\n at best commit us to what Peano Arithmetic commits us to.\n\nIn contrast to the possibility of eliminating infinity as just\ndescribed stand a number of results that show that some finitary\nstatements can only be proved through infinitary considerations. These\nresults originally emerge with G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems (G\u00f6del 1931) but have been recently refined by\ndisplaying statements of mathematical interest (whereas\nG\u00f6del\u2019s statements are of metamathematical interest but\nhave no obvious mathematical interest). In order to understand the\nconceptual distinctions required, let us grant \u2014as most\nlogicians do\u2014that all finitistic modes of reasoning are included\nin first-order Peano Arithmetic (henceforth PA).\n\nA consequence of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems is that\nunder the assumption that PA is consistent one can find a finitistic\nstatement such that neither it nor its negation is provable from Peano\nArithmetic. G\u00f6del showed, through subtle coding of\nmetamathematical notions in the language of arithmetic, how to express\nin the language of arithmetic a formula \\(G\\) that \u201csays\u201d\nof itself that it is not provable. One can also ascertain that the\nformula is true on the natural numbers. Since all the finitary\nreasoning is assumed to be included in PA, establishing the truth of\nthe G\u00f6del sentence and of the new incompleteness results requires\nappeal to some \u201cinfinitary\u201d principles (when the truth of\nthe G\u00f6del sentence \\(G\\) is established through appeal to the\nstatement expressing the consistency of PA, it is establishing the\nlatter that requires some portion of infinitary reasoning, such as\ninduction up to an infinite ordinal called \\(\\varepsilon_0)\\).\n\nThe situation is the same for the statement Con(PA) expressing the\nconsistency of PA. G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem\nshows that neither it nor its negation can be proved from PA but an\nappeal to some infinitary reasoning shows it to hold in the natural\nnumbers. While perfectly fine for the logician\u2019s need and\ncentral to the evaluation of Hilbert\u2019s program,\nG\u00f6del\u2019s sentences appear concocted from the point of view\nof the practicing mathematician. Within Hilbert\u2019s program\nstatements of PA expressible either without quantifiers or with a\nstring of universal quantifiers followed by a non-quantificational\nformula count as finitistic statements. The statements \\(G\\) and\nCon(PA) mentioned above also belong to this class. Finitistic\nstatements with obvious mathematical relevance include basic\nproperties such as the commutativity of addition as well as the\nstatement of Fermat\u2019s last theorem (whose proof has been\nestablished using higher mathematics but logicians are convinced that\nit can also be carried out in PA). Logicians have not been able to\nfind finitistic statements with obvious mathematical significance that\nrequire a detour through the infinite, but they have been able to do\nthe next best thing. They have found statements that have the form\n\\((\\forall x) (\\exists y) A(x, y),\\) which express a certain\nfunctional connection between numbers and have shown that such\nstatements, although true, cannot be proved using only the resources\nof PA. Among the most famous such results are a modification of\nRamsey\u2019s finite theorem provided by Paris and Harrington (1977),\nand the proof that a theorem by Goodstein (1944) cannot be proved in\nPA (Kirby and Paris 1982). There are stronger results that are\nindependent of even stronger systems that are studied within the\ncontext of reverse mathematics (e.g., Kruskal\u2019s theorem is\nindependent of predicative analysis\u2014see Simpson 1985, 2002).\n\nSuch results show that even an arithmetical theory such as PA can\nexpress statements of mathematical significance (as opposed to\nstatements concocted for logical purposes) that require some detour\nthrough the infinite to be proved, even though they can be stated\npurely arithmetically. In contrast to arithmetic, the mathematical\nincompleteness of set theory was shown by G\u00f6del and Cohen for\nimportant statements such as the Axiom of Choice, the continuum\nhypothesis, etc. It is important to emphasize here that logicians\nworking in set theory, recursion theory and proof theory probe the\nmysterious role of the infinite in proving results about the finite.\nIt could be said that set theorists are mainly concerned with\nunderstanding how the demonstrable mathematical incompletability of\nZermelo-Fraenkel (with Choice, i.e. ZFC) set theory, which is a\nconsequence of results by G\u00f6del and Cohen, can be addressed by\nfinding new principles that will allow us to solve some of the most\npressing questions concerned with the structure of the real numbers.\nIn other words, since ZFC cannot be taken as a sufficient basis for\nthe mathematics of infinity much of contemporary set theory is trying\nto solve the problem by finding new principles, which often take the\nform of assuming the existence of very large cardinals (see the entry\non\n independence and large cardinals).\n The hope is that this work will lead to settling the Continuum\nHypothesis and other major problems about the projective sets (on\nprojective sets see entry on\n set theory).\n\nRecursion theorists are also trying to understand the role that\ninfinitary principles or compactness arguments play in our\ndetermination of results about the finite. And proof theorists would\nlike to know when certain infinitistic theories can be justified\nthrough finitary means. Obviously, a more precise description of these\ndevelopments goes well beyond the technical knowledge that we can\npresuppose here.\n\nMost working mathematicians don\u2019t worry about the existence of\ninfinitely large sets and other objects. There are some other\nontological worries about particular infinite sets, related to the\nAxiom of Choice, and some of the larger cardinalities mentioned above\nin the section on Cantor. But bigger worries arise in the context of\nwhether there can be physical infinities.\n\nFor collections of sources on the classical foundational positions\n(finitism, intuitionism, predicativism) see van Heijenoort (1967),\nEwald (1996), and Mancosu (1998).

Paradoxes and puzzles involving infinity\n\nThe latter part of this entry will explore selected applications of\nmathematical concepts of infinity in theories of probability,\ndecision, and spacetime, and some associated paradoxes. Before we turn\nto those theories, we warm up with some paradoxes and puzzles that\nlink mathematics, metaphysical possibility, and physical possibility.\nThere are many different paradoxes and puzzles that we might have\nincluded in this section. We consider a small sample of paradoxes and\npuzzles that some\u2014e.g. Pruss (2018a)\u2014have thought might\nmotivate a return to Aristotle\u2019s views on the impossibility of\nactual infinites.\n\nIn the\n\nSupplement on al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s objection,\n\nwe discuss a puzzle due to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b that is of historical\ninterest. For more see, for example, Rucker (1982), Moore (1990/2019),\nOppy (2006), and Huemer (2016).\n5.1 Hilbert\u2019s Hotel\n\nHilbert\u2019s Hotel has infinitely many rooms, labelled 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, each of which is currently occupied by a guest. Despite the\nfact that the hotel is already full, a new guest who turns up at\nreception is readily accommodated: for each n, the guest in room \\(n\\)\nis moved to room \\(n+1\\), and the new guest is installed in room 1.\nIndeed, despite the fact that the hotel is already full, it can\naccommodate infinitely many new guests: for each \\(n\\), the guest in\nroom \\(n\\) is moved to room \\(2n\\), and the new guests are installed\nin the odd-numbered rooms. Of course, if the infinitely many people in\nthe odd-numbered rooms check out, there are infinitely many people\nleft in Hilbert\u2019s Hotel; but if infinitely many people check out\nfrom all but the first three rooms, only three people remain.\n\nSome philosophers have thought that Hilbert\u2019s Hotel supports an\nargument against the possibility of physically realized\ninfinities:\n\nIf there could be physically realized infinities, then there could\nbe a hotel with infinitely many rooms.\nBut if there could be a hotel with infinitely many rooms, then the\nevents described in the preceding paragraph could occur.\nBut it is absurd to suppose that the events described in the\npreceding paragraph could occur.\n\n\nSo there cannot be physically realized infinities. (See, e.g., Craig\n(1979).)\n\nThis argument faces various challenges, depending on one\u2019s views\nabout what physical possibility amounts to. The first premise may be\nchallenged: perhaps some kinds of physical infinities can be realized\neven though other kinds of physical infinities cannot: for example,\nperhaps there can be infinitely many stars even though there cannot be\na hotel with infinitely many rooms. The second premise may also be\nchallenged: even if there could be a hotel with infinitely many rooms,\nperhaps the events described in the story could not occur\u2014the\nstory was told at a high level of abstraction, and the details may\nmatter. And the third premise is also questionable: it is not clearly\nabsurd to suppose that there could be an infinite hotel in which\nguests come and go in the manner described.\n\nFor further discussion of Hilbert\u2019s Hotel, see Gamow (1946),\nHuby (1971), Rucker (1982), Moore (1990/2019), Oppy (2006), Kragh\n(2014), Huemer (2016), and the entries on\n supertasks\n and\n cosmology and theology.\n5.2 Thomson\u2019s Lamp\n\nSuppose that we have a lamp and a means of turning the lamp off and\non. Suppose that the lamp is initially off. In the first minute, we\nchange the state of the lamp from off to on. In the next half minute,\nwe change the state of the lamp from on to off. \u2026 In the next\n\\(1/2^n\\) minute we change the state of the lamp to the other state\n\u2026 . The question that we are invited to answer is: what is the\nstate of the lamp at the end of the second minute?\n\nThe scenario is under-described. We can imagine that the means of\nturning the lamp off and on requires a spacetime location at which at\nleast one physical quantity is infinite. If so, it is plausible to say\nthat the case is impossible: there could not be such a lamp, and so\nthere is no question to answer. Suppose, for example, that there is a\nswitch that moves the same distance back and forth to turn the lamp on\nand off. Consider the speed at which the tip of the switch is\ntravelling at the end of the second minute.\n\nWe can also imagine that the means of turning the lamp off and on does\nnot involve any spacetime location at which at least one physical\nquantity is infinite; Gr\u00fcnbaum (1968) describes a scenario that\nfits this specification. In that case, the means of turning the lamp\noff and on converges to a specified state at the end of the two\nminutes, and there is an answer to the question that lies in the\ndetails of the specified state. But that answer is underdetermined by\nthe brief description that we were initially given, as Benacerraf\n(1962) argues: we can have the lamp on at the end of the two minutes,\nor off at the end of the two minutes, depending upon the details of\nthe implementation of Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s proposal. Huemer (2016:\n198\u2013201) points out that if we hold fixed enough physics, then,\nbefore the end of the two minutes, the activation of the mechanism\nwill stop changing the state of the lamp. So, depending upon your\nviews about the range of what is possible, you may regard as\nimpossible even cases in which there is no spacetime location at which\nat least one physical quantity is infinite.\n\nThomson\u2019s lamp is an example of a supertask (Thomson\ncoined this term): a process that involves infinitely many steps\ncompleted in a finite amount of time. The trick is that the steps are\ncompleted in shorter and shorter periods of time, corresponding to a\nconvergent series. The lamp is one of many examples of supertasks that\nvarious authors have found paradoxical, while other authors have been\nless troubled by them. See the entry on\n supertasks.\n\nFor further discussion of Thomson\u2019s lamp, see: Thomson (1954,\n1967), Benacerraf (1962), Chihara (1965), Gr\u00fcnbaum (1968, 1973),\nCraig (1979), Berresford (1981), Moore (1990/2019), Earman and Norton\n(1996), McLaughlin (1998), Oppy (2006), Huemer (2016), and Pruss\n(2018a).\n5.3 Paralysis\n\nSuppose that Achilles wants to run from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) but there are\ninfinitely many gods who\u2014unbeknownst to one another and to\nAchilles\u2014each have reason to stop him from getting to \\(B\\). God\n1 resolves to instantaneously paralyse Achilles if and when he reaches\nhalfway between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). God 2 resolves to instantaneously\nparalyse Achilles if and when he reaches one quarter of the way from\n\\(A\\) to \\(B\\). \u2026 God \\(n\\) resolves to instantaneously\nparalyse Achilles if and when he reaches \\(1/2^n\\) of the way from\n\\(A\\) to \\(B\\). \u2026 Since all of the Gods are able to act on\ntheir resolve, Achilles is unable to move: for, if he moved, he would\nviolate the intentions of infinitely many Gods. But, until he does\nmove, none of the Gods act on their intentions. So what actually stops\nhim from moving? Isn\u2019t it absurd to suppose that someone can be\nrendered immobile by a nested sequence of conditional intentions upon\nwhich no one acts?\n\nSuppose instead that each of the Gods erects a force field, placed in\na parallel manner to the previous case, that it is impossible for\nAchilles to cross. Then Achilles is completely immobilized. On the\nassumption that it is possible for an infinite number of Gods to\ncollectively create such a force field in the manner described, there\nis a straightforward explanation for Achilles\u2019 inability to\nmove. Of course, granted this assumption, there is no single God whose\nforce field immobilizes Achilles; indeed, there is no finite\ncollection of Gods whose collective force field does so; indeed, no\nforce field touches him at all. Is this possible? Presumably one\nshould come to the same verdict regarding the conditional intentions\ncase as in this case.\n\nDepending on your views about the range of possibility, there is much\nin this story that you may think is impossible. You may think that it\nis impossible for there to be Gods who can act as required; for\nexample, depending on your conception of the Gods and their actions,\nyou might think that the story requires instantaneous action at a\ndistance. You may think that it is impossible for force fields to be\npositioned with unbounded degrees of accuracy. And so on. However, if\nthere is nothing in the set-up that makes you baulk, and if further\nelaboration of the set-up does not introduce any singularities, then\nit seems that you should just accept the conclusions with equanimity:\nAchilles is rendered immobile by conditional intentions on which no\none acts, or by a set of force fields none of which he is in direct\ncontact with. Bizarrely counterfactual circumstances have bizarre\nconsequences.\n\nFor further discussion of this case, see: Benardete (1964, which\nintroduces it), Moore (1990/2019), Priest (1999), Hawthorne (2000),\nPerez-Laraudogoitia (2000, 2003), Yablo (2000), Oppy (2006), Koons\n(2014), and Huemer (2016), Caie (2018).\n\nWe have started to see that infinity seems to be both friend and\nfoe\u2014it features in powerful mathematics, but also in some vexing\nconundrums. We will see more of its Manichean nature in the following\nsections on probability, decision theory, and space and time. We will\nalso see how sophisticated methods for reclaiming it have been\ndeveloped.\n6. Probability\n\nProbability theory runs relatively smoothly in the finite realm, but\npuzzles emerge when infinities are afoot. There are multiple sources\nof infinitude, arising both in the mathematics and the interpretation\nof probability. We will firstly discuss more informally these sources,\nand then progress to more advanced issues.\n6.1 Infinitude in the mathematics of probability: basics\n\nLet us begin with the mathematics. Probability theory assumes that we\nhave a set of \u201cpossibilities\u201d or \u201coutcomes\u201d,\ncalled a sample space, regarded as ways the world could be,\nor the possible outcomes of a random experiment. For many purposes, an\ninfinite set is assumed. For example, we may toss a coin repeatedly\nand be interested in how many tosses it takes until we see the first\nheads. The number could be 1, or 2, or 3, or \u2026 Here, the sample\nspace is denumerable. Or we might consider picking a point at random\nfrom the [0, 1] interval of the real line\u2014e.g., we might imagine\nthrowing an idealized dart at a representation of that interval, and\nconsider the point on which it lands. Here, the sample space is\nuncountable, because it is infinitely divisible and has limits of\nsequences, but bounded. Or we might consider sampling a quantity that\nis governed by a normal distribution, the bell-shaped distribution\nthat is used to model various quantities in the real world. Here,\ninfinitude enters twice over: the sample space is both uncountable and\nunbounded, being the entire real line.\n\nOrthodox probability theory assigns real numbers between 0\nand 1 (inclusive) to subsets of the sample space, and again we\nencounter infinitude: there are uncountably many possible probability\nvalues. We will soon see how we encounter it again in the way that\nthese values are additive.\n6.2 Infinitude in the interpretations of probability\n\nInfinitary considerations also enter into certain\ninterpretations of probability\u2014attempts to explain what\nprobabilities are and what probability statements mean. (See the entry\non\n interpretations of probability\n for more details on what follows.) Hypothetical frequentism\nregards probabilities as limiting relative frequencies in hypothetical\ninfinite sequences of trials. For example, we may toss a coin\nrepeatedly, generating a sequence of outcomes\u2014e.g.\n\nheads, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, heads, \u2026\n\nWe can keep track after each trial of the relative frequency of heads\nso far: the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of\ntosses. In our example, the sequence of relative frequencies is\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{3}{6}, \\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{4}{8}, \\ldots \\]\n\n\nWe may then imagine this sequence extended indefinitely, and identify\nthe probability of heads with the limit of this sequence. However, the\nvery same results may be reordered, one way or another, to generate\nany limiting relative frequency in [0, 1] whatsoever, if there are\ninfinitely many heads and infinitely many tails. Infinitude rears its\nugly head here\u2014for a finite sequence, reordering can make no\ndifference to the relative frequencies of its outcomes.\n\nAccording to Popper\u2019s propensity interpretation, a\nprobability \\(p\\) of an outcome of a certain type is a propensity of a\nrepeatable experiment to produce outcomes of that type with limiting\nrelative frequency \\(p\\). Again, infinitude is central to this\ninterpretation, and its ugly head rears as it did for hypothetical\nfrequentism. The best-system interpretation of probability,\nassociated with Lewis (1994) and others, is also prey to problems if\nthere are infinitely many events of a particular kind in the\nuniverse\u2014for example, infinitely many coin tosses. As Elga\n(2004) shows, the interpretation\u2019s central notion of\nfit is compromised. And even the subjective probabilities of\nidealized rational agents have tacit infinitary assumptions underlying\nthem\u2014for example, that the agents are logically omniscient, and\ntheir probability assignments are infinitely sharp (single real\nnumbers). These assumptions have also been regarded as problematic,\nespecially when modeling agents who are anything like us.\n6.3 Infinitude in the mathematics of probability: more advanced issues\n\nTo state some of the thornier puzzles generated by the mathematics of\nprobability, we need a more formal presentation. Kolmogorov\u2019s\n(1933/1950) axiomatization begins with a finite set \\(\\Omega\\) and an\nalgebra \\(F\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\): a set closed under\ncomplementation and union. The members of \\(\\Omega\\) are known as\nstates while the members of \\(F\\) are known as\nevents. A probability function is a function from \\(F\\) to\nthe real numbers. It is non-negative, assigns 1 to \\(\\Omega\\), and it\nis (finitely) additive\u2014the probability that one of two mutually\nexclusive events occurs is the sum of their individual\nprobabilities:\n\nFinite additivity\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint sets in \\(F\\), then \\(P(A \\cup B) =\nP(A) + P(B)\\).\n\nKolmogorov goes on to generalize this to an infinite\n\\(\\Omega\\), and to a sigma-algebra \\(F\\) of subsets of\n\\(\\Omega\\): a set closed under complementation and countable\nunion. Additivity is strengthened to hold also in infinite cases:\n\nCountable additivity\n\nIf \\(\\{A_i\\}\\) is a countably infinite collection of (pairwise)\ndisjoint sets, each in \\(F\\), then \n\\[ P(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) \\]\n\n\nSome have felt that restricting additivity to merely countable sums is\narbitrary, and is merely an artifact of the summation technique\nintroduced in section\n 3.2.\n An alternate technique for summing infinite sets of non-negative\nnumbers takes advantage of the fact that a sum of nonnegative numbers\nas defined earlier doesn\u2019t depend on the order of the terms. We\nconsider the set of all partial sums of arbitrary finite subsets of\nthe set, and take the least upper bound of this set to represent the\nsum of the set as a whole. If this sum is some positive finite value\n\\(k\\), then we can see that at most \\(nk\\) of the terms in the set\nbeing summed can be greater than 1/\\(n\\). Since every positive real\nnumber is greater than 1/\\(n\\) for some \\(n\\), this means that the set\nof positive elements of the set is a countable union of finite sets,\nand thus must be countable. That is, if a set being summed in this way\nhas uncountably many non-zero elements, the sum must be infinite.\n\nSo if we require full (unrestricted) additivity, rather than merely\ncountable additivity, then we can see that at most countably many\nevents have positive probability, and their probabilities sum to 1. A\nprobability distribution with these features, where events of\nprobability 0 have been removed, is known as a discrete\ndistribution (such as the Poisson, geometric, or negative binomial\ndistributions). For such a distribution, the probabilities of the\nindividual states determine the probabilities of all events through\nthe use of additivity.\n\nHowever, many applications of probability require what are known as\ncontinuous distributions (such as the uniform/rectangular,\nnormal, and beta distributions), and thus require a restriction to\ncountable additivity. In a continuous distribution, there are\nuncountably many states, usually named by real numbers. Each\nindividual state has probability 0, even though events containing\nuncountably many states often have non-zero probability. (This\nviolates full additivity.) However, in the common continuous\ndistributions, there is usually a way to define a probability density\nfor each state, such that the probability of any event is the integral\nof the density over the states that make it up. In finite and discrete\ndistributions, it is standard to treat events of probability 0 as if\nthey do not happen, while in continuous distributions there is always\nsome event of probability 0 that occurs.\n\nFor finite and discrete distributions, there is a straightforward\ndefinition of a concept of conditional probability. For any two events\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the probability of \\(A\\) conditional on \\(B\\),\nnotated as \\(P(A\\mid B)\\), is defined as \\(P(A \\amp B)/P(B)\\), if the\nprobability of B is non-zero, and undefined otherwise. For any fixed\n\\(B\\), the function \\(P(\\_ \\mid B)\\) is another probability function\non the same space. We can prove the Law of Total Probability. If\n\\(B_1, B_2, B_3,\\ldots\\) form a partition (that is, every outcome is\nin exactly one of the \\(B_i)\\) then: \n\\[ P(A) = \\sum_i P(B_i)P(A \\mid B_i). \\]\n\n\nThis tells us that the unconditional probability \\(P(A)\\) is a\nweighted average of the conditional probabilities \\(P(A\\mid\nB_i)\\).\n\nHowever, for distributions that are not discrete, so that the set of\nstates is uncountable in an essential way, and events of probability 0\noften occur, we can\u2019t use this ratio definition of conditional\nprobability, since it would involve dividing by 0. However, Kolmogorov\nnotes (1933/1950, Ch. 5) that for any suitably nice partition, it is\nstill possible to come up with a definition of conditional probability\nconditional on events in this partition, satisfying a generalization\nof the Law of Total Probability, replacing the sum with an\nintegral: \n\\[ P(A) = \\int P(A \\mid B)dP(B) \\]\n\n\n(The possibility of finding a conditional probability satisfying this\nintegral formula is known as \u2018disintegrability\u2019, and it is\nequivalent to a principle known as \u201cconglomerability\u201d. For\nphilosophical arguments in favor of this, see Easwaran (2013b, 2019),\nRescorla (2018).) For more on determining when conditional\nprobabilities that satisfy this rule exist, see\nHoffmann-J\u00f8rgensen (1971), and for more on how to use\nprobability densities to calculate these conditional probabilities,\nsee Chang and Pollard (1997).\n\nHowever, there are some difficulties with this account of conditional\nprobability. Kolmogorov notes that if the original probability space\nis the uniform distribution of points on a sphere, and if \\(B\\) ranges\nover the set of longitudes (great circles through the poles), then\nprobability conditional on a line of longitude will not be uniform,\nbut instead will be concentrated near the equator. (This fact is known\nas the \u201cBorel paradox\u201d, because Emile Borel investigated\nit even before Kolmogorov\u2019s work.) Since every great circle on a\nsphere can be viewed as a line of longitude with an appropriate choice\nof pole, this makes the probability conditional on an event depend not\nonly on which event was chosen, but also which family of alternatives\nit is contrasted with. (We can view each great circle as a\nlongitudinal line through multiple different poles, each of which\ndisagrees about where the equator is.)\n\nSome have found this consequence troubling enough that they have\nendorsed an alternative account of conditional probability that gives\nup the Law of Total Probability, and instead insists that \\(P(A|B)\\)\nhas a unique value regardless of which alternatives to \\(B\\) are under\nconsideration. However, this also has some unpalatable consequences.\nSince \\(P(A)\\) is no longer the average of \\(P(A|B)\\) where \\(B\\)\nranges over the elements of a partition, this means that there are\nsome partitions such that every element of the partition is positively\ncorrelated with \\(A\\). Furthermore, the conditional probability\nfunctions generated in this way no longer satisfy countable additivity\n(Kadane, Schervish, and Seidenfeld 1996, Seidenfeld, Schervish, and\nKadane 2001, 2013).\n\nBut some, starting with de Finetti (1937, 1972, 1974) have argued on\nother grounds that we should give up even countable additivity and\nonly accept finite additivity, with a correspondingly broader class of\nprobability distributions. One of de Finetti\u2019s chief arguments\ninvolves an infinite lottery with each natural number appearing on\nexactly one ticket. We would like to assign each ticket the same\nprobability of being drawn. Under countable additivity, this is not\npossible. For if we assign probability 0 to each number\u2019s being\npicked, then the sum of all these probabilities is again 0; yet the\nunion of all of these events has probability 1 (since it is guaranteed\nthat some number will be picked), and \\(1 \\ne 0\\). On the other hand,\nif we assign some (real-valued) probability \\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\) to\neach number being picked, then the sum of these probabilities diverges\nto \\(\\infty\\), and \\(1 \\ne \\infty\\). If we drop countable additivity,\nhowever, then we may assign 0 to each event and 1 to their union\nwithout contradiction. In the\n\nSupplement on God\u2019s Lottery,\n\n\nwe explore how an alternative approach to Kolmogorov\u2019s, a\nnon-Archimedean probability theory (NAP), can account for de\nFinetti\u2019s lottery by assigning an infinitesimal probability to\neach ticket.\n\nHowever, a probability function that satisfies finite additivity\nwithout satisfying countable additivity is mathematically much more\ncomplicated than one that satisfies countable additivity. To even\nprove the existence of such a function over the algebra of subsets of\na countable set of states requires the Axiom of Choice. With countable\nadditivity, it is possible to specify a discrete probability function\nby enumerating the probabilities of the countably many states, and it\nis possible to specify a continuous probability function by\nenumerating the probabilities of the countably many rational open\nsets. But if merely finite additivity is assumed, specifying a\nprobability function even on a countable state space may require\nspecifying the probabilities of uncountably many events, rather than\ncalculating the probabilities of these events from the countably many\nprobabilities of the states. Furthermore, with such probability\nfunctions, many standard convergence results like the Strong Law of\nLarge Numbers fail.\n\nFor more on infinite probability spaces where only finitely additive\nprobability holds, see Bartha (2004), Bingham (2010), de Finetti\n(1937/1989), Dubins (1975), Easwaran (2013b), Hill and Lane (1985),\nHowson (2008), Kadane, Schervish, and Seidenfeld (1986), Schervish,\nSeidenfeld, and Kadane (1984), Seidenfeld (2001), Seidenfeld,\nSchervish, and Kadane, (2014).\n\nA lively debate concerns a further constraint on probabilities that\nmay be regarded as desirable: anything that is possible should be\nassigned positive probability. This is known as\nregularity:\n\nRegularity\n\nIf \\(X\\) is a non-empty subset of \\(\\Omega\\), then \\(P(X) \\gt 0\\).\n\nFolk thinking about probability seems to be committed to\nregularity\u2014\u201cif it has probability zero, it can\u2019t\nhappen!\u201d, as one might say.\n\nWe have seen a striking violation of regularity in de Finetti\u2019s\nlottery: his assignment of 0 to each ticket. Regularity may\nbe preserved here by countably additive probabilities, but at the\nexpense of a uniform distribution\u2014for example, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\nto ticket 1, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), to ticket 2, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) to ticket\n3, and so on. It may be shown that if \\(F\\) is uncountable, a\nKolmogorovian (real-valued) probability distribution must violate\nregularity. (See e.g. H\u00e1jek 2003b.) This has led to a cottage\nindustry of exploring whether regularity can be preserved by allowing\nthe ranges of probability functions to be richer fields than the real\nnumbers. For example, Bernstein and Wattenberg (1969) show that there\nexists a regular hyperreal-valued probability function for\nthe dart throw at [0, 1] that we imagined earlier. Each landing point\nreceives infinitesimal probability. Williamson (2007) argues\nthat an infinite sequence of tosses of a fair coin all landing heads\nmust receive probability 0 rather than some infinitesimal probability;\nHowson (2019) challenges the argument. The debate for and against\npreserving regularity continues, with Easwaran (2014) and Pruss (2012,\n2013b, 2014) against, Benci, Horsten and Wenmackers (2012, 2016)\nfor\u2014offering NAP as a way of doing so, again assigning\ninfinitesimal probabilities where Kolmogorov\u2019s theory would\nassign 0\u2019s.\n\nFor several further puzzles involving probability in infinite spaces,\nsee Arntzenius, Elga, and Hawthorne (2004) and Bartha and Hitchcock\n(1999). For more on infinitesimal probabilities in philosophical\napplications, see Benci, Horsten and Wenmackers (2012, 2018), Easwaran\n(2014), Halpern (2010), Hofweber (2014a, 2014b), Howson (2018), Kremer\n(2014), Lauvers (2017), Pruss (2012, 2013, 2014, 2018a, 2018b), van\nFraassen (1976), and Wenmackers and Horsten (2013).\n\nInfinitesimal probabilities are also appealed to in game theory. For\nexample, the concept of trembling hand perfect equilibrium\nassumes that each player in a game may make a mistake with positive\nbut negligible probability, which may be regarded as\ninfinitesimal\u2014see Halpern and Moses (2017). We will see further\nuse of infinitesimal probabilities in decision theory, to which we now\nturn.\n7. Decision\n\nWhen you make a decision, what you choose and the way the world turns\nout together determine an outcome, to which you assign a\nutility that measures how desirable it is for you. In a\ndecision under certainty, each action that you may perform has exactly\none possible outcome. In that case, it seems that you should simply\nperform an action that has maximal utility. (Read on, however!) In a\ndecision under risk, you assign probabilities to the various ways the\nworld could turn out\u2014the possible states. Suppose that\nthere are various actions \\(A_i\\) that you could perform, and various\nstates \\(S_j\\) to which you assign probabilities \\(p_j\\). Together\nthey determine outcomes to which you assign utilities \\(u_{ij}\\).\nClassic decision theory says that you should maximize expected\nutility: you should perform an action that maximizes the weighted\naverage of the utilities associated with that action, the weights\ngiven by your probabilities. Formally, you should maximize\n\n\\[ \\text{EU}(A_i) = \\sum_j p_j u_{ij} \\]\n\n\n(We ignore complications and variations that are irrelevant\nhere\u2014see the entries on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility\n and\n decision theory.)\n\nIn standard cases, it is assumed that\n\nthere are finitely many possible actions,\nfinitely many states of the world,\n\n\nand that\n\nthe utilities are finite.\n\n\nHowever, we may drop each of these assumptions, yielding three\ndifferent sources of infinitude in a decision problem. Accordingly, we\nwill present some well-known problems that arise when one or more of\nthese assumptions are violated. We begin with a decision under\ncertainty.\n7.1 Infinitely many possible actions: Ever-better wine\n\nPollock (1983) offers the following puzzle. You have a bottle of\nEver-better wine, which keeps improving as it ages: the later you open\nit, the better it will be. When should you open it? There\u2019s a\ngood sense in which any time is too soon: opening it slightly later\nwould be better. But the worst option is never to open it, and to\navoid this it must be opened at some time. This decision problem has\nuncountably many possible actions, but we could easily make them\ndenumerable by adding that the bottle can only be opened at discrete\ntimes\u2014e.g. on the hour. You would gladly perform an action that\nhas maximal utility, but here there is no such action! This problem\ndisplays an intriguing feature that Bartha, Barker and H\u00e1jek\n(2013) call discontinuity at infinity: \u201can infinite\nsequence of choices, each apparently sanctioned by plausible\nprinciples, converges \u2026 to a \u2018limit choice\u2019 whose\nutility is distinct from, and typically much lower than, the limit\napproached by the utilities of the choices in the sequence\u201d\n(630). Their paper discusses other decision problems with this\nfeature. For more discussion of this kind of phenomenon, see Chow,\nRobbins, and Siegmund (1971) and Seidenfeld (1981).\n7.2 Infinitely many states: the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nA fair coin is tossed. If it comes up heads, you receive $2. If it\ncomes up tails, the coin is tossed for a second time. If it then comes\nup heads, you receive $4. If it comes up tails, the coin is tossed for\na third time. If it then comes up heads, you receive $8. If it comes\nup tails, the coin is tossed for a fourth time. And so on. We continue\nuntil the coin comes up heads. If this takes n tosses, then you win\n$\\(2^n\\).\n\nHow much should you be prepared to pay to play this game? You have a\n1/2 chance of winning $2; and a 1/4 chance of winning $4; and a 1/8\nchance of winning $8; \u2026.; and a \\(1/2^n\\) chance of winning\n$\\(2^n\\); and \u2026 . Hence, your expected payoff from playing the\nSt. Petersburg game is infinite: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\frac{1}{2}\\times 2) &+ (\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4) + (\\frac{1}{8} \\times 8) + \\cdots + (\\frac{1}{2^n} \\times 2^n) + \\cdots \\\\\n &= 1 + 1 + 1 + \\cdots \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIf we identify dollars won with utilities, the game has infinite\nexpected utility.\n\nDecision theory seems to say that you should be prepared to pay any\nfinite amount to play this game. But most people think this is crazy;\nindeed, most would only pay a few dollars to play (Neugebauer 2010).\nAnd decision theory seems to say that you should be prepared to pay\nany finite amount for a ticket in any finite lottery whose payoff is a\nsingle play of this game. That may seem really crazy.\n\nYou might object that the utility of money decreases as you obtain\nmore of it: if the rate of this decrease is sufficiently large, then\nthe expected value of playing the game is finite. Daniel Bernoulli\nargued that utility goes by the logarithm of the amount of money, and\nindeed replacing the dollar amounts with their logarithms yields a\nfinite expected utility. However, we can retell the story in terms of\nutilities themselves. And we can retell it with super-exponential\nescalation of the value of the payoffs: taking logarithms then gives\nus exactly the original expected utility. (See Menger 1967/1934.) In\nfact, as long as utilities are unbounded, we can fashion a version of\nthe game that has infinite expected utility.\n\nSo you might object that the utilities are bounded. (See e.g., Hardin\n1982.) However, unbounded quantities abound\u2014length, volume,\nmass, curvature, temperature, and so on. Why is utility unlike them in\nthis regard? Moreover, one might imagine a case in which utilities are\nintimately linked to another such quantity\u2014e.g., the further\naway you get from some undesirable place, the better\u2014and an\nunbounded function might link them. Moreover, as we have noted,\nprobability theory is already shot through with infinitude; we need a\nprincipled reason why this kind of infinitude should be\nshunned. (See Nover and H\u00e1jek 2004 for further discussion.) And\nperhaps it is not crazy after all to value the St. Petersburg game\ninfinitely. After all, it dominates each truncation of the game, which\npays nothing if heads has not come up after \\(n\\) trials (for each\n\\(n\\)): the St. Petersburg game\u2019s outcome is equally good in\nfinitely many states, and strictly better in infinitely many.\nPlausibly, then, it should be preferred to all these truncations of\nthe game (H\u00e1jek and Nover 2006, 2008)\u2014its desirability is\ngreater than \\(n\\), for each \\(n\\).\n\nFor further discussion of the St. Petersburg game, see, for example:\nSamuelson (1977), Jeffrey (1983), Weirich (1984), Cowen and High\n(1988), Jordan (1994), Chalmers (2002), Peters (2011) and the entry on\n the St. Petersburg paradox.\n\nRelated but different problems arise in the Pasadena game, a\nSt. Petersburg-like game in which the expected payoff is apparently\nundefined (rather than infinite). Then, it seems that\ndecision theory goes silent regarding the value of the game. And yet\nvarious choices regarding the game seem to be rationally\nrequired\u2014e.g. preferring the game plus a $1 to the game itself.\nFor further discussion, see e.g. Nover and H\u00e1jek (2004),\nH\u00e1jek and Nover (2006, 2008), H\u00e1jek (2014), Easwaran\n(2008), Bartha (2016) and Colyvan and H\u00e1jek (2016).\n7.3 Infinite utility: Pascal\u2019s Wager\n\nIn the St. Petersburg game, each possible payoff is finite; it is the\nway in which they are averaged by the expected utility formula that\nyields the infinitude. We now turn to a classic decision problem in\nwhich a possible payoff itself is infinite.\n\nPascal maintains that we cannot know whether God exists or not, but he\nargues that we can solve the decision problem of whether or not to\n\u2018wager for God\u2019\u2014roughly, to cultivate belief in God.\nThere are two available courses of action: wager for God, or fail to\nwager for God. There are two relevant conceivable states of the world:\nGod exists, or God does not exist. The probability that God exists is\n\\(p\\), whence the probability assigned that God does not exist is \\(1\n- p\\). The utility of wagering for God, if God exists\u2014salvation\nforever\u2014is infinite. All of the other utilities\u2014of an\nearthly life of some finite duration\u2014are finite. We may\nformulate the resulting decision table as follows:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nProbabilities:\n\\(p\\)\n\\(1-p\\) \n\nWager for God\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\\(f_1\\) \n\nWager against God\n\\(f_2\\)\n\\(f_3\\)  \n\n\nWe may now do the expected utility calculations:\n\nThe expected utility of wagering for God is \n\\[ p\\cdot \\infty + (1 - p)\\cdot f_1 = \\infty. \\]\n\n\nThe expected utility of failing to wager for God is \n\\[ p \\cdot f_2 + (1 - p)\\cdot f_3 = \\text{ a finite value}. \\]\n\n\nIn order to maximize expected utility, one ought to wager for God.\n\nAmong the many objections that have been levelled at Pascal\u2019s\nWager, several focus on the role that \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019 plays\nin the argument. Can utilities be infinite? There is a considerable\nliterature that considers possible extensions of our decision rule,\nand possible modifications to the framework within which the decision\nproblem is framed. However, to date, there is no widely accepted\nalternative formulation of Pascal\u2019s Wager that avoids all these\ndifficulties that focus on the role that \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019\nplays in the argument. And once infinite utilities are countenanced,\nit seems that we should be open to infinitesimal probabilities also.\nBut then there is the prospect that when an infinite utility and an\ninfinitesimal probability are multiplied in the expected utility\nformula, the product may be a finite number. Will wagering for God\nstill maximize expected utility? These issues and more are discussed\nin the entry on\n Pascal\u2019s wager.\n\nFor further discussions of the treatment of infinity in Pascal\u2019s\nWager, see, for example: Duff (1986), Oppy (1991, 2018), H\u00e1jek\n(2003a, 2018), Bartha (2007, 2018), Bartha and Pasternack (2018),\nMonton (2011), and Wenmackers (2018).\n7.4 Infinite utility streams\n\nSo far we have been considering decisions in which one\u2019s payoff\ncomes in a single \u2018hit\u2019: a reward (or punishment) comes\nall at once. However, we can also consider cases in which one is to\nchoose between different infinite utility streams\u2014e.g.,\nstreams of finite daily utility that accumulate over an infinite\nfuture. There is an obvious candidate for evaluating the utility of a\nfinite stream: add the utilities along the stream. But this method is\nnot available when we have an infinite stream; we require additional\nprinciples to help us evaluate such streams, and it is not obvious\nwhat those principles should be.\n\nSuppose that a day spent in Heaven has utility 1 and a day spent in\nHell has utility \\(-1\\). Suppose further that, for all \\(n\\), \\(n\\)\ndays in Heaven have utility \\(n\\), and \\(n\\) days in Hell have utility\n\\(-n\\). Suppose, finally, that, for all \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), any\ncombination of \\(m\\) days in Heaven and \\(n\\) days in Hell has utility\n\\(m - n\\).\n\nHere are some candidate principles for the comparison of alternative\npossible future utility streams:\n\nOne should prefer the possible future utility stream that has\nmaximal total utility (if there is one).\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility\u2014i.e. is such that there is no finite value to which the\ntotal utility of the stream converges as the number of days\nincreases\u2014one should prefer the divergent utility stream whose\npartial sum is dominant (if there is one). This means that on\nsome days, the sum of utility to that day is greater than for any\nother stream, and on no days, the sum of utility to that day is less\nthan for some other stream.\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility, one should be indifferent between divergent future utility\nstreams that are permutations of one another.\n\n\nConsider the choice between the following two infinite utility\nstreams:\n\nAn infinite number of days in Heaven.\nAn infinite number of days in Heaven preceded by a finite number\nof days in Hell.\n\n\nPrinciple 2 says correctly that we should prefer (a) to (b).\n\nHowever, consider the choice between the following two options:\n\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first in Heaven, and then\nin Hell.\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first in Hell, and then in\nHeaven.\n\n\nPrinciple 2 says, incorrectly presumably, that we should prefer (c) to\n(d).\n\nNow consider the choice between the following two options:\n\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first in Heaven, and then\nin Hell.\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first one in Heaven and\none in Hell, then two in Heaven and one in Hell, then three in Heaven\nand one in Hell, and so on.\n\n\nWhile Principle 3 says, (perhaps) correctly that we should be\nindifferent between (c) and (d), it also says, (surely) incorrectly,\nthat we should be indifferent between (e) and (f).\n\nIn the face of these difficulties, you might consider weakening the\nprinciples:\n\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility, prefer the divergent possible future utility stream that is\nstep-by-step dominant (if there is one).\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility, maintain indifference between divergent possible future\nutility streams that are finite permutations of one another (i.e. that\ncan be derived from one another by finitely many exchanges at\nneighbouring steps).\n\n\nBut this pair of principles yields no verdict in the case of (e) and\n(f), and so does not yield a complete set of principles.\n\nMore generally, it is hard to codify rules for choosing among infinite\nutility streams. Indeed, there are some impossibility results in the\neconomics literature which suggest that there is no fully satisfactory\ntheory that countenances them.\n\nFor further discussion of infinite utility streams, see, for example:\nSegerberg (1976), Jeffrey (1983), Nelson (1991), Vallentyne (1993,\n1994, 1995), Cain (1995), Ng (1995), Van Liedekerke (1995), Lauwers\n(1997a, 1997b, 1997c, 1997d), Vallentyne and Kagan (1997), Basu and\nMitra (2003), Crespo, Nu\u00f1ez, and Rincou-Zapatero (2009),\nBartha, Barker and H\u00e1jek (2014), and Jonsson and Voorneveld\n(2015).\n\nEach of these decisions problems wears its infinitude on its sleeve:\nit is obvious that there are infinitely many possible actions, or\ninfinitely many states, or infinite utility, or infinite streams of\nutility. However, in some problems, such infinitude is not\nforegrounded, but it is tacitly there nonetheless. The\ntwo-envelope paradox is such a problem. See the\n\nSupplement on Tacitly Infinite Decision Problems: Two Envelopes.\n\nThere are various other paradoxes of infinity in decision\ntheory\u2014the interested reader may follow these references:\n\n\u201cAn Infinite Decision Puzzle\u201d: Barrett and Arntzenius\n(1999)\n\u201cTrumped\u201d: Arntzenius and McCarthy (1997)\n\u201cRouble Trouble\u201d: Arntzenius and Barrett (1999)\n\u201cThe Airtight Dutch Book\u201d: McGee (1999)\nSeveral paradoxes in Arntzenius, Elga and Hawthorne (2004)\n\u201cThe Cable Guy\u201d: H\u00e1jek (2005).\n\n8. Space and time\n\nConsidering whether space and time are infinite in extent and\ndivisibility has led to many famous puzzles, paradoxes and antimonies.\nIt was on account of such paradoxes that Kant was led to the claim\nthat whether space is finite or infinite escapes any possible\nempirical determination. Kant\u2019s presentation of the antinomies\nrested on a number of assumptions (such as the distinction between\ninfinite and unbounded) that were undermined by later results in\nmathematics or were simply found to be philosophically questionable.\nAnother interesting paradox relates to divisibility. In this section\nwe discuss Kant on the antinomies of space and time and a\nmeasure-theoretic solution to this paradox of divisibility. This is\nfollowed by a quick overview of some developments in non-Euclidean\ngeometries and relativistic cosmology. In the final part, we mention\nsome recent developments in cosmic topology, an area of cosmology that\nattempts to determine whether space is finite or infinite by a\ncombination of empirical observation and mathematical theorizing. The\nemphasis will be on the latter aspect.\n8.1 Antinomies of space and time\n\nMany philosophers have devised paradoxes and even putative\n\u2018antinomies\u2019 that exploit the structural features of space\nand time in a way that essentially involves the infinite. Among the\nancients, Zeno is renowned for his paradoxes of space, time and\nmotion. They involve infinitely many spatial or temporal subdivisions\nor processes that are putatively impossible\u2014see the entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes.\n Among the moderns, Kant is particularly notable for his treatment of\nthe extent of space and time in his \u2018First Antinomy of Pure\nReason\u2019. We turn to it now.\n8.1.1 Kant\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, A426\u2013A434,\nB454\u2013B462\u2014Kant gives \u2018proofs\u2019 of conflicting\ntheses\u2014\u2018thesis\u2019 and\n\u2018antithesis\u2019\u2014about the extent of space and time. The\n\u2018thesis\u2019 says that:\n\nthe world has a beginning in time; and\nthe world has a finite extension.\n\n\nThe \u2018antithesis\u2019 says:\n\nthe world has no beginning in time; and\nthe world has infinite extension.\n\n\nTo a reasonable approximation, the \u2018proofs\u2019 run as\nfollows:\n\nIf the world has no beginning in time, then, up to any given\nmoment, an eternity has elapsed: there has passed away an infinite\nseries of successive states of things. But the infinity of a series\nconsists in the fact that it can never be completed through successive\nsynthesis. So it is impossible for an infinite series of successive\nstates of things to have passed away: the world has a beginning in\ntime.\nSince infinite extension cannot be thought in a single completed\nact of thought, the world can only be thought to have infinite\nextension through an act of synthesis in which completion is achieved\nvia the addition of units. But an act of synthesis that achieved\ncompletion via the addition of units requires the lapse of an infinite\namount of time\u2014and we have already seen, in (a), that this is\nimpossible. Consequently, it cannot be thought that the world has\ninfinite extension. So the world does not have infinite\nextension.\nSomething begins to exist only if there is a prior time at which\nit does not exist. Hence, if the world has a beginning in time, there\nmust be an earlier time at which it does not exist: an empty time. But\nnothing can come into existence in an empty time, since there is no\nsufficient reason for the thing to come into existence in one rather\nthan another part of empty time. So the world does not have a\nbeginning in time.\nIf the world has finite extension, then the world is contained in\nan unlimited empty space. Consequently, the objects in the world are\nnot only related in space but also related to space.\nIn particular, the relation of the world to empty space is a relation\nof the world to no object, i.e. to nothing. But there can be no such\nrelation. So the world has infinite extension.\n\n\nMuch in Kant\u2019s discussion of the antinomies of space and time is\nmarred by his conflation of the modern definition of infinity as lack\nof finitude with the Aristotelian conception of the impossibility of\ncompletion. In addition, at A487/B515 we have confirmation that Kant\nuses \u201cinfinite\u201d and \u201cunbounded\u201d, as well as\n\u201cfinite\u201d and \u201cbounded\u201d, synonymously:\n\u201cFor if it [the magnitude of the world in space] is infinite and\nunbounded, then it is too big for every possible empirical concept. If\nit is finite and bounded, then you can rightfully ask: What determines\nthis boundary?\u201d It was only with the work of Bernhard Riemann in\nthe nineteenth century that geometrical concepts of space were\nintroduced that allowed the decoupling of unboundedness and infinity\n(and correspondingly of bounded and finite). See section\n 8.2.\n\nYou can find further\u2014sometimes sympathetic\u2014discussion of\nthese arguments in Bennett (1966), Huby (1971), Whitrow (1978), Craig\n(1979), Moore (1990/2019), Oppy (2006), Huemer (2016), and the entry\non\n Kant\u2019s Critique of Metaphysics.\n8.1.2 Measure\n\nHere is a Zeno-style argument:\n\nSuppose for reductio that a finite line segment of non-zero\nlength is composed of infinitely many disjoint parts of equal,\nreal-valued length.\n\nEither the parts all have zero length or they all have the same\nnon-zero length.\nThe length of the whole line segment is the sum of the lengths of\nthe parts.\nIf the parts all have zero length, then the line segment has zero\nlength, contradicting our assumption that it has non-zero length.\nIf the parts all have non-zero length, then the line segment has\ninfinite length contradicting our assumption that it is finite.\n\n\nConclusion 1: A finite line segment cannot be composed of infinitely\nmany disjoint parts of equal real-valued length.\n\nTherefore,\n\nConclusion 2: It cannot be composed of points.\n\nPremise 1 is beyond reproach. However, premises 2, 3, and 4 require us\nto be careful about how lengths add. Recall that in section\n 3.2\n we discussed how to add a countable sequence of numbers \u2013 but\nthe method described there depends on the order, and requires a\ncountable, well-ordered sequence. Although there are techniques for\nsumming uncountable sets of non-negative numbers, most mathematicians\ndeny that lengths or other measures can be added in these ways. This\nis parallel to what Kolmogorov said about probability (see section\n 6.3).\n Probability and length are two paradigms of the more general\nmathematical field of \u201cmeasure theory\u201d, which includes all\nsuch countably additive real-valued functions. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of this problem, including approaches involving\ninfinitesimal length, see Skyrms (1983).\n\nFor more about measure theory, see Bartle (1995) and Tao (2011).\n8.2. Non-Euclidean geometries, relativistic space-time, and cosmic topology\n8.2.1 Non-Euclidean geometries\n\nIn section\n 1\n we anticipated that Archytas\u2019 argument for the infinitude of\nthe cosmos, and Kant\u2019s treatment of the antinomies, conflated\nthe notions of finiteness and boundedness.\n\nWe now need to introduce another aspect of 19th century mathematics\nthat brought that crucial distinction into focus. The distinction\nbetween finiteness and boundedness (and consequently that between\ninfinitude and unboundedness) greatly improved our understanding of\nissues concerning the structure of space, and what shape a finite, or\nan infinite space, might take. Recall that for two centuries after\nNewton, cosmology was developed within the framework of Euclidean\ninfinite space. Such a space is infinite in all directions, it is\nhomogeneous and isotropic\u2014that is, it is the same at all\nlocations and in all directions.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, alternative conceptions of\ngeometrical space were developed, so-called non-Euclidean\ngeometries. Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevski and Riemann, showed that\none can develop geometries that falsify Euclid\u2019s parallel axiom\nwhile preserving all the other Euclidean axioms. The axiom states (in\na later but equivalent version to the one given by Euclid) that for\nany line and a point external to that line, there is one and only one\nparallel to the given line passing through the point. The statement\ncontains a claim of existence and a claim of uniqueness. It can be\nthus falsified by denying existence or by accepting the existence but\ndenying the uniqueness. Both alternatives have been developed, with\nsome of the earliest interpretations using surfaces. The first\nalternative, where no parallels exist to any given line that pass\nthrough a given point external to the given line, is known as\nelliptic geometry. An instance of elliptic geometry is\nspherical geometry, so called because it can be modeled on\nthe surface of a sphere. The second alternative is known as\nhyperbolic geometry and in it for every line in the model and\nany point outside of the line there are infinitely many parallels to\nthat line passing through the point. A portion of the surface of a\nhorse saddle can be used to model hyperbolic geometry. (The pictures\nbelow are based on those in Luminet 2008: 49.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curvature of a surface at a point \\(p\\) on the surface measures\nhow much the surface bends away from its tangent plane at \\(p\\). The\ncurvature of a surface is constant if at every point \\(p\\) of the\nsurface the surface bends away from the tangent plane by the same\nquantity. Examples of surfaces which can be used to model various\ngeometries are the surface of the cylinder (Euclidean; constant\ncurvature 0), the sphere (spherical; positive curvature), and the\nhorse saddle (hyperbolic; negative curvature). They are all homogenous\nand isotropic but they have different constant curvature.\n\nSuch geometries on surfaces spurred the development of\nthree-dimensional and higher dimensional spaces with different\ncurvatures: positive, null, and negative. An example of a space of\npositive constant curvature is the 3-sphere (also called\nhypersphere) used by Bernhard Riemann in his 1854 dissertation (see\nRiemann 1868; for an English translation see Riemann 2016). A\n3-sphere is a surface in a four-dimensional space that is\nobtained as a generalization of the 2-sphere as visualized in\nthree dimensions: in both cases we define the relevant notion as a\nlocus of points that have a constant distance from a point (its\ncenter). For instance, the unit 2-sphere centered at the origin is the\nset of triples of real numbers \\((x, y, z)\\) that are one unit away\nfrom (0, 0, 0), i.e. that satisfy \\(x^2 +y^2 +z^2 =1\\), and the\n3-sphere with distance 1 from the origin (0, 0, 0, 0) is the set of\nquadruples \\((x, y, z, w)\\) of real numbers satisfying \\(x^2 +y^2 +z^2\n+w^2 =1\\). It is a model of physical space that is finite but\nunbounded, in explicit opposition to Newton\u2019s conception of\nspace.\n\nArchytas\u2019s argument (in section\n 1\n above), which conflated unboundedness with infinitude, could finally\nbe put to rest. Riemann\u2019s model allows for the universe to be\nfinite and unbounded at the same time. In 1854 he wrote: \u201cThe\nunboundedness of space possesses in this way a greater empirical\ncertainty than any external experience. But its infinite extent by no\nmeans follows from this; on the other hand if we assume independence\nof bodies from position, and therefore ascribe to space constant\ncurvature, it must necessarily be finite provided this curvature has\never so small a positive value. If we prolong all the geodesics\nstarting in a given surface-element, we should obtain an unbounded\nsurface of constant curvature, i.e., a surface which in a flat\nmanifoldness of three dimensions would take the form of a sphere, and\nconsequently be finite.\u201d (Riemann 2016: 39)\n\nThe distinction between infinite and unbounded is an integral part of\nthe conceptual leap that leads to the idea that physical space need\nnot be Euclidean. In the following section we will briefly describe\nhow issues of curvature and topology play a role in addressing the\nquestion of whether the world is spatially finite or infinite in\ncosmology.\n\nOn non-Euclidean geometries the reader will find useful Greenberg\n(2007) and Gray (2010). On the philosophical relevance of curvature\nand Riemannian geometry see the classic Torretti (1984).\n8.2.2 Relativistic space-time and cosmic topology\n\nIn 1915 Einstein introduced general relativity, and our conception of\nthe universe is based on it. General relativity rests on a conception\nof space and time\u2014or better, space-time matter\u2014that stands\nin opposition to the Newtonian one we have described above. In\nEinstein\u2019s theory, space-time is deformable and its shape\ndepends on the presence of matter. Space-time is, in technical terms,\na four-dimensional manifold. We may think of an \\(n\\)-dimensional\nmanifold as a set of \\(n\\)-tuples of real numbers. The spatial section\nof a four-dimensional manifold of space-time is a three-dimensional\nmanifold (one can think of it as a set of triples of real numbers),\nand when cosmologists ask about the shape of the universe they try to\ncharacterize this three-dimensional manifold. The curvature of\nspace-time corresponds to gravitation, and light rays and other\nmaterial particles follow the geodesics (shortest paths) in the\nmanifold. In general, the geodesics differ depending on the\nmatter-energy content of the space being considered. The geodesics of\nthe surface of the sphere (i.e. a two-dimensional surface) are\nportions of great circles. In the Euclidean plane, they are segments\nof straight lines. There are analogous notions for four-dimensional\nmanifolds. Einstein\u2019s equations for general relativity describe\nhow the matter-energy content of the universe determines the geometry\nof space-time. The equations also yield cosmological models, which\nmust be tested by empirical observation. The equations allow for\nmultiple solutions and, as Alexander Friedmann (1924) observed,\n\u201cin the absence of additional hypotheses, Einstein\u2019s\nequations for the universe do not allow to definitely answer the\nquestion of the finiteness of the universe\u201d. Let us briefly\nexplain what is at stake in this comment, by pointing out the role of\ncurvature and topology with respect to the issue of finiteness vs.\ninfiniteness of our universe in relativistic cosmology. Topology is\nthe branch of geometry that classifies spaces according to whether\nthey can be transformed into one another \u201ccontinuously\u201d,\nthat is with transformations that do not lead to cuts or tears.\n\nIn 1917, Einstein posited a static finite universe. The finiteness was\ngiven by the choice of the 3-sphere (see section\n 8.2.1)\n and the static nature of the universe by the fact that the radius of\nthe hypersphere did not change with time. With Friedmann\n(1922\u201324) and Lema\u00eetre (1927), Einstein\u2019s static\nmodel would be replaced by dynamical models (to account for the\nempirical evidence that by 1930 led to the postulation that the\nuniverse is expanding, i.e., most galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc. are\ngrowing further apart, just as spots on an uninflated balloon grow\nfurther apart when the balloon is blown up). Such models are also\namong the possible solutions for Einstein\u2019s equations and they\nwere the source for the so-called \u201cBig Bang\u201d theories. But\nwhat about finiteness? The finiteness or infiniteness of the universe\nare not determined by Einstein\u2019s equations, which allow for both\npossibilities. In his choice of the 3-sphere, Einstein was motivated\nby considerations that had to do with preserving a hypothesis by Mach\non inertial mass and inertial motion. Friedmann and Lema\u00eetre\nalso opted for the finiteness of the universe (we need not get into\nwhy they did so). Their dynamical models assumed a uniform\ndistribution of matter in the universe and that space is homogeneous\nand isotropic. But the Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre dynamical solutions\nstill allow for a great variety of mathematical solutions and do not\nsettle the issue of finiteness. Our observations in what follows are\nrestricted to such models.\n\nSpace, in this context, is characterized by its curvature (taken to be\nconstant) and its topology. Let us consider curvature first. In these\nmodels, there are three possible types of spaces depending on whether\nthe curvature of the space is negative, null, or positive. The spaces\ncorresponding to such curvatures are called hyperbolic,\nEuclidean, and elliptical. A spherical space\n(constant positive curvature) is always of finite extension, no matter\nwhat its topology is. This explains, at least in part, why many early\ncosmologists (including Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lema\u00eetre\nand others) opted for this solution. Indeed, for a long time issues\nconcerning the topology of space were not brought to the fore due to\nthe implicit assumption that the topology of space was a simply\nconnected topology (in a simply connected topology every loop on the\nsurface can be continuously contracted to a point). Under that\nassumption, spaces of positive constant curvature are finite and those\nof null and negative constant curvature are infinite. The issue then\nof the finiteness vs. infiniteness of the universe rests on the mean\ndensity of matter and energy and on the value of a parameter\n\\(\\lambda\\) introduced by Einstein in 1917, called the\ncosmological constant (measuring a sort of anti-gravitational\nforce). With most cosmologists (but not Einstein in 1917) assuming\n\\(\\lambda = 0\\), and with the assumption that space is simply\nconnected, determining curvature (and hence resolving the finiteness\nvs infinity issue) depends only on a critical value for the mean\ndensity of matter\u2014equivalently, on a density parameter\n\\(\\Omega\\). Thus, under those assumptions, it would be in principle\npossible to determine the curvature of space experimentally.\n\nDifferent values of \\(\\lambda\\) lead to different scenarios for the\nevolution of the universe. With \\(\\lambda = 0\\), if the curvature of\nspace is negative or null we end up with a constantly expanding\nuniverse; if the curvature of space is positive, a phase of expansion\nwould be followed by a contraction leading to a \u201cbig\ncrunch\u201d. Other values of the cosmological constant are possible\nand if \\(\\lambda \\lt 0\\) a \u201cbig crunch\u201d will occur no\nmatter what the curvature of space is. By contrast, if \\(\\lambda \\gt\n0\\), no \u201cbig crunch\u201d will occur. New experimental evidence\n(coming from type 1A supernovae and fossil radiation) seems to\nindicate a positive mean density of matter and a value of \\(\\lambda\n\\gt 0\\). In this case the universe would be finite while still\nremaining in perpetual accelerated expansion.\n\nMoreover, recent work has pointed out the importance of considering\nmultiply connected topologies. Unlike what happens for simply\nconnected topologies, curvature does not immediately determine the\nfiniteness or infinity of the space. Indeed, there are spaces of null\nor negative curvature that can be finite or infinite depending on the\nmultiply connected topology associated to them. This leads into\ncosmic topology, which investigates the global shape of space\nand how it can be determined experimentally. If space has positive\ncurvature, then the universe is finite independently of the specific\ntopology associated with it. But if the curvature is negative or null,\nwhether the universe is finite or not will depend on the topology.\nThus, determining whether the universe is finite or infinite requires\nnot only determining the mean density of matter (which determines the\ncurvature of space) but also the topology of space. Two major\ntechniques that are employed experimentally to determine the topology\nof space are cosmic crystallography and the circles in the sky method\n(based on the cosmic microwave background).\n\nFor further information on cosmic topology see Luminet, Starkmann, and\nWeeks, (1999), Luminet and Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey (2005), Luminet (2005)\n(English 2008). See also Aguirre (2011) and Luminet (2015). For more\ntechnical treatment see Thurston (1997), Weeks (2001), and Hitchmann\n2018.\n9. Conclusion\n\nWe are well aware that our discussion of infinity is\nincomplete\u2014but then, so is any such discussion. We take some\ncomfort from the fact that it is impossible to give balanced coverage\nto a boundless set of issues in finite space.\n\nThere are many more philosophically significant paradoxes and puzzles\nthat involve infinity in one way or another; we have only given a\nsmall sample. And new paradoxes involving infinity seem to appear at\nan ever-increasing rate (doubtless yet another one can be fashioned\nout of this very fact!). However, so too are our tools for\nunderstanding infinity. Of course, we cannot give a definitive\nassessment of the state of play, but the theoretical developments that\nwe have sketched and references that we have cited make us sanguine\nthat overall, the prospects for our relationship with infinity are\ngood: we can indeed live with it.\n",
