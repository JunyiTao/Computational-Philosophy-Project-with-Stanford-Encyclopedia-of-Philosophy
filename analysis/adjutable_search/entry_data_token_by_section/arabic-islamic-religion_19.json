    "main_text": "Ethics in Islam || The Mu\u02bftazilites on the morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn wa-l-qub\u1e25)\n7.2 Responses to the Mu\u02bftazilites\n\nMost medieval Muslim thinkers, whether philosophers, theologians or\nSufis, recognized some need for religion in order to possess a\ncomplete understanding of things ethical. Although they generally\ngranted that humans have some intuitive recognition of virtues and\nwhat is morally good and bad, they emphasized that various human\nconditions limit our ability always to judge correctly about the\nethical status of particular actions. One such limit is our inherent\ncognitive limits. Thus, the Sufi master Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b complains\nthat because the moral goodness or badness of actions may depend on\ncertain conditions that human reason cannot comprehended, divine\nrevelation is needed to inform us of the ethical status of our actions\n(Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b al-Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101t\nal-Makkiyya (b), I 459\u201360 & VII 326). For instance,\nwhat we \u2018observe\u2019 or judge to be a benefit may, all things\nconsidered, actually be harmful and similarly for our judgments about\nwhat is harmful. Only from a \u2018God\u2019s eye perspective\u2019\ncan one be assured that in fact all things have been considered. In\naddition to our inherent cognitive limits, personal and social\nconditions affect the reliability of our ethical judgments. For\nexample, the Sunni jurist, \u1e24ak\u012bm al-Tirmidh\u012b (d. ca.\n869), noted that while reason has some share in making sound moral\njudgments, selfishness and the human desire for material benefits and\npleasures hinders our ability always to reason correctly and\nobjectively about what is ethically right and wrong (Tirmidh\u012b\nKit\u0101b Ithb\u0101t al-\u02bfilal, 67\u201378).\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 identify yet another\nhuman condition that requires religion to aid reason in determining\nright ethical rules. They maintained that ethical and political\njudgments are not a priori necessary truths, but well-known\nand commonly accepted specific rules\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl\u0101t) acquired from attending to various\npractices over long periods of time. Thus, without knowing this\nsocio-cultural history that religion preserves, one cannot know what\nis efficacious for living a good and virtuous life here on earth\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, 77\u20138 and Avicenna\nMetaH: 10.2\u20134; also see Erlwein 2019).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians in general vehemently\ncriticized the Mu\u02bftazilite position that reason alone can\ndiscover even general ethical demands incumbent upon humans and God\nalike. Their criticisms highlight the unacceptable theological\nimplications of the Mu\u02bftazilite position and the inherent limits\nof human reason. The most common criticism comes from the theological\nimplication that God is compelled or obligated to do the good. Recall\nthat the general Mu\u02bftazilite position, as \u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r articulated it, holds that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions regardless of their agents, and so since God is\ngood, God is morally compelled to do good. One obvious implication of\nthis view is that if God cannot do bad actions, then God\u2019s power\nis limited, and so God is not wholly omnipotent. From a theological\npoint of view, Ash\u02bfarite theologians found this implication\nunacceptable. Consequently, they denied that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions and instead demanded that all ethical standards\nare dependent on what God himself commands.\n\nAs for criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite position from the\nnature of human reason, Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidites theologians\navailed themselves of all the argument we have already seen about the\nlimits of our cognitive capacities and the constraints of our human\ncondition. Thus, for example, M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b presses the\npoint that while humans may have some inkling of general ethical\nprinciples and what is morally good and bad, these judgments are\nalways shaky given the frailty of our cognitive capacities.\nConsequently, religion is always needed to set our moral judgments on\nfirm ground (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 346\u201351).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite scholars also added further arguments to\nthe arsenal of criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite ethical theory.\nFor instance, in The Guide to Conclusive Proofs, Juwayn\u012b\nputs forth an account of the good and bad, which in certain ways\nanticipates the moral theory of David Hume seven hundred years later\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 141\u20136). The Mu\u02bftazilite\nposition rests on two key elements: (1) that some actions are either\ninherently and rationally good or bad and (2) the implicit assumption\nthat a rational agent must act in a rational way. Juwayn\u012b simply\ndenies that moral actions are inherently rational and that\nconsequently there is anything irrational when one does a good or bad\naction. To be sure, actions can be obligatory and praiseworthy or\nprohibited and blameworthy, but not rational. Instead, continues\nJuwayn\u012b, when through self-reflection or inference one recognizes\nthat certain actions are seemingly beneficial and others harmful, one\nmerely instinctually recognizes that those actions produce pleasure or\npain. It is the human\u2019s (and all animals\u2019) natural\ninstinct to seek pleasure and to avoid pain that motivates the action,\nnot some inherent rational property of the object that reason\ngrasps.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b likewise rejected the Mu\u02bftazilites\u2019\nposition, which he claimed rested upon an ambiguity in the meanings of\nthe terms \u2018good\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019 and\n\u2018obligatory\u2019 (w\u0101jib). For Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nwhen one says an action is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019,\nthose value judgments must be understood in terms of the intention or\npurpose relative to the agent or the one affected by the action. So\nunderstood, an action is good if it achieves the intended purpose and\nbad if it does not. While reason can direct and set one\u2019s\nintentions, so can imagination and estimation (wahm) as well\nas our passions and appetites. These latter faculty, however,\nfrequently fail to get at what is ultimately beneficial and harmful\nfor us, and so they fail to get at what an agent would intend all\nthings considered. Divine law provides precisely the\n\u2018all-things-considered\u2019 view.\n\nAs for human reason\u2019s determining what is morally incumbent upon\nGod, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b continues that since good and bad are related\nto the intentions of the agent, it is impossible for reason alone to\ndetermine whether God\u2019s actions are good or bad since we simply\ndo not know God\u2019s intentions independent of revelation. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b developed a similar defense (F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b al-Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, 289\u2013304; also see\nShihadeh 2006 and 2021). Now instead of understanding good and bad\nrelative to an agent\u2019s intentions, Razi explains them in\nconsequentialist terms: Actions are good when, relative to the agent\nor one affected by the action, they are beneficial or pleasurable and\nbad when they are harmful or painful. Since God is in no need of\nbenefit and in no way can be pained, there is a sense in which his\nactions are simply beyond good and evil.\n\nIn light of their denial that there is any objective, God-independent\nstandard of right and wrong to which God is beholden, Ash\u02bfarites\nwere accused of undermining God\u2019s justice and making the\ngoodness or badness of actions arbitrary. That is because if there\nwere no limits to what God can morally command, then what God willed\nin the past to be good or bad, he could in the future will and so\ncommand to be contrariwise. Indeed, God may inflict pain on an\ninnocent for no reason whatsoever, and yet that action would be good\nprecisely because God commanded it. The Ash\u02bfarites were not\ninsensitive to this complaint. While both al-Juwayn\u012b and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b insist on God\u2019s absolute omnipotence and so\nGod\u2019s possibility to act arbitrarily, they also note that an\naction is only actually arbitrary if it is actually carried out, not\nif its occurrence is merely possible. Thus, a preferred Ash\u02bfarite\nresponse to the arbitrariness complaint was that the possibility of\nthe occurrence is not the occurrence of the possibility; God confirms\nvia revelation that he gives reward for good actions and he may punish\nonly those who do not fulfill what is decreed by revelation\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 157\u201364, 209\u201311 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 172\u201388).\n",
