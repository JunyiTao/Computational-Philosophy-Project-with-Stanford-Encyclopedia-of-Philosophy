    "main_text": "Heisenberg || The interpretation of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relations\n2.3 The interpretation of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relations\n\nHeisenberg\u2019s relations were soon considered to be a cornerstone\nof the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Just a few\nmonths later, Kennard (1927) already called them the \u201cessential\ncore\u201d of the new theory. Taken together with Heisenberg\u2019s\ncontention that they provide the intuitive content of the theory and\ntheir prominent role in later discussions on the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, a dominant view emerged in which the uncertainty\nrelations were regarded as a fundamental principle of the theory.\n\nThe interpretation of these relations has often been debated. Do\nHeisenberg\u2019s relations express restrictions on the experiments\nwe can perform on quantum systems, and, therefore, restrictions on the\ninformation we can gather about such systems; or do they express\nrestrictions on the meaning of the concepts we use to describe quantum\nsystems? Or else, are they restrictions of an ontological nature,\ni.e., do they assert that a quantum system simply does not possess a\ndefinite value for its position and momentum at the same time? The\ndifference between these interpretations is partly reflected in the\nvarious names by which the relations are known, e.g., as\n\u201cinaccuracy relations\u201d, or: \u201cuncertainty\u201d,\n\u201cindeterminacy\u201d or \u201cunsharpness relations\u201d.\nThe debate between these views has been addressed by many authors, but\nit has never been settled completely. Let it suffice here to make only\ntwo general observations.\n\nFirst, it is clear that in Heisenberg\u2019s own view all the above\nquestions stand or fall together. Indeed, we have seen that he adopted\nan operational \u201cmeasurement=meaning\u201d principle according\nto which the meaningfulness of a physical quantity was equivalent to\nthe existence of an experiment purporting to measure that quantity.\nSimilarly, his \u201cmeasurement=creation\u201d principle allowed\nhim to attribute physical reality to such quantities. Hence,\nHeisenberg\u2019s discussions moved rather freely and quickly from\ntalk about experimental inaccuracies to epistemological or ontological\nissues and back again.\n\nHowever, ontological questions seemed to be of somewhat less interest\nto him. For example, there is a passage (Heisenberg 1927: 197), where\nhe discusses the idea that, behind our observational data, there might\nstill exist a hidden reality in which quantum systems have definite\nvalues for position and momentum, unaffected by the uncertainty\nrelations. He emphatically dismisses this conception as an unfruitful\nand meaningless speculation, because, as he says, the aim of physics\nis only to describe observable data. Similarly, in the Chicago\nLectures, he warns against the fact that the human language permits\nthe utterance of statements which have no empirical content, but\nnevertheless produce a picture in our imagination. He notes, \n\n\nOne should be especially careful in using the words\n\u201creality\u201d, \u201cactually\u201d, etc., since these words\nvery often lead to statements of the type just mentioned. (Heisenberg\n1930: 11) \n\n\nSo, Heisenberg also endorsed an interpretation of his relations as\nrejecting a reality in which particles have simultaneous definite\nvalues for position and momentum.\n\nThe second observation is that although for Heisenberg experimental,\ninformational, epistemological and ontological formulations of his\nrelations were, so to say, just different sides of the same coin, this\nis not so for those who do not share his operational principles or his\nview on the task of physics. Alternative points of view, in which\ne.g., the ontological reading of the uncertainty relations is denied,\nare therefore still viable. The statement, often found in the\nliterature of the thirties, that Heisenberg had proved the\nimpossibility of associating a definite position and momentum to a\nparticle is certainly wrong. But the precise meaning one can\ncoherently attach to Heisenberg\u2019s relations depends rather\nheavily on the interpretation one favors for quantum mechanics as a\nwhole. And because no agreement has been reached on this latter issue,\none cannot expect agreement on the meaning of the uncertainty\nrelations either.\n",
