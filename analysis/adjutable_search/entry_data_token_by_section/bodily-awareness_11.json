    "main_text": "Mental representations and the body || Taxonomies of body representations\n3.2 Taxonomies of body representations\n\nNow one may ask whether we have only one model that depicts the whole\nbody or whether it is sufficient to have a collection of local models\n(Alsmith forthcoming). Try, for instance, using a hand to touch your\nfoot whilst using the other to touch your face. To perform this task,\nis it sufficient to have local body models that represent individual\nbody parts? Or do we also need a global body representation whose\nfunction would be to structure these local representations?\n\nOne may further ask whether one can functionally defined different\ntypes of body representations. One single body representation does not\nseem to suffice to account for the variety of bodily disorders and for\nthe variety of aspects of bodily awareness. There needs to be more,\nbut how many? In 1911, Head and Holmes present the first taxonomy of\nthe representations of the body. In addition to what they call a body\nimage, which constitutes the conscious percept of the body, they\ndistinguish two types of unconscious representations, called body\nschemata: one records every new posture or movement whereas the other\nmaps the surface of the body on which sensations are localized.\nHowever, for a long time, the terms of body schema and body image had\nbeen used interchangeably (see Schilder 1935, for instance), whereas\nthe fine-grained distinction between the two types of body schema had\nalmost completely disappeared. Nonetheless, since the eighties there\nhas been a renewal of interest for distinguishing various types of\nbody representation (O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980; Paillard 1999;\nGallagher 1986), although there is little agreement, neither on the\nway to individuate the distinct types of body representations, nor on\ntheir precise number. Here is a sample of the\ncharacteristics that have been used so far to distinguish them:\n\nAvailability to consciousness (unconscious/conscious)\nDynamics (short-term/long-term)\nFunctional role (action/perception)\nFormat (sensorimotor/visuo-spatial/linguistic/affective)\nModality of input (proprioception/vision/interoception)\nBodily information (enduring properties such as body metrics/body\nposture/internal balance)\nPerspective (first-person/third-person)\nDirection of fit (mind-to-world/world-to-mind)\n\n\nThese distinctions give rise to different taxonomies (e.g., Schwoebel\n& Coslett 2005; Sirigu et al. 1991; Paillard 1999; Dijkerman &\nde Haan 2007; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980; Gallagher 1995), which\nsometimes lead to opposite interpretations of the very same bodily\ndisorders. For instance, personal neglect (i.e., lack of exploration\nof half of the body) has been interpreted as resulting from a deficit\nof body schema (Coslett 1998), or from a deficit of body image\n(Gallagher 1995).  Furthermore, although most taxonomies rely on\nneuropsychological dissociations, it does not seem likely that they\ncan account for all bodily disorders. Even three types of body\nrepresentation might not suffice to explain all the possible\ndissociations. On the other hand, one may wish to avoid a\nquasi-infinite list of body representations.\n\nEven the definition of the body schema, which appears the less\ncontroversial notion, often remains vague. The term \u2018body\nschema\u2019 functions as a general term that groups together various\nbody representations intervening at different stages in motor control,\nrepresenting short-term or long-term body properties, used for\npositive or negative affordances. It is commonly defined as the representation of the body\nfor action. But many states can contribute to action planning,\nincluding some very high-level states. Imagine for instance that you\nwant to cut a cake into six equal slices. To do so, you can exploit\nyour mathematical knowledge that 360 degrees divided by 6 equals 60\ndegrees. This knowledge can guide your hand while splitting the cake.\nYour ability to do maths can thus play a role in guiding your action,\nbut clearly, the body schema must be more intimately connected to\naction. What makes the body schema so special? The type of information\nthat it represents? The way this information is represented? Or the\nfunction of the representation? Furthermore, the distinction between\nthe body schema and the body image has become the stock in trade of\nmuch recent work in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy. Yet little\nis known about the interactions between these two types of body\nrepresentations (Gadsby 2018; Pitron,\nAlsmith, & Vignemont 2018). In our everyday life the body we\nperceive does not conflict with the body we act with. One needs to\naccount not only for dissociations in rare cases, but also for\nconvergence most of the time.\n",
