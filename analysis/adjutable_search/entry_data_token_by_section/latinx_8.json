    "main_text": "Origins || Self-Consciously Latinx Philosophy\n2.4 Self-Consciously Latinx Philosophy\n\nThere is a final thread to the origin of Latinx philosophy that merits\nattention: the emergence of a self-aware field, a field that thinks of\nitself as engaged in explicitly Latinx philosophy. At roughly the end\nof the twentieth century, a group of US-based academic philosophers\nbegan to frame their work in terms of its significance for Latinx\npopulations in the United States. For example, Eduardo Mendieta (1999)\nexplored the complexities of US citizenship and the \u201cbecoming\nHispanic\u201d that is sometimes involved in Latinx identity. Alcoff\n(2000, 2006) explored the difficulty of thinking of Latinxs as simply\na race or simply an ethnic group, and in general, the complexity of\nlived social identities in the US context. Gracia (2000, 2008) and\nCorlett (2000, 2003) each offered accounts of the nature of group\nmembership, and explored the consequences of these things for concrete\npolitical questions, such as affirmative action.\n\nAll of this work was explicitly about Latina/os, and is now rightly\nthought of as squarely in the ambit of Latinx philosophy. It was also\ntrue that when it was written, it was not regularly thought of as a\ncontribution to Latinx philosophy, per se. As we saw above, to the\nextent that scholars considered the possibility, they tended to deny\nthat such a field existed (cf. Bernstein 2001). So, even when\nLatinx-focused work was undertaken partly in conversation with\ndevelopments in Africana philosophy, Asian-American philosophy, and\nvarious developments in ethnic studies, the work of Latinx-specific\nphilosophy was typically understood as a contribution to, for example,\nthe philosophy of race, or as a piece of social and political\nphilosophy.\n\nBy the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, this\npresumption began to change. A body of self-described Latinx\nphilosophy began to emerge, with all the usual academic apparatus\nsurrounding it, along with more frequent usages of the term\n\u201cLatinx philosophy\u201d and its variants (R. S\u00e1nchez\n 2013).[14]\n",
