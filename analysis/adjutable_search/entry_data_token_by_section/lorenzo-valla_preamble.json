    "main_text": "\n\nLorenzo Valla (c. 1406\u20131457) was one of the most important\nhumanists of his time. In his Elegantiae linguae Latinae, an\nadvanced handbook of Latin language and style, he gave the humanist\nprogram some of its most trenchant and combative formulations,\nbringing the study of Latin to an unprecedented level. He made\nnumerous contributions to classical scholarship. But he also used his\nvast knowledge of the classical languages and their literatures as a\ntool to criticize a wide range of ideas, theories, and established\npractices. He famously exposed the Donation of Constantine\u2014an\nimportant document justifying the papacy\u2019s claims to temporal\nrule\u2014as a forgery. He compared, for the first time, St.\nJerome\u2019s translation of the Bible with the Greek text of the New\nTestament, thereby laying the foundations of critical biblical\nscholarship. In his Repastinatio dialectice et philosophie\n(Re-ploughing of Dialectic and Philosophy), also known as his\nDialectics or Dialectical Disputations, he attacked\nscholastic-Aristotelian thought from an essentially linguistic point\nof view, arguing that philosophy should conform to common sense and\ncommon linguistic usage. Already highly controversial in his own\ntimes, Valla\u2019s works continue to provoke debate in modern times,\nwhich reflects broader discussions about the philosophical relevance\nand significance of Renaissance humanism for the development of early\nmodern philosophy.\n",
