    "main_text": "The Distribution of Modality || Substances\n1.1 Substances\n\nIn the case of substances, Spinoza claims that every existing\nsubstance necessarily exists (Ip7d). No existing substance could have\nfailed to exist. He also claims that only one substance, God, actually\nexists and that only this one substance could have existed\n(Ip14). Putting these claims together, Spinoza believes that every\npossible substance necessarily exists. Since God is the only possible\nsubstance, it is impossible for any other substance besides God to\nexist.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s argument for these conclusions can be divided into two\nmajor stages:\n\nEvery possible substance necessarily exists.\nGod is the only possible substance.\n\n\nLet us consider Spinoza\u2019s reasoning for each of these steps in\nturn, as doing so will help us understand some of Spinoza\u2019s most\nimportant and basic metaphysical commitments.\n\nIn arguing for (1), Spinoza relies on two implicit and related\npremises. One is the\n principle of sufficient reason\n (PSR) and the other involves his account of causation. Put roughly,\nthe PSR states that every fact has a reason for obtaining; in slogan\nform, there are no brute facts. Most relevantly for our\npurposes, if something existed for no reason at all, the fact that it\nexists would be inexplicable, a violation for the PSR. And for\nparallel reasons, if something did not exist and there was no reason\nfor its non-existence, the fact of its non-existence would also be a\nviolation of the PSR. As Spinoza puts it, \u201cFor each thing there\nmust be assigned a cause or reason, both for its existence [if it\nexists] and for its non-existence [if it does not exist]. For example,\nif a triangle exists, there must be a reason or cause why it exists;\nbut if it does not exist, there must also be a reason or cause which\nprevents it from existing, or which takes its existence away\u201d\n(Ip11d). Thus, according to the PSR, there must be sufficient reasons\nwhy each existing substance exists and also sufficient reasons why\nnon-existing substances do not exist.\n\nThe second implicit premise of Spinoza\u2019s argument for the claim\nthat all possible substances necessarily exist is that causes\nprovide (or just are) necessary and sufficient explanatory reasons.\nThis idea appears in the previously quoted passage in which Spinoza\nclaims that citing a \u201ccause or reason\u201d suffices for\nexplaining facts about the existence and non-existence of a triangular\nobject. Applied to the case of substance, the sufficient reason for\nwhy a substance exists is supplied by the causes of that\nsubstance.\n\nWhy does Spinoza think that an account of an object\u2019s causes\nexplains that object\u2019s existence? His most revealing answer\ntraces back to the PSR as well. Because facts about the nature of\ncausation are facts, by the PSR, facts about causation require\nexplanation too. In a case in which x causes y, the\nPSR demands an explanation of what it is in virtue of which the causal\nrelation between x and y obtains. Although one may\ntry to answer this question by appealing to other causes (say,\nz\u2019s causing x to cause y), the PSR\nalso demands an account of what it is in virtue of which x\nand y are causally related, as opposed to being\nmerely sequentially ordered (or an account of why mere sequential\nordering is sufficient for causal relatedness). That is, the PSR\napplies not only to facts about existence, but also to facts about\nrelations between existents. (This point will be extremely important\nfor correctly understanding Spinoza\u2019s modal theory in section 2\nbelow.) The PSR asks not only for an explanation of the fact that\nx causes y in terms of prior first-order causes, but\nalso for an explanation of why there is a causal relation of\ndependence between x and y and why it is not some\nother kind of relation. As it would not get us very far to answer by\nappealing to yet further first-order causal relations, the PSR is\nreally demanding an account of causation itself. Causation, if the PSR\nis true, cannot be a primitive metaphysical relation. So, to echo a\nquestion that lingers today, just what is causation? (For more on the\ncontemporary discussion, see the entry on the\n metaphysics of causation.\n For more on the PSR and causation, see Della Rocca (2010)).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Spinoza does not treat causation as a metaphysical\nprimitive. Instead, he provides an account of causation in terms of\nsomething else. In Id1, Spinoza defines self-causation (causa\nsui) as \u201cthat whose essence involves existence or\n[sive] that whose nature cannot be conceived except as\nexisting.\u201d (Spinoza\u2019s sive should not be read in\na disjunctive sense, nor is it usually stating a mere equivalence.\nWhat follows the \u201cor\u201d is often a fuller account of what\nprecedes it. Think of it as an \u201cor better yet\u2026\u201d)\nExpanding his definition to cover causation in general,\nSpinoza\u2019s idea is that causation is a matter of\n\u201cinvolvement\u201d or conceptual connection. If x\ncauses y, this fact obtains in virtue of a conceptual\nconnection between the concept of x and the concept of\n y.[3]\n Spinoza frequently suggests that the conceiving through\nrelation is the paradigm of explanation (e.g., Ia5, IIp5, IIp7s). If\nso, then we can understand why Spinoza thinks causes serve as\nsufficient explanatory reasons for facts about existence. If causal\nrelations are conceptual relations, and if conceptual relations are\nparadigms of explanation, then to give an account of an object\u2019s\nexistence in terms of its causes is to explain the fact that it exists\nin just the way the PSR demands.\n\nLet us apply this point to the case of substances. Spinoza reasons\nthat existing substances exist in virtue of having causes that bring\nabout and explain their existence, and non-existing substances do not\nexist in virtue of causes that prevent their existence and explain\ntheir non-existence (Ip14). According to Spinoza\u2019s account of\ncausation, this means that existing substances exist in virtue of\nconceptual relations to whatever explains their existence, and,\nsimilarly, conceptual relations explain the non-existence of\nnon-existing substances. What causes or explains the existence or\nnon-existence of a substance?\n\nSpinoza argues that substances are conceptually, and hence causally,\nisolated from one another (Ip2\u2013Ip5). He infers from this that\nsubstances cannot be caused to exist or be prevented from existing by\nany other substance (Ip6). But since all existing substances must\nnonetheless have causes and reasons for their existence, the fact that\na substance exists must be explained entirely by the substance itself.\nThat is, all existing substances must be self-caused and hence\nself-explained (Ip7). For parallel reasons, the non-existence of a\nnon-existing substance must be explained solely through facts about\nthe non-existing substance. The concepts of non-existing substances\nmust include the explanation for their own non-existence. What about\nthe concept of a non-existing substance could explain that\nsubstance\u2019s non-existence? Spinoza\u2019s answer: a\nself-contradiction. Non-existing substances do not exist for the same\nreason that squared circles do not exist in Euclidean space: they are\nconceptually impossible (Ip11d). From the fact of non-existence plus\nthe PSR, Spinoza concludes that non-existing substances do not exist\nbecause it is impossible for them to exist. They cannot cause\nthemselves to exist because their very concepts contain a\ncontradiction, and facts about causation track facts about conceptual\ninvolvement and explanation.\n\nSo, returning to our opening questions, could there have been more\nsubstances than there in fact are? Spinoza\u2019s answer is\n\u201cno,\u201d which means that there are no merely\npossible substances. A substance either exists or its existence\nis impossible. Could an existing substance have failed to exist?\nAgain, Spinoza\u2019s answer is \u201cno,\u201d since the only\navailable explanatory basis for its possible non-existence would be\nfacts about the substance itself. But if an existing substance is\ncompletely causally isolated, what could bring about its\nnon-existence? Only itself, Spinoza answers, which would amount\nto the concept of that substance containing an internal contradiction\nthat would prevent such a substance from existing in the first place\n(Ip7). Spinoza even denies that a substance could exist for a\ncertain length of time and then go out of existence, since that\nwould imply that it caused its own self-destruction, a violation\nof Spinoza\u2019s doctrine that \u201cNo thing can be destroyed\nexcept through an external cause\u201d (IIIp4). In reaching all of\nthese conclusions, Spinoza relies on the self-explaining or\nself-causing nature of substances and the explanatory demands of the\nPSR. Spinoza concludes that for any existing substance, it could not\nhave failed to exist nor can it cease to exist. Hence, if a substance\nexists, it necessarily exists (Ip7d). On the other hand, if a\nsubstance does not exist, its existence is impossible. Combining these\nconclusions, we reach (1): every possible substance necessarily\nexists.\n\nHere is a sketch of the main steps of this argument:\n\nThere must be a sufficient reason why each existing substance\nexists and a sufficient reason why non-existing substances do not\nexist [PSR; see Ip11d].\nCauses provide necessary and sufficient reasons for the existence\nand non-existence of substances [nature of causation and PSR; see\nIp11d].\nSubstances are causally isolated [Ip6].\nIf a substance exists, it is self-caused [3\u20135; see\nIp7].\nIf a substance is self-caused, its existence is necessary [nature\nof necessity and self-causation; see Ip7d and Id1].\nIf a substance exists, it necessarily exists [6\u20137].\nIf a substance does not exist, its non-existence is explained\nentirely by facts about the concept of its nature [3\u20135 and\nnature of causation; see Ip11d].\nIf facts about the concept of a thing\u2019s nature entirely\nexplains its non-existence, then the concept of its nature contains a\ncontradiction [nature of concepts and explanation; see Ip11d].\nIf a substance does not exist, then the concept of its nature\ncontains a contradiction [9\u201310].\nIf the concept of a thing\u2019s nature contains a contradiction,\nthen its existence is not possible [intuition; see Ip11d].\nIf a substance does not exist, then its existence is not possible\n[11\u201312]\n\n\nTherefore, every possible substance necessarily exists [8 and\n13].\n\n\nThe second major stage of Spinoza\u2019s argument is to prove that\nGod is the only possible substance. We will not here rehearse all the\ndetails of Spinoza\u2019s argument to this conclusion (for\ntwo discussions, see Lin 2007 and Della Rocca 2001). Like his\nargument for (1), Spinoza\u2019s argument for (2) relies on the PSR.\nHere is one sketch of Spinoza\u2019s overall argument for (2):\n\nAt least one substance\n exists.[4]\nThe concept of God is the concept of the most real substance with\nthe most power and greatest reason for existing [Id6, Ip9, and\nIp11d].\nThe concept of God is internally consistent [assumption].\nIt would be inexplicable if the internally consistent concept of\nthe most real substance with the most power and greatest reason for\nexisting was not instantiated while the concept of a substance with\nless power and less reason for existing was instantiated [Ip11d].\nNothing is inexplicable [PSR].\nTherefore, the concept of God is instantiated [14\u201318].\nTherefore, God necessarily exists [1 and 19].\nThe existence of God and the existence of other substances are not\ncompossible [20 and Ip5].\n\n\nTherefore, God is the only possible substance [20\u201321].\n\n\nOf these steps, premise (16) is the one for which Spinoza offers the\nleast explicit justification:\n\nSince, then, there can be, outside the divine nature, no reason or\ncause which takes away the divine existence, the reason [for its\nnon-existence] will necessarily have to be in his nature itself, if\nindeed he does not exist. That is, his nature would involve a\ncontradiction. But it is absurd to affirm this of a Being\nabsolutely infinite and supremely perfect (Ip11d, emphasis mine).\n\n\nThe absurdity Spinoza points to is actually the absurdity of the\nnon-existence of a being according to whose concept it is\ninfinite and supremely perfect. But why accept that the concept of\nSpinoza\u2019s God is internally consistent? If Spinoza fails to\njustify this assumption, his ontological argument would fall victim to\nLeibniz\u2019s complaint that even if otherwise successful,\n(pre-Leibnizian) ontological arguments prove only a hypothetical\ntruth: if God is a possible substance, then God necessarily\nexists. Spinoza\u2019s argument, absent a justification of (16),\nfails to establish the possibility of God before asserting the\nnecessity of God\u2019s existence.\n\nEven worse, Spinoza faces an especially thorny problem in justifying\n(16). For his account of the concept of God in (15) relies on\ncommitments that even those friendly to theism, such as Descartes,\nwould reject. Spinoza defines God in Id6 as \u201ca substance\nconsisting of an infinity of attributes, of which each one expresses\nan eternal and infinite essence.\u201d Spinoza claims in Ip9, without\nany explicit argument, \u201cThe more reality or being each thing\n[unaquaeque res] has, the more attributes belong to\nit.\u201d This definition of God and the supporting principle in Ip9\nwere highly controversial. According to Descartes, a substance cannot\nhave more than one (principal)\n attribute.[5]\n To say that the concept of God is the concept of a substance with\nmultiple (principal) attributes is, in fact, to appeal to an\ninternally inconsistent concept. So, the objection runs, not only has\nSpinoza failed to justify (16), but (15) is outright false.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s defense of (15) would likely be to appeal to the\nself-containment of each attribute (Della Rocca 2001). Like substance,\neach attribute is a wholly self-contained and self-sufficient way of\nconceiving substance (Ip10). Given such rigid containment, Spinoza\nwould press, how could the fact that a substance has one attribute\npreclude that substance from having additional attributes? If there\nare no explanatory or conceptual relations between the attribute of\nthought and the attribute of extension, the fact that a substance is\nthinking cannot explain why that substance could not also be extended.\nThe lack of a reason for excluding an attribute is part of\nSpinoza\u2019s reason for including all possible attributes\nas attributes of God. However, even if he can defend the rigid\nself-containment of attributes, Spinoza will also need a positive\nreason for including them all together as attributes of a single\nsubstance.\n\nThis brings us back to Ip9 and the other objectionable aspect of (16).\nWhy should perfection or reality and strength of reason to exist\ncorrespond to possessing a greater number of attributes? Spinoza does\nnot offer any explicit defense of this correlation. The demonstration\nof Ip9 simply refers readers back to the definition of an attribute\n(see also Ep9). Here is one possible way Spinoza might motivate the\ncorrelation between number of attributes and perfection / reason for\nexisting. The principle in Ip9 may be that to the extent to which a\nsingle thing [unaquaeque res] can be expressed by a\ngreater number of attributes, to that extent it is more perfect, and\nhence is more real (IId6) and has greater reason for existing (Ip11s).\nSpinoza\u2019s emphatic \u201cunaquaeque\u201d may point to the\nidea that perfection involves both unity and diversity. To\nthe degree to which one and the same thing can sustain a greater\nvariety of expressions of it, to that extent it is more perfect. The\nmaximal perfection and reality of God, on this account, is partly\nconstituted by the fact that God\u2019s self-identity is compatible\nwith a plentitude of incommensurable expressions \u2013 infinitely\nmany attributes \u2013 of it. This view of metaphysical perfection,\none which tries to maximize both identity and diversity, is very\nsimilar to Leibniz\u2019s account of perfection as harmony,\na principle that Leibniz explains as \u201cdiversity compensated by\n identity.\u201d[6]\n On this reading, God\u2019s metaphysical perfection for Spinoza is\nthe perfection of Leibniz\u2019s most harmonious world, the\nperfection of maintaining both the one and the many (Newlands\n2018).\n\nWhether or not Spinoza fully succeeds in defending the consistency of\nhis concept of God, the striking modal conclusion he draws from it is\nclear: \u201cExcept God, no substance can be or be conceived\u201d\n(Ip14). This statement captures Spinoza\u2019s substance monism and\nhis substance necessitarianism: there is only one possible substance,\nGod, and that substance necessarily exists.\n",
