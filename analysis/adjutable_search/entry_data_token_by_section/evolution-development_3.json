    "main_text": "Conceptual partings and unifications of evolution and development || The integration of proximate and ultimate causes\n2.2 The integration of proximate and ultimate causes\n\nThere has been constant criticism of the proximate-ultimate\ndistinction (since even before Mayr 1961), and against its underlying\nidea to downgrade the explanatory or causal relevance of development\nto evolution. More recently, the discussion of this issue gained pace\nthrough new findings in fields such as epigenetics, evo-devo and niche\nconstruction theory (Thierry 2005; Laland et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b;\nHaig 2011, 2013; Scott-Phillips et al. 2011; Dickins & Rahman\n2012; Guerrero-Bosagna 2012; Calcott 2013; Dickins & Barton 2013;\nGardner 2013; Mesoudi et al. 2013; Mart\u00ednez & Esposito\n2014; Scholl & Pigliucci 2015; Baedke 2018; Uller & Laland\n2019). In this context, some scholars argue that the\nproximate-ultimate distinction stands \u201cat the center of some of\ncontemporary biology\u2019s fiercest debates\u201d (Laland et al.\n2011: 1512) about the role of developmental plasticity, niche\nconstruction and inclusive inheritance for evolutionary trajectories.\nParticipants in this debate have argued that we should, due to\ndifferent epistemic or heuristic reasons, keep Mayr\u2019s\nproximate-ultimate distinction (Scott-Phillips et al. 2011; Dickins\n& Barton 2013) or a revised or reinterpreted form of it (Scholl\n& Pigliucci 2015; Otsuka 2015), expand it by a third intermediate\nform of explanations (Haig 2013), or replace it with a concept of\n\u2018reciprocal causation\u2019 (Laland et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b,\n2015; Mesoudi et al. 2013). In line with earlier philosophical work\n(Oyama 1985; Keller 2010; Griffiths & Stotz 2013), the latter idea\nof reciprocal causation should allow describing the feedback processes\nbetween causal factors in evolving systems. This includes\norganisms\u2019 capacity of phenotypic plasticity or, more\nspecifically, their activities to alter selection pressures.\nParadigmatic feedback cases are niche construction behaviors of\norganisms that modify their environments and thus shape natural\nselection pressures working on them. In other words, reciprocal\ncausation holds that organisms are not only effects of adaptive\nprocesses, but also causal starting points of evolutionary\ntrajectories. In this sense this framework argues against the causal\nand/or explanatory asymmetry claim of the proximate-ultimate\ndistinction. It highlights the important role of development for\nevolution.\n\nAgainst this new approach, scholars have argued that reciprocal\ncausation does, in fact, not pose any conceptual challenges for\nevolutionary biology, as it has been included since quite some time\nago in the field (Svennson 2018). A true challenge, however, is to\ndevelop this idea into a methodologically sound framework that allows\nstudying and modeling complex non-linear organism-environment\nrelations. Other have cast doubt on the central causal role the unit\nof the organism is supposed to play in this reciprocity framework\n(Baedke 2019a), or questioned whether this conceptualization can, in\nfact, capture all causal dependency relations of interest for\nevolutionary biology (Mart\u00ednez & Esposito 2014; Scholl\n& Pigliucci 2015). Moreover, some argued that also this framework\nrelies on the dichotomy between development and evolution (Dickins\n& Barton 2013; Mart\u00ednez & Esposito 2014) and that it is not conducive to\nsuccessful biological science, as it does not lead to falsifiable\nquestions (Dickins & Rahman 2012) and bleeds proximate and\nultimate explanations into each other so that their distinction\nbecomes meaningless (Gardner 2013; one should mention, however, that\nthis might be the very aim of this approach). More generally, it has\nbeen requested that advocates of this approach should provide more\nconceptual clarifications on what reciprocal causation actually is\nsupposed to mean (Buskell 2019).\n\nBesides distinguishing development and evolution in a qualitative\nmanner as proximate and ultimate causal processes, a less common\nattempt is to quantitatively distinguish (or relate) the two. Here,\nespecially distinctions based on the rates or time scales on which\ndifferent developmental and biological processes occur have been made\n(see the entry\n levels of organization in biology).\n For example, Conrad H. Waddington (1957) developed a hierarchical\nmodel of time scales that includes biochemical processes on lower\nmolecular levels of organization with a faster rate, medium paced\nprocesses of development on a medium level, and evolutionary processes\non higher levels with a slower rate. According to such a view,\nevolutionary processes are simply processes occurring with a different\nrate and thus at a different level than developmental ones. Thus, they\ndiffer gradually rather than in kind. Rate-based distinctions have\nbeen described to be consistent with the ultimate-proximate framework\n(when interpreting it as one that distinguishes different timescales\nof phenotypic change; see Francis 1990; Haig 2013) or as different\nfrom proximate-ultimate distinctions (Baedke & Mc Manus 2018). In\naddition, time-scale (or size-scale) conceptualizations have been\napplied for developing methodologies and multi-scale modeling that\nintegrate, among others, developmental and evolutionary processes (S.\nLevin 1992; Green & Batterman 2017; Duckworth 2019).\n",
