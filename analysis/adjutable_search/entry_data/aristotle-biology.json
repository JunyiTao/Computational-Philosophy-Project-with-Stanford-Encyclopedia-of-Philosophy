    "preamble": "\n\nAristotle is properly recognized as the originator of the scientific\nstudy of life. This is true despite the fact that many earlier Greek\nnatural philosophers occasionally speculated on the origins of living\nthings and much of the Hippocratic medical corpus, which was written\nbefore or during Aristotle\u2019s lifetime, displays a serious\ninterest in human anatomy, physiology and pathology. And Plato has\nTimaeus, in the eponymous dialogue, devote a considerable part of his\nspeech to the human body and its functions (and malfunctions).\nNevertheless, before Aristotle, only a few of the Hippocratic\ntreatises are both systematic and empirical, and their focus is almost\nexclusively on human health and disease.\n\nBy contrast, Aristotle considered the investigation of living things,\nand especially animals, central to the theoretical study of nature.\nConstituting roughly 25% of the extant corpus, his zoological writings\nprovide a theoretical defense of the proper method for\nbiological investigation; and they provide a record of the first\nsystematic and comprehensive study of animals. There was nothing of\nsimilar scope and sophistication again until the 16th\ncentury. In the nineteenth century the great anatomist Richard Owen\nintroduced a two lecture survey of Aristotle\u2019s zoological\nstudies by declaring that \u201cZoological Science sprang from his\n[Aristotle\u2019s] labours, we may almost say, like Minerva from the\nHead of Jove, in a state of noble and splendid maturity\u201d (Owen\n1992, 91). Before examining this remarkable achievement, a few words\nabout its creator are in\n order.[1].\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Work\n\nAristotle was born in Stagira on the northern Aegean coast in 384BCE.\nHis father Nicomachus was physician to King Amyntas III of Macedon,\nand his mother was of a wealthy family from the island of Euboea. He\nwas sent at the age of 17 to Athens, where he studied in Plato\u2019s\nAcademy for 20 years, until Plato\u2019s death in 347. By then he had\ndeveloped his own distinctive philosophical ideas, including his\npassion for the study of nature. He joined a philosophical circle in\nAssos on the coast of Asia Minor, but soon moved to the nearby island\nof Lesbos where he met Theophrastus, a young man with similar\ninterests in natural science. Between the two of them they originated\nthe science of biology, Aristotle carrying out a systematic\ninvestigation of animals, Theophrastus doing the same for plants.\n\nIn 343 Aristotle was asked by Philip II of Macedon to tutor his son\nAlexander. By 335 he had returned to Athens, now under the control of\nhis former student Alexander. With Theophrastus he founded a\n\u2018school\u2019 in a public sanctuary known as the Lyceum. He\nheaded the Lyceum until the death of Alexander the Great in 323. With\nanti-Macedonian feelings running high in Athens, Aristotle retired to\nhis mother\u2019s birthplace. He died there in 322BCE.\n\nThe surviving corpus of Aristotle derives from medieval manuscripts\nbased on a 1st century BCE edition. There were no\ncommentaries on the biological works written until they were\ncollectively translated into Arabic. The first appearance of\nAristotle\u2019s biological writings in the West are Latin\ntranslations, by Michael Scot, of an Arabic edition, which forms the\nbasis of Albertus Magnus\u2019 De animalibus. In the\n13th century, William of Moerbeke produced a Latin\ntranslation directly from the Greek. The first printed editions and\ntranslations date to the late 15th century, the most widely\ncirculated being that of Theodorus Gaza. In addition to the three\nworks traditionally referred to as History of Animals\n(HA), Parts of Animals (PA) and\nGeneration of Animals (GA), there are a number of\nbriefer \u2018essays\u2019 on more specialized topics: On animal\nmotion, On animal locomotion, On respiration,\nOn life and death, On youth and old age, On\nlength and shortness of life, On sleeping and waking,\nOn the senses and their objects (the last six being included\nin the so-called Parva naturalia). Whether one should\nconsider De Anima (On the soul) part of this project\nor not is a difficult question. What is certainly clear, however, is\nthat there are important connections between the theoretical approach\nto the relationship between body and soul defended in that work and\nthe distinctive way that Aristotle approaches the investigation of\nanimals.\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle\u2019s distinctive approach to the\nstudy of living things, it is imperative to situate it within his\nnatural philosophy and his philosophy of science. The first book of\nAristotle\u2019s Parts of Animals is, in fact, largely\ndevoted to doing just that, and after a brief discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s general views about scientific inquiry and\nexplanation, we will turn to it.\n2. Aristotle\u2019s Philosophy of Science\n\nIn sections 4, 5 and 6, we will explore the ways in which Aristotle\nsystematically organizes and explains an extraordinary body of\ninformation about animal anatomy, physiology and development. But\nAristotle was able to accomplish what he did in zoology because he had\ngiven a great deal of thought to the nature of scientific inquiry. How\ndoes one progress from the superficial and unorganized state of\neveryday experience toward organized scientific knowledge? To answer\nthis question, you need a concept of the goal to be achieved, and\nAristotle developed such a concept in his Prior and\nPosterior Analytics (henceforth abbreviated as APr.\nand APo., respectively). The goal of scientific inquiry, he\nargued, was a system of concepts and propositions organized\nhierarchically, ultimately resting on knowledge of the essential\nnatures of the objects of study and certain other necessary first\nprinciples. These definitions and principles form the basis of causal\nexplanations of all the other universal truths within the domain of\nstudy. Those other universal truths should identify attributes\nbelonging to a subject per se, in virtue of that\nsubject\u2019s nature. The example he uses when he introduces his\naccount of scientific demonstration to illustrate such propositions is\nfrom geometry: having interior angles equal to two right angles\nbelongs to all and only triangles in virtue of their being triangles\n(APo. I 4, 5). This attribute belongs to all\nequilateral triangles as well\u2014not, however, because\nthey are equilateral, but because they are triangles. Thus\nscientific knowledge of such a proposition, knowledge that displays\nthe reason why any triangle has this property, must explain why this\nproperty belongs to triangles as such. The explanation, of\ncourse, will appeal to the essential character of three-sided\nrectilinear plane figures, i.e. to what it is to be a triangle.\n\nThe second book of the Posterior Analytics discusses\nhow to achieve this goal of scientific knowledge, one central\nconcern being how knowledge of essences, expressed in definitions, is\nrelated to explanations expressed in the form of causal\ndemonstrations. Plato had formulated a famous paradox of inquiry in\nhis dialogue Meno: either you know the object of your\ninquiry, in which case inquiry is unnecessary; or you don\u2019t know\nthe object of your inquiry, in which case inquiry is impossible\n(Meno 80d5-e5). Aristotle reminds us of this paradox in the\nfirst chapter of the Posterior Analytics, but his full\nsolution only emerges in book II. There, he argues that perceptual\nexperience gives us a grasp of the target of inquiry that, though it\ndoes not count as scientific knowledge, does serve to direct further\ninquiry. He begins the discussion by presenting us with a claim about\nhow objects of inquiry are linked to objects of scientific\nknowledge.\n\nThe things about which we inquire are equal in number to the things we\nknow scientifically. We inquire about four things: the fact,\nthe reason why, if something is, what something\nis. (APo. II 1, 89b23\u201325)\n\n\nAristotle conceives of these four inquiries as paired, and\nthere is a natural sequence in each pair. Knowing that some\nstate of affairs is the case, we can inquire into the reason why it is\nthe case.\n\nWhen we know the fact we inquire about the reason\nwhy (e.g., knowing that it is eclipsed or that\nthe earth moves, we inquire into the reason why it is\neclipsed or why the earth moves). (APo. II 1,\n89b29\u201331)\n\n\nSimilarly, if we conclude an inquiry into whether something exists, we\ncan go on to investigate its nature, what it is.\n\nAnd having come to know that it is, we inquire what\nit is (e.g.: Then what is a god? Or what is a man?). (APo. II\n1, 89b34\u201335)\n\n\nThe examples reveal a distinction that structures much of the\ndiscussion for the next ten chapters. For it looks as if\n\u2018factual\u2019 inquiries concern whether some attribute belongs\nto some subject (movement to the earth, eclipse to the moon), and the\nsearch for the reason why will be a search for the causal explanation\nof the attribute belonging to that subject. By contrast, it looks like\nthe move from \u2018if\u2019 to \u2018what\u2019 is a move from\nestablishing the existence of some subject (\u2018god\u2019,\n\u2018man\u2019) to establishing what it is.\n\nHowever, the distinction is not, it turns out, so clear-cut. Having\nbegun to illustrate the distinction between inquiry if or\nwhether something is and what it is with the\nquestion \u2018whether there is or is not a centaur or a god\u2019,\nhe then characterizes the knowledge achieved as \u2018knowing\nthat it is\u2019. And in the second chapter, he begins to\nlink the two sequences of inquiry by means of his syllogistic concept\nof \u201cmiddle term,\u201d the term that is common to the two\npremises in a syllogistic proof.\n\nThus it results that in all our research we seek either\nif there is a middle term or what the middle term is. For the\nmiddle term is the cause, and this is in every case what is\nsought. (APo. II 2, 90a7\u20139)\n\n\nThat is, in any valid syllogistic inference, the middle term shared by\nthe premises is the warrant for the conclusion. In scientific\nexplanation, however, the middle term must also identify the\ncause of the fact given in the conclusion\u2014what that term\nidentifies is the causal link between the subject and attribute. To\nuse another of his common examples, if we seek to explain the periodic\nsound of noise in the clouds, the middle term must identify the cause\nof the connection between that noise and those clouds. Moreover, on\nAristotle\u2019s account of the relationship between causal\ndemonstration and scientific definition, knowing the cause of\nthunder is at the same time knowing the essence of thunder,\nwhat thunder really is.\n\nThere is a difference between saying why it thunders and what thunder\nis. In the one case you will say: Because the fire is extinguished in\nthe clouds. But: What is thunder?\u2014A noise of fire being\nextinguished in the clouds. Hence the same account is given in\ndifferent ways: in one way it is a continuous demonstration, in the\nother a definition. (APo. II 10, 94a4\u20138)\n\n\nIn the APo., Aristotle returns regularly to such standard\nexamples of natural phenomena as thunder and eclipses\u2014but he\nalso, and importantly, provides an extended biological example, the\nseasonal loss of leaves in broad-leafed\n plants.[2]\n In ch. 16, Aristotle imagines an inquiry that begins with questions\nsuch as \u2018Why do fig trees and grape vines lose their\nleaves?\u2019. The model answer is \u2018Because they are both\nbroad-leafed.\u2019 That is, the inquiry seeks some other feature,\ncommon to both kinds, related to the target of inquiry, the\nseasonal loss of leaves. The \u2018because\u2019 is, however,\npreliminary\u2014it is best to see being broad-leafed as a step\ntoward causal explanation. Chapter 17 picks up the example, in the\ncontext of arguing that basic scientific inquiry seeks, wherever\npossible, co-extensive predications, which those between leaf\nloss and fig trees, or leaf loss and grape vines, are not. The\ncandidate major premise, however\u2014\u2018Whatever is broad-leafed\nloses its leaves\u2019\u2014does identify a co-extensive\nrelationship between subject and predicate. It may thus serve as a\nproper scientific explanandum, and \u2018broad-leafed\u2019\ncan serve to identify a kind, all and only the members of which lose\ntheir\n leaves.[3]\n Thus, the middle term of the preliminary explanation becomes the\nsubject of a more basic, co-extensive predication. The cause\nof broad-leafed trees losing their leaves will, then, be something\nmore fundamental about broad-leafed trees, here identified as the\nsolidification of moisture at the leaf juncture, which can thus serve\nas the middle term in a causal explanation of this fact. But it will\nalso serve as part of a definition of leaf loss.\n\nThe middle is the account of the first major term [i.e. the predicate\nin the conclusion], for which reason all the sciences come about\nthrough definition. (APo. II 17, 99a22\u201323)\n\n\nThat is, we will have, if our research goes well, an account of what\nloss of leaves is. Along the way a process of identifying the kind,\nall and only the members of which will lose their leaves due to sap\ncoagulation, is assumed. Yet the Analytics provides no\nsystematic discussion about whether there are general criteria for\nidentifying these basic scientific kinds. As we will see, this is the\ntopic of one of the most interesting sections of On the Parts of\nAnimals, book I.\n\nThere are two quite different questions we need to ask about how these\nideas about inquiry and explanation in the Analytics are\nrelated to Aristotle\u2019s investigations of animals: first, how is\nthe philosophy of biology presented in PA I related\nto the general account of explanation, definition and inquiry in the\nPosterior\n Analytics[4];\n and second, to what extent do the treatises reporting his actual\ninvestigations of animals conform either to his general account of\nscientific knowledge and inquiry in APo., or to the norms\nregarding the study of animals laid down in PA I. The\nremainder of this entry will be organized around these two\nquestions.\n3. Caveat lector\n\nFirst some preliminary remarks are in order about what we\nare\u2014and are not\u2014discussing. It seems obvious, once stated,\nthat the actual activity of studying animals is different from the\nactivity of writing or teaching about animals based on that study. We\nhave access to a number of Aristotle\u2019s systematically organized\nwritings on animals; we do not have direct access to his\nactual investigations. Some authors studied by historians of science\ndiscuss, in their written work, the methods they used to gather the\ninformation and work out their theoretical ideas and even provide\n\u2018diaries\u2019 describing their day-to-day\nstudies\u2014Aristotle is not one of them. Nor did anyone else report\nobserving Aristotle carrying out his studies. There are reasonable\ninferences we can make from his writings; for example that he\nconsulted with bee-keepers, fishermen and sponge divers, that he (or\nsomeone under his guidance) performed a great many dissections on a\nwide variety of animals, that there were at least some diagrams\nproduced based on these dissections, and so on. Moreover, on the\nquestion of how he reasoned to specific explanations we can\nmake some reasonable inferences from things he says about proper\nmethods of biological inquiry. But it is important to keep in mind\nthat we are studying texts that present, in a highly structured and\ntheoretical manner, the results of an actual investigation,\nthe details of which we know very little.\n\nIt is also unclear what is the intent of the texts we do have\nthat report on these investigations. It is sometimes said they are\n\u2018lecture notes\u2019. That seems pretty clearly wrong; they are\ntoo carefully written and structured. But it does seem clear, from\ncross-references, that some of them were to be studied in a certain\norder, and this order may conform to a course of study in the\nLyceum. Interestingly, while all of the other biological treatises\nrefer for further information to \u2018the animal\ninquiries\u2019,that is to something like the History of\nAnimals that has come down to us, often in conjunction with\n\u2018the dissections\u2019, our History of Animals has no\nreferences to the other, explanatory studies. This suggests that the\n\u2018inquiries and dissections\u2019 had a different function in\nsuch a course of study, perhaps something akin to \u2018reference\nworks\u2019.\n\nFinally, it is also worth recalling that the series of treatises we\nhave was likely compiled hundreds of years after Aristotle\u2019s\ndeath from whatever he left. It seems unlikely we will ever be able to\ndetermine the exact relationship between the so-called\n\u2018Andronican\u2019 edition, the likely source of our texts, and\nwhat was produced during Aristotle\u2019s lifetime.\n\nThese three caveats place constraints on what I can reasonably claim\nto be doing. I will be discussing the treatises that report the\nresults of Aristotle\u2019s investigations of animals. I will assume\nthat the texts that have been passed down to us reflect what he wrote\non this subject, and that the cross-references in those texts are his\nand reflect his own views about how these various studies are related\nto each other.\n\n4. Philosophy of Biology\n\nOn the Parts of Animals, book I (PA I) begins by\noutlining its purpose, which is to establish a set of standards for\njudging natural investigations (639a15). Its five chapters pursue this\npurpose, discussing the appropriate level of generality for such\nstudies, the modes of causality and of necessity to be used in\nbiological explanations, the relation of form to matter in living\nthings, the proper method of logical division for this subject matter,\nthe means of identifying kinds and their activities at the proper\nlevel of abstraction, and much more. Two sorts of evidence support the\nconclusion that this book is intended to deal with problems and\nquestions that arise in the application of Aristotle\u2019s general\nphilosophy of science, found in the Posterior Analytics, to\nhis theoretical investigation of living nature.\n\nThe first kind of evidence consists of passages introducing his\nbiological investigations that appear to make explicit reference to\nthe account of scientific knowledge in APo. The following\npassage from the History of Animals (a better though less\nfamiliar translation would be Animal Inquiries), for example,\nsuggests that the entire biological project is organized in accordance\nwith the theory of inquiry developed in APo. II. This passage\ncomes near the end of chapter six in the first book of HA.\nAfter five chapters in which Aristotle lays out the kinds of\nsimilarities and differences among animals to be studied and sketches\nthe ways in which they are to be investigated, he makes the following\nprogrammatic statement about the investigation to come, and where it\nfits in the entire scientific study of animals.\n\nThese things, then, have now been said by way of outline to provide a\ntaste of what things need to be studied, and what it is about them\nthat needs to be studied, in order that we may first grasp the\ndifferences and the attributes belonging to all animals. After we do\nthis, we must attempt to discover the causes. For it is natural to\ncarry out the investigation in this way, beginning with the inquiry\ninto each thing; for from these inquiries it becomes clear both about\nwhich things (peri h\u00f4n) the demonstration\n(t\u00ean apodeixin) should be and from which things\n(ex h\u00f4n) it should proceed. (HA I 6,\n491a7\u201314)\n\n\nThe natural way to proceed, then, is to begin with inquiry\n(historia), with the aim of grasping the differences between,\nand attributes of, all the animals; and then to attempt to\ndiscover their causes. This is natural because, given that our goal is\ndemonstrative understanding, we want to end up with a clear\ndistinction between the facts to be explained (the peri\nh\u00f4n) and their explanation (the ex\nh\u00f4n). This statement echoes the summary, in\nAPo. I 10, of the components of demonstrative knowledge:\n\nNevertheless there are by nature these three [components of\ndemonstrative knowledge]: that about which (peri ho) it\nproves, what it proves, and those things from which (ex\nh\u00f4n) it proves. (76b21\u201322)\n\n\nThe History of Animals characterizes itself as establishing\nthe attributes and the differences that belong to all animals, and\nclaims that by carrying out this inquiry we are prepared to go on to\nsearch for the causes. Indeed, he appears to suggest that a successful\nhistoria or factual inquiry will prepare us to grasp the\ndifference between those facts that need to be explained and those\nthat will be invoked in our explanations. In the language of the\nPosterior Analytics: HA establishes the\nfact, e.g. that all animals with lungs have\nwindpipes, or that all cetacea have lungs and are viviparous,\ntypically seeking to identify groups by means of discovering\nco-extensive differentiae with the aid of the method of\n division.[5]\n The proper use of division, moreover, will give clear indications of\nwhich predications are basic and which derivative. Works such as\nParts of Animals or Generation of Animals, on the\nother hand, seek to establish the reason why\u2014the cause\u2014of\nthe fact. If Aristotle is following the method described in the\nAnalytics, these causal explanations should at the same time\npoint us to essential definitions of what it is to be a windpipe or to\nbe viviparous. It is a question currently much debated whether\ndefinition was, in fact, an explicit goal of HA or simply a\nconsequence of the explanatory goal clearly identified in the above\npassage from HA I 6; and if so, whether definitions of animal\nkinds were sought, or only definitions of their attributes.\nAs we will see, there are a number of chapter summaries in the\nexplanatory treatises that make a point of claiming that both\nan explanation of why a part is found in those animals that\nhave it, and an account of what that part is, have\nbeen provided; but one must work very hard to reconstruct any\ndefinitions of animal kinds in those treatises.\n [6]\n\nA number of texts in Aristotle\u2019s causal investigations reinforce\nthe message of HA I 6, stressing that the preliminary work of\ninquiries that establish and organize the facts at various levels of\ngenerality has been accomplished; and they regularly refer to\nsomething like what is reported in our HA as the place to\nlook for the results of this preliminary work. Two explicit statements\nto that effect follow, one from the beginning of his study of the\ncauses of the differences in animal locomotion, one from the beginning\nof his study of the causes of the differences among the parts of\nanimals.\n\nClearly there needs to be a study of all of these questions about\nanimal locomotion and any others of the same kind; for that\n(hoti) these things are thus is clear from our inquiries into\nnature (t\u00eas historias t\u00eas phusik\u00eas);\nthe reason why (dioti) must now be investigated.\n(IA 1, 704b7\u201310)\n\n\nFrom which parts and from how many parts each of the animals is\nconstituted has been exhibited more clearly in the inquiries about\nthem (en tais historiais tais peri aut\u00f4n); it is the\ncauses owing to which each animal has this character that\nmust now be examined, on their own and apart (chorisantas\nkath\u2019hauta) from what was said in the inquiries.\n(PA II 1, 646a8\u201312)\n\n\nEach of these passages explicitly describes the study of animals with\nwhich Aristotle is engaged in the language of Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof research in APo. II 1. Indeed, the passage from\nHA I 6 does so by insisting that the natural\nmethod to use is to first get clear on the differences and\nattributes to be demonstrated (\u2018establish the fact\nthat\u2026\u2019) before going on to find the causes\n(\u2018the reason why, i.e. the cause\u2019) to be appealed to in\nthese demonstrations. Animal inquiries (historiai) are a kind\nof hoti inquiry\u2014that is, the History of\nAnimals presents the facts to be explained, organized so as to be\nprepared for causal\n demonstration.[7]\n\nThe IA and PA, on the other hand, refer to\nthemselves as pursuing a causal inquiry into the reason\nwhy the various kinds of animals are differentiated as they\nare, and they acknowledge that they are able to do this precisely\nbecause the factual investigation into the locomotion and parts of\nanimals has been accomplished. In both cases Aristotle emphasizes the\ndistinction on which we are focused, perhaps in order to remind his\nreaders of his philosophy of scientific research.\n\nThere is a second line of evidence, quite independent of these\nprogrammatic statements, which leads to the same conclusion. The\ntopics covered in PA I take the form of specifications of the\ncentral topics of the Posterior Analytics. These\nspecifications are required because animals are [a] complex unities of\nmatter (body) and form (soul); [b] arise by a complex process of\ndevelopment; [c] the end\u2014that for the sake of which the\ndevelopment occurs\u2014 is both causally and definitionally prior to\nthat process; [d] a distinctive kind of necessity, conditional\nnecessity, is operative; and [e] a special method of\nmulti-differentiae division is required. Such a discussion is required\nby the fact that although the Posterior Analytics intends its\nepistemic standards to be applicable to natural science \u2013 as is\nclear from the many examples drawn from natural science in book II\n\u2013 it provides no details as to how this application is to be\naccomplished.\n\nWhat, then, does PA I tell us about the proper way to\ninvestigate animals? Aristotle begins by posing a problem about how to\nidentify the proper objects of investigation. Should we begin by\nstudying the features of groups close to the level of perception, such\nas human beings, horses, dogs and such, or should we look for\nattributes that \u2018belong in common according to kind, and then\nlater study their distinctive attributes\u2019 (639b4\u20135). He\nnotes that since there are many attributes that are common to many of\nthese more concrete kinds, focusing our study on them will have the\nresult of our repeating ourselves\u2014much as if, to use an example\nfrom APo II discussed in Section 2, we were to remain at the\nlevel of \u2018olive trees lose their leaves\u2019, \u2018grape\nvines lose their leaves\u2019. Among these common attributes,\nAristotle distinguishes those that seem not to differ across the kinds\nthat have them (he cites respiration and death) from those that are\n\u2018 distinctive in form \u2019 such as locomotion. As he puts it:\n\u201cit is apparent that locomotion is not one in form, because\nflying, swimming, walking, and crawling differ\u201d (639b1\u20132).\nAristotle deals with this question, so reminiscent of APo. I\n4\u20135, in PA I 4, but only after he has introduced a new\nway of thinking about differentiae and division appropriate for\ninvestigating animals. After discussing his recommendations regarding\nthe use of logical division in biology, we will return to look at his\nanswer.\n\nAnimals are complex structures organized so as to be able to perform\nan integrated set of functions and activities; yet the Posterior\nAnalytics provides one with very little guidance as to how to\napply its norms to such things. Again PA I, and especially\nchapters 1 and 5, appears designed to provide that guidance. It seeks\nto establish [a] the priority of goal-causation to motive-causation,\n[b] the priority of the study of an animal\u2019s form (which, he\nargues, should be identified with its soul) to the study of its\nmaterial constituents (i.e. its body), and [c] the presence of a\nspecial kind of necessity operative where goals and form take\npriority, namely hypothetical or conditional necessity (cf.\nPA I 1, 640a10\u2013641a32, 642a1\u201331).\n\nThe argument is complicated in virtue of its manner of presentation.\nFirst, it is a narrative in which Aristotle gradually develops his own\nviews by exposing the errors of those who investigated nature before\nhim; it is structured as presenting an alternative to views expressed\nby Empedocles and Democritus, and as in the spirit of Socrates\n(642a24\u201331). Second, as is so typical of him, what initially may\nappear to be three separate narratives turn out to be a single,\ncomplex case for emphasizing the study of form, teleological\nexplanation, and conditional necessity when studying living things.\nForm, in the case of living things, turns out to be the capacity to\nperform living functions such as nutrition, perception, or locomotion,\ni.e. soul; and thus the form of a living thing is causally prior to\nthe matter, because it is the goal for the sake of which the parts of\nthe animal\u2014its matter\u2014come to be and exist. This, in turn,\nprovides us with the appropriate way to understand \u2018conditional\nnecessity\u2019\u2014parts and the processes that produce them do\nnot necessitate the outcome; on the contrary, the outcome necessitates\nthat the developmental processes bring about the parts that are\nnecessary for the organism to live its life, and do so in a temporally\nand spatially coordinated manner (cf. GA II 4,\n740b19\u201334; II 6, 743a16\u201336).\n\nChapters 2 and 3 have a similar narrative structure. Gradually, a\npositive theory of biological division emerges from the ashes of a\ndetailed critical analysis of those (Plato and certain of his\nstudents) who \u201cattempt to grasp the particular by dividing the\nkind into two differences\u201d (642b5), a practice he finds in\n\u201cthe written divisions\u201d (642b11), perhaps a reference to\ndivisions we find in some of Plato\u2019s later dialogues, or perhaps\nto lost works by other members of Plato\u2019s Academy. The method he\nis criticizing combines two basic techniques that lead to things being\ngrouped together that are fundamentally different and things being\ngrouped separately that are fundamentally similar: dichotomy and\ndivision by non-essentials. Dichotomy is the method of dividing the\nmore general differentia into two exhaustive alternatives, which often\nentails that one of the alternatives is simply the privation of the\nother (winged, wingless). Division by non-essentials involves dividing\na prior differentia-class by means of an unrelated difference. For\nexample, you might first divide animals into winged and wingless, and\nthen winged animals into wild and tame.\n\nI mean the sort of thing that results by dividing animals into the\nwingless and the winged, and winged into tame and wild, or pale and\ndark. Neither tame nor pale is a difference of winged; rather each is\nthe origin of another difference, while here it is incidental.\n(643b19\u201322)\n\n\nTo avoid the problems created by this dichotomous and arbitrary\nmethod, Aristotle recommends a method that divides each wider\ndifferentia by more and more determinate forms of that differentia\n(wings into forms of wing, beaks into forms of beak), and does so\nsimultaneously on as many differentiae as are correlated at a given\nlevel of universality.\n\nRather, one should try to take animals by kinds, following the lead of\nthe many in demarcating a bird kind and a fish kind. Each of these has\nbeen defined by many differences, not according to dichotomy.\n(643b9\u201312)\n\n\nThus, if all birds have beaks, feathers, wings of a sort, are bipedal,\netc. , the biologist needs to perform the proper sort of division on\nall of these in order to grasp the various sub-kinds of bird. This\nwill not, of course, give us demonstrative knowledge; but it will help\nus to grasp the co-extensively correlated features, at each level of\nspecificity, that are the proper things about which to seek\ndemonstrative knowledge.\n\nAn interesting feature of this extended criticism of dichotomous,\narbitrary division and the development of a systematic,\nmulti-differentiae alternative is that it takes for granted the\n\u2018naturalness\u2019 of certain kinds that \u2018the many\u2019\nhave identified. As he says above, \u2018these [birds and fish] have\nbeen defined by many differences\u2019; earlier he had said that the\nterms \u2018bird\u2019 and \u2018fish\u2019 name a\n\u2018similarity\u2019, a group of animals that are \u2018alike in\nkind\u2019 that dichotomous division inappropriately tears apart\n(642b13\u201319). During the discussion of division there is very\nlittle clarification of what underlies this notion of similarity or\nlikeness in kind. However, armed with a method of division suited to\nthe study of animals, the discussion quickly turns to the question of\nwhat it is that makes it appropriate to treat all birds or all fish as\na single kind, and to the specification of rules for identifying other\nsuch kinds. What \u2018bird\u2019 and \u2018fish\u2019 name are,\nhe claims, kinds with \u201ccommon natures, and forms not very far\napart\u201d (644b2\u20133). Prior to understanding these kinds\nthrough a scientific account of this common nature, we can\u2014as\nthe Posterior Analytics argues\u2014grasp these kinds, i.e.\ngrasp that all birds have a common\n nature.[8]\n We do this by noting that they have many general differences that\nvary in measurable ways\u2014by the more and less, as he puts it.\n\n\u2026[these kinds] are correctly defined in this way. For those\nanimals that differ by degree and the more and the less have been\nbrought together under one kind, while those that are analogous have\nbeen kept apart. I mean, for example, that bird differs from bird by\nthe more or by degree (for one has long feathers, another short\nfeathers), while fish differs from bird by analogy (for what is\nfeather in the one is scale in the other). (644a16\u201322)\n\n\nIt is with this very topic of different degrees of similarity and\ndifference of parts that the Historia Animalium begins,\nextending this way of characterizing similarity and difference\nimmediately to differences in activities, ways of life and traits of\ncharacter. (HA I 1, 486a5\u2013487a13) This is, then,\nclearly a discussion of how one achieves \u2018knowledge of the\nfact\u2019, rather than \u2018knowledge of the reason\nwhy\u2019.\n\nThe closing section of PA I (treated since the Renaissance as\nits fifth chapter) is often thought of as having two, essentially\nunrelated parts. And there is some justification for this; if one were\nto remove the first half of the chapter, one would be left with an\nargument the flows quite naturally out of the conclusion of chapter 4.\nAt that point, Aristotle states that once one has made an initial\ndivision of the attributes that belong to all the animals per\nse, the next step is to attempt \u201cto divide their\ncauses,\u201d after which he applies the analysis of sameness and\ndifference from the previous discussion of parts to the activities\nperformed by these parts. He then closes the discussion by arguing\nthat the differences we find in animal parts are to be explained by\nreference to differences found among their activities. Thus a proper\ndivision of activities is a division of the causes of the parts of\nanimals.\n\nNevertheless, a good case can be made that this \u2018chapter\u2019\nforms a coherent whole, a sort of culmination of the book. It begins\nwith perhaps the best known passage in Aristotle\u2019s biological\nworks, a stirring and beautifully crafted encomium to the joys of\nstudying animals, even the most lowly. An elegant introduction divides\nnatural beings into those that are eternal and those that partake of\ngeneration and perishing, noting that there are attractions to\nstudying both: though access to information about the former is\nlimited, he likens it to \u201c\u2026a chance, brief glimpse of the\nones we love\u201d; on the other hand the latter, perishable things\n\u201ctake the prize in respect of understanding because we know more\nof them and know them more fully\u201d and they are \u201cmore of\nour own nature\u201d (644b23\u2013645a3). He then elaborates on the\nvalue of the study of the living things around us. It is a passage\nworth quoting in full.\n\n\nSince we have completed stating the way things appear to us about the\ndivine things, it remains to speak about animal nature, omitting\nnothing in our power, whether of less or greater esteem. For even in\nthe study of animals disagreeable to perception, the nature that\ncrafted them likewise provides extraordinary pleasures to those able\nto know their causes and who are by nature philosophers. Surely it\nwould be unreasonable, even absurd, for us to enjoy studying\nlikenesses of animals\u2014on the ground that we are at the same time\nstudying the art, such as painting and sculpture, that made\nthem\u2014while not prizing even more the study of things constituted\nby nature, at least when we can behold their causes.\n\nFor this reason we should not be childishly disgusted at the\nexamination of the less valuable animals. For in all natural things\nthere is something marvelous. Even as Heraclitus is said to have\nspoken to those strangers who wished to meet him but stopped as they\nwere approaching when they saw him warming himself at the\noven\u2014he bade them to enter without fear, \u2018For there are\ngods here too\u2019\u2014so too one should approach research about\neach of the animals without disgust, since in every one there is\nsomething natural and good. For what is not haphazard but rather for\nthe sake of something is in fact present most of all in the works of\nnature; the end for the sake of which takes the place of the good. If\nsomeone considered the study of the other animals to lack value, he\nought to think the same thing about himself as well; for it is\nimpossible to look at that from which mankind has been\nconstituted\u2014blood, flesh, bones, blood vessels, and other such\nparts\u2014without considerable disgust. Just as one who discusses\nthe parts or equipment of anything should not be thought of as doing\nso in order to draw attention to the matter, nor for the sake of the\nmatter, but rather in order to draw attention to the overall shape\n(e.g. to a house rather than bricks, mortar, and timbers); likewise\none should consider the discussion of nature to be referring to the\ncomposite and the overall substantial being rather than to those\nthings which do not exist when separated from their substantial being.\n(PA I 5, 645a4\u201336)\n\n\nReaders, often carried away by the rhetoric of this passage, might\nfail to notice that there is a compelling argument here, with two key\nconclusions. The first is that, while studying the Sun, Moon, starts\nand planets may be a noble pursuit, if scientific understanding is\nyour goal, you are much more likely to achieve it in the study of\nanimals and plants: \u201c\u2026anyone wishing to labor\nsufficiently can grasp many things about each kind\u2026we know more\nof them and we know them more fully\u2026they are nearer to us and\nmore of our own nature\u2026\u201d (excerpted from\n644b29\u2013645a3). The second is that if one has the proper\nphilosophical focus, then one realizes that the somewhat unpleasant\ntask of dissecting blood vessels and the like, is a means to\nunderstanding that for the sake of which and soul,\nthose objects of inquiry argued to be primary in chapter 1. For the\nlesson of chapter 1 is that understanding living matter is achieved\nprimarily by means of an understanding of the functional goals served\nby an animal\u2019s parts, discovering what each of its parts is for,\nwhat it contributes to the life of the animal. This is the\nphilosophical way to investigate animals, and by doing so you learn\nthe value of an animal\u2019s parts and activities to its life.\n\nThe remainder of the chapter, therefore, recommends approaching the\nactivities associated with animals and their parts in a\nmanner exactly analogous to the approach to the study of parts\nrecommended in chapter 4 (645b1\u201314); and it concludes with a\nschematic discussion of the variety of teleological relationships that\nhold among parts, between parts and their\nactivities, and among activities. Aristotle encourages us to\nconceive of these relationships in a yet more unified way, as\na single complex relationship between a single complex activity\n(living, I suppose) and a single complex instrument, the\nanimal\u2019s body. (645b15\u201336)\n\nIn the first book of On the Parts of Animals, then, we have a\nsystematic philosophy of biology, which in many respects seems to\nprovide what is missing in the Analytics regarding the\napplication of its program to the study of living nature. But does\nAristotle\u2019s biological practice carry through on this program?\nIt is worthwhile keeping that question in mind as we survey those\nbooks that report the results of Aristotle\u2019s animal studies. To\nthose books we now turn. \n5. Aristotle\u2019s Biological Practice\n5.1 The History of Animals as a Report of the Results of a Hoti-Investigation\n\nAs we saw earlier, Aristotle introduces his systematic study of the\ndifferences and attributes of animals as a\nhoti-investigation, a factual investigation preliminary to\nthe search for causal demonstrations. By studying it, then, we ought\nto be able to develop a rich picture of what this theoretically\nmotivated, preliminary stage of investigation aims to achieve, and\nperhaps a glimpse of what such an investigation entails.\n\nAs many studies, following up on the pioneering work of David Balme\n(1961, 1987b) have now established, the History of Animals\n(HA) is a work that from first to last displays and builds\nupon multi-differentiae division of animal differences (see Gotthelf\n1988, 1997b; Lennox 2001b, chs. 1, 2; Pellegrin 1986). It is organized\nas a study of four kinds of animal differences first mentioned in\nHA\u2019s first chapter as the principal objects of study\n(at 486b22\u2013487a14)\u2014differences in parts (the topic of\nBooks I\u2013IV), in modes of activity and ways of life (those\nrelated to generation in Books V-VI--and human generation in\nIX--others in Book VII) and in characters (Book VIII). These in turn\nare sub-divided; for example, discussion of the non-uniform\nparts (organs, as we say) of animals with blood (I 7-III 1) is\nfollowed by that of their uniform parts (tissues, III\n2\u201322). A discussion of the parts of animals without blood then\nconcludes the discussion of differences in parts (IV 1\u20138). Book\nIV concludes with a discussion of differences in sensory faculties,\nvoice, and differences related to\n sex.[9]\n\nIt is only once Aristotle begins to distinguish differences\namong, say, uniform parts that various groupings of animals play an\nimportant role in organizing the discussion. And in so far as there\nare relatively stable general groupings of animals, these are\nidentified by noting their possession of stable correlations among\ndifferentiae\u2014for example, there are a large number of different\nanimals all of which have wings, feathers, beaks, and two fleshless\nlegs, and this group of animals has been given the designation\n \u2018bird\u2019.[10]\n In other cases, such groups have not been generally recognized, and\nAristotle simply refers to them by means of some of their most\nimportant correlated differences\u2014the four-legged and\nlive-bearing animals, for example, corresponding to our land mammals\n(with one important exception).\n\nWhat is clear from the practice of the History of Animals is\nboth the value of division and its limitations. Division by itself\ndoes not provide you with the axes of division; rather they\nare presupposed. Division does not give you animal kinds; as we saw in\nthe previous section, one needs to turn to PA I 4 and\nHA I 6 for Aristotle\u2019s thoughts on how those kinds are\nestablished. Something besides division is needed in order for a\nresearcher to recognize theoretically significant\nkinds, such as cephalopods or cetaceans. Why group animals together\nbased on their possession of four legs and the ability to give birth\nto living offspring (rather than eggs)? Certainly each of these traits\nis the product of a division, one of modes of locomotion and one of\nmodes of reproduction. But those divisions do not tell you that\nanimals with four legs that bear living young constitute a\nscientifically significant group.\n\nA second limitation of division is its indifference to the distinction\nbetween causally fundamental characteristics and proper attributes, to\nuse the language of the Analytics. Yet, being able to\ndistinguish these is absolutely fundamental to Aristotelian science. A\ncareful comparative study of the History of Animals, on the\none hand, and works such as On the Parts or On the\nGeneration of Animals, on the other, provides insight into how\nAristotle understands and deploys this distinction in his actual\nscientific practice. And as we have seen above, Aristotle draws\nexplicit attention to its importance for his biological investigations\nin a number of key texts within those investigations themselves. To\nstudy in detail the interplay between definition, causal demonstration\nand division in the biology is to see Aristotle working through just\nthose problems which form the central question of Posterior\nAnalytics II\u2014how precisely are definition, causal\ndemonstration and division related to one another in the quest for,\nand achievement of, scientific understanding?\n\nIt is impossible to present even a hint of the richness of the\nempirical content of the Historia Animalium here. Before\ngoing on to a discussion of the works that report the results of\nAristotle\u2019s causal investigations of animal parts and animal\ngeneration, however, two examples of reports from HA are\nprovided for comparison with corresponding discussions in PA\nand GA. The first example discusses the organs of respiration\nin blooded animals; these are the first internal organs\ndiscussed after Aristotle has concluded his review of their\nexternal parts. Here is how he introduces that\ndiscussion.\n\n\nSo, then, the number and character of the external parts of the\nblooded animals and how they differ from one another has been stated.\nWe must now discuss how the internal parts are situated, first in the\nblooded animals.\n\nAs many as (hosa) are four legged and live-bearing all\n(panta) have an esophagus and windpipe, arranged just as in\nhuman beings; it is also arranged similarly in as many of the four\nlegged animals as lay eggs, and in the birds; but they differ in the\nforms (tois eidesi) of these parts. Generally, all and only\n(panta hosa) those receiving air by inhaling and exhaling in\nevery case (panta) have a lung, windpipe and esophagus; and\nthe position of the esophagus and windpipe is alike in all,\nbut the organs are not, while the lung is neither alike in all nor is\nit positioned in a like manner. And again as many as (hosa)\nhave blood all (panta) have a heart\u2026 . But not all\n[blooded animals] have a lung, for instance fish do not, nor any other\nanimal there might be that has gills. (505b23\u2013506a12,\nexcerpts)\n\n\nThere are a number of features in this passage that are common\nthroughout the Historia Animalium and provide insight into\nits methods and aims. First is the syntactically redundant linguistic\npattern hosa\u2026panta (\u201cas many as...all\u201d),\nvariants of which are common in this treatise. Aristotle appears to\nuse the sentence form \u201cAs many as are X, all have Y\u201d for a\nquite specific reason. It is not just to note a universal\ncorrelation; it is to do so while leaving the extension of the\ncorrelation open\u2014a brilliant methodological innovation. New\nanimals with the correlation can be discovered, but the generalization\nwill not change, since it is about the universal correlation among\ndifferentiae\u2014in this case internal organs\u2014not about the\nkinds that exemplify it. It appears that when Aristotle intensifies\nthe expression by writing panta hosa, as he does once here,\nhe means to signal a convertible universal, an\n\u2018entailment\u2019 as we would say. Aristotle first lists a\nnumber of distinct groups, all the members of which have the three\norgans being discussed, windpipe, lung and esophagus. Then, using the\nterm \u2018generally\u2019 to signal what he is about to do, he\nidentifies a differentia that all these groups have in common, and\nwhich is coextensive with these three organs\u2014inhaling\nand exhaling air. The inductive pattern has the following form:\n\n\n\u2018As many as are P all have Y; As many as are\nQ all have Y\u2026 .\n\nGenerally, all and only those that are X (a feature common to\nP, Q\u2026) have Y\u2019.\n\n\nBy going on to note that as many as have blood have a heart, he\nimplicitly is warning the reader about a potential false inference one\nmight draw from the examples so far: that all blooded animals have a\nlung. He mentions fish as an example of blooded animals without a\nlung, but immediately identifies the relevant differentia:\n\u2018those blooded animals that have gills do not have\nthese organs [the lung and its associated parts]\u2019. He is careful\nnot to restrict the universal to a kind\u2014the relevant correlation\nis with gills, in whichever animals they might be found.\n\nWhile the inductive strategy of this work, directing us to high-level,\nconvertible universals is, I hope, now clear, it is also important to\nnote what is absent from this passage. Aristotle rarely in\nthis work claims any of these correlations is necessary, or\nthat others are impossible. He does not distinguish features\nthat are part of the essence of a kind from others that are\nmere attributes; and he typically avoids any hint of causal\nexplanation. All of this is to be expected, given the\nmethodological guidelines for historia that we discussed\nearlier\u2014historia is preliminary to causal investigation\nand prepares us for it. In the passage we are currently considering,\nfor example, it is striking that he notes the convertible correlation\nbetween lung, windpipe and esophagus, on the one hand, and inhaling\nand exhaling of air, on the other, but does not claim that\ntwo of the organs are present for the sake of breathing. (In fact, the\nword for \u2018breathing\u2019 is never used!) Though he uses the\nterm \u2018nature\u2019 regularly in HA, he does\nnot, as he does so often in his causal investigations, claim\nthat nature does nothing in vain, or that it always does what is best\nfor each organism. Nor does he talk about the parts of an animal as\nits material nature, nor about its living capacities as aspects of its\nformal nature. Indeed there is virtually no mention of the matter-form\ndistinction in HA. It is only when we turn to the various\nbiological treatises devoted to causal investigation that this\nlanguage associated with the search for definitions and demonstrations\ncomes to the fore.\n\nThe aim of this brief analysis of one small passage is to convey a\ntaste of the methodological depth and complexity of this great\nscientific treatise, so often misunderstood as a poorly organized\ncompendium of nature lore. I\u2019ll conclude this section with one\nmore example, from the books dealing with generation, so that we may\ncompare it with a corresponding discussion in De\nGeneratione Animalium.\n\nHA V-VI discuss all aspects of animal generation, moving from\nconsideration of differences in modes and timing of copulation and\nreproduction to the actual process of generation (or\n\u2018development\u2019, as we more often say). As in his discussion\nof parts, he moves through the various blooded kinds and then\ndiscusses generation in bloodless kinds and from identifying the\nuniversals common to all members of a group to identifying the\npeculiarities of more specific kinds. At HA VI 3, having\npreviously described the common and peculiar characteristics of\ncopulation in birds, he turns to recording his observations of the\ndevelopment of the chick at the critical fourth day after the egg has\nbeen laid.\n\nGeneration from the egg occurs in an identical manner in all birds,\nthough the time taken to termination varies, as we have said. In the\ncase of the hen, the first signs of the embryo are seen after three\ndays and nights; in larger birds it takes more time, in smaller birds\nless. During this time the yolk travels upwards to the point of the\negg\u2014that is where the starting point of the egg is and where it\nopens up, and the heart is no bigger than just a small blood-spot in\nthe white. This spot beats and moves as though it were alive; and from\nit, as it grows, two vein-like vessels with blood in them lead on a\ntwisted course to each of the two surrounding membranes. A membrane\nwith bloody fibers already surrounds the white of the egg, at this\ntime coming from the vessel-like channels. A bit later the body can\nalso be distinguished, at first very small and pale. The head is\napparent, and its eyes, very swollen; and this continues for a long\ntime, for it is later that they contract and become smaller.\n(561a4\u201321)\n\n\nHe begins with a wide generalization about all birds, followed by a\n\u2018more and less\u2019 correlation between the size of\nthe bird and the rate of development. This device allows\nAristotle to use the careful description of the chick egg opened on\nday four as a universal description of development; the reader is\nlicensed to infer that the same stage of development will occur in all\nbirds, but may occur either earlier or later, depending on whether\nthey are larger or smaller than the domestic chicken.\nAristotle\u2019s description of this classic experiment led to its\nbeing repeated many times in the\n Renaissance.[11]\n Anyone who has seen modern films of the chick at this stage of\ndifferentiation can appreciate the accuracy of Aristotle\u2019s\ndescription, especially when one takes into account the size of the\nchick embryo at this stage of growth.\n5.2 From Inquiry to Understanding; from hoti to dioti.\n\nFor Aristotle, \u2018historia\u2019, the scientific\norganization of information about animals\u2014serves the goal of\ncausal explanation; and, as I discussed in section 4., explanation by\nreference to goals and functions is the primary form of causal\nexplanation in biology.\n\nOn the Parts of Animals II-IV presents Aristotle\u2019s\nattempt to provide causal explanations for the sort of information one\nfinds organized in HA I-IV, information about the uniform and\nnon-uniform parts of animals. (PA I, it will be recalled, is\na discussion of the norms that are needed to guide the scientific\ninvestigation of animals; see section 4, above.) Here, I will be\nnarrowly focused on just a couple of passages in PA II-IV,\nbut will begin with a very brief sketch of its overall structure. It\nbegins (PA II 1\u20132) with a careful and complex\ndiscussion of the causal relationships between uniform and non-uniform\nparts (roughly, this distinction corresponds to our distinction\nbetween bodily fluids and tissues and organs), stressing the\nteleological priority of the whole organism to the parts, and among\nparts the priority of the non-uniform to the uniform. PA II\n3\u201310 then discusses the uniform parts, beginning with that out\nof which all the others are nourished, blood, and ending with flesh,\nbone, and analogous materials (nail, horn, hoof). From II 10 to III 3,\nAristotle discusses the external parts of blooded animals associated\nwith the head such as eyes, ears, nose and mouth. But when he gets to\nthe neck, he turns to the internal parts, and from III 3 to IV 4 he\ndiscusses the \u2018innards\u2019 of the blooded animals, parts such\nas heart, lung, liver, kidneys, and so on. From IV 5 to 9 he discusses\nthe parts, both internal and external, of the \u2018bloodless\u2019\nanimals, i.e. the crustaceans, testaceous mollusks, cephalopods and\ninsects. Finally, at IV 10, he returns to the external parts\nassociated with the torso and limbs of the live bearing and egg laying\nquadrupeds (10\u201311), birds (12), and fish (13); and ends by\ndiscussing a number of animals that \u2018dualize\u2019 between\nbeing land-dwellers and water dwellers or flyers.\n\nIn order to compare the methods of this treatise with the discussion\nof the parts in HA, it will be useful to look briefly at\nPA III 3, a discussion of the lung, windpipe and esophagus,\nthe part discussed in the passage from HA II quoted in section 5.1,\nabove. The first twenty lines of that discussion read as follows:\n\n\n\nNot all animals have a neck, but only those with the parts for the\nsake of which the neck is naturally present\u2014these\nare the windpipe and the part known as the esophagus. Now the larynx\nis present by nature for the sake of breathing; for it is\nthrough this part that animals draw in and expel air when they inhale\nand exhale. This is why those without a lung have no neck,\ne.g. the kind consisting of the fish. The esophagus is the part\nthrough which nourishment proceeds to the gut; so that animals without\nnecks manifestly do not have an esophagus. But it is not\nnecessary to have the esophagus for the sake of\nnutrition; for it concocts nothing. And further, it is\npossible for the gut to be placed right next to the position\nof the mouth, while for the lung this is impossible. For\nthere needs first to be something common like a conduit,\nwhich then divides in two and through which the air is separated into\npassages\u2014in this way the lung may best accomplish\ninhalation and exhalation.\n\nSo, then, the organ connected with breathing from necessity\nhas length; therefore it is necessary for there to be an\nesophagus between the mouth and the stomach. The esophagus is fleshy,\nwith a sinuous elasticity\u2014sinuous so that it\nmay dilate when food is ingested, yet fleshy so that\nit is soft and yielding and is not damaged when it is scraped by the\nfood going down. (664a14\u201334)\n\n\nI have highlighted the language of nature, necessity, possibility\n(and impossibility), and being for the sake of in this passage in\norder to highlight the contrast with the discussion of the same\norganic correlations in the corresponding HA passage. Here\nthe goal is explanation\u2014parts are present and have the\ncharacter they do primarily due to the conditional necessity imposed\nby the organism\u2019s functional requirements. One sees here the\nAristotle that so impressed the great French naturalist Georges\nCuvier: Aristotle is not only systematically discussing the adaptive\nfunctions of each of these organs; he is also displaying the complex\nway in which the internal parts of animals constitute an organic\nsystem.\n\nThe lack of names for animal kinds is also noteworthy; as in the\ncorresponding passage from HA II, fish are mentioned once as\nan instance of blooded animals that lack the organs in question; but\nthe stress throughout is on this particular system of organs in\nwhichever blooded animals have them. Aristotle\u2019s goal is to\nexplain why it is that certain animals have these organs, and why it\nis that, if they have one of these organs, they must\nhave the others. Some, but not all, of the explanations specify the\nfunction for the sake of which the parts are present; and even the\nmaterial nature of the tissues, whether fleshy or sinuous, may be\nexplained in functional terms. This discussion also displays a\nhierarchy of teleological connections of the sort described\nat the close of PA I 5, 645b28\u201333\u2014one activity is\npresent for the sake of another more basic one; a part that performs a\nsubordinate activity is present for the sake of a part that performs a\nmore important activity. Inhaling and exhaling are for the sake of\nrespiration (which is for the sake of cooling the blood); a windpipe\nis present for the sake of transporting air to and from the lung; a\nneck is present to protect the windpipe.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear, the relationship between the books\nof the Historia Animalium dealing with generation and On\nthe Generation of Animals (GA) is somewhat more complex.\nGA has a reasonably clear organization of its own; but its\ncentral (though not only) project of explaining the causal\nroles of the male and female in sexual generation and the causality of\nembryological development raises a host of topics and problems well\nbeyond the scope of HA. But a study of how the two works are\nrelated is nonetheless illuminating. This discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s biological practice will thus close by considering\nthe causal explanation of embryological development and in particular\nthe explanation for the early appearance of the heart, with a final\nlook at the application of this explanation to the case of embryonic\nbirds.\n\nAs I noted earlier, taken on its own terms, GA has a\nreasonably clear structure. Here again, as with PA II-IV, I will begin\nwith a brief sketch of its overall structure, before focusing narrowly\non its method as applied to one problem. It begins (715a1\u201318) by\nnoting that it will explain two sets of facts left unexplained in\nPA: the differences among the parts related to generation;\nand the generation of the parts generally. Though he\nacknowledges that some animals do not have males and females, he\ntreats sexual generation as his central topic. Initially he provides a\ntheoretically \u2018neutral\u2019 account of the distinction: the\nmale is what generates in another, the female what generates in itself\n(716a14\u201315). It is not until late in book I that he begins to\ndevelop his own detailed theory of their distinctive contributions to\ngeneration.\n\nThe first 13 chapters characterize the reproductive organs in the\nmales and females of blooded animals, while 14\u201316 do the same\nfor the bloodless animals that have males and females. Beginning in\nchapter 17, the discussion turns to the relevant uniform\nparts related to generation, sperma (roughly\n\u2018seed\u2019) and milk, but the discussion of milk is postponed\nuntil book IV. This immediately raises the contentious issue of\nwhether both male and female contribute sperma, and\nif both, then what the nature of their respective contributions is.\nThis is a large part of the discussion from I 17-II 5, one of the most\ndifficult stretches of text in the Aristotelian corpus, and the one on\nwhich our attention will be focused. But to continue our overview: the\nremainder of book II (from chapter 5 on) discusses the causes of the\nembryological development of live-bearing animals, while the\negg-laying animals are the primary focus in book III, which closes\nwith a discussion of animals that are not sexually generated,\nincluding those that arise \u2018spontaneously.\u2019 GA IV\nturns to the development of inherited differences within kinds,\nbeginning with the most important intra-specific difference for his\ntheory of generation, the difference between male and female. From\nthere it moves on to family resemblance, differences in the number of\noffspring produced and to the causes of deformities. GA V\naims to explain \u2018more and less\u2019 variations within kinds\nthat appear late in development and that may be fully accounted for by\nidentifying material level causal interactions\u2014differences\nwithin a kind in the color, texture or density of a part, for\nexample.\n\nThe remainder of this discussion will focus on the general causal\ntheory of animal generation developed in the first half of GA\n II.[12]\n In the closing chapters of book I, Aristotle argues that both the\nmale and female contributions are formed from a \u2018useful\nresidue\u2019 of blood by a concocting process, the male\u2019s\nbeing more fully concocted than the female\u2019s. From this point on\nthe male\u2019s contribution is typically termed gon\u00ea\n(semen), and the female\u2019s katamenia (menses). Aristotle\nis not entirely consistent, however: occasionally he uses the generic\nterm sperma for the male contribution and explicitly\ncontrasts it with katamenia (727a27\u201330); while at other\ntimes he refers to katamenia as a sort of sperma\n(728a26\u201329).\n\nThe two contributions are variously described. The male contributes a\nsource of movement or dunamis (\u2018power\u2019 or\n\u2018potential\u2019), which, as the argument unfolds, turns out to\nbe a special sort of capacity to heat present in the semen\u2019s\npneuma or air, which is part of its nature. (This gets fully\nworked out in GA II 2\u20133) The semen itself is mere a\nvehicle for delivering this heating capacity; the male makes no\nmaterial contribution to the offspring. The female contributes what\nmight be called \u2018prepared matter\u2019; all it needs is the\npresence within it of the heating capacity from the male and it begins\na more or less lengthy and complicated developmental process, which\nAristotle analogizes to a sort of automaton performing a complex set\nof coordinated movements once it is set in motion.\n\nHe relies at several points in the argument on an analogy with crafts,\nsuch as house building:\n\nIn animals that emit semen the nature in the male uses the semen as an\ninstrument possessing active movement, just as the tools are moved in\nthings that come to be by craft; for the movement of the craft is\nsomehow in these tools. (730b20\u201323)\n\n\nThis obscure analogy gradually gets unpacked in the first four\nchapters of GA II. The general principle common to art and\nnature is this:\n\nAs many things as come to be by nature or by art come to be by means\nof a being in actuality from that which is potentially such as that\nbeing. (734b22\u201323)\n\n\nIt is the prepared portion of the female\u2019s katamenia\nthat is potentially such as the contributor of semen is actually. And\nthe semen conveys to it a movement or power, such that \u201cwhen the\nmovement ceases each of the parts comes to be and is ensouled\n(734b24\u201325).\u201d That is, in embryological development, each\npart emerges within a system of parts that is organized to provide\nnutrition for its growth, and that is guided by a complex\n\u2018program\u2019 for its development. Notice that as each part\ncomes to be it already has the functional capacity associated with\nit\u2014it comes to be and is ensouled. Aristotle\ncharacterizes the process as follows:\n\n\nAs for hardness, softness, toughness and fragility and all the other\nsuch affections present in these ensouled parts, these affections\nmight be produced by heat and cold, but not the defining character\n(logos) in virtue of which the one part is flesh and the\nother bone; that is the result of the movement derived from the\ngenerator, being in actuality what that out of which it comes to be is\npotentially, just as in things that come to be by craftsmanship.\n(734b31\u201335)\n\n\nThis passage comes immediately after Aristotle has stressed two\nrelated points: that the uniform parts and the instrumental parts\narise simultaneously; and that even flesh and bone have a function to\nperform. These points are tightly connected. The defining features of\ntissues are not merely their affective qualities such as being hard or\nsoft, but their biological functions as well; and their biological\nfunctions are intimately connected to their roles in\nconstituting\u2014and being able to play functional roles\nin\u2014instrumental parts; many, if not all, of a part\u2019s\naffective qualities are a consequence of its biological role.\n\nIn the process of making this argument, Aristotle also stresses a\ncrucial and problematic dis-analogy: Natural things, once\ntheir generation begins, \u2018grow by means of themselves\u2019\n(735a13\u201314). This is the most fundamental difference between art\nand nature for Aristotle; a nature is a source of change within the\nthing itself (Physics II. 1). Natural development, then,\nthough initiated by the warmth contributed by the male parent,\ncontinues by means of a source of change within the developing embryo.\nThe carpenter may not mix any of his own material in his buildings;\nbut he must be continuously, physically involved in the movements that\ncreate those buildings. Not so with the male parent in natural\ngeneration. So how does a complex process that has its origins in an\nexternal generator become a natural process of development?\n\nFor Aristotle, the heart (or its analogue in bloodless animals) is\ncrucial. It is the first part created by the heat derived from the\nsemen of the male parent, and henceforth it is the primary internal\nsource of that heat and thus of further development (735a16\u201326).\nThe following explanation begins to bring us into contact with our\npassage on generation from the History of Animals.\n\n\u2026in the embryo (kuema), while in a way all the parts\nare present potentially, the source [of development] is most along the\npath to actuality. This is why the heart is first to be differentiated\nin actuality. And this is not only clear to perception (as it\nhappens), but is also clear to reason. When the developing thing is\ndistinct from both the male and female contributions, it must manage\nitself, as when a son sets up a home away from his father. So in\nanimals there must be a source of generation from which the later\norganizing of the body comes about. \u2026 Wherefore the heart\nappears differentiated first in all blooded animals; for it is the\nsource of both the uniform and the non-uniform parts. \u2026 And the\nprepared blood or its analogue is nutrient for the animal, and the\nblood vessels are its repository; for this reason the heart is their\nsource. This is clear from a study of \u2018the histories\u2019 and\n\u2018the dissections\u2019. (740a2\u201323, excerpted; compare\n735a12\u201326, 738b17\u201318 740a27\u201336, 742b34\u2013743a1,\n743b26)\n\n\nHaving developed this general explanation during his discussion of his\ncentral case, viviparous development, in GA II, Aristotle\nmoves on to egg-laying animals in book III. GA III 1 carries\nover to them whatever is common to the two cases, with discussion of\nthe development of birds in their eggs beginning in GA III 2.\nA recurring aspect of his argument, here as in PA, is to\nrefer us for descriptive details to the histories (presumably\nthe basis of our HA) and to a collection of representations\nof dissections (tragically not preserved, but cited repeatedly in\nAristotle\u2019s biological writings and in ancient catalogues of his\nwritings).\n\nThe most general differences among egg-layers relate to the\n\u2018completeness\u2019 of the egg when laid. Because birds lay\neggs that become hard as soon as they are exposed to the air\n(752a30-b2), they are taken to be better prepared when laid than the\neggs of other egg-laying animals. Ignoring much interesting and\nimportant detail, we will take up the discussion of development within\nthe eggs of birds as they incubate. Aristotle distinguishes the\n\u2018white\u2019 and the \u2018yolk\u2019, not descriptively as\nhe did in HA, but functionally (752b18\u201328).\n\n\u2026it is the white out of which the animal is constituted, while\nthe yolk becomes nutrient, and growth for the constitution of the\nparts is from it. This is also why the yolk and the white, having\ndistinct natures, have been kept distinct by membranes. For precise\ndetails concerning how these parts are situated in relation to each\nother in virtue of the sources of generation and the constitution of\nanimals, as well as the membranes and umbilical cords, one should\nstudy what has been outlined in the histories. The following appears\nto be sufficient for the present investigation: the heart is the first\nthing constituted; after this the great blood vessel is marked off,\nand two umbilical cords extend from this blood vessel, one to the\nmembrane around the yolk, the other to the membrane surrounding the\nanimal itself. This latter is thus next to the membrane of the shell.\n(753b11\u201323)\n\n\nIn this case (though not always) one does get far more detail in\nHA. These references to histories and dissections can be\nmisleading unless one takes into account the differences in the aims,\nand thus in the organization, of these treatises. In this case, for\nexample, nothing is said in GA about the heart \u2018beating\nand moving as though it were alive\u2019. As we saw, however,\nGA II stresses that in the development of live-bearing\nanimals, the heart is first to be formed, is ensouled from the start,\nand is the source of development for all the other parts\u2014a much\nmore \u2018theory-laden\u2019 characterization that stresses the\nheart\u2019s causal role in development. And because of the\norganizational structure of GA, much of what is said in his\ndiscussion of the live-bearing animals (those that are \u2018more\ncomplete\u2019 when they are born) is assumed to apply to animals\nthat lay eggs (that are \u2018less complete\u2019 when born).\n\nRecall the stunningly accurate discussion of the head and eyes of the\nfour day old chick embryo in HA (in section 5.1, above). This\nis not discussed in GA III 2; however in GA II 6, in\na long discussion of early organ formation in live-bearing\nanimals, Aristotle has a good deal to say on the subject:\n\nWhat happens concerning the eyes of animals presents a problem. For\nfrom the beginning, whether in land animals, swimmers or flyers, they\nappear very large and yet they are among the last of the parts to be\ncompleted and in the mean time contract in size. This is\nbecause the sense organs of the eyes are, as with the other sense\norgans, on channels; but while those for touch and taste are simply\nbodily, or some part of the body of animals, and those for smell and\nhearing are channels connected to the air outside and are full of\nconnate pneuma\u2026the eyes alone have a proper sensory body.\n(743b33\u2013744a6)\n\n\nThe full explanation goes on much longer, but we need not follow it\nout for the purposes of making two important points about the\nrelationship of GA to HA. The first is that the\norganization of GA dictates that for the explanation of facts\nof wide generality such as this one, we must look in book\nII\u2014notice that he claims that this explanation for the large\nsize of eyes early in development and for their subsequent contraction\napplies to all land, air and water animals. The second point to be\nstressed is the relentlessly causal/explanatory focus of the\nGA discussion, a feature (properly) completely absent in the\ncorresponding discussions in HA. As impressive as the\ndescriptive accuracy of the embryological passage cited earlier from\nHA is, we again need to remember what is absent from\nthat discussion. For the equally impressive embryological\ntheory, the reader of Aristotle\u2019s biology must turn to\nthe Generation of Animals.\n6. A Concluding Puzzle\n\nThis entry on Aristotle\u2019s biology and its philosophy closes with\na puzzle about the organization of his biological works when compared\nwith the remainder of the Aristotelian corpus. I began by noting that\nit is a fundamental aspect of Aristotle\u2019s theory of science that\ninvestigation proceeds from a stage where one establishes the\nexistence of the things being studied and the facts about them to a\nstage where the focus is on causal explanations by reference to the\nnatures and essences of those things. It seems clear that the\nbiological works honor this distinction, and do so self-consciously.\nYet Aristotle never suggests, in the Posterior Analytics or\nanywhere else, that these stages should be represented by distinct\ntreatises devoted to the same subject. Indeed, in no other domain\ndoes Aristotle do this: whether we look to meteorology, cosmology,\npsychology, ethics, drama or rhetoric, we find single treatises\npresenting both the facts and their explanation. Nor can this puzzle\nbe easily dismissed as an artifact of later editing\u2014as I have\npointed out a number of times, these treatises have a most interesting\nand consistent pattern of cross-referencing. The treatises that report\nthe results of causal investigations regularly refer to HA\n(and the dissections) for more detail regarding the facts being\nexplained; the HA, in contrast, never refers to the\ncausal treatises. Moreover, the striking avoidance in the Historia\nAnimalium of all of the concepts associated with\ndefinition and explanation cannot reasonably be laid at the feet of\nsome imagined later editor. We are left, then, to ponder what it was\nabout the investigation of animals that led Aristotle to take a\nmethodological distinction regarding stages of investigation\nand reify it in methodologically distinct treatises devoted to these\ndifferent stages.\n",
