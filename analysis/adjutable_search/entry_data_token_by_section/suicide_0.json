    "main_text": "Characterizing Suicide\n1. Characterizing Suicide\n\nCharacterizing suicide precisely faces a number of philosophical\nchallenges.\n\nOne challenge stems from the strongly negative emotional or moral\nconnotations of the term \u2018suicide\u2019. Efforts to distinguish\nsuicidal behavior from other behavior often clandestinely import moral\njudgments about the aims or moral worth of such behavior. That is,\nviews about the nature of suicide often incorporate, sometimes\nunknowingly, views about the prudential or moral justifiability of\nsuicide and are therefore not value-neutral descriptions of suicide\n(Paterson 2003, 353, Cholbi 2011, 17\u201320). For example, Hitler,\nmost people contend, clearly died due to suicide, but Socrates and\nJesus did not (though on Socrates, see Frey 1978). That the deaths of\nthe morally villainous are more readily seen as suicides than the\ndeaths of the morally admirable illustrates that suicide still carries\na strongly negative subtext. A similar phenomenon is present within\nsocietal discourse concerning individuals near the end of life who\nseek medical assistance to die. Advocacy and professional\norganizations have largely succeeded in changing the terminology used\nin public discussions of such individuals from \u2018assisted\nsuicide\u2019 or \u2018physician-assisted suicide\u2019 to\n\u2018assisted dying\u2019 or \u2018death with dignity,\u2019\ndespite the strong similarities between these acts and suicide of\nother kinds. (Friesen 2020, Reed 2020) Presumably, such groups have\ndone so from the belief that the negative connotations of\n\u2018suicide\u2019 will reduce public support for the cause of\nlegalizing medical assistance in dying.\n\n\u2018Suicide\u2019 may well turn out to be a value-laden concept,\none that cannot be defined in a morally neutral way.\nNevertheless,\u00a0it would be desirable to identify\u00a0a\ndefensible\u00a0conception of suicide that is not value-laden\n(Stern-Gillett 1987, Kupfer 1990) For those debating the morality of\n\u2018suicide\u2019 are likely to be at cross purposes if some\ndefine \u2018suicide\u2019 as\u00a0wrongful\nself-killing\u00a0(in the way that \u2018murder\u2019 can be\ndefined as\u00a0wrongful killing of another) while others\noperate with a definition that does not entail that all acts of\nsuicide are\u00a0wrongful. The former rules out the prospect of\nmorally defensible \u2018suicide\u2019 while the latter allows for\nit. A more fruitful debate is likely to result if such debates are\norganized around a shared descriptive definition of suicide that does\nnot beg the question about the possibility of its being justified.\n\nIf a purely descriptive account of suicide is possible, where should\nit begin? While it is tempting to say that suicide is any self-caused\ndeath, this account is vulnerable to obvious counterexamples (though\nfor a defense of such a view, see Dowie 2020). An individual who knows\nthe health risks of smoking or of skydiving, but willfully engages in\nthese behaviors and dies as a result, could be said to be causally\nresponsible for her own death but not to have died by suicide.\nSimilarly, an individual who takes a swig of hydrochloric acid,\nbelieving it to be lemonade, and subsequently dies causes her own\ndeath but does not engage in suicidal behavior. Moreover, not only are\nthere self-caused deaths that are not suicides, but there are\nbehaviors that result in death and are arguably suicidal in which the\nagent is not the cause of her own death or is so only at one remove.\nThis can occur when an individual arranges the circumstances for her\ndeath. A terminally ill patient who requests that another person\ninject her with a lethal dose of tranquilizers has, intuitively, died\nby suicide. Though she is not immediately causally responsible for her\ndeath, she appears morally responsible for her death, since she\ninitiates a sequence of events which she intended to culminate in her\ndeath, a sequence which cannot be explained without reference to her\nbeliefs and desires. (Such a case exemplifies\n voluntary euthanasia.)\n Likewise, those who die via \u2018suicide by cop,\u2019 where an\narmed crime is committed in order to provoke police into killing its\nperpetrator, are responsible for their own deaths despite not being\nthe causes of their deaths. In these kinds of cases, such agents would\nnot die, or would not be at an elevated risk for death, were it not\nfor their initiating such causal sequences. (See Brandt 1975, Tolhurst\n1983, Frey 1981, but for a possible objection see Kupfer 1990.)\n\nFurthermore, many philosophers (Fairbairn 1995, chapter 5) doubt\nwhether an act\u2019s actually resulting in death is essential to\nsuicide at all. Just as there can be attempted murders or attempted\nacts of deception, so too can there be \u2018attempted\u2019\nsuicides, instances where because of agents\u2019 false beliefs\n(about the lethality of their behavior, for example), unforeseen\nfactual circumstances, others\u2019 interventions, etc., an act which\nmight have resulted in an agent\u2019s death does not.\n\nHence, suicidal behavior need not result in death, nor must the\ncondition that hastens death be self-caused. Definitions according to\nwhich suicide occurs when a person acts knowing that her act will\ncause her own death (Durkheim (1897)) thus fail to capture how death\nis in some respect an aim of suicidal behavior. Second, what\nappears essential for a behavior to count as suicide is that the\nperson in question chooses to die. From the perspective of\nthe suicidal actor, that she may die from her act is, in the case of\nsuicide, not a mere coincidence. An act\u2019s being suicide, rather\nthan merely being risky to one\u2019s life, thus seems to depend on\nthe individual\u2019s intentions, where an intention\nimplicates an individual\u2019s beliefs and desires about her action.\n(See Brandt 1975, Graber 1981 Tolhurst 1983, Frey 1978, O\u2019Keeffe\n1981, McMahan 2002, 455, Paterson 2003, Cholbi 2011, 20\u201331, Hill\n2011) An intention-based account of suicide would say, roughly,\nthat\n\nA person S\u2019s behavior B is suicidal iff\n\n\nS believed that B, or some causal consequence of\nB, would hasten her death (i.e, her death would occur earlier\nin time than it would have in B\u2019s absence), and\nS intended to die by engaging in B.\n \n\n\nThis account renders more precise the notion of suicide as an effort\nto bring about one\u2019s own death, but it is not unproblematic.\n\nCondition (a) is a doxastic condition. It implies that deaths\n(or increased risks for death) resulting from an individual\u2019s\nact that causes death (or the risk thereof) are not suicides if the\nindividual acts in ignorance of the relevant risks of her behavior\n(for example, when an individual accidentally takes a lethal dose of a\nprescription drug). At the same time, (a) accounts for cases such as\nthe aforementioned terminally ill patient whose death is caused only\nindirectly by her request to die. Condition (a) does not require that\nS know that B will put her at a\nsignificantly greater risk for death, nor even that S\u2019s\nbeliefs about B\u2019s lethality be true or even justified.\nSuicidal individuals sometimes have false beliefs about the lethality\nof their chosen suicide methods, greatly overestimating the lethality\nof over the counter painkillers while underestimating the lethality of\nhandguns, for instance. An individual could believe falsely, or on the\nbasis of inadequate evidence, that placing one\u2019s head in an\nelectric oven significantly increases one\u2019s chances of dying,\nbut that behavior is nonetheless suicidal. The demand that S\nbelieve that B makes death highly likely is admittedly\ninexact, but it permits us to navigate between two extreme and\nmistaken views. On the one hand, it implies that behavior which is in\nfact only marginally more likely to cause a person\u2019s death is\nnot suicidal (you are more likely to die driving your car than in your\nliving room, but driving your car hardly qualifies as\n\u2018suicidal\u2019). On the other hand, to demand that S believe\nthat B certainly or almost certainly will cause\nS\u2019s death is too strict, since it will rarely be the\ncase (given the possibility of intervening conditions, etc.) that\nB will necessarily cause S\u2019s death, and in\nfact many suicidal individuals are ambivalent about their actions\n(Cholbi 2011, 31\u201335), an ambivalence which is in turn reflected\nin their selecting suicide methods that are far from certain to cause\ndeath. Condition (a) also allows us to distinguish genuinely suicidal\nbehavior from suicidal gestures, in which individuals engage\nin behavior they believe is not likely to cause their death\nbut is nonetheless associated with suicide attempts, while in fact\nhaving some other intention (e.g., gaining others\u2019 attention) in\nmind.\n\nCondition (b), however, is far more knotty. For what is it to intend\nthat death result from one\u2019s behavior? There are examples in\nwhich condition (a) is clearly met, but whether (b) is met is more\nproblematic. For instance, does a soldier who leaps upon a live\ngrenade tossed into a foxhole in order to save his comrades engage in\nsuicidal behavior? Many, especially partisans of\n the doctrine of double effect\n would answer \u2018no\u2019: Despite the fact that the soldier knew\nhis behavior would likely cause him to die, his intention was to\nabsorb the blast so as to save the other soldiers, whereas his death\nwas only a foreseen outcome of his action. Needless to say, whether a\nclear divide exists between foreseen and intended outcomes is\ncontroversial, and critics raise the worry that almost any outcome can\nbe described as foreseen (Glover 1990, ch. 6). (It is of course\npossible that whether death is foreseen or intended has no bearing on\nwhether an act counts as suicide but still bears on whether any\nparticular suicidal act is justified.) Some would argue that given the\nnear certainty of his dying by jumping on the grenade, his death was\nintended, for even though death is not the justifying aim of his\naction and he may prefer not to die, his dying nevertheless has his\nendorsement in the circumstances in which he acts (Tolhurst 1983,\nCholbi 2011, 26\u201331). A further complication is that current\npsychological evidence suggests that suicide is often an ambivalent\nact in which individuals who wish to die must nevertheless overcome\nthe ordinary human fear of death (Cholbi 2011, 31\u201334, Joiner\n2010, 62\u201370). Given this ambivalence, whether an act that\nposed\u00a0an apparently lethal threat to the agent who performed it\nwas intended to hasten her death can be hard to decipher. When a\nperson dies in such circumstances, it may prove difficult whether to\nclassify the death as resulting from suicide (i.e., intentional\nself-killing) or as accidental. Such cases might indicate the need for\na third category besides intentional suicide and accidental death\n(Cholbi 2007).\n\nThe essential logical difficulty here resides in the notion of\nintending to die, for acting so as to produce one\u2019s death nearly\nalways has some other aim or justification. That is, death is\ngenerally not chosen for its own sake, or is not the end of suicidal\nbehavior. Suicidal behavior can have any number of objectives: the\nrelief of physical pain, the relief of psychological anguish,\nmartyrdom in the service of a moral cause, the fulfillment of\nperceived societal duties (e.g., suttee and\nseppuku), the avoidance of judicial execution, revenge on\nothers, protection of others\u2019 interests or well-being. (See\nFairbairn 1995, ch. 9, for a taxonomy of the varieties of suicide.)\nTherefore, it is not the case that suicidal individuals intend death\nper se, but rather that death is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a\nmeans for the fulfillment of another of the agent\u2019s aims (Graber\n1981, 56). In short, there do not appear to be any compelling examples\nof \u201cnoninstrumental\u201d self-killings in which \u201cthe\noverriding intention is simply to end one\u2019s life and there is no\nfurther independent objective involved in the action\u201d\n(O\u2019Keeffe 1981, 357). Nor does requiring that the individual\nwish to be dead (Fairbairn 1995, ch. 6) address this issue,\nsince again, what one wishes is presumably not death itself but some\noutcome of death. Both the grenade-jumping soldier and the depressed\nindividual may wish not to die insofar as they might prefer that their\ndesires could be satisfied without dying or without putting themselves\nat the risk thereof. However, this is consistent with their willingly\nchoosing to die in order to satisfy their aims.\n\nSome (e.g., Beauchamp 1992, Cholbi 2011, 35\u201337) might wish to\nadd a further condition to (a) and (b) above:\n\nS was not coerced into B-ing.\n\n\nWhat speaks in favor of condition (c)?\u00a0Typically, coercion\ndenotes intervention\u00a0by others wherein a person comes to find\nherself with a reason to act in a certain way because of\nanother\u2019s threat or use of force. Coerced decisions seem not to\nbe entirely our own, inasmuch we act in accordance with the will of\nthe coercer rather than acting freely on the basis of our own prior\ndesires.\u00a0Applied to cases where individuals act intentionally to\nhasten their own deaths, this implies that such cases are not\ninstances of suicide, for while the individual may cause their own\ndeath, they do not have their own reasons to end their\nlives.\u00a0Hence, according to condition (c), a spy threatened with\ntorture lest he relinquish crucial military secrets who then poisons\nhimself did not die by suicide since the spy\u2019s captors compelled\nhim to take his life.\u00a0\n\nWhether an attempt to intentionally hasten one\u2019s death is\ncoerced or not is relevant to whether that attempt is\njustified. But condition (c)\u00a0may rest on an\nirrelevant\u00a0distinction: Many of the reasons individuals have for\nintentionally hastening death arguably originate outside themselves\nmuch in the way that a coerced agent\u2019s reasons originate outside\nthemselves too. An extremely ill patient S may opt to take their own\nlife rather endure severe and ongoing\u00a0physical pain. But compare\nS to T, who opts to take their own life because of severe and ongoing\nphysical pain caused by the choices of her torturer U. S and T seem to\nhave the same kinds of reasons to intentionally hasten their own\ndeaths, reasons originating outside themselves. According to condition\n(c), the crucial difference is that T is not engaging in suicide\nbecause T\u2019s reasons originate in U\u2019s decision to engage in\ntorture, whereas S is engaging in suicide because S\u2019s reasons do\nnot originate in the will or decisions of another individual. Can the\nnature of an action depend upon whether the reasons that justify it\noriginate in another person\u2019s will or decisions? This does not\nseem obvious. Coercion does not seem to alter the action as such, even\nif it alters whether their actions are justified or blameworthy. A\nperson coerced into singing is singing, no less than a person who\nsings of her own accord; a person coerced into withdrawing money from\nher bank account withdraws money from her bank account, no less than\nif she did of her own accord; etc. Condition (c) thus seems to impose\non the definition of suicide a requirement that does not seem to apply\nto other types of action.\n\nThis brief attempt at conceptual analysis of suicide illustrates the\nfrustrations of such a project, as the unclear notion of suicide is\napparently replaced by equally unclear notions such as intention and\ncoercion. We may be attracted to increasingly convoluted analyses of\nsuicide (Donnelly 1998, 20) or accept that suicide is an \u2018open\ntextured\u2019 concept instances of which are bound together only by\nweak Wittgensteinian family resemblance and hence resistant to\nanalysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions (Windt\n1981).\n\nAn alternative to providing necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsuicidal behavior is to view it along a continuum. In the\npsychological sciences, many suicidologists view suicide not as an\neither/or notion but as a gradient notion, admitting of degrees based\non individuals\u2019 beliefs, strength of intentions, and attitudes.\nThe Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation is perhaps the best example of\nthis approach.
