Though he frequently states that the political\nrulers have a proper concern to lead people to virtue, these\nstatements turn out to refer to the appropriate aspirations of rulers,\nnot to their coercive jurisdiction or authority. In the context of the\nsurrounding argument, the statements do not commit him to any wider\ngovernmental or legal authority than to require and foster the public\ngood and the virtue of justice, that is, the willingness to perform\none\u2019s duties to others: 6.1(iii) above. The other\nvirtues can be legally required of citizens only so far as they impact\non justice: ST I-II q. 96 a. 3. Moreover, he holds the\nclassic position that doing justice does not require that one\u2019s\nmotivations and character be just. And when it comes to coercive\nmeasures, he holds that they can bear only upon conduct that is\nexternal and immediately or mediately affects other people unjustly or\ndisturbs the peace of the political community: ST I-II q. 98\na. 1. Really private vices are outside the coercive jurisdiction of\nthe state\u2019s government and law. Though political authority is\nultimately derived from divine authority, it is not to be exercised in\nthe same all-encompassing way as God does when directing one (like\nevery other human individual) to the complete and heavenly fulfillment\ngratuitously and supernaturally offered to us all by God. Absolute\npolitical authority of the kind later claimed by rulers such as James\nI of England is contrary to Aquinas\u2019 constant teaching.\n\nThis reading of Aquinas as, in a nineteenth and twentieth century\njargon, \u201ca liberal\u201d (or \u201cthe first Whig\u201d) is\noften disputed, for there are statements in his writings which taken\nacontextually seem to assert the simpler and paternalistic\nAristotelian position.\n",
