    "main_text": "Extended Simples\n5. Extended Simples\n\nA simple is an entity that has no proper parts. Are there any simples?\nWithin the realm of spatiotemporal entities, some natural candidates\nare: spacetime points, fundamental particles such as electrons (or\ninstantaneous temporal parts of them), and perhaps certain universals,\ncertain tropes, or certain sets. On the other hand, it would seem to\nbe an empirically open possibility that all spatiotemporal entities\nare gunky.\n\nSay that an entity is extended just in case it is a\nspatiotemporal entity and does not have the shape and size of a point.\nIn this sense of \u2018extended\u2019, a solid cube would count as\nextended, but, given natural assumptions, so would a fusion of two\npoint-particles that are one foot apart. Although such a fusion is\nnaturally taken to have zero length, it would be a scattered object\nand so would not have the shape of a point.\n\nAre there any extended simples? Could there be? Those who answer\n\u2018No\u2019 to both questions will be inclined to accept\n\nNo Extended Simples (NXS)\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y[[L(x, y)\n& C(y)] \u2192 C(x)]\n\nNecessarily, if x is exactly located at y and\ny is complex, then x is complex.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, NXS does not say that extended simples are\nimpossible; rather, it says that simples with complex exact locations\nare impossible. It leaves open the possibility that there are extended\nsimple regions and extended simple entities that are exactly located\nat them. (For more on extended simple regions and discrete space or\nspacetime, see Forrest 1995, Tognazzini 2006, Braddon-Mitchell and\nMiller 2006, McDaniel 2007, Dainton 2010: 294\u2013301, Spencer 2010,\n2014, Hagar 2014, Jaeger 2014, and Kleinschmidt 2016.) And it rules\nout the possibility that there is a point-sized material simple that\nis exactly located at a point-sized but mereologically complex region\n(e.g., a region that is the fusion of several point-sized tropes each\nof which is at zero distance from each of the others).\n\nFor the most part, however, it will do no harm to treat the debate\nover extended simples as a debate over NXS. We can do so if we assume\nthat, necessarily, a region is extended if and only if it is complex.\nSo, in what follows, we will operate under that assumption unless we\nexplicitly note otherwise.\n",
