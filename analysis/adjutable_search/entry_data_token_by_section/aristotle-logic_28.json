    "main_text": "Dialectical Argument and the Art of Dialectic || Dialectical Premises: The Meaning of Endoxos\n8.1 Dialectical Premises: The Meaning of Endoxos\n\nRecent scholars have proposed different interpretations of the term\nendoxos. Aristotle often uses this adjective as a\nsubstantive: ta endoxa, \u201caccepted things\u201d,\n\u201caccepted opinions\u201d. On one understanding, descended from\nthe work of G. E. L. Owen and developed more fully by Jonathan Barnes\nand especially Terence Irwin, the endoxa are a compilation of\nviews held by various people with some form or other of standing:\n\u201cthe views of fairly reflective people after some\nreflection\u201d, in Irwin\u2019s phrase. Dialectic is then simply\n\u201ca method of argument from [the] common beliefs [held by these\npeople]\u201d. For Irwin, then, endoxa are \u201ccommon\nbeliefs\u201d. Jonathan Barnes, noting that endoxa are\nopinions with a certain standing, translates with\n\u201creputable\u201d.\n\nMy own view is that Aristotle\u2019s texts support a somewhat\ndifferent understanding. He also tells us that dialectical premises\ndiffer from demonstrative ones in that the former are\nquestions, whereas the latter are assumptions or\nassertions: \u201cthe demonstrator does not ask, but\ntakes\u201d, he says. This fits most naturally with a view of\ndialectic as argument directed at another person by question and\nanswer and consequently taking as premises that other person\u2019s\nconcessions. Anyone arguing in this manner will, in order to be\nsuccessful, have to ask for premises which the interlocutor is liable\nto accept, and the best way to be successful at that is to have an\ninventory of acceptable premises, i.e., premises that are in fact\nacceptable to people of different types.\n\nIn fact, we can discern in the Topics (and the\nRhetoric, which Aristotle says depends on the art explained\nin the Topics) an art of dialectic for use in such arguments.\nMy reconstruction of this art (which would not be accepted by all\nscholars) is as follows.\n",
