    "main_text": "Esotericism\n7. Esotericism\n\n\nSince the publication of the Guide, scholars have struggled\nwith a thorny issue: whether to take Maimonides\u2019 words at face value or\nwhether to take them as hints or clues pointing to a hidden or deeper\nmeaning (Ravitzky 1981, 1990, 2005; Strauss 1952). By rejecting\nliteral interpretation and playing down the importance of miracles, he\nknew he was taking a controversial stand. As he notes in the\nIntroduction to the Guide, Jewish law prohibits one from\ndiscussing esoteric matters like the Account of the Beginning or the\nAccount of the Chariot in public. The idea is that these matters should\nonly be discussed with an advanced student capable of finding the truth\non her own. In Maimonides\u2019 view, both the Bible and the rabbinic\ncommentaries that grew up around it are esoteric in the sense that the\nreal meaning is often different from the surface or apparent meaning.\nThe reason for this is that the people who read them have different\nlevels of comprehension. But Maimonides goes further, saying that in\nsome cases it is necessary for an author to contradict himself.\n\n\nOf the seven reasons for using contradictions, Maimonides says he\nwill avail himself of two. The first is relatively unproblematic:\nsometimes it is necessary for a teacher to say one thing to reach a\nstudent\u2019s level of understanding and say something else when the\nstudent becomes more advanced. The second is more troublesome: on very\nobscure matters, it is necessary to launch a discussion that proceeds\naccording to one assumption and later launch one that proceeds\naccording to another. He then adds: \u201cIn such cases the vulgar\nmust in no way be aware of the contradiction; the author accordingly\nuses some device to conceal it by all means.\u201d\n\n\nThis raises several questions. (1) Does Maimonides employ\ncontradictions of the troublesome variety? (2) If so, where? (3) Of two\ncontradictory discussions, which represents his view? In the\ntwentieth century, Leo Strauss argued that contradictions are central\nto understanding the Guide and that the more evidence\nMaimonides presents for a particular view, the less likely it is that\nhe held it (Strauss 1952). There is general agreement that\nMaimonides\u2019 writing is esoteric to the degree that he addresses\ndifficult topics and does not put everything he has to say on a\nparticular topic in any one place. The question is whether his\nesotericism goes deeper than this. We saw for example that he\ncriticizes Aristotle\u2019s on the eternity of the world. Does this mean\nthat he believed in creation or that if you strip away the surface\nmeaning, he is really committed to eternity? As often happens, one\nquestion leads to another: Do we settle the matter by examining the\nstrength of his arguments or by looking for hidden clues? Of late the\nesotericist reading appears to be losing favor (Davidson 2005, Ivry\n1991, Manekin 2005, Ravitzky 2005, Seeskin 2000).\n",
