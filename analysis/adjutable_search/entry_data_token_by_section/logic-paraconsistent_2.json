This contemporary view, however, should be put in a historical\nperspective. It was towards the end of the nineteenth century, when\nthe study of logic achieved mathematical articulation, that an\nexplosive logical theory became the standard. With the work of\nlogicians such as Boole, Frege, Russell and Hilbert, classical logic\nbecame the orthodox logical account.\n\nIn antiquity, however, no one seems to have endorsed the validity of\nECQ. Aristotle presented what is sometimes called the connexive\nprinciple: \u201cit is impossible that the same thing should be\nnecessitated by the being and by the not-being of the same\nthing\u201d (Prior Analytic II 4 57b3). (Connexive logic has\nrecently been reinvigorated by Wansing, e.g. Omori and Wansing 2019; see the entry on\n connexive logic\n that has been developed based on this principle.) This principle\nbecame a topic of debates in the Middle Ages or Medieval time. Though\nthe medieval debates seem to have been carried out in the context of\nconditionals, we can also see it as debates about consequences. The\nprinciple was taken up by\n Boethius\n (480\u2013524 or 525) and\n Abelard\n (1079\u20131142), who considered two accounts of consequences. The\nfirst one is a familiar one: it is impossible for the premises to be\ntrue but conclusion false. The first account is thus similar to the\ncontemporary notion of truth-preservation. The second one is less\naccepted recently: the sense of the premises contains that of the\nconclusion. This account, as in some\n relevant logics (like Brady\u2019s logic of meaning containment (Brady 2006)),\n does not permit an inference whose conclusion is arbitrary. Abelard\nheld that the first account fails to meet the connexive principle and\nthat the second account (the account of containment) captured\nAristotle\u2019s principle.\n\nAbelard\u2019s position was shown to face a difficulty by Alberic of\nParis in the 1130s. Most medieval logicians didn\u2019t, however,\nabandon the account of validity based on containment or something\nsimilar (see, for example, Martin 1987). But one way to handle the\ndifficulty is to reject the connexive principle. This approach, which\nhas become most influential, was accepted by the followers of Adam\nBalsham or Parvipontanus (or sometimes known as Adam of The Little\nBridge [12th century]). The Parvipontanians embraced the\ntruth-preservation account of consequences and the\n\u2018paradoxes\u2019 that are associated with it. In fact, it was a\nmember of the Parvipontanians, William of Soissons, who discovered in\nthe twelfth century what we now call the C.I. Lewis (independent)\nargument for ECQ (see Martin 1986).\n\nThe containment account, however, did not disappear.\n John Duns Scotus\n (1266\u20131308) and his followers accepted the containment account\n(see Martin 1996). The Cologne School of the late fifteenth century\nargued against ECQ by rejecting disjunctive syllogism (see\nSylvan 2000).\n\nIn the history of logic in Asia, there is a tendency (for example, in\nJaina and Buddhist traditions) to consider the possibility of\nstatements being both true and false. Moreover, the logics developed\nby the major Buddhist logicians, Dign\u0101ga (5th century)\nand Dharmak\u012brti (7th century) do not embrace ECQ.\nTheir logical account is, in fact, based on the\n\u2018pervasion\u2019 (Skt: vy\u0101pti, Tib: khyab\npa) relation among the elements of an argument. Just like the\ncontainment account of Abelard, there must be a tighter connection\nbetween the premises and conclusion than the truth-preservation\naccount allows. For the logic of Dharmak\u012brti and its subsequent\ndevelopment, see for example Dunne 2004, and Tillemans 1999, 2016.\n",
