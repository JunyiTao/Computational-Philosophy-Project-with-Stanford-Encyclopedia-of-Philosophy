    "main_text": "Experimental Evidence\n6. Experimental Evidence\n\nIn what follows we focus on lab experiments that identify social norms\nby explicitly measuring both empirical and normative expectations.\n\nXiao and Bicchieri (2010) designed an experiment to investigate the\nimpact on trust games of two potentially applicable\u2014but\nconflicting\u2014principles of conduct, namely, equality and\nreciprocity. Note that the former can be broadly defined as a\nrule that recommends minimizing payoff differences, whereas the latter\nrecommends taking a similar action as others (regardless of payoff\nconsiderations). The experimental design involved two trust game\nvariants: in the first one, players started with equal endowments; in\nthe second one, the investor was endowed with twice the money that the\ntrustee was given. In both cases, the investor could choose to\ntransfer a preset amount of money to the trustee or keep it all. Upon\nreceiving the money, the trustee could in turn keep it or else\ntransfer back some of it to the investor: in the equal endowment\ncondition (\u201cbaseline treatment\u201d), both equality and\nreciprocity dictate that the trustee transfer some money back to the\ninvestor; by contrast, in the unequal endowment condition\n(\u201casymmetry treatment\u201d), equality and reciprocity dictate\ndifferent actions as the trustee could guarantee payoff equality only\nby making a zero back-transfer. Xiao and Bicchieri elicited\nsubjects\u2019 first- and second-order empirical beliefs\n(\u201chow much do you think other participants in your role will\ntransfer to their counterpart?\u201d; \u201cwhat does your\ncounterpart think you will do?\u201d) and normative\nexpectations (\u201chow much do you think your counterpart\nbelieves you should transfer to her?\u201d). The experimental results\nshow that a majority of trustees returned a positive amount whenever\nreciprocity would reduce payoff inequality (in the baseline\ntreatment); by contrast, a majority of trustees did not reciprocate\nthe investors\u2019 transfer when doing so would increase payoff\ninequality (in the asymmetry treatment). Moreover, investors correctly\nbelieved that less money would be returned in the asymmetry treatment\nthan in the baseline treatment, and most trustees correctly estimated\ninvestors\u2019 beliefs in both treatments. However, in the asymmetry\ntreatment empirical beliefs and normative expectations conflicted:\nthis highlights that, when there is ambiguity as to which principle of\nconduct is in place, each subject will support the rule of behavior\nthat favors her most.\n\nReuben and Riedl (2013) examine the enforcement of norms of\ncontribution to public goods in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups,\nsuch as groups whose members vary in their endowment, contribution\ncapacity, or marginal benefits. In particular, Reuben and Riedl are\ninterested in the normative appeal of two potentially applicable\nrules: the efficiency rule (prescribing maximal contributions\nby all) and the class of relative contribution rules\n(prescribing a contribution that is \u201cfair\u201d relative to the\ncontributions of others; e.g., equality and equity rules). Reuben and\nRiedl\u2019s results show that, in the absence of punishment, no\npositive contribution norm emerged and all groups converged toward\nfree-riding. By contrast, with punishment, contributions were\nconsistent with the prescriptions of the efficiency rule in a\nsignificant subset of groups (irrespective of the type of group\nheterogeneity); in other groups, contributions were consistent with\nrelative contribution rules. These results suggest that even in\nheterogeneous groups individuals can successfully enforce a\ncontribution norm. Most notably, survey data involving third parties\nconfirmed well-defined yet conflicting normative views about the\naforementioned contribution rules; in other words, both efficiency and\nrelative contribution rules are normatively appealing, and are indeed\npotential candidates for emerging contribution norms in different\ngroups.\n\nBicchieri and Chavez (2010) designed an experiment to investigate norm\ncompliance in ultimatum games. Specifically, their experiment involved\na variant of the ultimatum game whereby the proposer could choose one\nof the following three options: ($5, $5), ($8, $2),\nor Coin (in which case one of the other two allocations would\nbe selected at random). This design allows for two plausible notions\nof fairness: as an equal outcome ($5, $5) or as a fair\nprocedure (Coin). The experimenters elicited subjects\u2019\nnormative expectations about the actions they thought would be\nconsidered fair by most participants: proposers and responders showed\na remarkable degree of agreement in their notions of fairness, as most\nsubjects believed that a majority of participants deemed both ($5, $5)\nand Coin to be appropriate. Further, the experimenters had subjects\nplay three instances of the above ultimatum game under different\ninformation conditions. In the \u201cfull information\u201d\ncondition, all participants knew that the Coin option was available,\nand that responders would know if their respective proposer had chosen\nCoin. In the \u201cprivate information\u201d condition, responders\ndid not know that Coin was available to proposers, and proposers were\naware of responders\u2019 ignorance. In the \u201climited\ninformation\u201d condition, participants knew that the Coin option\nwas available, but responders would not be able to distinguish whether\ntheir respective proposer had implemented one of the two allocations\ndirectly or had chosen Coin instead. The experimental results show\nthat when normative expectations supporting the Coin option were\neither absent (in the private condition) or could be defied\nwithout consequence (in the limited condition), the frequency\nof choice of ($5, $5) and ($8, $2), respectively, were considerably\nhigher than those of Coin. Moreover, the frequency of Coin choices was\nhighest in the public information condition, where such\noption was common knowledge and its outcome transparent: this shows\nthat there proposers followed the rule of behavior that favored them\nmost, and that such a rule was effectively a social norm. On the other\nhand, substantial norm evasion characterized proposers\u2019 behavior\nin the limited information condition, where ($8, $2) was the most\nfrequent choice.\n\nIn a subsequent study, Chavez and Bicchieri (2013) measured empirical\nand normative expectations (as well as behavior) of third parties who\nwere given the opportunity to add to or deduct from the payoffs of\nsubjects who had participated in an ultimatum game. Third parties\ntended to reward subjects involved in equal allocations and to\ncompensate victims of unfair allocations (rather than punish unfair\nbehavior); on the other hand, third parties were willing to punish\nwhen compensation was not an available option. The experimental\nresults further show that third parties shared a notion of fairness\n(as indicated by their normative expectations), and that such notion\nwas sensitive to contextual differences.\n\nKrupka and Weber (2013) introduced an interesting procedure for\nidentifying social norms by means of pre-play coordination games. In\nbrief, using alternative (between-subjects) variants of the dictator\ngame, Krupka and Weber had participants assess the extent to which\ndifferent actions were collectively perceived as socially appropriate:\nsubjects providing these ratings effectively faced a coordination\ngame, as they were incentivized to match the modal response given by\nothers in the same situation (such a pre-play coordination game was\nintended to verify the presence of shared normative expectations).\nKrupka and Weber went on to use these elicited assessments to predict\nother subjects\u2019 compliance with the relevant social norm in each\ndictator game variant (for another application of the same elicitation\nprocedure, see G\u00e4chter et al. 2013).\n\nSimilarly, Schram and Charness\u2019 (2015) proposed a procedure for\ninducing a shared understanding of the relevant rule of behavior, in\nthe lab. In short, Schram and Charness had participants in dictator\ngames receive advice from a group of third parties. The information\nreceived simply revealed what a group of uninvolved subjects thought\ndictators ought to do: as such, the information received\ngenerated an exogenous variation in the dictators\u2019 normative\nexpectations. Schram and Charness\u2019 results show that choices are\nindeed affected by this information.\n\nBicchieri and Xiao (2009) designed an experiment to investigate what\nhappens when empirical and normative expectations conflict. To that\nend, participants in a dictator game were exposed to different pieces\nof information. Specifically, two groups of dictators were given some\n\u201cdescriptive information\u201d; that is, they were told what\nother subjects had done in another session (i.e., one group\nwas told that previous participants had made for the most part a\ngenerous offer, while the other group was told that most participants\nhad made a selfish offer). Further, another two groups of dictators\nwere given some \u201cnormative information\u201d; that is, they\nwere told what previous subjects said ought to be done (i.e.,\none group was told that most previous participants thought that one\nshould make a generous offer, while the other group was told that most\nparticipants thought that one should make a selfish offer). Other\ngroups were given both descriptive and normative information. The\nexperimental results show that\u2014whenever such information did not\nconflict\u2014both descriptive and normative messages had a\nsignificant influence on dictators\u2019 own expectations and\nsubsequent choices. When messages conflicted in that one indicated\ngenerosity and the other indicated selfishness, only the descriptive\ninformation affected dictators\u2019 behavior. This suggests that if\npeople recognize that others are breaching the norm, then they will no\nlonger feel compelled to follow the relevant rule of behavior\nthemselves.\n\nTo conclude, the studies surveyed here provide evidence of the role\nplayed by expectations in affecting behavior in a variety of social\ndilemmas. In this regard, we note that in contrast to the vast\nliterature on empirical beliefs, the number of lab studies that\ndirectly measure normative expectations is relatively limited: more\nresearch is clearly needed to investigate the interplay of empirical\nand normative information about applicable rules of behavior.\n",
