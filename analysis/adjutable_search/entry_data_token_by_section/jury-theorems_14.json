    "main_text": "Problems and Questions || Do correctness facts exist?\n4.1 Do correctness facts exist?\n\nThe controversial philosophical premise of jury theorems is that\nalternatives are factually correct or incorrect (or of some degree of\ncorrectness). The (possibly composite) fact that determines\ncorrectness is called the state of the world or just\n state.[14]\n\nTo disambiguate, notice that formal models often use simplified\nnotions of the state. Firstly, many models reduce the state to its\nunknown part; for instance, the state in a court decision might be\nmodelled as the fact of whether a crime has been committed, treating\nall other determinants of correct verdicts (such as the right\ninterpretation of the law, but also logical or physical facts) as\nknown background facts not worth modelling. Secondly, and more\nradically, many models identify the state with the correct alternative\nitself; they might take the state in a court decision to be\nthe correct verdict (\u201cconvict\u201d or\n\u201cacquit\u201d).\n\nSetting modelling practice aside, which (known or unknown) facts\ndetermine correctness, i.e., constitute the state? One can distinguish\nbetween logical, empirical and normative facts. When a group of\nlogicians votes on whether an argument is valid, correctness depends\non logical facts. When a panel of climate experts predicts the average\nglobal surface temperature in 2100, correctness also depends on\nempirical facts. When a parliament decides on whether to allocate more\nfunding to the health system, correctness depends on normative facts,\nbesides empirical (and logical) facts. In many social decisions,\ncorrectness depends both on unknown empirical facts and unknown\nnormative facts, particularly for decisions on actions or on beliefs\nabout what is valuable or ought to be done.\n\nCritics of jury theorems often question the very notion of\ncorrectness. Some doubt the existence of normative facts necessary for\ncorrectness in political, moral, or other evaluative decisions. This\ncritique is often voiced in the form that there is no\n\u201ctruth\u201d pertaining to decisions in a certain domain (e.g.,\nMuirhead 2014 criticizing Landemore 2013; cf. Gaus 2011 for how\nEstlund 2008 stakes out the domain of truth-apt political claims).\nCertain decisions might indeed be non-epistemic. Judgments of taste,\nfor instance, might express desires, or perhaps beliefs without\ncorrectness fact. For moral judgments, both the existence and the\nnature of correctness facts is controversial.\n\nNote, however, that the existence of moral and other normative facts\ndoes not depend on meta-ethical realism, universalism, or naturalism.\nConstructivism about moral facts, for example, could provide an\nintersubjectively shared social fact that is perfectly suitable for\njury theorems, as long as the construction predates decision-making,\ni.e., occurs previously in the society.\n\nIn sum, all that jury theorems need is the existence of correctness\nfacts of some kind that are process-independent, i.e.,\nindependent of the choice of group (size), the deliberation, and the\naggregation.\n\nIn political settings, the real problem often lies not in non-existent\ncorrectness facts, but in ambiguously defined decision problems. For\nexample, in presidential elections, is the question who best promotes\nthe public good, or who best satisfies the citizens\u2019\npreferences? Ambiguous decision problems lead to ambiguous correctness\nstandards. Jury theorems stay applicable in principle,\nsubject to resolving ambiguities.\n",
