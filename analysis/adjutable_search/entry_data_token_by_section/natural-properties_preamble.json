    "main_text": "\n\nConsider the following pairs of properties. (As is common in the\nliterature on this topic, this entry will use the words\n\u2018property\u2019 and \u2018relation\u2019 interchangeably.\nProperties in the usual sense are distinguished as\n\u201cmonadic\u201d, and relations in the usual sense as\n\u201cpolyadic\u201d.)\n\n\n\nColumn\u00a01\nColumn\u00a02\n\nbeing a triangle\nbeing a three-to-five sided figure none of whose sides is more\nthan one-and-a-half times as long as any other \n\nintersecting at an angle of 90 degrees\nintersecting at an angle of 87 degrees \n\nbeing electrically charged\nbeing negatively charged and not part of a fish \n\nbeing composed entirely of carbon dioxide molecules\nbeing a cappucino \n\nbeing green\nbeing grue (Goodman\n 1954):\n either green and observed before a certain time \\(t\\) or blue and not\nobserved before \\(t\\). \n\nbeing natural numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) such that \\(z =\nx+y\\).\nbeing natural numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) such that \\(z\\) is\n\\(x\\) quus \\(y\\) (Kripke\n 1982):\n that is, either \\(z=x+y\\) and \\(x+y\\lt 57\\), or \\(z=5\\) and \\(x+y\\ge\n57\\). \n\n\nTable 1. Pairs of properties\n\n\nIt is easy to get enough of a feel for what is going on in this table\nto the point where one could confidently say, for many other such\npairs, which would be better to put in Column\u00a01 and which in the\nColumn\u00a02. This article is concerned with a semi-technical use of\nthe word \u2018natural\u2019 which can be illustrated by these\nexamples: in each case, the property in the Column\u00a01 is more\nnatural than the corresponding property in the Column\u00a02.\nThis use has deep historical roots (see\n \u00a72),\n but was cemented in a seminal paper by David Lewis\n (1983),\n and has subsequently been taken up by many other authors.\n\nDespite what the word may suggest, the claim that one property is more\nnatural than another is not meant to entail that the latter is in any\nsense created or influenced by human beings to a greater extent than\nthe former. Even when a property is highly unnatural, we may have\nlittle or no ability to influence what instantiates it, or whether it\nexists. (Indeed many hold that all properties exist necessarily.) For\nthis reason it may be misleading to use \u2018artificial\u2019 as\nthe antonym of \u2018natural\u2019. \u2018Arbitrary\u2019 is\nbetter, and \u2018gerrymandered\u2019 is popular.\n\nThose who use \u2018natural\u2019 in the relevant way conceive\nnaturalness to be an objective matter, at least in the\nfollowing sense: if \\(F\\) is more natural than \\(G\\), \\(F\\) would\nstill have been more natural than \\(G\\) if our interests and practices\nhad been very different, and indeed even if intelligent life had not\nexisted at all. Most would endorse the stronger claim that when \\(F\\)\nis more natural than \\(G\\), it is necessary that \\(F\\) is\nmore natural than\n \\(G\\).[1]\n\n\nLike most philosophical terms of art which lack official,\nuncontroversial definitions, the relevant use of \u2018natural\u2019\nis controversial: many philosophers regard it as too unclear, or too\nclosely tied to some false presupposition, to be helpful. Among this\ngroup, some would go so far as to deny that there is any\ninteresting or theoretically important relation holding between the\npairs of properties listed in the above table, at least if we set\naside relations (like being expressible more briefly than)\nwhose pattern of instantiation would have been different if our\ninterests or practices had been different. On this picture, the very\nidea that some properties are more natural than others embodies a\nmistaken projection onto the world itself of differences which are in\nfact just a matter of the contingent concerns and purposes of human\nbeings.\n\nNevertheless, the notion of a natural property has enjoyed a wide\ncurrency in recent philosophy, especially in metaphysics. Lewis\ndevelops a rich body of theory in which naturalness plays a central\npart, and other philosophers have built on and modified Lewis\u2019s\nideas in various ways. As we will see in\n \u00a73,\n naturalness has been invoked in theorising about a wide range of\ntopics, including similarity, modality, laws of nature, mental and\nlinguistic content, ampliative inference, and epistemic value. These\nroles provide many different ways of getting a grip on what\nnaturalness is supposed to be, and why it might be interesting and\ntheoretically important.\n",
