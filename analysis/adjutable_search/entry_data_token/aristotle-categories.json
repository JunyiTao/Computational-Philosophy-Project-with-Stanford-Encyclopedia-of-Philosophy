It not only presents the backbone of Aristotle\u2019s\nown philosophical theorizing but has exerted an unparalleled influence\non the systems of many of the greatest philosophers in the western\ntradition. The set of doctrines in the Categories, which I\nwill henceforth call categorialism, provides the framework of\ninquiry for a wide variety of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical\ninvestigations, ranging from his discussions of time and change in the\nPhysics to the science of being qua being in the\nMetaphysics, and even extending to his rejection of Platonic\nethics in the Nicomachean Ethics. Looking beyond his own\nworks, Aristotle\u2019s categorialism has engaged the attention of\nsuch diverse philosophers as Plotinus, Porphyry, Aquinas, Descartes,\nSpinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Brentano, and\nHeidegger (to mention just a few), who have variously embraced,\ndefended, modified or rejected its central contentions. All, in their\ndifferent ways, have thought it necessary to come to terms with\nfeatures of Aristotle\u2019s categorial scheme.\n\nPlainly, the enterprise of categorialism inaugurated by Aristotle runs\ndeep in the philosophical psyche. Even so, despite its wide-reaching\ninfluence \u2014 and, indeed owing to that influence \u2014 any\nattempt to describe categorialism faces a significant difficulty:\nexperts disagree on many of its most important and fundamental\naspects. Each of the following questions has received markedly\ndifferent answers from highly respected scholars and philosophers.\nWhat do the categories classify? What theory of predication underlies\nAristotle\u2019s scheme? What is the relationship between\ncategorialism and hylemorphism, Aristotle\u2019s other major\nontological theory? Where does matter fit, if at all, in the\ncategorial scheme? When did Aristotle write the Categories?\nDid Aristotle write the Categories? Is the list of\nkinds in the Categories Aristotle\u2019s considered list, or\ndoes he modify his views elsewhere? Is Aristotle\u2019s view of\nsubstance in the Categories consistent with his view of\nsubstance in the Metaphysics? Is there some method that\nAristotle used in order to generate his list of categories? Is\nAristotle\u2019s categorialism philosophically defensible in whole or\nin part? If only in part, which part of categorialism is\nphilosophically defensible?\n\nGiven the divergence of expert opinion about even the most basic\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s Categories, it is inevitable\nthat an attempt to give a neutral account of the basic positions it\ncontains will be seen as wrong-headed, perhaps drastically so, by some\nscholars or other. One could attempt to address this problem by\ncommenting on every scholarly debate and opinion, but such a project\nwould fail to bring to life the most striking features of Aristotelian\ncategorialism. In what follows, therefore, I shall take a different\nroute. I first present a natural, though perhaps overly simplified,\ninterpretation of the main structures in Aristotle\u2019s categorial\nscheme, while pausing en route to note some especially\ncontroversial points. I then go on to discuss one important scholarly\nand philosophical debate about the categories, namely the question of\nwhether there is some systematic procedure by which Aristotle\ngenerated his famous list. The debate is of interest in large part\nbecause it concerns one of the most fundamental metaphysical topics:\nwhat is the correct system of categories? I am not ultimately\nconcerned to present the correct interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s Categories. Rather, I only hope to provide\na useful introduction to the content of this endlessly fascinating\nwork.\n", "toc": [{"#FouFolDiv": "1.

The Four-Fold Division\n\nThe Categories divides naturally into three distinct parts\n\u2014 what have come to be known as the Pre-Predicamenta\n(chs.1\u20134), the Predicamenta (chs. 5\u20139), and the\nPost-Predicamenta (chs. 10-15). (These section titles reflect\nthe traditional Latin title of the entire work, the\nPredicamenta.) In the Pre-Predicamenta, Aristotle\ndiscusses a number of semantic relations (1a1\u201316), gives a\ndivision of beings (\u03c4\u1f03 \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1), into four\nkinds (1a20\u20131b9), and then presents his canonical list of ten\ncategories (1b25\u20132a4). In the Predicamenta, Aristotle\ndiscusses in detail the categories of substance (2a12\u20134b19),\nquantity (4b20\u20136a36), relatives (6a37\u20138b24), and quality\n(8b25\u201311a39), and provides a cursory treatment of the other\ncategories (11b1\u201314). And finally, in the\nPost-Predicamenta, he discusses a number of concepts relating\nto modes of opposition (11b15\u201314A25), priority and simultaneity\n(14a26\u201315a13), motion (15a14\u201315b17), and ends with a brief\ndiscussion of having (15b18\u201331). There is considerable debate\nabout whether Aristotle thought all three parts belong to a single\nwork, and if he did, why he thought they are all needed for the work\nto be a unified whole. There is nonetheless widespread agreement that\nat the very heart of the Categories are two systems of\nclassification, one given in the Pre-Predicamenta, and the\nother in the Predicamenta.\n\nAristotle\u2019s first system of classification is of beings,\n(\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) (1a20). The division proceeds\nby way of two concepts: (1) said-of and (2) present-in. Any being,\naccording to Aristotle, is either said-of another or is not said-of\nanother. Likewise, any being is either present-in another or is not\npresent-in another. Because these are technical notions, one would\nexpect Aristotle to have defined them. Unfortunately, he does not\ndefine the said-of relation; and his definition of the present-in\nrelation is either circular or rests on an undefined concept of being\nin. He says: \u2018By \u201cpresent in a subject\u201d I mean what\nis in something, not as a part, and cannot exist separately from what\nit is in\u2019 (1a24\u20135). Notice that the word \u2018in\u2019\noccurs in this definition of present-in. So, either \u2018in\u2019\nmeans the same as \u2018present-in\u2019, in which case the\ndefinition is circular; or \u2018in\u2019 is itself in need of a\ndefinition, which Aristotle does not give. Hence, Aristotle\u2019s\nfirst system of classification rests on technical concepts whose\nprecise characterization is not settled by anything Aristotle\nsays.\n\nDespite the lack of helpful definitions of these two concepts, there\nis a fairly straightforward, though certainly not uncontroversial,\ncharacterization of them that many scholars have adopted. By focusing\non Aristotle\u2019s illustrations, most scholars conclude that beings\nthat are said-of others are universals, while those that are not\nsaid-of others are particulars. Beings that are present-in others are\naccidental, while those that are not present-in others are\nnon-accidental. Now, non-accidental beings that are universals are\nmost naturally described as essential, while non-accidental beings\nthat are particulars are best described simply as non-accidental. If\nwe put these possibilities together, we arrive at the following\nfour-fold system of classification: (1) accidental universals; (2)\nessential universals; (3) accidental particulars; (4) non-accidental\nparticulars, or what Aristotle calls primary substances. This\nsystem maps readily onto Aristotle\u2019s own terminology, given at\n1a20: (1) Said-of and present-in: accidental universals; (2) Said-of\nand not present-in: essential universals; (3) Not said-of and\npresent-in: accidental particulars; and (4) Not said-of and not\npresent-in: primary substances. A brief discussion of each of these\nclasses should suffice to bring out their general character.\n1.1 Not Said-Of and Not Present-In\n\nThe pride of place in this classificatory scheme, according to\nAristotle, goes to those entities that are neither said-of nor\npresent-in anything. Such entities, Aristotle says, are primary\nsubstances (2a11). Although he only gives a negative characterization\nof primary substances in the Categories \u2014 they are\nneither said-of nor present-in \u2014 the examples\nof them that he provides allow us to form a more robust conception of\nwhat a primary substance is supposed to be. His favorite examples are\nan individual man and a horse (1a20, 2a11). So, it is natural to\ninterpret him as thinking that among primary substances are concrete\nparticulars that are members of natural kinds. Whether in the\nCategories Aristotle intended to restrict the class of\nprimary substances to just members of natural kinds turns out to be\namong the more controversial topics in Aristotle scholarship. But at\nthe very least, he seems to think that members of natural kinds\npresent enough of a paradigmatic case that he can use them as\nexamples.\n\nNow, given the above interpretation of the said-of and present-in\nrelation, a primary substance is a particular that is non-accidental.\nIt must be admitted that it is difficult to say exactly what it means\nto say that a particular is non-accidental. In highlighting the fact\nthat primary substances are not the sorts of beings that can be\naccidents, Aristotle seems to be indicating both that they are not\npredicated of anything accidentally and that they are not entities\nthat are manifestly temporary, accidentally characterized, or\nartificially unified, such as Socrates-seated-in-a-chair. Similarly,\nby treating them as not said-of anything, Aristotle draws attention to\nthe fact that primary substances are not predicated of anything\neither. Rather, they are themselves essential unities, and indeed not\npredicable at all. Beyond these few remarks, however, it is difficult\nto say exactly, given only what is made explicit in the\nPre-predicamenta what a primary substance is. But this, one might\nargue, is appropriate for a metaphysically fundamental entity \u2014\nwe can say of it what it is not, but because it is so basic, we lack\nthe vocabulary to say in an informative way what it is. And indeed,\nAristotle thinks that primary substances are fundamental in this way\nsince he thinks that all other entities bear some type of asymmetric\ndependence relation to primary substances (2a34\u20132b6).\n1.2 Not Said-Of and Present-In\n\nIf we continue to understand the said-of and present-in distinctions\nas I have characterized them, we will also find that Aristotle thinks\nthat in addition to particulars in the category of substance there are\naccidental, or what we can now call non-substantial,\nparticulars. Aristotle\u2019s example of such an entity is an\nindividual piece of grammatical knowledge (1a25). Perhaps a more\nintuitive example is the particular whiteness that some object has. If\nthere are non-substantial particulars, then Socrates\u2019 whiteness\nis a numerically distinct particular from Plato\u2019s whiteness.\nContemporary metaphysicians might call such entities tropes, and such\na label is acceptable as long as one is careful not to expect\nAristotle\u2019s theory to resemble too much contemporary trope\ntheories. In the first instance, if Aristotle does accept the\nexistence of non-substantial particulars, he certainly does not think\nthat they can exist apart from primary substances \u2014 indeed, it\nis most natural to interpret Aristotle on this point as thinking that\na non-substantial particular is a dependent entity, individuated only\nby reference to the primary substance that it is present in. Hence,\nSocrates\u2019 whiteness cannot exist without Socrates. Moreover,\nthinking of such entities as standing in a primitive relation of\nresemblance to one another is quite foreign to Aristotle\u2019s way\nof thinking. Nonetheless, if the present interpretation is correct,\nAristotle did accept what are appropriately called particularized\nproperties.\n1.3 Said-Of and Not Present-In\n\nReturning, then, to those beings that are not-present in other beings,\nAristotle thinks that in addition to primary substances, which are\nparticulars, there are secondary substances, which are universals\n(2a11-a18). His example of such an entity is man (1a21), which,\naccording to the present interpretation, is a universal in the\ncategory of substance. If we again accept the distinctions in question\nas I have drawn them, we should interpret secondary substances as\nessential characteristics of primary substances. Moreover, because\nprimary substances seem to be members of natural kinds, it is natural\nto interpret secondary substances as the kinds to which primary\nsubstances belong. If that is so, then Aristotle thinks that not only\nare primary substances members of natural kinds but that they are\nessentially characterized by the kinds to which they belong.\n1.4 Said-Of and Present-In\n\nFinally, a being is both said-of and present-in a primary substance if\nit is an accidental universal. Aristotle\u2019s example of such an\nentity is knowledge; but again, whiteness provides a somewhat more\nintuitive example. The universal whiteness is said-of many primary\nsubstances but is only accidental to them.\n1.5 A Recent Debate\n\nThe way in which I have characterized the concepts of said-of and\npresent-in is, as I have said, natural and relatively straightforward.\nMoreover, it was by far the orthodox interpretation amongst\nAristotle\u2019s Medieval interpreters. I would be remiss, however,\nwere I not to mention the recent debate started by G.E.L. Owen about\nthe said-of/present-in distinction (Owen, 1965a). According to Owen,\nAristotle did not accept the existence of non-substantial particulars.\nInstead, Owen argues, a being that is not said-of but present-in\nprimary substances is an accidental universal of the lowest possible\ngenerality. Hence, Owen denies that the said-of/not-said-of\ndistinction is one between universals and particulars. I shall not\ndiscuss Owen\u2019s interpretation but shall simply note that it has\nspawned a huge deal of scholarly attention. The interested reader can\nfind a discussion of these issues here:\n\nSupplement on Nonsubstantial Particulars\n for\n Aristotle Metaphysics\n\n2. The Ten-Fold Division\n2.1 General Discussion\n\nAfter providing his first system of classification, Aristotle turns to\nthe predicamenta and presents a second, which ends up\noccupying him for much of the remainder of the Categories.\nAristotle divides what he calls ta legomena (\u03c4\u1f03\n\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1), i.e.\nthings that are said, into ten distinct kinds (1b25). Things\nthat are said according to Aristotle, are words (De Int\n16a3), and so it is natural to interpret his second system as a\nclassification of words. And because the English word\n\u2018category\u2019 comes from the Greek word for\npredicate, one might naturally think of the second system as\na classification of distinct types of linguistic predicates. There is,\nhowever, considerable debate about the subject matter of the second\nsystem of classification.\n\nThere are three reasons to think that Aristotle is not primarily\ninterested in words but rather in the objects in the world to which\nwords correspond. First, his locution ta legomena is in fact\nambiguous, as between \u2018things said\u2019\u2014where these\nmight or might not be words\u2014and \u2018things spoken\nof\u2019\u2014where these are more naturally taken to be things\nreferred to by means of words. Second, Aristotle\u2019s examples of\nitems belonging to the various categories are generally\nextra-linguistic. For instance, his examples of substances are an\nindividual man and a horse. Third, Aristotle explicitly accepts a\ndoctrine of meaning according to which words conventionally signify\nconcepts, and concepts naturally signify objects in the world (De\nInt 16a3). So, even if he is in some sense classifying words, it\nis natural to view his classification as ultimately driven by concerns\nabout objects in the world to which our words correspond.\n\nThose scholars dissatisfied with the linguistic interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s second system of classification have moved in one of\nseveral directions. Some have interpreted Aristotle as classifying\nconcepts. The objections raised against the linguistic interpretation,\nhowever, can again be raised against the concept interpretation as\nwell. Other scholars have interpreted Aristotle as classifying\nextra-linguistic and extra-conceptual reality. Finally, some scholars\nhave synthesized the linguistic and extra-linguistic interpretations\nby interpreting Aristotle as classifying linguistic predicates in\nso far as they are related to the world in semantically\nsignificant ways. Although I think that this latter interpretation is\nprobably the one that best withstands close textual scrutiny, the\ngeneral character of the second system of classification is most\neasily seen by focusing on the extra-linguistic interpretation. So, in\nwhat follows, I shall simplify matters by talking as if\nAristotle\u2019s first classificatory system is really a\nclassification of extra-linguistic items; and I shall note places at\nwhich such an interpretation faces difficulties.\n\nWhat then is Aristotle\u2019s second classificatory system? Quite\nsimply, it is a list of the highest kinds, which are also known as\ncategories. That there are highest kinds (or perhaps that\nthere is one single highest kind) can be motivated by noticing the\nfact that the ordinary objects of our experience fall into classes of\nincreasing generality. Consider, for instance, a maple tree. It is in\nthe first instance a maple and so belongs in a class with all and only\nother maples. It is also, however, a tree and so belongs in a broader\nclass, namely the class of trees, whose extension is wider than the\nclass of maples. Continuing on, it is also a living thing and so\nbelongs in a class whose extension is wider still than the class of\ntrees. And so on. Now, once this basic pattern is before us, we can\nask the following question: does this increase in generality go on ad\ninfinitum or does it end at a class that is the most general possible?\nDoes it end, in other words, at a highest kind?\n\nIt might seem that the answer to this question is obvious: of course\nthere is a highest kind \u2014 being. After all, someone might argue,\neverything exists. So the class that contains all and only beings must\nbe the class with the greatest possible extension. In the\nMetaphysics, however, Aristotle argues that being is not a\ngenus (998b23, 1059b31). According to Aristotle, every genus must be\ndifferentiated by some differentia that falls outside that genus.\nHence, if being were a genus, it would have to be differentiated by a\ndifferentia that fell outside of it. In other words, being would have\nto be differentiated by some non-being, which, according to Aristotle,\nis a metaphysical absurdity. Although he does not explicitly make this\nclaim, Aristotle\u2019s argument, if cogent, would generalize to any\nproposal for a single highest kind. Hence, he does not think that\nthere is one single highest kind. Instead, he thinks that there are\nten: (1) substance; (2) quantity; (3) quality; (4) relatives; (5)\nsomewhere; (6) sometime; (7) being in a position; (8) having; (9)\nacting; and (10) being acted upon (1b25\u20132a4). I shall discuss\nthe first four of these kinds in detail in a moment. But doing so will\ntake us into matters that, while interesting, nonetheless distract\nfrom the general nature of the scheme. So I will first discuss some of\nthe general structures inherent in Aristotle\u2019s second system of\nclassification, and then proceed to a more detailed discussion.\n\nIn addition to positing ten highest kinds, Aristotle also has views\nabout the structure of such kinds. Each kind is differentiated into\nspecies by some set of differentiae. In fact, the essence of any\nspecies, according to Aristotle, consists in its genus and the\ndifferentia that together with that genus defines the species. (It is\nfor this reason that the highest kinds are, strictly speaking,\nindefinable \u2014 because there is no genus above a highest kind,\none cannot define it in terms of its genus and a differentia.) Some of\nthe species in various categories are also genera \u2014 they are, in\nother words, differentiated into further species. But at some point,\nthere is a lowest species that is not further differentiated. Under\nthese species, we can suppose, fall the particulars that belong to\nthat species.\n\nNow, if we accept the characterization of said-of and present-in that\nI have given, we can see that Aristotle\u2019s two classificatory\nsystems can, so to speak, be laid on top of each other. The resulting\nstructure would look something like the following.\n\n\n\n\nSubstance\nQuantity\u00a0\u00a0Relatives\u00a0\u00a0Quality\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\n\n\nSaid-of\n\nNot Present-In\nSaid-of\n\nPresent-In \n\nNot Said-of\n\nNot Present-In\nNot Said-of\n\nPresent-In  \n\n\n\nSome features of this system are worth pointing out. First, as I have\nalready noted, Aristotle gives pride of place in this scheme to\nprimary substances. He says that were primary substances not to exist\nthen no other entity would exist (2b6). As a result, Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorialism is firmly anti-Platonic. Whereas Plato treated the\nabstract as more real than material particulars, in the\nCategories Aristotle takes material particulars as\nontological bedrock \u2014 to the extent that being a primary\nsubstance makes something more real than anything else, entities such\nas Socrates and a horse are the most real entities in\nAristotle\u2019s worldview. Moreover, among secondary substances,\nthose at a lower level of generality are what Aristotle calls\n\u2018prior in substance\u2019 than those at a higher level (2b7).\nSo, for instance, human is prior in substance than body. Whether this\nis to be interpreted in terms of the greater reality of the\nkind human is an open question. Nonetheless, Aristotle\u2019s\nequating an increase in generality with a decrease in substantiality\nis at least in spirit strongly anti-Platonic.\n\nThere is one other interesting general feature of this scheme that is\nworth pointing out before looking at its details. Aristotle\u2019s\nrejection of the view that being is a genus and his subsequent\nacceptance of ten distinct highest kinds leads to a doctrine\nconcerning being itself that is at the center of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. (It should be noted, however, that there is\ngenuine disagreement over the extent to which Aristotle accepted the\ndoctrine of being that appears in the Metaphysics when he\nwrote the Categories.) According to Aristotle, some words do\nnot express a genus but instead are what he calls pros hen\nhomonyms \u2014 that is, homonyms related to one thing (pros\nhen), variously called cases of \u2018focal meaning\u2019 or\n\u2018focal connection\u2019 or \u2018core-dependent\nhomonymy\u2019 in the literature on this topic (1003a35 ff.). Such\nwords are applicable to various items in the world in virtue of the\nfact that those items all bear some type of relation to some one thing\nor type of thing. An example of such a homonym, according to\nAristotle, is \u2018healthy\u2019. A regimen, he says, is healthy\nbecause it is productive of health; urine is healthy because it is\nindicative of health; and Socrates is healthy because he has health.\nIn this case, a regimen, urine, and Socrates are all called\n\u2018healthy\u2019 not because they stand under some one genus,\nnamely healthy things, but instead because they all bear some relation\nto health. Similarly, according to Aristotle, things in the world are\nnot beings because they stand under some genus, being, but rather\nbecause they all stand in a relation to the primary being, which in\nthe Categories he says is substance. This explains in part\nwhy he says in the Metaphysics that in order to study being\none must study substance (1004a32, 1028a10\u20131028b8).\n2.2 Detailed Discussion\n\nIt must be admitted, I think, that when stated in the abstract there\nis a certain beauty about the structure of Aristotle\u2019s two\nclassificatory schemes. Aristotle\u2019s system, however, begins to\nlook somewhat awkward when his list of highest kinds is scrutinized.\nSome of the categories are natural, but others seem much less so. As a\nresult, philosophers have proposed changes to Aristotle\u2019s list,\narguing that various categories should be eliminated, and scholars\nhave suggested that Aristotle\u2019s categories are not merely the\nhighest kinds but rather represent various complex relations between\nwords and different aspects of the world. A brief discussion of the\nfirst four categories, which are the only ones that Aristotle\ndiscusses at length, should bring out both the interest of\nAristotle\u2019s list as well as some of its peculiarities.\n2.2.1 Substance\n\nThe most fundamental category is substance. We have already seen that\naccording to Aristotle substances divide into primary and secondary\nsubstances. Although Aristotle does not discuss the different kinds of\nsecondary substances in the Categories, various remarks he\nmakes throughout his corpus suggest that he would divide secondary\nsubstances into at least the following kinds (DA 412a17,\n413a21, 414a35, Meta. 1069a30, NE 1098a4):\n\nSubstance\n\n\nImmobile Substances \u2014 Unmoved Mover(s)\nMobile Substances \u2014 Body\n\n\nEternal Mobile Substances \u2014 Heavens\nDestructible Mobile Substances \u2014 Sublunary bodies\n\n\nUnensouled Destructible Mobile Substances \u2014 Elements\nEnsouled Destructible Mobile Substances \u2014 Living things\n\n\nIncapable of Perception \u2014 Plants\nCapable of Perception \u2014 Animals\n\n\nIrrational \u2014 Non-Human Animals\nRational \u2014 Humans\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nThis genus/species hierarchy is far from complete \u2014\nAristotle\u2019s biological treatises contain a remarkably rich\ntaxonomy of animals that is neither captured nor indeed obviously\ncommensurate with the division into irrational and rational\nanimals\u2014 but it does nicely illustrate the general structure of\nAristotle\u2019s categories. The lowest species in this taxonomy give\nway to kinds of increasing generality until the highest kind,\nsubstance is reached. Moreover, there is something rather intuitive\nabout the idea that members of natural kinds are a fundamental type of\nentity in the world and hence that there is a system of kinds of\nincreasing generality to which each such entity belongs. Of course,\nsomeone might think that some kind stands above substance. But it is\nnot clear what such a kind would be except being, or perhaps the even\nmore general kind thing; and as I have already said, not only\ndoes Aristotle reject the idea that being is a genus, but it is\ndifficult to see what the relevant sense of thing is, if this\nis not simply another word for substance.\n2.2.2 Quantity\n\nThe second category Aristotle discusses in the Categories is\nquantity, and in the chapter devoted to quantity Aristotle actually\ndivides quantity into distinct species. In fact, he gives two\ndivisions; but for the sake of illustrating the general nature of the\ncategory, discussing the first division he gives should suffice.\nAccording to Aristotle, quantity divides into continuous and discrete\nquantities; continuous quantity divides into line, surface, body,\ntime, and place; and discrete quantity divides into number and speech\n(4b20\u201323). Hence, we have the following genus/species\nstructure:\n\nQuantity\n\n\nContinuous Quantities\n\n\nline\nsurface\nbody\ntime\nplace\n \nDiscrete Quantities\n\n\nnumber\nspeech\n \n \n\n\nLike substance, quantity seems like a reasonable candidate for a\nhighest kind \u2014 quantities exist; quantities are not substances;\nsubstances are not quantities, and it is not clear what kind would\nstand above quantity. So, Aristotle\u2019s decision to make quantity\na highest kind appears well motivated. Aristotle\u2019s treatment of\nquantity, however, does raise some difficult questions.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting question concerns the fact that some of\nthe species in quantity appear to be quantified things rather than\nquantities themselves. Consider, for instance, body. In its most\nnatural sense, \u2018body\u2019 signifies bodies, which are not\nquantities but rather things with quantities. The same is true of\nline, surface, place, and arguably speech. Of course, there are\nquantities naturally associated with some of these species. For\ninstance, length, breadth, and depth are associated with line, body,\nand surface. But Aristotle does not list these as the species under\nquantity. So, in the first instance, we can ask: does Aristotle intend\nhis division of Quantity to be a division of quantities or quantified\nthings?\n\nThe difficulties involved in Aristotle\u2019s list of species in the\ncategory of quantity can be made more precise by noting that in\nseveral places he seems to commit himself to the view that body is a\nspecies in the category of substance (Top. 130b2, DC\n2681\u20133, DA 434b12, Meta. 1079a31, 1069b38).\nAnd as I have drawn the genus-species structure in the category of\nsubstance above, body is one of the two species immediately under\nsubstance. Yet body also appears as a species under the species\nContinuous Quantity. The difficulty arises because Aristotle is\ncommitted to the view that no species can occur in both the category\nof substance and in some other category. For, he thinks that a species\nin substance is said-of primary substances while species in the other\ncategories are not said-of primary substances. Hence, any species in\nboth substance and some accidental category would be said-of and not\nsaid-of primary substance. Aristotle\u2019s list of species in the\nCategory of Quantity is thus not merely puzzling but seems to commit\nAristotle to a contradiction. So, a second question about\nAristotle\u2019s category of quantity naturally suggests itself: how\ncan body be a species in both the category of quantity and the\ncategory of substance? (Studtman 2002)\n\nA number of other questions about Quantity could be asked. For\ninstance, Aristotle\u2019s treatment of quantity in the\nMetaphysics includes species not present in his treatment in\nthe Categories (Meta. 1020a7\u201334), which raises\nquestions as to the extent to which the set of doctrines in the\nCategories coheres with the doctrines in his other physical\nand metaphysical works. Furthermore, questions about Aristotle\u2019s\nviews about the nature of some of the species in quantity arise. So,\nfor instance, to what does Aristotle think the species number\ncorresponds? He surely does not think that numbers exist apart from\nthe material world. But then what exactly does Aristotle think a\nnumber is? All we get for an answer from the Categories is\nthat number is a discrete quantity. But such an answer hardly provides\nmuch of an understanding as to what Aristotle has precisely in mind.\nMoreover, why does Aristotle include speech as a species in the\ncategory of quantity? Speech hardly seems like a natural candidate for\nthis category. Perhaps, Aristotle has in mind the quantities of vowels\nand syllables of Greek words. But, if anything, speech would seem to\nbe some kind of vocal sound, which arguably is a kind of affection.\nEach of these questions is interesting and worth pursuing. I shall\nnot, however, offer any answers to them here. Rather, I hope only to\nhave illustrated how deeply intriguing and yet difficult to pin down\nfully Aristotle\u2019s Categories is.\n2.2.3 Relatives\n\nAfter quantity, Aristotle discusses the category of relatives, which\nboth interpretively and philosophically raises even more difficulties\nthan his discussion of quantity. A contemporary philosopher might\nnaturally think that this category contains what we would nowadays\ncall \u2018relations\u2019. But this would be a mistake. The name\nfor the category is ta pros ti (\u03c4\u1f70\n\u03c0\u03c1\u1f79\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9), which literally means\n\u2018things toward something\u2019. In other words, Aristotle seems\nto be classifying not relations but rather things in the world in so\nfar as they are toward something else. It would seem, however, that\nfor Aristotle things are toward something else insofar as a relational\npredicate applies to them. Aristotle says: Things are called\n\u2018relative\u2019 if as such they are said to be of\nsomething else or to be somehow referred to something else. So, for\ninstance, the greater, as such, is said to be of something\nelse, for it is said to be greater than something (6a36).\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward reading of Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion is the following. He noticed that certain predicates in\nlanguage are logically incomplete \u2014 they are not used in simple\nsubject/predicate sentences of the form \u2018a is\nF\u2019 but rather require some type of completion. To say\n\u2018three is greater\u2019 is to say something that is incomplete\n\u2014 to complete it requires saying what three is greater than.\nNonetheless, Aristotle accepted a doctrine according to which\nproperties in the world always inhere in a single subject. In other\nwords, although Aristotle countenanced relational predicates, and\nthough he certainly thought that objects in the world are related to\nother objects, he did not accept relations as a genuine type of\nentity. So, Aristotle\u2019s category of relatives is a kind of\nhalfway house between the linguistic side of relations, namely\nrelational predicates, and the ontological side, namely relations\nthemselves.\n\nFor our purposes, we need not determine how to best interpret\nAristotle\u2019s theory of relatives, but can rather consider some\nissues that Aristotle\u2019s discussion raises. First, anyone who is\ncomfortable with relational properties will no doubt find\nAristotle\u2019s discussion somewhat confused. Although Aristotle\ndoes discuss important features of relational predicates, for\ninstance, that relational predicates involve a kind of reciprocal\nreference (6b28), his fundamental stance, according to which all\nproperties in the world are non-relational, will appear wrongheaded.\nSecond, Aristotle\u2019s category of relatives raises interpretive\nissues, in particular the issue concerning what exactly his\ncategorical scheme is meant to classify. As in the case of quantity,\nAristotle seems to be focusing on things that are related rather than\nrelations themselves. Indeed, this is evident from the name of the\ncategory.\n\nThis latter fact, namely that in his discussion of relatives Aristotle\nseems focused on related things rather than relations, places pressure\non the easy characterization of the categories that I discussed\npreviously, namely that each category is a distinct type of\nextra-linguistic entity. If that easy characterization were correct,\nAristotle should have countenanced some type of entity corresponding\nto relatives as a highest kind. But he did not. Hence, it is tempting\nto shift to an interpretation according to which Aristotle is after\nall focused on linguistically characterized items. And perhaps he\nthinks that the world contains just a few basic types of entity and\nthat different types of predicates apply to the world in virtue of\ncomplex semantic relations to just those types of entity. As it turns\nout, many commentators have interpreted him in this way. But their\ninterpretations face their own difficulties. To raise just one, we can\nask: what are the basic entities in the world if not just those that\nfall under the various categories? Perhaps there is a way to answer\nthis question on Aristotle\u2019s behalf, but the answer is not\nclearly contained in his texts. So again we are once again forced to\nadmit just how difficult it is to pin down a precise interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s work.\n2.2.4 Quality\n\nAfter relatives, Aristotle discusses the category of quality. Unlike\nquantity and relatives, quality does not present any obvious\ndifficulties for the interpretation according to which the\nCategories classify basic types of entity. Aristotle divides\nquality as follows (8b26\u201310a11):\n\nQuality\n\n\nHabits and Dispositions\nNatural Capabilities and Incapabilities\nAffective Qualities and Affections\nShape\n \n\n\nEach of these species looks like an extra-linguistic type of entity,\nand none of the species appears to be a species in another category.\nHence, any difficulties with Aristotle\u2019s treatment of quality\nconcern the appropriateness of the divisions he makes rather than the\nextent to which the category fits into a larger interpretation of the\ncategorial scheme. But, as with just about everything in\nAristotle\u2019s scheme, the divisions he makes among qualities have\nbeen severely criticized. J.L. Ackrill, for instance, criticizes\nAristotle as follows:\n\nHe [Aristotle] gives no special argument to show that [habits and\ndispositions] are qualities. Nor does he give any criterion for\ndeciding that a given quality is or is not a [habit-or-disposition];\nwhy, for example, should affective qualities be treated as a class\nquite distinct from [habits and dispositions]? (Ackrill 1963)\n\n\nAckrill finds Aristotle\u2019s division of quality at best\nunmotivated. And Ackrill, it would seem, is being polite. Montgomery\nFurth has said: \u2018I shall largely dispense with questions\nlike\u2026the rationale (if there be one) for comprehending into a\nsingle category the monstrous motley horde yclept\nQuality\u2026\u2019 (Furth 1988).\n\nIt must be admitted, that Aristotle\u2019s list of the species in\nquality is at first blush a bit odd. For instance, why should we\nconsider any of the species listed as falling directly under quality?\nIndeed, when Aristotle lists the species, he does not follow his usual\nprocedure and provide the differentiae that distinguish them. If there\nare such differentiae, we should expect that habits and dispositions,\nfor instance, can be defined as such and such a quality. The same\nwould of course be true for the other qualities. But not only does\nAristotle not provide these differentiae, but it is also difficult to\nsee what they might be. To appreciate the difficulty, one need only\nask: what differentia can be added to quality so as to define\nshape?\n\nTo be fair, Aristotle\u2019s category of quality has had its\ndefenders. In fact, some of those defenders have gone so far as to\nprovide something of a deduction of the species in the category from\nvarious metaphysical principles. Aquinas, for instance, says the\nfollowing about the category in his Summa Theologiae:\n\n\nNow the mode of determination of the subject to accidental being may\nbe taken in regard to the very nature of the subject, or in regard to\naction, and passion resulting from its natural principles, which are\nmatter and form; or again in regard to quantity. If we take the mode\nor determination of the subject in regard to quantity, we shall then\nhave the fourth species of quality. And because quantity, considered\nin itself, is devoid of movement, and does not imply the notion of\ngood or evil, so it does not concern the fourth species of quality\nwhether a thing be well or ill disposed, nor quickly or slowly\ntransitory.\n\nBut the mode of determination of the subject, in regard to action or\npassion, is considered in the second and third species of quality. And\ntherefore in both, we take into account whether a thing be done with\nease or difficulty; whether it be transitory or lasting. But in them,\nwe do not consider anything pertaining to the notion of good or evil:\nbecause movements and passions have not the aspect of an end, whereas\ngood and evil are said in respect of an end.\n\nOn the other hand, the mode or determination of the subject, in regard\nto the nature of the thing, belongs to the first species of quality,\nwhich is habit and disposition: for the Philosopher says\n(Phys. vii, text. 17), when speaking of habits of the soul\nand of the body, that they are \u201cdispositions of the perfect to\nthe best; and by perfect I mean that which is disposed in accordance\nwith its nature.\u201d And since the form itself and the nature of a\nthing is the end and the cause why a thing is made (Phys. ii,\ntext. 25), therefore in the first species we consider both evil and\ngood, and also changeableness, whether easy or difficult; inasmuch as\na certain nature is the end of generation and movement. (Aquinas,\nSumma Theologica, Part I-II, Q. 49, Art. 2)\n\n\nAquinas seems to see the species in the category of quality as\nunfolding systematically from some basic metaphysical principles.\nWhether Aquinas\u2019s derivation of the species in the category of\nquality is plausible or whether some other derivation that stems from\nAristotelian principles can be given has become the subject of recent\nscholarship (Kahm 2016, Studtmann 2003a). Although the issue may seem\na local one pertaining only to Aristotle\u2019s category of quality,\nit is in fact relevant to the larger issue, which I will discuss\nshortly, of Aristotle\u2019s method of deriving the categories\ngenerally. A systematic derivation of Aristotle\u2019s category of\nquality would give credence to the claim that Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorial scheme as a whole admits of some kind of systematic\nderivation.\n\nIt may seem odd to quote Aquinas at such length in an essay devoted to\nAristotle\u2019s categories, but I have done so for two reasons.\nFirst, as Ackrill\u2019s and Furth\u2019s comments illustrate,\nAristotle\u2019s scheme has been severely criticized by scholars and\nphilosophers alike. Aquinas\u2019s comments about quality, however,\nshow that in the hands of a truly talented interpreter \u2014 and\nthere certainly has been no interpreter of Aristotle greater than\nAquinas \u2014 many of the criticisms can be met. Second, and more\nimportantly, the attention that Aquinas gives to the category of\nquality is indicative of one of the most important facts about\nAristotle\u2019s categories, namely its profound historical\nimportance in the development of metaphysical speculation. Whether\nphilosophers have agreed or disagreed with Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorial scheme, his categorialism has played a significant\ninstrumental role \u2014 it has provided in the millennia since its\nappearance the starting point for a great deal of metaphysical\ninquiry. In this respect, it can be compared to the quantifier in\nTwentieth-century metaphysics. Whether or not the quantifier is of\nphilosophical interest, it is hard to imagine twentieth-century\nanalytical metaphysics without it. So, to the extent that interest in\nthe history of philosophy lies in the way in which ideas have had an\ninfluence from generation to generation, Aristotle\u2019s categorial\nscheme is worth studying not only for the doctrines it contains but\nalso for the interest that other philosophers have taken in it and the\nphilosophy that they produced by using it as a springboard. (See the\nentry on\n Commentators on Aristotle.)\n\nIt is a tradition that scholars are increasingly attending to. Much of\nthe recent scholarship concerning Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories has either been translations of commentaries or\ndiscussions that stem from them.\n\nAfter quality, Aristotle\u2019s discussion of individual categories\nbecomes very sparse. He devotes a few comments to the categories of\naction and passion (11b1) and then has a brief discussion of one of\nthe odder categories, having, at the end of the work\n(15b17\u201335).\n\nThe bulk of the remaining discussion, which is known as the\nPost-Predicamenta, is directed at concepts involving some\nkind of opposition, the concepts of priority, posteriorty,\nsimultaneity, and change. Although the latter part of the\nCategories is interesting, it is not clear that it is\nintegral to either of Aristotle\u2019s classificatory schemes.\nMoreover, his discussion there is largely superseded by his discussion\nof the same concepts in the Metaphysics. Hence, instead of\ndiscussing the Post-Predicamenta in detail, I shall at this\npoint turn to a topic about Aristotle\u2019s categories that is of\nfundamental philosophical and interpretive interest: how did Aristotle\narrive at his list of categories?\n3. Whence the Categories?\n\nThe issue concerning the origin of the categories can be raised by\nasking the most difficult question there is about any philosophical\nposition: why think that it is correct? Why, in other words, should we\nthink that Aristotle\u2019s list of highest kinds contains all and\nonly the highest kinds there are?\n\nOne might, of course, reject the idea that there are some\nmetaphysically privileged kinds in the world. But here it is important\nto distinguish between internal and external questions concerning a\nsystem of categories. We can approach category theory externally in\nwhich case we would ask questions about the status of any system of\ncategories. So, for instance, we could ask whether any system of\ncategories must exhibit some kind of dependency on the mind, language,\nconceptual schemes, or whatever. Realists will answer this question in\nthe negative, and idealists of one stripe or another in the\naffirmative. In addition, we can ask about our epistemic access to the\nultimate categories in the world. And we can adopt positions ranging\nfrom a radical skepticism about our access to categories to a kind of\ninfallibilism about such access.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we approach category theory from an internal\nperspective, we will assume some answer to the external questions and\nthen go on to ask about the correctness of the system of categories\nunder those assumptions. So, for instance, we might adopt a realist\nperspective and hence assume that there is some correct metaphysically\nprivileged list of mind and language independent highest kinds as well\nas a correct account of the relations between them. And we can then\ntry to determine what that list is. Now, Aristotle certainly belongs\nto this latter tradition of speculation about categories: he assumes\nrather than defends a posture of realism with respect to the\nmetaphysical structures in the world. It is thus appropriate to assume\nrealism along with him and then inquire into the question of which\ncategories there might be.\n\nOne way of approaching this question is to ask whether there is some\nprincipled procedure by which Aristotle generated his list of\ncategories. For, if there is, then one could presumably assess his\nlist of highest kinds by assessing the procedure by which he generated\nit. Unfortunately, with the exception of some suggestive remarks in\nthe Topics, Aristotle does not indicate how he generated his\nscheme. Without some procedure by which one can generate his list,\nhowever, Aristotle\u2019s categories arguably lack any justification.\nThe issue is, of course, complicated by the fact that his list might\nbe justified without some procedure to generate it \u2014 perhaps we\ncan use a combination of metaphysical intuition and philosophical\nargumentation to convince ourselves that Aristotle\u2019s list is\ncomplete. Nonetheless, without some procedure of generation\nAristotle\u2019s categories at least appear in an uneasy light. And\nas a matter of historical fact, the lack of any justification for his\nlist of highest kinds has been the source of some famous criticisms.\nKant, for instance, just prior to the articulation of his own\ncategorial scheme, says:\n\nIt was an enterprise worthy of an acute thinker like Aristotle to make\nsearch for these fundamental concepts. But as he did so on no\nprinciple, he merely picked them up as they came his way, and at first\nprocured ten of them, which he called categories\n(predicaments). (Kant, Critique of Pure Reason,\nTranscendental Doctrine of Elements, Second Part, First Division, Book\nI, Chapter 1, Section 3, 10)\n\n\nAccording to Kant, Aristotle\u2019s list of categories was the result\nof an unsystematic, albeit a brilliant, bit of philosophical\nbrainstorming. Hence, it cannot stand firm as a correct set of\ncategories.\n\nAs it turns out, although Kant did not know of any procedure by which\nAristotle might have generated his list of categories, scholars have\ngiven a number of proposals. The proposals can be classified into four\ntypes, which I shall call: (1) The Question Approach; (2)\nThe Grammatical Approach; (3) The Modal Approach;\n(4) The Medieval Derivational Approach.\n\nJ.L. Ackrill (1963) is the most prominent defender of the Question\nApproach. He takes as evidence for his interpretation\nAristotle\u2019s remarks in Topics I 9. Ackrill claims that\nthere are two different ways to generate the categories, each of which\ninvolves asking questions. According to the first method, we are to\nask a single question \u2014 what is it? \u2014 of as many things as\nwe can. So, for instance, we can ask of Socrates, what is Socrates?\nAnd we can answer \u2014 Socrates is a human. We can then direct the\nsame question to the answer we have given: what is a human? And we can\nanswer: a human is an animal. Eventually, this process of question\nasking will lead us to some highest kind, in this case, Substance. If,\non the other hand, we had begun asking that same question of\nSocrates\u2019 color, say his whiteness, we would eventually have\nended at the highest kind quality. When carried out completely,\nAckrill claims, this procedure will yield the ten distinct and\nirreducible kinds that are Aristotle\u2019s categories. According to\nthe second method of questioning, we are to ask as many different\nquestions as we can about a single primary substance. So, for\ninstance, we might ask \u2014 how tall is Socrates? Where is\nSocrates? What is Socrates? And in answering these questions, we will\nrespond five feet, in the Agora, Human. We will then realize that our\nanswers to our various questions group into ten irreducible kinds.\n\nOf all the proposals that scholars have given, Ackrill\u2019s is the\nmost supported by Aristotle\u2019s texts, though the evidence he\ncites is far from conclusive. But from a philosophical point of view,\nthe question method suffers from some serious problems. First, it is\nfar from clear that either method actually produces Aristotle\u2019s\nlist. Suppose, for instance, I employ the second method and ask: does\nSocrates like Plato? The answer, let us grant, is \u2018yes\u2019.\nBut where does that answer belong in the categorical scheme? Ackrill\nmight respond by forcing the question to be one that is not answered\nwith \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. But we can still ask the\nquestion: is Socrates present-in or not present-in something else? The\nanswer, of course, is: not present-in; but where in Aristotle\u2019s\nlist of categories does not present-in belong? It is indeed hard to\nsee. Similar problems face the first method. Suppose I were to ask:\nwhat is Socrates\u2019 whiteness? I might respond by saying \u2018a\nparticular\u2019. Again, where does being a particular belong in\nAristotle\u2019s list of categories. Of course, particulars are part\nof the four-fold system of classification that Aristotle articulates.\nBut we are not at the moment concerned with that scheme. Indeed, to\nadvert to that scheme in the present context is simply to re-open the\nquestion of the relations between the two main systems of\nclassification in the Categories.\n\nEven if Ackrill can find some plausible route from questions to\nAristotle\u2019s categories, the methods he proposes still seem\nunsatisfactory for the simple reason that they depend far too much on\nour question-asking inclinations. It may be that the questions that we\nin fact ask will yield Aristotle\u2019s categories, but what we\nshould want to know is whether we are asking the right questions.\nUnless we can be confident that our questions are tracking the\nmetaphysical structures of the world, we should be unimpressed by the\nfact that they yield any set of categories. But to know whether our\nquestions are tracking the metaphysical structures of the world\nrequires us to have some way of establishing the correctness of the\ncategorial scheme. Clearly, at this point, we are in a circle that is\ntoo small to be of much help. Maybe all metaphysical theorizing is at\nsome level laden with circularity, but circles this small are\ngenerally unacceptable to a metaphysician.\n\nAccording to the grammatical approach, which traces to Trendelenburg\n(1846) and has most recently been defended by Michael Baumer (1993),\nAristotle generated his list by paying attention to the structures\ninherent in language. On the assumption that the metaphysical\nstructure of the world mirrors the structures in language, we should\nbe able to find the basic metaphysical structures by examining our\nlanguage. This approach is quite involved but for our purposes can be\nillustrated with a few examples. The distinction between substance and\nthe rest of the categories, for instance, is built into the\nsubject-predicate structure of our language. Consider, for instance,\nthe two sentences: (1) Socrates is a human; and (2) Socrates is white.\nFirst, we see that each sentence has a subject, namely\n\u2018Socrates\u2019. Corresponding to that subject, one might\nthink, is an entity of some kind, namely a primary substance.\nMoreover, the first sentence contains what might be called an\nindividuating predicate \u2014 it is a predicate of the form,\na such and such, rather than of the form, such and such. So,\none might think, there are predicates that attribute to primary\nsubstances properties the having of which suffices for that substance\nto be an individual of some kind. On the other hand, the second\nsentence contains a non-individuating predicate. So by examining the\ndetails of the predicates in our language, we have some grounds for\ndistinguishing between the category of substance and the accidental\ncategories.\n\nThe grammatical approach certainly does have some virtues. First, we\nhave ample evidence that Aristotle was sensitive to language and the\nstructures inherent in it. So it would not be all that surprising were\nhe led by his sensitivity to linguistic structures to his list of\ncategories. Moreover, some of the peculiarities of his list are nicely\nexplained in this way. Two of the highest kinds are action and\npassion. In Physics III 3, however, Aristotle argues that in\nthe world there is only motion and that the distinction between action\nand passion lies in the way in which one is considering the motion. So\nwhy should there be two distinct categories, namely action, and\npassion, rather than just one, namely motion? Well, the grammatical\napproach offers an explanation: in language, we differentiate between\nactive and passive verbs. Hence, there are two distinct categories,\nnot just one.\n\nDespite these virtues, the grammatical approach faces a difficult\nquestion: why think that the structures we find in language reflect\nthe metaphysical structures of the world? For instance, it may simply\nbe a historical accident that our language contains individuating and\nnon-individuating predicates. Likewise, it may be a historical\naccident that there are active and passive verbs in our language. Of\ncourse, this type of objection, when pushed to its limits, leads to\none of the more difficult philosophical questions, namely how can we\nbe sure that the structures of our representations are in any way\nrelated to what some might call the basic metaphysical structures and\nto what others might call the things in themselves? But one might hold\nout hope that some justification for a categorial scheme could be\ngiven that did not rest entirely on the unjustified assertion of some\ndeep correspondence between linguistic and metaphysical\nstructures.\n\nThe Modal Approach, which traces to Bonitz (1853) and has most\nrecently been defended by Julius Moravscik (1967), avoids the defects\nof both the previous two approaches. As Moravscik formulates this\nview, the categories are those types of entities to which any sensible\nparticular must be related. He says:\n\nAccording to this interpretation the constitutive principle of the\nlist of categories is that they constitute those classes of items to\neach of which any sensible particular \u2014 substantial or otherwise\n\u2014 must be related. Any sensible particular, substance, event,\nsound, etc. must be related to some substance; it must have some\nquality and quantity; it must have relational properties, it must be\nrelated to times and places; and it is placed within a network of\ncausal chains and laws, thus being related to the categories of\naffecting and being affected.\n\n\nIn virtue of its explicitly modal nature, the Modal Approach avoids\nthe defects of the previous two approaches. Whereas the first two\napproaches ultimately rely on some connection between metaphysical\nstructures and what appear to be merely contingent features of either\nour question asking proclivities or the structures inherent in our\nlanguage, the Modal Approach eliminates contingency altogether.\n\nDespite its explicitly modal character, the Modal Approach does face a\ndifficulty similar to the one faced by the Question Approach. It might\nturn out that employing the approach yields exactly the list of\nAristotle\u2019s categories, but then again it might not. So, for\ninstance, every material particular must be related to a particular.\nBut there is no category of particulars. There are, of course, beings\nthat are not said-of other beings. But not being said-of is not one of\nAristotle\u2019s categories. Moreover, must not every material\nparticular be related to matter? But matter is not a highest kind.\nIndeed, it is far from clear where matter belongs in the categories.\nSo, even if the Modal Approach is a good one for generating some list\nof kinds, it is not obvious that it is a good approach for generating\nAristotle\u2019s list of kinds. This problem could of course be\nalleviated somewhat if instead of merely appealing to modal structures\nas such, one could appeal to modal structures that arguably Aristotle\nwould have thought are part of the very fabric of the world. Then one\nwould at least have an explanation as to why Aristotle derived the\nlist he in fact derived, even if one is inclined to reject\nAristotle\u2019s list.\n\nThe last approach to the categories, namely the Medieval derivational\napproach, goes some way in the direction suggested but not taken by\nMoravscik\u2019s Modal Approach. There is a rich tradition of\ncommentators including Radulphus Brito, Albert the Great, Thomas\nAquinas, and most recently their modern heir Franz Brentano, who\nprovide precisely the kind of derivation for Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorial scheme found wanting by Kant. According to the commentators\nin this tradition, Aristotle\u2019s highest kinds are capable of a\nsystematic and arguably entirely a priori derivation. The\nfollowing quotation from Brentano captures nicely the philosophical\nimport of such derivations.\n\nOn the contrary, it seems to me that there is no doubt that Aristotle\ncould have arrived at a certain a priori proof, a deductive\nargument for the completeness of the distinction of categories\n\u2026 (On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle, Ch.5,\nsection 12)\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s enthusiasm about the possibility of deriving\nAristotle\u2019s categories is perhaps unjustified, but the idea that\nan a priori proof of the completeness of Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories is certainly an intriguing one.\n\nPerhaps the best representative of this type of interpretation occurs\nin Aquinas\u2019s commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. All of Aquinas\u2019s derivation deserves\nconsiderable attention, but for our purposes, it will suffice to quote\njust a portion of it so as to bring out its general character as well\nas one of its more interesting aspects.\n\nA predicate is referred to a subject in a second way when the\npredicate is taken as being in the subject, and this predicate is in\nthe subject either essentially and absolutely and as something flowing\nfrom its matter, and then it is quantity; or as something flowing from\nits form, and then it is quality; or it is not present in the subject\nabsolutely but with reference to something else, and then it is\nrelation. (Commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\nBook V, Lesson 9, Section 890)\n\n\nThis passage illustrates the tenor of the Medieval derivational\napproach. Aquinas articulates what appear to be principled\nmetaphysical principles concerning the way in which a predicate can\nbe, in his words, \u2018taken as being in a subject\u2019. There are\ntwo such ways: (1) essentially and absolutely; or (2) essentially and\nnot absolutely but with reference to something else. The latter way\ncorresponds to the category of relatives; the former, to the\ncategories of quality and quantity. Aquinas then divides the former\nway of being in a subject in terms of form and matter. He claims,\nstrikingly, that the category of quality flows from form and\nthat the category of quantity flows from matter.\n\nInspecting all of Aquinas\u2019s derivation to determine its cogency\nis far too large a project to undertake here. I have quoted the\nportion above to show the way in which the Medieval derivational\napproach augments in an interesting way Moravscik\u2019s Modal\nApproach. The Modal Approach, I argued, would gain some plausibility\nif there were some way of seeing Aristotle\u2019s own attitudes about\nthe modal structures in the material world somehow determining the\ngeneration of the categories. By invoking a combination of a\npriori sounding semantic principles and theses about the\nrelationship between form and quality and matter and quantity, Aquinas\nhas gone some way toward doing this. Aristotle is certainly committed\nto the claim that form and matter are two of the absolutely\nfundamental aspects of the material world. Indeed, he argues in the\nPhysics that form and matter are necessary for the existence\nof motion, which, he thinks, essentially characterizes bodies.\n\nIf the Medieval Derivational Approach is correct, Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories ultimately trace to the ways in which form, matter, and\nperhaps motion relate to substances and the predicates that apply to\nthem. Whether the derivations can withstand philosophical scrutiny is\nof course an important question, one that I will not pursue here,\nthough I will say that Brentano was probably a bit too enthusiastic\nabout the prospects for an entirely satisfactory a priori\nproof of the completeness of Aristotle\u2019s categories. Moreover,\nthe Medieval interpretations face the charge that they are an\nover-interpretation of Aristotle. Aristotle simply does not provide in\nhis surviving writings the sort of conceptual connections that\nunderlie the Medieval derivations. So perhaps the Medievals have\nsuccumbed to the temptation to read into Aristotle\u2019s system\nconnections that Aristotle did not accept. Indeed, from a\ntwentieth-century perspective, the Medieval derivations look very\nstrange. It is commonplace in contemporary Aristotle scholarship to\nview the Categories as an early work and to think that\nAristotle had not developed his theory of form and matter until later\nin his career. If this general approach is correct, the claim that the\ncategorial scheme can somehow be derived at least in part from form\nand matter appears implausible.\n\nAs should be clear from this brief discussion, providing a complete\nderivation of Aristotle\u2019s categorical scheme would be a\ndifficult, indeed perhaps impossible, task. After all, someone might\nconclude that Aristotle\u2019s categorial scheme was either in part\nor in whole mistaken. Minimally, the task is a daunting one. But of\ncourse, the difficulty in establishing its ultimate correctness is not\npeculiar to Aristotle\u2019s categorial scheme. Indeed, it should not\nbe at all surprising that the difficulties that have beset\nmetaphysical speculation in the Western tradition can be seen in such\na stark and provocative fashion in one of the great founding works of\nthat very tradition. In fact, it is in part due to such difficulties\nthat external questions about categorial and other metaphysical\nstructures arise. Such difficulties understandably lead to questions\nabout the legitimacy of category theory and metaphysical speculation\nin general. Unfortunately, the history of metaphysical speculation has\nshown that it is no less difficult to establish answers to external\nthan to internal questions about category theory. That acknowledged it\nis noteworthy that questions of both sorts owe their first\nformulations, ultimately, to the categorialism of Aristotle\u2019s\nseminal work, the Categories.\n4. Recent Work\n\nTwo trends in recent philosophical scholarship are of special note.\nThese engage Aristotle\u2019s categorialism in different ways. The\nfirst considers it directly, as a topic of investigation in its own\nright; see Shields (ed.) 2012. The second treats it more indirectly,\neither by considering issues in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy on which\nhis categorialism bears or, more generally, by advancing the tradition\nhis categorialism inaugurated; see Haaparanta and Koskinen (eds.)\n2012.\n\nIn Shields (ed.) 2012, we find an argument that Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorialism and his hylomorphism can be systematically unified\n(Studtmann 2012). The role of the famous phrase\u2014Being Qua\nBeing\u2014in Aristotle\u2019s thought is thoroughly examined, first\nby way of the many criticisms of Aristotle\u2019s views and second by\nway of interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s famous slogan that can\nwithstand philosophical scrutiny (Shields 2012). The ontology of the\nCategories is examined with a critical lens sharpened by a number of\ncontemporary debates (Loux 2012a).\n\nHaaparanta and Koskinen (eds.) 2012 begins with Michael Loux\u2019s\n(2012b) examination of a thesis that structures Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorialism, namely that being is said in many ways (pollach\u00f4s\nlegomenon). Many commentators have thought such a thesis to be deeply\nproblematic. Loux agrees in part with such a sentiment, arguing that\nthe thesis makes univocal but transcategorial reference impossible,\nthereby rendering a statement of the thesis that being is said in many\nways impossible as well. Loux, however, finds a way to salvage the\nAristotelian thesis by denying the claim that it is about the meaning\nor sense of universal terms. The volume continues with discussions\nthat become increasingly remote in time but which therefore show the\nlasting influence of his categorialism. Kukkonen (2012), Knuttilla\n(2012), and Normore (2012) discuss in separate essays the influence\nAristotle\u2019s categories on aspects of Medieval philosophy. And by\nthe latter part of the volume, the essays begin to focus on other\nphilosophers, e.g., Hegel, Pierce, Bolzano, and Meinong, each of whom\navowedly manifests a clear and deep debt to Aristotle and his\ncategorialism.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackrill, J.
