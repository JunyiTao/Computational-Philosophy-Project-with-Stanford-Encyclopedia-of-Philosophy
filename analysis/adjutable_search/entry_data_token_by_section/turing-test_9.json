    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections || Argument from Informality of Behavior\n2.8 Argument from Informality of Behavior\n\nThis argument relies on the assumption that there is no set of rules\nthat describes what a person ought to do in every possible set of\ncircumstances, and on the further assumption that there is a set of\nrules that describes what a machine will do in every possible set of\ncircumstances. From these two assumptions, it is supposed to\nfollow\u2014somehow!\u2014that people are not machines. As Turing\nnotes, there is some slippage between \u201cought\u201d and\n\u201cwill\u201d in this formulation of the argument. However, once\nwe make the appropriate adjustments, it is not clear that an obvious\ndifference between people and digital computers emerges.\n\nSuppose, first, that we focus on the question of whether there are\nsets of rules that describe what a person and a machine\n\u201cwill\u201d do in every possible set of circumstances. If the\nworld is deterministic, then there are such rules for both persons and\nmachines (though perhaps it is not possible to write down the rules).\nIf the world is not deterministic, then there are no such rules for\neither persons or machines (since both persons and machines can be\nsubject to non-deterministic processes in the production of their\nbehavior). Either way, it is hard to see any reason for supposing that\nthere is a relevant difference between people and machines that bears\non the description of what they will do in all possible sets of\ncircumstances. (Perhaps it might be said that what the objection\ninvites us to suppose is that, even though the world is not\ndeterministic, humans differ from digital machines precisely because\nthe operations of the latter are indeed deterministic. But, if the\nworld is non-deterministic, then there is no reason why digital\nmachines cannot be programmed to behave non-deterministically, by\nallowing them to access input from non-deterministic features of the\nworld.)\n\nSuppose, instead, that we focus on the question of whether there are\nsets of rules that describe what a person and a machine\n\u201cought\u201d to do in every possible set of circumstances.\nWhether or not we suppose that norms can be codified\u2014and quite\napart from the question of which kinds of norms are in\nquestion\u2014it is hard to see what grounds there could be for this\njudgment, other than the question-begging claim that machines are not\nthe kinds of things whose behavior could be subject to norms. (And, in\nthat case, the initial argument is badly mis-stated: the claim ought\nto be that, whereas there are sets of rules that describe what a\nperson ought to do in every possible set of circumstances, there are\nno sets of rules that describe what machines ought to do in\nall possible sets of circumstances!)\n",
