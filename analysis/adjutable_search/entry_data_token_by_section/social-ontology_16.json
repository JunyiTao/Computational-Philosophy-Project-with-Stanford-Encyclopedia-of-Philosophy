    "main_text": "How Social Categories and Kinds Are Set Up || Pluralistic and Heterogeneous Theories\n4.5 Pluralistic and Heterogeneous Theories\n\nAs seen in the \u201cpattern theories\u201d discussed in\n section 4.3,\n approaches to biological and other scientific kinds are sometimes\nextended to social categories. Some participants in these debates,\nincluding Dupr\u00e9 (1995) and Hacking (2007), argue for a sweeping\npluralism about scientific kinds: they contend that there are myriad\nkinds of kinds, and that it is an error to regard some kinds as more\n\u201cnatural\u201d than others. Others argue for a more modest form\nof pluralism. Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015) argue that there are\nseveral distinct kinds of scientific kinds, including non-causal\nkinds, functional kinds, and heterostatic kinds. Along similar lines,\nmany theorists of race argue for pluralism with respect to racial\nkinds: though contemporary race theorists deny \u201cbiological\nessentialism\u201d, they argue that there are many ways racial kinds\nare constructed and used in contemporary societies (see\n section 5.4).\n\nEpstein (2008, 2014a) argues\nfor modest pluralism about the ways social categories are set up. He\nintroduces the term \u2018anchoring\u2019 to denote the setting up\nor putting in place of social categories or kinds. He proposes that\nall the theories discussed in\n section 4\n are theories of anchoring, but denies that social categories are all\nanchored in the same way. Instead, there are various \u201canchoring\nschemas\u201d. He cautions that we sometimes classify kinds according to\nhow they are anchored, but not in all cases.\n\nIn addition to pluralism about anchoring schemas, he also argues that\nanchors are heterogeneous (Epstein 2015): even for a single anchoring schema, the anchors\nthat feed into that schema\u2014i.e., the facts that metaphysically\nset up a social category\u2014are often diverse. Legal categories in\nthe U.S., for instance, are anchored by facts such as jury\ninstructions, trial results, legislative enactments, judicial\ninterpretation, and environmental regularities. Even theories of\npractice, he argues, do not have the resources to accommodate this\nheterogeneity.\n",
