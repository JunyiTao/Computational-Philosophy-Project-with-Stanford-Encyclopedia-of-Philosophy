    "main_text": "\n\n\nEven though Kant himself held that his view of the mind and\nconsciousness were inessential to his main purpose, some of the ideas\ncentral to his point of view came to have an enormous influence on his successors. Some of his ideas are now central to cognitive science, for example. Other ideas equally\ncentral to his point of view had little influence on subsequent\nwork. In this article, first we survey Kant\u2019s model as a whole\nand the claims in it that have been influential. Then we examine his claims\nabout consciousness of self specifically. Many of his ideas that have not been influential are ideas about the consciousness of self.\nIndeed, even though he achieved remarkable insights into consciousness\nof self, many of these insights next appeared only about 200 years later, in the 1960s and\n1970s.\n",
