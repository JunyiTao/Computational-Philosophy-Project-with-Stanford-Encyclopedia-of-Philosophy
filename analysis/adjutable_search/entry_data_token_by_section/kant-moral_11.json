    "main_text": "Virtue and Vice\n12. Virtue and Vice\n\nKant defines virtue as \u201cthe moral strength of a human\nbeing\u2019s will in fulfilling his duty\u201d (MM 6:405) and\nvice as principled immorality (MM 6:390). This definition appears to\nput Kant\u2019s views on virtue at odds with classical views such as\nAristotle\u2019s in several important respects.\n\nFirst, Kant\u2019s account of virtue presupposes an account of moral\nduty already in place. Thus, rather than treating admirable character\ntraits as more basic than the notions of right and wrong conduct, Kant\ntakes virtues to be explicable only in terms of a prior account of\nmoral or dutiful behavior. He does not try to make out what shape a\ngood character has and then draw conclusions about how we ought to act\non that basis. He sets out the principles of moral conduct based on\nhis philosophical account of rational agency, and then on that basis\ndefines virtue as a kind of strength and resolve to act on those\nprinciples despite temptations to the contrary.\n\nSecond, virtue is, for Kant, strength of will, and hence does not\narise as the result of instilling a \u201csecond nature\u201d by a\nprocess of habituating or training ourselves to act and feel in\nparticular ways. It is indeed a disposition, but a disposition of\none\u2019s will, not a disposition of emotions, feelings, desires or\nany other feature of human nature that might be amenable to\nhabituation. Moreover, the disposition is to overcome obstacles to\nmoral behavior that Kant thought were ineradicable features of human\nnature. Thus, virtue appears to be much more like what Aristotle would\nhave thought of as a lesser trait, viz., continence or\nself-control.\n\nThird, in viewing virtue as a trait grounded in moral principles, and\nvice as principled transgression of moral law, Kant thought of himself\nas thoroughly rejecting what he took to be the Aristotelian view that\nvirtue is a mean between two vices. The Aristotelian view, he claimed,\nassumes that virtue typically differs from vice only in terms of\ndegree rather than in terms of the different principles each involves\n(MM 6:404, 432). Prodigality and avarice, for instance, do not differ\nby being too loose or not loose enough with one\u2019s means. They\ndiffer in that the prodigal person acts on the principle of acquiring\nmeans with the sole intention of enjoyment, while the avaricious\nperson acts on the principle of acquiring means with the sole\nintention of possessing them.\n\nFourth, in classical views the distinction between moral and non-moral\nvirtues is not particularly significant. A virtue is some sort of\nexcellence of the soul, but one finds classical theorists treating wit\nand friendliness alongside courage and justice. Since Kant holds moral\nvirtue to be a trait grounded in moral principle, the boundary between\nnon-moral and moral virtues could not be more sharp. Even so, Kant\nshows a remarkable interest in non-moral virtues; indeed, much of\nAnthropology is given over to discussing the nature and\nsources of a variety of character traits, both moral and\nnon-moral.\n\nFifth, virtue cannot be a trait of divine beings, if there are such,\nsince it is the power to overcome obstacles that would not be present\nin them. This is not to say that to be virtuous is to be the victor in\na constant and permanent war with ineradicable evil impulses or\ntemptations. Morality is \u201cduty\u201d for human beings because\nit is possible (and we recognize that it is possible) for our\ndesires and interests to run counter to its demands. Should all of our\ndesires and interests be trained ever so carefully to comport with\nwhat morality actually requires of us, this would not change in the\nleast the fact that morality is still duty for us. For should this\ncome to pass, it would not change the fact that each and every desire\nand interest could have run contrary to the moral law. And it\nis the fact that they can conflict with moral law, not the\nfact that they actually do conflict with it, that makes duty\na constraint, and hence is virtue essentially a trait concerned with\nconstraint.\n\nSixth, virtue, while important, does not hold pride of place in\nKant\u2019s system in other respects. For instance, he holds that the\nlack of virtue is compatible with possessing a good will (G 6: 408).\nThat one acts from duty, even repeatedly and reliably can thus be\nquite compatible with an absence of the moral strength to overcome\ncontrary interests and desires. Indeed, it may often be no challenge\nat all to do one\u2019s duty from duty alone. Someone with a good\nwill, who is genuinely committed to duty for its own sake, might\nsimply fail to encounter any significant temptation that would reveal\nthe lack of strength to follow through with that commitment. That\nsaid, he also appeared to hold that if an act is to be of genuine\nmoral worth, it must be motivated by the kind of purity of motivation\nachievable only through a permanent, quasi-religious conversion or\n\u201crevolution\u201d in the orientation of the will of the sort\ndescribed in Religion. Until one achieves a permanent change\nin the will\u2019s orientation in this respect, a revolution in which\nmoral righteousness is the nonnegotiable condition of any of\none\u2019s pursuits, all of one\u2019s actions that are in\naccordance with duty are nevertheless morally worthless, no matter\nwhat else may be said of them. However, even this revolution in the\nwill must be followed up with a gradual, lifelong strengthening of\none\u2019s will to put this revolution into practice. This suggests\nthat Kant\u2019s considered view is that a good will is a will in\nwhich this revolution of priorities has been achieved, while a\nvirtuous will is one with the strength to overcome obstacles to its\nmanifestation in practice.\n\nKant distinguishes between virtue, which is strength of will to do\none\u2019s duty from duty, and particular virtues, which are\ncommitments to particular moral ends that we are morally required to\nadopt. Among the virtues Kant discusses are those of self-respect,\nhonesty, thrift, self-improvement, beneficence, gratitude,\nsociability, and forgiveness. Kant also distinguishes vice, which is a\nsteadfast commitment to immorality, from particular vices, which\ninvolve refusing to adopt specific moral ends or committing to act\nagainst those ends. For example, malice, lust, gluttony, greed,\nlaziness, vengefulness, envy, servility, contempt and arrogance are\nall vices in Kant\u2019s normative ethical theory.\n\n(Interest in Kant\u2019s conception of virtue has rapidly grown in\nrecent years.
