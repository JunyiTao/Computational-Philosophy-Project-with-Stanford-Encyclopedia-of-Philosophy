    "main_text": "Arguments for Disjunctivism || An Epistemological Argument\n3.2 An Epistemological Argument\n\n\nMcDowell\u2019s disjunctive conception of perceptual experience is\nprimarily motivated by epistemological concerns. He appeals to a\ndisjunctive conception of perceptual experience in offering a proposal\nas to how we should resist a \u201ctempting\u201d line of argument\nthat has an epistemological conclusion. The conclusion of the tempting\nargument is that when one genuinely perceives the world, the epistemic\ngrounds one has for one\u2019s world-directed judgements can be no\nbetter than those available to one when one hallucinates. (See McDowell\n1982, 1987, 1994, 2008, 2010, and 2013. See Putnam 1999 for an endorsement of\nMcDowell\u2019s approach.)\n\n\nThe tempting line of argument that McDowell is concerned to resist\nstarts by proposing that since hallucinations can be subjectively\nindistinguishible from genuine perceptions, the differences between\nyour genuine perceptions and your hallucinations must be external to\nhow things are with you subjectively. An epistemic claim is then made:\nMatters external to how things are with you subjectively cannot\nintelligibly contribute, even in part, to your epistemic standing on\nsome question. For such matters will be beyond your ken, and matters\nbeyond your ken cannot make any difference to your epistemic standing.\nThe conclusion that is then drawn is that when you genuinely perceive\nthe world your epistemic grounds for making world-directed perceptual\njudgements are the same as, an hence no better than, those available to\nyou when you have a subjectively indistinguishible hallucination.\n\n\nIn responding to this line of argument, McDowell appeals to a\ndisjunctive conception of perceptual experience in order to block the\nmove from the claim that (i) hallucinations can be subjectively\nindistinguishible from genuine perceptions, to the claim that (ii) the\ndifferences between a genuine perception and a hallucination must be\n\u201cblankly external to one\u2019s subjectivity\u201d (McDowell\n1982). This is then supposed to provide us with a way of resisting the\nargument\u2019s conclusion\u2014i.e., the claim that the experiences\ninvolved in genuine perception and hallucination do not differ in their\nepistemic significance. According to the disjunctive conception of\nexperience that McDowell proposes, we can accept that what is common to\na genuine perception and a subjectively indistinguishible hallucination\nis the fact that the subject\u2019s experience is such that it appears\nto her that some environmental fact obtains. However, we should also\naccept that an appearance that such-and-such is the case can be\neither a mere appearance or the fact that\nsuch-and-such is the case making itself perceptually manifest to\nsomeone, and on McDowell\u2019s view, when a fact is made perceptually\nmanifest to one, the obtaining of the fact is not \u201cblankly\nexternal to one\u2019s subjectivity\u201d. So the obtaining of the\nfact can contribute to one\u2019s epistemic standing.\n\n\nA standard line of objection against McDowell\u2019s disjunctivist\nproposal is that the epistemological considerations he invokes do not\nadequately support the disjunctive account of experience that he\nrecommends. The general claim behind this line of objection is that an\nadequate account of the epistemological role of perceptual experience\nneed not involve any appeal to disjunctivism. As there are many\ndifferent accounts of the epistemological role of perceptual\nexperience, there are many different forms that this line of objection\ncan take.\n\n\nFor instance, according to one widely held view, the perceptual\njudgements one makes when one is having a perfect hallucination can be\njustified and have the same justificatory status as the perceptual\njudgements one makes when one genuinely perceives the world. According\nto this view, there is a sense, then, in which the conclusion of the\ntempting line of argument that McDowell considers is true: when you\ngenuinely perceive the world your epistemic grounds for making\nworld-directed perceptual judgements are the same as, an hence no\nbetter than, those available to you when you have a subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucination. However, those who accept this claim\nmay deny that this puts into jeopardy the common sense idea that when\nwe do succeed in perceiving the world we usually do acquire\nnon-inferential, world-directed, perceptual knowledge. For they may\nclaim the epistemic difference between a veridical perception and\nhallucination is not to be explained by appealing to some difference in\nthe justificatory status of the judgements that such experiences give\nrise to. The epistemic difference is, rather, to be explained by\nappealing to the fact that when one perceives the world some further\nconditions required for perceptual knowledge will usually be met.\n\n\nTaking this line might be one way of resisting an epistemic\nassumption made in the \u201ctempting\u201d line of argument that\nMcDowell considers, namely the assumption that matters external to how\nthings are with you subjectively cannot intelligibly contribute, even\nin part, to your epistemic standing on some question. An alternative\nway of resisting this epistemic assumption is to accept a view\naccording to which matters external to how things are with you\nsubjectively can contribute to the justificatory status of your\nbeliefs. (For an example of this approach to justification, see Goldman\n1979).\n\n\nAccording to another line of objection, one that is more sympathetic\nto McDowell\u2019s general epistemological outlook, one can resist the\ntempting line of argument in a way that closely parallels\nMcDowell\u2019s proposal, but without being committed to a disjunctive\nview of appearances. Williamson (2000) proposes a view of this kind.\nAccording to this view, when one genuinely perceives the world and sees\nthat such and such is the case, one is in a factive mental state of\nknowing that such and such is the case. This factive mental state can\nonly obtain when one is veridically perceiving the world, and it cannot\nobtain when one is hallucinating. Furthermore, this factive mental\nstate is not to be given a conjunctive analysis. It is not to be\nregarded as being in a state that can be conjunctively analysed in\nterms of having an experience that such and such is the case, plus some\nfurther, extra-mental conditions that are \u2018blankly external to\none\u2019s subjectivity\u2019. So the proponent of this view agrees\nwith McDowell that when one sees that such and such is the case one is\nin a distinctive kind of mental state that cannot be conjunctively\nanalysed. However, the proponent of this view rejects McDowell\u2019s\nclaim that one should give a disjunctive account of appearances. For\naccepting that one cannot give a conjunctive analysis of\nseeing that such and such is case is compatible with saying\nthat its appearing to one that such and such is the case is a\nmental state common to genuine perception and hallucination, where such\na state is not to be given a disjunctive characterisation. (For further\ndiscussion of this line of objection, see section 4.3)\n\n\nA further criticism that has been levelled against McDowell\u2019s\nproposal is that his disjunctive account of experience fails to bring\nwith it the epistemic benefits that he advertises it as having.\nMcDowell has suggested that in showing how the disjunctive account he\nrecommends allows us to resist the tempting line of argument that he\nconsiders, he has shown us how to \u201cremove a prop\u201d upon\nwhich a certain line of sceptical argument depends. (In particular,\nsee McDowell 2008). Against McDowell, Wright (2002, 2008) argues that\ndisjunctivism provides us with nothing to address mainstream\nperceptual scepticism. Wright claims that the traditional Cartesian\nsceptical argument does not rely on the impossibility of direct\nperceptual acquaintance with the world. It allows that you may be\nhaving a perceptual experience that involves a fact in the world\nmaking itself perceptual manifest to you. What it attempts to\nundermine is the idea that anything other than agnosticism as to\nwhether or not you are perceiving is warranted, even in this\nsituation. (See also Conee 2007, and Byrne 2014.)\n\n\nIn response to this criticism, McDowell has said that in accepting\nhis disjunctive account of experience we need not pretend to have an\nargument that can prove that we are not being deceived using premises\nwe can affirm without begging the question against the sceptic. What\nthe disjunctive account does achieve, though, is to show we can resist\nsceptical arguments that appeal to the \u201chighest common\nfactor\u201d conception of experience\u2014that conception of\nexperience according to which genuine perceptions and subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucinations do not differ in their epistemological\nsignificance. For the disjunctive account of experience blocks the\ninference from subjective indistinguishability to the highest common\nfactor conception. According to McDowell\u2019s diagnosis, the move\nfrom subjective indistinguishability to the highest common factor\nconception depends upon an illegitimate view of self-knowledge. (For a\nsimilar proposal see Williamson 2000). And McDowell argues that this\nillegitimate view of self-knowledge itself makes unintelligible a\ncharacteristic of experience that the sceptical argument does not\nusually question\u2014that our perceptual experience at least\npurports to reveal how things are in the objective world.\n\n\nSo an important element of McDowell\u2019s disjunctive approach is his\nopposition to a certain view of self-knowledge. (See especially\nMcDowell 1987.) According to the view he opposes, although your\nability to tell how things are in the world by looking is fallible,\nyour ability to tell how things are with you subjectively is\ninfallible, in the following sense: the truth about how things are\nwith you subjectively is infallibly accessible to your capacity to\nacquire knowledge on such matters.This picture of self-knowledge is\nincompatible with the disjunctive account of experience that McDowell\nrecommends. According to that disjunctive account when you have an\nexperience, you can know, independently of whether you know that you\nare hallucinating, that it appears to you that such and such is the\ncase. However, its appearing to you that a such and such is the case\ncan be either a situation in which a fact in the environment is being\nmade perceptually manifest to you, or a situation that involves a mere\nappearance, and you cannot know which disjunct obtains independently\nof knowing whether you are hallucinating. According to McDowell, when\na fact is made perceptually manifest to you, the obtaining of the fact\nis not \u201cblankly external to your subjectivity\u201d. The\nresultant view is incompatible with the claim that all of the\ntruths about how things are with you subjectively are infallibly\naccessible to you. For if all of the truths about things are with you\nsubjectively were infallibly accessible to you, your capacity to know\nwhether or not you were hallucinating would also be infallible.\n\n\nFor discussion of McDowell\u2019s disjunctivism, see Neta 2008,\nPritchard 2008, Sedivy 2008, Brogaard 2011 and Haddock 2011.
