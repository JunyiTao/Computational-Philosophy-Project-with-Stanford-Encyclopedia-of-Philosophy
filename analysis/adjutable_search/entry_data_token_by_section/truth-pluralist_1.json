Each of these other theses involves\nattributing plurality to a different aspect of the analysandum\n(explanandum, definiendum, etc.). For instance, linguistically, one may\nmaintain that there is a plurality of truth predicates (Wright 1992;\nTappolet 1997; Lynch 2000; Pedersen 2006, 2010). Semantically, one may\nmaintain that alethic terms like \u2018true\u2019 have multiple\nmeanings (Pratt 1908; Tarski 1944; K\u00f6lbel 2008, 2013; Wright 2010).\nCognitively or conceptually, one may maintain that there is a\nmultiplicity of truth concepts or regimented ways of conceptualizing\ntruth (K\u00fcnne 2003; cf. Lynch 2006). Normatively, one might think\nthat truth has a plurality of profiles (Ferrari 2016, 2018).\n\n\nThese parameters or dimensions suggest that pluralism is itself not\njust a single, monolithic theory (see also Sher 1998; Wright\n2013). Any fully developed version of pluralism about truth is likely\nto make definitive commitments about at least some of these other\nphenomena. (However, it hardly entails them; one can consistently be\nan alethic pluralist about truth, for instance, without necessarily\nhaving commitments to linguistic pluralism about truth predicates, or\nabout concepts like fact or actuality.) Nonetheless, theses about\nthese other phenomena should be distinguished from pluralism about\ntruth, as understood here.\n\n\nLikewise, pluralism about truth must be distinguished from several\nneighbouring views, such as subjectivism, contextualism, relativism, or\neven nihilism about truth. For example, one can maintain some form of\nsubjectivism about truth while remaining agnostic about how many ways\nof being true there are. Or again, one can consistently maintain that\nthere is exactly one way of being true, which is always and everywhere\ndependent on context. Nor is it inconsistent to be both a pluralist and\nan absolutist or other anti-relativist about truth. For example, one\nmight argue that each of the different ways of being true holds\nabsolutely if it holds at all (Wright 1992). Alternatively, one might\nexplicate a compatibilist view, in which there are at least two kinds\nof truth, absolute and relative truth (Joachim 1905), or deflationist\nand substantivist (K\u00f6lbel 2013). Such views would be, necessarily,\npluralistic. Occasionally, pluralists have also been lumped together\nwith various groups of so-called \u2018nihilists\u2019,\n\u2018deniers\u2019, and \u2018cynics\u2019, and even associated\nwith an \u2018anything goes\u2019 approach to truth (Williams 2002).\nHowever, any version of pluralism is prima facie inconsistent with any\nview that denies truth properties, such as nihilism and certain forms\nof nominalism.\n",
