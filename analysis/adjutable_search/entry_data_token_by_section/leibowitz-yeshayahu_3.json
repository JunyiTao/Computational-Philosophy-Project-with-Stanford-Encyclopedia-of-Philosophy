    "main_text": "God and Theology\n2. God and Theology\n\nAccording to Leibowitz, the central idea of Jewish monotheism is the\nradical transcendence of God, a view that has previously been given\nits starkest exposition by his philosophical hero, Maimonides.\nPostponing discussion of its precise logical status for Leibowitz, and\nprovisionally accepting that \u201cGod is radically\ntranscendent\u201d is a cognitive statement, a rough first\nformulation of its meaning would be that God is an existent entity\nthat is absolutely incomparable to any other form of reality that we\ncan possibly encounter.\n\nFollowing Maimonides\u2019 negative theology, Leibowitz claims that\nwe are unable to make any meaningful statements that purport to\ndescribe God. Any attempt to speak of God\u2019s properties or\ncharacteristics transcend the limits of human thought and language. In\ngood Kantian, or even positivist fashion, human categories of thought\nonly get any purchase in the human context within which they are\nformulated. They cannot be assumed to retain their meaning when\napplied beyond the boundaries of possible human experience. Of course,\nthis depends on the further assertion that God is not a possible\nobject of such human experience, a point to which Leibowitz swiftly\nproceeds. For a thoroughgoing commitment to the idea of the radical\ntranscendence of God yields a number of important ontological\nconclusions that go beyond the semantic point made thus far. For\nLeibowitz, the idea of radical transcendence, if taken seriously,\nimplies that God cannot be \u201ccontained\u201d within any reality\nthat we encounter. Nature is nature, history is history \u2013 and if\nGod is truly transcendent neither are God or are related to God in any\ndirect sense. Thus, in a self-aware, if not self-deprecating moment,\nLeibowitz sets out his \u201cheresy\u201d (his description, not\nmine) thus: \u201cGod did not reveal himself in nature or in\nhistory.\u201d (Yahadut, 240) Were things otherwise, then\nnature and history would be \u201cGodly\u201d \u2013 and thus would\nbe perfect and worthy of worship themselves. There would be \u201cno\nroom for \u2018the holy God\u2019 who transcends natural reality,\nsince then reality itself is divine and man himself is God\u201d\n(Judaism, 25).\n\nFor Leibowitz, the only alternative to this view is a form of\npantheism \u2013 the attribution of divinity in some sense to natural\nobjects \u2013 an idea that he admits finds \u201cechoes \u2026 in\nJewish mysticism,\u201d which to that extent is therefore\n\u201cincompatible with halakhic Judaism\u201d (Judaism,\n26). The idea that any material object can be holy is something that,\nin Leibowitz\u2019s eyes, is the ultimate definition of idolatry,\npotentially leading to the worship of people, objects,\nor \u2013 significantly for his brand of Zionism \u2013 land. In\ncontrast, though it might seem ironic at first glance given his view\nof pantheism, Leibowitz here takes up an almost Spinozan approach to\nnature. For Leibowitz, taking God\u2019s transcendence seriously\nentails the elimination of superstitious beliefs in holy entities with\nsupernatural endowments, and thus he endorses a Spinozan\ndemythologization of the natural\n world.[4]\n But while Spinoza is willing to speak of \u201cGod or nature,\u201d\nfor Leibowitz, the natural world must be purified of any\ntrace of divinity; divinity \u2013 or holiness \u2013 is a notion that\nLeibowitz retains as a term to be used in connection with the God who\nradically transcends nature, with no\n remainder.[5]\n\nDenuding the world of divinity does not stop for Leibowitz at the\nnatural world. History, as the story of humankind in the natural\nworld, can no more carry divine significance than can a material\nobject. The idea that there is some divine purpose in history, that\nGod exerts some form of providence over humankind, would similarly\ncontradict the idea of God\u2019s transcendence and is thus a\nbaseless notion for Leibowitz for whom \u201can unbiased examination\nof the history of humankind and of the Jews as related in the Bible\nwill not reveal in the entire process \u2026 any design or definite\ndirection, or gradual approach to a specific goal\u201d\n(Judaism, 102).\n\nOn the basis of these remarks, one immediately sees that\nLeibowitz\u2019s thought will be devoid of much that passes for\ntraditional Jewish or general theology. Faith cannot be formulated\naround propositions that speak of God and his providential\nrelationship to the universe. Holiness is confined to God and cannot\nbe predicated of anything that exists in the world (which also,\nincidentally, explains his opposition to any ethnocentric\ninterpretation of the idea of Chosen-ness based on some intrinsic\n\u201cproperty\u201d of holiness that Jews inherit). Any attribution\nof holiness to objects that might be found in Jewish texts is to be\nunderstood as attributing functional rather than essential holiness to\nthe object in\n question.[6]\n\nLeibowitz\u2019s God is not a providential God; history has no\nteleology; and we find no attempts at theodicy in Leibowitz. In\ncontrast to many contemporary Jewish philosophers, the holocaust\nmerits barely a mention in his philosophical writings, other than to\ndismiss it from theological discussion. The holocaust, as a historical\nevent, can have no religious meaning for Leibowitz given his\nthoroughgoing commitment to divine transcendence that does not allow\nfor a God who is involved in human\n affairs.[7]\n Those who would question, indeed those who lost their faith in God as\na result of Auschwitz \u201cnever believed in God but in God\u2019s\nhelp\u2026 [for] one who believes in God \u2026 does not relate\nthis to belief in God\u2019s help\u201d (Accepting the\nYoke, 21).\n\nFor Leibowitz, this is a direct result of taking one\u2019s\ncommitment to the radical transcendence of God to its logical\nconclusion. It is one thing, Leibowitz might say, to pay lip service\nto the idea of God\u2019s transcendence. But if God is to be truly\ntranscendent, then we cannot associate our reality at any level with\nthat of God. The one statement that we can make regarding\nGod \u2013 that he is radically transcendent \u2013 can only be fleshed\nout further by clarifying how God is not anything that we can\nencounter in ordinary, or for that matter extraordinary, human\nexperience. That Leibowitz here goes beyond even Maimonides is clear\ninasmuch as for Maimonides, though we cannot speak of God\u2019s\nintrinsic properties, we can speak of his \u201cactions,\u201d which\nis to speak of the course of nature, of which God is the first cause.\nAnd yet for Leibowitz, even this would transgress the limits to which\nthe notion of radical transcendence binds us. To say that nature\nreflects God\u2019s actions renders God immanent in nature, and thus\nno longer transcendent. From both a semantic and ontological\nperspective, therefore, Leibowitz takes the notion of God\u2019s\ntranscendence further than even his own philosophical\n\u201cidol\u201d (see Statman 2005), leaving us with a Judaism that\nas Avi Sagi notes, is empty of both \u201ctheology and\n\u2018religious facts\u2019\u201d (Sagi 1997a, 206). \n",
