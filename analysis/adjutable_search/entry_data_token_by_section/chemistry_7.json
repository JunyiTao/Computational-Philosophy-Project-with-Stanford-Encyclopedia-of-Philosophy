    "main_text": "Atomism || Atomism in Aristotle and Boyle\n2.1 Atomism in Aristotle and Boyle\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s time, atomists held that matter was fundamentally\nconstructed out of atoms. These atoms were indivisible and uniform, of\nvarious sizes and shapes, and capable only of change in respect of\nposition and motion, but not intrinsic qualities. Aristotle rejected\nthis doctrine, beginning his critique of it with a simple question:\nWhat are atoms made of? Atomists argue that they are all made of\nuniform matter. But why should uniform matter split into portions not\nthemselves further divisible? What makes atoms different from\nmacroscopic substances which are also uniform, but can be divided into\nsmaller portions? Atomism, he argued, posits a particular size as the\nfinal point of division in completely ad hoc fashion, without giving\nany account of this smallest size or why atoms are this smallest\nsize.\n\nApart from questions of coherence, Aristotle argued that it was\nunclear and certainly unwarranted to assume that atoms have or lack\nparticular properties. Why shouldn\u2019t atoms have some degree of warmth\nand humidity like any observable body? But if they do, why shouldn\u2019t\nthe degree of warmth of a cold atom be susceptible to change by the\napproach of a warm atom, in contradiction with the postulate that\natoms only change their position and motion? On the other hand, if\natoms don\u2019t possess warmth and humidity, how can changes in degrees of\nwarmth and humidity between macroscopic substances be explained purely\non the basis of change in position and motion?\n\nThese and similar considerations led Aristotle to question whether the\natomists had a concept of substance at all. There are a large variety\nof substances discernible in the world\u2014the flesh, blood and bone\nof animal bodies; the water, rock, sand and vegetable matter by the\ncoast, etc. Atomism apparently makes no provision for accommodating\nthe differing properties of these substances, and their\ninterchangeability, when for example white solid salt and tasteless\nliquid water are mixed to form brine or bronze statues slowly become\ngreen. Aristotle recognized the need to accommodate the creation of\nnew substances with the destruction of old by combination involving\nthe mutual interaction and consequent modification of the primary\nfeatures of bodies brought into contact. In spite of the weaknesses of\nhis own theory, he displays a grasp of the issue entirely lacking on\nthe part of the atomists. His conception of elements as being few in\nnumber and of such a character that all the other substances are\ncompounds derived from them by combination and reducible to them by\nanalysis provided the seeds of chemical theory. Ancient atomism\nprovided none.\n\nRobert Boyle (1627\u20131691) is often credited with first breaking\nwith ancient and medieval traditions and inaugurating modern chemistry\nby fusing an experimental approach with mechanical philosophy. Boyle\u2019s\nchemical theory attempts to explain the diversity of substances,\nincluding the elements, in terms of variations of shape and size and\nmechanical arrangements of what would now be called sub-atomic atoms\nor corpuscles. Although Boyle\u2019s celebrated experimental work attempted\nto respond to Aristotelian orthodoxy, his theorizing about atoms had\nlittle impact on his experimental work. Chalmers (1993, 2002)\ndocuments the total absence of any connection between Boyle\u2019s atomic\nspeculations and his experimental work on the effects of pressure on\ngases. This analysis applies equally to Boyle\u2019s chemical experiments\nand chemical theorizing, which was primarily driven by a desire to\ngive a mechanical philosophy of chemical combination (Chalmers 2009,\nCh. 6). No less a commentator than Antoine Lavoisier (1743\u20131794)\nwas quite clear that Boyle\u2019s corpuscular theories did nothing to\nadvance chemistry. As he noted towards the end of the next century,\n\u201c\u2026 if, by the term elements, we mean to express\nthose simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is\nextremely probable we know nothing at all about them\u201d (1789, p.\nxxiv). Many commentators thus regard Boyle\u2019s empirically-based\ncriticisms of the Aristotelian chemists more important than his own\natomic theories.\n",
