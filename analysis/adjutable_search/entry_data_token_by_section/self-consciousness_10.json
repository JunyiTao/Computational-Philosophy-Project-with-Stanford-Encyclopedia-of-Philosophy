    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Experience || Consciousness of the Self\n3.1 Consciousness of the Self\n\nIt is natural to suppose that self-consciousness is, fundamentally, a\nconscious awareness of the self. On such a view, one is self-conscious\nif, when one introspects, one is aware of a thing that is, in some\nsense, presented as oneself. This is the view, mentioned in\n \u00a71.2,\n that Hume seems to be rejecting with his claim that when he\nintrospects he can never catch himself, but only perceptions (Hume\n1739\u201340: bk. 1, ch. 4, \u00a76). Whilst Hume\u2019s claim has\nbeen very influential, it has not found universal acceptance. Those\nsiding with Hume include Shoemaker (1986), Martin (1997), Howell\n(2010), and Prinz (2012) (for a related, Jamesian perspective, see\nFlanagan 1992: ch. 9). Those opposing him include Chisholm (1976: ch.\n1), Cassam (1995), G. Strawson (2009), Damasio (2010) and Rosenthal\n(2012).\n\nAs with first-person thought, the issue is not whether one is, or can\nbe, conscious of what is in fact oneself. If that were sufficient for\nself-consciousness then, on the supposition that one is identical to\none\u2019s body, seeing oneself in a mirror would be a case of\nself-consciousness, even if one were unaware that it was oneself that\none saw. Rather, the issue is whether one is, or can be, conscious of\noneself as oneself, a form of awareness in which it is\nmanifest to one that the object of awareness is oneself. If there is\nsuch an awareness then this is philosophically significant, since one\nmight expect it to ground certain cases of self-knowledge,\nfirst-person reference, and the immunity to error of certain\nfirst-person thoughts (Shoemaker 1986; see the entry on\n self-knowledge).\n The inner consciousness of the self as F, for example, would\naccount for one\u2019s capacity to refer to oneself as\noneself, one\u2019s knowledge that one is F, and the fact\nthat such a thought cannot rest on a misidentification of another\nthing as oneself. On the other hand, the claim that there is\nno such conscious awareness of the self is philosophically\nsignificant, not only because it undermines the possibility of such\nexplanations but also for the reason that it plays an important role\nin various well known arguments: for example, in Kant\u2019s\nFirst Critique (1781/1787), most obviously the Transcendental\nDeduction, the Refutation of Idealism, and the Paralogisms, and in\nWittgenstein\u2019s discussion of the conceptual problem of other\nminds (Kripke 1982: Postscript).\n\nA simple argument for the claim that we are introspectively aware of\nourselves is that in introspection one is perceptually aware of\none\u2019s own mental properties, and that when one perceives a\nproperty one perceives that which has that property, i.e., oneself.\nShoemaker (1984b, 1986) agrees that if there is an\nintrospective awareness of the self as an object, then it should be\nunderstood as a form of self-perception. He argues, however,\nthat, on a plausible account of perception, introspection is not a\nform of perception, so we do not introspectively perceive\nanything, including the self. As such, we cannot conclude in this way\nthat we are introspectively aware of the self (cf. Martin 1997;\nRosenthal 2012).\n\nShoemaker further argues, in a way reminiscent of the Heidelberg\nSchool (Frank 1995; Musholt 2015: ch. 1), that the postulation of an\nintrospective awareness of the self as the self would not be\nin a position to explain all self-knowledge. According to Shoemaker\n(1984b: 105), if inner perception revealed an object to be F,\nthen I would only be in a position to judge that I am F if I\nalready took myself to be that object that I perceive. But this both\npresupposes some (non-perceptual) self-knowledge (i.e., that I am the\nthing perceived via inner sense), and also implausibly opens\nup introspection based first-person thought to the possibility of\nerrors of misidentification, since such a view would entail that\nintrospective self-knowledge is based in part on an identification of\nthe self.\n\nA number of philosophers have maintained that, even if Hume is right\nthat introspection does not reveal the self as an object, there is\nanother form of perceptual experience which does:\n bodily awareness (see entry).\n Versions of this claim can be found in P.F. Strawson (1966: 102),\nEvans (1982: ch. 7), Sutton Morris (1982), Ayers (1991), Brewer\n(1995), Cassam (1995, 1997), Berm\u00fadez (1998, 2011). On this\nview, through bodily awareness I am aware of my body \u201cfrom the\ninside\u201d as a bodily self, as me. Brewer (1995), for\nexample, argues that since bodily sensations are both manifestly\nproperties of oneself and are perceived as located properties of\none\u2019s body, it follows that in bodily awareness one perceives\none\u2019s body as oneself.\n\nIf one\u2019s body is presented as oneself in bodily awareness then,\nas mentioned above, we might expect this bodily self-perception to\nground first-person thought about one\u2019s bodily states. As\npointed out in\n \u00a72,\n it is plausible that first-person thoughts cannot fail to refer to\ntheir thinker and further that this is manifest in the thinking of\nthem. Martin (1995, 1997) argues on the basis of these two claims that\nif bodily awareness is a form of self-awareness, then one\u2019s body\nas presented in bodily awareness must manifestly be oneself. That is,\nif a form of awareness is to ground judgements which are manifestly\nabout myself, then that form of awareness must manifestly be an\nawareness of myself. But this is arguably a condition that it does not\nmeet, since it is perfectly coherent to wonder whether or not one is\nidentical to one\u2019s body, just as Descartes famously did in the\nMeditations (for a different, imagination-based, argument\nagainst bodily awareness as a form of self-awareness, see Joel Smith\n2006b; see Berm\u00fadez 2011 for a response; for discussions of the\nrelation between self-consciousness and imagination see B. Williams\n1973; Reynolds 1989; Velleman 1996).\n\nAnother way in which it can be argued that the self figures in sensory\nexperience is in the self-locating content of perceptual experience,\nmost notably vision. Visual experience is perspectival, containing\ninformation not only about perceived objects but also of their spatial\nrelation to the perceiver: I see the wall as in front of me,\nthe bookcase as to my left, and so on. The (bodily) self, it\nmight be argued, is experienced as an object in the world, the point\nof origin of egocentric perception (Cassam 1997: 52\u201353; Hurley\n1998: ch. 4; Berm\u00fadez 1998: ch. 5, 2002, 2011; Peacocke 1999:\nch. 6; Schwenkler 2014). On an alternative view, one consistent with\nthe rejection of any sort of awareness of the self as an object,\nvisual perception does not present the self at its point of origin,\nbut rather represents the locations of perceived objects in monadic\nterms, as ahead, to the left, and so on, without\nspecifying what it is that they are ahead, or to the left, of\n(Campbell 1994: \u00a74.1; 2002: \u00a79.3; Perry 1986).\n",
