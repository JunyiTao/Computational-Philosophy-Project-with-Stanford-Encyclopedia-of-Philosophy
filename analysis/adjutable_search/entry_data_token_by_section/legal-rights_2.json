Some noteworthy introductions\nand elucidations of the Hohfeldian analysis include Fitzgerald\n[Salmond] (1966: 221\u2013233); Wellman (1985: 7\u201315); Sumner\n(1987: 18\u201331); Jones (1994: 12\u201325); Kramer (1998:\n7\u201360); Edmundson (2004: 87\u2013102); Wenar (2005:\n224\u2013237; 2005 [2021] the SEP entry on\n rights);\n and Harel (2005: 192\u2013193).\n\nWriting specifically on the law, Hohfeld distills four different legal\npositions residing under the term \u201cright\u201d as it is used in\nlaw: claim, privilege, power, and\nimmunity. Each position designates a type of normative\nrelation between a right-subject and a right-object\n(Raz 1970: 176). \u201cRight-subject\u201d denotes a right\u2019s\nholder. \u201cRight-object\u201d denotes the party the right is held\nover or against. Finally, a right\u2019s\n\u201ccontent\u201d denotes the normative component of the\nright; that is, the specific normative relation obtaining pursuant to\nthe right between the right\u2019s subject and its object (Sumner\n1987: 24). As normative relations, each one of the four\nHohfeldian positions held by right-subjects correlates to a certain\ntype of normative position in the right-object. Altogether, Hohfeld\nidentifies four pairs of correlatives: claim/duty;\nprivilege/no-claim; power/liability; and,\nimmunity/disability. For example, X (right-subject)\ncan hold a contractual claim against Y (right-object)\nthat Y paint X\u2019s house, where Y is under a\ncorrelative duty to X to paint her house\n(right-content). \n\nClaims and privileges are first-order norms, respectively\ndeterminative of what the relevant parties ought to do or\nmay do. Powers and immunities are second-order norms (that is\npertaining to other norms), respectively determinative of whether\nparties are able or unable to change certain norms\n(Sumner 1987: 27\u201329). Some Hohfeldian positions are active while\nothers passive (Lyons 1970; Sumner 1987: 29\u201331). Rights that are\nactively exercised determine what right-holders may do\n(privilege-right) or can do (power-right). Rights which right-holders\nenjoy passively, determine what right-objects ought to do\n(claim-right) or cannot do (immunity-right). \n3.1.1 Claim-Right\n\nWhile law deploys the term \u201cright\u201d to refer to all four\nHohfeldian positions, \u201crights\u201d are typically most\nassociated with claim-rights, which Hohfeld denotes as right \u201cin\nits strictest sense\u201d. A \u201cclaim\u201d is a type of\nentitlement (Kamm 2002: 476). X has a claim-right\nagainst Y with respect to some \u03c6 if and only if Y is\nunder a duty to X to \u03c6. Claim-rights are, therefore,\n\u201cdirected\u201d\u2014the claim of the right-subject is\ndirected at the right-object, whose correlative duty is owed to\n(directed at) the right-subject. Claim-rights correlate either to\n\u201cnegative\u201d duties not to impede one\u2019s \u03c6-ing\n(e.g., the right not to be defamed) or to \u201cpositive\u201d\nduties to actively further one\u2019s \u03c6-ing (e.g., the right to\nreceive state welfare benefits) (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n234\u2013235). Examples of legal claim-rights are property\nowners\u2019 rights against others not to trespass on their land, or\npromisees\u2019 contractual rights that promisors do as they\npromised. \n3.1.2 Privilege (or Liberty)\n\nThat X holds against Y a privilege to \u03c6 entails that\nX is not under a duty to Y not to \u03c6 and,\ncorrelatively, that Y does not hold a claim against X\nnot to \u03c6. Put differently, a privilege to do something is a\ndirected liberty or permission to do so. Accordingly, the Hohfeldian\nopposite of a privilege to \u03c6 is a duty not to \u03c6. Similarly to\nclaim-rights, a privilege can be positive\u2014that is liberty to\nact\u2014or negative\u2014that is liberty to omit from\nacting\u2014or both. In the literature, Hohfeld\u2019s term\n\u201cprivilege\u201d is often exchanged for \u201cliberty\u201d,\nterms here used interchangeably. \n\nAre privileges (or liberties) genuine \u201crights\u201d, as Hohfeld\nposits? In some respects, a liberty is the paradigm of a right (e.g.,\nHobbes 1651: ch. XIV). Yet, at least in law, there is something\nmisleading in the Hohfeldian notion that standalone privileges\n(\u201cnaked privileges\u201d) qualify as \u201crights\u201d.\nAfter all, how does a privilege to \u03c6 count as a legal right, if\nthe privilege-holder does not also hold some accompanying legal claim\nor other form of legal insolation against interference with her\n\u03c6-ing? (Hart 1982: 173; Sumner 1987: 35; Raz 1994: 275). In fact,\nstand-alone liberties to \u03c6 are compatible with others\u2019\nliberties to interfere with one\u2019s \u03c6-ing (Hart 1982:\n166\u2013167; Jones 1994: 18\u201319). It is not clear, therefore,\nwhat stand-alone liberties do for putative right-holders; at least not\nin legal system in which liberty is the default legal position (that\nis, unless positively forbidden, \u03c6-ing is permitted).\n\nRegardless, in practice, legal privileges to \u03c6 are mostly (even if\nnot necessarily) secured by a measure of legal protection against\ninterference. Firstly, occasionally there are explicit legal\nclaim-rights to \u03c6 accompanying privileges to \u03c6. Secondly,\nprivileges are regularly secured by a \u201cprotective\nperimeter\u201d of legal prohibitions and claim-rights (other than to\n\u03c6) effectively securing significant aspects of\none\u2019s freedom to \u03c6 (Hart 1982: 167 & 171\u2013173;\nSteiner 1994: 75\u201376; Kramer 1998: 11\u201312). For example,\neven if one does not have a specific legal claim-right to \u201cwalk\non a public street\u201d, one\u2019s privilege to do so is largely\nsecured by various legal prohibitions on conduct that could interfere\nwith one\u2019s enjoying that privilege, such as crimes and torts of\nassault, privacy, harassment, battery, and false imprisonment.\n\nMoreover, normally liberty-rights to \u03c6 are considered as more than\nmere \u201clack of duties\u201d to \u03c6. Liberties are thought of\nas \u201cfull-liberties\u201d\u2014that is, liberties to \u03c6 or\nto not \u03c6\u2014rather than as\n\u201chalf-liberties\u201d\u2014that is, liberties to \u03c6 without\nthe liberty to not \u03c6. Accordingly, \u201cmandatory rights\u201d,\nsuch as children\u2019s liberty to attend school or a\nconscript\u2019s liberty to enlist in the army (that is, a lack of\nduty not to attend or not to enlist) may be labeled\n\u201chalf-rights\u201d or \u201chalf-liberties\u201d, given that\nwhile they involve liberty to attend school or to enlist, they do not\nprovide liberty not to do so (Feinberg 1980: 157, 237; See also Hart\n1982: 166\u2013167). \n3.1.3 Power\n\nLoosely, a normative power is the ability to alter (through volitional\naction) the normative landscape; and in law, legal power is the\nlegally recognized ability to change or create legal positions,\nrelations, and norms (e.g., Hohfeld 1919: 50\u201357). The opposite\nof holding a power is normative disability. Correlative to\nX\u2019s power over Y to alter an aspect of\nY\u2019s normative position is Y\u2019s liability to\nX\u2019s respective power. While \u201cpublic powers\u201d\nare vested in the state or persons in their capacity as an agent or\nofficer of the state, \u201cprivate powers\u201d are vested in\nprivate persons (or corporations) ((Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n229\u2013230). For example, parliament holds a legal power over the\ncitizenry to enact laws that bind them, and citizens are correlatively\nliable to that legislative power; prosecutors hold the power to\nprosecute criminal defendants; and, in private law, owning property\ntypically includes the power to gift or bequeath title to others;\nestate law empowers people to create wills; contract law provides\npower to enter into contractual obligations; and agency law empowers\nto appoint others to take legal actions in one\u2019s stead. \n\nBut are powers indeed legal rights in themselves, as is\nHohfeld\u2019s view? Arguably not. At least not when divorced of\nprivilege to exercise or to refrain from exercising that power. For\ninstance, under the market overt rule, a thief seemingly holds a legal\npower to sell stolen goods but it would be odd to describe the thief\nas holding a legal \u201cright\u201d to do so (Raz 1972: 82).\nSimilarly, if a judge is under a duty to rule in a certain way on a\ncertain issue, it would be odd to describe her as holding a\n\u201cright\u201d to rule in that way, even if she holds the power\nto do so. \n\nIn any case, Hohfeld\u2019s account of legal power as ability to\nalter legal relations via volitional conduct (Hohfeld 1919:\n50\u201351), seems too broad. For example, the commission of a tort\nor crime entails changes to legal positions (mostly one\u2019s own)\nand typically involve volitional conduct, yet do not appear exercises\nof legal power (MacCormick 1981 [2008: 98\u2013100]). Refining\nHohfeld\u2019s account, some offer narrower conceptions of legal\npower (Halpin 1996; 142\u2013147). For instance, emphasizing acting\nwith intent to thereby alter a legal position, as a condition for\nexercising a power to do so (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 229;\nMacCormick 1972: 63; 1981 [2008: 97\u201398]). Although, arguably\nthis refinement is also too broad (e.g., homeless persons\nintentionally committing crimes as a means of exchanging the street\nfor prison; or, a person moving house, thereby incurring obligations\nnot to cause a nuisance to her new neighbors) as well as too narrow\n(e.g., unintentionally entering a contract). Another approach is that\n\u03c6-ing only counts as an exercise of a legal power if \u03c6-ing\nbrings about a certain legal change L and law\u2019s reasons\nfor acknowledging \u03c6-ing as resulting in L is that people\nare reasonably expected to \u03c6 only for the purpose of effecting\nL (Raz 1972: 80\u201381; 1975: [1999: 98\u2013104]. For\nexample, forming a contract by signing it (for a critical assessment\nof Raz\u2019 view see Halpin 1997: 61\u201365).\n3.1.4 Immunity\n\nX holds an immunity against Y in respect of some aspect\nof X\u2019s normative position, if Y is disabled (lacks\npower) to alter that position. Correlative to X\u2019s\nimmunity is Y\u2019s respective disability. The Hohfeldian\nopposite of an immunity is liability (vulnerability to power). An\nexample of a legal immunity is judges\u2019 immunity from civil\nliability for actions performed in their judicial capacity. Other\nexamples include the immunities of competent adults from others\nunilaterally transferring title to their property or changing the\nterms of their contracts, the immunity from being divorced by\none\u2019s spouse (in legal systems that do recognize divorce) and,\nthe immunity of witnesses in judicial proceedings from defamation\nliability. \n\nLike in the case of privileges and powers, it is not obvious that all\nstand-alone powers are in fact naturally identified as\n\u201crights\u201d. Take for example a municipality\u2019s lack of\nlegal power to bestow a benefit, such as a permit or pension. While\nsuch a disabling legal rule perhaps bestows an immunity (namely, an\nimmunity from receiving a legal permission or entitlement), it does\nnot naturally appear to grant a \u201cright\u201d to the person\n\u201cenjoying\u201d the immunity (Hart 1982: 191). \n3.1.5 Complex Hohfeldian Rights\n\nLegal rights are typically composites of more than one Hohfeldian\nposition. In fact, as demonstrated above, some argue that at least\ncertain Hohfeldian positions do not necessarily count as genuine\nrights when appearing in isolation from certain other Hohfeldian\npositions (Sumner 1987: 34\u201353; Steiner 1994: 61\u201380). In\nany case, breaking legal rights down into Hohfeldian positions is an\nexcellent clarificatory tool, providing a precise picture of the legal\nrelations at play. For instance, the constitutional right to free\nspeech involves: claim-rights (such as against censure); (full)\nprivileges (such as the permission and lack of duty to express or not\nto express one\u2019s opinion); and, immunities (such as the\nlegislators\u2019 disability to expunge one\u2019s free-speech\nclaim-rights, immunities, and privileges). Looking to private law,\ncreditors, for instance, hold claims against debtors to the payment of\ntheir debts; privileges to collect or not to collect debts; power to\nforgive debts; and, immunities from other private parties unilaterally\nwaiving or annulling those respective claims, privileges, and\npowers.\n3.2 Legal Rights to Do Legal Wrongs\n\nOne particularly puzzling combination of Hohfeldian relations is a\n\u201cright to do wrong\u201d. There is of course nothing puzzling\nin rights of one normative kind to violate duties of another normative\nkind. For example, legal rights to do that which one has a moral duty\nnot to do are not uncommon (such as exploiting tax havens). Yet, the\nidea of a right of one normative kind to do wrong of the same\nnormative kind can seem oxymoronic. \n\nAnd still, for many an essential feature of rights is providing for\ndoing even what one ought not to do. Dworkin, for example, explains\nthat:\n\n\n\u2026 when I say you have the right to spend your money gambling,\nthough you ought to spend it in a more worthwhile way. I mean that it\nwould be wrong for anyone to interfere with you even though you\npropose to spend your money in a way that I think is wrong. (1977:\n188) \n\n\nAnd Raz claims that \u201c[t]o show that one has a right to perform\nthe act is to show that even if it is wrong he is entitled to perform\nit\u201d (1979: 274).\n\nConceptually, the Hohfeldian analysis of rights as well as the\n\u201cfunctions\u201d of rights (see\n Section 4)\n seem to allow for rights to do wrong (Waldron 1981; Kramer 1998:\n14\u201317; Enoch 2002). X holds a right to do wrong if\nX has a claim against Y (and Y is under a\ncorrelative duty to X) that Y somehow facilitate or not\ninterfere with X doing something that X has a duty not\nto do. In Hohfeldian terms, rights to do wrong are claim-rights\nwithout privileges (Waldron 1981; George 1993: 118\u2013122). To\ndispel the sense of contradiction in the term \u201cright to do\nwrong\u201d, one needs to recognize that a right (claim-right) to do\nwrong does not bear on the rightness or the wrongness (lack of\nprivilege) of that which one has a (claim-)right to do. Arguably,\nimmunities can also function as rights to do wrong, as they secure a\nmeasure of freedom (relative to others) from intervention with\none\u2019s doing that which one has duty not to do (Herstein 2014:\n37\u201345).\n\nMoving from conceptual possibility to morality, while clearly there is\nno blanket moral right to do moral wrong, some argue that such rights\nare not a mere conceptual possibility. For example, even if one has a\nmoral duty (lack of privilege) not to join a bigoted association,\narguably one enjoys a moral claim protective of one\u2019s (wrongful)\nchoice to do so. Among the values claimed to ground such rights are\npersonal autonomy (Waldron 1981: 34\u201335; 1983: 325\u2013337;\nEnoch 2002: 379\u2013380; Herstein 2012: 354\u2013357); personal\nintegrity (George 1993: 124\u2013125); moral constitution of self\n(Herstein 2012, 357\u2013364); and of conscience (Brownlee, 2012:\n126\u2013128). In contrast, others deny morality contains rights to\ndo wrong (Galston 1983; \u00d8verland 2007; Bolinger 2017).\n\nNow to law. The concept of \u201clegality\u201d does not seem to\nrule out legal rights to do legal wrongs (Herstein 2014: 27\u201331;\nLaborde 2021: 6\u20137). And, as a conceptual matter, there can be\nlegal rights providing legal protections (claims, immunities) to do\nthat which the law forbids (Kramer 1998, 15\u201317; Herstein 2014:\n32\u201345). In contrast, Laborde argues for a\n\u201ctoleration\u201d conception of legal rights to do legal wrong,\nwherein right-holders are exempt (privilege) from legal prohibition on\n\u03c6-ing, yet remain vulnerable to expressive sanctions for \u03c6-ing\n(2021). Examples offered in the literature of legal rights to do legal\nwrong include diplomatic immunity (Herstein 2014: 43\u201344) and\nministerial exemptions (Laborde 2021).\n3.3 Claim-Rights Without Correlative Duties\n\nHohfeldian correlativity suggests that (claim-)rights are analytically\nor formally equivalent with duties, so that a (claim-)right of one\nperson entails a correlative duty of another (Feinberg 1973:\n63\u201364; Sumner 1987: 24\u201325). It is not clear, however,\nwhether this is in fact true. Namely, claim-rights do not always seem\nto correlate with a duty (Honor\u00e9 1960: 456\u2013457; Feinberg\n1973: 64\u201367; Raz 1970: 175\u2013183; Lyons 1970: 45\u201355;\nMacCormick 1977: 199\u2013202; 1982: 161\u2013162; Lyons 1994:\n32\u201334; Kamm 2002: 480). \n\nFor instance, law regularly recognizes rights even when it is unclear\nor underdetermined what duties give those rights effect (MacCormick\n1982: 163). At other times, the duty correlating to a right is\nconditioned on certain states of affairs, so that the duty only vests\nonce the factual condition is met (Raz 1970: 226). MacCormick\u2019s\nexample is of a law granting the surviving children of a decedent a\nright in the estate. The right is against the estate\u2019s executor\nfor a portion of the estate (once all debts and existing claims are\nsatisfied). Thus, at the time of its vesting, the right does not\ncorrelate to any vested duty. It is only once an executor is appointed\nby the courts that such duties form (MacCormick 1977: 200\u2013203).\n\n\nAccordingly, it is arguably both conceptually possible and practically\nnot unheard off for claim-rights to obtain without correlative duties.\nThus, even if a right is a (valid) claim\u2014that is, a legal\nentitlement to something\u2014rights arguably do not necessarily\nentail some correlative duty in others (Feinberg 1973: 65\u201367;\nFeinberg 1980: 139\u2013141). This seems to be in tension with\nHohfeldian correlativity when it comes to claim-rights, although some\ndisagree (Kramer 1998: 27\u201330).\n3.4 Rights \u201cIn Personam\u201d and Rights \u201cIn Rem\u201d\n\nClaims, privileges, powers, and immunities can manifest as either\nrights in personam or in rem. Rights in\npersonam are rights the content of which designates a specific\nand definite right-object. These rights are typically associated with\nthe law of obligations (contracts, trusts, and parts of torts),\nwherein rights are expressly held against a specific person or\npersons, such as a promisor, trustee, or tortfeasor. \n\nIn contrast, the content of rights in rem explicitly\ndesignates a \u201cthing\u201d that one holds the right over, not\nagainst whom specifically that right is held. Accordingly, such rights\nare not held against a definitive individual(s), but against an\nindefinite set of right-objects. If you will, rights in rem\nare held against every eligible individual yet, against no one\nspecifically (Hohfeld 1919: 68\u2013114; Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n235\u2013237). Thus, rights in rem are describable as\nnormative relations between right-holders and everyone else (as\nindividuals, not a group) in relation to a certain\n\u201cthing\u201d (Ross 1953: 230\u2013231). Most commonly, rights\nin rem are associated with property law, such as one\u2019s\nrights to possess or to reasonably use and enjoy one\u2019s land,\nwhich is held against every person (Radin 1938: 1155\u20131156;\nKramer 1998: 10 f2). Yet, the \u201cthings\u201d over which rights\nin rem are held include not only property (real, personal, or\nintellectual), but also, for example, other rights, the integrity of\none\u2019s person, emotions, and reputation (Hohfeld 1919:\n85\u201386; Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 224). \n\nThe distinction between these two types of rights tracks a difference\ntypical to their respective moral roles. Namely, rights in\npersonam seem designed to give legal effect to significant\nrelationships between specific individuals, while rights in\nrem are typically oriented towards the value that exclusive\naccess, control over, security in, integrity of (etc.) certain\n\u201cthings\u201d have for right-holders (Fitzgerald [Salmond]\n1966: 237\u2013238). Moreover, given the association between the two\ntypes of right with different branches of law, the distinction between\nrights in rem and rights in personam emphasizes an\naffinity between those legal branches and the two different moral\nroles of each type of right. That is, much of the law of obligations\nin about obligations between specific individuals, while property law\nis focused more on securing the affinity between individuals and\ncertain \u201cthings\u201d. \n\nFinally, the way rights in rem and rights in\npersonam are deployed impacts the measure of freedom allowed in a\nlegal system. Broadly speaking, negative claim-rights are more\nconducive to the personal liberty of right-objects than positive\nduties. Negative claim-rights forbid a set of actions, leaving all\nother options open. In contrast, positive claim-rights require certain\nactions, thereby forbidding all other incompatible options.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, legal system that prize personal liberty\ntend to adopt in rem negative claim-rights (e.g., the tort\nright against interference with contract) and in personam\npositive claim-rights (e.g., a contractual right to receive a\nservice). There are, of course, exception to this rule of thumb, such\nas the in rem positive claim-right to a rescue found in\nGood Samaritan laws (Jones 1994: 15\u201316). \n4. What Rights Are: Function and Value\n\nGiven that, as explained above, \u201crights\u201d take different\nforms and combine in a variety of configurations (as well as greatly\nvary in content), what unites them under the single category of\n\u201cright\u201d? \n\nThe beginning of the answer is that rights are typically for or in\nsome sense entitle right-holders. Notice first that not all legal\nnorms exhibiting Hohfeldian forms are legal rights. For example, an\nimmunity from inheriting property rights on the grounds of one\u2019s\ngender hardly seems to qualify as a \u201cright\u201d (Lyons 1994:\n11); or, imagine a claim-\u201cright\u201d to be persecuted by state\nauthorities; or, consider a claim-right to die of starvation (Jones\n1994: 29). As these examples suggest (as do the counter-examples\noffered above to the notion that stand-alone privileges, powers, and\nimmunities necessarily qualify as \u201crights\u201d in normal\ndiscourse\n [Sections 3.1.2\u20143.1.4]),\n a feature seemingly differentiating rights from other norms\nexhibiting Hohfeldian forms is somehow entitling or fulfilling a\ncertain function vis-\u00e0-vis the right-holder. What,\nthen, is this \u201cfunction\u201d of rights? How, in other words,\ndo rights entitle right-holders? \n\nBut, before discussing the primary answers to this question, a few\npreliminary comments are in order. First, beyond clarifying our\nanalytic understanding of the idea of \u201cright\u201d, the\ntheories of the function of rights are justificatory. That is, they\nare typically value-laden, describing the uniting overarching feature\nor function of rights in terms of value to right-holders;\nthereby explaining a moral value putatively inherent to all rights,\nqua rights. Thus, although none of the theories on offer\nmanages to capture the entire scope of rights discourse, they do\ncapture core cases of rights, fleshing out what is inherently morally\nappealing about them. Succinctly, in one way or another, all these\ntheories share the insight that a legal system committed to rights is\noriented towards the ideal of treating the individual person as\nlaw\u2019s primary unit of concern. To paraphrase Thomas Hardy, if\n\u201cpoetry is emotion put into measure\u201d, then rights are\nliberal values put into law.\n\nSecond, this entry focuses on functions of legal rights as such,\nindependent of the content of any specific right. This is not to deny\nthat different legal rights (e.g., rights to freedom, property,\nagainst self-incrimination) are uniquely valuable to right-holders.\nOnly that such right-specific values are not the focus of this entry.\n\n\nThird, any necessary function that rights fulfill qua rights\nvis-\u00e0-vis right-holders sets a condition for\nright-holding. For example, under the Interest Theory, rights broadly\nspeaking benefit right-holders (see Section 4.2). Thus, if\na right does not benefit X, X does not hold that right.\nRelatedly, as demonstrated in the supplement to this entry (referenced\nbelow), the function of rights is intimately connected with the matter\nof what types of entities can or cannot as a general matter hold\nrights (see Jones 1994: 67\u201371; Kramer 2001: 29\u201358; Kurki\n2019: 62\u201388). For example, under the Interest Theory, if\nX is not the sort of entity that has interests, then X\ncategorically cannot hold any rights (e.g., Raz 1986: 166). \n\nThere are several competing theories on the function of rights. This\nentry focuses primarily on the two leading theories: the \u201cWill\n(or Choice) Theory\u201d and the \u201cInterest Theory\u201d. Some\nattention is also given to \u201cDemand Theories\u201d. Other\napproaches include Kamm\u2019s view that rights can protect\nright-holder\u2019s status as persons, such as respecting their\nagency or equal moral worth, regardless of their interests (2002:\n485\u2013487); \u201cHybrid Theories\u201d, combining elements from\nthe interest and the Will Theories (Sreenivasan 2005: 267\u2013274;\n2010: 484\u2013494; McBride 2017a); Wenar\u2019s\n\u201cMulti-Function Theory\u201d, denying rights have only a single\nfunction (2005: 246\u2013251), and his \u201cKind Desire\nTheory\u201d arguing that the function of rights turns on what\nrole-bearers desire in their capacity as bearers of that type of role\n(2013; Schaab 2018); And, Cruft\u2019s \u201cAddressive\nTheory\u201d, emphasizing the second-personal aspects of\ndirected-duties (2019: 44\u201370). \n\nThe debate over the theories of the function of rights revolves\nheavily on the theories\u2019 extensional adequacy (that is, to what\ndegree a theory adequately captures the discourse of\n\u201crights\u201d). While each of the leading two theories captures\nimportant instances of rights, neither manages to encompass the full\nparameters of rights discourse. The debate remains unsettled, with\never-growing nuance and ingenuity. See the supplementary document:\n\n\nExtensional Adequacy of Theories of Rights\n\n\n\nfor further details on some of this debate, including the primary\nchallenges and related refinements of the Will and the Interest\nTheories. \n4.1 The Will Theory\n\nAccording to the Will (or Choice) Theory, rights provide right-holders\na measure of normative control over themselves or others, functioning\nto make right-holders \u201csmall-scale sovereign[s]\u201d over\ncertain domains (Hart 1982: 183; 1983: 35). Most prominently,\nright-holders control as a matter of choice the duties owed to them by\nothers, holding the Hohfeldian power to annul, waive, enforce, or\ntransfer such duties (Hart 1982: 183\u20134). The Will Theory also\nfits with Hohfeldian privileges, providing options for how one may\nchoose to act or to exercise one\u2019s powers (MacCormick 1977:\n193\u2013194). Moreover, claim-rights and immunities function to\nprotect the free exercise of such privileges (Hart 1982: 172; Simmonds\n1998: 218\u2013220) and powers. Prominent proponents of the Will\nTheory include Kant, Hart, Wellman, Steiner, Sumner, and\nRipstein.\n\nThe branch of law most hospitable to the Will Theory is private law.\nBe it the law of contract, property, torts, or trusts, right-holders\ntypically wield considerable\u2014although by no means\ncomplete\u2014control over Hohfeldian positions that they stand in in\nrelation to others. For instance, within limits and subject to various\nexceptions, holders of private law rights are empowered to waive\ncompliance with certain obligations owed to them, forgo remedial\nrights, and annul or transfer some such claims, as well as certain\nprivate law powers, liberties, and immunities (see, e.g., Stevens\n2007: 17\u201319). \n\nFrom a justificatory perspective, emphasizing right-holders\u2019\nchoice and control, the Will Theory stresses the affinity between\nrights and values that are related to an individual\u2019s control\nover his/her lives, including personal liberty, self-realization,\nagency, and autonomy. Thereby demonstrating how rights can neatly fit\npolitical moralities concerned with such values (Kramer 1998: 75;\nSumner 1987: 47). \n\nThat said, coupling claim-rights and powers over those claims (and\ntheir correlative duties) can also make rights attractive to certain\npolitical moralities that, at best, value human agency, autonomy, and\nfreedom not intrinsically, but instrumentally (Kramer 1998:\n76\u201377). For instance, viewing law as a vehicle for wealth\nmaximization invites markets in legal entitlements, thereby requiring\nthe liberty and power to waive and transfer rights. \n\nArguably, the justificatory virtues of rights as fleshed out by the\nWill Theory can be subsumed under the Interest Theory. If so, this is\nbecause values such as autonomy, freedom, and control secured by\nholding power over the duties owed to one, are arguably themselves in\nthe interest of right-holders (MacCormick 1977: 207\u2013208; Raz\n1994: 149\u201350; Kramer 2001: 61; Edmundson 2004: 127). \n4.2 The Interest Theory\n\nAccording to the Interest Theory, speaking broadly, rights protect or\nfurther right-holders\u2019 interests. Accordingly, unlike Will\nTheorists, Interest Theorists tend to emphasis claim-rights more than\npowers (Kramer 2013: 246; 2017: 49). Still fitting the Interest\nTheory, holding liberties, powers, and immunities is often also in the\nservice of one\u2019s interests (MacCormick 1977: 205). Prominent\nproponents of the Interest Theory include Bentham, Austin, Mill, Lyons,\nMacCormick, Raz, and Kramer. \n\nA canonical version of the Interest Theory is Joseph Raz\u2019s,\npositing that rights are protected interests and that X has a\nright if and only if \n\n\nan aspect of X\u2019s well-being (his interest) is a\nsufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to be under a duty.\n(1986: 166; 1994: 266\u2013269) \n\n\nUnder this view, X holds a legal right if the law\nholds X\u2019s interest \u201cto be sufficient ground to hold\nanother to be subject to a duty\u201d (1994: 268). \n\nPrescriptively, in demonstrating that rights are protective of\nright-holders\u2019 interests, the Interest Theory fleshes out how\nrights are attractive to political moralities prizing individual\nwell-being and welfare. \n\nIt is not obvious, however, that all legal norms identified as\n\u201crights\u201d under the Interest Theory indeed exhibit these\nappealing features. First, it is not uncommon for legal rights to be\nheld by entities other than people. For instance, legal rights have\nbeen extended to animals, plants, corporations, and even natural\nphenomena (e.g., rivers or nature preserves). Depending on one\u2019s\nconception of \u201cinterest\u201d, the interest-theory can\ncomfortably capture at least some such rights (Kramer 2001:\n29\u201346). For example, it seems obvious that certain animals,\ngroups, corporations, and even plants have interests and, as such, can\nbe made better or worse off and, therefore, can in that sense hold\nrights. \n\nYet, an account of such rights as inherently morally favorable in\nterms of benefiting right-holders would have to rely on values other\nthan individuals\u2019 well-being or welfare. Which in certain\ninstances seems unproblematic, such as in the case of animal rights.\nYet, in other cases, such as in the case of corporate entities, the\ninterests of which do not seem of inherent moral value, the notion\nthat in protecting interests all rights\u2014qua\nrights\u2014share something morally appealing comes under\npressure.\n\nSecond, arguably even in the case of individuals not all\nrights-protected interests are of any moral value. For instance, the\nIraqi Penal Code of 1969 provides husbands the \u201clegal\nright\u201d to \u201cpunish\u201d their wives, to the exclusion of\ncrimes such as battery (such laws are, regretfully, not atypical;\nsimilar laws existed in the West for centuries). Even if such legal\nrights in some sense serve certain prudential or subjective interests\nof husbands, and assuming the Interest Theory were to incorporate such\ninterests and identify norms protective of such interests as\n\u201crights\u201d, it is not clear in what sense protecting such\ninterests makes rights\u2014qua rights\u2014morally\nattractive. And remember, a primary motivation for developing theories\nof the function of rights is ideally not to find just any uniting\nfeature of all \u201crights\u201d, but to identify one that is of\nvalue. For a related discussion on how the Interest Theory may\narguably incorporate odd and seemingly valueless interests, and even\nsubjective interests that are objectively bad for one, see Kramer\n(2001: 81\u201389). \n4.3 The Demand Theory\n\nFocusing on claim-rights, Joel Feinberg and Stephen Darwall are the\nmost prominent defenders of a third theory of the function of rights\nsometimes referred to as a \u201cdemand theory of\nrights\u201d\u2014emphasizing the capacity or power of right-holders\nto claim or demand. (Feinberg 1970; 1980: 130\u2013158; 1992: 155;\nDarwall 2006: 18\u201319; 2007: 60\u201365; 2010; 2011; see also\nSkorupski 2010: 310\u2013311; Gilbert 2018). Imagine a legal system\ncomprising just and reasonable duties to respect and safeguard others.\nYet, these duties are public duties not owed to those individuals that\nthey are designed to benefit. It is, therefore, a legal system of just\nduties without correlative rights (at least non held by individual\nbeneficiaries). Feinberg finds such law morally wanting. In a world\nwithout rights no one is legally owed justice, benevolence,\nor care, and, therefore, no one is in a position to claim or demand\njust treatment under the law. Accordingly, the unique moral function\nof legal rights for right-holders is not to secure them just treatment\nas such, but to provide them with claims for such treatment. Feinberg\nfinds this function morally precious, even in a world of benevolent\nand law-abiding people who act justly towards others regardless of\nwhether they owe it to them or not. For Feinberg, holding claims is\nintimately related to human dignity, as it engages people\u2019s\nagency and capacity to make claims and provides them with a sense of\nself-worth as creatures who are not only recipients of moral regard,\nbut are also owed it (Feinberg 1970: 252). \n5. Criticism: Rights\u2019 Disvalue to Right-Holders\n\nThe assumption that rights are inherently for right-holders has been\nchallenged. This entry only scratches the surface of this rich\ncritical terrain, which has much of its foundation in Karl\nMarx\u2019s 1844 essay \u201cOn the Jewish Question\u201d.\n\nMarx thought that legal rights at most provide right-holders with\nformal justice and civic emancipation, not with freedom from material\nneed or social and economic control. For Marx, moreover,\nsociety\u2019s primary legal and political institutions serve\neconomic production, with legal rights functioning as a primary\nmechanism for the facilitation and enforcement of a social structure\nthat prizes not the interests, agency, welfare, or dignity of\nright-holders but rather economic growth and the interests of the\neconomically powerful (see Waldron 1987b: 126\u2013127). Thus,\nrights\u2019 liberal fa\u00e7ade is deceptive, concealing\nrights\u2019 role in economic exploitation and social control (see,\ne.g., J. Cohen 1983). \n\nThis line of criticism can, however, go too far. Firstly, civil\nliberties do benefit right-holders, to some degree. Moreover, even if\nimperfect, rights (certainly in their more modern manifestations) can\nand do provide a measure of social and economic freedoms,\nentitlements, and justice (Waldron 1987c: 156\u2013159), and have\noccasionally facilitated social change and progressive politics. \n\nA second influential Marxist critique is that legal rights promote\negoism and social atomism. A criticism that also echoes in\n communitarian\n and\n conservative\n traditions in political theory. In a nutshell, by ordering\npeople\u2019s relations based on directed claims, duties, and powers,\nrights distance and separate people, promote conflict and competition,\ninvite antisocial behavior, structure relationships based on economic\nroles, and foster selfish and self-absorbed practices and unvirtuous\ncharacter. All at the cost of interpersonal relationships, social\nsolidarity, duties to one\u2019s community, acceptance of\nresponsibilities, a sense of belonging, and ties of fraternity and\ncommunity. (Marx 1844 [1987: 140\u2013142, 146\u2013147]; Taylor\n1985: 187\u2013210; Gutmann 1985; Waldron 1987b: 128\u2013129;\n1987c: 188). \n\nIn response, the protections, liberty, and empowerment that rights\nprovide become crucial to right-holders exactly when social and\ninterpersonal ties and solidarity break down, or turn discriminatory,\nor oppressively collectivist, or predatorial (Waldron 1987c:\n189\u2013190; Waldron 1993: 370\u2013391). Rights in this respect do\nnot derail community as such, but rather partake in forming\ncommunities that are morally legitimate (Finnis 2011: 210\u2013218;\nJones 1994: 209\u2013211). \n6. Legal Rights in Legal Justification and Reasoning: Outcomes and Reasons\n\nRights figure in legal reasoning in two very different ways. At times,\nlegal rights are part of legal justification and reasoning,\nfunctioning as legal reasons in favor of a certain legal holding or\nrule. In other instances, legal rights are themselves the outcome or\nthe \u201cbottom line\u201d of legal reasoning, embodying a legal\nholding or a rule justified by reasons other than the right itself.\n\n\nConsider the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Finnis\n2011: 210\u2013213). Some of the Declaration\u2019s articles secure\nall persons with certain rights (e.g., to liberty, life, own\nproperty), yet those rights are subject to limitations given\nconflicting values, such as for the purpose of securing the rights of\nothers, general welfare, and public order (Article 29 [2]).\nAccordingly, such rights appear set up as reasons in favor of certain\nlegal positions, to be assessed against other competing\nconsiderations. In contrast, other articles of the Declaration state\nrights as prohibitions, such as in terms of \u201cno one shall be\nsubject to\u201d, for example, torture or servitude, or \u201cno one\nshall be deprived of\u201d, for example, property or liberty. Some of\nthese prohibitions are qualified, while others are not. Regardless,\nwhere applicable, these articles provide rights that appear\nconclusory.\n\nA right can figure both as outcome and a reason, even in the same\nlegal decision or legal context. As such, rights can seem\n\u201cintermediate conclusions\u201d (Raz 1986: 181). As\n\u201coutcomes\u201d, rights are legal norms resulting from or\njustified by the intersection or counter-weighting of different\nreasons. Yet, under this view, such outcomes are not legal bottom\nlines but rather \u201cintermediate\u201d outcomes, which are\nthemselves reasons for legal duties or other legal positions. For\ninstance, a judge may hold that a litigant\u2019s interest in \u03c6\njustifies her right to \u03c6, and then further deliberate whether or\nnot to give effect to that right by imposing a remedial duty grounded\nin one\u2019s right to \u03c6. \n7. Legal Rights as Outcomes\n\nLegal rights are often expressions of conclusions of law (Hart 1953:\n15\u201317). For instance, civil rights are regularly treated as\narticulations of the parameters of government power as it relates to\nthe liberties of individuals; parameters set by legal officials,\nideally based on assessing the various relevant considerations. Once\nsaid assessment is completed, officials such as judges pronounce their\nruling in terms of the parties\u2019 \u201crights\u201d.\n\u201cRight as outcome\u201d is comfortable within the Hohfeldian\npicture of rights. Because if rights embody legal relations, they\narguably entail correlatives as a conceptual matter, relying on other\nreasons for the matter of their justification (Halpin 1997:\n31\u201332). \n\nFor example, the American Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) involved a national\nnonprofit organization which limited full membership to males aged\n18\u201334. This appeared in friction with the State of\nMinnesota\u2019s Human Rights Act on account of\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. The U.S. Supreme Court framed the\nlegal matter as \n\n\na conflict between a State\u2019s efforts to eliminate gender-based\ndiscrimination against its citizens and the constitutional freedom of\nassociation. (612) \n\n\nRuling against United States Jaycees, the court held that the\norganization\u2019s rights under the First Amendment did not\nextend to its discriminatory practice, reasoning that the\norganization\u2019s interests in freedom of association were\noutweighed by the State\u2019s interest. Another example involves\ncourts bestowing legal status. Court may appoint individuals to\nvarious roles, such as guardian, trustee, receiver, or executive of an\nestate. These appointments, along with the powers, liberties, claims,\nand immunities attached to them, are legal rights granted not on the\ngrounds of the rights themselves, but as the conclusion of judicial\ndeliberation involving other reasons.\n\nNotice that even when legal rights are indeed outcomes, the same is\nnot necessarily true of the valuable functions such rights\nwould serve\n (Section 4).\n For instance, the relevant interests that a right\u2014if\nrecognized\u2014would further and protect for the right-holder, can\nand do play a role in the justification and in determining the scope\nof that right. In fact, very often it is the interests or dignity of\nthe parties to a legal dispute that guides courts in reaching a\nruling; which is then expressed in terms of the scope of the\nparties\u2019 relevant legal \u201crights\u201d.\n\nA virtue of \u201cright as outcome\u201d is that once the scope of a\nright is determined, from that point on that right can serve as a\nmarker of the balance of the potentially complex legal reasoning\nunderlying it; thereby providing legal guidance and certainty as to\nwhat people can roughly expect as a matter of right, and avoiding the\nneed for repetitive ad hoc decision-making in subsequent\nsimilar cases. \n\nJurisprudentially, \u201cright as outcome\u201d is hospitable to\nskeptics of legal formalism. In a nutshell, formalism is the view that\nlegal determinations are governed by a logic internal to law itself,\nwithout referencing or relying on extra-legal reasons or\nconsiderations (for example moral, social, ideological, or\nself-interested). A criticism of formalism typical to \u201clegal\nrealists\u201d, is that the canons of legal interpretations and the\nlanguage and categories of the law\u2014such as\n\u201crights\u201d\u2014cannot fully determine law\u2019s edicts.\nIn reality, the criticism continues, extra-legal forces and reasons\nare often (if not always) explicitly or implicitly incorporated into\ndeterminations of what the law is (see Leiter 2005: 50\u201353). The\nmore skeptical one is of the notion of legal reasons, the more likely\nit is that one would view \u201clegal rights\u201d as empty\nformalistic rhetoric and less as genuine reasons for legal\ndeterminations (e.g., F. S. Cohen 1935). As such, it makes sense to\ntransform law\u2019s language of \u201crights\u201d into mere\nlegalistic expression of the culmination of the extra-legal\nconsiderations determinative of what law is and what it ought to\nbe.\n\nNormatively, over the centuries many have thought of legal rights as\n(at least ideally) reflective of natural rights, that is of moral\nrights not depended on enforcement or social convention, or\nrecognition; a view rooted in the\n natural law\n tradition. Legal rights are also often associated with\n deontological\n principles, eschewing considerations of utility and policy. \n\nThe more dominant such views on the content of legal rights, the more\nlikely are those dismissive of natural rights and deontology to grow\nhostile to treating legal rights as reasons. Accordingly, given the\ninfluence (especially over the past 150 years) of approaches to\npolitical morality based on consequentialist considerations of\nutility, public policy, or the common good, it is not surprising to\nfind occasions of legal rights relegated from weighty legal reasons to\nmere vessels for the legalistic expression of underlying public\npolicy. A key philosophical figure in this regard was Jeremy Bentham\n(1843b: 490\u2013534; see Hart 1962: 311\u2013314; Edmundson 2004:\n51\u201359). Bentham advocated the view that law ought to promote\ngood social consequences, as opposed to reflecting what he viewed as\nvague, dogmatic, antiquated, and moralistic notions of natural rights,\nfamously branding the transplanting of natural rights into law as a\nform of \u201cmischievous nonsense\u201d (Bentham 1843b: 501). \n8. Legal Rights as Reasons\n\nAs explained, rights often figure in law as legal reasons in favor of\ncertain legal holdings and rules (including other legal rights). Most\nobviously, legal officials incorporate legal rights in their\ndeliberations as to what the law is in a particular case. As such,\nunder the view of \u201cright as reason\u201d, legal rights are not\nthe outcomes of legal deliberation on what the law is, but rather are\namong the legal reasons for such outcomes. Take for example the case\nof Gannett Co. v. DePasquale (1979). Weighing the First\nAmendment right to freedom of the press against considerations of\nthe common good and defendants\u2019 rights to a fair trial, the\ncourt held that:\n\n\n[t]he right of access to courtroom proceedings, of course, is not\nabsolute. It is limited both by the constitutional right of defendants\nto a fair trial \u2026 and by the needs of government to obtain just\nconvictions and to preserve the confidentiality of sensitive\ninformation and the identity of informants. (398) \n\n8.1 Legal Rights as Preemptory Reasons\n\nRights are preemptory. A preemptory reason to \u03c6 is reason to block\nconsidering or acting on certain other reasons pertaining as to\nwhether or not to \u03c6 (Hart 1982: 86, 253\u2013254). Rights,\ntherefore, enjoy a measure of qualitative precedence over certain\nother reasons, which is why rights are reasons that, in a sense,\n\u201cpunch\u201d above their normative weight (see, e.g., Nozick\n1974: 171\u2013173). That is, when in conflict with other even\nweightier reasons, rights can still prevail\u2014not by\nquantitatively outweighing those competing reasons but by\nqualitatively preempting them. Indeed, it is not uncommon that an\ninfringement of a legal right is impermissible even if in furtherance\nof the overall good or utility (Dworkin 1977: 190\u2013192; Lyons\n1982: 113\u2013118). \n\nTrying to capture the preemptory quality of rights, Dworkin borrows a\nmetaphor from the game of bridge (and other card games), referring to\nrights as \u201ctrumps\u201d (Dworkin 1984: 153\u2013167). In\nbridge, a card that is a member of the \u201ctrump suit\u201d\ndefeats cards not in the suit, regardless of the cards\u2019\nnumerical values. Similarly, rights override conflicting reasons as a\nmatter of category, regardless of the relative normative weight or\nstrength of those other reasons. \n\nAnother prism for capturing the preemptory quality of rights are\n\u201cexclusionary reasons\u201d (Raz 1975 [1999: 35\u201348]. An\nexclusionary reason counts in favor of refraining from acting on\nanother reason. Viewed in these terms, the preemptory nature of rights\nis explained not in terms of the weight or force of rights, but in\nterms of rights\u2019 exclusionary nature (Kamm 2002: 488). Under\nthis view, a right to \u03c6 is not only reason to \u03c6 but also\nreason to exclude and not to act on or rule based on at least certain\nreasons not to \u03c6\u2014even if the relative weight of those\nconflicting reasons is greater than that of the reasons counting in\nfavor of \u03c6-ing. \n8.2 The Stringency of Rights: Absolute or Defeasible?\n\nIf legal rights are indeed legal reasons, are they absolute or\ndefeasible? A legal right is inviolable or absolute if, as a matter of\nlaw, it preempts or otherwise overcomes all possible\nconflicting legal reasons. \n\nIn principle, legal rights\u2019 preemptory force can be absolute. An\nexample from international law is the human right against torture\nenshrined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, proclaiming that \u201c[n]o one shall be subjected\nto torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\npunishment\u201d. Another example is Justice Hugo Black\u2019s\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence. The Amendment\nstates:\n\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of\nspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to\nassemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n\n\nAccording to Justice Black,\n\n\n\u201cno law \u2026 abridging\u201d means no law\nabridging \u2026 The First Amendment, which is the\nsupreme law of the land, has thus fixed its own value on freedom of\nspeech and press by putting these freedoms wholly \u201cbeyond the\nreach\u201d of federal power to abridge \u2026 Consequently\n\u2026 I do not believe that any federal agencies, including\nCongress and this Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech\nand press to what they think are \u201cmore important\ninterests\u201d. (Smith v. United States [1959],\n157\u2013158) \n\n\nThe view that rights are absolute is often associated with\nDworkin\u2019s metaphor of \u201crights as trumps\u201d. Yet, while\nDworkin was of the view that rights trump certain utilitarian concerns\nas well as considerations that are illegitimate in public policy (such\nas racism) (1984; 1986: 388), he did not argue for the absolutist\nposition (Dworkin 1977: 93, 190\u2013191; see Waldron 2000). Focusing\nnot on legal but on moral rights, Nozick comes close to rights\nabsolutism, yet even he may have had some doubts (Nozick 1974:\n28\u201333; see Thomson 1977 [1986: 55\u201365]). \n\nIn fact, preemptoriness does not necessarily entail absoluteness. And\nwhile there are, arguably, some absolute rights (see Gewirth 1981),\nsuch rights are not easy to come by in law or in morality (Feinberg\n1973: 79\u201383, 94\u201397). Perhaps this is because when\nconfronted with extreme cases, or with great human need, or with\nconflicting weighty rights, or with overwhelming public concerns,\nabsolutism is morally implausible. Moreover, were legal rights\nabsolute, the law would run the risk of becoming mired in intractable\ncontradictions between various conflicting yet absolute rights. \n\nThat said, one path towards turning absolutism more plausible begins\nwith noticing that absoluteness does not denote scope (Feinberg 1973:\n80\u201383; Dworkin 1977: 261; Schauer 1979: 903\u2013905; Gewirth\n1981: 3\u20134). Accordingly, if construed more narrowly in scope, or\nif oriented towards narrow core cases, or if tempered through\nexceptions, legal rights can sidestep clashes with other legal rights\nand with highly weighty conflicting moral considerations, thereby\nkeeping their absoluteness while avoiding moral implausibility and\nlegal intractability. \n\nYet, under such an approach much of what determines what the law is\nare considerations not of right but of the parameters of rights,\nshrinking the role of legal rights as legal reasons and pushing them\ncloser to \u201cright as outcome\u201d. Moreover, a legal system of\nabsolute rights of a narrow scope would likely entail highly\nconvoluted rights, rife with numerous exceptions and qualifications to\nthe point of impracticality. In fact, constructing a working\nfrictionless system of absolute legal rights that are harmonious with\neach other as well as with any other weighty consideration, is\npractically impossible. \n\nAccordingly, rights\u2019 preemptory quality is likely more\naccurately described not in terms of \u201ctrumping\u201d but as\nsetting normative \u201cthresholds\u201d\u2014excluding many, yet\nrarely all possible conflicting considerations (Lyons 1994: 152;\nGriffin 2008: 76). Thus, legal rights are mostly\ndefeasible\u2014certainly in principle and at times also in actual\nlegal practice (Jones 1994: 50\u201356; Wellman 1995: 251\u2013255).\n\n\n\u201cStringency\u201d stands for the extent of a right\u2019s\nperemptoriness. For instance, an absolute right is infinitely\nstringent (Thomson 1977 [1986: 55]). A right\u2019s stringency is a\nfunction of the scope of conflicting reasons that the right trumps or\nexcludes, and of how demanding are the duties grounded in the right\n(Kamm 2002: 489).\n\nThe type of reasons that rights can clash with are varied, and can\ninclude reasons such as other rights, justice, and welfare (for a\ndiscussion in the context of moral human rights see Griffith 2008:\n58\u201366). \n\nIn law, rights vary in stringency. The most stringent legal rights are\ntypically those rights the law deems \u201cfundamental\u201d or\n\u201ccore\u201d, or rights protective of particularly significant\ninterests or values. These regularly include\n civil\n and\n human rights.\n The extent of a right\u2019s stringency and the legal doctrines for\ndetermining it are matters of normative jurisprudence, political and\nconstitutional theory, and judicial practice. The same is true of the\nweight of rights, discussed in the section below. Common\nconsiderations relevant to such assessments include the ingredients of\nthe legal right\u2019s moral justification, background social and\npolitical values and commitments, expediency, and institutional\nconsiderations. \n8.3 Legal Rights as Straightforward (Non-Preemptory) Reasons\n\nA right to \u03c6 is not only preemptory of certain reasons not to\n\u03c6, but is in itself reason to \u03c6. Were this not the case, a\nright to \u03c6 would be wholly negative, excluding reasons against\n\u03c6 but not counting in its favor. For instance, one\u2019s right\nto privacy in one\u2019s home is not only reason not to act on\ncertain (even if weighty) reasons favoring invading people\u2019s\nhomes, but also a reason not to do so. This dual reason-giving nature\nof rights is captured in Dworkin\u2019s \u201ctrumping\u201d\nmetaphor. \n\nAccordingly, even if a right to \u03c6 is not sufficiently stringent to\nexclude certain conflicting reasons, it remains a (non-exclusionary)\nreason to \u03c6, to be straightforwardly weighed along with other\nrelevant reasons that the right does not trump. Moreover, the outcomes\nof such weighing can involve compromises and partial consideration of\nthe different conflicting reasons (Aleinikoff 1987: 946).\n\nIt is here where jurists sometimes get rights wrong. That a right is\nalso a straightforward reason to be balanced against other reasons on\nthe basis of their respective weight does not entail rights are wholly\nnon-preemptory. Treating rights only as straightforward reasons\ndistorts the primary role that rights occupy within practical and\nlegal reasoning\u2014that is, rights\u2019 preemptory quality. \n8.4 Rights as Reasons for Duties\n\nAt times, rights justify correlative duties (MacCormick 1977:\n199\u2013208; Dworkin 1977: 171; Raz 1986: 167; Feinberg 1992: 156).\nThat is, claim-rights are reasons for duties as well for excluding\nreasons against them. And, in the absence of countervailing reasons,\nrights justify such duties (Raz 1970: 226\u2013227; 1986: 171). Some\nargue that in duty-based normative systems (for example Jewish law,\nsee Cover 1987), the direction of the justification\u2014from right\nto duty\u2014can, in principle, run in reverse, that is from duty to\nright (Waldron 1990: 69\u201373; Kramer 1998: 37\u201339). In any\ncase, the normative priority of rights over duties may (Waldron 1984a:\n12; 1990: 84) or may not (Kramer 1998: 35\u201340; Simmonds 1998:\n158\u2013165) refute Hohfeldian correlativity. \n\nRelatedly, the same claim-right seemingly can count in favor of\ndifferent and changing duties, for instance given changes in factual\ncircumstances. For example, the right to education is a reason for\ndifferent duties in the twenty-first century than it counted in favor\nof in the nineteenth century. Moreover, in practice legal rights are\noften the instruments of legal change, justifying new previously\nunrecognized duties (Raz 1970: 225\u2013227; 1994: 269). This\ndynamism arguably cuts against the seemingly more frozen view of the\nnormative relation between rights and duties implied by Hohfeldian\ncorrelativity (Raz 1970: 226; 1986: 185\u2013186). In addition,\nright-dynamism undercuts the Hohfeldian notion that what individuates\nany specific claim-right is the content of its specific correlative\nduty. Among possible responses on behalf of Hohfeldians is that so\ncalled \u201cdynamic rights\u201d are in fact only inchoate rights\n(Kramer 1998: 41\u201348). \n8.5 Conflicts of Rights\n\nAs reasons, rights can conflict within practical reasoning (Wellman\n1995: 202\u2013203). The paradigm of a conflict of rights involves\nincompatible claims (Waldron 1993: 206; Kamm 2002: 499\u2013500).\nMoreover, rights can conflict when the practical conditions for their\napplication are incompatible (Wellman 1995: 200\u2013202). Thus,\nWellman contends that \u201ctwo rights conflict when both cannot be\nexercised and enjoyed fully in any given situation\u201d (1995: 202).\n\n\nA helpful distinction in this context is between \u201cabstract\nrights\u201d, which are rights expressing broad aims, and\n\u201cconcrete rights\u201d, which are specific as to their\napplication to concrete cases (Dworkin 1977: 93\u201394). At high\nlevels of abstraction, it is largely unproblematic that legal rights\nare at least seemingly incompatible; as such rights tend to imply\nrather vague and not fully determined demands (Feinberg 1973: 71). For\nexample, although people\u2019s right to freedom can appear to\nconflict with others\u2019 right to equality, these two rights can\nco-exist relatively peaceably in the same legal system. It is when\nmaking more concrete prescriptions that conflicts of legal rights pose\nmore of a challenge (Feinberg 1973: 69, 72). While the distinction\nbetween \u201cabstract\u201d and \u201cconcrete\u201d is a matter\nof degree, a clear case of conflicting concrete rights is of two legal\nrights for the exclusive possession of the same item at the same time.\n\n\nConflicts of rights are sometime dissolved by redrawing the scope of\nthe conflicting rights so as to avoid overlap (Feinberg 1973:\n72\u201373; Wellman 1995: 202\u2013210). Yet, law and morality can\nat times resist such harmonizing via adjustment in scope (Wellman\n1995: 211\u2013215). \n\nTo resolve these conflicts, law can designate a hierarchy or priority\namong types of rights\u2014so that some rights, at least under\ncertain conditions, preempt others (Feinberg 1973: 76\u201379;\nWellman 1995: 215). For example, in Marsh v Alabama (1945)\nthe U.S. Supreme Court held that:\n\n\nWhen we balance the Constitutional rights of owners of property\nagainst those of the people to enjoy freedom of press and religion, as\nwe must here, we remain mindful of the fact that the latter occupy a\npreferred position \u2026 As we have stated before, the right to\nexercise the liberties safeguarded by the First Amendment\n\u201clies at the foundation of free government by free men\u201d,\nand we must in all cases \u201cweigh the circumstances and \u2026\nappraise the \u2026 reasons \u2026 in support of the regulation of\n(those) rights\u201d. (509)\n\n\nWhen no such hierarchy obtains, conflicts are resolvable through some\nform of balancing of the rights\u2019 respective normative weight or\nforce. For instance, Thomson suggests balancing the interests\nprotected by the competing rights (Thomson 1990: 149\u2013175).\nRelatedly, Waldron suggests that when conflicting rights promote\nrelated interests, the right that best promotes that type of interest\nought to prevail (Waldron 1993: 222\u2013223). In fact, courts often\nresolve conflicts of rights by balancing the respective interests that\nthose rights protect as well as each rights\u2019 other respective\njustifying reasons (Wellman 1995: 209\u2013210). Critical of both\nThomson and Waldron, Kamm offers tests of her own for settling\nconflicts of rights (2001: 251\u2013255; 2002: 500\u2013506; 2007:\n263\u2013272), as does Gewirth (1978).\n8.6 Violated and Infringed Legal Rights as Reasons\n\nEven if infringed, rights remain reasons. To understand how, it is\nhelpful to distinguish between \u201cinfringing\u201d on a right and\n\u201cviolating\u201d it. X\u2019s right that Y \u03c6\nis infringed on if Y fails to \u03c6; yet an\ninfringement is not necessarily also a violation. As Judith Jarvis\nThomson clarifies, X\u2019s right is violated if and only if\nit is infringed wrongfully (Gewirth 1981: 2; Thomson 1977\n[1986: 51\u201352]; 1990: 122). Accordingly, if a right is\noverridden (preempted or outweighed) by competing reasons, it\nfollows that acting against that right is permissible, or justifiable,\nor even required. That right is, therefore, infringed on, yet it is\nnot violated (Gewirth 1981: 2; Thomson 1977 [1986: 50\u201352];\nThomson 1990: 100\u2013104, 151\u2013166). \n\nViolated rights (or their underlying reasons) continue, in one way or\nanother, to project normative force, thereby still counting as legal\nreasons. This is prominently manifested in remedial rights and\ncorrelative remedial duties justified by the violation of other rights\n(see\n Section 10.4;\n Weinrib 1995: 133\u2013144; Raz 2004: 189\u2013193; Gardner 2011:\n28\u201337, 45\u201346; Ripstein 2016: 233\u2013262; Steel 2020).\nIt is, however, worth noting that violated rights do not always\nsucceed in grounding a remedy and can be overridden by other\nconsiderations in this regard. For example, in Newfoundland\nTreasury Board v. N.A.P.E. (2004) the Supreme Court of Canada\nfound that the defendant had violated the plaintiffs\u2019 Equality\nRights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by\npaying them less than their male colleagues. Yet, the Court affirmed\ngranting the plaintiffs only a partial and belated remedy due to the\ndire fiscal circumstances of the government employer. \n\nInterestingly, when overridden, infringed rights arguably also\ncontinue to project normative force, as a kind of residual legal\nreason. When a right is overridden, infringing on it is not wrongful,\nbut it is still in a sense a wrong to the right-holder. Infringed\noverridden rights are neither expunged nor normatively inert (for a\ndiscussion in the context of moral rights, see Jones 1994:\n195\u2013198); in fact, they can even justify legal outcomes, even if\nnot the outcome that they are a right for. A legal example is the\nclassic case of Vincent v. Lake Erie Transp.Co. (1910). One\nreading of the case is that although the defendant had a\n\u201cnecessity\u201d defense and, therefore, was justified in\ntrespassing on the plaintiff\u2019s land (thereby infringing\non his property rights), the defendant was still legally\nrequired\u2014on the grounds of the infringement\u2014to compensate\nthe plaintiff not for the trespass itself (i.e., the infringement) but\nfor the damages caused by the (legally justified) infringement\n(Thomson 1990: 103\u2013104).\n9. The Moral Justification of Legal Rights\n\nThe moral justification of a legal right is the justification of the\nnormative category detailed thus far: a preemptory\n (Section 8)\n or conclusory\n (Section 7)\n legal norm that has the form\n (Section 3)\n and function\n (Section 4)\n of \u201cright\u201d. The moral justification of legal rights is\nnot self-evident. A right\u2019s legal validity\n (Section 1)\n does not guaranty its moral justification. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to\ndeny that positive law can contain rights that are morally unjustified\n(Lyons 1982: 113; 1994: 154). There is a voluminous and diverse\nliterature on the moral justification of legal rights, and advocating\nwhat the normative content of legal rights ought to be. Mostly, these\ninvolve matters of political philosophy and normative jurisprudence,\nextending beyond the scope of this entry; yet, some issues cut closely\nto the elucidation of the concept of \u201clegal right\u201d itself,\nwarranting attention here.\n9.1 The Function of Rights and the Moral Justification of Legal Rights\n\nAccepting that rights typically further interests, or choice, or\nagency, or dignity of right-holders, and accepting that these\nfunctions are at least typically valuable in how they favor or entitle\nright-holders, are those values sufficient to justify the legal rights\nthat realize and further them? \n\nAt least sometimes they are. Plausible examples are the legal rights\nto life, bodily integrity, autonomy, and freedom, which are arguably\ngrounded in those values to right-holders (Raz 1994: 48\u201349). The\nsame seems true of certain social rights, such as the right to\nadequate healthcare or to minimum wage. In fact, often the moral value\nof a right vis-\u00e0-vis the right-holder justifies the\nright, even when in conflict with the interests of others or with the\ncommon good. \n\nYet, this is not always the case. First, as intimated above\n (Section 5.2),\n even if rights always in some sense entitle or are in some way for\nright-holders, it does not necessarily follow that this value to\nright-holders has any intrinsic justificatory force in favor of the\nright (even if it often does). For instance, groups, corporations, or\nindividuals in their capacity as public officials have a will and\ninterests, as well as hold-rights protective of them. Yet, such will\nor interests are not of intrinsic moral value and, therefore, do not\nhave intrinsic justificatory force in favor of their protection.\nMoreover, arguably legal rights can protect right-holders\u2019\nimmoral interests. Such as, for example, the self-serving interests of\npredatory slumlords, sometimes protected by legal property rights.\nTherefore, if justified, the moral justification of such legal rights\nmust derive from reasons other than the (amoral or immoral) interests\nthat those rights protect (Raz 1995: 31\u201332). \n\nSecond, even in the common case wherein the function of a legal right\nvis-\u00e0-vis the right-holder does indeed morally count\nin favor of the law adopting that right, at times there is a\njustificatory gap between the value of that function and the\nright\u2019s justification. Here the contribution of the\nright\u2019s function to the right\u2019s justification is, on its\nown, insufficient, suggesting that if morally justified, it is by\nreasons not exclusive to the value of the right\u2019s function (Raz\n1994: 48\u201349). Surprisingly, a common misstep in the discourse on\nthe justification of rights is confusing interest with right. As if\nthe mere demonstration that X has a weighty interest in \u03c6\ndirectly entails X morally ought to have a legal right to\n\u03c6. Yet, the fact is that X\u2019s interest in \u03c6\nperhaps counts in favor of X holding a legal right protective\nof that interest, but it does not necessarily justify it and it is\ncertainly not its equivalent. \n\nSuch justificatory gaps are often bridged by reasons of the common\ngood (or public interest) or the interests of other individuals\ncounting in favor of X holding a certain legal right (Raz 1994:\n49\u201355; 1995: 33\u201334; Harel 1994: 704\u2013714). Examples\nare plentiful. For instance, arguably parents\u2019 rights for tax\nbreaks and welfare benefits are predicated not only on the interests\nof the parents\u2019 themselves (the right-holders) in the means to\ncare for their children, but also on the interests of the children and\non the public\u2019s interest in the fulfillment of these parental\ninterests. The same is true of patent law, wherein intellectual\nproperty is granted not only on the grounds of innovators\u2019\ninterests in controlling their inventions and in enjoying their\nproceeds, but perhaps more so to incentivize future innovators and\ninvestors by the means of satisfying those interests, thereby serving\nthe overall social interest in innovation. The same form of argument\nis likely applicable, for example, to other types of property rights\n(Raz 1995: 33\u201334) as well as to corporate rights (Raz 1986: 179;\n1994: 275). Even the right to free speech finds much of its\njustification in its contribution to the common good (e.g., promoting\ncritical thought, bolstering democracy, enriching public discourse,\npromoting innovation) or to the interest of third parties (such as\n\u201clisteners\u201d), the moral significance of which often\ngreatly exceeds any benefits that most individual right-holders derive\n(at least directly) from the protections their free-speech rights\nafford them (Raz 1986: 178\u2013179; 1994: 54\u201355; Harel 1994:\n704\u2013714; 1998; 2005: 196).\n9.2 Legal Rights and the Common Good (or Public Interest) \n\nRights and the common good are often considered antagonistic (Lyons\n1982; 1994: 147\u2013176; Kamm 2002: 489\u2013497; for a discussion,\nsee Jones 1994: 50\u201361). For example, characterizing rights as\n\u201cdeontological side-constraints\u201d on the promotion of the\ncommon good (Nozick 1974: 28\u201335); or, the view that rights vest\nwhen collective goals are insufficient to justify depriving or harming\nan individual person (Dworkin 1977: xi, 91, 190\u2013192, 269; 1984:\n153). \n\nMore specifically to legal rights, something in the individualistic\nspirit of views such as those of Nozick and Dworkin rings true. Legal\nrights certainly can function as bastions of individual\nright-holders\u2019 interests, agency, dignity, autonomy, control,\nand liberty even in the face of utilitarian ideals or, more generally,\nthe common good (Lyons 1982; 1994: 147\u2013176). In contrast, at\ntimes the common good is found to override certain individuals\u2019\nlegal rights (Wellman 1995: 251\u2013255). Nowhere is this tension\nmore apparent than in the case of constitutional or\n\u201cfundamental\u201d rights, which are often couched in terms of\nlimitations on state power over individual citizens. Yet, this tension\nalso manifests in more mundane clashes, such as in the case of\nwasteful and inefficient use of personal property, which is often\nprotected by the legal right to property (Lyons 1982: 115\u2013118).\n\n\nIs this individualism, which is typical of legal rights, compatible\nwith the view that the moral grounds of legal rights can and arguably\noften do include reasons of the common good (see\n Section 9.1)?\n Arguably yes. \n\nFirstly, taken in aggregate, certain legal rights provide for the\nvarious aspects of individuals\u2019 well-being; and, if such rights\nare enjoyed by all\u2014securing people\u2019s dignity, liberty,\nwelfare etc., then rights thereby secure a significant measure of the\ncommon good (Finnis 2011: 2010\u2013218). \n\nSecondly, some legal rights are group rights, ideally furthering the\nindividual interests of the members of the group as members of the\ngroup (Raz 1986: 207\u2013209). Such rights can, therefore, align\nwith the common good (so long as all relevant parties are members of\nthe group). Examples include cultural and language rights and\npeoples\u2019 right to self-determination (e.g., Margalit & Raz\n1990). \n\nThirdly, even if a norm is justified by the common good, the practice\nand application of that norm arguably must be guided by the content of\nthe norm alone, not by its justification (see, e.g., Berkeley 1712:\nsec. 31; Rawls 1955). When someone \u201cstands on\u201d his or her\nlegal rights, it is invariably under conditions of conflict with the\nclaims or interests of others or with the common good. Accordingly, at\nleast at the level of legal practice and in particular cases, rights\nand the common good are indeed sometimes antagonistic (Lyons 1982).\nYet, from this it does not follow that at the level of their moral\njustification legal rights are necessarily or even typically\ninhospitable to or incompatible with the common good. Clearly if a\nlegal right is in conflict with the common good, and if that right\nprevails as a matter of law, the common good suffers. Nevertheless,\nsuch an outcome in a specific case is not necessarily averse to the\ncommon good when viewed from the broader perspective of the\nrule\u2019s justification (Sumner 2006: 192\u2013195). It is often\nin the common good for law to grant certain rights to individuals;\nrights that, on occasion and in specific cases, setback the common\ngood in favor of individual right-holders (e.g., Greenawalt 1982).\nMill, for instance, arguably advocated such a view of legal rights\n(Sumner 2006: 189\u2013192, 195\u2013197):\n\n\n[to] have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which\nsociety ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes\non to ask, why it ought? I can give him no other reason than general\nutility. (Mill 1863: Ch. 5. Par. 25) \n\n\nMany rights of criminal procedure, to give just one example, exhibit\nthis justificatory structure. Such as the rights to legal\nrepresentation and against unlawful search and seizure, which can\nshackle the criminal justice system, sometimes resulting in less\neffective law enforcement. And still, on balance, right-based\nlimitations on the coercive and punitive branches of government are\nwidely recognized as in the common good. \n9.3 Moral Rights and the Justification of Legal Rights\n\nThe justificatory relation between moral and legal rights is complex.\nSome legal rights arguably find at least some of their moral\njustification in certain moral rights. In fact, arguably there is\nsomething about moral rights that counts in favor of their practical\nimplementation and enforcement, such as through law (Hart 1955:\n177\u2013178). For instance, at times legal rights approximate their\nputative moral counterparts, functioning as moral rights roughly\nrecognized in law. For example, the content of legal rights to life or\nliberty arguably partially mirrors moral rights for the same values.\nIn fact, human rights law is often considered to give legal\nrecognition and even to roughly mirror moral human rights. When this\nis the case, arguably part of what justifies such legal rights are\ntheir moral counterparts. That said, given the complexity and\ncontingency of systems of positive law, there is perhaps something\nsimplistic in the mirroring view of how legal rights are justified by\nmoral rights (for a critical evaluation see Buchanan 2013; Buchanan\n& Sreenivasan 2018; Tomalty 2016). \n\nMoral rights can also lend moral justification to legal rights less\nstraightforwardly. For instance, a legal right to \u03c6 may protect\nand further adherence to a (or several different) moral right(s) to\nsomething else altogether. For example, the legal right to due process\nof law or the legal right to vote arguably draw some of their\njustification from their role as a means for the fulfillment of a\nvariety of moral rights, such as, for instance, the rights to dignity\nand liberty. \n\nNevertheless, arguably certain moral rights do not at all count in\nfavor of legal rights, be it in the form of a legal counterpart\n(Feinberg 1992: 156\u2013158, 161\u2013162; Brownlee 2012:\n125\u2013126; Buchanan & Sreenivasan 2018: 218\u2013219) or\nthrough some other type of legal right. For example, even assuming\ncertain cases of terminal illness involve holding a moral right\nagainst one\u2019s doctor to active euthanasia, it is not at all\nclear that such a right would justify a legal right to that effect,\neven if just for the unconscionability of enforcing such a right.\nMoreover, moral rights can count in favor and even justify legal\narrangements that do not take the form of any legal right (Waldron\n1999: 217\u2013219). For example, children may have a moral right to\nan education, yet plausibly the ideal way of assuring children obtain\nan education is by imposing a system of compulsory schooling. \n10. Features Salient to Legal Rights \n10.1 Institutional Rights\n\nMany of the features salient specifically to legal rights\narise from law being an institutional system of norms (Raz 1979:\n103\u2013121), largely oriented towards action-guiding and towards\naspects of human behavior that can be adjudicated (Raz 1994:\n255\u2013259). Ingrained in law, legal rights, therefore, tend to\nexhibit a practical orientation and institutional features less\ndominant in non-institutional rights, such as being subject to\n(in)validation, recognition, adjudication, legislation, enforcement,\nand inclusive of and nested in a rich network of procedures. \n\nLegal rights also exhibit features absent or more muted in rights\nfound in normative systems of non-legal institutions, such as social\nclubs, trade unions, or universities. Features derived from\nlaw\u2019s relative greater social importance; law\u2019s claim to\nsupremacy over other institutional normative systems under law\u2019s\njurisdiction; the far greater range of activities that can and\ntypically do fall under law\u2019s domain; law\u2019s\ncompulsoriness; and, law\u2019s commonly greater use of remedies,\nsanctions, and violence (Raz 1979: 115\u2013121; Sumner 1987:\n70\u201379). \n10.2 Procedural Rights\n\nThe division between law\u2019s substantive and procedural norms is\nfoundational. Broadly, procedural norms are norms bearing on the\nadministration of the engagement with other (mostly substantive)\nnorms. Given its institutional nature, law typically involves a slew\nof procedural norms. In legal systems respective of rights, procedural\nrights often control how (i.e., the procedure of) certain other norms\ncan or ought to be created, deliberated on, and applied in the case of\nthe right-holder. Examples include rights to a hearing, trial by jury,\nconfront witnesses, notice of accusation, receive reasons for official\ndecisions, finality, appeal, evidentiary rights, and many more. Not to\ndeny the existence of noninstitutional procedural moral rights (Enoch\n2018), although some have (C. H. Wellman 2015); yet, there is no\nnormative domain in which procedural rights are more central or\ndeveloped than law. \n10.3 Imperfect Rights\n\nEchoing Grotius\u2019s classic distinction regarding moral rights\n(see Darwall 2012: 306\u2013307), law distinguishes between\n\u201cperfect\u201d legal rights, which are enforceable, and\nimperfect legal rights, which are not (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n233). Although there are imperfect legal rights (e.g., unenforceable\ncontracts, certain immunities, and claims barred by lapse of time),\nthese are not the norm (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 233; Raz 1994:\n256). Law is primarily oriented towards practical application, and\nprobably for good reason. As such, typically legal rights are rights\nthat the law is willing and able to adjudicate and, if violated, to\nimpose remedies or sanctions for their violation. Thus, imperfect\nlegal rights seem to cut against the practical grain of law,\nexplaining why they are atypical. Imperfect moral rights are not\nsimilarly scarce.\n10.4 Remedial Rights and Rights of Action\n\nCharacteristic to legal rights and certainly of rights in private law,\nis a two-tiered system of interrelated norms\u2014primary and\nsecondary (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 100\u2013104; Paton 1972: 487).\nPrimary norms grant rights and impose correlative duties. Following\nlaw\u2019s ancient maxim that \u201cwhere there is a right, there is\na remedy\u201d (ubi jus, ibi remedium) (Blackstone\n1765\u20139: 23; Goldberg 2005: 531\u201359; Goldberg & Zipursky\n2020: 25\u201351, 82\u2013110), when a primary right is violated law\ntypically provides right-holders with a right to recourse (Stevens\n2011: 133\u2013134; Gardner 2019: 18\u201319) or, at the very least,\nwith a right of action to pursue recourse against the wrongdoer\n(Zipursky 1998; Smith 2012: 1727\u20131728; Goldberg & Zipursky\n2020: 98\u2013103).\n\nRemedies can take the form of enforcement of the violated (primary)\nright, either through self-help, policing, or a court order. Yet,\nenforcement is sometimes less favored, impossible, impractical,\ninequitable, or too costly. If so, law typically provides victims of\nrights violations with secondary rights, which are remedial rights\ngrounded in the violation of the primary right. Secondary rights are\ntypically for restitution of unjust gains or for compensation for the\nviolation of a primary right and for resulting deprivations and\nproximate losses. Secondary rights are normally accompanied or\npreceded by rights of action to pursue their enforcement through the\nmechanism of the state (Paton 1972: 487\u2013493). Importantly,\nremedial rights and rights of action against the party who violated a\nprimary right, and are typically held exclusively by the party who\nheld that right (Zipursky 1998: 4). \n\nThe intricacy of secondary and, more broadly, of remedial rights in\nthe law, far exceeds anything found in moral theory. Moreover, lacking\ninstitutions of adjudication and enforcement, morality does not\nobviously involve formalized straightforward rights of action to\npursue recourse for rights violation.",
