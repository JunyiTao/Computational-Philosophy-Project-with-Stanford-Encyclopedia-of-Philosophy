    "main_text": "Features Salient to Legal Rights || Procedural Rights\n10.2 Procedural Rights\n\nThe division between law\u2019s substantive and procedural norms is\nfoundational. Broadly, procedural norms are norms bearing on the\nadministration of the engagement with other (mostly substantive)\nnorms. Given its institutional nature, law typically involves a slew\nof procedural norms. In legal systems respective of rights, procedural\nrights often control how (i.e., the procedure of) certain other norms\ncan or ought to be created, deliberated on, and applied in the case of\nthe right-holder. Examples include rights to a hearing, trial by jury,\nconfront witnesses, notice of accusation, receive reasons for official\ndecisions, finality, appeal, evidentiary rights, and many more. Not to\ndeny the existence of noninstitutional procedural moral rights (Enoch\n2018), although some have (C. H. Wellman 2015); yet, there is no\nnormative domain in which procedural rights are more central or\ndeveloped than law. \n",
