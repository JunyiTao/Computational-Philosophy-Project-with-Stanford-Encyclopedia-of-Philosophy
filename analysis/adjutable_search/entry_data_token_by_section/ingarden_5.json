    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The Musical Work, The Picture, The Architectural Work\n3.2 The Musical Work, The Picture, The Architectural Work\n\n\nIn 1928, immediately after writing The Literary Work of\nArt, Ingarden expanded his analyses of the ontology of art from\nliterature, to also discuss music, painting, and architecture in a\nseries of essays originally intended as an appendix to The Literary\nWork of Art. As it happened, however, the appendix was not\npublished along with The Literary Work of Art, and remained\ndormant until after the war, when (in 1946) essays on the picture and\nthe architectural work were published in Polish. The three studies were\nexpanded and finally published in German in 1961, along with an article\non film, and were not translated into English until 1989. The late date\nof their release and the fact that they remain little known is a great\nshame, as they address many of the same ontological issues as those\ndebated in \u2018analytic\u2019 aesthetics, and provide not only\ncompelling arguments against many popular positions but also analyses\nof the ontological structure of works of various kinds unsurpassed in\nsubtlety and detail.\n\n\nThe first three essays of The Ontology of the Work of Art,\n\u201cThe Musical Work,\u201d \u201cThe Picture,\u201d and\n\u201cThe Architectural Work\u201d each attempt to determine the\nontological status of the work of art in question, its relation to\nconcrete entities such as copies of the score, sound events, painted\ncanvasses or buildings, as well as to creative acts of artists and the\nconscious states of viewers. Each also examines whether and to what\nextent the form of art in question, like the literary work, may turn\nout to have a stratified structure.\n\n\nThe musical work, Ingarden argues, is distinct from experiences of\nits composer and listeners, and cannot be identified with any\nindividual sound event, performance or copy of the score. But nor can\nit be classified among ideal entities, since it is created by a\ncomposer at a certain time, not merely discovered [Ontology,\n4\u20135]. It thus apparently falls between categories such as the\n\u2018real\u2019 and the \u2018ideal\u2019, and so accepting the\nexistence of musical works (like literary works) seems to require us to\naccept the existence of things in a category distinct from either of\nthose \u2014 that of purely intentional objects. The musical work is a\npurely intentional object with its \u2018source of being in the\ncreative acts of the composer and its ontic foundation in the\nscore\u2019 [Ontology, 91]. In itself, a traditionally scored\nwork of Western music is a schematic formation full of places of\nindeterminacy (e.g. it may be indeterminate exactly how loudly a note\nis to be played, or how long it should be held), which are filled out\ndifferently in various performances. Unlike the literary work, however,\nthe work of music is not a stratified entity, there being no essential\nrepresenting function of the sounds of the musical work (unlike the\nsounds of a novel).\n\n\nThe picture, too, is a purely intentional object, created by an\nartist and founded both in a real painting (a paint-covered canvas),\nand in the viewer\u2019s operations of apprehending it. The picture as a\nwork of art cannot be identified with the real paint-covered canvas\nhanging in a gallery, for the two have different properties and\ndifferent modes of cognitive accessibility. The picture can only be\nseen, and indeed only seen from certain points of view; the painting,\nby contrast, can be seen, smelled, heard, or even tasted, and can be\nobserved from any point of view. Ingarden also holds that the picture\nas such (unlike the painting) is not an individual object of any sort\n-- one and the same picture may be presented in many paintings (if they\nare all perfect copies of an original). (It might be worth noting that\nwhile this is plausible enough for the picture, considered as such, we\ndo typically treat works of visual art as one-off individual objects\n(distinct from perfect copies or forgeries).) Moreover, the picture, to\nbe seen, requires that viewers take up a certain cognitive attitude\nregarding it, not required to observe the painting.\n\n\n\u201cThe Architectural Work\u201d is perhaps the most interesting\nof the three major essays in the Ontology of the Work of Art,\nfor it suggests how Ingarden\u2019s examination of works of art may be\nbroadened out to form the framework for a general theory of social and\ncultural objects and their relations to the more basic physical objects\nposited by the natural sciences. The architectural work might seem to\npose the crucial objection to Ingarden\u2019s view that works of art are\n\u2018purely intentional objects\u2019 having at least a\nfoundation of their existence in the intentional states of their makers\nand viewers: \u201cAfter all, the Notre Dame of Paris appears to be no\nless real than the many residential buildings that stand in its\nvicinity, than the island upon which it was built, the river that flows\nnearby, and so on\u201d [255]. Nonetheless, even in this case,\nIngarden argues, the architectural work is not a mere independent\n\u2018real\u2019 object, although it is founded on one (the\n\u2018heap of stones\u2019 forming its physical basis). For its\nexistence as an architectural work requires not only its creation by an\narchitect (rather than its coming into existence as a mere natural\nformation), but also requires the \u2018reconstructive acts of the\nviewer\u2019 taking up a certain attitude towards the real object and\nhelping co-constitute its aesthetic and even its sensible properties.\nThe work of architecture is thus a doubly founded object, which\n\u201crefers back not only to the creative acts of the architect and\nthe reconstructive acts of the viewer, but also to its ontic foundation\nin a fully determined real thing shaped in a particular way\u201d\n[Ontology, 263].\n\n\n(The fact that even such purely intentional objects as works of art\nof various kinds are founded not exclusively in consciousness, but also\n(in various ways) on real spatio-temporal objects, is also an important\npart of Ingarden\u2019s arguments against idealism, suggesting that even if\nthe proper mode of being for the world of experience was\npurely intentional being, that still would not be sufficient to show\nthat all that exists is a pure product of consciousness.)\n\n\nThis situation for architecture parallels that for a great many of\nthe social and cultural objects of our everyday experience in what\nHusserl called the \u2018life-world\u2019. As Ingarden emphasizes, a\nflag, for example, should not be identified with the mere piece of\ncloth of which it is fashioned, for it has different essential\nproperties, and has an additional foundation in the mental acts of the\ncommunity that accept it as a flag and endow it with meanings and embed\nit in norms of action (e.g. we are not to clean pots with it but to use\nit in rendering military honors). Similarly, a church is not identical\nwith the real building on which it is founded, but rather is created\nonly through acts of consecration and the preservation of appropriate\nattitudes in the relevant community. In virtue of its secondary\ndependence on acts of consciousness, the church is endowed with various\n(social and cultural) properties and functions that a mere ordered heap\nof building materials cannot have. In this way Ingarden provides the\nbasis for an account of the nature of cultural and social objects that\ntakes neither the reductionist route of identifying them with their\nphysical bases, nor the subjectivist route of treating all objects as\nmere social constructions. The life-world takes its unique place as the\ncommon product of acts of consciousness and an independent real world,\nand its existence (in quite specific ways) presupposes that of both of\nthose foundations.\n",
