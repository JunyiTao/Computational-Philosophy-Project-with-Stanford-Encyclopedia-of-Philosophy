But the understanding of limits\nthemselves was originally thought to require a notion of\n\u201cinfinitesimally small\u201d distances. While these quantities\nwere considered problematic for several centuries, in recent decades\nsome mathematical entities with their properties have been rigorously\nstudied.\n3.4.1 Newton and Leibniz\n\nAn infinitesimal is a number smaller in absolute magnitude than any\npositive finite number, and yet not zero. Infinitesimals have had a\nchequered history. Early work in the calculus, as we have seen when\npresenting the structure of L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s 1696\ntreatise, was mostly based on a geometrical or kinematic (i.e. based\non motion) understanding of infinitesimals. Here we treat\ninfinitesimals arithmetically, i.e. within the context of the real\nnumber system, while conveying the key features of how the early\nanalysts made use of them. To figure out the slope of the function\n\\(f(x)=x^2\\) precisely at one point, one considered an\n\u201cinfinitesimally small number\u201d \\(\\epsilon\\) and considered\nthe slope of the straight line through \\(f(x)\\) and\n\\(f(x+\\epsilon)\\).\n\n\n\nTo find the slope of a function, one considers the slope of a straight\nline that intersects it at two \u201cinfinitesmally close\u201d\npoints.\n\n\nThis slope is equal to \\(\\frac{(x+\\epsilon)^2-x^2}{\\epsilon}\\). In\norder for this fraction to make sense, \\(\\epsilon\\) must be non-zero.\nHowever, we can calculate that this value is\n\\(\\frac{2x\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon}\\), or \\(2x+\\epsilon\\). At\nthis point, we no longer need \\(\\epsilon\\) to be non-zero, so the\nslope can be said to be just \\(2x\\). This sort of slippage between\nnon-zero and zero for these infinitesimals is what made Berkeley refer\nto them as \u201cthe ghosts of departed quantities\u201d. However,\nengineers, scientists and mathematicians who actually made use of the\ncalculus rested content in the knowledge that the calculus delivered\nthe goods.\n\nIn the 19th century, Cauchy, Bolzano, Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor\nsought to establish foundations for real analysis that gave no role to\ninfinitesimals: in what became the canonical account of the calculus,\nCantorian set theory and the \\(\\epsilon\\)-\\(\\delta\\) formalization of\nthe notion of a limit described in section\n 3.2\n allowed for a fully rigorous development of real analysis.\n\nInstead of taking particular infinitesimal values, one\nquantifies over values of real-valued variables\n\\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\). For example, the claim that the slope of\nthe squaring function at \\(x\\) is \\(2x\\) is interpreted as saying that\nfor any desired degree \\(\\epsilon\\) of approximation,\nthere is some finite \\(\\delta\\) such that for any \\(x'\\)\nwithin \\(\\delta\\) of \\(x\\), the slope of the line from \\((x,x^2)\\) to\n\\((x', x'^2)\\) approximates \\(2x\\) to within \\(\\epsilon\\). A single\ninfinitesimal is replaced by a relation involving two nested\nquantifiers. The process of elimination of infinitesimal quantities\nfrom the calculus was a central part of a larger process known as the\n\u201carithmetization of analysis\u201d, which aimed at removing\nkinematical and geometrical notions from the calculus in favour of\npurely arithmetical notions. (These are broadly construed to include\nthe arithmetic of real and complex numbers. For a recent account of\nthe history of real and complex analysis in the 19th century that also\npays attention to foundational issues see Gray (2015).)\n\nThis infinitesimal-free program accomplished its goals\nsuccessfully\u2014among its major accomplishments were the rigorous\ndefinition of a continuous function at a point and the definition of\nthe Riemann integral. However, one should keep in mind that other\nareas of mathematics, such as geometry, continued exploiting\ninfinitesimal considerations and studied extensively\nnon-Archimedean number systems. Archimedes\u2019 axiom\nstates:\n\n\ngiven any two areas, or two distances, or any two quantities of the\nsame sort, say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), it is possible to add \\(A\\) to itself\nfinitely many times so that the quantity obtained is greater than\n\\(B\\).\n\n\nNon-Archimedean systems are ones in which this axiom does not hold. If\nthe 17th century engagement with infinity, and Cantor\u2019s work in\nset theory, can be seen as revolutions, the study of non-Archimedean\nmathematics in the second half of the 19th century can be likened to\nan infinitary uprising.\n\nMany of the quantities considered in 17th century calculus, such as\nLeibnizian infinitesimals, do not obey the Archimedean axiom. An\ninfinitesimal can be added to itself any finite number of times but\nthe outcome of that process will never be greater than any finite\nquantity, however small. A pervasive historiographical tradition has\nargued that with the elimination of infinitely small quantities from\nthe calculus, non-Archimedean quantities were relegated to engineering\npractice for a long time. According to the standard account, it was\nonly in the 1960s that infinitesimals came back when Abraham Robinson\npresented his theory of non-standard analysis, which has received a\nlot of attention from philosophers and mathematicians (see section\n 3.4.2).\n Robinson\u2019s theory gave a legitimate mathematical status to\ninfinitely small and infinitely large quantities in the reconstruction\nof the infinitesimal calculus, now developed accordingly to rigorous\nmodel-theoretic techniques. For a long time, Robinson\u2019s work was\nhailed as the first successful effort to develop a system of\nnon-Archimedean quantities. But Philip Ehrlich, in a series of\nfundamental papers (including 1994, 2012), has argued that this\nwidespread perception needs serious questioning. Indeed, he has shown\nconvincingly that interest in non-Archimedean mathematics emerged in\nthe 1870s and continued to grow in the hands of mathematicians such as\nVeronese, du Bois-Reymond, Levi-Civita, Hahn, Stolz, Hardy, and\nothers.\n\nIt would be out of place in this entry to attempt even a small survey\nof the developments mentioned above. We simply refer to the reader to\nEhrlich (1994) and (2006). The interconnection with many important\nrelated issues such as Conway\u2019s surreal numbers (see section\n 3.4.3)\n and other alternative approaches to the construction of the real\nnumbers, such as smooth infinitesimal analysis mentioned at the end of\nsection\n 3.4.2,\n cannot be properly addressed here. See Salanskis and Sinaceur (1992),\nEhrlich (1994), Berger, Osswald, and Schuster (2001), and Ehrlich\n(2012).\n3.4.2 Non-standard analysis and infinitesimal analysis\n\nAs a result of the rigorous definitions in the calculus mentioned\nabove, from the mid-19th century most mathematicians working in\nanalysis abandoned infinitesimals. However, in the mid-20th century,\nRobinson (1966) showed that it is possible to give a rigorous\ndefinition of infinitesimals, and that infinitesimals can be used in a\nnon-standard development of real analysis (D. Laugwitz also did\nsimilar work around the same time, but Robinson\u2019s system has\nbeen more widely discussed). While he developed his non-standard\nanalysis using model theory, subsequent developments have also been\ngrounded in algebra and topology. Robinson\u2019s approach supplies\nan extended number system\u2014the hyperreal number\nsystem\u2014that contains the standard real number system, plus\nfurther \u2018infinitesimal\u2019 numbers whose absolute values are\ngreater than 0, but less than any positive standard real number.\nRobinson\u2019s construction of the hyperreals provides a set with\nthe same cardinality as the standard reals. Simple modifications of\nthe construction can create sets of hyperreals of larger\ncardinality.\n\nImportantly, due to the logical techniques used in its construction,\nRobinson\u2019s system behaves exactly like the standard finite real\nnumbers for any sentence expressible within the algebraic language of\naddition and multiplication. Thus, every number other than 0 has a\nmultiplicative inverse, and if \\(x > y\\), then \\(1/y > 1/x\\). In\nparticular, this means that if \\(\\epsilon\\) is a positive\ninfinitesimal number, then \\(1/\\epsilon\\) is an infinitely large\nnumber! Unlike Cantorian infinities of counting from section\n 3.3\n these infinitely large numbers are subject to subtraction and\ndivision as well as addition and multiplication, and unlike the\ninfinities of the extended real line from section\n 3.2,\n they behave just as nicely as the finite numbers with respect to\nthem. For instance, statements such as these hold of standard real\nnumbers as well as of the new infinitely small and infinitely large\nnumbers:\n\n\\(x+y=y+x\\) (commutativity of addition);\n\n\\(x\\cdot y=y\\cdot x\\) (commutativity of multiplication);\n\n\\(x(y+z)=xy+xz\\) (distributivity of multiplication over addition).\n\nIn fact, Robinson\u2019s hyperreals satisfy a \u201ctransfer\nprinciple\u201d\u2014if statements are formulated entirely within a\nfirst-order language for the reals, then they are true of the standard\nreals if and only if they are true for the hyperreals. So any proof of\nsuch a theorem in one system can be transferred to the other. This\nsometimes greatly simplifies calculations and proofs of theorems.\n\nConsider the limit of the quantity \\(((x+h)^3-x^3)/h\\) as \\(h\\)\napproaches 0. In the standard reals, to show that this is \\(3x^2\\), we\nneed to show that for every \\(\\epsilon\\) there is a \\(\\delta\\) such\nthat for any value of \\(h\\) less than \\(\\delta\\), the corresponding\nvalue of this function is less than \\(\\epsilon\\) away from \\(3x^2\\).\nIn this case, it turns out that choosing \\(\\delta < \\epsilon/4x\\)\nworks when \\(x\\) is sufficiently large, and choosing \\(\\delta <\n\\epsilon\\) works when \\(x\\) is sufficiently small, but figuring out\nthese choices is difficult.\n\nFor the hyperreals though, it is sufficient to show that this value is\ninfinitesimally close to \\(3x^2\\) whenever h is infinitesimal.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{(x+h)^3-x^3}{h} &= \\frac{x^3+3x^2h+3xh^2+h^3-x^3}{h} \\\\\n &= 3x^2+3xh+h^2, \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nand for any real \\(x\\), \\(3xh+h^2\\) is infinitesimal whenever \\(h\\) is\ninfinitesimal.) For any particular real \\(\\epsilon\\), this shows that\nthere is some hyperreal \\(\\delta\\) that works (namely, any\ninfinitesimal), and by the transfer principle we can conclude that for\nthis real \\(\\epsilon\\) there is some real \\(\\delta\\) that\nworks, and we no longer need to worry about the details of how to find\nit. Thus, we can validate the reasoning of Newton and Leibniz that\nallows them to treat infinitesimals as non-zero for calculations until\nwe get to the final result, and then treat them as zero at the end.\nThey really work like the \u201cghosts of departed quantities\u201d\nthat Berkeley satirized! (The extent to which Robinson\u2019s system\nis a vindication of Leibniz and Newton was the subject of extended\ndiscussion in articles by Robinson and others. See Bos (1974) for a\nclassic source of this debate.)\n\nFor results stated in a first-order logical language, the hyperreals\nand the standard reals satisfy the transfer principle. But for results\nabout sets, they behave differently. Every bounded set of\nstandard reals has a least upper bound. However, for instance, the set\nof infinitesimal hyperreals is bounded (every member is less than\n.00001, among other bounds), but there is no least upper\nbound (no infinitesimal is an upper bound for all of the others, and\nevery finitely large upper bound can be decreased by some\ninfinitesimal amount to give a smaller one). Edward Nelson (1977)\npioneered an alternative approach\u2014Internal Set Theory\u2014on\nwhich the basic language of mathematics is enriched in order to allow\nus to distinguish between standard and non-standard real numbers, as\nwell as \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d sets. On\nNelson\u2019s approach, infinitesimals are non-standard real numbers\nthat are smaller in absolute value than any positive standard real\nnumbers. \u201cInternal sets\u201d are those that can be defined in\nthe basic language, and they behave just the same as standard sets of\nstandard reals\u2014for instance, bounded internal sets always have a\nleast upper bound. But the set of all infinitesimals, just like the\nset of all standard real numbers, is an \u201cexternal set\u201d of\nthe theory that can\u2019t be defined within the language, and thus\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily have a least upper bound.\n\nThe approaches pioneered by Robinson and Nelson do not allow us to\nprove results about the standard real numbers that cannot be\nproved using standard real analysis. However, these approaches do\nprovide simpler\u2014and, in some sense, more intuitive\u2014proofs\nof many theorems of standard real analysis. (On the pedagogical\nbenefits of non-standard analysis, see, for example, Keisler (1976)).\nAnd there are cases of results in real analysis that were first proven\nusing non-standard real analysis (see, for example, Bernstein and\nRobinson (1966).) Moreover, these approaches clearly show that we do\nnot need to adopt the \\(\\epsilon\\)-\\(\\delta\\) formalization of the\nnotion of a limit in order to have access to a fully rigorous\ndevelopment of real analysis.\n\nThe literature on non-standard analysis is very rich. See Dauben\n(1995) for a biography of Robinson with special emphasis on\nnon-standard analysis. See also Goldblatt (1998) for a recent formal\nintroduction and Cutland, di Nasso, and Ross (2006) for recent\nmathematical developments. The reader is referred to the extensive\nbibliographies contained in those volumes for further references.\n\nAn interesting alternative to nonstandard analysis, which allows for a\ndevelopment of substantive parts of mathematics, goes under the name\nof (smooth) infinitesimal analysis. This differs from both\nordinary and nonstandard analysis by allowing nilpotent\ninfinitesimals, namely \u2018linelets\u2019 \\(dx\\) such that\n\\(dx\\neq 0\\) but \\(dx\\cdot dx = 0\\). The consistency of such a theory\nis proved using toposes in category theory. The best exposition of the\ntopic is Bell (1998b) (see also Bell 1988a, 2019); philosophical\naspects of the theory are discussed in Hellman and Shapiro (2018).\nArthur (2013) discusses infinitesimal analysis in connection to\nLeibniz and makes points similar to those made by Bos (1974) on\nLeibniz and non-standard analysis. Constructive interpretations of\nnon-standard analysis are developed in Salanskis (1999), which\nincludes discussions of Nelson\u2019s approach as well as the French\nschool of non-standard analysis (Reeb, Harthong). For further\ndiscussion of infinitesimals, see Davis (1977), Thomason (1982), Bell\n(2005), and the entry on\n continuity and infinitesimals.\n3.4.3 Surreal numbers\n\nDedekind showed how to fill the gaps between rational\nnumbers; Cantor showed how to extend (ordinal and cardinal) numbers\nbeyond the existing finite numbers. John Conway (1976)\nintegrated both ideas. He developed a very different system that\ngeneralizes von Neumann\u2019s representation of Cantor\u2019s\nordinals, as well as Dedekind\u2019s representation of the real\nnumbers, to generate a much larger field that has become known as the\n\u201csurreal numbers\u201d. It contains a copy of each ordinal and\ncardinal number, while defining operations that work just like\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and\nthe taking of roots, on the standard reals. In particular, even the\ninfinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers are amenable to these\noperations. Thus, as well as familiar numbers, we now have numbers\nsuch as \\(\\sqrt\\omega, \\omega/2, -\\omega, 1/\\omega, -\\omega^\\omega,\\)\nand so on. Indeed, as Ehrlich (2001, 2012) observes, the surreal\nnumbers may plausibly be regarded as including \u201call numbers\ngreat and small\u201d! The surreal numbers can apparently be applied\nin cases where there is no straightforward way to use hyperreals, as\nfor example in the treatment of Pascal\u2019s Wager, discussed in\nsection\n 7.3\u2014see\n H\u00e1jek (2003a).\n\nBecause the field of surreal numbers contains copies of all the\nordinals, it is too big to form a set. But because the operations\nbehave like the operations on the standard reals, these copies of the\nordinals don\u2019t represent counting. See the\n\nSupplement on the Construction of Surreal Numbers\n\n\nfor a summary of Conway\u2019s construction of them. Other\nconstructions of this same structure have been carried out by Knuth\n(1974) and Gonshor (1986) in more introductory texts.\n",
