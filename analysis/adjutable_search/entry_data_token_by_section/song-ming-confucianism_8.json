    "main_text": "Pattern (li) || Pattern and Its Relationship to Qi\n3.1 Pattern and Its Relationship to Qi\n\nMost Confucians in the Song-Ming period believed that all phenomenal\nthings and events are constituted of qi, a kind of vital,\nenergetic material. But many doubted that qi alone could\naccount for everything of significance about the phenomenal world. The\nworld has a certain unity and order that they saw as highly valuable,\nevident in things such as the natural behaviors of plants and animals,\nand the way that seasons work cooperatively with living things (and\nwith one another) to sustain and reproduce life. And human beings have\ncertain capacities to understand and contribute to the order and unity\nof things, capacities that seem to be part of our natural endowment.\nMany Neo-Confucians thought that some further explanatory principle or\nground was needed to account for this order, unity, and the natural\ncapacities that help us make sense of them, and for this they appealed\nto the notion of Pattern (li).\n\nThe Chinese character translated here as \u201cPattern\u201d is\nli, a term that appeared relatively rarely in classical\nConfucian texts but became ubiquitous in philosophical discourse well\nbefore the Song, by which time it was often used to refer to what\nmight be called the underlying reality or ultimate nature of things.\nFor many Buddhists, a thing\u2019s Pattern was its inherent\n\u201cemptiness\u201d, which is to say, roughly, its lack of any\nintrinsic phenomenal qualities or essences. For Buddhists this helped\nto justify the view that phenomenal qualities or essences are\nillusory, merely conventional, or conferred by the larger whole. Most\nSong-Ming Neo-Confucians rejected this view. They agreed that all\nthings have an underlying Pattern, but this Pattern is what they\ncalled ceaseless life-production or ceaseless life-generativity, not\nemptiness. And furthermore, this is a Pattern that all things share,\nso that they belong to a unified system of ceaseless\nlife-generativity. So it is in the ultimate nature of things to\nparticipate in and contribute to these systems, which are\ncharacterized by birth, growth, and reproduction. Paradigmatic models\nof Pattern can be found in the cycles of birth, growth, and\nreproduction evident in the change of seasons, or the way that birth,\ngrowth, and reproduction serve as the central aims or the organizing\nprinciples of families.\n\nMany Daoxue Confucians thought that Pattern can do certain\nexplanatory work that qi cannot. Pattern explains why boats\ncan only travel by water and carts only by land. Pattern explains why\nchildren are naturally inclined to love and serve their parents, and\nwhy things made of qi alternate between yin\n(passive) and yang (active) phases or states. And Pattern\nalso has normative implications, accounting not just for\nchildren\u2019s tendency to love and serve their parents, but also\nfor the fact that it\u2019s proper and virtuous for them to do so.\nMost recognized that these sorts of facts had much to do with the\nconstituent qi in things as well, and a minority among the\nSong-Ming Confucians (e.g., Zhang Zai, Wang Tingxiang, and Wang Fuzhi)\naimed to show that the features and tendencies of qi could\nfully explain some or all such facts (Kasoff 1984; Y. Liu 2000; Angle\n& Tiwald 2017: 36\u201338). But most thought that Pattern has\nsome independent role in accounting for them, some explanatory power\nnot strictly reducible to that of qi. Zhu Xi\u2019s theories\nabout the relationship of Pattern to qi changed over the\ncourse of his life, but on his mature and most influential view,\nPattern is independent of qi in at least two senses. First,\nZhu says that there is a sense in which Pattern is \u201cprior\u201d\nto qi. He makes clear that this is not a sort of temporal\npriority\u2014it is not that Pattern exists first and then\nqi arises subsequently\u2014but when we try to infer back to\nthe origin or basis of things we should treat Pattern as prior or more\nfundamental (ZZYL 1:3). The specific implications of this are\na matter of some speculation (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 38\u201340;\nChen 1987: 3\u201329). A second sort of independence of Pattern is\nthat it functions as a kind of director or \u201cmaster\u201d\n(zhu \u4e3b or zai \u5bb0) of qi. Zhu\nis careful to say that it does not intervene in affairs or directly\nact on qi, but it establishes rules which qi then\nfollows of its own power (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 40\u201342).\n",
