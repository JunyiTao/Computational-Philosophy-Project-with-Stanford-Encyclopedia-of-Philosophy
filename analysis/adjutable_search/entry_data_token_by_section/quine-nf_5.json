    "main_text": "Implementation of Mathematical Concepts in NF\n6. Implementation of Mathematical Concepts in NF\n\n\nTo the extent that mathematical concepts can be implemented in the\ntheory of wellfounded sets (aka ZF) they can also be\ninterpreted in NF \u2013 since NF has a theory of wellfounded\nsets. However this is not the way in which we routinely interpret\nmathematics in NF since the interpreting formul\u00e6 are\nunstratified and unwieldy: extra axioms are needed. For example, the\nVon Neumann implementation of natural numbers tries to tell us that\nthe collection of natural numbers is not the extension of a stratified\nformula, so it cannot be expected to be a set. By the same token,\nordinary functions from the naturals to the naturals can fail to have\nextensions that are sets. Instead we trade on the fact that NF (and\nNFU too) admits a natural implementation of various kinds of\nmathematical entities as global isomorphism classes \u2013 which will\nof course be big sets (qv). The natural number \\(n\\) is\nimplemented as the set of all \\(n\\)-membered sets: this is the\nFrege implementation used also in TST. Rosser [1953a] uses NF instead\nof ZF as a foundation for presenting ordinary mathematics (and to this\nday remains the only book to do so, though Holmes [1998] uses NFU for\nthis purpose).\n\n\nAs we have seen, implementing mathematical objects (ZF-style) as\nwellfounded sets and then reasoning about those wellfounded sets) is\nnot a very satisfactory way to proceed, since NF does not have\nsufficient strength for us to manipulate the implemented objects with\nthe freedom we want. The situation with the endogenous interpretation\n(mathematical objects as global equivalence classes) is potentially\nmore satisfactory. In this scenario cardinals are implemented as\nequivalence classes under equipollence and are (big) sets. The\ncollection of all cardinals is a set. Ordinals can be handled\nsimilarly: ordinals are (big) sets and the collection of all ordinals\nis a (big) set; the collection of all groups is a set, the collection\nof all rings is a set; \u2026. Being big, these sets cannot be\nmanipulated in the freewheeling way that small sets can be. (The axiom\nof scheme of (full, unstratified) separation fails for big sets: if it\ndidn\u2019t then the Russell class would be \\(\\{x \\in V: x \\not\\in\nx\\})\\) and their manipulation is complicated by the appearance on the\nscene of various analogues of the \\(T\\) function (that we saw in\nconnection with the cardinals) that are needed to work round the\nstratification constraints. However, it is most striking that this\ndoesn\u2019t turn out to be much of a problem. On the whole, ordinary\nmathematics seems to be what the Computer Scientists call strongly\ntyped, and to a large extent the stratification constraints of NF\ncoincide with the endogenous strong typing of the mathematical objects\nbeing implemented. Sadly there is no space here for a proper\ndiscussion of this deep and interesting question.\n\n\nHowever, the expression \u201cOrdinary mathematics\u201d is disputed\nturf. On another front there are logicians that are fond of making\nthe point that some of the further reaches of large cardinal theory,\nroutinely disregarded \u2013 and even disparaged \u2013 by many\nmathematicians nevertheless have implications for a kind of low-level\nmathematics whose core significance is not in dispute. Inevitably the\nquestion of the adequacy of NF for \u201cOrdinary mathematics\u201d\nwill overlap with this debate. However there is a further\ncomplication to be considered. All these big collections that\nimplement the collection of all cardinals (or of all ordinals etc.)\nare nevertheless sets, so there are questions arising from their\nsethood that we can ask about them, and some of these questions have\nno parallel in ZF. What is the cofinality of the wellordering of the\nordinals? Can we map onto \\(V\\) the set of those sets that do\nnot map onto \\(V\\)? No doubt there will be people who say that\nthese questions are not proper mathematical questions at all, but are\nmere pathological artefacts of a misconceived system of axioms.\nHowever, there is the intriguing possibility that answers to these\nquestions could have implications for the study of the kind of small\nsets that appear in \u201cordinary mathematics\u201d. No such\nimplications have been found so far, but then no-one has looked very\nhard. We know of subclasses of the naturals definable by formul\u00e6\nthat have big sets as parameters, so we know where to start looking.\nIt is tempting to speculate what the consequences might be for NF\nstudies were any to be discovered.\n",
