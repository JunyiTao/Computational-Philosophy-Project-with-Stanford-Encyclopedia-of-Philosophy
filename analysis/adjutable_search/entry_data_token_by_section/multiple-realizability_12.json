    "main_text": "The Shifting Status of Multiple Realizability Early in the New Millennium || The Empire Strikes Back\n3.1 The Empire Strikes Back\n\nExpectedly, proponents of multiple realizability quickly responded to\nthe myriad challenges outlined in\n section 2\n above. Carl Gillett and Ken Aizawa were perhaps the most vocal\ndefenders of multiple realizability against a number of them. Gillett\n(2003) develops a precise framework for understanding compositionality\nrelations in science generally, and uses this framework to define\nproperty realization and multiple realization, and to distinguish\nfurther \u201cflat\u201d from \u201cdimensioned\u201d realization.\nRecall from\n section 2.4\n above that \u201cflat\u201d realization involves both realized and\nrealizing properties inhering in a single object.\n\u201cDimensioned\u201d realization involves realized and realizing\nproperties inhering in distinct individuals that stand in a\ncompositional relationship to one another. For Gillett (2002, 2003),\nthis distinction is important for two reasons. First, scientific\nexplanations employ dimensioned realizations, because inter-level\nmechanistic explanations relate distinct individuals. Second, Fodor\nand other proponents of the standard multiple realizability arguments\nwere assuming a dimensioned account, while the arguments of Shapiro\nand other recent critics (see\n \u00a72\n above) challenge the existence of multiple realizability only by\nassuming a flat realization. According to Gillett, no recent proponent\nof multiple realizability has assumed or defended flat realization as\nthe correct account involved in any of the scientific cases at\nissue.\n\nExplicitly applying Gillett\u2019s precise framework for realization\nand related notions, Ken Aizawa and Gillett defend the existence of\nmultiple realization in a variety of sciences (2009a). They also argue\nfor the \u201cmassive multiple realization\u201d of properties at\nevery level of organization, from the structure and function of\nproteins in neurons to those of human cognition to those of social\ninteractions (2009b). Their detailed scientific example in the latter\nessay is visual processing. They contend that neuroscientists, unlike\nphilosophers, are unfazed by massive multiple realization. Multiple\nrealization has been so contentious in philosophy of mind, they\ninsist, because philosophers tacitly assume flawed or scientifically\nunfounded accounts of realization, like the flat view. According to\nAizawa and Gillett (2009b), philosophers uncritically accept a\nnarrative that links multiple realization to the strict methodological\nautonomy of psychology from neuroscience. They also contend that the\nempirical details of vision research show that a co-evolutionary\nresearch methodology is not just consistent with, but explicitly\nmotivated by massive multiple realization. So this uncritically\naccepted philosophical narrative not only blinds philosophers to facts\nthat scientists recognize as unproblematic; it is also empirically\nfalse.\n\nSoon afterwards, Aizawa and Gillett (2011) distinguish two strategies\nscientists might adopt to deal with putative cases of multiple\nrealization. One strategy is simply to take multiple realization at\nface value and live with multiply realized kinds. The other is to\nsplit the higher-level multiply realized kind into a variety of\nsub-kinds, one for each of its distinct lower level realizers, and\nthen eliminate the original higher-level kind, at least for the\npurposes of further scientific investigation. Do scientists always\nfavor the second strategy, as recent philosophical critics of multiple\nrealizability would seem to recommend? With its well-known\ndistinctions between different types or systems, memory research would\nseem to be a clear instance of using such an\n\u201celiminate-and-split\u201d strategy. Yet, Aizawa and Gillett\nargue, such an assessment oversimplifies the actual scientific details\nin even this much-discussed case. Here too they sense an important\ngeneral methodological lesson: psychology took account of neuroscience\ndiscoveries, so even when taking multiple realization at face value\nscientists do not advocate strict methodological autonomy. But the\nactual details of how psychology takes neuroscientific discoveries\ninto account depends both on the nature of the psychological kinds in\nquestion and the needs of theorizing specific to psychology.\n\nAizawa has also replied to a number of the challenges to the standard\nmultiple realizability argument scouted in\n section 2\n above. After separating three distinct arguments in Bechtel and\nMundale (1999;\n \u00a72.3\n above), Aizawa (2009) sets his critical sights on their Central\nArgument, which argues against multiple realization from the existence\nand continued success of brain mapping studies. He argues that Bechtel\nand Mundale misrepresent the actual nature of these studies, and more\ngenerally of the methods employed in functional localization studies.\nWorking with exactly the scientific examples Bechtel and Mundale\ndiscuss (mostly from the functional neuroanatomy of vision), Aizawa\nargues that claims about psychological functions do not play the\nspecific role in these studies that Bechtel and Mundale insist. So the\nsuccess of these studies does not imply the falsity of multiple\nrealization. Later in that paper Aizawa challenges two of Bechtel and\nMundale\u2019s key assertions. He denies that if psychological\nproperties were multiply realized, then functional taxonomy of the\nbrain would have to be carried out independently of psychological\nfunction. And he denies that multiple realization rules out\ncomparisons of brains across different species. Hence all the premises\nof Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s Central Argument are false. Aizawa\n(2007) criticizes Bickle\u2019s (2003) argument that a unitary\nrealization of memory consolidation across species has been found at\nthe level of molecular mechanisms, despite widespread neural\ndifferences in these brains at higher levels of neuroscientific\ndescription\n (\u00a72.3\n above). According to Aizawa, the protein components of these\nevolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms, and the NNA sequences\ncoding for them, are themselves multiply realized across species.\nAizawa (2013) presented numerous scientific examples of multiple\nrealization by \u201ccompensatory differences\u201d. In such cases,\nchanges to one or more properties that jointly realize a realized\nproperty G are compensated for by changes in others of the\njointly realizing properties. Although his overall goal in this paper\nis to bring this form of multiple realization to wider recognition and\nstudy by philosophers of science, he uses the broader\n\u201cGillett-Aizawa framework\u201d to argue that highly specific\ndeterminate properties, not just generic determinable properties, are\nmultiply realized in this specific fashion. Such multiply realized\ndeterminate properties are indeed exactly similar across distinct\nrealizations, and so answer the dilemma posed by Shapiro and others\n (\u00a72.4\n above).\n\nCarrie Figdor (2010) challenges criticisms of multiple realization\nthat appeal to neuroscience, citing explicitly the works discussed in\n section 2.3\n and\n section 2.7\n above. She undertakes to demonstrate not only the empirical\nplausibility of mind-brain multiple realization, but also to clarify\nthe terms of the empirically-focused debate. Her scientific focus is\non \u201clocalizationism\u201d, especially the \u201cbrain mapping\nprojects\u201d using state-of-the-art functional neuroimaging (2010:\n420). Concerning the terms of the empirically-focused debate, Figdor\nargues that none of the multiple realization hypotheses common to the\nphilosophical literature is appropriate to this scientific endeavor.\nInstead she appeals to \u201cdegeneracy\u201d, a concept from\ngeneral biology meaning \u201cthe ability of elements that are\nstructurally different to perform the same function or yield the same\noutput\u201d, a characteristic of complexity ranging from the genetic\ncode to immune systems to populations (e.g., Edelman and Gally 2001).\nThis is the notion, Figdor claims, that has been co-opted by cognitive\nneuroscientists to mean \n\n\nfor a given cognitive function F, there is more than one\nnonisomorphic (nonidentical) structural element that can subserve\nF, either within an individual at a time, across individuals,\nor within an individual across times. (2010: 428) \n\n\nA major reason for cognitive neuroscientist co-opting degeneracy in\nthis fashion is the frequency of anomalous results in functional\nneuroimaging studies that show activations of brain areas that differ\nacross subjects, or even in a single subject across performances of\nthe same experimental task,. Figdor discusses numerous examples from\nrecent cognitive neuroscience, and carefully separates cases of\ndegeneracy that count as multiple realizations from others that do\nnot. She concludes that her \u201csketch of degeneracy in cognitive\nneuroscience suffices to show that [multiple realizability] is a\nviable empirical hypothesis (2010: 237). And she concludes by\naddressing specifically Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s (1999) empirical\narguments challenging multiple realizability from functional imaging\nstudies (see\n \u00a72.3\n above). Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s claim that neuroscience has been\nuseful for psychology is true, Figdor asserts, but does not challenge\na degeneracy-based empirical case for multiple realizability. And\nBechtel and Mundale\u2019s stronger claim, that neuroscientists\nimplicitly assume the falsity of multiple realization as reflected in\ntheir accepted practices, is itself shown to be false by the use of\ndegeneracy in cognitive neuroscience.\n",
