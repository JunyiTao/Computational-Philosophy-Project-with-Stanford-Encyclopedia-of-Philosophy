    "main_text": "Theories of the Right to Secede || Situating theories of secession within theories of territory and territorial justice\n2.4  Situating theories of secession within theories of territory and territorial justice\n\n\nAs Lea Brilmayer has rightly stressed, secession is not simply the\nformation of a new political association among individuals or the\nrepudiation by a group of persons of their obligation to obey the\nstate\u2019s laws (Brilmayer 1991). It is the taking of a part of the\nterritory claimed by an existing state. Accordingly, rival theories of\nsecession must be understood as providing alternative accounts of what\nit takes for a group to come to have a claim to territory that is at\nthe time included in the territory of an existing state.\n\n\nThe remedial right only approach to unilateral secession recognizes\nat least two ways a group can have the requisite valid claim to\nterritory: (a) by reclaiming territory over which they were sovereign\nbut which was unjustly taken from them (as with the Baltic\nRepublics\u2019 secession from the Soviet Union in 1991); or (b) by\ncoming to have a claim to sovereignty over the territory as a result of\navailing themselves of a last resort remedy against serious and\npersistent injustices in the form of violations of basic human rights.\nA more expansive reading of (b) would include among the injustices that\ncan ground a unilateral right to secede, not only the violation of\nbasic human rights, but also the state\u2019s major violations of, or\nunilateral revocation of, intrastate autonomy agreements (as with\nMilosovic\u2019s destruction of Kosovo\u2019s autonomy in 1989) and\nperhaps also refusal to negotiate regarding intrastate autonomy with\ngroups that have a reasonable claim to it.\n\n\nWith respect to (a), the basis of the secessionists\u2019 claim to\nterritory is straightforward: they are simply reclaiming what was\nrecognized by international law as theirs. With respect to (b), the\nremedial right only theory begins with the presumption that existing\nstates that are accorded legitimacy under international law have valid\nclaims to their territories but then argues that such claims can be\noverridden or extinguished in the face of persistent patterns of\nserious injustices towards groups within the state. The idea is that\nthe validity of the state\u2019s claim to the territory cannot be\nsustained when secession is the only remedy for serious injustices.\n\n\nWhile primary theorists like Christopher Wellman have not yet\npublished their own replies to the objections that his plebiscitary\nview lacks a much-needed theory of territory, some developments in the\nliterature on territorial rights might be used in defense of the\nplebiscitary view (though the way in which they do so is considerably\nless straightforward than is the case with remedial right only\ntheories). Anna Stilz argues that a state has territorial rights if and\nonly if it protects basic rights and claims of justice and reflects the\nshared will of the population within that territory (Stilz 2019, p.\n90). She calls these the values of basic justice and\ncollective self-determination. Stilz also claims that a state\ncan gain the right to rule over a particular territory\nthat is not already subject to the territorial rights of another\nentity when it is able and willing to satisfy these values.\nWellman could use this combination of basic justice and collective\nself-determination to claim that a separatist group driven by majority\nvote that is willing and able to satisfy basic rights and justice for\nits members can gain rights to the territory it needs to form its own\nindependent state\u2014while denying the original state\u2019s\nterritorial claim at the same time. Whether this appropriation of\nStilz\u2019s view works depends on whether the conditions that enable\nthe initial acquisition of territorial rights\u2014the establishment\nof a valid claim to territory over a region that at the time is not the\nobject of a valid claim by any other entity\u2014are the same as those\nwhich establish a claim to territory over which some entity has\nhitherto held valid territorial rights. One might argue that the\nconditions for the latter are more demanding than for the former.\n\n\nStilz\u2019s conception of the value of basic justice can be\nsatisfied by Wellman\u2019s viability proviso, and his simple majority\nvote requirement bears directly on the way in which she conceives the\nvalue of collective self-determination, namely, in terms of a shared\nwill. Wellman could say that a group that has voted to leave the state\nand be independently self-determining no longer shares the relevant\npolitical will with the broader citizenry of the original state. Stilz\nholds that an important part of the political will is a willingness\nand/or desire to engage (or continue engaging) in a political project\nwith members of the greater state. A vote in favor of secession is a\nclear indication that such a desire is no longer shared by a majority\nof that plebiscite\u2014they do not affirm existing institutions and\ndo not share a commitment to cooperating with them. In this way, the\noriginal state can no longer be taken to reflect the population\u2019s\nshared will. Using Stilz\u2019s theory of territory, then, Wellman\ncould argue that the separatist group has a clearly stronger claim to\nthe disputed territory than the original state does. Whether this\nappeal to Stilz\u2019s view works will depend on whether the notion of\na shared will can be spelled out and shown to be of such crucial\nimportance that the absence of it on the part of some groups within the\nstate defeats a legitimate state\u2019s claim to territory.\n\n\nThe plebiscitary view also faces the criticism that it cannot defend\nthe attribution of territorial rights to the particular group that\nseeks independence. Here, too, plebiscitary theorists might borrow from\nStilz. In addition to the values of basic justice and collective\nself-determination, she places considerable emphasis on occupancy\nrights. On her view, a group must have occupancy rights to the\nparticular territory over which they seek to claim sovereignty (Stilz\n2019, ch. 2). Wellman has previously acknowledged that his position\nrequires occupancy rights, but he has not yet elaborated on what these\noccupancy rights consist in. His view might be bolstered by emphasizing\nStilz\u2019s notion that occupancy rights are grounded in the\nimportance of a region to the life-styles and culture of a group. Such\nan account of occupancy rights might be utilized to explain how the\nboundaries of the plebiscite on secession ought to be drawn.\n\n\nThe plebiscitary theorists appeal to occupancy rights may turn out\nto be a double-edged sword, however. Those who oppose a\nparticular secession might argue that they have occupancy rights in the\nwhole territory of the state in which they are citizens and that to\nhave occupancy rights to a particular portion of it they need not\nactually be present in it. If a state has a valid claim to a territory\nand it allows freedom of movement within its boundaries, all citizens\nare usually understood to have occupancy right to the whole extent of\nthe territory, not just that portion in which they presently\nreside.\n\n\nThe plebiscitary rights theorist could reply as follows. Even if all\nthe citizens of the state have occupancy rights regarding the seceding\nregion, surely those residing in that region have weightier occupancy\nrights, at least if being in that region is important for their\nindividual and collective projects.\n\n\nThe discussion in this entry thus far indicates that all three types\nof the most prominent theories (remedial rights only, plebiscitary, and\nascriptivist) suffer a serious incompleteness: they do not situate\ntheir views on secession within the context of a comprehensive theory\nof territorial justice. A theory of territorial justice aims to do at\nleast the following four things, all of which are relevant to theories\nof secession. First, it should provide a coherent account of\nvalid moral claims to territory of various types, from claims to full\nsovereign jurisdiction, to claims to the more limited jurisdictional\ncontrol needed for various forms of intrastate autonomy (modes of\nself-determination short of full independence), to claims to\nparticipation in various forms of joint jurisdiction. Second, and\nrelatedly, it should offer a coherent explanation of which elements of\ncontrol over territory can be justified. A theory of territory is not\nonly a theory of the geographical domain of jurisdictional authority\nbut also must the right to control resources within a territory, the\nright of defense against the taking of territory, the right to control\nover the movement of people and good across borders, and so on.\n\n\nThird, it should explain which groups are connected, in which ways,\nto which territories. That requires offering principles to guide\nthe drawing of boundaries and to adjudicate disputes over\nboundaries. Finally, it would need to have a theory of what kind\nof agent has rights over territory (a nation? \u2013 as in\nMiller\u2019s (2007) theory; an ethno-geographic group? as argued by\nKolers (2009); a people? as in Moore (2015) and Stilz (2019)) and how\nthese groups relate to the state.\n\n\nFor each type of theory of secession, there are unanswered questions\nand potential objections regarding territorial justice. For example,\nremedial right only theories that include unjust annexations of\nterritory among the injustices that ground a unilateral (claim-)right\nto secede must provide a satisfactory solution to what has elsewhere\nbeen called the moral statute of limitations problem (Buchanan 1991:\n88): how durable are claims to independence based on past unjust\ntakings\u2014how far back in history may a group go in making the case\nthat they are entitled to their own state because they previously had\none?\n\n\nImportantly, a remedial right only theory of the unilateral right to\nsecede will only be defensible in the end if it rests upon a plausible\naccount of what entitles a state to control over a territory in the\nfirst place. Without such an account the remedial right only view\nappears arbitrarily to privilege the status quo by requiring\nsecessionists to bear the burden of showing that they have suffered\nserious and persistent injustices in order to establish their claim to\nterritory. To answer this objection, the remedial right only theorist\nwould have to provide and defend a justice-based theory of legitimacy,\narguing that what grounds the state\u2019s claim to territory is its\nprovision of justice, and that it is for this reason that only serious\ninjustices can void that claim (such an account of legitimacy is in\nBuchanan 2013). To avoid the charge that its theory of territorial\nrights gives short shrift to the value of self-determination, a\nremedial right theory would have to show that in some cases at least a\nsecessionist group\u2019s claims to self-determination can be\nadequately accommodated by intrastate autonomy arrangements that do not\nerase the state\u2019s claims to its entire territory. And it would\nhave to provide a principled account of when claims to\nself-determination are adequately satisfied through intrastate autonomy\narrangements short of full-independence.\n2.5. Narrowly versus Widely Institutional Theories\n\n\nThere is another illuminating way of sorting theories of secession.\nAs noted in subsection 2.3, some theories assume that only certain\nfacts institutions are relevant for determining when a group has the\nright to secede.. The plebiscitary theory developed by Altman and\nWellman (2009), assumes that the only institutional facts that matter\nare these: will the seceding group be able to create the institutions\nneeded for it to function and will the remainder state\u2019s\ninstitutions allow it to continue to function. In other words, on\ntheir view, the only institutional interests relevant to determining\nwhether a right to secede exists are the interest in the functioning of\nthe new state and the remainder state. In effect, this theory treats\nsecession as strictly a two-party affair, so far as the interest\nrelevant to determining whether a group has the right to secede is\nconcerned. Buchanan\u2019s theory, in contrast, argues that other\nparties can have legitimate interests that are relevant to determining\nwhat the rights of the primary parties are. In particular, he contends\nthat international institutional interests are relevant, including the\ninterest in preventing human rights violations that predictably occur\nin contested secessions and the interest in sustaining stable and\npeaceful relations among states.\n\n\nAltman and Wellman might reply that their State Viability Proviso\ndoes take the interests of third parties into account. More\nspecifically, the fulfillment of the Proviso serves the interests of\nthird parties in having viable states and in the provision of justice\nthat comes with the discharging of basic state functions.\n\n\nThe problem with this reply is that, while acknowledging that\nthird-party interests can be relevant to determining whether a group\nhas the right to secede, it offers no reason as to why legitimate\nthird-party interests should be thus restricted. Why aren\u2019t the\ninterest in sustaining a stable order of states and in avoiding\nsecurity crises of the sort that secessions\u2014especially\nirredentist secessions--can create also relevant to determining the\ncontours of the right to secede? After all, whether a group has the\n(claim-)right to secede depends on whether other parties have\nsufficient reason to refraining from trying to prevent the secession\nand that in turn can depend on whether the secession is likely to have\na negative impact on various legitimate interests, including, but not\nlimited to the interest in the remainder state and the new state being\nviable.\n\n\nThis leaves plebiscitary theories vulnerable to the following\nobjection: Suppose that a group within a legitimate, reasonably just\nstate, is a majority in a portion of the state\u2019s territory and\nprefers to have its own state. Whether they have the right to secede\ndepends on whether there are sufficient reasons for other states to\nrefrain from interfering with their attempt at secession (because the\nright in question is a claim-right, which features a correlative\nobligation not to interfere with the secession). But whether other\nstates ought to refrain from interfering with a secession or not\ninterfere with the state\u2019s attempt to prevent a secession can\ndepend on whether behaving in this way is likely to help establish a\nnew norm of customary international law that permits\nterritorially-concentrated majorities unilaterally to form their own\nstates without interference. In the absence of impartial institutions\nto determine when the conditions for justified secession according to\nthe plebiscitary theory are met, such a new, much more permissive norm\nof customary international law would be dangerous\u2014it might\nencourage secessions that do not meet the plebiscitary theories\u2019\nown criteria. So, as in the case of irredentist secessions noted above,\nit appears that in these circumstances as well, whether other states\nought to interfere with an attempted secession, and hence whether a\ngroup has the right to secede, can depend on factors other than those\nthe plebiscitary theory allows to count.\n\n\nIf it is true that a range of legitimate interests is relevant to\ndetermining the nature of the moral right to secede, and if the extent\nthat these interests are impacted by secession depends on the existing\ninstitutional resources, including not just those of the remainder\nstate and the new state, but also those of regional and international\norganizations, then it follows that a theory of the moral right to\nsecede must take into account existing institutional realities at all\nlevels. Buchanan\u2019s latest work on secession delves into just\nthis\u2014he argues that the moral right to secede is\ninstitution-dependent in the sense that whether a group has\nthe moral right to secede depends on the nature of existing\ninstitutions and whether or not they can adequately mitigate the risks\nthat secession would pose to various morally important interests. This\nmeans that properly theorizing the right to secede requires\nempirically-backed premises that characterize a) the range of morally\nsignificant interests at risk in various cases of secession and b) the\nability or inability of existing institutions to mitigate those risks.\nIf this is true, then it seems that both remedial right only and\nprimary right views are incomplete, as neither provide these important\nempirical premises.\n2.6 Comparing Theories of Secession\n\n\nAt present it is fair to say that none of the rival types of\ntheories is sufficiently worked out for a definitive comparative\nevaluation to be possible. For each type of theory there are unanswered\nquestions and potential objections.\n\n\nAll three types of theories must address satisfactorily what may be\ncalled the problem of authentic voice. For ascriptivist and remedial\nright only theories, this means providing a reasoned answer to the\nquestion \u201cwhat counts as an authentic decision to attempt to\nsecede?\u201d (Is there some nonarbitrary way of specifying what sort\nof majority is required in favor of secession before it can be said\nthat the group in question has chosen to exercise its right to\nsecede?). Similarly, plebiscitary right theorists must provide a\nprincipled account of how large a majority in favor of secession must\nexist, before it can be said that the right to secede exists.\n\n\nIn addition, all three types of theories must articulate a plausible\naccount of the rights of those within the seceding territory who oppose\nsecession. For example, are there circumstances in which the\nanti-secessionists should be granted dual citizenship, so that they can\npreserve their citizenship in the state from which the secession is\noccurring? Are there circumstances in which they deserve compensation\nfor losses they incur when a new state, perhaps with different property\nlaws, is created?\n\n\nFinally, as suggested earlier, the implications of each type of\ntheory for international law regarding secession should be explained.\nIn the next section, we explore briefly the relationship between views\nabout the moral (claim-)right to unilateral secession and the question\nof what position international law should take on unilateral\nsecession.\n3. Secession and Just War Theory\n\n\nA more serious lacuna in the philosophical literature on secession\nthan the failure to integrate it into a comprehensive theory of\nterritorial justice is the absence of a connection with just war\ntheory. In real-world conflicts in which a group asserts the right to\nsecede and the state denies the validity of the claim, either one or\nboth of the parties often resorts to force. But merely establishing\nthat a group has the right to secede does not settle whether it is\njustified in using force to achieve its goal of independent statehood.\n(In general, merely having a right to X does not\nentail being justified in using force to secure X).\nSimilarly, if the group does not have the right to secede, it may still\nnot be justifiable for the state to use force to prevent it from\nseceding. Remarkably, philosophical theories of secession have not\ndistinguished between having the right to secede and being justified in\nusing force to exercise the right. Nor have they discussed the\nconditions under which states have the right to use force to resist\nsecessions when the secessionists have no moral right to secede. This\nis especially surprising, given the resurgence of philosophical\ntheorizing about just war.\n\n\nThe key point here is that mainstream just war theory does not\nendorse the assertion that the violation of any right can justify force\nnor the assertion that force is justified if it is required for the\nsuccessful exercise of any right. Instead, the dominant view is that\nthe list of just causes (legitimate ends to be served by going to war)\nis more constrained than that and should reflect the conviction that\nthe use of force is only justified if it is required to remedy very\nserious injustices or for the exercise of very important rights and\nalso satisfies a proportionality requirement.\n\n\nIt is far from obvious how just war theory and the theory of\nsecession should be connected. It appears, however, the use of force by\nsecessionists would be more problematic on some theories of secession\nthan on others. Suppose, for example, that a majority of the people in\na portion of a legitimate state\u2019s territory decide that they want\ntheir own state there, in spite of the fact that they are not victims\nof any injustices at the hands of the state. On the plebiscitary\ntheory, they have the right to secede (so long as the new unit and the\nremainder state will be able adequately to perform the basic functions\nof government). If the state refuses to vacate its facilities in that\nregion, turn over control over that portion of the border to the\nsecessionists, etc., is it justifiable for the secessionists to use\nforce against the agents of the state? Does the mere preference for\ntheir own state justify engaging in a course of action that is likely\nto result in large-scale violence? The problem here is that the purpose\nthe secessionists can invoke to justify a course of action seems not to\nfit well with the usual understandings of just cause. In contrast,\nremedial right only theories would seem to be consistent, at least in\nprinciple, with mainstream just war theory, because the latter\nrecognizes redress of serious injustices (and not the mere desire to\nhave one\u2019s own political unit) as a just cause.\n\n\nNonetheless, a fully-developed remedial right only theory would have\nto provide an account of when injustices are sufficiently serious to\nwarrant secession under conditions in which there is a significant risk\nof large-scale violence. Regardless of which type of theory one\nembraces, one would also need an account of the conditions under which\nthe state would be justified in using force to block secession. For as\nwe have already noted, the mere fact that the group attempting to\nsecede does not have a right to secede does not imply that it is\njustifiable for the state to use force to prevent them from seceding. A\nmoral theory of secession should not be limited, then, to articulating\nand defending characterization of the moral right to secede. It should\nalso provide an account of the morality of using force in conflicts\nover secession and one that is consistent with its view of the right to\nsecede.\n4. Secession and the Philosophy of International Law\n\n\nThere is yet another desideratum for a theory of secession: As\nsuggested earlier, the implications of each type of theory for\ninternational law regarding secession should be explained. And\npresumably an account of the morality of secession should provide some\nguidance for determining what the posture of international law should\nbe regarding secession. In the next section, we explore briefly the\nrelationship between views about the moral (claim-)right to unilateral\nsecession and the question of what position international law should\ntake on unilateral secession.\n\n\nThe deficiencies of existing international law regarding secession\nmotivate the project of developing principled proposals for reform. At\npresent international law recognizes only a very narrow set of\ncircumstances under which the unilateral right to secede exists as an\ninternational legal right, namely, when a group is subject to colonial\ndomination or is the victim of an unlawful occupation by a foreign\nentity or is subjected to an Apartheid-like regime. The difficulty with\nthis conception of the international legal right to unilateral\nsecession is that, while clearly embodying the idea that serious and\npersistent injustices can generate a right to unilateral secession, it\narbitrarily restricts the injustices that generate the right.\n\n\nAnother difficulty is that while international legal doctrine with\nan arbitrarily restricted conception of the situations that generate a\nunilateral right to secede, several important international legal\ndocuments include reference to an apparently much broader \u201cright\nof self-determination of all peoples\u201d which is said to include\nthe right to choose full independence, and hence the right to\n secede.[10]\n One\nway to conceive of the chief task for a moral theory of international\nlaw regarding secession is that it must provide a reasoned basis for\nremoving the arbitrary restriction from which the current law suffers,\nwhile avoiding the dangerously expansive notion that all\n\u201cpeoples\u201d are entitled to their own states, in a world in\nwhich virtually every existing state includes more than one\n\u201cpeople\u201d, in which several \u201cpeoples\u201d claim the\nsame territory, and in which there are no international institutional\nprinciples or mechanisms for sorting out these conflicting claims.\n\n\nAn important choice for the moral theorist of international law\nregarding secession regards the scope of the right itself. On one view,\ninternational law should simply acknowledge, under certain conditions\nto be specified by the theory, a group\u2019s right to its own state;\non the other view, international law should distinguish between (a) the\nconditions under which a group should be accorded the right to\nrepudiate the jurisdiction of the state over a portion of the\nstate\u2019s territory and to attempt to establish its own control\nthere and (b) the conditions under which international law should\nrecognize the secessionist entity as a legitimate state, with all the\nrights, immunities, privileges, and obligations this entails.\n\n\nThe difference between these two options can be appreciated if we\ntake the example of a remedial right only approach to proposals for\nreforming international law regarding secession. For simplicity,\nsuppose that the remedial right only theory under consideration\nrecognizes only large-scale and persistent violations of basic human\nrights as grounding the unilateral right to secede, and suppose that\ngroup G has suffered such violations. On the first\nview, the proposal is that international law should simply acknowledge\nthat G has the right to its own legitimate state if\nforming a new state is the remedy of last resort for large-scale,\npersistent violations of the basic human rights of members\nof G, where this means that other states should recognize\nthe new entity as having all the rights, privileges, immunities,\npowers, and obligations this status entails. On the second view, there\nare two distinct questions the international law of secession should\naddress: First, has G suffered large-scale and\npersistent violations of basic human rights and second,\ndoes G satisfy the conditions for recognitional\nlegitimacy, for being recognized as a legitimate state? The second view\nwould maintain that although the group\u2019s having suffered\nlarge-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights is\nsufficient for acknowledging its right to repudiate the state\u2019s\njurisdiction and attempt to set up its own state, something more is\nrequired before international law should recognize the new entity as a\nlegitimate state; in particular, the new state should provide credible\nassurances that it will respect the rights of minorities within its\nterritory.\n\n\nMaking recognition of legitimate statehood dependent in this way\nupon satisfying basic requirements of justice coheres with the remedial\nright only theory\u2019s approach to secession, which involves\nrewarding states that respect rights. But there is much to be said for\ndistinguishing, regardless of which theory of the right to secede is\nadopted, between the right to secede (understood as\nthe right to repudiate the state\u2019s authority over a portion of\nits territory and to attempt to set up a new state there) and\nthe right to recognition as a legitimate state. New\nentities created through secession typically are keen to receive\nrecognition of their legitimacy because of the benefits this confers,\nincluding access to favorable trade regimes, loans and credits from\ninternational agencies such as the World Bank and International\nMonetary Fund, and the ability to participate as an equal with other\nstates in the making of international law. Distinguishing between\nwhether a group has the right to secede (to repudiate the state\u2019s\njurisdiction and attempt to establish its own state) and whether it has\nthe right to recognition as a legitimate state enables the\ninternational legal system to impose normative conditions on\nrecognition in circumstances in which new states have strong incentives\nto satisfy them.\n\n\nA fully-developed philosophical theory of what the international law\nof secession ought to be would be quite ambitious and complex. It would\nhave to include not only an account of the connection between the right\nto secede and the right to recognition, but also a theory of justified\nintervention in support of or against secession that would cohere with\na more general position on the legitimate use of force across\nborders.\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nPhilosophical work on secession falls into three main categories:\n(1) attempts to develop an account of the moral right to secede\n(understood either as a claim-right or as a mere liberty), (2)\ninvestigations of the compatibility or incompatibility of secession\nwith constitutionalism, and (3) attempts to determine what posture\ninternational law should adopt concerning secession. In each of these\nareas of inquiry, as well as in the connections among them, exploration\nof the moral issues of secession provides a powerful lens through which\nto examine some of the most important issues of moral-political theory,\nincluding perhaps the most fundamental issue of all: what gives a state\na valid claim to its territory?",
