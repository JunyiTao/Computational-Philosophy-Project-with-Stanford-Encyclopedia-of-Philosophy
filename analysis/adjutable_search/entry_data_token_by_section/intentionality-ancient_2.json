    "main_text": "Before Plato\n3. Before Plato\n\nParmenides of Elea (early 5th century bce) is\narguably the first Greek philosopher to have focused on the\nproblematic nature of intentionality. His poem (transmitted under the\ntitle On Nature) offers a startling revelation of the\nallegedly true nature of reality and appearance, in which the narrator\nis instructed by a goddess that \u201cyou cannot grasp or express\nwhat is not \u2013 it cannot be accomplished\u201d (B2), for\n\u201cthinking cannot be found apart from what is, upon which its\nexpression depends\u201d (B8.35\u201336) and \u201cwhat can be said\nand thought must be what is\u201d (B6). The Greek for the phrases\n\u2018what is\u2019 and \u2018what is not\u2019 are notoriously\nambiguous. But if, as many interpreters maintain (see Owen 1960; Furth\n1968), it should be construed here either in terms of (a)\nwhat does or does not exist, or (b) what is\nor is not the case, or perhaps (c) some fusion of\nthe two, then the goddess is denying the possibility of thinking or\nspeaking either about nonexistent objects, or about nonfactual\nstates-of-affairs, or both, on the basis of the following intuitions.\nIf one is to think or express anything at all, there must be\nsomething that one is thinking or expressing (thus quantifying in).\nBut what is not, by hypothesis, is not there to be thought of\n(cf. B3), since either it does not exist or is not in fact the case;\nand if there isn\u2019t anything there to be thought of, then we must\nnot be thinking of anything either. Parallel problems are supposed to\narise in the case of speech, for statements concerning a nonexistent\nor for false statements.\n\nConcerns about non-existent objects or non-factual states of affairs\nare not explicit in Parmenides\u2019 poem, though \u2013\nunsurprisingly, the goddess does not give examples of what she is\nproscribing. This leaves room for other construals of \u2018what is\nnot\u2019, such as the view that it always requires completion or\nspecification as \u2018what is not F\u2019 for some value\nof F, so that \u2018what is not\u2019 raises concerns about\nnegative predication instead, especially in explanatory and\ncosmological contexts. But of course the precise nature of the\ndifficulty here is not spelled out either, so speculative\nreconstruction is required. In any case, the goddess herself seems to\nuse negation and the phrase \u2018what is not\u2019 quite freely,\nthough perhaps this is just symptomatic of her liminal position at the\nborders of Night and Day (B1).\n\nWhatever Parmenides intended, it is clear that the subsequent\nreception of his poem is concerned precisely with the problem sketched\nabove about what does not exist and what is not the case. Numerous\nproscriptions similar to the goddess\u2019s are reported in the\nremainder of the 5th century, though offered by philosophers with\nquite different motivations and agendas, including Protagoras,\nGorgias, the author of pseudo-Hippocratic treatise On the\nArt, Anaxagoras, Metrodorus of Chios, Euthydemus, Cratylus, and\nAntisthenes. In many of these cases, the denial is explicitly\nformulated as a rejection of the possibility of falsehood, of thinking\nor speaking of what is not the case.\n\nThe sophists Protagoras and Gorgias are of particular interest.\nAccording to Plato, Protagoras held that one cannot believe what is\nnot and that whatever one experiences is true (Theaetetus\n167a). This fits snugly with Protagoras\u2019\nwidely attested doctrine that each human being is \u201cthe measure\nof all things,\u201d which, on any interpretation, excludes the\npossibility of error. But Protagoras\u2019 endorsement reveals an\ninteresting subtlety in the Parmenidean thesis that what is not cannot\nbe thought about \u2013 or more positively, the thesis that if\nsomething is had in mind, it must be. The goddess in Parmenides\u2019\npoem uses this thesis in a negative fashion, moving from the\nassumption that certain things \u2018are not\u2019 to the\nparadoxical conclusion that we cannot actually think about them\neither. But one might equally use it in a positive fashion, as\nProtagoras seems to have done, to move from the assumption that we\ncan in fact think of such things to the conclusion that they\nmust in fact \u2018be\u2019, i.e. exist or obtain, after all. In\nitself, the Parmenidean thesis only makes a conditional claim, and\nprima facie it seems open to employ either modus\ntollens or modus ponens. Depending on whether one\nretains commonplace assumptions about what we can think or about what\nthere is in the world, the Parmenidean thesis can lead to either a\nbloated ontology or a very restricted psychology.\n\nGorgias challenges this thesis in his treatise On Not Being\n(preserved in two slightly different versions in the\npseudo-Aristotelian On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias and\nin Sextus Empiricus\u2019 Adversus Mathematicos VII 65 ff.).\nIt takes direct aim at Eleatic assumptions, and especially those of\nParmenides, by arguing that (i) there isn\u2019t anything; (ii) even\nif there is something, it cannot be known; and finally, (iii) even if\nsomething can be known, one could not inform anyone of this. The\nsecond part is of particular interest, since Gorgias offers a\nreductio ad absurdum of the Parmenidean thesis, especially\nwhen deployed in the positive way we have just seen in Protagoras.\nGiven that we obviously can have in mind, for example, a chariot-team\nracing on the sea \u2013 in fact, just by reading this, you have put\nit in mind \u2013 it should follow from the Parmenidean thesis that\nthere is a chariot-team racing on the sea; but (pace\nProtagoras) plainly there is not. If both these intuitions are\nmaintained, the only option left is to reject the Parmenidean thesis\nitself: it is not the case that one can only think or speak\nof what is \u2013 thought is not so tightly bound to reality. Gorgias\nimmediately goes on to argue for a sceptical conclusion, on the\ngrounds that we have no basis for telling which mental states\ncorrespond to reality and which do not, and so cannot know anything at\nall. But this further argument rests on having shown that our ordinary\nintuitions about what we can think and what exists or obtains together\nundermine the Parmenidean thesis. (For further discussion, see Caston\n2002a)\n\nWhy should anyone be tempted by the Parmenidean thesis in the first\nplace? A simple intuition may lie behind it, namely, that thought\nconsists in a direct relation to what is thought about (and\nmutatis mutandis for other mental states and what they are\nabout). For given that a relation cannot obtain unless all its relata\nexist or obtain, it will follow that we cannot ever think of what does\nnot exist or obtain (\u201cwhat is not\u201d). To the extent that\nthis direct relational model has a grip on us, we will be forced to\neither Parmenidean or Protagorean conclusions. In fact, we can\nreformulate these assumptions together as an inconsistent triad (using\n\u2018thought\u2019 schematically for mental states more generally,\nand allowing for the ambiguity between \u2018exists\u2019 and\n\u2018obtains\u2019):\n\nThought consists in a direct relation to what is thought\nabout.\nNo relation can obtain unless all its relata exist/obtain.\nSometimes we can think about what does not exist/obtain.\n\n\nEach of these theses possesses a certain intuitive appeal. But taken\ntogether, they are inconsistent, and so at least one has to be given\nup. This does not entirely force our hand, however, since any two of\nthe three are mutually consistent. So there is still room for\ndisagreement among the disputants. As we have seen, some 5th century\nthinkers, including Parmenides himself (on some interpretations) chose\nto maintain (A) and (B), and reject (C). But if this seems too costly,\nas it does to most people, one would need to reject one of the other\ntwo theses instead. An obvious candidate for rejection is (A), that\nthought consists in a direct relation to what is thought about. But\nthere are different ways of going about it. Someone could simply (i)\nreject a relational analysis altogether. But one could also reject (A)\nwhile continuing to accept a relational analysis, so long as (ii) it\ninvolves a relation to something else other than what is\nthought about. Much of the subsequent discussion in ancient philosophy\ncan be seen as an attempt to pursue the latter strategy, (ii), by\nfinding a suitable intermediary: for example, certain Platonists\nappeal to Forms; Aristotle appeals to changes within our body that\nserve as internal representations; the Stoics from Chrysippus onwards\nappeal to abstract semantic objects like propositions; and Epicurus\nappeals to parts of the surfaces of bodies. A third main option,\nthough, would be to retain the direct relational model in (A)\nunchanged, while also preserving the phenomenological intuition in\n(C), and instead abandon the metaphysical assumption in (B), as the\nearliest Stoics did. Whenever one thinks, these Stoics insist, there\nis something that one is thinking about; but it needn\u2019t\nbe anything that exists or obtains. On this Stoic\nview, there are things that do not exist or obtain, which can serve as\nintentional objects of thought and other mental states.\n",
