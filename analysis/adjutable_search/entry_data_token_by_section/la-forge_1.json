    "main_text": "Explanation\n2. Explanation\n\nLa Forge endorsed fully Descartes\u2019 critique of the use of\nfaculties or powers in scholastic explanations. He reported that, for\nexample, many physicians attributed the beating of the heart to a\npulsific faculty of the soul, and added: \n\n\none cannot deny that\nthe heart has a faculty of beating since it does indeed beat \u2026\nhowever, here and in many other places this word [faculty] is useless\nand does nothing to explain how the thing occurs. (H\n183) \n\n\nLikewise he asked: \n\n\ndoes one really explain the cause of\ndiarrhoea, for example, by saying that it results either from the fact\nthat the expulsive faculty of the intestines is irritated or that their\nretentive faculty is weak? Is that not the same as saying, in good\nFrench, that I know nothing about it? (H 217) \n\n\nHe\nargued that all appeals to faculties and powers were nothing more than\nre-descriptions of the phenomena that need to be explained.\n\nIn physiology, La Forge supported an alternative Cartesian model of\nexplanation in terms of parts of matter in motion which, when linked\ntogether by contact action, form a machine.\n\n By the word\n\u201cmachine\u201d one cannot understand anything other than a body\ncomposed of many organic parts, which, united together, combine to\nproduce some movements that they would be incapable of producing if\nthey were separated. (H 173)\n\n This concept of a machine\napplies\n\n not only to watches or other automata \u2026 but to\nthe human body and that of all animals, and even the whole universe\ncould be considered a machine. (H 173)\n\n Accordingly, the\ndisciples of Descartes\n\n try to explain everything that occurs in\nan animal in the same way as the movements of an automaton occur.\n(H 335)\n\n The same principle had been identified by critics of\nCartesianism as one of its major defects rather than one of its\nstrengths.\n\nAssuming that the motions and interactions of parts of matter are\nsufficient to explain the human body, La Forge acknowledges that the explanatory \nenterprise must be hypothetical, and that hypotheses cannot be\nrestricted to what is visible to the naked eye.\n\n We would be very\nignorant if we had to doubt everything that we do not see \u2026 one\nsurely sees that the Sun and the Moon are sometimes in the East\n\u2026 and sometimes in the West, but one has never seen them move\nthere; nevertheless almost no one doubts their movement.\n(H 217)\n\n For similar reasons, one should not reject\nDescartes\u2019 assumptions about parts of matter in motion in the\nhuman body (such as animal spirits or the nerves) simply because, given\ntheir size, they are unobservable. Although Descartes and La Forge were\nattempting to describe parts of the human body and their motions before\nthe invention of the microscope, the methodological issue involved\nwould not have changed even if the threshold of observability had been\nmodified by optical instruments: the Cartesian theory of explanation\nsupported the postulation of unobservable particles of matter to\nexplain visible effects whenever they were thought necessary. Their\nexplanatory role justified their hypothetical postulation.\n\nThis required La Forge to address the topical question about how, and\nthe extent to which, explanatory hypotheses may be confirmed. He\noffered the same solution that was supported by other natural\nphilosophers in the seventeenth century, such as Robert Boyle or\nChristiaan Huygens:\n\n\nHowever, hypotheses are not only probable but also indubitable when\nthey explain something very clearly and easily, when our senses do not\ncontradict them, when reason shows that the phenomenon in question\ncould not occur otherwise and it is deduced from principles that are\ncertain, and when the hypotheses serve not only to explain one single\neffect but many different and even distinct effects; for it would be\nimpossible for hypotheses not to be found defective in some situation\nif they were not true. (H 218)\n\n\nAlthough he exaggerated the degree of certainty that could be\nlegitimately claimed for his hypotheses, La Forge did not claim\nexplicitly that all explanations must be mechanical. He is best\nunderstood as contrasting the emptiness of scholastic explanations,\nwhich were certain but non-explanatory, with the epistemic risks\ninvolved in postulating hypotheses that were at least intelligible\n(since they involved only pieces of matter in motion) and were\nconfirmed indirectly by their explanatory success. The limited choices\navailable among physiological explanations at that time\n(either scholastic faculties, or matter in motion) did not imply any\nconclusion about how the discipline could develop at a later time.\n",
