    "main_text": "Essence and Existence || The Distinction Between Essence and Existence\n3.2 The Distinction Between Essence and Existence\n\nSo the analysis of being reveals two meanings of existence: the first\naffirms or establishes the existence of something; the second\nexpresses, without affirming its existence, the reality by\nvirtue of which something is what it is, namely, its essence.\nThe first is what Avicenna calls \u201cthe existence related to the\nfact that [something] is established\u201d (al-wu\u01e7\u016bd\nal-i\u1e6fb\u0101t\u012b), the second identifies the\n\u201cparticular\u201d or \u201cproper existence\u201d of the\nthing (al-wu\u01e7\u016bd al-\u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63). As\nregards the latter, one is either not required to know whether the\nthing is or is not existent or else one ignores the whole question. In\nthe first sense, then, the \u201cexistent\u201d (or\n\u201cexisting\u201d) thing stands for \u201cwhat is\nestablished\u201d (al-mu\u1e6fbat) or\n\u201crealized\u201d (al-mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al) and\naffirms that something exists; in the second sense, which is\nexpressed by \u201cproper existence\u201d, what is referred to is\nthe \u201creality\u201d (al-\u1e25aq\u012bqa),\n\u201cnature\u201d (al-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfa),\n\u201cessence\u201d (al-\u1e0f\u0101t) or\u2014according\nto Avicenna\u2019s technical terminology\u2014\u201cquiddity\u201d\n(m\u0101hiyya) or \u201cthingness\u201d\n(\u0161ay\u02beiyya) of the thing. Here no existential judgment\nis implied (one does not know if the thing exists); what is expressed\nis an intentional note, independent of its existence, which\nnecessarily accompanies it (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 31,\n1\u20139).\n\nThe background of this distinction is Aristotelian. In a very broad\nsense its origin can be discovered in Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics (II \u0392 92b10)\u2014where the question that asks\n\u201cif a thing exists\u201d is separate from the one that\nasks \u201cwhat a thing is\u201d\u2014in the\nMetaphysics (\u0394 V.5, 1015a20\u2013b15; 7,\n1017a7\u2013b10; but also \u0395 and Z)\u2014where the various\nmeanings of \u201cbeing\u201d are differentiated and the question of\nessence (ousia, to ti en einai) is posed\u2014and in De\ninterpretatione 11 21a25\u20138; Lizzini 2003; Menn 2013).\nMoreover, although original in its development Avicenna\u2019s\ndistinction uses terms and concepts that can be found in both the\nphilosophical and the theological traditions of classical Islam: in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Book of Letters (K.\nal-\u1e24ur\u016bf; cf. Menn 2008), in Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn\n\u02bfAd\u012b\u2019s discussion of natures (Rashed 2004; Benevich\n2018 and 2019; Janos 2020) and also in the distinctions of\nMu\u02bftazilite Kal\u0101m, in which a \u201cthing\u201d was\nconceived of as separate from existence (Jolivet 1984; Wisnovsky\n2003a).\n",
