    "main_text": "Sexual Ethics\n4. Sexual Ethics\nWhile Ehrenfels\u2019 treatise on sexual ethics of 1907 might\nunderstandably be considered extremely controversial and inappropriate\nby today\u2019s standards, it was much less so at the time it was\nwritten. Most of the seemingly radical ideas and proposals were\nrelatively popular and widespread in educated society at the time, and\nthe controversial nature of his article is rather due to the original\nway in which Ehrenfels combines and connects them, taking them to\nconsiderably farther reaching conclusions (compare Dickinson 2002,\n265\u2013268). The general tenor of this treatise was already anticipated in\nliterary form by Ehrenfels\u2019 choral drama Siegmar und\nHeliea from 1898/1899 (see PSII, 28 ff.).\nEhrenfels aimed at a recuperation of a \u201cnatural sexual\nmorality\u201d, which would preserve and advance the healthy\nconstitution of a species, as opposed to the cultural sexual morality\nof his time, which would instead corrupt it (Ehrenfels 1907, 8). This\ncould be effected by recognizing that the main biological function of\nthe sexual drive, namely reproduction, is not the only one. Sexuality also\nserves selection, not in the sense of natural selection as survival of\nthe fittest, but selection aimed at ensuring reproduction by the best,\nleading to the progressive improvement of the species (Ehrenfels 1907,\n9 ff.). This selection is the first and foremost function of male sex\ndrive, which is why Ehrenfels speaks of \u201cvirile selection\u201d\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 79, compare Dickinson 2002, 258). Since according to\nEhrenfels males represent the active sex, not just among humans, but\n\u201cin the entire bisexual animal kingdom\u201d, and the\nfemales\u2019 sex drive is only operative as a response to the\nmales\u2019, the male sex drive is the biologically more important\none, and hence the basis for re-establishing the natural sexual\nmorality.\nAs the males\u2019 sex drive exceeds the females\u2019, the males\nwill and should compete with one another for the possibility of\nreproducing with as many females as possible (Ehrenfels 1907, 46). For\na sexually well-endowed man (\u201ceinen sexual\nvollkr\u00e4ftigen Mann\u201d), it is advisable\nto have regular, pleasurable intercourse with healthy women or girls\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 62), leading to polygyny, which is the only\n\u201chealthy natural sexual life\u201d (Ehrenfels 1907, 13). For\nEhrenfels, this would actually present a \u201csolution to virtually\nall the major problems confronting European societies\u201d (Dickinson\n2002, 257) in his time. Thanks to competition and polygyny, only the\nbest males will reproduce and will do so in greater numbers than in a\nmonogamous culture, in which virile selection is absent (Ehrenfels\n1907, 11, 30) and where knights and knaves alike rule as lords in their\nfamilies. Conversely, since monandric women have more children than\npolyandric ones (Ehrenfels 1907, 14), and men will only want to care\nfor children that they can be sure to have fathered, females should\nremain monandric and even avoid serial polyandry (Ehrenfels 1907, 12).\nBesides the biological reasons, another concern for Ehrenfels is the\nwell-being of the children in successive marriages, i.e., serial\npolyandry, which would destroy the trust among parents and children, as\na stepfather and alimony would never be a satisfactory replacement\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 68).\nAccording to Ehrenfels, women would remain so impressed and\noverwhelmed by their first sexual experience, that not even the hottest\nfires of passion will ever consume that memory, and hence they should\navoid pre-marital sex to ensure future happiness in married life\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 65). On the other hand, abstinence is not suitable for\nmen, who should certainly have some previous experience so as to be\nfully aware of their sexual duties and to avoid becoming hypersensitive\nto intimate physical contact (Ehrenfels 1907, 69). Nevertheless, the\nyouth should abstain from sex, not just actual but also fantasized, for\nmoral and hygienical reasons until reaching full sexual maturity\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 61). What Ehrenfels considered \u201cunnatural\u201d\nsexual activities, such as masturbation and homosexuality, should be\navoided and condemned, although they can be tolerated as long as they\ndo not damage anyone\u2019s health (Ehrenfels 1907, 56). Indeed,\nautoeroticism, when practiced in moderation, does not cause any\nnoticeable harm (Ehrenfels 1907, 61), and both autoeroticism and\nhomosexual relationships among females, being the passive sex, would\nnot be as harmful as among men, and can hence be considered as lighter\ntransgressions (Ehrenfels 1907, 16).\nMonogamy, however, is a serious danger to the well-being of society,\naccording to Ehrenfels. Not only does a monogamous society morally and\nlegally sanction (Ehrenfels 1907, 78), even \u201csanctify\u201d\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 81), female possessiveness and jealousy, by\nestablishing an unnatural and merely culturally justified exclusive\nright on the father of her children (Ehrenfels 1907, 79), but also\nthereby engenders all kinds of sexual corruption and general\ndegenerations. By enforcing an unnatural sexual morality, it leads to\ndouble standards (Dickinson 2002, 259), where men are driven by their\nsexuality to prostitutes, pornophilia and hyperaesthesia. Due to the\ndemand their appetites generate, men who buy sexual satisfaction are\ncomplicit in the human trade and the corruption of young women who\nenter into prostitution, though it would go too far to forbid\nprostitution altogether (Ehrenfels 1907, 62). The natural sex drive of\nmen, which cannot be satisfied through monogamy, drifts into extremes,\nboth toward pornophilia (\u201cdie Freude am\nSchweinischen\u201d), i.e., pure sensualistic, even animalistic\nstimulation, disregarding the function of reproduction, through\nmasturbation or in brothels (with all the risks of STDs), and in the\nother direction toward incessant search for variety and exotic\neroticisms (Ehrenfels 1907, 49).\nThe one positive side effect of monogamy is that it has led to the\n\u201csublimation of sexual affects\u201d, as modern psychology has\nit, among sexually frustrated males. Since males cannot find full\nsatisfaction for their sex drive in monogamous marriage, they divert\ntheir superfluous energy into other pursuits, such as cultural\nachievements of various sorts: \u201caccumulation of ownership and\npossessions, economical and social organization, artistic and\nscientific achievements, indeed in works of charity and neighborly\nlove\u201d (Ehrenfels 1907, 31).\nEhrenfels connects these themes of gender and sexuality to larger\nissues of economy, sociology and politics. For instance, while\nhistorically the institution of monogamy enabled women (and their\nchildren) to join the workforce as partners in the family business\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 37), the changing economical situation, which favors\nlarger enterprises, puts monogamy at a distinct disadvantage by\nlimiting the opportunities for married women to work. This also\nnegatively affects the overall composition and growth of the workforce,\nsince the advanced techniques available for family planning (Ehrenfels\n1907, 42 ff.) and the rising age (especially among the higher educated)\nat which couples marry and have children, leads to lower birthrates\n(Ehrenfels 1907, 35 ff.). Monogamy, Ehrenfels argues, leads to a\ndecrease both in quality as well as the quantity of the population\n(compare Dickinson 2002, 259), and hence a deficit in the workforce\nthat can be compensated for only through immigration (Ehrenfels 1907,\n43). This has repercussions on a global scale, because Ehrenfels\nfeared, as many did at the time, the competition of other races,\nspecifically the \u201cMongolian\u201d or yellow race. In particular\nthe Chinese would be an indomitable competitor economically, as they\ncould sink wages by offering lower cost labor thanks to their greater\nnumber and fertility (Ehrenfels 1907, 86 ff.). The \u201cMongol\ntsunami\u201d (\u201cMongolenflut\u201d) would interrupt\ncultural development for centuries and for Ehrenfels the only\nremedy was to adopt his newly developed sexual ethics as soon as\npossible in order to increase quantity and quality of the population.\nEhrenfels regarded his reform as absolutely crucial for humanity at\nlarge in the long term, noting that in the end also the Mongol hordes\nwould have to adopt it, when they would eventually face the same\nproblems down the road (Ehrenfels 1907, 94).\n\nEhrenfels had the opportunity to present his proposal in the Vienna\nPsychoanalytic Society on December 23, 1908, where Isidor Sadger\nobserved not only that \u201call of this seems like an adolescent\nsexual fantasy\u201d, but more significantly that behind\nEhrenfels\u2019 views there would seem to be a personal history,\nregarding the author\u2019s own sexuality (cf. Dickinson 2002,\n268\u2013270). In reply to this, Ehrenfels pointed out that his\nproposal had grown out of the realization that it was not necessarily\nhe who needed to curb his sex drive, but that the dominant morality\nwas a distortion of the natural one.\n\nThe sexual and social reforms he proposed in numerous articles,\nopinion pieces, and lectures spanning more than a decade (PSII, 30,\nn. 29), were for the most part met with deafening silence (PSII, 35,\n40; Valent 2016, 193).\n",
