    "main_text": "Morality and freedom || Freedom\n5.2 Freedom\n\nThe most important belief about things in themselves that Kant thinks\nonly practical philosophy can justify concerns human freedom. Freedom\nis important because, on Kant\u2019s view, moral appraisal\npresupposes that we are free in the sense that we have the ability to\ndo otherwise. To see why, consider Kant\u2019s example of a man who\ncommits a theft (5:95ff.). Kant holds that in order for this\nman\u2019s action to be morally wrong, it must have been within his\ncontrol in the sense that it was within his power at the time not to\nhave committed the theft. If this was not within his control at the\ntime, then, while it may be useful to punish him in order to shape his\nbehavior or to influence others, it nevertheless would not be correct\nto say that his action was morally wrong. Moral rightness and\nwrongness apply only to free agents who control their actions and have\nit in their power, at the time of their actions, either to act rightly\nor not. According to Kant, this is just common sense.\n\nOn these grounds, Kant rejects a type of compatibilism that he calls\nthe \u201ccomparative concept of freedom\u201d and associates with\nLeibniz (5:96\u201397). (Note that Kant has a specific type of\ncompatibilism in mind, which I will refer to simply as\n\u201ccompatibilism,\u201d although there may be other types of\ncompatibilism that do not fit Kant\u2019s characterization of that\nview). On the compatibilist view, as Kant understands it, I am free\nwhenever the cause of my action is within me. So I am unfree only when\nsomething external to me pushes or moves me, but I am free whenever\nthe proximate cause of my body\u2019s movement is internal to me as\nan \u201cacting being\u201d (5:96). If we distinguish between\ninvoluntary convulsions and voluntary bodily movements, then on this\nview free actions are just voluntary bodily movements. Kant ridicules\nthis view as a \u201cwretched subterfuge\u201d that tries to solve\nan ancient philosophical problem \u201cwith a little quibbling about\nwords\u201d (ibid.). This view, he says, assimilates human freedom to\n\u201cthe freedom of a turnspit,\u201d or a projectile in flight, or\nthe motion of a clock\u2019s hands (5:96\u201397). The proximate\ncauses of these movements are internal to the turnspit, the\nprojectile, and the clock at the time of the movement. This cannot be\nsufficient for moral responsibility.\n\nWhy not? The reason, Kant says, is ultimately that the causes of these\nmovements occur in time. Return to the theft example. A compatibilist\nwould say that the thief\u2019s action is free because its proximate\ncause is inside him, and because the theft was not an involuntary\nconvulsion but a voluntary action. The thief decided to commit the\ntheft, and his action flowed from this decision. According to Kant,\nhowever, if the thief\u2019s decision is a natural phenomenon that\noccurs in time, then it must be the effect of some cause that occurred\nin a previous time. This is an essential part of Kant\u2019s\nNewtonian worldview and is grounded in the a priori laws\n(specifically, the category of cause and effect) in accordance with\nwhich our understanding constructs experience: every event has a cause\nthat begins in an earlier time. If that cause too was an event\noccurring in time, then it must also have a cause beginning in a still\nearlier time, etc. All natural events occur in time and are thoroughly\ndetermined by causal chains that stretch backwards into the distant\npast. So there is no room for freedom in nature, which is\ndeterministic in a strong sense.\n\nThe root of the problem, for Kant, is time. Again, if the\nthief\u2019s choice to commit the theft is a natural event in time,\nthen it is the effect of a causal chain extending into the distant\npast. But the past is out of his control now, in the present. Once the\npast is past, he can\u2019t change it. On Kant\u2019s view, that is\nwhy his actions would not be in his control in the present if they are\ndetermined by events in the past. Even if he could control those past\nevents in the past, he cannot control them now. But in fact past\nevents were not in his control in the past either if they too were\ndetermined by events in the more distant past, because eventually the\ncausal antecedents of his action stretch back before his birth, and\nobviously events that occurred before his birth were never in his\ncontrol. So if the thief\u2019s choice to commit the theft is a\nnatural event in time, then it is not now and never was in his\ncontrol, and he could not have done otherwise than to commit the\ntheft. In that case, it would be a mistake to hold him morally\nresponsible for it.\n\nCompatibilism, as Kant understands it, therefore locates the issue in\nthe wrong place. Even if the cause of my action is internal to me, if\nit is in the past \u2013 for example, if my action today is\ndetermined by a decision I made yesterday, or from the character I\ndeveloped in childhood \u2013 then it is not within my control now.\nThe real issue is not whether the cause of my action is internal or\nexternal to me, but whether it is in my control now. For Kant,\nhowever, the cause of my action can be within my control now only if\nit is not in time. This is why Kant thinks that transcendental\nidealism is the only way to make sense of the kind of freedom that\nmorality requires. Transcendental idealism allows that the cause of my\naction may be a thing in itself outside of time: namely, my noumenal\nself, which is free because it is not part of nature. No matter what\nkind of character I have developed or what external influences act on\nme, on Kant\u2019s view all of my intentional, voluntary actions are\nimmediate effects of my noumenal self, which is causally undetermined\n(5:97\u201398). My noumenal self is an uncaused cause outside of\ntime, which therefore is not subject to the deterministic laws of\nnature in accordance with which our understanding constructs\nexperience.\n\nMany puzzles arise on this picture that Kant does not resolve. For\nexample, if my understanding constructs all appearances in my\nexperience of nature, not only appearances of my own actions, then why\nam I responsible only for my own actions but not for everything that\nhappens in the natural world? Moreover, if I am not alone in the world\nbut there are many noumenal selves acting freely and incorporating\ntheir free actions into the experience they construct, then how do\nmultiple transcendentally free agents interact? How do you integrate\nmy free actions into the experience that your understanding\n constructs?[21]\n In spite of these unsolved puzzles, Kant holds that we can make sense\nof moral appraisal and responsibility only by thinking about human\nfreedom in this way, because it is the only way to prevent natural\nnecessity from undermining both.\n\nFinally, since Kant invokes transcendental idealism to make sense of\nfreedom, interpreting his thinking about freedom leads us back to\ndisputes between the two-objects and two-aspects interpretations of\ntranscendental idealism. On the face of it, the two-objects\ninterpretation seems to make better sense of Kant\u2019s view of\ntranscendental freedom than the two-aspects interpretation. If\nmorality requires that I am transcendentally free, then it seems that\nmy true self, and not just an aspect of my self, must be outside of\ntime, according to Kant\u2019s argument. But applying the two-objects\ninterpretation to freedom raises problems of its own, since it\ninvolves making a distinction between noumenal and phenomenal selves\nthat does not arise on the two-aspects view. If only my noumenal self\nis free, and freedom is required for moral responsibility, then my\nphenomenal self is not morally responsible. But how are my noumenal\nand phenomenal selves related, and why is punishment inflicted on\nphenomenal selves? It is unclear whether and to what extent appealing\nto Kant\u2019s theory of freedom can help to settle disputes about\nthe proper interpretation of transcendental idealism, since there are\nserious questions about the coherence of Kant\u2019s theory on either\ninterpretation.\n",
