    "main_text": "Investigations into the Material A priori || Claims and Obligations\n4. Reinach's Theory of Social Acts\n\n\nIn the Logical Investigations, Husserl developed a thesis\nadvanced by his teacher Brentano to the effect that all mental acts are\nintentional, that is, that they are directed towards an object. Husserl\nmaintained that all intentional experiences are in this sense\n\u2018objectifying acts\u2019.\n\n\nHusserl's account of meaning builds upon this theory. All uses\nof language are, he says, referential. Accordingly, Husserl viewed acts\nsuch as questions or commands as masked assertions. The command\n\u201csit down on the chair\u201d he interpreted as a statement to\nthe effect that \u201cyour sitting down on the chair is my current\nrequest.\u201d\n\n\nIt was in critical reaction to such theses that Reinach developed\nhis theory of social acts (Smith 1990), a theory which bears\nstriking similarities to the theory of speech acts later developed by\nAustin and Searle.\n\n\nBoth promising and communicating one's intention to do\nsomething, according to Reinach, belong to the category of what he\ncalls \u201cspontaneous\u201d acts, i.e. acts which involve a\nsubject's bringing something about within his own psychic sphere,\nas contrasted with passive experiences of, say, feeling a pain or\nhearing an explosion (1913, p. 706, Eng. p. 18). Certain types of\nspontaneous act are such as to require as a matter of necessity a\nlinguistic utterance or some other overt performance of a non-natural\nand rule-governed sort. This does not hold of judging or deciding, nor\neven of forgiving, but it does hold of apologizing, commanding, or\naccusing. We may accordingly divide spontaneous acts into two classes,\nwhich we might call internal and external, according to whether the\nact's being brought to overt expression is a separable or an\ninseparable moment of the relevant complex whole.\n\n\nActs are divided further into self-directable and\nnon-self-directable. Self-directable acts are such that the subject\ntoward whom they are directed may be identical with the subject of the\nact (as in cases of self-pity, self-hatred, etc.). Non-self-directable\nacts, on the other hand, such as forgiving or praying, demand an alien\nsubject. A peculiarity of certain external and non-self-directable acts\nis that the relevant utterance must of necessity be\nnot only directed toward a certain subject but also registered or\ngrasped by this subject in a further act: a command must be received\nand understood by those to whom it is addressed (something which does\nnot apply, for example, to an act of blessing or cursing). It is part\nof the essential structure of a command that it be an action of a\nsubject which is spontaneous, intentional, non-self-directable and in\nneed of being grasped by the subject towards whom it is addressed. The\nsame holds also of requests, admonishments, questionings, informings,\nanswerings, and many other types of act. (Reinach 1913, p. 707, Eng.\npp. 19f.) Each social act constitutes an inner unity of deliberate\nexecution and deliberate utterance. The experience is here impossible\nin the absence of the utterance. And the utterance for its part is not\nsomething that is added to the experience as an incidental extra; it\nstands in the service of the social act and is necessary in order that\nthe latter should fulfill its announcing function.\n\n\nReinach mentions many social acts in his treatise on \u201cThe\nA Priori Foundations of the Civil Law\u201d\n(1913)\u2014commanding, requesting, warning, questioning and\nanswering, informing, enacting, revoking, transferring, granting, and\nwaiving of claims\u2014but he devotes the most attention to the act\nof promising. Drawing on the theory of essences or intrinsically\nintelligible structures referred to above, Reinach offers the\nfollowing examples of a priori truths about what he sees as\nthe intrinsically intelligible structure instantiated through the\nperformance of a promising act:\n\nthrough promising one incurs an obligation;\nby receiving a promise one has a claim to what was promised;\nsuch claims are extinguished when the promise is fulfilled;\nsuch claims may also be extinguished if the claimholder waives the\nclaim;\npromising is subject to a range of variations or modifications,\nincluding conditional promising, promising on behalf of or as a\nrepresentative of someone else, promising to a group, promising by a\ngroup, and so forth.\n\n\n\nReinach maintains that such truths are not merely necessary and\nuniversal, but also informative, thus that they are examples of truths\nthat are both a priori and synthetic.\n\n\nReinach's views are in this respect opposed to those of Searle\n(1969), who argued that promising is a social institution that can be\nexplained in terms of so-called constitutive rules analogous to the\nrules of chess (Zaibert and Smith 2007). Once one stipulates the\nrules, on this account, then certain necessary truths can be derived.\nReinach, in contrast, held that promising is a sui generis\nphenomenon that is not invented but rather discovered, as is seen in\nthe contrast between promising and those elements of a code of law\nwhich truly are constructed, for example specific rules concerning\nprimogeniture or the discharging of liens. Reinach speculates that an\nindividual who orally contracts to rent a piece of property for three\nyears may be surprised to learn that, in German law, this contract is\nmade for an \u201cindefinite length of time.\u201d In contrast,\nsomeone who waives a claim will hardly be surprised by the fact that\nthe claim is now extinguished. The latter, in Reinach's terms,\nflows from the very essence of a claim and of the act of waiving a\nclaim, and in this it contrasts sharply with the non-intuitive\narbitrariness of the rules of chess.\n\n\nReinach next surveys Hume, who familiarly provides an account of why\na promise is binding which rests on the idea that there is a certain\nsort of sui generis experience which becomes expressed in a\npromise and which is somehow binding on the subject but which is at the\nsame time analogous to experiences of resolving, wishing, willing in\nthat it can be present also without any accompanying\nexpression. Reinach rejects this account \u2013 denying that such an\nexperience could exist \u2013 and rejects also a variety of other\npsychologistic and consequentialistic theories because they are, he\nclaims, seeking an explanation of a phenomenon so basic that it cannot\nbe further elucidated in terms of anything more simple. As he himself\nexpresses it:\n\n\nStrictly speaking, we are not proposing any theory of\npromising. For we are only putting forward the simple thesis that\npromising as such produces claim and obligation. One can try, and we\nhave in fact tried, to bring out the intelligibility of this thesis by\nanalysis and clarification. To try to explain it would be just like\ntrying to explain the proposition, 1 \u00d7 1 = 1. It is a fear of what is\ndirectly given, a strange reluctance or incapacity to look the ultimate\ndata in the face and to recognize them as such, that has driven\nunphenomenological philosophies, in this as in so many other more\nfundamental problems, to untenable and ultimately to extravagant\nconstructions. (1913, p. 46)\n\n\nIn this passage, Reinach summarizes his view not only of promising,\nbut also of phenomenological philosophy itself. The central task of\nphenomenology is to describe faithfully what is given in experience,\npreferring knowledge that is immediate and intuitive to that which is\nknown indirectly through deduction or other means.\n",
