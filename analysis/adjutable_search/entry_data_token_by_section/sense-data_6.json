    "main_text": "Sense Data Recently\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe core notion of a sense datum is an immediately given, minimal\nperceptual object, consisting in the case of vision of a shaped patch\nof color. Often, but not always, this datum was considered to be two\ndimensional. It typically was contrasted with the perception of a\nthree-dimensional material object of a particular kind and displaying\na panoply of further properties. In the classical period (the first\nseveral decades of the twentieth century), sense data were typically\ntaken to be non-mental and mind-independent, and were often regarded\nas representing material objects. In some cases, sense data or their\nkin were taken to be elemental constituents in the composition or\nbundling of sense particulars. These particulars did not refer to\nmaterial objects per se but, when conjoined, composed a perceptual\nworld (as in Russell 1914a and 1914b). More recently, sense data have\nbeen viewed as mental items (e.g., Jackson 1977), and perhaps as\nleading to idealism (Robinson 1994). In a few cases, sense data have\nbeen equated with portions of the surface of a material object (Moore\n1918\u201319: 23\u201324; Berm\u00fadez 2000).\n\nThe theory of sense data is a species of a genera of positions in\nperception theory, which make a distinction between an impoverished\nsense impression and the perception, affirmation, or judgment of a\nfurther entity, usually a material object. Although sharing this\ndistinction, other species in this genus differ from sense-data theory\nin various ways, the most fundamental being that they do not posit an\nobject having the properties of color and shape as found in conscious\nperception\n (item 3).\n Some views render perceived properties as appearances. One type of\nappearance theory holds that shape, color, and other perceived\nobject-properties are intentional contents (intentionalism). Another\ntype holds that experiences of shapes and colors are manners or modes\nof perceiving (adverbialism). Adherents of both types of theory reject\nthe act-object analysis and so would reject item 8 of the Classical\nNotion; and, of course, they would also reject items 1 and 2. In\nanother vein, some versions of na\u00efve realism hold that we\nimmediately perceive the surface of an object from a point of view and\nin three dimensions, and then augment the basic perception to include\nconceptualized object content (No\u00eb 2004, Brewer 2011). At\npresent, these various positions enjoy more favor than do theories\nthat posit sense data as mental objects or as third things. Indeed,\nrecent discussions in the philosophy of perception frequently use\nsense data as an example of a concept or an entity to be avoided\n(e.g., Fish 2010: ch. 2).\n\nTheories that distinguish impoverished sense perception from object\nperception and cognition have been challenged by what Firth\n(1949\u201350) called the \u201cpercept theory\u201d, according to\nwhich immediate visual experience is of a three-dimensional visual\nworld that manifests object-properties and possibilities for action.\nThis is the tradition of James, the Gestalt psychologists, Gibson, and\nsome of the appearance theories (e.g., Smith 2002). Such theories have\ngrown in favor recently. But sense-data theories have also shown\ndevelopment. Many sense-data theories recognize the immediate objects\nof perception to be three-dimensional. This would permit a penny seen\nat a moderate slant to be described as appearing as a circle at a\nslant, not an ellipse. Finally, although treatment of color as a\nprimitive property that literally inheres in sense data (whether such\ndata are considered to be surface portions, mental objects, or third\nthings) is not widely favored, it is also true that, metaphysically,\nthere is no settled home for phenomenally experienced color. The\nendeavor to account for the phenomenal characteristics of objects and\ntheir properties is ongoing.\n",
