    "main_text": "Alternative Conceptions of Justification || Ordinary Language Dissolution\n5.2 Ordinary Language Dissolution\n\nRather than allowing undefended empirical postulates to give normative\nsupport to an inductive inference, one could instead argue for a\ncompletely different conception of what is involved in justification.\nLike Wittgenstein, later ordinary language philosophers, notably P.F.\nStrawson, also questioned what exactly it means to ask for a\njustification of inductive inferences (Strawson 1952). This has become\nknown as the \u201cOrdinary language dissolution\u201d of the\nproblem of induction.\n\nStrawson points out that it could be meaningful to ask for a deductive\njustification of inductive inferences. But it is not clear that this\nis helpful since this is effectively \u201ca demand that induction\nshall be shown to be really a kind of deduction\u201d (Strawson 1952:\n230). Rather, Strawson says, when we ask about whether a particular\ninductive inference is justified, we are typically judging whether it\nconforms to our usual inductive standards. Suppose, he says, someone\nhas formed the belief by inductive inference that All\nf\u2019s are g. Strawson says that if that person\nis asked for their grounds or reasons for holding that belief,\n\n\nI think it would be felt to be a satisfactory answer if he replied:\n\u201cWell, in all my wide and varied experience I\u2019ve come\nacross innumerable cases of f and never a case of f\nwhich wasn\u2019t a case of g\u201d. In saying this, he is\nclearly claiming to have inductive support,\ninductive evidence, of a certain kind, for his belief.\n(Strawson 1952)\n\n\nThat is just because inductive support, as it is usually understood,\nsimply consists of having observed many positive instances in a wide\nvariety of conditions.\n\nIn effect, this approach denies that producing a chain of reasoning is\na necessary condition for justification. Rather, an inductive\ninference is justified if it conforms to the usual standards of\ninductive justification. But, is there more to it? Might we not ask\nwhat reason we have to rely on those inductive standards?\n\nIt surely makes sense to ask whether a particular inductive inference\nis justified. But the answer to that is fairly straightforward.\nSometimes people have enough evidence for their conclusions and\nsometimes they do not. Does it also make sense to ask about whether\ninductive procedures generally are justified? Strawson draws the\nanalogy between asking whether a particular act is legal. We may\nanswer such a question, he says, by referring to the law of the\nland.\n\n\nBut it makes no sense to inquire in general whether the law of the\nland, the legal system as a whole, is or is not legal. For to what\nlegal standards are we appealing? (Strawson 1952: 257)\n\n\nAccording to Strawson,\n\n\nIt is an analytic proposition that it is reasonable to have a degree\nof belief in a statement which is proportional to the strength of the\nevidence in its favour; and it is an analytic proposition, though not\na proposition of mathematics, that, other things being equal, the\nevidence for a generalisation is strong in proportion as the number of\nfavourable instances, and the variety of circumstances in which they\nhave been found, is great. So to ask whether it is reasonable to place\nreliance on inductive procedures is like asking whether it is\nreasonable to proportion the degree of one\u2019s convictions to the\nstrength of the evidence. Doing this is what \u201cbeing\nreasonable\u201d means in such a context. (Strawson 1952:\n256\u201357)\n\n\nThus, according to this point of view, there is no further question to\nask about whether it is reasonable to rely on inductive\ninferences.\n\nThe ordinary language philosophers do not explicitly argue against\nHume\u2019s\n premise P8.\n But effectively what they are doing is offering a whole different\nstory about what it would mean to be justified in believing the\nconclusion of inductive inferences. What is needed is just conformity\nto inductive standards, and there is no real meaning to asking for any\nfurther justification for those.\n\nThe main objection to this view is that conformity to the usual\nstandards is insufficient to provide the needed justification. What we\nneed to know is whether belief in the conclusion of an inductive\ninference is \u201cepistemically reasonable or justified in the sense\nthat \u2026there is reason to think that it is likely to be\ntrue\u201d (BonJour 1998: 198). The problem Hume has raised is\nwhether, despite the fact that inductive inferences have tended to\nproduce true conclusions in the past, we have reason to think the\nconclusion of an inductive inference we now make is likely to be true.\nArguably, establishing that an inductive inference is rational in the\nsense that it follows inductive standards is not sufficient to\nestablish that its conclusion is likely to be true. In fact Strawson\nallows that there is a question about whether \u201cinduction will\ncontinue to be successful\u201d, which is distinct from the question\nof whether induction is rational. This question he does take to hinge\non a \u201ccontingent, factual matter\u201d (Strawson 1952: 262).\nBut if it is this question that concerned Hume, it is no answer to\nestablish that induction is rational, unless that claim is understood\nto involve or imply that an inductive inference carried out according\nto rational standards is likely to have a true conclusion.\n",
