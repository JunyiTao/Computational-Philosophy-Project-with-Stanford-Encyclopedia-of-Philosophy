Parapsychology and Near-Death Experiences\n\nDuring the heyday of logical positivism in the twentieth century, it\nis interesting that while Moritz Schlick proposed that its demands for\nempirical verification would render propositions about God as\nmeaningless, it would not rule out as meaningless propositions about\nlife after death so long as they involved subjects having experiences.\nInterestingly, some of the most rigid materialists in the last\ncentury, such as Willard Van Orman Quine and Paul Churchland, allowed\nfor the possibility of there being compelling empirical evidence of\nparapsychological powers and even ghosts. In this section, let us\nconsider whether there is empirical support for belief in an\nafterlife.\n\nParapsychology investigates phenomena that are alleged to lie outside\nthe boundaries of ordinary naturalistic explanation. These phenomena\ninclude telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, mediumistic messages,\npossession-type cases, reincarnation-type cases, apparitions, and\nothers. Not all of these phenomena are directly relevant to survival\nand the afterlife, but some of them, if accepted as veridical, do\nprovide such evidence: for instance, messages received through a\nmedium, allegedly from a deceased person, that contain information to\nwhich the medium has no other access.\n\nThe evaluation of this body of evidence is highly contentious. Clearly\nthere exists both motive and opportunity for fraud and fabrication in\nmany cases. It is questionable, though, whether a responsible inquirer\ncan afford to dismiss out of hand all cases that seem to defy ordinary\nnaturalistic explanation. It counts against a sweeping dismissive\napproach that the phenomena have been attested as probably veridical\nby some highly reputable investigators, including such philosophers as\nWilliam James, Henry Sidgwick, C.D. Broad, H.H. Price and John Beloff.\nThese men had little to gain personally by their investigations;\nindeed in undertaking them they endangered already well-established\nreputations. Investigating the subject with finely-honed critical\ninstincts, they have applied stringent tests in selecting instances\nthey consider to be credible, and have rejected many cases they held\nto be fraudulent or inadequately attested.\n\nIf we are willing to give an initial hearing to this evidence, what\nconclusions can reasonably be reached? A conclusion that many (but not\nall) of these investigators would accept is that the evidence provides\nsome, but not conclusive, evidence for personal survival after death\n(Steinkamp 2002). However, the reason why the evidence is deemed\ninconclusive will give little comfort to many afterlife skeptics. The\nreason it is not conclusive is that the experiences are susceptible of\na different explanation if we accept the existence of some rather\nspectacular forms of extra-sensory perception, also known as\n\u201csuper psi\u201d (see Braude 2002). An example is a case in\nwhich a medium received information that apparently was known in its\nentirety to no living person. In order to avoid the conclusion that\nthe information was communicated from the deceased person, the medium\nmust be credited with clairvoyance as well as the ability to integrate\ninformation received telepathically from several different persons.\nC.D. Broad (1953: 114) summarized the situation well: the possibility\nof extra-sensory perception weakens the direct force of the evidence\nfor survival by making possible alternative explanations of that\nevidence. But ESP strengthens the overall case by raising the\nantecedent probability of survival, insofar as it renders problematic\nthe naturalistic view of the human person, which for most\ncontemporaries constitutes the greatest obstacle to belief in\nsurvival.\n\nMore recently, it has been claimed that a superior source of evidence\nlies in so-called \u201cnear-death experiences\u201d (Bailey and\nYates (eds.) 1996). These are experiences of persons who were, or\nperceived themselves to be, close to death; indeed many such persons\nmet the criteria for clinical death. While in this state, they undergo\nremarkable experiences, often taken to be experiences of the world\nthat awaits them after death. Returning to life, they testify to their\nexperiences, claiming in many cases to have had their subsequent lives\ntransformed as a result of the near-death experience. This testimony\nmay seem especially compelling in that (a) large numbers of persons\nreport having had such experiences; (b) the experiences come\nspontaneously to those near death, they are not sought out or\ndeliberately induced; and (c) normally no one stands to benefit\nfinancially from either the experiences or the reports.\n\nThese experiences, furthermore, are not random in their contents.\nThere are recurring elements that show up in many of these accounts,\nforming a general (but far from invariable) pattern. Typical elements\ninclude a sense of being dead, peacefulness and absence of pain;\n\u201cout-of-body experiences\u201d in which the subject views his\nor her own body \u201cfrom outside\u201d and witnesses various\nevents, sometimes at a considerable distance from the location of the\nperson\u2019s body; passing through a dark tunnel towards intense\nlight; meeting \u201cbeings of light\u201d (sometimes including\nfriends and relatives who have died previously); and a \u201clife\nreview\u201d in which the events of one\u2019s life pass before one\nand are subjected to evaluation. The subject may be initially\ndisappointed or reluctant to return to the body, and (as already\nnoted) many testify that the experience has been life-changing,\nleading to a lessened\u2014or even a complete absence of\u2014fear\nof death and other beneficial results.\n\nThese experiences are surprisingly common. A Gallup poll taken in 1982\nfound that eight million Americans (about five percent of the adult\npopulation at that time) had survived a near-death experience (NDE).\nThe experiences occur regardless of age, social class, race, or\nmarital status. Probably the improvements in medical technology, which\nenable many to return from a state of \u201cclinical death\u201d,\nhave increased the numbers in recent times. But NDEs have been\nreported throughout recorded history and from all corners of the\nearth. Since the publication in 1975 of Raymond Moody\u2019s book,\nLife After Life (1975), there have been numerous studies of\nthe phenomenon, some of them carried out with careful attention to\nscientific objectivity (e.g., Ring 1980; Sabom 1982; van Lommel et\nal. 2001).\n\nAs one might expect, there is a wide variety of interpretations of\nNDEs, from those that interpret the experiences as literally revealing\na state that lies beyond death to interpretations that attempt to\ndebunk the experiences by classifying them as mere reflections of\nabnormal brain states. Clearly, there is no one medical or\nphysiological cause; the experiences occur for persons in a great\nvariety of medical conditions. An interesting counterexample to\nexplanations in terms of the \u201cdying brain\u201d is found in the\nNDEs experienced by mountain climbers in the midst of what they\nexpected to be fatal falls (Heim 1892); it is hardly credible that\nthese experiences can be reduced to either drugs or oxygen\ndeprivation.\n\nOn the other hand, interpretations of NDEs as literally revelatory of\nthe life to come, though common in the popular literature, are\nextremely questionable. Carol Zaleski has shown, through her\ncomparative studies of medieval and modern NDEs, that many features of\nthese experiences vary in ways that correspond to cultural\nexpectations (Zaleski 1987). A striking instance of this is the\nminimal role played by judgment and damnation in modern NDEs; unlike\nthe medieval cases, the modern life-review tends to be therapeutic\nrather than judgmental in emphasis. In view of this, Zaleski ascribes\nthe experiences to the religious imagination, insisting that to do so\nenhances rather than diminishes their significance. Claims of\ncross-cultural invariance in modern NDEs are also questionable. The\nmajority of the research has been done in cultures where Christianity\nis the predominant religious influence, but research done in other\ncultures reveals significantly different patterns. One amusing\ndifference occurs in the episodes in which it is decided that the\nexperiencer will return to embodied life rather than remaining in the\nafterworld. In Western NDEs there is often a \u201cspirit\nguide\u201d who counsels the experiencer that it is better that he or\nshe should return to life. In India, on the other hand, the person is\noften turned back with the information that there has been a clerical\nerror in the paperwork, so that it was by mistake that he or she came\nto this point! (K. Augustine 2008,\n Other Internet Resources,\n see the section on \u201cCultural Differences\u201d).\n\nThe causation of these experiences is problematic. Some aspects of the\nexperience have been deliberately induced by the administration of\ndrugs (see Jansen 1997); this demonstrates that such phenomena can be\nproduced by chemical alterations to the brain, but in most NDE cases\nno such chemical causes can be identified. Several researchers have\nconcluded that the triggering cause of the NDE is simply the perceived\nnearness of death. (NDEs have also been experienced by persons who\nbelieved they were close to death but were not in fact in any\nlife-threatening situation (K. Augustine 2008,\n Other Internet Resources,\n see the section on Pam Reynolds).) The specific content of NDEs can\nbe divided into mundane content, in which what is experienced\nis or resembles typical features of the ordinary world, and\ntranscendental content, portraying \u201canother\nrealm\u201d quite unlike the world of ordinary experience. The source\nof the transcendental content is problematic, though the cultural\nvariations suggest that a significant role must be assigned to\ncultural expectations concerning the afterlife.\n\nFinally, there is what Gary Habermas has termed the\nevidential aspect of NDEs. These are phenomena that, provided\nthey can be verified, would indicate strongly that something is\noccurring that is not susceptible of an ordinary naturalistic\nexplanation. This might seem to be the most helpful direction to look\nif the aim is to arrive at an objectively compelling assessment of\nNDEs. If it should turn out to be possible to verify objectively\ncertain paranormal aspects of NDEs, fully naturalistic explanations\ncould be ruled out and the way would be open for further exploration\nconcerning the meaning of the experiences. On the other hand, if all\nsuch evidential aspects could be fully explained in terms of ordinary\nnatural processes, the claim of NDEs to be revelatory of anything\nmetaphysically significant would be greatly weakened.\n\nEvidential aspects of NDEs fall into several categories. First, there\nare out-of-body sensory experiences, in which patients, often while\ncomatose, observe accurately features to which they have no access\nthrough normal sensory channels. In one case, an eight-year-old girl\nwho nearly drowned required 45 minutes of CPR to restore her\nheartbeat:\n\n\nIn the meantime, she said that she floated out of her body and visited\nheaven. Additionally \u2026 she was able to totally and correctly\nrecount the details from the time the paramedics arrived in her yard\nthrough the work performed later in the hospital emergency room.\n(Moreland and Habermas 1998: 159)\n\n\nSecond, there are accounts of sensory experiences which accurately\nreport events that occurred during periods in which the\nsubject\u2019s heart had stopped, and even during \u201cflat\nEEG\u201d periods in which there was no detectable brain activity.\nFinally, there are \u201csurprise encounters\u201d during the NDE\nwith friends and relatives who had in fact recently died, but where\nthe subject had no knowledge of this prior to the time of the\nexperience. Here the crucial question would be, Where did the subject\nobtain knowledge of the other person\u2019s death? If ordinary\nchannels of communication can be ruled out, the most natural\nconclusion would seem to be that this knowledge was obtained from the\ndeceased person, who is somehow still alive.\n\nAll of these claims concerning the evidential value of NDEs have been\ncalled into question. One of the most thorough discussions is by Keith\nAugustine\n (Other Internet Resources,\n 2008), who draws on work by a large number of other researchers. As\nnoted already, there is overwhelming evidence that NDEs do not provide\na literal experience of conditions in the afterlife; this is attested,\namong other things, by the considerable variations in these\nexperiences in different times and different cultures. Also relevant\nhere is the fact that similar experiences sometimes happen to persons\nwho mistakenly believe themselves to be in life-threatening\ncircumstances. Apparently it is the perceived nearness to\ndeath, rather than the actual proximity of the afterworld, that\ntriggers the experiences. The encounters with persons recently\ndeceased, but whose deaths were previously unknown to the experiencer,\nbecome somewhat less impressive once it is recognized that\nstill-living persons may also be encountered in NDEs (\u201cLiving\nPersons\u201d). These still-living persons were otherwise occupied at\nthe time of the NDEs; they cannot have been literally present in the\nother-worldly realm in which they were encountered. And given that\nstill-living persons can appear in NDEs, it becomes statistically\nprobable that on occasion there will also be encounters with persons\nwho have recently died but whose death was unknown to the\nexperiencer.\n\nClaims that NDEs occurred during periods with no brain activity are\ncountered by the rejoinder that an EEG may not reveal all activity\nwithin the brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, for example,\ncan reveal activity that is missed by an EEG. In cases where brain\nactivity has indeed ceased for a given patient, the NDE may have\noccurred either before the cessation or after normal brain activity\nhas resumed; it is not necessary to assume that the NDE and the\nbrain\u2019s non-activity were simultaneous (\u201cLiving\nPersons\u201d). With respect to the claim of information that was\nlearned during the NDE that was not otherwise available, various\nanswers are possible. It is noted, first of all, that\ninaccurate \u201cinformation\u201d is often reported\n(\u201cOut-of-Body Discrepancies\u201d). In some cases where the\ninformation is confirmed, we may be dealing with subsequent\nenhancement as a result of the repeated recital of the story. (This\nneed not involve deliberate deception; it is a common experience that\nstories often repeated tend to gain new features of interest in the\ntelling.) In other cases, it is argued that the information was in\nfact available through ordinary sensory channels, often through the\nexperiencer\u2019s hearing of things said during a medical procedure\nwhen they were apparently unconscious and unresponsive. (There is\nconsiderable evidence that \u201cunconscious\u201d persons do hear\nand register things said when they are apparently oblivious to their\nsurroundings.) (\u201cVeridical Paranormal Perception During\nOBEs?\u201d) However, it is worth noting that Augustine makes little\neffort to establish that the factors cited in his naturalistic\nexplanations were actually operative in the various NDE cases. It\nwould appear to be his view that the burden of proof lies almost\nentirely on the shoulders of those who make claims on behalf of the\nevidential value of NDEs.\n\nWith regard to this entire body of evidence, both from parapsychology\nand from NDEs, we may be close to an impasse. Those who support the\nevidential value of the experiences will argue that the naturalistic\nexplanations that have been offered are not adequate, that they\ndisplay excessive skepticism towards well-confirmed accounts, and are\nin many instances highly speculative. Those who reject the evidential\nvalue of these phenomena (including some believers in the afterlife)\nwill argue that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the\nextraordinary claims that are made, that the naturalistic explanations\nwork well overall, and that a full explanation of the most puzzling\ncases would require a detailed knowledge of the events and surrounding\ncircumstances that in many cases is not available to us. Further\ncareful research on individual cases may offer some hope of progress,\nbut it seems unlikely that the fundamental disagreements can be\nresolved, especially when the different viewpoints are supported by\ndiverse worldviews. For a thoughtful treatment of NDEs and the\nparanormal as evidence for an afterlife, see Lund 2009 (Part II).\n",
