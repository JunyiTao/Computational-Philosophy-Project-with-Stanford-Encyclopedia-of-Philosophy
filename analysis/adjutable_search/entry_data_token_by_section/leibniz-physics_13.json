    "main_text": "Leibniz on Space and Time\n5. Leibniz on Space and Time\n\n\nIn his Principia, Newton had suggested that the absolute\nmotion of bodies is to be defined relative to absolute space and time,\nand to be discovered by its properties, causes and\n effects.[30]\n Leibniz, as we have just seen, opposed such a view, holding instead\nthat true motions are to be defined with respect to the active forces\nthat he took to be inherent in truly moving bodies. This disagreement\nbetween Newton and Leibniz over the nature of true motion surfaced\nmore explicitly in their disagreement over the nature of space and\ntime in the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence. In the five letters he\nmanaged to write before his death, Leibniz succeeded in articulating\nnot only his reasons for opposing what he took to be Newton\u2019s\nconception of absolute space and time, but also sketching an\nalternative picture according to which they are to be understood as\nabstract systems of relations. \n",
