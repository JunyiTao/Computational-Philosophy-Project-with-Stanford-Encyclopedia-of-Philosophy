    "main_text": "Cognate Phenomena || Pardon and Mercy\n2.4 Pardon and Mercy\n\nThe phrase \u201cpardon me\u201d frequently functions as an apology,\nwhich might precede an act of forgiveness, or be a plea or request for\nforgiveness, or some similar act of forbearance. And to pardon a\nwrongdoer often seems indistinguishable from forgiveness, perhaps\nespecially in cases of minor wrong. However, the concept of pardon\nalso refers to a familiar and important legal and political power\nquite unlike forgiveness. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines this\nsense of pardon as \u201can act or an instance of officially\nnullifying punishment or other legal consequences of a crime\u201d,\nordinarily \u201cgranted by the chief executive of a\ngovernment\u201d (Garner 1999: 1137). In the United States, for\nexample, the President has the authority to grant pardons for federal\noffenses, and state governors may pardon crimes against the state.\n\nAlthough reasons for exercising the power of pardon often mimic those\ngiven for forgiving wrongdoers, one clear difference between pardon\nand forgiving is that the former is typically exercised by\nthird-parties as opposed to the victims of wrong. As discussed below,\nstandard philosophical views maintain that there are good reasons for\nthinking that, with one important exception, third-party forgiveness\nis impossible, inasmuch as forgiveness is the prerogative or right of\nthe victim of wrong.  Another difference is that a central idea in the\nlegal and political concept of pardon is that of an offer that must be\naccepted in order to accomplish its partial or complete end, such as\nmitigation of a criminal punishment via commutation of a prison\nsentence (Bingham 2009). Although on some views forgiveness is also an\noffer, especially where reconciliation between a victim and wrongdoer\nis attempted (Tombs 2008), the main sense of forgiveness seems not to\ninvolve the idea of an offer at all, let alone an offer that must be\naccepted by the wrongdoer in order for forgiveness to occur and\naccomplish at least some of its ends, for example to discharge\none\u2019s duty to forgive others as commanded by God, or to move\nbeyond a potentially paralyzing negative emotion.\n\nFurthermore, acts of mercy in general are to be distinguished from\nacts of forgiveness (Murphy 1988; Murphy & Hampton 1988; Tosi\n& Warmke 2017). First, manifestations of mercy, but not\nforgiveness, are essentially overt. To extend or show mercy to someone\nwho has acted badly is to engage in some overt behavior: a parent may\nlessen a guilty child\u2019s punishment. Forgiveness, however, is not\nnecessarily overt. It is possible to forgive privately; indeed\nphilosophical discussions of forgiveness have focused predominantly on\nits private manifestations. Second, mercy is third-personal in a way\nthat forgiveness is not. A boss may reprimand an employee for telling\nan inappropriate joke in the lunchroom even though termination would\nbe justified and the boss herself is not personally offended by it.\nHere, a third-party shows mercy, and does so (we may presume)\njustifiably. But forgiveness, if it is ever third-personal, is not\nthird-personal in this way. Barring exceptional\ncircumstances, you cannot forgive me for the offense I caused to a\nco-worker\u2014you simply lack the standing to forgive me for my\noffense to her. Mercy is not paradigmatically second-personal\nin this way. Third, mercy is often (if not always) connected to\nauthority in a way that forgiveness is not. It is natural to think\nthat in order for S to show mercy to P, S must be in some\nkind of position of authority over P. Interpersonal forgiveness,\nhowever, is tied to no such authority structures.\n",
