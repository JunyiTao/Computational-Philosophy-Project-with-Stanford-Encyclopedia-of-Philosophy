    "main_text": "Independence\n1. Independence\n\n\nLet us begin with the notion of an axiom system.  To motivate\nthis notion consider the manner in which justification traditionally\nproceeds in mathematics.  In reasoning about a given domain of\nmathematics (or, in fact, any domain) the question of justification is\nsuccessively pushed back further and further until ultimately one\nreaches principles that do not admit more fundamental justification.\nThe statements at this terminal stage are elected as axioms\nand the subject is then organized in terms of derivability from the\nbase of axioms.  In the case of arithmetic this led to the axiom\nsystem PA (Peano arithmetic) and in the case of set theory it led\nto the axiom system ZFC (Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom\nof Choice).\n\n\nTwo natural questions arise: (1) If the axioms do not admit of more\nfundamental justification then how does one justify them?  (2) Is the\nbase of axioms sufficiently rich that one can settle every sentence on\nthis basis?\n\n\nThere are two traditional views concerning the epistemological status\nof axioms.  On the first view the axioms do not admit further\njustification since they are self-evident.  On the second\nview the axioms do not admit further justification since they\nare definitive of the subject matter.  Each of these views\nconcerning our first question leads to an associated optimistic view\nconcerning our second question\u2014according to the first optimistic\nview, all mathematical truths are derivable (in first-order logic)\nfrom self-evident truths, while according to the second optimistic\nview, all mathematical truths are derivable (in first-order logic)\nfrom statements that are definitive of the subject matter.  Should\neither of these optimistic views turn out to be correct, then the\nquestion of justification in mathematics would take on a particularly\nsimple form: Either a statement would be an axiom (in which case it\nwould be self-evident or definitive of the subject matter (depending\non the view under consideration)) or it would be derivable in\nfirst-order logic from some such statements.\n\n\nUnfortunately, these optimistic views came to be challenged in 1931 by\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.  Here is one version of the second\nincompleteness theorem:\n\nTheorem 1.1\n(G\u00f6del, 1931). \nAssume that PA is consistent.  Then\nPA does not prove Con(PA).\n\n\n\nHere Con(PA) is a statement of arithmetic that expresses the informal\nstatement that PA is consistent.[1]\nUnder slightly stronger assumptions (for\nexample, that PA is \u03a301-sound[2]) one can\nstrengthen the conclusion by adding that PA does not prove\n\u00acCon(PA); in other words, under this stronger assumption,\nCon(PA) is independent of PA.  Thus, we have here a\ncase of a statement of arithmetic (and, in fact, a very simple one)\nthat cannot be settled on the basis of the standard axioms.  Moreover,\nthe theorem is completely general\u2014it holds not just for PA but\nfor any sufficiently strong formal system T.\n\n\nThis raises a challenge for the two aforementioned optimistic views\nconcerning the nature of mathematical truth.  To begin with it shows\nthat we cannot work with a fixed axiom system T.  We will\nalways need to introduce new axioms.  More importantly, it raises the\nquestion of how one is to justify these new axioms, for as one\ncontinues to add stronger and stronger axioms the claim that they are\neither self-evident or definitive of the subject matter will grow\nincreasingly more difficult to defend.\n\n\nAlready in 1931 G\u00f6del pointed out a natural way to justify new\naxioms.  He pointed out that if one moves beyond the natural numbers\nand climbs the hierarchy of types (the sets of natural numbers, the\nsets of sets of natural numbers, etc.) one arrives at axioms (the\naxioms of second-order arithmetic PA2, the axioms of third-order\narithmetic PA3, etc.) that settle the undecided statements that he\ndiscovered.  The axiom system for the second level, PA2, settles\nthe statement left undecided at the first level, namely Con(PA);\nin fact, PA2 proves Con(PA), which is the desired result.  But\nnow we have a problem at the second level.  For the second\nincompleteness theorem shows that (under similar background\nassumptions to those above) PA2 does not settle Con(PA2).\nFortunately, the axiom system for the third level, PA3, settles\nthe statement left undecided at the second level, namely\nCon(PA2).  This pattern continues.  For every problem there is a\nsolution and for every solution there is a new problem.  In this way,\nby climbing the hierarchy of types one arrives at systems that\nsuccessively settle the consistency statements that arise along the\nway.\n\n\nThe above hierarchy of types can be recast in the uniform setting of\nset theory.  The set-theoretic hierarchy is defined inductively by\nstarting with the emptyset, taking the powerset at successor stages\n\u03b1+1, and taking the union at limit levels \u03bb:\n\n\n\nV0\n= \u2205\n\nV\u03b1+1\n= P(V\u03b1)\n\nV\u03bb\n= \u222a\u03b1 < \u03bb V\u03b1\n\n\n\n\nThe universe of sets V is the union of all such stages:\nV=\u222a\u03b1\u2208On V\u03b1,\nwhere On is the class of ordinals.  The first infinite level\nV\u03c9 consists of all of the hereditarily finite sets[3]\nand this level satisfies ZFC-Infinity.\nThe sets at this level can be coded by natural numbers and in this way\none can show that PA and ZFC-Infinity are mutually\ninterpretable.[4]\nThe second infinite level V\u03c9+1 is\nessentially P(\u2115) (or, equivalently, \u211d) and this\nlevel satisfies (a theory that is mutually interpretable with)\nPA2.  The third infinite level\nV\u03c9+2 is essentially P(P(\u2115)) (or, equivalently,\nas the set of functions of real numbers) and this level satisfies (a\ntheory that is mutually interpretable with) PA3.  The first three\ninfinite levels thus encompass arithmetic, analysis and functional\nanalysis and therewith most of standard mathematics.  In this fashion,\nthe hierarchy of sets and associated set-theoretic systems encompasses\nthe objects and systems of standard mathematics.\n\n\nNow, should it turn out to be the case that the consistency sentences\n(and the other, related sentences discovered by G\u00f6del in 1931) were\nthe only instances of undecidable statements, then the\nsequence of systems in the above hierarchy would catch every problem\nthat arises.  And although we would never have a single system\nthat gave us a complete axiomatization of mathematical truth, we would\nhave a series of systems that collectively covered the\ntotality of mathematical truths.\n\n\nUnfortunately, matters were not to be so simple.  The trouble is that\nwhen one climbs the hierarchy of sets in this fashion the greater\nexpressive resources that become available lead to more intractable\ninstances of undecidable sentences and this is true already of the\nsecond and third infinite levels.  For example, at the second infinite\nlevel one can formulate the statement PM (that all projective sets\nare Lebesgue measurable) and at the third infinite level one can\nformulate CH (Cantor's continuum hypothesis).[5]\n  These statements were intensively investigated during the early era\nof set theory but little progress was made.  The explanation was\nultimately provided by the subsequent independence techniques of\nG\u00f6del and Cohen.\n\n\nG\u00f6del invented (in 1938) the method of inner models by\ndefining the minimal inner model L.  This model is defined just as\nV is defined except that at successor stages instead of taking the\nfull powerset of the previous stage one takes the definable powerset of the previous stage, where for a given set\nX the definable powerset Def(X) of X is the set of all\nsubsets of X that are definable over X with parameters from X:\n\n\n\nL0\n= \u2205\n\nL\u03b1+1\n= Def(L\u03b1)\n\nL\u03bb\n= \u222a\u03b1 < \u03bb L\u03b1\n\n\n\n\nThe inner model L is the union of all such stages:\nL\n= \u222a\u03b1\u2208On L\u03b1. G\u00f6del\nshowed that L satisfies (arbitrarily large fragments of) ZFC\nalong with CH.  It follows that ZFC cannot refute CH. Cohen\ncomplemented this result by inventing (in 1963) the method\nof forcing (or outer models). Given a complete\nBoolean algebra B he defined a model\nVB and showed that \u00acCH holds in VB.[6]\nThis had the consequence that\nZFC could not prove CH.  Thus, these results together showed\nthat CH is independent of ZFC.  Similar results hold for PM\nand a host of other questions in set theory.\n\n\nThese instances of independence are more intractable in that no simple\niteration of the hierarchy of types leads to their resolution.  They\nled to a more profound search for new axioms.\n\n\nOnce again G\u00f6del provided the first steps in the search for new\naxioms.  In 1946 he proposed as new axioms large cardinal\n  axioms\u2014axioms of infinity that assert that there are very large\nlevels of the hierarchy of types\u2014and he went so far as\nto entertain a generalized completeness theorem for such axioms,\naccording to which all statements of set theory could be settled by\nsuch axioms (G\u00f6del 1946, 151).\n\n\nThe purpose of the remainder of this entry is to describe the nature\nof independence (along with the hierarchy of interpretability) and the\nconnection between independence and large cardinal axioms.  \n\n\n\nFurther Reading: For more on the incompleteness\ntheorems see Smory\u0144ski (1977), Buss (1998a), and\nLindstr\u00f6m (2003).
