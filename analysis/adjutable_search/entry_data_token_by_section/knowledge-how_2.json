    "main_text": "The Regress Argument || The Employment Regress\n1.2 The Employment Regress\n\nHowever, CP is not needed in order to trigger a regress. Perhaps the\nargument can be salvaged by replacing contemplation with a weaker\nrelation. Consider replacing CP with EP:\n\n\nThe Employment Premise (EP): If one employs knowledge\nthat p, one employs knowledge-how to employ one\u2019s\nknowledge that p (and one\u2019s state of knowledge that\np is distinct from one\u2019s state of knowing how to employ\none\u2019s knowledge that p). (Cath 2013: 367\u20138)\n\n\nThe regress is triggered as before. Suppose one \u03a6s:\n\n By AP, one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6.\n By SI, that amounts to employing one\u2019s knowledge that\np, for some p. \nBy EP, one needs to employ one\u2019s knowledge-how to employ\none\u2019s knowledge that p.\n But employing one\u2019s knowledge-how is an action. \n By AP, one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how about employing our\nknowledge-how to employ one\u2019s knowledge that p.\n By SI, that amounts to employing one\u2019s knowledge of\nq, for some q. \n\n\nand so on. \n\nIntellectualists might object to EP in ways similar to how CP was\nresisted\u2014i.e., that not every action requires for its\nperformance the employment of one\u2019s knowledge-how: only\nintentional actions do, as the clown example suggests. According to\nthis line of reply, employing one\u2019s propositional knowledge\nmight be more like a reflex in response to stimuli, rather than an\naction. Further, this version of the regress challenge may be accused\nof assuming that knowledge-that is \u201cbehaviorally inert\u201d\nand needs to be intentionally selected or employed in order to be\nmanifested. Yet, intellectualists have independent reasons to resist\nthis picture (Stalnaker 2012). On the other hand, if Ryleans insist\nthat employments of knowledge-that are actions of sort, it seems there\nis no principled reason why employments of knowledge-how would not be\nsubject to the same requirement. Therefore, it looks like any regress\ngenerated for the intellectualist is generated for Ryle as well\n(Stanley 2011b: 14, 26; though see Fantl 2011 for a possible\ndifference between the regress generated for Ryle and the regress\ngenerated for intellectualism). \n",
