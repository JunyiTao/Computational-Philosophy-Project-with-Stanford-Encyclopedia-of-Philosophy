    "main_text": "Structure and Sources of ER || Structure\n4.1 Structure\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s book consists of an introduction and three parts of unequal\nlength. In the introduction, Ibn Daud states that the problem of free\nwill, which prompted him to write his book, can only be solved after\nthe preparatory philosophical study of a variety of issues in the\nfield of physics and metaphysics. In what may be called a \u201ctable\nof contents\u201d, he specifies the various topics to be discussed in\nhis book in his introduction; topics with which the beginning student\nmust become familiar. The first part (Weil 1852, 4\u201343) deals\nwith the basic principles of (Aristotelian) physics and\nmetaphysics. It opens with a logical section that treats substance and\nthe categories (I.1). This is followed by discussions on matter, form\nand the elements (I.2), motion and infinity (I.3\u20135), the soul (I.6\u20137)\nand the heavenly spheres (I.8).  According to Ibn Daud, this\nconstitutes the minimum requirements for an investigation of the\nJewish religion. The \u201cprinciples of religion\u201d provide the\nsubject matter for the second part (Weil 1852, 44\u201398). Here Ibn\nDaud is concerned with God\u2019s existence and unity (II.1\u20132), divine\nattributes (II.3), cosmology and the heavenly intelligences (II.4),\nprophecy and the defense of Mosaic Law (II.5), and, finally, angelology and the\nproblem of free will (II.6). The third and final part (Weil 1852,\n98\u2013104), deals with ethics. In this work, Ibn Daud thus offers a\ncomprehensive survey of the contemporary philosophical debate. Due to\nthe variety of topics covered, the book has been characterized as a\ncompendium or a \u201cphilosophical encyclopedia in miniature\u201d\n(Arfa 1954, 2).\n\n\nIn accordance with Ibn Daud\u2019s concern for the harmony between\nrevelation and reason, biblical exegesis occupies a prominent place in\nthe ER. Up to the section on prophecy (II.5), the discussion\nof each and every philosophical topic is followed by a section in which\nIbn Daud provides biblical verses that are intended to point to or\ndemonstrate the truths of the philosophical teachings in the preceding\nphilosophical account. In this way Ibn Daud endeavors step by step to\nprove that \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d does not contradict\nrevelation. From the chapter on prophecy onwards, however, biblical\npassages are not provided in a separate section, but are instead\ninterwoven into the philosophical discussion; indeed they lie at the\nheart of it.\n",
