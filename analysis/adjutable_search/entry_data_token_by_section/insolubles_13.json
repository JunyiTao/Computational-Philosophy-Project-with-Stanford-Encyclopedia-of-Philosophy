    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || Walter Segrave\n3.2 Walter Segrave\n\nWalter de Segrave (or de Sexgrave) was at Merton College, Oxford from\n1321 until at least 1338, and had obtained his Magister Artium by\n1336. From 1340\u201342 he was Chancellor to Richard Aungerville, that is,\nRichard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, who famously gathered around him\nsome of the very best minds in the kingdom, including Walter Burley,\nThomas Bradwardine and Richard Kilvington. Segrave subsequently became\nDean of Chichester, but was dead by 1349. His Insolubles is\nhis only known work, which appears to have been composed at Oxford in\nthe late 1320s or early 1330s, which is consistent with the fact that\nit is clearly a response to Bradwardine\u2019s own\nInsolubles. (See Spade 1975 item LXVIII) \n\nSegrave shares many assumptions with Bradwardine, indeed, at a couple\nof points he appears to endorse Bradwardine\u2019s second postulate\n(P2), that a proposition signifies everything implied by what it\nsignifies. For the heart of Segrave\u2019s solution is that, since\nwhoever asserts a proposition asserts that it is true, the restriction\non supposition that Segrave maintains is that \n\nThe extremes of a proposition only supposit for those things for which\nthe whole can mean that it itself is true, assuming that it exists,\nand those extremes do not supposit for such things for which the\nwhole, assuming that it exists, would mean that it itself is false.\nAnd this is my main point.\n The reason Segrave gives is that\n\n\n... it is because the extremes take their supposition from the copula,\nwhose significate is that the proposition is true, as was said, so the\nextreme does not supposit for anything for which the whole would mean\nthat it itself is false or is not true, because this would be\ninconsistent with the significate of the copula, and so the extremes\nare restricted by the meaning of the copula.\n He cites the authority of Aristotle in\nMetaphysics \u0394 7:\n\n\nEvery proposition means things to be in reality as it signifies. This\nis self-evident and is clear from the Philosopher and the Commentator\n[that is, Averroes] in comment 14 on the fifth book of the Metaphysics\nand in the explanation in that comment as a whole: for the copula in\nthe proposition signifies it to be a truth, as is elucidated there.\n\n\nBurley and Bradwardine agree on one thing: that insolubles commit the\nfallacy (simpliciter et secundum quid), taking this from\nAristotle\u2019s treatment in his De Sophisticis Elenchis of\nthe example of the man who swears that he is forsworn. Segrave says\nthey are mistaken: according to him, insolubles commit the fallacy of\naccident. \n\nThe fallacy of accident is the first of the fallacies described by\nAristotle in De Sophisticis Elenchis as those\n\u201cindependent of language,\u201d and discussed at some length in\nch.24. The classic example is the Hidden Man puzzle: you know your\nfather (or Coriscus), your father (or Coriscus) is the man\napproaching, but you don\u2019t know the man approaching (since he is\nwearing a mask, or too far away to recognise, etc.). Aristotle\u2019s\ndiagnosis was that one or more of the two properties attached to\nCoriscus (being known by you and being the man approaching) is\naccidental (or incidental) to him and so there is no essential\nconnection to support inferring the conclusion from the premises. \n\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the fallacy of accident is neither\nclear nor convincing. One medieval attempt to clarify the fallacy of\naccident is found in Giles of Rome. The fallacy arises, he said, when\nthere is a variation in the supposition of the middle term. Burley\nextends the idea of variation of the supposition of terms to the\nextremes (Burley,  Tractatus super librum Elenchorum, cited\nin Ockham 1979, p.231 n.3):\n\nIn this fallacy there should be assigned three, namely, the attribute,\nthe accident and the subject thing. And according to Giles, the major\nextreme is always the attribute and the middle term the subject thing\nand the minor extreme the accident. But this is not a big worry, for\nit suffices for there to be this fallacy that some term is not\nincluded but is compared to two other terms in the argument. Whence it\nshould be realised that the fallacy of accident sometimes results from\na variation of the middle term and sometimes from a variation of the\nmajor or minor extreme.\n Accordingly, Segrave\u2019s analysis appeals to the\nfallacy of accident:\n\n\nInsolubles commit the fallacy of accident because by arguing like\nthis:\n\n\nThis is said by Socrates and this is a falsehood, so a falsehood is\nsaid by Socrates,\n the term \u2018falsehood\u2019 supposits in the minor\npremise for something it does not supposit for in the conclusion.\nSimilarly, in arguing like this:\n\n\nNo falsehood is said by Socrates, this is a falsehood, so this is not\nsaid by Socrates,\n there is a variation in the middle term because the term\n\u2018falsehood\u2019 supposits for one thing in the major premise\nand another in the minor, according to those advocating this solution.\nAnd thus it is clear that they have to solve these kinds of\nparalogisms according to the fallacy of accident, namely, from a\nvariation of the middle term or of an extreme term.\n\n",
