    "main_text": "History of Molecular Biology || Origins\n1.1 Origins\n\nThe field of molecular biology arose from the convergence of work by\ngeneticists, physicists, and structural chemists on a common problem:\nthe nature of inheritance. In the early twentieth century, although\nthe nascent field of genetics was guided by Mendel\u2019s laws of\nsegregation and independent assortment, the actual mechanisms of gene\nreproduction, mutation and expression remained unknown. Thomas Hunt\nMorgan and his colleagues utilized the fruit fly, Drosophila\nmelanogaster, as a model organism to study the relationship\nbetween the gene and the chromosomes in the hereditary process (Morgan\n1926; discussed in Darden 1991; Darden and Maull 1977; Kohler 1994;\nRoll-Hanson 1978; Wimsatt 1992). A former student of Morgan\u2019s,\nHermann J. Muller, recognized the \u201cgene as a basis of\nlife\u201d, and so set out to investigate its structure (Muller\n1926). Muller discovered the mutagenic effect of x-rays on\nDrosophila, and utilized this phenomenon as a tool to explore\nthe size and nature of the gene (Carlson 1966, 1971, 1981, 2011; Crow\n1992; Muller 1927). But despite the power of mutagenesis, Muller\nrecognized that, as a geneticist, he was limited in the extent to\nwhich he could explicate the more fundamental properties of genes and\ntheir actions. He concluded a 1936 essay:\n\n\nThe geneticist himself is helpless to analyse these properties\nfurther. Here the physicist, as well as the chemist, must step in. Who\nwill volunteer to do so? (Muller 1936: 214)\n\n\nMuller\u2019s request did not go unanswered. The next decade saw\nseveral famous physicists turn their attention to the nature of\ninheritance (Keller 1990; Kendrew 1967). In What is Life, the\nphysicist Erwin Schroedinger (1944) proposed ways in which the\nprinciples of quantum physics might account for the stability, yet\nmutability, of the gene (see the entry on\n life)\n (Elitzur 1995; Moore 1989; Olby 1994; Sarkar 1991; for a\nreinterpretation see Kay 2000). Max Delbrueck also became interested\nin the physical basis of heredity after hearing a lecture by his\nteacher, quantum physicist Niels Bohr (1933), which expounded a\nprinciple of complementarity between physics and biology (McKaughan\n2005; Roll-Hansen 2000). In contrast to Schroedinger, Bohr (and\nsubsequently Delbrueck) did not seek to reduce biology to physics;\ninstead, the goal was to understand how each discipline complemented\nthe other (Delbrueck 1949; Sloan and Fogel 2011). To investigate the\nself-reproductive characteristic of life, Delbrueck used\nbacteriophage, viruses that infect bacteria and then multiply very\nrapidly. The establishment of \u201cThe Phage Group\u201d in the\nearly 1940s by Delbrueck and another physicist-turned-biologist\nSalvador Luria marked a critical point in the rise of molecular\nbiology (Brock 1990; Cairns et al. 1966; Fischer and Lipson 1988;\nFleming 1968; Lewontin 1968; Luria 1984; Morange 1998: Ch. 4; Stent\n1968). Delbrueck\u2019s colleague at Cal Tech, Linus Pauling,\nutilized his knowledge of structural chemistry to study macromolecular\nstructure. Pauling contributed both theoretical work on the nature of\nchemical bonds and experimental work using x-ray crystallography to\ndiscover the physical structure of macromolecular compounds (Pauling\n1939, 1970; Olby 1979; Hager 1995; Crick 1996; Sarkar 1998).\n\nAs suggested in the brief history above, experimentation figured\nprominently in the rise of molecular biology (see the entry on\n experiment in biology).\n X-ray crystallography allowed molecular biologists to investigate the\nstructure of macromolecules.\n Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952) used phage viruses to confirm\nthat the genetic material transmitted from generation to generation\nwas DNA and not proteins (see Hershey-Chase Experiment in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Muller (1927) used x-rays to intervene on and alter gene function,\nthus revealing the application of methods from physics to a biological\ndomain (see Elof Carlson on Muller\u2019s Research in\n Other Internet Resources).\n \n\nRecognizing quite early the importance of these new physical and\nstructural chemical approaches to biology, Warren Weaver, then the\ndirector of the Natural Sciences section of the Rockefeller\nFoundation, introduced the term \u201cmolecular biology\u201d in a\n1938 report to the Foundation. Weaver wrote,\n\n\nAnd gradually there is coming into being a new branch of\nscience\u2014molecular biology\u2014which is beginning to uncover\nmany secrets concerning the ultimate units of the living\ncell\u2026.in which delicate modern techniques are being used to\ninvestigate ever more minute details of certain life processes (quoted\nin Olby 1994: 442).\n\n\nBut perhaps a more telling account of the term\u2019s origin came\nfrom Francis Crick, who said he started calling himself a molecular\nbiologist because:\n\n\nwhen inquiring clergymen asked me what I did, I got tired of\nexplaining that I was a mixture of crystallographer, biophysicist,\nbiochemist, and geneticist, an explanation which in any case they\nfound too hard to grasp. (quoted in Stent 1969: 36)\n\n\nThis brief recapitulation of the origins of molecular biology reflects\nthemes addressed by philosophers, such as reduction (see\n Section 3.1),\n the concept of the gene (see\n Section 2.3),\n and experimentation (see\n Section 3.4).\n For Schroedinger, biology was to be reduced to the more fundamental\nprinciples of physics, while Delbrueck instead resisted such a\nreduction and sought what made biology unique. Muller\u2019s shift\nfrom Mendelian genetics to the study of gene structure raises the\nquestion of the relation between the gene concepts found in those\nseparate fields of genetics. And the import of experimental methods\nfrom physics to biology raised the question of the relation between\nthose disciplines.\n",
