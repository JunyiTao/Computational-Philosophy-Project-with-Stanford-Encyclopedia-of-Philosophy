First-order temporal logics\n\nObjects exist in time, and they change their properties over time.\nPropositional temporal logics are not expressive enough to capture\nthis dynamic aspect of the world, for all that is associated with a\ntime instant in a model of propositional temporal logics is a set of\nabstract atomic propositions that are declared true there. What is\nneeded, instead, is a full-fledged model of the temporal history of\nthe world, with objects that may have certain properties and stand in\ncertain relations. Accordingly, the language should contain names for\nobjects, variables and quantifiers ranging over objects, as well as\npredicates for denoting properties and relations, to adequately\ndescribe how the world is at a given instant in time \u2014 in\naddition to temporal operators for reasoning about how the world\nchanges over time. This is what first-order temporal logics\nprovide.\n",
