Wang spent his early years studying\nBuddhism and Daoism but eventually became an articulate and\ncharismatic defender of Confucianism, one whose ideas and practices\nwere honed over the course of an extraordinary career as a civil\nadministrator and military general. By Wang\u2019s time Zhu\nXi\u2019s views had become deeply embedded in the customs and\ninstitutions responsible for formal education, and Wang was trained in\nand well acquainted with those views. But Wang broke with orthodoxy on\nsome fundamental issues, most notably on the role of personal\nexperience and intuition in ethical cultivation and an alternative\nmetaphysics that made the heartmind a constituent of the Patterns\n(li) that are the source of order and virtue. A guiding\nconcern that ran through many of his objections had to do with the\nnature of moral knowledge or knowing, which he believed to be\nintrinsically related to the motivation to act, much as the desire to\navoid a foul odor is intrinsically related to the understanding that\nthe odor is foul. This had implications for the model of ethical\ncultivation which he promoted, which was to build on the immediate\nconcerns and experiences of individuals rather than overly academic or\nscholastic study on topics well removed from their daily lives\n(Ivanhoe 2009: 99\u2013184).\n\nWang also proposed that people have an innate faculty of moral\nunderstanding that he called liangzhi \u826f\u77e5, most\nliterally translated as \u201cpure knowledge\u201d or \u201cgood\nknowledge\u201d but sometimes more loosely translated as\n\u201cinnate knowledge\u201d or \u201cconscience\u201d. If people\nfail to be virtuous, he proposed, this is because they are unable to\naccess or recognize the deliverances of good knowledge due to\ninterference by selfish desires, which arise from self-centered\nattachments and ways of thinking. This teaching, combined with his\nworries about forms of study that are too far removed from personal\nexperience, conferred a somewhat ambiguous status on the longstanding\nConfucian practice of reading and reflecting on the Confucian\nclassics, for it is not entirely clear why grasping ideas and accounts\nof events well removed from one\u2019s own life should help to access\nor complement good knowledge (Ivanhoe 2002: 123\u2013134). This and\nother ambiguities in Wang\u2019s teachings left considerable room for\ndebate among the subsequent generations of his disciples and followers\n(Peng 2003).\n\nLater historians also noticed a number of striking resonances between\nWang\u2019s views and an earlier Neo-Confucian named Lu Xiangshan\n(1139\u20131193), who also spoke and wrote about a faculty of good\nknowledge and regarded the heartmind as a constituent of li\n(Pattern) (Ivanhoe 2009: 29\u201397). Because of the similarities\nbetween Lu and Wang, which in certain respect mirror similarities\nbetween Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi, it is customary among many scholars of\nChinese philosophy to refer to two schools of thought in the Song-Ming\nperiod\u2014the Cheng-Zhu school sometimes associated with the\n\u201cLearning of Pattern\u201d (Lixue \u7406\u5b78)\nand the Lu-Wang school often associated with the \u201cLearning of\nHeartmind\u201d (Xinxue \u5fc3\u5b78). This way of\ncharacterizing the two most influential poles of Neo-Confucian thought\nprovides an historical lens through which many 20th and\n21st century Confucian thinkers understand their own\nphilosophical orientation and roots.\n",
