    "main_text": "Steady-state Cosmology || But It\u2019s Milne In the End\n8.3 But It\u2019s Milne In the End\n\nYet Bondi\u2019s major philosophical debt was to Milne. According to\nBondi, Milne\u2019s theory was through and through deductive, which\nwas reason enough for some of his colleagues to condemn it:\n\nThe aim of this discipline [= kinematic relativity] is to deduce as\nmuch as possible merely from the cosmological principle and the basic\nproperties of space, time and the propagation of light. The beauty of\nthis, as indeed of any deductive theory, rests on the rigour of the\narguments and the small number of the axioms required...When the\ntheory was first developed it met with great hostility and was\ncriticized very severely, often unjustly, and sometimes frivolously.\n(Bondi 1960), p. 123)\n\n\nIn addition to his admiration of Milne\u2019s H-D methodology, Bondi\nhas high praise as well for Milne\u2019s operationalism, particularly\nits use in defining distance:\n\nImperfect as Milne\u2019s definition of distance may be, it is very\nmuch better than the \u2018rigid ruler\u2019 one used in most other\ntheories\u2026Milne\u2019s definition of distance, by no means\nperfect as it is, is probably the best yet devised. (Bondi 1960, p.\n126\u20139)\n\n\nIn the end, Bondi sums up Milne\u2019s contributions with no\nuncertain praise:\n\nThe foregoing brief description will have indicated the remarkable\nsuccess of kinematic relativity in attempting to use the cosmological\nprinciple not only for the construction of the substratum but as chief\nguide in formulating ordinary physics. In this respect it differs\ngreatly from all other cosmologies which either rely on a\nconventionally obtained body of physics or have not yet succeeded in\ndrawing conclusions of local interest from the cosmological principle.\n(Bondi 1960, p. 136)\n\n",
