    "main_text": "Problem IV: Externalism || Intrinsic Causal Surrogates\n7.2 Intrinsic Causal Surrogates\n\nOne general line of response notes that whenever we explain a bit of\nbehavior by appeal to extrinsic content, there is a local, intrinsic\nproperty available as a \u201ccausal surrogate\u201d to produce the\nbehavior (Crane and Mellor 1990). Such a surrogate may be\nneurophysiological or, as on\n computationalist\n views, a complex of \u201cformal\u201d or \u201csyntactic\u201d\nproperties of internal representations. Now by itself, this point\nseems just to highlight the problem: if intrinsic surrogates are\nalways needed, all the more reason to reject the efficacy of content.\nSome have indeed drawn such a lesson, concluding either that content\nhas no role to play in an explanatory psychology (Stich 1978, 1983),\nor perhaps that psychological explanations appealing to content were\nnever causal to begin with (Owens 1993; see also the noncausalists\ncited in \u00a71.1).\n\nBut this might be too hasty. Far from precluding the causal efficacy\nof content, the surrogates might in fact play a role in ensuring it.\nNote that while Lilian\u2019s intrinsic properties don\u2019t\nguarantee the contents of her beliefs, her intrinsic properties are,\nin her environment, reliably correlated with these contents\u2014so\nreliably, in fact, that content, in spite of being extrinsic, enters\ninto the counterfactuals or laws often thought to\nground causal efficacy. It seems clear, after all, that if Lilian had\nnot believed there was water in front of her, she would not have\nextended her hand. This counterfactual could be secured by the fact\nthat Lilian\u2019s believing \u201cThere\u2019s water in front of\nme\u201d covaries with some internal state of her brain, but the\ncounterfactual, for all that, is still true. A similar point could be\nmade using (hedged) laws connecting content with behavior. The terrain\nhere in any case is similar to that explored earlier in\n\u00a7\u00a75.3\u20134, though the extrinsic nature of content\nintroduces its own complexities. (On the counterfactuals, see Mele\n1992, ch. 2; Yablo 1997; on the laws, see Braun 1991; Fodor 1995.)\n\nThere\u2019s a more direct way that the intrinsic surrogates might\nsecure the efficacy of content: perhaps the surrogate properties\nare content, or rather a kind of content. Distinguish narrow\nfrom broad content. Think of narrow content as the content of a\nrepresentational state of mind minus its \u201cbroad\u201d\ncomponents. Consider Lilian (or Lilian\u2019s brain) and an\nintrinsically indiscernible brain in a vat wired to a supercomputer.\nGrant that Lilian and the envatted brain entertain intrinsically\nindiscernible thoughts with utterly different representational\ncontents. Now imagine that we could abstract a common element from the\ncontents of Lilian\u2019s and the brain\u2019s intrinsically\nindiscernible thoughts. This element is their narrow content. Because\nnarrow content is something all intrinsic duplicates must have in\ncommon, the hope is that such content could be the very intrinsic\nproperties that produce behavior.\n\nThe notion of narrow content might raise suspicion, however. Return to\nthe vending machine. The quarter Gus inserts in the machine has a\nparticular value owing to relations it bears to outside goings-on: it\nwas minted in the Denver mint. A counterfeit placed in the machine\ncould have the very same intrinsic makeup as the quarter, but it would\nlack the quarter\u2019s value. It looks as though it is the\nquarter\u2019s intrinsic makeup, not its value, that matters to the\noperation of the machine. Now imagine someone arguing that a quarter\nand an intrinsically indiscernible slug do in fact share a kind of\nvalue: narrow value. Because narrow value accompanies an\nobject\u2019s intrinsic qualities, we need not regard narrow value as\nepiphenomenal. But what could narrow value be? Whatever it is, could\nit in any way resemble value ordinarily conceived\u2014broad\nvalue? Narrow value looks like a phony category posited ad\nhoc to accommodate an otherwise embarrassing difficulty.\nNevertheless, some philosophers remain optimistic about the prospects\nof a viable internalist account of content, one that would allow fully\nfledged thoughts to have a role in the production of behavior.
