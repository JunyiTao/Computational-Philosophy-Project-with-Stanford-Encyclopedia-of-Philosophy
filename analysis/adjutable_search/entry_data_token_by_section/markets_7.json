    "main_text": "Relations between markets and other institutions || Institutions that supplement or correct market outcomes\n4.2 Institutions that supplement or correct market outcomes\n\nMany political philosophers take (some of) the criticisms raised\nagainst markets (cf. 3.2 above) seriously. They therefore argue that\nmarkets can only be justified if they coexist with other institutions\nthat supplement or correct their outcomes. These institutions can be\nsubdivided into different categories. Economists typically use the\nconcept of \u201cmarket failure\u201d to describe cases where one or\nmore conditions for efficient market outcomes are not met, e.g., when\nthere are externalities or public goods (see e.g., Bator 1958; Cowen\n1988). To improve outcomes in such cases can require the regulation of\nmarkets (e.g., by prohibiting negative externalities such as the\nemission of harmful pollutants) or the provision of public goods by\nstate institutions. Rules and regulations might also be needed \u2013\nand can be justified from the point of view of Pareto efficiency\n\u2013 in cases of what Basu (2007) has called the \u201clarge\nnumber problem\u201d: some form of behavior, although harmless in\nitself, may have a negative impact if committed by a large number of\npeople. The same can be true when there is more than one equilibrium\nin a market and it is desirable to move to one of them rather than\nanother, e.g., from an equilibrium with child labor to one without\n(Basu / Van 1998). One might also argue that the macro-economic\nstabilization of markets, for example through the central bank or\nthrough measures that raise demand in recessions (cf. Keynes 1936),\nbelongs into the category of provision of public goods. The\neffectiveness of such measures, however, is deeply contested among\neconomists.\n\nA second broad category of institutions that supplement or correct\nmarket outcomes can be summarized under the term \u201cwelfare\nstate\u201d. It attempts to provide responses to criticisms of\nmarkets concerning poverty, unequal outcomes, and a lack of equality\nof opportunity. The most basic tasks of the welfare state are to\nsecure the socioeconomic rights (cf. e.g., Marshall 1992) of citizens\nwho cannot earn an income in the labor market, and to provide some\ndegree of equality of opportunity. Many political philosophers have\nemphasized the importance of redistribution for these purposes (see\nalso Fleurbaey 2012); the emphasis on redistribution has almost\novershadowed questions about the direct distributive\nconsequences of different markets and how these might be influenced by\nregulation (but see Dietsch 2010). Welfare state institutions can take\non different forms, and can be organized in different ways, from a\nminimum of care for the destitute to a large array of social services,\nsuch as public education and a public health service. Recently, some\nthinkers have even argued for the introduction of an unconditional\nbasic income for individuals, to make sure individuals are not at the\nmercy of those who control the access to resources (e.g., Van Parijs\n1995, Widerquist 2013). Decisions about such institutions are often\ntaken to be trade-offs between the efficiency of markets and the\ndesideratum of some degree of equality of income and wealth. As Okun\nwrites: \u201cAny insistence on carving the pie into equal slices\nwould shrink the size of the pie\u201d (1975, 48). It is not clear,\nhowever, whether this picture adequately describes economic reality.\nIt is often based on the assumptions that higher taxes stifle\npeople\u2019s motivation to work hard. But whether this is true\ndepends, among other things, on the question of whether individuals\nare mainly motivated by the desire to earn money or whether they might\nalso have an intrinsic motivation to provide certain goods and\nservices (cf. Roemer 2012). Some measures, such as a public education\nsystem that gives every child a chance to develop his or her talents,\nmight lead simultaneously to more equality and to a larger economic\npie, because the increase in human capital more than outbalances all\npossible losses in efficiency through the taxation that pays for the\neducation system (cf. also Okun 1975, 81ff.; on the efficiency of\nvarious non-market institutions see also Heath 2006). As a matter of\nfact, in some countries such as the Scandinavian countries a strong\nwelfare state coexists with a flourishing market economy, undermining\nclaims of mutual incompatibility. In addition to its role in\nredistribution, the welfare state can also have a wider, cultural\nmeaning: as Cunningham (2005) argues, it can help to overcome the fear\ncreated by the existential risks to which individuals are exposed in\npure market societies, and which might be an important factor behind\nthe allegedly more egoistic and more materialistic culture in such\nsocieties. For example, in a well-functioning welfare state\nindividuals do not have to maximize their income for the sake of\nsaving for periods of unemployment, but can participate in a social\nsystem that insures them against unemployment. A welfare state could\nalso encourage risk-taking by lessening the costs of failure, which\nmight spur innovation.\n [10]\n",
