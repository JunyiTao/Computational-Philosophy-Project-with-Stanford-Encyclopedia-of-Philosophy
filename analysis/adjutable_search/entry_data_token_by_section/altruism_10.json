    "main_text": "Does altruism exist? || Pure altruism and self-sacrifice\n2.6 Pure altruism and self-sacrifice\n\nOf the three forms of psychological egoism distinguished above, the\none that is least open to objection is the weak form that holds that\naltruism is never pure. It claims that whenever we act, one\nof our motives is a desire for our own good. There is no good a\npriori argument for this thesis\u2014or, at any rate, the a\npriori argument we have been considering for the strongest form\nof psychological egoism does not support it, because the two premises\nused in that argument are so implausible. But it might nonetheless be\nsuggested that as a matter of fact we always do find some\nself-interested motivation that accompanies altruistically motivated\nbehavior. It is difficult to refute that proposal. We should not\npretend that we know all of the considerations and causes that\nunderlie our behavior. Some of our motives are hidden, and there is\ntoo much going on in our minds for us to be aware of the whole of our\npsychology. So, for all we know, we might never be pure altruists.\n\nBut what of the other weak form of psychological egoism?\u2014the one\nthat admits that sometimes one of our reasons for acting is the good\nwe do for others for their sake, but claims that we never act for the\ngood of others when we think that doing so would make us worse off. It\nsays, in other words, that we never voluntarily do what we foresee\nwill sacrifice our well-being to some extent. \n\nThe first point to be made about this form of psychological egoism is\nthat, once again, there is no a priori argument to support\nit. The two premises we have been examining\u2014that all action is\nmotivated by desire and all desire is like hunger\u2014are\nimplausible, and so they do not support the thesis that we never\nsacrifice our well-being to any degree. If this form of psychological\negoism is to be sustained, its evidence would have to be drawn from\nthe observation of each human being\u2019s reasons for acting. It\nwould have to say: when our motives are carefully scrutinized, it may\nindeed be found that although we do good to others for the sake of\nthose others, we never do so when we think it would detract even\nslightly from our own well-being. In other words, we count the good of\nothers as something that by itself gives us a reason, but it is always\na weak reason, in that it is never as strong as reasons that derive\nfrom our self-interest.\n\nWe have no reason to suppose that human behavior is so uniform in its\nmotivation. A far more plausible hypothesis about human motives is\nthat they vary a great deal from one person to another. Some people\nare never altruistic; others are just as this weak form of\npsychological egoism says: they are altruistic, but only when they\nthink this will not detract from their own well-being; and then there\nis a third and large category filled with people who, to some degree\nor other, are willing to sacrifice their well-being for others. Within\nthis category there is wide range\u2014some are willing to make only\nsmall sacrifices, others larger sacrifices, and some extraordinarily\nlarge sacrifices. This way of thinking has the great advantage of\nallowing our experience of each individual to provide us with the\nevidence by means of which we characterize him. We should not label\neveryone as an egoist on the basis of some a priori theory;\nrather, we should assess each person\u2019s degree of egoism and\naltruism on the basis of what we can discern of their motives.\n",
