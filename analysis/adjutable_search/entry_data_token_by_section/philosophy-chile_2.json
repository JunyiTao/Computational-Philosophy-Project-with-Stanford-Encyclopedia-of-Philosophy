    "main_text": "The Era of Positivism\n3. The Era of Positivism\n\nAs elsewhere in Latin America, Positivism in Chile had a significant\nimpact in a number of areas, including philosophy. The arrival of\nPositivism coincided with the rising tide of anticlericalism in Chile\nfrom the 1860s and the 1880s, but its influence was not restricted to\nattacks against the Church. Indeed, it had a profound influence in\neducation, contributing to a substantial transformation of the\ncurriculum at the secondary and higher education levels. Initially,\nhowever, it was a timely weapon against the influence of the Church in\nChilean society.\n\nThe fundamental appeal of Positivism was through its notion of\n\u201cprogress\u201d. Based on Auguste Comte\u2019s work,\nPositivism allowed anticlerical thinkers to dismiss the\n\u201ctheological\u201d stage as a primitive state in the evolution\nof humanity, one that would inevitably be superseded by the\n\u201cmetaphysic\u201d and \u201cscientific\u201d stages. The\npolitical implications and uses of this evolutionary view were\nobvious: to advance to the highest level, Chileans needed to leave\nbehind the religious influence of the Catholic Church. As articulated\nby the leading early proponent of Positivism, Jos\u00e9 Victorino\nLastarria, who abandoned his liberal commitments (for being based on\nabstract, or \u201cmetaphysical\u201d, principles), science could\naddress the problems of Chilean society in the most effective way.\nOthers heeded the call, and concentrated on such important priorities\nas education. The liberal historian Diego Barros Arana had done much\nin this regard through reforms of the curriculum at the Instituto\nNacional, as did Miguel Luis Amun\u00e1tegui, who, in his role as\nMinister of Education, in 1879 formally introduced the teaching of\nscience in public schools. But the most significant\npositivist figure was Valent\u00edn Letelier\n(1852\u20131919), whose Filosof\u00eda de la\neducaci\u00f3n (1927 [1891]) served as the basis for a profound\nreorientation of philosophical studies in Chile. In his view, the\ntheological and metaphysical emphases that had dominated Chilean\neducation since independence had done little to unify the country\naround a core of shared beliefs. In his view, only the certainties of\nscience could do that. The instrument for achieving this higher stage\nwas logic, which he successfully introduced in the educational plan of\n1893, at the expense of ethics and theodicy. Consistent with this\nemphasis, Juan Serapio Lois (1844\u20131913) published the most\ncomplete treatment of logic from a Comtean perspective, the\nElementos de filosof\u00eda positiva (1906\u20131908),\napplying logical analysis to the methodology of a range of\nsciences.\n\nPhilosophy under the influence of Letelier acquired a scientific\ncharacter, with a special emphasis on experimental psychology that\nwould ultimately provoke a reaction among thinkers dissatisfied with\nthe local unresponsiveness to new currents of thought emerging in\nEurope and the United States. Positivism, however, did help in\nconsolidating the study of philosophy at both the higher level\n(through the Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico at the Universidad de Chile),\nand at secondary schools, where it was an obligatory subject of\nstudy.\n\nAlthough it was less influential, it is important to point out that\nthere was another branch of Positivism represented by the brothers\nJuan Enrique (1852\u20131927) and Jorge Lagarrigue (1854\u20131894),\nwho embraced the religious ideas of the late Auguste Comte and brought\nthe Religion of Humanity to Chile. Although this variety of Positivism\nsurvived well into the twentieth century, it left little influence in\nthe field of philosophy. Politically, it was aligned with the\npresidentialist and allegedly authoritarian administration of\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda, who was defeated in the Civil War of\n1891. As in the case of Comte\u2019s support of Louis Bonaparte, the\nLagarrigue brothers\u2019 brand of positivism came to be associated\nwith authoritarianism.\n",
