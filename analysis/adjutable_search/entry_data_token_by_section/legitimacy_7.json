    "main_text": "Sources of Political Legitimacy || Public Justification and Political Participation\n3.2 Public Justification and Political Participation\n\nAn important legacy of consent theory in contemporary thought is\nmanifest in accounts that attribute the source of legitimacy either to\nan idea of public reason\u2014taking the lead from Kant\u2014or to a\ntheory of democratic participation\u2014taking the lead from\nRousseau. Theories of deliberative democracy combine elements of both\naccounts.\n\nPublic reason accounts tend to focus on the problem of justifying\npolitical coercion. The solution they propose is that political\ncoercion is justified if it is supported on the basis of reasons that\nall reasonable persons can share. Interest in public reason accounts\nstarted with Rawls\u2019 Political Liberalism, but Rawls\ndeveloped the idea more fully in later works. Rawls\u2019\nstarting-point is the following problem of legitimacy (Rawls 2001:\n41): \u201cin the light of what reasons and values \u2026 can\ncitizens legitimately exercise \u2026 coercive power over one\nanother?\u201d The solution to this problem that Rawls proposes is\nthe following \u201cliberal principle of legitimacy\u201d:\n\u201cpolitical power is legitimate only when it is exercised in\naccordance with a constitution (written or unwritten) the essentials\nof which all citizens, as reasonable and rational, can endorse in the\nlight of their common human reason\u201d (Rawls 2001: 41; see\nMichelman 2022 for an extensive discussion of constitutional\nessentials).\n\nRawls\u2019 idea of public reason, which is at the core of the\nliberal principle of legitimacy, rests on the method of\n\u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014as opposed to\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d\u2014justification that Rawls has\ndeveloped in response to critics of his theory of justice as fairness\n(Rawls 1993). This means that public reason should be\n\u201cfreestanding\u201d in the same way as his theory of justice\nis. Public reason should involve only political values and be\nindependent of\u2014potentially controversial\u2014comprehensive\nmoral or religious doctrines of the good. This restricts the content\nof public reason to what is given by the family of what Rawls calls\npolitical conceptions of justice (Rawls 2001: 26). Rawls recognizes\nthat because the content of the idea of public reason is restricted,\nthe domain to which it should apply must be restricted too. The\nquestion is: in what context is it important that the restriction on\nreason is observed? Rawls conceives of the domain of public reason as\nlimited to matters of constitutional essentials and basic justice and\nas applying primarily\u2014but not only\u2014to judges, government\nofficials, and candidates for public office when they decide on\nmatters of constitutional essentials and basic justice.\n\nSimmons (2001) criticizes Rawls\u2019 approach for mistakenly\nblurring the distinction between justifying the state and political\nlegitimacy (see also section 2.3.). A Rawlsian could reply, however,\nthat the problem of legitimacy centrally involves the justification of\ncoercion, and that legitimacy should thus be understood as what\ncreates\u2014rather than merely justifies\u2014political authority.\nThe following thought supports this claim. Rawls\u2014in\nPolitical Liberalism\u2014explicitly focuses on the\ndemocratic context. It is a particular feature of democracy that the\nright to rule is created by those who are ruled. As Hershovitz puts it\nin his critique of the Razian approach to political legitimacy, in a\ndemocracy there is no sharp division between the \u201cbinders\u201d\nand the \u201cbound\u201d (2003: 210f). The political authority of\ndemocracy is thus entailed by some account of the conditions under\nwhich citizens may legitimately exercise coercive power over one\nanother (see Viehoff 2014 and Kolodny 2023 on this question). But even\nif Simmons\u2019 objection can be refuted in this way, a further\nproblem for public reason accounts is whether they can successfully\nshow that some form of public justification is indeed required for\npolitical legitimacy (see Enoch 2015).\n\nRecent public reason accounts have developed Rawls\u2019 original\nidea in different ways (see also the entry on public reason). Those\nfollowing Rawls more closely will understand public reasons as reasons\nthat attract a\u2014hypothetical\u2014consensus. On this\ninterpretation, a public reason is a reason that all reasonable\npersons can be expected to endorse. The target of the consensus is\neither the political decisions themselves or the procedure through\nwhich political decisions are made. On a common reading today, the\nRawlsian idea of public reason is understood in terms of a\nhypothetical consensus on substantive reasons (e.g., Quong 2011;\nHartley and Watson 2018). On those conceptions, the use of political\ncoercion is legitimate if it is supported by substantive reasons that\nall reasonable persons can be expected to endorse. The problem with\nthis interpretation of public reason is that the demand for a\nconsensus on substantive reasons in circumstances of moral and\nreligious pluralism and disagreement either relies on a very\nrestrictive characterization of reasonable persons or ends up with a\nvery limited domain for legitimate political coercion.\n\nRawls\u2019 conception of political legitimacy can also be understood\nin terms of procedural reasons (Peter 2008). On this interpretation,\nthe domain of public reason is limited to the justification of the\nprocess of political decision-making, and need not extend to the\nsubstantive (as opposed to the procedural) reasons that justify a\ndecision. For example, if public reason supports democratic\ndecision-making, then the justification for a decision is that it has\nbeen made democratically. Of course, a political decision that is\nlegitimate in virtue of the procedure in which it has been made may\nnot be fully just. But this is just a reflection of the fact that\nlegitimacy is a weaker idea than justice.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the public reason account focuses on\nconvergence, not consensus (Gaus 2011; Vallier 2011; Vallier and\nMuldoon 2020). A political decision is legitimized on the basis of\npublic reason, on this account, if reasonable persons can converge on\nthat decision. They need not agree on the\u2014substantive or\nprocedural\u2014reasons that support a decision. Instead, it is\nargued, it is sufficient for political legitimacy if all can agree\nthat a particular decision should be made, even if they disagree about\nthe reasons that support this decision. Note that the convergence\nneeds not be actual; it can be hypothetical.\n\nAccounts that emphasize political participation or political influence\nregard a political decision as legitimate only if it has been made in\na process that allows for equal participation of all relevant persons.\nThey thus see political legitimacy as dependent on the participation\nor influence of all, to paraphrase Bernard Manin\u2019s (1987)\nexpression, not on the will of all, as consent theories do, or on a\njustification all can access, as public reason accounts do. Older\naccounts of this kind focus on democratic participation (Pateman\n1970). Newer accounts include deliberative democracy accounts (Manin\n1987), Philipp Pettit\u2019s equal control view (Pettit 2012), and\nLafont\u2019s theory of democratic legitimacy (Lafont 2019).\n\nRousseau\u2019s solution to the problem of how to explain the\nlegitimacy of political decisions has influenced many contemporary\ndemocratic theorists (see section 4.3.). One of the important\ndepartures from Locke\u2019s version of social contract theory that\nRousseau proposes is that tacit consent is not sufficient for\npolitical legitimacy. Without citizens\u2019 active participation in\nthe justification of a state\u2019s laws, Rousseau maintains, there\nis no legitimacy. According to Rousseau, one\u2019s will cannot be\nrepresented, as this would distort the general will, which alone is\nthe source of legitimacy: \u201cThe engagements that bind us to the\nsocial body are obligatory only because they are mutual\u2026 the\ngeneral will, to be truly such, should be general in its object as\nwell as in its essence; \u2026 it should come from all to apply to\nall; and \u2026 it loses its natural rectitude when it is directed\ntowards any individual, determinate object\u201d (Rousseau,\nSocial Contract, II:4; see also ibid. I:3 and Rawls\n2007: 231f).\n\nRousseau distinguishes among a citizen\u2019s private will, which\nreflects personal interests, a citizen\u2019s general will, which\nreflects an interpretation of the common good, and the general will,\nwhich truly reflects the common good. A democratic decision is always\nabout the common good. In democratic decision-making, citizens thus\ncompare their interpretations of the general will. If properly\nconducted, it reveals the general will. This is the legitimate\ndecision.\n\nActive participation by all may not generate a consensus. So why would\nthose who oppose a particular decision be bound by that decision?\nRousseau\u2019s answer to this question is the following. On\nRousseau\u2019s view, citizens can\u2014and will want to\u2014learn\nfrom democratic decisions. Since the democratic decision, if conducted\nproperly, correctly reveals the general will, those who voted against\na particular proposal will recognize that they were wrong and will\nadjust their beliefs about what the general will is. In this ingenious\nway, individuals are only bound by their own will, but everyone is\nbound by a democratic decision.\n",
