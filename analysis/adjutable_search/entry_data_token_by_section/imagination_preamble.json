    "main_text": "\n\nTo imagine is to represent without aiming at things as they actually, presently, and subjectively are. One\ncan use imagination to represent possibilities other than the actual,\nto represent times other than the present, and to represent\nperspectives other than one\u2019s own. Unlike perceiving and\nbelieving, imagining something does not require one to consider that\nsomething to be the case. Unlike desiring or anticipating, imagining\nsomething does not require one to wish or expect that something to be\nthe case.\n\nImagination is involved in a wide variety of human activities, and has\nbeen explored from a wide range of philosophical perspectives.\nPhilosophers of mind have examined imagination\u2019s role in\nmindreading and in pretense. Philosophical aestheticians have examined\nimagination\u2019s role in creating and in engaging with different\ntypes of artworks. Epistemologists have examined imagination\u2019s\nrole in theoretical thought experiments and in practical\ndecision-making. Philosophers of language have examined\nimagination\u2019s role in irony and metaphor.\n\nBecause of the breadth of the topic, this entry focuses exclusively on\ncontemporary discussions of imagination in the Anglo-American\nphilosophical tradition. For an overview of historical discussions of\nimagination, see the sections on pre-twentieth century and early\ntwentieth century accounts of entry on\n mental imagery;\n for notable historical accounts of imagination, see corresponding\nentries on\n Aristotle,\n Thomas Hobbes,\n David Hume,\n Immanuel Kant, and\n Gilbert Ryle;\n for a more detailed and comprehensive historical survey, see Brann\n1991; and for a sophisticated and wide-ranging discussion of\nimagination in the phenomenological tradition, see Casey 2000.\n",
