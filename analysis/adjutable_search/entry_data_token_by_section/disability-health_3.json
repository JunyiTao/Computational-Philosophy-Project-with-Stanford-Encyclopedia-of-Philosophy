    "main_text": "Disability and Well-Being || Cognitive Disability and Well-Being\n1.3 Cognitive Disability and Well-Being\n\nThe differences among standard accounts of well-being are particularly\nsignificant in thinking about the well-being of people with severe\ncognitive impairments. We believe that a separate discussion of this\ntopic is warranted, but not because cognitive impairments are in a\nclass by themselves. As we have noted, there are great differences\namong all types of impairments. Cognitive impairments, however, have\nuntil recently received relatively little attention in philosophy, and\nwe give them special emphasis as a corrective.\n\nSubjective accounts of well-being, hedonic and simple-desire accounts,\nappear easier to apply to people with such impairments, for two\nreasons. First, joy, pain, satisfaction, and frustration are more\nreadily conveyed and assessed than the more complex mental states that\ninformed-desire and objective list theories take into account. Second,\npeople with cognitive impairments appear less capable of enjoying or\nattaining some items on standard objective lists: not merely various\nforms of achievement, but also a variety of social relationships and\naesthetic experiences. More broadly, persons with cognitive\nimpairments may be unable to form and pursue a conception of the good\nlife. The conviction that persons with severe cognitive impairments\ncan and often do enjoy relatively high levels of well-being thus seems\nto favor a more subjective account of well-being than that adopted for\neveryone else.\n\nEven Martha Nussbaum (2006), a strong proponent of an objective\naccount of well-being and of the capabilities of people with\ndisabilities, fears that the premium her capabilities account places\non choice may be excessive in assessing the well-being of people with\nthe most severe cognitive disabilities, who lack the capacity to make\nmeaningful choices in some or many domains. She favors a greater\nemphasis on functionings than capabilities for people with cognitive\ndisabilities: on what they actually do or experience than on their\ncapacity to choose among experiences, activities, and life plans. This\nsuggests a way to modify her account so that more people with such\ndisabilities reach a threshold of well-being. But it adopts different\nstandards for people with severe cognitive disabilities as compared to\nother people, and raises the question of where and how to draw the\nline between those to whom each standard applies.\n\nSome disability scholars may worry that the use of a double-standard\nis fraught with elitism and condescension. But it has a stubborn\nappeal, insofar as objective accounts seem too demanding when applied\nto cognitively disabled people. Jeff McMahan concedes that it seems\n\u201cdeeply and perniciously inegalitarian\u201d to place people\nwith severe congential cognitive impairments in a separate comparison\nclass from cognitively normal people for purposes of assessing their\nwell-being (2001: 160).\nBut he argues that it is even less plausible and attractive to view\nsuch individuals as suffering grave misfortune, however well they do\nwith their limited potential.\n\nOf course, it could simply be the case that all else equal, people\nwith severe cognitive disabilities do have lower levels of well-being\nthan people without these disabilities. But all else need not be\nequal: it may be that many people with cognitive disabilities can\nachieve levels of well-being as high as others if they receive certain\nforms of support. For example, recognizing that cognitively disabled\npersons may require assistance if they are to develop and carry out\nconceptions of the good life, Nussbaum (2006, 2009) and Francis (2009)\nhave proposed structured ways of assisting them to do so. Nussbaum\nsuggests that people with even severe cognitive disabilities can have\nrepresentatives or surrogates who enable them to participate, at least\nvicariously, in most social and political activities (2009; but see\nWasserman and McMahan 2012 for limits on meaningful surrogate agency);\nFrancis discusses \u201cmental prostheses\u201d that aid in\nconstructing a personal conception of the good. She offers, as an\nexample of a mental prosthesis, an actual device that allows people\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s to locate objects in their houses by touching\nan icon on their computer screen. The use of that device would not\ndeny the user agency in locating the device, any more than a\nprosthetic foot would deny its bearer agency in running (Francis 2009:\n203\u2013204). Such a device could also allow cognitively disabled\npersons to communicate their preferences, but it is unclear how it\nenables them to form a conception of the good.\n\nThese are different approaches to securing the well-being of people\nwith cognitive impairments, with different purposes. Nussbaum seeks to\nfacilitate the exercise of, or the capacity for, valuable functionings\nsuch as social affiliation, meaningful work, and political activity.\nFrancis\u2019s goal is broader and less concrete: to promote the\nparticipation of people with cognitive impairments in developing\nconceptions of the good that accord with their desires and that offer\nreasonable prospects for fulfillment.\n\nBoth approaches receive some support from empirical research.\nDisability theorists such as Goode 1994 and Ferguson 2001\nmaintain that people with significant cognitive and communicative\nimpairments can and do have the capacity to choose among alternatives\nif those choices can be formulated in ways they can comprehend, or if\ntheir non-impaired intimates or caregivers can learn to read the ways\nin which they actually express their preferences, in order to help\nthem make their lives go the way they want.\n",
