In more recent times,\nhowever, the pornography debate has taken on a somewhat new and\nsurprising shape. Some feminists have found themselves allied with\ntheir traditional conservative foes in calling on the state to regulate\n(some) pornography\u2014although the primary focus of feminist concern\nis not obscenity, but rather on (alleged) harms to women. And some\nliberals have joined pro-censorship feminists in suggesting that the\nharms that violent, degrading and misogynistic pornography causes to\nwomen\u2019s social standing and opportunities may be sufficiently great to\njustify legal regulation of it. Many others, both liberals and\nfeminists, remain unconvinced. They are doubtful that pornography is a\nsignificant cause of sexual oppression, or that the \u201cblunt and\ntreacherous\u201d instrument of the law is the best solution to\npornography\u2019s harms. As we shall see, debates over whether and how\n(some) pornography is harmful, and what should be done about harmful\ntypes of pornography, are very much alive (Altman and Watson 2018;\nMcGowan 2019; Mikkola 2019).\n", "toc": [{"#WhatPorn": "1.

What is Pornography?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t define pornography,\u201d one judge once famously\nsaid, \u201cbut I know it when I see it\u201d (Justice Stewart in\nJacobellis v. Ohio 378 US 184 [1964]). Can we do better?\n\nThe word \u201cpornography\u201d comes from the Greek for writing\nabout prostitutes. However, the etymology of the term is not much of a\nguide to current usage, since many of the things commonly called\n\u201cpornography\u201d nowadays are neither literally written nor\nliterally about prostitutes.\n\nHere is a first, simple definition. Pornography is any material\n(either pictures or words) that is sexually explicit. This\ndefinition of pornography may pick out different types of material in\ndifferent contexts, since what is viewed as sexually explicit can vary\nfrom culture to culture and over time. \u201cSexually explicit\u201d\nfunctions as a kind of indexical term, picking out different features\ndepending on what has certain effects or breaks certain taboos in\ndifferent contexts and cultures. Displays of women\u2019s uncovered ankles\ncount as sexually explicit in some cultures, but not in most western\ncultures nowadays (although they once did: the display of a female\nankle in Victorian times was regarded as most risqu\u00e9). There may\nbe borderline cases too: do displays of bared breasts still count as\nsexually explicit in various contemporary western cultures? However,\nsome material seems clearly to count as sexually explicit in many\ncontexts today: in particular, audio, written or visual representations\nof sexual acts (e.g., sexual intercourse, oral sex) and exposed body\nparts (e.g., the vagina, anus and penis-especially the erect\npenis).\n\nHowever, this first simple definition is not quite right. Anatomy\ntextbooks for medical students are sexually explicit \u2013 they depict\nexposed genitalia, for example \u2013 but are rarely, if ever, viewed as\npornography. Sexual explicitness may be a necessary condition for\nmaterial to count as pornographic, but it does not seem to be\nsufficient. So, something needs to be added to the simple definition.\nWhat else might be required?\n\nHere is a second definition. Pornography is sexually explicit\nmaterial (verbal or pictorial) that is primarily designed\nto produce sexual arousal in viewers. This definition is better:\nit deals with the problem of anatomy textbooks and the like. Indeed,\nthis definition is one that is frequently employed (or presupposed) in\ndiscussions of pornography and censorship (e.g., Williams 1981). Of\ncourse, it is important to distinguish here between sexually explicit\nmaterial that is wholly or primarily designed to\nproduce sexual arousal (i.e., whose only or overriding aim is to\nproduce sexual arousal) and material whose aim is to do this in order\nto make some other artistic or political point. The film Last Tango\nin Paris arguably aims to arouse audiences, but this is not its\nprimary aim. It does so in order to make a broader political point.\n Within the general class of pornography, so defined, there is\nenormous variety in content. For example, some material depicts women,\nand sometimes men, in postures of sexual display (e.g., Playboy\ncenterfolds). Some depicts non-violent sexual acts (both homosexual\nand heterosexual) between adults portrayed as equal and consenting\nparticipants. Feminist pornography is a subset of pornography (in this\ngeneral sense) that aims to subvert traditional gender roles, bodies,\nand narratives unreflectively endorsed by mainstream heterosexual\npornography. Other sexually explicit representations depict acts of\nviolent coercion: people being whipped, beaten, bound, tortured,\nmutilated, raped and even killed. Some sexually explicit material may\nbe degrading without necessarily being overtly violent. This material\ndepicts people (most often women) in positions of servility and\nsubordination in their sexual relations with others, or engaged in\nsexual acts that many people would regard as humiliating. Some\nsexually explicit material involves or depicts children. Some portrays\nbestiality and necrophilia; and so on. Researchers often distinguish\nbetween \u2018hardcore\u2019 and \u2018softcore\u2019 porn;\n\u2018egalitarian\u2019 and \u2018inegalitarian\u2019 porn; or\nbetween \u2018violent\u2019, \u2018non-violent and\ndegrading\u2019, and \u2018non-violent and non-degrading\u2019\npornography, since different types of pornography may be harmful to\ndifferent degrees and in different ways.\n\nThe decades following the advent of the internet have seen an\nexplosion in the amount of readily accessible pornography; and\npornography use is common among adolescents as well as adults.\nPornography production and distribution is now a massive and highly\nprofitable international industry, with a multibillion-dollar annual\nturnover.\n\nThe two definitions considered above are purely\ndescriptive: They leave it open whether pornography is good or\nbad. By contrast, a third approach to defining pornography is\nvalue-laden. Sometimes when people describe something (e.g., a\nbook such as Tropic of Capricorn or a film such as Baise\nMoi) as \u201cpornographic,\u201d they seem to be doing more\nthan simply dispassionately describing its sexually explicit content or\nthe intentions of its producers\u2014indeed, in these debates, the\nintentions of producers are sometimes treated as irrelevant to the\nwork\u2019s status as pornography. They seem to be saying, in addition, that\nit is bad\u2014and perhaps also that its badness is not\nredeemed by other artistic, literary, or political merit the work may\npossess. (Consider, for example, how the term \u201cvisual\npornography\u201d is sometimes used to condemn certain artworks, often\nwhen the work is not even sexually explicit.)\n\nThis suggests a third definition: pornography is sexually explicit\nmaterial designed to produce sexual arousal in consumers that is\nbad in a certain way. This definition of pornography is\nvalue-laden because it is built into the definition that pornography is\n(somehow) bad; material that is not bad in the relevant way is not\npornography. It might be that all and only sexually explicit\nmaterial is bad in the relevant way (e.g., obscene), in which case\n\u201cpornography\u201d will refer to all and only the class of\nsexually explicit materials. But it may be that only some\nsexually explicit material has the (allegedly) objectionable property\n(e.g., subordinating women), in which case only that objectionable\nsubset of sexually explicit material will count as\npornography. And, of course, it is possible that no sexually\nexplicit material is bad in the relevant way (e.g., harmful to women),\nin which case we would have an error theory about pornography: there\nwould be no pornography, so defined, merely harmless, sexually explicit\n\u201cerotica\u201d.\n\nSeveral influential approaches define pornography as sexually\nexplicit material that is (somehow) bad\u2014although they disagree\nboth about why pornography is bad and exactly what\nmaterials are pornographic. A particularly influential approach, which\nhas provided the dominant legal framework for understanding pornography\nin the U.S. and U.K., has been to define pornography in terms of\nobscenity. Material counts as obscene if an average,\nreasonable person applying community standards would find the work as a\nwhole to lack any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific\nvalue, and the work describes or depicts in an obvious way offensive\nsexual conduct. On this conception, which is employed by many of\npornography\u2019s conservative critics, pornography should be regulated\nbecause it transgresses certain (allegedly) shared community standards\nof morality or decency, and thus counts as obscene. Conservatives\nusually class all sexually explicit material\u2014even\negalitarian sexually explicit \u201cerotica\u201d\u2014within the category of\npornography since conservatives typically view all such material as\nobscene. (For critical discussions of this obscenity approach, see\nSchauer 1982; Feinberg 1987; MacKinnon 1987.)\n\nBut the badness of pornography need not reside in obscenity.\nPornography might be defined, not as sexually explicit material that is\nobscene, but as sexually explicit material that harms women.\nThus, many contemporary feminist definitions define\n\u201cpornography\u201d as material (pictures and/or words) that\ndepicts women\u2019s subordination in such a way as to endorse,\nencourage or eroticize it (Longino 1980; MacKinnon\n1987). This definition of pornography leaves it open in principle that\nthere might be sexually explicit material that is not pornography:\nsexually explicit material that does not depict women\u2019s subordination,\nor that depicts but does not endorse it, will count as harmless\n\u201cerotica.\u201d Determining whether a given film or image\nfunctions to endorse oppressive social hierarchies is complex and\ncontext-sensitive; it depends not simply on the intrinsic content of\nthe film or image, or on the intentions of its creators, but also on\nhow it is interpreted or used on a particular occasion (McGowan 2019,\nCh. 6). The very same material (e.g., a graphic documentary film about\nthe sex trade) could count as pornographic in one context (e.g., if\nused for masturbation) but not in another (e.g., when shown in gender\nstudies class). Likewise, although it may depict sexual\nrelations of domination and subordination, BDSM material may not\nfunction to endorse oppressive sexual hierarchies on many or\nmost occasions of use. If so, it would not be pornographic in this\ncurrent value-laden sense, but rather harmless \u201cerotica\u201d.\n\nOf course, women may not be the only people harmed by the production\nor consumption of certain sorts of sexually explicit material. The\nconsumption of sexually explicit material has often been thought to be\nharmful to its (predominantly male) consumers: for example, by making\nthem less likely to have long-term, loving sexual relationships. Many\npeople strongly object to \u201cchild pornography,\u201d that subset\nof sexually explicit material that involves depictions of actual\nchildren engaged in sexual activity. This class of sexually explicit\nmaterial is widely regarded as objectionable because it involves the\nactual sexual exploitation of children, together with a permanent\nrecord of that abuse which may further harm their interests.\n\nI have discussed how, on this third approach to defining\n\u201cpornography\u201d as sexually explicit material that is bad or\nharmful in a certain way, there are three possibilities:\n\u201cpornography\u201d might name all, some or\neven no sexually explicit material, depending on what (if\nany) class of sexually explicit material is in fact bad in the\nrelevant way.  But it is worth noting that there is an interesting\nfourth possibility.  It is possible that some non-sexually\nexplicit material might also turn out to be bad in the\nrelevant way. It might be that some non-sexually explicit material is\nobscene in the relevant sense (e.g., Andres Serrano\u2019s famously\ncontroversial artwork entitled \u201cPiss Christ,\u201d which\ndisplays a plastic crucifix in urine with cow\u2019s blood). Or it might\nturn out that non-sexually explicit advertising that depicts women in\npositions of sexual servility in such a way as to endorse or eroticize\nthat subordination is also bad in the relevant way. (As many\nphilosophers might be inclined to put the point, the sexually explicit\nmaterials that subordinate women via their depiction of women as\nsubordinate may turn out not to form a natural kind.) In this case,\nthere are two options.  \u201cPornography\u201d might be taken to\nname only the sexually explicit subset of material that is\nbad in the relevant sense (e.g., that depicts women as men\u2019s sexual\nsubordinates in such a way as to endorse their subordination); or\n\u201cpornography\u201d might be taken to refer to all the\nmaterial that is bad in that way, whether that material is sexually\nexplicit or not. The former option would clearly stick more closely to\nthe everyday conception of pornography as involving the sexually\nexplicit. But it might be that this ordinary conception, on\nreflection, turns out not to capture what is of moral and political\nimportance. There may thus be a theoretical reason to conceive of\npornography more broadly than simply sexually explicit material that\nis bad in a certain way, or perhaps simply to invent a new term that\ncaptures the theoretically interesting kind.  Some feminists seem\ninclined to this broader approach, suggesting that material that\nmerely implies certain messages about sex can sometimes count as\npornography if it contributes in certain ways to sexualized violence\nor oppression (Longino 1980; MacKinnon 1984). This may include some\nnon-sexually explicit material that would not ordinarily be thought of\nas pornography: for example, photographs in artwork, advertising or\nfashion spreads that depict women bound, chained, or bruised in such a\nway as to endorse or eroticize this treatment.\n\nThe term \u201cpornography\u201d is used in all of these different\nways in everyday discourse and debate, as well as in philosophical\ndiscussions. Sometimes it is used to mean merely material which is\nsexually explicit; sometimes it is used to mean material which is\nsexually explicit and objectionable in some particular way;\nand so on. (For further discussion, see Rea 2001.) We do not need to\nchoose between these different definitions, for all of them capture\nsomething of the term\u2019s everyday use and different definitions may be\nuseful for different purposes. What matters crucially is that we know\nwhich definition is being used on a particular occasion. The fact that\n\u201cpornography\u201d has different senses can have two very\nunfortunate consequences if these differences are not clearly noted and\nkept in mind: It can make it seem that there is disagreement when there\nis not; and it can obscure the real nature of the disagreement when\nthere is.\n\nHere is one topical example of how this might happen. Some feminists\nobject to pornography on the grounds that it harms women. Others claim\nthat pornography may not always be harmful to women and may even\nsometimes be liberating and beneficial. It seems that there is genuine\ndisagreement here. But is there? Not necessarily. For the two sides\nmight mean different things by \u201cpornography.\u201d Suppose that\nfeminists who object to pornography are defining\n\u201cpornography\u201d as sexually explicit material that\nsubordinates women. So, pornography, for them, is that subset of\nsexually explicit material that in fact harms women. This definition\nmakes it definitionally true that pornography, wherever it exists, is\nbad for women. Those who defend pornography, however, may be using\n\u201cpornography\u201d to mean simply sexually explicit material\naimed or used primarily for sexual arousal (regardless of whether it is\nharmful to women). There may thus be no genuine disagreement here, for\nboth sides might agree that sexually explicit material that\nharms women is objectionable. They might also agree that there\nis nothing objectionable about sexually explicit material that does not\nharm women (or anyone else). If different parties are using\n\u201cpornography\u201d in different senses they may be talking past\neach other, perhaps without realizing it.\n\nTwo really substantive issues at stake in the feminist debate over\npornography are 1) whether any sexually explicit material is\nin fact harmful to women; and, if so, what should be done about it?;\nand 2) whether all sexually explicit material is in fact\nharmful to women; and, if so, what should be done about it? (We can\nthus phrase two of the important issues, if we like, without mentioning\n\u201cpornography\u201d at all.)\n2. The Shape of the Traditional Pornography Debate\n2.1 Conservative Arguments for Censorship\n\nUntil comparatively recently, the main opposition to pornography\ncame from moral and religious conservatives, who argue that pornography\nshould be banned because its sexually explicit content is obscene and\nmorally corrupting. By \u201cpornography,\u201d conservatives usually\nmean simply sexually explicit material (either pictures or words),\nsince conservatives typically view all such material as obscene.\n\nAccording to conservatives, the sexually explicit content of\npornography is an affront to decent family and religious values and\ndeeply offensive to a significant portion of citizens who hold these\nvalues. The consumption of pornography is also bad for society. It\nundermines and destabilizes the moral fabric of a decent and stable\nsociety by encouraging sexual promiscuity, deviant sexual practices and\nother attitudes and behaviour that threaten traditional family and\nreligious institutions and which conservatives regard as intrinsically\nmorally wrong. Furthermore, pornography is bad for those who consume\nit, corrupting their character and preventing them from leading a good\nand worthwhile life in accordance with family and religious values.\n\nAccording to conservatives, the state is justified in using its\ncoercive power to uphold and enforce a community\u2019s moral convictions\nand to prevent citizens from engaging in activities that offend\nprevailing community standards of morality and decency (e.g., Devlin\n1968; Sandel 1984.) This position is sometimes called \u201clegal\nmoralism.\u201d Governments also have a responsibility to prevent\ncitizens from harming themselves. This is true even where the citizen\nis not a child (who may not yet be competent to make responsible\njudgements for themselves about what is in their own best interests),\nbut a mature adult who is voluntarily engaged in an activity which they\njudge to be desirable and which causes no harm to others. The view that\nthe state is entitled to interfere with the freedom of mentally\ncompetent adults against their will for their own good is often called\n\u201clegal paternalism.\u201d\n\nConservatives therefore think that it is entirely legitimate for the\nstate to prohibit consenting adults from publishing and viewing\npornography, even in private, in order to protect the moral health of\nwould-be consumers and of society as a whole (Baird and Rosenbaum\n1991).\n2.2 The Traditional Liberal Defense of a Right to Pornography\n\nTraditional liberal defenders of pornography famously disagree,\nrejecting both the principle of legal moralism and the principle of\nlegal paternalism, at least where consenting adults are concerned. This\nis not to say that liberal defenders of pornography necessarily approve\nof it. Indeed, they frequently personally dislike and disapprove of\npornography \u2013 especially violent and degrading pornography. Many concede\nthat pornography \u2013 by which they usually mean sexually explicit material\nwhose primary function is to produce sexual arousal in viewers \u2013 is\n\u201clow value\u201d speech: speech that contributes little, if\nanything, of intellectual, artistic, literary or political merit to the\nmoral and social environment. But this does not mean that it should not\nbe protected \u2013 quite the opposite. A vital principle is at stake for\nliberals in the debate over pornography and censorship. The principle\nis that mentally competent adults must not be prevented from expressing\ntheir own convictions, or from indulging their own private tastes,\nsimply on the grounds that, in the opinion of others, those convictions\nor tastes are mistaken, offensive or unworthy. Moral majorities must\nnot be allowed to use the law to suppress dissenting minority opinions\nor to force their own moral convictions on others. The underlying\nliberal sentiment here is nicely captured in the famous adage (often\nattributed to the French philosopher, Voltaire): \u201cI disapprove of\nwhat you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say\nit.\u201d[1]\n\nFor liberals, there is a very strong presumption in favor of\nindividual freedom and against state regulation that interferes with\nthat freedom. The only ground that liberals typically regard\nas providing a legitimate reason for state restrictions on individual\nfreedom is in order to prevent harm to others. Hence, in\ndebates over censorship and other forms of state regulation that\nrestrict the liberty of individuals against their will, the burden of\nproof is always firmly on those who argue for censorship to demonstrate\nthat the speech or conduct in question causes significant harm to\nindividuals other than those consenting adults directly involved in its\nproduction and use. It must either be shown to directly cause actual\nphysical violence to others (e.g., murder, rape, assault,\nbattery), on a narrower understanding of \u201charm\u201d; or to\ndeliberately or negligently violate sufficiently important\ninterests or rights of others, on a broader,\ninterest-based conception of \u201charm\u201d. (For further\ndiscussion of these different conceptions of harm to others, see\nDyzenhaus 1992; Feinberg 1987.)\n\nLiberals have traditionally defended a right to pornography on three\nmain grounds. (The \u201cright to pornography\u201d here, and in what\nfollows, means the negative right of consenting adults not to be\nprevented from making, publishing, exhibiting, distributing and\nconsuming pornography in private). The first ground is freedom of\nspeech or expression, which protects the freedom of individuals\n(in this case, pornographers) to express their opinions and to\ncommunicate those opinions to others, however mistaken, disagreeable or\noffensive others may find \nthem.[2]\nLiberals have tended to conceive of freedom,\nincluding freedom of expression, as negative freedom \u2013 as\nnon-interference by others \u2013 rather than as positive freedom, which\ninvolves having the positive goods and facilities required to exercise\nthe freedom.[3]\nFreedom is thus something that individuals\nhave just so long as there are no coercive external obstacles \u2013 notably,\nphysical or legal restrictions \u2013 in their way.\n\nFew liberals nowadays think that the (negative) right to freedom of\nspeech is an absolute right: a freedom that can never legitimately be\nrestricted by the state. If the speech causes sufficiently great harm\nto others, then the state may have a legitimate interest in regulating\nor preventing it. There is no simple general formula or algorithm for\ndetermining when the harm caused to others is \u201csufficiently\ngreat\u201d to justify legal restrictions in the case of speech and\nmore generally. This will depend on the outcome of a complex process of\ncarefully weighing and balancing the strength and nature of the harm\nand the competing interests at stake, and an analysis of the costs and\nbenefits of alternative policies, that needs to be undertaken on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nHowever, when it comes to legislation that interferes with free\nspeech, the liberal presumption against legislation is especially high.\nFor liberals take freedom of expression to be an especially important\nright that takes precedence over most other rights and interests\n(including equality) should they ever conflict. Levels of harm that\nwould normally be sufficient to justify regulating the conduct which\ncauses them may not be sufficiently great to justify restrictions in\ncases where the harm is caused by speech or expression. Hence, for\nliberals, justifying censorship of pornography requires that there is\nextremely reliable evidence to show that the publication or voluntary\nprivate consumption of pornography by consenting adults causes\nespecially great and serious harm to others. The harm caused\nby expression must be very certain and very great before it is\nlegitimate for a state to prohibit it. We would be justified in banning\na certain type of pornography (e.g., positive rape depictions) only\nwhen we are very sure that, on average, tokens of that type (i.e., most\nparticular positive rape depictions) cause very great harm.\n\nThis traditional free speech defense assumes (generally without much\nargument) that pornography is a form of speech or expression, in the\nsense of \u2018speech\u2019 relevant to a free speech principle. However, this\nassumption has been questioned. Frederick Schauer (1982) argues that a\nfree speech principle is designed to cover only acts of mental\ncommunication. \u201cHardcore\u201d pornography, however, is not\nprimarily in the business of mental communication: Its primary function\nis not to communicate ideas, but rather to arouse audiences sexually.\nIn this respect, it is more akin to a mechanical sex toy than a\npolitical pamphlet. If so, then just as production and use of sex toys\ncannot be defended on free speech grounds, so there is no free speech\ndefense of hardcore pornography since hardcore pornography is not\n\u201cspeech\u201d in the relevant sense. If this line of argument is\ncorrect, legal restrictions on production and consumption of\npornography should not be seen as raising any free speech concerns\nwhatsoever.\n\nSecondly, liberals have defended a right to pornography on the\ngrounds of a right to privacy (or \u201cmoral\nindependence,\u201d as one prominent liberal defender of pornography,\nRonald Dworkin [1985], calls it), which protects a sphere of private\nactivity within which individuals can explore and indulge their own\npersonal tastes and convictions, free from the threat of coercive\npressure or interference by the state and other individuals. Andrew\nAltman (2018) defends a right to pornography as part of a right to\nsexual autonomy. The specter of state intrusion into the private lives\nof individuals underpins much of the liberal discomfort about\ncensorship of pornography.\n\nLike the right to freedom of speech, the liberal commitment to\nprivacy is not absolute. It can be overridden if the private activities\nof individuals are such as to cause significant harm to others. Thus,\nif there is reliable evidence to suggest that the voluntary private\nconsumption of pornography causes sufficiently great harm to others\nthen \u2013 provided that this harm is sufficiently great and that state\nprohibitions are the only effective way of preventing it \u2013 the state\nwould have a legitimate interest in prohibiting it.\n\nBut \u2013 and this is the third prong of the traditional liberal\ndefense \u2013 pornography is comparatively harmless. Neither the\nexpression of pornographic opinions, nor the indulging of a private\ntaste for pornography, causes significant harm to others in the\nrelevant sense of \u201charm\u201d (i.e., crimes of physical violence\nor other significant, wrongful rights-violations). Hence, the\npublication and voluntary private consumption of pornography is none of\nthe state\u2019s business.\n2.2.1 The Harm Principle: When is the State Justified in Restricting Individual Liberty?\n\nThese three central ingredients in the liberal defense of\npornography find their classic expression in a famous and influential\npassage from John Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty (1859). In this\npassage, Mill sets out the principle that underpins the prevailing\nliberal view about when it is justified for the state to coercively\ninterfere with the liberty of its citizens. It is a principle that\ncontinues to provide the dominant liberal framework for the debate over\npornography and censorship. Mill writes:\n\n\nThe only principle for which power can be rightfully exercised over\nany member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent\nharm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a\nsufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear\nbecause it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him\nhappier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or\neven right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or\nreasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for\ncompelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise.\nTo justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him,\nmust be calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of\nthe conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that\nwhich concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his\nindependence is, of right, absolute (Mill 1975, 15).\n\n\nMill\u2019s central claim is that society is justified in interfering\nwith the freedom of mentally competent adults to say and do what they\nwish only when their conduct will cause harm to others. This\nhas come to be known as the \u201charm principle\u201d; and it forms\nthe cornerstone of the traditional liberal defense of individual\nliberty. It protects the freedom of all mentally competent adults to\nlive however they choose, so long as they do not harm others in the\nprocess.\n\nMill goes on to stress that the harm principle is meant to apply\n\u201conly to human beings in the maturity of their faculties\u201d\n(Mill 1975,15). So, the principle permits paternalistic intervention in\nthe case of those who are not competent to make an informed decision\nabout what is in their best interests for themselves, and so who\n\u201cmust be protected against their own actions as well as external\ninjury\u201d (Mill 1975,15): for example, young children or those\nadults whose decision-making abilities are temporarily or permanently\nimpaired. Thus, if there is reliable evidence that consumption of\nviolent or misogynistic pornography impairs adolescents\u2019 ability\nto have successful long-term egalitarian sexual relationships, then\nthere is a strong liberal case for enforcing tighter age-restrictions\non consumption of pornography.\n\nIt is generally thought to follow that child pornography, which is\ntaken to involve the actual sexual abuse or exploitation of\nchildren (with or without their apparent consent), can legitimately be\nbanned in order to protect the interests of children, who are not yet\ncompetent to fully understand the nature of the choice they are making\nor to grasp the impact of their decisions on their present and future\ninterests. For the same reason, liberals think that children can quite\nrightly be prevented by parents or by the state from purchasing or\nviewing pornography if this is thought likely to harm them. That child\npornography should be banned is common ground between liberals and\nconservatives. However, pornography that involves the\nsimulated abuse of children (for example, virtual child\npornography, or consenting adult actors dressed up as schoolgirls)\ncannot legitimately be prohibited under the harm principle unless there\nis good evidence to suggest that consumption of this material causes\nsignificant harm to people other than those consenting adults involved\nin its production and consumption, for example, by causing those who\nconsume it to abuse children or by eroticizing inequality. The U.S.\nSupreme Court has ruled that virtual child pornography is protected\nspeech, partly on the basis that virtual child pornography does not\nharm actual children (Levy 2002).\n\nWe are now in a better position both to see what it would take for\nliberals to think that censorship of pornography is justified and why\nliberals have been so unsympathetic to the sort of argument against\npornography that conservatives make. Conservatives wish to prevent\nmentally competent adults from publishing and consuming pornography on\nthe grounds that the choice to consume pornography is deeply morally\nmisguided. But, as Mill insists, this is not a sufficient warrant for\ncoercive interference with individual liberty. Neither the state nor\nmoral majorities are entitled to restrict the private choices and\nactivities of individuals against their will simply because, in the\nopinion of state officials or the social majority, that way of life is\nunworthy or unrewarding. Mill thinks that this sort of legal moralism\nwill lead inevitably to a terrible \u201ctyranny of the\nmajority,\u201d crushing individual diversity and blocking human\nprogress and flourishing.\n\nHowever, following Mill, liberals are generally happy to allow that\nconsiderations of the individual or common good may entitle the state\nto use other, so-called non-coercive means to persuade\ncitizens to make wise or better choices. Thus, public education\ncampaigns designed to inform citizens of the dangers of smoking or\nexcessive alcohol consumption, or to persuade them to make\n\u201cwise\u201d choices (for example, to eat more fruits and\nvegetables) may be justified. While others cannot force an individual\nto do something (or to forbear from doing it) when they are not harming\nothers, it is entirely legitimate to seek to advise, instruct or\npersuade them. So, if there are reasons to think that pornography is\nnot good for the individual who consumes it (say, because it makes them\nless likely to be able to have successful loving or long-term\nrelationships), public education campaigns to warn consumers of these\ndangers may be justified. Indeed, education and debate is precisely the\nsolution that liberals typically recommend to counter any harm that\npornography may cause (e.g., Feinberg 1985; Donnerstein et al. 1987; R.\nDworkin 1985; for further discussion of the counter-speech response,\nsee Gelber 2021). This solution respects the freedom of rational agents\nto exercise their own rational capacities in deciding what to think and\nhow to live.\n\nHowever, liberals insist that if attempts at persuasion should fail,\nand where an individual\u2019s conduct poses no significant threat to the\nphysical security or interests of others, the state may not use\ncoercive legal mechanisms to enforce these \u201cwise\u201d choices.\n\u201cThe only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our\nown good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others\nof theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it\u201d (Mill 1975, 18).\nFor Mill, the individual person is in the best position to judge what\nis in their own best interests. Even if individuals may sometimes make\nbad choices, it is better in general that they be left free to make\nthese mistakes, for no one\u2019s opinion about the good life is infallible;\nand, in any case, a life lived \u201cfrom the inside,\u201d in\naccordance with values that the individual endorses, is more likely to\nbe happy and fulfilling than a life where the individual is forced\nagainst their will to live as others believe best.\n\nIn an influential liberal defense of pornography, Ronald Dworkin\nexpresses this commitment in terms of a right to \u201cmoral\nindependence.\u201d People, he says, \u201chave the right not to\nsuffer disadvantage in the distribution of social goods and\nopportunities, including disadvantages in the liberties permitted to\nthem by the criminal law, just on the ground that their officials or\nfellow-citizens think that their opinions about the right way for them\nto lead their own lives are ignoble or wrong\u201d (1985, 353). The\nfact, if it is one, that the majority of people in a society prefer\nthat pornography be banned because they regard it as immoral or\noffensive is not a legitimate reason for interfering with\n(pornographers\u2019) freedom of speech or for preventing consenting adults\nfrom consuming it in private. For allowing such illegitimate\n\u201cexternal\u201d preferences of a majority to dictate government\npolicy would violate the right to moral independence of the producers\nand consumers of pornography. It would give moral majorities the power\nto dictate how members of minority or non-mainstream groups can live on\nthe basis of the majority\u2019s opinions about what sort of people are most\nworthy and what sorts of lives are worth living, and this violates\nliberal ideals of state neutrality and the basic right of all\nindividuals to be treated with equal concern and respect.\n2.2.2 Pornography and Offense: Justifying Restrictions on the Public Display of Pornography\n\nHowever, Dworkin thinks, considerations of offense may provide some\njustification for preventing or restricting the public display of\npornography so as to avoid its causing offense to\nnon-consenting adults who might otherwise involuntarily or\nunwittingly be exposed to it. Joel Feinberg, another well-known liberal\ndefender of pornography, agrees. But Feinberg thinks that such\nrestrictions must be justified by a principle other than the harm\nprinciple, for he thinks that certain sorts of unpleasant psychological\nstates are not in themselves harms. Feinberg calls this additional\nprinciple the offense principle. The offense principle says\nthat \u201cIt is always a good reason in support of a proposed\ncriminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of\npreventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons\nother than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that\nend (i.e., there is probably no other means that is equally effective\nat no greater cost to the other values)\u201d (Feinberg 1999, 78; for\na more detailed discussion, see Feinberg 1985).\n\nLike Dworkin, Feinberg thinks that the voluntary private consumption\nof pornography does not cause harm to others. Hence, wholesale criminal\nprohibitions on the publication and private voluntary consumption of\npornography cannot be justified. But the public display of pornography\nmay nonetheless constitute an \u201coffensive nuisance\u201d to\nnon-consenting adults who are involuntarily exposed to it (just as\nneighbors who play loud music into the wee hours of the morning may be\nan \u201coffensive nuisance\u201d). Since the harm \u2013 or rather,\npseudo-harm \u2013 of pornography is the offense it may cause unwitting\nviewers involuntarily exposed to it, the solution is to restrict its\nexhibition to domains where such involuntary exposure will not occur,\nsuch as inside well sign-posted adult bookshops and cinemas where those\nwho will be offended will know not to venture (Feinberg 1983,\n105\u201313.) Although this may prevent pornographers from\ndistributing their opinions as widely as they might like and may also\ncause some minor inconvenience to consumers (who may have to go further\nout of their way to find and view pornography or suffer the\nembarrassment of having to sneak into known adult bookstores), these\ncosts may be relatively small compared with the level of offense that\ninvoluntary exposure is likely to cause. Such restrictions on the\npublic display of pornography would not amount to censorship, for\npornographers are still free to publish and distribute their opinions.\nNor would they violate consumers\u2019 right to privacy, for pornography\nwould be freely available for willing consumers to view in private. The\nWilliams Committee Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship in England\n(Williams 1981) made a similar recommendation, pointing to general\nconsiderations of public decency that prevent offensive public displays\nof conduct (e.g., nudity or sexual intercourse) that is appropriately\nseen or done only in private. Susan Wendell (1983) also agrees that the\npublic display of certain sorts of pornography \u2013 visual, audio and\nwritten material that depicts and condones the unjustified physical\ncoercion of women or other human beings \u2013 should be prohibited, although\nher particular concern is to remove the anxiety that involuntarily\nexposure to such coercive material is likely to cause women and the\nharm it is likely to do to their self-esteem.\n\nLiberal defenders of the right to pornography may thus allow that\nrestrictions on its public display may be justified. But only if\npornography can reliably be shown to cause significant harm to people\nother than those consenting adults involved in its production and\nconsumption will there be a legitimate case for prohibiting its\nvoluntary private consumption. When an individual\u2019s private\nactivities cause harm to others, they become no longer merely a private\nmatter but of legitimate public interest; and the state may be\njustified in regulating them. Thus, Dworkin says, were excessive\nconsumption of pornography shown to cause absenteeism from\nwork, then the public and the state might have some legitimate interest\nin preventing it. But, Dworkin thinks, there is as yet no reliable\nevidence that firmly establishes that the voluntary private production\nor consumption of pornography by consenting adults causes this or any\nother sufficiently significant harm to others in the relevant sense of\n\u201charm.\u201d Hence, pornography satisfies only harmless personal\npreferences for sexual gratification and is therefore none of the\nstate\u2019s business.\n2.2.3 Dangers of Censorship\n\nLiberals also have technical concerns about how censorship laws\nmight work in practice. Many liberal (and feminist) objections to\ncensorship of pornography point to the practical costs and dangers of\ncensorship, arguing that even if pornography does cause some harm to\nothers, the risks involved in censoring it are too great. They point to\nthe difficulties involved in formulating a legal definition of\n\u201cpornography\u201d that will be sufficiently precise to minimize\nthe danger that censorship laws targeting pornography will be used\n(intentionally or unintentionally) to censor other unpopular material,\nincluding valuable literary, artistic and political works. Censoring\npornography may thus place us on a dangerous slippery slope to further\ncensorship of other material; and may have a general chilling effect on\nexpression, making people reluctant to say or publish things that might\nbe construed as pornography and for which they could be prosecuted.\n(For further discussion, see Williams 1981; Schauer 1982; Easton,\n1994.)\n\nThese are significant dangers; and they need to be carefully taken\ninto account in weighing the costs and benefits of censorship as a\nsolution to any harm that pornography might cause. But it is worth\nnoting that they are inherent in many existing forms of legislation and\nare not always taken to be insoluble nor to constitute a decisive\nreason against censorship in themselves.\n3. Liberal Dissent\n\nAlthough traditional defenders of a right to pornography have been\nliberals, it is important to note that not all contemporary liberals\ndefend such a right. Indeed, the question of whether there might be\ngood liberal grounds for prohibiting or otherwise regulating the\nvoluntary private consumption of (some) pornography has become the\nsubject of increasing and lively debate. Inspired by more recent\nfeminist arguments against pornography, some scholars argue that the\nliberal commitment to protecting individual autonomy, equality, freedom\nof expression and other important liberal values may in fact support a\npolicy that restricts production and consumption of certain kinds of\npornography rather than the permissive stance that liberals have\ntraditionally favored (Brison 1998, 2013; Dyzenhaus 1992; Easton 1994,\n42\u201351; Langton 1990; McGowan 2019; Okin 1987; Watson 2007, 2018;\nWest 2003). These theorists do not normally reject the harm principle,\nbroadly understood: They generally agree that the crucial question in\ndetermining whether censorship of pornography is justified is whether\nthere is reliable evidence to show that the publication or viewing of\npornography by consenting adults causes sufficiently great harm to\nsignificant interests of others. Rather, they are open to the\nlegitimacy of censorship because they think that the production and\nconsumption of certain sorts of sexually explicit material\u2014in\nparticular, violent pornography and non-violent but degrading\npornography\u2014may in fact cause sufficiently significant harm to\nothers, particularly women.\n\nThese theorists often follow social science researchers in drawing\nmore fine-grained distinctions within the general category of\npornography (i.e., the sexually explicit material whose primary\nfunction is to produce sexual arousal in those who view or read them).\nThey often distinguish between 1) violent pornography, 2) non-violent\nbut degrading pornography, and 3) non-violent and non-degrading\npornography, since there is some evidence to suggest that some of these\nmaterials (e.g., in categories 1 and 2) may be harmful in ways that\nother material (e.g., category 3) is not.\n\nOne important dimension of the disagreement between those liberals\nwho defend a right to pornography and those who think that liberals\nshould be open to the legitimacy of censorship is empirical:\nThey disagree about the crucial empirical issue of whether there is\nreliable evidence to show that the production and consumption of\npornography by consenting adults in fact causes harm to others,\nparticularly women. But frequently they also disagree about some\nimportant conceptual matters as well. In particular, they may\ndisagree (albeit sometimes implicitly) about how three central elements\nof the harm principle should be understood: (i) exactly what counts as\n\u201charm\u201d to others in the relevant sense; (ii) when can we\nsay that something is a \u201ccause,\u201d or a sufficiently\n\u201cdirect cause,\u201d of a harm; and (iii) how much harm to\nothers is \u201csufficiently great\u201d to justify coercive\nsanctions against the speech or conduct that produces it. In other\nwords, they disagree about how the harm principle should be interpreted\nand applied.\n\nMany argue that more traditional liberal conceptions of the\ninterests or rights that individuals have, and so of what activities\ncan cause harm to them, is too narrow. It ignores the way in which\nthreats to individuals\u2019 interests can come not just from the state, but\nalso from other social practices and circumstances (e.g., substantive\nsocio-economic disadvantage) that can prevent the meaningful exercise\nof freedom just as effectively. The state may thus have a legitimate\nrole to play in promoting the social conditions that enable individuals\nto exercise their rights in meaningful ways and in regulating such\nactivities of non-governmental agents or groups as may serve\nsignificantly to infringe them.\n4. Feminist Approaches\n4.1 Feminist Arguments against Pornography\n\nAccording to anti-pornography feminists, pornography is not harmless\nentertainment or cathartic, therapeutic fantasy. Nor is the harm it\ncauses merely that of \u201coffense.\u201d Unlike moral\nconservatives, who object to pornography on the grounds of the\nobscenity of its sexually explicit content and its corrosive effect on\nthe conservative way of life, the primary focus of the feminist\nobjection to pornography is on the central role that pornography is\nthought to play in the exploitation and oppression of women\n(Lederer 1980; Itzin 1992; MacKinnon 1984, 1987, 1995; McGowan 2019;\nWatson 2018).\n\nThis concern is reflected in the distinctive way anti-pornography\nfeminists tend to define \u201cpornography.\u201d As we have seen,\nconservatives typically define \u201cpornography\u201d as including\nall sexually explicit material. This definition reflects the fact that\nconservatives object to pornography\u2019s sexual explicitness, which is\nobscene or appeals to \u201cprurient interests.\u201d\nAnti-pornography feminists, however, do not object to pornography\u2019s\nsexually explicit content per se. They typically draw a more\nfine-grained distinction within the class of sexually explicit\nmaterials between \u201cpornography,\u201d on the one hand, and\n\u201cerotica,\u201d on the other. \u201cErotica\u201d is generally\ndefined as sexually explicit material premised on equality, which\ndepicts women as genuinely equal and consenting participants in sexual\nencounters. \u201cPornography,\u201d in contrast, is typically\ndefined as that subset of sexually explicit material that depicts women\nbeing coerced, abused, dominated or degraded in such a way as to\nendorse their subordination. Unlike conservatives,\nanti-pornography feminists have no objection to material which is\nmerely sexually explicit, i.e., erotica, for sexually explicit material\nof this sort does not harm women. The objection is to\npornography \u2013 that subset of sexually explicit material that\nsubordinates women.\n\nIn 1983, two of the most prominent anti-pornography feminists in the\nUnited States, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, drafted an\nanti-pornography ordinance at the behest of the Minneapolis Council. A\nsimilar ordinance was passed by the Indianapolis City Council in 1984,\nbut later overturned on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds\nthat the ordinance violated pornographers\u2019 First Amendment right\nto freedom of speech. Importantly, the ordinance did not seek to impose\ncriminal prohibitions or sanctions on pornography: It did not seek to\nmake the production, sale or consumption of pornography a criminal\noffence, punishable by imprisonment (as, for example, producing,\nselling or consuming heroin is a criminal offence). MacKinnon and\nDworkin thought that criminalizing the production, publication or\nconsumption of pornography would be counterproductive, serving to drive\nthe industry underground, thereby only further obscuring the harm it\ncauses to women. Rather, the ordinance sought civil remedies\nthat would enable women who are harmed in the making of pornography, or\nas a result of its consumption, to sue for a future ban on sexually\nexplicit material demonstrated to be harmful and to collect damages\nfrom pornographers for provable harm done by that material. There is\nsome argument about whether the proposed legislation would have\namounted to censorship, strictly speaking, since it did not seek to\nplace a prior ban on the publication of pornographic materials. But\ninsofar as the legislation allowed for courts to award and enforce\ninjunctions against publication of material demonstrated to be harmful,\nmany think that the legislation may have been functionally equivalent\nto censorship in practice (assuming that courts would in fact have been\nwilling to award and enforce injunctions).\n\nThe ordinance has been the subject of a heated debate among\nfeminists, many of whom are dubious both about the centrality of\npornography\u2019s role in the subordination of women and about the\ndesirability of employing strategies of legal regulation in the pursuit\nof feminist goals (e.g., Hunter and Law 1985; Lacey 1998, 71\u201397;\nCornell 2000; Strossen 1995). But the ordinance was significant, not\nleast for reconceptualizing the question of pornography in the public\narena in feminist terms: not as an issue about obscenity or public\nindecency, as it had hitherto tended to be viewed in legal and\npolitical contexts under the influence of moral conservatives, but as\nan issue about the civil rights of women. It also provided an\ninfluential definition of pornography that has featured prominently in\nmany subsequent discussions. The ordinance defined\n\u201cpornography\u201d as a civil rights violation, as a\nsystematic practice of sexual discrimination that violates\nwomen\u2019s right to equality:\n\n\nWe define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination\nof women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are\npresented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or\n(ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or\npain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing\nsexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women\nare presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised\nor physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions\nof sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women\u2019s body parts\n\u2014 including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks\n\u2014 are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or\n(vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or\n(viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation,\ninjury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or\nhurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual (MacKinnon\n1987,176).\n\nDworkin and MacKinnon allow that sexually explicit material that\ntreats men, children or transsexuals in sexually dehumanizing or\nsubordinating ways also counts as pornography.\n\nThe Dworkin-MacKinnon definition has two parts or stages. The first\npart of the definition defines \u201cpornography\u201d broadly in\nterms of a certain functional role or, as MacKinnon puts it, in terms\nof \u201cwhat it does\u201d: \u201cPornography\u201d is that\nsexually explicit material, whatever it is, that subordinates\nwomen.[4]\nThe second part of the definition, the\ncontent list (i)-(viii), goes on to list of the sorts of sexually\nexplicit material that MacKinnon and Dworkin think in fact\nfunctions to subordinate women, as revealed by the testimonial,\nexperimental, social and clinical evidence. The content list aims to be\nsufficiently precise so as to minimize the likelihood of legislation\nagainst pornography, so defined, threatening other forms of\nspeech \u2013 although many \u201canti-censorship\u201d feminists, along\nwith traditional liberal defenders of pornography, are not convinced\nthat it succeeds (Hunter and Law 1985; R. Dworkin 1993).\n\nI draw attention to the two-stages of the definition to reinforce a\npoint made in section 1: that one might agree with Dworkin and\nMacKinnon that pornography, defined purely functionally or conceptually\nas sexually explicit material that subordinates women, would be a bad\nthing, and yet disagree that the material with the features that they\ngo on to list in fact does this. (This might help to defuse some of the\nfrequently acrimonious debate in feminist circles surrounding\nMacKinnon\u2019s now famous claim that one cannot genuinely be a feminist\nand be pro-, or at least fail to be anti-, pornography. Feminists are,\nof course, opposed to anything that subordinates or oppresses women.\nYet there is surely room for reasonable disagreement about what, if\nany, sexually explicit material does this, and whether pursuing legal\nregulation of it is a desirable feminist strategy.)\n\nThe harms that most concern anti-pornography feminists fall into two\nbroad categories: 1) coercion and exploitation of women actors in the\nproduction of pornography; and 2) indirect harms to women, both as\nindividuals and as a group, resulting from the consumption of\npornography.\n\nOne particularly graphic example of the first sort of harm is\ndocumented in the book Ordeal (Lovelace and McGrady\n1980) about Linda Marchiano, who starred as \u201cLinda\nLovelace\u201d in the famous pornographic film Deep Throat.\nIn Ordeal, Marchiano tells of how she was abducted,\nhypnotized, drugged, beaten and tortured in order to perform her\nstarring role. Marchiano was one of a number of women who testified\nabout their experience of the harm caused by pornography at the\nMinneapolis City Council hearings into pornography in 1983. (The\ntranscript of the hearings is published as Pornography and Sexual\nViolence: Evidence of the Links (see Minneapolis City Council,\n1988). Marchiano\u2019s case is a particularly horrifying and extreme\nexample of how women may be harmed in the making of pornography; and\nmuch of what was done to Marchiano (the abduction, the beatings and\nthe torture) are criminal offences in their own right.  Many, both\nliberals and feminists, think that since these physical assaults\nshould not be allowed, enduring pornographic representations of these\ncrimes that cause further harm to the victim\u2019s interests should not be\npermitted to be distributed or consumed either (MacKinnon 1987;\nWendell 1983).\n\nOf course, not all women who perform in pornography are literally\nphysically coerced as paradigm slaves are, and as Marchiano was.\nNonetheless, many anti-pornography feminists are concerned that there\nis an important sense in which the \u201cchoice\u201d to participate\nin the making of pornography may not be a genuinely free one for many\nof the women who perform in it, who often come from underprivileged\nsocio-economic backgrounds and who have few alternative options for\nmaking a living. Under these circumstances, there may be an important\nsense in which the choice to perform in pornography is coerced, insofar\nas the women would not have chosen to perform in pornography had other\nreasonable options been available to them. The pornography industry may\ntake unfair advantage of underprivileged women, preying on their\npsychic and economic vulnerability, to reap enormous profits at their\nexpense. MacKinnon puts the point graphically: Pornography is a public\ninstitution of sexual slavery, trafficking in vulnerable women and\nchildren, and profiting from their suffering and subjugation.\n\nSome of the women who perform in pornography vigorously reject the\nclaim that they are exploited. At least in their own case, they argue,\nthe decision to become a porn star was a genuinely autonomous one\n(Gruen and Panichas 1997). They regard the claim that they are victims\nof exploitation as offensively patronizing and paternalistic, implying\nthat pornography is not a worthwhile or valid career choice, and\nportraying the women who act in pornography as hapless dupes of\npatriarchy. In reality, female porn actors may be fully autonomous and\nintelligent citizens pursuing a perfectly valid and rewarding career of\ntheir own choosing. Banning pornography, they argue, would constitute\nunjustified, paternalistic interference with their right to pursue\ntheir career of choice (McElroy 1995). Of course, that the decision to\npursue a career in pornography is a free and fulfilling one for\nsome women does not show that it is necessarily a free and\nfulfilling choice for all or even most of the women who\nperform in pornography.\n\nEven if the pornography industry does exploit some of the women who\nperform in it, however, there is a question about whether this\njustifies disallowing it. As a number of feminists and liberals have\nnoted in reply, other industries (such as supermarkets or fast-food\nchains) may likewise take advantage of workers with few alternative\nopportunities. Should these too be banned on grounds of exploitation?\nSurely not, they think. The best solution to such exploitation is\narguably not to ban pornography (or fast-food chains). For this would\nonly further deprive those already deprived of one more option, and one\nthat they might prefer over others of the limited range available to\nthem. We may do better to focus our efforts on redressing the\nunderlying economic and material conditions of disadvantage that make\nexploitation possible, so that the choice to perform in pornography\nmight be made, if it is made, as a genuinely free one, under fuller\nconditions of equality (R. Dworkin 1993; Wendell, 1983).\n\nSecond, anti-pornography feminists point to a range of indirect\nharms to women that result from the consumption of pornography. (For a\nvariety of analyses here, see A. Dworkin 1981; MacKinnon 1987; Jeffreys\n1990; Kappeler 1986; Coward 1984; Smart 1989, Ch. 6; Itzin 1998.) These\nmay include, but are not limited to, pornography\u2019s role as a cause of\nviolent sexual crime. Some feminists in the U.K. have argued for\nanti-pornography legislation on the model of existing U.K. laws\npreventing racial incitement: Pornography is speech that incites sexual\nviolence, and prohibition of such speech as incites sexual violence is\njustified for the same reason as prohibitions against racially\nincendiary speech, namely, to protect the physical security and bodily\nintegrity of individuals (Itzin 1992).\n\nOther feminist arguments focus instead, or as well, on the broader\nrole pornographic representations may play in harming other of women\u2019s\nsignificant interests. Some have suggested that pornography can be\nviewed as a sort of false advertising about women and sexuality, or as\nbeing akin to libelous speech \u2013 speech that defames women as a group,\ncausing corresponding harm to their reputation, credibility,\nopportunities and income expectations. They argue that women as a group\nhave a right to (civil) legal protection from these harms and to claim\ncompensation for such harm as pornographic speech can be demonstrated\nto have produced (Longino 1980; Hill 1987; MacKinnon 1995, 3\u201328;\nfor criticism, see Soble 1985). This is a promising strategy for\nanti-pornography feminists, since liberals already generally accept\nthat individuals have a right to protection from libelous or defamatory\nspeech.\n\nOther feminist arguments focus on the related role pornography may\nplay in restricting women\u2019s autonomy by reproducing and reinforcing a\ndominant public perception of the nature of women and sexuality that\nprevents women from articulating and exploring their own conceptions of\nsexuality and of the good life (Easton 1994; Dyzenhaus 1992).\n\nYet another line of feminist argument draws on the work of the\nprominent liberal philosopher, John Rawls, to suggest that regulation\nof pornography is justified insofar as rational, self-interested\nindividuals in the original position would not agree to basic social\ninstitutions that \u201casymmetrically either forced or gave strong\nincentives to members of one sex to become sex objects for the\nother\u201d (Okin 1987, 68). Rae Langton (1990) also seeks to use\nliberals\u2019 own theoretical commitments to make a (liberal) case for the\nlegitimacy of censorship, though her chosen liberal is Ronald Dworkin.\nLangton seeks to turn the tables on Dworkin\u2019s argument in an ingenious\nway, arguing that a consistent application of Dworkin\u2019s own principles\nactually supports a policy that prohibits pornography, rather than the\npermissive policy he himself favours. Preferences to consume\npornography necessarily depend on external preferences about the\ninferior worth of women that violate women\u2019s right to moral\nindependence. Furthermore, positive arguments for prohibiting\npornography may aim at securing social equality for women. If this is\nthe goal, then, by Dworkin\u2019s own lights, pornographers would have no\nrights against a prohibitive policy.\n\nMany of these concerns figure in a somewhat new light in a\nsignificant, rights-based strand of feminist argument associated\noriginally with Catharine MacKinnon. This approach has subsequently\nbeen developed by scholars in several different ways (e.g., Bianchi\n2008; Langton 1993, McGowan 2019, Mikkola 2017, Watson 2018). On one\ndistinctive version of this approach, pornography does not merely\ncause sexual discrimination and others harms; its production\nand consumption constitutes an act of sexual discrimination\n(Langton 1993; McGowan 2019). Since this approach has provoked\nparticular interest and discussion among both liberals and feminists,\nand has come to constitute a dominant framework for much of the\ncontemporary debate between liberals and feminists over pornography, it\nis worth examining it in more detail. According to MacKinnon,\npornography harms women in a very special and serious way: by violating\ntheir civil rights (MacKinnon 1984, 1987, 1992). In\nparticular, pornography subordinates women or violates their right\nto equal civil status; and it silences them or violates their\ncivil right to freedom of speech.\n\nPornography subordinates women by sexualizing their\ninequality. Pornography both expresses the view that women exist\nprimarily as objects for men\u2019s sexual gratification \u2013 that they are\nmen\u2019s sexual slaves, and frequently their willing sexual slaves \u2013 and it\npropagates this view by conditioning consumers to regard women\u2019s\nsubordination as a sexy, natural and legitimate feature of normal\nheterosexual relations. Pornography \u201csexualizes rape, battery,\nsexual harassment, prostitution and child sexual abuse; it thereby\ncelebrates, promotes, authorizes and legitimizes them\u201d (MacKinnon\n1987, 171\u2013172). By authorizing and legitimating the subjection of\nwomen, pornography makes the very real harm of women\u2019s subordination\ninvisible as harm: Rape, harassment and other forms of oppression come\nto be seen simply as sex. \u201cThe harm of pornography, broadly\nspeaking, is the harm of the civil inequality of the sexes made\ninvisible as harm\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 178). The view of women and\nsexuality that pornography helps to form and perpetuate manifests\nitself not simply in crimes of sexual violence against women, but in\ndiscrimination against women more generally: in the legal system, in\npolitics and public debate, and in the workplace. Pornography\n\u201cinstitutionalizes the sexuality of male supremacy\u2026Men\ntreat women as who they see women as being. Pornography constructs who\nthat is\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 172). By conditioning consumers to view\nand treat women as their sexual subordinates, pornography undermines\nwomen\u2019s ability to participate as full and equal citizens in public, as\nwell as private, realms.\n\nOne significant dimension of this inequality is that women\u2019s speech,\nwhere it occurs, lacks the credibility, authority and influence of\nmen\u2019s. Women as a group are systematically and differentially\nsilenced, MacKinnon thinks; and pornography contributes to\nthis in at least three ways (MacKinnon 1987, 1995; for further\ndiscussion, see Caponetto 2021; Maitra 2009; McGowan 2017, 2019; West\n2021).\n\nFirst, pornography silences women by helping to shape and reinforce\na hostile and uncomprehending social environment which makes many women\nreluctant to speak at all. Thus, for example, rape, sexual harassment\nand other violent sexual crime is significantly underreported by\nwomen.\n\nSecond, pornography creates a social climate in which, even where\nwomen do speak, their opinions are frequently paid little serious\nattention \u2013 especially where what women say contradicts the picture of\nwomen contained in pornography. Thus, women who do report sexual crime\nare often disbelieved, ignored, ridiculed, or dismissed. In MacKinnon\u2019s\nwords, pornography \u201cstrips and devastates women of credibility,\nfrom our accounts of sexual assault to our everyday reality of sexual\nsubordination. We are stripped of authority and reduced and devalidated\nand silenced\u201d (MacKinnon 1992, 483\u2013484).\n\nThird, pornography may silence women by causing their speech to fail\nto be understood, or to be misunderstood. For example, pornography may\nhelp to form and reinforce the general view that women who utter\n\u201cno\u201d in sexual contexts frequently do not intend to refuse\na man\u2019s sexual advantages by so speaking, and indeed may often intend\nto further encourage them in order to heighten sexual excitement. In a\nsocial environment in which this expectation is prevalent, women may\nnot be able to successfully communicate the idea of refusal to others:\nAlthough they may utter the appropriate sounds (e.g.,\n\u201cno\u201d), those sounds may frequently fail to communicate the\nidea they were intended to express. Pornography may thus prevent women\nfrom communicating their ideas to others, not by preventing them from\nproducing or distributing sounds and scrawls, but by preventing those\nsounds and scrawls from securing \u201cuptake\u201d\n(\u201cillocutionary disablement\u201d) or being understood by\nhearers as expressing the idea they were intended to express (Langton\n1993; Hornsby 1995; Hornsby and Langton 1998; Maitra 2009; McGowan\n2003, 2019; McGowan, Adelman, Helmers, Stolzenberg, 2011; Mikkola 2011;\nWest 2003, 2021; for criticism, see Anthony 2011, 2017; De Gaynesford\n2010; Jacobsen 2001; Bird 2002; Bauer 2015). If pornography silences\nwomen in this way, there may be some reason to be skeptical that the\nsolution preferred by many liberals (and feminists) of countering the\nharms of pornography with more speech \u2013 protest, satire, education and\npublic debate \u2013 will be effective, for pornography may make the relevant\nspeech acts \u201cunspeakable\u201d for women.\n\nFor MacKinnon, then, a desire for pornography and sexual violence is\nnot an epiphenomenal symptom or side-effect of other material and\nsocial conditions that lie at the root of women\u2019s subordinate position\nin society, as some other feminists are inclined to think. Rather, it\nis a central cause of the subordinate position of women in society. So\nlong as there is pornography, MacKinnon thinks, women will remain\nsubordinate and silenced.\n\nOne novel and strategically ingenious feature of MacKinnon\u2019s\nargument against pornography (and one that has provoked much of the\nmore recent interest and debate) is her conceptualization of the harm\nof pornography as the violation of women\u2019s civil rights, of\nwhich sexual violence against women may be but one, albeit significant,\ndimension. The violation of civil rights is a harm that most liberals\nhave special reason for taking very seriously. While some liberals\nunderstand the notion of \u201charm\u201d to others very narrowly, as\nincluding only physical interference with a person\u2019s bodily integrity\n(e.g., murder, battery, torture, kidnap, rape and other such physical\nassaults), most liberals nowadays are inclined to accept a slightly\nbroader interpretation of the harm principle. On this broader,\ninterest- or rights-based interpretation of the harm principle, any\nspeech or conduct that willfully or negligently interferes with\nimportant interests or rights of others is harmful conduct. On\nthis interest-based interpretation of the harm principle, the state is\nentitled to pass laws against conduct that deliberately or negligently\ninterferes with the rights of others, just so long as the\nrights-violation is sufficiently serious and the harm cannot\neffectively be prevented by other, less costly means (for example,\nthrough public education or debate). Of course, how this version of the\nharm principle applies depends crucially on the nature and relative\nimportance of the rights that individuals have; and this is the subject\nof much ongoing debate.\n\nSome liberals have accepted that pornography may contribute to\nwomen\u2019s subordination: if not by directly causing crimes of sexual\nviolence, then at least by conditioning consumers to view women as sex\nobjects, rather than as autonomous individuals worthy of equal concern\nand respect. They grant that this may contribute to discrimination\nagainst women in society and that it may prevent women from having the\nsame social and political influence that men generally possess. But,\nthey argue, this harm is not sufficiently great to justify interfering\nwith pornographers\u2019 freedom of speech. The right to freedom of\nexpression is a more important right. So, if we have to choose between\nthe right to equality (of women) and the right to freedom of speech (of\npornographers), we must choose freedom of\n speech.[5]\nBut MacKinnon\u2019s\nargument, if successful, would turn the tables on these traditional\nliberal defenses of pornography: Pornography could no longer be\ndefended simply on the grounds of the primacy of the right to freedom\nof speech, for permitting pornography violates\nwomen\u2019s right to freedom of speech too. We now seem to have a\nconflict of rights: not simply between pornographers\u2019 right to freedom\nof speech and women\u2019s right to equal civil status, but within the right\nto freedom of expression itself between pornographers\u2019 right to freedom\nof speech and women\u2019s right to freedom of speech. Why should\npornographers\u2019 right to freedom of expression take precedence over\nwomen\u2019s? The next section turns to the debates surrounding this\nquestion.\n4.2 Feminist Arguments against Legal Regulation\n\nOf course, not all feminists object to pornography, even in\nMacKinnon\u2019s sense (Burstyn 1985; Chester and Dickey 1988; Cornell 2000;\nHunter and Law 1985; Gruen and Panichas 1997; Rubin 1993). The question\nof pornography and censorship has divided feminists, just as it has\nbegun to divide liberals. Some feminists argue that pornography is an\nimportant form of sexual expression that does not harm women and may\neven benefit them by liberating women and women\u2019s sexuality from the\noppressive shackles of tradition and sexual conservatism. Pornography,\non this view, is an important tool for exploring and expressing new or\nminority forms of female sexuality. Far from making downtrodden victims\nof women, pornography may have a vital role to play in challenging\ntraditional views about femininity and female sexuality and in\nempowering women, both homosexual and heterosexual, to shape their own\nidentities as sexual beings. (Note that material that benefits women\nought to count as erotica, rather than pornography, on MacKinnon\u2019s\ndefinition. So, as noted in section 1, if there is substantive\ndisagreement between \u201cpro-pornography\u201d feminists and\nMacKinnon here, it will be about whether there really is any sexually\nexplicit material that is beneficial).\n\nThere are also a significant number of feminists who object to\npornography, or to certain forms of it, on the grounds that it harms\nwomen, but who do not think that regulating or banning it is the most\ndesirable or effective way to remedy the harms that pornography causes.\nThese feminists, though not always liberals, nonetheless share some\ngeneral liberal concerns about using the \u201cblunt and\ntreacherous\u201d instrument of the law in the quest to redress harms,\nespecially in light of the way in which the law has frequently been\nused to oppress women, or where laws enacted with the best of\nintentions have nonetheless had this unintended effect. Censorship,\nthey think, may well cause more harm to women than it removes. They\nrecommend more speech \u2013 education, protest, picketing, satire\nand public debate \u2013 rather than censorship or other forms of legal\nregulation as less dangerous and more effective tools for raising\npublic consciousness and effecting the desired attitudinal and cultural\nchange. These feminists are anti-pornography (in the sense that they\nthink material that degrades women is objectionable), but they are also\nanti-censorship.\n\nIndeed, eighty individual feminists, along with the Feminist\nAnti-Censorship Taskforce (F.A.C.T.) and the Women\u2019s Legal Defense\nFund, presented an Amici Brief to the Hudnut court\noutlining a range of feminist concerns about the anti-pornography\nlegislation proposed by MacKinnon and Dworkin (Hunter and Law 1985).\nThese included concerns about the political dangers of feminists\naligning themselves with the conservative, evangelical right; the\npossibility of the legislation discriminating against minority forms of\nsexuality (e.g., lesbianism); interference with women\u2019s freedom to\nchoose to produce and perform in pornography; perpetuating traditional\nideas that sex is bad for women; and diverting attention and resources\naway from more important immediate efforts to bring an end to violence\nagainst women.\n5. Ongoing Debate: Liberals and Feminists\n\nDespite the efforts of anti-pornography feminists, many traditional\nliberal defenders of pornography remain unconvinced. They typically\ncontinue to maintain either that pornography does not cause harm to\nwomen (in the relevant, usually narrow, sense of \u201charm\u201d),\nor they admit that pornography probably does cause some harm to women\u2019s\ninterests, but deny that this harm is sufficiently great to offset the\ndangers inherent in censorship and to justify the violation of the\nrights of pornographers and would-be consumers.\n5.1 Does Pornography Cause Harm to Others? The Empirical Evidence\n\nLiberal defenders of pornography readily admit that, if there were\nreliable evidence to show that consumption of pornography significantly\nincreases the incidence of violent sexual crime, there would be a very\nstrong liberal case for prohibiting it. However, liberal defenders of\npornography remain unconvinced that there is reliable evidence to show\nthat pornography is a cause of rape or other sexual crime. Ronald\nDworkin, for example, writes \u201c\u2026in spite of MacKinnon\u2019s\nfervent declarations, no reputable study has concluded that pornography\nis a significant cause of sexual crime: many of them conclude, on the\ncontrary, that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in\nchildhood, before exposure to pornography can have had any effect, and\nthat desire for pornography is a symptom rather than a cause of\ndeviance\u201d (1993, 38).\n\nThe question of whether pornography causes harm raises tricky\nconceptual issues about the notion of causality, as well as empirical\nand methodological ones (Eaton 2007; Schauer 1987; The Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s Commission on Pornography 1986, excerpts from which are\nreprinted in Mappes and Zembaty 1997, 212\u2013218). The causal\nconnection between consumption of pornography and violent sexual crime,\nif there is one, is unlikely to be a simple one. As some liberals have\nargued, it seems implausible to think that consumption of pornography,\non a single or even repeated occasions, will cause otherwise\n\u201cnormal, decent chaps\u201d with no propensity to rape suddenly\n\u201cto metamorphose into rapists\u201d(Feinberg, 1985, 153; also\nsee entry on\n Freedom of Speech).\nHowever, we might agree with Feinberg and yet think that pornography\nmight still be a cause of rape. Consumption of pornography might cause\nrape by making it more likely that those who are already inclined to\nrape will actually rape, thereby increasing the overall incidence of\nrape. Of course, pornography may not be the only cause of rape\nor other violent sexual crime. The contributing causes of violence\nagainst women are likely to be numerous and connected in complex ways:\nthey may include, among other things, \u201cmacho values\u201d (as\nFeinberg suggests) and certain sorts of childhood events and\ncircumstances (as R. Dworkin says). But the mere fact that there may be\nother causes of sexual violence against women does not show\nthat consumption of pornography cannot also be a cause.\nConsumption of pornography may, on its own, be neither necessary nor\nsufficient for violent sexual crime (or for sexist attitudes and\nbehavior more generally); yet it might still be a cause of violent\nsexual crime and these other harms if it increases the incidence of\nthem.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider an analogy with smoking. Smoking\ncigarettes, on its own, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient\ncondition for developing lung cancer, since there are people who smoke\nlike chimneys who never develop lung cancer and live perfectly healthy\nlives to a ripe old age; and there are people who have never smoked a\ncigarette in their whole life who develop lung cancer. Yet it is\ngenerally agreed nowadays that smoking cigarettes is a cause of lung\ncancer. This is because smoking (in combination with other factors such\nas genetics, diet and exercise) makes it significantly more likely that\na person will develop lung cancer, or so the studies suggest. Likewise,\nwe might think that consumption of pornography will be a cause of\nviolent sexual crime (or of sexist attitudes and behavior more\ngenerally) if there is good evidence to suggest that consumption of\npornography increases the incidence of sexual violence or sexist\nbehavior, holding fixed other known causes of these harmful states of\naffairs.[6]\n\nThere is considerable disagreement, among social science researchers\nas well as liberal and feminist philosophers, about whether pornography\nis a cause of violent sexual crime (Donnerstein et al. 1987; Copp and\nWendell 1983; Itzin 1992). Both the final report of the Commission on\nObscenity and Pornography in the U.S. in 1970 and the Williams\nCommittee Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship in the U.K. surveyed\nthe data from clinical and experimental trials then available and found\nno evidence of a causal connection between pornography and rape\n(although the 1970 Commission did not review the evidence concerning\nsexually violent material). However, the Attorney General\u2019s Commission\non Pornography in the U.S., which submitted its final report in 1986,\nfound that the clinical and experimental research \u201cvirtually\nunanimously\u201d shows that exposure to sexually violent material\nincreases the likelihood of aggression toward women and that \u201cthe\navailable evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that substantial\nexposure to sexually violent materials\u2026bears a causal\nrelationship to antisocial acts of sexual violence and, for some\nsubgroups, possibly to unlawful acts of sexual violence\u201d (Mappes\nand Zembaty 1997, 215). The report also found that non-violent but\ndegrading pornographic material produced effects \u201csimilar to,\nalthough not as extensive as that involved with violent\nmaterial.\u201d However, the report concluded that non-degrading and\nnon-violent material (erotica, in feminist terms) \u201cdoes not bear\na causal relationship to rape and other acts of sexual\nviolence.\u201d\n\nA more recent meta-analysis revealed an overall significant positive\nassociation between pornography use and attitudes supporting violence\nagainst women in non-experimental, as well as experimental, settings\n(Hald, Malamuth and Yuen 2010).\n\nA number of studies have found a positive correlation between\nexposure to violent pornographic images (for example, of rape, bondage,\nmolestation involving weapons and mutilation) and positive reactions to\nrape and other forms of violence against women. Studies suggest, among\nother things, that exposure to violent pornography can significantly\nenhance a subject\u2019s arousal in response to the portrayal of rape, that\nexposure to films that depict sexual violence against women can act as\na stimulus for aggressive acts against women, and that prolonged\nexposure to degrading pornography (of a violent or non-violent sort)\nleads to increased callousness towards victims of sexual violence, a\ngreater acceptance of \u201crape-myths\u201d (for example, that women\nenjoy rape and do not mean no when they say \u201cno\u201d), a\ngreater likelihood of having rape-fantasies, and a greater likelihood\nof reporting that one would rape women or force women into unwanted sex\nacts if there was no chance of being caught. Skeptics, however, argue\nthat existing studies have serious limitations and flaws (Altman 2018)\nand point to countries such as Japan that have low reported rates of\nsexual assault but high rates of pornography consumption as evidence\nthat the connection between pornography consumption and sexual violence\nis weak (Strossen 1995).\n5.2 Liberals and Feminists\n\nThe empirical evidence remains the subject of ongoing debate and\ninvestigation. But in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence\nthat pornography is associated with a significant increase in violent\nsexual crime, liberals may continue to view the case for legal\nregulation as weak.\n\nHowever, the rights-based feminist arguments against pornography do\nnot rest entirely on the claim that consumption of pornography is a\nsignificant cause of violent sexual crime. The claim that pornography\ncontributes to women\u2019s inequality, and the claim that it violates\nwomen\u2019s right to freedom of speech, can rest on more moderate empirical\nclaims about which there is likely to be more agreement: for example,\nthat pornography helps to form and reinforce the view that women are\nsex objects, which manifests itself in how women are perceived and\ntreated in society and so perpetuates women\u2019s inequality. Among other\nthings, it may increase the likelihood of sexual harassment and other\nforms of discrimination against women, undermine women\u2019s credibility in\ncertain contexts, encourage a general expectation that women who say\n\u201cno\u201d in sexual contexts often do not intend to refuse, and\nso on.\n\nRonald Dworkin is one prominent liberal who has explicitly\nconsidered, and rejected, MacKinnon\u2019s version of the rights-based\narguments for anti-pornography legislation. This is not primarily\nbecause he rejects the moderate empirical claims. Rather it is because\nhe thinks that, even if those claims were true, there would be no\nlegitimate sense in which the publication and voluntary private\nconsumption of pornography violate women\u2019s civil rights.\n\nAccording to Dworkin, the argument for anti-pornography legislation\non the grounds that pornography subordinates women rests on the\n\u201cfrightening principle that considerations of equality require\nthat some people not be free to express their tastes or convictions or\npreferences anywhere\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 39). Accepting this\nprinciple would have \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d namely,\nthat \u201cgovernment could forbid the graphic or visceral or\nemotionally charged expression of any opinion that might reasonably\noffend a disadvantaged group. It could outlaw performances of The\nMerchant of Venice, or films about professional women who neglect\ntheir children, or caricatures or parodies of homosexuals in nightclub\nroutines.\u201d Dworkin\u2019s concern is a kind of logical slippery slope\nobjection that he takes to constitute a reductio of\nMacKinnon\u2019s view. The worry is that the principle that underpins\nMacKinnon\u2019s argument would, if consistently applied, threaten many\nother forms of speech in clearly unacceptable ways.\n\nNote that Dworkin construes \u2013 or misconstrues \u2013 MacKinnon\u2019s argument\nas a version of the old moralistic argument that objects to pornography\non grounds of its offensiveness; and, as we have seen, liberals reject\noffense as legitimate grounds for preventing the voluntary consumption\nof pornography in private. However, MacKinnon\u2019s argument does not \u2013 or\nneed not \u2013 rest on this \u201cfrightening\u201d principle. The\nfeminist case is not that pornography should be regulated because it\nexpresses opinions that are offensive to feminists. Rather, it should\nbe regulated because, offensive or not, it contributes significantly to\na regime of sexual inequality.\n\nNonetheless, this principle \u2013 that government is justified\nin prohibiting speech that contributes significantly to a group\u2019s\ninequality \u2013 is one that some liberals may find equally disturbing. For\nit may well apply to speech other than pornography, including perhaps\nthe examples that Dworkin mentions.\n\nDworkin is not alone in this concern. Other liberals and feminists\nhave questioned MacKinnon\u2019s focus on pornography as the key site of\nwomen\u2019s oppression when it seems that many other non-sexually\nexplicit materials plausibly also endorse and perpetuate a view of\nwomen as sex objects, albeit perhaps in less graphic and explicit\nforms. (Perhaps this lack of explicitness makes them more insidious,\nand hence of more, rather than less, concern.) Pornography may\nsexualize women\u2019s inequality, but advertising and romance\nnovels plausibly glamorize and romanticize it\nrespectively and hence may celebrate, authorize and legitimize women\u2019s\ninequality in the same way as pornography (e.g., Cocks 1989; Coward\n1984; Valverde 1985; Kappeler 1986; Skipper 1993). Indeed, some of\nthese other representations may be especially worrying, not simply\nbecause they may be more pervasive, but also insofar they may condition\nwomen to be complicit in their own subjection. MacKinnon\u2019s focus on the\ngraphic sexually explicit material that celebrates women\u2019s inequality\nmay thus seem arbitrary in the absence of evidence that the sexually\nexplicit subset of material is an especially significant cause of\nwomen\u2019s inequality.\n\nPerhaps there are principled, pragmatic reasons for singling out\npornography (i.e., the sexually explicit subset of the material that\nconditions people to view women as willing sex objects) for censorship\nor regulation, even if we were to agree that non-sexually explicit\nmaterial may also condition consumers to this view of women. It might\nbe that censorship of pornography would alleviate a considerable amount\nof this harm, without incurring the same costs as censoring some or all\nof the non-sexually explicit material that contributes to the harm. But\nthis is controversial.\n\nWhat about the claim that pornography violates women\u2019s right to\nfreedom of speech? The argument rests on a \u201cdangerous\nconfusion,\u201d Dworkin thinks: the confusion of positive and\nnegative liberty. It rests on the \u201cunacceptable proposition: that\nthe right to free speech includes a right to circumstances that\nencourage one to speak, and a right that others grasp and respect what\none means to say\u2026.These are obviously not rights that any\nsociety can recognise or enforce. Creationists, flat-earthers, and\nbigots, for example, are ridiculed in many parts of America now; that\nridicule undoubtedly dampens the enthusiasm that many of them have for\nspeaking out and limits the attention others pay to what they have to\nsay\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 38). But, Dworkin suggests, we surely should\nnot think that this violates their right to freedom of speech: e.g.,\nthat creationists have a legitimate claim on the state to ban the\npublication of books or videos recommending the theory of evolution on\nthe grounds that these may cause the speech of creationists to receive\nan unsympathetic or dismissive reception.\n\nDworkin concedes that it is perhaps true that the right to freedom\nof speech, if it is to be meaningful, requires that everyone has some\nopportunity to have their ideas heard: a society in which only the rich\nand powerful have access to the media may be one in which there is not\ngenuine freedom of speech. But it goes far beyond this, Dworkin thinks,\nto claim that a meaningful right to freedom of speech requires \u201ca\nguarantee of a sympathetic or even competent understanding of what one\nsays\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 38). This would license state regulation of\nspeech on a massive scale, paving the way to terrible\n\u201ctyranny\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 42).\n\nA number of commentators have developed Mackinnon\u2019s claims in the\nface of Dworkin\u2019s response, arguing that, to be valuable, freedom of\nspeech must be more than simply being free to produce and distribute\nsounds and symbols that have a meaning in a language. It requires, in\naddition, that there are not systematic barriers to audience\n\u201cuptake\u201d of speech\u2014i.e., that audiences are not\nsystematically prevented from recognizing speakers\u2019 communicative\nintentions (e.g., Hornsby and Langton 1998; West 2003; for replies, see\nJacobson 2001; Green 1998). In different ways, these commentators argue\nthat the traditional liberal conception of free speech, and of the\nright to free speech, fails to pay sufficient attention to the way\nlanguage works and, in particular, to the way in which what words\nmean \u2013 and so what it is possible for speakers to communicate or\ndo with their words \u2013 depends on social context, a context that\npornography may help to shape and perpetuate.\n\nThe traditional liberal conception of freedom of speech assumes that\npeople are free to speak just so long they are not prevented from\nproducing meaningful sounds and scrawls that others are not prevented\nfrom hearing or viewing. But we might wonder whether this is sufficient\nto protect free speech, even by liberals\u2019 own lights. A society that\npermitted the distribution of meaningful sounds and symbols, but\nsomehow managed systematically to prevent those sounds and symbols from\nbeing comprehended by audiences, would be little better as far as free\nspeech values are concerned than a society that simply prevented\ndistribution of meaningful noises altogether. Either way, speakers are\nprevented from communicating their opinions to others, which defeats\nwhat liberals take to be the point of free speech: the right of\nspeakers not to be prevented by the actions of other agents from\ncommunicating their feelings and opinions to others who might wish to\nhear them (West 2003).\n6. Non-Legal Remedies\n\nSo far, I have focused on the controversial question of whether and\nwhy legal regulation of (some) pornography\u2014either in the form of\ncriminal liability or civil penalties\u2014can be justified in a\nliberal society. But legal regulation is costly. Consequently, if there\nare less restrictive measures to prevent or counteract pornography\u2019s\nharms available, these should obviously be preferred instead\nof\u2014or as well as\u2014legal regulation.\n\nBy far the most popular alternative to regulation recommends\ncountering \u201cbad\u201d speech with more \u201cgood\u201d speech\n(Gelber 2021). In principle, this might include government sponsored\npublic education campaigns to warn consumers of the harmful effects of\nconsuming violent and misogynistic pornography, and/or to promote a\ncounter-message of sexual equality and respect for women. In practice,\nhowever, liberal states have generally taken little direct action to\ncounteract inegalitarian pornography\u2019s messages about women and sex,\npreferring to leave the burden of counter-speech entirely to private\nindividuals. Even if legal regulation of violent and misogynistic\npornography is unwarranted or undesirable all things considered, such\nstate inaction in the face of pornography\u2019s role in endorsing and\nperpetuating sexual inequality may be indefensible. If violent and\nmisogynistic pornography perpetuates and reinforces harmful sexist\nattitudes and behavior (quite apart from whether it also leads to\nsexual violence) then there may be an important role for governments to\nplay in helping to counter pornography\u2019s harmful sexist messaging\nthrough government-backed public education campaigns. Without\nrestricting anyone\u2019s speech, such campaigns would lend the epistemic\nand political authority of the state to private opinion in countering\nharmful inegalitarian messages about sex. State-backed counter-speech\nmay be especially important to inform adolescent consumers of harms\nassociated with inegalitarian pornography, and also if private\ncounter-speakers are silenced, so that counter-speech is otherwise\nliable systematically to be ignored or misunderstood (see Dotson\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u201ctestimonial quieting\u201d in Dotson 2011).\n\nIn the end, it is an empirical question what combination of legal\nand non-legal means are likely to be most effective in challenging\nsexual inequality; however, there are some reasons to think that\ncounter-speech alone may be less effective than advocates commonly\nsuppose. Firstly, if widespread consumption of pornography\n\u201csilences\u201d women, or restricts their ability successfully\nto communicate relevant counter-messages, then counter-speech is not an\noption, at least for those silenced. Secondly, pornography may affect\nconsumers\u2019 attitudes in ways that escape their conscious notice. It may\nbe going too far to liken consumers of pornography to Pavlov\u2019s dogs,\nbut it is not unreasonable to think that much of pornography\u2019s\ninfluence is less than fully mentally-intermediated, and so less\namenable to rational revision in response to counter-speech.\nConclusion\n\nWhat are the harms of pornography? How should liberal societies\nrespond to the proliferation of harmful pornography? How should\nliberals conceptualize and balance important values such as equality\nand freedom of speech? What role should the state play in protecting\nand promoting values such as autonomy and equality? Can liberal ideals\nbe reconciled with feminist principles and goals? The search for\nanswers to important questions such as these accounts for much of the\nongoing philosophical interest in the question of pornography and\ncensorship.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Altman, A. and L.
