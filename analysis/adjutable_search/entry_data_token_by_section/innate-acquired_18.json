    "main_text": "Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals || Eliminativism about the innate/acquired distinction\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe innate/acquired distinction is not only interesting in its own\nright, but also serves as an example of how the discipline of\nphilosophy can and should interact with the scientific fields it\ninvestigates. In this entry we have explored some of the historical\ndebates over nativism as they have played out within the disciplines\nof psychology and biology. Philosophical diagnoses of these debates\ntend to focus on particular historical episodes or on the work of\nindividual historical figures (e.g. Konrad Lorenz and his debate with\nLehrman). This raises an important consideration when evaluating the\ngenerality of a given philosophical diagnosis: to what extent is it\nshaped by the particular details of the scientific debate on which it\nis based? Our view is that an adequate philosophical diagnosis of what\nis at issue in scientific debates over nativism should sample from a\nbroad range of historical periods and figures.\n\nAs we have seen, the word \u201cinnate\u201d is used as a technical\nterm in scientific biology and psychology. It also has a long history\nof usage in the vernacular. This dual existence gives rise to two\ndistinct sets of issues when philosophically analyzing the concept. In\nscientific contexts, the core issue is whether some prevailing concept\nof innateness adequately serves the epistemic goals of the fields in\nwhich it is employed. It is important to note that epistemic goals can\nvary across disciplines, among research programs within a discipline,\nand potentially over time. This raises a methodological challenge for\nphilosophers attempting to evaluate a candidate scientific definition\nof innateness. To do the job well, the philosopher must assume the\nrole of an anthropologist (Dennett 1986) paying careful attention to\nthe specific ways that scientists are using the term. Some\nphilosophers have employed the tools of experimental philosophy to aid\nin this task. (Griffiths, et al. 2009; Linquist et al. 2011; Knobe and\nSamuels 2013; Machery et al. 2019)\n\nAn analysis of the vernacular concept raises a distinct set of issues.\nThe innate/acquired distinction features in socially and ethically\nimportant discussions, for example in disputes about whether human\nsexual diversity is \u2018innate\u2019. Experimental work (Section\n3.5) strongly suggests that the vernacular concept of innateness\nprojects a scientifically discredited essentialism about species onto\nnature. This does not seem a sound basis on which to discuss such\nissues (Lewens 2020). Arguably, one reason that people continue to\nhave confidence in the distinction is that they believe there are\nscientific experts who are capable of definitively classifying traits\nas innate or acquired. But as we have shown in this entry, such\nclassifications are in reality highly problematic and there is little\nagreement either about whether they have scientific value or about how\nthey should be drawn.\n",
