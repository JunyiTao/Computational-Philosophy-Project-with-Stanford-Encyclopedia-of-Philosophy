    "main_text": "Morality and freedom || Theoretical and practical autonomy\n5.1 Theoretical and practical autonomy\n\nThe fundamental idea of Kant\u2019s philosophy is human autonomy. So\nfar we have seen this in Kant\u2019s constructivist view of\nexperience, according to which our understanding is the source of the\ngeneral laws of nature. \u201cAutonomy\u201d literally means giving\nthe law to oneself, and on Kant\u2019s view our understanding\nprovides laws that constitute the a priori framework of our\nexperience. Our understanding does not provide the matter or content\nof our experience, but it does provide the basic formal structure\nwithin which we experience any matter received through our senses.\nKant\u2019s central argument for this view is the transcendental\ndeduction, according to which it is a condition of self-consciousness\nthat our understanding constructs experience in this way. So we may\ncall self-consciousness the highest principle of Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy, since it is (at least) the basis for all of\nour a priori knowledge about the structure of nature.\n\nKant\u2019s moral philosophy is also based on the idea of autonomy.\nHe holds that there is a single fundamental principle of morality, on\nwhich all specific moral duties are based. He calls this moral law (as\nit is manifested to us) the categorical imperative (see\n 5.4).\n The moral law is a product of reason, for Kant, while the basic laws\nof nature are products of our understanding. There are important\ndifferences between the senses in which we are autonomous in\nconstructing our experience and in morality. For example, Kant regards\nunderstanding and reason as different cognitive faculties, although he\nsometimes uses \u201creason\u201d in a wide sense to cover\n both.[19]\n The categories and therefore the laws of nature are dependent on our\nspecifically human forms of intuition, while reason is not. The moral\nlaw does not depend on any qualities that are peculiar to human nature\nbut only on the nature of reason as such, although its manifestation\nto us as a categorical imperative (as a law of duty) reflects the fact\nthat the human will is not necessarily determined by pure reason but\nis also influenced by other incentives rooted in our needs and\ninclinations; and our specific duties deriving from the categorical\nimperative do reflect human nature and the contingencies of human\nlife. Despite these differences, however, Kant holds that we give the\nmoral law to ourselves, as we also give the general laws of nature to\nourselves, though in a different sense. Moreover, we each necessarily\ngive the same moral law to ourselves, just as we each construct our\nexperience in accordance with the same categories. To summarize:\n\nTheoretical philosophy is about how the world is (A633/B661). Its\nhighest principle is self-consciousness, on which our knowledge of the\nbasic laws of nature is based. Given sensory data, our understanding\nconstructs experience according to these a priori laws.\nPractical philosophy is about how the world ought to be (ibid.,\nA800\u2013801/B828\u2013829). Its highest principle is the moral\nlaw, from which we derive duties that command how we ought to act in\nspecific situations. Kant also claims that reflection on our moral\nduties and our need for happiness leads to the thought of an ideal\nworld, which he calls the highest good (see section\n 6).\n Given how the world is (theoretical philosophy) and how it ought to\nbe (practical philosophy), we aim to make the world better by\nconstructing or realizing the highest good.\n\n\nSo both parts of Kant\u2019s philosophy are about autonomously\nconstructing a world, but in different senses. In theoretical\nphilosophy, we use our categories and forms of intuition to construct\na world of experience or nature. In practical philosophy, we use the\nmoral law to construct the idea of a moral world or a realm of ends\nthat guides our conduct (4:433), and ultimately to transform the\nnatural world into the highest good. Finally, transcendental idealism\nis the framework within which these two parts of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy fit together (20:311). Theoretical philosophy deals with\nappearances, to which our knowledge is strictly limited; and practical\nphilosophy deals with things in themselves, although it does not give\nus knowledge about things in themselves but only provides rational\njustification for certain beliefs about them for practical\npurposes.\n\nTo understand Kant\u2019s arguments that practical philosophy\njustifies certain beliefs about things in themselves, it is necessary\nto see them in the context of his criticism of German rationalist\nmetaphysics. The three traditional topics of Leibniz-Wolffian special\nmetaphysics were rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational\ntheology, which dealt, respectively, with the human soul, the\nworld-whole, and God. In the part of the Critique of Pure Reason\ncalled the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant argues against the\nLeibniz-Wolffian view that human beings are capable of a priori\nknowledge in each of these domains, and he claims that the errors of\nLeibniz-Wolffian metaphysics are due to an illusion that has its seat\nin the nature of human reason itself. According to Kant, human reason\nnecessarily produces ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God; and\nthese ideas unavoidably produce the illusion that we have a priori\nknowledge about transcendent objects corresponding to them. This is an\nillusion, however, because in fact we are not capable of a priori\nknowledge about any such transcendent objects. Nevertheless, Kant\nattempts to show that these illusory ideas have a positive, practical\nuse. He thus reframes Leibniz-Wolffian special metaphysics as a\npractical science that he calls the metaphysics of morals. On\nKant\u2019s view, our ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God\nprovide the content of morally justified beliefs about human\nimmortality, human freedom, and the existence of God, respectively;\nbut they are not proper objects of speculative\n knowledge.[20]\n",
