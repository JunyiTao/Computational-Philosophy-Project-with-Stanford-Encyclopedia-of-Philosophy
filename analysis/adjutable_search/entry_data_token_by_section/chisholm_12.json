    "main_text": "Ethics III \u2014 The Ethics of Requirement\n13. Evolution and Criticism of Chisholm\u2019s Views\n\nChisholm continued to work on a multitude of philosophical projects\nover a period of many years. Though his central convictions remained\nrelatively stable, he steadily revised the details of his formulations\nin light of criticism from others and as a result of his own\nreconsideration. Thus it is difficult to identify any chapter or paper\nas containing the final, official version of his view.\n\nNevertheless, there are several more or less fundamental Chisholmian\ndoctrines. We have sketched some of these doctrines. Here, we list\nsome things that Chisholm wrote in which he discussed the doctrines.\nWe go on to mention some books and papers by others in which they\noffer exposition or criticism of Chisholm\u2019s views.\n\nIn epistemology, Chisholm took as his fundamental primitive concept\nthe idea we express when we say that believing p is more\nreasonable for S than believing q would be. He tried to define\nother terms of epistemic evaluation by appeal to this one.\nFurthermore, he assumed that we in fact do know many of the things we\ntake ourselves to know. He thought that a person can be justified in\nbelieving many foundational propositions about his own current mental\nstate. He took one of the central projects of epistemology to be the\nformulation of epistemic principles that would show how we become\njustified in believing things about the external world, the past, and\nother problematic things on the basis of this present, internal,\nself-oriented foundation.\n\nAn early formulation of Chisholm\u2019s view can be found in [PPS].\nSubsequent formulations were presented in the three editions of [TK]\nas well as in [FK]. [FK] is a collection of essays in epistemology.\nSome were newly written for [FK], but most were slightly revised\nversions of articles that Chisholm had already published. [FK] is thus\na comprehensive presentation of Chisholm\u2019s distinctive views in\nepistemology.\n\nThree excellent critical discussions are Heidelberger (1969), Foley\n(1997), and Sosa (1997). For comprehensive examinations of\nChisholm\u2019s epistemology, see Legum (2021 [Other Internet\nResources]) and the papers in [PLRMC].\n\nOne issue in Chisholm\u2019s epistemological work that has been\nwidely discussed is the problem of the criterion. Chisholm thought\nthat the problem arises because the fundamental problems of\nepistemology were \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d and \u201cWhat are\nthe criteria for knowledge?\u201d and he argued that an answer to\neither one required a prior answer to the other. He contended that the\nproblem could be addressed only by begging the question. He defended\nthe common-sense view that we do know most of what common-sense says\nwe know. For discussion, see Amico (1993), Lemos (2004), and McCain\n(2014 [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nIn metaphysics, Chisholm maintained that certain things are genuinely\npersisting \u201csubstances\u201d. Such things literally last\nthrough time and survive changes in their properties. Each person is\nsuch a being, retaining his or her strict identity over time. On the\nother hand, ordinary physical objects can be said to persist only in\nan extended sense. Since it has undergone changes of parts,\ntoday\u2019s chair is only \u201cloosely identical\u201d with\nyesterday\u2019s chair. Chisholm thought that a complex thing could\nstrictly persist only if it retained all of its parts. Thus, he\nendorsed mereological essentialism. He thought that persons would have\nto be ontologically simple in order for it to be possible for them to\nmaintain strict identity over time and through change. Thus, we are\nnot to be identified with our bodies.\n\nAn excellent presentation of Chisholm\u2019s views on these matters\ncan be found in [P&O], as well as in his papers \u201cIs There a\nMind-Body Problem?\u201d (1978) and \u201cOn the Simplicity of the\nSoul\u201d (1991). Chapters 4, 6, 7, and 13 of [OM] are especially\nhelpful. For a brief final discussion of the metaphysics of persons,\nsee \u201cPersons and Their Bodies: Some Unanswered Questions\u201d\n(1996).\n\nPlantinga (1975) contains a clear and helpful discussion of\nChisholm\u2019s views about mereological essentialism. For a\ndrammatically non-Chisholmian view concerning the relation between a\nperson and that person\u2019s body, see Baker (2002). Although he did\nnot explictly say that he was presenting an objection to\nChisholm\u2019s view, Derek Parfit also defended a radically\ndifferent approach to the nature of persons and the conditions for\n\u201cpersonal identity\u201d in Parfit (1971).\n\nFor a penetrating critical discussion of Chisholm\u2019s metaphysics\nof persons, see Quinn (1997).\n\nAnother metaphysical view that evidently fascinated Chisholm is\nlibertarianism. According to this view, there is a special sort of\ncausation in which an event is caused at least in part by an agent.\nWhen an agent thus \u201cimminently\u201d helps to bring about some\neffect, his doing so is not determined by antecedent causal\nconditions. Thus, he freely makes something happen. This makes genuine\nmoral responsibility possible.\n\nAn early defense of this libertarianism can be found in \u201cFreedom\nand Action\u201d (1966). Another classic statement of the view can be\nfound in Chisholm\u2019s \u201cHe Could Have Done Otherwise\u201d\n(1967a). Chisholm discussed these ideas in greater detail in Chapter\nII of [P&O] and then again in Chapters 1 and 2 of [OM]. For\nfurther helpful work, including Chisholm\u2019s \u201cHuman Freedom\nand the Self,\u201d see Ekstrom (2000). See also Zimmerman (2010) and\nvon Wachter (2003).\n\nChisholm\u2019s views in ontology underwent steady pruning. In an\nearlier period he believed in necessarily existent states of affairs\nsome of which might occur and recur. He also believed in times, though\nnot in \u201cconcrete events\u201d. Later he abandoned times and\nrecurrable states of affairs in favor of a sparser ontology including\n\u201cone shot\u201d states, but lacking times. The earlier view can\nbe found in \u201cEvents and Propositions\u201d (1970), and\n\u201cStates of Affairs Again\u201d (1971), and Chapter IV of\n[P&O]. The later view appears in \u201cEvents without Times: An\nEssay in Ontology\u201d (1990). See also Chapter 16 of [OM] and\nChapter 10 of [RTC].\n\nKim 1979 contains a very helpful critical exposition of\nChisholm\u2019s early view. Both views are discussed in Brandl 1997.\nSee also Zimmerman (1997), Rosenkrantz (1998), and Steen (2008).\n\nChisholm was dubious about such things as sense data, appearances, the\n\u201clooks\u201d of things. He defended a different view about the\nontology of perception. An amusing early paper on this topic is\n\u201cThe Problem of the Speckled Hen\u201d (1942). A more extended\ndiscussion, including a presentation of Chisholm\u2019s preferred\ntheory of appearing, can be found in Chapter 8 (\u201cSensing\u201d)\nof [PPS]. More than forty years later, near the end of his career,\nChisholm made some final remarks about appearances in Chapter 13 of\n[RTC].\n\nChisholm steadily thought there is something fundamentally right about\nBrentano\u2019s Thesis \u2014 the idea that the psychological\nsomehow involves intentionality, and that in this respect it is unlike\nthe purely physical. Chisholm discussed this idea in his early paper\n\u201cSentences about Believing\u201d (1955\u20136). He discussed\nit again in Chapter 11 (\u201cIntentional Inexistence\u201d) of\n[PPS]. A summary statement of the view can also be found in\nChisholm\u2019s article \u201cIntentionality\u201d (1967c).\nChisholm returned to this topic in Part IV (Chapters 10\u201314) of\n[OM].\n\nTwo excellent critical discussions of Brentano\u2019s Thesis are\nSanford 1997 and Kim 2003.\n\nThe term \u2018Chisholm\u2019s Paradox\u2019 has been credited to\nGraeme Forbes in his \u201cTwo Solutions to Chisholm\u2019s\nParadox\u201d (1984) The topic has been discussed extensively; see,\nfor example, Salmon 1996. In his discussion of the mereological\nversion of the puzzle, Chisholm mentions Chandler 1966. Lewis 1986 is\nessential reading here. A good discussion of the whole problem of\ntransworld identity can be found in Mackie 2008.\n\nOne central Chisholmian view in ethics is the idea that all the main\nconcepts of ethics can be defined by appeal to the concept of\nrequirement. He defends this idea in his early paper\n\u201cThe Ethics of Requirement\u201d (1964) and then again ten\nyears later in \u201cPractical Reason and the Logic of\nRequirement\u201d (1974). The idea is briefly mentioned, but not\ndeveloped, in [B&IV] 53. See also Chisholm (2005).\n\nFor quite a long time Chisholm thought that the fundamental bearers of\nintrinsic value are states of affairs. He also thought that in some\ncases, the value of a state of affairs could be defeated by that\nstate\u2019s occurrence within some larger context. In this he seemed\nto be working out some ideas of Brentano and Moore. One of\nChisholm\u2019s most moving presentations of this view can be found\nin his Presidential Address before the Eastern Division of the\nAmerican Philosphical Association titled \u201cThe Defeat of Good and\nEvil\u201d (1968). Many of his ideas about defeat, enhancement,\nmitigation, and organic unities are further developed in Chapters 6,\n7, and 8 of [B&IV]. For further discussion, see Lemos (2005),\nGustafsson (2014), and Tucker (2016).\n\nNo list of Chisholm\u2019s contributions to ethics could be complete\nwithout mentioning \u201cContrary-to-Duty Imperatives and Deontic\nLogic\u201d (1963).\n",
