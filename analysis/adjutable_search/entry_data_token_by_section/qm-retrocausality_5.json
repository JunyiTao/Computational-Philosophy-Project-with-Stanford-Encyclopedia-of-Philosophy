    "main_text": "Motivation I: Exploiting Loopholes in the \u201cNo-Go Theorems\u201d || Nonlocality Theorems\n3.1 Nonlocality Theorems\n\nThe principle of local causality, according to Bell, is meant to spell\nout the idea that \n\n\n[t]he direct causes (and effects) of events are near by, and even the\nindirect causes (and effects) are no further away than permitted by\nthe velocity of light. (1990: 105) \n\n\nViolation of this principle, according to some researchers in the\nfoundations of quantum theory, indicates a fundamental incompatibility\nbetween quantum theory and the spirit, perhaps even the letter, of\nrelativity theory (Maudlin 2011). That the correlations entailed by\nquantum theory which violate local causality actually occur in nature\nhas been experimentally documented many times (for example, by\nFreedman & Clauser 1972; Aspect, Dalibard, & Roger 1982; and\nAspect, Grangier, & Roger 1982; see the entry on\n Bell\u2019s theorem,\n \u00a74 for an overview on early experiments).\n\nBell\u2019s result crucially depends not only on the assumption of\nlocal causality, but also on the assumption that whatever variables\n\\(\\lambda\\) describes in some spacetime region, which Bell calls\n\u201clocal beables\u201d, do not depend probabilistically on which\nmeasurement setting \\(\\alpha\\) some experimenters choose in the future\nof that region:  \n\\[\\tag{1}\nP(\\lambda \\mid \\alpha) = P(\\lambda)\\,. \\label{eq:independence}\n\\]\n\n\nThis is the aforementioned assumption of measurement independence. It\nis also sometimes referred to as \u201cno superdeterminism\u201d\nbecause it is incompatible with a particularly strong form of\ndeterminism (\u201csuperdeterminism\u201d) according to which the\njoint past of the measurement setting \\(\\alpha\\) and the measured\nsystem state \\(\\lambda\\) determines them both completely and induces a\ncorrelation between them. But, as pointed out in the first instance by\nCosta de Beauregard (1977a) and then by Price (1994, 1996),\nsuperdeterminism is not the only way in which Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:independence}) can be violated: if there is retrocausality\n(understood along interventionist lines as outlined in\n \u00a72.1),\n the choice of measurement setting \\(\\alpha\\) may causally influence\nthe physical state \\(\\lambda\\) at an earlier time and thereby also\nrender Eq. (\\ref{eq:independence}) incorrect. In this picture, as\npointed out by Price and Wharton (2021), it might be possible to\ninterpret the local causality-violating correlations between distant\nevents as reflecting a type of retrocausality-induced \u201ccollider\nbias\u201d. \n\nWithout Eq. (\\ref{eq:independence}), in turn, Bell\u2019s theorem can\nno longer be derived. Thus, admitting the possibility of\nretrocausality in principle reopens the possibility of giving a causal\naccount of the nonlocal correlations entailed by quantum theory as\nmediated by purely action-by-contact, spatiotemporally contiguous,\nLorentz invariant causal influences (of the type envisaged by Costa de\nBeauregard) acting between systems described by local beables.\nConcrete steps towards a model that might fulfill this promise will be\nreviewed in\n \u00a76.\n\nContrary to this narrative, Adlam (2022) argues that the attempt to\nrescue continuous-action-type locality (of the sort discussed\nin\n \u00a72.2)\n is not a good motivation for retrocausality. According to Adlam, to\nthe extent that the independently most attractive picture of causality\nis an interventionist one in combination with a block universe view,\nthere is no principled reason for assuming that causal influences are\nconfined to continuous action. Adlam provides her own motivation for\nretrocausality, based on an argument that \u201caccepting the\nexistence of genuine, unmediated nonlocality in and of itself leads us\nto accept retrocausality\u201d (2022: 422).\n",
