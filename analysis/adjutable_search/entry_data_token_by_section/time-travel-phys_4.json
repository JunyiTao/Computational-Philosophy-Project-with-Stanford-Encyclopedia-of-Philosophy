    "main_text": "Slightly More Realistic Models of Time Travel\n5. Slightly More Realistic Models of Time Travel\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer, and Thorne (1991) considered the case of\n3-dimensional single hard spherical ball that can go through a single\ntime travel wormhole so as to collide with its younger self.\n\n\n\nFigure 9 [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe threat of paradox in this case arises in the following form.\nConsider the initial trajectory of a ball as it approaches the time\ntravel region. For some initial trajectories, the ball does not\nundergo a collision before reaching mouth 1, but upon exiting mouth 2\nit will collide with its earlier self. This leads to a contradiction\nif the collision is strong enough to knock the ball off its trajectory\nand deflect it from entering mouth 1. Of course, the Wheeler-Feynman\nstrategy is to look for a \u201cglancing blow\u201d solution: a\ncollision which will produce exactly the (small) deviation in\ntrajectory of the earlier ball that produces exactly that collision.\nAre there always such\n solutions?[4]\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer & Thorne found a large class of initial\ntrajectories that have consistent \u201cglancing blow\u201d\ncontinuations, and found none that do not (but their search was not\ncompletely general). They did not produce a rigorous proof that every\ninitial trajectory has a consistent continuation, but suggested that\nit is very plausible that every initial trajectory has a consistent\ncontinuation. That is to say, they have made it very plausible that,\nin the billiard ball wormhole case, the time travel structure of such\na wormhole space-time does not result in constraints on states on\nspacelike surfaces in the non-time travel region.\n\nIn fact, as one might expect from our discussion in the previous\nsection, they found the opposite problem from that of inconsistency:\nthey found underdetermination. For a large class of initial\ntrajectories there are multiple different consistent \u201cglancing\nblow\u201d continuations of that trajectory (many of which involve\nmultiple wormhole traversals). For example, if one initially has a\nball that is traveling on a trajectory aimed straight between the two\nmouths, then one obvious solution is that the ball passes between the\ntwo mouths and never time travels. But another solution is that the\nyounger ball gets knocked into mouth 1 exactly so as to come out of\nmouth 2 and produce that collision. Echeverria et al. do not note the\npossibility (which we pointed out in the previous section) of the\nexistence of additional balls in the time travel region. We conjecture\n(but have no proof) that for every initial trajectory of \\(A\\) there\nare some, and generically many, multiple-ball continuations.\n\nFriedman, Morris, et al. (1990) examined the case of source-free\nnon-self-interacting scalar fields traveling through such a time\ntravel wormhole and found that no constraints on initial conditions in\nthe non-time travel region are imposed by the existence of such time\ntravel wormholes. In general there appear to be no known counter\nexamples to the claim that in \u201csomewhat realistic\u201d\ntime-travel space-times with a partial Cauchy surface there are no\nconstraints imposed on the state on such a partial Cauchy surface by\nthe existence of CTC\u2019s. (See, e.g., Friedman & Morris 1991;\nThorne 1994; Earman 1995; Earman, Smeenk, & W\u00fcthrich 2009;\nand Dowe 2007.)\n\nHow about the issue of constraints in the time travel region \\(T\\)?\nPrima facie, constraints in such a region would not appear to\nbe surprising. But one might still expect that there should be no\nconstraints on states on a spacelike surface, provided one keeps the\nsurface \u201csmall enough\u201d. In the physics literature the\nfollowing question has been asked: for any point \\(p\\) in \\(T\\), and\nany space-like surface \\(S\\) that includes \\(p\\) is there a\nneighborhood \\(E\\) of \\(p\\) in \\(S\\) such that any solution on \\(E\\)\ncan be extended to a solution on the whole space-time? With respect to\nthis question, there are some simple models in which one has this kind\nof extendability of local solutions to global ones, and some simple\nmodels in which one does not have such extendability, with no clear\ngeneral pattern. The technical mathematical problems are amplified by\nthe more conceptual problem of what it might mean to say that one\ncould create a situation which forces the creation of closed timelike\ncurves. (See, e.g., Yurtsever 1990; Friedman, Morris, et al. 1990;\nNovikov 1992; Earman 1995; and Earman, Smeenk, & W\u00fcthrich\n2009). What are we to think of all of this?\n",
