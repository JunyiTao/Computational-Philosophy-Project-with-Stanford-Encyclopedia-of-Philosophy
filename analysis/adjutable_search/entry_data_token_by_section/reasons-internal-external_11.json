    "main_text": "Direct, Extensional Arguments || Relative Explanatory Power\n3.3 Relative Explanatory Power\n\n\nAny evaluation of whether Actual State reasons internalism is\nsimpler, more elegant, or explanatorily more powerful than any possible\nexternalist view will have to turn on an evaluation of this kind of\nexternalist explanatory strategy. If internal reasons could be\nsimply derivative from external reasons, and external reasons could be\nindependently explained, then Actual State reasons internalism will\nhave very little traction on these grounds. If the derivation of\ninternal reasons from external reasons turns out to be unsuccessful,\nhowever, or external reasons themselves are difficult to explain, then\nActual State reasons internalism will gain traction as an explanatory\nhypothesis. Schroeder (2007b) attacks the derivation of internal\nreasons from external reasons; here we can go on to consider whether\nexternal reasons are themselves harder to explain than internal\nones.\n\n\nMany philosophers have held that external reasons are, in fact,\nharder to explain than internal ones; even some who were no skeptics\nabout external reasons, like Immanuel Kant (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.)  \n So what makes external reasons so puzzling? One\nidea is that they are puzzling because they leave so little on the\nbasis of which to explain why they are reasons for the people for whom\nthey are reasons. Internal reasons are shared only by certain\npeople\u2014people with the requisite desires. So Max\u2019s desires\ncan be used to explain why he has the internal reasons that he\nhas. But categorical external reasons like those Kant was\nconcerned about (and which are required in order to reconcile Moral\nRationalism with Moral Absolutism) are supposed to be reasons for any\nagent, no matter what she is like. So the only thing to which we\ncan appeal in order to explain why Max has these reasons is the fact\nthat Max is an agent. Some philosophers have accordingly\ninvested great energy in developing robust enough accounts of agency to\nbe able to explain moral reasons. For example, Christine\nKorsgaard (1996) maintains that reasons derive from the demands of\nautonomy, or being regulated by stable principles that define\nones\u2019 self, which she identifies as a necessary condition for\nacting at all.\n\n\nHowever, even accounts that derive reasons from the nature of agency\nmay ultimately vindicate some form of internalism. David Velleman\n(1996), for example, argues that agency is characterized by a\nparticular higher-order inclination\u2014to \u2018behave in, and out\nof, a knowledge of what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Although this is a\nkind of desire, it is distinct from the contingent desires that might\nbe satisfied by particular actions and which internalists usually\nidentify as the source of our reasons. Velleman accordingly\ndescribes his view as a \u2018fainthearted externalism\u2019, but it\nremains a form of internalism according to the scheme presented\nhere.\n\n\nSome advocates of various forms of internalism have complained that\nadvocacy of external reasons amounts to nothing more than\n\u2018bluff\u2019 (Williams 1979). A natural way to understand\nthis idea is as the complaint that external reasons theorists leave us\nwith too few constraints on what reasons could be, and hence are able\nto make whatever claims about reasons they want (so long as they\nendorse them in a serious enough tone of voice, perhaps), with no\nindependent way of checking their plausibility. This complaint\ncould be a fair one against externalists who are willing to offer no\ngeneral theory about or constraints on reasons, but it is unfair in\ngeneral. Externalists may simply look for discipline and unity in\ntheir views about reasons from a source distinct from facts about\nmotivation or motivational psychology. Value-based theorists, for\nexample, tie their claims about reasons to commitments about what is\nvaluable. So their claims about what we have reasons to do are\nchecked by the plausibility of the corresponding theses about what is\nvaluable.\n",
