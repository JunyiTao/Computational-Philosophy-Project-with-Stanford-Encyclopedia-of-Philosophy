    "main_text": "Mendelssohn, Winckelmann, and Lessing: Mixed Emotions || Winckelmann\n4.2 Winckelmann\n\n Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717\u20131768), the son of a cobbler\n from Prussia, studied at Halle and Jena, and became a school\n teacher. But at thirty-one he got a position as a librarian for a\n nobleman in Dresden, and gained access to the court of the Elector\n of Saxony, home of one of the great art collections of Europe, and\n also a Catholic court that ultimately gave him access to Rome. He\n established his reputation in 1755 with an essay \u201cOn the\n Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture.\u201d He moved\n to Rome later that year, in the service of the Papal Nuncio to the\n Saxon court, and in 1758 entered the service of Cardinal Allessandro\n Albani, the nephew of Pope Clement XI and owner of a great\n collection of antiquities. In 1764 Winckelmann published The\n History of Ancient Art to great acclaim. He was working on a\n revision of it when he was murdered in Trieste in June of 1768,\n while returning to Rome from Vienna, where the Empress Maria Theresa\n had awarded him a collection of gold and silver medallions.\n\n\nWinckelmann spent his two years in Halle (1738\u201340) while\nBaumgarten was still teaching there and Meier was also a student.  But\nhis writing offers no evidence that he knew their\nworks. His History of Ancient Art does cite Du Bos, Batteux,\nand the essays of Hume, however, and he had clearly absorbed some of\nthe most general ideas of eighteenth-century aesthetics. A 1763 essay\n\u201cOn the Capacity for the Sentiment for the Beautiful in Art, and\non Instruction in it\u201d suggests several of the premises assumed\nthroughout his work on ancient art history. He shares with Wolff and\nBatteux the assumption that art derives its beauty from the imitation\nof nature, and derives the most beauty from the imitation of beauty in\nnature. Thus he writes that\nArt, as an imitator of nature, should always seek\nout what is natural for the form of beauty, and should avoid, as much\nas is possible, all that is violent, because even the beauty in life\ncan become displeasing through forced gestures. (\u201cOn the\nCapacity for the Sentiment for the Beautiful in Art,\u201d Essays\non the Philosophy and History of Art, volume I, p. xlvi)\n\n\nHowever, Winckelmann believes that natural beauty\nitself lies not merely in the superficial appearance of bodies but,\nat least in the case of human beauty, is an expression of the thought\nand character of persons: \nAbove all things, one\nis to be attentive to the particular, characteristic thoughts in\nworks of art, which sometimes stand like expensive pearls in a string\nof inferior ones, and can get lost among them. Our contemplation\nshould begin with the effects of the understanding as the most worthy\npart of beauty, and from there should descend to the execution\n\n\na point that he illustrates with examples from\nthe paintings of Poussin, Corregio, and Domenichino rather than from\nancient art (\u201cThe Sentiment for the Beautiful,\u201d p. xlv).\nWinckelmann clearly belongs to the tradition that finds beauty in the\ntruthful representation of the objective perfections of body and mind,\nrather than in the stimulation of the play of the mental powers of the\naudience for beauty.\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s premises underlie his history of ancient art, the main\nclaims of which are already evident in his 1755 essay \u201cOn the\nImitation of the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks.\u201d This\nessay begins with the claim that \u201cThere is but one way for the\nmoderns to become great, and perhaps unequalled; I mean, by imitating\nthe ancients\u201d (Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of\nthe Greeks, p. 2; in Essays on the Philosophy and History of\nArt, volume I). His topic is thus in the first instance the\nimitation of ancient art, not imitation in ancient\nart. Winckelmann then attributes the excellent of ancient, that is to\nsay Greek, art to three factors: first, nature in ancient Greece was\nparticularly favorable to the development of beautiful bodies; second,\nthe \u201cnatural\u201d way of life in Greece was particularly\nfavorable to the observation of beautiful bodies and thus to their\nimitation in art; and finally, Greek thought and character\nwere particularly noble, and thus the external beauty of Greek bodies\nwas an expression of the beauty of the Greek mind as the \u201cmost\nworthy part of beauty.\u201d The first of these claims is in the\ntradition of the emphasis of the influence of climate on human\ncharacter and society initiated by Du Bos and continued by many\neighteenth-century thinkers, including Montesquieu in The Spirit\nof the Laws (1748).\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s second point is that the Greek climate and way of life\nwere conducive to the development of art. He makes the general claim\nthat freedom is conducive to the development of art:\nArt claims liberty: in vain would nature produce\nher noblest offsprings, in a country where rigid laws would choke her\nprogressive growth, as in Egypt, that pretended parent of sciences and\narts: but in Greece, where, from their earliest youth, the happy\ninhabitants were devoted to mirth and pleasure, where narrow-spirited\nformality never restrained the liberty of manners, the artist enjoyed\nnature without a veil.\n\n\nWinckelmann then makes the specific point that\nfreedom from excessive clothing among the Greeks, particularly in\ntheir gymnastic and athletic exercises, gave their artists\nunparalleled opportunity to observe and to learn to represent the\nbeauty of their bodies:\nThe Gymnasies, where, sheltered by public modesty,\nthe youths exercised themselves naked, were the schools of\nart\u2026. Here beautiful nakedness appeared with such a liveliness\nof expression, such truth and variety of situations, such a noble air\nof the body, as it would be ridiculous to look for in any hired model\nof our academies. (\u201cImitation,\u201d pp. 9\u201310)\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s reference to expression and\nnobility here points the way to his last claim, that above all the\nbodily beauty of the Greeks is an expression of their mental and moral\nbeauty:\nThe last and most eminent characteristic of the\nGreek works is a noble simplicity and sedate grandeur in Gesture and\nExpression. As the bottom of the sea lies peaceful beneath a foaming\nsurface, a great soul lies sedate beneath the strife of passions in\nGreek figures. (\u201cImitation,\u201d p. 30)\n\n\n\nWinckelmann illustrates the last claim with a discussion of the famous\nstatue of the Trojan priest Laoco\u00f6n and his sons being strangled by\nthe serpents Neptune sent to stifle his warnings against accepting the\n\u201cgift\u201d of the Trojan horse. The version of this statue\nthat was unearthed near Naples in 1506 and quickly acquired by Pope\nJulius II for the Vatican, where it has been displayed ever since, is\nnow thought to be a Roman copy of a Pergamese bronze from the second\ncentury BCE, and may or may not be the same one described by Pliny\n(Natural History, XXXV). Winckelmann took it to be a\nclassical Greek work. He also must have known it only from\nillustration when he first wrote about it in \u201cOn the Imitation\nof the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks,\u201d since he moved to\nRome only after that essay was published. Be that as it may,\nWinckelmann writes:\n\n\n\u2019Tis in the face of Laoco\u00f6n this soul shines with full lustre, not\nconfined however to the face, amidst the most violent\nsufferings. Pangs piercing every muscle, every labouring nerve; pangs\nwhich we almost feel ourselves, while we consider\u2014not the face,\nnor the most expressive parts\u2014only the belly contracted by\nexcruciating pains: these however, I say, exert not themselves with\nviolence, either in the face or gesture. He pierces not heaven, like\nthe Laoco\u00f6n of Virgil; his mouth is rather opened to\ndischarge an anxious overloaded groan, as Sadolet says; the\nstruggling body and the supporting mind exert themselves with equal\nstrength, nay balance all the frame.\n\n\nLaoco\u00f6n suffers, but suffers like the Philoctetes\nof Sophocles: we weeping feel his pains, but wish for the\nhero\u2019s strength to support his misery.\n\n\nThe Expression of so great a soul is beyond the force of mere\nnature. It was in his own mind the artist was to search for the\nstrength of spirit with which he marked his marble. Greece enjoyed\nartists and philosophers in the same persons; and the wisdom of more\nthan one Metrodorus directed art, and inspired its figures with more\nthan common souls.\n\n\n\nThe last paragraph of this is somewhat contorted: since Laoco\u00f6n was\nnot himself a classical Greek, but a pre-classical Trojan, Winckelmann\ndoes not quite attribute the \u201cnoble simplicity and quiet\ngrandeur\u201d that shines through his face even in the midst of his\nsuffering to him and to nature as it might have been at work in Troy,\nbut rather to the classical Greek artist whom he supposes did make the\nstatue. But his basic point remains: since in his view the statue\nitself was Greek, the noble simplicity and quiet grandeur of the Greek\nsoul inevitably manifests itself and elevates these figures caught in\na moment of supreme suffering to the highest level of beauty.\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s History of Ancient Art, published nine years\nafter the essay on imitation, reaffirms his general commitment to\ncontemporary aesthetics as well as his particular emphasis on a\ncertain kind of mental condition as the ultimate source of physical\nbeauty. It nevertheless gives a slightly different and perhaps more\nplausible account of the Laoco\u00f6n statue, which by then he had seen\nfirst-hand. To general statements on beauty as unity and simplicity\n(History, p. 196) and the beauty of youthfulness (p. 197)\nWinckelmann adds a passage on the expression of inward attitude that\nis reminiscent of his description of the \u201cnoble simplicity and\nquiet grandeur\u201d of the Greeks in the earlier\nessay: \n\nExpression is an imitation of the active and suffering states\nof our minds and our bodies and of passions as well as\ndeeds\u2026Stillness is the state most proper to beauty, as it is to\nthe sea, and experience shows that the most beautiful beings are of a\nstill and well-mannered nature.  (History, p.  204)\n\n\nBut, as noted, in the History\nWinckelmann gives a slightly different account of the Laoco\u00f6n, in\nwhich he suggests that the beauty of the central figure of the work\nlies not so much in the nobility of character that is\nexpressed in spite of Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s agony, but rather in a kind\nof harmony between his agony and his nobility:\nLaoco\u00f6n is a being in the greatest pain, fashioned\nin the likeness of a man seeking to gather the conscious strength of\nhis mind and spirit against it\u2026. Beneath the brow, the battle\nbetween pain and resistance, as if concentrated in this one place, is\ncomposed with great wisdom\u2026Thus, where the greatest pain is\nexpressed, the greatest beauty is also to be\nfound.
