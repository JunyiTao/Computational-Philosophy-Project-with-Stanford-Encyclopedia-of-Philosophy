Since according to the representational\ntheory, sensory qualities themselves are real or unreal environmental\nproperties, the theory suggests that the qualities too are wide, and\nmolecularly identical subjects could experience different qualities.\nDretske (1996) and Lycan (1996, 2001) have explicitly defended this\n\u201cphenomenal externalism,\u201d though in our present\nterminology it should be called \u201cqualitative\u201d externalism.\nSome other representationalists reject this idea and believe sensory\nqualities to be narrow, necessarily shared by molecular duplicates.\nShoemaker (1994), Horgan (2000), Kriegel (2002b), Levine (2003) and\nChalmers (2004) defend narrow representationalism. (Rey (1998) calls\nhis view \u201ca narrow representationalist account of qualitative\nexperience,\u201d but it is not an account of sensory qualities in\nthe present sense; if anything Rey favors the elimination of those\nqualities.) For some arguments on each side, see Section 4.6.\n",
