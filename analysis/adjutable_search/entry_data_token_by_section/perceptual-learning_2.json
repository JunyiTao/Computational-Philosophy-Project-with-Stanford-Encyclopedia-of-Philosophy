    "main_text": "Defining Perceptual Learning || Perceptual Learning as Perceptual Changes\n1.2 Perceptual Learning as Perceptual Changes\n\nPerceptual learning involves changes in\n perception.[2]\n This rules out mere changes in aesthetic taste, among other things.\nFor instance, imagine a contrarian who likes things only insofar as\nother people do not like those things. Suppose he finds out that\neveryone else has come to like his favorite microbrew. This might\ncause him to change how he judges that beer aesthetically. However,\nthe beer may well taste the same to him. So, it is not a case of\nperceptual learning, but a mere change in the person\u2019s aesthetic\njudgment. The fact that perceptual learning involves changes in\nperception also rules out mere changes in belief. Suppose someone\nacquires the belief that the symphony movement they are hearing is a\nscherzo. If nothing changes in that person\u2019s perception, this is\nnot a case of perceptual learning. It is a change in the\nperson\u2019s belief, not a change in the person\u2019s\nperception.\n\nIt is important here to distinguish perceptual learning from learning\nthat is simply based on perception (see Dretske 2015: fn.\n 6).[3]\n Perceptual learning involves changes in perception, while learning\nthat is based on perception need not. Looking at my table, I might\nlearn that the cup is on the table. However, this does not involve any\nlong-term changes in perception. It is learning that is based on\nperception, but it is not perceptual learning. Furthermore, I might\nlearn to put the cup on the table into the dishwasher every time it is\nempty. Again, this is learning that is based on perception (I need to\nperceive the cup in order to move it). However, it is not perceptual\nlearning. \n\nOne of the main reasons for holding that improvements in perceptual\ndiscrimination can be genuinely perceptual is due to somewhat recent\nevidence from neuroscience. As Manfred Fahle puts it, during the 1970s\nand 1980s, it tended to be the case that improvements in perceptual\ndiscrimination were thought to be cognitive rather than perceptual\n(2002: xii). However, during the 1990s, pressure was put on the\ncognitive interpretation due to new neuroscientific evidence in\nperceptual learning studies. In particular, studies found that\nlearning-induced plasticity occurs in the adult primary sensory\ncortices much more than researchers had previously thought (Fahle\n2002: xii). Neurological evidence of plasticity in adult primary\nsensory cortices due to learning provides some evidence that changes\nin perceptual discrimination can be due to perceptual learning.
