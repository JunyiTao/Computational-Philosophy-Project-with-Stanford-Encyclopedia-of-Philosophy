    "main_text": "The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem || Likelihood Ratio Convergence When No Falsifying Outcomes are Possible\n5. When the Likelihoods are Vague or Diverse\n\nUp to this point we have been supposing that likelihoods possess\nobjective or agreed numerical values. Although this supposition is\noften satisfied in scientific contexts, there are important settings\nwhere it is unrealistic, where hypotheses only support vague\nlikelihood values, and where there is enough ambiguity in what\nhypotheses say about evidential claims that the scientific\ncommunity cannot agree on precise values for the likelihoods of\nevidential\n claims.[18]\n Let us now see how the supposition of precise, agreed likelihood\nvalues may be relaxed in a reasonable way.\n\nRecall why agreement, or near agreement, on precise values for\nlikelihoods is so important to the scientific enterprise. To the\nextent that members of a scientific community disagree on the\nlikelihoods, they disagree about the empirical content of their\nhypotheses, about what each hypothesis says about how the\nworld is likely to be. This can lead to disagreement about which\nhypotheses are refuted or supported by a given body of evidence.\nSimilarly, to the extent that the values of likelihoods are only\nvaguely implied by hypotheses as understood by an individual agent,\nthat agent may be unable to determine which of several hypotheses is\nrefuted or supported by a given body of evidence.\n\nWe have seen, however, that the individual values of likelihoods are\nnot really crucial to the way evidence impacts hypotheses. Rather, as\nEquations 9\u201311 show, it is ratios of likelihoods that\ndo the heavy lifting. So, even if two support functions \\(P_{\\alpha}\\)\nand \\(P_{\\beta}\\) disagree on the values of individual likelihoods,\nthey may, nevertheless, largely agree on the refutation or support\nthat accrues to various rival hypotheses, provided that the following\ncondition is satisfied: \n\nDirectional Agreement Condition:\n\nThe likelihood ratios due to each of a pair of support functions\n\\(P_{\\alpha}\\) and \\(P_{\\beta}\\) are said to agree in\ndirection (with respect to the possible outcomes of experiments\nor observations relevant to a pair of hypotheses) just in\ncase\n\nwhenever possible outcome sequence \\(e^n\\) makes \n\n\\[\\frac{P_{\\alpha}[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}{P_{\\alpha}[e^n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}  \\lt 1,\\]\n\n it\nalso makes \n\n\\[\\frac{P_{\\beta}[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}{P_{\\beta}[e^n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}  \\lt 1;\\] \nwhenever possible outcome sequence \\(e^n\\) makes \n\n\\[\\frac{P_{\\alpha}[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}{P_{\\alpha}[e^n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}  \\gt 1,\\]\n\n it\nalso makes \n\n\\[\\frac{P_{\\beta}[e^n \\pmid  h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}{P_{\\beta}[e^n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]}  \\gt 1;\\] \neach of these likelihood ratios is either close to 1 for both of\nthese support functions, or is quite far from 1 for both of\n them.[19]\n\n\n\n\nWhen this condition holds, the evidence will support \\(h_i\\) over\n\\(h_j\\) according to \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) just in case it does so for\n\\(P_{\\beta}\\) as well, although the strength of support may differ.\nFurthermore, although the rate at which the likelihood ratios\nincrease or decrease on a stream of evidence may differ for the two\nsupport functions, the impact of the cumulative evidence should\nultimately affect their refutation or support in much the same way.\n\n\nWhen likelihoods are vague or diverse, we may take an approach similar\nto that we employed for vague and diverse prior\nplausibility assessments. We may extend the vagueness sets\nfor individual agents to include a collection of inductive support\nfunctions that cover the range of values for likelihood ratios of\nevidence claims (as well as cover the ranges of comparative support\nstrengths for hypotheses due to plausibility arguments within\nb, as represented by ratios of prior probabilities). Similarly,\nwe may extend the diversity sets for communities of agents to\ninclude support functions that cover the ranges of likelihood ratio\nvalues that arise within the vagueness sets of members of the\nscientific community.\n\nThis broadening of vagueness and diversity sets to\naccommodate vague and diverse likelihood values makes no trouble for\nthe convergence to truth results for hypotheses. For,\nprovided that the Directional Agreement Condition is\nsatisfied by all support functions in an extended vagueness\nor diversity set under consideration, the Likelihood\nRatio Convergence Theorem applies to each individual support\nfunction in that set. For, the the proof of that convergence theorem\ndoesn\u2019t depend on the supposition that likelihoods are objective\nor have intersubjectively agreed values. Rather, it applies to each\nindividual support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\). The only possible problem\nwith applying this result across a range of support functions is that\nwhen their values for likelihoods differ, function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) may\ndisagree with \\(P_{\\beta}\\) on which of the hypotheses is favored by a\ngiven sequence of evidence. That can happen because different support\nfunctions may represent the evidential import of hypotheses\ndifferently, by specifying different likelihood values for the very\nsame evidence claims. So, an evidence stream that favors \\(h_i\\)\naccording to \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) may instead favor \\(h_j\\) according to\n\\(P_{\\beta}\\). However, when the Directional Agreement\nCondition holds for a given collection of support functions, this\nproblem cannot arise. Directional Agreement means that the\nevidential import of hypotheses is similar enough for \\(P_{\\alpha}\\)\nand \\(P_{\\beta}\\) that a sequence of outcomes may favor a hypothesis\naccording to \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) only if it does so for \\(P_{\\beta}\\) as\nwell.\n\nThus, when the Directional Agreement Condition holds for all\nsupport functions in a vagueness or diversity set\nthat is extended to include vague or diverse likelihoods, and provided\nthat enough evidentially distinguishing experiments or observations\ncan be performed, all support functions in the extended\nvagueness or diversity set will very probably come\nto agree that the likelihood ratios for empirically distinct false\ncompetitors of a true hypothesis are extremely small. As that happens,\nthe community comes to agree on the refutation of these competitors,\nand the true hypothesis rises to the top of the\n heap.[20]\n\n\nWhat if the true hypothesis has evidentially equivalent rivals? Their\nposterior probabilities must rise as well. In that case we are only\nassured that the disjunction of the true hypothesis with its\nevidentially equivalent rivals will be driven to 1 as evidence lays\nlow its evidentially distinct rivals. The true hypothesis will itself\napproach 1 only if either it has no evidentially equivalent rivals, or\nwhatever equivalent rivals it does have can be laid low by\nplausibility arguments of a kind that don\u2019t depend on the\nevidential likelihoods, but only show up via the comparative\nplausibility assessments represented by ratios of prior\nprobabilities.\n",
