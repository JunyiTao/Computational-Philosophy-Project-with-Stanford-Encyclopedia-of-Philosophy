    "preamble": "\n\nNietzsche\u2019s moral philosophy is primarily critical in\norientation: he attacks morality both for its commitment to untenable\ndescriptive (metaphysical and empirical) claims about human agency, as\nwell as for the deleterious impact of its distinctive norms and values\non the flourishing of the highest types of human beings\n(Nietzsche\u2019s \u201chigher men\u201d). His positive ethical\nviews are best understood as combining (i) a kind of consequentialist\nperfectionism as Nietzsche\u2019s implicit theory of the good, with\n(ii) a conception of human perfection involving both formal and\nsubstantive elements. Because Nietzsche, however, is an\nanti-realist about value, he takes neither his positive\nvision, nor those aspects of his critique that depend upon it, to have\nany special epistemic status, a fact which helps explain his rhetoric\nand the circumspect character of his \u201cesoteric\u201d\nmoralizing. Although Nietzsche\u2019s illiberal attitudes\n(for example, about human equality) are apparent, there are no grounds\nfor ascribing to him a political philosophy, since he has no\nsystematic (or even partly systematic) views about the nature of state\nand society. As an esoteric moralist, Nietzsche aims at freeing higher\nhuman beings from their false consciousness about morality (their\nfalse belief that this morality is good for them), not at a\ntransformation of society at large.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Critique of Morality\n1.1 Scope of the Critique: Morality in the Pejorative Sense\n\nNietzsche is not a critic of all \u201cmorality.\u201d He\nexplicitly embraces, for example, the idea of a \u201chigher\nmorality\u201d which would inform the lives of \u201chigher\nmen\u201d (Schacht 1983: 466\u2013469), and, in so doing, he employs\nthe same German word \u2014 Moral, sometimes\nMoralit\u00e4t \u2014 for both what he attacks and what he\npraises. Moreover, Nietzsche aims to offer a revaluation of existing\nvalues in a manner that appears, itself, to involve appeal to broadly\n\u201cmoral\u201d standards of some sort. As he writes in the\nPreface to Daybreak: \u201cin this book faith in morality\n[Moral] is withdrawn \u2014 but why? Out of\nmorality [Moralit\u00e4t]! Or what else should we call\nthat which informs it \u2014 and us?\u2026.[T]here is no\ndoubt that a \u2018thou shalt\u2019 [du sollst] speaks to\nus too\u201d (D 4). This means, of course, that morality as the\nobject of Nietzsche\u2019s critique must be distinguishable from the\nsense of \u201cmorality\u201d he retains and employs.\n\nYet Nietzsche also does not confine his criticisms of morality to some\none religiously, philosophically, socially or historically\ncircumscribed example. Thus, it will not suffice to say that he simply\nattacks Christian or Kantian or European or utilitarian morality\n\u2014 though he certainly at times attacks all of these. To do\njustice to the scope of his critique, we should ask what characterizes\n\u201cmorality\u201d in Nietzsche\u2019s pejorative sense \u2014\nhereafter, \u201cMPS\u201d \u2014 that is, morality as the object\nof his critique.\n\nNietzsche believes that all normative systems which perform something\nlike the role we associate with \u201cmorality\u201d share certain\nstructural characteristics, even as the meaning and value of these\nnormative systems varies considerably over time. In particular, all\nnormative systems have both descriptive and\nnormative components, in the sense that: (a) they presuppose\na particular descriptive account of human being and human agency, in\nthe sense that for the normative claims comprising the system to have\nintelligible application to humans, particular metaphysical and\nempirical claims about human beings and agency must be true; and (b)\nthe system\u2019s norms favor the interests of some people, often\n(though not necessarily) at the expense of others. Any particular\nmorality will, in turn, be the object of Nietzsche\u2019s critique\n(i.e., MPS) only if it:\n\npresupposes three particular descriptive claims about the nature\nof humans pertaining to free will, the transparency of the self, and\ntheir essential similarity in morally relevant respects (\u201cthe\nDescriptive Component\u201d); and/or\nembraces norms that harm the \u201chighest men\u201d while\nbenefiting the \u201clowest\u201d (\u201cthe Normative\nComponent\u201d).\n\n\nWhile Nietzsche offers criticisms of both the Descriptive and\nNormative Components of MPS, what ultimately defines MPS as against\nunobjectionable normative systems is the distinctive normative agenda.\nThus, while Nietzsche criticizes the description of agency that is\npart of many versions of MPS, he also holds that \u201c[i]t is\nnot error as error that\u201d he objects to fundamentally in\nMPS (EH IV;7): that is, it is not the falsity of the\ndescriptive account of agency presupposed by MPS, per se,\nthat is the heart of the problem, but rather its distinctive normative\ncommitments. Thus, strictly speaking, it is true that an MPS would be\nobjectionable even if it did not involve a commitment to an untenable\ndescriptive account of agency (as, say, certain forms of\nutilitarianism do not). Because Nietzsche\u2019s two most common\n\u2014 and closely related \u2014 specific targets are, however,\nChristian and Kantian morality, the critique of the descriptive\ncomponent of MPS figures prominently in Nietzsche\u2019s writing, and\nany account of the logic of his critique that omitted it would not do\njustice to his concerns.\n1.2 Critique of the Descriptive Component of MPS\n\nMPS for Nietzsche depends for its intelligible application to human\nagents on three descriptive theses about human agency (cf. BGE 32; GM\nI:13; TI VI; EH III:5; EH IV:8):\n\n\n(1) Human agents possess a will capable of free choice (\u201cFree\nWill Thesis\u201d).\n\n(2) The self is sufficiently transparent that agents\u2019 actions\ncan be distinguished on the basis of their respective motives\n(\u201cTransparency of the Self Thesis\u201d).\n\n(3) Human agents are sufficiently similar that one moral code is\nappropriate for (because in the interests of) all (\u201cSimilarity\nThesis\u201d).\n\n\nThese three theses must be true in order for the normative judgments\nof MPS to be intelligible because the normative judgments of MPS are\nmarked for Nietzsche by three corresponding traits; namely, that\nthey:\n\n\n(1\u2032) Hold agents responsible for their actions.\n\n(2\u2032) Evaluate and \u201crank\u201d the motives for which\nagents act.\n\n(3\u2032) Presuppose that \u201cmorality\u201d has universal\napplicability (MPS \u201csays stubbornly and inexorably, \u2018I am\nmorality itself, and nothing besides is morality\u2019\u201d [BGE\n202]).\n\n\nThus, the falsity of the picture of human beings would affect the\nintelligibility of moral judgments in the following three ways:\n\n\n(1\u2033) If agents lacked \u201cfree will\u201d they could not be\nheld responsible for their actions.\n\n(2\u2033) If agent motives could not be distinguished then no\nevaluative distinctions could be drawn among acts in terms of their\nmotives.\n\n(3\u2033) If humans were, in fact, different in some overlooked but\nrelevant respect, then it would, at least, not be prima facie\napparent that one morality should have universal application.\n\n\nIt is the burden, then, of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of the\nDescriptive Component of MPS to show that, in fact, none of these\nlatter theses about the nature of agency hold. A brief review of these\narguments follows (a more detailed treatment is in Leiter 2002: 81\u2013112\nand Leiter 2019: 115\u2013146)\n\nAgainst the Free Will Thesis, Nietzsche argues against both the modern\nattempts to vindicate free will and moral responsibility. On\nlibertarian views, a free agent (that is, one sufficiently free to be\nmorally responsible) would have to be causa sui (i.e.,\nself-caused, or the cause of itself); but since we are not causa\nsui, no one can be a free agent. Nietzsche often takes for\ngranted \u2014 not implausibly \u2014 that our moral and religious\ntraditions are incompatibilist at their core: causally determined\nwills are not free wills. But Nietzsche also argues against\ncompatibilist views of free will and moral responsibility according to\nwhich (1) we are free and morally responsible as long as we do what we\ndesire or we \u201cidentify\u201d with the desires on which we act;\nor (2) we are free and morally responsible as long as we are\nresponsive to relevant reasons for acting. (Rutherford 2011 suggests\nNietzsche has more in common with the Stoics and Spinoza when it comes\nto \u201cfree will\u201d: free actions are just ones arising from\nour real inner nature, but we can not choose to be the type of person\nwhose actions arise from their real nature, since that too is a matter\nof fate.)\n\nNietzsche offers two kinds of arguments to show that we are not\ncausa sui: that it is logically impossible to be causa\nsui; and that human beings are not self-caused in a sense\nsufficient to underwrite ascriptions of moral responsibility. (I owe\nthe point that there are two different arguments at issue here to Eric\nVogelstein.) He says relatively little about the first point, other\nthan claiming that \u201cthe concept of a causa sui is\nsomething fundamentally absurd\u201d (BGE 15), and that it is\n\u201cthe best self-contradiction that has been conceived so\nfar\u2026a sort of rape and perversion of logic\u201d (BGE 21),\nsuch that this,\n\ndesire for \u201cfreedom of the will\u201d in the superlative\nmetaphysical sense\u2026the desire to bear the entire and ultimate\nresponsibility for one\u2019s actions oneself, and to absolve God,\nthe world, ancestors, chance, and society involves nothing less than\nto be precisely this causa sui and\u2026to pull oneself up\ninto existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness. (BGE 21)\n\n\nBut we cannot, needless to say, pull ourselves up \u201cout of the\nswamps of nothingness,\u201d and so we cannot have ultimate\nresponsibility for our actions.\n\nNietzsche quickly moves from the claim that being causa sui\ninvolves a contradiction, however, to an argument that depends on his\npicture of human agency. Nietzsche accepts what we may call a\n\u201cDoctrine of Types\u201d (Leiter 1998), according to which,\n\nEach person has a fixed psycho-physical constitution, which defines\nhim as a particular type of person.\n\n\nCall the relevant psycho-physical facts here \u201ctype-facts.\u201d\nType-facts, for Nietzsche, are either physiological facts\nabout the person, or facts about the person\u2019s unconscious drives\nor affects. The claim, then, is that each person has certain largely\nimmutable physiological and psychic traits that constitute the\n\u201ctype\u201d of person he or she is.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche himself does not use this exact terminology, the\nconcept figures centrally in all his mature writings. A typical\nNietzschean form of argument, for example, runs as follows: a\nperson\u2019s theoretical beliefs are best explained in terms of his\nmoral beliefs; and his moral beliefs are best explained in terms of\nnatural facts about the type of person he is (i.e., in terms of\ntype-facts). So Nietzsche says, \u201cevery great philosophy so far\nhas been\u2026the personal confession of its author and a kind of\ninvoluntary and unconscious memoir\u201d; thus, to really grasp this\nphilosophy, one must ask \u201cat what morality does all this (does\nhe) aim\u201d (BGE 6)? But the \u201cmorality\u201d that a\nphilosopher embraces simply bears \u201cdecisive witness to who\nhe is\u201d \u2014 i.e., who he essentially is \u2014\nthat is, to the \u201cinnermost drives of his nature\u201d (BGE\n6).\n\nThis explanation of a person\u2019s moral beliefs in terms of\npsycho-physical facts about the person is a recurring theme in\nNietzsche. \u201c[M]oralities are\u2026merely a sign language of\nthe affects\u201d (BGE 187), he says. \u201cAnswers to the questions\nabout the value of existence\u2026may always be considered\nfirst of all as the symptoms of certain bodies\u201d (GS P:2).\n\u201cMoral judgments,\u201d he says are, \u201csymptoms and sign\nlanguages which betray the process of physiological prosperity or\nfailure\u201d (WP 258). \u201c[O]ur moral judgments and\nevaluations\u2026are only images and fantasies based on a\nphysiological process unknown to us\u201d (D 119), so that \u201cit\nis always necessary to draw forth\u2026the physiological\nphenomenon behind the moral predispositions and prejudices\u201d (D\n542). A \u201cmorality of sympathy,\u201d he claims is \u201cjust\nanother expression of \u2026 physiological overexcitability\u201d\n(TI IX:37). Ressentiment \u2014 and the morality that grows\nout of it \u2014 he attributes to an \u201cactual physiological\ncause [Ursache]\u201d (GM I:15).\n\nNietzsche sums up the idea well in the preface to On the Genealogy\nof Morality (hereafter simply \u201cGenealogy\u201d or\n\u201cGM\u201d): \u201cour thoughts, values, every\n\u2018yes,\u2019 \u2018no,\u2019 \u2018if\u2019 and\n\u2018but\u2019 grow from us with the same inevitability as fruits\nborne on the tree \u2014 all related and each with an affinity to\neach, and evidence of one will, one health, one earth, one sun\u201d\n(GM P:2). Nietzsche seeks to understand in naturalistic terms the\ntype of \u201cperson\u201d who would necessarily bear such\nideas and values, just as one might come to understand things about a\ntype of tree by knowing its fruits. And just as natural facts\nabout the tree explain the fruit it bears, so too type-facts about a\nperson will explain his values and actions. \n\nWe typically locate the \u201cwill,\u201d as the seat of action, in\nvarious conscious states: for example, our beliefs and desires.\nAccording to Nietzsche, however, the \u201cwill\u201d so conceived\nis nothing but the effect of type-facts about the person. This means\nthat the real story of the genesis of an action begins with the\ntype-facts, which explain both consciousness and a\nperson\u2019s actions. Here is how Nietzsche puts it, after\nsuggesting that the \u201cwill\u201d is related to, but conceptually\nprior to, the concepts of \u201cconsciousness\u201d and\n\u201cego\u201d:\n\nThe \u201cinner world\u201d is full of phantoms\u2026: the will is\none of them. The will no longer moves anything, hence does not explain\nanything either \u2014 it merely accompanies events; it can also be\nabsent. The so-called motive: another error. Merely a surface\nphenomenon of consciousness \u2014 something alongside the deed that\nis more likely to cover up the antecedents of the deeds than to\nrepresent them\u2026.\n\n\nWhat follows from this? There are no mental [geistigen]\ncauses at all. (TI VI:3)\n\n\nIn the last line, Nietzsche must mean only that there are no\nconscious mental causes. Indeed, in other passages, he is\nexplicit that the target of this critique is the picture of conscious\nmotives as adequate to account for action. (For competing views of the\nscope of Nietzsche\u2019s epiphenomenalism about consciousness, see,\non the one hand, Katsafanas 2005 and, on the other, Riccardi 2019,\nFowles 2019 and Leiter 2019: 135\u2013139; more generally, on how Nietzsche\nviews consciousness, see Abel 2001 and Welshon 2014). As he writes in\nDaybreak, \u201cwe are accustomed to exclude all [the]\nunconscious processes from the accounting and to reflect on the\npreparation for an act only to the extent that it is conscious\u201d\n(D 129), a view which Nietzsche plainly regards as mistaken, both here\nand in the passage quoted above. Indeed, the theme of the\n\u201cridiculous overestimation and misunderstanding of\nconsciousness\u201d (GS 11) is a recurring one in Nietzsche.\n\u201c[B]y far the greatest part of our spirit\u2019s\nactivity,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201cremains unconscious and\nunfelt\u201d (GS 333; cf. GS 354).\n\nApart from the general evidence on behalf of the Doctrine of Types,\nNietzsche\u2019s strongest targeted argument for the epiphenomenality\nof consciousness depends on a piece of phenomenology, namely,\n\u201cthat a thought comes when \u2018it\u2019 wishes, and not when\n\u2018I\u2019 wish\u201d (BGE 17). If that is right and if actions\nare apparently \u201ccaused\u201d by thoughts (by particular beliefs\nand desires), then it follows that actions are not caused solely by\nour conscious mental states, but rather by whatever it is (i.e.,\ntype-facts) that determines the thoughts that enter consciousness.\nThus, it is the (autonomous) causal power of our conscious mental life\nthat Nietzsche must be attacking. Given, then, that Nietzsche claims\nconsciousness is epiphenomenal, and given our identification of the\n\u201cwill\u201d with our conscious life, Nietzsche would have us\ndispense with the idea of the will as causal altogether. (This gives\nNietzsche a novel argument against hierarchical accounts of free will\nfavored by some compatibilists: see Leiter 2002: 93\u201396. It also\nundermines more recent forms of compatibilism based on\nreasons-responsiveness: if deliberation, or conscious reasoning,, is\nepiphenomenal, then why should an antecedent but non-causal\ncorrelation between antecedently consciously experienced reasons and a\nsubsequent action ground responsibility? Barometers drop before\nstorms, after all, but they do not cause them and are not blameworthy\nfor them. See Leiter 2019: 144\u2013146). Since the conscious will is not\ncausal, the Free Will Thesis is false.\n\nAgainst the Transparency of the Self Thesis, Nietzsche claims that\n\u201cevery action is unknowable\u201d (GS 335; cf. WP 291, 294); as\nhe writes in Daybreak:\n\nThe primeval delusion still lives on that one knows, and knows quite\nprecisely in every case, how human action is brought\nabout\u2026. \u201cI know what I want, what I have done, I am\nfree and responsible for it, I hold others responsible, I can call by\nits name every moral possibility and every inner motion which precedes\naction; you may act as you will \u2014 in this matter I understand\nmyself and understand you all!\u201d \u2014 that is\nhow\u2026almost everyone still thinks\u2026.[But] [a]ctions are\nnever what they appear to us to be! We have expended so much\nlabor on learning that external things are not as they appear to us to\nbe \u2014 very well! the case is the same with the inner world! Moral\nactions are in reality \u201csomething other than that\u201d \u2014\nmore we cannot say: and all actions are essentially unknown. (D 116)\n\n\nActions are unknown because \u201cnothing\u2026can be more\nincomplete than [one\u2019s] image of the totality of drives\nwhich constitute [a man\u2019s] being\u201d (D 119). One \u201ccan\nscarcely name even the cruder ones: their number and strength, their\nebb and flow, their play and counterplay among one another, and above\nall the laws of their nutriment remain wholly unknown\u201d\n(D 119). But as Nietzsche argues elsewhere (e.g., D 109), the self is\nmerely the arena in which the struggle of drives plays itself out, and\none\u2019s actions are the outcomes of the struggle (see Leiter 2002:\n99\u2013104; cf. Riccardi 2015b; for a general account of\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophical psychology of drives, see Katsafanas\n2013a).\n\nAgainst the Similarity Thesis, Nietzsche once again deploys his\nDoctrine of Types. Nietzsche holds that agents are essentially\ndissimilar, insofar as they are constituted by different\ntype-facts. Since Nietzsche also holds that these natural type-facts\nfix the different conditions under which particular agents will\nflourish, it follows that one morality cannot be good for all.\n\u201cMorality in Europe today is herd animal\nmorality,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201cin other\nwords\u2026merely one type of human morality beside which,\nbefore which, and after which many other types, above all\nhigher moralities, are, or ought to be, possible\u201d (BGE\n202). Nietzsche illustrates the general point with his discussion of\nthe case of the Italian writer Cornaro in Twilight of the\nIdols (VI:1). Cornaro, says Nietzsche, wrote a book mistakenly\nrecommending \u201chis slender diet as a recipe for a long and happy\nlife.\u201d But why was this a mistake? Nietzsche explains:\n\nThe worthy Italian thought his diet was the cause of his long\nlife, whereas the precondition for a long life, the extraordinary\nslowness of his metabolism, the consumption of so little, was the\ncause of his slender diet. He was not free to eat little or\nmuch; his frugality was not a matter of \u201cfree will\u201d: he\nbecame sick when he ate more. But whoever is not a carp not only does\nwell to eat properly, but needs to.\n\n\nThere exists, then, type-facts about Cornaro that explain why a\nslender diet is good for him: namely, \u201cthe extraordinary\nslowness of his metabolism.\u201d These natural facts, in turn,\nconstrain what Cornaro can do, delivering him \u201cfeedback\u201d\nabout the conditions under which he will and won\u2019t flourish:\ngiven his slow metabolism, if Cornaro ate more \u201che became\nsick\u201d; conversely, when he stuck to his slender diet, he did\nwell. In sum, \u201c[h]e was not free to eat little or\nmuch.\u201d Cornaro\u2019s mistake consists, in effect, in his\nabsolutism: he thought the \u201cgood\u201d diet was good for\neveryone, when in fact it was only good for certain types of bodies\n(namely, those with slow metabolisms). As with diets, so too with\nmoralities, according to Nietzsche. Agents are not similar in\ntype-facts, and so one moral \u201cdiet\u201d cannot be \u201cgood\nfor all.\u201d As he writes:\n\n[T]he question is always who he is, and who the\nother person is\u2026Every unegoistic morality that takes\nitself for unconditional and addresses itself to all does not only sin\nagainst taste: it is a provocation to sins of omission, one\nmore seduction under the mask of philanthropy \u2014 and\nprecisely a seduction and injury for the higher, rarer, privileged.\n(BGE 221)\n\n\nThis point sets the stage for his core critique of morality.\n\n1.3 Critique of the Normative Component of MPS\n\nAll of Nietzsche\u2019s criticisms of the normative component of MPS\nare parasitic upon one basic complaint \u2014 not, as some have held\n(e.g., Nehamas [1985], Geuss [1997]), the universality of moral\ndemands, per se, but rather that \u201cthe demand of one\nmorality for all is detrimental to the higher men\u201d (BGE 228).\nUniversality would be unobjectionable if agents were relevantly\nsimilar, but because agents are relevantly different, a universal\nmorality must necessarily be harmful to some. As Nietzsche writes\nelsewhere: \u201cWhen a decadent type of man ascended to the rank of\nthe highest type [via MPS], this could only happen at the expense\nof its countertype [emphasis added], the type of man that is\nstrong and sure of life\u201d (EH III:5). In the preface to the\nGenealogy, Nietzsche sums up his basic concern particularly\nwell:\n\nWhat if a symptom of regression lurked in the \u201cgood,\u201d\nlikewise a danger, a seduction, a poison, a narcotic, through which\nthe present lived at the expense of the future? Perhaps more\ncomfortably, less dangerously, but at the same time in a meaner style,\nmore basely? \u2014 So that morality itself were to blame if the\nhighest power and splendor [M\u00e4chtigkeit und\nPracht] possible to the type man was never in fact attained? So\nthat morality itself was the danger of dangers? (GM Pref:6; cf. BT\nAttempt:5)\n\n\nThis theme is sounded throughout Nietzsche\u2019s work. In a book of\n1880, for example, he writes that, \u201cOur weak, unmanly social\nconcepts of good and evil and their tremendous ascendancy over body\nand soul have finally weakened all bodies and souls and snapped the\nself-reliant, independent, unprejudiced men, the pillars of a\nstrong civilization\u201d (D 163). Similarly, in a\nposthumously published note of 1885, he remarks that \u201cmen of\ngreat creativity, the really great men according to my understanding,\nwill be sought in vain today\u201d because \u201cnothing stands more\nmalignantly in the way of their rise and evolution\u2026than what in\nEurope today is called simply \u2018morality\u2019\u201d (WP 957).\nIn these and many other passages (e.g., BGE 62; GM III:14; A:5, 24; EH\nIV:4; WP 274, 345, 400, 870, 879.), Nietzsche makes plain his\nfundamental objection to MPS: simply put, that MPS thwarts the\ndevelopment of human excellence, i.e., \u201cthe highest power and\nsplendor possible to the type man\u201d (for more on the\n\u201chigher man,\u201d see section (2)).\n\nThere is another, competing reading of Nietzsche\u2019s central\ncomplaint about MPS: namely, that it is \u201charmful to life\u201d\nor, more simply, \u201canti-nature.\u201d Geuss, for example, says\nthat, \u201cThere is little doubt that \u2018Life\u2019\u2026in\nNietzsche does seem to function as a criterion for evaluating\nmoralities\u201d (1997: 10). So, too, Schacht claims that Nietzsche\n\u201ctakes \u2018life\u2019 in this world to be the sole locus of\nvalue, and its preservation, flourishing, and above all its\nenhancement to be ultimately decisive for determinations of\nvalue\u201d (1983: 359). Thus, the question of the value of MPS is\nreally the question of its \u201cvalue for life\u201d (1983: 354).\nBut what does that mean? After all, it is obvious that Nietzsche has\nnothing but contempt for most forms of human life, from St. Paul to\nBismarck to the modern \u201cherd.\u201d So the real question has to\nbe: what does \u201clife\u201d refer to? Schacht, following a\nsuggestion of Nietzsche\u2019s from the Nachlass (WP 254),\nsuggests that life is will to power, and thus degree of power\nconstitutes the standard of value. (We shall return to this suggestion\nin detail in section 3.1, below.) But this involves no gain in\nprecision. Nietzsche may, indeed, have thought that more\n\u201cpower\u201d \u2014 in his sense \u2014 was more valuable\nthan less, but that still leaves us with the question: power of\nwhat or of whom? The only plausible candidate\n\u2014 given especially his other remarks discussed above \u2014 is\npower of people; just as the only plausible candidate for the\n\u201clife\u201d that Nietzsche considers it valuable to preserve\nand enhance must be the lives of people and, in particular,\nthe lives of the \u201chighest men.\u201d\n\nThat this is what Nietzsche means is revealed by the context of his\nactual remarks about the \u201cvalue for life.\u201d For example, he\ncomments that \u201ca higher and more fundamental value for\nlife might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and\nlust\u201d (BGE 2, emphasis added). But what sort of\n\u201clife\u201d is, e.g., \u201cselfishness\u201d valuable for?\nAs Nietzsche writes elsewhere (e.g., GM Pref:5\u20136), it is simply\nthat life which manifests \u201cthe highest power and splendor\nactually possible to the type man.\u201d And similarly, when\nNietzsche says that a \u201ctendency hostile to life is therefore\ncharacteristic of morality,\u201d it is clear in context that what\n\u201clife\u201d refers to is \u201cthe type man\u201d who might\nbe \u201craised to his greatest splendor and power\u201d (that is,\nbut for the interference of MPS) (WP 897). In short, then, the things\nNietzsche identifies as \u201cvaluable\u201d for life are those he\ntakes to be necessary for the flourishing of the highest types of life\n(or human excellence), while those that he identifies as harmful to it\nare those that he takes to be things that constitute obstacles to such\nflourishing. This suggests, then, that the \u201clife\u201d for\nwhich things are either valuable or disvaluable must be the life (or\nlives) that manifest human excellence \u2014 i.e., the lives of\n\u201chigher men.\u201d\n\nSomething similar may be said for the claim that Nietzsche objects to\nMPS because it is \u201canti-nature.\u201d For example, when\nNietzsche says in Ecce Homo (IV:7) that \u201cit is the lack\nof nature, it is the utterly gruesome fact that antinature\nitself received the highest honors as morality\u201d that he\ncentrally objects to in a morality, his claim will remain obscure\nunless we can say precisely what about MPS makes it\n\u201canti-natural.\u201d Nietzsche, himself, offers guidance on\nthis in the same section when he explains that a MPS is anti-natural\ninsofar as it has the following sorts of characteristics: it teaches\nmen \u201cto despise the very first instincts of life\u201d and\n\u201cto experience the presupposition of life, sexuality, as\nsomething unclean\u201d; and it \u201clooks for the evil principle\nin what is most profoundly necessary for growth, in severe\nself-love\u201d (EH IV:7).\n\nBut from this it should be apparent, then, that it is not\nanti-naturalness itself that is objectionable, but the consequences of\nan anti-natural MPS that are at issue: for example, its opposition to\nthe instincts that are \u201cprofoundly necessary for growth.\u201d\nThis point is even more explicit in The Antichrist, where\nNietzsche notes that Christian morality \u201chas waged deadly war\nagainst this higher type of man; it has placed all the basic\ninstincts of his type under ban\u201d (5, emphasis added). In\nother words, the anti-naturalness of MPS is objectionable because the\n\u201cnatural\u201d instincts MPS opposes are precisely those\nnecessary for the growth of the \u201chigher type of man.\u201d\nThus, underlying Nietzsche\u2019s worries about the anti-naturalness\nof MPS \u2014 just as underlying his worries about the threat MPS\nposes to life \u2014 is a concern for the effect of MPS on\n\u201chigher men.\u201d\n\nSo Nietzsche objects to the normative agenda of MPS because it is\nharmful to the highest men. In Nietzsche\u2019s various accounts of\nwhat the objectionable agenda of MPS consists, he identifies a variety\nof normative positions (see, e.g., D 108, 132, 174; GS 116, 294, 328,\n338, 345, 352, 377; Z I:4, II:8, III:1, 9, IV:13, 10; BGE 197, 198,\n201\u2013202, 225, 257; GM Pref:5, III: 11 ff.; TI II, V, IX:35,\n37\u201338, 48; A: 7, 43; EH III:D-2, IV:4, 7\u20138; WP 752). We may\ncharacterize these simply as \u201cpro\u201d and \u201ccon\u201d\nattitudes, and we may say that a morality is the object of\nNietzsche\u2019s critique (i.e., it is an MPS) if it contains one or\nmore of the following normative views (this is a representative, but\nnot exhaustive, list):\n\n\nPro\nCon \n\nHappiness\nSuffering \n\nAltruism/Selflessness\nSelf-love or self-interest \n\nEquality\nInequality \n\nPity/Compassion\nIndifference to the suffering \n\n\nThe various possible normative components of MPS should, of course, be\nunderstood construed as ideal-typical, singling out for\nemphasis and criticism certain important features of larger and more\ncomplex normative views. Let us call that which morality has a\n\u201cpro\u201d attitude towards is the \u201cPro-Object,\u201d\nand that which morality has a \u201ccon\u201d attitude towards the\n\u201cCon-Object.\u201d Keeping in mind that what seems to have\nintrinsic value for Nietzsche is human excellence or human\ngreatness (see the next section), Nietzsche\u2019s attack on the\nnormative component of MPS can be summarized as having two parts:\n\n(a) With respect to the Pro-Object, Nietzsche argues either (i) that\nthe Pro-Object has no intrinsic value (in the cases where MPS\nclaims it does); or (ii) that it does not have any or not nearly as\nmuch extrinsic value as MPS treats it as having; and\n\n\n(b) With respect to the Con-Object, Nietzsche argues only\nthat the Con-Objects are extrinsically valuable for the\ncultivation of human excellence \u2014 and that this is obscured by\nthe \u201ccon\u201d attitude endorsed by MPS.\n\n\nThus, what unifies Nietzsche\u2019s seemingly disparate critical\nremarks \u2014 about altruism, happiness, pity, equality, Kantian\nrespect for persons, utilitarianism, etc. \u2014 is that he thinks a\nculture in which such norms prevail as morality will be a culture\nwhich eliminates the conditions for the realization of human\nexcellence \u2014 the latter requiring, on Nietzsche\u2019s view,\nconcern with the self, suffering, a certain stoic indifference, a\nsense of hierarchy and difference, and the like. Indeed, when we turn\nto the details of Nietzsche\u2019s criticisms of these norms we find\nthat, in fact, this is precisely what he argues. One detailed example\nwill have to suffice here.\n\nWhat could be harmful about the seemingly innocuous MPS valuation of\nhappiness (\u201cpro\u201d) and suffering (\u201ccon\u201d)? An\nearly remark of Nietzsche\u2019s suggests his answer:\n\nAre we not, with this tremendous objective of obliterating all the\nsharp edges of life, well on the way to turning mankind into\nsand? Sand! Small, soft, round, unending sand! Is that your\nideal, you heralds of the sympathetic affections? (D 174)\n\n\nIn a later work, Nietzsche says \u2014 referring to hedonists and\nutilitarians \u2014 that, \u201cWell-being as you understand it\n\u2014 that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state\nthat soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible\u2026\u201d (BGE\n225). By the hedonistic doctrine of well-being, Nietzsche takes the\nutilitarians to have in mind \u201cEnglish happiness,\u201d\nnamely, \u201ccomfort and fashion\u201d (BGE 228) \u2014 a\nconstrual which, if unfair to some utilitarians (like Mill), may do\njustice to our ordinary aspirations to happiness. In a similar vein,\nNietzsche has Zarathustra dismiss \u201cwretched contentment\u201d\nas an ideal (Z Pref:3), while also revealing that it was precisely\n\u201cthe last men\u201d \u2014 the \u201cmost despicable\nmen\u201d \u2014 who \u201cinvented happiness\n[Gl\u00fcck]\u201d in the first place (Pref:5).\n\nSo happiness, according to Nietzsche, is not an intrinsically valuable\nend, and men who aim for it \u2014 directly or through cultivating\nthe dispositions that lead to it \u2014 would be \u201cridiculous\nand contemptible.\u201d To be sure, Nietzsche allows that he himself\nand the \u201cfree spirits\u201d will be \u201ccheerful\u201d or\n\u201cgay\u201d [fr\u00f6lich] \u2014 they are, after all,\nthe proponents of the \u201cgay science.\u201d But the point is that\nsuch \u201chappiness\u201d is not criterial of being a\nhigher person, and thus it is not something that the higher person\n\u2014 in contrast to the adherent of MPS \u2014 aims for.\n\nYet why does aiming for happiness make a person so unworthy of\nadmiration? Nietzsche\u2019s answer appears to be this: because\nsuffering is positively necessary for the cultivation of\nhuman excellence \u2014 which is the only thing, recall, that\nwarrants admiration for Nietzsche. He writes, for example, that:\n\nThe discipline of suffering, of great suffering \u2014 do\nyou not know that only this discipline has created all\nenhancements of man so far? That tension of the soul in unhappiness\nwhich cultivates its strength, its shudders face to face with great\nruin, its inventiveness and courage in enduring, persevering,\ninterpreting, and exploiting suffering, and whatever has been granted\nto it of profundity, secret, mask, spirit, cunning, greatness \u2014\nwas it not granted to it through suffering, through the discipline of\ngreat suffering? (BGE 225; cf. BGE 270)\n\n\nNietzsche is not arguing here that \u2014 in contrast to the view of\nMPS \u2014 suffering is really intrinsically valuable (not\neven MPS claims that). The value of suffering, according to Nietzsche,\nis only extrinsic: suffering \u2014 \u201cgreat\u201d suffering\n\u2014 is a prerequisite of any great human achievement. As Nietzsche\nputs the point elsewhere: \u201cOnly great pain is the ultimate\nliberator of the spirit\u2026.I doubt that such pain makes us\n\u2018better\u2019; but I know that it makes us more profound\u201d\n(GS Pref:3). Nietzsche\u2019s attack, then, conforms to the model\nsketched above: (i) he rejects the view that happiness is\nintrinsically valuable; and (ii) he thinks that the negative\nattitude of MPS toward suffering obscures its important extrinsic\nvalue. (There is reason to think that, on this second point, Nietzsche\nis generalizing from his own experience with physical suffering, the\nworst periods of which coincided with his greatest productivity.\nIndeed, he believed that his suffering contributed essentially to his\nwork: as he writes, admittedly hyperbolically, in Ecce Homo:\n\u201cIn the midst of the torments that go with an uninterrupted\nthree-day migraine, accompanied by laborious vomiting of phlegm, I\npossessed a dialectician\u2019s clarity par excellence and\nthought through with very cold blood matters for which under healthier\ncircumstances I am not mountain-climber, not subtle, not cold\nenough\u201d (EH I:1).)\n\nEven if there is no shortage in the history of art and literature of\ncases of immense suffering being the spur to great creativity, there\nremains a serious worry about the logic of this line of Nietzschean\ncritique. Following Leiter (2002), we may call this the \u201cHarm\nPuzzle,\u201d and the puzzle is this: why should one think the\ngeneral moral prescription to alleviate suffering must stop the\nsuffering of great artists, hence stop them from producing great art?\nOne might think, in fact, that MPS could perfectly well allow an\nexception for those individuals whose own suffering is essential to\nthe realization of central life projects. After all, a prescription to\nalleviate suffering reflects a concern with promoting well-being,\nunder some construal. But if some individuals \u2014 nascent Goethes,\nNietzsches, and other geniuses \u2014 would be better off\nwith a good dose of suffering, then why would MPS recommend otherwise?\nWhy, then, should it be the case that MPS \u201charms\u201d\npotentially \u201chigher men\u201d?\n\nThis seems the natural philosophical question to ask, yet it also\ninvolves an important misunderstanding of Nietzsche\u2019s critique,\nwhich is not, we might say, about philosophical theory but\nrather about the real nature of culture. When MPS values come\nto dominate a culture, Nietzsche thinks (plausibly), they will affect\nthe attitudes of all members of that culture. If MPS values emphasize\nthe badness of suffering and the goodness of happiness, that will\ninfluence how individuals with the potential for great achievements\nunderstand, evaluate and conduct their own lives. If, in fact,\nsuffering is a precondition for these individuals to do anything\ngreat, and if they have internalized the norm that suffering must be\nalleviated, and that happiness is the ultimate goal, then we run the\nrisk that, rather than \u2014 to put it crudely \u2014 suffer and\ncreate, they will instead waste their energies pursuing pleasure,\nlamenting their suffering and seeking to alleviate it. MPS values may\nnot explicitly prohibit artists or other potentially\n\u201cexcellent\u201d persons from ever suffering; but the risk is\nthat a culture \u2014 like ours \u2014 which has internalized the\nnorms against suffering and for pleasure will be a\nculture in which potential artists \u2014 and other doers of great\nthings \u2014 will, in fact, squander themselves in\nself-pity and the seeking of pleasure.\n\nSo Nietzsche\u2019s response to the Harm Puzzle depends upon an\nempirical claim about what the real effect of MPS will be.\nThe normative component of MPS is harmful not because its specific\nprescriptions and proscriptions explicitly require potentially\nexcellent persons to forego that which allows them to flourish (the\nclaim is not that a conscientious application of the\n\u201ctheory\u201d of MPS is incompatible with the flourishing of\nhigher men); rather, the normative component of MPS is harmful because\nin practice, and especially because of MPS\u2019s commitment\nto the idea that one morality is appropriate for all, potentially\nhigher men will come to adopt such values as applicable to themselves\nas well. Thus, the normative component of MPS is harmful because, in\nreality, it will have the effect of leading potentially excellent\npersons to value what is in fact not conducive to their flourishing\nand devalue what is in fact essential to it.\n\nIn sum, Nietzsche\u2019s central objection to MPS is that it thwarts\nthe development of human excellence. His argument for this, in each\ncase, turns on identifying distinctive valuations of MPS, and showing\nhow \u2014 as in the case of norms favoring happiness and devaluing\nsuffering \u2014 they undermine the development of individuals who\nwould manifest human excellence. (For discussion of other examples,\nsee Leiter 2002: 134\u2013136; Leiter 2015: 108\u2013110.)\n2. Nietzsche\u2019s Positive Ethical Vision\n\nWhile Nietzsche clearly has views about the states of affairs to which\npositive intrinsic value attaches (namely, the flourishing of\nhigher men), there is more disagreement among interpreters about what\nkind of ethics arises from the latter valuation so central to his\ncritique of morality. The two leading candidates are that Nietzsche\nembraces a kind of virtue ethics (e.g., Hunt 1991, Swanton\n2005) and that he is a kind of perfectionist (Hurka 1993, Hurka 2007).\nThese accounts turn out to overlap \u2014 the perfections of\nthe latter account are often the virtues of the former\n\u2014 though the perfectionist account will prove to have certain\nother advantages, discussed below.\n\nAny account of Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cpositive ethics\u201d\nconfronts a threshold worry, namely, that Nietzsche\u2019s\nnaturalistic conception of persons and agency \u2014 and, in\nparticular, his conception of persons as constituted by non-conscious\ntype-facts that determine their actions \u2014 makes it unclear how\nNietzsche could have a philosophical ethics in any conventional sense.\nIf, as Nietzsche, says, we face \u201ca brazen wall of fate; we\nare in prison, we can only dream ourselves free, not\nmake ourselves free\u201d (HAH II:33); if \u201cthe single human\nbeing is a piece of fatum from the front and from the rear,\none law more, one necessity more for all that is yet to come and to\nbe\u201d (TI V:6); if (as he says more hyperbolically in\nNachlass material) \u201cthe voluntary is absolutely\nlacking\u2026everything has been directed along certain lines from\nthe beginning\u201d (WP 458); if (again hyperbolically) \u201cone\nwill become only that which one is (in spite of all: that means\neducation, instruction, milieu, chance, and accident)\u201d (WP 334);\nthen it is hardly surprising that Nietzsche should also say, \u201cA\nman as he ought to be: that sounds to us as insipid as\n\u2018a tree as he ought to be\u2019\u201d (WP 332).\n\nYet a philosopher reluctant to talk about \u201cman as he\nought to be\u201d is plainly ill-suited to the task of\ndeveloping a normative ethics, understood as systematic and\ntheoretical guidance for how to live, whether that guidance comes in\nthe form of rules for behavior or dispositions of character to be\ncultivated. (There is an additional, and special difficulty, for those\nwho think Nietzsche is a virtue ethicist, namely, that he also thinks\ngenuine virtues are specific to individuals, meaning that there will\nbe nothing general for the theorist to say about them [see,\ne.g., Z I:5].) This means we must approach the question of\nNietzsche\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d ethics in terms of\nexplicating (1) what it is Nietzsche values, (2) what his criteria of\nevaluation are, and (3) what evaluative structure, if any, is\nexhibited by the answers to (1) and (2). We go wrong at the start,\nhowever, if we expect Nietzsche to produce a normative theory of any\nfamiliar kind, whether a virtue ethics or otherwise.\n\nImportantly, the preceding points should not be read as denying that\nNietzsche thinks values and evaluative judgments can have a\ncausal impact on actions and how lives are lived. After all,\nthere would be no point in undertaking a \u201crevaluation of\nvalues\u201d if such a revaluation would not have consequences for,\ne.g., the flourishing of higher men, or if MPS values did not have\ndeleterious causal consequences for those same people. Values make a\ncausal difference, but, given Nietzsche\u2019s epiphenomenalism about\nconsciousness (discussed, above, in 1.1), they do not make this\ndifference because of free, conscious choices individuals make to\nadopt certain moral rules or cultivate certain dispositions of\ncharacter.\n\nWe can better appreciate Nietzsche\u2019s unusual views on this score\nby looking more closely at the popular, but mistaken, idea that\nNietzsche calls on people to \u201ccreate themselves\u201d (on the\ngeneral topic, see Leiter 1998). Alexander Nehamas, for example, reads\nNietzsche as endorsing an ethics of self-creation. For Nietzsche,\nNehamas says, \u201cThe people who \u2018want to become those they\nare\u2019 are precisely \u2018human beings who are new, unique,\nincomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves\u2019\n(GS, 335)\u201d (1985, p. 174). Nehamas, however, truncates the quote\nfrom The Gay Science at a misleading point. For Nietzsche, in\nthe full passage, continues as follows:\n\nTo that end [of creating ourselves] we must become the best learners\nand discoverers of everything that is lawful and necessary in the\nworld: we must become physicists in order to be\ncreators in this sense [wir m\u00fcssen Physiker sein,\num, in jenem Sinne, Sch\u00f6pfer sein zu k\u00f6nnen]\n\u2014 while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on\nignorance of physics \u2026 . Therefore: long live physics!\n(GS 335)\n\n\nCreation \u201cin this sense\u201d is, then, a very special sense\nindeed: for it presupposes the discovery of what is \u201clawful and\nnecessary\u201d as revealed by physical science. The passage begins\nto make more sense in context. For in this same section, Nietzsche\nclaims that \u201cevery action is unknowable,\u201d though he\nadds:\n\n\u2026our opinions, valuations, and tables of what is good certainly\nbelong among the most powerful levers in the involved mechanism of our\nactions, but\u2026in any particular case the law of their mechanism\nis indemonstrable [unnachweisbar].\n\n\nThis observation leads Nietzsche immediately to the suggestion that we\nshould create \u201cour own new tables of what is good,\u201d\npresumably with an eye to effecting the causal determination of our\nactions in new ways. However, we need help from science to identify\nthe lawful patterns into which values and actions fall; even if the\nmechanisms are indemonstrable, science may at least reveal the\npatterns of value-inputs and action-outputs. So to create one\u2019s\nself, \u201cin this sense,\u201d is to accept Nietzsche\u2019s\nbasically deterministic picture of action \u2014 as determined by\nsub-conscious causes (type-facts) that are hard to identify \u2014\nbut to use science to help identify those \u201cvalues\u201d which\nfigure in the causal determination of action in new, but predictable,\nways.\n\nValues, then, have a causal impact upon how people act and thus also\non their life trajectories; but we cannot expect these impacts to flow\nfrom free, conscious choices that persons make. This would explain, of\ncourse, why we find so little in Nietzsche by way of argumentative or\ndiscursive support for his evaluative judgments: such intellectual\ndevices are precisely the ones that would appeal to our conscious\nfaculties, and thus would be idle with respect to the desired\noutcomes. Nietzsche\u2019s often violent rhetorical style, by\ncontrast, might be expected (or so Nietzsche presumably thinks) to\nhave the requisite non-rational effect on his desired readers \u2014\nthose \u201cwhose ears are related to ours\u201d (GS 381). (More on\nthis issue in Section 4, below.)\n\nIf Nietzsche does not have a typical normative ethics, he certainly\nhas no shortage of views about evaluative questions. For example, it\nis clear from the earlier discussion of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of\nmorality that he assigns great intrinsic value to the flourishing of\nhigher men. But who are these \u201chigher men\u201d and why does\nNietzsche assign value to them? (Note that while Nietzsche speaks in\nThus Spoke Zarathustra of the \u201csuperman\u201d as a\nkind of ideal higher type, this concept simply drops out of his mature\nwork (except for a brief mention in EH in the context of discussing\nZarathustra). \u201cHigher men\u201d is an important\nconcept in Nietzsche; the \u201csuperman\u201d is nothing more than\na rhetorical trope in the highly stylized Zarathustra.)\n\nNietzsche has three favorite examples of \u201chigher\u201d human\nbeings: Goethe, Beethoven, and Nietzsche himself! What makes these\nfigures paradigms of the \u201chigher\u201d type for Nietzsche,\nbeyond their great creativity (as he says, \u201cthe men of great\ncreativity\u201d are \u201cthe really great men according to my\nunderstanding\u201d (WP 957))? Following Leiter (2002: 116\u2013122;\nLeiter 2015: 92\u2013100), we can identify five characteristics that\nNietzsche identifies as distinctive of \u201chigher men\u201d: the\nhigher type is solitary, pursues a \u201cunifying project,\u201d is\nhealthy, is life-affirming, and practices self-reverence. Taken\ntogether, they are plainly sufficient to make someone a higher type in\nNietzsche\u2019s view, though it is not obvious that any one of these\nis necessary, and various combinations often seem sufficient for\nexplaining how Nietzsche speaks of higher human beings.\n\nFirst, higher types are solitary and deal with others only\ninstrumentally. \u201cEvery choice human being,\u201d says\nNietzsche, \u201cstrives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy\nwhere he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great\nmajority\u2026\u201d (BGE 26). \u201c[T]he concept of\ngreatness,\u201d he says in the same work, \u201centails being\nnoble, wanting to be by oneself, being able to be different, standing\nalone and having to live independently\n[auf-eigne-Faust-leben-m\u00fcssen]\u201d (BGE 212). Indeed,\nthe higher type pursues solitude with something of a vengeance, for he\n\u201cknows how to make enemies everywhere,\u2026[He] constantly\ncontradicts the great majority not through words but through\ndeeds\u201d (WP 944). Unsurprisingly, then, the great or higher man\nlacks the \u201ccongeniality\u201d and\n\u201cgood-naturedness\u201d so often celebrated in contemporary\npopular culture. \u201cA great man\u2026is incommunicable: he finds\nit tasteless to be familiar\u2026\u201d (WP 962). More than that,\nthough, the higher type deals with others, when he has to, in a rather\ndistinctive way: \u201cA human being who strives for something great\nconsiders everyone he meets on his way either as a means or as a delay\nand obstacle \u2014 or as a temporary resting place\u201d (BGE 273).\nThus, \u201ca great man\u2026wants no \u2018sympathetic\u2019\nheart, but servants, tools; in his intercourse with men, he is always\nintent on making something out of them\u201d (WP 962). The\ngreat man approaches others instrumentally not only because of his\nfundamental proclivity for solitude, but because of another\ndistinguishing characteristic: he is consumed by his work, his\nresponsibilities, his projects.\n\nSecond, higher types seek burdens and responsibilities, in the pursuit\nof some unifying project. \u201cWhat is noble?\u201d\nNietzsche again asks in a Nachlass note of 1888. His answer:\n\u201cThat one instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities\u201d (WP\n944). So it was with Goethe: \u201che was not fainthearted but took\nas much as possible upon himself, over himself, into himself\u201d\n(TI IX:49). But the higher type does not seek out responsibilities and\ntasks arbitrarily. \u201cA great man,\u201d says Nietzsche displays\n\u201ca long logic in all of his activity\u2026he has the ability\nto extend his will across great stretches of his life and to despise,\nand reject everything petty about him\u201d (WP 962). This is the\ntrait Nietzsche sometimes refers to as having \u201cstyle\u201d in\n\u201ccharacter\u201d (GS 290). (Note that this famous passage (GS\n290) merely describes those \u2014 \u201cthe strong and\ndomineering natures\u201d \u2014 who are able \u201c\u2018to\ngive\u2019 style\u201d to their character; it does not presuppose\nthat just anyone can do so and it is not a recommendation that\neveryone try to do so.) Indeed, Nietzsche understood his own life in\nthese terms:\n\n[T]he organizing \u201cidea\u201d that is destined to rule [in\none\u2019s life and work] keeps growing deep down \u2014 it begins\nto command; slowly it leads us back from side roads and wrong\nroads; it prepares single qualities and fitnesses that will\none day prove to be indispensable as means toward a whole \u2014 one\nby one, it trains all subservient capacities before giving\nany hint of the dominant task, \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201caim,\u201d\nor \u201cmeaning.\u201d\n\n\nConsidered in this way, my life is simply wonderful. For the task of a\nrevaluation of all values more capacities may have been\nneeded than have ever dwelt together in a single individual\u2026.I\nnever even suspected what was growing in me \u2014 and one day all my\ncapacities, suddenly ripe, leaped forth in their ultimate\nperfection. (EH II:9). \n\n\nEarlier in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche describes himself as a higher\ntype, \u201ca well-turned-out-person\u201d (EH I:2), and thus we may\nconclude that it is a characteristic only of the higher type\nthat he is driven in pursuit of a project in the way described here.\nIndeed, it turns out to be precisely this kind of instinctive\ndrivenness that Nietzsche has partly in mind when he praises\n\u201chealth.\u201d\n\nThird, higher types are essentially healthy and resilient. One\nessential attribute of the \u201cwell-turned-out-person\u201d is\nthat he \u201chas a taste only for what is good for him; his\npleasure, his delight cease where the measure of what is good for him\nis transgressed. He guesses what remedies avail against what is\nharmful; he exploits bad accidents to his advantage\u201d (EH I:2).\nBut this is just to say that a higher type is healthy, for\nhealth, Nietzsche tells us, means simply \u201cinstinctively\ncho[osing] the right means against wretched states\u201d (EH\nI:2). This permits us to understand Nietzsche\u2019s own declaration\nin Ecce Homo that he was \u201chealthy at\nbottom\u201d (EH I:2), a seemingly paradoxical claim for a\nphilosopher whose physical ailments were legion. Yet\n\u201chealth,\u201d for Nietzsche, is a term of art, meaning not the\nabsence of sickness, but something closer to resilience, to\nhow one deals with ordinary (physical) sickness and setbacks.\n\u201cFor a typical healthy person,\u201d Nietzsche says,\n\u201cbeing sick can even become an energetic stimulus for\nlife, for living more. This, in fact, is how [my own] long period of\nsickness appears to me now\u2026it was during the years of\nmy lowest vitality that I ceased to be a pessimist; the\ninstinct of self-restoration forbade me a philosophy of\npoverty and discouragement\u201d (EH I:2). To cease to be a pessimist\nis to reject MPS, for only under the color of MPS does life appear to\nlack value. Thus, being healthy, in turn, entails a distinctive\nnon-pessimistic attitude towards life \u2014 which is yet a fourth\nmark of the higher type.\n\nFourth, higher types affirm life, meaning that they are prepared to\nwill the eternal return of their lives. In Beyond Good\nand Evil, Nietzsche describes \u201cthe opposite ideal\u201d to\nthat of moralists and pessimists like Schopenhauer as \u201cthe ideal\nof the most high-spirited, alive, and world-affirming human being who\nhas not only come to terms and learned to get along with whatever was\nand is, but who wants to have what was and is repeated into\nall eternity\u201d (BGE 56). Put more simply: the higher type\nembraces the doctrine of the eternal recurrence and thus evinces what\nNietzsche often calls a \u201cDionysian\u201d or\n\u201clife-affirming\u201d attitude. A person, for Nietzsche, has a\nDionysian attitude toward life insofar as he affirms his life\nunconditionally; in particular, insofar as he affirms it including the\n\u201csuffering\u201d or other hardships it has involved. So someone\nwho says, \u201cI would gladly live my life again, except for my\nfirst marriage,\u201d would not affirm life in the requisite sense.\nThus, we may say that a person affirms his life in Nietzsche\u2019s\nsense only insofar as he would gladly will its eternal return: i.e.,\nwill the repetition of his entire life through eternity. In fact,\nNietzsche calls \u201cthe idea of the eternal recurrence\u201d the\n\u201chighest formulation of affirmation that is at all\nattainable\u201d (EH III:Z-1; cf. BGE 56). Higher men, then, are\nmarked by a distinctive Dionysian attitude toward their life: they\nwould gladly will the repetition of their life eternally.\n\nStrikingly, Nietzsche claims that precisely this attitude\ncharacterized both himself and Goethe. Speaking, for example, of the\nneglect by his contemporaries of his work, Nietzsche writes: \u201cI\nmyself have never suffered from all this; what is necessary\ndoes not hurt me; amor fati [love of fate] is my inmost\nnature\u201d (EH III:CW-4). Regarding Goethe, Nietzsche says that,\n\u201cSuch a spirit\u2026stands amid the cosmos with a joyous and\ntrusting fatalism, in the faith\u2026that all is redeemed\nand affirmed in the whole\u2026.Such a faith, however, is the\nhighest of all possible faiths: I have baptized it with the name of\nDionysus\u201d (TI IX:49).\n\nFinally, the higher type of human being has a distinctive bearing\ntowards others and especially towards himself: he has self-reverence.\n\u201cThe \u2018higher nature\u2019 of the great man,\u201d says\nNietzsche in a striking Nachlass note of 1888 \u201clies in\nbeing different, in incommunicability, in distance of rank, not in an\neffect of any kind \u2014 even if he made the whole globe\ntremble\u201d (WP 876; cf. GS 55). This is perhaps the most unusual\nfeature of Nietzsche\u2019s discussion of the higher type, for it\nsuggests that, at bottom, being a higher type is a matter of\n\u201cattitude\u201d or \u201cbearing.\u201d In a section of\nBeyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche once again answers the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is noble?\u201d, this time as follows:\n\u201cIt is not the works, it is the faith that is decisive\nhere, that determines the order of rank\u2026: some fundamental\ncertainty that a noble soul has about itself, something that cannot be\nsought, nor found, nor perhaps lost. The noble soul has reverence\n[Ehrfurcht] for itself\u201d (BGE 287). Self-reverence \u2014\nto revere and respect oneself as one might a god \u2014 is no small\nachievement, as the proliferation of \u201cself-help\u201d programs\nand pop psychology slogans like \u201cI\u2019m OK, you\u2019re\nOK\u201d would suggest. Self-loathing, self-doubt, and\nself-laceration are the norm among human beings; to possess a\n\u201cfundamental certainty\u201d about oneself is, Nietzsche thinks\nquite plausibly, a unique state of affairs.\n\nAllied with this posture of self-reverence are other distinctive\nattitudes that distinguish the bearing of the higher man. \u201cThe\nnoble human being,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201chonors himself as one\nwho is powerful, also as one who has power over himself, who knows how\nto speak and be silent, who delights in being severe and hard with\nhimself and respects all severity and hardness\u201d (BGE 260). (The\nhigher man, unsurprisingly, is no hedonist: \u201cWhat is\nnoble?\u201d asks Nietzsche: \u201cThat one leaves happiness to the\ngreat majority: happiness as peace of soul, virtue, comfort,\nAnglo-angelic shopkeeperdom a la Spencer\u201d (WP 944).) In an\nearlier work, Nietzsche explains that:\n\n[T]he passion that attacks those who are noble is peculiar\u2026.It\ninvolves the use of a rare and singular standard cold to everybody\nelse; the discovery of values for which no scales have been invented\nyet; offering sacrifices on altars that are dedicated to an unknown\ngod; a courage without any desire for honors; self-sufficiency that\noverflows and gives to men and things. (GS 55)\n\n\nIndeed, the ability to set his own standard of valuation is one of the\nmost distinctive achievements of the higher type, as we saw already in\nthe discussion of solitude. And \u201cthe highest man\u201d\nsays Nietzsche is \u201che who determines values and directs\nthe will of millennia by giving direction to the highest\nnatures\u201d (WP 999).\n\nConsidered all together, it becomes clear why creatives geniuses like\nGoethe, Beethoven, and Nietzsche himself should be the preferred\nexamples of the higher human being: for the characteristics of the\nhigher type so-described are precisely those that lend themselves to\nartistic and creative work. A penchant for solitude,\nan absolute devotion to one\u2019s tasks, an indifference to external\nopinion, a fundamental certainty about oneself and one\u2019s values\n(that often strikes others as hubris) \u2014 all these are the traits\nwe find, again and again, in artistic geniuses. (It turns out, for\nexample, that Beethoven, according to his leading biographer, had\nalmost all these characteristics to a striking degree; for discussion,\nsee Leiter 2002: 122\u2013123.)\n\nIf \u201cthe men of great creativity, the really great men according\nto my understanding\u201d (WP 957), men like Goethe and Beethoven,\nare Nietzsche\u2019s paradigmatic higher types, whose lives are\nmodels of flourishing excellence, is there anything systematic to be\nsaid about the theory of value that undergirds these judgments and\ninforms, in turn, Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality (MPS) on the\ngrounds that it thwarts the development of such men?\n\nOne popular idea (e.g., Schacht 1983, Richardson 1996) is that higher\nmen exemplify \u201cpower,\u201d which is claimed to be\nNietzsche\u2019s fundamental criterion of value. Such readings, alas,\nhave to employ the concept of \u201cpower\u201d rather elastically,\nsince the conglomeration of traits of higher human beings noted above\ndon\u2019t seem to be, in any ordinary sense, instances of\n\u201cpower\u201d or its manifestation. (Treating Nietzsche\u2019s\nfundamental criterion of value as \u201cpower\u201d confronts even\nmore serious textual and philosophical obstacles: see Section 3.1,\nbelow.)\n\nMore illuminating is Hurka\u2019s view (1993 and Hurka 2007) that\nNietzsche\u2019s evaluative posture conjoins perfectionism with\nmaximizing consequentialism: what has value are certain human\nexcellences (or perfections), and states of affairs are assessed in\nterms of their maximization of these excellences. As Hurka helpfully\nobserves (1993: 75), Nietzsche seems to operate with the opposite of\nRawls\u2019s maximin principle, what Hurka calls appropriately\n\u201cmaximax.\u201d Hurka states this as a rule for conduct\n(\u201ceach agent\u2019s overriding goal should be not a sum or\naverage of lifetime value, but the greatest lifetime value of the\nsingle most perfect individual, or, if perfections are not fully\ncomparable, of the few most perfect individuals\u201d [1993: 75]),\nbut given the earlier caveats about reading Nietzsche as a\nconventional normative theorist, it is better to treat maximax as\nreflecting the implicit structure of Nietzsche\u2019s revaluation of\nvalues: he rejects MPS because it fails to maximize the perfection of\nthe highest human beings, and he does so without, it appears, any\nregard for the costs to the herd of such a rejection (see Section\n4).\n\nThis leaves the question whether there are (formal or substantive)\ncriteria of \u201cperfection\u201d for Nietzsche? Many writers\n(e.g., Hurka 2007; Nehamas 1985; Richardson 1996) are attracted to the\nidea that \u201cstyle\u201d or \u201cunity\u201d is a criterion of\nexcellence or perfection for Nietzsche, and, indeed, as noted above,\nthe pursuit of a unified or coherent life project is a characteristic\nfeature of those Nietzsche deems to be higher men. Whether such style\nor coherence suffices is a vexed interpretive question, since it is\nnot entirely clear that the formal criterion of style or unity is\navailable only to Goethes and Beethovens: did not Kant, that\n\u201ccatastrophic spider\u201d as Nietzsche unflatteringly calls\nhim (A 11), exhibit an extraordinarily coherent style of creative\nproductivity over many years?\n\nOthers (e.g., Magnus 1978) take Nietzsche\u2019s idea of eternal\nrecurrence (the hallmark of life-affirmation, as noted above) as the\ncriterion of a well-lived life: perfection is a matter of living in\nsuch a way that one is ready to gladly will the repetition of\none\u2019s life, in all its particulars, in to eternity. This, too,\nseems both too thin and too severe as a criterion of perfection\nstanding alone: too thin, because anyone suitably superficial and\ncomplacent might will the eternal return; too severe, because it seems\nto require that a post-Holocaust Goethe gladly will the repetition of\nthe Holocaust.\n\nNehamas (1985), who shares some of Magnus\u2019s view, adds a\nsurprising twist to this account: he claims that Nietzsche does not\ndescribe his ideal person \u2014 his \u201chigher\nman\u201d \u2014 but rather \u201cexemplifies\u201d such a person\nin the form of the \u201ccharacter\u201d that is constituted by and\nexemplified in his corpus. Nietzsche, however, describes at\ngreat length and in many places (e.g. D 201; GS 55; BGE 287; NCW\nEpilogue:2; WP 943) the types of persons he admires; and he also\ndescribes himself as such a person (e.g., EH I:2) In any\ncase, Nehamas\u2019s view would have the odd consequence that for\nNietzsche to have had a positive ethical vision at any point earlier\nin his career he would have had to anticipate writing the series of\nbooks he actually wrote, such that his ethical ideal would be properly\nexemplified in them! Needless to say, there is no reason to think this\nwas Nietzsche\u2019s view.\n3. Nietzsche\u2019s Metaethics\n\nNietzsche holds that moral (i.e., MPS) values are not conducive to the\nflourishing of human excellence, and it is by reference to\nthis fact that he proposed to assess their value. The\nenterprise of assessing the value of certain other values (call them\nthe \u2018revalued values\u2019) naturally invites the metaethical\nquestion: what status \u2014 metaphysical, epistemological \u2014 do\nthe values used to undertake this revaluation (the \u2018assessing\nvalues\u2019) enjoy? (It is doubtful Nietzsche has a definite\nsemantic view about judgments of value: cf. Hussain 2013, esp. 412.)\nFollowing Leiter (2019: 49\u201350), we may distinguish \u201cPrivilege\nReadings\u201d of Nietzsche\u2019s metaethics \u2014 which claim\nthat Nietzsche holds that his own evaluative standpoint is either\nveridical or better justified than its target \u2014 from those\nreadings which deny the claim of privilege. (Note that defenders of\nthis latter, \u201cskeptical\u201d view need not read Nietzsche as a\nglobal anti-realist \u2014 i.e., as claiming that there are no truths\nor facts about anything, let alone truths about value \u2014 a\nreading which has now been widely discredited. There is, on the\nskeptical view at issue here, a special problem about the\nobjectivity of value. For an argument that Nietzsche is a global\nanti-realist about value in particular, see Leiter 2019: 84\u2013111.)\n3.1 Privilege Readings\n\nPrivilege Readings of Nietzsche come in two main varieties: Realist\nand Privilege Non-Realist (P-Non-Realist). The proponents of these\nviews would hold the following:\n\n\n(i) According to the Realist, there are normative facts.\n\n(ii) According to the P-Non-Realist, there are no normative facts, but\nsome normative judgments still enjoy a privilege by virtue of their\ninterpersonal appeal or acceptance.\n\n\nTo say that there are \u2018normative facts\u2019 will\nmean, for purposes here, that norms are (in some sense)\nobjective, i.e., mind- or attitude-independent features of\nthe world. Wilcox (1974), Schacht (1983) and Katsafanas (2013b), among\nmany others, have defended a Realist reading, while Foot (1973) has\ndefended a P-Non-Realist reading. We consider the difficulties\nafflicting these Privilege Readings in turn.\n\nRealist readings assign a special place to power (or will to power) in\nexplaining the objectivity of normative facts. On these views,\nNietzsche holds, first, that only power really has value and,\nsecond, that power is an objective, natural property.\nNietzsche\u2019s evaluative perspective is privileged, in turn,\nbecause it involves assessing (i) prudential value (value\nfor an agent) in terms of degree of power, and (ii)\nnon-prudential value in terms of maximization of prudential value\n(i.e., maximization of power). \n\nAccording to Schacht, for example, Nietzsche\u2019s account of\n\u201cthe fundamental character of life and the world\u201d as\nwill to power is supposed to \u201cground\u201d his own\nevaluative standpoint (1983: 348\u2013349). As Nietzsche writes (in a\npassage Schacht quotes): \u201cassuming that life itself is the will\nto power,\u201d then \u201cthere is nothing to life that has value,\nexcept the degree of power\u201d (WP 55). Nietzsche\u2019s\nrevaluation of values, then, assesses moral values on the basis of\ntheir \u201cdegree of power,\u201d something which constitutes an\n\u201cobjective measure of value\u201d (WP 674). Hence the privilege\nof his view: it embraces as an evaluative standard the only thing in\nlife that (in fact) has value (namely power), and employs this\n\u201cobjective measure of value\u201d in the revaluation (e.g., by\ncriticizing Christian morality because it does not maximize\n\u201cpower\u201d).\n\nWhat exactly is Nietzsche\u2019s argument on the N-Realist\nreading? Schacht writes:\n\nHuman life, for Nietzsche, is ultimately a part of a kind of vast\ngame\u2026[which] is, so to speak, the only game in town\u2026.The\nnature of the game, he holds, establishes a standard for the\nevaluation of everything falling within its compass. The availability\nof this standard places evaluation on footing that is as firm as that\non which the comprehension of life and the world stands. (1983, p.\n398)\n\n\nTalk of \u201cthe only game in town\u201d is far too metaphorical,\nhowever, to bear the philosophical weight demanded. From the fact that\n\u201clife itself is the will to power,\u201d how does it follow\nthat power is the only standard of value? From the fact, for\nexample, that all life obeys the laws of fundamental physics, nothing\nfollows about the appropriate standard of value. What Schacht and some\nothers seem to have in mind is something like John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nargument for utilitarianism, which proceeds from the premise that\nsince happiness is the only thing people desire or aim for, it follows\nthat happiness is the only thing that possesses intrinsic value. This\nargument, though, is famously unsuccessful: from the fact that only\nhappiness is desired, nothing at all follows about what\nought to be desired. Attempts to construe Nietzsche\u2019s\nargument in an analogous way encounter similar problems (Leiter 2000\nexplores the analogy in detail).\n\nOn Mill\u2019s well-known and oft-criticized \u2018proof\u2019 of\nthe principle of utility from his 1861 Utilitarianism, to\nshow that something is visible, we must show that it is seen; and to\nshow that something is audible, we must show that it is heard;\nanalogously,\n\n(P) to show that something is desirable (i.e., valuable), show that it\nis desired.\n\n\nMillian hedonism holds that only happiness or pleasure is\nintrinsically desirable or valuable (\u2018Prescriptive\nHedonism\u2019). Let us call \u2018Value Nihilism\u2019 the view\nthat there is nothing that has value or is valuable (or desirable). To\nget Prescriptive Hedonism from (P), then, plug in \u2018Descriptive\nHedonism\u2019 \u2014 the thesis that people do in fact desire\nonly pleasure as an end. If (P) is valid, Descriptive\nHedonism true, and Value Nihilism false, then the truth of\nPrescriptive Hedonism follows. ((P), of course, is not valid, a point\nto which we will return.)\n\nNotice, now, that the same type of argument seems to capture what the\nN-Realist construal of Nietzsche has in mind. That is, to get the\nN-Realist Nietzschean conclusion that what is valuable is power, take\n(P) and plug in a strong form of Nietzsche\u2019s descriptive\ndoctrine of the will to power \u2014 the doctrine, roughly, that all\npersons intrinsically \u2018desire\u2019 only power. If (P) is\nvalid, Value Nihilism false, and the descriptive doctrine of the will\nto power is true, then the normative conclusion about power, which\nSchacht is after, seems to follow. (Note, of course, that the Millian\nModel argument as formulated so far would show only that power is what\nis non-morally valuable or good for an agent. Of course, if the\nMillian Model argument for prudential value or non-moral goodness does\nnot work, then that provides a very strong (if defeasible)\nreason for supposing that there is no further argument for the related\naccount of non-prudential value as consisting in maximization of\npower.)\n\nWhat are the problems with this \u201cMillian argument\u201d? The\nfirst problem, of course, is that (P) is not valid. While from the\nfact that x is heard, it follows that x is audible,\nit does not follow from that fact that x is desired that\nx is desirable in the sense necessary for the\nargument. For while \u2018audible\u2019 can be fairly rendered\nas \u2018can be heard,\u2019 \u2018desirable,\u2019 in the context\nof Prescriptive Hedonism, means \u2018ought to be\ndesired\u2019 (not \u2018can\u2019 or \u2018is\u2019 desired).\nThus, while it follows that:\n\nIf x is heard, then x can be heard (\u2018is\naudible\u2019),\n\n\nit does not follow that,\n\nIf x is desired, then x ought to be desired\n(\u2018is desirable\u2019).\n\n\nYet in claiming that pleasure or power are valuable, Mill and the\nN-Realist Nietzsche are advancing a normative thesis. The truth of\nthis normative thesis, however, simply does not follow from the\ncorresponding descriptive thesis.\n\nMany, of course, have thought this too facile a response. Supplement\nthe argument, then, by adding an \u2018Internalist Constraint\u2019\n(IC), one that many philosophers have found plausible in the theory of\nvalue:\n\n(IC) Something cannot be valuable for a person unless the person is\ncapable of caring about (desiring) it.\n\n\nThe (IC) is motivated by the thought that it cannot be right to say\nthat \u2018X is valuable\u2019 for someone when x is alien\nto anything a person cares about or could care about: any\nplausible notion of value, the (IC) supposes, must have some strong\nconnection to a person\u2019s existing (or potential) motivational\nset.\n\nHow does the (IC) help? Recall (P):\n\n(P) To show that something is desirable (i.e., valuable) show that it\nis desired.\n\n\nNow the (IC) puts a constraint on what things can, in fact, be\ndesirable or valuable: namely, only those things that agents can, in\nfact, care about or desire. This suggests that we might reformulate\n(P) as follows:\n\n(P\u2032) To show that something is desirable (i.e., valuable), show\nthat it is or can be desired.\n\n\n(P\u2032) now is simply a different formulation of the (IC): if we\naccept the (IC) then we should accept (P\u2032). But what happens,\nthen, if we grant the truth of Descriptive Hedonism: namely, that only\npleasure is, in fact, desired. In that case, it would now follow that\nonly pleasure is desirable (ought to be desired) (assuming, again,\nthat Value Nihilism is false). That is, since something ought to be\ndesired only if it can be desired (internalism), then if only\nx can be desired, then only x ought to be\ndesired (assuming that Value Nihilism is false).\n\nWill this argument rescue the N-Realist Nietzsche? Two obstacles\nremain. The first, and perhaps less serious one, is that we must have\nsome reason for accepting the (IC) \u2014 or, more modestly, some\nreason for thinking Nietzsche accepts it. It is not clear, however,\nthat there are adequate textual grounds for saying where Nietzsche\nstands on this question. Since the (IC) does, however, seem to be\npresupposed by the Nietzschean remarks from the Nachlass that\nsupport N-Realism \u2014 in the sense that such remarks do not\nconstitute a good argument without the (IC) \u2014 let us grant that\nNietzsche accepts the (IC), and let us simply put aside the\ncontentious issue of whether we ought to accept the (IC) as a general\nphilosophical matter.\n\nA second difficulty will still remain: namely, that the argument for\nN-Realism still depends on the truth of the relevant descriptive\nthesis, in Nietzsche\u2019s case, the doctrine of the will to power.\nThis presents two problems. First, in the works Nietzsche chose to\npublish, it seems clear that he did not, in fact, accept the doctrine\nin the strong form required for the N-Realist argument (namely, that\nit is only power that persons ever aim for or desire). Second, it is\nsimply not a plausible doctrine in its strong form.\n\nFor the Millian Model argument for N-Realism to work in its new form\n(that is, supplemented with the (IC)) it must be the case that that\nwhich ought to be desired (\u2018is valuable\u2019) are the\nonly things that are, in fact, desired. Since the N-Realist\nNietzschean conclusion is that only power is valuable, power must be\nthe only thing that is, in fact, desired (assuming, again, that\nsomething is valuable, i.e., that Value Nihilism is false).\nMany, of course, have thought that Nietzsche held precisely this view,\nand he plainly says much to suggest that. Zarathustra states that,\n\u201cWhere I found the living, there I found will to power\u201d (Z\nII:12); Nietzsche refers to \u201cthe will to power which is the will\nof life\u201d (GS 349); he says \u201cthe really fundamental\ninstinct of life\u2026aims at the expansion of power\u201d\n(GS 349); \u201clife simply is will to power,\u201d meaning\na striving \u201cto grow, spread, seize, become predominant\u201d\n(BGE 259); he refers to his \u201ctheory that in all events a\nwill to power is operating\u201d (GM II:12); he claims that\n\u201c[a] living thing seeks above all to discharge its\nstrength \u2014 life itself is will to power\u201d (BGE\n13); and so on.\n\nThe difficulty is that Nietzsche says other things which might suggest\nthat the stronger remarks are misleading; for example:\n\nLife itself is to my mind the instinct for growth, for durability, for\nan accumulation of forces, for power: where the will to power\nis lacking there is decline. It is my contention that all the supreme\nvalues of mankind lack this will\u2026. (A 6)\n\n\nBut if all actions manifested this will, then this\nwill could never be found lacking. Yet Nietzsche thinks it\ncan be lacking, which means he must countenance the possibility that\nnot everyone aims for (\u2018desires\u2019) power.\n\nThis passage is not atypical. Later in the same work, he returns to\nthe same theme concerning \u201c[w]herever the will to power declines\nin any form\u201d (A 17). In the immediately preceding work he claims\nthat the \u201ceffects\u201d of liberal institutions are\n\u201cknown well enough: they undermine the will to power\u201d (TI\nIX:38). And in the immediately subsequent work (his last), Nietzsche\nrefers to \u201cthe terrible aspects of reality (in affects,\nin desires, in the will to power)\u2026\u201d (EH IV:4), which\ncertainly sounds as if will to power is simply one among various\ncharacteristics of reality \u2014 alongside affects and\ndesires, rather than the essential core of them all.\n\nThree other general textual considerations count against attributing\nthe strong doctrine of the will to power to Nietzsche. First, if, as\nthe defenders of the strong doctrine believe, \u201chis fundamental\nprinciple is the \u2018will to power\u2019\u201d, then it\nis hard to understand why he says almost nothing about will to power\n\u2014 and nothing at all to suggest it is his \u201cfundamental\nprinciple\u201d \u2014 in the two major self-reflective moments in\nthe Nietzschean corpus: his last major work, Ecce Homo, where\nhe reviews and assesses his life and writings, including specifically\nall his prior books (EH III); and the series of new prefaces he wrote\nfor The Birth of Tragedy, Human, All Too Human,\nDawn, and The Gay Science in 1886, in which he\nrevisits his major themes. That this putative \u201cfundamental\nprinciple\u201d merits no mention on either occasion strongly\nsuggests that its role in Nietzsche\u2019s thought has been greatly\noverstated.\n\nSecond, the view at issue presupposes an unusually strong doctrine of\nthe will to power: a doctrine, to the effect, that all life\n(actions, events) reflects the will to power. But recent scholarship\nhas cast doubt on whether Nietzsche ultimately accepted such a\ndoctrine. The single most famous passage on will to power in the\nNietzschean corpus, for example, is the concluding section (1067) of\nThe Will to Power, where he affirms that, \u201cThis\nworld is the will to power \u2014 and nothing besides! And you\nyourselves are also this will to power \u2014 and nothing\nbesides!\u201d Although a favorite of commentators for many years,\nthe passage has now been conclusively discredited by the leading\nscholar of the Nachlass, the late Mazzino Montinari.\nMontinari has shown that Nietzsche had, in fact, discarded the passage\nby the spring of 1887 (1982, pp. 103\u2013104)! It was, as Montinari\nnotes, made part of the K\u00f6selitz-Forster compilation of The\nWill to Power (the basis for the English-language edition by\nKaufmann and Hollingdale) notwithstanding \u201cNietzsche\u2019s\nliterary intentions\u201d (1982, p. 104).\n\nFinally, Maudemarie Clark has argued that Nietzsche could not have\naccepted the very strongest form of the doctrine of the will to power\n\u2014 namely, that all force, animate and inanimate, is\nwill to power \u2014 given the putative argument he gives for it.\nClark points out that the only argument for this\ndoctrine of the will to power in Nietzsche\u2019s published works\n\u2014 in Section 36 of Beyond Good and Evil \u2014 is cast\nin the conditional form: if we accept certain initial hypotheses,\nthen, Nietzsche thinks, the strong doctrine of the will to power\nfollows. But one of the antecedents of this conditional is the\n\u201ccausality of the will,\u201d and Clark argues that Nietzsche\nclearly rejects such causality elsewhere in his work (e.g.,\nGS 127, TI II:5, TI VI:3). Therefore, this section cannot constitute\nan argument for the strongest doctrine of the will to power that\nNietzsche, himself, would actually accept! Rather than embracing the\nstrongest form of the doctrine, Clark argues that Nietzsche is,\nsomewhat ironically, illustrating the very flaw of philosophers he\nwarns against in the surrounding passages: namely, their tendency to\npropound theories of the essence of reality that are just projections\nof their own evaluative commitments (Clark 1990, pp. 212\u2013227).\nThus, Nietzsche says of the Stoic talk of living \u201caccording to\nnature\u201d that \u201cwhile you pretend rapturously to read the\ncanon of your law in nature, you want something opposite\u2026.Your\npride wants to impose your morality, your ideal, on\nnature\u2026\u201d (BGE 9). How, Clark wonders, could\nNietzsche\u2019s own doctrine of will to power be exempted from such\na charge? (Note, too, that Montinari claims that the one surviving\nrelic of 1067 of The Will to Power in the published works is\nprecisely the ironic Section 36 of Beyond Good and Evil\n(1982, p. 104).)\n\nWhat, then, does Nietzsche believe about will to power? There are, to\nbe sure, competing views in the secondary literature. Reginster 2006\ntreats will to power as a will to overcome resistances; Richardson\n1996 treats will to power as the tendency of every drive to redirect\nevery other drive towards its own ends. As others have noted (e.g.,\nClark 1990: 209\u2013212), Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of will to\npower, in its original deployment and most of its later occurrences in\nthe published work, is psychological in character: the will\nto power is posited as the best psychological explanation for a wide\nvariety of human behaviors. Here Richardson\u2019s account seems to\nfare somewhat better than Reginster\u2019s. (Katsafanas 2013b follows\nReginster, and tries to develop a \u201cconstitutivist\u201d account\nof objective value based on the idea that all actions aim to overcome\nresistances; Huddleston 2017 offers a trenchant critique of the\nplausibility of such a view.) Yet Richardson\u2019s account has\ndifficulty with some of Nietzsche\u2019s claims, as when he says that\n\u201cevery animal\u2026instinctively strives for optimal conditions\nunder which it can\u2026attain its maximum in the feeling of power\u201d\n(GM III:7), which seems to propose desire for power as a competitor\nwith psychological hedonism. But a universal desire for either\npleasure or power feelings is not especially plausible, even if both\nmotives are important ones. Indeed, as the preceding passages and\nconsiderations make clear, Nietzsche could not have believed that will\nto power was the exclusive explanation for all human behavior. To the\nextent he sometimes seems to embrace this stronger claim (see the\nexample, above), we must simply take Nietzsche to have overstated his\ncase \u2014 something which his penchant for hyperbolic rhetoric and\npolemics often leads him to do \u2014 or to be engaged in the kind of\nironic move described by Clark, above. That would, of course, be quite\nfortunate, since it is hardly plausible that will to power is the\nexclusive explanation for all human behavior\n\nThere is an additional, textual worry for the argument that will to\npower provides an objective criterion of value lurking here as well.\nNietzsche only makes the remarks that seem to suggest that power is an\nobjective criterion in passages from the Nachlass, work that\nNietzsche never published during his lifetime. Thus, even if one\nthought that Nietzsche really held the strong descriptive doctrine of\nthe will to power \u2014 the doctrine that all animate force (perhaps\nall force) is will to power \u2014 in his published works,\nit is still the case that he only uses this doctrine to argue for the\nnormative conclusion in Nachlass material. Since scholars\nhave now raised important doubts about the canonical status of this\nNachlass material (Montinari 1982, pp. 92\u2013104;\nHollingdale 1985, pp. 166\u2013172, 182\u2013186), this might\nsuggest that a view ought not to be attributed to Nietzsche\nsolely on the basis of its articulation in these notebooks,\nwhich is exactly what the N-Realist reading requires. (For more recent\ndebate about the relevance of the Nachlass material to\nunderstanding will to power, see Katsafanas 2013b, pp. 248\u2013250 and\nLeiter 2019, pp. 60\u201362.)\n\nAlthough not attributing to Nietzsche any kind of value realism,\nPhilippa Foot, like Schacht, wants to show that Nietzsche is doing\nsomething more than simply expressing his idiosyncratic view, a view\nthat admits of no interpersonal justification. While agreeing that\nNietzsche\u2019s intention is, in part, \u201cto present us with a\nclash of interests \u2014 the good of the strong against that of the\nweak,\u201d Foot adds that \u201cthis is not all he wants to\nsuggest\u201d (1973: 162). Noting that Nietzsche \u201cseems to want\nto say that anyone who is strong, independent, and so on \u2014\nanyone who fits his description of the higher type of man \u2014 is\none who has value in himself\u201d (163), Foot goes on to\nexplicate this notion of \u201cvalue\u201d as follows:\n\n[I]t does make sense to say that we value strong and\nexceptional individuals\u2026. We do find patterns of reaction to\nexceptional men that would allow us to see here a valuing rather\nsimilar to valuing on aesthetic grounds\u2026. I am thinking of the\ninterest and admiration which is the common attitude to remarkable men\nof exceptional independence of mind and strength of will\u2026.\n[Nietzsche] is appealing to our tendency to admire certain\nindividuals whom we see as powerful and splendid\u2026. [There is] a\nsimilarity between the way we attribute value (aesthetic\nvalue) to art objects and the value that Nietzsche attributes\nto a certain kind of man, both resting on a set of common\nreactions\u2026. (1973: 163)\n\n\nSo Nietzsche, on this account, does not claim that his evaluative\nperspective is veridical; he simply claims that it enjoys a certain\nsort of interpersonal appeal, owing to our \u201ccommon attitude to\nremarkable men,\u201d \u201cour tendency to admire certain\nindividuals,\u201d to find them aesthetically appealing. There may be\nno fact-of-the-matter as to whether higher men are or are not\nreally valuable, but Nietzsche\u2019s evaluative standpoint\nis privileged by virtue of its appeal to all of us. We\u2019re all\ninterested, it seems, in the flourishing of higher men.\n\nYet Nietzsche could not embrace the view that the flourishing of\n\u201chigher men\u201d will appeal to \u201cour\ntendency\u201d to admire such men or to any sort of\n\u201ccommon\u201d attitude, given the logic of his critique of\nmorality. This follows from what we may call Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u2018Callicleanism,\u2019 after Plato\u2019s Callicles in the\nGorgias. It has now become something of a commonplace for\ncommentators to note that Nietzsche did not accept one sort\nof Calliclean view, namely, the view that \u201canyone who is to live\naright should suffer his appetites to grow to the greatest extent and\nnot check them\u201d (Gorgias, 419e) (cf. Nehamas 1985:\n202\u2013203; BGE 188). Yet there remains a more important respect in\nwhich Nietzsche\u2019s view is Calliclean: namely, in its\nembrace of the Calliclean doctrine that the inferior employ morality\nto make \u201cslaves of those who are naturally better\u201d\n(Gorgias, 491e-492a), that the weaker folk, the\nmajority\u2026frame the laws [and, we might add, the morals] for\ntheir own advantage\u2019 in order to \u2018frighten [the strong] by\nsaying that to overreach others is shameful and evil\u2019\n(Gorgias, 483b-d). In short, Callicles\u2019 view is that\nmorality is simply the prudence of the weak, who unable to do what the\nstrong can do, opt instead to put the actions of the strong under the\nban of morality. This, of course, is essentially Nietzsche\u2019s\nview as well. So, for example, Nietzsche describes slave morality as\nsimply \u2018the prudence [Klugheit] of the lowest\norder\u2019 (GM I:13), and he observes that \u201ceverything that\nelevates an individual above the herd and intimidates the neighbor\nis\u2026called evil\u201d (BGE 201), that \u201c[m]oral\njudgments and condemnations constitute the favorite revenge of the\nspiritually limited against those less limited\u201d (BGE 219), and\nhe claims that the \u201cchief means\u201d by which the \u201cweak\nand mediocre\u2026weaken and pull down the stronger\u201d is\n\u201cthe moral judgment\u201d (WP 345).\n\nRecall, now, that Foot wanted to resist the view that in his\nrevaluation Nietzsche simply \u201cpresent[s] us with a clash of\ninterests \u2014 the good of the strong against that of the\nweak\u201d (1973: 162); instead, Foot suggests that Nietzsche is\nappealing to a \u2018common\u2019 tendency to admire higher men, men\nwho would otherwise be thwarted by the reign of moral values. But for\na Calliclean like Nietzsche, it is part of the very appeal of morality\nthat it does thwart the flourishing of higher men. If that is\nright, then he could not think that the flourishing of\n\u201chigher men\u201d would appeal to everyone. It is precisely\nbecause it doesn\u2019t that morality arises in the first place, as a\nmeans for the low and base to thwart the flourishing of the high. This\nis not to deny that higher men may still be admirable in the eyes of\nthe base and low (hence their envy); it is to deny, however, that\nNietzsche\u2019s evaluative perspective \u2014 that it is an\nobjection to morality that it thwarts the high \u2014 could\nenjoy a privilege in virtue of this shared admiration. On the\nCalliclean picture, there is a fundamental hostility between the high\nand low, the strong and the weak, one which will not be bridged by\ninviting the low to admire the high, or the weak, the strong.\n\u201cThe well-being of the majority and the well-being of the few\nare opposite viewpoints of value,\u201d Nietzsche says in the\n\u2018Note\u2019 at the end of the first essay of the\nGenealogy. And in Nietzsche\u2019s revaluation, it appears,\nthere is no evaluative standpoint from which one could successfully\nmediate and reconcile the normative claims of the opposing\nmoralities.\n3.2 Nietzsche\u2019s Anti-Realism\n\nIf Nietzsche is not a realist about value, then he must be an\nanti-realist: he must deny that there is any objective fact of the\nmatter that would privilege his evaluative perspective over its\ntarget. (This, in fact, is the most familiar reading outside the\nsecondary literature on Nietzsche; one finds this view of\nNietzsche\u2019s metaethics, for example, in the sociologist Max\nWeber and the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, among many\nothers.) We must be careful about the kinds of judgments to which this\nanti-realism applies. Recall that in his critique of morality,\nNietzsche appears to hold that, e.g., \u201cherd\u201d morality is\ngood for the herd, but that it is bad for higher\nmen. He says, for example, that, \u201cThe ideas of the herd\nshould rule in the herd \u2014 but not reach out beyond\nit\u201d (WP 287; emphasis added); and elsewhere he describes slave\nmorality as simply \u201cthe prudence of the lowest order\u201d (GM\nI:13). It may appear that regarding value judgments pertaining to\nwelfare or prudential goodness \u2014 what is good or bad for\nparticular sorts of persons \u2014 Nietzsche believes there is an\nobjective fact of the matter, though one relative to type-facts about\npersons. But this is not right: while Nietzsche believes it is\nobjectively correct that different moralities have certain effects on\ndifferent kinds of people, that these effects are \u201cgood\u201d\nor \u201cbad\u201d itself admits of anti-realist interpretation (cf.\nLeiter 2015: 119 for a revision of the view defended in Leiter 2002).\nEven more importantly, though, Nietzsche\u2019s anti-realism applies\nto the \u201crevaluative\u201d judgment that follows upon these\njudgments about the effects of different moralities: that is, the\njudgment that because herd morality is good for the\nherd but bad for higher men, herd morality (or the universal\nreign of herd morality) is bad or disvaluable. (Leiter 2019: 84\u2013111\nargues that Nietzsche\u2019s anti-realism even extends to epistemic\nvalue, an issue beyond the scope of this entry.)\n\nNietzsche certainly says much that sounds like he is denying the\nobjectivity of values. Zarathustra tells us that, \u201cVerily, men\ngave themselves all their good and evil [Gut und\nB\u00f6se]\u201d (Z I:15) and that \u201cgood and evil that are\nnot transitory do not exist\u201d (Z II:12). In The Gay\nScience, Nietzsche explains that, \u201cWhatever has\nvalue in our world now does not have value in itself,\naccording to its nature \u2014 nature is always value-less, but has\nbeen given value at some time\u201d (301; cf. D 3). Indeed,\nlike certain radical anti-realists, he tends to equate evaluative\nquestions with matters of taste. \u201cWhat is now decisive against\nChristianity is our taste [Geschmack], no longer our\nreasons\u201d (GS 132), he writes, noting later in the same work that\nwhat counts as \u201cjustice\u2026is by all means a matter of\ntaste, nothing more\u201d (GS 184).\n\nNietzsche\u2019s primary argument for anti-realism about value is\nexplanatory: moral facts don\u2019t figure in the\n\u201cbest explanation\u201d of experience, and so are not real\nconstituents of the objective world (Leiter 2019: 17\u201348). Moral\nvalues, in short, can be \u201cexplained away.\u201d Such a\nconclusion follows from Nietzsche\u2019s naturalism (on the latter,\nsee the competing accounts in Janaway 2007 and Leiter 2013). As we saw\nin the context of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality, Nietzsche\nthinks a person\u2019s moral beliefs can be explained in naturalistic\nterms, i.e., in terms of type-facts about that person. Thus, to\nexplain a person\u2019s moral judgments, one needn\u2019t appeal to\nthe existence of objective moral facts: psycho-physical facts about\nthe person suffice. Thus, since non-evaluative type-facts are the\nprimary explanatory facts, and since explanatory power is the mark of\nobjective facts, it appears that there cannot be any value facts.\nMoral judgments and evaluations are \u201cimages\u201d and\n\u201cfantasies,\u201d says Nietzsche, the mere effects of\ntype-facts about agents (D 119).\n\nTo describe Nietzsche as a moral anti-realist is so far only to\nascribe to him a metaphysical view: namely, that there are no\nobjective facts about what is morally right and wrong. It is a\nsomewhat vexed interpretive question whether we should also ascribe to\nNietzsche a particular view about the semantics of moral judgment, a\ntopic about which no philosopher prior to the 20th century\nhad a worked\u2013out view (see again Hussain 2013). For example,\nwhile it seems clear (from the passages quoted above) that Nietzsche\nhas distinct views on the central metaphysical question about value,\nit seems equally apparent that there are inadequate textual resources\nfor ascribing to him a satisfying answer to the semantic question.\nElements of his view, for example, might suggest assimilation to what\nwe would call non-cognitivism and, in particular, expressivism. For\nexample, in describing master and Christian morality as\n\u201copposite forms in the optics of value [Werthe],\u201d\nNietzsche goes on to assert that, as opposite \u201coptical\u201d\nforms, they \u201care\u2026immune to reasons and refutations. One\ncannot refute Christianity; one cannot refute a disease of the\neye\u2026. The concepts \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018untrue\u2019\nhave, as it seems to me, no meaning in optics\u201d (CW Epilogue).\nThis passage \u2014 typical of putatively expressivist passages in\nNietzsche \u2014 is, however, ambiguous. For the passage could mean\nthat \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are meaningless\nnot because evaluative judgments are essentially\nnon-cognitive, but rather because competing evaluative views are\nimmune to the effects of reasoning. There may be rational\ngrounds for thinking one view better than another, perhaps for\nthinking one true and the other false, but since reasoning has so\nlittle impact in this context, it is \u201cmeaningless\u201d (in the\nsense of pointless) to raise issues of truth and falsity.\n\nMore recently, Hussain (2007) has argued that we read Nietzsche as a\nfictionalist about moral value: granted that Nietzsche is an\nanti-realist about value (there exists no objective fact\nabout what has value in-itself), Hussain wonders what it is those who\n\u201ccreate values\u201d can understand themselves to have done?\nValuation, in this Nietzschean world, Hussain argues, involves a kind\nof \u201cmake-believe,\u201d pretending that things are\nvaluable-in-themselves, while knowing that nothing, in fact, has such\nvalue. There is a pressing philosophical question here \u2014 whether\n\u201cmake-believe\u201d about value really could suffice for\nvaluing \u2014 but also an interpretive problem: does Nietzsche\nreally think that moral judgments express beliefs,\nthat is, truth-apt propositional attitudes which then requires\nfictionalist treatment? It would be astonishing if any\n19th-century philosopher were to have a clear\nanswer to such a question (Hussain 2013 seems to have come around to\nthis view).\n\nWhile Nietzsche was, to be sure, among the first to recognize the\nextent to which linguistic and grammatical practices generate\nmetaphysical assumptions and problems, he simply did not view\nmetaphysical questions themselves as best framed as issues\nabout the semantics of a given region of discourse (e.g., are the\nterms genuinely and successfully referential, or are they\n\u201cmerely\u201d expressive?). It is doubtful, then, that there\nare adequate grounds for assigning Nietzsche a view on such subtle\nmatters as whether ethical language is primarily cognitive or\nnon-cognitive, when it clearly evinces aspects of both descriptive and\nprescriptive discourse.\n\nTwo aspects of Nietzsche\u2019s work may, however, seem to be in\ntension with value anti-realism, even understood as only a\nmetaphysical doctrine: first, his reliance on the distinction between\n\u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d types of human beings;\nand second, the force and seriousness with which he presents his\nevaluative judgments.\n\nAs we saw, above, Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality presupposes a\ndistinction between higher and lower types of people. But are there\nobjective facts about who is \u201chigh\u201d and who is\n\u201clow\u201d? And if so, would such a view be compatible with\nanti-realism?\n\nSuppose there are objective facts about \u201chigh\u201d and\n\u201clow\u201d: Goethe really is a higher type, and the\nherd animal really is a lower type. But there is still no\nobjective fact about whether MPS is non-prudentially\ndisvaluable just because it has the effect of thwarting the\nflourishing of objectively higher types. Realism about\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d does not entail realism about\nnon-prudential value, so the argument might go.\n\nSuch a response cannot work for two reasons. First, the judgment that\n\u201cX is a higher person\u201d includes a significant evaluative\ncomponent: \u201cGoethe is a higher type\u201d is not\nevaluatively neutral in the manner of \u201cGoethe is a\ntaller than average type.\u201d In saying that someone is a\nhigher type, we seem committed to some positive evaluative attitude\ntowards that person (e.g., that it is good to have persons like that\naround). If there is an objective fact that \u201cX is a higher\ntype,\u201d and it is a fact that MPS thwarts the flourishing of\nhigher types, then it would seem that at least some objective weight\nmust accrue to the Nietzschean position that MPS is disvaluable\nbecause of this effect it has.\n\nSecond, if it is an objective fact that Goethe is a higher type and,\nsay, Hitler is a herd animal, then the following counterfactual would\nseem to be true:\n\n(C) If Hitler had been like Goethe, he would have been better off.\n\n\nHe would have been better off because he would have been a higher\ntype, instead of a lower type \u2014 and it is an objective fact that\nthe high are really high, and the low are really\nlow. But this seemingly objective judgment \u2014 that Hitler would\nhave been better off had he been more like Goethe \u2014 is\na non-prudential value judgment; it is not a judgment about what is\ngood for Hitler under the circumstances, but rather a judgment about\nwhat would make Hitler better off, but for his circumstances. In\ngeneral, it seems that conceding the objectivity of \u201chigh\u201d\nand \u201clow\u201d permits one to make objective non-prudential\nvalue judgments like: the good of the higher type is superior to the\ngood of the lower type.\n\nFor these reasons, if Nietzsche is an anti-realist about\nnon-prudential moral value, then he must also be an anti-realist about\njudgments of \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow,\u201d It may be an\nobjective fact that MPS thwarts the flourishing of those Nietzsche\nregards as higher types; but it is not an objective fact that\nthey are really higher.\n\nIn fact, there is textual evidence that this is exactly\nNietzsche\u2019s view. For example, in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, Nietzsche writes that, \u201cGood and evil, and\nrich and poor, and high and low [Hoch und Gering], and all\nthe names of values \u2014 arms shall they be and clattering signs\nthat life must overcome itself again and again\u201d (Z II:7). Here\nNietzsche is explicit that \u201chigh and low\u201d are simply\n\u201cnames of values,\u201d just like \u201cgood and evil.\u201d\nBut since, as we have just seen, Nietzsche is an anti-realist about\nthese latter evaluative concepts, it should hardly be surprisingly\nthat he is an anti-realist about the former.\n\nThe actual contexts in which Nietzsche marks traits as\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d invite the same reading.\nConsider, for example, the exposition in the Genealogy (I:14)\nof the sense in which slave morality is the \u201cprudence of the\nlowest order\u201d (GM, I:13). According to Nietzsche, slave morality\ntakes certain typical characteristics of the \u201clowest\norder\u201d and redescribes them in morally praiseworthy lights. So,\nfor example, their impotence becomes \u201cgoodness of heart,\u201d\ntheir anxious lowliness becomes \u201chumility,\u201d their\n\u201cinoffensiveness\u201d and \u201clingering at the door\u201d\nbecomes \u201cpatience\u201d, and their desire for retaliation\nbecomes a desire for justice. If Nietzsche were really a realist about\nthe concept of \u201clowness\u201d, then we ought to be able to\nidentify the objective facts in virtue of which something is really\nlow. Yet when Nietzsche tries to describe all patience as\nnothing more than a \u201clingering at the door\u201d and\nall humility as simply \u201canxious lowliness,\u201d it is\nnatural to think that there is no \u201cobjective\u201d fact about\n\u201clowness\u201d here but simply a polemical and evaluatively\nloaded characterization. To think that all humility is really\n\u201canxious lowliness\u201d is just to identify oneself as one who\nshares Nietzsche\u2019s evaluative sensibility, one \u201cwhose ears\nare related to ours\u201d (GS 381), one \u201cpredisposed and\npredestined\u201d for Nietzsche\u2019s insights (BGE 30). In short,\ngiven the way in which Nietzsche actually speaks of the\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow,\u201d we should understand\nNietzsche\u2019s metaethical position as also characterizing these\nterms: to say that \u201cX is low\u201d is not to describe an\nobjective fact, but rather to identify oneself as sharing in a certain\nevaluative sensibility or taste.\n\nThere remains a final interpretive difficulty: for Nietzsche simply\ndoes not write like someone who thinks his evaluative judgments are\nmerely his idiosyncratic preferences! On the metaethical position\nelaborated here, it seems Nietzsche must believe that if, in response\nto his point that \u201cmorality were to blame if the highest\npower and splendor actually possible to the type man was never in\nfact attained\u201d (GM Pref:6), someone were to say, \u201cSo much\nthe better for morality!\u201d, there would be nothing further to say\nto that person: at the best, Nietzsche might turn his back and say,\n\u201cOh well \u2014 doesn\u2019t share my evaluative\ntastes.\u201d Yet there seems to be a substantial amount of\nNietzschean rhetoric (see, e.g., BGE 259; TI V:6 & IX:35; EH IV:4,\n7, 8) that cannot be reconciled with this metaethical view, and which\ncries out instead for some sort of realist construal. Three sorts of\nconsiderations, however, block the inference from Nietzsche\u2019s\nrhetoric to the conclusion that he embraced a realist metaphysics of\nvalue.\n\nFirst, while the rhetoric is forceful, the language of truth and\nfalsity is conspicuously absent. As some of the passages quoted above\nsuggest, Nietzsche writes with great force and passion in opposition\nto MPS. But it is striking that he does not use the epistemic value\nterms \u2014 the language of truth and falsity, real and unreal\n\u2014 in this context. This, of course, might not be notable, except\nfor the fact that in his equally forceful attacks on, e.g., Christian\ncosmology, or religious interpretations of natural events, he invokes\nthe conceptual apparatus of truth and falsity, truth and lie, reality\nand appearance, all the time (cf. Leiter 1994, pp. 336\u2013338).\nThus, for example, Nietzsche lampoons Christian cosmology as lacking\n\u201ceven a single point of contact with reality\u201d and as\n\u201cpure fiction\u201d which\n\u201cfalsifies\u2026reality\u201d (\u201cdie Wirklichtkeit\nf\u00e4lscht\u201d) (A, 15). Such epistemic value terms are\nstrikingly absent in Nietzsche\u2019s remarks about value. One\nnatural explanation for this difference in rhetoric \u2014 natural\nespecially in light of the substantial evidence for his anti-realism\n\u2014 is precisely that in the moral case he does not think there is\nany fact of the matter.\n\nSecond, in undertaking a \u201crevaluation of all values,\u201d\nNietzsche, as we have seen, wants to alert \u201chigher\u201d types\nto the fact that MPS is not, in fact, conducive to their flourishing.\nThus, he needs to \u201cwake up\u201d his appropriate readers\n\u2014 those whose \u201cears are related\u201d to his \u2014 to\nthe dangers of MPS, a task made all the more difficult by MPS\u2019s\npretension to be \u201cmorality itself.\u201d Given, then, that\nNietzsche\u2019s target is a certain sort of misunderstanding on the\npart of higher men, and given the difficulty of supplanting the norms\nthat figure in this misunderstanding (the norms of MPS), it should be\nunsurprising that Nietzsche writes with passion and force: he must\nshake higher types out of their intuitive commitment to the moral\ntraditions of two millennia! Moreover, Nietzsche\u2019s naturalism,\nand the prominent role it assigns to non-conscious drives and\ntype-facts, leads him to be skeptical about the efficacy of reasons\nand arguments. But a skeptic about the efficacy of rational persuasion\nmight very well opt for persuasion through other rhetorical\ndevices.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, a rhetorical tone like\nNietzsche\u2019s \u2014 looked at in the context of his life \u2014\ndoes not really suggest realism about the content, but rather\ndesperation on the part of the author to reach an increasingly distant\nand uninterested audience. The Nietzsche who was almost completely\nignored during the years before illness erased his intellect and\ndeprived him of his sanity might have resorted to more and more\nstrident and violent rhetoric in frustration over not being heard\n\u2014 and not because he was a realist. Indeed, in the absence of\nexplicit evidence of value realism, this seems the most plausible\nexplanation for the vast majority of the passages with which we have\nbeen concerned in this section.\n\nFor these various reasons, then, the character of Nietzsche\u2019s\nrhetoric can be understood as compatible with his anti-realism about\nvalue.\n4. Nietzsche\u2019s Lack of a Political Philosophy\n\nWhen the Danish critic Georg Brandes (1842\u20131927) first\nintroduced a wider European audience to Nietzsche\u2019s ideas during\npublic lectures in 1888, he concentrated on Nietzsche\u2019s\nvitriolic campaign against morality and what Brandes dubbed (with\nNietzsche\u2019s subsequent approval) Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201caristocratic radicalism.\u201d On this reading, Nietzsche was\nprimarily concerned with questions of value and culture\n(especially the value of morality and its effect on culture), and his\nphilosophical standpoint was acknowledged to be a deeply\nilliberal one: what matters are great human beings, not the\n\u201cherd.\u201d The egalitarian premise of all contemporary moral\nand political theory \u2014 the premise, in one form or another, of\nthe equal worth or dignity of each person \u2014 is simply absent in\nNietzsche\u2019s work. This naturally leads to the question: what\npolitics would Nietzsche recommend to us in light of his repudiation\nof the egalitarian premise?\n\nA striking feature of the reception of Nietzsche in the last thirty\nyears years is the large literature that has developed on\nNietzsche\u2019s purported political philosophy. Two positions have\ndominated the literature: one attributes to Nietzsche a commitment to\naristocratic forms of social ordering (call this the\n\u201cAristocratic Politics View\u201d [e.g., Detwiler 1990]), while\nthe other denies that Nietzsche has any political philosophy at all\n(call this the \u201cAnti-Politics View\u201d [e.g., Hunt 1985,\nLeiter 2002/2015]). \n\nEven the casual reader knows, of course, that Nietzsche has intense\nopinions about everything, from German cuisine to the\nunparalleled brilliance (in Nietzsche\u2019s estimation) of\nBizet\u2019s operas, not to mention various and sundry\n\u201cpolitical\u201d matters. The interpretive question, however,\nis whether scattered remarks and parenthetical outbursts add up to\nsystematic views on questions of philosophical significance about\npolitics.\n\nIs Nietzsche even interested in political philosophy? Nussbaum (1997:\n1) declares that, \u201cNietzsche claimed to be a political thinker,\nindeed an important political thinker\u201d, but she can produce no\nclear textual evidence in support of that contention. She notes that,\n\u201cIn Ecce Homo he announced that he was \u2018a bringer\nof glad tidings like no one before me,\u2019 and that those glad\ntidings are political\u201d (1997: 1). In fact, Nietzsche does\nnot say the \u201ctidings\u201d are political; indeed, as\nthe earlier discussion of his critique of morality shows, the\n\u201ctidings\u201d are directed only at select readers, nascent\nhigher human beings, for whom morality is harmful. That this section\nfrom Ecce Homo (IV:1) concludes with the hyperbolic claim\nthat only with Nietzsche does \u201cthe earth [first] know[\u00a0]\ngreat politics\u201d does as little to establish that he has\na political philosophy as the claim, in the very same\npassage, that Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cglad tidings\u201d will\ncause \u201cupheavals, a convulsion of earthquakes, a moving of\nmountains and valleys\u201d does to establish that he has a\ngeological theory.\n\nNussbaum goes on to suggest that \u201cserious political\nthought\u201d (1997: 2) must address seven precise topics (e.g.,\n\u201cprocedural justification\u201d [\u201cprocedures\u2026that\nlegitimate and/or justify the resulting proposals\u201d for\n\u201cpolitical structure\u201d], \u201cgender and the\nfamily,\u201d and \u201cjustice between nations\u201d) \u2014 most\nof which, of course, Nietzsche does not address. (Marx does not\naddress most of them either.) Instead of drawing the natural\nconclusion \u2014 Nietzsche was not interested in questions of\npolitical philosophy \u2014 she, surprisingly, decries his\n\u201cbaneful influence\u201d in political philosophy (1997:\n12).\n\nThose who claim to find a political philosophy in Nietzsche typically\nrely on a handful of passages \u2014 most often, sections 56\u201357\nof The Antichrist, but also section BGE 257 on\n\u201cslavery\u201d \u2014 as the slender evidence on the basis of\nwhich elaborate views about the ideal forms of social and political\norganization are attributed to Nietzsche. In particular, Nietzsche is\nsaid to endorse (in A 56\u201357) the caste-based society associated\nwith the Hindu Laws of Manu as his political ideal:\n\nThe order of castes, the supreme, the dominant law, is merely\nthe sanction of a natural order, a natural lawfulness of the\nfirst rank, over which no arbitrariness, no \u201cmodern idea\u201d\nhas any power\u2026Nature, not Manu, distinguishes the pre-eminently\nspiritual ones, those who are pre-eminently strong in muscle and\ntemperament, and those, the third type, who excel neither in one\nrespect nor in the other, the mediocre ones \u2014 the last as the\ngreat majority, the first as the elite. (A 57)\n\n\nThis reading, however, does not withstand scrutiny, as Thomas Brobjer\n(1998) has argued. As Brobjer notes, the only other published\ndiscussion of the laws of Manu, in Twilight of the Idols, is\nhighly critical, not laudatory (pp. 304\u2013305); Nietzsche\u2019s\ndiscussions of comparable caste-based societies are all critical (pp.\n308\u2013309); and Nietzsche\u2019s unpublished notebooks contain\nnumerous entries on the theme \u201ca critique of the Laws of\nManu\u201d (pp. 310\u2013312). The passage from The\nAntichrist only seems laudatory when read out of\ncontext; as Brobjer remarks:\n\n[Nietzsche\u2019s] purpose [in these passages in The\nAntichrist] is to make the contrast with Christianity as strong\nas possible, to provoke the reader, to make the reader\n\u201crealize\u201d that even the laws of Manu\u2026 is higher and\nmore humane than Christianity. Whereas Christianity destroys, the\nintention at least of the laws of Manu was to save and protect. (1998,\npp. 312\u2013313)\n\n\nIn other words, the rhetorical context of the passage is\ncrucial, though it is typically ignored by commentators defending the\nAristocratic Politics View. Indeed, the passage quoted above from A 57\nis specifically introduced to illustrate the use of the \u201choly\nlie\u201d (the lie being, in this case, the claim that \u201cnature,\nnot Manu\u201d distinguishes the castes). And as even the title of\nthe book would suggest, Nietzsche\u2019s target is Christianity, and\nthe laws of Manu are invoked simply to drive home that point. Thus,\nalthough Manu and Christianity both depend on lies, at least\nthe Manu lies, according to Nietzsche, are not put in the service of\nChristian ends, i.e., \u201cpoisoning, slander, negation of life,\ncontempt for the body, the degradation and self-violation of man\nthrough the concept of sin\u201d (A 56). Similarly, Nietzsche goes\nout of his way to show that Christian views of female sexuality\ncompare unfavorably with Manu views (A 56).\n\nThe most balanced and careful defense of the Aristocratic Politics\nView, Detwiler (1990), is not able to adduce much additional evidence.\nFor example, Detwiler (1990) ends up relying quite heavily on an essay\nthe 27-year-old Nietzsche never published (1990: 39\u201341, 63). As to\npassages in the \u201cmature\u201d corpus, Detwiler adduces ones\nthat \u201cappear[\u00a0] to have explicit political\nimplications\u201d (1990: 43; cf. 44), or that \u201cstrongly\nsuggest\u2026political consequences\u201d (1990: 45\u201346), or\nthat \u201craise the issue of troubling political implications of\nNietzschean immoralism\u201d (1990: 49). But\n\u201cimplications\u201d and \u201cconsequences\u201d are one\nthing, and having a political philosophy another. (See in this regard\nthe discussion of BGE 257 in Huddleston 2019: 113 n. 39). The canon of\npolitical philosophers is composed of thinkers (like Hobbes, Locke,\nRousseau, and Mill) who have philosophical views about political\nquestions \u2014 the justification of state power, the liberty of the\nindividual, political legitimacy, etc. \u2014 not thinkers whose\nviews about other topics merely had\n\u201cimplications\u201d for politics. As the conscientious Detwiler\nadmits: \u201c[t]he political implications of Nietzsche\u2019s\nrevaluation of values are never center stage for long\u201d (1990:\n58).\n\nYet it is natural to think that Nietzsche\u2019s attack on morality\ndoes indeed have real political implications. When Nietzsche commends\nthe laws of Manu for \u201cmak[ing] possible the higher and the\nhighest types\u201d (A 57), this resonates, all too obviously, with\nNietzsche\u2019s central concern that morality is harmful to the\nhighest types of human beings. Yet the undeniable\n\u201cresonance\u201d fails to show that Nietzsche endorses\nthe laws of Manu. Most obviously, the \u201chigher types\u201d\nprotected by the laws of Manu \u2014 essentially a priestly caste\n\u2014 have nothing in common with the nascent Goethes that concern\nNietzsche. Nietzsche\u2019s worry for these potential higher types\nis, as we have seen, that they suffer from false\nconsciousness, i.e., the false belief that \u201cmorality in the\npejorative sense,\u201d i.e., MPS, is good for them. MPS is a threat\nto the flourishing of nascent Goethes, and it is this flourishing that\ninterests Nietzsche above all. It would suffice for Nietzsche\u2019s\npurposes that nascent Goethes give up their faith in MPS \u2014 in\nother words, it is individual attitudes not political structures that\nare Nietzsche\u2019s primary object (\u201cThe ideas of the herd\nshould rule in the herd,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201cand not reach\nout beyond it\u201d [WP 287]). That should hardly be surprising if we\nrecall Nietzsche\u2019s sustained hostility to politics throughout\nhis career, as defenders of the Anti-Politics View emphasize.\n\nEven in the early Untimely Meditations, this hostility is\nalready evident. So, for example, Nietzsche comments:\n\nEvery philosophy which believes that the problem of existence is\ntouched on, not to say solved, by a political event is a joke- and\npseudo-philosophy. Many states have been founded since the world\nbegan; that is an old story. How should a political innovation suffice\nto turn men once and for all into contented inhabitants of the earth?\n[That people think the answer to existential questions might come from\npolitics shows] that we are experiencing the consequences of the\ndoctrine\u2026that the state is the highest goal of mankind and that\na man has no higher duty than to serve the state: in which doctrine I\nrecognize a relapse not into paganism but into stupidity. It may be\nthat a man who sees his highest duty in serving the state really knows\nno higher duties; but there are men and duties existing beyond this\n\u2014 and one of the duties that seems, at least to me, to be higher\nthan serving the state demands that one destroys stupidity in every\nform, and therefore in this form too. That is why I am concerned with\na species of man whose teleology extends somewhat beyond the welfare\nof a state\u2026, and with [this kind of man] only in relation to a\nworld which is again fairly independent of the welfare of a state,\nthat of culture. (U III:4)\n\n\nThe same, vaguely anarchistic attitude is apparent in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, where Nietzsche calls the \u201cstate\u2026the\ncoldest of all cold monsters\u201d and remarks, aptly enough, that\n\u201cthe state\u2026whatever it says it lies\u2026Everything\nabout it is false\u201d (Z I:11). \u201cOnly where the state ends,\nthere begins the human being who is not superfluous\u201d (Z I:11) Of\ncourse, it is only the latter individual that really\ninterests Nietzsche. And who is that individual? The next section (Z\nI:12) tells us: he is the one who values his \u201csolitude,\u201d\nwhich is precisely what the \u201cmarketplace\u201d of politics\nviolates, with its \u201cshowmen and actors of great [sic]\nthings.\u201d \u201cFar from the market place and from fame happens\nall that is great\u201d (Z I:12): in other words, great things (and\ngreat people) are to be found far from the realms of politics and\neconomics.\n\nPassages like these seem to support the Anti-Politics View. On this\naccount, Nietzsche occasionally expresses views about political\nmatters, but, read in context, they do not add up to a theoretical\naccount of any of the questions of political philosophy. He is more\naccurately read, in the end, as a kind of esoteric moralist,\ni.e., someone who has views about human flourishing, views he wants to\ncommunicate at least to a select few. \u201cThis book belongs to the\nvery few,\u201d he says of The Antichrist, though the point\nholds more generally. Indeed, Nietzsche is clearly describing his own\nwork when he writes in an earlier book that,\n\nIt is not by any means necessarily an objection to a book when anyone\nfinds it impossible to understand: perhaps that was part of the\nauthor\u2019s intention \u2014 he did not want to be understood by\njust \u2018anybody.\u2019 All the nobler spirits and tastes select\ntheir audience when they wish to communicate; and choosing that, one\nat the same time erects barriers against \u2018the others.\u2019 All\nthe more subtle laws of any style have their origin at this point:\nthey at the same time keep away, create a distance, forbid\n\u2018entrance,\u2019 understanding, as said above \u2014 while\nthey open the ears of those whose ears are related to ours. (GS 381)\n\n\nOr similarly: \u201cOur highest insights must \u2014 and should\n\u2014 sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are\nheard without permission by those who are not predisposed and\npredestined for them\u201d (BGE 30). Nietzsche, the esoteric\nmoralist, wants to reach only select individuals \u2014 those nascent\nhigher human beings who are \u201cpredisposed and predestined\u201d\nfor his ideas \u2014 and alter their consciousness about morality.\nThe larger world, including its forms of political and economic\norganization, is simply not his concern.\n\nEven without a political philosophy, however, there remain disturbing\nquestions about Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality and its\npolitical implications. For example, when Nietzsche objects\nthat morality is an obstacle to \u201cthe highest power and splendor\npossible\u201d to man, one is tempted to object that this gets things\nperversely backwards. For surely it is the lack of morality\nin social policy and public institutions \u2014 a lack which permits\nwidespread poverty and despair to persist generation upon generation;\nthat allows daily economic struggle and uncertainty to define the\nbasic character of most people\u2019s lives \u2014 that is most\nresponsible for a lack of human flourishing. Surely, in a more moral\nsociety, with a genuine commitment to social justice and human\nequality, there would be far more Goethes, far more creativity and\nadmirable human achievement. As Philippa Foot has sharply put it:\n\u201cHow could one see the present dangers that the world is in as\nshowing that there is too much pity and too little egoism\naround?\u201d (1973, p. 168).\n\nHere, though, one must remember the earlier discussion of\nNietzsche\u2019s critique of morality. Consider the Nietzsche who\nasks: \u201cWhere has the last feeling of decency and self-respect\ngone when even our statesmen, an otherwise quite unembarrassed type of\nman, anti-Christians through and through in their deeds, still call\nthemselves Christians today and attend communion?\u201d (A 38).\nClearly this Nietzsche is under no illusions about the extent to which\npublic actors do not act morally. Indeed, Nietzsche continues in even\nmore explicit terms: \u201cEvery practice of every moment, every\ninstinct, every valuation that is translated into action is\ntoday anti-Christian: what a miscarriage of falseness must\nmodern man be, that he is not ashamed to be called a\nChristian in spite of all this!\u201d (A 38). What, then, is going on\nhere? If Nietzsche is not, contrary to Foot\u2019s suggestion,\nembracing the absurd view that there is too much pity and altruism in\nthe world, what exactly is his critical point?\n\nRecall Nietzsche\u2019s paradigmatic worry: that a nascent creative\ngenius will come to take the norms of MPS so seriously that he will\nfail to realize his genius. Rather than tolerate (even welcome)\nsuffering, he will seek relief from hardship and devote himself to the\npursuit of pleasure; rather than practice what Nietzsche calls\n\u201csevere self-love\u201d, and attend to himself in the ways\nrequisite for productive creative work, he will embrace the ideology\nof altruism, and reject \u201cself-love\u201d as improper, and so\nforth. It is not, then, that Nietzsche thinks people practice\ntoo much altruism \u2014 after all, Nietzsche tells us that egoistic\nactions \u201chave hitherto been by far the most frequent\nactions\u201d (D 148) \u2014 but rather that they believe\ntoo much in the value of altruism, equality, happiness and the other\nnorms of MPS. Even though there is neither much altruism nor equality\nin the world, there is almost universal endorsement of the\nvalue of altruism and equality \u2014 even, notoriously (and\nas Nietzsche seemed well aware), by those who are its worst enemies in\npractice. So Nietzsche\u2019s critique is that a culture in the grips\nof MPS, even without acting on MPS, poses the real obstacle to\nflourishing, because it teaches potential higher types to disvalue\nwhat would be most conducive to their creativity and value what is\nirrelevant or perhaps even hostile to it. Nietzsche\u2019s worry, in\nshort, is that the man in the grips of MPS becomes\n\u201cimprisoned among all sorts of terrible concepts\n[schrekliche Begriffe]\u201d that leave him \u201csick,\nmiserable, malevolent against himself: full of hatred against the\nsprings of life, full of suspicion against all that was still strong\nand happy\u201d (TI VII:2, emphasis added).\n\nSo, contrary to Foot, Nietzsche is not claiming that people are\nactually too altruistic and too egalitarian in their\npractice; he is worried that (as a consequence of the slave revolt in\nmorals, etc.) they are now \u201cimprisoned\namong\u2026.concepts\u201d of equality and altruism, and that this\nconceptual vocabulary of value is itself the obstacle to the\nrealization of certain forms of human excellence. That is a very\ndifferent charge, one that raises subtle psychological questions that\nno one, to date, has really explored.\n\nTo be sure, one might still object that if our society really\nwere more altruistic and egalitarian, more individuals would have the\nchance to flourish and do creative work. Yet it is precisely this\nmoral optimism common, for example, to utilitarians and Marxists\n\u2014 this belief that a more moral society would produce more\nopportunity for more people to do creative work \u2014 that Nietzsche\ndoes, indeed, want to question. Nietzsche\u2019s illiberal attitudes\nin this regard are once again apparent; he says \u2014 to take but\none example \u2014 that, \u201cWe simply do not consider it\ndesirable that a realm of justice and harmony [Eintracht]\nshould be established on earth\u201d (GS 377). It is bad enough for\nNietzsche that MPS values have so far succeeded in saying,\n\u201cstubbornly and inexorably, \u2018I am morality itself, and\nnothing besides is morality\u2019\u201d (BGE 202); it could only be\nworse on his view if more and more of our actions were really brought\ninto accord with these values. For Nietzsche wants to urge \u2014\ncontrary to the moral optimists \u2014 that in a way largely\nunappreciated and (perhaps) unintended a thoroughly moral\nculture undermines the conditions under which the most splendid human\ncreativity is possible, and generates instead a society of\nZarathustra\u2019s \u201clast men\u201d (Z P:5):\n\n\u201cWhat is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a\nstar?\u201d thus asks the last man, and he blinks.\n\n\nThe earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes\neverything small. His race is as in eradicable as the flea-beetle; the\nlast man lives longest.\n\n\u201cWe have invented happiness,\u201d say the last men, and they\nblink\u2026.\n\n\nIf we are trained always to think of happiness and comfort and safety\nand the needs of others, we shall cut ourselves off from the\npreconditions for creative excellence on the Nietzschean picture:\nsuffering, hardship, danger, self-concern, and the rest.\n\nConsider a particularly powerful statement of this view. Speaking of\nthose \u201celoquent and profoundly scribbling slaves of the\ndemocratic taste and its \u2018modern ideas\u2019\u201d who seek to\npromote \u201cthe universal green-pasture happiness of the\nherd\u201d and who take \u201csuffering itself\u2026for something\nthat must be abolished\u201d (BGE 44), Nietzsche retorts that when we\nlook at,\n\n\u2026how the plant \u201cman\u201d has so far grown most\nvigorously to a height \u2014 we think that this has happened every\ntime under the opposite conditions, that to this end the dangerousness\nof his situation must first grow to the point of enormity, his power\nof invention and simulation (his \u201cspirit\u201d) had to develop\nunder prolonged pressure and constraint into refinement and\naudacity\u2026. We think that\u2026everything evil, terrible,\ntyrannical in man, everything in him that is kin to beasts of prey and\nserpents, serves the enhancement of the species \u201cman\u201d as\nmuch as its opposite does. Indeed, we do not even say enough when we\nsay only that much. (BGE 44)\n\n\nAt the end of this passage, Nietzsche does hint at a role for morality\nas well \u2014 it is just that what morality opposes is equally\nimportant. He, of course, qualifies this by suggesting that even to\nconcede their equal importance may \u201cnot even say enough\u201d:\nthat is, perhaps there will not be much role for morality at all in\nthe conditions under which \u201cthe plant \u2018man\u2019\u201d\nwill grow to its greatest heights. But notice that, even in this\npassage, what is called for is not a political\ntransformation, but an individual one, that of the nascent\nhigher human being: it is \u201chis situation\u201d that\n\u201cmust first grow to the point of enormity\u201d and it is\n\u201chis power of invention and simulation\u201d that\n\u201chad to develop under prolonged pressure and constraint into\nrefinement and audacity.\u201d As he writes in a Nachlass\nnote of 1887, regarding those \u201chuman beings who are of any\nconcern to me\u201d: \u201cI wish [them] suffering, desolation,\nsickness, ill-treatment, indignities \u2014 I wish that they should\nnot remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of\nself-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished\u201d (WP 910).\nThis is not the outline of a political program, but rather a severe\nregimen for the realization of individual potential \u2014 at least\nfor the select few.\n",
