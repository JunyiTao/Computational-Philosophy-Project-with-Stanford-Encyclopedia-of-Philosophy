    "main_text": "The Significance of Past Wrongdoing || Surviving Duties\n5.4 Surviving Duties\n\nThe considerations of\n section 5.1\n and\n section 5.2\n suggest that currently living and future people can have a just claim\nto compensation owing to what was done to others in the past. If so,\ncurrently living people ought to attempt to counteract the negative\nimpact of past wrongs for the well-being of current and future people.\nHowever, one could argue that such an interpretation of the relevance\nof past injustices is incomplete when understood as a statement of how\nwe ought to respond to the fact that past people were severely\nwronged. To many it is intuitively plausible that present generations\ncan have duties to dead victims owing to the wrongs committed against\nthem (by others) in the past. The moral significance of past wrongs\ndoes not exclusively lie in their impact on present and future\npeople\u2019s well-being; rather, the significance of past wrongs is\nalso to be seen in the fact that past people were\nvictims of these injustices. If this intuition can be defended, we\nhave duties to past generations that are grounded in past deeds. This\nwould imply that at least some aspects of historical injustice cannot\nbe accounted for by an historically informed theory of justice between\ncontemporaries (or between contemporaries and future people).\n\nTo attribute rights to dead people may seem unproblematic if we assume\nthat people continue to exist after their physical death and that they\nmay be affected by (and affect) events of this world. These\nassumptions about the ontological status of previously living people\nare, however, at least as controversial as their converse (see Mulgan\n1999: 54\u201355). Assuming that dead people cannot be bearers of\ninterests or rights and thus that those presently alive can neither\nharm nor wrong dead people, Joel Feinberg and others have discussed\ntwo alternative interpretations of posthumous harm (Boonin 2019). Both\npositions are compatible with the hypothesis that \n\n(A) \neither the deceased do not exist (a1) or, if they do exist, there\nis no connection between them and those currently alive (a2). \n\n\nAccording to the first interpretation, present generations can be said\nto owe something to surviving interests as such\u2014that is, to\ninterests that the deceased had, while alive, with respect to future\nposthumous states of affairs. However, while we have reasons to care\nabout individual people, it is not clear that we have reasons to care\nabout interests as such. According to the second (re-)interpretation\n(see Feinberg 1974 [1980]; Feinberg 1977: 301\u2013302), the\nsignificance of posthumous events is fully accounted for by the harm\nthat these events cause a person during her life. However, this\ninterpretation is not an interpretation of posthumous harm as such but\nof harm to living people that is caused by posthumous events.\nArguably, this position is not compatible with our normal\nunderstanding of the significance of posthumous events (see Gosseries\n2004: ch. iv, sects. 4\u20135).\n\nA fourth position, the position of surviving duties, is compatible\nwith presupposition (A) and does not rely on any of the criticized\nviews (see Wellman 1995: 155\u2013157; Meyer 2005: chs. 4 and 5;\nScheffler 2013: esp. 42\u201343, 52\u201353). The position of\nsurviving duties relies upon the following claims: Some rights are\nfuture-oriented in the sense that they impose duties in the future.\nSuch rights can impose surviving duties; they imply duties that are\n(also) binding after the death of the bearer of the right if the\nappropriate bearer of the duty is identified. According to this\nposition, duties survive the death of the bearer of the right. While\nthe bearer of the right no longer exists, currently living people can\nstand under the correlative duties. The notion of surviving duties\nrelies on the idea that the reasons for a person\u2019s right imply\nreasons for a correlative duty under which other people may stand even\nafter the death of the bearer of the right. If it is a moral right,\nthen these reasons will also include general social reasons which are\nrelevant not only for the bearer of the right but also for the\nbearer(s) of the surviving duty, his contemporaries (and future\npeople). For example, we all have reasons to protect people\u2019s\ntrust that promises be kept and that people have the reputation they\ndeserve. The reasons for the surviving duties also include the reasons\nthat are necessary for showing that a particular person had the moral\nright.\n\nThe idea of surviving duties rests neither on the claim that deceased\npeople can be bearers of interests or rights (contrary to the first\nposition), nor on the claim that we have reason to care about\ninterests that have no current bearers (contrary to the second\nposition). The position of surviving duties does not reject the notion\nthat currently living people can be harmed by what are to them\nposthumous events (for example, when people learn shortly before their\ndeath that a project that they deeply care about is doomed to\nfailure). However, the position of surviving duties is meant to answer\na different question, namely, whether present generations can be said\nto owe something to dead people and, in particular, to those who were\nvictims of past injustices.\n\nOne might wonder whether this interpretation of surviving duties is\ncompatible with the presupposition that dead people are bearers of\nneither interests nor rights and that they cannot be affected by the\nactions of present persons. At the very least, the position of\nsurviving duties as delineated presupposes the possibility of the\nattribution of posthumous properties and, more particularly, of their\nchange\u2014an assumption that has been defended as rather\nunproblematic (see Ruben 1988: 223\u2013231).\n",
