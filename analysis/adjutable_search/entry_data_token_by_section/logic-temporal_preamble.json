    "main_text": "\n\nThe term Temporal Logic has been broadly used to cover all\napproaches to reasoning about time and temporal information, as well as their formal representation, within a logical framework, and also more narrowly to refer specifically to the modal-logic type of approach introduced around 1960 by Arthur Prior under the name Tense Logic and subsequently developed further by many logicians and computer\nscientists. Applications of Temporal Logic include its use as a\nformalism for clarifying philosophical issues about time, as a\nframework within which to define the semantics of temporal expressions\nin natural language, as a language for encoding temporal knowledge in\nartificial intelligence, and as a tool for specification, formal\nanalysis, and verification of the executions of computer programs and\nsystems.\n\nHere we provide a broadly representative, yet concise and inevitably\nincomplete, overview of the rich variety of temporal models and logics\nintroduced and studied over the past 50 years.\n",
