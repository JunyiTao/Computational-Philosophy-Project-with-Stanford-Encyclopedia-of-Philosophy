    "main_text": "\n\nIndividuals, organizations and governments value and protect medical\nprivacy (Francis and Francis 2017; Beauchamp and Childress 2008;\nHumber and Almeder 2001; Englehardt 2000b). As a general rule, they\nstrive to (1) restrict and secure what they deem to be sensitive\nmedical information and biospecimens, (2) respect medically-related\ndecisions by individuals and families and (3) honor community and\nlegal expectations of privacy (Francis 2017; Winslade 2014). For more\nthan fifty years, philosophers and bioethicists have taken a keen\ninterest in privacy issues. They have contributed to an expanding\nliterature, some with practical applications, consisting of diverse\nperspectives on how privacy concepts and values are implicated in\npatient care and biomedical research (Presidential Commission\n2012).\n\nThe scope of this entry is \u201cprivacy\u201d in the several varied\nand popular uses of the term employed in medicine and health research,\nincluding the controversial uses debated by philosophers. Most\ncontemporary discussions of privacy and medicine concern the\ninformational privacy of patients and research subjects, treated in\nSection 1, below. Medical record confidentiality is a frequent focus.\nThis emphasis is neither surprising nor inappropriate given the\nproblems, priorities and preoccupations of the digital age. Not to be\noverlooked, and covered here in Sections 2 and 5, philosophic\ndiscussion has extended beyond informational privacy, engaging the\nprivacy implications of observing, touching and choosing for oneself\nin medical practice. These forms of privacy are sometimes referred to\nas physical and decisional privacy. Associational and proprietary\nconcepts of privacy found in health-related dicussions and recognized\nby some philosophers are also briefly treated in below in Sections 3\nand 4. \n\nThis entry principally deals with the professional work of physicians,\nnurses and other trained and licensed medical caregivers, along with\nhospitals, insurance companies and researchers. Privacy in relation to\nwellness and well-being are beyond the scope of this entry, except to\nthe considerable extent that it prompts encounters with medical\nprofessionals and organizations.  Wellness encounters with spiritual,\nfitness or non-medical beauty professionals are not\ndiscussed. Finally, while the privacy of patients and biomedical\nresearch subjects is the focus of this entry, philosophical questions\nconcerning health professionals\u2019 own privacy-related interests\nimplicated in medical practice are recognized.\n",
