Russell\u2019s Philosophical Method and the Notion of Analysis\n\n Although Russell changed his mind on a great number of philosophical\nissues throughout his career, one of the most stable elements in his\nviews is the endorsement of a certain methodology for approaching\nphilosophy. Indeed, it could be argued to be the most continuous and\nunifying feature of Russell\u2019s philosophical work (e.g., see Hager\n1994).  Russell employed the methodology self-consciously, and gave\nonly slightly differing descriptions of this methodology in works\nthroughout his career (see, esp., EFG,\n14\u201315; POM, 1\u20132, 129\u201330; RMDP,\n272\u201374; PM, 59; IPL,\n284\u201385; TK, 33, 158\u201359; OKEW,\n144\u201345; PLA, 178\u201382, 270\u201371; IMP,\n1\u20132; LA, 324\u201336, 341;\nRTC, 687; HWP, 788\u201389; HK, 257\u201359;\nMPD, 98\u201399, 162\u2013163). Understanding this methodology is\nparticularly important for understanding his logical atomism, as well\nas what he meant by \u201canalysis\u201d.\n\n The methodology consists of a two phase process. The first phase is\ndubbed the \u201canalytic\u201d phase (although it should be noted that\nsometimes Russell used the word \u201canalysis\u201d for the whole\nprocedure). One begins with a certain theory, doctrine or collection\nof beliefs which is taken to be more or less correct, but is taken to\nbe in certain regards vague, imprecise, disunified, overly complex or\nin some other way confused or puzzling. The aim in the first phase is\nto work backwards from these beliefs, taken as a kind of \u201cdata\u201d, to a\ncertain minimal stock of undefined concepts and general principles\nwhich might be thought to underlie the original body of knowledge. The\nsecond phase, which Russell described as the \u201cconstructive\u201d or\n\u201csynthetic\u201d phase, consists in rebuilding or reconstructing the\noriginal body of knowledge in terms of the results of the first phase.\nMore specifically, in the synthetic phase, one defines those elements\nof the original conceptual framework and vocabulary of the discipline\nin terms of the \u201cminimum vocabulary\u201d identified in the first phrase,\nand derives or deduces the main tenets of the original theory from the\nbasic principles or general truths one arrives at after analysis. \n\n \nAs a result of such a process, the system of beliefs with which one\nbegan takes on a new form in which connections between various\nconcepts it uses are made clear, the logical interrelations between\nvarious theses of the theory are clarified, and vague or unclear\naspects of the original terminology are eliminated.  Moreover, the\nprocedure also provides opportunities for the application of Occam\u2019s\nrazor, as it calls for the elimination of unnecessary or redundant\naspects of a theory. Concepts or assumptions giving rise to paradoxes\nor conundrums or other problems within a theory are often found to be\nwholly unnecessary or capable of being supplanted by something less\nproblematic.  Another advantage is that the procedure arranges its\nresults as a deductive system, and hence invites and facilitates the\ndiscovery of new results.\n\n\n \nExamples of this general procedure can be found throughout Russell\u2019s\nwritings, and Russell also credits others with having achieved similar\nsuccesses.  Russell\u2019s work in mathematical logic provides perhaps the\nmost obvious example of his utilization of such a procedure. It is\nalso an excellent example of Russell\u2019s contention that analysis\nproceeds in stages. Russell saw his own work as the next step in a\nseries of successes beginning with the work of Cantor, Dedekind and\nWeierstrass. Prior to the work of these figures, mathematics employed\na number of concepts, number, magnitude, series,\nlimit, infinity, function, continuity, etc.,\nwithout a full understanding of the precise definition of each\nconcept, nor how they related to one another. By introducing precise\ndefinitions of such notions, these thinkers exposed ambiguities (e.g.,\nsuch as with the word \u201cinfinite\u201d), revealed interrelations between\ncertain of them, and eliminated dubious notions that had previously\ncaused confusion and paradoxes (such as those involved with the notion\nof an \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d). Russell saw the next step forward in the\nanalysis of mathematics in the work of Peano and his associates, who\nnot only attempted to explain how many mathematical notions could be\n\u201carithmetized\u201d, i.e., defined and proven in terms of arithmetic, but\nhad also identified, in the case of arithmetic, three basic concepts\n(zero, successor, and natural number) and\nfive basic principles (the so-called \u201cPeano axioms\u201d), from which the\nrest of arithmetic was thought to be derivable.\n\n \nRussell described the next advance as taking place in the work of\nFrege. According to the conception of number found in Frege\u2019s\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, a number can be regarded as an\nequivalence class consisting of those classes whose members can be put\nin 1-1 correspondence with any other member of the class. According to\nRussell, this conception allowed the primitives of Peano\u2019s analysis to\nbe defined fully in terms of the notion of a class, along with other\nlogical notions such as identity, quantification, negation and the\nconditional. Similarly, Frege\u2019s work showed how the basic principles\nof Peano\u2019s analysis could be derived from logical axioms\nalone. However, Frege\u2019s analysis was not in all ways successful, as\nthe notion of a class or the extension of a concept which Frege\nincluded as a logically primitive notion lead to certain\ncontradictions. In this regard, Russell saw his own analysis of\nmathematics (largely developed independently from Frege) as an\nimprovement, with its more austere analysis that eliminates even the\nnotion of a class as a primitive idea (see the discussion of classes\nin Section 2.4 above), and thereby eliminates the contradictions (see,\ne.g., RMDP, 276\u201381; LA, 325\u201327).\n\n \nIt was clearly a part of Russell\u2019s view that in conducting an\nanalysis of a domain such as mathematics, and reducing its primitive\nconceptual apparatus and unproven premises to a minimum, one is not\nmerely reducing the vocabulary of a certain theory, but also showing a\nway of reducing the metaphysical commitments of the theory. In first\nshowing that numbers such as 1, 2, etc., could be defined in terms of\nclasses of like cardinality, and then showing how apparent discourse\nabout \u201cclasses\u201d could be replaced by higher-order\nquantification, Russell made it possible to see how it is that there\ncould be truths of arithmetic without presupposing that the numbers\nconstitute a special category of abstract entity. Numbers are placed\nin the category of \u201clogical fictions\u201d or \u201clogical\nconstructions\u201d along with all other classes.\n\n \nRussell\u2019s work from the period after the publication of Principia\nMathematica of 1910 shows applications of this general\nphilosophical approach to non-mathematical domains. In particular, his\nwork over the next two decades shows concern with the attempt to provide\nanalyses of the notions of knowledge, space, time, experience, matter\nand causation. When Russell applied his analytic methodology to\nsciences such as physics, again the goal was to arrive at a\n\u201cminimum vocabulary\u201d required for the science in question,\nas well as a set of basic premises and general truths from which the\nrest of the science can be derived. We cannot delve into all the\ndetails of Russell\u2019s evolving analyses here. However, according to the\nviews developed by Russell in the mid-1910s, many of the fundamental\nnotions in physics were thought to be analyzable in terms of\nparticular sensations: i.e., bits of color, auditory notes, or other\nsimple parts of sensation, and their qualities and relations. Russell\ncalled such sensations, when actually experienced,\n\u201csense\u201d. In particular, Russell believed that the notion\nof a \u201cphysical thing\u201d could be replaced, or analyzed in\nterms of, the notion of a series of classes of sensible particulars\neach bearing to one another certain relations of continuity,\nresemblance, and perhaps certain other relations relevant to the\nformulation of the laws of physics (OKEW, 86ff;\nRSDP, 114\u201315; UCM, 105). Other physical\nnotions such as that of a point of space, or an instance of time,\ncould be conceived in terms of classes of sensible particulars and\ntheir spatial and temporal relations (see TK,\n77; OKEW, 91\u201399). Later, after abandoning the view that\nperception is fundamentally relational, and accepting a form of\nWilliam James\u2019s neutral monism, Russell similarly came to believe that\nthe notion of a conscious mind could be analyzed in terms of various\npercepts, experiences and sensations related to each other by\npsychological laws (AMi chaps. 1, 5; OOP chap.  26;\ncf. PLA, 277ff). Hence, Russell came to the view that words\nas \u201cpoint\u201d, \u201cmatter\u201d,\u201cinstant\u201d,\n\u201cmind\u201d, and the like could be discarded from the minimum\nvocabulary needed for physics or psychology. Instead, such words could\nbe systematically translated into a language only containing words\nrepresenting certain qualities and relations between sensible\nparticulars.\n\n \nThroughout these analyses, Russell put into practice a slogan he\nstated as follows: \u201cWherever possible, logical constructions are\nto be substituted for inferred entities\u201d (RSDP, 115;\ncf. LA, 326). Rival philosophies that postulate an\nego or mind as an entity distinct from its mental\nstates involve inferring the existence of an entity that cannot\ndirectly be found in experience. Something similar can be said about\nphilosophies that take matter to be an entity distinct from sensible\nappearances, lying behind them and inferred from them. Combining\nRussell\u2019s suggestions that talk of \u201cminds\u201d or \u201cphysical objects\u201d is to\nbe analyzed in terms of classes of sensible particulars with his\ngeneral view that classes are \u201clogical fictions\u201d, results in the view\nthat minds and physical objects too are \u201clogical fictions\u201d, or not\nparts of the basic building blocks of reality. Instead, all truths\nabout such purported entities turn out instead to be analyzable as\ntruths about sensible particulars and their relations to one\nanother. This is in keeping with the general metaphysical outlook of\nlogical atomism. We also have here a fairly severe application of\nOccam\u2019s razor. The slogan was applied within his analyses in\nmathematics as well. Noting that sometimes a series of rational\nnumbers converges towards a limit which is not itself specifiable as a\nrational, some philosophers of mathematics thought that one should\npostulate an irrational number as a limit. Russell claimed\nthat rather than postulating entities in such a case, an\nirrational number should simply be defined as a class of\nrational numbers without a rational upper bound. Russell preferred to\nreconstruct talk of irrationals this way rather than infer or\npostulate the existence of a new species of mathematical\nentity not already known to exist, complaining that the method of\n\u201cpostulating\u201d what we want has \u201cthe advantages of theft over honest\ntoil\u201d (IMP, 71).\n\n \nIn conducting an analysis of mathematics, or indeed, of any other\ndomain of thought, Russell was clear that although the results of\nanalysis can be regarded as logical premises from which the\noriginal body of knowledge can in principle be derived,\nepistemologically speaking, the pre-analyzed beliefs are more\nfundamental. For example, in mathematics, a belief such as \u201c2 + 2 = 4\u201d\nis epistemologically more certain, and psychologically easier to\nunderstand and accept, than many of the logical premises from which it\nis derived. Indeed, Russell believed that the results obtained through\nthe process of analysis obtain their epistemic warrant inductively\nfrom the evident truth of their logical consequences (see, e.g.,\nTK, 158\u201359). As Russell put it, \u201c[t]he reason for\naccepting an axiom, as for accepting any other proposition, is always\nlargely inductive, namely that many propositions which are nearly\nindubitable can be deduced from it, and that no equally plausible way\nis known by which these propositions could be true if the axiom were\nfalse, and nothing which is plausibly false can be deduced from it\u201d\n(PM, 59; cf. RMDP, 282). It is perhaps for these\nreasons that Russell believed that the process of philosophical\nanalysis should always begin with beliefs the truth of which are not\nin question, i.e., which are \u201cnearly indubitable\u201d. \n\n \nWhen Russell spoke about the general philosophical methodology\ndescribed here, he usually had in mind applying the process of\nanalysis to an entire body of knowledge or set of data. In fact,\nRussell advocated usually to begin with the uncontroversial doctrine\nof a certain science, such as mathematics or physics, largely because\nhe held that these theories are the most likely to be true, or at\nleast nearly true, and hence make the most appropriate place to begin\nthe process of analysis. \n\n \nRussell did on occasion also speak of analyzing a particular\nproposition of ordinary life. One example he gave is \u201cThere are a\nnumber of people in this room at this moment\u201d (PLA, 179). In\nthis case, the truth or falsity of this statement may seem obvious,\nbut exactly what its truth would involve is rather obscure. The\nprocess of analysis in this case would consist in attempting to make\nthe proposition clear by defining what it is for something to be a\nroom, for something to be a person, for a person to be in a room, what\na moment is, etc. In this case, it might seem that the ordinary\nlanguage statement is sufficiently vague that there is likely no\none precise or unambiguous proposition that represents the\n\u201ccorrect analysis\u201d of the proposition. In a sense this is right;\nhowever, this does not mean that analysis would be worthless. Russell\nwas explicit that the goal of analysis is not to unpack what is\npsychologically intended by an ordinary statement such as the previous\nexample, nor what a person would be thinking when he or she utters\nit. The point rather is simply to begin with a certain obvious, but\nrough and vague statement, and find a replacement for it in a more\nprecise, unified, and minimal idiom (see, e.g., PLA, 180,\n189). \n\n On Russell\u2019s view, vagueness is a feature of language, not of the\nworld. In vague language, there is no one-one relation between\npropositions and facts, so that a vague statement could be considered\nverified by any one of a range of different facts (Vag,\n217). However, in a properly analyzed proposition, there is a clear\nisomorphism between the structure of the proposition and the structure\nof the fact that would make it true (PLA, 197); hence a\nprecise and analyzed proposition is capable of being true in one and\nonly one way (Vag, 219). In analyzing a proposition such as\n\u201cthere are a number of people in this room at this moment\u201d, one might\nobtain a precise statement which would require for its truth that\nthere is a certain class of sensible particulars related to each other\nin a very definite way constituting the presence of a room, and\ncertain other classes of sensible particulars related to each other in\nways constituting people, and that the sensible particulars in the\nlatter classes bear certain definite relations to those in the first\nclass of particulars.  Obviously, nothing like this is clearly in the\nmind of a person who would ordinarily use the original English\nexpression. It is clear to see in this case that a very specific state\nof things is required for the truth of the analyzed proposition, and\nhence the truth of it will be far more doubtful than the truth of the\nvague assertion with which one began the process (PLA,\n179\u201380). As Russell put the point, \u201cthe point of philosophy is to\nstart with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to\nend with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it\u201d\n(PLA, 193). \n",
