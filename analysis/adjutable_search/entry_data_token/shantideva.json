Biography: History and Legends\n\nThere is very little historically reliable information available about\nthe life of \u015a\u0101ntideva. The Tibetan historians But\u00f6n and\nTaran\u0101tha tell us that \u015a\u0101ntideva was a prince from\nSaur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, a western coastal region that now forms\npart of the Indian state of Gujarat. But royal birth was a standard\nfeature of Indian Buddhist hagiographies, possibly because the\nhistorical Buddha himself was the son of a r\u0101ja, so there is some\nreason to be skeptical of this aspect of his biography. \n\nScholars of Indian history before the second millennium are often\nfrustrated by our lack of reliable and precise chronological\ninformation; and so it is for the dates of \u015a\u0101ntideva. One\ncrucial piece of information we do have is that another Indian author,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, quotes a passage from\n\u015a\u0101ntideva in a text that must have been composed by 763 CE.\nWe may conclude that \u015a\u0101ntideva must have lived and written\nbefore that date, and so that his life would likely have occurred in\nthe late seventh to the mid-eighth centuries CE. This was a period\nduring which Buddhism was still quite popular in North India, but had\nentered a phase of decline from which it would not be able to recover.\nNevertheless, highly original and valuable intellectual and spiritual\ndevelopments continued to occur within the Buddhist tradition at this\ntime. \n\nTwo major works are unanimously attributed to \u015a\u0101ntideva. The\nmost widely read is his great philosophical poem, the\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra (often abbreviated as\nBCA). This text immensely popular in Tibet; His Holiness the\nDalai Lama describes it as his favorite religious work, and numerous\nTibetan religious rituals quote from, or are influenced by, the\nBCA. Moreover, the work appears to have had a significant\nimpact on the now-extinct Buddhist tradition of Indonesia. The\nBCA has been translated into several modern languages,\nincluding Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, German, Hindi, Newari, and\nSpanish, for a total of at least twenty-seven contemporary\ntranslations (as surveyed by G\u00f3mez 1999: 4\u20135). Of the\nEnglish translations, Wallace and Wallace (1997) is notable for its\naccuracy and precision and Crosby and Skilton (1995, henceforth\nC&S) for its beauty and clarity.\n\nLess famous than the BCA, but almost as valuable and\nintellectually rich, is the \u015aik\u1e63\u0101-samuccaya\n(henceforth \u015aS), an anthology of quotations from the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras with commentary by \u015a\u0101ntideva.\nThis text contains a number of passages of ethical and philosophical\ninterest in \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s own voice, as well as numerous\nbeautiful and moving poems and a wide variety of scriptural materials\ndrawn from over a hundred s\u016btras. The \u015aS contains\ninstructions for how to behave while begging for food and while doing\nwork assignments in the monastery; it is thus an important witness to\nthe daily life of Indian Buddhist monks in the first millennium CE.\nTextual scholars have often relied on the \u015aS as a\ncrucial source, as it preserves passages in Sanskrit from dozens of\ns\u016btras that have been lost in their original language and are\npreserved, if at all, only in translation into such languages as\nTibetan and Chinese. The \u015aS was translated into Chinese,\nbut appears not to have been read very often in that language; its\nmain influence was in Tibet. There are two complete translations of\nthe \u015aS into English (Bendall & Rouse 1922, and in\nSS-G), as well as a very precise and careful translation limited to\nthe verses by \u015a\u0101ntideva that appear in the text (Harrison\n2013).\n\nTwo major versions of the BCA exist and were known in Tibet,\none much shorter than the other. It was the longer version, of about a\nthousand verses, that was regarded as canonical in Tibet (see\nBut\u00f6n 2013: 259); this longer version is the one most often cited\nand translated today. Some highly respected scholars (including\nHarrison in his 2007) argue that the shorter version of about seven\nhundred verses, sometimes known as the\nBodhisattva-cary\u0101vat\u0101ra or BsCA, was\nwritten first, followed by the \u015aS. Later on, someone,\nprobably \u015a\u0101ntideva himself but possibly another author,\nadded the additional verses to form the BCA as we know it\nnow. This chronology makes sense and is supported by some evidence,\nbut we may never know for sure whether it is correct.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s two works have quite different structures.\nThe BCA is organized into chapters and verses, and will be\ncited accordingly here: so BCA III.24 is the twenty-fourth\nverse of the third chapter. The \u015aS also contains many\nverses, including twenty-seven \u201croot verses\u201d that express\nimportant themes of the book, and numerous others composed by\n\u015a\u0101ntideva or quoted from sources; but these verses are\nscattered unevenly through a quite long prose text. The now-standard\nway to cite passages from the \u015aS uses page numbers from\nthe nearly complete Sanskrit manuscript discovered by Bendall; so a\npassage found at \u015aS 36 would be one that was originally\nfound on page 36 of that manuscript. Vaidya\u2019s edition of the\nSanskrit \u015aS provides the reader with these standard page\nnumbers, and so do both complete English translations.\n\nThe BCA is associated with a famous legend of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s life, recounted by But\u00f6n (2013:\n258\u2013259) and often retold in Tibetan religious contexts.\nAccording to this account, the master \u015a\u0101ntideva was a\nstudent monk at the great monastic university of N\u0101land\u0101,\nwhose ruins can still be seen in the modern Indian state of Bihar.\nUnfortunately, to all outward appearances, \u015a\u0101ntideva was not\nputting any effort into the central activities expected of\nN\u0101land\u0101\u2019s students: the study and recitation of\nBuddhist religious and philosophical texts. He came to be known as a\nbhusuku, a kind of Sanskrit acronym derived from words\nmeaning \u201ceat\u201d, \u201csleep\u201d, and\n\u201cdefecate\u201d\u2014as that was all anyone had seen him do.\n\n\nIn an attempt to encourage their apparently lazy student to return to\nhis proper path, some of the monks in authority at N\u0101land\u0101\ndecided to teach him a lesson. They assigned him to recite a text at\nan upcoming religious festival; and, just to humiliate him even more,\nbuilt him an elaborate throne from which to speak.\n\nOn the day of the festival, \u015a\u0101ntideva ascended the throne\nand asked the audience whether they would like to hear something old\nor something new; or in other words, whether he should recite\nsomething he had memorized, or an original composition of his own.\nPerhaps in amusement, the monks asked for something new, and\n\u015a\u0101ntideva began the first-ever recitation of the\nBCA. No doubt the audience would have been surprised to hear\ntheir lazy fellow-student present one of the greatest works of poetry\never composed in the Sanskrit language. During the recitation, while\nseated in meditation posture, the master began to levitate above the\nthrone. At the recitation of verse IX.34, he vanished, and the\nremainder of the text was recited by a disembodied voice from the sky.\nIX.34 reads:\n\n\nWhen neither entity nor nonentity remains before the mind, since there\nis no other mode of operation, grasping no objects, it becomes\ntranquil.\n\n\nBut what would it mean to be in a state in which \u201cneither entity\nnor nonentity remains before the mind\u201d, and why should this\nstate, often associated with the term \u201cemptiness\u201d\n(Sanskrit \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), be a highly valued goal of\nspiritual practice? These are remarkably difficult questions; the next\nsection offers the reader some preliminary groundwork that may help in\nengaging with them. Before we can even begin to try to understand\nemptiness, though, we must examine the key Buddhist teaching of no\nself.\n2. Metaphysics: No Self and Emptiness\n\nThe most central and most original intellectual discovery of the early\nBuddhist tradition was that we do not need to posit a substantial self\nin order to explain the world of our ordinary experience. Instead,\nBuddhist philosophers hold that we can arrive at much more defensible\nand much more fruitful accounts by exploring ways to understand the\nworld of our experience as a product of impersonal and subpersonal\ncausal processes. \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s writings are full of\npassages, including many quotations from earlier sources, that shed\nlight on the nature and implications of this insight, as well as the\nstill more profound teaching of emptiness. Indeed, according to\n\u015a\u0101ntideva and his sources, a direct, intuitive understanding\nof the absence of any self has the power to set us free from cyclic\nexistence. At \u015aS 242, he offers this quotation from the\nMysteries of the Tath\u0101gata S\u016btra:\n\n\nFor example, \u015a\u0101ntamati, if the root of a tree is cut, all\nthe branches, leaves, and flowers dry up. In just the same way,\n\u015a\u0101ntamati, if you pacify the false view of a real self, all\nreactive emotions are pacified.\n\n\nAs articulated in early Buddhist texts and in the philosophical works\nbelonging to the Abhidharma traditions of the Way of the Disciples\n(Sanskrit \u015ar\u0101vaka-y\u0101na), the teaching of no\nself depends on a crucial distinction between conventional truth and\nultimate truth. Those entities that exist ultimately have an existence\nthat is robustly metaphysically objective, whereas things at the\nconventional level are said to exist as a result of a process of\nconceptual construction. On some interpretations of this distinction\nin the Abhidharma context, conventional things do not exist at all;\ninstead, it is merely convenient in practice to pretend that they do\n(see Goodman 2005). According to the Buddhist tradition, in order for\nsomething to exist at the ultimate level, it would have to be findable\nunder analysis: that is, careful philosophical examination would have\nto be able to find a clear and defensible explanation of how it\nexists. If conceived of as existing over and above their parts,\ncomposite entities fail this test; when analyzed, they disappear, as\nwe can give no satisfactory account of how they relate to their parts.\nSo according to the Abhidharma, the only entities that could exist\nultimately would have to be utterly simple, having no spatial parts\nand existing for only one single instant of time. The world that we\nexperience is the product of the collective causal activity of immense\nnumbers of these tiny, simple entities. These claims apply even to\nwhat we regard as our own actions, choices and decisions (for further\nexplanation, see Siderits 2007: ch. 3 and ch. 6).\n\nThis picture is quite different from how we ordinarily understand\nhuman life and agency; the \u015aS contains several passages\nintended to help us come to grips with what a world of impersonal\ncausation would be like. An especially illuminating analogy can be\nfound at \u015aS 262:\n\n\nI have taught the aspects of action,\n\nBut no agent exists in the ten directions.\n\nIt\u2019s just like when trees, agitated by the wind,\n\nProduce fire:\n\nThe wind and the trees do not think,\n\n\u201cWe should generate this fire.\u201d\n\nHowever, fire arises.\n\nThe performance of action is similar.\n\n\nA helpful sketch of the overall picture at work in these texts can be\nfound at \u015aS 238:\n\n\nCompounded things proceed by means\n\nOf causes and conditions,\n\nMutual causality and dependent arising;\n\nFoolish people don\u2019t realize this.\n\nFor example, by the power of effort,\n\nMu\u00f1ja grass and balbaja grass can be woven\ntogether into a rope;\n\nA water-wheel turns, but\n\nThe individual parts can\u2019t turn by themselves.\n\nIn the same way, all the aspects of being\n\nExist in dependence on the combination of the others;\n\nFrom the most distant past to the farthest future,\n\nOne of these existing by itself is not apprehended. (SS-G: 230)\n\n\nThe Tibetan \u015aS quotes at 226 a passage from the Rice\nSheaf S\u016btra that offers an interesting analogy that responds\nto the perennial question of how rebirth could be possible when there\nis no self. Many people, when confronted with the teaching of no self,\nask how we could possibly understand the process of rebirth if there\nis nothing that travels from this life to the next. But as the\ns\u016btra points out, the moon can be reflected in still water, even\nthough the moon does not travel down to the earth. In the same way, a\ncausal process of dependent arising can lead to a kind of continuity\nfrom one life to another, even though there is no real, substantial\nthing that travels from this body into the next. Another analogy\nintended to make a similar point is found at 239: \n\n\nAlthough a seal produces a seal impression,\n\nWe don\u2019t apprehend that the seal transmigrates.\n\nIt isn\u2019t there [in the impression,] but nor are they wholly\ndifferent.\n\nIn the same way, composite things are not annihilated and not\neternal.\n\n\nThough \u015a\u0101ntideva devotes considerable effort to expounding\nthe reductionist views of the Abhidharma tradition, he does not regard\nthem as the final word in Buddhist philosophy. We can see this\nespecially in Chapter IX of the BCA, which engages with\nphilosophical disagreements between Buddhists and non-Buddhists and\nbetween different schools of thought within the Buddhist tradition.\nThis chapter is so formidably technical, and so terse and compressed,\nas to be open to a range of different interpretations; at places it is\nalmost impenetrable. One thing at least is very clear: the views\nexpressed fall within the Madhyamaka or Middle Way School, a\nphilosophical tradition founded by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna that has been\nprestigious and influential in China and utterly dominant in Tibet.\nThe teachings of the Madhyamaka pose notorious and formidable\ndifficulties of interpretation; fortunately, much valuable scholarship\nhas recently become available that is of great help in delineating the\nrange of plausible interpretations and the considerations that can be\nadvanced to support them. (See especially Siderits and Katsura\n(trans.) 2013; Westerhoff 2009; Garfield 2015: ch. 3; Arnold 2012: ch.\n6.)\n\nThe core claim of Madhyamaka is generally acknowledged to be that\nnothing in the universe has any svabh\u0101va. This Sanskrit\nterm has a complex cluster of meanings that make it extraordinarily\ndifficult to translate. Many scholars have now adopted the translation\n\u201cintrinsic nature\u201d for svabh\u0101va, but it has\nalso been rendered at various times as \u201cessence\u201d,\n\u201csubstance\u201d, \u201cown-being\u201d, and \u201cintrinsic\nexistence\u201d, among many other attempts. If something had\nsvabh\u0101va, then it would be possible fully to understand\nthat thing\u2019s nature as it is in itself, independently of any\nrelations it might bear to anything else, and independently of the\nconceptual or linguistic activities of sentient beings. Following\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, though, M\u0101dhyamika teachers argued that nothing\ncould possibly have svabh\u0101va as just described. If\nsomething did have svabh\u0101va, it would be permanent,\nunchanging, and independent; and Buddhists argue that nothing in the\nworld has these qualities. Instead, everything that arises in our\nexperience, or could so arise, is impermanent, constantly changing,\ndependent on causes and conditions, and understood within a conceptual\nframework. We cannot say or think how or what anything is except by\nmaking overt or covert reference to other things; nor can anything be\nhow or what it is except in relation to other things. Thus, everything\nis empty of intrinsic nature. In the Madhyamaka, this claim is taken\nto be equivalent to the statement that nothing can exist at the\nultimate level of truth; instead, everything that exists, arises or\nhappens does so at the conventional level. Conventional existence, on\nthis view, is actually the only kind of existence that anything has,\nand the only kind that anything could have.\n\nDrawing on the Perfection of Wisdom s\u016btras, M\u0101dhyamika\nauthors offered various analogies to try to illustrate what it is like\nfor things to lack any intrinsic nature. Of these, probably the most\nhelpful and illuminating is the analogy of a mirage, found, for\ninstance, at \u015aS 256. In drawing out this analogy, the\nfirst thing to notice is that a mirage is something that exists.\nSomeone who simply denied reports that, on hot days, roads sometimes\nappear to be covered with pools of water, thus entirely rejecting the\nexistence of mirages, would thereby hold a mistaken view. Similarly,\naccording to the Madhyamaka view, ordinary conventional things,\nincluding shoes and ships and sealing-wax, actually do exist. On the\nother hand, a mirage is deceptive: the way in which it exists is not\nthe same as the way in which it appears to exist. Similarly, the\nobjects of our everyday experience appear to us to exist by way of\nintrinsic nature, while in fact they exist conventionally. Moreover, a\nmirage arises from causes and conditions; just so, ordinary\nconventional things arise from causes and conditions. Finally, and\nmore controversially, a mirage is something that exists only from a\ncertain point of view. In the same way\u2014although not all\ninterpreters of Madhyamaka would accept this way of putting\nit\u2014ordinary things exist only from the perspective of particular\nconceptual schemes, and not in a robustly objective way, not\n\u201cfrom their own side\u201d.\n\nMany arguments were been advanced by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, as well as\nby later Buddhist writers, for the claim that there is no intrinsic\nnature; many of these arguments, including most of those found in\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s works, are thoroughly and sympathetically\ndiscussed in modern secondary sources such as Westerhoff 2009. In his\npresentation of emptiness in chapter 14 of the \u015aS,\nthough, \u015a\u0101ntideva devotes considerable space to an argument\nthat has been quite prominent in the Tibetan tradition but is not\nusually foregrounded in Western interpretations of Madhyamaka. A\nrepresentative instance of this argument can be found at\n\u015aS 248:\n\n\nHere, Your Majesty, when the internal fire element arises, it\ndoesn\u2019t come from anywhere. When it ceases, it doesn\u2019t go\nanywhere. It doesn\u2019t exist, then it exists; and having existed,\nit disappears again, because it has no intrinsic nature. (SS-G:\n237\u2013238)\n\n\nThis argument may lose some of its credibility in our eyes due to the\nprescientific forms in which \u015a\u0101ntideva presents it. However,\nsimilar arguments can be constructed entirely in terms of a\ncontemporary scientific worldview. For example, we could argue that,\nwhen gaseous hydrogen and oxygen react to form water, the liquid state\nof the resulting water doesn\u2019t come from anywhere. And when that\nwater freezes and becomes ice, its liquid state doesn\u2019t go\nanywhere. So liquidity has no intrinsic nature.\n\nWhen presented as a meditative exercise to appropriately prepared\nstudents, this reasoning can produce striking results. Whether it is a\ncogent philosophical argument is an other question. The argument\nevidently depends on suppressed premises, but it\u2019s not entirely\nclear what these are supposed to be. More philosophical work on this\nform of Madhyamaka reasoning could be very helpful.\n\nThough they share a common denial that anything has intrinsic nature,\nMadhyamaka philosophers differ in their views about various other\nphilosophical issues; indeed, some within this tradition hold that the\ngoal of practice is to have no views at all. Within the overall\nframework of Madhyamaka, Tibetan scholars generally classify\n\u015a\u0101ntideva as belonging to the Middle Way Reductio School\n(Skt. Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-madhyamaka, Tib. dbu ma thal\n\u2018gyur pa) of Buddhap\u0101lita and Candrak\u012brti. This\nform of Madhyamaka is opposed to the Middle Way Autonomous School\n(Skt. Sv\u0101tantrika-madhyamaka, Tib. dbu ma rang rgyud\npa). Some modern writers have viewed this doxographical\nidentification with skepticism, noting that \u015a\u0101ntideva takes\nno explicit position on the issues of argumentative and logical\nmethodology that, they believe, were the core questions at issue\nbetween Candrak\u012brti and Bh\u0101vaviveka. Indeed, these Indian\nmasters would not have used the terms Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\nand Sv\u0101tantrika to describe themselves, and some\nscholars have questioned the extent to which Tibetan doxographical\ncategories can helpfully illuminate Indian philosophical discussions,\nas opposed to oversimplifying or distorting them.\n\nOne of the most influential, and controversial, passages in the\nBCA is verse IX.139 (Vaidya 1988: 272\u201373; C&S:\n129). The great Tibetan philosopher Tsong kha pa cited this passage as\na crucial Indic precedent for the doctrine of \u201cidentifying the\nobject of negation\u201d, which plays a central role in his reading\nof Madhyamaka (Tsong kha pa, GT: 126). But modern scholars disagree\nabout whether the verse really does express a form of that doctrine,\nor whether the intended meaning was something else entirely.\n\nIn several places, \u015a\u0101ntideva devotes considerable attention\nto arguing, contrary to what would seem to be obvious common sense,\nthat there is no real thing that I can call \u201cmy body\u201d.\nArguments to this effect can be found both in BCA IX and in\nthe long series of verses that concludes the \u015aS. These\nare the verses that Bendall and Rouse wrongly identified as quotations\nfrom the Mysteries of the Tath\u0101gata S\u016btra, and that\nHarrison discovered to have been composed by \u015a\u0101ntideva\nhimself (see Harrison 2007).\n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva poses a dilemma for anyone who claims that the\nbody is a substantially existing entity. If the body is thought of a\nphysical object that has a specific visible form, then such a body\ndoes not last for an entire lifetime, since the shape and appearance\nof the body change dramatically between early childhood and old age.\nOn the other hand, if the body is understood to be something more\nabstract that remains constant through these visible changes, then we\ncan\u2019t point to it, and it is not able to play the role in our\nself-understanding that we normally expect the body to play. Neither\nview can provide us with a real entity that both withstands analysis\nand is suitable to be the object of our ordinary, attached attitude.\nAs we will see, this reasoning plays an important role in\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views about how to live; these will be our\nnext topic of discussion.\n3. Ethics and Ethical Theory\n3.1 General Considerations\n\nAs a Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist, \u015a\u0101ntideva advises\npractitioners to adopt the Awakening Mind (Sanskrit\nbodhicitta), the altruistic intention to become a Buddha and\nthen remain in cyclic existence for the benefit of others until all\nsentient beings have been saved from suffering. Someone who adopts the\nAwakening Mind is thereafter known as a bodhisattva, a being in the\nprocess of waking up. \u015a\u0101ntideva expresses his own commitment\nto the Awakening Mind in a justly famous verse, BCA X.55:\n\u201cAs long as space abides and as long as the world abides, so\nlong may I abide, destroying the sufferings of the world\u201d. The\nwhole of BCA III focuses on the Awakening Mind from two\npoints of view. First, the chapter expresses thoughts and sentiments\nthat might be experienced by someone who was taking up the Awakening\nMind for the first time. The second, shorter portion of BCA\nIII is a soaring evocation of the value and importance of this quality\nof the mind and heart. This chapter contains some of the finest\nBuddhist poetry ever written:\n\n\nIII. 27. As a blind man might find a jewel in heaps of rubbish, so too\nthis Awakening Mind has somehow appeared in me.\n\n28. This is the elixir of life, born to end death in the world. This\nis the inexhaustible treasure, alleviating poverty in the world.\n\n29. This is the supreme medicine, curing the sickness of the world, a\ntree of shelter for weary creatures staggering along the road of\nexistence;\n\n30. The causeway to cross over bad rebirths, open to all who travel.\nIt is the rising moon of the mind, mitigating the defilements of the\nworld.\n\n31. It is the brilliant sun, dispelling the mist of ignorance from the\nworld. It is the fresh butter risen up from churning the milk of the\ntrue Dharma.\n\n32. For the caravan of humanity traveling the road of existence,\nhungry for the enjoyment of happiness, this is a feast of happiness\noffered as refreshment to all who approach.\n\n33ab. Today I summon the world to Buddhahood and, meanwhile, to\nhappiness. (translation slightly altered from C&S: 22)\n\n\nFor \u015a\u0101ntideva, as for other Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists,\nthe spiritual path that is shaped and motivated by the Awakening Mind\ninvolves the cultivation of six crucial qualities or virtues known as\nthe Perfections (or perhaps \u201cTranscendences\u201d, Sanskrit\np\u0101ramit\u0101). This well-known list has great\nimportance for \u015a\u0101ntideva, as it provides the main structural\nframework for the organization of the BCA; members of the\nlist also occur in the titles of four of the chapters of the\n\u015aS. The six perfections are:\n\nThe Perfection of Generosity\n(d\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Moral Discipline\n(\u015b\u012bla-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Patient Endurance\n(k\u1e63\u0101nti-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Perseverance\n(v\u012brya-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Meditative Stability\n(dhy\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of wisdom\n(praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\n\n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva regards generosity as having a crucial role in the\nbodhisattva path, and his interpretation of generosity is quite\ndemanding and rigorous, as indeed is the case for many of our\npremodern Buddhist sources. He extols the transcendent generosity of\nthose bodhisattvas of the past who were willing to sacrifice parts of\ntheir own body, even at grave risk to their own lives, in order to\nrelieve the suffering of others and advance their own spiritual\ndevelopment. According to \u015a\u0101ntideva, though, the true\nperfection of generosity is a mental attitude that consists in the\nrenunciation of the very idea of owning anything. At \u015aS\n18\u201319, he quotes the Vows of Individual Liberation for\nBodhisattvas as teaching that \u201ca bodhisattva thinks of\neverything as belonging to someone else, and doesn\u2019t own\nanything. Why? Because ownership is fear\u201d (SS-G: 22; and see\nBCA V.10). \n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s understanding of the Perfection of Patient\nEndurance, as discussed in BCA VI and in ch. 10 of the\n\u015aS, is of great philosophical interest. Like many\nBuddhists, \u015a\u0101ntideva rejects the common-sense view that\nanger is often an appropriate response to the failings and\ntransgressions of others. Instead, he holds several radical theses\nabout anger: that anger is gravely spiritually and psychologically\ndamaging to the one who succumbs to it; that anger always involves\ncertain conceptual mistakes; and that it is therefore urgent to\ncounteract anger through meditative exercises.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s clear and uncompromising advocacy of the\nelimination of anger has been fruitfully compared to the views of\ncertain Hellenistic philosophers (see, e.g., Gowans 2010). His reasons\nfor thinking that anger necessarily involves conceptual error will be\nbriefly explained below. \n\nIn her monograph on the \u015aS, Suzanne Mrozik has\nemphasized the somatic dimension of that text\u2019s normative\nperspective. For Buddhists such as \u015a\u0101ntideva, moral\nexcellence must be attained through rigorous practices of bodily\ndiscipline. Some of these belong to monastic etiquette and training;\nothers are forms of mindfulness of body; and others are aspects of\nmeditation practice. Moreover, s\u016btra texts quoted by\n\u015a\u0101ntideva claim that Buddhist devotional practices and the\npreservation of moral discipline will lead to an attractive, healthy\nand beautiful body. Mrozik sees much potential in these teachings,\nwhich emphasize aspects of moral practice that modern writers often\noverlook. Yet we might be concerned that a literal reading of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views about the causes of physical\nattractiveness could lead healthy and handsome people to a quite\nunwarranted sense of superiority, while licensing contempt for, or\neven discrimination against, the ugly or the disabled.\n\nAs Barbra Clayton has shown, the description of the\nbodhisattva\u2019s way of life in the \u015aS features an\ninteresting perspective on the role of pu\u1e47ya,\n\u201cgoodness\u201d or \u201cgood karma\u201d. Early Buddhist\ntexts appear to take the view that the Saint (Sanskrit arhat)\nstops creating karmic traces, whether good or bad, as a result of her\nexperience of liberation. These karmic traces function to project\nhappy or unhappy future experiences in cyclic existence; and a Saint,\nwho is free of cyclic existence, must therefore have left goodness\nbehind, along with the vile actions that lead to misery.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva, on the other hand, sees even quite advanced\nbodhisattvas as committed to the ongoing cultivation of goodness, not\nfor their own sake, but in order to transfer it to other sentient\nbeings and thereby sustain their progress towards spiritual maturity\n(see Clayton 2006: 76\u201388). \n\nAnother feature of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s presentation of\nBuddhist ethics that is not commonly encountered in similar texts is\nthe emphasis he places in the \u015aS on the interdependent\nand mutually supportive nature of the various Buddhist virtues. So,\nfor example, he writes at \u015aS 289 that \u201cyou should\nundertake to increase goodness through effort, intention, and\ncompassion, which stabilize each other\u201d. And at \u015aS\n121 we find a passage, also in \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s own voice,\nthat could be rendered: \u201cMoral discipline and stable attention\nreinforce each other. The two together make it possible to embrace\nexperience completely\u201d (see SS-G: 119 and 273). \n\nThe fact that \u015a\u0101ntideva sees the various Buddhist virtues as\nmutually supportive may help to explain why he devotes so little\ntheoretical attention to resolving conflicts between different\nBuddhist values. If they all work together and reinforce each other,\nsuch conflicts would be merely theoretical and would have little\npractical importance. \n3.2 From Metaphysics to Ethics\n\nAs Amod Lele has pointed out (Lele 2015,) there are at least four\nsignificant passages in the BCA in which \u015a\u0101ntideva\nattempts to draw normative conclusions from descriptive, philosophical\npremises: that is, to argue from an account of how things actually are\nto conclusions about how we should feel and how we should live. The\narguments identified by Lele are, first, that because our actions and\ndecisions arise from causes, we should practice patient endurance and\nabandon the irrational emotion of anger (BCA VI.22\u201349);\nsecond, that because there is no body over and above its parts, we\nshould abandon lust and change how we think about protecting the body\n(BCA VIII.40\u201383); third, that because there is no\nsubstantial self, we should care as much about others\u2019\nwell-being as we do about the things we ourselves value (BCA\nVIII.90\u2013109); and finally, that because everything is empty, we\nshould let go of all forms of attachment (various passages in\nBCA IX).\n\nThe first of these arguments is embedded in a passage now seen by many\nscholars as the most sophisticated and well-developed discussion in\nthe entirety of premodern Indian literature of what we know today as\nthe problem of free will. The three verses that are perhaps most\ncrucial to this passage are:\n\n\nVI.25. Whatever transgressions (apar\u0101dha) and vile\nactions (p\u0101pa) there are, all arise through the power of\nconditioning factors, while there is nothing that arises\nindependently.\n\nVI.31. In this way everything is dependent upon something else. Even\nthat thing upon which each is dependent is not independent. Since,\nlike a magical display, phenomena do not initiate activity, at what\ndoes one get angry like this?\n\nVI.33. Therefore, even if one sees a friend or an enemy behaving\nbadly, one can reflect that there are specific conditioning factors\nthat determine this, and thereby remain happy. (translation slightly\nmodified from C&S: 52\u201353)\n\n\nThough some main features of this argument are clear enough, there are\ndifferent ways to understand its conclusion. On one interpretation,\n\u015a\u0101ntideva thinks that anger is always cognitively\ninappropriate because he holds a version of what we call hard\ndeterminism or hard incompatibilism (a view defended in Goodman 2002\nand in ch. 8 of Goodman 2009). On this first reading,\n\u015a\u0101ntideva thinks that an accurate understanding of how our\nbehavior is caused excludes the possibility of basic desert, in which\nit would be morally fitting or appropriate to inflict hard treatment\non someone solely because of their past actions. The rejection of\nbasic desert, though, is still compatible with the idea that it could\nsometimes be appropriate to criticize or punish someone in order to\nbring about good consequences. (For a powerful and sophisticated\nexposition of this kind of perspective, see Pereboom 2001.)\n\nA second interpretation, advanced by Mark Siderits, attributes to\n\u015a\u0101ntideva a special form of compatibilism known as\n\u201cBuddhist paleocompatibilism\u201d (see, e.g., Siderits 2013).\nSiderits holds that the hard incompatibilist position is incorrect\nbecause it illegitimately moves back and forth between the\nconventional and ultimate levels of truth. Though there is no agency\nwhatsoever at the ultimate level, a kind of free will could still be\npossible in the context of conventional truth; and on this view,\nconventional free will could still justify many of our practices of\nassigning blame and responsibility.\n\nThe crux of the disagreement between the two interpretations concerns\nverse VI.32:\n\n\nIf it is argued that to resist anger is inappropriate, for \u201cwho\nis it that resists what?\u201d, our view is that it is appropriate:\nsince there is dependent origination there can be cessation of\nsuffering. (C&S: 53)\n\n\nOn the paleocompatibilist reading, \u015a\u0101ntideva in this verse\ntakes back important elements of the view that he appears to present\nin verses VI.22\u201331, shifting his position to retain elements of\nautonomous agency as part of the worldview of a practicing\nbodhisattva. On the hard incompatibilist reading, this verse responds\nto an objection against \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s position without\nabandoning or even qualifying the main argument. The claim that there\nis no autonomy of the type that would generate basic desert, it can be\nargued, is perfectly compatible with the claim that it would be better\nfor me to resist anger whenever it arises (see Goodman \n2016).\n\nAmong the numerous subsidiary arguments against the rationality of\nanger presented in BCA VI, one is especially noteworthy.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva holds that those who harm us are not autonomous,\nand so not responsible, because they are under control of irrational\nemotional reactions that overpower their ability to respond\nappropriately, and instead cause them to engage in actions destructive\nboth to others and to themselves. So the most appropriate response to\nothers\u2019 transgressions is not to get angry at them, but to\narouse the aspiration to develop in ourselves the ability to set\nothers free from emotional reactivity and confusion. This argument\nwould be quite influential among later Buddhists. Thus Tsong kha pa\nwrites that \n\n\nAlthough many reasonings are set forth in [the BCA], it is\neasy to be certain of this one, and it is a very powerful remedy for\nanger\u2026 so meditate repeatedly on this remedy. (GT:\n161\u201362) \n\n\nThe second argument from metaphysics to ethics discussed by Lele draws\non \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s arguments that are intended to refute\nthe real existence of the body. These are not offered merely to\nsatisfy some form of pure intellectual curiosity; they are intended to\nhave important motivational effects. Many people are proud of their\nbodies, and almost all adults have felt sexual attraction towards the\nbodies of some other people. Both the pride and the attraction,\n\u015a\u0101ntideva holds, can operate only when we ignore the\ninsubstantial nature and disgusting character of our own and\nothers\u2019 bodies (see, e.g., BCA VIII.30\u201370;\n\u015aS 231). Moreover, ordinary people understandably feel\nintensely protective of their own bodies, and this attitude often\nleads to morally questionable behavior. According to\n\u015a\u0101ntideva, if we clearly understand what the body is, we can\ntransform our emotional relationship with it. This transformation\ninvolves coming to see the body as \u201clike a machine, a mechanical\nconstruct of interconnected bones and muscles\u201d (\u015aS\n231, SS-G: 225). Though it has no intrinsic value at all, the body is\ninstrumentally useful as a means to support spiritual practice and to\nassist other sentient beings; as such, it makes sense to protect the\nbody as long as it can play a useful role. And when it can no longer\ndo so, it can still become food for carnivorous animals.\n\nConsiderable scholarly attention has recently focused on the third of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s arguments, from the absence of any self to\nthe rationality of altruism. This argument was already explored in an\ninsightful way by Luis G\u00f3mez in 1973, and became a major topic\nof discussion largely as a result of the criticisms directed at it by\nPaul Williams (see Williams 1998, Siderits 2000, and Williams 2000).\nThe argument continues to attract both critics and defenders (see\nespecially ch. 4, 6, and 8 of Cowherds 2016). \n\nCommentators have tended to analyze the passage in question as having\ntwo major parts. The first part presents a simple, clear, inspiring,\nand yet at the same time, profoundly radical and unsettling argument\nfor altruism:\n\n\nVIII.94. I should dispel the suffering of others because it is\nsuffering like my own suffering. I should help others too because of\ntheir nature as beings, which is like my own being.\n\n95. When happiness is dear to me and others equally, what is so\nspecial about me that I strive after happiness only for myself?\n\n96. When fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally,\nwhat is so special about me that I protect myself and not the other?\n(translation slightly altered from C&S: 96)\n\n\nThis is a far more powerful argument than Mill\u2019s failed\n\u201cproof\u201d of utilitarianism. In highlighting the fundamental\nand undeniable similarity between ourselves and everyone else, it\ncalls us to broaden our concern and care without limit, and to\nrecognize the moral call of suffering and need, wherever they might be\nfound. It stands as a lasting challenge to all those who seek to limit\nthe scope or curtail the demands of morality. This argument was so\ncentral to \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s intellectual and religious\nproject that he made it the very first of the root verses of the\n\u015aS.\n\nYet, it seems, there is a possible answer available to the argument of\nBCA IX.94\u201396. I bear a special relation to my own\nfuture self, one that I do not bear to others. This is the relation of\npersonal identity. Just as it is widely acknowledged that I have\nespecially strong reason to benefit my friends, family members,\nstudents, or others to whom I bear special relations, the objection\ngoes, why should I not have an especially strong prudential reason to\nbenefit myself in the future, someone to whom I bear an even closer,\nsimpler, and more fundamental relation?\n\nThe second part of the passage answers this objection with a line of\nreasoning now commonly known as the Ownerless Suffering Argument. This\nargument draws on the reductionist metaphysics of the Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition known as the Abhidharma. \u015a\u0101ntideva\nwrites:\n\n\nIX.97. If I give them no protection because their suffering does not\nafflict me, why do I protect my body against future suffering when it\ndoes not afflict me?\n\n99. If you think it is for the person who has the pain to guard\nagainst it, a pain in the foot is not of the hand, so why is the one\nprotected by the other?\n\n101. The continuum of consciousness, like a queue, and the combination\nof constituents, like an army, are not real. The person who\nexperiences suffering does not exist. To whom will that suffering\nbelong?\n\n102. Without exception, no sufferings belong to anyone. They must be\nwarded off simply because they are suffering. Why is any limitation\nput on this? (see C&S: 96\u201397)\n\n\nIn response to the objection that personal identity justifies special\nconcern, \u015a\u0101ntideva simply denies that there is a real\nrelation of personal identity. This denial is based on a long\nphilosophical tradition within Buddhism, stretching back to its\nearliest days, of defenses and expositions of the doctrine of no self,\nthe most important and distinctive of all Buddhist teachings. But\n\u015a\u0101ntideva employs that doctrine in what may well have been a\nnovel way. It is quite common for Buddhist texts to assert that if we\ncan realize experientially that there is no substantial self, this\nrealization will cause us to be more altruistic. What\n\u015a\u0101ntideva argues here is that an intellectual understanding\nof the absence of any self can give us reason to affirm altruism as\nsupremely rational and egoism as rationally untenable. In this\nrespect, \u015a\u0101ntideva anticipates the central argument of Derek\nParfit\u2019s celebrated book Reasons and Persons (Parfit\n1984; see especially ch. 14\u201315).\n\nThe fourth argument from metaphysics to ethics analyzed by Lele relies\non the Madhyamaka view that, for \u015a\u0101ntideva, is the deepest\nexpression of the Buddha\u2019s message. This argument is in a way\nmuch simpler than the previous ones: It makes no sense to be attached\nto something that does not ultimately exist. But nothing at all exists\nultimately. So it makes no sense to be attached to anything. As\n\u015a\u0101ntideva writes at BCA IX.150\u201351,\n\n\nWhen all things are empty in this way, what can be received, what\ntaken away?\n\nWho can be honored or humiliated by whom?\n\nFrom what can there be happiness or misery, what can be liked and what\nloathed?\n\nWhat craving can there be? (C&S: 131; see Lele 2015: 32)\n\n\nThis profound reasoning could nevertheless be questioned. Once we\nunderstand that, as major Indian and Tibetan M\u0101dhyamika authors\nare at pains to insist, being empty of intrinsic nature is compatible\nboth with existence and with the capacity to perform a function (see\nTsong kha pa, GT: ch. 14\u201315), is the argument still convincing?\nMany Western scholars have had their doubts. Nevertheless, the view\nthat the ability to see the world of experience directly as empty will\nlead to the extinction of attachment and suffering in the\npractitioner\u2019s mind is a core commitment of Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, and its truth or falsity is an empirical matter of the\npsychology of meditation that does not depend on the cogency of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s reasoning on the topic.\n3.3 Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n\nSeveral scholars have advanced consequentialist interpretations of the\noverall moral view expressed in \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s works (see\nSiderits 2000; Clayton 2006: 112\u201318; Goodman 2008, 2009). One of\nthe best pieces of textual evidence in favor of such interpretations\noccurs at \u015aS 15, where \u015a\u0101ntideva writes in his\nown voice:\n\n\nOn this topic, for those who have taken the vow, a universal\ncharacteristic of downfalls will be stated, so that whenever they\nperceive anything that has that characteristic, they should abandon\nit, and so that they will not become confused by merely apparent\ndownfalls, or things that merely appear not to be downfalls.\n\nIf a bodhisattva does not make a sincere, unwavering effort in\nthought, word, and deed to stop all the present and future pain and\nsuffering of all sentient beings, and to bring about all present and\nfuture pleasure and happiness, or does not seek the collection of\nconditions for that, or does not strive to prevent what is opposed to\nthat, or does not bring about small pain and suffering as a way of\npreventing great pain and suffering, or does not abandon a small\nbenefit in order to accomplish a greater benefit, if he neglects to do\nthese things even for a moment, he undergoes a downfall. (see SS-G:\n17)\n\n\nThe intention of this passage is to present a general account of what\nconstitutes a \u201cdownfall\u201d (Sanskrit \u0101patti).\nThe term \u0101patti has as its primary meaning a violation\nor breach of some morally significant commitment that an agent has\nundertaken in the past. In this context, the commitment in question is\nthe bodhisattva vow, the aspiration to attain Awakening (Sanskrit\nbodhi) for the benefit of all sentient beings. So\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s goal in this passage is to give a general,\naction-guiding characterization of what it would mean to violate the\nbodhisattva vow.\n\nIn doing so, \u015a\u0101ntideva offers a formulation with several\nstriking similarities to a theory that has been hugely influential in\nthe history of Western ethical thought, a theory now normally called\n\u201cclassical utilitarianism\u201d. As articulated by a number of\nBritish writers in the nineteenth century, most notably Jeremy\nBentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick, classical\nutilitarianism holds that the criterion of right action is based on\nthe consequences of our actions for the happiness of sentient beings.\nMill once formulated this view as holding\n\n\nthat actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote\nhappiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By\nhappiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by\nunhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure. (Mill 2001 [1861]:\n7)\n\n\nIn rationally evaluating different options on this basis, many\nutilitarians claim that we should aggregate all the different\nconsequences of each action, weighting possibilities by the\nprobability they will occur, and then maximize, choosing the action\nwith the highest expected value for all those affected, counting\neveryone equally. \n\nSimilarly, for \u015a\u0101ntideva, we can evaluate our actions as\nregards their compatibility with the bodhisattva vow by asking whether\nthey tend to relieve the suffering and promote the happiness of all\nsentient beings. Moreover, where there is a choice between bringing\nabout a greater good or a lesser one, \u015a\u0101ntideva holds that\nthe bodhisattva vow requires us to maximize, sacrificing the lesser\ngood to achieve the greater one. And \u015a\u0101ntideva explicitly\ncommits himself to what many contemporary authors find to be an\nobjectionable feature of utilitarianism: namely, its demands on the\nindividual agent. Bodhisattvas are to devote all their time and all\ntheir efforts to alleviating the suffering and promoting the happiness\nof the world; to neglect this imperative \u201ceven for a\nmoment\u201d is a moral failure for them.\n\nIf the quotation above from \u015aS 15 really is an\nexposition of utilitarianism, it may be the very earliest clearly\narticulated statement of that view, preceding Jeremy Bentham by\napproximately a thousand years. \u015a\u0101ntideva was not the first\nconsequentialist ethical theorist; that distinction may go to the\nChinese philosopher Mozi. Yet there is not a single passage in\nMozi\u2019s writings that comes nearly as close to a statement of a\nmature form of utilitarianism as \u015a\u0101ntideva does in\n\u015aS 15. This passage constitutes a remarkable, and\nlong-neglected, intellectual achievement.\n\nOne concern that might be raised about the passage at \u015aS\n15 is that it is not quite as explicit as we would like about how to\nmake tradeoffs between two distinct others. So if A has to\nchoose whether to harm B in order to save C from some\ngreater harm, how should A make this choice? Such a situation\nwould seem to be an instance of \u201cbring[ing] about small pain and\nsuffering as a way of preventing great pain and suffering\u201d; yet\nneither here nor anywhere else in his work does \u015a\u0101ntideva\nexplicitly describe a choice that has this exact form. What he does do\nis consider tradeoffs between the wellbeing of the agent A and\nof some other person B; and what he says about these tradeoffs\nhas an unambiguously consequentialist structure. This is especially\nclear in the case of the famous verse on the gift of the body,\nBCA V.87:\n\n\nTherefore one should not relinquish one\u2019s life for someone whose\ndisposition to compassion is not as pure. But for someone whose\ndisposition is comparable, one should relinquish it. That way, there\nis no overall loss. (C&S: 41\u201342; for discussion, see Ohnuma\n2000, especially pp. 60\u201361)\n\n\nHere \u015a\u0101ntideva, who repeatedly advocates extreme and\nfrightening forms of self-sacrifice in contexts where such actions\nwould make things better, teaches that such self-sacrifice is not\nrequired, and indeed, is not advisable, where it would fail to promote\nthe good. What is more, there is at least one context in which\n\u015a\u0101ntideva argues that the bodhisattva is allowed to harm\nother sentient beings in order to support her own spiritual practice.\nThis occurs in the discussion of meat-eating at \u015aS\n132\u2013135. After quoting a passage that argues at length against\nthe consumption of meat, \u015a\u0101ntideva cites and endorses the\nview of another source holding that \u201cif it leads to a great\nbenefit, there is no problem\u201d (SS-G: 130). This will be true\ndespite the harm done to the animal whose meat is eaten.\n\nNumerous other passages in the BCA and the \u015aS\ncan be, and have been, read as providing additional evidence for\nconsequentialism as a crucial commitment and, indeed, as a central\nmessage of these texts. Several of these concern the issue of when it\nis acceptable to infringe what would normally be binding rules of\nBuddhist moral discipline. Several important Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts\nthat preceded \u015a\u0101ntideva, such as the S\u016btra on\nSkillful Means (Tatz 1994) and Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s Chapter\non Moral Discipline (Tatz 1986), had explained that particular\nrules and precepts of moral discipline in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na were\nintended to be flexible, so that they could permissibly be broken\nunder certain special circumstances without generating any unfavorable\nkarmic consequences. \u015a\u0101ntideva appears to have reflected\ncarefully on these teachings, developed their implications and\nexplored their theoretical basis. His position on the flexibility of\nthe rules is stated in full generality at BCA V.84:\n\u201cEven what is proscribed is permitted for a compassionate person\nwho sees it will be of benefit\u201d (C&S: 41). In various\npassages scattered through the \u015aS, \u015a\u0101ntideva\nexplains how this general perspective works as regards a number of\nspecific kinds of normally impermissible actions, such as theft\n(\u015aS 133), sexual misconduct (\u015aS\n166\u201367), and giving people alcohol and weapons (\u015aS\n271). In each case, \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s view is that when an\naction that is usually harmful occurs under special circumstances that\nwill lead it to have good consequences, and when the agent has a\nsufficiently pure compassionate motivation to benefit others, it is\npermissible. Similar reasoning is found at \u015aS\n144\u201345, where \u015a\u0101ntideva examines the circumstances\nunder which not giving something away is the appropriate\nchoice for a bodhisattva; these are characterized in terms of the\nundesirable consequences that would result from the gift. \n\nAt \u015aS 145\u2013146, we find further evidence\nreinforcing the consequentialist interpretation of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s ethics:\n\n\nAs the bodhisattva S\u0101rthav\u0101ha said in the S\u016btra on\nChanting the Dharma Together, \u201cBlessed One, when a\nbodhisattva longs for Awakening first of all for all sentient beings,\nnot for himself \u2026 this, Blessed One, is chanting the Dharma\ntogether.\u201d\n\nIt is only by giving things up that his own welfare is accomplished.\nNevertheless, for fear of losing benefits for sentient beings, he does\nnot place his own burden on unworthy sentient beings. But where no\nbenefits to sentient beings will be lost, what difference does it make\nif the welfare of the world is promoted by him or by somebody\nelse?\n\nSuppose that he fails to discard what is wholesome of his own in order\nto bring about what is wholesome for other bodhisattvas. Well, if he\nfears the suffering of the lower realms for himself, what others fear\nis also suffering. If he is indifferent, thinking \u201cThat\nsuffering has nothing to do with me\u201d, then as the s\u016btras\nsay, he undergoes a downfall. (SS-G: 141)\n\n\nAccording to this passage, bodhisattvas should focus their aspirations\non the Awakening of all sentient beings, and should even be prepared\nto sacrifice their own virtues (\u201cwhat is wholesome of his\nown\u201d) to enable other practitioners to advance along their own\npaths to spiritual maturity. The core argument for doing so, that\n\u201cwhat others fear is also suffering\u201d, recalls the\nreasoning of BCA VIII.96. \n\nProbably the most important aspect of this rich and complex passage is\nthe rhetorical question it raises: \u201cwhat difference does it make\nif the welfare of the world is promoted by him or by somebody\nelse?\u201d If we answer \u201cno difference\u201d, as\n\u015a\u0101ntideva seems to wish us to, then we may thereby be\ncommitted to a strong form of what philosophers call\n\u201cagent-neutrality\u201d. In Reasons and Persons,\nParfit explains this concept as follows. If a normative theory gives\ndifferent agents different moral aims, then it is an agent-relative\ntheory. So, for example, many moral theories hold that parents have a\nspecial obligation to take care of their own children; such views\nwould give each parent the aim that his or her own children flourish,\nand these aims would differ from one person to the next. A theory is\nagent-neutral in virtue of giving all agents the very same set of\nmoral aims. So a theory that told everyone to adopt the sole aim that\nall children should flourish would be an agent-neutral theory.\n\nNow a view that claims that it does not matter whether, say, Martha or\nVivek promotes the welfare of the world, but only how much the welfare\nof the world is promoted, is an agent-neutral view, in that it gives\nboth Martha and Vivek the same, common aim: that all sentient beings\nshould enjoy the best lives possible. In terms of such a view, Martha\nshould, for example, abandon an opportunity to produce a small benefit\nfor others if she can, thereby, create the conditions for Vivek to\nbring about a greater benefit for others. This kind of\nagent-neutrality is a central element of most consequentialist views,\nand plays a crucial role in generating many of their most frequently\ndiscussed implications. So \u015aS 145\u201346, and other\npassages in the texts that are suggestive of agent-neutrality, provide\nevidence in favor of reading \u015a\u0101ntideva as an early\nconsequentialist theorist. And even if we were to conclude that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s normative perspective is not a form of\nconsequentialism, if we also conclude that it is fully agent-neutral,\nthat will be enough to guarantee that it has much in common with many\nWestern consequentialist theories.\n3.4 Non-Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n\nWhile recognizing that \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views have many\nelements in common with consequentialism, and indeed, leaving open the\npossibility that the consequentialist interpretation may be correct,\nGordon Davis has pointed out some potential worries for this form of\ninterpretation, as well as elements of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\nthought that might be understood as more similar to a Kantian view\n(Davis 2013). In particular, Davis points out that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s aspiration is to help all sentient beings\nattain Buddhahood, at which time they would all have attained a kind\nof equality. If \u015a\u0101ntideva assigns intrinsic value to\nequality, then he must not be a utilitarian, although he might still\nbe some kind of consequentialist. Indeed, as Davis suggests, the idea\nof a world in which everyone has abandoned wrongdoing and its\npsychological causes in favor of the nonviolent community of equals\ncould be compared to Kant\u2019s Kingdom of Ends. \n\nDamien Keown\u2019s highly influential and important book The\nNature of Buddhist Ethics (2001) advanced an interpretation of\nearly Buddhism and of the Therav\u0101da tradition based on a\ncomparison with Aristotelian virtue ethics. Though \u015a\u0101ntideva\ndiffers dramatically from Aristotle in many ways, there can be no\ndoubt that he is deeply concerned with the cultivation of character,\nand that he is much more interested than at least some Western\nutilitarians have been in the question of how we can become better\npeople. Thus, the possibility of important similarities between\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s thought and theories within the domain of\nvirtue ethics should not be disregarded.\n\nThe most sophisticated critique of the consequentialist interpretation\nof \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s ethics has been put forward by Stephen\nHarris (in his 2015). Harris accepts that \u015a\u0101ntideva puts\nimpartial benevolence near the center of his normative perspective,\nand that the primacy of this motivation constitutes a resemblance with\nWestern consequentialist views. He also agrees that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views allow consequences to have some role\nin providing reasons for action. But this second similarity is quite\nweak, as most plausible ethical theories do regard consequences as\nhaving some practical significance. Aside from these claims, Harris\nquestions whether we are in a position to ascribe any particular ethical\ntheory, either consequentialist or otherwise, to \u015a\u0101ntideva.\nAnd he offers several reasons in support of his critique.\n\nFirst, \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s book is not just a work of\nphilosophy; as all interpreters accept, it is also a meditation\nmanual. This means that \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s verses, even when\nthey appear to be providing reasons for accepting a certain claim, can\noften be interpreted instead as providing us with instructions for a\nparticular meditative practice that is intended to bring about an\nemotional shift in our consciousness. The statements that we entertain\nas part of such a practice do not need to be asserted as true, as part\nof a sober statement of philosophical tenets. We can wish for\nimpossible things to happen during the cultivation of altruism (as in\nmuch of BCA X); and we can tell ourselves things that are\nfalse, suspending disbelief during a meditation session, in order to\ndevelop certain virtues. Since this is the case, we must be cautious\nabout holding that \u015a\u0101ntideva is actually making assertions\nin any particular passage; instead, we should keep in mind that he may\nonly be giving meditation instructions. Of course, as Harris points\nout, he might be doing both of these things at once; and if we can\nshow that this is what he is doing, the passages would be just as good\nevidence for his ethical theory as they would be if they were not also\nmeditation instructions. \n\nA second reason Harris provides for doubting that we can know what\nkind of ethical theory to attribute to \u015a\u0101ntideva rests on\nthe central role of the concept of up\u0101ya in\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in general, and in\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s writings in particular (see Harris 2015:\n253). Up\u0101ya, a Sanskrit word often translated as\n\u201cskillful means\u201d or \u201cexpedient means\u201d, refers\nto an approach to teaching allegedly adopted by Buddhas and other\nhighly advanced spiritual teachers towards those who have not yet\nreached the highest stages of their own spiritual paths. The idea is\nthat the Buddhas don\u2019t always tell such people the final truth;\ninstead, they tell them whatever they need to hear at the time,\nincluding even falsehoods, if doing so will be the most effective way\nto support their progress towards spiritual maturity. But since this\nis the case, it may be difficult to know whether, in any given\npassage, \u015a\u0101ntideva is expressing what he takes to be the\nright view, or whether he is offering falsehoods that may nevertheless\nbe helpful to some readers, depending on their own level of meditative\npractice and philosophical training. (For more on up\u0101ya,\nsee, e.g., Pye 1978 [2003], cited by Harris 2015, and Goodman 2011.)\n\nYet another reason for concern about whether we can know the\nunderlying theoretical structure of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\nethical thought results from what we could call (though Harris does\nnot) the Fortunate Coincidence Thesis. By this phrase, I mean the view\nthat our moral obligations and our prudential incentives always or\nalmost always coincide if rightly understood. A particularly clear and\nstriking form of the Fortunate Coincidence Thesis is expressed at\nBCA VIII.129:\n\n\nAll those who suffer in the world do so because of their desire for\ntheir own happiness. All those happy in the world are so because of\ntheir desire for the happiness of others. (C&S: 99; and see\nVII.42, and so on)\n\n\nIf this is true, it is wonderful news for those of us who want to be\nhappy; but it may be a bit inconvenient for those of us who want to\nclassify Buddhist ethical views. This is because the Fortunate\nCoincidence Thesis makes it difficult or impossible to pull apart the\njustificatory role of self-interest from that of what we owe to\nothers. If these two perspectives give us the same answers across a\nwide range of cases, how can we tell which of them would take primacy,\nif they were to conflict? So as Harris points out, even what seem to\nus to be very demanding and lofty exhortations in Buddhist texts to\npractice extreme altruism might, in light of the Fortunate Coincidence\nThesis, be justified at the foundational level by a eudaimonistic\nvirtue ethics, or even by a form of rational egoism.\n\nObviously, a theory that is egoist at its foundations is in severe\ntension with the Ownerless Suffering Argument; and though it may be\nless obvious, there is an equally strong tension between that argument\nand a view that tells me to prioritize my own virtue over the\ncultivation of virtue in others. Harris does not think that this\nconsideration is decisive, however, since he regards the Ownerless\nSuffering Argument as itself a mere up\u0101ya. It must be an\nup\u0101ya, Harris says, since it relies on the Abhidharma\nunderstanding of the doctrine of no self, whereas\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s actual view belongs to a very different\nform of Buddhist philosophy, the Madhyamaka. It would follow that we\ncannot use the Ownerless Suffering Argument to ascertain what kind of\nethical theory, if any, \u015a\u0101ntideva would actually be prepared\nto defend as a final account of what reasons we have. \n\nIn summary, though all participants in the discussion now seem to\nacknowledge that there are at least some important similarities\nbetween \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views and the theories of Western\nconsequentialist ethicists, scholarly controversy continues about\nexactly how close these similarities are, and about how far the\navailable textual evidence legitimately allows us to go in attributing\nto \u015a\u0101ntideva any particular views about the foundations of\nethics.\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe BCA and the \u015aS contain some of the best\npoetry and some of the most accessible and powerful teachings on\nno-self and emptiness that the Indian Buddhist tradition ever\nproduced. In several ways, these texts are unique. No other premodern\ntext contains such interesting general reflections about how Buddhist\nteachings on how to live relate to each other and form a coherent\nwhole. The Ownerless Suffering Argument has no exact parallel\nelsewhere in Indian literature. No other Indian text grappled with the\nproblem of free will as carefully and as seriously as the\nBCA. And few, if any, Buddhist writers have ever been as\nskilled as \u015a\u0101ntideva at evoking a remarkable range of\nemotions in the reader. To advance his spiritual goals, he crafted\npassages that are remarkably effective, even today, at arousing\ndisgust, fear, remorse, determination, altruism, generosity,\nlovingkindness, and compassion. For anyone who wishes to understand\nthe philosophical teachings and spiritual aspirations of the mature\nIndian Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist tradition, and to appreciate why\nthese teachings were convincing and these aspirations compelling to\nmany premodern Indians and Tibetans, there is no better source than\nthe works of \u015a\u0101ntideva.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works of \u015a\u0101ntideva", "Other Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works of \u015a\u0101ntideva": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra of \u015a\u0101ntideva with the\nCommentary Pa\u00f1jik\u0101 of Praj\u00f1\u0101karamati</em>,\nfirst edition, P.L.
