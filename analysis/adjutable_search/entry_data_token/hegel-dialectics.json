In what is perhaps the most classic\nversion of \u201cdialectics\u201d, the ancient Greek philosopher,\nPlato (see entry on\n Plato),\n for instance, presented his philosophical argument as a\nback-and-forth dialogue or debate, generally between the character of\nSocrates, on one side, and some person or group of people to whom\nSocrates was talking (his interlocutors), on the other. In the course\nof the dialogues, Socrates\u2019 interlocutors propose definitions of\nphilosophical concepts or express views that Socrates challenges or\nopposes. The back-and-forth debate between opposing sides produces a\nkind of linear progression or evolution in philosophical views or\npositions: as the dialogues go along, Socrates\u2019 interlocutors\nchange or refine their views in response to Socrates\u2019 challenges\nand come to adopt more sophisticated views. The back-and-forth\ndialectic between Socrates and his interlocutors thus becomes\nPlato\u2019s way of arguing against the earlier, less sophisticated\nviews or positions and for the more sophisticated ones later.\n\n\u201cHegel\u2019s dialectics\u201d refers to the particular\ndialectical method of argument employed by the 19th Century German\nphilosopher, G.W.F. Hegel (see entry on\n Hegel),\n which, like other \u201cdialectical\u201d methods, relies on a\ncontradictory process between opposing sides. Whereas Plato\u2019s\n\u201copposing sides\u201d were people (Socrates and his\ninterlocutors), however, what the \u201copposing sides\u201d are in\nHegel\u2019s work depends on the subject matter he discusses. In his\nwork on logic, for instance, the \u201copposing sides\u201d are\ndifferent definitions of logical concepts that are opposed to one\nanother. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, which presents\nHegel\u2019s epistemology or philosophy of knowledge, the\n\u201copposing sides\u201d are different definitions of\nconsciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or\nclaims to know. As in Plato\u2019s dialogues, a contradictory process\nbetween \u201copposing sides\u201d in Hegel\u2019s dialectics leads\nto a linear evolution or development from less sophisticated\ndefinitions or views to more sophisticated ones later. The dialectical\nprocess thus constitutes Hegel\u2019s method for arguing against the\nearlier, less sophisticated definitions or views and for the more\nsophisticated ones later. Hegel regarded this dialectical method or\n\u201cspeculative mode of cognition\u201d (PR \u00a710) as the\nhallmark of his philosophy and used the same method in the\nPhenomenology of Spirit [PhG], as well as in all of the\nmature works he published later\u2014the entire Encyclopaedia of\nPhilosophical Sciences (including, as its first part, the\n\u201cLesser Logic\u201d or the Encyclopaedia Logic [EL]),\nthe Science of Logic [SL], and the Philosophy of\nRight [PR].\n\nNote that, although Hegel acknowledged that his dialectical method was\npart of a philosophical tradition stretching back to Plato, he\ncriticized Plato\u2019s version of dialectics. He argued that\nPlato\u2019s dialectics deals only with limited philosophical claims\nand is unable to get beyond skepticism or nothingness (SL-M\n55\u20136; SL-dG 34\u20135; PR, Remark to \u00a731). According to\nthe logic of a traditional reductio ad absurdum argument, if\nthe premises of an argument lead to a contradiction, we must conclude\nthat the premises are false\u2014which leaves us with no premises or\nwith nothing. We must then wait around for new premises to spring up\narbitrarily from somewhere else, and then see whether those new\npremises put us back into nothingness or emptiness once again, if\nthey, too, lead to a contradiction. Because Hegel believed that reason\nnecessarily generates contradictions, as we will see, he thought new\npremises will indeed produce further contradictions. As he puts the\nargument, then, \n\n\nthe scepticism that ends up with the bare abstraction of nothingness\nor emptiness cannot get any further from there, but must wait to see\nwhether something new comes along and what it is, in order to throw it\ntoo into the same empty abyss. (PhG-M \u00a779) \n\n\nHegel argues that, because Plato\u2019s dialectics cannot get beyond\narbitrariness and skepticism, it generates only approximate truths,\nand falls short of being a genuine science (SL-M 55\u20136; SL-dG\n34\u20135; PR, Remark to \u00a731; cf. EL Remark to \u00a781). The\nfollowing sections examine Hegel\u2019s dialectics as well as these\nissues in more detail.\n", "toc": [{"#HegeDescHisDialMeth": "1.

Hegel\u2019s description of his dialectical method\n\nHegel provides the most extensive, general account of his dialectical\nmethod in Part I of his Encyclopaedia of Philosophical\nSciences, which is often called the Encyclopaedia Logic\n[EL]. The form or presentation of logic, he says, has three sides or\nmoments (EL \u00a779). These sides are not parts of logic, but,\nrather, moments of \u201cevery concept\u201d, as well as \u201cof\neverything true in general\u201d (EL Remark to \u00a779; we will see\nwhy Hegel thought dialectics is in everything in\n section 3).\n The first moment\u2014the moment of the understanding\u2014is the\nmoment of fixity, in which concepts or forms have a seemingly stable\ndefinition or determination (EL \u00a780).\n\nThe second moment\u2014the \u201cdialectical\u201d (EL\n\u00a7\u00a779, 81) or \u201cnegatively rational\u201d (EL\n\u00a779) moment\u2014is the moment of instability. In this moment, a\none-sidedness or restrictedness (EL Remark to \u00a781) in the\ndetermination from the moment of understanding comes to the fore, and\nthe determination that was fixed in the first moment passes into its\nopposite (EL \u00a781). Hegel describes this process as a process of\n\u201cself-sublation\u201d (EL \u00a781). The English verb \u201cto\nsublate\u201d translates Hegel\u2019s technical use of the German\nverb aufheben, which is a crucial concept in his dialectical\nmethod. Hegel says that aufheben has a doubled meaning: it\nmeans both to cancel (or negate) and to preserve at the same time (PhG\n\u00a7113; SL-M 107; SL-dG 81\u20132; cf. EL the Addition to\n\u00a795). The moment of understanding sublates itself\nbecause its own character or nature\u2014its one-sidedness or\nrestrictedness\u2014destabilizes its definition and leads it to pass\ninto its opposite. The dialectical moment thus involves a process of\nself-sublation, or a process in which the determination from\nthe moment of understanding sublates itself, or both cancels\nand preserves itself, as it pushes on to or passes into its\nopposite.\n\nThe third moment\u2014the \u201cspeculative\u201d or\n\u201cpositively rational\u201d (EL \u00a7\u00a779, 82)\nmoment\u2014grasps the unity of the opposition between the first two\ndeterminations, or is the positive result of the dissolution or\ntransition of those determinations (EL \u00a782 and Remark to\n\u00a782). Here, Hegel rejects the traditional, reductio ad\nabsurdum argument, which says that when the premises of an\nargument lead to a contradiction, then the premises must be discarded\naltogether, leaving nothing. As Hegel suggests in the\nPhenomenology, such an argument \n\n\nis just the skepticism which only ever sees pure nothingness in its\nresult and abstracts from the fact that this nothingness is\nspecifically the nothingness of that from which it results.\n(PhG-M \u00a779) \n\n\nAlthough the speculative moment negates the contradiction, it is a\ndeterminate or defined nothingness because it is the result of a\nspecific process. There is something particular about the\ndetermination in the moment of understanding\u2014a specific\nweakness, or some specific aspect that was ignored in its\none-sidedness or restrictedness\u2014that leads it to fall apart in\nthe dialectical moment. The speculative moment has a definition,\ndetermination or content because it grows out of and unifies the\nparticular character of those earlier determinations, or is \u201ca\nunity of distinct determinations\u201d (EL Remark to\n\u00a782). The speculative moment is thus \u201ctruly not empty,\nabstract nothing, but the negation of certain\ndeterminations\u201d (EL-GSH \u00a782). When the result\n\u201cis taken as the result of that from which it emerges\u201d,\nHegel says, then it is \u201cin fact, the true result; in that case\nit is itself a determinate nothingness, one which has a\ncontent\u201d (PhG-M \u00a779). As he also puts it, \u201cthe result\nis conceived as it is in truth, namely, as a determinate\nnegation [bestimmte Negation]; a new form has thereby\nimmediately arisen\u201d (PhG-M \u00a779). Or, as he says,\n\u201c[b]ecause the result, the negation, is a determinate\nnegation [bestimmte Negation], it has a\ncontent\u201d (SL-dG 33; cf. SL-M 54). Hegel\u2019s claim\nin both the Phenomenology and the Science of Logic\nthat his philosophy relies on a process of \u201cdeterminate\nnegation [bestimmte Negation]\u201d has sometimes led\nscholars to describe his dialectics as a method or doctrine of\n\u201cdeterminate negation\u201d (see entry on\n Hegel, section on Science of Logic;\n cf. Rosen 1982: 30; Stewart 1996, 2000: 41\u20133; Winfield 1990:\n56).\n\nThere are several features of this account that Hegel thinks raise his\ndialectical method above the arbitrariness of Plato\u2019s dialectics\nto the level of a genuine science. First, because the determinations\nin the moment of understanding sublate themselves,\nHegel\u2019s dialectics does not require some new idea to show up\narbitrarily. Instead, the movement to new determinations is driven by\nthe nature of the earlier determinations and so \u201ccomes about on\nits own accord\u201d (PhG-P \u00a779). Indeed, for Hegel, the\nmovement is driven by necessity (see, e.g., EL Remarks to\n\u00a7\u00a712, 42, 81, 87, 88; PhG \u00a779). The natures of the\ndeterminations themselves drive or force them to pass into\ntheir opposites. This sense of necessity\u2014the idea that\nthe method involves being forced from earlier moments to later\nones\u2014leads Hegel to regard his dialectics as a kind of\nlogic. As he says in the Phenomenology, the\nmethod\u2019s \u201cproper exposition belongs to logic\u201d (PhG-M\n\u00a748). Necessity\u2014the sense of being driven or forced to\nconclusions\u2014is the hallmark of \u201clogic\u201d in Western\nphilosophy.\n\nSecond, because the form or determination that arises is the\nresult of the self-sublation of the determination from the\nmoment of understanding, there is no need for some new idea to show up\nfrom the outside. Instead, the transition to the new determination or\nform is necessitated by earlier moments and hence grows out of the\nprocess itself. Unlike in Plato\u2019s arbitrary dialectics,\nthen\u2014which must wait around until some other idea comes in from\nthe outside\u2014in Hegel\u2019s dialectics \u201cnothing\nextraneous is introduced\u201d, as he says (SL-M 54; cf. SL-dG 33).\nHis dialectics is driven by the nature, immanence or\n\u201cinwardness\u201d of its own content (SL-M 54; cf. SL-dG 33;\ncf. PR \u00a731). As he puts it, dialectics is \u201cthe principle\nthrough which alone immanent coherence and necessity enter\ninto the content of science\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to \u00a781).\n\nThird, because later determinations \u201csublate\u201d earlier\ndeterminations, the earlier determinations are not completely\ncancelled or negated. On the contrary, the earlier determinations are\npreserved in the sense that they remain in effect within the\nlater determinations. When Being-for-itself, for instance, is\nintroduced in the logic as the first concept of ideality or\nuniversality and is defined by embracing a set of\n\u201csomething-others\u201d, Being-for-itself replaces the\nsomething-others as the new concept, but those something-others remain\nactive within the definition of the concept of Being-for-itself. The\nsomething-others must continue to do the work of picking out\nindividual somethings before the concept of Being-for-itself can have\nits own definition as the concept that gathers them up.\nBeing-for-itself replaces the something-others, but it also preserves\nthem, because its definition still requires them to do their work of\npicking out individual somethings (EL \u00a7\u00a795\u20136).\n\nThe concept of \u201capple\u201d, for example, as a\nBeing-for-itself, would be defined by gathering up individual\n\u201csomethings\u201d that are the same as one another (as apples).\nEach individual apple can be what it is (as an apple) only in relation\nto an \u201cother\u201d that is the same \u201csomething\u201d\nthat it is (i.e., an apple). That is the one-sidedness or\nrestrictedness that leads each \u201csomething\u201d to pass into\nits \u201cother\u201d or opposite. The \u201csomethings\u201d are\nthus both \u201csomething-others\u201d. Moreover, their defining\nprocesses lead to an endless process of passing back and forth into\none another: one \u201csomething\u201d can be what it is (as an\napple) only in relation to another \u201csomething\u201d that is the\nsame as it is, which, in turn, can be what it is (an apple) only in\nrelation to the other \u201csomething\u201d that is the same as it\nis, and so on, back and forth, endlessly (cf. EL \u00a795). The\nconcept of \u201capple\u201d, as a Being-for-itself, stops that\nendless, passing-over process by embracing or including the individual\nsomething-others (the apples) in its content. It grasps or captures\ntheir character or quality as apples. But the\n\u201csomething-others\u201d must do their work of picking out and\nseparating those individual items (the apples) before the\nconcept of \u201capple\u201d\u2014as the Being-for-itself\u2014can\ngather them up for its own definition. We can picture the concept of\nBeing-for-itself like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nLater concepts thus replace, but also preserve, earlier concepts.\n\nFourth, later concepts both determine and also surpass the limits or\nfinitude of earlier concepts. Earlier determinations sublate\nthemselves\u2014they pass into their others because of some\nweakness, one-sidedness or restrictedness in their own definitions.\nThere are thus limitations in each of the determinations that lead\nthem to pass into their opposites. As Hegel says, \u201cthat is what\neverything finite is: its own sublation\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to\n\u00a781). Later determinations define the finiteness of the earlier\ndeterminations. From the point of view of the concept of\nBeing-for-itself, for instance, the concept of a\n\u201csomething-other\u201d is limited or finite: although the\nsomething-others are supposed to be the same as one another, the\ncharacter of their sameness (e.g., as apples) is captured only from\nabove, by the higher-level, more universal concept of\nBeing-for-itself. Being-for-itself reveals the limitations of the\nconcept of a \u201csomething-other\u201d. It also rises above those\nlimitations, since it can do something that the concept of a\nsomething-other cannot do. Dialectics thus allows us to get beyond the\nfinite to the universal. As Hegel puts it, \u201call genuine,\nnonexternal elevation above the finite is to be found in this\nprinciple [of dialectics]\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to \u00a781).\n\nFifth, because the determination in the speculative moment grasps the\nunity of the first two moments, Hegel\u2019s dialectical\nmethod leads to concepts or forms that are increasingly comprehensive\nand universal. As Hegel puts it, the result of the dialectical process\n\n\n\nis a new concept but one higher and richer than the\npreceding\u2014richer because it negates or opposes the preceding and\ntherefore contains it, and it contains even more than that, for it is\nthe unity of itself and its opposite. (SL-dG 33; cf. SL-M 54) \n\n\nLike Being-for-itself, later concepts are more universal because they\nunify or are built out of earlier determinations, and include\nthose earlier determinations as part of their definitions. Indeed,\nmany other concepts or determinations can also be depicted as\nliterally surrounding earlier ones (cf. Maybee 2009: 73, 100, 112,\n156, 193, 214, 221, 235, 458).\n\nFinally, because the dialectical process leads to increasing\ncomprehensiveness and universality, it ultimately produces a complete\nseries, or drives \u201cto completion\u201d (SL-dG 33; cf. SL-M 54;\nPhG \u00a779). Dialectics drives to the \u201cAbsolute\u201d, to use\nHegel\u2019s term, which is the last, final, and completely\nall-encompassing or unconditioned concept or form in the relevant\nsubject matter under discussion (logic, phenomenology, ethics/politics\nand so on). The \u201cAbsolute\u201d concept or form is\nunconditioned because its definition or determination contains all the\nother concepts or forms that were developed earlier in the dialectical\nprocess for that subject matter. Moreover, because the process\ndevelops necessarily and comprehensively through each concept, form or\ndetermination, there are no determinations that are left out of the\nprocess. There are therefore no left-over concepts or\nforms\u2014concepts or forms outside of the\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d\u2014that might \u201ccondition\u201d or\ndefine it. The \u201cAbsolute\u201d is thus unconditioned because it\ncontains all of the conditions in its content, and is not conditioned\nby anything else outside of it. This Absolute is the highest concept\nor form of universality for that subject matter. It is the thought or\nconcept of the whole conceptual system for the relevant subject\nmatter. We can picture the Absolute Idea (EL \u00a7236), for\ninstance\u2014which is the \u201cAbsolute\u201d for logic\u2014as\nan oval that is filled up with and surrounds numerous, embedded rings\nof smaller ovals and circles, which represent all of the earlier and\nless universal determinations from the logical development (cf. Maybee\n2009: 30, 600):\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nSince the \u201cAbsolute\u201d concepts for each subject matter lead\ninto one another, when they are taken together, they constitute\nHegel\u2019s entire philosophical system, which, as Hegel says,\n\u201cpresents itself therefore as a circle of circles\u201d (EL-GSH\n\u00a715). We can picture the entire system like this (cf. Maybee\n2009: 29):\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nTogether, Hegel believes, these characteristics make his dialectical\nmethod genuinely scientific. As he says, \u201cthe dialectical\nconstitutes the moving soul of scientific progression\u201d (EL-GSH\nRemark to \u00a781). He acknowledges that a description of the method\ncan be more or less complete and detailed, but because the method or\nprogression is driven only by the subject matter itself, this\ndialectical method is the \u201conly true method\u201d (SL-M 54;\nSL-dG 33).\n2. Applying Hegel\u2019s dialectical method to his arguments\n\nSo far, we have seen how Hegel describes his dialectical method, but\nwe have yet to see how we might read this method into the arguments he\noffers in his works. Scholars often use the first three stages of the\nlogic as the \u201ctextbook example\u201d (Forster 1993: 133) to\nillustrate how Hegel\u2019s dialectical method should be applied to\nhis arguments. The logic begins with the simple and immediate concept\nof pure Being, which is said to illustrate the moment of the\nunderstanding. We can think of Being here as a concept of pure\npresence. It is not mediated by any other concept\u2014or is not\ndefined in relation to any other concept\u2014and so is undetermined\nor has no further determination (EL \u00a786; SL-M 82; SL-dG 59). It\nasserts bare presence, but what that presence is like has no further\ndetermination. Because the thought of pure Being is undetermined and\nso is a pure abstraction, however, it is really no different from the\nassertion of pure negation or the absolutely negative (EL \u00a787).\nIt is therefore equally a Nothing (SL-M 82; SL-dG 59). Being\u2019s\nlack of determination thus leads it to sublate itself and pass into\nthe concept of Nothing (EL \u00a787; SL-M 82; SL-dG 59), which\nillustrates the dialectical moment.\n\nBut if we focus for a moment on the definitions of Being and Nothing\nthemselves, their definitions have the same content. Indeed, both are\nundetermined, so they have the same kind of undefined content. The\nonly difference between them is \u201csomething merely\nmeant\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to \u00a787), namely, that Being is\nan undefined content, taken as or meant to be presence, while Nothing\nis an undefined content, taken as or meant to be absence. The third\nconcept of the logic\u2014which is used to illustrate the speculative\nmoment\u2014unifies the first two moments by capturing the positive\nresult of\u2014or the conclusion that we can draw from\u2014the\nopposition between the first two moments. The concept of Becoming is\nthe thought of an undefined content, taken as presence (Being) and\nthen taken as absence (Nothing), or taken as absence (Nothing) and\nthen taken as presence (Being). To Become is to go from Being to\nNothing or from Nothing to Being, or is, as Hegel puts it, \u201cthe\nimmediate vanishing of the one in the other\u201d (SL-M 83; cf. SL-dG\n60). The contradiction between Being and Nothing thus is not a\nreductio ad absurdum, or does not lead to the rejection of\nboth concepts and hence to nothingness\u2014as Hegel had said\nPlato\u2019s dialectics does (SL-M 55\u20136; SL-dG\n34\u20135)\u2014but leads to a positive result, namely, to the\nintroduction of a new concept\u2014the synthesis\u2014which unifies\nthe two, earlier, opposed concepts.\n\nWe can also use the textbook Being-Nothing-Becoming example to\nillustrate Hegel\u2019s concept of aufheben (to sublate),\nwhich, as we saw, means to cancel (or negate) and to preserve at the\nsame time. Hegel says that the concept of Becoming sublates the\nconcepts of Being and Nothing (SL-M 105; SL-dG 80). Becoming cancels\nor negates Being and Nothing because it is a new concept that replaces\nthe earlier concepts; but it also preserves Being and Nothing because\nit relies on those earlier concepts for its own definition. Indeed, it\nis the first concrete concept in the logic. Unlike Being and Nothing,\nwhich had no definition or determination as concepts themselves and so\nwere merely abstract (SL-M 82\u20133; SL-dG 59\u201360; cf. EL\nAddition to \u00a788), Becoming is a \u201cdeterminate unity\nin which there is both Being and Nothing\u201d (SL-M 105;\ncf. SL-dG 80). Becoming succeeds in having a definition or\ndetermination because it is defined by, or piggy-backs on, the\nconcepts of Being and Nothing.\n\nThis \u201ctextbook\u201d Being-Nothing-Becoming example is closely\nconnected to the traditional idea that Hegel\u2019s dialectics\nfollows a thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern, which, when applied to\nthe logic, means that one concept is introduced as a\n\u201cthesis\u201d or positive concept, which then develops into a\nsecond concept that negates or is opposed to the first or is its\n\u201cantithesis\u201d, which in turn leads to a third concept, the\n\u201csynthesis\u201d, that unifies the first two (see, e.g.,\nMcTaggert 1964 [1910]: 3\u20134; Mure 1950: 302; Stace, 1955 [1924]:\n90\u20133, 125\u20136; Kosek 1972: 243; E. Harris 1983: 93\u20137;\nSinger 1983: 77\u201379). Versions of this interpretation of\nHegel\u2019s dialectics continue to have currency (e.g., Forster\n1993: 131; Stewart 2000: 39, 55; Fritzman 2014: 3\u20135). On this\nreading, Being is the positive moment or thesis, Nothing is the\nnegative moment or antithesis, and Becoming is the moment of\naufheben or synthesis\u2014the concept that cancels and\npreserves, or unifies and combines, Being and Nothing.\n\nWe must be careful, however, not to apply this textbook example too\ndogmatically to the rest of Hegel\u2019s logic or to his dialectical\nmethod more generally (for a classic criticism of the\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis reading of Hegel\u2019s dialectics, see\nMueller 1958). There are other places where this general pattern might\ndescribe some of the transitions from stage to stage, but there are\nmany more places where the development does not seem to fit this\npattern very well. One place where the pattern seems to hold, for\ninstance, is where the Measure (EL \u00a7107)\u2014as the combination\nof Quality and Quantity\u2014transitions into the Measureless (EL\n\u00a7107), which is opposed to it, which then in turn transitions\ninto Essence, which is the unity or combination of the two earlier\nsides (EL \u00a7111). This series of transitions could be said to\nfollow the general pattern captured by the \u201ctextbook\nexample\u201d: Measure would be the moment of the understanding or\nthesis, the Measureless would be the dialectical moment or antithesis,\nand Essence would be the speculative moment or synthesis that unifies\nthe two earlier moments. However, before the transition to Essence\ntakes place, the Measureless itself is redefined as a Measure (EL\n\u00a7109)\u2014undercutting a precise parallel with the textbook\nBeing-Nothing-Becoming example, since the transition from Measure to\nEssence would not follow a Measure-Measureless-Essence pattern, but\nrather a Measure-(Measureless?)-Measure-Essence pattern.\n\nOther sections of Hegel\u2019s philosophy do not fit the triadic,\ntextbook example of Being-Nothing-Becoming at all, as even\ninterpreters who have supported the traditional reading of\nHegel\u2019s dialectics have noted. After using the\nBeing-Nothing-Becoming example to argue that Hegel\u2019s dialectical\nmethod consists of \u201ctriads\u201d whose members \u201care\ncalled the thesis, antithesis, synthesis\u201d (Stace 1955 [1924]:\n93), W.T. Stace, for instance, goes on to warn us that Hegel does not\nsucceed in applying this pattern throughout the philosophical system.\nIt is hard to see, Stace says, how the middle term of some of\nHegel\u2019s triads are the opposites or antitheses of the first\nterm, \u201cand there are even \u2018triads\u2019 which contain\nfour terms!\u201d (Stace 1955 [1924]: 97). As a matter of fact, one\nsection of Hegel\u2019s logic\u2014the section on\nCognition\u2014violates the thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern\nbecause it has only two sub-divisions, rather than three. \u201cThe\ntriad is incomplete\u201d, Stace complains. \u201cThere is no third.\nHegel here abandons the triadic method. Nor is any explanation of his\nhaving done so forthcoming\u201d (Stace 1955 [1924]: 286; cf.\nMcTaggart 1964 [1910]: 292).\n\nInterpreters have offered various solutions to the complaint that\nHegel\u2019s dialectics sometimes seems to violate the triadic form.\nSome scholars apply the triadic form fairly loosely across several\nstages (e.g. Burbidge 1981: 43\u20135; Taylor 1975: 229\u201330).\nOthers have applied Hegel\u2019s triadic method to whole sections of\nhis philosophy, rather than to individual stages. For G.R.G. Mure, for\ninstance, the section on Cognition fits neatly into a triadic,\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis account of dialectics because the whole\nsection is itself the antithesis of the previous section of\nHegel\u2019s logic, the section on Life (Mure 1950: 270). Mure argues\nthat Hegel\u2019s triadic form is easier to discern the more broadly\nwe apply it. \u201cThe triadic form appears on many scales\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cand the larger the scale we consider the more obvious it\nis\u201d (Mure 1950: 302).\n\nScholars who interpret Hegel\u2019s description of dialectics on a\nsmaller scale\u2014as an account of how to get from stage to\nstage\u2014have also tried to explain why some sections seem to\nviolate the triadic form. J.N. Findlay, for instance\u2014who, like\nStace, associates dialectics \u201cwith the triad, or with\ntriplicity\u201d\u2014argues that stages can fit into that\nform in \u201cmore than one sense\u201d (Findlay 1962: 66). The\nfirst sense of triplicity echoes the textbook, Being-Nothing-Becoming\nexample. In a second sense, however, Findlay says, the dialectical\nmoment or \u201ccontradictory breakdown\u201d is not itself a\nseparate stage, or \u201cdoes not count as one of the stages\u201d,\nbut is a transition between opposed, \u201cbut complementary\u201d,\nabstract stages that \u201care developed more or less\nconcurrently\u201d (Findlay 1962: 66). This second sort of triplicity\ncould involve any number of stages: it \u201ccould readily have been\nexpanded into a quadruplicity, a quintuplicity and so forth\u201d\n(Findlay 1962: 66). Still, like Stace, he goes on to complain that\nmany of the transitions in Hegel\u2019s philosophy do not seem to fit\nthe triadic pattern very well. In some triads, the second term is\n\u201cthe direct and obvious contrary of the first\u201d\u2014as in\nthe case of Being and Nothing. In other cases, however, the opposition\nis, as Findlay puts it, \u201cof a much less extreme character\u201d\n(Findlay 1962: 69). In some triads, the third term obviously mediates\nbetween the first two terms. In other cases, however, he says, the\nthird term is just one possible mediator or unity among other possible\nones; and, in yet other cases, \u201cthe reconciling functions of the\nthird member are not at all obvious\u201d (Findlay 1962: 70).\n\nLet us look more closely at one place where the \u201ctextbook\nexample\u201d of Being-Nothing-Becoming does not seem to describe the\ndialectical development of Hegel\u2019s logic very well. In a later\nstage of the logic, the concept of Purpose goes through several\niterations, from Abstract Purpose (EL \u00a7204), to Finite or\nImmediate Purpose (EL \u00a7205), and then through several stages of a\nsyllogism (EL \u00a7206) to Realized Purpose (EL \u00a7210). Abstract\nPurpose is the thought of any kind of purposiveness, where the purpose\nhas not been further determined or defined. It includes not just the\nkinds of purposes that occur in consciousness, such as needs or\ndrives, but also the \u201cinternal purposiveness\u201d or\nteleological view proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle\n(see entry on\n Aristotle;\n EL Remark to \u00a7204), according to which things in the world have\nessences and aim to achieve (or have the purpose of living up to)\ntheir essences. Finite Purpose is the moment in which an Abstract\nPurpose begins to have a determination by fixing on some particular\nmaterial or content through which it will be realized (EL \u00a7205).\nThe Finite Purpose then goes through a process in which it, as the\nUniversality, comes to realize itself as the Purpose over the\nparticular material or content (and hence becomes Realized Purpose) by\npushing out into Particularity, then into Singularity (the syllogism\nU-P-S), and ultimately into \u2018out-thereness,\u2019 or into\nindividual objects out there in the world (EL \u00a7210; cf. Maybee\n2009: 466\u2013493).\n\nHegel\u2019s description of the development of Purpose does not seem\nto fit the textbook Being-Nothing-Becoming example or the\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis model. According to the example and model,\nAbstract Purpose would be the moment of understanding or thesis,\nFinite Purpose would be the dialectical moment or antithesis, and\nRealized Purpose would be the speculative moment or synthesis.\nAlthough Finite Purpose has a different determination from\nAbstract Purpose (it refines the definition of Abstract Purpose), it\nis hard to see how it would qualify as strictly \u201copposed\u201d\nto or as the \u201cantithesis\u201d of Abstract Purpose in the way\nthat Nothing is opposed to or is the antithesis of Being.\n\nThere is an answer, however, to the criticism that many of the\ndeterminations are not \u201copposites\u201d in a strict sense. The\nGerman term that is translated as \u201copposite\u201d in\nHegel\u2019s description of the moments of dialectics (EL\n\u00a7\u00a781, 82)\u2014entgegensetzen\u2014has three root\nwords: setzen (\u201cto posit or set\u201d),\ngegen, (\u201cagainst\u201d), and the prefix ent-,\nwhich indicates that something has entered into a new state. The verb\nentgegensetzen can therefore literally be translated as\n\u201cto set over against\u201d. The\n\u201cengegengesetzte\u201d into which determinations pass,\nthen, do not need to be the strict \u201copposites\u201d of the\nfirst, but can be determinations that are merely \u201cset\nagainst\u201d or are different from the first ones. And the prefix\nent-, which suggests that the first determinations are put\ninto a new state, can be explained by Hegel\u2019s claim that the\nfinite determinations from the moment of understanding sublate (cancel\nbut also preserve) themselves (EL \u00a781): later determinations put\nearlier determinations into a new state by preserving\nthem.\n\nAt the same time, there is a technical sense in which a later\ndetermination would still be the \u201copposite\u201d of the earlier\ndetermination. Since the second determination is different from the\nfirst one, it is the logical negation of the first one, or is\nnot-the-first-determination. If the first determination is\n\u201ce\u201d, for instance, because the new determination is\ndifferent from that one, the new one is \u201cnot-e\u201d (Kosek\n1972: 240). Since Finite Purpose, for instance, has a definition or\ndetermination that is different from the definition that Abstract\nPurpose has, it is not-Abstract-Purpose, or is the negation\nor opposite of Abstract Purpose in that sense. There is therefore a\ntechnical, logical sense in which the second concept or form is the\n\u201copposite\u201d or negation of\u2014or is\n\u201cnot\u201d\u2014the first one\u2014though, again, it need not\nbe the \u201copposite\u201d of the first one in a strict sense.\n\nOther problems remain, however. Because the concept of Realized\nPurpose is defined through a syllogistic process, it is itself the\nproduct of several stages of development (at least four, by my count,\nif Realized Purpose counts as a separate determination), which would\nseem to violate a triadic model. Moreover, the concept of Realized\nPurpose does not, strictly speaking, seem to be the unity or\ncombination of Abstract Purpose and Finite Purpose. Realized Purpose\nis the result of (and so unifies) the syllogistic process of Finite\nPurpose, through which Finite Purpose focuses on and is realized in a\nparticular material or content. Realized Purpose thus seems to be a\ndevelopment of Finite Purpose, rather than a unity or combination of\nAbstract Purpose and Finite Purpose, in the way that Becoming can be\nsaid to be the unity or combination of Being and Nothing.\n\nThese sorts of considerations have led some scholars to interpret\nHegel\u2019s dialectics in a way that is implied by a more literal\nreading of his claim, in the Encyclopaedia Logic, that the\nthree \u201csides\u201d of the form of logic\u2014namely, the\nmoment of understanding, the dialectical moment, and the speculative\nmoment\u2014\u201care moments of each [or every;\njedes] logically-real, that is each [or every;\njedes] concept\u201d (EL Remark to \u00a779; this is an\nalternative translation). The quotation suggests that each\nconcept goes through all three moments of the dialectical\nprocess\u2014a suggestion reinforced by Hegel\u2019s claim, in the\nPhenomenology, that the result of the process of determinate\nnegation is that \u201ca new form has thereby immediately\narisen\u201d (PhG-M \u00a779). According to this interpretation, the\nthree \u201csides\u201d are not three different concepts or forms\nthat are related to one another in a triad\u2014as the textbook\nBeing-Nothing-Becoming example suggests\u2014but rather different\nmomentary sides or \u201cdeterminations\u201d in the life, so to\nspeak, of each concept or form as it transitions to the next\none. The three moments thus involve only two concepts or forms: the\none that comes first, and the one that comes next (examples of\nphilosophers who interpret Hegel\u2019s dialectics in this second way\ninclude Maybee 2009; Priest 1989: 402; Rosen 2014: 122, 132; and\nWinfield 1990: 56).\n\nFor the concept of Being, for example, its moment of understanding is\nits moment of stability, in which it is asserted to be pure presence.\nThis determination is one-sided or restricted however, because, as we\nsaw, it ignores another aspect of Being\u2019s definition, namely,\nthat Being has no content or determination, which is how Being is\ndefined in its dialectical moment. Being thus sublates itself\nbecause the one-sidedness of its moment of understanding undermines\nthat determination and leads to the definition it has in the\ndialectical moment. The speculative moment draws out the implications\nof these moments: it asserts that Being (as pure presence) implies\nnothing. It is also the \u201cunity of the determinations in their\ncomparison [Entgegensetzung]\u201d (EL \u00a782; alternative\ntranslation): since it captures a process from one to the other, it\nincludes Being\u2019s moment of understanding (as pure presence) and\ndialectical moment (as nothing or undetermined), but also\ncompares those two determinations, or sets (-setzen)\nthem up against (-gegen) each other. It even puts Being into\na new state (as the prefix ent- suggests) because the next\nconcept, Nothing, will sublate (cancel and preserve)\nBeing.\n\nThe concept of Nothing also has all three moments. When it is asserted\nto be the speculative result of the concept of Being, it has its\nmoment of understanding or stability: it is Nothing, defined as pure\nabsence, as the absence of determination. But Nothing\u2019s moment\nof understanding is also one-sided or restricted: like Being, Nothing\nis also an undefined content, which is its determination in its\ndialectical moment. Nothing thus sublates itself: since it is\nan undefined content, it is not pure absence after all, but\nhas the same presence that Being did. It is present\nas an undefined content. Nothing thus sublates\nBeing: it replaces (cancels) Being, but also preserves Being insofar\nas it has the same definition (as an undefined content) and presence\nthat Being had. We can picture Being and Nothing like this (the\ncircles have dashed outlines to indicate that, as concepts, they are\neach undefined; cf. Maybee 2009: 51):\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nIn its speculative moment, then, Nothing implies presence or Being,\nwhich is the \u201cunity of the determinations in their comparison\n[Entgegensetzung]\u201d (EL \u00a782; alternative\ntranslation), since it both includes but\u2014as a process\nfrom one to the other\u2014also compares the two earlier\ndeterminations of Nothing, first, as pure absence and, second, as just\nas much presence.\n\nThe dialectical process is driven to the next concept or\nform\u2014Becoming\u2014not by a triadic,\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern, but by the one-sidedness of\nNothing\u2014which leads Nothing to sublate itself\u2014and by the\nimplications of the process so far. Since Being and Nothing have each\nbeen exhaustively analyzed as separate concepts, and since they are\nthe only concepts in play, there is only one way for the dialectical\nprocess to move forward: whatever concept comes next will have to take\naccount of both Being and Nothing at the same time. Moreover, the\nprocess revealed that an undefined content taken to be presence (i.e.,\nBeing) implies Nothing (or absence), and that an undefined content\ntaken to be absence (i.e., Nothing) implies presence (i.e., Being).\nThe next concept, then, takes Being and Nothing together and draws out\nthose implications\u2014namely, that Being implies Nothing, and that\nNothing implies Being. It is therefore Becoming, defined as two\nseparate processes: one in which Being becomes Nothing, and one in\nwhich Nothing becomes Being. We can picture Becoming this way (cf.\nMaybee 2009: 53):\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nIn a similar way, a one-sidedness or restrictedness in the\ndetermination of Finite Purpose together with the implications of\nearlier stages leads to Realized Purpose. In its moment of\nunderstanding, Finite Purpose particularizes into (or presents) its\ncontent as \u201csomething-presupposed\u201d or as a\npre-given object (EL \u00a7205). I go to a restaurant for the purpose\nof having dinner, for instance, and order a salad. My purpose of\nhaving dinner particularizes as a pre-given object\u2014the salad.\nBut this object or particularity\u2014e.g. the salad\u2014is\n\u201cinwardly reflected\u201d (EL \u00a7205): it has its own\ncontent\u2014developed in earlier stages\u2014which the definition\nof Finite Purpose ignores. We can picture Finite Purpose this way:\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nIn the dialectical moment, Finite Purpose is determined by the\npreviously ignored content, or by that other content. The\none-sidedness of Finite Purpose requires the dialectical process to\ncontinue through a series of syllogisms that determines Finite Purpose\nin relation to the ignored content. The first syllogism links the\nFinite Purpose to the first layer of content in the object: the\nPurpose or universality (e.g., dinner) goes through the particularity\n(e.g., the salad) to its content, the singularity (e.g., lettuce as a\ntype of thing)\u2014the syllogism U-P-S (EL \u00a7206). But the\nparticularity (e.g., the salad) is itself a universality or purpose,\n\u201cwhich at the same time is a syllogism within itself [in\nsich]\u201d (EL Remark to \u00a7208; alternative translation),\nin relation to its own content. The salad is a universality/purpose\nthat particularizes as lettuce (as a type of thing) and has its\nsingularity in this lettuce here\u2014a second syllogism, U-P-S.\nThus, the first singularity (e.g., \u201clettuce\u201d as a type of\nthing)\u2014which, in this second syllogism, is the particularity or\nP\u2014\u201cjudges\u201d (EL \u00a7207) or asserts\nthat \u201cU is S\u201d: it says that\n\u201clettuce\u201d as a universality (U) or type of thing is\na singularity (S), or is \u201cthis lettuce here\u201d, for\ninstance. This new singularity (e.g. \u201cthis lettuce here\u201d)\nis itself a combination of subjectivity and objectivity (EL\n\u00a7207): it is an Inner or identifying concept\n(\u201clettuce\u201d) that is in a mutually-defining relationship\n(the circular arrow) with an Outer or out-thereness (\u201cthis\nhere\u201d) as its content. In the speculative moment, Finite Purpose\nis determined by the whole process of development from the moment of\nunderstanding\u2014when it is defined by particularizing into a\npre-given object with a content that it ignores\u2014to its\ndialectical moment\u2014when it is also defined by the previously\nignored content. We can picture the speculative moment of Finite\nPurpose this way:\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nFinite Purpose\u2019s speculative moment leads to Realized Purpose.\nAs soon as Finite Purpose presents all the content, there is a return\nprocess (a series of return arrows) that establishes each layer and\nredefines Finite Purpose as Realized Purpose. The presence of\n\u201cthis lettuce here\u201d establishes the actuality of\n\u201clettuce\u201d as a type of thing (an Actuality is a concept\nthat captures a mutually-defining relationship between an Inner and an\nOuter [EL \u00a7142]), which establishes the \u201csalad\u201d,\nwhich establishes \u201cdinner\u201d as the Realized Purpose over\nthe whole process. We can picture Realized Purpose this way:\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nIf Hegel\u2019s account of dialectics is a general description of the\nlife of each concept or form, then any section can include as many or\nas few stages as the development requires. Instead of trying to\nsqueeze the stages into a triadic form (cf. Solomon 1983: 22)\u2014a\ntechnique Hegel himself rejects (PhG \u00a750; cf.\n section 3)\u2014we\n can see the process as driven by each determination on its own\naccount: what it succeeds in grasping (which allows it to be stable,\nfor a moment of understanding), what it fails to grasp or capture (in\nits dialectical moment), and how it leads (in its speculative moment)\nto a new concept or form that tries to correct for the one-sidedness\nof the moment of understanding. This sort of process might reveal a\nkind of argument that, as Hegel had promised, might produce a\ncomprehensive and exhaustive exploration of every concept, form or\ndetermination in each subject matter, as well as raise dialectics\nabove a haphazard analysis of various philosophical views to the level\nof a genuine science.\n3. Why does Hegel use dialectics?\n\nWe can begin to see why Hegel was motivated to use a dialectical\nmethod by examining the project he set for himself, particularly in\nrelation to the work of David Hume and Immanuel Kant (see entries on\n Hume\n and\n Kant).\n Hume had argued against what we can think of as the na\u00efve view\nof how we come to have scientific knowledge. According to the\nna\u00efve view, we gain knowledge of the world by using our senses to\npull the world into our heads, so to speak. Although we may have to\nuse careful observations and do experiments, our knowledge of the\nworld is basically a mirror or copy of what the world is like. Hume\nargued, however, that na\u00efve science\u2019s claim that our\nknowledge corresponds to or copies what the world is like does not\nwork. Take the scientific concept of cause, for instance. According to\nthat concept of cause, to say that one event causes another is to say\nthat there is a necessary connection between the first event (the\ncause) and the second event (the effect), such that, when the first\nevent happens, the second event must also happen. According to\nna\u00efve science, when we claim (or know) that some event\ncauses some other event, our claim mirrors or copies what the\nworld is like. It follows that the necessary, causal connection\nbetween the two events must itself be out there in the world. However,\nHume argued, we never observe any such necessary causal connection in\nour experience of the world, nor can we infer that one exists based on\nour reasoning (see Hume\u2019s A Treatise of Human Nature,\nBook I, Part III, Section II; Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, Section VII, Part I). There is nothing in the\nworld itself that our idea of cause mirrors or copies.\n\nKant thought Hume\u2019s argument led to an unacceptable, skeptical\nconclusion, and he rejected Hume\u2019s own solution to the\nskepticism (see Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, B5,\nB19\u201320). Hume suggested that our idea of causal necessity is\ngrounded merely in custom or habit, since it is generated by our own\nimaginations after repeated observations of one sort of event\nfollowing another sort of event (see Hume\u2019s A Treatise of\nHuman Nature, Book I, Section VI; Hegel also rejected\nHume\u2019s solution, see EL \u00a739). For Kant, science and\nknowledge should be grounded in reason, and he proposed a solution\nthat aimed to reestablish the connection between reason and knowledge\nthat was broken by Hume\u2019s skeptical argument. Kant\u2019s\nsolution involved proposing a Copernican revolution in philosophy\n(Critique of Pure Reason, Bxvi). Nicholas Copernicus was the\nPolish astronomer who said that the earth revolves around the sun,\nrather than the other way around. Kant proposed a similar solution to\nHume\u2019s skepticism. Na\u00efve science assumes that our knowledge\nrevolves around what the world is like, but, Hume\u2019s criticism\nargued, this view entails that we cannot then have knowledge of\nscientific causes through reason. We can reestablish a connection\nbetween reason and knowledge, however, Kant suggested, if we\nsay\u2014not that knowledge revolves around what the world is\nlike\u2014but that knowledge revolves around what we are\nlike. For the purposes of our knowledge, Kant said, we do not\nrevolve around the world\u2014the world revolves around us. Because\nwe are rational creatures, we share a cognitive structure with one\nanother that regularizes our experiences of the world. This\nintersubjectively shared structure of rationality\u2014and not the\nworld itself\u2014grounds our knowledge.\n\nHowever, Kant\u2019s solution to Hume\u2019s skepticism led to a\nskeptical conclusion of its own that Hegel rejected. While the\nintersubjectively shared structure of our reason might allow us to\nhave knowledge of the world from our perspective, so to speak, we\ncannot get outside of our mental, rational structures to see what the\nworld might be like in itself. As Kant had to admit, according to his\ntheory, there is still a world in itself or\n\u201cThing-in-itself\u201d (Ding an sich) about which we\ncan know nothing (see, e.g., Critique of Pure Reason,\nBxxv\u2013xxvi). Hegel rejected Kant\u2019s skeptical conclusion\nthat we can know nothing about the world- or Thing-in-itself, and he\nintended his own philosophy to be a response to this view (see, e.g.,\nEL \u00a744 and the Remark to \u00a744).\n\nHow did Hegel respond to Kant\u2019s skepticism\u2014especially\nsince Hegel accepted Kant\u2019s Copernican revolution, or\nKant\u2019s claim that we have knowledge of the world because of what\nwe are like, because of our reason? How, for Hegel, can we get out of\nour heads to see the world as it is in itself? Hegel\u2019s answer is\nvery close to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle\u2019s response\nto Plato. Plato argued that we have knowledge of the world only\nthrough the Forms. The Forms are perfectly universal, rational\nconcepts or ideas. Because the world is imperfect, however, Plato\nexiled the Forms to their own realm. Although things in the world get\ntheir definitions by participating in the Forms, those things are, at\nbest, imperfect copies of the universal Forms (see, e.g.,\nParmenides 131\u2013135a). The Forms are therefore not in\nthis world, but in a separate realm of their own. Aristotle argued,\nhowever, that the world is knowable not because things in the world\nare imperfect copies of the Forms, but because the Forms are in things\nthemselves as the defining essences of those things (see, e.g., De\nAnima [On the Soul], Book I, Chapter 1\n[403a26\u2013403b18]; Metaphysics, Book VII, Chapter 6\n[1031b6\u20131032a5] and Chapter 8 [1033b20\u20131034a8]).\n\nIn a similar way, Hegel\u2019s answer to Kant is that we can get out\nof our heads to see what the world is like in itself\u2014and hence\ncan have knowledge of the world in itself\u2014because the very same\nrationality or reason that is in our heads is in the world\nitself. As Hegel apparently put it in a lecture, the opposition\nor antithesis between the subjective and objective disappears by\nsaying, as the Ancients did, \n\n\nthat nous governs the world, or by our own saying that there\nis reason in the world, by which we mean that reason is the soul of\nthe world, inhabits it, and is immanent in it, as it own, innermost\nnature, its universal. (EL-GSH Addition 1 to \u00a724) \n\n\nHegel used an example familiar from Aristotle\u2019s work to\nillustrate this view: \n\n\n\u201cto be an animal\u201d, the kind considered as the universal,\npertains to the determinate animal and constitutes its determinate\nessentiality. If we were to deprive a dog of its animality we could\nnot say what it is. (EL-GSH Addition 1 to \u00a724; cf. SL-dG\n16\u201317, SL-M 36-37)\n\n\nKant\u2019s mistake, then, was that he regarded reason or rationality\nas only in our heads, Hegel suggests (EL \u00a7\u00a743\u201344),\nrather than in both us and the world itself (see also below in this\nsection and\n section 4).\n We can use our reason to have knowledge of the world because the very\nsame reason that is in us, is in the world itself as it own defining\nprinciple. The rationality or reason in the world makes reality\nunderstandable, and that is why we can have knowledge of, or can\nunderstand, reality with our rationality. Dialectics\u2014which is\nHegel\u2019s account of reason\u2014characterizes not only logic,\nbut also \u201ceverything true in general\u201d (EL Remark to\n\u00a779).\n\nBut why does Hegel come to define reason in terms of dialectics, and\nhence adopt a dialectical method? We can begin to see what drove Hegel\nto adopt a dialectical method by returning once again to Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy. Plato argued that we can have knowledge of the world only\nby grasping the Forms, which are perfectly universal, rational\nconcepts or ideas. Because things in the world are so imperfect,\nhowever, Plato concluded that the Forms are not in this world, but in\na realm of their own. After all, if a human being were perfectly\nbeautiful, for instance, then he or she would never become\nnot-beautiful. But human beings change, get old, and die, and so can\nbe, at best, imperfect copies of the Form of beauty\u2014though they\nget whatever beauty they have by participating in that Form. Moreover,\nfor Plato, things in the world are such imperfect copies that we\ncannot gain knowledge of the Forms by studying things in the world,\nbut only through reason, that is, only by using our rationality to\naccess the separate realm of the Forms (as Plato argued in the\nwell-known parable of the cave; Republic, Book 7,\n514\u2013516b).\n\nNotice, however, that Plato\u2019s conclusion that the Forms cannot\nbe in this world and so must be exiled to a separate realm rests on\ntwo claims. First, it rests on the claim that the world is an\nimperfect and messy place\u2014a claim that is hard to deny. But it\nalso rests on the assumption that the Forms\u2014the universal,\nrational concepts or ideas of reason itself\u2014are static and\nfixed, and so cannot grasp the messiness within the imperfect world.\nHegel is able to link reason back to our messy world by changing the\ndefinition of reason. Instead of saying that reason consists of static\nuniversals, concepts or ideas, Hegel says that the universal concepts\nor forms are themselves messy. Against Plato, Hegel\u2019s\ndialectical method allows him to argue that universal concepts can\n\u201covergrasp\u201d (from the German verb\n\u00fcbergreifen) the messy, dialectical nature of the world\nbecause they, themselves, are dialectical. Moreover, because\nlater concepts build on or sublate (cancel, but also preserve) earlier\nconcepts, the later, more universal concepts grasp the dialectical\nprocesses of earlier concepts. As a result, higher-level concepts can\ngrasp not only the dialectical nature of earlier concepts or forms,\nbut also the dialectical processes that make the world itself a messy\nplace. The highest definition of the concept of beauty, for instance,\nwould not take beauty to be fixed and static, but would include within\nit the dialectical nature or finiteness of beauty, the idea that\nbeauty becomes, on its own account, not-beauty. This dialectical\nunderstanding of the concept of beauty can then overgrasp the\ndialectical and finite nature of beauty in the world, and hence the\ntruth that, in the world, beautiful things themselves become\nnot-beautiful, or might be beautiful in one respect and not another.\nSimilarly, the highest determination of the concept of\n\u201ctree\u201d will include within its definition the dialectical\nprocess of development and change from seed to sapling to tree. As\nHegel says, dialectics is \u201cthe principle of all natural and\nspiritual life\u201d (SL-M 56; SL-dG 35), or \u201cthe moving soul\nof scientific progression\u201d (EL \u00a781). Dialectics is what\ndrives the development of both reason as well as of things in the\nworld. A dialectical reason can overgrasp a dialectical world.\n\nTwo further journeys into the history of philosophy will help to show\nwhy Hegel chose dialectics as his method of argument. As we saw, Hegel\nargues against Kant\u2019s skepticism by suggesting that reason is\nnot only in our heads, but in the world itself. To show that reason is\nin the world itself, however, Hegel has to show that reason can be\nwhat it is without us human beings to help it. He has to show that\nreason can develop on its own, and does not need us to do the\ndeveloping for it (at least for those things in the world that are not\nhuman-created). As we saw (cf.\n section 1),\n central to Hegel\u2019s dialectics is the idea that concepts or\nforms develop on their own because they \u201cself-sublate\u201d, or\nsublate (cancel and preserve) themselves, and so pass into\nsubsequent concepts or forms on their own accounts, because of their\nown, dialectical natures. Thus reason, as it were, drives itself, and\nhence does not need our heads to develop it. Hegel needs an account of\nself-driving reason to get beyond Kant\u2019s skepticism.\n\nIronically, Hegel derives the basic outlines of his account of\nself-driving reason from Kant. Kant divided human rationality into two\nfaculties: the faculty of the understanding and the faculty of reason.\nThe understanding uses concepts to organize and regularize our\nexperiences of the world. Reason\u2019s job is to coordinate the\nconcepts and categories of the understanding by developing a\ncompletely unified, conceptual system, and it does this work, Kant\nthought, on its own, independently of how those concepts might apply\nto the world. Reason coordinates the concepts of the understanding by\nfollowing out necessary chains of syllogisms to produce concepts that\nachieve higher and higher levels of conceptual unity. Indeed, this\nprocess will lead reason to produce its own transcendental ideas, or\nconcepts that go beyond the world of experience. Kant calls this\nnecessary, concept-creating reason \u201cspeculative\u201d reason\n(cf. Critique of Pure Reason, Bxx\u2013xxi, A327/B384).\nReason creates its own concepts or ideas\u2014it\n\u201cspeculates\u201d\u2014by generating new and increasingly\ncomprehensive concepts of its own, independently of the understanding.\nIn the end, Kant thought, reason will follow out such chains of\nsyllogisms until it develops completely comprehensive or unconditioned\nuniversals\u2014universals that contain all of the conditions or all\nof the less-comprehensive concepts that help to define them. As we saw\n(cf.\n section 1),\n Hegel\u2019s dialectics adopts Kant\u2019s notion of a self-driving\nand concept-creating \u201cspeculative\u201d reason, as well as\nKant\u2019s idea that reason aims toward unconditioned universality\nor absolute concepts.\n\nUltimately, Kant thought, reasons\u2019 necessary, self-driving\nactivity will lead it to produce contradictions\u2014what he called\nthe \u201cantinomies\u201d, which consist of a thesis and\nantithesis. Once reason has generated the unconditioned concept of the\nwhole world, for instance, Kant argued, it can look at the world in\ntwo, contradictory ways. In the first antinomy, reason can see the\nworld (1) as the whole totality or as the unconditioned, or (2) as the\nseries of syllogisms that led up to that totality. If reason sees the\nworld as the unconditioned or as a complete whole that is not\nconditioned by anything else, then it will see the world as having a\nbeginning and end in terms of space and time, and so will conclude\n(the thesis) that the world has a beginning and end or limit. But if\nreason sees the world as the series, in which each member of the\nseries is conditioned by the previous member, then the world will\nappear to be without a beginning and infinite, and reason will\nconclude (the antithesis) that the world does not have a limit in\nterms of space and time (cf. Critique of Pure Reason,\nA417\u201318/B445\u20136). Reason thus leads to a contradiction: it\nholds both that the world has a limit and that it does not have a\nlimit at the same time. Because reason\u2019s own process of\nself-development will lead it to develop contradictions or to be\ndialectical in this way, Kant thought that reason must be kept in\ncheck by the understanding. Any conclusions that reason draws that do\nnot fall within the purview of the understanding cannot be applied to\nthe world of experience, Kant said, and so cannot be considered\ngenuine knowledge (Critique of Pure Reason, A506/B534).\n\nHegel adopts Kant\u2019s dialectical conception of reason, but he\nliberates reason for knowledge from the tyranny of the understanding.\nKant was right that reason speculatively generates concepts on its\nown, and that this speculative process is driven by necessity and\nleads to concepts of increasing universality or comprehensiveness.\nKant was even right to suggest\u2014as he had shown in the discussion\nof the antinomies\u2014that reason is dialectical, or necessarily\nproduces contradictions on its own. Again, Kant\u2019s mistake was\nthat he fell short of saying that these contradictions are in the\nworld itself. He failed to apply the insights of his discussion of the\nantinomies to \u201cthings in themselves\u201d (SL-M 56;\nSL-dG 35; see also\n section 4).\n Indeed, Kant\u2019s own argument proves that the dialectical nature\nof reason can be applied to things themselves. The fact that reason\ndevelops those contradictions on its own, without our heads to\nhelp it, shows that those contradictions are not just in our\nheads, but are objective, or in the world itself. Kant, however,\nfailed to draw this conclusion, and continued to regard reason\u2019s\nconclusions as illusions. Still, Kant\u2019s philosophy vindicated\nthe general idea that the contradictions he took to be illusions are\nboth objective\u2014or out there in the world\u2014and necessary. As\nHegel puts it, Kant vindicates the general idea of \u201cthe\nobjectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the\ncontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought\ndeterminations\u201d (SL-M 56; cf. SL-dG 35), or to the nature of\nconcepts themselves.\n\nThe work of Johann Gottlieb Fichte (see entry on\n Fichte)\n showed Hegel how dialectics can get beyond Kant\u2014beyond the\ncontradictions that, as Kant had shown, reason (necessarily) develops\non its own, beyond the reductio ad absurdum argument (which,\nas we saw above, holds that a contradiction leads to nothingness), and\nbeyond Kant\u2019s skepticism, or Kant\u2019s claim that\nreason\u2019s contradictions must be reined in by the understanding\nand cannot count as knowledge. Fichte argued that the task of\ndiscovering the foundation of all human knowledge leads to a\ncontradiction or opposition between the self and the not-self (it is\nnot important, for our purposes, why Fichte held this view). The kind\nof reasoning that leads to this contradiction, Fichte said, is the\nanalytical or antithetical method of reasoning, which involves drawing\nout an opposition between elements (in this case, the self and\nnot-self) that are being compared to, or equated with, one another.\nWhile the traditional reductio ad absurdum argument would\nlead us to reject both sides of the contradiction and start from\nscratch, Fichte argued that the contradiction or opposition between\nthe self and not-self can be resolved. In particular, the\ncontradiction is resolved by positing a third concept\u2014the\nconcept of divisibility\u2014which unites the two sides (The\nScience of Knowledge, I: 110\u201311; Fichte 1982:\n108\u2013110). The concept of divisibility is produced by a synthetic\nprocedure of reasoning, which involves \u201cdiscovering in opposites\nthe respect in which they are alike\u201d (The Science\nof Knowledge, I: 112\u201313; Fichte 1982: 111). Indeed, Fichte\nargued, not only is the move to resolve contradictions with synthetic\nconcepts or judgments possible, it is necessary. As he says\nof the move from the contradiction between self and not-self to the\nsynthetic concept of divisibility, \n\n\nthere can be no further question as to the possibility of this\n[synthesis], nor can any ground for it be given; it is absolutely\npossible, and we are entitled to it without further grounds of any\nkind. (The Science of Knowledge, I: 114; Fichte 1982: 112)\n\n\n\nSince the analytical method leads to oppositions or contradictions, he\nargued, if we use only analytic judgments, \u201cwe not only do not\nget very far, as Kant says; we do not get anywhere at\nall\u201d (The Science of Knowledge, I: 113; Fichte 1982:\n112). Without the synthetic concepts or judgments, we are left, as the\nclassic reductio ad absurdum argument suggests, with nothing\nat all. The synthetic concepts or judgments are thus necessary to get\nbeyond contradiction without leaving us with nothing.\n\nFichte\u2019s account of the synthetic method provides Hegel with the\nkey to moving beyond Kant. Fichte suggested that a synthetic concept\nthat unifies the results of a dialectically-generated contradiction\ndoes not completely cancel the contradictory sides, but only limits\nthem. As he said, in general, \u201c[t]o limit something is\nto abolish its reality, not wholly, but in part\nonly\u201d (The Science of Knowledge, I: 108; Fichte 1982:\n108). Instead of concluding, as a reductio ad absurdum\nrequires, that the two sides of a contradiction must be dismissed\naltogether, the synthetic concept or judgment retroactively justifies\nthe opposing sides by demonstrating their limit, by showing which part\nof reality they attach to and which they do not (The Science of\nKnowledge, I: 108\u201310; Fichte 1982: 108\u20139), or by\ndetermining in what respect and to what degree they are each true. For\nHegel, as we saw (cf.\n section 1),\n later concepts and forms sublate\u2014both cancel and\npreserve\u2014earlier concepts and forms in the sense that\nthey include earlier concepts and forms in their own definitions. From\nthe point of view of the later concepts or forms, the earlier ones\nstill have some validity, that is, they have a limited validity or\ntruth defined by the higher-level concept or form.\n\nDialectically generated contradictions are therefore not a defect to\nbe reigned in by the understanding, as Kant had said, but invitations\nfor reason to \u201cspeculate\u201d, that is, for reason to generate\nprecisely the sort of increasingly comprehensive and universal\nconcepts and forms that Kant had said reason aims to develop.\nUltimately, Hegel thought, as we saw (cf.\n section 1),\n the dialectical process leads to a completely unconditioned concept\nor form for each subject matter\u2014the Absolute Idea (logic),\nAbsolute Spirit (phenomenology), Absolute Idea of right and law\n(Philosophy of Right), and so on\u2014which, taken together,\nform the \u201ccircle of circles\u201d (EL \u00a715) that\nconstitutes the whole philosophical system or \u201cIdea\u201d (EL\n\u00a715) that both overgrasps the world and makes it\nunderstandable (for us). \n\nNote that, while Hegel was clearly influenced by Fichte\u2019s work,\nhe never adopted Fichte\u2019s triadic\n\u201cthesis\u2014antithesis\u2014synthesis\u201d language in his\ndescriptions of his own philosophy (Mueller 1958: 411\u20132; Solomon\n1983: 23), though he did apparently use it in his lectures to describe\nKant\u2019s philosophy (LHP III: 477). Indeed, Hegel criticized\nformalistic uses of the method of \u201ctriplicity\n[Triplizit\u00e4t]\u201d (PhG-P \u00a750) inspired by Kant\u2014a\ncriticism that could well have been aimed at Fichte. Hegel argued that\nKantian-inspired uses of triadic form had been reduced to \u201ca\nlifeless schema\u201d and \u201can actual semblance\n[eigentlichen Scheinen]\u201d (PhG \u00a750; alternative\ntranslation) that, like a formula in mathematics, was simply imposed\non top of subject matters. Instead, a properly scientific use of\nKant\u2019s \u201ctriplicity\u201d should flow\u2014as he said his\nown dialectical method did (see\n section 1)\u2014out\n of \u201cthe inner life and self-movement\u201d (PhG \u00a751) of\nthe content. \n4. Is Hegel\u2019s dialectical method logical?\n\nScholars have often questioned whether Hegel\u2019s dialectical\nmethod is logical. Some of their skepticism grows out of the role that\ncontradiction plays in his thought and argument. While many of the\noppositions embedded in the dialectical development and the\ndefinitions of concepts or forms are not contradictions in the strict\nsense, as we saw\n (section 2,\n above), scholars such as Graham Priest have suggested that some of\nthem arguably are (Priest 1989: 391). Hegel even holds, against Kant\n(cf.\n section 3\n above), that there are contradictions, not only in thought, but also\nin the world. Motion, for instance, Hegel says, is an\n\u201cexistent contradiction\u201d. As he describes it:\n\n\nSomething moves, not because now it is here and there at another now,\nbut because in one and the same now it is here and not here, because\nin this here, it is and is not at the same time. (SL-dG 382; cf. SL-M\n440) \n\n\nKant\u2019s sorts of antinomies (cf.\n section 3\n above) or contradictions more generally are therefore, as Hegel puts\nit in one place, \u201cin all objects of all kinds, in\nall representations, concepts and ideas\u201d (EL-GSH Remark\nto \u00a748). Hegel thus seems to reject, as he himself explicitly\nclaims (SL-M 439\u201340; SL-dG 381\u201382), the law of\nnon-contradiction, which is a fundamental principle of formal\nlogic\u2014the classical, Aristotelian logic (see entries on\n Aristotle\u2019s Logic\n and\n Contradiction)\n that dominated during Hegel\u2019s lifetime as well as the dominant\nsystems of symbolic logic today (cf. Priest 1989: 391; D\u00fcsing\n2010: 97\u2013103). According to the law of non-contradiction,\nsomething cannot be both true and false at the same time or, put\nanother way, \u201cx\u201d and \u201cnot-x\u201d cannot both be\ntrue at the same time.\n\nHegel\u2019s apparent rejection of the law of non-contradiction has\nled some interpreters to regard his dialectics as illogical, even\n\u201cabsurd\u201d (Popper 1940: 420; 1962: 330; 2002: 443). Karl R.\nPopper, for instance, argued that accepting Hegel\u2019s and other\ndialecticians\u2019 rejection of the law of non-contradiction as part\nof both a logical theory and a general theory of the world\n\u201cwould mean a complete breakdown of science\u201d (Popper 1940:\n408; 1962: 317; 2002: 426). Since, according to today\u2019s systems\nof symbolic logic, he suggested, the truth of a contradiction leads\nlogically to any claim (any claim can logically be inferred from two\ncontradictory claims), if we allow contradictory claims to be valid or\ntrue together, then we would have no reason to rule out any claim\nwhatsoever (Popper 1940: 408\u2013410; 1962: 317\u2013319; 2002:\n426\u2013429).\n\nPopper was notoriously hostile toward Hegel\u2019s work (cf. Popper\n2013: 242\u2013289; for a scathing criticism of Popper\u2019s\nanalysis see Kaufmann 1976 [1972]), but, as Priest has noted (Priest\n1989: 389\u201391), even some sympathetic interpreters have been\ninspired by today\u2019s dominant systems of symbolic logic to hold\nthat the kind of contradiction that is embedded in Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics cannot be genuine contradiction in the strict sense. While\nDieter Wandschneider, for instance, grants that his sympathetic theory\nof dialectic \u201cis not presented as a faithful interpretation of\nthe Hegelian text\u201d (Wandschneider 2010: 32), he uses the same\nlogical argument that Popper offered in defense of the claim that\n\u201cdialectical contradiction is not a \u2018normal\u2019\ncontradiction, but one that is actually only an apparent\ncontradiction\u201d (Wandschneider 2010: 37). The suggestion (by the\ntraditional, triadic account of Hegel\u2019s dialectics, cf.\n section 2,\n above) that Being and Nothing (or non-being) is a contradiction, for\ninstance, he says, rests on an ambiguity. Being is an undefined\ncontent, taken to mean being or presence, while Nothing is an\nundefined content, taken to mean nothing or absence\n (section 2,\n above; cf. Wandschneider 2010: 34\u201335). Being is Nothing\n(or non-being) with respect to the property they have as\nconcepts, namely, that they both have an undefined content. But Being\nis not Nothing (or non-being) with respect to their\nmeaning (Wandschneider 2010: 34\u201338). The supposed\ncontradiction between them, then, Wandschneider suggests, takes place\n\u201cin different respects\u201d. It is therefore only an\napparent contradiction. \u201cRightly understood\u201d, he\nconcludes, \u201cthere can be no talk of contradiction\u201d\n(Wandschneider 2010: 38).\n\nInoue Kazumi also argues that dialectical contradiction in the\nHegelian sense does not violate the law of non-contradiction (Inoue\n2014: 121\u2013123), and he rejects Popper\u2019s claim that\nHegel\u2019s dialectical method is incompatible with good science. A\ndialectical contradiction, Inoue says, is a contradiction that arises\nwhen the same topic is considered from different vantage points, but\neach vantage point by itself does not violate the law of\nnon-contradiction (Inoue 2014: 120). The understanding leads to\ncontradictions, as Hegel said (cf.\n section 3\n above), because it examines a topic from a fixed point of view;\nreason embraces contradictions because it examines a topic from\nmultiple points of view (Inoue 2014: 121). The geocentric theory that\nthe sun revolves around the Earth and the heliocentric theory that the\nEarth revolves around the sun, for instance, Inoue suggests, are both\ncorrect from certain points of view. We live our everyday lives from a\nvantage point in which the sun makes a periodic rotation around the\nEarth roughly every 24 hours. Astronomers make their observations from\na geocentric point of view and then translate those observations into\na heliocentric one. From these points of view, the geocentric account\nis not incorrect. But physics, particularly in its concepts of mass\nand force, requires the heliocentric account. For science\u2014which\ntakes all these points of view into consideration\u2014both theories\nare valid: they are dialectically contradictory, though neither\ntheory, by itself, violates the law of non-contradiction (Inoue 2014:\n126\u2013127). To insist that the Earth really revolves around\nthe sun is merely an irrational, reductive prejudice, theoretically\nand practically (Inoue 2014: 126). Dialectical contradictions, Inoue\nsays, are, as Hegel said, constructive: they lead to concepts or\npoints of view that grasp the world from ever wider and more\nencompassing perspectives, culminating ultimately in the\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d (Inoue 2014: 121; cf.\n section 1,\n above). Hegel\u2019s claim that motion violates the law of\nnon-contradiction, Inoue suggests, is an expression of the idea that\ncontradictory claims can be true when motion is described from more\nthan one point of view (Inoue 2014: 123). (For a similar reading of\nHegel\u2019s conception of dialectical contradiction, which\ninfluenced Inoue\u2019s account [Inoue 2014: 121], see D\u00fcsing\n2010: 102\u2013103.)\n\nOther interpreters, however, have been inspired by Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics to develop alternative systems of logic that do not\nsubscribe to the law of non-contradiction. Priest, for instance, has\ndefended Hegel\u2019s rejection of the law of non-contradiction (cf.\nPriest 1989; 1997 [2006: 4]). The acceptance of some\ncontradictions, he has suggested, does not require the acceptance of\nall contradictions (Priest 1989: 392). Popper\u2019s logical\nargument is also unconvincing. Contradictions lead logically to any\nclaim whatsoever, as Popper said, only if we presuppose that\nnothing can be both true and false at the same time (i.e. only if we\npresuppose that the law of non-contradiction is correct), which is\njust what Hegel denies. Popper\u2019s logical argument thus assumes\nwhat it is supposed to prove or begs the question (Priest 1989: 392;\n1997 [2006: 5\u20136]), and so is not convincing. Moreover,\nconsistency (not allowing contradictions), Priest suggests, is\nactually \u201ca very weak constraint\u201d (Priest 1997 [2006:\n104]) on what counts as a rational inference. Other principles or\ncriteria\u2014such as being strongly disproved (or supported) by the\ndata\u2014are more important for determining whether a claim or\ninference is rational (Priest 1997 [2006: 105]). And, as Hegel pointed\nout, Priest says, the data\u2014namely, \u201cthe world as it\nappears\u201d (as Hegel puts it in EL) or \u201cordinary\nexperience itself\u201d (as Hegel puts it in SL)\u2014suggest that\nthere are indeed contradictions (EL Remark to \u00a748; SL-dG 382; cf.\nSL-M 440; Priest 1989: 389, 399\u2013400). Hegel is right, for\ninstance, Priest argues, that change, and motion in particular, are\nexamples of real or existing contradictions (Priest 1985; 1989:\n396\u201397; 1997 [2006: 172\u2013181, 213\u201315]). What\ndistinguishes motion, as a process, from a situation in which\nsomething is simply here at one time and then some other place at some\nother time is the embodiment of contradiction: that, in a process of\nmotion, there is one (span of) time in which something is both here\nand not here at the same time (in that span of time) (Priest 1985:\n340\u2013341; 1997 [2006: 172\u2013175, 213\u2013214]). A system of\nlogic, Priest suggests, is always just a theory about what good\nreasoning should be like (Priest 1989: 392). A dialectical logic that\nadmits that there are \u201cdialetheia\u201d or true contradictions\n(Priest 1989: 388), he says, is a broader theory or version of logic\nthan traditional, formal logics that subscribe to the law of\nnon-contradiction. Those traditional logics apply only to topics or\ndomains that are consistent, primarily domains that are \u201cstatic\nand changeless\u201d (Priest 1989: 391; cf. 395);\ndialectical/dialetheic logic handles consistent domains, but also\napplies to domains in which there are dialetheia. Thus Priest,\nextending Hegel\u2019s own concept of aufheben (\u201cto\nsublate\u201d; cf.\n section 1,\n above), suggests that traditional \u201cformal logic is perfectly\nvalid in its domain, but dialectical (dialetheic) logic is more\ngeneral\u201d (Priest 1989: 395). (For an earlier example of a\nlogical system that allows contradiction and was inspired in part by\nHegel [and Marx], see Ja\u015bkowski 1999: 36 [1969: 143] [cf. Inoue\n2014: 128\u2013129]. For more on dialetheic logic generally, see the\nentry on\n Dialetheism.)\n\nWorries that Hegel\u2019s arguments fail to fit his account of\ndialectics (see\n section 2,\n above) have led some interpreters to conclude that his method is\narbitrary or that his works have no single dialectical method at all\n(Findlay 1962: 93; Solomon 1983: 21). These interpreters reject the\nidea that there is any logical necessity to the moves from\nstage to stage. \u201c[T]he important point to make here, and again\nand again\u201d, Robert C. Solomon writes, for instance, \n\n\nis that the transition from the first form to the second, or the\ntransition from the first form of the Phenomenology all the\nway to the last, is not in any way a deductive necessity. The\nconnections are anything but entailments, and the\nPhenomenology could always take another route and\nother starting points. (Solomon 1983: 230) \n\n\nIn a footnote to this passage, Solomon adds \u201cthat a\nformalization of Hegel\u2019s logic, however ingenious, is\nimpossible\u201d (Solomon 1983: 230).\n\nSome scholars have argued that Hegel\u2019s necessity is not intended\nto be logical necessity. Walter Kaufmann suggested, for instance, that\nthe necessity at work in Hegel\u2019s dialectic is a kind of organic\nnecessity. The moves in the Phenomenology, he said, follow\none another \u201cin the way in which, to use a Hegelian image from\nthe preface, bud, blossom and fruit succeed each other\u201d\n(Kaufmann 1965: 148; 1966: 132). Findlay argued that later stages\nprovide what he called a \u201chigher-order comment\u201d\non earlier stages, even if later stages do not follow from earlier\nones in a trivial way (Findlay 1966: 367). Solomon suggested that the\nnecessity that Hegel wants is not \u201c\u2018necessity\u2019 in\nthe modern sense of \u2018logical necessity,\u2019\u201d (Solomon\n1983: 209), but a kind of progression (Solomon 1983: 207), or a\n\u201cnecessity within a context for some purpose\u201d\n(Solomon 1983: 209). John Burbidge defines Hegel\u2019s necessity in\nterms of three senses of the relationship between actuality and\npossibility, only the last of which is logical necessity (Burbidge\n1981: 195\u20136).\n\nOther scholars have defined the necessity of Hegel\u2019s dialectics\nin terms of a transcendental argument. A transcendental argument\nbegins with uncontroversial facts of experience and tries to show that\nother conditions must be present\u2014or are necessary\u2014for\nthose facts to be possible. Jon Stewart argues, for instance, that\n\u201cHegel\u2019s dialectic in the Phenomenology is a\ntranscendental account\u201d in this sense, and thus has the\nnecessity of that form of argument (Stewart 2000: 23; cf. Taylor 1975:\n97, 226\u20137; for a critique of this view, see Pinkard 1988: 7,\n15).\n\nSome scholars have avoided these debates by interpreting Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics in a literary way. In his examination of the\nepistemological theory of the Phenomenology, for instance,\nKenneth R. Westphal offers \u201ca literary model\u201d of\nHegel\u2019s dialectics based on the story of Sophocles\u2019 play\nAntigone (Westphal 2003: 14, 16). Ermanno Bencivenga offers\nan interpretation that combines a narrative approach with a concept of\nnecessity. For him, the necessity of Hegel\u2019s dialectical logic\ncan be captured by the notion of telling a good story\u2014where\n\u201cgood\u201d implies that the story is both creative and correct\nat the same time (Bencivenga 2000: 43\u201365).\n\nDebate over whether Hegel\u2019s dialectical logic is logical may\nalso be fueled in part by discomfort with his particular brand of\nlogic. Unlike today\u2019s symbolic logics, Hegel\u2019s logic is\nnot only syntactic, but also semantic (cf. Berto 2007; Maybee 2009:\nxx\u2013xxv; Margolis 2010: 193\u201394). Hegel\u2019s interest in\nsemantics appears, for instance, in the very first stages of his\nlogic, where the difference between Being and Nothing is\n\u201csomething merely meant\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to\n\u00a787; cf.\n section 2\n above). While some of the moves from stage to stage are driven by\nsyntactic necessity, other moves are driven by the meanings\nof the concepts in play. Indeed, Hegel rejected what he regarded as\nthe overly formalistic logics that dominated the field during his day\n(EL Remark to \u00a7162; SL-M 43\u201344; SL-dG 24). A logic that\ndeals only with the forms of logical arguments and not the meanings of\nthe concepts used in those argument forms will do no better in terms\nof preserving truth than the old joke about computer programs\nsuggests: garbage in, garbage out. In those logics, if we (using\ntoday\u2019s versions of formal, symbolic logic) plug in something\nfor the P or Q (in the proposition \u201cif P\nthen Q\u201d or \u201cP \u2192 Q\u201d, for\ninstance) or for the \u201cF\u201d, \u201cG\u201d,\nor \u201cx\u201d (in the proposition \u201cif F is\nx, then G is x\u201d or \u201cFx\n\u2192 Gx\u201d, for instance) that means something\ntrue, then the syntax of formal logics will preserve that truth. But\nif we plug in something for those terms that is untrue or meaningless\n(garbage in), then the syntax of formal logic will lead to an untrue\nor meaningless conclusion (garbage out). Today\u2019s versions of\nprepositional logic also assume that we know what the meaning of\n\u201cis\u201d is. Against these sorts of logics, Hegel wanted to\ndevelop a logic that not only preserved truth, but also determined how\nto construct truthful claims in the first place. A logic that defines\nconcepts (semantics) as well as their relationships with one another\n(syntax) will show, Hegel thought, how concepts can be combined into\nmeaningful forms. Because interpreters are familiar with modern logics\nfocused on syntax, however, they may regard Hegel\u2019s syntactic\nand semantic logic as not really logical (cf. Maybee 2009:\nxvii\u2013xxv).\n\nIn Hegel\u2019s other works, the moves from stage to stage are often\ndriven, not only by syntax and semantics\u2014that is, by logic\n(given his account of logic)\u2014but also by considerations that\ngrow out of the relevant subject matter. In the\nPhenomenology, for instance, the moves are driven by syntax,\nsemantics, and by phenomenological factors. Sometimes a move\nfrom one stage to the next is driven by a syntactic\nneed\u2014the need to stop an endless, back-and-forth process, for\ninstance, or to take a new path after all the current options have\nbeen exhausted (cf.\n section 5).\n Sometimes, a move is driven by the meaning of a concept,\nsuch as the concept of a \u201cThis\u201d or \u201cThing\u201d.\nAnd sometimes a move is driven by a phenomenological need or\nnecessity\u2014by requirements of consciousness, or by the\nfact that the Phenomenology is about a consciousness\nthat claims to be aware of (or to know) something. The logic of the\nPhenomenology is thus a phenomeno-logic, or a logic\ndriven by logic\u2014syntax and semantics\u2014and by\nphenomenological considerations. Still, interpreters such as Quentin\nLauer have suggested that, for Hegel, \n\n\nphenomeno-logy is a logic of appearing, a logic of implication, like\nany other logic, even though not of the formal entailment with which\nlogicians and mathematicians are familiar. (Lauer 1976: 3) \n\n\nLauer warns us against dismissing the idea that there is any\nimplication or necessity in Hegel\u2019s method at all (Lauer 1976:\n3). (Other scholars who also believe there is a logical necessity to\nthe dialectics of the Phenomenology include Hyppolite 1974:\n78\u20139 and H.S. Harris 1997: xii.)\n\nWe should also be careful not to exaggerate the\n\u201cnecessity\u201d of formal, symbolic logics. Even in these\nlogics, there can often be more than one path from some premises to\nthe same conclusion, logical operators can be dealt with in different\norders, and different sets of operations can be used to reach the same\nconclusions. There is therefore often no strict, necessary\n\u201centailment\u201d from one step to the next, even though the\nconclusion might be entailed by the whole series of steps, taken\ntogether. As in today\u2019s logics, then, whether Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics counts as logical depends on the degree to which he shows\nthat we are forced\u2014necessarily\u2014from earlier stages or\nseries of stages to later stages (see also\n section 5).\n5. Syntactic patterns and special terminology in Hegel\u2019s dialectics\n\nAlthough Hegel\u2019s dialectics is driven by syntax, semantics and\nconsiderations specific to the different subject matters\n (section 4\n above), several important syntactic patterns appear repeatedly\nthroughout his works. In many places, the dialectical process is\ndriven by a syntactic necessity that is really a kind of exhaustion:\nwhen the current strategy has been exhausted, the process is forced,\nnecessarily, to employ a new strategy. As we saw\n (section 2),\n once the strategy of treating Being and Nothing as separate concepts\nis exhausted, the dialectical process must, necessarily, adopt a\ndifferent strategy, namely, one that takes the two concepts together.\nThe concept of Becoming captures the first way in which Being and\nNothing are taken together. In the stages of Quantum through Number,\nthe concepts of One and Many take turns defining the whole quantity as\nwell as the quantitative bits inside that make it up: first, the One\nis the whole, while the Many are the bits; then the whole and the bits\nare all Ones; then the Many is the whole, while the bits are each a\nOne; and finally the whole and the bits are all a Many. We can picture\nthe development like this (cf. Maybee 2009, xviii\u2013xix):\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nSince One and Many have been exhausted, the next stage, Ratio, must,\nnecessarily, employ a different strategy to grasp the elements in\nplay. Just as Being-for-itself is a concept of universality for\nQuality and captures the character of a set of something-others in its\ncontent (see\n section 1),\n so Ratio (the whole rectangle with rounded corners) is a concept of\nuniversality for Quantity and captures the character of a set of\nquantities in its content (EL \u00a7105\u20136; cf. Maybee 2009,\nxviii\u2013xix, 95\u20137). In another version of syntactic\nnecessity driven by exhaustion, the dialectical development will take\naccount of every aspect or layer, so to speak, of a concept or\nform\u2014as we saw in the stages of Purpose outlined above, for\ninstance\n (section 2).\n Once all the aspects or layers of a concept or form have been taken\naccount of and so exhausted, the dialectical development must also,\nnecessarily, employ a different strategy in the next stage to grasp\nthe elements in play.\n\nIn a second, common syntactic pattern, the dialectical development\nleads to an endless, back-and-forth process\u2014a \u201cbad\u201d\n(EL-BD \u00a794) or \u201cspurious\u201d (EL-GSH \u00a794)\ninfinity\u2014between two concepts or forms. Hegel\u2019s dialectics\ncannot rest with spurious infinities. So long as the dialectical\nprocess is passing endlessly back and forth between two elements, it\nis never finished, and the concept or form in play cannot be\ndetermined. Spurious infinities must therefore be resolved or stopped,\nand they are always resolved by a higher-level, more universal\nconcept. In some cases, a new, higher-level concept is introduced that\nstops the spurious infinity by grasping the whole, back-and-forth\nprocess. Being-for-itself (cf.\n section 1),\n for instance, is introduced as a new, more universal concept that\nembraces\u2014and hence stops\u2014the whole, back-and-forth process\nbetween \u201csomething-others\u201d. However, if the back-and-forth\nprocess takes place between a concept and its own content\u2014in\nwhich case the concept already embraces the content\u2014then that\nembracing concept is redefined in a new way that grasps the whole,\nback-and-forth process. The new definition raises the embracing\nconcept to a higher level of universality\u2014as a totality (an\n\u201call\u201d) or as a complete and completed concept. Examples\nfrom logic include the redefinition of Appearance as the whole World\nof Appearance (EL \u00a7132; cf. SL-M 505\u20137, SL-dG 443\u20134),\nthe move in which the endless, back-and-forth process of Real\nPossibility redefines the Condition as a totality (EL \u00a7147; cf.\nSL-M 547, SL-dG 483), and the move in which a back-and-forth process\ncreated by finite Cognition and finite Willing redefines the\nSubjective Idea as Absolute Idea (EL \u00a7\u00a7234\u20135; cf. SL-M\n822\u20133, SL-dG 733\u20134).\n\nSome of the most famous terms in Hegel\u2019s works\u2014\u201cin\nitself [an sich]\u201d, \u201cfor itself [f\u00fcr\nsich]\u201d and \u201cin and for itself [an und f\u00fcr\nsich]\u201d\u2014capture other, common, syntactic patterns. A\nconcept or form is \u201cin itself\u201d when it has a determination\nthat it gets by being defined against its \u201cother\u201d\n(cf. Being-in-itself, EL \u00a791). A concept or form is \u201cfor\nitself\u201d when it is defined only in relation to its own content,\nso that, while it is technically defined in relation to an\n\u201cother\u201d, the \u201cother\u201d is not really an\n\u201cother\u201d for it. As a result, it is really defined only in\nrelation to itself. Unlike an \u201cin itself\u201d concept or form,\nthen, a \u201cfor itself\u201d concept or form seems to have its\ndefinition on its own, or does not need a genuine \u201cother\u201d\nto be defined (like other concepts or forms, however, \u201cfor\nitself\u201d concepts or forms turn out to be dialectical too, and\nhence push on to new concepts or forms). In the logic,\nBeing-for-itself (cf.\n section 1),\n which is defined by embracing the \u201csomething others\u201d in\nits content, is the first, \u201cfor itself\u201d concept or\nform.\n\nA concept or form is \u201cin and for itself\u201d when it is doubly\n\u201cfor itself\u201d, or \u201cfor itself\u201d not only in\nterms of content\u2014insofar as it embraces its\ncontent\u2014but also in terms of form or presentation,\ninsofar as it also has the activity of presenting its\ncontent. It is \u201cfor itself\u201d (embraces its content) for\nitself (through its own activity), or not only embraces its\ncontent (the \u201cfor itself\u201d of content) but also\npresents its content through its own activity (the \u201cfor\nitself\u201d of form). The second \u201cfor itself\u201d of form\nprovides the concept with a logical activity (i.e., presenting its\ncontent) and hence a definition that goes beyond\u2014and so is\nseparate from\u2014the definition that its content has. Since it has\na definition of its own that is separate from the definition of its\ncontent, it comes to be defined\u2014in the \u201cin itself\u201d\nsense\u2014against its content, which has become its\n\u201cother\u201d. Because this \u201cother\u201d is still its own\ncontent, however, the concept or form is both \u201cin itself\u201d\nbut also still \u201cfor itself\u201d at the same time, or is\n\u201cin and for itself\u201d (EL \u00a7\u00a7148\u20139; cf.\nMaybee 2009: 244\u20136). The \u201cin and for itself\u201d\nrelationship is the hallmark of a genuine Concept (EL \u00a7160), and\ncaptures the idea that a genuine concept is defined not only from the\nbottom up by its content, but also from the top down through its own\nactivity of presenting its content. The genuine concept of animal, for\ninstance, is not only defined by embracing its content (namely, all\nanimals) from the bottom up, but also has a definition of its own,\nseparate from that content, that leads it to determine (and so\npresent), from the top down, what counts as an animal.\n\nOther technical, syntactic terms include aufheben (\u201cto\nsublate\u201d), which we already saw\n (section 1),\n and \u201cabstract\u201d. To say that a concept or form is\n\u201cabstract\u201d is to say that it is only a partial definition.\nHegel describes the moment of understanding, for instance, as abstract\n(EL \u00a7\u00a779, 80) because it is a one-sided or restricted\ndefinition or determination\n (section 1).\n Conversely, a concept or form is \u201cconcrete\u201d in the most\nbasic sense when it has a content or definition that it gets from\nbeing built out of other concepts or forms. As we saw\n (section 2),\n Hegel regarded Becoming as the first concrete concept in the\nlogic.\n\nAlthough Hegel\u2019s writing and his use of technical terms can make\nhis philosophy notoriously difficult, his work can also be very\nrewarding. In spite of\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the\ndifficulty, there are a surprising number of fresh ideas in his work\nthat have not yet been fully explored in philosophy. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["English Translations of Key Texts by Hegel", "English Translations of Other Primary Sources", " Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"English Translations of Key Texts by Hegel": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[EL], <em>The Encyclopedia Logic [Enzyklop\u00e4die der\nphilosophischen Wissenschaften I]</em>.
