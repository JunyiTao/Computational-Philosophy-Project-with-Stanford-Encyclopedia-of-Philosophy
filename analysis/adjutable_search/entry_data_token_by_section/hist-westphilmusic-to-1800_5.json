In doing so, they\nquestion the educational value of music.\n\nIn his De Musica, the epicurean Philodemus (c. 110\u2013c.\n30 BCE) rejects the widespread view that music may imitate the\npassions, claiming that music is no better able to represent\npsychological states than the art of cooking (see Wilkinson 1938).\nPhilodemus appeals to Democritus (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BCE), but\nevidence regarding the latter\u2019s views is scant. While it is\nclear that Democritus held music to stand lower than other arts in\nterms of utility, it is probably not true that he thought this\ndeprived it of educational value (see Brancacci 2007:\n193\u201395).\n\nSextus Empiricus (fl. 3rd century CE), in Against the\nMusicians, also denies that music could have any positive\neducational role. While he concedes that we may enjoy music, he denies\nthat the study of music could contribute to such enjoyment. In support\nof this, he also compares music to cookery, arguing that in both cases\nenjoyment is independent of our understanding of the thing enjoyed\n(Against the Musicians, 24\u201325).\n",
