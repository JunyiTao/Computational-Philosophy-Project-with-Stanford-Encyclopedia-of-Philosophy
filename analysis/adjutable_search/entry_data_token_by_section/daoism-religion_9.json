Main Schools and Lineages\n\nThis section does not intend to provide a historical overview of the\nDaoist tradition, but only brief notes on its principal schools and\nlineages. (The only book-length study of the history of Daoism in a\nWestern language is Robinet 1997b, which however only covers the period from the\norigins to the 14th century. Shorter, reliable historical surveys\ninclude Schipper 2000 and Bokenkamp 2005a.)\n",
