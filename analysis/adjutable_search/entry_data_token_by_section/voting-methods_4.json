    "main_text": "Examples of Voting Methods || Voting by Grading\n2.2 Voting by Grading\n\nThe voting methods discussed in this section can be viewed as\ngeneralizations of scoring methods, such as Borda Count. In a scoring\nmethod, a voter\u2019s ranking is an assignment of grades (e.g.,\n\"1st place\", \"2nd place\", \"3rd place\", ... , \"last place\") to the\ncandidates. Requiring voters to rank all the candidates means that (1)\nevery candidate is assigned a grade, (2) there are the same number of\npossible grades as the number of candidates, and (3) different\ncandidates must be assigned different grades. In this section, we drop\nassumptions (2) and (3), assuming a fixed number of grades for every\nset of candidates and allowing different candidates to be assigned the\nsame grade. \n\nThe first example gives voters the option to either select a candidate\nthat they want to vote for (as in plurality rule) or to\nselect a candidate that they want to vote against.\n\nNegative Voting:\n\nEach voter is allowed to choose one candidate to either vote\nfor (giving the candidate one point) or to vote\nagainst (giving the candidate \u20131 points). The winner(s)\nis(are) the candidate(s) with the highest total number of points (i.e., the candidate\nwith the greatest score, where the score is the total number of positive votes minus the total \nnumber of negative votes).\n\n\nNegative voting is tantamount to allowing the voters to support either\na single candidate or all but one candidate (taking a point away from\na candidate \\(C\\) is equivalent to giving one point to all candidates\nexcept \\(C\\)). That is, the voters are asked to choose a set of\ncandidates that they support, where the choice is between sets\nconsisting of a single candidate or sets consisting of all except one\ncandidate. The next voting method generalizes this idea by allowing\nvoters to choose any subset of candidates: \n\nApproval Voting:\n\nEach voter selects a subset of the candidates (where the\nempty set means the voter abstains) and the candidate(s) with selected by \nthe most voters wins.   \n\n\nIf a candidate \\(X\\) is in the set of candidates selected by \na voter, we say that the voter approves of candidate \\(X\\).  Then, the approval winner is the \ncandidate with the most approvals. Approval voting has been extensively discussed by Steven Brams and Peter Fishburn (Brams and Fishburn 2007; Brams 2008). See, also, the\nrecent collection of articles devoted to approval voting (Laslier and\nSanver 2010). \n\nApproval voting forces voters to think about the decision problem\ndifferently: They are asked to determine which candidates they\napprove of rather than selecting a single candidate to voter\nfor or determining the relative ranking of the candidates.\nThat is, the voters are asked which candidates are above a certain\n\u201cthreshold of acceptance\u201d. Ranking a set of candidates and\nselecting the candidates that are approved are two different aspects\nof a voters overall opinion about the candidates. They are related but\ncannot be derived from each other. See Brams and Sanver 2009, for\nexamples of voting methods that ask voters to both select a set of\ncandidates that they approve and to (linearly) rank the\ncandidates. \n\nApproval voting is a very flexible method. Recall the election\nscenario illustrating the \\(k\\)-Approval Voting methods: \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n2\\(\\underline{A}\\s D\\s B\\s C\\)\n2\\(\\underline{B}\\s D\\s A\\s C\\)\n1\\(\\underline{C}\\s \\underline{A}\\s B\\s D\\)\n\n\nIn this election scenario, \\(k\\)-Approval for \\(k=1,2,3\\) cannot\nguarantee that the Condorcet winner \\(A\\) is elected. The Approval\nballot \\((\\{A\\},\\{B\\}, \\{A, C\\})\\) does elect the Condorcet winner. In\nfact, Brams (2008, Chapter 2) proves that if there is a unique\nCondorcet winner, then that candidate may be elected under approval\nvoting (assuming that all voters vote sincerely: see Brams\n2008, Chapter 2, for a discussion). Note that approval voting may also\nelect other candidates (perhaps even the Condorcet loser). Whether\nthis flexibility of Approval Voting should be seen as a virtue or a\nvice is debated in Brams, Fishburn and Merrill 1988a, 1988b and Saari\nand van Newenhizen 1988a, 1988b. \n\nApproval Voting asks voters to express something about their\nintensity of preference for the candidates by assigning one\nof two grades: \"Approve\" or \"Don\u2019t Approve\". Expanding on this idea,\nsome voting methods assume that there is a fixed set of grades, or a\ngrading language, that voters can assign to each candidate.\nSee Chapters 7 and 8 from Balinksi and Laraki 2010 for examples and a\ndiscussion of grading languages (cf. Morreau 2016). \n\nThere are different ways to determine the winner(s) given a profile of\nballots that assign grades to each candidate. The main approach is to\ncalculate a \"group\" grade for each candidate, then select the\ncandidate with the best overall group grade. In order to calculate a\ngroup grade for each candidate, it is convenient to use numbers for\nthe grading language. Then, there are two natural ways to determine\nthe group grade for a candidate: calculating the mean, or average, of\nthe grades or calculating the median of the grades.\n\nCumulative Voting:\n\nEach voter is asked to distribute a fixed number of points, say ten,\namong the candidates in any way they please. The candidate(s) with the\nmost total points wins the election.\n\n\nScore Voting (also called Range Voting):\n\nThe grades are a finite set of numbers. The ballots are an assignment\nof grades to the candidates. The candidate(s) with the largest average\ngrade is declared the winner(s).\n\n\nCumulative Voting and Score Voting are similar. The important\ndifference is that Cumulative Voting requires that the sum of the\ngrades assigned to the candidates by each voter is the same.  The next\nprocedure, proposed by Balinski and Laraki 2010 (cf. Bassett and\nPersky 1999 and \n the discussion of this method at rangevoting.org),\n selects the candidate(s) with the largest median grade rather\nthan the largest mean grade. \n\nMajority Judgement:\n\nThe grades are a finite set of numbers (cf. discussion of common grading languages). \nThe ballots are an assignment of grades to the candidates. The candidate(s) \nwith the largest median grade is(are) declared the winner(s). See \nBalinski and Laraki 2007 and 2010 for further refinements of this voting method \nthat use different methods for breaking ties when there are multiple candidates \nwith the largest  median grade.\n\n\nI conclude this section with an example that illustrates Score Voting\nand Majority Judgement. Suppose that there are 3 candidates \\(\\{A, B,\nC\\}\\), 5 grades \\(\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\) (with the assumption that the larger\nthe number, the higher the grade), and 5 voters. The table below\ndescribes an election scenario. The candidates are listed in the first row.\n Each row describes an assignment of grades to a candidate by a set of voters. \n\nGrade (0\u20134) for:\n\n# Voters\\(A\\)\\(B\\)\\(C\\)\n\n1431\n\n1432\n\n1203\n\n1234\n\n1102\n\nMean:2.61.82.4\n\nMedian:232\n\n\nThe bottom two rows give the mean and median grade for each\ncandidate. Candidate \\(A\\) is the score voting winner with the greatest\nmean grade, and candidate \\(B\\) is the majority judgement winner with\nthe greatest median grade. \n\n\n\nThere are two types of debates about the voting methods introduced in this section.   \nThe first concerns the choice of the grading language that voters use \nto evaluate the candidates.  Consult Balinski and Laraki 2010 amd Morreau 2016 for an extensive discussion of the types of considerations that  influence the choice of a grading language. Brams and Potthoff 2015 argue that two grades, as in Approval Voting,  is best to avoid certain paradoxical outcomes.   To illustrate, note that, in the above example, if the candidates are ranked by\nthe voters according to the grades that are assigned, then candidate\n\\(C\\) is the Condorcet winner (since 3 voters assign higher grades to\n\\(C\\) than to \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)).   However, neither Score Voting nor Majority Judgement selects candidate \\(C\\).  \n\n\n\n\nThe second type of debate concerns the method used to calculate  the group grade for each candidate (i.e., whether to use the mean as in Score Voting or the median as in Majority Judgement).   One important issue is whether voters have an incentive to misrepresent their evaluations of the candidates.    Consider the voter in  the middle column  that assigns the grade of 2 to  \\(A\\), 0 to \\(B\\), and 3 to \\(C\\).   Suppose that these grades represents the voter\u2019s true evaluations of the candidates.  If  this  voter increases the grade for \\(C\\) to 4 and decreases the grade for \\(A\\) to  1 (and the other voters do not change their grades), then the average grade for \\(A\\) becomes 2.4 and the average grade for \\(C\\) becomes 2.6, which better reflects the voter\u2019s true evaluations of the candidates (and results in \\(C\\) being elected according to Score Voting). Thus, this voter has an incentive to misrepresent her grades.   Note that the median grades for the candidates do not change after this voter changes her grades.   Indeed, Balinski and Laraki 2010, chapter 10, argue that using the median to assign group grades to candidates encourages voters to submit grades that reflect their true evaluations of the candidates. The key  idea of their argument is as follows: If a voter\u2019s true grade matches  the median grade for a candidate, then the voter does not have an incentive to assign a different grade.  If a voter\u2019s true grade is greater than the median grade for a candidate, then raising the grade will not change the candidate\u2019s grade and lowering the voter\u2019s grade may result in the candidate receiving a grade that is lowering than the voter\u2019s true evaluation. Similarly, if a voter\u2019s true grade is lower than the median grade for a candidate, then lowering the grade will not change the candidate\u2019s grade and raising the voter\u2019s grade may result in the candidate receiving a grade that is higher than the voter\u2019s true evaluation.  Thus, if voters are focused on ensuring that the group grades for the candidates best reflects their true evaluations of the candidates, then voters do not have an incentive to misrepresent their grades. However, as pointed out in Felsenthal and Machover 2008 (Example 3.3), voters can manipulate the outcome of an election using Majority Judgement to ensure  a preferred candidate is elected  (cf. the discussion of strategic voting in Section 4.1 and Section 3.3 of List 2013).   Suppose that the voter in the middle column  assigns the grade of  4 to candidate \\(A\\), 0 to candidate \\(B\\) and 3 to candidate \\(C\\).  Assuming the other voters do not change their grades, the majority judgement winner is now  \\(A\\), which the voter ranks higher than the original majority judgement winner  \\(B.\\)   Consult Balinski and Laraki 2010, 2014 and Edelman 2012b  for  arguments in favor of electing candidates with the greatest median grade;  and Felsenthal and Machover 2008, Gehrlein and Lepelley 2003, and Laslier 2011 for arguments against electing candidates with the greatest median grade. \n  \n\n\n",
