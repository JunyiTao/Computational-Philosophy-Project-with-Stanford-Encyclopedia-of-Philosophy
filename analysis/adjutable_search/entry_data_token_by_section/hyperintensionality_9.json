    "main_text": "General Approaches to Hyperintensionality || Aboutness\n4.2 Aboutness\n\nSome theories of propositional content represent a number of\nhyperintensional distinctions by combining SPWS with ways of splitting\nthe modal space. The main work in this area is Yablo\u2019s book\nAboutness (2014; and see Osorio-Kupferblum 2016 for a\ncritical discussion). Aboutness is\n\n\nthe relation that meaningful items bear to whatever it is that they\nare on or of or that they address or\nconcern, (Yablo 2014: 1)\n\n\nnamely, their subject matter. The subject matter of a\nsentence in context can be seen as a topic, an issue, or a question\nthe sentence may be taken, in that context, as answering to. When the\nissue is the number of stars, the relevant question may be:\n\u201cHow many stars are there?\u201d. As in inquisitive semantics\n(Ciardelli, Groenendijk, & Roelofsen 2013), one can associate the\nquestion with the set of its answers: There are no stars; There is one\nstar; There are two stars; etc. Answers are propositions in the SPWS\nsense: sets of possible worlds. We now call these thin\npropositions for the full propositional contents of sentences will\nturn out to be richer than that. The question, thus, splits the\ntotality of worlds into sets (the relevant thin propositions). Two\nworlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) end up in the same set just in case they\nagree on the answer\u2014in our example: when the number of stars is\nthe same at \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\). When, as in the example, the question\nhas just one correct answer, the thin propositions at issue form a\npartition of the set of worlds \\(W\\): a splitting into subsets such\nthat their union is all of \\(W\\), and such that each \\(w\\) in\n\\(W\\) is in exactly one subset or cell. One cell has all the 0-star\nworlds, one all the 1-star worlds, one all the 2-star worlds, and so\non.\n\nWhile the idea is already in Lewis (1988) (see also Plebani and\nSpolaore forthcoming), Yablo proposes a generalization due to some\nquestions\u2019 having more than one correct answer:\n\u201cWhere\u2019s a good Italian restaurant in Amsterdam?\u201d. A\nworld \\(w_1\\) can be in more than one cell now: it can agree with\n\\(w_2\\) by having a good Italian restaurant in Rembrandtplein, with\n\\(w_3\\) by having another good Italian restaurant in Keizersgracht.\nHere the question determines a division of \\(W\\): a splitting into\nsubsets whose union is \\(W\\), but which can overlap.\n\nThere\u2019s an intuitive mereology of issues, topics, or subject\nmatters: they should be capable of overlapping and of fusing into\nwholes which inherit the proper features from the parts (Yablo 2014:\nSection 3.2). The topic philosophy and the topic\nmathematics overlap (the overlap including, presumably,\nlogic). How things went in 1882 is included in the\nlarger how things went in the nineteenth century. A larger\nsubject matter induces smaller cells: \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) agree on\nwhat happened in their whole nineteenth century only if they agree on\nwhat happened in their 1882 to begin with.\n\nLet \\(|A|\\), a subset of \\(W\\), be the thin proposition expressed by\n\\(A\\). The thick proposition expressed by \\(A\\), [\\(A\\)], is\nits thin proposition \\(|A|\\) together with \\(A\\)\u2019s subject\nmatter, \\(s(A)\\). How does one get the subject matter of\n\\(A\\)? Yablo suggests assigning a positive subject matter, the\ndivision corresponding to \u201cWhy is \\(A\\) true?\u201d; a negative\nsubject matter, the division corresponding to \u201cWhy is \\(A\\)\nfalse?\u201d; and to identify the overall \\(s(A)\\) with its positive\nand negative subject matters taken together. Worlds agree on the\noverall subject matter of \\(A\\) when either \\(A\\) is true, or \\(A\\) is\nfalse, for the same reasons at them. Yablo calls the reasons for\n\\(A\\)\u2019s being true (false), \\(A\\)\u2019s truthmakers\n(falsemakers). He suggests not to read them in a\nmetaphysically loaded way, as chunks of reality whose obtaining\nnecessitates truth, and advocates a \u201csemantic\u201d conception\nof truthmaking: truth/falsemakers are cells of divisions of \\(W\\),\nthus, just sets of worlds again, i.e., thin propositions.\n\nThick propositions are hyperintensional. They cut at least as finely\nas ordinary sets of worlds: when \\(|A|\\) differs from \\(|B|\\), [\\(A\\)]\nwill differ from [\\(B\\)]. Additionally, there will be \\(A\\)\u2019s\nand \\(B\\)\u2019s expressing different thick propositions in spite of\nbeing true at the same worlds, because they are about different\nthings: \\(s(A)\\) will differ from \\(s(B)\\) even if \\(|A| = |B|\\). For\nexample, \u201cThere is an even number of stars or there is\nnot\u201d and \u201cThere are no non-self-identical Italian\nrestaurants\u201d are both necessarily true, but they correspond to\ndistinct thick propositions because of their different subject\nmatters. The suggestion that adding subject matter to semantics is the\nkey to handling hyperintensionality is discussed in Gioulatou\n(2016).\n\nTo get a precise answer on which hyperintensional distinctions the\nframework can make, one needs a full-fledged truthmaker assignment to\nall sentences of the target language. Yablo gives two \u201csemantic\npictures\u201d, a reductive and a recursive one,\nwhich pull in different directions. We take the recursive route, which\nrelies on van Fraassen (1969) and is found more plausible by some\n(e.g., Hawke 2018; Fine 2020), and leave the details to a consultation\nof Yablo (2014: 56\u20139). In a plain sentential language: when\n\\(A\\) is an atomic formula \\(p\\) one can assign it some truthmaker\n\\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and falsemaker \\(\\{p^-\\}\\). Negation flips: For \\(A =\n{\\sim}B\\), what truthmakes \\(A\\) is what falsemakes \\(B\\) and vice\nversa. For \\(A = B \\land C\\), what truthmakes \\(A\\) is the union of\nwhat truthmakes \\(B\\) and what truthmakes \\(C\\); what falsemakes \\(A\\)\nis what either falsemakes \\(B\\) or falsemakes \\(C\\). For \\(A = B \\lor\nC\\), we flip the truth- and falsemakers of \\(B \\land C\\). Then, e.g.,\n\\(p \\land q\\) is made true by \\(\\{p^+, q^+\\}\\), false by \\(\\{p^-\\}\\)\nand by \\(\\{q^-\\}\\); \\(p \\lor q\\) is made true by \\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and by\n\\(\\{q^+\\}\\); false by \\(\\{p^-, q^-\\}\\).\n\nNow \\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\) and \\(q \\lor {\\sim}q\\) (\u201cJohn is either a\nbachelor or not\u201d, \u201cEither 44 is the sum of two primes or\nnot\u201d) will express distinct thick propositions insofar as they\nare about different things (how things stand John-wise is a different\nissue from how things stand 44-wise). When, with distinct \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\), the truthmakers of \\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\) are \\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{p^-\\}\\), those of \\(q \\lor {\\sim}q\\) are \\(\\{q^+\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{q^-\\}, s(p \\lor {\\sim}p)\\) will differ from \\(s(q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\)\nand so the two thick propositions [\\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\)] and [\\(q \\lor\n{\\sim}q\\)] will differ although \\(|p \\lor {\\sim}p| = |q \\lor {\\sim}q|\n= W\\). Also, [\\(p\\)] will differ from [\\(p \\land (q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\)]\nas \\(p\\) is truthmade by \\(\\{p^+\\}, p \\land (q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\) by\n\\(\\{p^+, q^+\\}\\) and \\(\\{p^+, q^-\\}\\), not by \\(\\{p^+\\}\\). So one can\ncapture the idea that \u201cYou see that Mary is eating an ice\ncream\u201d and \u201cYou see that Mary is eating an ice cream and\nJohn is either eating chips or not\u201d don\u2019t say the same, in\nthe face of the logical equivalence of \\(A\\) and \\(A \\land (B \\lor\n{\\sim}B\\)).\n\nBut even lacking a precise treatment for a predicative language, we\ncan see that distinct, logically atomic necessarily true or false\ncontents may be difficult to tell apart. Take \u201cMike is\nMike\u201d, \\(m = m\\), and \u201cMike is Jack the Ripper\u201d, \\(m\n= j\\), which differ in informativeness. Given that Mike is Jack and\nthe necessity of identity, \\(|m = m| = |m = j| = W\\); but also the\nsubject matters will coincide: what makes both claims true is a fact\nabout Mike, Mike\u2019s being Mike. Nothing makes either false.\n\u201cHobbes squared the circle\u201d, \\(Sh\\), and \u201cDaniel\nNolan squared the circle\u201d, \\(Sd\\), concern different issues: one\nis about Hobbes\u2019 mathematical (non)achievements, the other is\nabout Daniel\u2019s. But \\(|Sh| = |Sd| = \\emptyset\\), and\nthere\u2019s no way to get truth/falsemakers as sets of possible\nworlds that will make \\(s(Sh)\\) and \\(s(Sd)\\) differ: no matter how\none splits and groups possible worlds into sets, there will be no\nworlds available where Hobbes squares the circle or where Nolan does\nto begin with.\n\nAs noticed by Fine (2020), the difficulty may be due to the fact that\nthe setting is conservative with respect to SPWS: it starts with the\nusual possible worlds and just adds ways of splitting and grouping\nthem (see Hawke 2018 for further criticisms). The next approach\npromises to do better by looking at worlds that step beyond the\npossible.\n",
