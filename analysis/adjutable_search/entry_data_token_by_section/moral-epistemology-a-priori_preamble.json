    "main_text": "\n\nA priori knowledge is, in an important sense, independent of\nexperience. In contrast, a posteriori knowledge depends on\nexperiences such as empirical observations and introspection of\none\u2019s conscious states. If a proposition can be known a\npriori, then we can somehow see that it is true just by thinking\nand reasoning about it (see entry on\n a priori justification and knowledge).\n Here are some paradigm examples of propositions one can know a\npriori:\n\n(1)\n that all bachelors are unmarried\n(2)\n that all three sided plane figures will also have three angles\n(3)\nthat 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n\nHere are some paradigm examples of moral propositions:\n\n(4)\nthat all murder is wrong\n(5)\nthat no person\u2019s good is any more important than the good of\nany other person\n(6)\nthat I ought to do some volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity\nthis weekend.\n\n\nMany philosophers think we can know some moral propositions a\npriori. Few deny that we can know (4) a priori or the\nproposition that if it would be wrong not to do something, one\nought to do it or other propositions that are obviously true\nbecause of definitions. But some philosophers claim we can know more\nsignificant moral propositions a priori.\n\nOn one familiar view, we can know a priori the fundamental\nmoral principle (or principles), e.g., the principle that one ought to\nperform the action that has the overall best consequences, or the\nprinciple that one ought to act in accordance with virtue, or whatever\nthe basic moral principle really is. Some hold we can know the\nprinciple via analysis or because it defines the moral term it is\nabout. We can then know every day moral propositions about particular\nactions or types of actions by inferring them from the fundamental\nprinciple in conjunction with empirical facts.\n\nHowever, some theorists claim we can know many more moral propositions\na priori, in particular, propositions that are not so closely\ntied to the meaning or reference of moral terms. Others go farther,\nclaiming that most or all moral claims can be known a priori,\nor even that moral claims can be known only a\npriori.\n\nIn this entry, we clarify the concept of a priori knowledge\n(and related concepts), as well as the relationship between a\npriori knowledge and analyticity. We then review Kant\u2019s\nview of moral knowledge, early 20th century versions of\nnon-naturalism, late 20th century versions of naturalism,\nparticularism, and finally some 21st century versions of\nintuitionism\u2014all with an eye to the role they afford to a\npriori knowledge.\n",
