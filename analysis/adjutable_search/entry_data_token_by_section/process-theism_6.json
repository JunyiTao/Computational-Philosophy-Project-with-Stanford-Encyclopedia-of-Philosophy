    "main_text": "Panentheism\n5. Panentheism\n\nThe doctrine of prehension, developed by Whitehead but also\nenthusiastically endorsed by Hartshorne, insures that the world is,\nin some sense, part of God. Actual entities, by virtue of\ntheir prehensions of one another, are internally related to their\npredecessors and externally related to their successors.\nWhitehead\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d philosophy can thereby affirm\nboth that an individual is in the world and the world is\nin the individual. This generalization applies equally to\nGod, but with differences that allow for a clear distinction between\nthe divine and the non-divine. Whitehead maintains that events in the\nworld have a specific locus with reference to God, but God has no\nlocus with reference to the world (Johnson 1983, 9). Hartshorne says\nthat God is the one individual conceivable a priori\u2014God\nis individuated by, though not exhausted by, concepts alone\n(Hartshorne 1948, 31). This is because God\u2019s scope of\ninteraction is universal whereas the scope of interaction for any\ncreature is localized. To be God is to causally affect and be affected\nby every real being; to be a non-divine entity is to causally\naffect and be affected by some, but not all, creatures.\nWhitehead and Hartshorne also say that God and the creatures differ in\nthe quality of interaction. For example, any non-divine\nindividual\u2019s knowledge of others is imperfect and partial\nwhereas God\u2019s knowledge is without defect (Hartshorne 1967,\n40).\n\nWhile both philosophers deny that God has location within the\nuniverse, they consider God to be in some sense a physical or\nmaterial being. Since process thought affirms the goodness of God, it\nis clear that it denies the ancient Manichean and Gnostic ideas that\nthere is something inherently evil in being material. Even so, in\norder to fully appreciate the process view, it is well to keep in mind\nthat Whitehead and Hartshorne reject the traditional concept of matter\nas devoid of any activity or feeling\u2014Whitehead refers to the\ntraditional view of matter as \u201cvacuous actuality.\u201d Because\nactual entities are dipolar, all of them have a physical aspect, but\nnone are entirely lacking in psychic qualities, although in most cases\nthese qualities are negligible. Thus, in process thought, being\nphysical does not mean having no mind-like qualities. The closest\nanticipation of process ideas about mind and body are in Leibniz,\nalthough process thought denies Leibniz\u2019s view that the monads\nhave no \u201cwindows.\u201d Leibniz maintains that no monad enters\ninto the internal constitution of another; Whitehead\u2019s doctrine\nof prehension insures that actual entities are internally related to\ntheir predecessors.\n\nA common criticism of process theism is that it conceives God as\n\u201cneeding\u201d the world. In one sense this is true, but in\nanother sense it is false. It is true that, in process metaphysics,\nthe structure of reality is social, and necessarily so. Thus, it\npromotes a social view of God\u2014God as necessarily related to\nnon-divine actualities. On the other hand, the process God does not\nrequire any particular universe in order to exist. Whitehead speaks of\na succession of \u201ccosmic epochs\u201d which are, in effect,\ndifferent universes where the very laws of nature are different. God\npresides over each universe as its eminent creative power, making\npossible all localized expressions of creativity, but no universe\nsustains God\u2019s existence. Hartshorne makes a similar point by\ncomparing God\u2019s existence and actuality to a set that\nnecessarily has members. \u201cTo say that a class could not be empty\nis not at all to say that its particular members are necessary\u201d\n(Hartshorne 1970, 144). From the perspective of process theism, the\ncriticism that God \u201cneeds\u201d the universe is, at best,\nsimply another way of raising the question of how best to conceive the\nnecessarily existent: Is it, or is it not, social in nature?\n\nTrinitarians sometimes argue that a social concept of ultimate reality\ncan be formulated if God is necessarily related to the divine self.\nProcess theists, especially those who are Christians, are not averse\nto this suggestion. Nevertheless, if this is to be taken seriously as\na philosophical proposal, then there can be no mere appeal to the\n\u201cmystery\u201d of the Trinity. Some effort should be made to\nretain the primary meaning of \u201csocial\u201d as multiple\nentities in a network of relations, some of which are internal and\nsome external. That is to say, a genuinely social concept of reality\nis one in which the multiple identities of each of the interrelated\nand interacting entities are not absorbed into each other. Whitehead\nand Hartshorne claim to do this apart from the Christian doctrine of\nthe Trinity, but there is no reason a priori to suppose that\nTrinitarian metaphysics cannot be one version of process metaphysics,\nor that the latter could not be adapted to the former (Boyd 1992;\nInbody 1997, ch. 8; Bracken and Suchocki 2005).\n\nWhitehead and Hartshorne part company concerning the proper analogy\nfor conceiving the God-world relation. Hartshorne modifies\nPlato\u2019s world-soul analogy in the Timaeus\n(30a\u201334c). In Plato\u2019s myth, the eternal demiurge creates a\nuniverse that is a living creature, animated by a soul. Hartshorne\nargues that the best philosophical interpretation of the myth is to\nconsider the demiurge and the world-soul as two aspects of the same\ndeity (Hartshorne & Reese 1953 [2000, 55]). If this is correct, then\nPlato affirms a version of dual transcendence, with one aspect of God\nbeing the universe. According to this interpretation, Plato came close\nto Hartshorne\u2019s view that, \u201cthe world is God\u2019s\nbody\u201d (Hartshorne 1941, 185; Dombrowski 2005, chapter 1). This\nis not to say that God has a location within the universe, but that\nthe location of the universe is in God, for the divine\nbeing-in-becoming is all-inclusive. Hartshorne borrows a word invented\nby Karl Krause (1781\u20131832) to express this view:\npanentheism\u2014everything (pan, all) is in\n(en, in) God (theos, God) (Cooper 2006, 121).\nPanentheism is a mediating position between pantheism and classical\ntheism. For pantheism, the world is identical to God; for classical\ntheism, the world is completely external to God; for panentheism, the\nworld is within God.\n\nHartshorne makes qualifications to Plato\u2019s analogy. Whereas\nPlato apparently conceives the soul-body (or mind-body) relationship\nas a one-to-one relation, Hartshorne, following modern biology, argues\nthat it is more plausible to construe it as a one-to-many relation.\nThe human body is a hierarchical society of thousands of kinds of\ncells. Thus, Hartshorne maintains that God is related to the universe\nin a manner similar to the way that a person is related to the cells\nof his or her body. In an important respect, Whitehead can make a\nbetter claim than Hartshorne that the relationship of God to the World\nis one-to-many. Whitehead\u2019s God is a single actual entity\nwhereas Hartshorne\u2019s God is a society. Thus, if it is a question\nof the relations of actual entities, then the God-to-World relation in\nHartshorne\u2019s theism is a many-to-many relation.\nHartshorne\u2019s point requires clarification: God, a single\nenduring object, is related to every non-divine actual entity and\nsociety. Clarity on this point brings out another comparison. By\nconceiving God as an actual entity, Whitehead weakens the analogy\nbetween God and a person. Donald Sherburne shows that in\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics, persons are enduring objects of a\nspecific type (Sherburne 1969). Therefore, Hartshorne\u2019s view of\nGod as an enduring object apparently provides more of a basis for\nspeaking of God as a person.\n\nRandall E. Auxier and Gary L. Herstein (2017) maintain, on the\ncontrary, that a Whiteheadian view is friendlier to conceiving God as\na person than Hartshorne\u2019s view. Their argument turns on the\nidea of negative prehensions, that is, experience which\n\u201celiminates [certain data] from feeling\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978,\n23]). According to Auxier and Herstein, one cannot be a person or\nexperience temporal passage apart from negative prehensions, which,\nthey say, allow distinctions both between what was and what\nmight-have-been and between what will-be and what\nmight-be (Auxier and Herstein 2017, 243 and 265). Hartshorne\nconsistently rejected the idea of negative prehensions in God whereas\nWhitehead, at least in some of his statements, seemed to allow for\nthem. The metaphysical issues run deep; suffice it to say that\nHartshorne distinguished the actual and the possible in ways that\ndiverged significantly from Whitehead (see Ramal 2010,\n139\u2013157).\n\nTo speak of God as a person is, of course, an analogy. A\nperson\u2019s feelings cannot be entirely separated from the feelings\nof cells in the body\u2014damage to the cells hurts the person. In a\nsimilar fashion, God is affected by what affects the creatures. On the\nother hand, God knows\u2014in Whiteheadian language, God\nprehends\u2014each \u201ccell\u201d of the divine body in a\nperfectly distinct fashion whereas others experience their cells\nen masse, much as one sees the green of the grass but not\neach blade. Another difference, as we have seen, is that God is not\nlocated within the universe as are non-divine individuals. Hartshorne\nturns this difference to his advantage by following a suggestion in\nPlato. He says that Plato\u2019s argument concerning the spherical\nnature of the universe adequately explains why the divine body has\nneither internal organs nor sense organs. Bodily organs in the\ncreatures, including a central nervous system, are needed to mediate\nwith an external environment, but there is nothing external to the\nuniverse (Hartshorne 1984, 134). God\u2019s only\n\u201cenvironment\u201d is internal to God. Thus, the world-soul\nanalogy does not entail that God has a brain or any other bodily organ\nthat one finds in the creatures. In addition, the lack of an external\nenvironment for God means that there can be no threat to the divine\nexistence from such a source. The \u201charm\u201d done to God by\ncreaturely suffering can never be fatal.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s view of God as a single actual entity is arguably\none factor that prevented him from taking the Platonic analogy as a\nserious proposal. His remarks on the topic are entirely negative. He\ncalled the Timaeus Plato\u2019s \u201cmost unfortunate essay\nin mythology,\u201d and he referred to the idea of the World-Soul,\nconsidered as an emanation, as \u201cthe parent of puerile\nmetaphysics\u201d (Whitehead 1933, 166; ch. VIII, sec. VI). Whitehead\nread the dialogue through the lens of neo-Platonism, conceiving the\nworld-soul as an emanation from a wholly transcendent demiurge.\nHartshorne agrees that this is not the solution to the problem of\npermanence and flux. However, Hartshorne sees in Plato\u2019s myth\nthe elements of a solution, provided the demiurge and the world-soul\nare not separate deities, but aspects of the same deity. For this\nreason, Hartshorne says that Whitehead rejected the analogy for\n\u201cweak reasons\u201d (Hahn 1991, 642).\n\nLate in his career, Hartshorne saw other advantages to the world-soul\nanalogy that touch on the problem of God and gender. He was\nsympathetic to feminist complaints about the male bias in traditional\ntheology and he made a concerted effort in the closing decades of his\nlife to use inclusive language (Hartshorne 1987 [2001, 258]). For example, in\nthe 1980s he began using \u201cHe-She\u201d when referring to God\nand he remarked in 1996 that he would title his third book Our\nVision of God rather than Man\u2019s Vision of God\n(Auxier and Davies 2001, 159). Hartshorne goes further than simply\nworrying about pronouns. If the world-soul analogy is combined with\nthe parent-to-child analogy, then he argues that, \u201cit is the\nmother, not the father, who furnishes by far the best symbol of deity.\nThe fetus-mother relationship is decidedly more intimate than the\nfetus-father relationship\u201d (Hartshorne 1984, 60). Hartshorne\nnever expressed his thoughts on feminism systematically, but it is\ninstructive that Carol P. Christ explicitly develops her feminist\nphilosophy of religion in light of Hartshorne\u2019s metaphysics in\nher book She Who Changes. Generally speaking, feminist\ntheologians have been friendly to process thought, seeing Whitehead\nand Hartshorne as articulating ideas about the divine that speak to\nfeminist concerns (Christ 2003, 4\u20135).\n\nOne objection to the concept of a deity whose \u201cbody\u201d is\nthe universe is that it implies that all values, both the good and the\nevil, are within God. Hartshorne counters that this is true, but not\nin a sense that compromises divine goodness. As a point of logic,\nwholes do not necessarily share the characteristics of their parts. On\nHartshorne\u2019s model, the relation of God to any non-divine\ncreature is a relation of whole to part. Indeed, this is the basis of\nHartshorne\u2019s view of religion as the acceptance of our\nfragmentariness\u2014we are fragments of the cosmos, not the whole of\nit. Thus, Hartshorne can say that God\u2019s goodness is not\ndiminished if a fragmentary being is heedless of the good of others,\nby indifference or harmful intent. Nevertheless, precisely because\nof God\u2019s goodness, the suffering and wickedness of the\ncreatures enter God\u2019s experience. God sympathizes with the\nsufferer and grieves for the criminal in losing an opportunity for\ncreating the good. God can feel the contrast between what could have\nbeen and what is. The \u201cwhat is,\u201d moreover, is not\nunilaterally determined by God but is left, in part, to the creatures;\nwe have seen that God and the creatures are co-creators in process\ntheism. For this reason, Hartshorne, following Berdyaev, speaks of\ntragic and sublime aspects of divine love (cf. Hartshorne 1953,\nchapter 8). Whitehead agrees that, \u201cthere is a tragedy which\neven God does not escape\u201d (Johnson 1983, 7).\n",
