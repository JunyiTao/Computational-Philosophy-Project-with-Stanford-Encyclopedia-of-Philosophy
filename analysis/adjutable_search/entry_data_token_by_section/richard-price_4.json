    "main_text": "Price\u2019s Moral Philosophy || Virtue\n2.4 Virtue \n2.4.1 Virtuous motivation\n\nWhat is it to be virtuous? A virtuous act is one that is motivated by\nthe sense of duty\u2014a recognition of what morality requires and\nforbids. What of actions that are motivated by other concerns? While\nPrice denies any moral worth to actions not motivated by a sense of\nduty, he seems to allow that, where motives are mixed, moral credit\nshould be given to the degree to which considerations of duty\nmotivate.\n\n\nBut instinctive benevolence is no principle of virtue, nor\nare any actions flowing merely from it virtuous. \u2026 All actions\n\u2026 appear to have as much less moral value, as they are derived\nmore from natural instinct, and less attended with reflexion on their\nreasonableness and fitness. (R 191)\n\n\nHow is it that humans so often ignore the call of duty? The answer\nlies in the other motivational forces in our nature, such as\nself-love, desires, and the emotions, which can conflict with\ndutifulness. But we are not helpless in the face of these impulses; we\ncan resist at least some of them at will, and we can learn to control\nthem better by developing our character. How our character develops is\nto some extent under our control because personality traits can be\nstrengthened or weakened by practice. Since we are imperfectly\nrational, we should strive to modify our desires and feelings so that\nit is easier for us to do our duty.\n\nBut in what does our duty consist? Price distinguishes between what he\nterms abstract and practical virtue, or what was later (by Prichard\nand Ross) called objective and subjective duty. An agent\u2019s\nobjective duty is what she is morally required to do, given the actual\nfacts of the case; her subjective duty lies in what she should do,\ngiven her reasonable beliefs about the facts of the case. It\nis for succeeding or failing to do one\u2019s subjective duty that\none should be praised or blamed, for an imperfect agent cannot be\nrequired to avoid all errors of fact.\n2.4.2 Supererogation\n\nWhat is it to be perfectly virtuous? Is it sufficient simply\nto perform all our duties, or is there something even better, as many\nhave supposed: meritorious acts of heroism or saintliness that exceed\nwhat is morally required and are singled out for special praise? Price\nmaintains that there are no such supererogatory acts\u2014acts that\ngo beyond the call of duty. Why? Price holds that any action must be\neither right (i.e., required), or wrong, or indifferent.\nSupererogatory actions do not fit this pattern. They are not required\nbut their performance is not morally indifferent. Rejecting the\nsupererogatory leads Price to a counter-intuitive conclusion. \n\n\nTo aim at acting beyond obligation, being the same with\nacting contrary to obligation; and doing more than\nis fit to be done, the same with doing wrong. (R 124)\n\n\nIf we find this doctrine harsh, there are two possible responses. The\nfirst is to add a further category to Price\u2019s tripartite\ndistinction. Price suggests that some may wish to deny that\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cobligatory\u201d are co-extensive.\n\n\nAll right actions are not so in precisely the same sense; and it might\n\u2026 be granted, that some things are right in such a sense as yet\nnot to be our indispensable duty. (R 120)\n\n\nPrice\u2019s only comment on this approach is that it would undermine\na symmetry between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d as he\nis using them. It allows cases where an action is right but not\nrequired, but there are still no cases in which an action is wrong but\nnot forbidden. Price does not reject this approach but thinks it\nunnecessarily complicated.\n\nHe prefers to retain his original tripartite structure, but to soften\nany apparent harshness by further explanation. Many of our\nobligations, such as that of being benevolent, are framed only in\ngeneral and vague terms. How and when we fulfill them is, to some\nextent, up to us. Since it is unclear exactly how much is required of\nus by way of kind deeds, a truly virtuous person will err on the side\nof generosity. The praise we bestow on them is not, as the proponent\nof supererogation supposes, because they exceeded the demands of duty,\nbut because they showed such scrupulous care to ensure that they did\nnot fall short of what was required of them. This solution has the\nadvantage of explaining why the heroic or saintly frequently claim\nthat they were, after all, only doing their duty, rather than claiming\nthat they were exceeding it.\n2.4.3 Promising\n\nMost of Price\u2019s claims are defensible, and many have been\nadopted by other prominent thinkers in the Intuitionist tradition. But\nthere is one issue on which he has generally, but not universally,\nbeen held to have gone astray: namely, the source of our obligation to\nkeep our promises. Instead of taking it to be a distinct species of\nduty, Price holds that \u201cfidelity to promises is\nproperly a branch or instance of veracity\u201d (R\n155). We must distinguish, Price claims, between statements about the\npresent and statements about the future. Expressing an intention or a\nresolution to act does not, Price allows, give rise to obligation.\n\n\nFor when I say I intend to do such and such, I affirm only a present\nfact.\u2014But to promise, is to declare that such a thing\nshall be done. \u2026 In this case, it is not enough to\nacquit me from the charge of falsehood, that I intend to do\nwhat I promise, but it must be actually done, agreeably to the\nassurances given. (R 155)\n\n\nPrice allows that I can confidently and reasonably make predictions\nabout events outside my control that subsequently turn out to be\nfalse, without being guilty of lying. But in the case of\nactions that lie within our power\n\n\nthe falsehood must be known and wilful, and entirely imputable to our\nown neglect and guilt. (R 156)\n\n\nThis view has been attacked on a number of counts. First, acts of\nlying are datable; when someone lies they do so at a particular time,\nin a particular place, and to a particular audience. While the\ncontent of a false assertion may concern the future, the lie\noccurs at the time of utterance. If someone fails to do what they said\nshe would, she does not lie at that later time, for at that later time\nshe asserts nothing. Nor does she lie when she says she will do it\nbecause, ex hypothesi, she sincerely believed at that time\nthat she would. If the deed does not follow her words she may be\nguilty of many things: weakness of will, or laziness, cowardice,\npusillanimity, depending on the circumstances. If she has led\nsomeone to rely on her earlier assertion, she may be accused of breach\nof faith, or going back on her word. But what she is not guilty of is\nlying. She would only be guilty of that if she was not\nexpressing a sincere belief when she made the original assertion.\n\nSecond, Price\u2019s view fails to account for the fact that promises\nare made to particular individuals. Suppose Shakira promises\nTom, in the presence of Miguel, that she will pick him up at the\nairport when he returns from his journey. Miguel later discovers that\nhe is flying in to the airport at the same time as Tom and awaits\nShakira\u2019s arrival hoping for a ride. Each has taken Shakira at\nher word and relied on her for transport home. On Price\u2019s\naccount, if Shakira does not show up (without an adequate excuse) then\nshe has lied to both of them, and hence both have the same cause for\ncomplaint. However, Tom has a complaint against Shakira that\nMiguel does not have, for Shakira\u2019s promise was to Tom\nand not to Miguel. It is Tom that she has let down, and not Miguel.\nArguably, Miguel has no complaint against Shakira. He\nreasonably believed that she would show up, but she had offered him no\nassurances. Further, only Tom can let Shakira off her promise, while\nMiguel has no such power.\n\nThere are, indeed, lying promises, but these are ones where\nthe promisor has, at the time he makes it, no intention of carrying it\nout. If my promise is sincere but I fail (without adequate excuse) to\nfulfill it I may be a scoundrel, but not a lying\nscoundrel.\n\nThese are weighty criticisms, but they may be uncharitable to Price.\nThough veracity is, of course, the virtue that concerns truth, Price\nhas a wider conception of what it involves than merely avoiding\nlying.\n\n\nUnder this head, I would comprehend impartiality and honesty of mind\nin our enquiries after truth, as well as a sacred regard to it in all\nwe say; fair and ingenuous dealing; such an openness and simplicity of\ntemper as exclude guile and prevarication, and all the contemptible\narts of craft, equivocation and hypocrisy; fidelity to our\nengagements; sincerity and uprightness in our transactions with\nourselves as well as others; and the careful avoiding of all secret\nattempts to deceive ourselves, and to evade or disguise the truth in\nexamining our own characters. (R 154\u20135)\n\n\nThis is a good description of the virtue of honesty (or\nstraightforwardness, or trustworthiness). And one might reasonably\ndescribe someone who fails to keep their word as dishonest. Moreover,\nguile and deception need not involve lying. Iago does not lie\nwhen he leaves Desdemona\u2019s handkerchief for Othello to find. And\nthere is being \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d, and casuistry\nof all kinds. Understood thus, there is nothing untoward in Price\ngrouping these desirable qualities together. But\n\u201cveracity\u201d, with its narrow implication of truth-telling,\ndoes not happily cover this wide range of characteristics and Price\noften forgets his official definition and equates honesty with\ntruthfulness.\n\nPart of what Price is doing is to resolve a puzzle raised by Hume in\nthe Treatise.\n\n\n[S]ince the act of the mind, which enters into a promise, and produces\nits obligation, is neither the resolving, desiring, nor willing any\nparticular performance, it must necessarily be the willing of\nthat obligation, which arises from the promise. Nor is this\nonly a conclusion of philosophy; but is entirely conformable to our\ncommon ways of thinking and of expressing ourselves, when we say that\nwe are bound by our own consent, and that the obligation arises from\nour mere will and pleasure. The only question, then, is, whether there\nbe not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind, and\nsuch an absurdity as no man cou'd fall into, whose ideas are not\nconfounded with prejudice and the fallacious use of language.\n(1739\u201340: 516\u20137; III.ii.5)\n\n\nHume\u2019s puzzle is: how can I, by a mere act of will, create a\nnew obligation? In making a promise, I would thereby declare that\nI am creating an obligation to do something, that was previously\nmorally indifferent. I would somehow make it the case that I am now\nunder an obligation I was not under before. Yet nothing about the act\nI promise to do has changed. How can mere words transform the moral\nlandscape?\n\nPrice agrees with Hume that obligations cannot be created simply by an\nact of will, but denies that this is the correct conception of\npromising. He first tackles this problem when defending his\nanti-voluntarist account of obligation. On his view, which he takes\nfrom Cudworth, each action has a nature in virtue of which it is\nrequired, forbidden, or indifferent.\n\n\nNo will \u2026 can render any thing good and obligatory,\nwhich was not so antecedently, and from eternity. (R 50)\n\n\nIf an act is morally indifferent, then no mere act of will can change\nits moral status. Price considers the objection that the command of\nGod, or a sovereign, may do just that. Price replies:\n\n\nIt is true, the doing of any indifferent thing may become obligatory,\nin consequence of a command from a being possessed of rightful\nauthority over us: But \u2026 in this case, the command produces a\nchange in the circumstances of the agent, and that what, in\nconsequence of it, becomes obligatory, is not the same with what\nbefore was indifferent. (R 51)\n\n\nAs Price puts it, the \u201cmatter of the action\u201d remains the\nsame, but it now falls under a moral law that it did not before. In\nvirtue of changed circumstances, what was previously indifferent can\nbecome an instance of gratitude, or obedience to a lawful command or,\nindeed, an instance of promise-keeping. In this last case we should\nnot suppose\n\n\nthat our own will or breath alters the nature of things by making what\nis indifferent not so. \u2026 All that the promise does, is,\n\u2026 to cause that to be an instance of right conduct [in\nearlier editions, Price writes \u2018of a general and eternal duty]\nwhich was not so before. (R 51)\n\n\nPrice\u2019s answer to Hume is that, though we cannot create\nan obligation by our mere will and pleasure, we can place\nourselves under an obligation by what we do or say, including\nwhen what we say expresses our will. On this central point, Price is\ncorrect. As we have seen, Price holds that the species of obligation\nunder which I place myself in promising is veracity. \nIt may be that the moral category of honesty or trustworthiness would\nbetter capture what Price wants to say, but that is of comparatively\nsecondary importance.\n3. Theology\n\nPrice\u2019s writings on theology and philosophy of religion are\nextensive and complex. After a brief discussion of his views about\nGod\u2019s nature and the arguments for his existence, \nthis section will\nfocus on those aspects of his views that bear on morality, and his\ndiscussion of the credibility of miracles.\n3.1 A priori Arguments for God\u2019s existence\n\nPrice appended to the Review a \u201cDissertation on the\nBeing and Attributes of the Deity\u201d, in which he largely follows\nSamuel Clarke\u2019s a priori arguments to show that there\nmust be a first cause that is perfect in every respect. He begins with\na version of the well-known argument from contingency, which proceeds\nfrom things that exist contingently to something that exists\nnon-contingently, i.e., necessarily. Price accepts the argument but\nholds that previous writers have not properly explained the nature of\nthe necessity of God\u2019s existence. The necessity in question is\nnot what he terms \u201crelative\u201d or\n\u201cconsequential\u201d necessity, as when we say there must be a\ncause of every effect. Rather,\n\n\nthe impossibility of not existing implied in the necessity of\nGod\u2019s existence is \u2026 an impossibility appearing\nimmediately, and carrying its own evidence with it; an\nimpossibility in the nature of the thing itself. (R 287)\n\n\nPrice then goes on, in short order, to deduce several conclusions.\nFirst, that the \u201cnecessity of God\u2019s existence\nimplies that it is necessary \u2026 to the very conception\nof all other existence\u201d (R 288). What can be conceived without a\ndivine ground can be conceived as existing alone. Such beings\n\n\nmight be conceived to exist without him, which is the same as\nconceiving him not to exist, and consequently, with the\npossibility of his non-existence. (R 288)\n\n\nWhat exists necessarily can have no limits or imperfections. For what\nis limited could have had different limits, and so the limited has\nonly contingent existence. Finally, and for our purposes most\nimportantly, a necessary being does not possess its properties, as\nother things do, by participation in those properties as\nsomething distinct from it. Suppose, for example, God were to be\nomnipresent by existing in every part of space, then we could\nconceive of infinite space without him. But if space were\ndistinct from him we would need an explanation of why he existed in\nall of it, rather than in some part, or in none. The same, Price says,\nis true of God\u2019s relation to all his attributes, which he must\npossess\n\n\nin a manner peculiar to himself. He is intelligent, not by the\napprehension of truth, but by being truth. (R\n290)\n\n\nAnd so on, for all his other attributes.\n\n\nThere can be numberless beings who are powerful, wise and benevolent;\nbut there can be but one being of whose nature, power, wisdom\nand benevolence in necessary union and forming one idea, are the\nessential attributes. (R 295)\n\n\nPrice did not publish this piece for some time, and remained\nconcerned that the \u201cparticular imperfection\nof language\u201d rendered him \u201cincapable of stating [his view]\nwith sufficient correctness and clearness\u201d (R 286). \nIt is indeed rather puzzling. His view is clearly influenced by\nthe neo-Platonism which, presumably, he gets from Cudworth.\nNecessary truths depend on the Forms, on their self-identity. The\nForms constitute a purely intelligible realm, and other things are\nintelligible only in so far as they participate in the Forms. Since\nthe Forms are purely intelligible beings their mode of being, the manner in which they exist is by being\nthought. That which thinks the Forms, namely God, is that in which\nthey are. They cannot exist independently, because their very being is\nto be a part of his nature. And it is his own nature governs his\nwill.\n\nBe that as it may, Price\u2019s account of God\u2019s nature enables\nhim to deal with a standard objection to those who reject the Divine\nCommand Theory of morality. If we conceive of morality as a set of\ntruths that are outside God\u2019s control, are we not demeaning\nGod\u2019s sovereignty, by supposing that there is something both\nexternal to him and co-eternal with him? Price\u2019s answer is that\nGod\u2019s rectitude consists, not in obeying some principles that he\ndid not create, cannot change, and must accept, but in following his\nown nature.\n3.2 Natural Theology\n\nLike Cleanthes in Hume\u2019s Dialogues, Price holds that\nbelief in a Designer is immediate and irresistible. \u201cThis\nvisible universe \u2026 is self-evidently, an exhibition of\nthe power and wisdom of a powerful and wise cause\u201d (R 285) But\nwhat of his moral qualities? Although in his introduction to the\n\u201cDissertation\u201d, Price claims that a posteriori\narguments also show the Designer to be good, in Chapter X of the\nReview, Price strikes a cautious note. There may be much more\nof good than bad in the works of that Designer, but we might wonder\nwhether that is sufficient grounds for drawing conclusions about the\nDesigner\u2019s moral character. For a malicious being could produce\nhappiness, and perhaps the Designer grants us happiness now only to\nfrustrate our expectations in order to increase our misery later by\ncontrast to our present state. Price himself thinks that, despite such\npossibilities, we are justified in inferring God\u2019s goodness from\nhis creation but accepts that such inferences are open to cavil.\nHowever, as a moral realist, Price does not need to rely on arguments\nfrom the distribution of good and bad things in the world. For if\nbenevolence is, in itself better than malice, justice than injustice,\nand so on, and if an intelligent mind must both recognize and be\nguided by these thoughts, then we can know a priori that God\nis morally perfect.\n\nNevertheless, it is a striking fact that virtue is not always\nproportionately rewarded, nor vice punished. Price is more realistic\non this point than Butler who said \u201cSelf-love then, though\nconfined to the interest of the present world, does in general\nperfectly coincide with virtue\u201d (1729: Sermon 3, para. 8 [2017:\n36]). Not only do the virtuous often suffer and the vicious flourish,\nbut the virtuous are open to peculiar psychological sufferings of\nwhich the vicious know nothing. They may suffer from an over\nscrupulous conscience, from guilt, and consciousness of their own\nunworthiness.\n\n\nIt can scarcely be denied with respect to wickedness, that it would\nvery frequently be much better for a man, (I mean for his own present\nease) to be thoroughly wicked than partially so. (R\n259)\n\n\nSo much is this the case that Price contends\n\n\nthis world appears fitted more to be a school for the\neducation of virtue, than a station of honour to it. (R\n257)\n\n\nWhat may we infer from these rather dismal facts with respect to a\nfuture life? If we are moral sentimentalists, nothing. But if we\naccept moral realism then we know that a wise Designer will also be a\nmorally good one. From this we may conclude that there is some future\nscene of life in which these imbalances between virtue and reward will\nbe rectified. We cannot, however, infer that this future life will be\nendless, for the injustices of this life could be rectified in a\nfinite time.\n\n\nThat we are to be delivered to from death to a new life that shall\nnever end of complete happiness, this is unspeakably\nmore than any arguments from distributive justice can teach us to\nexpect. (R 263)\n\n\nIt is revelation alone that can assure us of God\u2019s graciousness\nin this respect.\n3.3 Miracles\n\nPrice\u2019s illuminating discussion of Hume\u2019s notorious attack\non the credibility of miracles is informed both by his interest in\nprobability theory, and by his good sense. Hume\u2019s argument, in a\nnutshell, is that there can never be sufficient reason to believe in a\nviolation of a law of nature because we know, a priori, that\nany evidence from testimony for the occurrence of a miracle will be\noutweighed by our evidence from long experience that such things do\nnot happen. Our confidence in the reliability of testimony and our\nconfidence in some generalization being a law of nature have the same\nsource: experience. But whereas we have often found testimony to be\nfalse, the experiences on which our belief in a law of nature is\nfounded are exceptionless. If there were exceptions, we would conclude\nthat we were not dealing with a law of nature. So we always have more\nevidence that a miracle did not occur than that it did. Hume presents\nus with a characteristic fork. If what is reported would violate a law\nof nature, then we should not give credence to the report. If what is\nreported is merely uncommon, then we might have sufficient evidence to\nbelieve it, but the event would not be miraculous.\n\nPrice disputes four claims, on which he thinks Hume\u2019s argument\nrests.\nThe most important are the first three.\n\n \u201cThat the credit we give to testimony, is derived\nsolely from experience\u201d\n \u201cThat a miracle is a fact contrary to\nexperience\u201d\n \u201cThat the previous improbability of a fact is a proof\nagainst it, diminishing, in proportion to the degree of it, the proof\nfrom testimony for it\u201d (D 389).\n\n\nPrice\u2019s rebuttals are as follows.\n\nOur confidence in the reliability of testimony rests, and should\nrest, not only on the frequency with which testimony has been\nconfirmed balanced against the frequency with which it has been\ndisconfirmed, but also on our knowledge of the character(s) of those\nbearing witness, and of people in general.\n\n\nOne action, or one conversation with a man, may convince us of his\nintegrity and induce us to believe his testimony, though we have\nnever, in a single instance, experienced his veracity. (D 399)\n\n\u201cA miracle is more properly an event different from\nexperience than contrary to it\u201d (D 402). Testimony to\nan unusual event, while it provides evidence for the occurrence of\nthat event, does not contradict our experience of what\nhappened before, or even conflict with it. We would continue to be as\njustified as we were previously in believing that this kind of event\nhad not happened before. Prior uniform observation is not\nexperiential evidence against the occurrence of the unusual.\n\u201c[I]t can be no part of any one\u2019s experience, that the\ncourse of nature will continue always the same\u201d (D 402). Were\nthis not so, we could never have reason to believe that something we\npreviously took to be a law of nature was not in fact one.\n Price argues that it is very common for \u201cthe slightest\ntestimony to overcome an almost infinite improbability\u201d (D 406).\nThe prior probability of many common facts is extremely low, yet the\nevidence of testimony is sufficient to confirm them. Take an example\nwhere the prior probability can be calculated: the odds against any\nparticular distribution of cards in a game of Bridge are enormous. Yet\nthe testimony of the players as to what was in each hand is quite\nsufficient to establish that as a fact. What is more, Price argues,\nvariations in the prior improbability of the event are irrelevant when\nit comes to the weight of testimony. \u201cThe only causes of\nfalsehood in testimony are the intention to deceive, and the danger of\nbeing deceived\u201d (D 415). But the degree of prior improbability\ndoes not increase or diminish either of these.\n\n\nImprobabilities \u2026 as such, do not affect the\ncapacity of testimony to report truth. They \u2026 should\nnot be considered as a counter-evidence invalidating, in\nproportion to their degree, its reports.\u2014But tho\u2019 this is\ntrue, it by no means follows, that they may not in many circumstances\naffect the credit of testimony, or cause us to question its\nveracity. (D 417)\n \n\n\nAs Hume pointed out, mankind are lovers of the marvelous, and\nraconteurs delight in feeding that credulity. If someone reports a\ntruly astonishing event, especially if it redounds to the\nnarrator\u2019s credit, or supports some ideology she is keen to\npromote, that may lead us \u201cto question the faithfulness of a\nreport, and give just ground to suspect a design to misrepresent or\nexaggerate\u201d (D 420). Price points out, however, that this only\napplies when the reporter is aware of the marvelous nature of their\ntale. Mere coincidence does not diminish the evidential\nweight of testimony.\n\n\n[W]ere a person to tell us that \u2026 at the time of drawing a\nlottery, he happened to hear his age, the day of the month, and the\ndate of the year drawn together, we should scarcely believe him,\ntho\u2019 we know that he was not more unlikely to hear these numbers\ndrawn, than any other particular numbers. But if the same person was\nonly to tell us the numbers themselves, and the coincidence which\nstrikes us was entirely our own discovery, we should have just the\nsame reason for believing his account, as if there had been no such\ncoincidence. (D 422\u20133)\n\n\nThe upshot is that, in Price\u2019s view, the debate should neither\nfocus on the abstract possibility of evidence for miracles, nor on\ntheir prior improbability, but, rather, on the particular question of\nwhether the Apostles were either deceived or were themselves\ndeceivers. Price, needless to say, is confident of victory on this\nground, though others may demur.\n4. Liberty\n\nPrice distinguishes four different sorts of liberty all of which, he\nclaims, have a common theme.\n\n\n Physical liberty is \u201cthat principle of\nspontaneity, or self-determination, which constitutes us agents, or\nwhich gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly\nours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause\u201d (P\n21\u20132).\n Moral liberty \u201cis the power of following, in all\ncircumstances, our sense of right and wrong, or of acting in\nconformity to our reflecting and moral principles, without being\ncontrouled by any contrary principles\u201d (P 22)\n Religious liberty \u201cis the power of exercising,\nwithout molestation, that mode of religion which we think best\u201d\n(P 22)\n Civil liberty \u201cis the power of a civil society\n\u2026 to govern itself by its own discretion, or by laws of its own\nmaking\u201d (P 22).\n\n\n\nThe first two concern the issue of free will and moral responsibility;\nthe second two concern issues of political governance. Nevertheless,\nPrice contends, they are all forms of liberty because \u201cthere is\none general idea that runs through them all; \u2026 the idea of\nself-direction or self-government\u201d (P 22)\n4.1 Free will, rationality, and moral agency\n\nPrice distinguishes, in a way that anticipates Kant, two ways in which\nmy action may be free: the first, physical liberty, is freedom to\nchoose; the second is moral autonomy. Freedom of choice is required\nfor agency and hence for moral responsibility. But that freedom allows\nus to act wrongly as well as rightly, to be irrational as well as\nrational, to go astray as well as to go aright. When we go astray,\nPrice contends, by doing something we know we shouldn\u2019t, we feel\nourselves unfree, in that we have lost control. We lack self-mastery\nor moral autonomy: we have succumbed to temptation, instead of obeying\nthe moral law. As with Kant, moral autonomy is the triumph of both\nrationality and morality over countervailing desires, since we always\nhave most reason to fulfill our moral obligations. Price contends\nalso, in good Platonic fashion, that when we follow virtue we do what\nwe (really) want. It is fairly common to distinguish those parts of\none\u2019s personality with which one identifies, and that are taken\nto be its central core, and those impulses that are seen as external,\nalien, or even threatening. The metaphor of addiction or enslavement\nis virtually irresistible in explaining this distinction: we are under\nattack by passions which can take control of us if we are not careful,\nso that we no longer do what we want to do, but what these\nalien forces or siren voices tempt us to do. If we give in too often\nwe will have lost the battle and our autonomy; we will no longer be in\ncharge of our own lives, but succumb to what we reject, and even hate.\nSome philosophers hold that the agent has considerable choice in\ndetermining which parts of her personality are central and which\nperipheral. Price claims, however, that the central core of our\nidentity is metaphysically fixed.\n\n\n[What] is most properly a man\u2019s self \u2026 is\n\u2026 not his passions, but his reason or his judgment, prescribing\nwhat is right, and prohibiting what is wrong. The conscience of a man\nis the man; the reflecting principle is our supreme principle. It is\nwhat gives our distinction as intelligent creatures; and whenever we\nact contrary to it, we violate our natures, and are at variance with\nourselves. (Price 1816: 208, quoted in D.\nO. Thomas 1977: 170)\n\n\nIn short, physical liberty is a necessary condition of the capacity to\ndirect one\u2019s actions at all; moral liberty is exercising that\nagency to direct one\u2019s actions as normative reality\nrequires.\n4.2 Determinism and agent-causation\n\nThere is much to suggest that Price is a libertarian who denies\npsychological determinism and embraces agent-causation instead. It is\nwe, and not our psychological states, that determine our\nactions. The self stands above the fray, as it were, and decides which\nreasons or motives we will act on. The following passages are\ntypical.\n\n\nDetermination requires an efficient cause. If that cause is the being\nhimself, I plead for no more. If not, then it is no longer\nhis determination; that is, he is no longer the\ndeterminer, but the motive, or whatever else any one will say to be\nthe cause of the determination. To ask, what effects our\ndetermination, is the very same with asking who did an action, after\nbeing informed that such a one did it. (R 181\u20132)\n\n[It is] very plain, that motives can have no concern in\neffecting [the agent\u2019s] determination \u2026 What\nwould be more absurd than to say, that our inclinations act upon us,\nor compel us; that our desires and fears put us into motion,\nor produce our volitions; that is, are agents? (R\n183n)\n\n\nD. O. Thomas (1977: 160\u20132) points out, however, that there are\npassages in Price in which he appears to embrace psychological\ndeterminism, of which this is one of the most striking.\n\n\nWere we thoroughly acquainted with the heart of a man, the turn of his\ntemper, and the make of his mind, we should never want experience to\ninform us, what he will do, or how far he is to be trusted (R 28).\n\n\nSolving these difficulties is beyond the scope of this entry, but we\nmight note that while causal determinism (whether physical or\npsychological) entails that, in principle, all events are completely\npredictable, including human actions, the entailment does not run the\nother way. What is predictable need not be causally determined.\nConsider God, the morally perfect agent. He will always act according\nto the dictates of reason, and thus has moral freedom to the highest\ndegree. This need not preclude his having freedom of choice, however.\nPrice\u2019s view is that he has the power, the physical\nliberty, to do or abstain, but his character is such that he\nwill not do the wrong thing. (R 206)\n\nWhat of finite agents? In the passage from which the quotation comes,\nPrice is contrasting our belief that phenomena are regularly connected\nwith each other with a real understanding of why this is so.\n\n\nThe whole meaning of accounting for a fact, implies something in the\nnature of objects that includes a connexion between them, or a fitness\nin certain ways to influence one another. \u2026While we only see\none thing constantly attending or following another, without\nperceiving the real dependence and connexion \u2026 we are\nnecessarily dissatisfied. (R 27)\n\n\nGiven this context, Price may be claiming simply that, were we to\nunderstand the light in which an agent saw all the considerations\nrelevant to acting, we would know how he would choose. That may be\ncompatible with the agent\u2019s character being self-formed by his\nchoices.\n\nHere are two difficulties for Price\u2019s claim that understanding\nthe light in which someone saw their action would enable us to predict\nwhat they would do. First, it is questionable whether weak-willed\nactions are fully intelligible. Although the agent has reasons for\nwhat he does, they do not explain his making the worse rather than the\nbetter choice. Second, if we are genuinely able to form and change our\ncharacters through our choices, then there must be occasions on which\nwe act out of character. If there is real freedom of choice even God\nmight not know with complete certainty what we will do (though this view, known as Open Theism, might be unpalatable to\nPrice).\n4.3 Political Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s writings on religious and civil liberty are voluminous.\nMany are largely of historical interest, as they deal with issues of\nthe day, rather than broad principles.  The main claims of his social\nand political philosophy are briefly summarised in what follows.\n4.3.1 Religious Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s reasons for advocating complete freedom of religion are\nnumerous, but familiar. All religious tests for public office\nencourage persecution of the nonconformists as well as hypocrisy, by\ngiving incentives for outward subscription to something not believed.\nThey interfere with conscience, which is a private matter between an\nindividual and his deity. Above all, they hinder the great\nEnlightenment project of the onward march of reason and the\ndestruction of all forms of superstition. Toleration is insufficient,\nfor that implies that society recognizes one creed but tolerates\nothers. Full freedom should be extended to all religions, not just\ndifferent Christian denominations.\n4.3.2 Civil Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s political philosophy is, broadly speaking, in line with\nLocke\u2019s, but he follows it through to more radical conclusions.\nThe legitimacy of a government (though not of other hierarchical\ndistinctions) stems from the consent of the governed. Whereas in Locke\nthe people have a right to rebel only if there is a breach of the\nsocial contract, for Price they retain the right to alter their form\nof government as they wish. Direct democracy is the most desirable\nform of government, but in larger states democracy has perforce to be\nrepresentative. However, those elected are to be more delegates than\nrepresentatives, subject to instructions from their constituents (P\n25).\n\nIt is not clear how far Price thinks the franchise should be extended.\nThe logic of his position would seem to suggest universal suffrage,\nbut Price is no real advocate for it. He shares a common concern about\nthe qualifications of the uneducated and dependent to be voters.\nWriting of the election of British Members of Parliament before the\nGreat Reform Act of 1832, Price complains not only of the small size\nof the electorate, but also that voters are often drawn from the\n\u201cmeanest persons\u201d, the \u201clowest of the people\u201d.\nOne worry was that, insofar as they were dependent on landowners or\nemployers, their vote would not be genuinely independent.\nPrice appears never to have suggested extending the suffrage to women,\nperhaps because he thought them too ill educated and too dependent on\ntheir husbands or other male relatives. Price, unlike his friend\nWollstonecraft, appears never to have questioned the status quo in\nthis respect.\n\nCivil liberty, for Price, concerns the autonomy of a community or\nstate to make its own laws, free from outside interference. Important\nas this is, especially in the context of the American Revolution, it\nraises the question of what constitutes a distinct community or\nsociety. Does any dissident group constitute a community with the\nright to secede? This is an issue that has occasioned much violence\nand bloodshed, including the secession of the Southern States in 1860\nand, in our own day, Scottish, Basque, and Irish independence. The\nomission of a discussion of this seriously weakens his political\nphilosophy.\n\nOddly, Price does not include the liberty of the citizen as well as\nthe liberty of a country in his original definition of civil liberty.\nA country that governs itself can still be internally deeply\nrepressive. Price became aware of this deficiency, and expanded his\naccount in Additional Observations (P 76-100).\n\n\nA citizen is free when the power of commanding his own conduct and the\nquiet possession of his life, person, property and good name are\nsecured to him by being his own legislator \u2026 a government is\nfree when constituted in such a manner as to give this security. And\nthe freedom of a community or nation is the same among nations that\nthe freedom of a citizen is among his fellow-citizens. (P 82)\n\n\nThe best ways to secure a free government are the following:\n\n all parts of the state should be represented in the governing\nlegislature\n the representatives must be freely chosen by the electorate\n the representatives must be independent of any outside source of\npower\n they should be subject to frequent re-election\n they should be accountable to their constituents in all their\nacts\n\n\nThese proposals may now appear fairly modest, but few societies match\nup to them. For example, the power of corporate owners and lobbyists\nin funding elections in the United States breaches clause 3. The\nexistence of dependent territories, such as Puerto Rico, breaches\nclause 1. The existence of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom\nbreaches clauses 2 and 4. Revolutionary for the time, Price\u2019s\nsuggestions remain radical even today.\n5. Influence\n\nAlthough Price was influential in his lifetime in many areas, that\ninfluence soon waned, and few of his works were reprinted after his\ndeath. His immediate impact on discussion of the events surrounding\nthe American and French revolutions was large, but naturally faded as\nthose upheavals slipped into history. He died before the excesses of\nthe French revolution, which had been predicted by Burke. As a result\nof the success of his predictions, Burke acquired an immense\nreputation, while Price\u2019s was eclipsed. There is no doubt that\nPrice, along with others in the \u201cAge of Reason\u201d,\nexaggerated the degree to which people would pay attention to rational\nprinciples and reasonable solutions. There seems little to suggest\nthat his writings had a long-term impact on political philosophy.\nNevertheless, liberal-democratic societies have embraced many of\nPrice\u2019s causes; in that sense, in the longer term, Price could\nbe seen as being on the side of history after all.\n\nHis influence on the Unitarian movement also faded. His version of\nArianism, in which Christ was seen as having most of the supernatural\nattributes of the second person of the Trinity without actually being\nGod, gave way to the Socinian view, championed by Priestley, which\nstressed the straightforward humanity of Jesus. His reputation in\nactuarial work and demography suffered from his mistaken claim that\nthe British population was in decline. Even his beloved project of\nreducing or eliminating the national debt by means of a sinking fund\nfell out of favor.\n\nHis main legacy is, of course, in moral philosophy, but even here it\nis unclear how much direct influence he had. Some of the themes in\nA Review, especially issues to do with moral motivation and\nresponsibility, find distinct echoes in Kant, but that comes from\nsympathy of outlook, rather than influence. And Price\u2019s\nepistemology and metaphysics are wholly different from Kant\u2019s,\ndespite Hastings Rashdall\u2019s exaggerated claim that the\nReview \u201ccontains the gist of the Kantian doctrine\nwithout Kant\u2019s confusion\u201d (1907: 81 fn 1). The main\nfeatures of Price\u2019s epistemology, and his pluralism about moral\nprinciples, emerge again with the British Intuitionists who flourished\nin the first half of the twentieth century. While we know that C. D.\nBroad and Hastings Rashdall both rated Price very highly, \nthere is\nno direct evidence that Prichard, or even Ross (whose views most closely\nresemble Price\u2019s) had read him, though it seems likely they\ndid.\n\nInterest in Price was to some degree revived by books by Roland Thomas\n(1924), Carl Cone (1952), Lennart \u00c5qvist (1960), D. O. Thomas\n(1977), and W. D. Hudson (1970). Since then there has been a steady\ntrickle of articles on aspects of Price\u2019s work, but no real\ngroundswell of interest, despite another revival in the fortunes of\nIntuitionism towards the end of the twentieth century. In 1977 the\nPrice-Priestley Newsletter was founded; it morphed later into\nEnlightenment and Dissent, which ceased publication in 2016.\nHowever, resources for the study of Price have been greatly enhanced\nby the untiring work of D. O. Thomas who not only edited Price\u2019s\npolitical writings but, together with Bernard Peach, produced a\ncomplete edition of Price\u2019s correspondence.",
