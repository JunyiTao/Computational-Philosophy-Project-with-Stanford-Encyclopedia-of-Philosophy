    "main_text": "Two Toy Models\n4. Two Toy Models\n\nIn order to get a feeling for the sorts of implications that closed\ntimelike curves can have, it may be useful to consider two simple\nmodels. In space-times with closed timelike curves the traditional\ninitial value problem cannot be framed in the usual way. For it\npresupposes the existence of Cauchy surfaces, and if there are CTCs\nthen no Cauchy surface exists. (A Cauchy surface is a spacelike\nsurface such that every inextendable timelike curve crosses it exactly\nonce. One normally specifies initial conditions by giving the\nconditions on such a surface.) Nonetheless, if the topological\ncomplexities of the manifold are appropriately localized, we can come\nquite close. Let us call an edgeless spacelike surface \\(S\\) a\nquasi-Cauchy surface if it divides the rest of the manifold\ninto two parts such that\n\nevery point in the manifold can be connected by a timelike curve\nto \\(S\\), and\nany timelike curve which connects a point in one region to a point\nin the other region intersects \\(S\\) exactly once.\n\n\nIt is obvious that a quasi-Cauchy surface must entirely inhabit the\nnormal region of the space-time; if any point \\(p\\) of \\(S\\) is in the\ntime travel region, then any timelike curve which intersects \\(p\\) can\nbe extended to a timelike curve which intersects \\(S\\) near \\(p\\)\nagain. In extreme cases of time travel, a model may have no normal\nregion at all (e.g., Minkowski space-time rolled up like a cylinder in\na time-like direction), in which case our usual notions of temporal\nprecedence will not apply. But temporal anomalies like wormholes (and\ntime machines) can be sufficiently localized to permit the existence\nof quasi-Cauchy surfaces.\n\nGiven a timelike orientation, a quasi-Cauchy surface unproblematically\ndivides the manifold into its past (i.e., all points that can\nbe reached by past-directed timelike curves from \\(S)\\) and its\nfuture (ditto mutatis mutandis). If the whole past\nof \\(S\\) is in the normal region of the manifold, then \\(S\\) is a\npartial Cauchy surface: every inextendable timelike curve\nwhich exists to the past of \\(S\\) intersects \\(S\\) exactly once, but\n(if there is time travel in the future) not every inextendable\ntimelike curve which exists to the future of \\(S\\) intersects \\(S\\).\nNow we can ask a particularly clear question: consider a manifold\nwhich contains a time travel region, but also has a partial Cauchy\nsurface \\(S\\), such that all of the temporal funny business is to the\nfuture of \\(S\\). If all you could see were \\(S\\) and its past, you\nwould not know that the space-time had any time travel at all. The\nquestion is: are there any constraints on the sort of data which can\nbe put on \\(S\\) and continued to a global solution of the dynamics\nwhich are different from the constraints (if any) on the data which\ncan be put on a Cauchy surface in a simply connected manifold and\ncontinued to a global solution? If there is time travel to our future,\nmight we we able to tell this now, because of some implied oddity in\nthe arrangement of present things?\n\nIt is not at all surprising that there might be constraints on the\ndata which can be put on a locally space-like surface which passes\nthrough the time travel region: after all, we never think we can\nfreely specify what happens on a space-like surface and on another\nsuch surface to its future, but in this case the surface at issue lies\nto its own future. But if there were particular constraints for data\non a partial Cauchy surface then we would apparently need to have to\nrule out some sorts of otherwise acceptable states on \\(S\\) if there\nis to be time travel to the future of \\(S\\). We then might be able to\nestablish that there will be no time travel in the future by simple\ninspection of the present state of the universe. As we will see, there\nis reason to suspect that such constraints on the partial Cauchy\nsurface are non-generic. But we are getting ahead of ourselves: first\nlet\u2019s consider the effect of time travel on a very simple\ndynamics.\n\nThe simplest possible example is the Newtonian theory of perfectly\nelastic collisions among equally massive particles in one spatial\ndimension. The space-time is two-dimensional, so we can represent it\ninitially as the Euclidean plane, and the dynamics is completely\nspecified by two conditions. When particles are traveling freely,\ntheir world lines are straight lines in the space-time, and when two\nparticles collide, they exchange momenta, so the collision looks like\nan \u201c\\(X\\)\u201d in space-time, with each particle changing its\nmomentum at the\n impact.[2]\n The dynamics is purely local, in that one can check that a set of\nworld-lines constitutes a model of the dynamics by checking that the\ndynamics is obeyed in every arbitrarily small region. It is also\ntrivial to generate solutions from arbitrary initial data if there are\nno CTCs: given the initial positions and momenta of a set of\nparticles, one simply draws a straight line from each particle in the\nappropriate direction and continues it indefinitely. Once all the\nlines are drawn, the worldline of each particle can be traced from\ncollision to collision. The boundary value problem for this dynamics\nis obviously well-posed: any set of data at an instant yields a unique\nglobal solution, constructed by the method sketched above.\n\nWhat happens if we change the topology of the space-time by hand to\nproduce CTCs? The simplest way to do this is depicted in\n figure 3:\n we cut and paste the space-time so it is no longer simply connected\nby identifying the line \\(L-\\) with the line \\(L+\\). Particles\n\u201cgoing in\u201d to \\(L+\\) from below \u201cemerge\u201d from\n\\(L-\\) , and particles \u201cgoing in\u201d to \\(L-\\) from below\n\u201cemerge\u201d from \\(L+\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Inserting CTCs by Cut and\nPaste. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHow is the boundary-value problem changed by this alteration in the\nspace-time? Before the cut and paste, we can put arbitrary data on the\nsimultaneity slice \\(S\\) and continue it to a unique solution. After\nthe change in topology, \\(S\\) is no longer a Cauchy surface, since a\nCTC will never intersect it, but it is a partial Cauchy surface. So we\ncan ask two questions. First, can arbitrary data on \\(S\\) always be\ncontinued to a global solution? Second, is that solution unique? If\nthe answer to the first question is \\(no\\), then we have a\nbackward-temporal constraint: the existence of the region with CTCs\nplaces constraints on what can happen on \\(S\\) even though that region\nlies completely to the future of \\(S\\). If the answer to the second\nquestion is \\(no\\), then we have an odd sort of indeterminism,\nanalogous to the unwritten book: the complete physical state on \\(S\\)\ndoes not determine the physical state in the future, even though the\nlocal dynamics is perfectly deterministic and even though there is no\nother past edge to the space-time region in \\(S\\)\u2019s future\n(i.e., there is nowhere else for boundary values to come from\nwhich could influence the state of the region).\n\nIn this case the answer to the first question is yes and to\nthe second is no: there are no constraints on the data which\ncan be put on \\(S\\), but those data are always consistent with an\ninfinitude of different global solutions. The easy way to see that\nthere always is a solution is to construct the minimal solution in the\nfollowing way. Start drawing straight lines from \\(S\\) as required by\nthe initial data. If a line hits \\(L-\\) from the bottom, just continue\nit coming out of the top of \\(L+\\) in the appropriate place, and if a\nline hits \\(L+\\) from the bottom, continue it emerging from \\(L-\\) at\nthe appropriate place.\n Figure 4\n represents the minimal solution for a single particle which enters\nthe time-travel region from the left:\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The Minimal Solution. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe particle \u201ctravels back in time\u201d three times. It is\nobvious that this minimal solution is a global solution, since the\nparticle always travels inertially.\n\nBut the same initial state on \\(S\\) is also consistent with other\nglobal solutions. The new requirement imposed by the topology is just\nthat the data going into \\(L+\\) from the bottom match the data coming\nout of \\(L-\\) from the top, and the data going into \\(L-\\) from the\nbottom match the data coming out of \\(L+\\) from the top. So we can add\nany number of vertical lines connecting \\(L-\\) and \\(L+\\) to a\nsolution and still have a solution. For example, adding a few such\nlines to the minimal solution yields:\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A Non-Minimal Solution. [An\n extended description of figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe particle now collides with itself twice: first before it reaches\n\\(L+\\) for the first time, and again shortly before it exits the CTC\nregion. From the particle\u2019s point of view, it is traveling to\nthe right at a constant speed until it hits an older version of itself\nand comes to rest. It remains at rest until it is hit from the right\nby a younger version of itself, and then continues moving off, and the\nsame process repeats later. It is clear that this is a global model of\nthe dynamics, and that any number of distinct models could be\ngenerating by varying the number and placement of vertical lines.\n\nKnowing the data on \\(S\\), then, gives us only incomplete information\nabout how things will go for the particle. We know that the particle\nwill enter the CTC region, and will reach \\(L+\\), we know that it will\nbe the only particle in the universe, we know exactly where and with\nwhat speed it will exit the CTC region. But we cannot determine how\nmany collisions the particle will undergo (if any), nor how long (in\nproper time) it will stay in the CTC region. If the particle were a\nclock, we could not predict what time it would indicate when exiting\nthe region. Furthermore, the dynamics gives us no handle on what to\nthink of the various possibilities: there are no probabilities\nassigned to the various distinct possible outcomes.\n\nChanging the topology has changed the mathematics of the situation in\ntwo ways, which tend to pull in opposite directions. On the one hand,\n\\(S\\) is no longer a Cauchy surface, so it is perhaps not surprising\nthat data on \\(S\\) do not suffice to fix a unique global solution. But\non the other hand, there is an added constraint: data \u201ccoming\nout\u201d of \\(L-\\) must exactly match data \u201cgoing in\u201d to\n\\(L+\\), even though what comes out of \\(L-\\) helps to determine what\ngoes into \\(L+\\). This added consistency constraint tends to cut down\non solutions, although in this case the additional constraint is more\nthan outweighed by the freedom to consider various sorts of data on\n\\({L+}/{L-}\\).\n\nThe fact that the extra freedom outweighs the extra constraint also\npoints up one unexpected way that the supposed paradoxes of time\ntravel may be overcome. Let\u2019s try to set up a paradoxical\nsituation using the little closed time loop above. If we send a single\nparticle into the loop from the left and do nothing else, we know\nexactly where it will exit the right side of the time travel region.\nNow suppose we station someone at the other side of the region with\nthe following charge: if the particle should come out on the right\nside, the person is to do something to prevent the particle\nfrom going in on the left in the first place. In fact, this is quite\neasy to do: if we send a particle in from the right, it seems that it\ncan exit on the left and deflect the incoming left-hand\nparticle.\n\nCarrying on our reflection in this way, we further realize that if the\nparticle comes out on the right, we might as well send it\nback in order to deflect itself from entering in the first place. So\nall we really need to do is the following: set up a perfectly\nreflecting particle mirror on the right-hand side of the time travel\nregion, and launch the particle from the left so that\u2014if\nnothing interferes with it\u2014it will just barely hit \\(L+\\).\nOur paradox is now apparently complete. If, on the one hand, nothing\ninterferes with the particle it will enter the time-travel region on\nthe left, exit on the right, be reflected from the mirror, re-enter\nfrom the right, and come out on the left to prevent itself from ever\nentering. So if it enters, it gets deflected and never enters. On the\nother hand, if it never enters then nothing goes in on the left, so\nnothing comes out on the right, so nothing is reflected back, and\nthere is nothing to deflect it from entering. So if it doesn\u2019t\nenter, then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters. If it\nenters, then it is deflected and doesn\u2019t enter; if it\ndoesn\u2019t enter then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters:\nparadox complete.\n\nBut at least one solution to the supposed paradox is easy to\nconstruct: just follow the recipe for constructing the minimal\nsolution, continuing the initial trajectory of the particle\n(reflecting it the mirror in the obvious way) and then read of the\nnumber and trajectories of the particles from the resulting diagram.\nWe get the result of\n figure 6:\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Resolving the\n\u201cParadox\u201d. [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs we can see, the particle approaching from the left never reaches\n\\(L+\\): it is deflected first by a particle which emerges from \\(L-\\).\nBut it is not deflected by itself, as the paradox suggests,\nit is deflected by another particle. Indeed, there are now\nfour particles in the diagram: the original particle and\nthree particles which are confined to closed time-like curves. It is\nnot the leftmost particle which is reflected by the mirror, nor even\nthe particle which deflects the leftmost particle; it is another\nparticle altogether.\n\nThe paradox gets it traction from an incorrect presupposition. If\nthere is only one particle in the world at \\(S\\) then there is only\none particle which could participate in an interaction in the time\ntravel region: the single particle would have to interact with its\nearlier (or later) self. But there is no telling what might come out\nof \\(L-\\): the only requirement is that whatever comes out must match\nwhat goes in at \\(L+\\). So if you go to the trouble of constructing a\nworking time machine, you should be prepared for a different kind of\ndisappointment when you attempt to go back and kill yourself: you may\nbe prevented from entering the machine in the first place by some\ncompletely unpredictable entity which emerges from it. And once again\na peculiar sort of indeterminism appears: if there are many\nself-consistent things which could prevent you from entering, there is\nno telling which is even likely to materialize. This is just like the\ncase of the unwritten book: the book is never written, so nothing\ndetermines what fills its pages.\n\nSo when the freedom to put data on \\(L-\\) outweighs the constraint\nthat the same data go into \\(L+\\), instead of paradox we get an\nembarrassment of riches: many solution consistent with the data on\n\\(S\\), or many possible books. To see a case where the constraint\n\u201coutweighs\u201d the freedom, we need to construct a very\nparticular, and frankly artificial, dynamics and topology. Consider\nthe space of all linear dynamics for a scalar field on a lattice. (The\nlattice can be though of as a simple discrete space-time.) We will\ndepict the space-time lattice as a directed graph. There is to be a\nscalar field defined at every node of the graph, whose value at a\ngiven node depends linearly on the values of the field at nodes which\nhave arrows which lead to it. Each edge of the graph can be assigned a\nweighting factor which determines how much the field at the input node\ncontributes to the field at the output node. If we name the nodes by\nthe letters a, b, c, etc., and the edges by\ntheir endpoints in the obvious way, then we can label the weighting\nfactors by the edges they are associated with in an equally obvious\nway.\n\nSuppose that the graph of the space-time lattice is acyclic,\nas in\n figure 7.\n (A graph is Acyclic if one can not travel in the direction\nof the arrows and go in a loop.)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: An Acyclic Lattice. [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIt is easy to regard a set of nodes as the analog of a Cauchy surface,\ne.g., the set \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\), and it is obvious if arbitrary data are\nput on those nodes the data will generate a unique solution in the\n future.[3]\n If the value of the field at node \\(a\\) is 3 and at node \\(b\\) is 7,\nthen its value at node \\(d\\) will be \\(3W_{ad}\\) and its value at node\n\\(e\\) will be \\(3W_{ae} + 7W_{be}\\). By varying the weighting factors\nwe can adjust the dynamics, but in an acyclic graph the future\nevolution of the field will always be unique.\n\nLet us now again artificially alter the topology of the lattice to\nadmit CTCs, so that the graph now is cyclic. One of the simplest such\ngraphs is depicted in\n figure 8:\n there are now paths which lead from \\(z\\) back to itself, e.g., \\(z\\)\nto \\(y\\) to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Time Travel on a Lattice. [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nCan we now put arbitrary data on \\(v\\) and \\(w\\), and continue that\ndata to a global solution? Will the solution be unique?\n\nIn the generic case, there will be a solution and the solution will be\nunique. The equations for the value of the field at \\(x, y\\), and\n\\(z\\) are: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nx &= vW_{vx} + zW_{zx} \\\\\n y &= wW_{wy} + zW_{zy} \\\\\n z &= xW_{xz} + yW_{yz}. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSolving these equations for \\(z\\) yields \n\\[ z = (vW_{vx} + zW_{zx})W_{xz} + (wW_{wy} + zW_{zy})W_{yz}, \\]\n\n\nor \n\\[ z = \\frac{(vW_{vx}W_{xz} + wW_{wy}W_{yz})} {(1 - W_{zx}W_{xz} - W_{zy}W_{yz})}, \\]\n\n\nwhich gives a unique value for \\(z\\) in the generic case. But looking\nat the space of all possible dynamics for this lattice (i.e., the\nspace of all possible weighting factors), we find a singularity in the\ncase where \\(1-W_{zx}W_{xz} - W_{zy}W_{yz} = 0\\). If we choose\nweighting factors in just this way, then arbitrary data at \\(v\\) and\n\\(w\\) cannot be continued to a global solution. Indeed, if the scalar\nfield is everywhere non-negative, then this particular choice of\ndynamics puts ironclad constraints on the value of the field at \\(v\\)\nand \\(w\\): the field there must be zero (assuming \\(W_{vx}\\) and\n\\(W_{wy}\\) to be non-zero), and similarly all nodes in their past must\nhave field value zero. If the field can take negative values, then the\nvalues at \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) must be so chosen that \\(vW_{vx}W_{xz} =\n-wW_{wy}W_{yz}\\). In either case, the field values at \\(v\\) and \\(w\\)\nare severely constrained by the existence of the CTC region even\nthough these nodes lie completely to the past of that region. It is\nthis sort of constraint which we find to be unlike anything which\nappears in standard physics.\n\nOur toy models suggest three things. The first is that it may be\nimpossible to prove in complete generality that arbitrary data on a\npartial Cauchy surface can always be continued to a global\nsolution: our artificial case provides an example where it cannot. The\nsecond is that such odd constraints are not likely to be generic: we\nhad to delicately fine-tune the dynamics to get a problem. The third\nis that the opposite problem, namely data on a partial Cauchy surface\nbeing consistent with many different global solutions, is\nlikely to be generic: we did not have to do any fine-tuning to get\nthis result.\n\nThis third point leads to a peculiar sort of indeterminism,\nillustrated by the case of the unwritten book: the entire state on\n\\(S\\) does not determine what will happen in the future even though\nthe local dynamics is deterministic and there are no other\n\u201cedges\u201d to space-time from which data could influence the\nresult. What happens in the time travel region is constrained but not\ndetermined by what happens on \\(S\\), and the dynamics does not even\nsupply any probabilities for the various possibilities. The\nexample of the photographic negative discussed in section 2, then,\nseems likely to be unusual, for in that case there is a\nunique fixed point for the dynamics, and the set-up plus the\ndynamical laws determine the outcome. In the generic case one\nwould rather expect multiple fixed points, with no room for\nanything to influence, even probabilistically, which would be\nrealized. (See the supplement on\n\nRemarks and Limitations on the Toy Models.\n\nIt is ironic that time travel should lead generically not to\ncontradictions or to constraints (in the normal region) but to\nunderdetermination of what happens in the time travel region\nby what happens everywhere else (an underdetermination tied neither to\na probabilistic dynamics nor to a free edge to space-time). The\ntraditional objection to time travel is that it leads to\ncontradictions: there is no consistent way to complete an arbitrarily\nconstructed story about how the time traveler intends to act. Instead,\nthough, it appears that the more significant problem is\nunderdetermination: the story can be consistently completed in many\ndifferent ways.\n",
