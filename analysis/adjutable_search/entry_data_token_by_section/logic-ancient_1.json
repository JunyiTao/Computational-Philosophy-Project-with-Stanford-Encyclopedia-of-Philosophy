    "main_text": "Pre-Aristotelian Logic || Argument Patterns and Valid Inference\n1.2 Argument Patterns and Valid Inference\n\n\nPre-Aristotelian evidence for reflection on argument forms and valid\ninference are harder to come by. Both Zeno of Elea (born c. 490 BCE)\nand Socrates (470\u2013399) were famous for the ways in which they\nrefuted an opponent\u2019s view. Their methods display similarities with\nreductio ad absurdum, but neither of them seems to have\ntheorized about their logical procedures. Zeno produced arguments\n(logoi) that manifest variations of the pattern \u2018this\n(i.e. the opponent\u2019s view) only if that. But that is impossible. So\nthis is impossible\u2019. Socratic refutation was an exchange of\nquestions and answers in which the opponents would be led, on the\nbasis of their answers, to a conclusion incompatible with their\noriginal claim. Plato institutionalized such disputations into\nstructured, rule-governed verbal contests that became known as\ndialectical argument. The development of a basic logical vocabulary\nfor such contests indicates some reflection upon the patterns of\nargumentation.\n\n\nThe 5th and early to mid-4th centuries BCE also\nsee great interest in fallacies and logical paradoxes. Besides the\nLiar, Eubulides is said to have been the originator of several other\nlogical paradoxes, including the Sorites. Plato\u2019s Euthydemus\ncontains a large collection of contemporary fallacies. In attempts to\nsolve such logical puzzles, a logical terminology develops here, too,\nand the focus on the difference between valid and invalid arguments\nsets the scene for the search for a criterion of valid\ninference. Finally, it is possible that the shaping of deduction and\nproof in Greek mathematics that begins in the later 5th\ncentury BCE served as an inspiration for Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic.\n",
