    "main_text": "Speaker-Meaning and Force || Force as an Aspect of Speaker Meaning\n5.3 Force as an Aspect of Speaker Meaning\n\n\nHow does this detour through speaker meaning help to elucidate the\nnotion of force? One way of asserting that P, it seems, is\novertly to manifest my commitment to P, and indeed commitment\nof a particular kind: commitment to defend P in response to\nchallenges of the form, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I must\nalso overtly manifest my liability to be either right or wrong on the\nissue of P depending on whether P is the case. By\ncontrast, I conjecture P by overtly manifesting my commitment\nto P in this same \u201cliability to error\u201d way, but I\nam not committed to responding to challenges demanding full\njustification. I must, however, give some reason for\nbelieving P; this much cannot, however, be said of a\nguess.\n\n\nWe perform a speech act, then, when we overtly commit ourselves in a\ncertain way to a content\u2014where that way is an aspect of how we\nspeaker-mean that content. One way to do that is to invoke a\nconvention for undertaking commitment; another way is overtly to\nmanifest one\u2019s intention to be so committed. We may elucidate the\nrelevant forms of commitment by spelling out the norms underlying\nthem. We have already adumbrated such an approach in our discussion of\nthe differences among asserting and conjecturing. Developing that\ndiscussion a bit further, compare\n\n\nasserting\nconjecturing\nguessing\n\n\n\nAll three of these acts have word-to-world direction of fit, and all\nthree have conditions of satisfaction mandating that they are\nsatisfied just in case the world is as their content says it\nis. Further, one who asserts, conjectures, or guesses that P\nis right or wrong on the issue of P depending on\nwhether P is in fact so. However, as we move down the list we\nfind a decreasing order of stringency in commitment. One who\nasserts P lays herself open to the challenge, \u201cHow do\nyou know that?\u201d, and she is obliged to retract P if she\nis unable to respond to that challenge adequately. By contrast, this\nchallenge is inappropriate for either a conjecture or a guess. On the\nother hand, we may justifiably demand of the conjecturer that she give\nsome reason for her conjecture; yet not even this much may be said of\none who makes a guess. (The \u201ceducated guess\u201d is\nintermediate between these two cases.)\n\n\nThis illocutionary dimension of speaker meaning\ncharacterizes not what is meant, but rather how it is meant. Just as\nwe may consider your remark, directed toward me, \u201cYou\u2019re\ntired,\u201d and my remark, \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d as having said\nthe same thing but in different ways; so too we may consider my\nassertion of P, followed by a retraction and then followed by\na conjecture of P, as two consecutive cases in which I\nspeaker-mean that P but do so in different ways. This idea\nwill be developed further in Section 8 under the rubric of\n\u201cmode\u201d of illocutionary\ncommitment.[16]\n\n\n\nSpeaker meaning, then, encompasses not just content but also force,\nand we may elucidate this in light of the normative structure\ncharacteristic of each speech act: When you overtly display a\ncommitment characteristic of that speech act, you have performed that\nspeech act. Is this a necessary condition as well? That depends on\nwhether I can perform a speech act without intending to do so\u2014a\ntopic for Section 9 below. For now, however, compare the view at which\nwe have arrived with Searle\u2019s view that one performs a speech act when\nothers become aware of one\u2019s intention to perform that act. What is\nmissing from Searle\u2019s characterization is the notion of overtness: The\nagent in question must not only make her intention to undertake a\ncertain commitment manifest; she must also intend that that very\nintention be manifest. There is more to overtness than wearing one\u2019s\nheart (or mind) on one\u2019s sleeve.\n",
