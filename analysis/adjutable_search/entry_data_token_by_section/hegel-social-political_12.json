    "main_text": "Law\n9. Law\n\nPart of Hegel\u2019s examination of civil society concerns law and\nthe administration of justice. Hegel\u2019s theory of law has been\nnotoriously difficult to characterize. This is likely, in part, because\nHegel uses common terms in an uncommon ways.\n\nHegel clearly accepts a strong link between morality and law\nsuggesting he endorses some variety of natural law. Like other natural\nlawyers, Hegel claims \u201cwhat is law [Gesetz] may differ\nin content from what is right in itself\u201d (PR \u00a7212).\nSomething can be lawful yet unjust \u2013 and this having a higher\nstandard of justice by which he can assess posited law is a common\nfeature of natural law jurisprudence.\n\nBut what is different is that, traditionally, natural lawyers have\ndeveloped their understanding of the standard of moral justice to be\napplied to an assessment of law prior to that assessment. For example,\nthe moral standard would be worked out first and then applied\nafterwards. This leads some critics of natural law to claim that this\napproach uses extralegal standards and reasoning to assess law and so\nreally engaging in moral philosophy rather than legal thought.\n\nHegel\u2019s perspective is unique (Brudner 2017). He accepts the\npositivist view that our understanding of law must be centred on the\nlaw itself rather than extralegal considerations. He says \u201cwhat\nis legal [gesetzm\u0101\u00dfig] is \u2026 the\nsource of cognition of what is right [Recht], or more\nprecisely, of what is lawful [Rechtens]\u201d\n(PR \u00a7212 Remark). So we start first from a close look at\nthe law before us \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 and not develop some\nnormative standard separately beforehand. For Hegel, we do not\ncomprehend this standard separately from the law, but immanently within\nit.\n\nHe says: \u201cthe scope of the law [Gesetz] ought on the\none hand to be that of a complete and self-contained whole, but on the\nother hand, there is a constant need for new legal determinations\n[gesetzlicher Bestimmungen]\u201d (PR\n\u00a7216). Hegel is claiming the law aspires to be a complete whole\nand, where we find gaps or inconsistencies, our task is to work out how\nthese can be addressed within the law as a self-contained whole in\nlanguage echoing Ronald Dworkin\u2019s (1977) use of legal principles\na century later. Thus, Hegel looks to the law for the ethical\nprinciples that can be used to continually reform our legal system into\nthe complete whole it aspires to be. This\n\u201cnatural law internalism\u201d discerns its principles from\nwithin the law rather than from outside it (Brooks 2017b).\n\nThe development of law is crucially not a project for professionals\nalone. Hegel makes a powerful case for the right to trial by jury\n(PR \u00a7228 Remark). His argument is that\nwithout a jury of ordinary citizens there is no guarantee that a\ncitizen would have a reasonable chance of understanding the charges,\nevidence and outcome, especially if convicted and punished. This is\nbecause the law is a technical language which risks becoming the\nexclusive property of a professional class. The best guarantee of\nlaw\u2019s publicity and connection to a public view of right is to\nensure a jury is convinced \u2013 if they can understand the trial and\ncome to a view, then Hegel finds it reasonable to expect the defendant\non trial can, too.\n\nIt is here that Hegel revisits the justification of punishment. We\nnow consider crime and punishment not in abstraction, but their\nconcrete reality. Hegel begins by noting that the \u201coutward\nexistence\u201d of a crime and its impact may not change the nature of\na crime in its concept, but it does impact how we respond. This\nsuggests that the same kind of crime can be punished more or less\nseverely based, at least in part, on the circumstances. Such a view is\nstarkly at odds with most retributivists where punishment should only\nbe considered in relation to what an offender deserved on account of\nhis moral responsibility for an offence.\n\nHegel makes clear that a crime\u2019s \u201cdanger to civil\nsociety is a determination of its magnitude\u201d where circumstances\nimpact in how we determine whether to punish, how much to punish and\nwhat form this might take. He notes \u201ca penal code is therefore\nprimarily a product of its time and of the current condition of civil\nsociety\u201d (PR \u00a7218 Remark). He adds that\n\u201cpunishments are not unjust in and for themselves, but are\nproportionate to the conditions of their time\u201d (PR\n\u00a7218 Addition). So the same crime committed in different\ncircumstances would be punished differently. For example, a crime\ncommitted during civil war poses a greater threat to civil society than\nwhen at peace \u2013 and so the former would see the crimes punished\nmore harshly. There is no difference in the offender or her\nresponsibility. While desert matters, it is not the only factor which\ndoes.\n\nThese comments make clear a non-retributivist picture. This is\nconsistent with a passage in his Science of Logic\n(SL), the text Hegel claims is presupposed as the foundation\nfor the PR:\n\nPunishment, for example, has various determinations: it is\nretributive, a deterrent example as well, a threat used by the law as a\ndeterrent, and also it brings the criminal to his senses and reforms\nhim. Each of these different determinations has been considered the\nground of punishment, because each is an essential\ndetermination, and therefore the others, as distinct from it, are\ndetermined as merely contingent relatively to it. But the one which\nis taken as ground is still not the whole punishment itself\n(SL, p. 465)\n\nHegel\u2019s argument is clearer here. Desert grounds punishment:\nonly the deserving can be liable to be punished. But it does not have a\nmonopoly on the amount or form that punishment can take. This picture\nis consistent with Hegel\u2019s comments in the PR where the\noutward existence of punishment may be different depending on\ncircumstances. It should be unsurprising to find that Hegel, who\nrepeatedly defends various groupings of three in his work would seek to\ncombine retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation in a new format\n\u2013 taking common concepts in uncommon ways. This was not lost on\nhis earliest interpreters in the UK, as British Idealists like Green,\nBradley and others held similar three-in-one views on punishment and\nrejected traditional accounts of retributivism (Brooks 2003,\n2011). This view has been called the \u201cunified theory of\npunishment\u201d (Brooks 2017a).\n",
