Grammatica Speculativa and its critics\n\n\nThe idea, fundamental both for Bacon and Ps.-Kilwardby, that grammar\nis a regular science rather than a propaedeutic art, is shared by the\nschool of the so-called \u201cmodist grammarians\u201d\n(modistae) emerging around 1270 in the Faculty of Arts of the\nUniversity of Paris and culminating in the Grammatica\nSpeculativa of Thomas of Erfurt around 1300. The members of this\nschool, taking it for granted that the objective of any regular science\nwas to explain the facts by giving reasons for them rather than to\nsimply describe them, make it their business to deduce the grammatical\nfeatures common to all languages from universal modes of being by means\nof corresponding modes of understanding. Thus the tradition of\nspeculative grammar (grammatica speculativa) develops the\ncommonly accepted Aristotelian claim (De Interpretatione\n1.16a3\u20139) that the mental concepts, just as the things, are the same\nfor all men (eadem apud omnes) further to the thesis of a\nuniversal grammar based on the structural analogy between the\n\u201cmodes of being\u201d (modi essendi), the \u201cmodes\nof understanding\u201d (modi intelligendi), and the\n\u201cmodes of signifying\u201d (modi significandi) that are\nthe same for all languages. Along this line, Boethius Dacus (Boethius\nthe Dane), one of the most important theoreticians of speculative\ngrammar,[36]\n states that\n\u2026 all national languages are grammatically\nidentical. The reason for this is that the whole grammar is borrowed\nfrom the things \u2026 and just as the natures of things are similar\nfor those who speak different languages, so are the modes of being and\nthe modes of understanding; and consequently the modes of signifying\nare similar, whence, so are the modes of grammatical construction or\nspeech. And therefore the whole grammar which is in one language is\nsimilar to the one which is in another\n language.[37]\n\n\nEven though the words are arbitrarily imposed (whence arise the\ndifferences between all languages), the modes of signifying are\nuniformly related to the modes of being by means of the modes of\nunderstanding (whence arise the grammatical similarities among all\nlanguages). Focusing on the terms of \u2018sign\u2019 and\n\u2018signification\u2019, speculative grammar, as a science of\ngeneral cognitive-linguistic structures, prescinds from all the\ndifferent national languages \u2014 and even from vocal language as\nsuch. For it is, as Martinus Dacus points out, not essential for\nspeculative grammar to deal with vocal expressions or with structures\nof vocal sign systems, because any kind of signs could be the object of\nthe considerations of a modist grammarian. The fact that he is\nconcerned with linguistic signs rather than with gestures or the\n\u201clanguage of eyes\u201d is only due to the fact that vocal\nexpressions are, compared to other kind of signs, more apt for human\ncommunication.[38]\n\n\nSoon after 1300 the modistic approach came under substantial\ncriticism. The main point that critics like Ockham oppose is not the\nassumption of a basic universal grammar, for such a claim is implied in\nOckham's concept of mental grammar, too. Two other aspects of modism\nare in the focus of these criticisms: (1) the assertion of a close\nstructural analogy between spoken or mental language and external\nreality (consimilis distinctio inter voces vel intentiones in anima\nsignificantes et inter ipsa significata) (William of Ockham,\nExpos. in lIbid. Porphyrii de praed., 1978, 158); (2) the\ninadmissible reification of the modus significandi adherent to\nits description as some quality or form added to the articulate voice\n(dictioni superadditum) through the act of imposition. To say\nthat vocal expressions \u2018have\u2019 different modes of signifying\nis, as Ockham points out, just a metaphorical manner of speaking; for\nwhat is meant is simply the fact that different words signify whatever\nthey signify in different\n ways.[39]\n According to John\nAurifaber (fl. ca. 1300), a vocal term is significative, or is a sign,\nsolely by being used significatively, not on grounds of something\ninherent in the\n sound.[40]\n In order to assign signification a proper\nplace in reality, it must be ascribed to the intellect rather than to\nthe vocal sound (significare est accidens intellectus; sed vox est\nillud quo significat intellectus) (Aurifaber, Determ. de modis\nsignif., 1967, 226). The criticism of modist grammar is based on a\nfundamental redefinition of the concept of sign, coming about after the\nmid-13th century. For the translocation of signification in\nthe proper sense from the word to the intellect is based on the\npresupposition that, whatever Augustine may have said, mental concepts\nare signs themselves.\n",
