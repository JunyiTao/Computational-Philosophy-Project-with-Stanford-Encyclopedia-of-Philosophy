    "main_text": "Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain || Dividing Pleasure or Finding True Pleasure?\n4. Conclusion: Looking Inward, Looking Forward\n\nPerhaps there is only one true pleasure of blissful freedom from\nstress, present in all apparently diverse pleasures, including those\nof the hot bath, sexual consummation, youthful friendship, and freedom\nfrom responsibility for children which figured in the short Afghan\nlist of \u00a72.1\u00a0\u2013 and its impure mixtures with frights\nand with the burning pains of hot spice are only due to ways it can be\ncaused due to our biology and past conditioning. Or perhaps there will\nbe much more intrinsic, and not merely causally relational, diversity.\nHow we and our hedonic experience are situated or constituted in our\nbrains and organisms remains to be seen. And bringing normative wisdom\nto bear on emerging physiology will presumably be called for,\nat least to the extent that the concept of pleasure, at least in its primary use by\nnaive experiencers (who seem to fix the reference of the term in part through\npleasure presenting as good to them), is an evaluative and\nnormative one, however legitimately this may bracketed by scientists\nand philosophers when theorizing about it. (Cf. Sidgwick 1907, 129, on\nthe Stoics taking this appearance to be an always deceptive one, and\nnot only, perhaps like Plato [Moss 2006] and Aristotle [Moss 2012], as\nan occasionally corrigible one.)\n\nIn doing so we may aim to capture much in earlier views while keeping\nin mind that pleasure is something biological, psychological, and\nexperiential which remains in large part unknown, the nature or\ncategory of which it is inappropriate to stipulate a priori. Perhaps\npleasure expresses the unimpeded functioning (Aristotle) of our\nNatural anxiety-free and pain-free State (Epicurus) by which we are\nable to reach outward from our hedonic core to engage with more\nrepresentational brain processes\u00a0\u2013 and through these, with\nlove, to all the world (citations in n. 25). But perhaps pleasure has\na more complex reflexive intentional structure, as suggested in some\nof the medieval literature mentioned in \u00a72.3.1 and\nn.\u00a020\u00a0 ad loc., and understanding the\nself-organization of recurrent neural activity will someday help us to\nintrospect this better. Elements at least of these suggestions and\nothers are compatible. Or perhaps pleasure divides in two, perhaps\nalong the lines between the \u2018wanting\u2019 and\n\u2018liking\u2019 discussed in the preceding section, no one\nnatural kind responding to all we intuitively seek, with dopaminergic\nreward needed to organize our exploratory pleasures of pursuit until\nwe are ready for opioid bliss and repose. But we should also not\nforget more humble and basic biological facts: that mood varies with\nenergy and thus with circadian rhythms affecting body temperature and\nalso with the current availability of nutrients in the blood (Thayer\n1989, 1996); that how much pleasure we experience also depends on\ngetting enough, and good enough, sleep; that pleasure increases immune\nresponse (Rosenkranz et al, 2003), and that how we feel may\ngrow in part out of monitoring bodily homeostasis (Craig 2002, 2009,\n2015). These facts are telling about what may, perhaps, turn out to be\nmore a syndrome of typically causally connected features than a simple\nor unified psychobiological phenomenon, such as would better fit\nphilosophers\u2019 penchant for simple kinds and simple\nexplanations.\n\nThe prospects seem good for new and deep scientific understanding of\npleasure and of how it is organized in the brain. We may have much\nto gain from the practical results of this new\nunderstanding\u00a0\u2013 especially if, as Voznesensky says,\n\nThe main thing in living is human feeling: Are you happy? just fine?\nor\n sad?[33]\n\n\nBut pleasure should also be of special interest even to philosophers\nof mind not especially interested in value or affect, in part for the\nstrong challenge that apparently contentless moods pose to\nrepresentational accounts of mind. Deeply subjective or phenomenal\naspects of our experience, that may more easily be ignored elsewhere\nin the philosophy of mind, seem to stare us in the face here, where\nwhat is at issue centrally seems no informational content or broad\nfunctional role but simply \u201cwhether you\u2019re happy or sad\u201d.\nHowever, appearances of bare intrinsic fact and simple pictures taken\nfor firm foundations have often proved misleading in the studies of\nmind. As the sciences of mind and brain mature, they will offer new\nevidence about pleasure and its roles in our and kindred minds and\nabout whether and how these roles may pull apart, perhaps making\npleasure more than one natural kind. Real answers to major questions\nabout the unity, diversity, and nature of pleasure and its relations\nto pain, motivation, awareness, and value must likely await further\nresults of this new science and their scientifically informed and\nphilosophically sensitive interpretation.\n",
