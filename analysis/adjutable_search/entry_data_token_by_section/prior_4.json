    "main_text": "Work on Modal Logic || The Craft of Formal Logic\n2.1 The Craft of Formal Logic\n\n\nPrior\u2019s entry into modal logic was bound up with his passion for\nancient and early logic. His first essay on the subject, the\npenultimate chapter\u2014\u2018Modality\u2019\u2014of his\nill-fated manuscript The Craft of Formal Logic, is largely\nhistorical in nature, with discussions of Aristotle, Peter of Spain,\nJohn Wallis, the Port Royal Logic, Isaac Watts\u2019\nLogick, Whately, Aldrich, de Morgan, and Hume and Mill on\nnatural necessity. To judge by his references in The Craft,\nhis first encounters with modern symbolic modal logic must have been\nthe pioneering explorations by Lewis in his and Langford\u2019s\nSymbolic Logic, Bochenski\u2019s chapter \u2018La Logique\nde la Modalit\u00e9\u2019 in his La Logique de\nTh\u00e9ophraste, and Feys\u2019 article \u2018Les\nSyst\u00e8mes Formalis\u00e9s des Modalit\u00e9s\nAristot\u00e9liciennes\u2019 (Lewis and Langford 1932, Bochenski\n1947, Feys 1950). Other important early influences were von\nWright\u2019s \u2018Deontic Logic\u2019 and An Essay in Modal\nLogic, both published in 1951. Probably through Bochenski\u2019s\nwritings, Prior had discovered \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work in\nsymbolic modal logic by the time of \u2018In What Sense is Modal\nLogic Many-Valued?\u2019. In that paper Prior focussed on\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s \u2018On Variable Functors of Propositional\nArguments\u2019 (\u0141ukasiewicz 1951b), which he described in a\n1952 review of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s symbolic logic as \u2018quite\nthe most exciting contribution that has been made to symbolic logic in\nEnglish for a very long time\u2019. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work on\nmodality was a major influence on Prior, who wrote in the Preface to\nTime and Modality: \u2018[W]hile I differed radically from\nthe late Professor \u0141ukasiewicz on the subject of modal logic, my\ndebt to him will be obvious on almost every page\u2019.)\nOne of Prior\u2019s conclusions in \u2018Modality\u2019,\nsignificant for his later work, is that \u2018[t]here is everything to\nbe said \u2026 for the \u2026 view that we may not only use devices\ndeveloped in the study of quantity to throw light on modality, but also\nvice versa\u2019 (1951: 747). One of the most distinctive\nfeatures of his mature philosophy was the view that quantification over\npossible worlds and instants is to be interpreted in terms of modality\nand tense, which constitute primitive notions\u2014a view he held in\ntandem with the belief that the study of such quantifications could\nusefully illuminate the study of modality and tense (as in his own\n\\(U\\)-calculi, described below).\n\n\nPrior arrived at another important insight in the penultimate\nchapter of The Craft. Early in 1951 he read von Wright\u2019s\narticle \u2018Deontic Logic\u2019 and in \u2018Modality\u2019 he gave a\ncameo discussion of this area. His reading of von Wright reinforced in\nhis mind an idea that he had come across in Peter of Spain, Isaac\nWatts, and the Port Royal Logic, an idea that was to be of\nconsiderable significance for his own future work. What von Wright\ncalled the \u2018alethic\u2019 modes\u2014necessity, possibility,\nimpossibility and contingency\u2014are members of an extended group of\nconcepts that includes the epistemic modes (\u2018it is known\nthat\u2019, \u2018it is not known to be false that\u2019, etc.), the\ndoxastic modes (such as \u2018it is believed that\u2019), and the\ndeontic modes (which include \u2018it is permitted that\u2019 and\n\u2018it is obligatory that\u2019). In The Craft Prior also\nlisted Watts\u2019 \u2018it is written that\u2019 and \u2018it is\nsaid that\u2019, noting that \u2018one could think of innumerable\nothers\u2019 (1951: 749). Later, von Wright was to draw attention to\nwhat may be called the agentive modes: \u2018the agent brings it about\nthat\u2019, \u2018the agent makes it true that\u2019, and the like\n(von Wright 1963).\n\n\nPrior introduced the collective term \u2018quasi-modals\u2019 for\nthe non-alethic modes (1951: 749) and remarked, accurately, that\n\u2018there is a hint of a large field here\u2019 (1951: 752). He was\nlater to refer to his own tense operators as quasi-modal operators\n(1968: 138). By the time he wrote Formal Logic he was\nadvocating the study of \u2018the general modal form \u201cIt is\n\u2014 that \\(p\\)\u201d \u2026 as a distinct propositional\nform\u2019, observing that \u2018this field has not been much\ncultivated\u2019 (1955a: 218).\n",
