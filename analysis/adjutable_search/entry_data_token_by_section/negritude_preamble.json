Who\nare we? What are we in this white world?\u201d And he commented:\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a problem\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2005, 23).\n\u201cWho am I?\u201d is a question Descartes posed, and a reader of\nthe French philosopher naturally understands such a question to be\nuniversal, and the subject who says \u201cI\u201d here to stand for\nany human being. But when \u201cwho am I?\u201d has to be translated\nas \u201cwho are we?\u201d everything changes especially\nwhen the \u201cwe\u201d have to define themselves against a world\nwhich leaves no room for who and what they are because they are black\nfolks in a world where \u201cuniversal\u201d seems to naturally mean\n\u201cwhite\u201d.\n\n\u201cN\u00e9gritude\u201d, or the self-affirmation of black\npeoples, or the affirmation of the values of civilization of something\ndefined as \u201cthe black world\u201d as an answer to the question\n\u201cwhat are we in this white world?\u201d is indeed \u201cquite\na problem\u201d: it poses many questions that will be examined here\nthrough the following headings:\n",
