    "main_text": "Beyond PAP || Incompatibilism without PAP\n5.2 Incompatibilism without PAP\n\nIn spite of compatibilist theories developed in the wake of FSCs, some\nphilosophers have remained convinced that even if PAP is false,\ndeterminism precludes responsibility. A compatibilist will challenge\nsuch philosophers to explain why this is so, if not because\ndeterminism blocks all alternatives.\n\nOne response to this challenge was in the previous section. Another\nmodifies the Consequence Argument so that it doesn\u2019t rely on\nPAP. This is the \u201cDirect Argument\u201d, direct\nbecause it doesn\u2019t go through PAP. It can be reconstructed along\nthe following lines (a formal version is in van Inwagen 1980):\n\nP1.\n If determinism is true, then Kurt\u2019s stealing John\u2019s\nlunch is an inevitable consequence of factors (namely, the distant\npast and laws) for which Kurt is not morally responsible.\nP2. \n If a person is not morally responsible for X, and Y\nis an inevitable consequence of X, then that person is not\nmorally responsible for Y.\nC. \n Therefore, if determinism is true, then Kurt is not morally\nresponsible for stealing John\u2019s lunch.\n\n\nThe first premise P1 follows from the definition of determinism as\nwell as some auxiliary claims about moral responsibility. P2 is the\n\u201ctransfer of blamelessness\u201d; whatever else might be said\nabout this premise, it does not require PAP. And the conclusion, which\ncan be generalized, follows from P1 and P2. But while this argument\ndoes not appeal to PAP, it appears that FSCs can be used against P2,\nthe transfer of blamelessness. The presence of Black, for which we can\nhardly blame Jones, makes the choice to vote Republican inevitable,\nbut Jones is for all that morally responsible for so-choosing (see\nFischer\u2019s introduction to his 1986; Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\nch. 6; and for more discussion, Stump 2000; McKenna 2008).\n\nA related answer to the compatibilist challenge is from the\n\u201csource incompatibilist\u201d or \u201ccausal history\nincompatibilist\u201d (Stump 1990; Klein 1990; Pereboom 1995, 2001;\nZagzebski 2000). Under determinism, you are not the source\u2014at\nleast not the ultimate source\u00ad\u2014of your actions.\nRather, the sources of your actions are found in the distant past.\nThis point seems to undermine your responsibility, at least one\ndesirable form of it (Mele 1996). Whatever the merits of source\nincompatibilism, it addresses the compatibilist challenge, for it says\nwhy determinism threatens moral responsibility\u2014namely, by ruling\nout sourcehood\u2014but without appealing to its blocking of\nalternatives, and thus without PAP. In this way, FSCs shift the\ndispute away from alternatives to the nature and importance of\nsourcehood. (Some source incompatibilists accept PAP or a closely\nrelated principle\u2014see, e.g., Kane 1996; Timpe 2013: ch.\n9\u2014but we are for now assuming PAP is false.)\n",
