Individual Responsibility and Health Behaviors\n\nIn\n section 5,\n we identified three groups of possible causal pathways between social\ndeterminants and health outcomes: childhood environment, material\nliving conditions, and social and psychological factors. A central\ncontributing factor to poor health outcomes, however, has an ambiguous\nrelation to social determinants. There is strong evidence that\nhealth behaviors, including smoking, excessive alcohol\nconsumption, poor nutrition, and lack of physical exercise are key\ncontributors to morbidity and mortality (Petrovic et al. 2018). Some\nfind, moreover, that health behaviors explain much of the social\nhealth gradient in high-income countries, since harmful health\nbehaviors are more prevalent in groups with lower socioeconomic status\n(Petrovic et al. 2018). For example, Silvia Stringhini, Sabia, et al.\n(2010) argue that when superior measures of health behaviors are\nemployed, much of the health gradient identified in the Whitehall II\nstudy can be explained by a social gradient in harmful health\nbehaviors (though Stringhini, Dugravot, et al. [2011] did not\nreplicate this finding in a study of employees of the French national\ngas and electric company, suggesting that whether health behaviors\ncontribute to the social gradient may depend on social context).\n\nWhen harmful health behaviors are more prevalent among people with\nlower socioeconomic status, one might argue that the consequent health\ninequalities are simply the result of social factors over which one\nhas no control\u2014i.e., as akin to one\u2019s childhood\nenvironment. This is too quick, however, for people\ndecide\u2014at least in some sense\u2014to smoke, to drink\nalcohol excessively, or to eat a poor diet, and such decisions may not\nalways be determined by social factors\u2014e.g., material\nconstraints on access to healthy food. This matters for evaluations of\njustice, since, as we saw above, some argue that health inequalities\nare not unjust if they are the result of voluntary choices. If\ndecisions to engage in harmful health behaviors meet the appropriate\nthreshold of voluntariness, therefore, one may plausibly argue that\nthere is nothing unjust about that portion of the social gradient in\nhealth that is due to them.\n\nThe question of individual responsibility is also relevant for a\nnumber of areas of health policy. If individuals are responsible for\nthe downstream consequences of their harmful health behaviors,\npolicymakers may be justified in withholding care or assigning such\npatients lesser priority in the allocation of scarce resources (see\nVoigt 2013). Policymakers may also be justified in designing public\nhealth strategies that encourage people to make better choices\nregarding diet and physical exercise as opposed to addressing the\nstructural circumstances within which people make choices.\n\nTo begin, luck egalitarians would seem to be committed to the view\nthat health inequalities due to voluntarily chosen health behaviors\nare not unjust. While luck egalitarians hold it is unjust for one\nperson to be worse off than another because of brute luck,\ninequalities due to option luck\u2014i.e., factors within a\nperson\u2019s control\u2014are just. Applied to health and health\ncare, luck egalitarianism would seem to imply that people should be\ncompensated for inequalities in health due to brute luck\u2014e.g.,\ngenetic factors and the social determinants of health\u2014but held\nresponsible for health outcomes due to option luck\u2014e.g.,\nvoluntary decisions to drink excessively or eat a poor diet (see,\ne.g., Le Grand 1987, Segall 2010, and Cavallero 2011).\n\nFor example, if someone has a treatable case of lung cancer, we might\nordinarily reasonably presume that it would be unjust to deny him\nmedical care. However, if his cancer is due to a heavy, life-long\nsmoking habit, the question arises of whether the ordinary presumption\nis defeated or diminished in strength. For instance, if there is a\nchoice to be made (say, because of resource scarcity) between treating\nhim and treating another lung cancer patient who is in no way\nresponsible for her lung cancer, does justice require preferring the\nsecond patient? A simple application of luck egalitarianism would hold\nthat it is just to deny treatment to the smoker, as long as his\n\u201cdecision to smoke\u201d qualifies as a \u201cvoluntary\nchoice\u201d according to some suitable criteria.\n\nMany find this implication of luck egalitarianism to be objectionable,\nwith Elizabeth Anderson (1999: 296) calling it \u201cthe problem of\nabandonment of negligent victims\u201d. Some luck\negalitarians respond that their view, properly understood, is not\ncommitted to this implication. For example, Alexander Cappelen and Ole\nNorheim (2005) and Julian Le Grand (2013) suggest that differences in\noption luck\u2014i.e., differences in how the voluntary choices of\npeople play out\u2014are themselves unjust, and so policies should be\nimplemented to ensure that the lucky help the unlucky, such as taxes\non cigarettes with the revenues used to provide care to smokers who\ndevelop lung cancer. Eric Cavallero (2011: 393\u2013396) takes a\nstronger line, arguing that luck egalitarianism provides no support\nfor holding individuals accountable for the outcomes of health\nbehaviors. Cavallero (2011: 393) distinguishes between socially\ndetectable and socially undetectable risky behaviors, with smoking an\nexample of the former and poor stress management an example of the\nlatter. He argues that it is not necessarily more fair, by luck\negalitarian lights, to only hold people responsible for the former\nbehaviors than to simply refrain from holding people responsible for\ntheir choices (Cavallero 2011: 395).\n\nSegall (2010), by contrast, accepts that luck egalitarians cannot\navoid the abandonment objection by appeal to egalitarian\nconsiderations, but can do so if they appeal to moral considerations\nunrelated to distributive justice\u2014e.g., meeting people\u2019s\nbasic needs. Voorhoeve (2019: 155) similarly adopts a pluralistic\nview, arguing that a luck egalitarian approach should be combined with\na social egalitarian approach since the latter\n\n\nspecifies that one has reason to be averse to choice-based\ninequalities that threaten people\u2019s status as equal citizens and\nsocial cohesion.\n\n\nOthers address the question of harmful health behaviors by developing\nRawls\u2019s (1982) concept of the social division of\nresponsibility. According to Rawls (1982 [1999: 371]), society is\nresponsible for securing people\u2019s basic liberties and providing\neach with a fair share of opportunities and income and wealth, while\nindividuals are responsible for setting goals and projects in light of\nthe legitimate claims they may make on social institutions. Applying\nthis concept to health inequalities, Kniess (2019: 115) argues that\npeople are responsible for the health outcomes of choices made under\nconditions of social justice, but not those outcomes due to choices\nmade under conditions of social disadvantage. As Kniess puts it,\n\n\nwhere there is no justice, there is no (substantive)\nresponsibility\u2026the disadvantaged in an unjust society are\ntherefore let off the hook, so to speak, no matter what they do or\ndon\u2019t do to look after their health. (2019: 116)\n\n\nEven if people\u2019s choices to drink excessively, eat an unhealthy\ndiet, or fail to exercise are voluntary, on this view, if such choices\nare made under conditions of unjust social disadvantage, people are\nnot responsible for the downstream consequences. Daniels (2011)\ndevelops a similar Rawlsian view, but emphasizes that even under\nconditions of social justice, policymakers should be wary of holding\nindividuals accountable for the costs of their health behaviors. We\nall have an interest, Daniels argues, in having the freedom to make\nchoices regarding sport, sex, and diet without the fear of social\nsanction when our choices turn out to be \u201cbad\u201d ones (see\nalso Fleck 2012).\n\nBen Davies and Julian Savulescu (2019) provide an alternative argument\nfor holding individuals responsible for the health behaviors. They\nargue that where healthcare systems are grounded in solidarity, people\nhave obligations to fellow members of the system to protect their\nhealth and may be held responsible for some or all of the costs of\ntreatment that result from a failure to do so. Solidarity, Davies and\nSavulescu (2019: 135) argue, is a two-way street, meaning that members\nof a system founded in solidarity not only have claims on other\nmembers of the system, but also obligations to them. These obligations\ninclude a duty not to impose unreasonable costs on members of\nthe system, with such costs being the result of refusals of\n\u201cGolden Opportunities\u201d, that is, refusals to make\nrealistically adoptable, health promoting behavioral changes, which\nare performed under conditions conducive to responsible choice (Davies\n& Savulescu 2019: 139\u2013140). Davies and Savulescu (2019, 141)\ncaution however, that it is only permissible to hold people\nresponsible for refusals of Golden Opportunities if solidarity is\npracticed in the broader social system, meaning that all people are\nheld responsible for failures of solidarity\u2014e.g., including the\nrich for tax avoidance.\n\nIn sum, although the claim that inequalities due to voluntary chosen\nhealth behaviors are not unjust is prima facie plausible, few are\nwilling to endorse it and/or its policy implications without\nsignificant qualification. Luck egalitarians either reject it by\nappealing to further egalitarian considerations or opt for a\npluralistic view that enables them to avoid its counter-intuitive\npolicy implications. Similarly, those who adopt either Rawlsian or\nsolidaristic approaches hold that people are only responsible for the\noutcomes of their voluntarily chosen health behaviors in the context\nof a just society.\n\nOthers reject the idea that people are responsible for health outcomes\ndue to harmful health behaviors. Daniel Wikler (2004) offers a\nsustained critique of the unmodified luck egalitarian view, pressing\nthe abandonment objection but also raising a number of practical\nproblems regarding the view\u2019s applications, including the\ndifficulty of identifying voluntary actions and the arbitrariness of\nfinding fault with some choices but not others (see also Fleck 2012).\nHe concludes that personal responsibility should only be employed in\nhealth policy as an ideal in health promotion campaigns to motivate\nand encourage people to take an active role in living healthy\nlives.\n\nNeil Levy (2019) similarly rejects the idea of personal responsibility\nfor health by focusing on the greater prevalence of harmful health\nbehaviors among people with low socioeconomic status. The explanation\nfor this disparity, Levy (2019: 106\u2013107) argues, is that such\npeople, due to their circumstances, have reduced agential capacities,\nlower education, and make choices under the stressful conditions of\npoverty. For many, these challenges are significant enough to render\nthem non-responsible for the behaviors that contribute to ill health.\nSince most people who are causally responsible for their ill health\nare morally non-responsible in this way, Levy argues (2019: 109),\nhealth policy should not be designed on the premise that people are\nresponsible for their ill health. Instead, since the distribution of\nagential capacities and the circumstances of choice is the result of\npublic policy and the actions of large corporations, it is these\nlatter actors who bear responsibility for the health outcomes in\nquestion (Levy 2019: 110).\n\nOthers are skeptical of this line of argument. Ben Schwan (2021)\ncautions that the mere fact that people\u2019s choices are influenced\nby the social determinants of health does not mean that they are not\nresponsible for them\u2014some social determinants of health are\n\u201cresponsibility-preserving\u201d. Cavallero (2019) argues\nsimilarly that the health-related choices of people with low\nsocio-economic status satisfy widely accepted criteria of responsible\nchoice, namely, that they are made in the context of reasonable\nalternatives and are not coerced. He argues further that questioning\nthe autonomy and responsibility of people of low socioeconomic status\nis incompatible with the liberal ideal that all competent adults are\ndeserving of equal respect and opens the door to paternalistic\nrestrictions of people\u2019s liberty (Cavallero 2019). This does not\nimply, however, that society is not also responsible for the\ndisparate health outcomes of low SES individuals. Cavallero (2019:\n378) agrees that the pattern Levy (2019) identifies is morally\ntroubling and argues that governments have an obligation to ensure\nthat people do\n\n\nnot face unequal health opportunities simply in virtue of their\nsocioeconomic status of origin if those inequalities are remediable\nthrough reasonable public interventions.\n\n\nFinally, others argue that the focus on personal responsibility in\ndebates regarding priority setting and health promotion is misplaced\nor even fundamentally mistaken. Phoebe Friesen (2018: 56) makes a\nstrong case that the behaviors policymakers wish to hold people\nresponsible for\u2014e.g., excessive drinking, smoking, and poor\neating habits\u2014are stigmatized. She challenges proponents of\nconsidering personal responsibility in health policy to either explain\ntheir focus on socially undesirable behaviors, or to extend their\narguments to include behaviors that contribute to ill health, are\nknown to be risky, and that are under people\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014e.g., living in a city with high levels of air\npollution, engaging in a dangerous sport, or spending too much time in\nthe sun (Friesen 2018: 56). Others worry that a focus on individual\nresponsibility may distract policymakers from the more urgent need to\naddress the social determinants of health and may also stigmatize\npeople who act \u201cirresponsibly\u201d (Voigt 2013; Goldberg\n2012). Since socio-economic conditions are the principal determinants\nof health outcomes, these critics argue, such structural factors ought\nto be the focus of public policy.\n",
