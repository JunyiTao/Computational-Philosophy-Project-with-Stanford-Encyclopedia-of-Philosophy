    "main_text": "Contrastive Underdetermination, Empirical Equivalents, and Unconceived Alternatives || Empirically Equivalent Theories\n3.2 Empirically Equivalent Theories\n\nOf course, generating and testing fundamental scientific hypotheses is\nrarely if ever a matter of finding curves that fit collections of data\npoints, so nothing follows directly from this mathematical analogy for\nthe significance of contrastive underdetermination in most scientific\ncontexts. But Bas van Fraassen has offered an extremely influential\nline of argument intended to show that such contrastive\nunderdetermination is a serious concern for scientific theorizing more\ngenerally. In The Scientific Image (1980), van Fraassen uses\na now-classic example to illustrate the possibility that even our best\nscientific theories might have empirical equivalents: that\nis, alternative theories making the very same empirical predictions,\nand which therefore cannot be better or worse supported by any\npossible body of evidence. Consider Newton\u2019s cosmology,\nwith its laws of motion and gravitational attraction. As Newton\nhimself realized, exactly the same predictions are made by the theory\nwhether we assume that the entire universe is at rest or assume\ninstead that it is moving with some constant velocity in any given\ndirection: from our position within it, we have no way to detect\nconstant, absolute motion by the universe as a whole. Thus, van\nFraassen argues, we are here faced with empirically equivalent\nscientific theories: Newtonian mechanics and gravitation conjoined\neither with the fundamental assumption that the universe is at\nabsolute rest (as Newton himself believed), or with any one of an\ninfinite variety of alternative assumptions about the constant\nvelocity with which the universe is moving in some particular\ndirection. All of these theories make all and only the same empirical\npredictions, so no evidence will ever permit us to decide between them\non empirical\n grounds.[7]\n\nVan Fraassen is widely (though mistakenly) regarded as holding that\nthe prospect of contrastive underdetermination grounded in such\nempirical equivalents demands that we restrict our epistemic ambitions\nfor the scientific enterprise itself. His constructive empiricism\nholds that the aim of science is not to find true theories, but only\ntheories that are empirically adequate: that is, theories whose claims\nabout observable phenomena are all true. Since the empirical\nadequacy of a theory is not threatened by the existence of another\nthat is empirically equivalent to it, fulfilling this aim has nothing\nto fear from the possibility of such empirical equivalents. In reply,\nmany critics have suggested that van Fraassen gives no reasons for\nrestricting belief to empirical adequacy that could not also be used\nto argue for suspending our belief in the future empirical\nadequacy of our best present theories. Of course there could\nbe empirical equivalents to our best theories, but there could also be\ntheories equally well-supported by all the evidence up to the present\nwhich diverge in their predictions about observables in future cases\nnot yet tested. This challenge seems to miss the point of van\nFraassen\u2019s epistemic voluntarism: his claim is that we should\nbelieve no more but also no less than we need to take full\nadvantage of our scientific theories, and a commitment to the\nempirical adequacy of our theories, he suggests, is the least we can\nget away with in this regard. Of course it is true that we are running\nsome epistemic risk in believing in even the full empirical adequacy\nof our present theories, but this is the minimum we need to take full\nadvantage of the fruits of our scientific labors, and the risk is\nconsiderably less than what we assume in believing in their truth: as\nvan Fraassen famously suggests, \u201cit is not an epistemic\nprinciple that one might as well hang for a sheep as a lamb\u201d\n(1980, 72).\n\nIn an influential discussion, Larry Laudan and Jarrett Leplin (1991)\nargue that philosophers of science have invested even the bare\npossibility that our theories might have empirical equivalents with\nfar too much epistemic significance. Notwithstanding the popularity of\nthe presumption that there are empirically equivalent rivals to every\ntheory, they argue, the conjunction of several familiar and relatively\nuncontroversial epistemological theses is sufficient to defeat it.\nBecause the boundaries of what is observable change as we develop new\nexperimental methods and instruments, because auxiliary assumptions\nare always needed to derive empirical consequences from a theory (cf.\nconfirmational holism, above), and because these auxiliary assumptions\nare themselves subject to change over time, Laudan and Leplin conclude\nthat there is no guarantee that any two theories judged to be\nempirically equivalent at a given time will remain so as the state of\nour knowledge advances. Accordingly, any judgment of empirical\nequivalence is both defeasible and relativized to a particular state\nof science. So even if two theories are empirically equivalent at a\ngiven time this is no guarantee that they will remain so, and\nthus there is no foundation for a general pessimism about our ability\nto distinguish theories that are empirically equivalent to each other\non empirical grounds. Although they concede that we could have good\nreason to think that particular theories have empirically equivalent\nrivals, this must be established case-by-case rather than by any\ngeneral argument or presumption.\n\nOne fairly standard reply to this line of argument is to suggest that\nwhat Laudan and Leplin really show is that the notion of empirical\nequivalence must be applied to larger collections of beliefs than\nthose traditionally identified as scientific theories\u2014at least\nlarge enough to encompass the auxiliary assumptions needed to derive\nempirical predictions from them. At the extreme, perhaps this means\nthat the notion of empirical equivalents (or at least timeless\nempirical equivalents) cannot be applied to anything less than\n\u201csystems of the world\u201d (i.e. total Quinean webs of\nbelief), but even that is not fatal: what the champion of contrastive\nunderdetermination asserts is that there are empirically equivalent\nsystems of the world that incorporate different theories of\nthe nature of light, or spacetime, or whatever (for useful discussion,\nsee Okasha 2002). On the other hand, it might seem that quick examples\nlike van Fraassen\u2019s variants of Newtonian cosmology do not serve\nto make this thesis as plausible as the more limited claim of\nempirical equivalence for individual theories. It seems equally\nnatural, however, to respond to Laudan and Leplin simply by conceding\nthe variability in empirical equivalence but insisting that this is\nnot enough to undermine the problem. Empirical equivalents create a\nserious obstacle to belief in a theory so long as there is\nsome empirical equivalent to that theory at any given time,\nbut it need not be the same one at each time. On this line of\nthinking, cases like van Fraassen\u2019s Newtonian example illustrate\nhow easy it is for theories to admit of empirical equivalents at any\ngiven time, and thus constitute a reason for thinking that there\nprobably are or will be empirical equivalents to any given theory at\nany particular time, assuring that whenever the question of belief in\na given theory arises, the challenge posed to it by contrastive\nunderdetermination arises as well.\n\nLaudan and Leplin also suggest, however, that even if the universal\nexistence of empirical equivalents were conceded, this would do much\nless to establish the significance of underdetermination than its\nchampions have supposed, because \u201ctheories with exactly the same\nempirical consequences may admit of differing degrees of evidential\nsupport\u201d (1991, 465). A theory may be better supported than an\nempirical equivalent, for instance, because the former but not the\nlatter is derivable from a more general theory whose consequences\ninclude a third, well supported, hypothesis. More generally, the\nbelief-worthiness of an hypothesis depends crucially on how it is\nconnected or related to other things we believe and the evidential\nsupport we have for those other\n beliefs.[8]\n Laudan and Leplin suggest that we have invited the specter of rampant\nunderdetermination only by failing to keep this familiar home truth in\nmind and instead implausibly identifying the evidence bearing on a\ntheory exclusively with the theory\u2019s own entailments or\nempirical consequences (but cf. Tulodziecki 2012). This impoverished\nview of evidential support, they argue, is in turn the legacy of a\nfailed foundationalist and positivistic approach to the philosophy of\nscience which mistakenly assimilates epistemic questions about how to\ndecide whether or not to believe a theory to semantic questions about\nhow to establish a theory\u2019s meaning or truth-conditions.\n\nJohn Earman (1993) has argued that this dismissive diagnosis does not\ndo justice to the threat posed by underdetermination. He argues that\nworries about underdetermination are an aspect of the more general\nquestion of the reliability of our inductive methods for determining\nbeliefs, and notes that we cannot decide how serious a problem\nunderdetermination poses without specifying (as Laudan and Leplin do\nnot) the inductive methods we are considering. Earman regards some\nversion of Bayesianism as our most promising form of inductive\nmethodology, and he proceeds to show that challenges to the long-run\nreliability of our Bayesian methods can be motivated by considerations\nof the empirical indistinguishability (in several different and\nprecisely specified senses) of hypotheses stated in any language\nricher than that of the evidence itself that do not amount simply to\ngeneral skepticism about those inductive methods. In other words, he\nshows that there are more reasons to worry about underdetermination\nconcerning inferences to hypotheses about unobservables than to, say,\ninferences about unobserved observables. He also goes on to argue that\nat least two genuine cosmological theories have serious, nonskeptical,\nand nonparasitic empirical equivalents: the first essentially replaces\nthe gravitational field in Newtonian mechanics with curvature in\nspacetime itself,\n [9]\n while the second recognizes that Einstein\u2019s General Theory of\nRelativity permits cosmological models exhibiting different global\ntopological features which cannot be distinguished by any evidence\ninside the light cones of even idealized observers who live\n forever.[10]\n And he suggests that \u201cthe production of a few concrete examples\nis enough to generate the worry that only a lack of imagination on our\npart prevents us from seeing comparable examples of underdetermination\nall over the map\u201d (1993, 31) even as he concedes that his case\nleaves open just how far the threat of underdetermination extends\n(1993, 36).\n\nMost philosophers of science, however, have not embraced the idea that\nit is only lack of imagination which prevents us from finding\nempirical equivalents to our scientific theories generally. They note\nthat the convincing examples of empirical equivalents we do have are\nall drawn from a single domain of highly mathematized scientific\ntheorizing in which the background constraints on serious theoretical\nalternatives are far from clear, and suggest that it is therefore\nreasonable to ask whether even a small handful of such examples should\nmake us believe that there are probably empirical equivalents to most\nof our scientific theories most of the time. They concede that it is\nalways possible that there are empirical equivalents to even\nour best scientific theories concerning any domain of nature, but\ninsist that we should not be willing to suspend belief in any\nparticular theory until some convincing alternative to it can\nactually be produced: as Philip Kitcher puts it, \u201cgive us a\nrival explanation, and we\u2019ll consider whether it is sufficiently\nserious to threaten our confidence\u201d (1993, 154; see also Leplin\n1997, Achinstein 2002). That is, these thinkers insist that until we\nare able to actually construct an empirically equivalent\nalternative to a given theory, the bare possibility that such\nequivalents exist is insufficient to justify suspending belief in the\nbest theories we do have. For this same reason most philosophers of\nscience are unwilling to follow van Fraassen into what they regard as\nconstructive empiricism\u2019s unwarranted epistemic modesty. Even if\nvan Fraassen is right about the most minimal beliefs we must hold in\norder to take full advantage of our scientific theories, most thinkers\ndo not see why we should believe the least we can get away with rather\nthan believing the most we are entitled to by the evidence we\nhave.\n\nChampions of contrastive underdetermination have most frequently\nresponded by trying to establish that all theories have\nempirical equivalents, typically by proposing something like an\nalgorithmic procedure for generating such equivalents from any theory\nwhatsoever. Stanford (2001, 2006) suggests that these efforts to\nprove that all our theories must have empirical equivalents\nfall roughly but reliably into global and local varieties, and that\nneither makes a convincing case for a distinctive scientific problem\nof contrastive underdetermination. Global algorithms are\nwell-represented by Andre Kukla\u2019s (1996) suggestion that from\nany theory T we can immediately generate such empirical\nequivalents as T\u2032 (the claim that T\u2019s\nobservable consequences are true, but T itself is false),\nT\u2033 (the claim that the world behaves according to\nT when observed, but some specific incompatible alternative\notherwise), and the hypothesis that our experience is being\nmanipulated by powerful beings in such a way as to make it appear that\nT is true. But such possibilities, Stanford argues, amount to\nnothing more than the sort of Evil Deceiver to which Descartes\nappealed in order to doubt any of his beliefs that could possibly be\ndoubted (see Section 1, above). Such radically skeptical scenarios\npose an equally powerful (or powerless) challenge to any knowledge\nclaim whatsoever, no matter how it is arrived at or justified, and\nthus pose no special problem or challenge for beliefs offered\nto us by theoretical science. If global algorithms like Kukla\u2019s\nare the only reasons we can give for taking underdetermination\nseriously in a scientific context, then there is no distinctive\nproblem of the underdetermination of scientific theories by data, only\na salient reminder of the irrefutability of classically Cartesian or\nradical\n skepticism.[11]\n\nIn contrast to such global strategies for generating empirical\nequivalents, local algorithmic strategies instead begin with some\nparticular scientific theory and proceed to generate alternative\nversions that will be equally well supported by all possible evidence.\nThis is what van Fraassen does with the example of Newtonian\ncosmology, showing that an infinite variety of supposed empirical\nequivalents can be produced by ascribing different constant absolute\nvelocities to the universe as a whole. But Stanford suggests that\nempirical equivalents generated in this way are also insufficient to\nshow that there is a distinctive and genuinely troubling form of\nunderdetermination afflicting scientific theories, because they rely\non simply saddling particular scientific theories with further claims\nfor which those theories themselves (together with whatever background\nbeliefs we actually hold) imply that we cannot have any evidence. Such\nempirical equivalents invite the natural response that they simply\ntack on to our theories further commitments that are or should be no\npart of those theories themselves. Such claims, it seems, should\nsimply be excised from our theories, leaving over just the claims that\nsensible defenders would have held were all we were entitled to\nbelieve by the evidence in any case. In van Fraassen\u2019s Newtonian\nexample, for instance, this could be done simply by undertaking no\ncommitment concerning the absolute velocity and direction (or lack\nthereof) of the universe as a whole. Note also that if we believe a\ngiven scientific theory when one of the empirical equivalents we could\ngenerate from it by the local algorithmic strategy is correct instead,\nmost of what we originally believed will nonetheless turn out to be\nstraightforwardly true. Philosophers of science have responded in\na variety of ways to the suggestion that a few or even a small handful\nof serious examples of empirical equivalents does not suffice to\nestablish that there are probably such equivalents to most scientific\ntheories in most domains of inquiry. One such reaction has been to\ninvite more careful attention to the details of particular examples of\nputative underdetermination: considerable work has been devoted to\nassessing the threat of underdetermination in the case of particular\nscientific theories (for recent examples see Pietsch 2012; Tulodziecki\n2013; Werndl 2013; Belot 2014; Butterfield 2014; Miyake 2015; Kovaka\n2019; Fletcher 2021, and others). Other thinkers have sought to\ninvestigate whether certain types of scientific theories or theories\nin particular scientific fields differ in the extent to which they are\ngenuinely threatened by underdetermination. Some have argued that\nunderdetermination poses a less serious (Cleland 2002; Carman 2005) or\na more serious (Turner 2005, 2007) challenge for\n\u2018historical\u2019 sciences like geology, paleontology, and\narchaeology than it does for \u2018experimental\u2019 sciences like\nparticle physics. Others have resisted such generalizations but\nnonetheless argued that underdetermination predicaments arise in\ndistinctive or characteristic ways in historical sciences and that\nscientists in these fields have different resources and strategies for\naddressing them (Currie 2018; Forber and Griffith 2011; Stanford\n2010). Finally, some thinkers have sought to defend particular forms\nof explanation frequently deployed in historical sciences, such as\nnarrative explanation (Sterelny and Currie 2017), from the charge that\nthey suffer from rampant underdetermination.\n\n",
