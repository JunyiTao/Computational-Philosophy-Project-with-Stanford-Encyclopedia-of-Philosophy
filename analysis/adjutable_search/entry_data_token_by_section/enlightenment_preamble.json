    "main_text": "\n\nThe heart of the eighteenth century Enlightenment is the loosely\norganized activity of prominent French thinkers of the mid-decades of\nthe eighteenth century, the so-called\n\u201cphilosophes\u201d(e.g., Voltaire, D\u2019Alembert,\nDiderot, Montesquieu). The philosophes constituted an\ninformal society of men of letters who collaborated on a loosely\ndefined project of Enlightenment exemplified by the project of the\nEncyclopedia (see below 1.5). However, there are noteworthy\ncenters of Enlightenment outside of France as well. There is a\nrenowned Scottish Enlightenment (key figures are Frances Hutcheson,\nAdam Smith, David Hume, Thomas Reid), a German Enlightenment (die\nAufkl\u00e4rung, key figures of which include Christian Wolff,\nMoses Mendelssohn, G.E. Lessing and Immanuel Kant), and there are also\nother hubs of Enlightenment and Enlightenment thinkers scattered\nthroughout Europe and America in the eighteenth century.\n\nWhat makes for the unity of such tremendously diverse thinkers under\nthe label of \u201cEnlightenment\u201d? For the purposes of this\nentry, the Enlightenment is conceived broadly. D\u2019Alembert, a\nleading figure of the French Enlightenment, characterizes his\neighteenth century, in the midst of it, as \u201cthe century of\nphilosophy par excellence\u201d, because of the tremendous\nintellectual and scientific progress of the age, but also because of\nthe expectation of the age that philosophy (in the broad sense of the\ntime, which includes the natural and social sciences) would\ndramatically improve human life. Guided by D\u2019Alembert\u2019s\ncharacterization of his century, the Enlightenment is conceived here\nas having its primary origin in the scientific revolution of the 16th\nand 17th centuries. The rise of the new science progressively\nundermines not only the ancient geocentric conception of the cosmos,\nbut also the set of presuppositions that had served to constrain and\nguide philosophical inquiry in the earlier times. The dramatic success\nof the new science in explaining the natural world promotes philosophy\nfrom a handmaiden of theology, constrained by its purposes and\nmethods, to an independent force with the power and authority to\nchallenge the old and construct the new, in the realms both of theory\nand practice, on the basis of its own principles. Taking as the core\nof the Enlightenment the aspiration for intellectual progress, and the\nbelief in the power of such progress to improve human society and\nindividual lives, this entry includes descriptions of relevant aspects\nof the thought of earlier thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, Descartes,\nBayle, Leibniz, and Spinoza, thinkers whose contributions are\nindispensable to understanding the eighteenth century as \u201cthe\ncentury of philosophy par excellence\u201d.\n\nThe Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions\nand ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. The energy\ncreated and expressed by the intellectual foment of Enlightenment\nthinkers contributes to the growing wave of social unrest in France in\nthe eighteenth century. The social unrest comes to a head in the\nviolent political upheaval which sweeps away the traditionally and\nhierarchically structured ancien r\u00e9gime (the monarchy,\nthe privileges of the nobility, the political power of the Catholic\nChurch). The French revolutionaries meant to establish in place of the\nancien r\u00e9gime a new reason-based order instituting the\nEnlightenment ideals of liberty and equality. Though the\nEnlightenment, as a diverse intellectual and social movement, has no\ndefinite end, the devolution of the French Revolution into the Terror\nin the 1790s, corresponding, as it roughly does, with the end of the\neighteenth century and the rise of opposed movements, such as\nRomanticism, can serve as a convenient marker of the end of the\nEnlightenment, conceived as an historical period.\n\nFor Enlightenment thinkers themselves, however, the Enlightenment is\nnot an historical period, but a process of social, psychological or\nspiritual development, unbound to time or place. Immanuel Kant defines\n\u201cenlightenment\u201d in his famous contribution to debate on\nthe question in an essay entitled \u201cAn Answer to the Question:\nWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d (1784), as humankind\u2019s release\nfrom its self-incurred immaturity; \u201cimmaturity is the inability\nto use one\u2019s own understanding without the guidance of\nanother.\u201d Expressing convictions shared among Enlightenment\nthinkers of widely divergent doctrines, Kant identifies enlightenment\nwith the process of undertaking to think for oneself, to employ and\nrely on one\u2019s own intellectual capacities in determining what to\nbelieve and how to act. Enlightenment philosophers from across the\ngeographical and temporal spectrum tend to have a great deal of\nconfidence in humanity\u2019s intellectual powers, both to achieve\nsystematic knowledge of nature and to serve as an authoritative guide\nin practical life. This confidence is generally paired with suspicion\nor hostility toward other forms or carriers of authority (such as\ntradition, superstition, prejudice, myth and miracles), insofar as\nthese are seen to compete with the authority of one\u2019s own reason\nand experience. Enlightenment philosophy tends to stand in tension\nwith established religion, insofar as the release from self-incurred\nimmaturity in this age, daring to think for oneself, awakening\none\u2019s intellectual powers, generally requires opposing the role\nof established religion in directing thought and action. The faith of\nthe Enlightenment \u2013 if one may call it that \u2013 is that the\nprocess of enlightenment, of becoming progressively self-directed in\nthought and action through the awakening of one\u2019s intellectual\npowers, leads ultimately to a better, more fulfilled human\nexistence.\n\nThis entry describes the main tendencies of Enlightenment thought in\nthe following main sections: (1) The True: Science, Epistemology, and\nMetaphysics in the Enlightenment; (2) The Good: Political Theory,\nEthical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment; (3) The Beautiful:\nAesthetics in the Enlightenment.\n",
