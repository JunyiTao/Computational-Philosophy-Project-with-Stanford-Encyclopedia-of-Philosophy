    "main_text": "\n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva (late 7th to mid-8th century\nCE) was a Buddhist monk, philosopher, and poet whose reflections on\nthe overall structure of Buddhist moral commitments reach a level of\ngenerality and theoretical power that is hard to find elsewhere in\nIndian thought. His writings were immensely influential in the\ndevelopment of the Tibetan religious tradition. Though\n\u015a\u0101ntideva repeatedly denied that he had said anything\noriginal, his two major works may nevertheless represent the single\nmost significant contribution of the Buddhist tradition to the global\nenterprise of ethical theory. And some of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\npoetic passages exhibit an emotional and rhetorical power that gives\nthem a claim to be included among the greatest achievements of world\nliterature.\n",
