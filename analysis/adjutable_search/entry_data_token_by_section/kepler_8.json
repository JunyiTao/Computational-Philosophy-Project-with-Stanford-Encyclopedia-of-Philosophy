Copernicanism reformed and the three planetary laws\n\nToday Kepler is remembered in the history of sciences above all for\nhis three planetary laws, which he produced in very specific contexts\nand at different times. While it is questionable whether he would have\nunderstood these scientific statements as \u201claws\u201d\u2014and\nit is even arguable that he used this term with a different meaning\nthan we do today\u2014it seems to be clear that all three laws (as a\nlinguistic convention, we may continue to use the term) suppose some\nfundamentals of Kepler\u2019s philosophy: (a) realism, (b) causality,\n(c) the geometric structure of the cosmos. Besides this, it should be\nremarked that the common denominator of all three laws is\nKepler\u2019s defense of the Copernican worldview, a cosmological\nsystem which he was not able to defend without reforming it radically.\nIt is noteworthy that already at the very beginning of his career\nKepler vehemently defended the reality of the Copernican worldview in\na way that he characterized, taking over the terminology from the\nstandard Aristotelian epistemology, as \u201ca priori\u201d (see\nabove Section 3 above and Di Liscia 2009).\n\n\nFigure 2. \nKepler\u2019s first law of ellipse and second law of areas (modern\nrepresentation with greatly exaggerated eccentricity).\n\n\nThe first two laws were published initially in AN (1609), although it\nis known that Kepler had arrived at these results much earlier. His\nfirst law establishes that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with\nthe Sun in one of the foci (see Figure 2). According to the second\nlaw, the radius vector from the Sun to a planet P sweeps out equal\nareas, for instance \\(SP_1P_2\\) and \\(SP_3P_4\\), in equal times. The\nplanet P is therefore faster at perihelion, where it is\ncloser to the Sun, and slower at aphelion, where it is farther from\nthe Sun. In accordance with his dynamical approach, Kepler first found\nthe second law and, then, as a further result because of the effect\nproduced by the supposed force, the elliptical path of the planets\n(for the two first planetary laws see especially Aiton 1973, 1975a,\nDavis 1992a\u2013e, and 1998a; Donahue 1994; Wilson 1968 and 1972; for\nKepler\u2019s system of conics in connection with his optics see the\nrecent study by Del Centina, 2016).\n\nPerhaps the most significant impact of Kepler\u2019s two laws can be\nfound by considering their cosmological consequences. The first law\nabolishes the old axiom of the circular orbits of the planets, an\naxiom which was still valid not only for pre-Copernican astronomy and\ncosmology but also for Copernicus himself, and for Tycho and Galileo.\nThe second law breaks with another axiom of traditional astronomy,\naccording to which the motion of the planets is uniform in swiftness.\nThe Ptolemaic tradition in astronomy was, of course, aware of this\ndifficulty and applied a particularly effective device for saving the\n\u201cappearance\u201d of acceleration: the equant. Copernicus, for\nhis own part, insisted on the necessity of the axiom of uniform\ncircular motion. Ptolemy\u2019s equant was understood by Copernicus\nas a technical device based on the violation of this axiom. Kepler, on\nthe contrary, affirms the reality of changes in the velocities of the\nplanetary motions and provides a physical account for them. After\nstruggling strenuously with established ideas which were located not\nonly in the tradition before him but also in his own thinking, Kepler\nabandoned the circular path of planetary motion and in this way\ninitiated a more empirical approach to cosmology (though see\nBrackenridge 1982).\n\nKepler published the third law, the so-called \u201charmonic\nlaw\u201d, for the first time in his Harmonice mundi (1619),\ni.e., ten years later. In his Epitome, he provided a more\nsystematic approach to all three laws, their grounds and implications\n(see Davis 2003; Stephenson 1987). In Book 5, chapter 3, as point 8 of\n13 (KGW 6, p. 302; Engl. trans., pp. 411\u201312), Kepler expresses,\nalmost accidentally, his fundamental relationship connecting elapsed\ntimes with distances, which in modern notation could be expressed\nas:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\n\nwith \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) representing the periodic times of two\nplanets and \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) the length of their semi-major axes. A\nfurther formulation of this relationship, which is often found in the\nliterature, is: \\(a^3/T^2 = K\\), which expresses with \\(K\\) that\nthe relationship between the third power of the distances and the\nsquare of the times is a constant (however, see Davis 2005,\npp. 171\u2013172; for the third planetary law see especially\nStephenson 1987). As a consequence of the third law, the time a planet\ntakes to travel around the Sun will significantly increase the farther\naway it is or the longer the radius of its orbit. Thus, for instance,\nSaturn\u2019s sidereal period is almost 30 years, while Mercury needs\nfewer than 88 days to go around the Sun. For the history of cosmology,\nit is important to make clear that the third law fulfils\nKepler\u2019s search for a\nsystematic representation and defense of the Copernican\nworldview, in which planets are not absolutely independent of each\nother but integrated in a harmonic world system.\n",
