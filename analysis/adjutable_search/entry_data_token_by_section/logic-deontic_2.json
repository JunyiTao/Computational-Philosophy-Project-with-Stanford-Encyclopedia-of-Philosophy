    "main_text": "Informal Preliminaries and Background || The Traditional Scheme and the Modal Analogies\n1.2 The Traditional Scheme and the Modal Analogies\n\nWe now turn to some of the analogies involved in what is a\ncorresponding bit of deontic folk logic, following the exposition in\nMcNamara 1996a,b. This is a minor elaboration of elements that can be\nfound explicitly in von Wright 1951b and Prior 1955 [1962]. However,\nmuch of it has roots in medieval Islamic and late medieval European\nthought, where possible analogies between deontic modals and alethic\nmodals were being explored and formal deontic schemes were\n proposed.[9]\n\nExpressed as sentential operators, the six normative statuses of what\nwe will call \u201cthe Traditional Scheme\u201d are:\n\n\nit is obligatory that \\((\\OB)\\)\nit is permissible that \\((\\PE)\\)\nit is impermissible that \\((\\IM)\\)\nit is omissible that \\((\\OM)\\)\nit is optional that \\((\\OP)\\)\nit is non-optional that\n \\((\\NO)\\).[10]\n\n\n\nThe first three are the most often cited, the fourth is often not\nlabeled, and the fifth has regularly been mislabeled as \u201cit is a\nmatter of indifference that\u201d, and so likewise for the\nsixth. Typically, one of the first two is taken as primitive, and the\nothers defined in terms of it, but any of the first four can play the\nsame defining role. The most prevalent approach is to take \\(\\OB\\) as\nprimitive, and define the rest as\n follows:[11]\n \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\PE p & \\eqdf \\neg \\OB \\neg p\\\\ \\IM p & \\eqdf \\OB \\neg p \\\\ \\OM p & \\eqdf \\neg \\OB p \\\\ \\OP p & \\eqdf (\\neg \\OB p \\amp \\neg \\OB \\neg p).\\\\ \\NO p & \\eqdf (\\OB p \\vee \\OB \\neg p).\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nThese definitions imply that something is permissible iff (if and only\nif) its negation is not obligatory, impermissible iff its negation is\nobligatory, omissible iff it is not obligatory, optional iff neither\nit nor its negation is obligatory, and non-optional iff it is either\nobligatory or impermissible. Call this \u201cThe Traditional\nDefinitional Scheme (TDS)\u201d. It, or minor variants, are\nfound as far back as Ockham in European thought, and quite explicitly\nin Leibniz in the modern\n period.[12]\n If one began with \\(\\OB\\) alone and considered the formulas on the\nright above, one could easily be led to consider them as at least\ncandidate defining conditions for those on the left. Although not\nuncontestable, they are natural, and this scheme has been very widely\nemployed. Now if the reader looks back at our use of the necessity\noperator in defining the remaining five alethic modal operators, it\nwill be clear that these are perfectly analogous to the five deontic\ndefinitions above. From the formal standpoint, the one is merely a\nsyntactic variant of the other: just replace \\(\\OB\\) with \\(\\Box\\),\n\\(\\PE\\) with \\(\\Diamond\\), etc.\n\nIn addition to the TDS, it was traditionally assumed that the\nfollowing, call it \u201cThe Traditional Threefold Classification\n(TTC)\u201d holds:\n\n\n\nFig. 3\n\n\nAs in the modal case, the thought is that all propositions are divided\ninto three jointly exhaustive and mutually exclusive classes: every\nproposition is obligatory, impermissible or neither (that is,\noptional) and no proposition falls into more than one of these three\ncategories. Furthermore, the permissible propositions are those that\nare obligatory or optional, the omissible propositions are those that\nare impermissible or optional, and the non-optional propositions are\nthose that are either obligatory or impermissible. This classification\ntoo has roots centuries\n ago.[13]\n The reader can easily confirm that this natural scheme is also\nperfectly analogous to the threefold classification we gave above for\nnecessary, contingent and impossible propositions.\n\nFurthermore, as indicated earlier, \u201cThe Deontic Square\u201d\n(DS) is also often cited in the historical literature:\n\n\n\nFig. 4\n [An extended description of figure 4.]\n\n\nThe relationships between the logical operators at the corners are to\nbe interpreted as in the modal square of opposition. The two squares\nare perfectly analogous. If we weave in nodes for optionality and\nnon-optionality, we get a deontic\n hexagon:[14]\n\n\n\nFig. 5\n [An extended description of figure 5.]\n\n\nGiven these analogies, it is unsurprising that our primitive operator,\nread here as \u201cit is obligatory that\u201d, is often referred to\nas \u201cdeontic necessity\u201d. However, there are also\nobvious disanalogies with alethic necessity. Before, we cited two\nprinciples for alethic necessity whose deontic analogs are clearly\nfalse:\n\n\nIf \\(\\OB p\\) then \\(p\\) (if it is obligatory that \\(p\\), then\n\\(p\\) is true).\nIf \\(p\\), then \\(\\PE p\\) (if \\(p\\) is true, then it is\npermissible).\n\n\n\nObligations can be violated, and impermissible things do\n happen.[15]\n However, as researchers turned to generalizations of alethic modal\nlogic, they began to consider wider classes of modal logics, including\nones where the necessity operator was not truth-implicating.\nThis too encouraged seeing deontic logic as falling within modal logic\nso-generalized. In fact, recognizing possibilities like this helped to\nfuel the generalizations of what began with a focus on alethic modal\nlogic to normal modal logics (Lemmon & Scott 1977).\n\nWe will revisit the Traditional Scheme in a more precise and unifying\nway in the next section. There is a sense in which it is an earlier\ninformal and widely endorsed fragment of the most well-known deontic\nlogic, a logic that makes the connection to alethic modal logic even\ntighter. We now turn to that logic.\n",
