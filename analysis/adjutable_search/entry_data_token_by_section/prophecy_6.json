    "main_text": "Middle Knowledge\n7. Conclusion\n\nThere are several ways to try to resolve the problem of prophecy that\nis the focus of most philosophical debate, which arises in cases where\na future contingent event is predicted. The approaches discussed here\npossess various strengths and weaknesses. The question of prophecy has\nbeen receiving increased attention as the debate over the extent of\nGod\u2019s knowledge has become more widely discussed in recent work\nin the philosophy of religion. As a result, one could reasonably\npredict (prophesy?) that philosophical arguments concerning these\nmatters will continue indefinitely into the future. \n",
