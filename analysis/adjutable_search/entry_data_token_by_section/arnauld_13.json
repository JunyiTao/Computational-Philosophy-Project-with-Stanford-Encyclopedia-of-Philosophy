    "main_text": "Arnauld\u2019s Compatibilism\n6. Arnauld\u2019s Compatibilism\n\nThroughout his enormously active life as a philosopher and theologian,\nArnauld was above all concerned to defend the doctrine that human\nbeings, after the fall of Adam, can perform meritorious actions, but\nonly if the actions are the result of a supernatural gr\u00e2ce\nefficace par elle-m\u00eame. Arnauld claimed to find this\ndoctrine in the writings of both Augustine and Aquinas and he defended\nJansen\u2019s version of it against the charge of heresy, even though\nJansen\u2019s version was significantly different from that espoused\nby Arnauld himself. But Arnauld, like Augustine, Aquinas, and Jansen,\nalso held that actions are meritorious only if they are free.\nFor this reason, Arnauld is sometimes said to be a\n\u201ccompatibilist.\u201d For example, Robert Sleigh says,\n\u201cIt is worth noting that Leibniz and Arnauld both ascribed\ncompatibilism to St. Thomas and that both accepted compatibilism as\nwell\u201d (Sleigh 1990, 29).\n\nThe position Arnauld defended and attributed to Augustine and Aquinas\nis, however, quite different from what is nowadays referred to as\n\u201ccompatibilism.\u201d The position is connected with\nArnauld\u2019s treatment of free will during the last decade of his\nlife, at the time when he was wrestling with Malebranche\u2019s\ntheory of nature and grace. At that time, Arnauld developd the\nposition that the human will is free when and only when it is a\n\u201cpotestas ou facultas ad opposita.\u201d But\nfirst, it is necessary to provide some background for the notion of\ngr\u00e2ce efficace par elle-m\u00eame.\n",
