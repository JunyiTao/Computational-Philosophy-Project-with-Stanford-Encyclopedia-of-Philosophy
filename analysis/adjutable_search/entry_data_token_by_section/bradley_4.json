    "main_text": "Logic\n5. Logic\n\nBradley\u2019s most sustained treatment of logic comes in The\nPrinciples of Logic, published contemporaneously with\nFrege\u2019s Grundlagen. The benefit of hindsight provides a\nstriking contrast between these works, the former apparently looking\nback to the nineteenth century, the latter anticipating the twentieth.\nWhile both books eschew formal methods, in Frege\u2019s case this\nresults merely from an attempt to give a readable account of some\napplications of mathematical logic. But the absence of formulae\n(theorems, axioms, rules of inference) from Bradley\u2019s book is\nintrinsic to it, expressing an opposition (shared by Mill) to the\nformalization of reasoning in principle, as detaching\ninference from the practical acquisition of scientific knowledge.\nThis, together with the fact that familiar terms (e.g.\n\u2018contradiction\u2019) are used in unfamiliar ways, gives the\nbook an archaic feel. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that\nPrinciples would no longer ordinarily be consulted by a\nmodern logician unless for historical purposes, it focuses on issues\ncentral to logic, and the impression of its being backward-looking is\nto some extent misleading: for example, it uses the older vocabulary\nof \u2018ideas\u2019 and \u2018judgments\u2019 to express views\nwhich, often through their (selective) impact upon Russell, gave rise\nto doctrines subsequently expressed in terms of sentences and\npropositions; and it effectively exposed the notions of meaning and\nreference to a sceptical scrutiny which has continued long since.\n\nAlthough the treatment is less rigidly dialectical than that of\nEthical Studies, Bradley develops his views through criticism\nof others, and alters them as he goes along. One result is that the\nbook is far from easy to consult, and a reader determined to\nfind out what Bradley thinks must be prepared to follow its argument\nthrough many twists and turns, including occasional incursions into\nthe fields of epistemology, phenomenology, and metaphysics.\n\nTraditionally, logic books came divided into three parts, dealing\nrespectively with Conception (usually via ideas, the\ntraditional components of judgments), Judgment and Inference. Bradley\nboth inherits and transforms this tradition, keeping the three-part\nformat but devoting the first to Judgment and both second and third\nparts to Inference, thus dropping the separate treatment of\nConception. This is significant in that it reflects his rejection of\nthe standard view that judgments are formed by somehow conjoining\nideas: for example, the Port-Royal Logic\u2019s Aristotelian\nclaim that they are \u2018necessarily composed of three elements\n\u2014 the subject-idea, the attribute, and the joining of these two\nideas\u2019. Bradley attacks such doctrines on more than one\nfront.\n\nHe argues, for instance, that those who, like Hume, think judgments to\nconsist of separable ideas, fail to identify the sense of\n\u2018idea\u2019 in which ideas are important to logic: ideas in\nthis sense are not separate and datable psychological events (such as\nmy now visualizing a rainbow) but abstract universals. Once ideas are\nproperly understood, he suggests, they can no longer even plausibly be\nthought of as individual and mutually independent entities which can\nbe put together to create a judgment (as Locke maintains in Chapter\nXIV of Book IV of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding):\nthe order of dependence is the opposite, ideas being abstractions from\ncomplete judgments. This theory could be aptly referred to as the\n\u2018monistic\u2019 theory of judgment, as the parallel with\nBradley\u2019s metaphysical views is immediately evident: the\nrejection of independent substances held together by relational ties\ngoes hand in hand with the rejection of independent ideas held\ntogether by the copula. Equally evident is the challenge this poses\nfor earlier conceptions of analysis as the decomposition of a complex\ninto its simple constituents, for on this view there are no\nconstituents to begin with. Here, albeit in his archaic vocabulary,\nBradley identifies in advance the difficulties which Russell was later\nto face in trying to reconcile the unity of the proposition with what\nhe thought to be the mutual independence of its constituents,\ndifficulties which appeared in another guise for Frege in his attempt\nto maintain a strict division between concepts and objects.\n\nFurther, given that ideas are universals, accounts like that of\nPort-Royal make it impossible to see how judgment can be about\nreality, since its ideas represent kinds of things, while those real\nthings themselves are particular; so long as judgment is confined to\nideas, there can be no unique identification of any item about which\nwe judge. Bradley applies the point to language, arguing that even\ngrammatically proper names and demonstratives are disguised general\nterms. Even spatial and temporal specifications (X as the object/event\noccupying location Z at time Y) fail as unambiguous principles of\nindividuation; they would indeed be able to successfully individuate\nparticular objects/events within a given spatiotemporal series, yet\nthey would not be able to differentiate one spatiotemporal series from\nanother. The final outcome is that reference cannot be fixed solely in\nterms of language and abstract descriptions; it rather presupposes an\nimmediate encounter in reality through our experience.\n\nThese insights appear to anticipate that application of\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions in which it is used to\neliminate grammatical names in favour of quantified general sentences.\nWhether or not this is actually the origin of that theory, there is no\ndoubt in another case: Russell, who claimed in correspondence to have\nread Principles closely, acknowledged openly that he was\nconvinced by Bradley\u2019s argument that the logical form of\nuniversal sentences is hypothetical (so that, e.g., \u2018All cows\neat grass\u2019 is to be understood as saying \u2018If anything is a\ncow then it eats grass\u2019). In this way, Bradley had a\nsignificant, if indirect, impact on predicate calculus. His role as a\nprecursor of modern logic should not be overemphasized, however, since\nhe acknowledges that the interpretation of universal sentences as\nhypothetical was suggested to him by his reading of Herbart.\n\nBradley\u2019s own account of judgment is that it is \u2018the act\nwhich refers an ideal content ... to a reality beyond the act\u2019,\nso that the logical form of every judgment is \u2018Reality is such\nthat, if anything is S then it is P\u2019. This formulation makes\nintelligible what is superficially paradoxical in Bradley, when he\nsays: \u2018All judgments are categorical, for they all do affirm\nabout the reality, and assert their content of that. Again, all are\nhypothetical, for not one of them can ascribe to reality its content\nunconditionally\u2019 (Principles, Bk I, Ch. II, sec. 79,\nmodified according to Bradley\u2019s notes to the Second Edition). It\nis not hard to see in this an informal anticipation of the\nrepresentation of sentences in terms of a combination of universal\nquantifier and object- and predicate-variables. Consider also\nBradley\u2019s treatment of sentences about fictional entities, such\nas \u2018There are no ghosts\u2019. On Bradley\u2019s analysis,\nthis turns out to be a condensed form for \u2018Reality is no place\nwhere ghosts exist\u2019. One sees here the close similarity with\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions, where a negative existential\nlike \u2018Pegasus does not exist\u2019 is not a statement about a\nnon-existent Pegasus, but simply asserts that the universe of\ndiscourse (now playing the logical function of Bradley\u2019s\n\u2018Reality\u2019) does not contain any individuals that possess\nall features ascribed to Pegasus in books of mythology. (Here as\nelsewhere the book looks forward as well as back.)\n\nDespite these significant steps in the direction of later logical\ntheories, it is an exaggeration to claim, as some have done, that\nBradley\u2019s strictures on the account of judgment as a combination\nof ideas mean that he is straightforwardly opposed to psychologism in\nlogic, for it is clear that he thinks logic\u2019s subject matter to\nbe mental acts, not sentences or statements. This is already evident\nin his definition of judgement as \u2018the act which refers an ideal\ncontent... to a reality beyond the act\u2019 (Principles, Bk\nI, Ch. I, sec. 10).\n\nBradley continues to criticize traditional logic when he turns from\njudgment to inference. Just as he rejected the Aristotelian account of\njudgments as combinations of subject and predicate, he rejects\nAristotelian syllogistic (for the same reason as he later rejects\nMill\u2019s canons of induction): it misses the fact that reasoning\ncan take place only through the generality involved in universals.\nUniversals are thus essential to inference, and for this reason\nHume\u2019s account of inference in terms of the association of ideas\ncollapses: Humean ideas are particulars, fleeting episodes which\ncannot be revived by association. This does not mean that association\nof ideas is impossible, but genuine association (which Bradley calls\n\u2018redintegration\u2019) can involve only universals.\n\nSurprisingly for those who subscribe to the common view, first\nbroadcast by Russell in 1900 in A Critical Exposition of the\nPhilosophy of Leibniz and much repeated thereafter, that Bradley\nthought all judgments to be of subject/predicate form and accordingly\nfailed to recognize relational judgments as a distinct kind,\nBradley\u2019s treatment of inference includes the complaint that the\nmathematical logics of his time cannot represent valid relational\ninferences. His own initial account of inference is that it is\n\u2018ideal experiment\u2019: \u2018ideal\u2019 in that these are\nthought-experiments which remain in the realm of idea, but\nnevertheless experiments in that their results are not guaranteed in\nadvance by a complete set of logical laws which infallibly determine\ntheir own application (a view reminiscent of Wittgenstein). But later,\nafter a long and tangled consideration of the question of how it is\npossible for a deductive inference to be reflected in reality, he\ncomes up with a revised account: \u2018Every inference is the ideal\nself-development of an object taken as real\u2019\n(Principles, Terminal Essay I, p. 598). Bradley seems here to\nbe following the Humean idea that there are no logical relations\nbetween distinct existences: the reason that valid inference can be\nreflected in reality is that it can never take one beyond the original\nsubject matter.\n\nMuch of The Principles of Logic is polemical, and it affords\noccasional examples of Bradley at his funniest and most acerbic, such\nas this note to a short chapter criticizing Herbert Spencer\u2019s\nview of the nature of inference (Bk II, Pt II, Ch. II, sec. 14, n.\n3),\n\nWith regard to Mr. Spencer\u2019s view I would suggest, as a\npossibility, that it never was taken from the facts, but was a\ndevelopment of or from something about Comparison which he found in\nHamilton. Reading so few books, Mr. Spencer was naturally more at the\nmercy of those he did read.\n\n\nand this passing swipe at Hamilton himself (Bk II, Pt II, Ch. I, sec.\n9), \n\nThis may be called the law of Redintegration. For we may take this\nname from Sir W. Hamilton (Reid, p. 897), having found\nnothing else that we could well take.\n\n\nIt is clear that much of Bradley\u2019s criticism of his predecessors\nand contemporaries expresses his hostility to the sort of\npsychological atomism evident in extreme form in Hume but equally to\nbe found presupposed in accounts of judgment like those mentioned\nabove. What Bradley particularly objected to about such views is that\nthe particulars (ideas) which they treated as realities in their own\nright, and out of which judgments are said to be composed, are\nanything but: far from being themselves genuine individuals, they are\nabstractions from the continuous whole of psychological life and\nincapable of independent existence. This is an early version of a\nholism which has since had many adherents. But he then goes on to\npoint out that judgments too involve abstractions, since the subject\nmatter of any judgment is necessarily detached from its background\n(as, for example, \u2018Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon\u2019\ndetaches the river from its location and the general from his army)\nand this process inevitably misrepresents the way things really are.\nThus the objections which Bradley deployed against misleading accounts\nof logic now begin to pose a threat against logic itself by eroding\nthe integrity of the judgments which go into its inferences, and he\nends Principles in a sceptical vein by suggesting that no\njudgment is ever really true nor any inference fully valid.\n\nIn addition to his discussion of the nature of ideas, judgment and\nreference, the emphasis he gives to the notion of truth is another\nmain way in which he helped shaping the agenda of later analytic\nphilosophy. At this point Bradley\u2019s attempt to write a book on\nlogic without getting entangled in metaphysics begins to succumb to\nhis doubts about the notion of truth. He holds that logic presupposes\na correspondence theory of truth (he calls it the \u2018copy\u2019\ntheory), but it is apparent that he thinks this theory metaphysically\ninadequate: indeed, he marshals against it counter-examples drawing\non, e.g., disjunctions, counter-examples which had to await the theory\nof truth-functions before they could be accommodated. In Essays on\nTruth and Reality he takes these ideas further, arguing for\n\u2018the identity of truth knowledge and reality\u2019 (p. 113) and\nvehemently rejecting all alternatives, including not solely the\ncopy-theory, but also any understanding of the concept of truth in\nterms of pragmatic success. It could hardly be clearer that Bradley\nholds an identity theory of truth, and although he is commonly\nbelieved to have been a supporter of a coherence theory of truth (and\nis standardly identified as such in the textbooks), this common belief\nis at the very least greatly misleading. However, the combination of\nthe identity theory and his metaphysical doctrine that reality is a\nunified whole enables coherence to be deduced from his views as a\nconsequence, and he himself thought the test of truth to be\n\u2018system\u2019, a notion under which he included what is\ncommonly meant by coherence; this explains why he has so often been\nthought to be a coherence theorist. It might be thought that his\nfamous attack on the Hegelian idea that the rational is the real\n(Principles Bk III, Pt II, Ch. IV, sec. 16) is inconsistent\nwith his holding an identity theory of truth: but the two are\nreconciled through his doctrine of degrees of truth, a doctrine which\nhas to be understood within the context of his metaphysics.\n",
