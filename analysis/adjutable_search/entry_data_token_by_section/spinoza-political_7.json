    "main_text": "The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\n3. The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\n\n\nAs indicated above, throughout the seventeenth century the United\nProvinces were torn apart by disputes concerning, among other things, the\npolitical authority of the church. Spinoza\u2019s Tractatus\nTheologico-Politicus can be seen as an intervention in this broad\ndispute. The stated goals of this work were to parry charges of atheism\n(Spinoza was hilariously unsuccessful in this respect), to oppose the\nprejudices of the theologians, and to defend the freedom to\nphilosophize (Epistle 30). My exposition of the political claims of the\nTTP will focus on the last two goals. Specifically, I will look at the\npolitical significance of Spinoza\u2019s critique of superstition and\nconsider his arguments for the freedom of philosophizing. This will be\nfollowed by an analysis of the role of the social contract in the\nTTP.\n",
