    "main_text": "\n\nThis essay focuses on personal love, or the love of particular persons\nas such. Part of the philosophical task in understanding personal love\nis to distinguish the various kinds of personal love. For example, the\nway in which I love my wife is seemingly very different from the way I\nlove my mother, my child, and my friend. This task has typically\nproceeded hand-in-hand with philosophical analyses of these kinds of\npersonal love, analyses that in part respond to various puzzles about\nlove. Can love be justified? If so, how? What is the value of personal\nlove? What impact does love have on the autonomy of both the lover and\nthe beloved?\n",
