Typically this is an indifference to praise, the high\nranking relative to others, or positive evaluation by others. Schueler\n(1997), for example, sees modesty as being indifferent to being\nevaluated highly on the basis of one\u2019s good qualities. Though he\nassumes that the modest person will have an accurate self-image, this\nis not entailed by his account. A similar account is given by Arpaly\nand Schroeder (2014, 245\u2013250) who see being modest as not caring about\nhow you are ranked relative to others. Often, they note, this will have\nignorance as a side effect, but what is essential to modesty is a kind\nof indifference.\n\n\nRoberts and Wood (2003) give a similar account of humility, opposing\nit to the vices of vanity and arrogance. For them, lacking vanity means\nbeing unconcerned with the opinions of others and lacking arrogance\nmeans being unconcerned with entitlements that come along with social\nrecognition of good qualities. Again, this is not doxastic but instead\ndiscussed as a kind of emotional insensitivity (2003, 261).\n\n\nThough not explicitly discussing modesty or humility, many Buddhist\nthinkers defend virtues rooted in a similar kind of indifference. To\noppose pride or arrogance (Sanskrit m\u0101na), Buddhist\nthinkers often advocate for a kind of equanimity that involves a kind\nof indifference to external resentment and approval as it counteracts\nforms of self-attachment that are thought to produce suffering. See\nBuddhaghosa\u2019s Path of Purification IX.91, chapter seven\nof \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s Training Anthology, and the\ndiscussion in McRae (2013 and 2016, 101ff.).\n",
