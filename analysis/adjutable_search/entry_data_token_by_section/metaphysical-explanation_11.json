    "main_text": "The scope of metaphysical explanation || Metaphysical explanation outside of metaphysics\n7.2 Do all facts admit of metaphysical explanation, or none?\n\nAbstracting from specific putative applications of metaphysical\nexplanation outside of metaphysics proper, can one say in more general\nterms what the extent of metaphysical explanation is? On one extreme,\nproponents of the famous\n \u201cprinciple of sufficient reason\u201d\n contend that everything (or\neverything of a certain sort, e.g., contingent facts) has an\nexplanation of some form or other, and Dasgupta (2016) has prominently\ndeveloped a version of the principle regarding metaphysical\nexplanation, specifically grounding explanation on his view.\nNotably, Dasgupta distinguishes between two ways that metaphysical\nexplanation might be limited in extent. Call a substantive\nfact one that is \u201capt for being grounded\u201d, in the sense\nthat\n\n\nthe question of what grounds it can legitimately be raised and admits\nof a sensible answer (an answer that either states its ground or else\nstates that it has none),\n\n\nand call a fact autonomous just in case it is not\nsubstantive, and thus is one for which \u201cthe question of why it\nobtains does not legitimately arise\u201d (2016: 383).\nDasgupta\u2019s version of the PSR is then the claim that\n\u201cevery substantive fact has an autonomous ground\u201d\n(2016: 84).\n\nBroadening Dasgupta\u2019s distinction, there are two questions about\nthe scope of metaphysical explanation to consider. First, which (types\nof) facts have metaphysical explanations\u2014all, none, or something\nin the middle? Second, of those that lack metaphysical explanations,\nwhich (types of) facts are not apt to be metaphysically explained at\nall? Dasgupta suggests that facts about essence are autonomous facts\n(2016: 385). Other philosophers have challenged the idea that facts\nabout essences are ungrounded, and so have opened the door to facts\nregarding essences having metaphysical explanations (see Tillman 2016,\nGlazier 2017, Raven 2021).\n\nOn the other extreme, one might maintain that no fact is apt to be\nmetaphysically explained. One type of worry is that notions thought by\nsome to be constitutive of metaphysical explanation, such as grounding\nand essence, are somehow defective (see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding \u00a78\n and the entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties \u00a75).\n Another type of worry is that metaphysical explanations would compete\nwith scientific, mathematical, and/or other forms of explanation in a\nmanner that render metaphysical explanations objectionably\nsuperfluous. Jeff Engelhardt (2016) develops this line of thought and\nargues that many philosophers are implicitly committed to an\nobjectionable sort of overdetermination involving metaphysical\nexplanation. The sort of overdetermination he has in mind regards\ncases where something seems to have a sufficient causal explanation as\nwell as a sufficient metaphysical explanation. For example, for any\ngiven house, that house exists both because it was caused to exist\n(causal explanation), as well as because it is grounded in its parts\n(metaphysical explanation). Perhaps the best solution to the problem\nwhich we can come up with, Engelhardt suggests, is that in cases such\nas this one the cause in question (C) causes the grounds of\nthe house to obtain, but C does not cause the house to exist.\nIn this case, while C does explain why the house exists, it\ndoes not causally explain why the house exists. Rather,\nC causally explains why the parts of the house are configured\nin such-and-such a manner, and those parts being configured in that\nmanner in turn grounds the existence of the house.\n",
