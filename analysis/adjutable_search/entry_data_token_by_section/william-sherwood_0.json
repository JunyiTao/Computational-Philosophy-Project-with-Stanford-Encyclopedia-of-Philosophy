    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nWilliam of Sherwood was born between 1200 and 1205, probably in\nNottinghamshire, and died between 1266 and 1272. His school career is\nuncertain, but given references to his works and his influence on\npeople such as Peter of Spain, Lambert of Auxerre, Albert the Great,\nand Thomas Aquinas, it is likely that he was teaching logic at the\nUniversity of Paris between 1235 and 1250. After that period, he seems\nto have left logic. He was a master at Oxford in 1252 and treasurer of\nthe cathedral of Lincoln about two years later; still later, he was\nrector at Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, and Attleborough, in Norfolk.\nHe was still alive in 1266 but dead by 1272 (Kretzmann 1968, p.\n3).\n\nPart of the difficulty with establishing his biography is that he has\npreviously been conflated with various other 13th-century Englishmen\nnamed William, such as William of Leicester (d. 1213) and William of\nDurham (d. 1249) (cf. Grabmann 1937, pp. 11\u201313; Kretzmann 1966, p. 3;\nMullinger 1873, p. 177). He has also sometimes been identified with\nothers bearing the same surname, such as the author of commentary, now\nlost, on the Sentences of Peter Lombard with the title\nShirovodus super sententias, a work that was known to John\nLeland in the 16th century (Kretzmann 1966, p. 12), or Ricardus de\nSchirewode, who wrote a treatise on insolubles surviving in Cambridge,\nSt John\u2019s MS 100. This confusion, along with the usual problems\npresented by anonymous material, makes it difficult to identify\nWilliam\u2019s works with certainty.\n\nTwo works can be confidently ascribed to Sherwood, an Introduction\nto Logic and a treatise on syncategorematic terms, the\nSyncategoremata. The Introduction survives in complete\nform in only one manuscript, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale MS. Lat.\n16,617, from the late 13th or 14th century, which begins with the\nheading Introductiones Magistri Guilli. de Shyreswode in\nlogicam, \u201cIntroduction to Logic of Master William of\nSherwood\u201d. The Syncategoremata immediately follows, and\nis likewise explicitly attributed to Sherwood. The\nSyncategoremata also survives in a second manuscript, Bodleian\nMS Digby 55, where it is again explicitly labeled, Sincategoreumata\nMagistri Willielmi de Sirewode \u201c[Treatise on]\nSyncategorematics of Master William of Sherwood\u201d, and Chapter\nFive of the Introduction survives in a second manuscript, MS\nWorcester Cath. Q. 13, written around 1293/94, and edited by Pinborg\n& Ebbesen (1984).\n\nThe Introduction was almost certainly written while William was\nlecturing on logic at the University of Paris. It was first edited by\nGrabmann (1937) and translated into English by Kretzmann (1966). A new\ncritical edition was produced by Brands and Kann (1995), accompanied\nby a translation into German. It has been argued (Mullinger 1873, p.\n177) that this book was heavily influenced by a Synopsis\ntreatise written by the 11th-century Byzantine logician Michael\nConstantine Psellus. The Introduction contains the first\nappearance of the syllogistic mnemonic verse \u2018Barbara,\nCelarent\u2026\u2019, which Augustus de Morgan described as \u201cmagic\nwords \u2026 more full of meaning than any that ever were made\u201d, and\nSherwood may even have been the inventor of the verse, though\nreferences to individual names appear earlier (Kretzmann 1966, pp.\n66\u201367).\n\nSherwood\u2019s treatise on syncategorematic terms has long been held to be\nif not the earliest such treatise, then the earliest still accessible\n(Boehner 1952, p. 7). The text was first edited by O\u2019Donnell (1941),\nand this edition along with the Paris MS was the basis of Kretzmann\u2019s\n1968 translation into English. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s edition has since been\nsuperseded by the critical edition of Kann and Kirchhoff (2012), which\nalso includes a translation into German.  Kirchhoff (2008) is an extensive discussion and commentary on the Syncategormeta.\n\nThree other logical treatises follow the Introductiones and the\nSyncategoremata in the Paris manuscript, which have as a result\nbeen tentatively attributed to Sherwood. The first is a treatise on\ninsolubles, ff. 46\u201354, edited by Roure (1970), and the second a\ntreatise on obligationes found in Paris, Bibl. Nat. 16617. This\ntext was edited by Green (1963), who tentatively attributed it to\nSherwood. The third is the text Petitiones Contrariorum, edited\nby de Rijk (1976), covering puzzles arising from hidden contradictions\nin sets of premises. Sherwood may also be the author of the\nFallaciae magistri Willelmi \u201cFallacies, of Master\nWilliam\u201d preserved in British Museum, King\u2019s Library MS 9 E XII,\nas well as the treatise ascribed to Richard of Sherwood noted\nabove.\n\nThree further treatises have previously also been attributed to\nSherwood, but the evidence for their attribution is less clear: the\ncommentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard noted above, a\nDistictiones theologicae, and a Concionces, or\ncollection of sermons (Kretzmann 1968, p. 4).\n",
