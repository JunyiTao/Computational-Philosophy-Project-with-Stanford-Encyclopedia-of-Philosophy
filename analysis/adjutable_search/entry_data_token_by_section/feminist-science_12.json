    "main_text": "Queer Science Studies and the New Materialisms || The New Materialisms\n5.2 The New Materialisms\n\nMuch of the feminist work discussed thus far has focused on how the\nworld is conceptualized\u2014that is, various different ways of\nrepresenting what is studied and the effects of these different\nrepresentations. The new materialisms challenge this emphasis on\nrepresentation, arguing that it treats matter as passive and that this\nsort of analysis is not sufficiently attentive to the material aspects\nof embodiment. As Pitts-Taylor puts it, \u201cmatter matters\u201d.\nAs part of the corrective she proposes that science studies take the\nfollowing steps\u2014some of which we have already seen in some of\nthe feminist work discussed. The first is breaking down the\ndistinction between the social and biological by recognizing how they\nare intertwined. The second involves documenting the way the\nbiological can be shaped by human needs which are in turn shaped\nthrough modes of power. Finally, she proposes rejecting dominant\ndualisms of the sort that queer science studies challenges\n(Pitts-Taylor 2016b: 1).\n\nAlthough Pitts-Taylor recognizes these moves may grow out of feminist\napproaches to science, the new materialisms are also critical of some\nfeminist thinking about science, claiming that science is too often\nrecognized as an instrument of oppression, but not engaged with\nsufficiently to support the development of feminist science. The new\nmaterialisms note that this is particularly true of feminism\u2019s\nlack of engagement with the physical sciences\u2014those areas of\nscience concerned with the basics of matter.\n\nKaren Barad\u2019s work seeks to correct this, developing a view that\nshe calls it \u201cagential realism\u201d. For Barad, \n\n\nphenomena are not the mere result of laboratory exercises engineered\nby human subjects; rather, phenomena are differential patterns of\nmattering (\u201cdiffraction patterns\u201d) produced through\ncomplex agential intra-actions of multiple material-discursive\npractices\u2026. (emphasis in the original). \n\n\nSuch patterns may or may not involve humans, however these practices\nconstitute \u201cboundaries between humans and nonhumans, culture and\nnature, science and the social\u201d (Barad 2007: 140).\n\nBarad\u2019s metaphor of \u201cdiffraction patterns\u201d is taken\nfrom Donna Haraway (see particularly Haraway 1992), who proposed\ndiffraction as an alternative to the metaphor of reflection. While\nboth are optical metaphors, Barad notes that reflection emphasizes\nsameness and so evokes essentialism\u2014the discovery of what is the\nsame in what is under investigation. Diffraction is about differences\nand moves the researcher towards tracing the histories of these\ndifferences, rather than fitting them into preconceived binaries\n(Barad 2007: 29\u201330). Barad describes this process of knowing the\nmaterial world as \u201cintra-action\u201d rather than interaction.\nIn doing so, she emphasizes that agency is not an\nattribute\u2014something that someone has\u2014but rather is the\ninvolvement in the iterative practices that constitute materiality\n(Barad 2007: 178). For Barad this intra-action entails the\ninseparability of science, ontology, epistemology, and ethics and\nhence the pun on \u201cmatter\u201d that runs throughout the new\nmaterialism. Our practices matter both in the sense of making a\ndifference and in the sense of being involved in the configuring and\nreconfiguring of the material world.\n",
