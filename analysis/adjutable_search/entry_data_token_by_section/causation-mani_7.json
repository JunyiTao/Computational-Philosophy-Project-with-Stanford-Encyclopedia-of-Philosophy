    "main_text": "Interventions and Counterfactuals\n9. Interventions and Counterfactuals\n\nWe noted above that interventionist versions of manipulability\ntheories are counterfactual theories. What is the relationship between\nsuch theories and more familiar versions of counterfactual theories\nsuch as the theory of David Lewis? Lewis\u2019 theory is an account\nof what it is for one individual token event to cause another while,\nas explained above, versions of interventionist treatments are\navailable for different sorts of type causal claims as well as token\ncausal claims. But if we abstract away from this, there are both\nimportant similarities and important differences between the two\napproaches. As readers of Lewis will be aware, any counterfactual\ntheory must explain what we should envision as changed and what should\nbe held fixed when we evaluate a counterfactual the antecedent of\nwhich is not true of the actual world\u2014within Lewis\u2019\nframework, this is the issue of which worlds in which the antecedent\nof the counterfactual holds are \u201cclosest\u201d or \u201cmost\nsimilar\u201d to the actual world. Lewis\u2019 answer to this\nquestion invokes a \u201csimilarity\u201d ordering that ranks the\nimportance of various respects of resemblance between worlds in\nassessing overall similarity. (Lewis 1979). For example, avoiding\ndiverse, widespread violations of law is said to be the most important\nconsideration, preserving perfect match of particular fact over the\nlargest possible spatio-temporal region is next in importance and more\nimportant than avoiding small localized violations of law, and so on.\nAs is well-known the effect of this similarity ordering is, at least\nin most situations, to rule out so-called \u201cback-tracking\u201d\ncounterfactuals (e.g., the sort of counterfactual that is involved in\nreasoning that if the effect of some cause had not occurred, then the\ncause would not have occurred). When the antecedent of a\ncounterfactual is not true of the actual world, Lewis\u2019\nsimilarity metric commonly leads us (at least in deterministic\ncontexts) to think of that antecedent as made true by a\n\u201csmall\u201d miracle.\n\nThe notion of an intervention plays a somewhat (but only somewhat)\nsimilar role within manipulability theories of causation to\nLewis\u2019 similarity ordering. Like Lewis\u2019 ordering, the\ncharacterization of an intervention tells us what should be envisioned\nas changed and what should be held fixed when we evaluate the sorts of\ncounterfactuals that are relevant to elucidating causal claims. For\nexample, on Pearl\u2019s understanding of an intervention, in\nevaluating an interventionist counterfactual like \u201cIf \\(X\\) were\nto be set by an intervention to such and such a value, the value of\n\\(Y\\) would be so and so\u201d, we are to consider a situation in\nwhich the previously existing causal relationship between \\(X\\) and\nits causes is disrupted, but all other causal relationships in the\nsystem of interest are left unchanged. A moment\u2019s thought will\nalso show that, as in Lewis\u2019 account, both Pearl\u2019s (in its\nsetting version) and the characterization of interventions in terms of\n M1\u2013M4\n rule out backtracking counterfactuals\u2014for example, in\nevaluating a counterfactual of the form \u201cif an intervention were\nto occur that changes \\(E\\), (where \\(E\\) is an effect of \\(C)\\), then\n\\(C\\) would change\u201d, Pearl holds that we should consider a\nsituation in which the relationship between \\(E\\) and its causes (in\nthis case, \\(C)\\) is disrupted, but all other causal relationships are\nleft unchanged, so that \\(C\\) still occurs, and the above\ncounterfactual is false, as it should be. Moreover, there is a clear\nsimilarity between Lewis\u2019 idea that the appropriate\ncounterfactuals for analyzing causation are often counterfactuals the\nantecedents of which are made true by \u201cmiracles\u201d, and the\nidea of an intervention as an exogenous change that disrupts the\nmechanism that was previously responsible for the cause event\nC\u2014both of these notions function so as to provide \\(C\\)\nwith the kind of \u201cindependent causal history\u201d (recall\nMenzies and Price) that allows us to distinguish the effects (if any)\nof \\(C\\) on \\(E\\) from the effects of other \u201cconfounding\u201d\nvariables on \\(E\\). From this perspective, one might think of an\ninterventionist treatment of causation as explaining why Lewis\u2019\naccount, with its somewhat ad hoc looking similarity\nordering, works as well as it does\u2014Lewis\u2019 account works\nbecause his similarity ordering picks out roughly those relationships\nthat are stable under interventions and hence exploitable for purposes\nof manipulation and control and, as a manipulability theory claims, it\nis just these relationships that are causal.\n\nAs noted above, however, this is not to say that the two\napproaches are identical or always yield identical assessments of\nparticular causal and counterfactual claims. One central difference is\nthat Lewis\u2019 account is reductionist in aspiration\u2014the\nelements that go into his similarity metric (avoidance of big\nmiracles, perfect match of particular facts etc.) are (at least\nofficially) characterized in non-causal, non-modal terms. By contrast,\nas explained above, the notion of an intervention and the standards\nfor evaluating counterfactuals to which it gives rise are\ncharacterized in causal terms, so that the resulting account is\nnon-reductionist.\n\nThere are other differences as well, a number of which are explored in\nan important paper by Briggs (2012). We have already noted that strong\ncentering holds in Lewis\u2019 semantics but not for counterfactuals\nwith an interventionist interpretation. In addition, the inference\nfrom (i) \u201cif \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) were the case, \\(r\\) would be the\ncase\u201d to (ii) \u201cif \\(p\\) were the case, \\(r\\) would be the\ncase\u201d is invalid within Lewis\u2019 semantics but valid if\nthese counterfactuals are given an interventionist interpretation\n(Briggs 2012; Fine 2012). Very roughly this is because within an\ninterventionist framework, (i) is interpreted as claiming that for any\nrealization of its antedent-- either p or q--\nr will follow. It is arguable that in each of these cases,\nthe assessments provided by the interventionist interpretation are\ncorrect, assuming that what we want to capture are those\ncounterfactuals that behave in a way that is appropriate for causal\ninterpretation. In addition, Woodward 2003 describes several specific\nexamples in which the two approaches diverge in their judgments about\nwhich causal relations are present and in which the interventionist\napproach seems more\n satisfactory.[3]\n10. Possible and Impossible Interventions\n\nIn the versions of a manipulability theory considered under\n \u00a75ff\n above, causal claims are elucidated in terms of counterfactuals about\nwhat would happen under interventions. As we have seen, the notion of\nan intervention should be understood without reference to human\naction, and this permits formulation of a manipulability theory that\napplies to causal claims in situations in which manipulation by human\nbeings is not a practical possibility.\n\nHowever, as already intimated, interesting questions arise about how\nfar this framework may be extended to other sorts of cases in which\ninterventions are not \u201cpossible\u201d. These also illustrate\nsome additional differences between thinking of interventions as\nsetting or, alternatively, in terms of\n M1\u2013M4\n and as possibility constrained. Consider the (presumably true) causal\nclaim\n (G):\n\n(G) The\ngravitational attraction of the moon causes the motion of the\ntides.\n\n\nWithin Pearl\u2019s framework and using the notion of a setting\nintervention, it might be argued that there is no problem with\ncapturing claims like (G), at least if we assume (as we did above)\nthat the relevant setting operation is always \u201cpossible\u201d\nor legitimate: we just imagine the gravitational attraction of the\nmoon set to some different value via a setting intervention (we\ndon\u2019t need to specify how this comes about\u2014whether the\nmass of the moon or its distance from the earth etc. is different) and\nthen note (by applying Newtonian gravitational theory) that the motion\nof the tides would be\n different.[4]\n\nSuppose, by contrast, we require that interventions be\n\u201cpossible\u201d in some more demanding sense (that is, we adopt\na notion of possibility constrained intervention) and we consider\ncounterfactuals of the form: \u201cif an intervention meeting\n M1\u2013M4\n were to occur that sets the gravitational attraction of the moon to a\ndifferent value, then\u2026\u201d. It may well be that there is no\nphysically possible process that will meet the conditions\n M1\u2013M4\n for intervention on the moon\u2019s position with respect to the\ntides\u2014all possible processes that would alter the gravitational\nforce exerted by the moon may be insufficiently\n\u201csurgical\u201d. For example, it may very well be that any\npossible process that alters the position of the moon by altering the\nposition of some other massive object will have an independent impact\non the tides in violation of condition\n (M2)\n for an intervention. Woodward (2003) argues that nonetheless we have\na principled basis in Newtonian mechanics and gravitational theory\nthemselves for answering questions about what would happen if such a\nsurgical intervention were to occur and that this is enough to\nvindicate the causal claim\n (G).\n On this view of the matter, what is crucial is not whether the\nantecedent of the relevant counterfactual is nomologically or\nphysically possible but rather whether we are in possession of\nwell-grounded scientific theories and accompanying mathematics that\nallow us to reliably answer questions about what would happen under\nthe supposition of such antecedents. We count interventions as\n\u201cpossible\u201d as long as this is the case. Such interventions\nshould be distinguished from interventions that are logically,\nconceptually or mathematically inconsistent or incoherent (see below\nfor additional illustrations).\n11. The Scope of Interventionist Accounts\n\nOne context in which issues about the range of cases in which\ninterventionist account may be legitimately or fruitfully applied\nconcerns \u201ccosmological\u201d claims in which fundamental\nphysical theories are understood as applying to the whole universe.\nConsider the following claim\n\n(4) The\nstate \\(S_t\\) of the entire universe at time \\(t\\) causes the state\n\\(S_{t +d}\\) of the entire universe at time \\(t+d\\), where \\(S_t\\) and\n\\(S_{t+d}\\) are specifications in terms of some fundamental physical\ntheory.\n\n\nOn an interventionist construal,\n (4)\n is unpacked as a claim to the effect that under some possible\nintervention that changes \\(S_t\\), there would be an associated change\nin \\(S_{t+d}\\). This raises the worry that it is unclear what would be\ninvolved in such an intervention (given that there is nothing in\naddition to \\(S_t\\) that might realize the intervention) and unclear\nhow to assess what would happen if it were to occur, given the\nstipulation that \\(S_t\\) is a specification of the entire state of the\nuniverse.\n\nCommenting on an example like this, Pearl writes:\n\n\nIf you wish to include the whole universe in the model, causality\ndisappears because interventions disappear\u2014the manipulator and\nthe manipulated lose their distinction. (2009: 419-20)\n\n\nNote that here Pearl seems to invoke a notion of intervention that is\ndifferent from (and stronger than) a pure setting conception. After\nall, as Reutlinger (2012) notes, it is arguable that there is no\nproblem about imagining the state of the universe at \\(S_t\\) set to\nsome different value and then determining by reference to the laws\ngoverning its evolution what its state will be at \\(S_{t\n +1}\\).[5]\n Pearl\u2019s remark seems to assume that the imagined intervention\nhas to meet some additional constraint beyond this (having to do in\nsome way with the possibility of realizing the intervention).\nPearl\u2019s claim is controversial\u2014it is discussed\nsympathetically by Hitchcock 2007b and Woodward 2007 and criticized by\nother writers such as Reutlinger 2012.\n\nWe will not try to resolve the issues surrounding this particular\nclaim of Pearl\u2019s here, but there is a related and more general\nissue concerning the implications of interventionism for the status of\ncausal claims in physics, even outside of cosmological contexts, that\ndeserves discussion. Return to the contrast between explicating causal\nclaims by appealing to a pure setting notion of intervention and,\nalternatively, explicating them by reference to interventions that\nmeet some further non-trivial constraints regarding possibility, as\ndiscussed above. Consider cases in which there is a physical law\naccording to which there is counterfactual dependence between \\(Y\\)\nand \\(X\\) but interventions on \\(X\\) are in some appropriately\nrelevant sense impossible. A pure setting treatment may conclude that\nsuch relationships are causal while an account relying on a\npossibility constrained notion of intervention will not.\n\nTwo possible illustrations are discussed in Woodward (2016). The field\nequations of General Relativity describe a lawful or nomological\nrelationship between the stress energy tensor and the spacetime\nmetric. \u201cSetting\u201d the former to different values (by\nspecifying initial and boundary conditions) one may calculate the\nassociated different values of the latter. One may doubt, however,\nthat it is appropriate to think of the field equations as describing a\ncausal relationship between the stress-energy tensor and the\nmetric. It is arguable that a possibility constrained interventionist\naccount supports this judgment: specification of the stress energy\ntensor requires reference to the metric in such a way that\ninterventions on the former with respect to the latter will violate\nthe conditions\n M1\u2013M4\n for an intervention. One might conclude on these grounds that\nalthough there is a relation of nomic dependence between the state of\nthe stress energy tensor and the metric, this relation is not causal.\nEmployment of a setting conception of intervention seems to realize\nthe opposite conclusion.\n\nAs a second example, the spins of the entangled particles in an\nEPR\u2013type experiment are lawfully related by a conservation law.\nIt is arguable (cf. Skyrms 1984; Butterfield 1992) that many standard\nphilosophical theories, including regularity and Lewis-style\ncounterfactual theories treat this relationship as causal, and a\nsetting version of an interventionist theory seems to suggest a\nsimilar conclusion. By contrast, various no signaling theorems are\ncommonly interpreted as implying that it is impossible both to\nintervene on one of the separated spin settings and to use the\nrelationship between the two settings to manipulate the other setting.\nIn this case a possibility constrained version of interventionism can\njudge that no causal relationship is present. Although the matter is\ncontroversial among philosophers, most physicists agree with this\njudgment of non-causality.\n\nBoth of these examples illustrate different implications of setting\nand possibility constrained versions of interventionism in physics\ncontexts and how the latter framework requires more than just the\npresence of a nomically sufficient condition or law-based\ncounterfactual dependence for causation. More generally, if one\nthinks, as many philosophers of physics and some physicists do, that\ncausal concepts do not apply, at least in any straightforward way, to\nsome or many fundamental physics contexts, then it is arguably a\nconsideration in favor of a version of interventionism that imposes a\nnon-trivial possibility constraint that it might be used to support\nthis judgment. By contrast, a setting version of interventionism will\ntend to find causation in physics whenever there is nomic\ndependence.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion recently both about the extent\nto which fundamental physics is causal and about what interventionist\nframeworks imply about the status of causal claims in physics. A\nnumber of the essays in Price and Corry 2007 (Price 2007; Hitchcock\n2007b; Woodward 2007) express varying degrees of skepticism about the\napplicability of causal notions in portions of physics, in part on the\nbasis of interventionist considerations. By contrast, Frisch (2014)\nargues vigorously that many physical theories, at least in classical\nphysics, such as classical electromagnetism, make extensive use of\ncausal concepts and that the relevant notion of cause is captured by\nthe interventionist framework and associated technical ideas (such as\nstructural equations and directed graphs). He suggests that writers\nlike Price, Hitchcock, and Woodward (in his 2007 but see his 2016 for\na more nuanced view) underestimate the degree to which interventionist\nideas of causation are applicable to such contexts. Of course it is\nalso possible, consistently, with the views of both Frisch and these\nother writers, that causal notions, understood along possibility\nconstrained interventionist lines, are important in many areas of\nphysics but that there are other physical theories that are not\nfruitfully interpreted as making causal claims, whether understood\nalong interventionist or other lines. In any case, the question of the\nscope of interventionist theories and their implications for causal\nclaims in fundamental physics is an important and at present\nunresolved\n issue.[6]\n12. (Alleged) Causes That Are Unmanipulable for Logical, Conceptual, or Metaphysical Reasons\n\nSeveral statisticians (e.g., Holland 1986; Rubin 1986), as well as\nsimilarly minded epidemiologists (e.g., Hernan and Taubman 2008) who\nadvocate treatments of causation in terms of manipulation-based ideas\n(in this case in terms of \u201cpotential outcome\u201d theory) have\nheld that causal claims involving causes that are unmanipulable in\nprinciple are defective or lack a clear meaning\u2014they think of\nthis conclusion as following directly from a manipulationist approach\nto causation. What is meant by an unmanipulable cause is not made very\nclear, but what these authors have in mind are not candidate causes\nthat cannot be manipulated as a practical matter, but rather\ncandidates that are such that we lack any clear conception of what\nwould be involved in manipulating them or any basis for assessing what\nwould happen under such manipulations\u2014cases in which\nmanipulation seems \u201cimpossible\u201d for conceptual or (if you\nlike) \u201cmetaphysical\u201d reasons. Proposed examples include\nsuch candidate causes as race, membership in a particular species, and\ngender. Other examples discussed in this connection involve cases in\nwhich there are many different things one might have in mind by\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d of the candidate causes with different\nresults flowing from alternative understandings of\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d so that the claims in question are taken,\nfrom a manipulationist or interventionist standpoint, to be unclear or\nambiguous. All such cases contrast with the case involving\n (G)\n above, where the notion of manipulating the moon\u2019s orbit seems\nperfectly clear and well-defined, and the problem is simply that the\nworld happens to be arranged in such a way that an intervention that\nproduces such a change is not physically possible.\n\nA sympathetic reconstruction of the position under discussion might go\nas follows. On an interventionist account of causation, causes\n(whether we think of them as events, types of events, properties,\nfacts, or what have you) must be representable by means of\nvariables\u2014where this means, at a minimum, that it must\nbe possible for the cause to change or to assume different values, for\nwhatever object, unit or system those values are assigned to, as when\nit is possible for the same particle to be either at position \\(p_1\\)\nspecified by a position variable \\(P\\) or at some alternative position\n\\(p_2\\). This is required if we are to have a well-defined notion of\nmanipulating a candidate cause and well-defined answers to\ncounterfactual queries about what would happen if the cause were to be\nmanipulated in some way\u2014matters which are central to what causal\nclaims mean on any version of a manipulability theory worthy of the\nname. However, for some putative causes, there may be no well-defined\nnotion of change or variation in value and if so, a manipulability\ntheory will not count these as genuine causes. Suppose, for example,\nwe lack any coherent conception of what it is for something to exist\nbut to be non-physical. Then there will be no well-defined notion of\nintervening to change whether something is or is not a physical object\nand being a physical object will not be a factor or property that can\nserve as a cause. (Of course it is consistent with this that there are\ntrue and perhaps even lawful generalizations about all physical\nobjects.) For example, although to the best of our knowledge, it is a\nlaw of nature that\n\n(L) no physical object\ncan be accelerated from a velocity less than that of light to a\nvelocity greater than light,\n\n\n(L) is not, according to this version of a manipulability theory, a\ncausal generalization: being a physical object is not a cause\nof the incapacity in question.\n\nMoreover, even with respect to variables that can take more than one\nvalue, the notion of an intervention or manipulation will not be\nwell-defined if there is no well-defined notion of changing\nthe values of that variable. Suppose that we introduce a variable\n\u201canimal\u201d which takes the values \\(\\{\\)lizard, kitten,\nraven\\(\\}\\). By construction, this variable has more than one value,\nbut if, as seems plausible, we have no coherent idea of what it is to\nchange a raven into lizard or kitten, there will be no well-defined\nnotion of an intervention for this variable and being an animal (or\nbeing a raven) will not be the sort of thing that can count as a\nbona fide cause on a manipulability theory. The notion of\nchanging the value of a variable seems to involve the idea of an\nalteration from one value of the variable to another in circumstances\nin which the very same system or entity can possess both values and\nthis notion seems inapplicable to the case under discussion.\n\nNote that, just as with some of the examples considered in\n \u00a712,\n this conclusion does not seem to follow on the pure setting\ninterpretation of the interventionist account. One can, after all, set\nup an equation \\(Y = X\\) with a candidate variable \\(X\\), taking the\nvalues 0 and 1, according to whether some object is a kitten or lizard\nand a candidate effect variable \\(Y\\), taking the values 0 and 1\naccording to whether that object is warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Then\nsetting \\(X\\) to 0 rather than 1 changes whether \\(Y= 0\\) or 1, and if\nthis is sufficient for causation, being a kitten rather than a lizard\ncauses warmbloodiness rather than coldbloodiness. If one thinks, that\nthere is something defective or problematic about these causal claims,\nthis requires, within an interventionist framework, a richer\nconception of what is required for causation than what is suggested by\nthe setting conception of intervention. A similar point applies to the\nother examples described in this section.\n\nSome readers will take it to be intuitively obvious that, e.g., being\na raven can be a cause of some particular organism\u2019s being\nblack, that being a kitten can be a cause of warm-bloodiness and so\non. If causal claims like\n\n(R) \u201cRaveness\ncauses blackness\u201d \n\n\nare true, it will be an important advantage of a setting version of\ninterventionism over a formulation in terms of a possibility\nconstrained notion of intervention that the former but not the latter\nis able to capture claims like (R). By contrast, others will think\nthat claims like (R) are, if not false, at least unclear and\nunperspicuous, and that it is a point in favor of a possibility\nconstrained version of the interventionist account that it can capture\nthis. Those who take this second view will think that claims like (R)\nshould be replaced by claims that involve causes that are\nstraightforwardly manipulable. For example, (R) might be replaced by a\nclaim that identified the genetic factors and biochemical pathways\nthat are responsible for raven pigmentation\u2014factors and pathways\nfor which there is a well-defined notion of manipulation and which are\nsuch that if they were appropriately manipulated, this would lead to\nchanges in pigmentation. Theorists like Rubin and Holland will think\nthat such a replacement would be clearer and more perspicuous than the\noriginal claim (R). Another illustration of this general idea that\nreplacing claims involving non-manipulable candidate causes with\nclaims involving candidate manipulable causes clarifies their meaning\nis discussed in\n The Role of the Manipulability Theory in Clarifying Causal Claims.\n13. Some Criticisms of Interventionist Accounts\n\nA number of other criticisms besides the classic charges of\nanthropomorphism and circularity have been advanced against\ninterventionist accounts. One complaint is that interventionist\naccounts (at least as I have formulated them) appeal to\ncounterfactuals and that counterfactuals cannot be (as it is often\nput) \u201cbarely true\u201d: if a counterfactual is true, this must\nbe so in virtue of some \u201ctruth maker\u201d which is not itself\nmodal or counterfactual. Standard candidates for such truth makers are\nfundamental laws of nature or perhaps fundamental physical/chemical\nprocesses or mechanisms. Often the further suggestion is made that we\ncan then explain the notion of causation in terms of such truth makers\nrather than along interventionist lines\u2014for example, the notion\nof causation (as well as the truth conditions for counterfactuals)\nmight be explained in terms of laws (Hiddleston 2005). Thus appealing\nto interventionist counterfactuals is not necessary, once we take\naccount of the truth conditions of such counterfactuals.\n\nThese claims raise a number of issues that can be explored only\nbriefly. First, let us distinguish between providing an ordinary\nscientific explanation for why some counterfactual claim is true and\nproviding truth conditions (or identifying a truth maker) in the sense\ndescribed above, where these truth conditions are specified in\nnon-modal, non-counterfactual terms. The expectation that (i) whenever\nsome macro-level interventionist counterfactual is true, there will be\nsome more fundamental scientific explanation of why it is true seems\nplausible and well grounded in scientific practice. By contrast, the\nexpectation that (ii) for every true counterfactual there must be a\ntruth maker that can be characterized in non-modal, non-counterfactual\nterms is a metaphysical doctrine that requires some independent\nargument; it does not follow just from (i). Suppose that it is true\nthat\n\n(5) if\nsubjects with disease \\(D\\) were to be assigned treatment via an\nintervention with drug \\(G\\), they would be more likely to recover.\n\n\n\nThen it is very plausible that there will be some explanation, which\nmay or may not be known at present, that explains why\n (5)\n is true in terms of more fundamental biochemical mechanisms or\nphysical/chemical laws and various initial and boundary conditions.\nWhat is less obviously correct is the further idea that we can\nelucidate these underlying mechanisms/laws without appealing to\ncounterfactuals. It is this further idea that is appealed to when it\nis claimed that it must be possible to describe a truth maker for a\ncounterfactual like\n (5)\n that does not itself appeal to counterfactual or modal claims. The\ncorrectness of this idea is not guaranteed merely by the existence of\nan explanation in the ordinary sense for why\n (5)\n is true; instead it seems to depend on whether a reductivist account\nof laws, mechanisms, etc. in terms of non-modal primitives can be\ngiven\u2014a matter on which the jury is still\n out.[7]\n\nA different line of criticism has been advanced against\ninterventionist accounts in several recent papers by Nancy Cartwright\n(e.g., 2001, 2002). According to Cartwright such accounts are\n\u201coperationalist\u201d. Classical operationalism is often\ncriticized as singling out just one possible procedure for testing\nsome claim of interest and contending that the claim only makes sense\nor only has a truth value when that procedure can actually be carried\nout. Similarly, Cartwright complains that the interventionist account\n\u201coverlooks the possibility of devising other methods for\nmeasuring\u201d causal relationships and also suggests that the\naccount leads us to\n\n\nwithhold the concept [of cause] from situations that seem the same in\nall other aspects relevant to its application just because our test\ncannot be applied in those situations. (2002: 422)\n\n\nIf interventionism is formulated as above, this criticism seems\nmisplaced. The interventionist account does not hold that causal\nconcepts apply or make sense only when the appropriate interventions\ncan actually be carried out. Nor does it deny that there are other\nways of testing causal claims besides carrying out interventions.\nInstead, interventionism holds that causal claims apply or have truth\nvalues whenever the appropriate counterfactuals concerning what would\nhappen if interventions were to be performed have truth values. As\nexplained above, interventionists think that sometimes such\ncounterfactuals are true even if the interventions in question cannot\nactually be performed. Similarly, interventionists can readily agree\nthat causal claims may be tested and confirmed by, for example, purely\nobservational data, not involving interventions or\nmanipulations\u2014their view, though, is that what is confirmed in\nthis way is a claim about what would happen if certain interventions\nwere to be performed. In fact, thinking of causal claims in this way\nhelps to clarify why certain strategies for causal inference with\nobservational data, such as the use of instrumental variables, are\nmore likely to lead to reliable conclusions than alternatives\n(Woodward 2015).\n\nIn a related criticism, Cartwright contends that the interventionist\naccount is \u201cmonolithic\u201d: it takes just one of the criteria\ncommonly thought to be relevant to whether a relationship is\ncausal\u2014whether it is potentially exploitable for purposes of\nmanipulation\u2014and gives it a privileged or pre-eminent place,\nallowing it to trump other criteria (like spatio-temporal contiguity\nor transmission of energy-momentum), when it comes into conflict with\nthem. By contrast, Cartwright favors a \u201cpluralistic\u201d\naccount, according to which a variety of diverse criteria are relevant\nto whether a relationship is causal and which of these are most\nappropriate or important will depend on the causal claim at issue.\n\nThe interventionist account is indeed mono-criterial. Whether this\nfeature is objectionable depends on whether there are realistic cases\nin which (i) intervention-based criteria and criteria based on other\nconsiderations come into conflict and (ii) it is clear that\nthe causal judgments supported by these other criteria are more\ndefensible than those supported by interventionist criteria.\nCartwright does not present any uncontroversial cases of this kind. We\nhave seen that interventionist accounts and accounts that take, e.g.,\nspatio-temporal continuity to be crucial for causation do yield\nconflicting judgments in some realistic cases (e.g., those involving\ndouble prevention), but it is far from clear that the interventionist\naccount is mistaken in the judgments that it recommends about such\ncases.\n\nTwo still more recent criticisms directed against\n M1\u2013M4\n and possibility constrained notions of interventionism are Reutlinger\n2012 and Glynn 2013. These are discussed in the supplementary document\n Additional Recent Criticisms of the Interventionist Account.\n14. Some Recent Positive Developments.\n\nThe material above has largely focused on the use of interventionist\nor manipulability based ideas to provide an interpretation of causal\nclaims, with little attention paid to the use of these ideas in causal\ninference\u2014that is, inference to causal relationships from\nexperimental and non-experimental data. The latter is an important\nsubject in its own right. Roughly speaking, if one thinks of causal\nclaims as claims about the outcomes of possible manipulations or\nexperiments, then this suggests distinctive ways of conceptualizing\nproblems of causal inference from non-experimental data: these may be\nconceptualized as problems of inferring from such data (and other\nassumptions) what the outcome of a possible experiment would be\nwithout doing the experiment in question. This point of view can used\nto motivate or rationalize the use of such procedures as instrumental\nvariables or regression discontinuity designs\u2014see, e.g., Angrist\nand Pischke 2009 for econometric applications of these ideas.\n\nAnother important extension of interventionist ideas, also with a\nfocus on inference but containing conceptual innovations as well is\ndue to Eberhardt (Eberhardt 2007, Eberhardt and Scheines 2007). These\nauthors generalize the notion of intervention in two ways. First, they\nconsider interventions that do not deterministically fix the value of\nvariable(s) intervened on but rather merely impose a probability\ndistribution on those variables. Second, they explore the use of what\nhave come to be called \u201csoft\u201d interventions. These are\ninterventions that unlike the fully surgical (\u201chard\u201d)\ninterventions considered above (both Pearl\u2019s setting\ninterventions and the notion associated with\n M1\u2013M4),\n do not completely break the previously existing relationships between\nthe variable \\(X\\) intervened on and its causes \\(C\\) but rather\nsupply an exogenous source \\(I\\) of variation to \\(X\\) that leaves its\nrelations to \\(C\\) intact but where \\(I\\) is uncorrelated with \\(C\\).\nCertain experiments are naturally modeled in this way. For example, in\nan experiment in which subjects are randomly given various amounts of\nadditional income (besides whatever income they have from other\nsources) this additional income functions as a soft, rather than a\nhard intervention. Soft interventions may be possible in practice or\nin principle in certain situations in which hard interventions are\nnot. Eberhardt 2007 and Eberhardt and Scheines 2007 explore what can\nbe learned from various combinations of soft and hard, indeterministic\nand deterministic interventions together with non-experimental data in\nvarious contexts. Unsurprisingly each kind of intervention and\nassociated data have both advantages and limitations from the point of\nview of inference.",
