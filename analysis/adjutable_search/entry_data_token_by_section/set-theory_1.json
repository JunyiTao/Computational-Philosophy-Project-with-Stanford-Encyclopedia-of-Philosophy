Thus,\nwe write \\(A\\in B\\) to express that \\(A\\) is a member of the set\n\\(B\\). See the\n\nSupplement on Basic Set Theory\n\n\nfor further details. See also the\n\nSupplement on Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory\n\n\nfor a formalized version of the axioms and further comments. We state\nbelow the axioms of ZFC informally.\n",
