    "main_text": "The Identity View of Integrity\n2. The Identity View of Integrity\n\nA related approach to integrity is to think of it primarily in terms\nof a person\u2019s holding steadfastly true to their commitments,\nrather than ordering and endorsing desires. \u2018Commitment\u2019\nis used as a broad umbrella term covering many different kinds of\nintentions, promises, convictions and relationships of trust and\nexpectation. One may be, and usually is, committed in many different\nways to many different kinds of thing: people, institutions,\ntraditions, causes, ideals, principles, projects, and so on.\nCommitments can be explicitly, self-consciously, publicly entered into\nor implicit, unself-conscious and private. Some are relatively\nsuperficial and unimportant, like casual support of a sporting team;\nothers are very deep, like the commitment implicit in genuine love or\nfriendship.\n\nBecause we find ourselves with so many commitments, of so many\ndifferent kinds, and because commitments inevitably clash and change\nover time, it will not do to define integrity merely in terms of\nremaining steadfastly true to one\u2019s commitments. It matters\nwhich commitments we expect a person of integrity to remain true to.\nPhilosophers have developed different accounts of integrity in\nresponse to this need to specify the kind of commitments that are\ncentrally important to a person\u2019s integrity.\n\nOne option here is to define integrity in terms of the commitments\nthat people identify with most deeply, as constituting what they\nconsider their life is fundamentally about. Commitments of this kind\nare called \u2018identity-conferring commitments\u2019 or sometimes\n\u2018ground projects\u2019. This view of integrity, the identity\nview, is associated most closely with Bernard Williams. It is implicit\nin his discussion of integrity and utilitarianism (Williams 1973; we\nexamine this discussion below) and also features in his criticism of\nKantian moral theory (1981b). The idea is that for people to abandon\nan identity-conferring commitment is for them to lose grip on what\ngives their life its identity, or individual character. An\nidentity-conferring commitment, according to Williams, is \u2018the\ncondition of my existence, in the sense that unless I am propelled\nforward by the conatus of desire, project and interest, it is unclear\nwhy I should go on at all.\u2019 (Williams 1981b, 12).\n\nOne apparent consequence of defining integrity as maintenance of\nidentity-conferring commitments is that integrity cannot really be a\nvirtue. This is Williams\u2019s view. He argues that integrity is not\nrelated to motivation as virtues are. A virtue either motivates a\nperson to act in desirable ways (as benevolence moves a person to act\nfor another\u2019s good), or it enables a person to act in desirable\nways (as courage enables a person to act well). If integrity is no\nmore than maintenance of identity, however, it can play neither of\nthese roles. On the identity view of integrity, to act with integrity\nis just to act in a way that accurately reflects your sense of who you\nare; to act from motives, interests and commitments that are most\ndeeply your own. (Williams 1981a, 49)\n\nA number of criticisms of the identity view of integrity have been\nmade. First, integrity is usually regarded as something worth striving\nfor and the identity account of integrity fails to make sense of this.\n(See Cox, La Caze, Levine 1999.) It disconnects integrity from the\nprevalent view that it is a virtue of some kind and generally\npraiseworthy. Second, the identity theory of integrity ties integrity\nto commitments with which an agent identifies, but acts of\nidentification can be ill-informed, superficial and foolish. People\nmay, through ignorance or self-deception, fail to understand or\nproperly acknowledge the source of their deepest commitments and\nconvictions and we are unlikely to attribute integrity to people who\nhold true to a false and unrealistic picture of themselves. (On the\nother hand, this view of integrity as maintenance of\nidentify-conferring commitments recognizes the relevance of\nself-knowledge to acting with integrity. If people fail to\nact on their core commitments, through self-deception, weakness of\nwill, cowardice, or even ignorance, then to this extent they may be\nsaid to lack integrity.)\n\nThird, on the identity view of integrity, a person\u2019s integrity\nis only at issue when their deepest, most characteristic, or core\nconvictions and aspirations are brought into play. However, we expect\npersons of integrity to behave with integrity in many different\ncontexts, not only those of central importance to them. (See Calhoun\n1995, 245.)\n\nFourth, as noted above, the identity view of integrity places only\nformal conditions upon the kind of person that might be said to\npossess integrity. The identity view of integrity shares this feature\nwith the self-integration view of integrity and similar criticism can\nbe made of it on this ground. It seems plausible to observe certain\nsubstantive limits on the kinds of commitments had by a person of\nintegrity.\n",
