    "main_text": "Epistemology || Universals\n2.3 Universals\n\nAn important issue at the crossing of ontology and epistemology that\nalso has consequences for the philosophy of language is that of\nuniversals. Two main trends can be distinguished among Tibetan\nauthors: The first, which is termed below \u201cantirealism,\u201d\nis a literal interpretation of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s thought\ndenying reality to universals and properties. The second, which one\ncan describe as \u201cmoderate realism,\u201d holds that not all\nuniversals are non-existent. In particular, it concedes some reality\nto predicates, thereby granting reality to the universals that are\ntheir referents.\n2.3.1 Antirealism\n\nThe antirealist position, held by Sakya Pandita and his epigones,\ninsists on the radical distinction between the conceptual domain and\nreality, between universals and particulars. Only particulars are\nreal\u2014the criterion for reality being causal efficiency.\nUniversals are mere mental constructions; they are superimpositions\nthat do not reflect reality, but veil the individuality of particulars\nunder the cover of an imagined shared property. Conversely, the\ndistinct properties that one ascribes to a particular are equally not\npart of the fabric of reality, but mental constructions that veil the\nunity of that particular.\n\nThe question of the why and the how of concept formation is dealt with\nwithin the framework of the theory of any\u0101poha\n(\u201cexclusion of the other,\u201d Tib. gzhan sel)\npropounded by Dharmak\u012brti. According to Dharmak\u012brti,\nconceptual thought proceeds by applying distinctions among particulars\nin a way that reflects some subjective intention and beginningless\nhabits acquired in countless past lives. One accordingly ends up\ngrouping things by excluding them from other things. What is implied\nby the term \u201cexclusion\u201d is that what particulars\napprehended under the cover of a universal have in common is merely\nthat they are all excluded from a complementary domain. In short, what\nxs have in the common is that they are not non-xs.\nBy subsuming a particular under an imagined universal, or by ascribing\na property to it, mentally or verbally, one is not identifying a real\nfeature of this object, but merely distinguishing it from other\nparticulars.\n\nAlthough universals and properties are conceptual constructions, we\nmistakenly identify them as something real. This mistaken conflation\nof the conceptual and reality that we spontaneously apply when forming\nor using concepts provides a bridge between the two domains, prompting\npractical action, interaction with reality, based on fictions. The\nsuccess of such interaction is accounted for by the causation involved\nin the process of concept formation which guarantees an indirect link\nbetween universals and the particulars they are taken to stand for:\nconcepts are formed as the result of experiences involving causally\nactive particulars; however, only the individual causal capacities of\nparticulars are involved, not any shared potential that would\ndetermine natural kinds. Thus, for instance, the universal\n\u201cfire\u201d is conceived following experiences of particulars\nthat one excludes from other particulars that are held not to burn. By\nacting on the basis of the inference that there is \u201cfire\u201d\non a mountain pass when one perceives smoke in this locus, although\nthe object of this inference is the universal \u201cfire,\u201d not\na real fire, when one acts on the basis of this inference one obtains\na particular that fulfills the expected function of burning, as the\npreviously experienced particulars that one excluded from non-fire\ndid.\n2.3.2 Moderate realism\n\nThe Gelukpa tradition as well as some Sakyapa thinkers instead adopted\na moderate realist position with regard to universals. Their argument\nis that if universals were not real, reasoning based on universals\nwould not apply to reality. In other words, reasoning cannot lead to\npractical success by relying on mere fictions. Moderate realism thus\npresents itself as an attempt to account for the soundness of\nconceptual cognitions, and to do so in a way that is more intuitive\nthan the antirealist model.\n\nIn Gelukpa textbooks, universals and specific instances are defined in\nterms of each other: a universal is something instantiated by its\ninstances, the instances are what is subsumed by a kind, or universal.\nTo qualify as an instance, three criteria must be satisfied, namely,\nx is a specific instance of y if\n\nx is y\nx has a relation of essential identity with y\nthere are other instances of y different from\nx.\n\n\nThere is thus no intrinsic difference between particular and\nuniversal, those are relative notions. For instance, \u201cpen\u201d\nis a universal with regard to \u201cred pen,\u201d which is its\nparticular (a red pen is a pen, and is essentially identical with pen,\nand there are other instances of pen, such as a blue pen, that are not\na red pen). But \u201cpen\u201d is also a particular with regard to\n\u201cimpermanence,\u201d and \u201cred pen\u201d is a universal\nwith regard to \u201cplastic red pen.\u201d\n\nFurther, the instantiation of a universal by its specific instance is\ntaken to be a relation that obtains in reality, rather than amounting\nto a constructed superimposition. The red pen really is a pen; it is\nnot merely apprehended under the superimposed universal\n\u201cpen\u201d due to its being excluded from non-pen.\n\nThe relation between the instance and the universal is expressed by\nthe formula \u201cone nature and distinct exclusions\u201d (or\n\u201cdistinct distinguishers for one nature,\u201d Tib. ngo bo\ngcig la ldog pa tha dad). The term \u201cexclusion\u201d brings\nus back to the theory of apoha. When proponents of\nantirealism use this formula, they mean that various conceptual\ndistinctions can be made with regard to a unique particular, by\ndistinguishing it from various complementary domains; for instance,\none can conceive of a particular as excluded from non-blue, from\nnon-impermanent, from non-material, etc. For the moderate realist,\nhowever, this distinction is not a mere conceptual one, it extends to\nreality, although it does not entail a distinction pertaining to the\nsubstance. There are thus real properties that can be predicated, but\nthey are not intrinsically distinct from their subject. If one accepts\nreal predicates, then the universals that are the referents of the\ncorresponding expressions must also be accepted.\n\nBoth the antirealist and the moderate realist models attempt to bridge\nthe gap between universals and particulars by grounding universals in\nreality, the antirealist one by involving causality in the process of\nconcept formation, the moderate realist one by implying a\ncorrespondence in reality to our conceptual distinctions. The second\nmodel, although it provides a more intuitively acceptable explanation,\nmeets with difficulties. If taking conceptual divisions as actual\ndivisions is not without tensions, the mere fact of positing real\nuniversals is problematic in the commentarial tradition of an\nantirealist forefather. A key move in this regard is to distinguish\nthe idea of a universal qua mental construct, and a universal qua a\nphenomena common to several instances. In the second sense, a\nuniversal needs not be unreal.\n\nOther models of moderate realism were developed in the Sakyapa\ntradition, that also invoke the necessity for the existence of a real\nshared property without which our thinking would be arbitrary. Uyukpa\nRikp\u00e9 Sengg\u00e9 (\u02bcU yug pa Rigs pa\u02bci seng\nge, 13th c.), who adopts such a line of\ninterpretation, explains Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s refutation of real\nuniversals as referring to a \u201cmental universal,\u201d the\nmistaken conflation of distinct things under a unitary appearance. His\nview of an \u201cobjective universal\u201d involves the theory of\napoha, in a way that takes the exclusion from non-x as a fact\nrather than as a mental construct.\n\nAnother Sakyapa author who adopts moderate realism is Podong\nChokl\u00e9 Namgyel (Bo dong Phyogs las rnam rgyal,\n1376\u20131451). He qualifies as a realist insofar as he\ndistinguishes between universal qua construct and universal qua common\nphenomena, and accuses the antirealists of nihilism. He nonetheless\ncriticizes other Tibetan versions of moderate realism, which he\nconsiders to be prone to Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s critique against\nreal universals. His solution, akin to Uyukpa\u2019s, is to\nreformulate the universal negatively as a real elimination; a solution\nwhich, however, does not escape the faults he himself addressed\nagainst the positive version of real universals.\n\nModerate realism is traditionally ascribed to Chapa and scholars of\nthe Sangpu school in general. However, the earliest occurrence of\nexplicit arguments in favor of real universals identified so far is in\nthe works of Chumikpa in the last phase of the pre-classical period\nthat already overlaps with the classical one.\n",
