    "main_text": "Applications of Plural Quantification || Establishing the Logicality of Monadic Second-Order Logic\n4.1 Establishing the Logicality of Monadic Second-Order Logic\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 2.1\n Boolos defined an interpretation of the theory MSO of monadic\nsecond-order logic in the theory PFO of plural quantification. He\nsought to use this translation to establish the logicality of MSO.\nDoing so will require two steps. The first step is to argue that PFO\nis pure logic, that is, to establish the full Logicality Thesis\n(however exactly it is interpreted). The second step is to argue that\nthe interpretation of MSO in PFO preserves logicality.\n\nSome of the challenges facing the first step will be examined in\n Section 5.\n The second step too should not be underestimated. Perhaps the\ngreatest worry here is that Boolos\u2019s translation renders\nexpressions from one category (that of monadic predicates) in terms of\nexpressions from another category (that of plural noun phrases). For\ninstance, \u201c\u2026 is an apple\u201d is rendered as \u201cthe\napples\u201d. But these categories are very different\n (Section 2).\n\nHowever, since the thesis that MSO is pure logic is very abstract,\nmuch of its cash value will lie in its applications. And given the\nequi-interpretability of MSO and PFO, it is likely that many\napplications of the logicality of the former can be served equally\nwell by the logicality of the latter. This reduces somewhat the\nimportance of carrying out the second step.\n",
