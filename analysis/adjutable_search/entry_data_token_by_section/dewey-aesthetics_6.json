    "main_text": "Art as Experience || Expression\n2.5 Expression\n\nAnother central question of aesthetics that Dewey considers at length\nin Art as Experience is artistic expression. How can an\nartwork be expressive and serve as means of communication? The issues\nare intertwined, for Dewey believes \u201cobjects of art\u2026\ncommunicate\u201d because they are \u201cexpressive\u201d\n(AE: 110). Artistic expression is for Dewey not a simple\nmatter of the artist transmitting her inner emotions to the work. When\nfor example Van Gogh tried to express \u201cutter desolation\u201d\nin one of his paintings he did not \u201cpour forth\u201d an emotion\nto the artwork, but selected and organized material, such as paint and\npigments, in a certain way to capture this emotional tone, turning the\nmaterial used into means of expression, or a medium in Dewey\u2019s\nterminology.\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s explanation, the expressive act is set off by\n\u201can impulsion\u201d, a state of unsettlement in the organism,\nwhich creates a need to restore a state of balance. Impulsion, as\ndistinguished from \u201cimpulse\u201d, is a developmental movement\nof the \u201cwhole organism\u201d in response to a need arising from\ninteraction with the environment, for example a craving for food\n(AE: 64). It is the beginning stage of a complete experience,\nwhereas impulse is momentary, for example a tongue reacting to a sour\ntaste. Impulsion leads to reflection on the possible means and actions\nfor restoring a state of harmony and a decision to act accordingly,\nlike in the case of finding some water to satisfy one\u2019s thirst.\nThe reflective movement caused by the impulsion also makes the\ncreature more aware of itself. \u201cBlind surge\u201d turns into\n\u201ca purpose\u201d and \u201cthe resistance\u201d the creature\nfaces when trying to complete the impulsion \u201ccalls out\nthought\u201d and \u201cgenerates curiosity\u201d (AE:\n65). The act of expression involves similar mental undertakings, which\nprecisely makes the emotive impetus behind expression closer to an\nimpulsion than a reflexive type impulse. It is as if something\nrequires squeezing out or pressing forth, that is expression\n(AE: 70). Out of this expression the expressive object\ngradually takes shape.\n\nAnother important distinction is between an expression and a discharge\nof emotion. All expression involves discharge, but only a particular\nkind of discharge counts as expression. Dewey insists that someone who\nsimply acts angrily is not expressing anger. Mere \u201cgiving\nway\u201d to impulsion does not constitute expression. The goal of\nexpression is not to get rid of the initial emotion, as is the case\nwith screams that merely discharge emotion, but to achieve a clearer\nsense of its content and significance. For Dewey, expression means\n\u201cto stay by, to carry forward in development, to work out to\ncompletion\u201d (AE: 67\u201368). For an emotional\ndischarge to turn into expression in Dewey\u2019s sense also requires\nan external channel for releasing and working on the emotive energy of\nthe background impulsion. Dewey writes: \n\n\nwhere there is no administration of objective conditions, no shaping\nof materials in the interest of embodying the excitement, there is no\nexpression. (AE: 68) \n\n\nThe expressive object is the embodiment of this expressive act.\n\nWhat also separates expression from an action caused by a mere impulse\nis that expression has a medium. For example, a crying baby does not,\nin Dewey\u2019s view, use the cry to express her emotions; the cry is\njust an ulterior sign of dissatisfaction. However, when the smile and\nthe outreached hand, for example, are used to express the joy of\nseeing a friend, these bodily movements function as media for\nexpressing joy. Whether something counts as a medium of expression or\nnot thus \u201cdepends upon the way in which material is used\u201d\n(AE: 69). When the artist works on an expressive object based\non her initial impulsion, the materials of art\u2014pigments, clays,\nnotes, words\u2014turn into media of expression.\n\nSome of Dewey\u2019s formulations on the artistic medium come close\nto the so-called medium-specificity claim according to which each of\nthe arts has its own specific medium that gives a kind of internal\nground mechanism for the art\u2019s potencies and development;\n\u201ccolor does something in experience and sound something\nelse\u201d (AE: 230). Different artistic media are,\naccording to Dewey, suited for different expressive ends in the sense\nthat \n\n\nevery medium has its own power, active and passive, outgoing and\nreceptive, and\u2026 the basis for distinguishing the different\ntraits of the arts is their exploitation of the energy that is\ncharacteristic of the material used as a medium. (AE: 248)\n\n\n\nAesthetic effects, thereby, attach to their medium.\n\nFor Dewey, expression is also not a matter of finding an outer form to\nan already complete emotion. Emotions, in Dewey\u2019s sense, do not\ncome in ready-made form, but are more like processes. Especially the\nemotive impulsion behind expression initially lacks a clear-cut\ncontent. We might be overcome by a certain emotion but might also be\nunable to immediately grasp its ultimate content and why we feel the\nway we do. Dewey compares the position the emotive impulsion has in\nartistic expression to a magnet that draws in certain material while\nrejecting others. The impulsion constitutes a kind of gathering\nprinciple of the artist\u2019s work, for example explaining her\nchoice of material and ways of using and working on them (AE:\n75). In Dewey\u2019s view, the act of expression is driven by the\neffort to find an appropriate fit between the impulsion and the outer\nmaterial and involves a constant monitoring of the impact that the\nartistic decisions have on the development of the initial impulsion.\nDo they, for example, feed it, clarify it, or obscure it? In other\nwords, \u201cemotional energy\u201d does \u201creal work\u201d in\nthe build-up of artistic expression leading to the expressive object\nas it \n\n\nevokes, assembles, accepts, and rejects memories, images,\nobservations, and works them into a whole. (AE: 160) \n\n\nThis is why Dewey emphasizes that in artistic expression it is not\njust the external materials of marble, pigment, and words that undergo\na change. Similar changes occur \u201con the side of\n\u2018inner\u2019 materials\u201d, such as \u201cimages,\nobservations, memories and emotions\u201d; in the development of the\nexpressive act they too receive a new form and structure (AE:\n81).\n\nFrom a Deweyan viewpoint, expression then means processing external\nmaterial \u201cthrough the alembic of personal experience\u201d.\nHowever, the material itself belongs to \u201cthe common world and so\nhas qualities in common with the material of other experiences\u201d.\nExpression thereby organically connects \u201ca personal act\u201d\nand an \u201cobjective result\u201d (AE: 88). The fact that\nin expression the artist\u2019s personal experience is mediated\nthrough objective material opens the possibility for the audience to\nshare the artist\u2019s vision embodied in the work. An effort to\ncommunicate by these sorts of objective means is what turns the\nexternal material into a medium, that is, \u201can\nintermediary\u201d between the artist and audience (AE:\n201). But as the experience behind expression is \u201cintensely\nindividualized\u201d, the work can also open for the public \n\n\nnew fields of experience and disclose new aspects and qualities in\nfamiliar scenes and objects. (AE: 149) \n\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s view, communication in the arts, however, takes a\ndifferent form than in the sciences for example: \u201cscience states\nmeanings; art expresses them\u201d (AE: 90). Like many other\nphilosophers of art, Dewey emphasizes that artistic communication does\nnot take place on the level of statements and propositional knowing.\nAesthetic art, by contrast to science, constitutes an experience.\nArt\u2019s manner of communicating is \u201cevocative\u201d: by\nrendering objective and physical material into an expressive medium,\nthe artist seeks to evoke \u201cthe experience he or she wants the\naudience to have or reflect upon\u201d (Stroud 2011: 105). The\ncognitive and the experiential sides of art are thereby seen to be\nvery much intertwined in Dewey\u2019s aesthetics.\n",
