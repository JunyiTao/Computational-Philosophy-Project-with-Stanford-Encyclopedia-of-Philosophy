    "main_text": "Ethics and Religion || Meta-Halakhah and the Status of Women\n6.2 Meta-Halakhah and the Status of Women\n\nLeibowitz\u2019s account of halakhah is not uni-dimensional. His\nclaim that most of the mitzvoth are meaningless according to\nhuman conceptions of value (Judaism, 16) leaves an important\ngap that he exploits elsewhere in his writings, particularly in a\nshort late piece on the status of women in Judaism, where he\ndistinguishes between two types of mitzvoth in a manner that renders\nthe picture considerably more complex.\n\nThus on the one hand, we have the ritual commandments required of men\nand not required of women. These mitzvoth are indeed\n\u201cmeaningless,\u201d having no intrinsic value beyond their\nstatus as mitzvoth that God requires of men and not women. They do not\nreflect any exalted status for men or yield access to some sort of\nreligious experience beyond the mere burden of performance. Given\nthis, the desire of women to take on such practices in the name of\nequality reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \u2013 or at least a\nnon-Leibowitzian understanding \u2013 of the nature of these\ncommandments. And yet, when it comes to the highest levels of Torah\nstudy and access to public office, both of which had traditionally\nbeen halakhically forbidden to women, Leibowitz takes a very different\nview. Barring women access to the study of Torah \u201cis not to\nexempt them from a duty \u2026 but is to deprive them of a basic\nJewish right \u2026 [that] renders their Jewishness inferior to that\nof men\u201d (Judaism, 129). The original restriction, as\nwell as that regarding attaining public office, reflected the\nprevailing socio-cultural norms of the surrounding society rather than\nany essential halakhic determinations. Thus Leibowitz wishes to\ndistinguish between\n\n\nabsolute demands reflecting acceptance of the \u2018yoke of\nthe kingdom of heaven\u2019 that are not amenable to adjustment to\nnatural or social factors, [and] practices which reflect given\ncircumstances and the views shaped by them; in other words, between\nunconditional prescriptions and proscriptions and norms reflecting a\ngiven sociocultural milieu and its prejudices.\n(Judaism, 131)\n\n\nWe find, therefore, a realm of mitzvoth that do appear to be\nsubservient to human values and societal change. That Leibowitz\nbelieves in such a category, independently of the highly charged\ngender question, is clear from the following:\n\n\nConsider the proscription of ploughing with an ox and an ass\nyoked together. Does this imply a duty to base agriculture on animal\npower and to create the opportunity for fulfilling the prohibition?\nReversing the terms, is mechanized agriculture, which obviates the use\nof animals as a source of energy forbidden because it removes all\nopportunity for observing this mitzvah? Or is it permissible to assume\na hypothetical imperative: in the event that animals are used, avoid\nploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together?\n(Judaism, 149)\n\n\nThe Torah clearly contains laws or commandments that react to\npolitical and social institutions already in place \u2013 hence laws\nconcerning slavery for example. Thus it turns out that there are two\ncategories of mitzvoth for Leibowitz: type1 acts without\nintrinsic meaning that are constitutive of a halakhic reality and not\namenable to change; and type2 acts where the halakhic\ncommunity has responsibility for regulating a pre-existing reality.\nThese halakhic acts can change depending on the general sociocultural\nnorms governing that particular aspect of reality, be it agriculture,\nor gender equality. Indeed, Leibowitz often notes explicitly that\nJudaism is not to be identified with the specific laws with which it\nbegan, but with the \u201crecognition of a system of precepts as\nbinding, even if their specifics were often only determined with\ntime\u201d (Judaism, 4).\n\nWhat is one to make of this concession? While there might be strong\narguments for drawing such a distinction on both textual and common\nsense grounds, the question is whether Leibowitz\u2019s system can\nconsistently allow such external concerns to intrude upon religion\nwithout usurping it. The meta-halakhic issue, as Leibowitz terms it,\nregarding the status of women in the Jewish community, drives specific\nhalakhic changes. And ultimately what appears to be driving these\nchanges is an ethical assumption regarding unjustified gender\ninequalities. But if one is allowing religious norms to be\nsubordinated to human values, then by Leibowitz\u2019s standards one\nis serving man rather than God \u2013 if the motivation here is\nethical or more broadly social, then surely by his intentional\ndefinition of mitzvoth, they cease to be religious acts.\n\nIn the particular case of gender equality, however, there are broader\nconcerns that come into play \u2013 the survival of Judaism. While\nthis is not explicit in everything that Leibowitz writes, he makes\nprecisely this claim regarding the gender issue in an interview with\nMichael Shashar \u2013 \u201cthe future of Judaism depends on\nit\u201d (Sihot, 110). One might argue therefore that our\nbeing responsive to the ethical concerns presented in these cases has\nreligious significance since it is subsumed under the overriding\nreligious concern to maintain the existence of Judaism. Thus\nthese acts would retain their religious significance given the more\ngeneral religious motivation for the changes. One might think of them\nas having religious value in a secondary sense, given that they serve\nthe end of maintaining the halakhic system, while straightforward\nmitzvoth or halakhic demands have religious value in the primary\nsense.\n\nIt is very difficult, however, to escape the feeling that Leibowitz is\ndriven here by his ethical impulses, and more significantly it is\nclear that all manner of halakhic decisions are motivated by explicit\nconsideration of ethical issues that impinge on the halakhic decision\nmaking process. One could argue that given that such principles as\n\u201cthe ways of pleasantness\u201d or \u201cdoing the right and\nthe good\u201d are internal to the halakhic system, Leibowitz could\ncontend that one need not go beyond the structures of the system in\norder to make the changes that he endorses. One might thus consider\nthese as \u201cprinciples\u201d in the Dworkinian sense, as fully\npart of the legal system and the bearers of \u201cweight\u201d when\nit comes to deciding halakhic questions (Dworkin, 1977, 22ff).\nLeibowitz\u2019s conception of the halakhic system seems, however, to\nbe more akin to legal positivism (see Brafman 2014, 101ff), as befits\na scientist, and it seems as if the above response would require\nLeibowitz to reject a straightforward positivist\nunderstanding of the halakhic system. On such an understanding,\nethical principles are seen as external to the system, even if able to\ndetermine what the halakhah \u201cought to be\u201d \u2013 but such\na view would entirely undermine the halakhic validity of any decisions\ngiven that they would be serving human needs. The involvement of\nprinciples in this manner though, need not necessarily undermine a\npositivist reading of Leibowitz, but could instead render his account\na form of inclusive legal positivism. Of course there are those who\nwould argue that this would undermine his positivism since\ninclusive legal positivism is incoherent, but this is a debate that\nwould take us too far afield.\n\nRegardless of these jurisprudential issues, vague principles such as\nthose mentioned are not going to decide the question of whether\nspecific changes actually do advance the \u201cways of\npleasantness\u201d. De facto it is surely almost impossible\nto insulate such considerations from human interests, which would of\ncourse disqualify them as considerations that should determine\nreligious acts on Leibowitz\u2019s intentional model. Moreover, one\nmight even question the very idea that the mitzvoth should serve the\nclearly human purpose of the continued existence of Judaism, since it\nundercuts Leibowitz\u2019s notion that the only purpose of the\nmitzvoth is the knowledge that service of God consists in their\nperformance. Then again, Leibowitz could presumably respond by appeal\nto his identification of the performance of mitzvoth with faith in\nGod. This means that in the absence of the continued existence of the\nJewish people, the performance of mitzvoth would cease. Thus the\ncontinued existence of the people is indeed only a\n\u201cpurpose\u201d inasmuch as its own purpose is the performance\nof mitzvoth, i.e., service of God. Leibowitz, then, could possibly\nfind a way of ensuring that all changes are ultimately directed\ntowards the service of God as his system demands. As a good positivist\nthough, he may balk at this ability to make almost any act into an act\nof divine worship, since his original sharp and well-defined\ndistinction between acts of worship and acts that answer to human or\nsocial needs will likely now suffer Anthony Flew\u2019s \u201cdeath\nby a thousand qualifications\u201d (Flew, 1950).\n\nUnless then Leibowitz is going to allow ethical motivation for certain\nhalakhic decisions and problematize his system, or gerrymander his\ndescriptions of those decisions so as to force them into his religious\nstraitjacket, it appears as if these areas of decision and action\ncannot be deemed religious in the strict sense. Leibowitz certainly\nrecognizes that halakhic decisions are \u201cgrounded either in the\nHalakhah itself or in the conditions necessary for halakhic\nobservance\u201d (Judaism, 4), and thus it may be that these\nethical halakhic decisions are \u201cenablers\u201d rather than\ndirect loci of religious worship. By contracting the religious sphere\nin this way, Leibowitz could maintain some indirect religious value\nfor the ethically motivated acts of a religious Jew. But the\ncontraction that such a move necessitates would relegate enormous\ntracts of the Talmud to this lesser status, which seems problematic.\nAnd again to counter that all decisions are taken by the halakhic\nauthorities with the general motivation of \u201cserving God,\u201d\nwould make it difficult to retain any form of distinction between\nreligion and ethics of the form that Leibowitz clearly wishes to\nmaintain. Of course many of these problems hang on the thread of\nLeibowitz\u2019s concept of intention \u2013 one that assumes that\nintentions can be clearly and exclusively identified as\n\u201cethical\u201d or \u201creligious.\u201d Melzer (1976, 261),\nhowever, among others, has argued that Leibowitz\u2019s concept of\nintention is impoverished.\n\nSetting aside the problems just identified, Leibowitz\u2019s\ndistinction remains problematic in the context of his overall system.\nHe explicitly categorizes the realm of synagogue ritual to\ntype1 acts. Yet in much of contemporary orthodoxy, this is\none of the most fought over issues, and one in which the inequalities\nfor women are understood by some as tantamount to the denial of\n\u201ca basic Jewish right \u2026 [that] renders their Jewishness\ninferior to that of men\u201d (Judaism, 129). Should women\nfeel so marginalized by this particular inequality that it threatens\nthe future of Judaism, leading to sanctioning the participation of\nwomen in certain rituals, Leibowitz\u2019s type1 mitzvoth\nwould have to be recategorized as type2 mitzvoth and we\nwould have to conclude that the categories are fluid and that\ncommandments can move between categories. But then the question of how\nwe categorize the commandments seems to become dependent on human\nperception and values, which would once again be problematic for\nLeibowitz.\n\nUltimately then, Leibowitz struggles to maintain God\u2019s radical\ntranscendence and his intentional account of religious worship in its\nmost pristine form. Neither history, nor nature, including human\nnature, are sources of religious value. God\u2019s prescriptions\nalone are holy and Jewish worship, indeed Jewish faith, is simply the\ncommitment to this behavioral regime. But while he begins with a tidy\ndefinition of religious acts as absolute commands performed with the\nintention of serving God, as acts that cannot be motivated by human\nconcerns or interests, the fact that life involves other given civil\nand social settings requires that we deal with such interests. This\nyields type2 acts, with resulting questions regarding\nwhether or not these mitzvoth can be understood as such without\nLeibowitz\u2019s theocentrism folding into a form of\nanthropocentrism. The distinction necessary to prevent this amongst\nhalakhic decisors \u2013 that between the intention of\n\u201crealizing the Torah\u201d and the intention to \u201cadapt\nHalakhah to a variety of human needs\u201d (Judaism, 4)\n\u2013 is difficult to maintain, and, one imagines, could very easily\nfall victim to self-deception. In general, it seems as if\nLeibowitz\u2019s system simply cannot take the strain of maintaining\nits pristine religious intentionalism while dealing with ongoing\nhalakhic questions in a functioning society.\n",
