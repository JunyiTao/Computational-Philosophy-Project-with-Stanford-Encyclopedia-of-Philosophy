    "main_text": "Alternative Explanation || Explaining Away\n3.1 Explaining Away[8]\n\nThat an alleged explanatory factor \u03b1 is provisionally explained\naway requires that there be an alternative explanation \u03a3 meeting\nthese conditions:\n\n\u03a3 is explanatorily adequate to the relevant phenomenon\n(structure, property, entity, event)\n\u03a3 can be rationally supported in terms of available (or\nlikely) evidence\n\u03a3 is relevantly superior to the original in terms either of\nadequacy or support\n\u03a3 requires no essential reference to \u03b1\n\n\nHowever, (a) \u2013 (d) are incomplete in a way directly relevant to\nthe present discussion. Here is a very simple case. Suppose that an\nelderly uncle dies in suspicious circumstances, and a number of the\nrelatives believe that the correct explanation is the direct agency of\na niece who is primary heir, via deliberately and directly\nadministering poison. However, forensic investigation establishes that\nthe cause of death was a mix-up among medications the uncle was\ntaking\u2014an unfortunate confusion. The suspicious relatives,\nhowever, without missing an explanatory beat shift the niece\u2019s\nagency back one level, proposing that the mix-up itself was\norchestrated by the niece\u2014switching contents of prescription\nbottles, no doubt. And that might very well turn out to be the\ntruth.\n\nIn that sort of case, the \u03b1 in question (e.g., niecely agency)\nis no longer directly appealed to in the relevant initial explanatory\nlevel, but is not removed from all explanatory relevance to the\nphenomenon in question. In general, then, for \u03b1 to be explained\naway in the sense of banished from all explanatory relevance the\nfollowing condition must also be met:\n\nno reference to \u03b1 is required at any explanatory level\nunderlying \u03a3\n\n\nRoughly this means that \u03a3 does not depend essentially on any\npart \u03b2 of any prior explanation where \u03b1 is essential to\n\u03b2. There are some additional possible technical qualifications\nrequired, but the general intuition should be clear.\n\nThus, e.g., whereas there was no need to appeal to caloric at some\nprior or deeper level, with design, according to various design\nadvocates, there is still an explanatory lacuna (or implicit\npromissory note) requiring reference to design at some explanatory\nlevel prior to Darwinian evolution. Indeed, as some see it (and as\nPaley himself suggested), there are phenomena requiring explanation in\ndesign terms which cannot be explained away at any prior explanatory\nlevel (short of the ultimate level).\n\nThat some phenomenon \u03b1 has been explained away can be taken to\nmean two very different things\u2014either as\n\nshowing that it is no longer rational to believe that \u03b1\nexists\n\n\nor as\n\nshowing that \u03b1 does not exist\n\n\n(And often, of course, both.)\n\nFor instance, few would assert that there is still an extant rational\ncase for belief in phlogiston\u2014any explanatory work it did at the\nproximate level seems to have ceased, and deeper explanatory uses for\nit have never subsequently materialized. Perhaps its non-existence was\nnot positively established immediately, but removal of rational\njustification for belief in some entity can morph into a case for\nnon-existence as the evidence for a rival hypothesis increases over\ntime.\n3.1.1 Level-shifting\n\nPurported explanations can be informally divided into two broad\ncategories\u2014those involving agents, agency, intention, and the\nlike; and those involving mechanism, physical causality, natural\nprocesses, and the like. The distinction is not clean (functioning\nartifacts typically involve both), but is useful enough in a rough and\nready way, and in what follows agent explanations and mechanical\nexplanations respectively will be used as convenient handles. Nothing\npernicious is built into either the broad distinction or the specified\nterminology.\n\nThere are some instructive patterns that emerge in explanatory\nlevel-shifting attempts, and in what immediately follows some of the\nmore basic patterns will be identified.\n(a) Agent explanations\n\nIntention, intervention, and other agency components of explanations\ncan very frequently be pushed back to prior levels\u2014much as many\ndefenders of teleological arguments claim. The earlier case of the\nalleged poisoning of the rich uncle by the niece is a simple example\nof this.\n\nBut in some cases, the specifics of the agent explanation in question\nmay appeal to some prior level less plausible or sensible. For\nexample, suppose that one held the view that crop circles were to be\nexplained in terms of direct alien activity. One could, upon getting\nirrefutable video proof of human production of crop circles, still\nmaintain that aliens were from a distance controlling the brains of\nthe humans in question, and that thus the responsibility for crop\ncircles did still lie with alien activity. While this retreat of\nlevels preserves the basic explanation, it of course comes with a\nsignificant cost in inherent implausibility.\n\nStill the level-changing possibility is as a general rule available\nwith proposed agent explanations.\n(b) Mechanical explanations\n\nPushing specific explanatory factors back to a prior level often works\nless smoothly in cases of purely mechanical/physical explanations than\nin intentional/agency explanations. In many attempted mechanistic\nrelocation cases, it is difficult to see how the specific relocated\nexplanatory factor is even supposed to work, much less generate any\nnew explanatory traction. Exactly what would caloric do if pushed back\none level, for instance?\n\nAlthough level shifting of specific explanatory factors seems to work\nless easily within purely physical explanations, relocation attempts\ninvolving broad physical principles can sometimes avoid such\ndifficulties. For instance, for centuries determinism was a basic\nbackground component of scientific explanations (apparently stochastic\nprocesses being explained away epistemically). Then, early in the 20th\ncentury physics was largely converted to a quantum mechanical picture\nof nature as involving an irreducible indeterminism at a fundamental\nlevel\u2014apparently deterministic phenomena now being what was\nexplained away. However, DeBroglie, Bohm and others (even for a time\nEinstein) tried to reinstate determinism by moving it back to an even\ndeeper fundamental level via hidden variable theories. Although the\nhidden variable attempt is generally thought not to be successful, its\nfailure is not a failure of principle.\n3.1.2 Possible disputes\n\nHow one assesses the legitimacy, plausibility, or likelihood of the\nspecific counter-explanation will bear substantial weight here, and\nthat in turn will depend significantly on among other things\nbackground beliefs, commitments, metaphysical dispositions, and the\nlike. If one has a prior commitment to some key \u03b1 (e.g., to\ntheism, atheism, naturalism, determinism, materialism, or teleology),\nor assigns a high prior to that \u03b1, the plausibility of taking\nthe proposed (new) explanation as undercutting, defeating, or refuting\n\u03b1 (and/or \u03a3) will be deeply affected, at least\ninitially.\n\nTilting the conceptual landscape via prior commitments is both an\nequal opportunity epistemic necessity and a potential pitfall\nhere. Insisting on pushing an explanatory factor back a level is often\nan indication of a strong prior commitment of some sort. Disagreement\nover deeper philosophical or other principles will frequently generate\ndivergence over when something has or has not been explained away. One\nside, committed to the principle, will accept a level change as\nembodying a deeper insight into the relevant phenomenon. The other,\nrejecting the principle, will see an ad hoc retreat to defend an\n\u03b1 which has in fact been explained away.\n\nReturning to the present issue, design argument advocates will of\ncourse reject the claim that design, teleology, agency and the like\nhave been explained away either by science generally or by Darwinian\nevolution in particular. Reasons will vary. Some will see any\nscience\u2014Darwinian evolution included\u2014as incompetent to say\nanything of ultimate design relevance, pro or con. (Many on\nboth sides of the design issue fit here.) Some will see Darwinian\nevolution as failing condition (a), (b) and/or (c), claiming that\nDarwinian evolution is not explanatorily adequate to selected\n\u03b1\u2019s, is inadequately supported by the evidence, and is far\nfrom superior to agency explanations of relevant phenomena.\n(Creationists and some\u2014not all\u2014\u2018intelligent\ndesign\u2019 advocates fit here.) Some will argue that a Darwinian\nfailure occurs at (d), citing e.g., a concept of information\nclaimed to be both essential to evolution and freighted with agency.\n(Some intelligent design advocates fit here; see Dembski 2002 and\nMeyer 1998.) However, the major contention of present interest\ninvolves (e).\n",
