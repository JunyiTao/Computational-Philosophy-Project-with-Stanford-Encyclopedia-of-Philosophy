    "main_text": "Force, Norms, and Conversation || Speech Acts and Scorekeeping\n6.2 Speech Acts and Scorekeeping\n\nMuch literature concerned with speech acts is curiously disconnected\nfrom research in the semantics of natural language emphasizing\npragmatic factors. For instance, Stalnaker (1972, 1973, 1974), Lewis\n(1979, 1980), Thomason (1990) and others have developed models of the\nkinematics of conversations aimed at understanding the role of\nquantification, presupposition (both semantic and pragmatic),\nanaphora, deixis, and vagueness in discourse. Such models typically\nconstrue conversations as involving an ever-developing set of\nPropositions that can be presupposed by interlocutors. This set of\nPropositions is the conversational common ground, defined as\nthat set of Propositions that all interlocutors take to be true, while\nalso taking it that all other interlocutors take them to be true. If a\nProposition p is in a conversation\u2019s common ground, then a speaker may\nfelicitously presuppose p\u2019s truth. Suppose then that the\nProposition that Singapore has a unique King is in a\nconversation\u2019s common ground at given point; then a speaker may\nfelicitously utter a sentence such as \u2018The present King of\nSingapore is wise,\u2019 or \u2018Singapore\u2019s king is\nsleeping\u2019. Other parameters characterizing a conversation at a\ngiven point include the domain of discourse, a set of salient\nperceptible objects, standards of precision, time, world or situation,\nspeaker, and addressee. The set of all values for these items at a\ngiven conversational moment is often referred to as\n\u201cconversational score\u201d.\n\n\u201cScorekeeping\u201d approaches to language use typically\nconstrue a contribution to a conversation as a Proposition: If that\n\u201cassertion\u201d is accepted, then the score is updated by\nhaving the Proposition entered into common ground. In this spirit,\nMacFarlane (2011) considers an account of the speech act of assertion\nin terms an utterance\u2019s capacity to update conversational score. Such\nan approach will, however, face a difficulty in explaining how two\nspeech acts with the same content, such as an assertion that the Milky\nWay contains a black hole, and a conjecture that it does, will make\ndifferent conversational contributions. An enrichment of the\nscorekeeping model would include sensitivity to differences such as\nthese.\n\nAnother development in the scorekeeping model refines the teleological\npicture adumbrated above to incorporate Questions, construed (along\nthe lines of Section 2.1) as sets of Propositions. When an\ninterlocutor proffers an assertion that is not met with objections by\nothers in the conversation, the Propositional content of that\nillocution will enter into common ground. When an interlocutor poses a\nquestion that is accepted by others, we may represent the change as an\naddition to Common Ground of the set of propositions that is the\nInterrogative content of that illocution. The presence of that\nInterrogative obliges interlocutors to work to rule all but one\nProposition that is a complete answer to the Interrogative. Because\nInterrogatives stand in inferential relations to one another (Q1\nentails Q2 just in case any answer to Q1 is an answer to Q2), one\nstrategy for answering a question is to divide it into tractable\nquestions that it entails: \u2018How many covered bridges are there\nin Japan?\u2019 can be answered by answering that question for each\nof that country\u2019s 47 prefectures. Roberts (2004, 2012) develops\nthe Question Under Discussion model of conversational dynamics\naccording to which common ground contains a partially ordered set of\nInterrogatives in addition to a set of Propositions. This teleological\napproach to conversation bids fair to enrich our understanding of the\nrelations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics\nsuch as presupposition and \nimplicature.[18]\n",
