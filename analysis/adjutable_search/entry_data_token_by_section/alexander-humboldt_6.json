    "main_text": "Humboldt\u2019s Writings: Scope, Genre, and Translations\n2. Humboldt\u2019s Writings: Scope, Genre, and Translations\n\nHumboldt lived a long life, during which he published amply. In his\nwritings, Humboldt brings together scientific, historical,\nphilosophical, and aesthetic perspectives, while also drawing on\npersonal experience. His aims were to convey nature and culture as\ninterconnected, articulate a vision of nature as an interrelated\nunity, and enable his readers to imaginatively experience the natural\nworld that he had witnessed. To realize these aims, Humboldt used a\nnumber of means\u2014careful measurements, detailed observations, and\nartistic approaches\u2014all of which are intended to support one\nanother. Humboldt composed essays which he described as\nNaturgem\u00e4lde (nature-paintings), modelled on landscape\npaintings, and which can themselves be regarded as \u201cscientific\nworks of art\u201d, in that they at once deepen scientific knowledge\nand heighten aesthetic experience. As Humboldt sees it, the essays\nmove in a \u201cdual direction\u201d, joining \u201ca literary with\na purely scientific goal\u201d (DA 5: xi; VN: 27).\n\nWhether Humboldt successfully realized his aims remains, however, a\nmatter of dispute. Some argue that Humboldt did indeed achieve this\ngoal\u2014and, in so doing, developed an entirely new genre, which\nOttmar Ette has described as \u201cHumboldtian Writing\u201d on\nanalogy with Humboldtian science (Ette 2001). Others, however, see in\nHumboldt\u2019s writings more confusion than seamless cohesion\n(B\u00f6hme 2001). As an early reviewer put it: \n\n\nExamples and comparisons\u2026 by their number and variety, impair\nthe unity \u2026 of the descriptions, and present collateral objects\nwithout a sufficient subordination of the principle. (Edinburgh\nReview 1815: 111)\n\n\nHumboldt\u2019s joining of genres is also evident in the\nmulti-mediality of other works\u2014above all, in\nG\u00e9ographie des plantes and the Tableau\nphysique included in the essay. The French tableau,\nwhich Humboldt translates as Naturgem\u00e4ldein the German\nedition, refers ambiguously to both text and image. This\nambiguity, as Sylvie Romanowski writes, \n\n\nsuggests that the words and the picture are inseparable\u2014the two\nwork together to form one work, and only combined into one work can\nthey convey Humboldt\u2019s knowledge. (Romanowski 2009: 161)\n\n\nHumboldt\u2019s works were translated into many languages, with\nEnglish translations often appearing in the same year as the original\nFrench (or German). Humboldt often played a role in seeking out\ncompetent translators, and at times may have aided with the\ntranslations. Many of his translators were women: Helen Maria Williams\ntranslated Relation historique soon after it was published,\nwhile Thomasina Ross translated it some fifty years later. Elizabeth\nSabine translated Ansichten der Natur in 1849, and with her\nhusband, Edward, she translated Kosmosbetween 1846 and 1858.\nElise C. Ott\u00e9 translated both Ansichten der Natur\n(1850) and Kosmos (1848\u20131858). The translations were\noften diverging, with the most explicit difference being between\nWilliams\u2019 seven-volume translation of Relation\nhistorique (1814\u20131829) and Ross\u2019s three-volume\nrendition (1852\u20133). As Alison Martin notes, the differences are\nnot only in size, but also in language, and in the way in which the\nscientist is portrayed (Martin 2018). Ross, for instance, eliminates\nsections in which Humboldt acknowledges a debt to his\npredecessors\u2014thereby furnishing an image of Humboldt as a lone\ngenius-scientist. Humboldt\u2019s advice was often sought by his\ntranslators\u2014in particular the Sabines\u2014who in some cases\nmade significant changes or additions to the original (Martin 2018:\n206, 221).\n\nHumboldt was deeply dissatisfied with the first English translation of\nKosmos, by Augustin Prichard. Pritchard had translated\nBeschreibungin the work\u2019s subtitle as\n\u201chistory\u201d rather than \u201cdescription\u201d. Humboldt\npractically begged Edward and Elizabeth Sabine to undertake a second\ntranslation, writing to Edward that \n\n\nI have striven to demonstrate that Weltbeschreibung is not\nWeltgeschichte, that the history of the revolutions which our\nplanet has undergone, as exemplified by the Milky Way, should not be\nconfused with the description of the earth and of the celestial\nspaces\u2026. (quoted in Martin 2018: 203)\n\n\nA far more egregious translation of Humboldt\u2019s works is Sidney\nThrasher\u2019s 1856 The Island of Cuba, by Alexander\nHumboldt\u2014a significantly censored version of\nHumboldt\u2019s Essai Politique sur l\u2019ile de\nCuba. Thrasher, an American who lived in Cuba for many years, was\nof the view\u2014along with President Polk\u2014that Cuba should be\npart of the United States. He was also pro-slavery. His edition of\nHumboldt\u2019s work not only excluded the chapter on slavery, but\nalso included an essay by Thrasher, in which slavery is defended. Upon\nreading an advance copy of Thrasher\u2019s translation,\nHumboldt\u2019s was furious. In an open letter to a Berlin newspaper\npublished in July 1856, Humboldt complained that while the Spanish and\nBritish translations of his work did not censor him, the American\ntranslation did. He adds that the censored portions of the work are\nthe ones to which he attaches greatest significance.  This open letter\nwas quickly translated into English and published in the New York\nTimes, the New York Tribune and the New York\nHerald (Foner 1983). As Laura Dassow Walls observes, Humboldt\nwas aware that Americans would read his letter, and took the\nopportunity to summarize his main arguments in it (Walls 2009).\n",
