    "main_text": "Objections to the Theory of Descriptions || The argument from incompleteness\n5.3 The argument from incompleteness\n\nAnother persistent problem for the classical Russellian theory of\ndescriptions has been the charge that it fails to account for the\nproblem of \u201cincomplete descriptions\u201d (for discussion see\nDonnellan (1968), Hornsby (1977), Devitt (1981, chapter 2; 2004),\nWettstein (1981), Recanati (1986), Salmon (1982), Soames (1986), Neale\n(1990; chapter 2), and Reimer (1992)). In addition, Kripke (1977),\nwhile defending Russell\u2019s theory of description against the\nproblem of misdescription, allows that the argument from incomplete\ndescriptions might be enough of a problem to force us to accept\nreferential interpretations of descriptions. The worry, initially\nraised in Strawson (1950), is that if I say \u2018the table is\ncovered with books\u2019, I do not mean to be suggesting that there\nis only one table in the world. Unfortunately, that seems to be\nprecisely what the Russellian theory of descriptions is committed to.\n(Recall that on the Russellian analysis my utterance is shorthand for\n\u2018there is a table and only one table and every table is covered\nwith books\u2019.)\n\nOne strategy for dealing with this problem is that the context may\nprovide us the means to flesh out the description. For example,\nperhaps descriptions can be fleshed out appropriately if we allow\nimplicit spatiotemporal locating expressions to be inserted into the\ndescription. The suggestion is that when we speak of the table we are\nimplicitly specifying a spatial coordinate\u2014in effect, we are\nsaying \u2018the table over there\u2019. One problem with strategies\nof this nature is that there fails to be a principled basis (in the\nterminology of Devitt and Sterelny (1999)) for determining what the\ncontent of these descriptions is to be. Is it to be a description that\nthe speaker has in mind? Is this description really sufficient to\nuniquely identify the object in question? Is it always clear that the\nspeaker has a description in mind?\n\nNeale (1990) has argued that whatever we may want to say about the\nproblem of incompleteness, it is not very effective as an argument for\nthe referential analysis of descriptions. For example, at the crime\nscene Detective Brown may simply utter \u2018The murderer is\ninsane\u2019 failing to specify exactly which murderer he is talking\nabout (is it the murderer of Smith or Jones or \u2026?). But by\nhypothesis this case is a canonical example of an attributive use of a\ndefinite description. No reference is possible, so how can appeal to\nreference bail us out? How can any of this be an argument for definite\ndescriptions being semantically referential?\n\nEven stronger, it appears that there are numerous examples involving\nquantified expressions that suffer the same fate as incomplete\ndescriptions. I can say \u2018Everyone came to the party\u2019, not\nintending to mean everyone in the world. Or I might say, as Yogi Berra\nonce did, \u2018Nobody goes there anymore, it\u2019s too\ncrowded\u2019. It certainly appears that what is going on in these\ncases is similar to the cases of incomplete definite descriptions and\nthat there should be a single strategy for accounting for these\ndifferent cases of \u201cincompleteness.\u201d\n\nDevitt (2004, 2007) and Reimer (1998) have argued that these cases are\ngenuinely different in kind. Their idea is that since definite\ndescriptions are regularly used to express singular thoughts, it\nstands to reason that the standard meaning of the definite description\nmust be referential. Schoubye (2011, ch. 3) has responded to this\nclaim arguing that it rests on mistaken assumptions about semantic\nprocessing and that in any case the line of reasoning would generalize\nso as to force a referential interpretation of most (possibly all) the\nother determiners (e.g. \u2018every\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019).\n\nAlternatively, some writers have argued that that the problem of\nincomplete definite descriptions can be accounted for if we pursue an\nappropriate theory of quantifier domain restriction. Stanley and\nSzab\u00f3 (2000), for example, take this approach, suggesting that\ncontext can restrict the domain of quantification. On their proposal,\ncontext can even shift within a sentence, allowing us to make sense of\nan utterance like \u2018The dogs barked at the dogs\u2019, where I\nmean to say that one group of dogs barked while the other group\nperhaps suffered in silence. (Their proposal is applicable to all\nquantified expressions; not just the theory of descriptions. See Bach\n(2000), Neale (2000b), and Lepore (2004) for a more general discussion\nof the proposal.)\n\nIt is important to note (following Szab\u00f3 (2000) and Ludlow and\nSegal (2004) that even with a fully functional account of quantifier\ndomain restriction there is a lingering problem here too. Let\u2019s\ncall it the residue of the incompleteness problem. Consider\ncases like (38)\n\n(38) I put the book on the book.\n\n\nOn the domain restriction proposal, the first use of \u2018the\nbook\u2019 cannot have the same domain of quantification as the\nsecond use, since that would put two books in the domain of\nquantification and it would mean that both descriptions in the\nsentence are incomplete. But one wonders how legitimate a domain-shift\nanalysis is here. Is there really a shift in the domain of\nquantification between the first utterance of \u2018the book\u2019\nand the second utterance of that noun phrase? What would count as\nindependent evidence either for, or against, a domain-shift taking\nplace?\n",
