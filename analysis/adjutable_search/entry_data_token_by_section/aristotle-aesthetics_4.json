    "main_text": "The Poetics: How to Understand Poetry ? || Comedy\n3.3 Comedy\n\nMany if not most scholars seem to consider tragedy to be the best\npossible kind of poetry in Aristotle\u2019s eyes. But Aristotle never\nsuggests that; on the contrary, he insists that tragedy and comedy,\neach constituting a fully enactive mimesis, are the most\nperfect genres of poetry, each one corresponding to our natural\ninclinations for tears and laughter. Whereas the tragic poet must\nproduce strong emotions in order to enjoy a tragic play, the comic\npoet must produce amusement, which finds its physical expression in\nlaughter. (Also, as a few lines from the neo-platonists Iamblichus and\nProclus forcefully suggest, it might well be the case that Aristotle\nthought there was a katharsis in comedy as well, which would\nperfectly fit the last proposed interpretation: a comic\nkatharsis would just amount to the expression or the outlet\nof\n laughter.)[8]\n\nIn chapter 5 of our Poetics, Aristotle presents comedy with\nthese terse words: \n\n\nComedy, as we have already said, is the representation of men of\nlesser value, but not in a sense that would imply all defects:\nridicule is only a part of what is shameful. What makes people laugh\nis indeed a form of error or physical ugliness which does not cause\nsuffering or death, as is immediately seen from a comedy mask: it is\nsomething ugly and deformed, but which does not express any suffering.\n(1449a32\u201337) \n\n\nScholars have often drawn on the idea that aggressiveness or, as\nBergson would say, \u201cmalice\u201d, would be at the heart of\ncomedy as Aristotle sees it. And indeed, this is already what Plato\ndefends in a famous passage of the Philebus (47d-50b): it\nwould be phthonos (an emotion that is often translated as\n\u201cmalice\u201d or \u201cill will\u201d, but that designates\nabove all \u201cenvy\u201d) that would be the hidden cause of our\nlaughter (Imagine your neighbor, whose new Ferrari you envy,\ninadvertently crashing it into his garage door: the strength of your\nlaughter would be proportional to your\n envy!).[9]\n\nBut let us return to the example of the comedy he mentions in\nPoetics 13, where spectators see Orestes ending up being\nreconciled with Aegisthes. What makes them laugh at that ending?\nUndoubtedly, the ancient spectators must have felt a sense of\nindignation: not avenging one\u2019s father by killing his murderer\nis a moral fault. But it cannot be indignation that causes them to\nlaugh (if anything, indignation provokes anger, not amusement). What\nmakes them laugh, rather, is the complete oddity of such a\nreconciliation, its sheer incongruity. So more generally, one may\nsuppose, what makes one laugh is the incongruity of the blunders of\nthe characters on stage, perhaps coupled with their ugliness (which is\nmoreover accentuated by the mask the actors wear). That these\ncharacters must be \u201cinferior\u201d is a psychological\nrequirement that is the opposite of that of tragedy: if we can only\nfeel fear and pity towards a hero who does not deserve his fate, we\nreadily laugh at a man full of himself who slips on a banana peel.\nSimilarly, Aristotle\u2019s insists that a character\u2019s blunders\nmust not cause him to suffer, and that therefore a comedy cannot end\nwith the characters\u2019 misfortune or death. That would not be\nfunny: a comedy in which the arrogant character killed himself on a\nbanana peel would end our amusement (provided we are average, morally\ngood people). And this also implies that our negative feelings towards\nsuch characters, made up of a certain contempt and perhaps a feeling\nof superiority (as Hobbes would say), is really just a kind of game:\nwe do not feel any real animosity or condescension towards comedy\ncharacters. If we really felt indignation when attending that comedy\nof Orestes, we would not be able to laugh.\n\nIn the third book of the Rhetoric, dedicated to the figures\nof speech, Aristotle recalls that in his Poetics, presumably\nin its second book on comedy, he spoke of different \u201ctypes of\njokes\u201d (III 18, 1419b6\u20137). There is perhaps a difference\nof emphasis on this point between comedy and tragedy. If a comedy must\nalso have a good plot, having good jokes is essential: \n\n\nIt is especially in regard to these [funny comparisons] that poets\nfail with the public if they do not make them well, and if they do\nmake them well, that they are popular. (11, 1413a10\u201311) \n\n\nIt is impossible to reconstruct what exactly those \u201ctypes of\njokes\u201d would have been. But in his treatment there of the\nfigures of speech, Aristotle evokes those that the comic poet uses.\nThe central idea that emerges is that of incongruity. Aristotle argues\nthat a serious speech that wants to persuade its listeners must use a\n\u201csuitable\u201d, or \u201cappropriate\u201d style, where the\nwords chosen are \u201cin proportion\u201d (to analogon) to\nthe things they signify. If there is disproportion, or what we call\n\u201cincongruity\u201d, that speech\u2019s style will be\n\u201clike that of comedy\u201d. And to exemplify what he seriously\nstates, Aristotle makes a joke at the expenses of a tragedy writer, a\ncertain Cleophon, whose style was (at least in Aristotle\u2019s eyes)\nrather like a comedy writer\u2019s: \u201cSome of his expressions\nwere like saying: august fig tree\u201d (III 7, 1408a10\u201316).\nThis expression is funny (and not at all appropriate to the tragic\nstyle), because there is a total incongruity between this adjective\nwhich is normally reserved for a goddess or a queen, and that tree\nwhich, in ancient Greece, was considered of little value.\n\nIn the case of tragedy, Aristotle\u2019s aim is to reconstruct for\nhis readers what the art of poetic composition should be, in order to\nenable them to distinguish a good tragedy from a bad one and to\nexplain why. There is no reason to think that this should not also\nhave been his goal in writing on comedy. We have no direct echo of\nthis in our Poetics, but a passage from the Nicomachean\nEthics provides a clue worth following. It comes from the chapter\ndevoted to the virtue of \u201csense of humor\u201d\n(eutrapelia), which consists in being able to make good jokes\namong friends as well as in being able to take mockery against oneself\nwith good grace. It is in this context that we read this statement:\n\n\n\nThe amusement of the free man is very different from that of the\nslave, that of the educated man from that of an uneducated man. This\ncan be seen also in the ancient and recent comedies: in the former,\nwhat makes one laugh is obscene language, in the latter, it is rather\nthe innuendos (huponoia), and this difference is not small in\nview of elegance (eusch\u00eamosun\u00ea). (IV 8,\n1128a20\u201325) \n\n\nTo be sure, this is an analogy that is intended to make clear what\nkind of jokes decent citizens should make or hear in the real world.\nBut this analogy also reveals the normative judgment that Aristotle\nsuggests when it comes to theater: good comedy, that which is intended\nfor educated audiences, should use innuendo and allusion, not obscene\nlanguage. This is not an ethical normativity, but a normativity\nintrinsic to the art of making people laugh. Jokes that use crude and\nobscene language are what might be called \u201ceasy jokes\u201d,\nwhich require no originality and inventiveness on the part of the\njokester. On the contrary, good jokes must be \u201crefined\u201d,\nor \u201celegant\u201d, which show a good, truly incongruous and\nsophisticated use of the figures of\n speech.[10]\n",
