    "main_text": "Mind and Language || Sense and Imagination\n2.1 Sense and Imagination\n\nHobbes is a sort of empiricist, in that he thinks all of our ideas are\nderived, directly or indirectly, from\n sensation.[2]\n In addition he tells a causal story about perception, which is\nlargely the story of a causal chain of motions. The object causes\n(immediately or mediately) pressure on the sense organ, which causes\nmotion inside us, all the way to the \u201cbrain and heart\u201d.\nThere this motion causes \u201ca resistance, or counter-pressure, or\nendeavour of the heart to deliver itself; which endeavour, because\noutward, seemeth to be some matter without. And this\nseeming, or fancy, is that which men call\nsense\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 1.4). Quite why this endeavour from inside\nto out should make the sensation seem to come from outside is unclear,\nfor things coming from outside should be moving the other way. At any\nrate, the sensation is strongly grounded in, perhaps even identical\nwith, the internal motions. But what, we might ask, is the quality?\nWhat is, say, red? In this chapter Hobbes seems happy to say that red\nin the object is just motions in it, and that red in us is motions in\nus, which give rise to or are a certain sensation. And he seems happy\nto avoid the issue of whether red itself belongs to the sensation or\nthe object. In the Elements of Law, however, he had proposed\nthe Galilean view that colours inhere in perceivers, not in the\nobjects perceived (Hobbes 1640, 2.4)\n\nImagination is Hobbes\u2019s next topic. His basic thought is that\nour sensations remain after the act of sensing, but in a weaker way:\n\u201cafter the object is removed, or the eye shut, we still retain\nan image of the thing seen, though more obscure than when we see\nit\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.2). This is a story about how we form ideas.\nMore generally, imagination has a crucial role in Hobbes\u2019s\npicture of the workings of the mind. One sort of imagination is what\nwe would now call imagination, \u201cas when from the sight of a man\nat one time, and of a horse at another, we conceive in our mind a\nCentaur\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.4). That is, we can take the ideas, the\nfaded sensations, from different experiences and combine them\ntogether. But Hobbes also connects imagination, and \u201cthe faculty\nof imagining\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.10) closely to memory and to\nunderstanding. Imagination and memory, Hobbes says, are the same\nthing, with two names that point to different aspects of the\nphenomenon of decaying sense. If we want to point to the idea or image\nitself, we use \u2018imagination\u2019, but if we want to point to\nthe decay, we use \u2018memory\u2019 (Hobbes 1651, 2.3).\n\nMoreover, Hobbes thinks that understanding is a sort of imagination.\nThat is, the faculty of imagining is responsible for understanding, as\nwell as for compounding images and for memory. Understanding is,\nHobbes says, \u201c[t]he imagination that is raised in man (or any\nother creature endued with the faculty of imagining) by words or other\nvoluntary signs\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.10). Understanding is not\nrestricted to humans. So, for example, \u201ca dog by custom will\nunderstand the call \u2026 of its master\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.10).\nBut humans have a sort of understanding that other creatures lack. A\ndog, for instance, can understand the will of its owner, say that its\nowner wants it to sit down. In general, the understanding that\nnon-human animals can have is the understanding of will. But humans\ncan also understand the \u201cconceptions and thoughts\u201d (Hobbes\n1651, 2.10) of others from their uses of language.\n\nUnderstanding is for Hobbes the work of the faculty of imagination,\nand crucially involves language. An account of the workings of\nlanguage is thus crucial for his having an account of the workings of\nthe mind. For Hobbes, the mind contains sense, imagination, and the\nworkings of language, and no further rational faculty, such as the\nCartesian immaterial mind that can grasp natures by clear and distinct\nperception. His story about sensation, the formation of ideas, and the\nworkings of imagination is supposed to explain how some of our thought\nworks. But only with the further story about language and\nunderstanding in place does he have a full alternative to\nDescartes\u2019s story about our cognitive faculties. For Descartes,\nsense and imagination are, as in Hobbes\u2019s story, closely\nconnected to the workings of the brain, but higher cognitive functions\nare performed by the immaterial mind. Hobbes denies the existence of\nthat immaterial mind, and needs other accounts of those functions.\nThis \u2013 combined no doubt with some independent interest in the\ntopic \u2013 leads to Hobbes devoting a fair amount of attention to\nissues in the philosophy of language.\n",
