    "main_text": "Causal Modeling || The Minimality and Faithfulness Conditions\n3.4 The Minimality and Faithfulness Conditions\n\nThe MC states a sufficient condition but not a necessary condition for\nconditional probabilistic independence. As such, the MC by itself can\nnever entail that two variables are conditionally or unconditionally\ndependent. The Minimality and Faithfulness Conditions are two\nprinciples that posit necessary conditions for probabilistic\nindependence. The terminology comes from Spirtes et al. (2000). Pearl\nprovides analogous conditions with different terminology.\n\n(i) The Minimality Condition. Suppose that the acyclic\ndirected graph \\(\\bG\\) on variable set \\(\\bV\\) satisfies MC with\nrespect to the probability distribution P. The Minimality Condition\nasserts that no sub-graph of \\(\\bG\\) over \\(\\bV\\) also satisfies the\nMarkov Condition with respect to P. (A subgraph of \\(\\bG\\) is a graph\nover \\(\\bV\\) that results from removing arrows from \\(\\bG)\\). As an\nillustration, consider the variable set \\(\\{X, Y\\}\\), let there be an\narrow from X to Y, and suppose that X and\nY are probabilistically independent of each other according to\nprobability function P. This graph would satisfy the MC with respect\nto P: none of the independence relations mandated by the MC are absent\n(in fact, the MC mandates no independence relations). But this graph\nwould violate the Minimality Condition with respect to P, since the\nsubgraph that omits the arrow from X to Y would also\nsatisfy the MC. The Minimality Condition implies that if there is an\narrow from X to Y, then X makes a probabilistic\ndifference for Y, conditional on the other parents of Y.\nIn other words, if \\(\\bZ = \\PA(Y) \\setminus \\{X\\}\\), there exist\n\\(\\bz\\), y, x, \\(x'\\) such that \n\n \\[\\PP(Y = y \\mid X = x \\amp \\bZ = \\bz) \\ne \\PP(Y = y \\mid X = x' \\amp \\bZ = \\bz).\\]\n\n\n(ii) The Faithfulness Condition. The Faithfulness Condition\nsays that all of the (conditional and unconditional) probabilistic\nindependencies that exist among the variables in \\(\\bV\\) are\nrequired by the MC. For example, suppose that \\(\\bV = \\{X, Y,\nZ\\}\\). Suppose also that X and Y are unconditionally\nindependent of one another, but dependent, conditional upon Z.\n(The other two variable pairs are dependent, both conditionally and\nunconditionally.) The graph shown in\n Figure 8\n does not satisfy the faithfulness condition with respect to this\ndistribution (colloquially, the graph is not faithful to the\ndistribution). MC, when applied to the graph of\n Figure 8,\n does not imply the independence of X and Y. By\ncontrast, the graph shown in\n Figure 6\n above is faithful to the described distribution. Note that\n Figure 8\n does satisfy the Minimality Condition with respect to the\ndistribution; no subgraph satisfies MC with respect to the described\ndistribution. In fact, the Faithfulness Condition is strictly stronger\nthan the Minimality Condition.\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nThe Faithfulness Condition implies that the causal influences of one\nvariable on another along multiple causal routes do not\n\u2018cancel\u2019. In Figure 8, X influences Y along\ntwo different directed paths. If the effect of one path is to exactly\nundo the influence along the other path, then X and Y\nwill be probabilistically independent. The Faithfulness Condition\nforbids such exact cancellation. This \u2018no canceling\u2019\ncondition seems implausible as a metaphysical or conceptual constraint\nupon the connection between causation and probabilities. For example,\nif one gene codes for the production of a particular protein, and\nsuppresses another gene that codes for the same protein, the operation\nof the first gene will be independent of the presence of the protein.\nCartwright (2007: chapter 6) and Andersen (2103) argue that violations\nof faithfulness are widespread.\n\nThe Faithfulness Condition is a methodological principle\nrather than a metaphysical principle. Given a distribution on \\(\\{X,\nY, Z\\}\\) in which X and Y are independent, we should\ninfer that the causal structure is that depicted in\n Figure 6,\n rather than\n Figure 8.\n This is not because\n Figure 8\n is conclusively ruled out by the distribution, but rather because it\nis preferable to postulate a causal structure that implies\nthe independence of X and Y rather than one that is\nmerely consistent with independence.\n",
