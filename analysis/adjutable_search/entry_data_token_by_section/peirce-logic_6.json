    "main_text": "From Symbolic to Iconic Representation || Beta system\n2.3 Beta system\n\nIn\n \u00a71.1,\n we showed that formalizing relations was a key motivation behind\nPeirce\u2019s new logic\u2014first-order logic. In\n \u00a72.1,\n we established a connection between Peirce\u2019s own pragmatic\nmaxim and his graphic representation of relations. Peirce did not aim\nto present a new logic by inventing a graphic system, but rather to\npresent another new notation for the logic carried out by quantifiers\nand bound variables. He almost took it for granted that a graphic\nrepresentation of relations helps us observe their consequences in a\nmore efficient way. Hence, the Beta system may be considered to be the\nfinal stop of Peirce\u2019s long journey to search for better\nnotation for the logic of relations, which started in 1870 at the\n latest.[34]\n\nWe will not go into the formal details of the Beta system in this\nentry but will instead refer to Chapter 5 of Shin, where three\nslightly different approaches to Beta graphs\u2014Zeman\u2019s,\nRoberts\u2019, and Shin\u2019s\u2014are discussed at a full length.\nWhile Zeman\u2019s reading is comprehensive and formal,\nRoberts\u2019 method seems to appeal to a more intuitive\nunderstanding of the system. Taking advantage of the merits of these\ntwo existing works, Shin developed a new reading method of Beta graphs\nand reformulated the transformation rules of the\n system.[35]\n Her approach focuses on visual features of Beta graphs and highlights\nfundamental differences between symbolic versus diagrammatic systems.\nIn the remaining part of the entry, we would like to examine how the\nessence of the logic of relations is graphically represented in the\nBeta system so that the reader may place EG in the larger context of\nPeirce\u2019s enterprise.\n\nThe introduction of quantifiers and bound variables is believed to be\none of the key steps of first-order logic in symbolic systems. This is\nwhy some logicians take Peirce\u2019s 1885 paper \u201cOn the\nAlgebra of Logic: A contribution to the Philosophy of Notations\u201d\nto be the birthplace of modern logic. If this is the case, then how\ndoes Peirce represent quantifiers and bound variables in Beta\ngraphs?\n\nInterestingly enough, when Peirce considered a graphic system his\nfirst concern was representation of relations, not representation of\nquantifiers. As we said in \u00a73.1, Peirce presented diagrammatic\nrepresentation based on an analogy to chemical molecules for a full\nunderstanding of relations. Hence, the arity of a predicate is\nrepresented by the number of lines radiating from the predicate term.\nNext, Peirce extends the use of a line to connect predicates:\n\n\nIn many reasonings it becomes necessary to write a copulative\nproposition in which two members relate to the same individual so as\nto distinguish these members.\u2026 [I]t is necessary that the signs\nof them should be connected in fact. No way of doing this can be more\nperfectly iconic than that exemplified in [the following graph]:\n\n\n\n\n(1903b [CP 4.442])\n\n\nThe line connecting two predicates, representing one and the\nsame object, is called a line of identity by Peirce.\nThat is, the sameness is represented visually in Beta\n diagrams.[36]\n In the case of a symbolic language, we may adopt one and the same\nquantified variable-type to represent the identity. For example, the\nabove diagram says \\(\\exists x(x <A \\ \\land \\ B < x)\\), and\nhence, the variable-type \\(x\\) (roughly) corresponds to the identity\nline. However, the same variable-type is not sufficient for expressing\nthe sameness in other cases, e.g., \\(\\exists x(x <A \\ \\land \\ B\n< x) \\rightarrow \\exists x (x < C)\\).\n\nThe way universal and existential statements are represented in the\nBeta system highlights a difference between graphic and symbolic\nsystems. Rather than adopting one more syntactic device for\nquantification, Peirce relies on the following visual features:\n\n\n[A]ny line of identity whose outermost part is evenly enclosed refers\nto something, and any one whose outermost part is\noddly enclosed refers to anything there may be.\n(1903b [CP\n 4.458][37])\n\n\nLet us borrow the two following graphs from Roberts (1973:\n 51):[38]\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph (where the outermost part of the line is evenly, zero,\nenclosed) says that something good is ugly, and the second graph\n(where the outermost part is enclosed once) says that everything good\nis\n ugly.[39]\n\nHow about the scope problem which arises when multiple quantifiers are\nused? In the case of a symbolic system, the linear order takes care of\nthe problem. Peirce\u2019s solution for EG is to read off another\nkind of visuality: The less enclosed the outermost part of a line is,\nthe larger the scope that the line gets.\n\nRoberts\u2019 following example illustrates the scope matter nicely\n(1973: 52):\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph says  \n\n\\[\\forall x (\\textit{Catholic}(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y [\\textit{Adores} (x,y) \\land \\textit{Woman}(y)])\\]\n\n\nand the second  \n\n\\[\\exists y (\\textit{Woman}(y) \\land  \\forall x [\\textit{Catholic}(x) \\rightarrow  \\textit{Adores} (x,y)]).\\]\n\n\nIn the first graph, the line whose outermost part is oddly enclosed is\nless enclosed than the line whose outermost part is evenly enclosed.\nTherefore, the universal quantifier has larger scope than the\nexistential quantifier. In the second graph, it is the other way\naround.\n\nLet us summarize three interesting features of the Beta system:\n\n\n\nRelations are represented graphically, not symbolically, in the Beta\nsystem, in terms of a line. We argued that ultimately Peirce\u2019s\npragmatic maxim was behind this alternative way of\nrepresentation.\n\n\nA distinction between universal versus existential statements is\nrepresented by the visual fact about whether the outermost part of a\nline lies in an area enclosed either by an odd number or by even\nnumber of cuts.\n\n\nThe order of quantification is represented by the following visuality:\nThe less enclosed a line is, the more extensive scope it has.\n\n",
