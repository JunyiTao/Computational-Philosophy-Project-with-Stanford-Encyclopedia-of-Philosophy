    "main_text": "The Cross-Cultural Legacy of the Kyoto School || Between and Beyond East and West\n5.1 Between and Beyond East and West\n\nIn this concluding section, let us return to the question of the\nlegacy of the Kyoto School with regard to comparative or\ncross-cultural philosophy. Today many scholars, in Japan as well as in\nWestern countries, are calling this \u201cworld philosophy\u201d\n(It\u014d et al. 2020), a term I take to mean any approach to\nphilosophy that does not restrict its purview and the sources on which\nit draws to any one tradition, such as the tradition of Western\nphilosophy. As mentioned at the outset, the Kyoto School thinkers were\nall dedicated scholars of various fields and figures of Western\nphilosophy; and yet, at the same time, they kept one foot firmly in\ntouch with their native East Asian traditions, those of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in particular. This bipedal stance placed\nthem in an extraordinary position between \u201cEast and West\u201d\nand allowed them to go beyond this binary abstraction.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the philosophies of the Kyoto\nSchool do not simply drift impartially on the seas of academic\ncomparison, nor do the Kyoto School philosophers see themselves\nprimarily as mediators of interreligious dialogue. As existentially\nengaged cross-cultural philosophers, they are above all seekers after\ntruth, and they argue passionately for the validity of seeing the self\nand the world in certain ways. As we have seen, while each member of\nthe Kyoto School has his own vision of the truth, they share (and\ndebate) certain fundamental ideas, such as one or another version of\nthe core notion of absolute nothingness and the idea of coming to a\ngenuine self-awareness by way of emptying the ego. And however much\ntheir texts reflect an intimate dialogue with and critical\nappropriation of ideas from Western philosophers, it can be said that\nmany of their main theses nevertheless reflect a distinctly East Asian\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist and Japanese cultural influence.\n\nNevertheless, this does not mean that they merely gave modern\nexpression to traditional East Asian Buddhist thought or Japanese\nculture. It would be more accurate to say that their philosophies are\ncritical and creative developments of these\ntraditions. Even this way of putting it would not do justice to the\ninfluence exerted on their thought by the Western philosophies with\nwhich they grappled so intensely. Although Hisamatsu, Nishitani, Abe,\nUeda and others do explicitly philosophize from the standpoint of Zen,\nand although Takeuchi, Hase, and others do so from the standpoint of\nShin Buddhism, it would be misleading to simply and without\nqualification characterize either Nishida\u2019s or Tanabe\u2019s\nmultifaceted philosophies as \u201cEastern\u201d or\n\u201cBuddhist.\u201d\n\nFor example, Tanabe\u2019s early \u201clogic of the specific,\u201d\nwith its concern for the manner in which ethnic specificities mediate\nparticular individuals and universal humanity, can be read more as a\ncritical appropriation of Hegelian dialectical logic and political\nphilosophy than as any straightforward development of East Asian or\nBuddhist thought. And in his various later writings on the philosophy\nof religion, Tanabe wanders between a preference for Shin Buddhism,\nChristianity, and finally Zen Buddhism (see Himi 1990, 129\u2013341).\nWith regard to Nishida, an acute concern with questions of\nepistemology, logic, individual autonomy, creativity, and the\nhistoricity of the world are essential to his thought in ways that are\nmore \u201cmodern Western\u201d than \u201ctraditional\nEastern\u201d; and Nishida at times explicitly indicates his\ndissatisfaction with what he sees as related weaknesses in traditional\nEastern thought.\n\nOf course, one might respond: even if Nishida methodologically takes\nhis questions from Western philosophy, his responses to these\nquestions reflect his East Asian roots at least as much as his Western\nstudies. To the Western ontological question of being, his answer is a\nmeontology of absolute nothingness. It might be that his systematic\nphilosophical articulations of the idea of absolute nothingness owe\nmore to Western than Eastern texts. Yet, he nevertheless understands\nhimself to have autonomously (i.e., in the process of engaging in a\nnonsectarian philosophical search for truth) given expression to the\nformless origin that is harbored in the traditions of the East. In\nretrospect Nishida wrote: \u201cIt is not that I conceived of my way\nof thinking in dependence on Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism; and yet it\nhas come into accord with it\u201d (NKZ XIV, 408). Nishitani could\nhave said something similar of his career path, which led him through\nthe study of Western philosophy and mysticism and \u201cback\u201d\nto the standpoint of Zen. Other Kyoto School thinkers took even less\nof an Occidental excursion before making what H\u00f6lderlin called a\n\u201chomecoming though the foreign.\u201d And some, like Hisamatsu\nand Takeuchi, began their scholarly pursuits with a self-understanding\nas a Zen or Shin Buddhist thinker.\n\nPerhaps most controversial, from a cross-cultural political point of\nview, is Nishida\u2019s and other Kyoto School thinkers\u2019\nsuggestion that modern Japanese culture and philosophy in particular\nhas the potential to make room for the cooperative meeting of the\nstrengths of East and West (see NKZ XIV, 416\u201317; also Nishida\n1964, 365). What are we to make of such bold and sweeping claims?\nThere appear to be two problematical assertions involved: first, an\noverly generalized, if not at times hypostatized, split of cultural\nspheres into \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest\u201d; and second, a\nclaim that an idea with deeper roots in the so-called East, namely\nabsolute nothingness, can be developed so as to provide the\nphilosophical meeting place of both East and\n West.[18]\n\nEven sympathetic readers of the Kyoto School are often highly critical\nof this type of comparative thinking in terms of \u201cEast\u201d\n(t\u014dy\u014d) and \u201cWest\u201d\n(seiy\u014d). Although he affirms that \u201cthe\nKyoto-school philosophers give the west a way into the east like none\nother,\u201d James Heisig complains that \u201cthe East\u201d which\nthe Kyoto School sets up over against \u201cthe West\u201d is\nsomething of an invention: \u201cAt best, it is one constellation of\na heritage too long and too plural to be represented fairly by\nJapan\u201d (Heisig 2001, 271\u201372). John Maraldo goes further\nand claims that \u201cthe problems Nishida deals with are universal,\nand his way of dealing with them contrasts as much with other Asian\nphilosophers as with philosophers of the so-called West\u201d\n(Maraldo 1995, 196). Is it necessary and are we ready to do as Maraldo\nsuggests, and \u201cput \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West\u2019 to\nrest\u201d?\n\nI myself think this complex issue requires a careful and nuanced\nresponse, in part because \u201cthe East\u201d and \u201cthe\nWest\u201d are not in fact isomorphically oppositional terms. While I\ncertainly agree with the wish to avoid overgeneralizations and\npolitically charged polarizations, and while I think the Kyoto School\nphilosophers do need to be read critically in this regard, I am\nequally wary of a \u201cglobalization of thought\u201d that amounts\nto a de facto colonization of \u201cnon-Western\u201d traditions by\n\u201cWestern\u201d methods and categories of thinking; and simply\nrefraining from speaking of \u201cthe West\u201d could amount to\nmerely evading and thus exacerbating this problem. Moreover, while it\nis indeed important to debunk essentializing, homogenizing, and\nusually self-aggrandizing conceptions of \u201cthe West\u201d or\n\u201cWestern civilization,\u201d a tradition that has in truth been\nfar more fruitfully \u201centanlged\u201d with other traditions and\nfar more varied that historical narratives centered on a pantheon of\ngreat white men would have it (see Elberfeld 2017, 21\u2013127; Mac\nSweeney 2023), the threads of the\nGreco-Roman-Judeo-Christian-Euro-American traditions and cultures have\nnevertheless been woven together coherently enough to warrant\nsometimes and in some contexts speaking of \u201cthe West.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, \u201cthe East\u201d (or \u201cAsia\u201d for that\nmatter) is a more irredeemably problematic concept, since it refers to\na far less coherently woven set of traditions and cultures, especially\nfrom the perspective of India (which, for example, did not appropriate\nany Chinese tradition the way China appropriated Buddhism). Some may\nwant to argue that, from Japan\u2019s perspective, or at least from a\nJapanese Buddhist perspective that weaves together Indo-Sino-Japanese\nthreads, it may still make some sense to speak sometimes in terms of\n\u201cthe East.\u201d Yet such usages of this term are not only\novergeneralizing but also Japan-centric. I therefore think it is best\nto restrict our broadest generalizations in this case to \u201cEast\nAsia\u201d or \u201cMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism\u201d or\n\u201cJapan,\u201d and to bear in mind that even these expressions\nreduce a diverse manifold to a broad concept. The concept of\n\u201cthe East\u201d goes too far, crossing the line from a\nheuristically useful generalization to a distortingly homogenizing\novergeneralization.\n\nTo be sure, as Thomas Kasulis reminds us (Kasulis 2018, 36 and 41),\ngeneralizations are not universalizations; by definition there are\nexceptions to any general definition of something. The bigger the\ngeneralization, the more exceptions will it have. Still, we cannot\nthink without generalities, and it is no doubt a matter of\n\u201cpractical wisdom\u201d (phron\u0113sis) to know when\nto construct and when to deconstruct them. Thus, even though we must\nbe careful to discern the appropriate contexts in which it makes sense\nto speak in such vast and abstract terms, it is no more advisable to\nunequivocally annihilate general concepts such as \u201cthe\nWest\u201d and \u201cEast Asia\u201d than it is to narrowly define\nor absolutize their relative coherences and mutual differences.\n\nWith regard to the hermeneutics of modern cross-cultural thinking, in\ngeneral I believe that the attempt to obliterate the borders that\nseparate cultural spheres is as unrealistic and potentially pernicious\nas is the attempt to hermetically seal them up. Border lines between\ncultures (as between languages) exist, but they are always porous and\nshifting, and each culture is in itself varied and mobile. Needless to\nsay, defining, comparing, contrasting, and above all evaluating the\nrelative worth of various traditions, remain undertakings fraught with\ntheoretical, ethical and political pitfalls. The theoretical and\ncultural legacies of colonialism and Orientalism remain with us long\nafter the political empires have receded. Moreover, in these\npostcolonial or decolonial times we all too often experience reactive\nfabrications of homogeneous cultural identity and assertions of\ncounter-superiority, reactions which ironically reinforce the same\nkind of colonial divisions and obsessions with unadulterated\nself-identity that were in part imposed by, or imported from, the\nworst of the West.\n\nIn Japan, certain retroactive constructions of identity and reactive\ncounter-assertions of superiority have taken the form of what is\ncalled nihonjin-ron: theories of \u201cJapaneseness\u201d\nor \u201cJapanese uniqueness\u201d (see Dale 1986). In modern\nJapanese history, such reactive cultural self-obsessions and\nself-assertions have taken either the form of denying Japan\u2019s\ndeep-rooted traditional connections with its East Asian neighbors, or\nthe form of claiming that Japan has uniquely embodied and perfected\n\u201cthe essence of the East.\u201d If the former type of claim is\nmost in evidence in postwar and contemporary Japan, the latter is\nfound, for example, in the Meiji thinker Okakura Tenshin\u2019s\ndeclaration that, while \u201cAsia is one,\u201d Japan alone is\n\u201cthe real repository of the trust of Asiatic thought and\nculture\u201d (Okakura 2000, 1 and 5).\n\nWhere do the Kyoto School thinkers stand with respect to such culture\nwars? To be sure, the Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions in\nparticular often asserted that modern Japan was uniquely suited to\ninstitute and represent the \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity\nSphere,\u201d and this undoubtedly reflected a widespread post-Meiji\nJapanese conflation of political, industrial, and military development\nwith cultural superiority. Nishida also felt that modern Japan was in\na unique political and cultural position to host a fruitful marriage\nof East and West, and Tanabe went so far as to set the nation of Japan\nup as an archetype for others. In the Kyoto School\u2019s wartime\npolitical writings, there indeed remains much grist for the mills of\ncontemporary cultural critics, especially for those with hermeneutical\nblindfolds or purportedly perfect hindsight. Yet a critique of their\npolitical misadventures and cultural assertions, as necessary as it\nis, may in fact reveal something more peripheral than central to the\ncross-cultural thinking of the Kyoto School. It is at least necessary\nto keep both eyes open: one ready to criticize and the other willing\nto learn.\n\nWe should note that even when Nishida broadly contrasts \u201cWestern\nbeing\u201d with \u201cEastern nothingness,\u201d he in fact\nimmediately goes on to explore finer distinctions between the Greek,\nRoman, and Judeo-Christian threads of the Western tradition, and\nbetween the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese threads of the Eastern\ntradition. If his essentializing or overgeneralizing of these threads\ndoes remain in various respects problematic, it is nevertheless hardly\nthe case that he and the other Kyoto School thinkers never questioned\nthe homogeneity of either \u201cthe East\u201d or \u201cthe\nWest.\u201d Secondly, although they have been accused both of\ncontributing to the \u201cmyth of Japanese uniqueness\u201d and of\n\u201creverse Orientalism\u201d (see Dale 1986 and Faure 1995), the\ncase is far from this simple. In a time of uncritical cultural\nself-adulation by the Japanese ultranationalists in power, Nishida\nboldly urged that \u201cboth the strong points and weaknesses of our\nculture should be openly and honestly pointed out,\u201d for\n\u201cwe cannot take any one culture and call it the\nculture\u201d (Nishida 1964, 351 and 353).\n\nFighting a conceptual war simultaneously on two fronts, against\nWestern and Japanese ethnocentrisms, Nishida wrote that\n\u201cuntil now Westerners have thought that their own culture is the\nmost superior human culture that exists, and that human culture\ninevitably develops in the direction of their own culture\u2014hence,\nas Easterners and other peoples who are lagging behind advance\nforward, they must become the same as [Westerners].\u201d Even some\nJapanese, he regrets, think this way. And yet, he objects,\n\u201cthere is something radically different in [the culture of] the\nEast.\u201d According to Nishida, the development of the West will\nsubsume this difference no more than the East will subsume the West.\nEven if humanity does share a common root (what he calls, adapting an\nexpression from Goethe, an \u201cur-culture\u201d of multiple\npossibilities), the development of its branches and leaves is a matter\nof diversification, not homogenization. Globalization should thus be\nthought of, in Nishida\u2019s vision, as many branches of the same\ntree supplementing one other on the basis of both their deep-rooted\ncommonality and their irreducible diversity (NKZ XIV,\n402\u20136 and 417).\n\nTo be sure, there inevitably remains for us the question of the\n\u201cplace\u201d and manner in which this global communication\nbetween cultures should take place. But without a \u201cview from\nnowhere,\u201d the only thing we can do is to attempt to critically\nand creatively take up ideas that have particular genealogies and\ndialogically develop them into what are provisionally more universally\nviable forms. Just as concepts of democracy, hermeneutics, and indeed\nphilosophia itself have particular cultural lineages, so do\nthe ideas of emptiness (Japanese: k\u016b; Sanskrit:\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), nothingness (Japanese: mu;\nChinese: wu), and the true self (shin no jiko) as a\nnon-ego (Japanese: muga; Sanskrit: an\u0101tman)\nthat opens itself to an encounter with others by radically emptying\nitself. Nevertheless, all of these ideas may very well contribute\nsomething to an intercultural dialogue concerning the very place and\nmanner in which a genuine encounter between cultures and individuals\ncan and should take place. The locution \u201cworld philosophy\u201d\nis, to my mind, best understood as a multifaceted forum for\ncross-cultural dialogue concerning such issues, a forum that is itself\nalways in the process of being co-constructed by all those who\nparticipate in it.\n",
