    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Generic Absoluteness\n4.4  Generic Absoluteness\n\nLarge cardinal axioms have the fruitful consequence that they imply\naxioms of definable determinacy and hence illuminate the structure\ntheory of definable sets of reals. In fact,\nADL(\u211d) appears to be \u201ceffectively\ncomplete\u201d with regard to questions\nconcerning L(\u211d). Let us try to make this precise in terms\nof generic absoluteness. \n\n The motivating result in this area is the following: \n\n Theorem 4.9 (Shoenfield). Assume ZFC. Suppose \u03d5 is a \u03a312 sentence and B is a complete Boolean algebra. Then\nV \u22a7 \u03d5 iff VB \u22a7 \u03d5.\n\n\n\nIn other words,\nthe \u03a312-theory\ncannot be altered by the method of outer models. In such a situation\nwe say that \u03d5 is generically absolute. Since our main\nmethod of establishing independence (without leaving an\ninterpretability degree) is the method of outer models, this explains\nwhy there are no\nknown \u03a312\nstatements that lie in the interpretability degree of ZFC and are\nknown to be independent of ZFC. \n\n A fruitful consequence of large cardinal axioms is that they place\nus in exactly this situation with regard to a much larger class of\nstatements (see Larson (2004) for an account of this result). \n\n Theorem 4.10 (Woodin). Assume  ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose  \u03d5 is a sentence and B is a complete Boolean algebra. Then\nL(\u211d)V \u22a7 \u03d5 iff L(\u211d)VB \n\u22a7 \u03d5.\n\n\n\n\n In this situation one, of course, has\nADL(\u211d). Again, one might be concerned that one\ncan have this fruitful consequence without having\nADL(\u211d). This is addressed by the following\ntheorem: \n\n Theorem 4.11 (Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of strongly inaccessible cardinals. Suppose that the theory of L(\u211d) is generically absolute. Then ADL(\u211d).  \n\n\n Summary: There is a \u201cgood theory\u201d (one that freezes\nthe theory of L(\u211d)) and (granting a proper class of\nstrongly inaccessible cardinals) all good theories imply\nADL(\u211d). \n",
