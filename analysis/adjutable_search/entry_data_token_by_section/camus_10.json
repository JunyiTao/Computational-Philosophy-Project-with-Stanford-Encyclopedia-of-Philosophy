    "main_text": "Camus and the World of Violence: The Rebel || Against Communism\n4.2 Against Communism\n\nCamus\u2019s hostility to Communism had its personal, political, and\nphilosophical reasons. These certainly reached back to his expulsion\nfrom the Communist Party in the mid-1930s for refusing to adhere to\nits Popular Front strategy of playing down French colonialism in\nAlgeria in order to win support from the white working class. Then,\nmaking no mention of Marxism, The Myth of Sisyphus is\neloquently silent on its claims to present a coherent understanding of\nhuman history and a meaningful path to the future. His mutually\nrespectful relations with Communists during the Resistance and the\nimmediate postwar period turned bitter after he was attacked in the\nCommunist press and repaid the attack in a series of newspaper\narticles in 1946 entitled \u201cNeither Victims nor\nExecutioners\u201d (Aronson, 2004, 66\u201393).\n\nIn The Rebel Camus insisted that both Communism\u2019s\nappeal and its negative features sprang from the same irrepressible\nhuman impulse: faced with absurdity and injustice, humans refuse to\naccept their existence and instead seek to remake the world.\nValidating revolt as a necessary starting point, Camus criticizes\npolitics aimed at building a utopian future, affirming once more that\nlife should be lived in the present and in the sensuous world. He\nexplores the history of post-religious and nihilistic intellectual and\nliterary movements; he attacks political violence with his views on\nlimits and solidarity; and he ends by articulating the metaphysical\nrole of art as well as a self-limiting radical politics. In place of\nstriving to transform the world, he speaks of\nm\u00e9sure\u2014\u201cmeasure\u201d, in the sense of\nproportion or balance\u2014and of living in the tension of the human\ncondition. He labels this outlook \u201cMediterranean\u201d in an\nattempt to anchor his views to the place he grew up and to evoke in\nhis readers its sense of harmony and appreciation of physical life.\nThere is no substantive argument for the label, nor is one possible\ngiven his method of simply selecting who and what counts as\nrepresentative of the \u201cMediterranean\u201d view while excluding\nothers\u2014e.g., some Greek writers, not many Romans. In place of\nargument, he paints a concluding vision of Mediterranean harmony that\nhe hopes will be stirring and lyrical, binding the reader to his\ninsights.\n\nAs a political tract The Rebel asserts that Communism leads\ninexorably to murder, and then explains how revolutions arise from\ncertain ideas and states of spirit. But he makes no close analysis of\nmovements or events, gives no role to material needs or oppression,\nand regards the quest for social justice as a metaphysically inspired\nattempt to replace \u201cthe reign of grace by the reign of\njustice\u201d (R, 56).\n\nFurthermore, Camus insists that these attitudes are built into\nMarxism. In \u201cNeither Victims nor Executioners\u201d he declared\nhimself a socialist but not a Marxist. He rejected the Marxist\nacceptance of violent revolution and the consequentialist maxim that\n\u201cthe end justifies the\n means.\u201d[3]\n \u201cIn the Marxian perspective,\u201d he wrote sweepingly,\n\u201ca hundred thousand deaths is a small price to pay for the\nhappiness of hundreds of millions\u201d (Camus 1991, 130). Marxists\nthink this, Camus asserted, because they believe that history has a\nnecessary logic leading to human happiness, and thus they accept\nviolence to bring it about.\n\nIn The Rebel Camus takes this assertion a further step:\nMarxism is not primarily about social change but is rather a revolt\nthat \u201cattempts to annex all creation.\u201d Revolution emerges\nwhen revolt seeks to ignore the limits built into human life. By an\n\u201cinevitable logic of nihilism\u201d Communism climaxes the\nmodern trend to deify man and to transform and unify the world.\nToday\u2019s revolutions yield to the blind impulse, originally\ndescribed in The Myth of Sisyphus, \u201cto demand order in\nthe midst of chaos, and unity in the very heart of the\nephemeral\u201d (MS, 10). As does the rebel who becomes a\nrevolutionary who kills and then justifies murder as legitimate.\n\nAccording to Camus, the execution of King Louis XVI during the French\nRevolution was the decisive step demonstrating the pursuit of justice\nwithout regard to limits. It contradicted the original life-affirming,\nself-affirming, and unifying purpose of revolt. This discussion\nbelongs to Camus\u2019s \u201chistory of European pride,\u201d\nwhich is prefaced by certain ideas from the Greeks and certain aspects\nof early Christianity, but begins in earnest with the advent of\nmodernity. Camus focuses on a variety of major figures, movements, and\nliterary works: the Marquis de Sade, romanticism, dandyism, The\nBrothers Karamazov, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, surrealism, the\nNazis, and above all the Bolsheviks. Camus describes revolt as\nincreasing its force over time and turning into an ever more desperate\nnihilism, overthrowing God and putting man in his place, wielding\npower more and more brutally. Historical revolt, rooted in\nmetaphysical revolt, leads to revolutions seeking to eliminate\nabsurdity by using murder as their central tool to take total control\nover the world. Communism is the contemporary expression of this\nWestern sickness.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Camus claims, murder has become\n\u201creasonable,\u201d \u201ctheoretically defensible,\u201d and\njustified by doctrine. People have grown accustomed to \u201clogical\ncrimes\u201d\u2014that is, mass death either planned or foreseen,\nand rationally justified. Thus Camus calls \u201clogical crime\u201d\nthe central issue of the time, seeks to \u201cexamine meticulously\nthe arguments by which it is justified\u201d (R, 3), and\nsets out to explore how the twentieth century became a century of\nslaughter.\n\nWe might justly expect an analysis of the arguments he speaks of, but\nThe Rebel changes focus. Human reason is confused by\n\u201cslave camps under the flag of freedom, massacres justified by\nphilanthropy or by a taste for the superhuman\u201d (R,\n4)\u2014the first two refer to Communism, the third to Nazism. In the\nbody of the text, Nazism virtually drops out (it was, he says, a\nsystem of \u201cirrational terror\u201d\u2014not at all what\ninterested Camus), sharply narrowing the inquiry. His shift is\nrevealed by his question: How can murder be committed with\npremeditation and be justified by philosophy? It turns out that the\n\u201crational murder\u201d Camus was concerned with is not\ncommitted by capitalists or democrats, colonialists or imperialists,\nor by Nazis\u2014but only by Communists.\n\nHe does not address the Holocaust, and although his had been a lone\nvoice of protest against Hiroshima in 1945, he does not now ask how it\nhappened. As a journalist he had been one of the few to indict French\ncolonialism, but he does not mention it, except in a footnote. How was\nit possible for Camus to focus solely on the violence of Communism,\ngiven the history he had lived, in the age of nuclear weapons, in the\nvery midst of the French colonial war in Vietnam, and when he knew\nthat a bitter struggle over Algeria lay ahead? It seems he became\nblinded by ideology, separating Communism from the other evils of the\ncentury and directing his animus there. Camus\u2019s ideas, of\ncourse, had developed and matured over the years since he first began\nwriting about revolt. But something else had happened: his agenda had\nchanged. Absurdity and revolt, his original themes, had been harnessed\nas an alternative to Communism, which had become the archenemy. Even\nas he rejected its violent confrontations, the philosophy of revolt\nbecame Cold-War ideology.\n\nBecause The Rebel claimed to describe the attitude that lay\nbehind the evil features of contemporary revolutionary politics, it\nbecame a major political event. Readers could hardly miss his\ndescription of how the impulse for emancipation turned into organized,\nrational murder as the rebel-become-revolutionary attempted to order\nan absurd universe. In presenting this message, Camus sought not so\nmuch to critique Stalinism as its apologists. His specific targets\nwere intellectuals attracted to Communism\u2014as he himself had been\nin the 1930s.\n\nOne of these targets was Jean-Paul Sartre, and toward the end of\nThe Rebel Camus now took aim at his friend\u2019s evolving\npolitics. Camus focuses on \u201cthe cult of history\u201d against\nwhich the entire book is directed and his belief that \u201cthe\nexistentialists,\u201d led by Sartre, had fallen victim to the idea\nthat revolt should lead to revolution. Within Camus\u2019s framework,\nSartre is challenged as trying, like the predecessors criticized in\nThe Myth of Sisyphus, to escape the absurdity with which his\nown thinking began by turning to \u201chistory,\u201d that is to\nMarxism. This is a bit of a stretch because Sartre was still several\nyears from declaring himself a Marxist, and it shows Camus\u2019s\ntendency towards sweeping generalization rather than close analysis.\nBut it also reflects his awareness that his friend was determined to\nfind a meaning in the world even as he himself foreswore doing so. And\nit shows his capacity for interpreting a specific disagreement in the\nbroadest possible terms\u2014as a fundamental conflict of\nphilosophies.\n",
