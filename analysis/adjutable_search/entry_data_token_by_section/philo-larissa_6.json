    "main_text": "Philosophy of Education\n4. Philosophy of Education\n\nIn defining the Academy only by its critical method, rather than also\nby its acceptance of any epistemological positions, Philo recognized a\nvalue in argument on either side that was independent of the\nconclusions or acts of suspension it yielded: its ability to cultivate\nin others autonomy in dialectical reasoning. In the periods of both\nhis mitigated skepticism and his fallibilism, Philo argued on either\nside in order to judge whether some philosophical view merited his\nassent (see\n sections 3.3\u20133.4).\n To this end he accepted rational norms of criticism (cf. D. Frede\n1996), so that he was obliged to disregard illicit sources of\npersuasion: e.g., performative aspects of a speaker\u2019s\npresentation of arguments, or a speaker\u2019s reputation (unless\ntheir reputation is cited as a reason for belief). Thus we find in\nPhilonian sources an analysis of the sources of authority and\narguments against epistemic deference (see Cicero Ac. 2.9,\n2.115 and Topica 72\u20138; cf. Sextus PH\n2.37\u201346 & M\u00a07.314\u201342). The evidence\nsuggests that Philo sought to protect auditors from his own authority,\nby concealing his judgments about arguments on either side. At any\nrate, Academics who are associated with Philo or the mitigated\nskepticism he popularized (e.g., Charmadas, Cicero, and Favorinus)\nconcealed their evaluations of arguments, on the grounds that their\nauditors would be better situated to follow the rational norms of\ncriticism (see Cicero On the Orator 1.84, Ac. 2.60,\nOn the Nature of the Gods 1.10\u201311, On\nDivination 2.150, Tusculan Disputations 5.11 & 5.83,\nOn Fate 1, and Galen On the Best Method of\nTeaching).\n\nPhilo\u2019s interest in students\u2019 autonomy in dialectical\ncriticism is most often related to his mitigated skepticism (Long\n& Sedley 1987, 1:449: Ioppolo 1993: 210; Brittain 2001:\n111\u20134; Tarrant 2018). As mentioned above, Philo\u2019s\neducational interests are shared by the Academics Charmadas (Cicero\nOn the Orator 1.84) and Favorinus (Galen On the Best\nMethod of Teaching), whom some identify as mitigated skeptics\n(see Brittain 2001: 213\u20134; Tarrant 1985: ch. 2 & 2018: 83;\nBrittain 2007: 302; Ioppolo 1993). And since the same concerns about\nrational norms carry over from Philo\u2019s mitigated skepticism to\nhis reconstructed fallibilism (see\n section 3.4),\n it is likely Philo retained this pedagogical view in his Roman Books\n(see also\n section 5).\n\nAlthough Philo\u2019s philosophy of education is identified most\nclosely with mitigated skepticism, its origin may also be tied to\nClitomachean radical skepticism. Scholarship on Cicero, our best\nsource for the defense of argument on either side on educational\ngrounds, has increasingly defended radically skeptical interpretations\nof some of his dialogues (Brittain 2016: Cappello 2019; Wynne 2018\n& 2021), and Cicero himself associates it with Arcesilaus and\nCarneades (see On Divination 2.150, Tusculan\nDisputations 5.11 & 5.83). It may seem that radical skeptics\nwould not have justified argument on either side for educational\nreasons because they argue for purely destructive ends. But one may\nthink that radical skepticism can ground a Socratic interest in\nothers\u2019 training in dialectic out of a hypothetical acceptance\nof rational norms (see Brittain 2005 [2008]). If this is right, then\nPhilo in the Roman Books had further cause for identifying its\ncritical method as the defining mark of the Academy.\n",
