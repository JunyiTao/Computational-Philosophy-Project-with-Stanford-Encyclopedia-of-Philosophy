    "main_text": "Philosophy of History\n9. Philosophy of History\n\nHerder\u2019s philosophy of history appears mainly in two works:\nfirst in This Too a Philosophy of History and then later in\nthe Ideas.\n\nHis philosophy of history is striking for its development of a\nteleological conception of history as the progressive realization of\n\u201creason\u201d and \u201chumanity\u201d\u2014a conception\nthat anticipated and strongly influenced Hegel, among others. However,\nthis conception is dubious on reflection, and is arguably not\none of Herder\u2019s most intrinsically important achievements in\nthis area.\n\nHis most intrinsically important achievement arguably instead lies in\nhis development of the thesis already mentioned\nearlier\u2014contradicting such Enlightenment philosopher-historians\nas Hume and Voltaire\u2014that there exist radical mental differences\nbetween different historical periods (and cultures), that\npeople\u2019s concepts, beliefs, values, sensations, and so on differ\nin deep ways from one period (or culture) to another. This thesis is\nalready prominent in On the Change of Taste (1766) and it\nendures throughout Herder\u2019s career (albeit with some periods of\ndoubt or ambivalence). It had an enormous influence on successors such\nas the Schlegel brothers, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Nietzsche, and\nDilthey.\n\nHerder makes the empirical exploration of the realm of mental\ndiversity posited by this thesis the very core of the discipline of\nhistory. For, as has often been noted, he takes relatively little\ninterest in the so-called \u201cgreat\u201d political and military\ndeeds and events of history, focusing instead on the\n\u201cinnerness\u201d of history\u2019s participants. This choice\nis quite deliberate and self-conscious. Because of it, psychology\nand interpretation inevitably take center-stage as methods in the\ndiscipline of historiography for Herder.\n\nHerder has deep philosophical reasons for this choice, and hence for\nassigning psychology and interpretation a central role in\nhistoriography. To begin with, he has negative reasons\ndirected against traditional political-military historiography. Why\nshould historiography focus on the \u201cgreat\u201d\npolitical and military deeds and events of the past, after all? There\nare several possible answers: (1) A first would be that they are\nfascinating or morally edifying. But Herder will not accept this. For\none thing, he denies that mere fascination or curiosity is a\nsufficiently serious motive for doing historiography. For another\nthing, his antiauthoritarianism, antimilitarism, and borderless\nhumanitarianism cause him to find the acts of political domination,\nwar, and empire that make up the vast bulk of these\n\u201cgreat\u201d deeds and events not morally edifying but morally\nrepugnant.\n\nThis leaves two other types of motivation that might be appealed to\nfor doing the sort of historiography in question: (2) because\nexamining the course of such deeds and events reveals some sort of\noverall meaning in history, or (3) because it leads to\nefficient causal insights that enable us to explain the past and\nperhaps also predict or control the future. Herder is again\nskeptical about these rationales, however. This skepticism is perhaps\nclearest in the Older Critical Forestlet (1767\u20138)\nwhere, in criticism of rationale (2), he consigns the task of\n\u201cthe whole ordering together of many occurrences into a\nplan\u201d not to the historian but instead to the \u201ccreator,\n\u2026 painter, and artist\u201d, and in criticism of rationale\n(3), he goes as far as to assert (on the basis of a Hume- and\nKant-influenced general skepticism about causal knowledge) that with\nthe search for efficient causes in history \u201chistorical seeing\nstops and prophecy begins\u201d. His later writings depart from this\nearly position in some obvious ways, but they also in important ways\nremain faithful to it. (For further details, see Section 3 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.)\n\nHerder\u2019s arguments against these three rationales can all be\nfound briefly summarized in Letters 121\u2013122 from the\n10th Collection of the Letters for the Advancement\n(though they are more fully stated individually elsewhere).\n\nComplementing this negative case against the claims of traditional\npolitical-military history to be of overriding importance, Herder also\nhas positive reasons for focusing instead on the\n\u201cinnerness\u201d of human life in history. (1) One reason is\ncertainly just the sheer interest of this subject-matter (though, as\nwas mentioned before, that would not be a sufficient reason in his\neyes). (2) Another reason is that his discovery of radical diversity\nin human mentality has shown there to be a much broader, less\nexplored, and more intellectually challenging field for investigation\nhere than previous generations of historians have realized. Two\nfurther reasons are moral in nature: (3) He believes, quite plausibly,\nthat studying people\u2019s minds through their literature, visual\nart, and so on generally exposes one to them at their moral best (in\nsharp contrast to studying their political-military history, which\nexposes one to them at their worst), so that there are benefits of\nmoral edification to be gleaned here. (4) He has cosmopolitan and\negalitarian moral motives for studying people\u2019s minds through\ntheir literature, visual art, and so forth: in sharp contrast to\nstudying unedifying and elite-focused political-military history, this\npromises to enhance our sympathies for peoples, and moreover for\npeoples at all social levels, including lower ones. Finally, doing\n\u201cinner\u201d history is also important as an instrument for our\nnon-moral self-improvement: (5) It serves to enhance our\nself-understanding. One important reason for this is that it is by,\nand only by, contrasting one\u2019s own outlook with the outlooks of\nother peoples that one comes to recognize what is universal and\ninvariant in it and what by contrast distinctive and variable. Another\nis that in order fully to understand one\u2019s own outlook one needs\nto identify its historical origins and how they developed into it\n(this is Herder\u2019s justly famous \u201cgenetic\u201d method,\nabout which more will be said in a moment). (6) Herder believes that\nan accurate investigation of the (non-moral) ideals of past ages can\nserve to enrich our own ideals and happiness. This motive finds broad\napplication in his work. One example of this is his exploration of\npast literatures in the Fragments largely with a view to\ndrawing from them lessons about how better to develop modern German\nliterature.\n\nHerder\u2019s decision to focus on the \u201cinnerness\u201d of\nhistory\u2019s participants, and his consequent emphasis on\npsychology and interpretation as historical methods, strikingly\nanticipated and strongly influenced Dilthey. So too did his rationale\nfor this decision, as described above, which is indeed arguably\nsuperior to Dilthey\u2019s, especially on its positive side.\n\nAnother of Herder\u2019s major contributions to the philosophy of\nhistory, likewise based on his insight into radical mental difference,\nis the \u201cgenetic\u201d method recently mentioned. This was a\nrevolutionary invention that has proved to be of enormous intrinsic\nvalue and which has exercised a huge influence on the philosophies of\nimportant successors such as Hegel, Nietzsche, and Foucault.\n\nHerder\u2019s genetic method is first and foremost a means toward\nbetter understanding, or explaining, psychological outlooks\nand psychologically laden practices\u2014especially a means toward\nbetter understanding one\u2019s own, toward better\nself-understanding. The method achieves its distinctive\ncontribution to better understanding such outlooks and practices,\nsaliently including one\u2019s own, by showing, in a naturalistic\n(i.e., non-religious, non-mythical, non-transcendent) way, that and\nhow they have developed historically out of earlier origins prior to\nwhich they were not yet really present at all and from which they have\nemerged via a series of transformations.\n\nHerder initially developed this method in the 1760s mainly in relation\nto poetry and language. His unpublished Attempt at a History of\nLyrical Poetry (1764) contains his earliest presentation of the\nmethod and applies it to poetry. His slightly later published work,\nthe Fragments (1767\u20138), refines his presentation of it\nand applies it to language. He then goes on to apply the method to\nmoral (and other) values. Thus in This Too a\nPhilosophy of History (1774) he largely focuses on moral,\naesthetic, and prudential values, developing the large-scale\n\u201cgenetic\u201d thesis that history has consisted of a great\nchain of cultures (Oriental patriarchal culture, then Egyptian, then\nPhoenician, then Greek, then Roman, and so on) that have built on each\nother cumulatively and thus eventually generated modern European\nculture (toward which he is strikingly ambivalent). For example, he\nclaims that Greek culture combined antecedent Oriental and Egyptian\nculture\u2019s obedience with antecedent Phoenician culture\u2019s\nfreedom in a new synthesis, and then passed this on to subsequent\nEuropean cultures.\n\nHegel, especially in his Phenomenology of Spirit (1807),\nNietzsche, especially in On the Genealogy of Morality (1887),\nand Foucault subsequently took over this method and modified it in\nvarious ways.\n\nHow exactly is Herder\u2019s method supposed to advance (self-)understanding?\nIt aims to do so in two\ndistinguishable ways, which together constitute what one might call\nthe essential model of genetic explanation.\n\nThe method\u2019s first contribution to (self-)understanding\nis roughly as follows. Someone who possesses his or her own\ndistinctive concepts, beliefs, values, sensations, customs, art forms,\nand so on but does not compare them with perspectives that have lacked\nthem altogether or possessed variant alternatives runs a grave risk of\ntaking them to be universal and indispensable, and also of overlooking\nwhat is distinctive in their character. The genetic method counteracts\nboth of these types of (self-)misunderstanding by making one familiar\nwith earlier historical periods that have lacked the relevant concepts\netc. altogether and with intervening historical periods in which they\nwere indeed anticipated but only in forms significantly different from\nthe form in which one possesses them oneself, thereby making it\npossible both to perceive the non-universality and dispensability of\nthe concepts etc. in question and to compare them with others in order\nto reveal their distinctive character.\n\nThe method\u2019s second contribution to (self-)understanding\nconsists at its most basic level in showing two things: first, it\nshows that the concepts etc. in question, rather than, say, having\nbeen innate and therefore present in human minds all along or else\nhaving emerged ex nihilo fully formed at some point in\nhistory, are the products of historical developments before which they\ndid not really exist at all and in the course of which they only\nexisted in variant forms; second, it shows what exactly these\nhistorical developments that produced them have been. At a less basic\nlevel, it normally also includes a provision of one or another further\nsort of explanation that is more specific in character. For example,\nthe method shows that lyric poetry began as, and then continued\nthroughout its transformations to be, an expression of deep emotions;\nthat languages developed gradually from primitive beginnings to\nachieve their striking later complexity; or that modern culture and\nits values arose through a series of accumulations and transformations\nof earlier cultures and their values.\n\nFinally, Herder is also impressive for having recognized, and, though\nnot solved, at least grappled with, a problem that flows from his\npicture of history (and intercultural comparison) as an arena of\nradical differences in human mentality. This is the problem of\nskepticism. (For further details, see Section 4 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.)\n",
