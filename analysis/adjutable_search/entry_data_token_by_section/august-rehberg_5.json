    "main_text": "Dispute with Kant\n6. Rehberg and the Historicist Tradition\n\n Rehberg's importance for the historicist tradition has long been\nappreciated by the few scholars who know him.  It is scarcely\nrecognized, however, among scholars of historicism, who either ignore\nhim or treat him in a footnote.[46] In his magisterial\nEntstehung des Historismus Friedrich Meinecke treated Rehberg\nen passant, as if he were but a disciple of\n M\u00f6ser.[47]\n This too is an injustice, since Rehberg was\nas great an influence on the historicist tradition as M\u00f6ser\nhimself.  Though M\u00f6ser was the more original thinker, Rehberg had\na better understanding of its relevance for the post-revolutionary\nera.  It is surely a telling sign of Rehberg's significance for\nhistoricism that Friedrich Savigny, the founder of the historical\nschool of law, had praised him repeatedly for his critique of the\nCode Napoleon, the French attempt to impose a rational\nconstitution upon the Electorate of\n Hannover.[48]\n Resistance\nto the Code Napoleon was the first cause\nc\u00e9l\u00e8bre of historicism, its first case in its\nbattle against the legal rationalism of the Enlightenment; and in this\nrespect Rehberg was Savigny's most weighty precedent.  In sum,\nRehberg's chief contribution to historicism was making it the\nantithesis to revolutionary ideology.  \n\n We find in Rehberg some standard historicist tropes before they\nbecame widespread in the nineteenth century.  Like Herder and\nM\u00f6ser, he taught that each nation is an organic whole, a unique\nindividual, which cannot be reduced down to the mere sum of its\nmembers.  Each nation has a singular and characteristic spirit\n(Volksgeist), which pervades every aspect of its life, and\nwhich persists over the generations. This meant for Rehberg, as later\nhistoricists, that moral and political values are sui generis\nand incommensurable, so that we should not judge one nation or epoch\nby the values of another.  Rehberg also shared some of M\u00f6ser's\nskepticism about the natural law tradition, which attempted to\nformulate universal values or moral standards above all the changes of\n history.[49]\n He too believed that these values often turned\nout to be the product of their own time and place, that they rested\nupon illicit generalizations from the values of one culture.\n\n What was new to Rehberg's historicism was his critique of reason.\nHis skepticism regarding the practical powers of reason gave\nhistoricism a new firmer foundation, one deeper than that dug by\nM\u00f6ser or Herder.  The ultimate upshot of his skepticism, as we\nhave seen, is that there is a gap between theory and practice, between\nreason and conduct, in the realms of morality and politics.  Since\nreason cannot lay down specific maxims for moral conduct, and since it\ncannot determine the specific form of a constitution, it proves to be\na useless guide to moral and political action.  What fills the gap\nbetween theory and practice is, for Rehberg, nothing less than\nhistory.  There are two senses in which this is the case.  First, we\ndetermine the specific maxims of our moral conduct, or the proper\npolitical constitution for a country, only by judging their utility,\nby seeing how well they fit into their cultural context, which is the\nproduct of history.  Second, we sometimes have to lay aside utility\nand determine how to act by precedent and tradition, by learning the\ncustoms of a culture; but precedent, custom and tradition are also\nresults of history.  Both points show, Rehberg believes, that we are\nnot completely free moral agents who simply choose to become part of a\nculture, and who choose principles of action based on pure reason\nalone; rather, we are born into our culture, which shapes our very\nidentity, and which supplies the content for our principles.  We\ncannot escape our history because it makes us who we are.\n\n It is necessary to be precise, however, about the exact role played\nby history in Rehberg's philosophy.  The historical strands of his\nthought have often been exaggerated, as if he completely rejected the\nnatural law tradition and all rationalism in\n politics.[50]\n\nAlthough he was indeed skeptical about many claims made for natural\nlaw, he never denied its very existence; and although he doubted that\npractical reason determines concrete maxims, he never questioned that\nit could lay down the most general principles of morality.  More\nexactly, his position is that natural law and practical reason are\nnecessary, but not sufficient, for moral and political practice.\nHistory completes reason, but it does not replace it.  This residual\nrationalism in Rehberg's political thought appears in some of his\nlater articles on the historical school of\n law.[51]\n\nReaffirming the Kantian view that there is an a priori dimension of\nright, he argued against the doctrine that all laws are nothing more\nthan arbitrary commands.  In this regard, Fichte's critique of Rehberg\nis unfair and misses the\n point.[52]\n Rehberg taught not that\nhistorical traditions determine the standard of right, as Fichte\nclaimed, but only that they determine how it should be applied and\ndeveloped in specific circumstances.\n\n It is also important not to exaggerate Rehberg's traditionalism.  His\ninsistence on the indispenable role of tradition in political life was\none of the characteristic features of his conservatism.  It is\nimportant to add, though, that his faith in tradition was not that of\na reactionary.  He never went so far as to hold that custom and\ntradition are sacred.  He admitted, indeed insisted, that we should\nchange custom and tradition if they become oppressive or inconvenient\nin changing\n circumstances.[53]\n\n",
