    "main_text": "The Second Sex || Living the Female Body\n2.2 Living the Female Body\n\nIn later chapters Beauvoir provides a phenomenology of the body as\nlived throughout the different stages of a woman\u2019s life. Here\nshe is explicitly offering her narrative as an account of lived\nexperience, the body in situation. In childhood the young girl\u2019s\nbody is experienced in a different way from that of the young boy. She\nis trained into a different way of inhabiting it. He is encouraged to\nclimb trees and play rough games. She is encouraged to treat her whole\nperson as a doll, \u201ca passive object \u2026 an inert given\nobject\u201d (1949 [1982: 306\u2013307]). The consequence is an\ninhibited intentionality, her spontaneous movements inhibited,\n\u201cthe exuberance of life \u2026 restrained\u201d (1949 [1982:\n323]), \u201clack of physical power\u201d leading to a\n\u201cgeneral timidity\u201d (1949 [1982: 355]). The account\nwhich Beauvoir is offering here is one in which girls undergo\nsomething like a training in bodily habits which structure the\npossibilities for interaction with their world.\n\nAs the girl enters puberty, Beauvoir notes, her body becomes to her a\nsource of horror and shame. \u201cThis new growth in her armpits\ntransforms her into a kind of animal or algae\u201d (1949 [1982:\n333]), her menstrual blood a source of disgust. These negative\ndescriptions are continued for sexual initiation, marriage, and\nmotherhood. Her phenomenology of the maternal body has been especially\ncontroversial: \n\n\nensnared by nature the pregnant women is plant and animal \u2026 an\nincubator, a conscious and free individual who has become life\u2019s\npassive instrument \u2026 not so much mothers\u2026 as fertile\norganisms, like fowls with high egg production. (1949 [1982: 513])\n\n\n\nThese accounts have been a source of criticism, particularly when\nlater feminists sought to celebrate the female body as a source of\npleasure, fertility, and empowerment, (see below). However it is\nimportant to recognize that what she was offering was a descriptive\nphenomenology of female bodies as lived in specific situations. She\nwas describing a particular set of experiences at a specific social\nand historical point. As she explicitly says: \n\n\nif the biological condition of women does constitute a handicap, it is\nbecause of her general situation \u2026. It is in a total situation\nwhich leaves her few outlets that her peculiarities take on their\nimportance. (1949 [1982: 356\u2013357]) \n\n\nIt is this situation which her writings aimed to highlight and\nchange.\n",
