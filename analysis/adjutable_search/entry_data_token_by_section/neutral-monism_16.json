    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || The Materialism Suspicion\n4.3 The Materialism Suspicion\n\nIn the past neutral monism has often been interpreted as a form of\nmentalism. But a number of contemporary philosophers argue that it is\nbest understood as a form of physicalism.\n\nWe have noted how Landini\u2019s interpretation of the notion of\nneutrality (according to (3)\u2014the Possible Constituent\nView) allows him to argue that neutral monism is compatible with\nphysicalism. As he sees it, Russell is committed to such a version of\n(four-dimensionalist) physicalist neutral monism. Accordingly, Russell\nis engaged in the project of \u201cconstructing both [minds and\nmatter] out of orderings of physical events that are their\nstages\u201d (Landini 2011: 280). After a detailed discussion,\nLandini reaches the conclusion that Russell\u2019s basic transient\nparticulars (or events) \u201care without intrinsic phenomenal\ncharacter\u201d (Landini 2011: 297). This makes it possible to regard\nthem as physical entities in good standing. Their neutrality consists\nin the fact that they are the building blocks of both mental and\nphysical continuants (see Landini 2011: 292).\n\nSimilarly, Erik Banks (see section 5.6 below) presents his so-called\n\u201crealistic empiricism\u201d as a direct descendant of\ntraditional neutral monism (Banks 2014, viii). But he also holds that\nhis neutral monism is \u201ca kind of physicalism\u201d (Banks 2014:\n7, 142). Banks takes himself to follow Russell embracing an ontology\nof events as manifestations of underlying powers or\nenergies\u2014such as electromagnetism, gravitation, and nuclear\nforces (Banks 149), as well as neural energies (Banks 2014: 142). But\nevent particulars such as these, Banks insists, \u201care so\nphysicalistic in nature that there does not seem to be any reason to\nassume that these natural qualities in physics have anything at all in\ncommon with our sensations, which are qualities of a very different\norder\u2026 [involving] events in the human nervous system at a very\ndifferent scale of complexity and size\u201d (Banks 2014: 156).\n\nAfter a careful survey of the development of Russell\u2019s neutral\nmonism, Donovan Wishon observes that Russell\u2019s post-1940 version\nof neutral monism \u201chas a greater affinity to Russellian\nPhysicalism than any genuinely neutral monism\u201d (Wishon\n2015: 114\u20135). Among other things, Wishon draws our attention to\nRussell\u2019s report that \u201cI find myself in ontology\nincreasingly materialistic\u201d (Russell 1946: 700). He also points\nto Russell\u2019s remarks that \u201cI should regard all events as\nphysical\u201d and that \u201cthe distinction between what is mental\nand what is physical does not lie in any intrinsic character of\neither, but in the way in which we acquire knowledge of them\u201d\n(Russell 1958: 12). Hence, Wishon concludes, \u201cmental events will\nturn out to be a subclass of the physical events that make up\nreality\u201d\u2014only their special epistemic accessibility\ndistinguishes them from the other physical events (2015: 112). But he\ndoes not quite answer whether Russell, in this late period, took all\nevents to be physical due to their intrinsic natures or merely due to\ntheir relations to other events.\n\nThese attempts to combine neutral monism with physicalism, or to\nreinterpret neutral monism along physicalist lines pose a serious\nchallenge to neutral monism as usually understood. They deny the\ncentral claim that the fundamental building blocks of the world are\nneutral in the sense of being both nonmental and\n nonphysical.[18]\n But no less noteworthy is the degree to which these versions of\nphysicalism depart from more standard forms of physicalism. In\nparticular, they agree with neutral monism that physical theories do\nnot fully capture the nature of the world they describe. This suggests\nthat the difference between neutral monism and this sort of\nphysicalism may not be so deep after all (see Chalmers 2015).\n",
