    "main_text": "Defining Perceptual Learning\n1. Defining Perceptual Learning\n\nIn 1963, the psychologist Eleanor Gibson wrote a landmark survey\narticle on perceptual learning in which she purported to define the\nterm. According to Gibson, perceptual learning is \u201c[a]ny\nrelatively permanent and consistent change in the perception of a\nstimulus array, following practice or experience with this\narray\u2026\u201d (1963:\n 29).[1]\n Gibson\u2019s definition has three basic parts. First, perceptual\nlearning is long-lasting. Second, it is perceptual. Third, it is the\nresult of practice or experience. This entry expands on each of these\nfeatures of the definition.\n",
