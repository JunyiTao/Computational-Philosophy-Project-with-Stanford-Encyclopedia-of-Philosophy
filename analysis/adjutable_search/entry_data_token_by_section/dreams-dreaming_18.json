    "main_text": "The meaning of dreams and the functions of dreaming || The meaning of dreams\n6.1 The meaning of dreams\n\nPhilosophical discussions of dreaming tend to focus on (a) dream\ndeception and (b) questions about the ontology of dreaming, its moral\nstatus, etc., that tend to intersect with dream skepticism. By\ncontrast, the main source of interest in dreams outside of philosophy\ntraditionally has been dream interpretation and whether dreams are a\nsource of knowledge and insight. Historically, the epistemic status of\ndreams and the use of prophetic and diagnostic dreams was not just a\ntheoretical, but a practical problem (Barbera 2008). Different types\nof dreams were distinguished by their putative epistemic\nvalue. Artemidorus, for instance, used the term\nenhypnion to refer to dreams that merely reflect the\nsleeper\u2019s current bodily or psychological state and hence do not\nmerit further interpretation, whereas he reserved the term\noneiron for meaningful and symbolic dreams of divine\norigin.\n\nThe practice of dream interpretation was famously attacked by\nAristotle in On Prophecy in Sleep. He denied that dreams are\nof divine origin, but allowed that occasionally, small affections of\nthe sensory organs as might stem from distant events that cannot be\nperceived in waking are perceptible in the quiet of sleep. He also\nbelieved such dreams were mostly likely to occur in dullards whose\nminds resemble an empty desert \u2013 an assessment that was not apt to\nencourage interest in dreams (Kroker 2007: 37). A similarly negative\nview was held by early modern philosophers who believed dreams were\noften the source of superstitious beliefs (Hobbes 1651; Kant 1766;\nSchopenhauer 1847).\n\nIn Freudian dream theory, dream interpretation once more assumed a\nprominent role as the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious. This\nwas associated with claims about the psychic sources of dreaming.\nFreud (1899) also rejected the influence of external or bodily\nsources, as championed by contemporary proponents of somatic-stimulus\ntheory. \n\nIn the neuroscience of dreaming, Hobson famously argued that dreams\nare the product of the random, brain-stem driven activation of the\nbrain during sleep (Hobson 1988) and at best enable personal insights\nin the same way as a Rorschach test (Hobson et al. 2000). Dennett\n(1991) illustrates the lack of design underlying the production of\ndream narratives through the \u201cparty game of\npsychoanalysis\u201d, which involves an aimless game of\nquestion-and-answer. In the game, players follow simple rules to\njointly produce narratives that can seem symbolic and meaningful, even\nthough no intelligent and deliberate process of narration was\ninvolved.\n\nEven if we grant that dreams are not messages from a hidden entity in\nneed of decoding, this does not imply that dream interpretation cannot\nbe a personally meaningful source of insight and creativity (Hobson\n& Wohl 2005). Whether and under which conditions, and following\nwhich methods, dream interpretation can lead to personally significant\ninsights is an empirical question that is only beginning to be\ninvestigated systematically (see Edwards et al. 2013).\n\nFinally, throughout history, views on the epistemic status of dreams\nand the type of knowledge to be gained from dream interpretation\n(e.g., knowledge about the future, diagnosis of physical illness, or\ninsights about one\u2019s current concerns) often changed in tandem\nwith views on the origin and sources of dreaming, which gradually\nmoved from divine origins and external sources, via the body, to the\nunconscious, and finally to the brain.\n",
