Positive liberty is the possibility of\nacting \u2014 or the fact of acting \u2014 in such a way as to take\ncontrol of one\u2019s life and realize one\u2019s fundamental\npurposes. While negative liberty is usually attributed to individual\nagents, positive liberty is sometimes attributed to collectivities, or\nto individuals considered primarily as members of given\ncollectivities.\n\nThe idea of distinguishing between a negative and a positive sense of\nthe term \u2018liberty\u2019 goes back at least to Kant, and was\nexamined and defended in depth by Isaiah Berlin in the 1950s and\n\u201960s. Discussions about positive and negative liberty normally\ntake place within the context of political and social philosophy. They\nare distinct from, though sometimes related to, philosophical\ndiscussions about\n free will.\n Work on the nature of positive liberty often overlaps, however, with\nwork on the nature of\n autonomy.\n\nAs Berlin showed, negative and positive liberty are not merely two\ndistinct kinds of liberty; they can be seen as rival, incompatible\ninterpretations of a single political ideal. Since few people claim to\nbe against liberty, the way this term is interpreted and defined can\nhave important political implications. Political\n liberalism\n tends to presuppose a negative definition of liberty: liberals\ngenerally claim that if one favors individual liberty one should place\nstrong limitations on the activities of the state. Critics of\nliberalism often contest this implication by contesting the negative\ndefinition of liberty: they argue that the pursuit of liberty\nunderstood as self-realization or as self-determination (whether of\nthe individual or of the collectivity) can require state intervention\nof a kind not normally allowed by liberals.\n\nMany authors prefer to talk of positive and negative freedom.\nThis is only a difference of style, and the terms\n\u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019 are normally used\ninterchangeably by political and social philosophers. Although some\nattempts have been made to distinguish between liberty and freedom\n(Pitkin 1988; Williams 2001; Dworkin 2011), generally speaking these\nhave not caught on. Neither can they be translated into other European\nlanguages, which contain only the one term, of either Latin or\nGermanic origin (e.g. libert\u00e9, Freiheit), where English\ncontains both.\n", "toc": [{"#TwoConLib": "1.

Two Concepts of Liberty\n\nImagine you are driving a car through town, and you come to a fork in\nthe road. You turn left, but no one was forcing you to go one way or\nthe other. Next you come to a crossroads. You turn right, but no one\nwas preventing you from going left or straight on. There is no traffic\nto speak of and there are no diversions or police roadblocks. So you\nseem, as a driver, to be completely free. But this picture of your\nsituation might change quite dramatically if we consider that the\nreason you went left and then right is that you\u2019re addicted to\ncigarettes and you\u2019re desperate to get to the tobacconists\nbefore it closes. Rather than driving, you feel you are\nbeing driven, as your urge to smoke leads you uncontrollably\nto turn the wheel first to the left and then to the right. Moreover,\nyou\u2019re perfectly aware that your turning right at the crossroads\nmeans you\u2019ll probably miss a train that was to take you to an\nappointment you care about very much. You long to be free of this\nirrational desire that is not only threatening your longevity but is\nalso stopping you right now from doing what you think you ought to be\ndoing.\n\nThis story gives us two contrasting ways of thinking of liberty. On\nthe one hand, one can think of liberty as the absence of obstacles\nexternal to the agent. You are free if no one is stopping you from\ndoing whatever you might want to do. In the above story you appear, in\nthis sense, to be free. On the other hand, one can think of liberty as\nthe presence of control on the part of the agent. To be free, you must\nbe self-determined, which is to say that you must be able to control\nyour own destiny in your own interests. In the above story you appear,\nin this sense, to be unfree: you are not in control of your own\ndestiny, as you are failing to control a passion that you yourself\nwould rather be rid of and which is preventing you from realizing what\nyou recognize to be your true interests. One might say that while on\nthe first view liberty is simply about how many doors are open to the\nagent, on the second view it is more about going through the right\ndoors for the right reasons.\n\nIn a famous essay first published in 1958, Isaiah Berlin called these\ntwo concepts of liberty negative and positive respectively (Berlin\n 1969).[1]\n The reason for using these labels is that in the first case liberty\nseems to be a mere absence of something (i.e. of obstacles,\nbarriers, constraints or interference from others), whereas in the\nsecond case it seems to require the presence of something\n(i.e. of control, self-mastery, self-determination or\nself-realization). In Berlin\u2019s words, we use the negative\nconcept of liberty in attempting to answer the question \u201cWhat is\nthe area within which the subject \u2014 a person or group of persons\n\u2014 is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be,\nwithout interference by other persons?\u201d, whereas we use the\npositive concept in attempting to answer the question \u201cWhat, or\nwho, is the source of control or interference that can determine\nsomeone to do, or be, this rather than that?\u201d (1969, pp.\n121\u201322).\n\nIt is useful to think of the difference between the two concepts in\nterms of the difference between factors that are external and factors\nthat are internal to the agent. While theorists of negative freedom\nare primarily interested in the degree to which individuals or groups\nsuffer interference from external bodies, theorists of positive\nfreedom are more attentive to the internal factors affecting the\ndegree to which individuals or groups act autonomously. Given this\ndifference, one might be tempted to think that a political philosopher\nshould concentrate exclusively on negative freedom, a concern with\npositive freedom being more relevant to psychology or individual\nmorality than to political and social institutions. This, however,\nwould be premature, for among the most hotly debated issues in\npolitical philosophy are the following: Is the positive\nconcept of freedom a political concept? Can individuals or groups\nachieve positive freedom through political action? Is it possible for\nthe state to promote the positive freedom of citizens on their behalf?\nAnd if so, is it desirable for the state to do so? The classic texts\nin the history of western political thought are divided over how these\nquestions should be answered: theorists in the classical liberal\ntradition, like Benjamin Constant, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Herbert\nSpencer, and J.S. Mill, are typically classed as answering\n\u2018no\u2019 and therefore as defending a negative concept of\npolitical freedom; theorists that are critical of this tradition, like\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx and T.H. Green, are\ntypically classed as answering \u2018yes\u2019 and as defending a\npositive concept of political freedom.\n\nIn its political form, positive freedom has often been thought of as\nnecessarily achieved through a collectivity. Perhaps the clearest case\nis that of Rousseau\u2019s theory of freedom, according to which\nindividual freedom is achieved through participation in the process\nwhereby one\u2019s community exercises collective control over its\nown affairs in accordance with the \u2018general will\u2019. Put in\nthe simplest terms, one might say that a democratic society is a free\nsociety because it is a self-determined society, and that a member of\nthat society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its\ndemocratic process. But there are also individualist applications of\nthe concept of positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said\nthat a government should aim actively to create the conditions\nnecessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve\nself-realization. The welfare state has sometimes been defended on\nthis basis, as has the idea of a universal basic income. The negative\nconcept of freedom, on the other hand, is most commonly assumed in\nliberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of\nliberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of\nreligion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist\nor moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences\nof the right to private property. This said, some philosophers have\ncontested the claim that private property necessarily enhances\nnegative liberty (Cohen 1995, 2006), and still others have tried to\nshow that negative liberty can ground a form of egalitarianism\n(Steiner 1994).\n\nAfter Berlin, the most widely cited and best developed analyses of the\nnegative concept of liberty include Hayek (1960), Day (1971),\nOppenheim (1981), Miller (1983) and Steiner (1994). Among the most\nprominent contemporary analyses of the positive concept of liberty are\nMilne (1968), Gibbs (1976), C. Taylor (1979) and Christman (1991,\n2005).\n2. The Paradox of Positive Liberty\n\nMany liberals, including Berlin, have suggested that the positive\nconcept of liberty carries with it a danger of authoritarianism.\nConsider the fate of a permanent and oppressed minority. Because the\nmembers of this minority participate in a democratic process\ncharacterized by majority rule, they might be said to be free on the\ngrounds that they are members of a society exercising self-control\nover its own affairs. But they are oppressed, and so are surely\nunfree. Moreover, it is not necessary to see a society as democratic\nin order to see it as self-controlled; one might instead adopt an\norganic conception of society, according to which the collectivity is\nto be thought of as a living organism, and one might believe that this\norganism will only act rationally, will only be in control of itself,\nwhen its various parts are brought into line with some rational plan\ndevised by its wise governors (who, to extend the metaphor, might be\nthought of as the organism\u2019s brain). In this case, even the\nmajority might be oppressed in the name of liberty.\n\nSuch justifications of oppression in the name of liberty are no mere\nproducts of the liberal imagination, for there are notorious\nhistorical examples of their endorsement by authoritarian political\nleaders. Berlin, himself a liberal and writing during the cold war,\nwas clearly moved by the way in which the apparently noble ideal of\nfreedom as self-mastery or self-realization had been twisted and\ndistorted by the totalitarian dictators of the twentieth century\n\u2014 most notably those of the Soviet Union \u2014 so as to claim\nthat they, rather than the liberal West, were the true champions of\nfreedom. The slippery slope towards this paradoxical conclusion\nbegins, according to Berlin, with the idea of a divided self. To\nillustrate: the smoker in our story provides a clear example of a\ndivided self, for she is both a self that desires to get to an\nappointment and a self that desires to get to the tobacconists, and\nthese two desires are in conflict. We can now enrich this story in a\nplausible way by adding that one of these selves \u2014 the keeper of\nappointments \u2014 is superior to the other: the self that is a\nkeeper of appointments is thus a \u2018higher\u2019 self, and the\nself that is a smoker is a \u2018lower\u2019 self. The higher self\nis the rational, reflecting self, the self that is capable of moral\naction and of taking responsibility for what she does. This is the\ntrue self, for rational reflection and moral responsibility are the\nfeatures of humans that mark them off from other animals. The lower\nself, on the other hand, is the self of the passions, of unreflecting\ndesires and irrational impulses. One is free, then, when one\u2019s\nhigher, rational self is in control and one is not a slave to\none\u2019s passions or to one\u2019s merely empirical self. The next\nstep down the slippery slope consists in pointing out that some\nindividuals are more rational than others, and can therefore know best\nwhat is in their and others\u2019 rational interests. This allows\nthem to say that by forcing people less rational than themselves to do\nthe rational thing and thus to realize their true selves, they are in\nfact liberating them from their merely empirical desires.\nOccasionally, Berlin says, the defender of positive freedom will take\nan additional step that consists in conceiving of the self as wider\nthan the individual and as represented by an organic social whole\n\u2014 \u201ca tribe, a race, a church, a state, the great society\nof the living and the dead and the yet unborn\u201d. The true\ninterests of the individual are to be identified with the interests of\nthis whole, and individuals can and should be coerced into fulfilling\nthese interests, for they would not resist coercion if they were as\nrational and wise as their coercers. \u201cOnce I take this\nview\u201d, Berlin says, \u201cI am in a position to ignore the\nactual wishes of men or societies, to bully, oppress, torture in the\nname, and on behalf, of their \u2018real\u2019 selves, in the secure\nknowledge that whatever is the true goal of man ... must be identical\nwith his freedom\u201d (Berlin 1969, pp. 132\u201333).\n\nThose in the negative camp try to cut off this line of reasoning at\nthe first step, by denying that there is any necessary relation\nbetween one\u2019s freedom and one\u2019s desires. Since one is free\nto the extent that one is externally unprevented from doing things,\nthey say, one can be free to do what one does not desire to do. If\nbeing free meant being unprevented from realizing one\u2019s desires,\nthen one could, again paradoxically, reduce one\u2019s unfreedom by\ncoming to desire fewer of the things one is unfree to do. One could\nbecome free simply by contenting oneself with one\u2019s situation. A\nperfectly contented slave is perfectly free to realize all of her\ndesires. Nevertheless, we tend to think of slavery as the opposite of\nfreedom. More generally, freedom is not to be confused with happiness,\nfor in logical terms there is nothing to stop a free person from being\nunhappy or an unfree person from being happy. The happy person might\nfeel free, but whether they are free is another\nmatter (Day, 1970). Negative theorists of freedom therefore tend to\nsay not that having freedom means being unprevented from doing as one\ndesires, but that it means being unprevented from doing whatever one\nmight desire to do (Steiner 1994. Cf. Van Parijs 1995; Sugden\n2006).\n\nSome theorists of positive freedom bite the bullet and say that the\ncontented slave is indeed free \u2014 that in order to be free the\nindividual must learn, not so much to dominate certain merely\nempirical desires, but to rid herself of them. She must, in other\nwords, remove as many of her desires as possible. As Berlin puts it,\nif I have a wounded leg \u2018there are two methods of freeing myself\nfrom pain. One is to heal the wound. But if the cure is too difficult\nor uncertain, there is another method. I can get rid of the wound by\ncutting off my leg\u2019 (1969, pp. 135\u201336). This is the\nstrategy of liberation adopted by ascetics, stoics and Buddhist sages.\nIt involves a \u2018retreat into an inner citadel\u2019 \u2014 a\nsoul or a purely noumenal self \u2014 in which the individual is\nimmune to any outside forces. But this state, even if it can be\nachieved, is not one that liberals would want to call one of freedom,\nfor it again risks masking important forms of oppression. It is, after\nall, often in coming to terms with excessive external limitations in\nsociety that individuals retreat into themselves, pretending to\nthemselves that they do not really desire the worldly goods or\npleasures they have been denied. Moreover, the removal of desires may\nalso be an effect of outside forces, such as brainwashing, which we\nshould hardly want to call a realization of freedom.\n\nBecause the concept of negative freedom concentrates on the external\nsphere in which individuals interact, it seems to provide a better\nguarantee against the dangers of paternalism and authoritarianism\nperceived by Berlin. To promote negative freedom is to promote the\nexistence of a sphere of action within which the individual is\nsovereign, and within which she can pursue her own projects subject\nonly to the constraint that she respect the spheres of others.\nHumboldt and Mill, both advocates of negative freedom, compared the\ndevelopment of an individual to that of a plant: individuals, like\nplants, must be allowed to grow, in the sense of developing their own\nfaculties to the full and according to their own inner logic. Personal\ngrowth is something that cannot be imposed from without, but must come\nfrom within the individual.\n3. Two Attempts to Create a Third Way\n\nCritics, however, have objected that the ideal described by Humboldt\nand Mill looks much more like a positive concept of liberty than a\nnegative one. Positive liberty consists, they say, in exactly this\ngrowth of the individual: the free individual is one that develops,\ndetermines and changes her own desires and interests autonomously and\nfrom within. This is not liberty as the mere absence of obstacles, but\nliberty as autonomy or self-realization. Why should the mere absence\nof state interference be thought to guarantee such growth? Is there\nnot some third way between the extremes of totalitarianism and the\nminimal state of the classical liberals \u2014 some non-paternalist,\nnon-authoritarian means by which positive liberty in the above sense\ncan be actively promoted?\n3.1 Positive Liberty as Content-neutral\n\nMuch of the more recent work on positive liberty has been motivated by\na dissatisfaction with the ideal of negative liberty combined with an\nawareness of the possible abuses of the positive concept so forcefully\nexposed by Berlin. John Christman (1991, 2005, 2009, 2013), for\nexample, has argued that positive liberty concerns the ways\nin which desires are formed \u2014 whether as a result of rational\nreflection on all the options available, or as a result of pressure,\nmanipulation or ignorance. What it does not regard, he says, is the\ncontent of an individual\u2019s desires. The promotion of\npositive freedom need not therefore involve the claim that there is\nonly one right answer to the question of how a person should live, nor\nneed it allow, or even be compatible with, a society forcing its\nmembers into given patterns of behavior. Take the example of a Muslim\nwoman who claims to espouse the fundamentalist doctrines generally\nfollowed by her family and the community in which she lives. On\nChristman\u2019s account, this person is positively unfree if her\ndesire to conform was somehow oppressively imposed upon her through\nindoctrination, manipulation or deceit. She is positively free, on the\nother hand, if she arrived at her desire to conform while aware of\nother reasonable options and she weighed and assessed these other\noptions rationally. Even if this woman seems to have a preference for\nsubservient behavior, there is nothing necessarily freedom-enhancing\nor freedom-restricting about her having the desires she has, since\nfreedom regards not the content of these desires but their mode of\nformation. On this view, forcing her to do certain things rather than\nothers can never make her more free, and Berlin\u2019s paradox of\npositive freedom would seem to have been avoided.\n\nThis more \u2018procedural\u2019 account of positive liberty allows\nus to point to kinds of internal constraint that seem too fall off the\nradar if we adopt only negative concept. For example, some radical\npolitical theorists believe it can help us to make sense of forms of\noppression and structural injustice that cannot be traced to overt\nacts of prevention or coercion. On the one hand, in agreement with\nBerlin, we should recognize the dangers of that come with promoting\nthe values or interests of a person\u2019s \u2018true self\u2019 in\nopposition to what they manifestly desire. Thus, the procedural\naccount avoids all reference to a \u2018true self\u2019. On the\nother, we should recognize that people\u2019s actual selves\nare inevitably formed in a social context and that their values and\nsenses of identity (for example, in terms of gender or race or\nnationality) are shaped by cultural influences. In this sense, the\nself is \u2018socially constructed\u2019, and this social\nconstruction can itself occur in oppressive ways. The challenge, then,\nis to show how a person\u2019s values can be thus shaped but without\nthe kind of oppressive imposition or manipulation that comes not only\nfrom political coercion but also, more subtly, from practices or\ninstitutions that stigmatize or marginalize certain identities or that\nattach costs to the endorsement of values deviating from acceptable\nnorms, for these kinds of imposition or manipulation can be just\nanother way of promoting a substantive ideal of the self. And this was\nexactly the danger against which Berlin was warning, except that the\ndanger is less visible and can be created unintentionally (Christman\n2013, 2015, 2021; Hirschmann 2003, 2013; Coole 2013).\n\nWhile this theory of positive freedom undoubtedly provides a tool for\ncriticizing the limiting effects of certain practices and institutions\nin contemporary liberal societies, it remains to be seen what kinds of\npolitical action can be pursued in order to promote content-neutral\npositive liberty without encroaching on any individual\u2019s\nrightful sphere of negative liberty. Thus, the potential conflict\nbetween the two ideals of negative and positive freedom might survive\nChristman\u2019s alternative analysis, albeit in a milder form. Even\nif we rule out coercing individuals into specific patterns of\nbehavior, a state interested in promoting content-neutral positive\nliberty might still have considerable space for intervention aimed at\n\u2018public enlightenment\u2019, perhaps subsidizing some kinds of\nactivities (in order to encourage a plurality of genuine options) and\nfinancing such intervention through taxation. Liberals might criticize\nthis kind of intervention on anti-paternalist grounds, objecting that\nsuch measures will require the state to use resources in ways that the\nsupposedly heteronomous individuals, if left to themselves, might have\nchosen to spend in other ways. In other words, even in its\ncontent-neutral form, the ideal of positive freedom might still\nconflict with the liberal idea of respect for persons, one\ninterpretation of which involves viewing individuals from the outside\nand taking their choices at face value. From a liberal point of view,\nthe blindness to internal constraints can be intentional (Carter\n2011a). Some liberals will make an exception to this restriction on\nstate intervention in the case of the education of children, in such a\nway as to provide for the active cultivation of open minds and\nrational reflection. Even here, however, other liberals will object\nthat the right to negative liberty includes the right to decide how\none\u2019s children should be educated.\n\nIs it necessary to refer to internal constraints in order to make\nsense of the phenomena of oppression and structural injustice? Some\nmight contest this view, or say that it is true only up to a point,\nfor there are at least two reasons for thinking that the oppressed are\nlacking in negative liberty. First, while Berlin himself equated\neconomic and social disadvantages with natural disabilities, claiming\nthat neither represented constraints on negative liberty but only on\npersonal abilities, many theorists of negative liberty disagree: if I\nlack the money to buy a jacket from a clothes shop, then any attempt\non my part to carry away the jacket is likely to meet with preventive\nactions or punishment on the part of the shop keeper or the agents of\nthe state. This is a case of interpersonal interference, not merely of\npersonal inability. In the normal circumstances of a market economy,\npurchasing power is indeed a very reliable indicator of how far other\npeople will stop you from doing certain things if you try. It is\ntherefore strongly correlated with degrees of negative freedom (Cohen\n1995, 2011; Waldron 1993; Carter 2007; Grant 2013). Thus, while the\npromotion of content-neutral positive liberty might imply the transfer\nof certain kinds of resources to members of disadvantaged groups, the\nsame might be true of the promotion of negative liberty. Second, the\nnegative concept of freedom can be applied directly to disadvantaged\ngroups as well as to their individual members. Some social structures\nmay be such as to tolerate the liberation of only a limited number of\nmembers of a given group. G.A. Cohen famously focused on the case\nproletarians who can escape their condition by successfully setting up\na business of their own though a mixture of hard work and luck. In\nsuch cases, while each individual member of the disadvantaged group\nmight be negatively free in the sense of being unprevented from\nchoosing the path of liberation, the freedom of the individual is\nconditional on the unfreedom of the majority of the rest of the group,\nsince not all can escape in this way. Each individual member of the\nclass therefore partakes in a form of collective negative unfreedom\n(Cohen 1988, 2006; for discussion see Mason 1996; Hindricks 2008;\nGrant 2013; Schmidt 2020).\n3.2 Republican Liberty\n\nAnother increasingly influential group of philosophers has rejected\nboth the negative and the positive conception, claiming that liberty\nis not merely the enjoyment of a sphere of non-interference but the\nenjoyment of certain conditions in which such non-interference is\nguaranteed (Pettit 1997, 2001, 2014; Skinner 1998, 2002; Weinstock and\nNadeau 2004; Laborde and Maynor 2008; Lovett 2010, forthcoming; Breen and\nMcBride 2015, List and Valentini 2016). These conditions may include\nthe presence of a democratic constitution and a series of safeguards\nagainst a government wielding power arbitrarily, including popular\ncontrol and the separation of powers. As Berlin admits, on the negative\nview, I am free even if I live in a dictatorship just as long as the\ndictator happens, on a whim, not to interfere with me (see also Hayek\n1960). There is no necessary connection between negative liberty and\nany particular form of government. Is it not counterintuitive to say\nthat I can in theory be free even if I live in a dictatorship, or that\na slave can enjoy considerable liberty as long as the slave-owner is\ncompassionate and generous? Would my subjection to the arbitrary power\nof a dictator or slave-owner not itself be sufficient to qualify me as\nunfree? If it would be, then we should say that I am free only if I\nlive in a society with the kinds of political institutions that\nguarantee the independence of each citizen from such arbitrary power.\nQuentin Skinner has called this view of freedom\n\u2018neo-Roman\u2019, invoking ideas about freedom both of the\nancient Romans and of a number of Renaissance and early modern\nwriters. Philip Pettit has called the same view\n\u2018republican\u2019, and this label has generally prevailed in\nthe recent literature.\n\nRepublican freedom can be thought of as a kind of status: to\nbe a free person is to enjoy the rights and privileges attached to the\nstatus of republican citizenship, whereas the paradigm of the unfree\nperson is the slave. Freedom is not simply a matter of\nnon-interference, for a slave may enjoy a great deal of\nnon-interference at the whim of her master. What makes her unfree is\nher status, such that she is permanently exposed to\ninterference of any kind. Even if the slave enjoys non-interference,\nshe is, as Pettit puts it, \u2018dominated\u2019, because she is\npermanently subject to the arbitrary power of her owner.\n\nAccording to Pettit, then, republicans conceive of freedom not as\nnon-interference, as on the standard negative view, but as\n\u2018non-domination\u2019. Non-domination is distinct from negative\nfreedom, he says, for two reasons. First, as we have seen, one can\nenjoy non-interference without enjoying non-domination. Second, one\ncan enjoy non-domination while nevertheless being interfered with,\njust as long as the interference in question is constrained to track\none\u2019s avowed interests thanks to republican power structures:\nonly arbitrary power is inimical to freedom, not power as such.\n\nOn the other hand, republican freedom is also distinct from positive\nfreedom as expounded and criticized by Berlin. First, republican\nfreedom does not consist in the activity of virtuous political\nparticipation; rather, that participation is seen as instrumentally\nrelated to freedom as non-domination. Secondly, the republican concept\nof freedom cannot lead to anything like the oppressive consequences\nfeared by Berlin, because it has a commitment to non-domination and to\nliberal-democratic institutions already built into it.\n\nPettit\u2019s idea of freedom as non domination has caught the\nimagination of a great many political theorists over the last two\ndecades. One source of its popularity lies in the fact that it seems\nto make sense of the phenomena of oppression and structural injustice\nreferred to above, but without necessarily relying on references to\ninternal constraints. It has been applied not only to relations of\ndomination between governments and citizens, but also to relations of\ndomination between employers and workers (Breen and McBride 2015),\nbetween husbands and wives (Lovett forthcoming), and between able-bodied and\ndisabled people (De Wispelaere and Casassas 2014).\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the republican concept of\nfreedom is ultimately distinguishable from the negative concept, or\nwhether republican writers on freedom have not simply provided good\narguments to the effect that negative freedom is best promoted, on\nbalance and over time, through certain kinds of political\ninstitutions rather than others. While there is no necessary\nconnection between negative liberty and democratic government, there\nmay nevertheless be a strong empirical correlation between the two.\nIan Carter (1999, 2008), Matthew H. Kramer (2003, 2008), and Robert\nGoodin and Frank Jackson (2007) have argued, along these lines, that\nrepublican policies are best defended empirically on the basis of the\nstandard negative ideal of freedom, rather than on the basis of a\nconceptual challenge to that ideal. An important premise in such an\nargument is that the extent of a person\u2019s negative freedom is a\nfunction not simply of how many single actions are prevented, but of\nhow many different act-combinations are prevented. On this\nbasis, people who can achieve their goals only by bowing and scraping\nto their masters must be seen as less free, negatively, than people\nwho can achieve those goals unconditionally. Another important premise\nis that the extent to which people are negatively free depends, in\npart, on the probability with which they will be constrained\nfrom performing future acts or act-combinations. People who are\nsubject to arbitrary power can be seen as less free in the negative\nsense even if they do not actually suffer interference, because the\nprobability of their suffering constraints is always greater\n(ceteris paribus, as a matter of empirical fact) than it\nwould be if they were not subject to that arbitrary power. Only this\ngreater probability, they say, can adequately explain republican\nreferences to the \u2018fear\u2019, the \u2018sense of\nexposure\u2019, and the \u2018precariousness\u2019 of the dominated\n(for further discussion see Bruin 2009, Lang 2012, Shnayderman 2012,\nKirby 2016, Carter and Shnayderman 2019).\n\nIn reply to the above point about the relevance of probabilities,\nrepublicans have insisted that freedom as non-domination is\nnevertheless distinct from negative liberty because what matters for\nan agent\u2019s freedom is the impossibility of others\ninterfering, not the mere improbability of their doing so.\nConsider the example of gender relations with the context of marriage.\nA husband might be kind and generous, or indeed have a strong sense of\negalitarian justice, and therefore be extremely unlikely ever\nto deny his wife the same opportunities as he himself enjoys; but the\nwife is still dominated if the structure of norms in her\nsociety is such as to permit husbands to frustrate the choices of\ntheir wives in numerous ways. If she lives in such a society, she is\nstill subject to the husband\u2019s power whether he likes\nit or not. And whether the husband likes it or not, the wife\u2019s\nsubjection to his power will tend to influence how third parties treat\nher \u2013 for example, in terms of offering employment opportunities.\n\nTaken at face value, however, the requirement of impossibility of\ninterference seems over demanding, as it is never completely\nimpossible for others to constrain me. It is not impossible that I be\nstabbed by someone as I walk down the street this afternoon. Indeed,\nthe possible world in which this event occurs is very close to the\nactual world, even if the event is improbable in the actual world. If\nthe mere possibility of the stabbing makes me unfree to walk down the\nstreet, then unfreedom is everywhere and the achievement of freedom is\nitself virtually impossible. To avoid this worry, republicans have\nqualified their impossibility requirement: for me to be free to walk\ndown the street, it must be impossible for others to stab me with\nimpunity (Pettit 2008a, 2008b; Skinner 2008). This qualification\nmakes the impossibility requirement more realistic. Nevertheless, the\nqualification is open to objections. Is \u2018impunity\u2019 a\npurely formal requirement, or should we say that no one can carry out\na street stabbing with impunity if, say, at least 70% of such\nstabbings lead to prosecution? Even if 100% of such stabbings lead to\nprosecution, there will still be some stabbings. Will they not be\nsources of unfreedom for the victims?\n\nMore recently some republicans have sidelined the notion of impunity\nof interference in favour of that of \u2018ignorability\u2019 of\ninterference (Ingham and Lovett 2019). I am free to make certain\nchoices if the structure of effective societal norms, whether legal or\ncustomary, is such as to constrain the ability of anyone else to\nfrustrate those choices, to the point where the possibility of such\nfrustration, despite existing, is remote enough to be something I can\nignore. Once I can ignore that possibility, then the structure of\neffective norms makes me safe by removing any sense of exposure to\ninterference. Defenders of the negative concept of liberty might\nrespond to this move by saying that the criterion of ignorability\nlooks very much like a criterion of trivially low probability: we\nconsider ourselves free to do x to the extent that the\nsystem of enforced norms deters others\u2019 prevention of x\nin such a way as to make that prevention improbable.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether republicans have successfully carved\nout a third concept of freedom that is really distinct from those of\nnegative and positive liberty. This conceptual uncertainty need not\nitself cast doubt on the distinctness and attractiveness of\nrepublicanism as a set of political prescriptions. Rather, what it\nleaves open is the question of the ultimate normative bases of those\nprescriptions: is \u2018non-domination\u2019 something that\nsupervenes on certain configurations of negative freedom and\nunfreedom, and therefore explainable in terms of such configurations,\nor is it something truly distinct from those configurations?\n4. One Concept of Liberty: Freedom as a Triadic Relation\n\nThe two sides identified by Berlin disagree over which of two\ndifferent concepts best captures the political ideal of\n\u2018liberty\u2019. Does this fact not denote the presence of some\nmore basic agreement between the two sides? How, after all,\ncould they see their disagreement as one about the nature of liberty\nif they did not think of themselves as in some sense talking about\nthe same thing? In an influential article, the American legal\nphilosopher Gerald MacCallum (1967) put forward the following answer:\nthere is in fact only one basic concept of freedom, on which both\nsides in the debate converge. What the so-called negative and\npositive theorists disagree about is how this single concept of\nfreedom should be interpreted. Indeed, in MacCallum\u2019s view,\nthere are a great many different possible interpretations of freedom,\nand it is only Berlin\u2019s artificial dichotomy that has led us to\nthink in terms of there being two.\n\nMacCallum defines the basic concept of freedom \u2014 the concept on\nwhich everyone agrees \u2014 as follows: a subject, or agent, is free\nfrom certain constraints, or preventing conditions, to do or become\ncertain things. Freedom is therefore a triadic relation \u2014 that\nis, a relation between three things: an agent, certain\npreventing conditions, and certain doings or becomings of the agent.\nAny statement about freedom or unfreedom can be translated into a\nstatement of the above form by specifying what is free or\nunfree, from what it is free or unfree, and what it is free\nor unfree to do or become. Any claim about the presence or\nabsence of freedom in a given situation will therefore make certain\nassumptions about what counts as an agent, what counts as a constraint\nor limitation on freedom, and what counts as a purpose that the agent\ncan be described as either free or unfree to carry out.\n\nThe definition of freedom as a triadic relation was first put forward\nin the seminal work of Felix Oppenheim in the 1950s and 60s. Oppenheim\nsaw that an important meaning of \u2018freedom\u2019 in the context\nof political and social philosophy was as a relation between two\nagents and a particular (impeded or unimpeded) action. However,\nOppenheim\u2019s interpretation of freedom was an example of what\nBerlin would call a negative concept. What MacCallum did was to\ngeneralize this triadic structure so that it would cover all possible\nclaims about freedom, whether of the negative or the positive variety.\nIn MacCallum\u2019s framework, unlike in Oppenheim\u2019s, the\ninterpretation of each of the three variables is left open. In other\nwords, MacCallum\u2019s position is a meta-theoretical one: his is a\ntheory about the differences between theorists of freedom.\n\nTo illustrate MacCallum\u2019s point, let us return to the example of\nthe smoker driving to the tobacconists. In describing this person as\neither free or unfree, we shall be making assumptions about each of\nMacCallum\u2019s three variables. If we say that the driver is\nfree, what we shall probably mean is that an agent,\nconsisting in the driver\u2019s empirical self, is free from external\n(physical or legal) obstacles to do whatever he or she might want to\ndo. If, on the other hand, we say that the driver is unfree,\nwhat we shall probably mean is that an agent, consisting in a higher\nor rational self, is made unfree by internal, psychological\nconstraints to carry out some rational, authentic or virtuous plan.\nNotice that in both claims there is a negative element and a positive\nelement: each claim about freedom assumes both that freedom\nis freedom from something (i.e., preventing conditions)\nand that it is freedom to do or become something.\nThe dichotomy between \u2018freedom from\u2019 and \u2018freedom\nto\u2019 is therefore a false one, and it is misleading to say that\nthose who see the driver as free employ a negative concept and those\nwho see the driver as unfree employ a positive one. What these two\ncamps differ over is the way in which one should interpret each of the\nthree variables in the triadic freedom-relation. More precisely, we\ncan see that what they differ over is the extension to be\nassigned to each of the variables.\n\nThus, those whom Berlin places in the negative camp typically conceive\nof the agent as having the same extension as that which it is\ngenerally given in ordinary discourse: they tend to think of the agent\nas an individual human being and as including all of the empirical\nbeliefs and desires of that individual. Those in the so-called\npositive camp, on the other hand, often depart from the ordinary\nnotion, in one sense imagining the agent as more extensive than in the\nordinary notion, and in another sense imagining it as less extensive:\nthey think of the agent as having a greater extension than in ordinary\ndiscourse in cases where they identify the agent\u2019s true desires\nand aims with those of some collectivity of which she is a member; and\nthey think of the agent as having a lesser extension than in ordinary\ndiscourse in cases where they identify the true agent with only a\nsubset of her empirical beliefs and desires \u2014 i.e., with those\nthat are rational, authentic or virtuous. Secondly, those in\nBerlin\u2019s positive camp tend to take a wider view of what counts\nas a constraint on freedom than those in his negative camp: the set of\nrelevant obstacles is more extensive for the former than for the\nlatter, since negative theorists tend to count only external obstacles\nas constraints on freedom, whereas positive theorists also allow that\none may be constrained by internal factors, such as irrational\ndesires, fears or ignorance. And thirdly, those in Berlin\u2019s\npositive camp tend to take a narrower view of what counts as a purpose\none can be free to fulfill. The set of relevant purposes is less\nextensive for them than for the negative theorists, for we have seen\nthat they tend to restrict the relevant set of actions or states to\nthose that are rational, authentic or virtuous, whereas those in the\nnegative camp tend to extend this variable so as to cover any action\nor state the agent might desire.\n\nOn MacCallum\u2019s analysis, then, there is no simple dichotomy\nbetween positive and negative liberty; rather, we should recognize\nthat there is a whole range of possible interpretations or\n\u2018conceptions\u2019 of the single concept of liberty. Indeed, as\nMacCallum says and as Berlin seems implicitly to admit, a number of\nclassic authors cannot be placed unequivocally in one or the other of\nthe two camps. Locke, for example, is normally thought of as one of\nthe fathers or classical liberalism and therefore as a staunch\ndefender of the negative concept of freedom. He indeed states\nexplicitly that \u2018[to be at] liberty is to be free from restraint\nand violence from others\u2019. But he also says that liberty is not\nto be confused with \u2018license\u2019, and that \u201cthat ill\ndeserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and\nprecipices\u201d (Second Treatise, parags. 6 and 57). While\nLocke gives an account of constraints on freedom that Berlin would\ncall negative, he seems to endorse an account of MacCallum\u2019s\nthird freedom-variable that Berlin would call positive, restricting\nthis variable to actions that are not immoral (liberty is not license)\nand to those that are in the agent\u2019s own interests (I am not\nunfree if prevented from falling into a bog). A number of contemporary\nliberals or libertarians have provided or assumed definitions of\nfreedom that are similarly morally loaded (e.g. Nozick 1974; Rothbard\n1982; Bader 2018). This would seem to confirm MacCallum\u2019s claim\nthat it is conceptually and historically misleading to divide\ntheorists into two camps \u2014 a negative liberal one and a positive\nnon-liberal one.\n5. The Analysis of Constraints: Their Types and Their Sources\n\nTo illustrate the range of interpretations of the concept of freedom\nmade available by MacCallum\u2019s analysis, let us now take a closer\nlook at his second variable \u2014 that of constraints on\nfreedom.\n\nAdvocates of negative conceptions of freedom typically restrict the\nrange of obstacles that count as constraints on freedom to those that\nare brought about by other agents. For theorists who conceive of\nconstraints on freedom in this way, I am unfree only to the extent\nthat other people prevent me from doing certain things. If I\nam incapacitated by natural causes \u2014 by a genetic handicap, say,\nor by a virus or by certain climatic conditions \u2014 I may be\nrendered unable to do certain things, but I am not, for that\nreason, rendered unfree to do them. Thus, if you lock me in\nmy house, I shall be both unable and unfree to leave. But if I am\nunable to leave because I suffer from a debilitating illness or\nbecause a snow drift has blocked my exit, I am nevertheless not\nunfree, to leave. The reason such theorists give, for restricting the\nset of relevant preventing conditions in this way, is that they see\nunfreedom as a social relation \u2014 a relation between\npersons (see Oppenheim 1961; Miller 1983; Steiner 1983;\nKristj\u00e1nsson 1996; Kramer 2003; Morriss 2012; Shnayderman 2013;\nSchmidt 2016). Unfreedom as mere inability is thought by such authors\nto be more the concern of engineers and medics than of political and\nsocial philosophers. (If I suffer from a natural or self-inflicted\ninability to do something, should we to say that I remain\nfree to do it, or should we say that the inability removes my\nfreedom to do it while nevertheless not implying that I am\nunfree to do it? In the latter case, we shall be endorsing a\n\u2018trivalent\u2019 conception, according to which there are some\nthings that a person is neither free nor unfree to do. Kramer 2003\nendorses a trivalent conception according to which freedom is\nidentified with ability and unfreedom is the prevention (by others) of\noutcomes that the agent would otherwise be able to bring about.)\n\nIn attempting to distinguish between natural and social obstacles we\nshall inevitably come across gray areas. An important example is that\nof obstacles created by impersonal economic forces. Do economic\nconstraints like recession, poverty and unemployment merely\nincapacitate people, or do they also render them unfree? Libertarians\nand egalitarians have provided contrasting answers to this question by\nappealing to different conceptions of constraints. Thus, one way of\nanswering the question is by taking an even more restrictive view of\nwhat counts as a constraint on freedom, so that only a subset of the\nset of obstacles brought about by other persons counts as a\nrestriction of freedom: those brought about intentionally. In\nthis case, impersonal economic forces, being brought about\nunintentionally, do not restrict people\u2019s freedom, even\nthough they undoubtedly make many people unable to do many\nthings. This last view has been taken by a number of market-oriented\nlibertarians, including, most famously, Friedrich von Hayek (1960,\n1982), according to whom freedom is the absence of coercion, where to\nbe coerced is to be subject to the arbitrary will of another. (Notice\nthe somewhat surprising similarity between this conception of freedom\nand the republican conception discussed earlier, in section 3.2)\nCritics of libertarianism, on the other hand, typically endorse a\nbroader conception of constraints on freedom that includes not only\nintentionally imposed obstacles but also unintended obstacles for\nwhich someone may nevertheless be held responsible (for Miller and\nKristj\u00e1nsson and Shnayderman this means morally\nresponsible; for Oppenheim and Kramer it means causally\nresponsible), or indeed obstacles created in any way whatsoever, so\nthat unfreedom comes to be identical to inability (see Crocker 1980;\nCohen 2011, pp. 193\u201397; Sen 1992; Van Parijs 1995; Garnett forthcoming).\n\nThis analysis of constraints helps to explain why socialists and\negalitarians have tended to claim that the poor in a capitalist\nsociety are as such unfree, or that they are less free than the rich,\nwhereas libertarians have tended to claim that the poor in a\ncapitalist society are no less free than the rich. Egalitarians\ntypically (though do not always) assume a broader notion than\nlibertarians of what counts as a constraint on freedom. Although this\nview does not necessarily imply what Berlin would call a positive\nnotion of freedom, egalitarians often call their own definition a\npositive one, in order to convey the sense that freedom requires not\nmerely the absence of certain social relations of prevention but the\npresence of abilities, or what Amartya Sen has influentially called\n\u2018capabilities\u2019 (Sen 1985, 1988, 1992; Nussbaum 2006,\n2011). (Important exceptions to this egalitarian tendency to broaden\nthe relevant set of constraints include those who consider poverty to\nindicate a lack of social freedom (see sec. 3.1, above). Steiner\n(1994), grounds a left-libertarian theory of justice in the idea of an\nequal distribution of social freedom, which he takes to imply an equal\ndistribution of resources.)\n\nWe have seen that advocates of a negative conception of freedom tend\nto count only obstacles that are external to the agent. Notice,\nhowever, that the term \u2018external\u2019 is ambiguous in this\ncontext, for it might be taken to refer either to the location of the\ncausal source of an obstacle or to the location of the obstacle\nitself. Obstacles that count as \u2018internal\u2019 in terms of\ntheir own location include psychological phenomena such as ignorance,\nirrational desires, illusions and phobias. Such constraints can be\ncaused in various ways: for example, they might have a genetic origin,\nor they might be brought about intentionally by others, as in the case\nof brainwashing or manipulation. In the first case we have an internal\nconstraint brought about by natural causes, and in this sense\n\u2018internally\u2019; in the second, an internal constraint\nintentionally imposed by another human agent, and in this sense\n\u2018externally\u2019.\n\nMore generally, we can now see that there are in fact two different\ndimensions along which one\u2019s notion of a constraint might be\nbroader or narrower. A first dimension is that of the source\nof a constraint \u2014 in other words, what it is that brings about a\nconstraint on freedom. We have seen, for example, that some theorists\ninclude as constraints on freedom only obstacles brought about by\nhuman action, whereas others also include obstacles with a natural\norigin. A second dimension is that of the type of constraint\ninvolved, where constraint-types include the types of internal\nconstraint just mentioned, but also various types of constraint\nlocated outside the agent, such as physical barriers that render an\naction impossible, obstacles that render the performance of an action\nmore or less difficult, and costs attached to the performance of a\n(more or less difficult) action. The two dimensions of type and source\nare logically independent of one another. Given this independence, it\nis theoretically possible to combine a narrow view of what counts as a\nsource of a constraint with a broad view of what types of obstacle\ncount as unfreedom-generating constraints, or vice versa. As\na result, it is not clear that theorists who are normally placed in\nthe \u2018negative\u2019 camp need deny the existence of internal\nconstraints on freedom (see Kramer 2003; Garnett 2007).\n\nTo illustrate the independence of the two dimensions of type and\nsource, consider the case of the unorthodox libertarian Hillel Steiner\n(1974\u20135, 1994). On the one hand, Steiner has a much\nbroader view than Hayek of the possible sources of\nconstraints on freedom: he does not limit the set of such sources to\nintentional human actions, but extends it to cover all kinds of human\ncause, whether or not any humans intend such causes and whether or not\nthey can be held morally accountable for them, believing that any\nrestriction of such non-natural sources can only be an arbitrary\nstipulation, usually arising from some more or less conscious\nideological bias. On the other hand, Steiner has an even\nnarrower view than Hayek about what type of obstacle\ncounts as a constraint on freedom: for Steiner, an agent only counts\nas unfree to do something if it is physically impossible for\nher to do that thing. Any extension of the constraint variable to\ninclude other types of obstacle, such as the costs anticipated in\ncoercive threats, would, in his view, necessarily involve a reference\nto the agent\u2019s desires, and we have seen (in sec. 2) that for\nthose liberals in the negative camp there is no necessary relation\nbetween an agent\u2019s freedom and her desires. Consider the\ncoercive threat \u2018Your money or your life!\u2019. This does not\nmake it impossible for you to refuse to hand over your money, only\nmuch less desirable for you to do so. If you decide not to hand over\nthe money, you will suffer the cost of being killed. That\nwill count as a restriction of your freedom, because it will\nrender physically impossible a great number of actions on your part.\nBut it is not the issuing of the threat that creates this unfreedom,\nand you are not unfree until the sanction (described in the threat) is\ncarried out. For this reason, Steiner excludes threats \u2014 and\nwith them all other kinds of imposed costs \u2014 from the set of\nobstacles that count as freedom-restricting. This conception of\nfreedom derives from Hobbes (Leviathan, chs. 14 and 21), and\nits defenders often call it the \u2018pure\u2019 negative conception\n(M. Taylor 1982; Steiner 1994; Carter and Kramer 2008) to distinguish\nit from those \u2018impure\u2019 negative conceptions that make at\nleast minimal references to the agent\u2019s beliefs, desires or\nvalues.\n\nSteiner\u2019s account of the relation between freedom and coercive\nthreats might be thought to have counterintuitive implications, even\nfrom the liberal point of view. Many laws that are normally thought to\nrestrict negative freedom do not physically prevent people from doing\nwhat is prohibited, but deter them from doing so by threatening\npunishment. Are we to say, then, that these laws do not restrict the\nnegative freedom of those who obey them? A solution to this problem\nmay consist in saying that although a law against doing some action,\nx, does not remove the freedom to do x, it\nnevertheless renders physically impossible certain\ncombinations of actions that include doing x and\ndoing what would be precluded by the punishment. There is a\nrestriction of the person\u2019s overall negative freedom\n\u2014 i.e. a reduction in the overall number of act-combinations\navailable to her \u2014 even though she does not lose the freedom to\ndo any specific thing taken in isolation (Carter 1999).\n6. The Concept of Overall Freedom\n\nThe concept of overall freedom appears to play an important role both\nin everyday discourse and in contemporary political philosophy. It is\nonly recently, however, that philosophers have stopped concentrating\nexclusively on the meaning of a particular freedom \u2014 the freedom\nto do or become this or that particular thing \u2014 and have started\nasking whether we can also make sense of descriptive claims to the\neffect that one person or society is freer than another, or of liberal\nnormative claims to the effect that freedom should be maximized or\nthat people should enjoy equal freedom or that they each have a right\nto a certain minimum level of freedom. The literal meaningfulness of\nsuch claims depends on the possibility of gauging degrees of overall\nfreedom, sometimes comparatively, sometimes absolutely.\n\nTheorists disagree, however, about the importance of the notion of\noverall freedom. For some libertarian and liberal egalitarian\ntheorists, freedom is valuable as such. This suggests that more\nfreedom is better than less (at least ceteris paribus), and\nthat freedom is one of those goods that a liberal society ought to\ndistribute in a certain way among individuals. For other liberal\ntheorists, like Ronald Dworkin (1977, 2011) and the later Rawls\n(1991), freedom is not valuable as such, and all claims about maximal\nor equal freedom ought to be interpreted not as literal references to\na scalar good called \u2018liberty\u2019 but as elliptical\nreferences to the adequacy of lists of certain particular liberties,\nor types of liberties, selected on the basis of values other than\nliberty itself. Generally speaking, only the first group of theorists\nfinds the notion of overall freedom interesting.\n\nThe theoretical problems involved in measuring overall freedom include\nthat of how an agent\u2019s available actions are to be individuated,\ncounted and weighted, and that of comparing and weighting different\ntypes (but not necessarily different sources) of constraints on\nfreedom (such as physical prevention, punishability, threats and\nmanipulation). How are we to make sense of the claim that the number\nof options available to a person has increased? Should all options\ncount for the same in terms of degrees of freedom, or should they be\nweighted according to their importance in terms of other values? If\nthe latter, does the notion of overall freedom really add anything of\nsubstance to the idea that people should be granted those specific\nfreedoms that are valuable? Should the degree of variety among options\nalso count? And how are we to compare the unfreedom created by the\nphysical impossibility of an action with, say, the unfreedom created\nby the difficulty or costliness or punishability of an action? It is\nonly by comparing these different kinds of actions and constraints\nthat we shall be in a position to compare individuals\u2019 overall\ndegrees of freedom. These problems have been addressed, with differing\ndegrees of optimism, not only by political philosophers (Steiner 1983;\nCarter 1999; Kramer 2003; Garnett 2016; C\u00f4t\u00e9 2020; Carter\nand Steiner 2021) but also by social choice theorists interested in\nfinding a freedom-based alternative to the standard utilitarian or\n\u2018welfarist\u2019 framework that has tended to dominate their\ndiscipline (e.g. Pattanaik and Xu 1991, 1998; Hees 2000; Sen 2002;\nSugden 1998, 2003, 2006; Bavetta 2004; Bavetta and Navarra 2012,\n2014).\n\nMacCallum\u2019s framework is particularly well suited to the\nclarification of such issues. For this reason, theorists working on\nthe measurement of freedom tend not to refer a great deal to the\ndistinction between positive and negative freedom. This said, most of\nthem are concerned with freedom understood as the availability of\noptions. And the notion of freedom as the availability of options is\nunequivocally negative in Berlin\u2019s sense at least where two\nconditions are met: first, the source of unfreedom is limited to the\nactions of other agents, so that natural or self-inflicted obstacles\nare not seen as decreasing an agent\u2019s freedom; second, the\nactions one is free or unfree to perform are weighted in some\nvalue-neutral way, so that one is not seen as freer simply because the\noptions available to one are more valuable or conducive to one\u2019s\nself-realization. Of the above-mentioned authors, only Steiner\nembraces both conditions explicitly. Sen rejects both of them, despite\nnot endorsing anything like positive freedom in Berlin\u2019s\nsense.\n7. Is the Distinction Still Useful?\n\nWe began with a simple distinction between two concepts of liberty,\nand have progressed from this to the recognition that liberty might be\ndefined in any number of ways, depending on how one interprets the\nthree variables of agent, constraints, and purposes. Despite the\nutility of MacCallum\u2019s triadic formula and its strong influence\non analytic philosophers, however, Berlin\u2019s distinction remains\nan important point of reference for discussions about the meaning and\nvalue of political and social freedom. Are these continued references\nto positive and negative freedom philosophically well-founded?\n\nIt might be claimed that MacCallum\u2019s framework is less than\nwholly inclusive of the various possible conceptions of freedom. In\nparticular, it might be said, the concept of self-mastery or\nself-direction implies a presence of control that is not captured by\nMacCallum\u2019s explication of freedom as a triadic relation.\nMacCallum\u2019s triadic relation indicates mere\npossibilities. If one thinks of freedom as involving\nself-direction, on the other hand, one has in mind an exercise-concept\nof freedom as opposed to an opportunity-concept (this distinction\ncomes from C. Taylor 1979). If interpreted as an exercise concept,\nfreedom consists not merely in the possibility of doing\ncertain things (i.e. in the lack of constraints on doing them), but in\nactually doing certain things in certain ways \u2014 for\nexample, in realizing one\u2019s true self or in acting on the basis\nof rational and well-informed decisions. The idea of freedom as the\nabsence of constraints on the realization of given ends might be\ncriticised as failing to capture this exercise concept of freedom, for\nthe latter concept makes no reference to the absence of\nconstraints.\n\nHowever, this defence of the positive-negative distinction as\ncoinciding with the distinction between exercise- and\nopportunity-concepts of freedom has been challenged by Eric Nelson\n(2005). As Nelson points out, most of the theorists that are\ntraditionally located in the positive camp, such as Green or\nBosanquet, do not distinguish between freedom as the absence of\nconstraints and freedom as the doing or becoming of certain things.\nFor these theorists, freedom is the absence of any kind of constraint\nwhatsoever on the realization of one\u2019s true self (they adopt a\nmaximally extensive conception of constraints on freedom). The absence\nof all factors that could prevent the action x is,\nquite simply, equivalent to the realization of x. In other\nwords, if there really is nothing stopping me from doing\nx \u2014 if I possess all the means to do x, and I\nhave a desire to do x, and no desire, irrational or\notherwise, not to do x \u2014 then I do x. An\nequivalent way to characterize the difference between such positive\ntheorists and the so-called negative theorists of freedom lies in the\ndegree of specificity with which they describe x. For those\nwho adopt a narrow conception of constraints, x is described\nwith a low degree of specificity (x could be exemplified by\nthe realization of any of a large array of options); for those who\nadopt a broad conception of constraints, x is described with\na high degree of specificity (x can only be exemplified by\nthe realization of a specific option, or of one of a small group of\noptions).\n\nWhat perhaps remains of the distinction is a rough categorization of\nthe various interpretations of freedom that serves to indicate their\ndegree of fit with the classical liberal tradition. There is indeed a\ncertain family resemblance between the conceptions that are normally\nseen as falling on one or the other side of Berlin\u2019s divide,\ndespite there being some uncertainty about which side to locate\ncertain particular conceptions. One of the decisive factors in\ndetermining this family resemblance is the theorist\u2019s degree of\nconcern with the notion of the self. Those on the\n\u2018positive\u2019 side see questions about the nature and sources\nof a person\u2019s beliefs, desires and values as relevant in\ndetermining that person\u2019s freedom, whereas those on the\n\u2018negative\u2019 side, being more faithful to the classical\nliberal tradition, tend to consider the raising of such questions as\nin some way indicating a propensity to violate the agent\u2019s\ndignity or integrity. One side takes a positive interest in the\nagent\u2019s beliefs, desires and values, while the other recommends\nthat we avoid doing so.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"IntWor\">Introductory works</a>", "<a name=\"OthWor\">Other works</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"IntWor\">Introductory works</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Feinberg, J., 1973, <em>Social Philosophy</em>, New Jersey:\nPrentice-Hall, ch. 1 [article-length general introduction].", "Flickschuh, K., 2007, <em>Freedom.
