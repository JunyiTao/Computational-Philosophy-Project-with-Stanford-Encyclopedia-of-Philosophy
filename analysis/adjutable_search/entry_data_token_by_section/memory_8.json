    "main_text": "Episodicity || Second-order content\n3.2 Second-order content\n\nSecond-order content-based approaches understand episodic memory as\nproviding the rememberer with two types of information: first-order\ninformation about the remembered event itself (as in the first-order\ncontent-based approach) and second-order information about the\nrelationship between the event and the subject\u2019s current memory\nof it. These approaches thus distinguish episodic memory from semantic\nmemory in terms of the self-reflexive character of its\ncontent. McCormack and Hoerl, for example, emphasize the\nrememberer\u2019s grasp of his temporal relationship to the event\n(Hoerl 2001; McCormack & Hoerl 2001, 2008), while\nFern\u00e1ndez emphasizes the rememberer\u2019s\ngrasp of his causal relationship to the event (2006, 2008a,b).\n\nThe self-reflexivity criterion of episodicity is intuitively\nappealing, but it is not without potentially problematic implications.\nIt implies, as noted above, that nonhuman animals (as well as young\nchildren) are incapable of remembering episodically, since only\ncreatures with relatively sophisticated conceptual\ncapacities\u2014including the ability to represent past times as past\nand to represent the self as an enduring entity\u2014are capable of\nentertaining the relevant second-order contents. It also implies that\nthere is a major difference between the contents of retrieved memories\nand the contents of the corresponding original experiences, since it\nsees memories as including content\u2014namely, their second-order,\nself-reflexive component\u2014that is not included in experiences.\nSome have, however, seen the latter implication in a positive light,\narguing that the fact that episodic memory generates new\nknowledge\u2014by informing the subject not only of what\nhappened in the past but also that he knows what happened\nbecause he experienced it\u2014is in fact one of its defining\nfeatures (Dokic 2014; Fern\u00e1ndez 2015a).\n",
