Skow goes on to defend the view that all reasons-why are\ncauses or grounds, and he argues that reasons-why come in levels. At\none level there are reasons why \\(P\\), and at a higher level there are\nreasons why \\(Q\\) is a reason why \\(P\\). For example, if I strike a\nmatch and the match lights, my striking the match is a reason why the\nmatch lit, and the relevant physical laws are reasons why striking the\nmatch is a reason why it lit. These physical laws are not lower-level\nreasons (i.e., reasons why the match lit); thus the higher and lower\nlevels are distinct. The levels are not strictly disjoint, however, as\nthe presence of oxygen in the air is both a reason why the match lit\nand a reason why striking the match is a reason why it lit.\n\nIn the history of theorizing about explanation, Skow argues, the\nhigher and lower levels of reasons-why have been conflated as far back\nas the Deductive-Nomological theory of Hempel and Oppenheim (1948).\nAccording to the D-N model, an answer to the question of why an event\noccurred must cite both prior conditions and a law of nature, and the\noccurrence of the explanandum event must be deducible from the latter\njointly. For example, certain physical laws are involved in the\nlighting of a match when it is struck. According to the D-N model, but\nnot according to the account of reasons-why in Skow 2016, those laws\nare part of the explanation of why the match lit.\n\nWhile acknowledging the distinction between first- and second-level\nreasons-why, Lawler (2019) argues that second-level reasons (in\nparticular, the laws of nature that mediate cause and effect) are\nproperly included in answers to why-questions. If Lawler is right,\nthen, contrary to the account in Skow 2016, an answer to a\nwhy-question need not be a cause or ground.\n\nAnother critic of Skow 2016 is V\u00e4yrynen (2019), who argues that\nwhile Skow\u2019s theory ought to apply to normative explanation as\nwell as to empirical explanation, the theory does not account for\nreason-enablers that are important in normative explanation. Consider\nthe question of why I ought to shovel the snow from my neighbor\u2019s\nsidewalk. That I can do it, V\u00e4yrynen argues, enables other facts\nto be reasons why I ought to, but that I can do it may be neither a\nreason why I ought to do it nor a reason why some other fact is a\nreason why I ought to do it.\n",
