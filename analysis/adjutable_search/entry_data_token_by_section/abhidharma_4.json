    "main_text": "Time: from impermanence to momentariness\n3. Time: from impermanence to momentariness\n\nBoth the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the post-canonical Therav\u0101da\nconstructed a radical doctrine of momentariness (Skt.,\nk\u1e63\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da, Pali,\nkh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da) that atomizes phenomena temporally\nby dissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events\nthat pass out of existence as soon as they have originated. Albeit not\na topic in its own right in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, the\ndoctrine of momentariness appears to have originated in conjunction\nwith the principle of impermanence (Skt., anitya, Pali,\nanicca). This idea is basic to the Buddha\u2019s\nempirically-oriented teaching about the nature of sentient experience:\nall physical and mental phenomena are in a constant process of\nconditioned construction and are interconnected, being dependently\noriginated (e.g., A I 286; M I 230, 336, 500;\nS II 26, III 24\u20135, 96\u20139, IV 214). The Suttanta\nelaboration on these three interlocking ideas results in a formula\n(A I 152) that states that conditioned phenomena (Skt.,\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101r\u0101, Pali,\nsa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101) are of the nature of origination\n(upp\u0101da), \u201cchange of what endures\u201d\n(\u1e6dhitassa a\u00f1\u00f1athatta), and dissolution or\ncessation (vaya). This formula is known as the \u201cthree\ncharacteristics of what is conditioned\u201d\n(tisa\u1e45khatalakkha\u1e47a). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika introduced four\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena: origination, endurance,\ndecay, and dissolution. These are classified under the dharma\ncategory of \u201cfactors dissociated from thought.\u201d\n\nThe Buddhist schools used the characteristics of conditioned phenomena\nas a hermeneutic tool with which to reinterpret impermanence in terms\nof momentariness. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nproposed a fully-fledged doctrine of momentariness according to which\nall physical and mental phenomena are momentary. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins use the term \u201cmoment\u201d\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47a) in a highly technical sense as the\nsmallest, definite unit of time that cannot be subdivided, the length\nof which came to be equated with the duration of mental events as the\nbriefest conceivable entities. There is no Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\nconsensus on the length of a moment, but the texts indicate figures\nbetween 0.13 and 13 milliseconds in modern terms (Gethin 1998, 221;\nvon Rospatt 1995, 94\u2013110). This usage presupposes an atomistic\nconception of time, for time is not reckoned indefinitely divisible.\nIndeed, the term k\u1e63a\u1e47a is often discussed in\njuxtaposition to the concepts of material atoms and syllables, which\nare likewise comprehended as indivisible.\n\nWithin the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, material reality\n(r\u016bpa-dharma) is reduced to discrete momentary atoms,\nand much attention is drawn to ontological and epistemological\nquestions such as whether sense objects are real at any time, or\nwhether atoms contribute separately or collectively to the generation\nof perception. Atomic reality is understood as constantly changing:\nwhat appears to us as a world made up of enduring substances with\nchanging qualities is, in fact, a series of moments that arise and\nperish in rapid succession. This process is not random, but operates\nin accordance with the specific capability and function of each atom.\nThe spirit of this atomistic analysis of material reality applies\nequally to mental reality: consciousness is understood as a succession\nof discrete consciousness moments that arise and cease extremely\n rapidly.[10]\n Thus, the ratio of change between material and mental phenomena in\nany given moment is one to one: they occur in perfect synchronicity\n(Kim 1999, 54). On this point the Sautr\u0101ntika agreed with the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that\nall things exist\u201d) were unique in their stance that the\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena exist separately as real\nentities within each moment. Their claim, then, is that all\nconditioned dharmas\u2014whether past, present, or\nfuture\u2014exist as real entities (dravyatas) within the\nspan of any given moment. This induced a host of problems, one of\nwhich is that the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da definition of a moment is\ndifficult to reconcile with its conception as the shortest unit of\ntime (von Rospatt 1995, 44\u201346 & 97\u201398). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da replies to this criticism by stating that the\nactivities (k\u0101ritra) of the four characteristics of\nconditioned phenomena are sequential: the limits between the birth and\ndissolution of any event are referred to as one moment. This solution,\nhowever, implies that a single event undergoes four phases within a\ngiven moment, which inevitably infringes upon its momentariness (Cox\n1995, 151; von Rospatt 1995, 52ff).\n\nThe Therav\u0101dins created their own distinct version of the\ndoctrine of momentariness. They do not seem to have been as concerned\nas the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins with the ontology and epistemology of\nmaterial and mental realities per se. Rather, they were more\npreoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of\ncognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between\nmaterial and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical\nAbhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the\nterm \u201cmoment\u201d (kha\u1e47a) in the sense of a\nvery brief stretch of time that is divided into origination and\ncessation instants (Kim 1999, 60\u201361). Relying on the three\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena, the Pali commentaries later\npresent a scheme wherein each moment of every phenomenon is subdivided\ninto three different instants of origination\n(upp\u0101dakkha\u1e47a), endurance\n(\u1e6dhitikkha\u1e47a) and cessation\n(bha\u1e45gakkha\u1e47a) (Spk II 266;\nMp II 252). These are three phases of a single momentary\nphenomenon defined as one single dhamma or consciousness\nmoment. A dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second, and ceases in the third (Karunadasa 2010, 234ff). The\ncommentarial tradition thus analyzes phenomena temporally by\ndissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events that\nfall away as soon as they have originated in consciousness. As one\nevent is exhausted, it conditions a new event of its kind that\nproceeds immediately afterwards. The result is an uninterrupted,\nflowing continuum (sant\u0101na) of causally connected\nmomentary events. These succeed each other so fast that we conceive of\nthe phenomena they constitute as temporally extended.\n\nThe Therav\u0101dins use the term kha\u1e47a as the\nexpression for a brief instant, the dimension of which is not fixed\nbut may be determined by the context. For example,\ncittakkha\u1e47a refers to the instant taken by one\nmental event. In this basic sense as denoting a very brief stretch of\ntime, the term \u201cmoment\u201d does not entail an atomistic\nconception of a definite and ultimate, smallest unit of time, but\nleaves open the possibility that time is infinitely divisible (von\nRospatt 1995, 59\u201360 & 94\u201395). Here the three moments\nof origination, endurance, and cessation do not correspond to three\ndifferent entities. Rather, they represent three phases of a single\nmomentary phenomenon and are defined as one single consciousness\nmoment: a dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second sub-moment and perishes in the third one. In this way, the\nTherav\u0101dins avoided some of the difficulties faced by the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, of how to compress the\ncharacteristics of the conditioned into one single indivisible moment\nand of how to account for their ontological status. The\nTherav\u0101dins also claimed that only mental phenomena are\nmomentary, whereas material phenomena (e.g., common-sense objects)\nendure for a stretch of time. The Therav\u0101din commentarial\ntradition subsequently elaborated on this proposition and produced a\nunique view of the ratio between material and mental phenomena,\nasserting that a material phenomenon lasts for sixteen or seventeen\nconsciousness moments (Kv 620; Vibh-a 25\u201328;\nVism XX 24\u201326; Kim 1999, 79\u201380 &\n\u00a73.1).\n\nDespite their different interpretations of the concept of\nmomentariness, the early Buddhist schools all derived this concept\nfrom the analysis of impermanence in terms of the dynamics of\ndharmas qua physical and mental events. The equation of a\nmoment with the duration of these transient events as extremely short\noccurrences\u2014even the shortest conceivable\u2014led to the\ndirect determination of the moment in terms of these occurrences. Yet\nthe doctrine of momentariness spawned a host of problems for the\nBuddhist schools, particularly with regard to the status of the\nendurance moment and to the explanation of continuity and conditioning\ninteraction among the dharmas (see section 5 below). If\ndharmas go through an endurance phase or exist as real\nentities within the span of any given moment, how can they be\nmomentary? And if experience is an array of strictly momentary\ndharmas, how can continuity and causal conditioning be\npossible?\n\nOne might argue that the conceptual shift from\n\u201cimpermanence\u201d to \u201cendurance\u201d is a result of\nscholastic literalism and testifies to the Abhidharma tendency towards\nreification and hypostatization of dharmas (Gombrich 1996,\n36\u201337, 96\u201397 & 106\u2013107). Nevertheless, the\nobject of the doctrine of momentariness is not so much existence in\ntime or the passage of time per se, but rather, in epistemological\nterms and a somewhat Bergsonian sense, the construction of temporal\nexperience. Instead of a transcendental matrix of order imposed on\nnatural events from without, time is seen as an inherent feature of\nthe operation of dharmas. The doctrine of momentariness\nanalyzes dharmas as they transpire through time: as\npsycho-physical events that arise and cease in consciousness and, by\nthe dynamics of their rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of\nthe three times is therefore secondary, generated in and by the\nprocess of conditioned and conditioning dharmas. In fact, the\nconceptual shift from the principle of impermanence to the theory of\nmomentariness is a shift in time scales. While the S\u016btr\u0101nta\nworldview interprets the three times as referring to past, present,\nand future lives, the Abhidharma sees them as phases that any\nconditioned dharma undergoes each and every moment.\nImpermanence marks dharmas over a period of time, but is also\nencapsulated in every single consciousness moment (Vibh-a\n7\u20138; Sv 991; Vism XIV 191; Collins 1992, 227).\n",
