    "main_text": "Methodological Issues || Translating the Truth\n4.3 Translating the Sounds of Silence\nThese two different senses of \u201ctruth\u201d bespeak two\ndifferent orientations toward philosophy and its purposes; we might\nloosely refer to them as truth- seeking and way-making. The\ntruth-seeking approach is familiar to us, being at the heart of the\nWestern intellectual tradition, in science no less than\nphilosophy. And philosophical analysis, hermeneutics and phenomenology\nare all tried and true methods for teasing the (propositional) truth\nfrom texts. The model for writing in this philosophical tradition is\nclarity and precision of expression (at least in the analytic\nschool).\nIt is not at all clear, however, that those methods are equally\nappropriate for working with Chinese texts much of the time. There are\ntwo reasons for this, the first of which is the Chinese model of\nwriting. Hark back to the discussion of classical Chinese earlier\n(\u00a71\u20131.4) while reading the following two quotes. First,\nfrom some NLP computer scientists:\n\nClassical Chinese poetry \u2026 is particularly concise, finely\nrich, highly rhetorical and thus linguistically complex, requiring a\nhigh degree of creativity in writing it, sophisticated interpretation\nin reading it, and difficulty in understanding it. (Fang, et\nal. 2009).\nThe comment is specifically about poetry but the point is fairly\ngeneral, especially for the canonical texts of the early period. For\nthe next quote, readers should keep in mind the Western philosophical\nmodel of writing, with clarity and precision the most valued narrative\nqualities. Michael Nylan again (2011: 66):\n Polysemy eminently suits the serious classical\nturn. For where words have more than one meaning, their appearance is\napt to induce an initial state of confusion. This confusion proves\nuseful if it makes readers aware that it is context and context alone\nthat determines the values and valences that words assume in any piece\nof writing, binding author to reader in the construction and\nreconstruction of meaning.\nIf analytic and hermeneutic methods do not get us to the\n\u201ctruths\u201d found in the classical texts, what other methods\nmight be employed? Leigh Jenco (2007) has argued that while the\nnon-Western orientation in comparative philosophy is clear from the\ntexts studied, the possibilities for using\nnon-western methodologies for philosophical inquiry into\nthose texts are not, and hence the adequacy of Eurocentric approaches\nto the discipline can be maintained, as well as the \u201cnot really\nphilosophy\u201d charge frequently levelled against Chinese texts\nbecause they do not contain arguments, are ambiguous, have little\nempirical or logical content, etc. Put another way, while Chinese\ntexts can become objects of study for the ideas contained in them,\ntheir methods of scholarly inquiry never enter the picture, continuing\nthereby to legitimate a Eurocentric approach to scholarly\nmethodologies.\nKalmanson (2017) picks up on Jenco\u2019s themes,\ndescribing Chinese methods for gaining insights from Chinese texts\nsuch as ritual preparation before reading them, meditation,\nmemorization and recitation. At first blush it might seem bizarre to\nsuggest that the performance of rituals, memorization and recitation\nshould be called \u201cmethods\u201d for interrogating philosophical\ntexts. But the bizarreness can lessen if we can get away from\npropositional truth, knowing-that, and expository models of clarity\nand precision.  The classical Chinese texts are composites more or\nless, are neither clear nor precise, are extremely terse, appeal to\nthe eye and the ear equally, and are replete with ambiguities. Yet the\nChinese have long held that those texts, composed and/or edited by the\nsages, contain all the truths needed to lead an exemplary life, a\nbelief firmly held by many for over 2000 years\u2014and still held by\nmore than a few today. Is it possible that we may gain more insight\ninto the \u201ctruths\u201d of the Daodejing by memorizing\nand then reciting it than by subjecting it to logical and linguistic\nanalysis?  The famous scholar-philosopher Zhu Xi of the\n13th century suggested how we should read, and his advice\nis perhaps an appropriate coda to this entry on issues in translating\nand interpreting Chinese philosophy:\n There is layer upon layer [of meaning] in the words of\nthe sages. In your reading of them, penetrate deeply. If you simply\nread what is on the surface you will misunderstand. Steep yourself in\nthe words; only then will you grasp their meaning.
