The basic notions of the theory are very general.\nEssentially, the theory applies whenever one has a question that\nprompts inquiry, a number of candidate answers, and some evidence for\ndeciding among the answers. Thus means-ends analysis can be applied in\nany discipline aimed at empirical knowledge, for example physics or\npsychology.\nContext Dependence. Learning theory is pure normative a\npriori epistemology in the sense that it deals with standards for\nassessing methods in possible settings of inquiry. But the approach\ndoes not aim for universal, context-free methodological maxims. The\nmethodological recommendations depend on contingent factors, such as\nthe operative methodological norms, the questions under investigation,\nthe background assumptions that the agent brings to inquiry, the\nobservational means at her disposal, her cognitive capacities, and her\nepistemic aims. As a consequence, to evaluate specific methods in a\ngiven domain, as in the case studies mentioned, one has to study the\ndetails of the case in question. The means-ends analysis often rewards\nthis study by pointing out what the crucial methodological features of\na given scientific enterprise are, and by explaining precisely why and\nhow these features are connected to the success of the enterprise in\nattaining its epistemic aims.\nTrade-offs. In the perspective of means-ends epistemology,\ninquiry involves an ongoing struggle with hard choices, rather than\nthe execution of a universal \u201cscientific method\u201d. The\ninquirer has to balance conflicting values, and may consider various\nstrategies such as accepting difficulties in the short run hoping to\nresolve them in the long run. For example in the conservation law\nproblem, there can be conflicts between theoretical parsimony, i.e.,\npositing fewer conservation laws, and ontological parsimony, i.e.,\nintroducing fewer hidden particles. For another example, a particle\ntheorist may accept positing undetected particles in the hopes that\nthey will eventually be observed as science progresses. The search for\nthe Higgs boson illustrates this strategy. An important\nlearning-theoretic project is to examine when such tradeoffs arise and\nwhat the options for resolving them are. Section 4 extends\nlearning-theoretic analysis to consider goals in addition to long-run\nreliability.\n\n",
