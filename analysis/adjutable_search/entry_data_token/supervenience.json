Introduction\n\nThe core idea of supervenience is captured by the slogan, \u201cthere\ncannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference.\u201d It is important to notice the word\n\u2018cannot\u2019. Supervenience claims do not merely say that it\njust so happens that there is no A-difference\nwithout a B-difference; they say that there cannot\nbe one. A-properties supervene on B-properties if\nand only if a difference in A-properties requires a\ndifference in B-properties\u2014or, equivalently, if and\nonly if exact similarity with respect to B-properties\nguarantees exact similarity with respect to\nA-properties. Supervenience claims thus have modal force. The\nkind of modal force can vary; different supervenience claims might\nattribute different kinds of necessity to the connection between\nB-properties and A-properties (see\n Section 3.1.)\n Even when the modality is fixed, however, there are a number of\ndistinct claims that might be expressed by the slogan. A good deal of\nphilosophical work has gone into distinguishing these forms of\nsupervenience, and into examining their pairwise logical\nrelations.\n\nWe will begin with a few brief historical remarks\n (Section 2),\n and then turn to some general questions about supervenience, such as\nwhether it is explanatory and whether it is guarantees entailment\n (Section 3).\n We will then explore the various versions of supervenience in some\ndetail\n (Section 4).\n The technical work is interesting in its own right, but it is\nobviously made more interesting by the fact that the different\nvarieties of supervenience may be useful for different philosophical\npurposes. Thus, although most of this entry will be concerned with\nsupervenience itself rather than its applications, we will end with a\ndiscussion of some of the substantive philosophical issues to which\nsupervenience is relevant\n (Section 5).\n\nReaders primarily interested only in an overview of the relations\nbetween the main varieties of supervenience should skip to\n Section 4.\n The technical definitions are also collated in an\n Appendix.\n\n2. History\n2.1 \u2018Supervenience\u2019 as a Philosophical Term of Art\n\n\u2018Supervenience\u2019 and its cognates are technical terms. This\nis not news; \u2018supervene\u2019 is rarely used outside the\nphilosophy room these days. But it occasionally is, and when it is, it\ntypically has a different meaning. It is typically used to mean\n\u201ccoming or occurring as something additional, extraneous, or\nunexpected\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary, 3rd edition). This is the sense at issue\nin the following passages from the Oxford English Dictionary:\n\u201cupon a sudden supervened the death of the king\n(1674\u201348)\u201d and \u201cThe king was bruised by the pommel\nof his saddle; fever supervened, and the injury proved fatal\n(1867)\u201d (cited in Kim 1990, 2\u20133). It is also the sense at\nissue in W.V.O. Quine\u2019s autobiographical remark about his\nadolescence: \u201cnecking, as it was called, supervened in the\nfullness of time as necking will\u201d (1985, 43). However, this use\nof \u2018supervenience\u2019 is irrelevant to the philosophical use\nof the term. The philosophical use of \u2018supervenience\u2019 is\nstrictly proprietary, and so in no way beholden to its vernacular\nuse(s). In this way, \u2018supervene\u2019 is different from terms\nlike \u2018cause,\u2019 \u2018freedom,\u2019 or\n\u2018justice\u2019. \u2018Supervene\u2019 receives its sense by\nstipulation, and the notion so defined is to be judged by its\nphilosophical fruits (McLaughlin 1995).\n2.2 Origin of the Term\n\nWhat, then, is the origin of the philosophical use of the\nterm? It is not clear. Some have speculated that it originates with\nthe British Emergentists of the early part of the twentieth century.\nThis is because the British Emergentist Lloyd Morgan (1923) used the\nterm \u2018supervene\u2019 to characterize a relation that emergent\nproperties bear to their base properties, and his use became fairly\nwidespread in the literature on emergence. However, Morgan used\n\u2018supervene\u2019 in essentially its vernacular sense, rather\nthan in its current philosophical sense. He held that emergent\nproperties are distinct from, and additional to, their base\nproperties, and arise unpredictably from them. It was this use, not\nthe current philosophical use, that became fairly widespread in the\nliterature on emergence (see Van Cleve 1990; and McLaughlin 1992 and\n1997b).\n\nIt is also frequently claimed that the term \u2018supervene\u2019\nwas first used in its contemporary philosophical sense by R.M. Hare,\nwho used it to characterize a relationship between moral properties\nand natural properties (1952, 145). Unlike Morgan, Hare used the term\nin essentially the current philosophical sense, but he claims that he\nwas not the first to do so. He claims that the term was so used in\nOxford in the 1940s, though he does not recall by whom, or in what\ncontext (Hare 1984).\n\nIt is important to be clear, however, that whether or not Hare was the\nfirst to use the term \u2018supervene\u2019 in the philosophical\nsense, he was by no means the first to assert a supervenience thesis.\nFor example, while G. E. Moore did not use the term\n\u2018supervene\u2019, he asserted: \u201cone of the most important\nfacts about qualitative difference\u2026[is that] two things cannot\ndiffer in quality without differing in intrinsic nature\u201d (1922,\n263). And there are many other historical examples of such explicit\nstatements of supervenience theses. Moreover, though we are not going\nto argue the point here, it seems no exaggeration to say that\nvirtually every major figure in the history of western philosophy has\nbeen at least implicitly committed to some supervenience thesis or\nother (or to the denial of one).\n\nBut regardless of how long the notion of supervenience has been\naround, or who first used the term \u2018supervenience\u2019 in its\nphilosophical sense, it is indisputable that Donald Davidson played a\nkey role in bringing the idea to center stage. He introduced the term\n\u2018supervenience\u2019 into contemporary philosophy of mind in\nthe following passage:\n\n[M]ental characteristics are in some sense dependent, or supervenient,\non physical characteristics. Such supervenience might be taken to mean\nthat there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but\ndiffering in some mental respect, or that an object cannot alter in\nsome mental respect without altering in some physical respect (1970,\n214).\n\n\nAfter Davidson\u2019s appeal to supervenience, Terence Horgan (1982,\n1984), Jaegwon Kim (1984, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1993), David Lewis (1983),\nand others began to examine the notion of supervenience itself, and to\nexplore its usefulness for a wide variety of philosophical purposes.\nThe literature then mushroomed.\n3. Supervenience and Other Relations\n\nPhilosophers have distinguished many different varieties of\nsupervenience. In\n Section 4,\n we will lay out those varieties, and note their pairwise logical\nrelations. For now, though, we will stick to the core idea of\nsupervenience\u2014namely, that there cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference. A number of\ngeneral points of philosophical interest can be made just by working\nwith that simple and easy idea.\n3.1 The Modal Force of the Supervenience Relation\n\nIn order to sort out how supervenience connects up to other\nrelations\u2014like entailment, reduction, grounding, ontological\ndependence, and explanation\u2014we need to discuss the fact that\nsupervenience can hold with varying degrees of modal force. That is,\nthe \u2018cannot\u2019 in \u201cthere cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference\u201d comes in\ndifferent strengths. For example, it can mean \u201ccannot as a\nmatter of logic,\u201d or it can mean \u201ccannot consistently with\nthe laws of nature\u201d.\n\nThis raises some controversial issues. For the purposes of this essay,\nwe make the following three assumptions. First, we assume that\nmetaphysical necessity is just as strong as logical necessity. There\nare, to be sure, metaphysically necessary truths that are not logical\ntruths, such as the truth that water = H20.\nBut metaphysical necessity is just as strong as logical necessity in\nthat the space of metaphysical possibility is exactly the same as the\nspace of logically possibility: the logically possible worlds = the\nmetaphysically possible worlds (see, e.g., McLaughlin 1995; Chalmers\n1996; and Jackson 1998). This is not entirely uncontroversial, but\nlittle we have to say turns on it. Second, and more importantly in\nwhat follows, we assume that at least certain properties that figure\nin laws of nature do not play their nomic roles essentially, so that\nit is logically or metaphysically possible for those properties not to\nfigure in the laws in question. This is also controversial, but we\nwill not defend it here. (See Shoemaker 1980, Swoyer 1982, and Ellis\n2001 for the opposing view.) Finally, we will assume that whatever is\nmetaphysically necessary is nomologically necessary, but not\nconversely. (One can hold that there are nomologically necessary\ntruths that are not metaphysically necessary, even if one holds that\nall nomic properties play their nomic roles essentially; see Fine\n2002.)\n\nSome supervenience relations are metaphysically (or logically)\nnecessary. The property being a haircut or a halibut\nsupervenes with metaphysical necessity on the two base properties\nbeing a haircut and being a halibut: two things\ncannot differ with respect to being a haircut or a halibut\nwithout differing either with respect to being a haircut or\nelse with respect to being a halibut. Also, the surface areas\nof perfect spheres supervene with metaphysical necessity on their\nvolumes (and vice versa) (Lombard 1986). Some supervenience\nrelations are metaphysically contingent. Consider the Wiedemann-Franz\nLaw, which entails that the electrical conductivity of a metal\nco-varies with its thermal conductivity. This law thus entails that\nelectrical conductivity and thermal conductivity mutually supervene on\neach other. But on the assumption that the law is metaphysically\ncontingent, the supervenience relation is too. It is only\nnomologically necessary that there cannot be a difference in one sort\nof conductivity without a difference in the other sort.\n\nSo, supervenience relations can hold with either metaphysical or\nnomological necessity, and perhaps even with some other kind of\nnecessity. The fact that supervenience comes in different modal\nstrengths is important. Sometimes there is widespread agreement that a\ncertain supervenience relation holds, but dispute over what its modal\nforce is. One important example is the supervenience of the mental on\nthe physical. Just about everyone, even a Cartesian dualist, believes\nsome version of this supervenience claim. But there is vigorous\ndisagreement about whether the supervenience relation holds with\nmetaphysical or merely nomological necessity. Ask yourself\u2014could\nthere be an individual that has no conscious experience at all,\ndespite being physically indiscernible from an individual that is\nconscious (Kirk 1994; Chalmers 1996)? That is, could there be what\nphilosophers call a \u2018zombie\u2019? Because it is widely agreed\nthat the mental nomologically supervenes on the physical, it is widely\nagreed that zombies are nomologically impossible\u2014that their\nexistence would violate psychophysical laws. But some philosophers\n(e.g., Chalmers 1996) think that zombies are metaphysically possible.\nThis remains a matter of lively dispute, and resolving it requires\naddressing some hard questions about the relationship between\nconceivability and metaphysical possibility. Suffice it to note that\nthe dispute is precisely over the modal force of the\n\u2018cannot\u2019 in \u201cthere cannot be a mental difference\nwithout a physical difference.\u201d (For discussions of the\nrelationship between conceivability and metaphysical possibility see,\ne.g., the essays in Gendler and Hawthorne 2002. For a discussion of\nphysicalism, see\n Section 5.4\n of this entry and the separate entry on\n physicalism.)\n3.2 Supervenience and Entailment\n\nIs supervenience a form of entailment? The two relations are logically\nsimilar in certain ways. The entailment relation is reflexive,\ntransitive, and non-symmetric, and so is supervenience. Supervenience\nis reflexive: for any set of properties A, there cannot be an\nA-difference without an A-difference (see, e.g., Kim\n1984). It is also transitive: if A-properties supervene on\nB-properties, and B-properties supervene on\nC-properties, then A-properties supervene on\nC-properties. However, supervenience is neither symmetric nor\nasymmetric; it is non-symmetric. Sometimes it holds\nsymmetrically. Every reflexive case of supervenience is trivially a\nsymmetric case; consider also the case of the volume and surface area\nof perfect spheres mentioned in\n Section 3.1.\n And sometimes it holds asymmetrically. For example, while the mental\nmay supervene on the physical, the physical does not supervene on the\nmental. There can be physical differences without mental differences.\nOne uncontroversial way to see this is to note that radically\nphysically different things\u2014a washing machine and a paper bag,\nsay\u2014can be mentally just alike in virtue of lacking mental\nproperties altogether. Thus supervenience, like entailment, is\nreflexive, transitive, and non-symmetric.\n\nNonetheless, that B-properties entail A-properties\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for A-properties to\nsupervene on B-properties. (The notion of property entailment\nin play is this: property P entails property Q just\nin case it is metaphysically necessary that anything that possesses\nP also possesses Q.) To see that such entailments do\nnot suffice for supervenience, consider the properties being a\nbrother and being a sibling. Possessing the former\nentails possessing the latter; every brother is a sibling. But\nbeing a sibling does not supervene on being a\nbrother. Two people can differ with respect to being a sibling\ndespite being exactly alike with respect to being a brother. To see\nthis, suppose that Sarah has a sister and Jack is an only child. Thus\nSarah is a sibling and Jack is not, though neither is a brother. So\nthe B-properties can entail the A-properties, even\nthough A does not supervene on B.\n\nTo see that supervenience does not suffice for entailment, recall that\nsupervenience can hold with only nomological necessity. In such cases,\nthere is no entailment; thermal conductivity properties do not\nentail electrical conductivity properties, for example.\n\nBut what about supervenience with metaphysical or\nlogical necessity? Even that does not in general guarantee\nthat there are B-properties that entail the\nA-properties. At best, the logical supervenience of\nA on B means that how something is B-wise\nentails how it is A-wise. But it does not follow that every\nA-property is entailed by a B-property, or even that\nsome A-property is entailed by a B-property.\nConsider two examples. First, on the assumption that there are\nnegative properties, every property F will supervene with\nlogical necessity on its complement not-F. After all, two\nthings cannot differ with respect to whether they are F\nwithout differing with respect to whether they are not-F, and\nconversely. But obviously being F does not entail being\nnot-F (McLaughlin 1995, 1997a). Second, consider a case in\nwhich the property set B contains only the property\nP and the property Q, and property set A is\nthe unit set of the conjunctive property P&Q.\nThat is, A = {P&Q}, and B =\n{P, Q}. A supervenes with metaphysical\nnecessity on B. But there is no property in B that\nentails the A-property.\n\nNow, there might be special sets of properties for which the\nsupervenience of A on B guarantees that there are\nB-properties that entail the\nA-properties\u2014namely, property sets that are closed\nunder the Boolean operations of complementation, infinitary\nconjunction, infinitary disjunction (see Kim 1984), and operations\ninvolving quantification. Closing {F} and {~F} under\nthese operations will result in the same set, namely {F,\n~F, F & ~F, F v\n~F\u2026}. In both cases just above, then, the\nclosure of B under these operations in fact contains\na property that entails the A-property.\n\nDiscussions of supervenience often appeal to property sets that are\nclosed under such operations. But this is not a trivial assumption,\nfor two reasons. First, it is controversial whether complementation,\nconjunction, and disjunction are legitimate property-forming\noperations. Whether they are largely depends upon what properties are\ntaken to be. If properties are just the semantic values of predicates,\nthen there are negative, conjunctive, and disjunctive properties,\nbecause negative, conjunctive, and disjunctive predicates can have\nsemantic values. But if properties are universals there may not be any\nsuch properties (Armstrong 1978, 1989). And if properties are ways a\nthing might be, then property sets cannot be closed under Boolean\noperations. That would entail that for any property F,\nbeing F and ~F is also a property. However,\nthat is not a way anything might be. (However, see Priest 2010 for an\nopposing view.) Second, even if it is assumed that the\nproperty-forming operations are legitimate, the fact is that we are\nquite often interested in property sets that are not closed under\nthem. Consider negation. Even assuming that there are negative\nproperties, the fact is that we do not standardly count cats as having\ngeological properties because they are neither ignaceous, sedimentary,\nnor metamorphic. And it seems strange to say that Descartes was\ncommitted to mental substances having physical properties simply\nbecause he thought they are not spatially extended. Since not every\nproperty set is closed under every property-forming operation,\nsupervenience is not in general sufficient for entailment. (For\nfurther discussion of supervenience and various property-forming\noperations, see Van Cleve 1990; Oddie and Tichy 1990; Bacon 1990,\n1995; Glanzberg 2001; Bader 2012.)\n\nOne particularly interesting case of entailment failure arises when\nthe property sets are not closed under quantification. This opens room\nfor cases in which the supervening set A contains properties\nformed by quantification, like being such that every F is a\nG, and the subvening set B does not. If B does\nnot include such properties, there are no properties in B\nthat entail them. As Bertrand Russell noted many years ago, \u201cyou\ncannot ever arrive at a general fact by [deductive] inference from\nparticular facts, however numerous\u201d (Russell 1918, 235; quoted\nin Bricker 2005). But general properties, nevertheless, logically\nsupervene on particular ones: no two possible worlds can differ in\nwhat general facts hold without differing in what particular facts\nhold (see Skyrms 1981, Lewis 1992, and Bricker 2005). Thus, general\nfacts logically supervene on particular facts, even though the latter\ndo not entail the former.\n\nThe upshot is that the logical supervenience of property set\nA on property set B will only guarantee that each\nA-property is entailed by some B-property if\nA and B are closed under both infinitary Boolean\noperations and property-forming operations involving\nquantification.\n3.3 Supervenience and Reduction\n\nEveryone agrees that reduction requires supervenience. This is\nparticularly obvious for those who think that reduction requires\nproperty identity, because supervenience is reflexive. But on any\nreasonable view of reduction, if some set of A-properties\nreduces to a set of B-properties, there cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference. This is true\nboth of ontological reductions and what might be called\n\u201cconceptual reductions\u201d\u2014i.e., conceptual\nanalyses.\n\nThe more interesting issue is whether supervenience suffices for\nreduction (see Kim 1984, 1990). This depends upon what reduction is\ntaken to require. If it is taken to require property identity or\nentailment, then, as we have just seen\n (Section 3.2),\n even supervenience with logical necessity is not sufficient for\nreduction. Further, if reduction requires that certain epistemic\nconditions be met, then, once again, supervenience with logical\nnecessity is not sufficient for reduction. That A supervenes\non B as a matter of logical necessity need not be knowable\na priori.\n3.4. Supervenience and Ontological Innocence\n\nThe issues about entailment and reduction are related to a question\nabout whether supervenience with metaphysical necessity is\nontologically innocent\u2014whether the\nA-properties are anything \u201cover and above\u201d the\nB-properties. \n\nSome think that supervenience\u2014at least when accompanied by\ngrounding; see\n sect. 3.5\n below\u2014is indeed ontologically innocent in this sense. After\nall, if the A-properties supervene with metaphysical necessity on the\nB-properties, then they come along automatically given the\nB-properties. To borrow Kripke\u2019s metaphor (1972, 153\u2013154),\nonce God fixes the B-properties, she is all done; she does not need to\ndo anything further to get the A-properties going. Indeed, she cannot\nblock them. Given the distribution of B-properties, there is no\nfurther question about which A-properties are instantiated. So, it is\nclaimed, the latter are nothing over and above the former. However,\nother people vigorously resist this idea. How can the A-properties not\ncount as a further ontological commitment, if they are numerically\ndistinct from the B-properties? (Both Jonathan Schaffer (2015) and\nKaren Bennett (2017, chapter 8.2) have recently argued that the best\nway to make sense of this is as follows. Grounded entities are\nnonfundamental, and nonfundamental entities do not count against the\nsimplicity of a theory, although they do count towards the total\nnumber of things there are.) \n\nThis dispute is central to various issues in metaphysics and the\nphilosophy of mind. For example, nonreductive physicalists often say\nthat mental properties are distinct from but nonetheless\n\u201cnothing over and above\u201d physical ones. Their reductivist\nopponents, however, clearly think that this is illegitimate. This can\nbe seen in the charge that nonreductive physicalists face the\nexclusion problem\u2014that they are unable to account for the causal\nefficacy of the mental without claiming that all of its effects are\n\u201cdouble-caused.\u201d (See the entry on\n mental causation.)\n\nAnother example concerns composition. Some people\u2014those who\nbelieve in \u201cunrestricted mereological\ncomposition\u201d\u2014think that any two or more things whatsoever\ncompose a larger thing. They typically claim that while the (single)\nfusion is not identical to its (many) parts (the exception is\nBaxter 1988), it does supervene on them, and is thus \u201cnothing\nover and above\u201d those parts. So, for example, there is a\nmereological fusion of your left elbow, Tony Blair, and the\nMississippi River, and it is distinct from, but nothing over and\nabove, those three parts. Lewis, speaking of a fusion of a trout and a\nturkey, says that \u201cit is neither fish nor fowl, but it is\nnothing else: it is part fish and part fowl\u201d (1991, 80) and that\n\u201cmereology is innocent\u201d (87). However, opponents of\nunrestricted mereological composition are unsurprisingly unconvinced:\n\u201cwhat does \u2018nothing over and above\u2019 mean? This\nslippery phrase has had a lot of employment in philosophy, but what it\nmeans is never explained by its employers\u201d (van Inwagen 1994,\n210). Indeed, the thought that composition is not in the least\nontologically innocent has led some to claim that there aren\u2019t\nany composite objects (or that living organisms are the only composite\nobjects; see van Inwagen 1990, Merricks 2001, Dorr and Rosen 2002, and\nthe entry on\n mereology).\n\nSo, on the one hand, there is what might be called the\n\u201csupervenience intuition\u201d. Many nonreductive physicalists\nthink that the metaphysically necessary supervenience of the mental on\nthe physical means that mental properties are nothing over and above\nphysical ones, and most (all?) believers in unrestricted mereological\ncomposition think that the metaphysically necessary supervenience of\nfusions on their parts means that fusions are nothing over and above\nthose parts. On the other hand, there is what might be called the\n\u201cdistinctness intuition\u201d\u2014if mental properties and\nmereological fusions are distinct from physical properties\nand mereological atoms, respectively, then surely they count as\nsomething over and above them. \n\nThis can be made to look as though it is just a terminological issue\nabout how to best use phrases like \u201cnothing over and\nabove\u201d and \u201contological innocence\u201d. But there are\nvery real issues here. The central difference between the two sides is\nthat one emphasizes the fact that the two kinds of properties or\nentities are numerically distinct, and the other emphasizes the fact\nthat there is nonetheless a close nonidentity relation\nbetween them. And what matters in any given case is i) just which\nparticular nonidentity relation holds, and ii) whether the fact that\nthat relation holds is enough to defuse whatever problem is on the\ntable. \n\nIn the mereological fusion case, the issue is really just whether\nfusions exist at all. Those who believe in unrestricted mereological\ncomposition think that the existence of the atoms entails the\nexistence of the fusions, and their opponents do not. The debate here\nis only about whether the fusions are (or would be if they existed)\nanything \u201cover and above\u201d their parts insofar as that\nwould perhaps make them a significant ontological commitment, leading\nsome (not Schaffer or Bennett; see above) to be suspicious of the\nprinciple of unrestricted mereological composition.\n\nIn the nonreductive physicalism case, the issue is about whether all\nnonidentity relations are on a par as far as the exclusion argument is\nconcerned. Nonreductive physicalists think that mental properties\nsupervene with metaphysical necessity upon physical properties\n(whether they are also entailed by physical properties depends upon\nwhat property-forming operations the set of physical properties is\ntaken to be closed under; see\n Section 3.2).\n The interesting question is not whether this enables them to truly\nsay that mental properties are \u201cnothing over and above\u201d\nphysical ones, but rather whether it enables them to solve the\nexclusion problem. (For views that more or less say that it does, see\nYablo 1987, Shoemaker 2001, Bennett 2003, Melnyk 2003). Note that this\nissue also arises in the case of mereological fusions; Merricks (2001)\nuses a version of the exclusion problem to argue against the existence\nof nonliving composites.\n\nOne more example, which is similar to the fusion case. We have just\nseen that general truths supervene with metaphysical necessity on\nparticular truths, but are not entailed by them\n (Section 3.2).\n This led Russell to say that \u201cyou must admit general facts as\ndistinct from and over and above particular facts\u201d (1918, 236).\nIt would be a mistake to focus too much on Russell\u2019s claim that\ngeneral facts are \u201cover and above\u201d particular facts; he\nclearly just means that they are numerically distinct from particular\nfacts. The interesting issue is rather whether Russell is right that\nwe must admit general facts into our ontology at all. (See Bricker\n2005 for an argument to the contrary.)\n\nAll told, there may not be a straightforward answer to the question of\nwhether supervenience with metaphysical necessity is ontologically\ninnocent. Whether it is depends upon whether it is a tight enough\nrelation to do the work required to solve whatever concern is in play,\nand that will obviously depend upon what that concern is. So\nwhether metaphysically necessary supervenience is \u201contologically\ninnocent\u201d may well depend upon the case. In one case,\nmetaphysically necessary supervenience might do the job, in another\ncase entailment might be required, and in another perhaps nothing\nshort of numerical identity will do.\n3.5 Supervenience, Grounding, and Ontological Dependence\n\nThere is now a large literature on grounding and ontological\ndependence, including an entry for each in this encyclopedia. Roughly,\none fact grounds another when the latter obtains in virtue of the\nformer: the former in some sense makes the latter obtain. It is a\nproductive, generative relation. (Bennett 2017 claims that there are\nseveral such relations, which she calls building relations. Talk of\nproduction and generation naturally invites a question about the\nrelation between grounding or building and causation; see Schaffer\n2016, Bennett 2017 chapter 4, Bernstein 2017, and A. Wilson 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relation between grounding and causation.) Roughly,\nan entity ontologically depends on another when the former would not\nexist without the latter. Much, much more can be and has been said\nabout these relations, but this is enough for our purposes. \n\nGrounding and ontological dependence are distinct from each other. The\nsimplest way to see this is by means of the kinds of case that\nrevealed to David Lewis that causation is distinct from causal\ndependence (1973): preemption and overdetermination. Just as cases of\ncausal overdetermination and preemption involve causation without\ncausal dependence, so too do cases of \u2018grounding\noverdetermination\u2019 and \u2018grounding preemption\u2019\ninvolve grounding without ontological dependence. For example, the\nfact that I exist grounds the fact that something exists, but the\nobtaining of the latter fact does not depend upon the obtaining of the\nformer; the fact that something exists is massively overgrounded.\n\nBecause grounding and ontological dependence are distinct, the claim\nthat supervenience is not the same as grounding is distinct from the\nclaim that supervenience is not the same as ontological dependence.\nNonetheless, many of the same considerations are relevant.\n\nOne such consideration is that these relations may not have the same\nrelata. Supervenience is typically said to be a relation between\nproperties or families of properties, but at least some of\ngrounding\u2019s advocates say that it is a relation between facts\nonly (e.g. Rosen 2010, Audi 2012), and ontological dependence seems to\nobtain between members of a variety of ontological categories.\nHowever, it is not clear how seriously to take this kind of concern,\nsince notions of fact supervenience and property grounding can easily\nbe defined. \n\nA second way to see that supervenience is not identical to either\ngrounding or ontological dependence is to note that the latter two\nrelations are widely (though not universally) thought to be\nirreflexive and asymmetrical. Nothing can ground or ontologically\ndepend upon itself, and nothing can ground or ontologically depend on\nsomething that also grounds or depends on it. But as we have seen,\nsupervenience is reflexive and not asymmetrical (see\n Section 3.2).\n (For challenges to the claim that dependence and/or grounding are\nirreflexive and asymmetric, see Jenkins 2011, Bliss 2014, Wilson 2014,\nand Barnes 2018; for a reply to these challenges, see Bennett 2017,\nsect. 3.2). \n\nA third way to see that supervenience is not the same as either\ngrounding or ontological dependence is that the following conditionals\nare false:\n\nif A supervenes on B, B grounds\nA\nif A supervenes on B, A ontologically\ndepends on B\n\n\nAs McLaughlin put it in 1995, a mere supervenience claim does not\nentail any \u201cin virtue of\u201d claim. Here are a couple of ways\nto see this. As noted above, for any property F, being\nF supervenes on being ~F: two things cannot differ\nwith respect to being F without differing with respect to\nbeing ~F. But, of course, being ~F does not ground\nbeing F, and being F does not ontologically depend\non being ~F!\n\nAnother way to see that the conditionals are false is to notice that\nproperties everything has necessarily and ones that nothing can\npossibly have supervene, with the same sort of necessity, on\nany property whatsoever. (The fact that the necessary and the\nimpossible supervene on anything and everything poses not one but\ntwo problem for attempts to use supervenience to define\nphysicalism. See\n Section 5.4.)\n The property being self-identical supervenes on the property\nbeing an antique; the property being both a kangaroo and\nnot a kangaroo supervenes upon the property being dusty.\nThe reason is simple enough. No two things can differ with respect to\neither necessary or impossible properties, period; thus no two things\ncan differ with respect to such properties without also differing with\nrespect to B-properties, for any property set B.\nNothing can be both a kangaroo and not a kangaroo, so no two things\ncan differ with respect to that property, and thus no two things can\ndiffer with respect to that property without also differing with\nrespect to being dusty, or being purple, or being a steam engine, etc.\nBut it is not the case that being both a kangaroo and not a kangaroo\nis ontologically dependent upon being dusty, or that being dusty\ngrounds being both a kangaroo and not a kangaroo. Being dusty has\nnothing to do with it at all.\n\nFor yet another reason for denying that the supervenience of\nA-properties on B-properties entails anything about\ngrounding or ontological dependence, see the discussion of certain\nforms of global supervenience in Section 4.3.5. Author\u2019s\nnote: the main ideas in this section have been in place since the\noriginal 2005 edition, though the section was substantively revised in\n2018 to be more careful about the differences between grounding,\nontological dependence, and ontological priority. (The 2023 revision\nmerely involved trivial edits.)\n\n3.6 Supervenience, Realization, and Emergence\n\nLike \u2018supervenience\u2019, both \u2018realization\u2019 and\n\u2018emergence\u2019 are philosophical terms of art. Their\ndefinitions are stipulative and thus can only be judged by their\ntheoretical usefulness, not by accord with common usage.\n\nRealization is primarily taken to be a relationship between\nproperties, though derivative notions of property instance realization\nand state of affairs realization have been defined. We will focus on\nproperty realization. There is more than one use of the term\n\u2018property realization\u2019 in literature. Perhaps the leading\nuse is the one found in the literature on the functionalist theory of\nmind. (See, e.g., Block 1980; Melnyk 2003, 2006). On the functional\nview of realization, one property G realizes another\nF just in case G occupies (or fills or plays) the\ncausal role associated with F, \u2018the\nF-role\u2019\u2014that is, just in case instances of\nG have the kinds of causes and kinds of effects that comprise\nthe F-role. Thus, for instance, a neural property will\nrealize pain just in case it has the kinds of causes and effects that\ncomprise the pain-role. (According to analytical functionalism, the\npain-role is the causal role that folk psychology associates with\npain; according to psychofunctionalism, it is the causal role that\nscientific psychology associates with pain.) If more than one property\nplays the F-role, then F is multiply realizable.\n(See the entry on\n  multiple realizability.)\n \n\nSydney Shoemaker (2007, chapter 2) defines a related notion of\nproperty realization, which he calls the \u2018subset view of\nrealization\u2019. He says that \u201cas a first approximation,\nproperty P has property Q as a realizer just in case\n(1) the forward-looking causal features of property P are a\nsubset of the forward-looking causal features of property Q,\nand (2) the backward-looking causal features of P have as a\nsubset the backward-looking features of Q\u201d (2007, 12).\nOnce again, if P has more than one realizer, then P\nis multiply realizable. (McLaughlin (2007) argues that this subset\nnotion of realization, will not serve Shoemaker\u2019s purposes.)\n\n\nThere are other, less well-entrenched notions of realization in the\nliterature (e.g., Gillett 2003; Shoemaker 2007, chapter 3), but it\nwould take us too far afield to spell these out in detail.\n\nWhat is the relation between supervenience and realization, in either\nof the above senses? It looks like realization is sufficient for\nsupervenience, at least for non-local versions of supervenience. But\nsupervenience is not sufficient for realization, for reasons that are\nfamiliar from section 3.5: necessary properties supervene on anything,\nand properties supervene on their own negations. Further, because\nrealization is a distinctively causal notion, there are additional\nconsiderations here. The interesting case has to do with epiphenomenal\nproperties\u2014those that have no causal powers and play no causal\nrole. Perhaps mathematical properties are epiphenomenal in this way.\nLet F be such a property, and let it supervene upon\nG. F is not functionally-realized by G,\nsince G does not play F\u2019s distinctive causal role\n(F does not have one). So this is another reason to deny that\nsupervenience is sufficient for functional realization. But F\nis Shoemaker-realized by G. That\u2019s because\nF\u2019s causal powers are the null set, and the null set is a\nsubset of every set. Epiphenomenal properties are thus\nShoemaker-realized by anything at all, including G.\n(Shoemaker\u2019s view of realization, like his view about the causal\nindividuation of properties (1980), is simply not well-suited to the\nepiphenomenal case.) \n\nWhat about emergence? The term is used in a variety of ways, in the\nsciences as well as philosophy. These uses are so wildly divergent\nthat it is not clear that there is a common core notion. (See the\nessays in Bedau and Humphreys 2008, in Gibbs, Hendry, and Lancaster\n2019, Wilson 2021, and the entry on\n emergent properties.)\n But one canonical source of emergence talk is the British Emergentist\ntradition, particularly the work of C.D. Broad. Broad thought of\nemergent properties as fundamental properties possessed by complex\nobjects (Broad 1925; McLaughlin 1992, 1997, 2019). A number of\nphilosophers have suggested that Broad\u2019s notion can be characterized\nby means of supervenience with mere nomological necessity (e.g. van\nCleve 1990, Chalmers 2006). One question that arises, then, is whether\nthe appeal to nomological as opposed to metaphysical necessity can\ndistinguish emergence from tighter relations like realization; Jessica\nWilson (2005; 2021, 143\u2013149) and others have argued that it\ncannot.\n3.7 Supervenience and Explanation\n\nSupervenience claims, by themselves, do nothing more than state that\ncertain patterns of property (or fact) variation hold. They are silent\nabout why those patterns hold, and about the precise nature of the\ndependency involved (see Kim 1993, 167; 1998, 9\u201315; Blackburn\n1984, 186; Schiffer 1987, 153\u2013154; and McGinn 1993, 57). But few\nsupervenience theses are plausibly brute, that is, unexplainable. It\nis natural to look further, and to try to explain why\nA-properties supervene on B-properties. When such\nsupervenience is explainable, there is\n\u2018superdupervenience\u2019 (a term coined by William Lycan; see\nalso Schiffer 1987; Horgan 1993; and Wilson 1999).\n\nSometimes it is easy to see what explains a supervenience thesis.\nConsider the examples of trivial supervenience relations from\n Section 3.5.\n It is obvious why there cannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference if A is a set of necessary or\nimpossible properties\u2014namely, because there cannot be an\nA-difference at all. The supervenience relation is explained\nby the necessity or impossibility of the supervening properties. It is\nalso obvious why A-properties supervene on\nA-properties. Of course, property identity claims are\nsometimes not a priori knowable; consider, for example, the\nfact that the property being water is identical with the\nproperty being H20. Still the fact\nthat being water is identical with being\nH20 explains why there cannot be a\ndifference with respect to being water without a difference with\nrespect to being H20. And supervenience with\nonly nomological necessity can be explained by appeal to laws of\nnature. It is in virtue of the Wiedemann-Franz Law that electrical\nconductivity supervenes with nomological necessity on thermal\nconductivity.\n\nBecause we expect supervenience theses to be explainable, it is hard\nfor us to rest content with a supervenience thesis if we do not see\nwhat would explain why it is true. If it is claimed, for instance,\nthat moral properties supervene on non-moral properties, we expect\nthere to be an explanation of why this is so. Appeals to unexplainable\nsupervenience theses can thus seem to be mystery mongering.\n3.8 Tallying Up\n\nSupervenience gives us less than some philosophers have thought. Even\nlogically or metaphysically necessary supervenience is compatible with\nthere being no B-properties that entail any\nA-properties. Supervenience is not itself explanatory, and\ndoes not guarantee that the A-properties either reduce to,\nontologically depend upon, or are grounded by the\nB-properties. It might provide a way to capture the thought\nthat A-properties or facts are not a further ontological\ncommitment over and above the B-properties or facts, but this\nis controversial. At heart, all a supervenience claim says is that\nA-properties covary with B-properties.\nNevertheless, as we shall see in\n Section 5,\n supervenience has a variety of philosophical uses.\n4. Varieties of Supervenience\n\nThe slogan \u201cThere cannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference\u201d is applied both to particular\nindividuals and to entire possible worlds. In the former\ncase, the slogan expresses the idea that two individuals cannot differ\nin A-respects without also differing in B-respects.\nThis sort of claim is an individual supervenience claim. In the latter\ncase, the slogan expresses the idea that two possible worlds cannot\ndiffer with respect to their world-wide pattern of distribution of\nA-properties without also differing with respect to their\nworld-wide pattern of distribution of B-properties. That sort\nof claim is a global supervenience claim. Both individual and global\nsupervenience claims come in a variety of modal strengths. In this\nsection, we will distinguish various forms of both individual and\nglobal supervenience, and examine some logical relationships among\nthem.\n4.1 Weak and Strong Individual Supervenience\n\nKim (1984, 1987) distinguished two different kinds of individual\nsupervenience, weak and strong. They are defined by means of\nquantification over possible worlds, as follows:\n\nA-properties weakly supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any possible world w\nand any individuals x and y in w, if\nx and y are B-indiscernible in w,\nthen they are A-indiscernible in w.\n\n\nA-properties strongly supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any possible worlds\nw1 and\nw2 and any individuals x\nin w1 and y in\nw2, if x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\ny in w2, then x\nin w1 is A-indiscernible\nfrom y in w2. (Kim\n1987.)\n\n\nx and y are A-indiscernible if and only if\nthey are exactly alike with respect to every A-property;\nsimilarly for B-indiscernibility. (Here times are omitted,\nbut of course objects may be A-indiscernible at one time, but\nnot at another.) The possible worlds quantified over might include all\nmetaphysically possible worlds, or only nomologically possible worlds\n(etc.), depending upon what degree of modal force is intended.\n\nAs the names indicate, strong individual supervenience is stronger\nthan weak individual supervenience. (We shall hereafter follow\nestablished usage and drop the word \u2018individual\u2019 unless\nclarity requires it.) Weak supervenience says that there is no\npossible world that contains individuals that are\nB-indiscernible but A-discernible. Strong\nsupervenience entails that there are no possible individuals that are\nB-indiscernible but A-discernible, whether they\nare in the same world or different worlds. When the range of\nworlds is the same, strong supervenience theses entail weak\nsupervenience theses, but the latter do not in general entail the\nformer. It is important to note, however, that when A is\nrestricted to intrinsic properties, strong and weak supervenience are\narguably equivalent; see Section 4.3.4. \n\nOccasionally philosophers appeal to weak supervenience rather than\nstrong supervenience. Hare, for example, said that his claim that\nvalue properties supervene on other properties was intended to be an\nappeal only to weak supervenience (1984, 4). And Davidson similarly\nclaimed that his appeal to supervenience was intended to be an appeal\nonly to weak supervenience (1985, 1993, esp. 4n4). (He said this in\nresponse to Kim (1984), who argued that Davidson cannot appeal to\nstrong supervenience on pain of commitment to strict psychophysical\nlaws, which are incompatible with Davidson\u2019s well-known thesis\nof the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict\npsychophysical laws. See the entry on anomalous monism.)\n\nBut appealing to weak supervenience while denying strong generates a\ncertain explanatory burden. You will recall that we always want an\nexplanation of why a supervenience relation holds (see\n Section 3.7).\n Thus someone who asserts a weak supervenience thesis but denies the\ncorresponding strong supervenience thesis must provide an explanation\nof why the weak supervenience thesis is true that does not entail that\nthe relevant strong supervenience thesis is true as well. And that can\nlook mysterious: if there can be things in different worlds\nthat are A-discernible but not B-discernible, why\ncan\u2019t there be two such things within a single world? If\neverything within each world that is B-indiscernible is\nA-indiscernible, how can different worlds enforce\ndifferent B\u2192A property pairings? (See\nBlackburn on the need to explain the \u201cban on mixed\nworlds,\u201d 1973, 1985, and especially 1984, 184.)\n\nSometimes there is an explanation of why weak supervenience holds\ndespite the fact that strong supervenience does not. If, within a\nworld, two individuals assert exactly the same propositions, then they\nare exactly alike vis-\u00e0-vis having asserted a true proposition:\nthe one asserted at least one true proposition if and only if the\nother did. The reason is that a proposition will have a unique\ntruth-value relative to a world. The following weak supervenience\nthesis thus holds: for any world w, and any individuals\nx and y in w, if x and y\nare indiscernible with respect to what propositions they have\nasserted, then they are indiscernible with respect to having asserted\na true proposition. Contingent propositions, however, are true in some\nworlds and false in others. It is thus possible for two individuals in\ndifferent worlds to assert exactly the same propositions, and yet\ndiffer with respect to having asserted a true proposition. The one\nmight assert many true propositions, while the other fails to assert\nany true proposition. It follows that the following strong\nsupervenience thesis is false: for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, any individuals x in\nw1 and y in\nw2, if x in\nw1 is indiscernible from y\nin w2, with respect to what\npropositions they have asserted, then x in\nw1 is indiscernible from y\nin w2 with respect to having\nasserted a true proposition.\n\nIn contrast, it is by no means clear why mental properties would\nweakly supervene on physical properties without strongly supervening\non them; and the analogous question arises for moral properties and\nnonmoral properties. Davidson and Hare owe us an explanation of why\nmental and moral properties weakly supervene, respectively, on\nphysical and nonmoral ones\u2014and it must be an explanation that\ndoes not entail that strong supervenience holds as well. Simon\nBlackburn\u2019s well-known argument against moral realism basically\nconstitutes an attempt to answer this question for Hare. Though\nBlackburn speaks of \u2018supervenience\u2019 and\n\u2018necessitation\u2019 rather than weak and strong supervenience,\nhis argument against moral realism rests on exactly the\ndemand for explanation that we have been exploring. He claims, 1) that\nmoral properties weakly supervene on nonmoral properties, but do not\nstrongly supervene on them, 2) that this requires explanation, and 3)\nthat projectivists can do this better than moral realists (1973,\n1985.) We are content to note that some such answer is required from\nanyone who holds a weak supervenience thesis without the corresponding\nstrong supervenience thesis.\n\nOne final matter concerning the notions of weak and strong\nsupervenience remains to be discussed. This is that they are sometimes\nformulated differently, by means of modal operators rather than\nquantification over possible worlds:\n\n\nA weakly supervenesm on\nB if and only if necessarily, if anything x has some\nproperty F in A, then there is at least one property\nG in B such that x has G, and\neverything that has G has F, i.e., iff \n\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200F\u2208A[Fx\n\u2192 \u2203G\u2208B(Gx &\n\u2200y(Gy \u2192 Fy))]\n\n\nA strongly supervenesm on\nB if and only if necessarily, if anything x has some\nproperty F in A, then there is at least one property\nG in B such x has G, and\nnecessarily everything that has G has F, i.e., iff\n\n\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200F\u2208A[Fx\n\u2192 \u2203G\u2208B(Gx &\n\u25a1\u2200y(Gy \u2192 Fy))]\n\n\n(Kim 1984)\n\n\nNotice that strong superveniencem is\nformulated just like weak superveniencem,\nexcept that it contains one more necessity operator.\n\nKim initially maintained that the modal operator versions are\nequivalent to the above possible world definitions of weak and strong\nsupervenience respectively (see esp. 1987, 79\u201382). But they are\nnot; they are stronger. On certain assumptions (e.g. that modal\noperators are to be understood as quantifiers over worlds), the modal\noperator versions of strong and weak supervenience respectively entail\nthe possible world versions; but not vice versa (McLaughlin\n1995).\n\nThe reasoning here is basically the same as that given in\n Section 3.2\n above for why supervenience does not guarantee entailment. Both\nweakm and strongm supervenience\nsay i) that it is necessary that everything that has an\nA-property has some B-property or other, and ii)\nthat that B-property entails the A-property. But\nneither i) nor ii) follows from the possible world versions of either\nweak or strong supervenience\u2014unless B is assumed to be\nclosed under the Boolean operations of complementation, infinitary\nconjunction, infinitary disjunction, and property-forming operations\ninvolving quantification (McLaughlin 1995). Without that assumption,\nthe possible worlds versions allow things with A-properties\nto lack B-properties altogether, and a fortiori to\nlack any B-property that entails their A-properties.\nOf course, possible worlds supervenience requires that each pair of\nB-less intraworld (weak) or interworld (strong) individuals\nmust have the same A-properties, but the possible\nworld versions allow B-less individuals to have\nA-properties. The modal operator versions do not.\n\nIt should therefore come as no surprise that the cases that served as\ncounterexamples to the claim that supervenience is a form of\nentailment also serve as counterexamples to the equivalence of the\npossible worlds and modal operator formulations of supervenience.\nBeing F strongly supervenes on being not-F, but\nfails to even weakly supervenem on it.\n{P & Q} strongly supervenes on {P,\nQ}, but fails to even weakly\nsupervenem on it. The possible world\nversions of weak and strong supervenience are weaker than the\ncorresponding modal operator versions. The latter go beyond the basic\nidea that there cannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference. Again, though, the modal operator versions\nare equivalent to the possible worlds versions if the base\nset B is closed under Boolean operations, and operations\ninvolving quantification.\n4.2 Regional Supervenience\n\nTerence Horgan (1982) has proposed a version of supervenience in terms\nof individual regions of space-times, rather than in terms of objects.\nA weak and a strong version of Horgan\u2019s \u201cregional\nsupervenience\u201d can be formulated as follows:\n\nA-properties weakly regionally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any possible world w\nand any space-time regions r1 and\nr2 in w, if\nr1 and\nr2 are B-duplicates in\nw, then they are A-duplicates in w.\n\n\nA-properties strongly regionally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any possible worlds\nw1 and\nw2 and any space-time regions\nr1 in\nw1 and space-time region\nr2 in\nw2, if\nr1 in\nw1 is a B-duplicate of\nr2 in\nw2, then\nr1 in\nw1 is an A-duplicate of\nr2 in\nw2.\n\n\nRegional supervenience is a form of individual supervenience that\ntakes the individuals to be regions of space-time. Nonetheless, it is\nworth separate mention because Horgan (1982) has argued that it has\nsome of the attractive features of global supervenience.\n4.3 Global Supervenience\n\nOften, claims of the form \u2018there cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference\u2019 are not\nmade about individuals, nor about nonmaximal space-time regions, but\nrather about entire possible worlds. This is global supervenience,\ntypically formulated as follows:\n\nA-properties globally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if\nw1 and\nw2 have exactly the same world-wide\npattern of distribution of B-properties, then they have\nexactly the same world-wide pattern of distribution of\nA-properties.\n\n\nThe notion of a global supervenience thesis has been employed for a\nnumber of philosophical purposes. Notably, it has been used to\ncharacterize physicalism (see\n Section 5.4),\n and to capture David Lewis\u2019 Humean supervenience thesis:\n\u201call there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of\nparticular fact\u00c9 all else supervenes on that\u201d (1986a,\nix-x).\n\nGlobal supervenience is often claimed to serve purposes that neither\nstrong nor weak individual supervenience will serve. First, it is\nsometimes claimed that global supervenience naturally handles\nrelational properties like being an original Van Gogh or\nbeing a dollar bill. As we shall see, however, strong or weak\nsupervenience can handle relational properties too. Second, global\nsupervenience naturally handles the supervenience of factors other\nthan properties or relations. On a Humean view of laws of nature, for\ninstance, laws of nature are general facts that supervene on\nparticular facts. But that can be captured by individual property\nsupervenience, even if only in a baroque way. A third potential\ndifference between global and individual supervenience is that the\nformer, but not the latter, is compatible with the supervening and\nsubvening properties being possessed by different individuals (see\nHaugeland 1982). Thus, for example, global supervenience is useful if\nthere can be distinct but spatio-temporally coincident\nobjects\u2014it leaves room to say that the properties of a clay\nstatue supervene upon the properties of the distinct lump of clay that\nconstitutes it (see\n Section 5.5).\n\nWhat the difference between individual and global supervenience really\ncomes to will be discussed throughout the rest of this section.\n4.3.1 Strong Individual Supervenience and Global Supervenience\n\nIt is clear that strong individual supervenience entails global\nsupervenience (see Kim 1984). The question that has attracted\nattention is the converse\u2014whether global supervenience entails\nstrong individual supervenience. In this section, we describe the\ninitial stages of this debate, which took place when the going notion\nof global supervenience was that outlined just above. In Section\n4.3.2, we explain how that notion has been replaced by a family of\nmore precise notions, and explore how it affects the question of\nwhether global supervenience entails strong individual supervenience.\n(Most of the reminder of this section paraphrases McLaughlin 1995,\n55\u201356.)\n\nThe debate began when Kim purported to show that \u201cglobal\nsupervenience is nothing but strong supervenience\u201d (1984, 168).\nIn response, Brad Petrie (1987) argued that global supervenience does\nnot entail strong supervenience. His strategy was to try to provide a\ncounterexample to a strong supervenience thesis that is not a\ncounterexample to the corresponding global supervenience thesis. Here\nis his case. Let set A = {S} and that B =\n{P}. Consider two worlds\nw1 and\nw2 that are as follows: world\nw1 contains exactly two objects,\nx and y. And world\nw2 contains exactly two objects,\nx* and y*. The following purports to be a complete\ndepiction of the contents of those worlds:\n\n\nW1\n\nW2 \n\n\n\n \n\nPx\n\nPx* \n\nSx\n\n~Sx* \n\nPy\n\n~Py* \n\n~Sy\n\n~Sy* \n\n\nThe existence of w1 and\nw2 is incompatible with the thesis\nthat A strongly individually supervenes on B because\nx in w1 is B-indiscernible\nbut A-discernible from x* in\nw2. But the existence of these\nworlds is not itself a counterexample to the global\nsupervenience of A on B. Since\nw1 and w2\ndo not have the same global pattern of distribution of\nB-properties, it seems not to matter that the worlds do not\nhave the same global pattern of distribution of A-properties.\nThus Petrie claimed that \u201csince global supervenience is, and\nstrong supervenience is not, consistent with this example, the two\nconcepts of supervenience are not equivalent\u201d (1987, 121).\n\nIn response, Kim conceded that global supervenience fails to entail\nstrong supervenience (1987, 318), and went on to claim that\nPetrie\u2019s example also shows that global supervenience fails to\nentail weak. Notice that w1 alone\nviolates the weak supervenience of A on B, but also\nfails to be a counterexample to the global supervenience of A\non B. Kim thus concluded that global supervenience fails to\nentail weak or strong individual supervenience.\n\nPaull and Sider pointed out that these argument strategies are no good\n(1992). The problem is that one cannot simply point to two worlds that\ndo not themselves falsify a global supervenience thesis, and then\nclaim that the case is compatible with that thesis. Those two worlds\nmight entail the existence of other worlds that are not\ncompatible with the global supervenience thesis. A global\nsupervenience thesis is a claim about all worlds, not just\ntwo. The upshot is that although a global supervenience thesis fails\nto entail either a weak or strong supervenience thesis in virtue of\nlogical form, it might nevertheless be the case that plausible\nmetaphysical principles entail that whenever the former holds, so does\nthe latter.\n\nPaull and Sider appeal to a plausible principle to show that the\nexistence of Petrie\u2019s w1 and\nw2 entail the existence of a pair\nof worlds that constitutes a counterexample to the global\nsupervenience of A-properties on B-properties (1992,\n838). The basic idea is that for any object in any possible world,\nthere is another world containing an \u201cisolated duplicate\u201d\nof it. Intuitively, the duplicate exists all alone in its world; more\nprecisely, an object y is isolated in a world \u201cif and only if\nthat world contains only (i) y, (ii) y\u2019s\nparts, and (iii) objects whose existence is entail by any of the\nobjects mentioned in (i) and (ii)\u201d (1992, 838\u20139).\nCrucially, isolated duplicates share the intrinsic properties of the\nthings with which they are duplicates. (Two caveats. First, this is\nnot intended to be a definition of \u2018intrinsic\u2019.\nFor some attempts to do so, see e.g., Lewis 1983a, Langton and Lewis\n1998, and a variety of articles in Philosophy and Phenomenological\nResearch 63). Second, notice that the principle does not say that\neach thing can itself exist in isolation; it simply says that each\nthing has a duplicate that does. It consequently does not entail that\nnothing has any essential extrinsic properties.)\n\nPaull and Sider\u2019s isolation principle does the job. Consider\nagain the worlds w1 and\nw2 that Petrie described. Petrie\npurported to describe the worlds in full. Thus, P and\nS are presumably supposed to be intrinsic properties. It\nfollows from the isolation principle that there is a world\nw3 that contains an isolated\nduplicate of x\u2014call it\n\u201cz\u201d\u2014and a world\nw4 that contains an isolated\nduplicate of x*\u2014call it \u201cz*.\u201d As\nPaull and Sider note, these worlds will be as follows:\n\n\nW3\n\nW4 \n\n\n\n \n\nPz\n\nPz* \n\nSz\n\n~Sz* \n\n\nUnlike w1 and\nw2,\nw3 and\nw4 constitute a counterexample to\nthe global supervenience of A-properties on\nB-properties. They have the same pattern of distribution of\nB-properties, but different patterns of distribution of\nA-properties. So, Paull and Sider claim that Petrie failed to\nshow that global supervenience does not entail strong\nsupervenience.\n\nBut Paull and Sider went on to provide a new argument for that claim.\nThey appealed to a set B containing just two properties,\nP and Q, and a set A containing only one\nproperty, M. An object has M just in case it has\nP, and some other object is Q. That is to say,\nMx =df Px &\n\u2203yQy. This definition guarantees that A\nglobally supervenes on B. They then described the following\ntwo worlds:\n\n\nW\n\nW* \n\n\n\n \n\nMa\n\n~Mc \n\nPa\n\nPc \n\n~Mb\n\n \n\nQb\n\n \n\n\nThis pair of worlds shows that A does not strongly supervene\non B. And the principle of isolation cannot be applied to\ngenerate a counterexample to global supervenience. An isolated\nduplicate of a would be both A- and B-indiscernible\nfrom c (an isolated duplicate of a would not have M).\nConsequently, Paull and Sider concluded that global and strong\nsupervenience are not equivalent. (1992, 841).\n\nKlagge (1995) objected to this line of argument. He pointed out that\nPaull and Sider include an extrinsic property M in the\nsupervenient set A, but only intrinsic properties P\nand Q in the subvenient or base set B. And, he\nclaimed, if we allow that there are the sorts of property-forming\noperations required to construct extrinsic property M, then\nPaull and Sider have not exhaustively characterized worlds w\nand w*. For, given those property-forming operations, it is\nplausible that there will, for instance, be a property P#\nthat can be defined as follows: P#\n=df Px &\n\u2203y(y\u2260x). (Basically, a thing is\nP# just in case something else is P.) a in\nw and c in w* differ on this property;\na has P# while c does not. That is right.\nBut Klagge took that to show that w and w* do not\nprovide a counterexample to the strong supervenience of A on\nB after all. That, however, does not follow. It would follow\nonly if a and c thereby counted as\nB-discernible, and they do not. Paull and Sider stipulate\nthat B contains only P and Q. Thus,\na and c are B-indiscernible, despite the\nfact that a has P# and c does not.\n\nBut Klagge was clearly right that Paull and Sider\u2019s example\ninvolves a supervenient set A that contains an extrinsic\nproperty and a subvenient set B that contains only intrinsic\nproperties, and he was right that this is important. It invites the\nquestion whether global supervenience might entail strong\nsupervenience when A and B are sets of intrinsic\nproperties. And it invites the question whether global supervenience\nmight entail strong supervenience when A and B both\ninclude extrinsic properties of certain sorts. Indeed, in response to\nPaull and Sider, Kim suggests that \u201cequivalence seems to fail,\nthrough the failure of implication from global to strong\nsupervenience, only when extrinsic properties are present in the\nsupervenient set but disallowed from the subvenient base\u201d (1993,\n170; see also McLaughlin 1997a, 215). We will return to these\nquestions in the next several sections. Answering them requires\ngetting clearer about global supervenience; to this we now turn.\n4.3.2 Different Versions of Global Supervenience\n\nUntil now, we have been relying mainly on a notion of global\nsupervenience that is defined in terms of what amounts to a notion of\nA/B-indiscernibility of worlds:\n\nA-properties globally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if\nw1 and\nw2 have exactly the same world-wide\npattern of distribution of B-properties, then they have\nexactly the same world-wide pattern of distribution of\nA-properties.\n\n\nBut what is meant by a \u2018world-wide pattern of\ndistribution\u2019 of A- or B-properties? The\nnotion is usually cashed out by appeal to the notion of there being a\ncertain kind of isomorphism or mapping between worlds. For any\nproperty set f, define the notion of an f-preserving\nisomorphism as follows:\n\nAn isomorphism I between the inhabitants of worlds\nw1 and\nw2 preserves f-properties\nif and only if for any x in\nw1, x has a\nf-property P in\nw1 just in case the image of\nx under I (the individual to which I maps x) has\nP in w2.\n\n\nThis purposely avoids appeal to any special relationship that the\nmapped individuals may bear to each other (such, e.g., occupying\ncorresponding locations in their respective worlds). This is to remain\nas neutral as possible on such issues, and because any features used\nto pick out the mapped things would automatically then globally\nsupervene on any properties whatever (see McLaughlin 1995, 1997a). See\nSteinberg 2014 for an alternative way of characterizing world-wide\npatterns of property distribution.\n\nGiven this notion, various different forms of global supervenience\nemerge. Stalnaker 1996, McLaughlin 1996, 1997a, and Sider 1999 all\ndistinguish between a weak and a strong notion of global\nsupervenience, as follows:\n\nA-properties weakly globally supervene on\nB-properties iff for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism between\nw1 and\nw2, then there is an\nA-preserving isomorphism between them.\n\n\nA-properties strongly globally supervene on\nB-properties iff for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, every B-preserving\nisomorphism between w1 and\nw2 is an A-preserving\nisomorphism between them.\n\n\nShagrir (2002) and Bennett (2004a) have both formulated an\nintermediate version:\n\nA-properties intermediately globally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism between\nw1 and\nw2, then at least one isomorphism\nbetween them is both A-and-B-preserving.\n\n\nIndeed, any number of versions of global supervenience can be\nformulated, simply by specifying exactly how many\nA-and-B-preserving isomorphisms there must be\nbetween worlds between which there is a B-preserving\nisomorphism. Such versions all count as forms of intermediate global\nsupervenience, however, and will be ignored in what follows. Notice\ntoo that it is not always clear which version is intended when someone\nappeals to the notion of global supervenience. Shagrir (2002) and\nBennett (2004a) suggest that there is some reason to think that people\noften intend intermediate; Leuenberger (2009) argues that none of the\nprecisified versions really captures the original concept. Shagrir\nlater argued that strong does the most \u201cjustice to the notion of\nglobal supervenience\u201d (2013).\n\nIt is easy to see that strong global supervenience entails\nintermediate global supervenience, which in turn entails weak global\nsupervenience. If every B-preserving isomorphism\nbetween two worlds must itself be A-preserving, then if there\nare any B-preserving isomorphisms between two worlds at all,\nat least one of them must be A-preserving. So,\nstrong global supervenience entails intermediate. And if at least one\nof any existing B-preserving isomorphisms between two worlds\nmust itself be A-preserving, then it obviously follows that\nif there is a B-preserving isomorphism between two worlds,\nthere must also be an A-preserving one. Thus, intermediate\nglobal supervenience entails weak global supervenience.\n\nIt is also easy to see that strong individual supervenience entails\nstrong global supervenience. Suppose that A-properties fail\nto strongly globally supervene on B-properties. That means\nthat there are two worlds w1 and\nw2 between which there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism that fails to be\nA-preserving. So, for some x in\nw1, the image of x under I\nin w2\u2014call it y\u2014has all\nand only the same B-properties as x in\nw1, but differs from x in\nw1 in at least one of its\nA-properties. But that is just to say that x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible yet\nA-discernible from y in\nw2. It follows that\nB-properties fail to strongly supervene on\nA-properties. Thus, strong individual supervenience entails\nstrong global supervenience, and thereby also entails intermediate and\nweak global supervenience as well.\n\nBut strong global supervenience fails to entail strong individual\nsupervenience, at least when A and B are any\nnonempty sets of properties. Showing this only requires tiny\nmodifications to Paull and Sider\u2019s argument that the notion of\nglobal supervenience spelled out just in terms of world-wide patterns\nof distribution of properties fails to entail strong individual\nsupervenience (Section 4.3.1), and so we will not state the argument\nhere. (See Shagrir 2002, 188.) Once again, the key to the argument is\na case in which the supervening set contains extrinsic properties, and\nthe subvening set does not.\n\nLet us now see what is the case when the supervening and subvening\nproperty sets are brought into line with each other. Recall the\nearlier hypothesis that global and strong individual are equivalent\nwhen Paull-Sider style cases are blocked (see Section 4.3.1). So,\nthen, does strong global entail strong individual when the supervening\nset contains only intrinsic properties? When the subvening set\ncontains both intrinsic properties and all of the extrinsic properties\nthat can be generated from them?\n\nThe answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d And it turns out\nthat related argumentative strategies can also be reapplied back to\nthe case of weak and strong individual supervenience. We outline these\nstrategies in the next two sections. However, some of the proofs\nthemselves are complicated, and we thus refer to the reader to the\noriginal literature.\n4.3.3 Equivalences for an Extrinsic Base\n\nStrong global supervenience entails strong individual supervenience as\nlong as the base set B is taken to be closed under\ncomplementation, infinitary conjunction, infinitary disjunction, and\nproperty-forming operations involving quantification and identity. Kim\nanticipates this equivalence (1993, 170), and Robert Stalnaker\nprovides the proof (1996, 238). It should also be noted that John\nBacon argues that if sets of properties A and B are\nclosed under the operations mentioned above and also an operation he\ncalls \u201cresplicing,\u201d then weak and strong individual\nsupervenience both hold or fail to hold together (1986). For\nB to be closed under resplicing is for it to be the case that\nfor any property P such that its extension Pw in a\nworld w is the extension of some property in B,\nP is a member of B.\n\nWe have already noted that it is controversial whether such\nproperty-forming operations are legitimate, and, even if they are, we\nare often interested in property sets that are not closed under them.\nSee\n Section 3.2.\n Still, so long as the property-forming operations are legitimate,\nthen even if B itself is not closed under them, there will\nalways be a larger set B+ which is. That is good\nenough to entail that for every strong global supervenience thesis\nthere is a logically equivalent strong individual supervenience\nthesis. Indeed, if all of these property-forming operations (including\nBacon\u2019s resplicing) are legitimate, then there are property sets\nwith respect to which weak individual supervenience, strong individual\nsupervenience, and strong global supervenience are all equivalent.\n\nBut since there has been considerable dispute over the legitimacy of\nthe various alleged property-forming operations, the issues remain\nunresolved.\n4.3.4 Equivalencies for Intrinsic Properties\n\nIf we bring the property sets into line by restricting both the\nsupervening and subvening sets to intrinsic properties\u2014however\nexactly the notion of an intrinsic property is to be captured\n(see e.g. Langton and Lewis 1998)\u2014we get even clearer results.\nMany varieties of supervenience turn out to be equivalent for\nintrinsic properties.\n\nBoth Shagrir (2002) and Bennett (2004a) argue that strong individual\nsupervenience is equivalent to strong global supervenience when\nA and B are sets of intrinsic properties. Bennett\nalso argues that in such a case even weak global\nsupervenience entails strong individual supervenience. The argument\nrelies upon Paull and Sider\u2019s isolation principle, explained in\nSection 4.3.1 above; the basic idea is to show that any\ncounterexamples to strong individual supervenience can be\n\u201cisolated\u201d to generate counterexamples to weak global\nsupervenience\u2014i.e., pairs of worlds between which there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism but no A-preserving\none.\n\nHere, again, we can also obtain related results about\nindividual supervenience. Mark Moyer (2008) argues that weak\nand strong individual supervenience are equivalent in the special case\nof intrinsic properties. He appeals to a recombination principle\nsimilar to Paull and Sider\u2019s principle of isolation, but with a\ntwist. The intuitive idea is that any two things in any two worlds can\nbe isolated from their surroundings and then put into a world with\neach other. More formally:\n\nRecombination Principle. For any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, any individual x in\nw1 and any individual y in\nw2, there is a world\nw3 that contains individuals\nx\u2032 and y\u2032 such that x\u2032 in\nw3 is an intrinsic-duplicate of\nx in w1 and y\u2032 in\nw3 is an intrinsic-duplicate of\ny in w2.\n\n\nIf this principle is right, then any cross-world pair of individuals\nthat witness the violation of a strong supervenience claim have\nintrinsic-duplicates within a single world. If the supervening\nproperties are intrinsic, those duplicates will violate weak\nsupervenience as well. \n\nIf all of these results are right, then weak individual supervenience,\nstrong individual supervenience, weak global supervenience,\nintermediate global supervenience, and strong global supervenience are\nall equivalent in the special case when A and\nB are sets of intrinsic properties.\n4.3.5 Individual and Global Supervenience Redux\n\nIn Section 4.3.3, we saw that weak and strong individual supervenience\nare equivalent to strong global supervenience in the special case in\nwhich the base set B is closed under certain property forming\noperations. And in 4.3.4, we saw that weak and strong individual\nsupervenience, and weak, intermediate, and strong global supervenience\nare all equivalent in the special case in which A and\nB are sets of intrinsic properties. The upshot is that strong\nglobal and strong individual supervenience come apart \u201conly when\nextrinsic properties are present in the supervenient set but\ndisallowed from the subvenient base,\u201d as Kim and others\npredicted (Section 4.3.1). See Shagrir 2009 for discussion of the case\nof relations.\n\nHowever, weak and intermediate global supervenience are not equivalent\nto strong individual supervenience even when extrinsic properties are\nlet into the base\u2014more precisely, when the base is closed under\nthe relevant property-forming operations. So, perhaps they have\ndistinctive philosophical work to do, work that cannot be done by\nstrong individual supervenience. For example, Sider (1999) appeals to\nweak global supervenience to handle cases of spatio-temporal\ncoincidence, though he retracts this in his (2008). See\n Section 5.5.\n\nBut it is controversial whether these forms of supervenience are\nstrong enough to be philosophically useful. As both Shagrir (2002) and\nBennett (2004a) have pointed out, only strong global supervenience\nguarantees that the world-wide distribution of B-properties\ndetermines the world-wide distribution of A-properties. Both\nweak and intermediate global allow what is called \u2018intraworld\nvariation\u2019\u2014both allow B-indiscernible individuals\nin a world to have different A-properties. (Contrast weak\nindividual supervenience, which allows crossworld variation, but does\nban \u201cmixed worlds.\u201d) Indeed, weak global supervenience\nallows the A-preserving and B-preserving\nisomorphisms to be utterly independent of each other. Suppose some\nproperty being griffic merely weakly globally supervenes on\nthe physical. Then although a world physically just like this one has\nto contain the same number of griffic things as this world, it does\nnot matter which things they are. In this world it might be the Eiffel\nTower and the Queen Mother; in the physical duplicate it might be a\ntea towel and the Grand Canyon.\n\nIn any case, those who assert a weak or intermediate global\nsupervenience thesis while denying the corresponding strong global\nsupervenience thesis need to provide an explanation of why weak or\nintermediate global supervenience holds that does not entail that\nstrong global supervenience holds. (Recall the discussion of weak and\nstrong individual supervenience in\n 4.1).\n That is, they need to explain what enforces the links between\nA- and B-preserving isomorphisms that are required\nby weak and intermediate global, without also enforcing the claim that\nevery B-preserving isomorphism itself be\nA-preserving.\n\nAt present, these issues remain open, and the status of weak and\nintermediate global supervenience is controversial.\n4.4 Similarity Based Supervenience\n\nThis essay has thus far focused on varieties of\nindiscernibility-based supervenience. But in some cases we\nmight be interested in a notion according to which things that are\nvery much alike in B-respects must also be very much alike in\nA-respects. This is similarity-based supervenience (Kim\n1987). (The remainder of this section closely paraphrases McLaughlin\n1995).\n\nWeak and strong versions of similarity-based supervenience can be\ndefined in the expected fashion:\n\nA weakly supervenessim on B if and only\nif for any world w, and for any x and y in\nw, if x and y are not largely different\nwith respect to B-properties, then they are not largely\ndifferent with respect to A-properties.\n\n\nA strongly supervenessim on B if and only\nif for any worlds w1 and w2,\nand for any x in w1 and y in\nw2, if x in w1 is not\nlargely different from y in w2 with\nrespect to B-properties, then x in\nw1 is not largely different from y in\nw2 with respect to A-properties.\n\n\nThese are versions of individual supervenience; global versions can\nalso be formulated. Strong implies weak, but not conversely, except\nfor the special case of intrinsic properties. (The latter can be shown\nby slight modification of Moyer\u2019s argument mentioned in Section\n4.3.4.)\n\nSimilarity-based supervenience is logically independent of\nindiscernibility-based supervenience: neither implies the other.\nSimilarity-based supervenience fails to imply indiscernibility-based\nsupervenience. It may be that there can be A-differences\nwithout B-differences, but that there cannot be\nlarge A-differences without large\nB-differences. And indiscernibility-based supervenience\nlikewise fails to imply similarity-based supervenience. The reason is\nthat there may be small B-differences that are critical\npoints for big A-differences. When that happens,\nsimilarity-based supervenience will fail, even though\nindiscernibility-based supervenience may hold. For example, it might\nwell be the case that small physical differences can be accompanied by\nlarge mental and moral differences. Similarly, a small physical\ndifference like a misplaced brush stroke might have a large effect on\nthe aesthetic value of a painting. Suffice it to note that it remains\nan open question whether there are any interesting philosophical uses\nof similarity-based supervenience.\n4.5 Multiple Domain Supervenience\n\nThus far this essay has focused primarily on single domain\nsupervenience (the exceptions are the discussions of weak and\nintermediate global supervenience). A form of supervenience\ncounts as single domain when and only when the A- and\nB-properties are possessed by the very same\nindividuals\u2014when the way something is in A-respects is\na function of the way it is in B-respects. Both weak\nand strong individual supervenience are clear cases of single domain\nsupervenience. But in some cases, what we want to say is that there\ncannot be an A-difference in certain things without a\nB-difference in certain other things\u2014distinct\nthings to which the former things are related in a certain way. When\nand if this is the case, there is multiple domain supervenience.\n\nOne place such a notion seems useful is in discussions of coincidence\nand material constitution. Those who think that a clay statue is\ndistinct from the lump of clay that make it up will claim that certain\nproperties of the statue must supervene on properties of the lump of\nclay that constitutes it. For example, there could not be two statues\nthat are discernible in shape without the statues being constituted by\nlumps of clay discernible in shape. For further discussion, see\n Section 5.5.\n\nKim (1988) has formulated a weak and strong version of multiple domain\nsupervenience. Let D1 and\nD2 be non-empty domains of\nindividuals, R be a relation between\nD1 and\nD2, and R|x be\nthe subset of D2 to which\nx is R-related. We can define the following\nnotions:\n\n(A, D1) weakly\nmultiple domain supervenes on (B,\nD2) relative to R just in\ncase necessarily for any x and y in\nD1, if R|x and\nR|y are B-indiscernible, then x\nand y are A-indiscernible.\n\n\n(A, D1) strongly\nmultiple domain supervenes on (B,\nD2) relative to relation R\njust in case for any x and y in\nD1 and any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if R|x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\nR|y in w2,\nx in w1 is\nA-indiscernible from y in\nw2. (Kim 1998)\n\n\nWhen R is identity, these are equivalent, respectively, to\nsingle domain weak and single domain strong individual supervenience.\nIt is because R might be a relation other than identity, for\nexample material constitution, that the definitions have the potential\nfor added utility. Here again, slight modification of Moyer\u2019s\nargument (Section 4.3.4) can be used to show that weak and strong\nmultiple domain supervenience are equivalent when the supervening set\nis intrinsic.\n\nCoincidence-friendly supervenience is another kind of multiple-domain\nsupervenience (proposed by Dean Zimmerman 1995, 88)). It can be\nformulated as follows (see Bennett 2004, 520):\n\nCoincidence-Friendly Supervenience : For all x and\ny, and all worlds w1 and\nw2, if x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\ny in w2, then for each\nthing x* in w1 to which\nx is R-related, there is something y* in\nw2 that is R-related to\ny and that is A-indiscernible from x*.\n\n\nThat is a strong version, but a weak version can be formulated as\nfollows:\n\nWeak Coincidence-Friendly Supervenience: For any world\nw and any x and y in w, if\nx in w is B-indiscernible from y\nin w, then for each thing x* to which x is\nR-related in w, there is something y* that\ny is R-related in w and x* is\nA-indiscernible from y*.\n\n\nHere again, when R is identity, these forms of supervenience\nare equivalent, respectively, to weak and strong individual\nsupervenience. And here again, the weak and strong versions are\nequivalent when A is a set of only intrinsic properties.\n\nWeak and strong coincident-friendly supervenience count as kinds of\nmultiple-domain supervenience, but they differ from Kim\u2019s weak\nand strong multiple domain supervenience in at least one important\nrespect. The final quantifier in the definitions of\ncoincident-friendly supervenience is existential, rather than\nuniversal as it is in Kim\u2019s weak and strong multiple domain\nsupervenience. As a result, Kim\u2019s multiple domain supervenience\nsays that if a and b are B-indiscernible,\neach thing R-related to a must be A-indiscernible\nfrom everything R-related to b.\nCoincidence-friendly supervenience says only that each thing\nR-related to a must be A-indiscernible from\nsomething R-related to b. This matters if\nR is B-indiscernibility, as it plausibly is in the\ncase of spatio-temporal coincidence\u2014the main philosophical\napplication of multiple-domain supervenience.\n\nFinally, Ralf Bader (2013) has developed versions of multiple-domain\nsupervenience to model relations between complex entities and their\nparts, including those permitted by non-classical metrologies.\n5. Applications\n5.1 An Argumentative Strategy\n\nRecall that everyone agrees that the reduction of A to\nB implies the supervenience of A on B\n (Section 3.3).\n This gives rise to one central use of supervenience. Arguing against\na supervenience thesis that must be true if some program of reduction\nor conceptual analysis is to succeed is a common way of arguing that\nthe program cannot succeed. McLaughlin (1984, 1995) calls this style\nof argumentation \u2018argument by appeal to a false implied\nsupervenience thesis\u2019\u2014or, for short, argument by appeal to\na FIST.\n\nHere are a few well-known arguments by appeal to a FIST. Suppose\nsomeone claims that there are neurophysiological properties, perhaps\nyet to be discovered, to which intentional properties like believing\nthat P reduce. This claim implies that intentional properties\nsupervene on neurophysiological properties. The Twin Earth thought\nexperiments given by Tyler Burge (1979) and Hilary Putnam (1975) are\n(putative) counterexamples to that supervenience claim; they are cases\nof neurophysiologically indiscernible people whose thoughts have\ndifferent contents.\n\nAnother argument by appeal to a FIST is Chalmers\u2019 appeal to the\n(putative) metaphysical possibility of zombies (see\n Section 3.1\n and\n Section 5.4).\n This is intended to show that phenomenal properties do not\nmetaphysically supervene on, and thus do not reduce to, physical\nproperties. This line of argument is available even though\nphysicalists have not yet proposed any such reduction. If it succeeds,\nthen the project of reducing phenomenal properties to physical\nproperties is doomed to failure.\n\nConsider a third example, from epistemology. A simple causal\ntheory of perceptual knowledge says that a subject\u2019s perceptual\nknowledge that P can be analyzed in terms of\nP\u2019s bearing the right kind of causal relation to the\nsubject\u2019s belief that P. To test this claim, we need\nnot await proposals as to what the kind of causal relation in question\nis. For this project of conceptual analysis can succeed only if two\nbelievers that P cannot differ with respect to perceptually\nknowing that P without differing with respect to how\nP is causally connected to their belief that P.\nAlvin Goldman\u2019s fake barn country case (1976) yields a\n(putative) counterexample to this supervenience claim.\n\nOf course, it is controversial whether any of these arguments\nsucceed, because it is controversial whether the alleged\ncounterexamples to the supervenience claims are really possible. But\nin all three cases, the style of argument is the same\u2014argument\nby appeal to a FIST. (See McLaughlin 1984, 1995.)\n5.2 Internalism/Externalism\n\nDistinctions between internalism and externalism arise in many areas\nin philosophy\u2014philosophy of mind, philosophy of language,\nepistemology, and ethics. All of these distinctions can be\ncharacterized by means of supervenience theses. For example, an\ninternalist about mental content accepts, and an externalist denies,\nthat what a mental state is about supervenes upon neurophysiological\nproperties, or \u201cwhat\u2019s in the head.\u201d The dispute is\nabout whether two thinkers can differ in the contents of their mental\nstates without also differing in some neurophysical respect.\nSimilarly, an internalist about epistemic justification accepts, and\nan externalist denies, that whether a belief is justified supervenes\nupon the mental properties of the believer. The dispute is about\nwhether two believers can differ in whether their beliefs are\njustified without also differing in some mental respect. And an\ninternalist about moral motivation accepts, and an externalist denies,\nthat moral motivation supervenes upon moral judgment. The dispute is\nabout whether two (rational) people can differ in how they are\nmotivated to act without also differing in their judgments about which\nof those actions they ought to perform.\n\nRelatedly, supervenience can also be used to capture the traditional\ndistinction between internal and external relations. As Lewis has\nnoted (1986b, 62), an internal relation (such as being taller\nthan) supervenes on the intrinsic natures of its relata. An\nextrinsic relation (such as being 3 kilometers from ) does\nnot. The main difference between this case and those above is that\nhere there is no real dispute about whether the supervenience thesis\nholds or not; it is widely agreed that there are two kinds of\nrelations.\n5.3 Haecceitism\n\nHaecceitism is the view that identity properties, like being Kofi\nAnnan or being that particular table, do not supervene\non qualitative properties. On this view, every two numerically\ndistinct things differ haecceitistically, but no other difference\nfollows. Questions about whether there could be qualitatively\nindiscernible but numerically distinct things becomes important in\nmodal metaphysics.\n\nThe issue here is an instance of something more general. Supervenience\nplays a useful role in answering questions about the identity and\nindividuation conditions for things belonging to some kind. As\nDavidson pointed out, there is a prima facie puzzle (1980,\nch. 5) about how to address such questions. The answer to the question\n\u201cWhen are two events identical?\u201d is\ntrivial\u2014\u201cNever.\u201d And the answer to the question\n\u201cWhen is an event identical with itself?\u201d is likewise\ntrivial\u2014\u201cAlways.\u201d But surely there is a substantive\nquestion lurking here. Davidson himself opted to get around this worry\nby means of semantic ascent. But an alternative is to move to what\nDavid Lewis calls \u2018a nonduplication principle\u2019 (see J.\nBennett 1988). Instead of asking when two events are identical, we can\nask a fill in the blank question: \u2018no two events can be just\nalike with respect to ______\u2019? Davidson would fill in the blank\nwith \u2018their causes and effects\u2019. Kim would fill in the\nblank with \u2018their subject, time, and constitutive\nproperty\u2019 (1976); others fill in the blank in other ways.\n\nWhat matters here is just that nonduplication principles are\nsupervenience theses. They are supervenience theses that take the\nsupervening set A to be the identity facts for particular\nentities of whatever kind is in question. There cannot be a difference\nin whether an event has a property like being event e without\na difference in its causes and effects (Davidson) or in its subject,\nconstitutive property, and time (Kim). Note that any view that accepts\na nonduplication principle for some sort of entity is ipso\nfacto anti-haecceitist. Both Davidson and Kim are\nanti-haecceitists about events.\n5.4 Characterizing Physicalism\n\nRoughly speaking, physicalism is the view that somehow or other,\neverything is settled by the physical. This is of course vague along a\nnumber of dimensions. One question, beyond the scope of this essay, is\nwhat exactly \u2018physical\u2019 means (see Stoljar\u2019s entry\non physicalism). Another question is about the scope of the\nquantifier: should it really range over everything, or should the\nthesis be restricted to the mental (thus leaving room for non-physical\nentities like platonic numbers, abstract universals, or God)? While\nthe sociological question of which of these theses is usually intended\nis also beyond the scope of this essay, the distinction will appear\nagain. And a third question is what exactly \u2018settled by\u2019\nmeans. \n\nThis last question is the relevant one here, because for a roughly 30\nyear period beginning with Davidson\u2019s \u201cMental Events\u201d\n(1970, 214), philosophers used supervenience as a placeholder for the\nneeded relation. That is, physicalism was regularly characterized as\nthe view that everything\u2014or perhaps just the\nmental\u2014supervenes on the physical. More specifically, it was\nfrequently characterized as a i) metaphysically necessary ii) strong\nglobal supervenience thesis that is iii) restricted to only a certain\nrange of worlds. We shall say a bit about each in turn, before\nmentioning the more recent turn to instead characterizing physicalism\nin terms of grounding.\n5.4.1 Why say that the thesis is metaphysically necessary?\n\nPhysicalists take the supervenience thesis to hold with metaphysical\nnecessity, because a merely nomologically necessary supervenience\nthesis is compatible with dualism. Dualists can maintain that there\nare fundamental psychophysical laws that maintain the supervenience\nconnection (McLaughlin 1992, Chalmers 1996). Since no physicalist will\nagree, capturing physicalism requires a supervenience thesis that\nholds with full-blown metaphysical necessity. \n5.4.2 Why use strong global supervenience?\n\nPhysicalism is characterized in terms of global supervenience as\nopposed to individual supervenience because an individual\u2019s mental\nstates do not locally supervene on her intrinsic brain states for\nreasons that do not impugn physicalism as intuitively understood.\nNotably, the contents of her propositional attitudes depend upon the\nsurrounding environment if any kind of externalism is true (See Putnam\n1975 and the entry on externalism). \n\nBut why strong global supervenience instead of one of the weaker two\nvarieties, intermediate or weak (see\n 4.3.2)?\n The answer is that neither of those is strong enough. An intermediate\nglobal supervenience thesis would allow a world physically\nindiscernible from this one, in which precisely the same mental\nproperties are instantiated as are instantiated here, but in which\nphysically indiscernible individuals swap mental lives. A weak global\nsupervenience characterization of physicalism would go further. It\nwould allow a world physically indiscernible from this one, in which\nprecisely the same mental properties are instantiated as are\ninstantiated here, but in which they are differently distributed among\nentities without any restriction. For example, a weak global\nsupervenience characterization of physicalism is compatible with the\nexistence of a world physically indiscernible from this one in which\nTaylor Swift and Peter Singer exchange mental lives (see\n 4.3.5).\n Physicalism should not allow either sort of mental property\nswapping.\n5.4.3 Why restrict the thesis to a certain range of worlds?\n\nStill, physicalism cannot just be the thesis that the mental facts (or\nall the facts) strongly globally supervenience with\nlogical/metaphysical necessity on the physical facts and laws, because\nmany physicalists want to allow for the metaphysical possibility of\nthings like ghosts or Cartesian souls. They think that there actually\naren\u2019t any such things, not that there could not be any, nor\neven that there could not be any compatibly with the physical facts of\nour world. They thus do in fact allow that two worlds could be\nphysical duplicates but differ mentally, in virtue of only one of them\ncontaining disembodied spirits, say. (Note that because the worlds are\nphysical duplicates, those spirits either exert no causal influence on\nthe physical at all, or else only exert redundant,\n\u2018overdeterministic\u2019 causal influence on the physical.)\n\nVarious philosophers have offered various ways of defining physicalism\nto allow for this possibility, while continuing to rely upon global\nsupervenience. The key in all cases is to limit the range of worlds in\nwhich the global supervenience thesis holds. For example, David Lewis\ntook physicalism to be the claim that\n\nAmong worlds where no natural properties alien to our world are\ninstantiated, no two differ without differing physically; any two such\nworlds that are exactly alike physically are duplicates (Lewis 1983b,\n364).\n Jackson offers the following:\n\n\nAny world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world is a\nduplicate simpliciter (Jackson, 1998, 12).\n\n\nwhere a minimal physical duplicate is what results from duplicating\nall the physical facts and \u201cstopping right there.\u201d And David\nChalmers says that physicalism is true in a world w just in case every\npositive fact that obtains in w also obtains in any world physically\nindiscernible from w (1996, 39\u201340). Each of these three\ndefinitions allows for worlds in which physicalism fails: worlds that\nare physical duplicates of the actual world, and in which there are\nghosts or souls.\n5.4.4 Beyond supervenience physicalism \n\nUnfortunately, even these sophisticated supervenience formulations\nfail to provide an adequate characterization of physicalism. There are\nat least three reasons for this failure, and necessarily existing\nentities or necessarily obtaining facts generate not one but two of\nthem. \n\nRecall that necessary beings (whether entities, facts, or whatever)\nsupervene on anything whatsoever, for the simple reason that such\nthings exist in every world. Because no two worlds can differ in\nwhether they exist, full stop, no two worlds can differ in whether\nthey exist without differing in x, for whatever x\nyou like (see\n section 3.5).\n \n\nThe first problem that necessary beings pose is only a problem for\nwide scope physicalism, the version of the view that says that truly\neverything, not just the mental facts, supervenes on the physical\nfacts. The difficulty is that some putative necessarily existing\nthings, like Platonic numbers or God, do not seem physicalistically\nkosher. Yet their actual existence is compatible with a global\nsupervenience formulation of physicalism.\n\nThe second problem is a problem for both wide scope physicalism and a\nnarrower version only about the mental. As discussed in\n section 3.5),\n the fact that necessarily existing things supervene on anything\nwhatsoever shows that supervenience is not ontological dependence or\ndetermination. After all, the putative fact that God exists globally\nsupervenes on the fact that my cat is named Snoop without the former\nin any way depending on the latter. This is supervenience on the\ncheap, not anything strong enough for physicalism. (For other putative\ncounterexamples to the sufficiency of the supervenience thesis, see\nWitmer 1999 and Hawthorne 2002.)\n\nThe third issue is closely related to the second, though it doesn\u2019t\nturn on necessary existence in particular. It is that many think the\ncorrect statement of physicalism should be in some way explanatory in\na way that the bare supervenience claim is not. One version of this is\nto say that physicalism should say that the physical facts explain the\nmental ones. The supervenience claim alone says no such thing, as\nshown by the case of necessary existents as well as the case of\nproperties supervening on their negations. A different version of this\nis to say that physicalism requires\n\u2018superdupervenience\u2019\u2014that physicalism should explain\nwhy the relevant global supervenience theses holds (see Blackburn\n1984, Horgan 1993, Melnyk 2003, and Wilson 2005). Concerns like these\nshould be familiar from sections\n 3.5\n and\n 3.7).\n \n\nSome think that these concerns can be avoided by moving from\ncharacterizing physicalism in terms of supervenience to characterizing\nphysicalism in terms of grounding (e.g. Rosen 2010, 111; Dasgupta\n2014, 557; Schaffer 2017, section 4). Because grounding is supposed to\nbe hyperintensional, it is not the case that necessary beings or facts\nare grounded by just anything. And grounding is supposed to back\nexplanations as well.\n\nHowever, whether the appeal to grounding really advances anything is a\nmatter of dispute (Wilson 2016). See Stoljar\u2019s entry on physicalism\nfor further discussion. Further, note that we have only raised\nchallenges for the claim that a strong global supervenience thesis is\nsufficient for physicalism. It remains open that some such\nthesis is necessary for physicalism. If it is, then grounding\nphysicalism needs to entail supervenience physicalism. (For\nconsiderations against, see Skiles 2014; for considerations in favor,\nsee Bennett 2017, 3.3.) And if it is, physicalism would remain\ntestable by exposing it to would-be arguments by appeal to FISTS, such\nas the zombie argument. \n5.5 Coincident Entities and the \u201cGrounding Problem\u201d\n\nIt is fairly widely held that more than one object can occupy the same\nspatio-temporal location. Such objects are said to be\nspatio-temporally coincident. The classic example is a statue,\nGoliath, and the lump of clay that constitutes it, Lumpl (see Gibbard\n1975). On one version of the story, Lumpl sits around on a shelf for a\nfew days before the sculptor shapes it into Goliath on a Thursday\nmorning. It looks like Lumpl existed on the previous Wednesday and\nthat Goliath did not, and consequently looks like Leibniz\u2019s Law\nentails that they are distinct objects. On another version of the\nstory, Lumpl and Goliath are created and destroyed at precisely the\nsame moment. Here the two do not have different temporal properties,\nbut they do have different modal ones\u2014Lumpl would still\nexist if we squashed it into a ball, but Goliath would not. Again,\nLeibniz\u2019s Law apparently entails that they are distinct. (See\nRea 1997a for many interesting papers on this issue.)\n\nThe main objection to the view that Goliath and Lumpl are distinct is\nwhat can be called \u2018the grounding problem\u2019. How can Lumpl\nand Goliath differ in their modal properties, given that they are\nalike in every other way? What grounds their difference in\npersistence conditions? In virtue of what do they have the persistence\nconditions they do?\n\nThe grounding problem is sometimes characterized in terms of\nsupervenience failure. Lumpl and Goliath differ in their persistence\nconditions without differing in their physical or categorical\nproperties (see Yablo 1987 for a discussion of categoricity). And it\nis true that many forms of supervenience fail: weak and strong\nindividual supervenience and strong global supervenience all fail. But\nthere are forms of supervenience that can hold. Both weak and\nintermediate global supervenience hold, as does (as the name suggests)\ncoincidence-friendly supervenience, and possibly other versions of\nmultiple-domain supervenience (c.f. Zimmerman 1995, Rea 1997b, Sider\n1999, Baker 2000). All of these forms hold on the plausible assumption\nthat any two regions physically/categorically just like this one will\ncontain an object with Goliath\u2019s persistence conditions, and an\nobject with Lumpl\u2019s persistence conditions.\n\nBut the crucial question is not whether any form of supervenience\nholds, but rather whether those that hold constitute a satisfactory\nanswer to the grounding problem. For a defense of the positive answer,\nsee Sider 1999; for a defense of the negative answer, see Bennett\n2004b. For a new take, see Sider 2008. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armstrong, David, 1978, <em>A Theory of Universals, Vol.2 of\nUniversals and Scientific Realism</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1989, <em>Universals: An Opinionated\nIntroduction</em>, Boulder, CO: Westview Press.", "Audi, Paul, 2012, \u201cGrounding: Toward a Theory of the\nIn-Virtue-Of Relation,\u201d <em>The Journal of Philosophy</em>, 109:\n685\u2013711.", "Bacon, John, 1986, \u201cSupervenience, Necessary Coextension,\nand Reducibility,\u201d <em>Philosophical Studies</em> 49:\n163\u201376.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1990, \u201cVan Cleve Versus\nClosure,\u201d <em>Philosophical Studies</em> 8: 239\u2013242.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1995, \u201cWeak Supervenience\nSupervenes,\u201d in E.
