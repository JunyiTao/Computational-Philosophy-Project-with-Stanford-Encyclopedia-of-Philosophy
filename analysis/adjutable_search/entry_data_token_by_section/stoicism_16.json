    "main_text": "Logic || Propositions\n3.3 Propositions\n\nPropositions are the only bearers of truth-value and the central\nentity in much of Stoic philosophy of language and logic. Sometimes\nalso translated as \u201cassertibles\u201d, Stoic propositions bear\nsome similarities to the modern proposition, but also some important\ndifferences. Notably, Stoic propositions change truth-value over time,\nso \u201cit is day\u201d is true while it is day, will become false\nwhen it is night, and true again the following day, etc. The Stoics\nalso distinguish different types of propositions on the basis of their\nsubject (Sextus, 34\u0397; Diogenes Laertius, 34\u039a). The major\nthree types of simple affirmative propositions are the definite or\ncategorical, composed of a deictic or demonstrative and a predicate\n(\u201cthis one walks\u201d); the middle or categoreutical, whose\nsubject is expressed by a noun (\u201cSocrates walks\u201d,\n\u201cman sits\u201d); and the indefinite whose subject is expressed\nby an indefinite pronoun (\u201csomeone is sitting\u201d). These\ndifferent types of propositions have different semantic but also\nepistemological properties, as a result of the modes of references of\ntheir subject (Durand 2019). For example, one perhaps surprising\nproperty of the definite is that it can only be said of objects to\nwhich one has successfully referred, so that, for example, the\nproposition \u201cthis one is dead\u201d, can only be said of\nsomething or someone that exists, but is \u201cdestroyed\u201d, that\nis, is no longer a proposition and no longer has a truth-value if and\nwhen the referent ceases to exist. As a result, \u201cthis one is\ndead\u201d can never be said truly, since it would be true only of\nobjects to which reference cannot be fixed deictically. This odd\nfeature is appealed to in the Stoic response to competing accounts of\nmodality\n (3.5).\n\nThe so-called simple propositions can be combined to form complex\npropositions, composed of multiple simple propositions joined by a\nconnective. The Stoics thus developed accounts of the truth-conditions\nof the conjunction (\u201cp and q\u201d),\ndisjunction (\u201cp or q\u201d), which they\ntreated as exclusive, and entered the lively ancient debate over the\ncorrect understanding of conditionals (\u201cif p, then\nq\u201d). (For more on this, see the entry on\n Ancient Logic, section 5.2.)\n They also treated the negation as truth-functional and as negating a\nwhole proposition (\u201cit is not the case that p\u201d:\nAlex. Aphr., in Ar. An. Pr. 402.12\u201319 = FDS 921), which\ncould be applied to simple or complex propositions. The Stoic interest\nin non-simple propositions and their logical relations was shared\nwith, and built upon work by, philosophers in the\n Dialectical School.\n",
