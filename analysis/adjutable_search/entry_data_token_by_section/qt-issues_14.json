    "main_text": "Quantum computing and quantum information theory\n7. Reconstructions of quantum mechanics and beyond\n\nAnother area of active research in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics is the attempt to gain deeper insight into the structure of\nthe theory, and the ways in which it differs from both classical\nphysics and other theories that one might construct, by characterizing\nthe structure of the theory in terms of very general principles, often\nwith an information-theoretic flavour.\n\nThis project has its roots in early work of Mackey (1957, 1963),\nLudwig (1964), and Piron (1964) aiming to characterize quantum\nmechanics in operational terms. This has led to the development of a\nframework of generalized probabilistic model. It also has connections\nwith the investigations into quantum logic initiated by Birkhoff and\nvon Neumann (1936) (see the entry\n quantum logic and probability theory\n for an overview).\n\nInterest in the project of deriving quantum theory from axioms with\nclear operational content was revived by the work of Hardy (2001\n[2008], Other Internet Resources). Significant results along these\nlines include the axiomatizations of Masanes and M\u00fcller (2011)\nand Chiribella, D\u2019Ariano, and Perinotti (2011). See Chiribella\nand Spekkens (2015) for an overview of this burgeoning research\narea.\n",
