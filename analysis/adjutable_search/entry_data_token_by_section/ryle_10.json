    "main_text": "Sensation\n12. Sensation\n\nRyle was unhappy with the treatment he gave of the concepts of\nsensation and perception in The Concept of Mind. In both the\nForeword and the Afterword of the chapter entitled \u201cSensation\nand Observation\u201d, he expresses his dissatisfaction at having\ngiven too much to the opposition by having \u201cfallen in\u201d\nwith the Official story that perceiving involves having\nsensations.\n\nIn a later paper (1956) Ryle corrects this. The idea that perceiving\ninvolves \u201chaving sensations\u201d is called into question with\nan investigation of the ordinary concepts of sensation and feeling and\ntheir relation to the technical notions of sense-impression and\nsense-data. (Arguably, today\u2019s notion of \u201cperceptual\nexperiences\u201d \u2013 conceptual or non-conceptual\u2014also\nfigure as a target of Ryle\u2019s arguments.) In this section, I\nshall discuss the negative thesis that perception does not require the\npostulation of sensations construed in its ordinary sense and why one\nmotivation for postulating sense-data or sense-impressions should be\nresisted. In the next, I discuss a different motivation and show why\nthe thickness of perceptual concepts thwarts attempts to discover the\n\u201cnature\u201d of perception in physiological, optical,\nacoustic, etc. phenomena.\n\nBoth philosophers and physiologists \u201cpass without apology\u201d\nfrom saying that without optical or auditory sense-impressions there\nis no seeing or hearing to saying that seeing and hearing involve the\nhaving of sensations. But can the sense-impressions which are\nsupposedly required for perception be identified with sensations or\nfeelings in one of their non-technical senses?\n\nRyle suggests not. On one understanding of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d we include pains, nausea, tickles,\nsuffocation, and thirst, which are distressing in some way. (In the\nConcept of Mind he notes that not all\n\u201cagitations\u201d are disagreeable: \u201cPeople voluntarily\nsubject themselves to suspense, fatigue, perplexity, fear, and\nsurprise \u2026\u201d(95).)\n\nA different understanding of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d comes with tactual sensations of external\nobjects and kinaesthetic sensations (of anatomically internal things\nand events). Instances of the latter include the feeling of warmth,\nsay, as my hand approaches a fire or feeling how cold, rough, smooth,\nslippery, or sticky some things are or whether they are vibrating,\nstiff, resilient, or loose.\n\nPace Berkeley, the difference between these types of states\nis not merely a matter of degree: feeling the warmth of a fire is not\nlike a feeling of pain. Feeling the fire is hotter than it was before\nis a matter of perception, discrimination, or finding out a\ndifference. People can be better at it than others: doctors acquire\nthe skill of feeling pulses that an untrained person cannot and race\ndrivers feel a car going into a skid well before an ordinary motorist\ncan. Feeling pain, giddy, nauseous, or high, by contrast are not a\nmatter of perception, an acquired skill or that which training can\nfine-tune. Mistakes due to carelessness are ruled out when we talk of\nsensations qua pain or elation; they are not ruled out when\nit comes to perception as discrimination or detection.\n\nArmed with these two sets of implication threads (and in this sense,\ndifferent understandings of, or things we count\nas) sensation or feeling, it can be seen that perception\nrequires neither of these. Seeing a cat does not require that I feel\nanything in the sense of pain, discomfort, tickle, giddiness, or calm\n(nor, we can add, relief, amusement, surprise, or rapture). Nor,\nhowever, does seeing a cat or hearing a violin require that I\ntactually or kinaesthetically feel with my eye or with my ear that\nwhich I also perceive. Nor does smelling require that I feel, in this\nsense, with my nose. And though the tongue is a double-sense organ\ninsofar as I can tactually and kinaesthetically detect the texture and\nthe temperature of food in my mouth, as well as taste it, tasting food\ndoes not depend upon my being able to feel these other properties of\nthe food with my tongue.\n\nSo, Ryle says, when philosophers and psychologists assert that all\nperceiving involves the having of sensations or the feeling of\nsomething, either they are wrong or they are using a third, different\nunderstanding of \u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d.\n\nLet us examine this different sense of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d. It does not seem to derive from ordinary use,\nwhich, we might suggest, would not in itself be a problem, as long as\nthe implication threads of one understanding are not crossed with\nthose of another. Consider the epistemologist\u2019s notion of\nsense-data or sense-impressions which are posited as candidates for\ngrounding knowledge or certainty in what is supposedly given in\nperception. Suppose this third understanding of sensation or\nfeeling derives from sense-data or sense-impressions thus\nunderstood. Whatever the merits or demerits of this view, in order for\nsensations\u2014now understood as sense-impressions or\nsense-data\u2014to play this foundational role, we must be\nconscious of them. Curiously enough, however, we do not report them.\nInstead, we report what we see under different descriptions, which\ncarry different luggage-loads. (Or, as Austin said, we report what we\nsee under different descriptions which depend, in part, on how far we\nare willing to stick our neck out.) Someone who claimed to see\nsomething green might subsequently, when he learns of the presence of\na cat, claim that what he saw was the eyes of a cat. The\n\u201cluggage\u201d that Ryle speaks of here includes the logical\nthreads (including implication and evidence, etc.) that accompany\ncertain descriptions rather than others. (There are more ways to be\nwrong, as Austin says, the more we stick our necks out.) We shall come\nback to this in the next section. But now we are investigating a\nthird, new sense of \u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d\nwhich derives, not from ordinary use, but from the (alleged) needs of\nepistemology. But what supports the idea that we see have such\nexperiences?\n\nNot the fact that we report appearances, for, as Ryle reminds\nus, we use the locution \u201cit appears that \u2026\u201d all the\ntime without committing ourselves to having any particular\nexperiences. \u201c15 x 16 appears to make 220\u201d or \u201cIt\nlooks as if the river is twice the size of the road\u201d commit me\nto no special sense-experiences. So, argues Ryle, we cannot adduce\nidioms of the patterns \u201cIt looks as if \u2026\u201d or\n\u201cIt appears \u2026\u201d as evidence of the untutored,\nuninferential manner in which the postulated sense-impressions are\ndelivered to consciousness. But this leaves us with a problem.\n\nWe have, in fact, no special way of reporting the occurrence of these\npostulated impressions; we are, therefore, without the needed marks of\nour being conscious of such things at all. For there is surely\nsomething absurd in maintaining that we are constantly conscious of\nsome things in the way in which we are conscious of pains, and yet\nhave no way of telling ourselves or other people anything whatsoever\nabout them. (1956, 343)\n\nThis particular theoretical allegiance that drives some\nepistemologists to posit sensations understood in the technical sense\nof sense-data has as its source the idea that there are two kinds of\nspace, which we know today, thanks to Sellars, as the space of reason\nand the space of natural law. In the first, the notion of inference,\nevidence, premises, evidence, and conclusions have their home; in the\nother is the raw \u201cdata\u201d understood in the sense of that\nwhich is given or accepted without argument.\n\nThe allegiance to this picture has its source in the view that all\nthinking intended to result in the discovery or establishment of\ntruths is inferring. A child sees a word on a page, an adult sees a\nmisprint, and an illiterate sees a black mark. Each has eyes in\nperfect working order. According to this view, the difference between\nseeing black marks, a word, or a misprint has to do with the reasoning\nwe bring to what is perceptually given. And sense-data (or, we may\nadd, perceptual experience) play the role of what is given prior to\nany thinking, and prior therefore to any exploitation of knowledge or\nbeliefs previously acquired. A datum, as it is used here, is something\nthat we reason from and does not have to be reasoned\nto.\n\nRyle dismisses this motivation for introducing sensation thus\nunderstood on the grounds that not all thinking is inferring.\nMultiplying, for example, is thinking but our calculations are not\nconclusions and our mistakes are not fallacies. If it is not true that\nthe thinking that enters into perceptual recognition, identification,\ncomparison, etc. is inferring then the search for its fund of premises\nis the search for nothing.\n\nBut worse, why suppose that seeing the misprint or seeing a crop of\nwheat (as opposed to a word, or a planted field) is thinking at all?\nIt may be discerned in a flash; there may be no moment, however short,\nin which one might be described as pondering, reflecting, or putting\ntwo and two together. All the argument has shown so far is that\nwithout a particular training, recognising a misprint or a crop of\nwheat would be impossible. Why suppose the exploitation of the\nknowledge resulting from this training involves thinking qua\nreflecting, pondering, or inferring?\n\nHere the fact that the misprint is immediately obvious to him is\nsupposed to need to be explained not just by reference to his prior\neducation, but also by the postulation of the performance by him of a\npiece of thinking, with the queer property of not requiring any time\nfor its performance. (1956, 345)\n\nAccording to Ryle, seeing a misprint involves the possession of the\nexploitation of knowledge already acquired. But this exploitation of\nknowledge required for perceptual recognition, identification, etc.\nneed not embody any thinking; a fortiori, it need not embody\ninferential thinking. \u201cSo the argument for the occurrence of\nsense-impressions to be the data or premises for the inferential\nthinking embodied is doubly broken-backed\u201d (1956, 345).\n\nReaders interested in Ryle\u2019s thoughts about perception and\nimagination are referred to the following supplementary documents:\n\nRyle on Perception\nRyle on Imagination\n\n",
