Study of Specific Constitutions\n\nThe purpose of political science is to guide \u201cthe good lawgiver\nand the true politician\u201d (IV.1.1288b27). Like any complete\nscience or craft, it must study a range of issues concerning its\nsubject matter. For example, gymnastics (physical education) studies\nwhat sort of training is best or adapted to the body that is naturally\nthe best, what sort of training is best for most bodies, and what\ncapacity is appropriate for someone who does not want the condition or\nknowledge appropriate for athletic contests. Political science studies\na comparable range of constitutions (1288b21\u201335): first, the\nconstitution which is best without qualification, i.e., \u201cmost\naccording to our prayers with no external impediment\u201d; second,\nthe constitution that is best under the circumstances \u201cfor it is\nprobably impossible for many persons to attain the best\nconstitution\u201d; third, the constitution which serves the aim a\ngiven population happens to have, i.e., the one that is best\n\u201cbased on a hypothesis\u201d: \u201cfor [the political\nscientist] ought to be able to study a given constitution, both how it\nmight originally come to be, and, when it has come to be, in what\nmanner it might be preserved for the longest time; I mean, for\nexample, if a particular city happens neither to be governed by the\nbest constitution, nor to be equipped even with necessary things, nor\nto be the [best] possible under existing circumstances, but to be a\nbaser sort.\u201d Hence, Aristotelian political science is not\nconfined to the ideal system, but also investigates the second-best\nconstitution or even inferior political systems, because this may be\nthe closest approximation to full political justice which the lawgiver\ncan attain under the circumstances.\n\nRegarding the constitution that is ideal or \u201caccording to\nprayer,\u201d Aristotle criticizes the views of his predecessors in\nthe Politics and then offers a rather sketchy blueprint\nof his own in Politics VII\u2013VIII. Although his own\npolitical views were influenced by his teacher Plato, Aristotle is\nhighly critical of the ideal constitution set forth in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic on the grounds that it overvalues political unity,\nit embraces a system of communism that is impractical and inimical to\nhuman nature, and it neglects the happiness of the individual citizens\n(Politics II.1\u20135). In contrast, in Aristotle\u2019s\n\u201cbest constitution,\u201d each and every citizen will possess\nmoral virtue and the equipment to carry it out in practice, and\nthereby attain a life of excellence and complete happiness (see\nVII.13.1332a32\u20138). All of the citizens will hold political\noffice and possess private property because \u201cone should call the\ncity-state happy not by looking at a part of it but at all the\ncitizens.\u201d (VII.9.1329a22\u20133). Moreover, there will be a\ncommon system of education for all the citizens, because they share\nthe same end (Pol. VIII.1).\n\nIf (as is the case with most existing city-states) the population\nlacks the capacities and resources for complete happiness, however,\nthe lawgiver must be content with fashioning a suitable constitution\n(Politics IV.11). The second-best system typically takes the\nform of a polity (in which citizens possess an inferior, more common\ngrade of virtue) or mixed constitution (combining features of\ndemocracy, oligarchy, and, where possible, aristocracy, so that no\ngroup of citizens is in a position to abuse its rights). Aristotle\nargues that for city-states that fall short of the ideal, the best\nconstitution is one controlled by a numerous middle class which stands\nbetween the rich and the poor. For those who possess the goods of\nfortune in moderation find it \u201ceasiest to obey the rule of\nreason\u201d (Politics IV.11.1295b4\u20136). They are\naccordingly less apt than the rich or poor to act unjustly toward\ntheir fellow citizens. A constitution based on the middle class is the\nmean between the extremes of oligarchy (rule by the rich) and\ndemocracy (rule by the poor). \u201cThat the middle [constitution] is\nbest is evident, for it is the freest from faction: where the middle\nclass is numerous, there least occur factions and divisions among\ncitizens\u201d (IV.11.1296a7\u20139). The middle constitution is\ntherefore both more stable and more just than oligarchy and\ndemocracy.\n\nAlthough Aristotle classifies democracy as a deviant constitution\n(albeit the best of a bad lot), he argues that a case might be made\nfor popular rule in Politics III.11, a discussion which has\nattracted the attention of modern democratic theorists. The central\nclaim is that the many may turn out to be better than the virtuous few\nwhen they come together, even though the many may be inferior when\nconsidered individually. For if each individual has a portion of\nvirtue and practical wisdom, they may pool these moral assets and turn\nout to be better rulers than even a very wise individual. This\nargument seems to anticipate treatments of \u201cthe wisdom of the\nmultitude\u201d such as Condorcet\u2019s \u201cjury theorem.\u201d\nIn recent years, this particular chapter has been widely discussed in\nconnection with topics such as democratic deliberation and public\nreason.\n\nIn addition, the political scientist must attend to existing\nconstitutions even when they are bad. Aristotle notes that \u201cto\nreform a constitution is no less a task [of politics] than it is to\nestablish one from the beginning,\u201d and in this way \u201cthe\npolitician should also help existing constitutions\u201d\n(IV.1.1289a1\u20137). The political scientist should also be\ncognizant of forces of political change which can undermine an\nexisting regime. Aristotle criticizes his predecessors for excessive\nutopianism and neglect of the practical duties of a political\ntheorist. However, he is no Machiavellian. The best constitution still\nserves as a regulative ideal by which to evaluate existing\nsystems.\n\nThese topics occupy the remainder of the Politics. Books\nIV\u2013VI are concerned with the existing constitutions: that is,\nthe three deviant constitutions, as well as polity or the\n\u201cmixed\u201d constitution, which are the best attainable under\nmost circumstances (IV.2.1289a26\u201338). The mixed constitution has\nbeen of special interest to scholars because it looks like a\nforerunner of modern republican regimes. The whole of book V\ninvestigates the causes and prevention of revolution or political\nchange (metabol\u00ea) and civil war or faction\n(stasis). Books VII\u2013VIII are devoted to the ideal\nconstitution. As might be expected, Aristotle\u2019s attempt to carry out\nthis program involves many difficulties, and scholars disagree about\nhow the two series of books (IV\u2013VI and VII\u2013VIII) are\nrelated to each other: for example, which were written first, which\nwere intended to be read first, and whether they are ultimately\nconsistent with each other. Most importantly, when Aristotle offers\npractical political prescriptions in Books IV\u2013VI, is he guided\nby the best constitution as a regulative ideal, or is he simply\nabandoning political idealism and practicing  a form of\nRealpolitik?For a further discussion of this topic, see the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nSupplement: Characteristics and Problems of Aristotle\u2019s Politics\n\n",
