    "main_text": "Equality of Opportunity and Luck Egalitarianism\n4. Equality of Opportunity and Luck Egalitarianism\n\nThe distribution of material goods and services is not the only\neconomic distribution which is important to people. The distribution\nof opportunities is also important. As noted in the previous section,\nJohn Rawls conjoined his Difference Principle with a principle of\nequality of opportunity. Endorsement of some form of equality of\nopportunity is very prevalent among distributive justice theorists\nand, indeed, among the general population, especially when combined\nwith some form of market distributive mechanism. Equality of\nopportunity is often contrasted favorably with \u2018equality of\noutcome\u2019 or strict egalitarianism, by those who believe that we\ncan show equal concern, respect, or treatment of people without them\nhaving the same material goods and services, so long as they have\nequal economic opportunities. An equality of opportunity principle\nthen, is combined with other principles to ensure that the\ninequalities permitted by the overall theory (whether utilitarian,\ndesert, or a Rawlsian difference principle) are only justified if\npeople have the relevant kind of equal opportunity to achieve greater\nor lesser amounts of goods. So an equality of opportunity principle\nallows those theorists who depart from strict equality to capture some\nof what nonetheless has motivated egalitarians. What is the morally\nbest interpretation of this equality of opportunity principle has been\na significant focus of research (see\n Equality of Opportunity),\n particularly among luck egalitarians. In fact, the luck egalitarian\nideal (also sometimes known as the \u2018level playing field\u2019\nideal) elevates the role of equal opportunity to the central\ndistributive ideal, so that distributive inequalities are only just\nwhen they flow from one\u2019s choices or from factors for which one\ncan reasonably be held responsible.\n\nIn 1988, Brian Barry gave an interesting reconstruction of the\nreasoning which led John Rawls to his Equal Opportunity and Difference\nPrinciples. Barry\u2019s reconstruction and Ronald Dworkin\u2019s\nearlier discussion (which we will come to later), have been seminal in\nthe rise of the luck egalitarian literature; hence, a version of this\nargument is probably the best introduction to some of the relevant\nmoral issues.\n\n\u2018Formal\u2019 equality of opportunity rules out formal\ndiscrimination on grounds such as a person\u2019s race, ethnicity,\nage or gender. What is the underlying concern, shared by most\ntheorists and the general population, with a society lacking formal\nequality of opportunity? The concern seems to be rooted in the belief\nthat traits such as a persons\u2019 gender or race are elements over\nwhich people have no control and, hence, a society in which\npeople\u2019s race or gender have fundamental effects on their\nlifetime economic prospects treats people unfairly. In such societies,\nwhether people were born as the favored gender or race, and hence were\nfavored economically, would simply be a matter of luck. Rawls\u2019\nclaim is that structuring a society so that this \u2018natural\nlottery\u2019 has such fundamental effects on people\u2019s lives is\nimmoral, when we have the option to structure it another way, with a\nsystem of formal equality of opportunity. \n\nThe foregoing is relatively uncontroversial, but what made\nRawls\u2019 (and Barry\u2019s) arguments so interesting was their\nclaim that this line of reasoning actually leads to much stronger (and\nmore contentious) requirements for social justice. They note that even\nwith formal equality of opportunity, there will remain many factors\nover which people have no control but which will affect their lifetime\neconomic prospects, such as whether a person\u2019s family can afford\nto purchase good quality educational opportunities or health care. A\nsociety therefore will have reasons to adopt a more substantial\nequality of opportunity principle, with equal opportunities for\neducation, health care, etc.\u2014the same reasons it had for\nadopting a merely formal equality of opportunity principle. \n\nFollowing this line of reasoning further (and it certainly has\nappeared to many that we have no principled reason to stop here) seems\nto lead to more radical conclusions than those who agreed with formal\nequality of opportunity would have imagined. A society with a more\nsubstantial equality of opportunity principle in place will still not\nbe providing equality of opportunity for all. People are born into\nmore or less nurturing families and social circumstances. People are\nborn into families and neighborhoods which are more or less\nencouraging of education and the development of economically\nadvantageous talents. There are a whole range of social influences\nwhich have fundamental and unequal effects on children\u2019s\neconomic prospects and for which they are in no way \nresponsible\u2014the influences children are exposed to are a matter of their\nluck in the \u2018social lottery\u2019. Moreover, the luck of the\nnatural lottery is not just restricted to such characteristics as\ngender and race. Children are more or less fortunate in the\ndistribution of natural talents as well. \n\nA race where the starting line is arbitrarily staggered, where\npeople\u2019s prospects for winning are not largely determined by\nfactors for which they are responsible but rather largely by luck, is\nnot considered a fair race. Similarly, if society is structured so\nthat people\u2019s prospects for gaining more economic goods are not\nlargely determined by factors for which they are responsible but\nrather largely by luck, then the society is open to the charge of\nbeing unfair. This is the challenging conclusion with which Barry,\nfollowing Rawls, presents us. \n\nIn response to this challenge, Barry himself explores a number of\navenues, including questioning whether economic distribution is really\nanalogous to a race. Rawls, of course, responded to his own challenge\nby arguing that there is not a lot that can be done (morally) to make\nthe social and natural opportunities more equal, so the fair response\nis to adopt the Difference Principle. Others, however, have taken this\nchallenge in different directions.\n\nRonald Dworkin, (Dworkin 1981a, 1981b, 2000) provided one of the most\ndetailed early responses to Rawls\u2019 challenge. In retrospect,\nDworkin\u2019s theory is often identified as one of the earliest in\nthe luck egalitarian literature, though Dworkin himself called his\ntheory Resource Egalitarianism. Dworkin presented his key insight\n(i.e., what distinguishes him from Rawls) in terms of a distinction\nbetween \u2018ambitions\u2019 and \u2018endowments\u2019. Dworkin\nuses the term \u2018ambitions\u2019 to cover the realm of our\nchoices and what results from our choices, such as the choice to work\nhard, or to spend money on expensive luxuries. His term\n\u2018endowments\u2019 refers to the results of brute luck, or those\nthings over which we have no control, such as one\u2019s genetic\ninheritance, or unforeseeable bad luck. Dworkin agrees with Rawls that\nnatural inequalities are not distributed according to people\u2019s\nchoices, nor are they justified by reference to some other morally\nrelevant fact about people, so people should not end up worse off as a\nresult of bad luck in the natural lottery. However, Dworkin argues the\nDifference Principle fails to deliver on this ideal, since its\nformulation in terms of primary goods fails to recognize that those\nwho are very unlucky, such as the severely ill or disabled, may need\nconsiderably greater shares of primary goods than others in order to\nachieve a reasonable life. Dworkin also argued that just economic\ndistributions should be more responsive than the Difference Principle\nto the consequences of people\u2019s choices. \n\nDworkin proposed that people begin with equal resources but be allowed\nto end up with unequal economic benefits as a result of their own\nchoices. What constitutes a just material distribution is to be\ndetermined by the result of a thought experiment designed to model\nfair distribution. Suppose that everyone is given the same purchasing\npower and each uses that purchasing power to bid, in a fair auction,\nfor resources best suited to their life plans. They are then permitted\nto use those resources as they see fit. Although people may end up\nwith different economic benefits, none of them is given less\nconsideration than another in the sense that if they wanted somebody\nelse\u2019s resource bundle they could have bid for it instead.\n\nIn Dworkin\u2019s proposal we see his attitudes to\n\u2018ambitions\u2019 and \u2018endowments\u2019 which have become\na central feature of luck egalitarianism (though under a wide variety\nof alternative names and further subset-distinctions). In terms of\nsensitivity to \u2018ambitions\u2019, Dworkin and many other luck\negalitarians argue that provided people have an \u2018equal\u2019\nstarting point (in Dworkin\u2019s case, resources) they should live\nwith the consequences of their choices. They argue, for instance, that\npeople who choose to work hard to earn more income should not be\nrequired to subsidize those choosing more leisure and hence less\nincome. \n\nWith respect to \u2018endowments\u2019, Dworkin proposes a\nhypothetical compensation scheme in which he supposes that, before the\nhypothetical auction described above, people do not know their own\nnatural endowments. However, they are able to buy insurance against\nbeing disadvantaged in the natural distribution of talents and they\nknow that their payments will provide an insurance pool to compensate\nthose people who are unlucky in the \u2018natural lottery\u2019.\n\nDworkin\u2019s early proposals were very hypothetical and it was\nsomewhat difficult to see what they meant in practice. Later luck\negalitarians have tried to tease out the practical implications of\ntheir theories in more detail, though much of the debate still remains\nat the theoretical level. They agree with Dworkin\u2019s\nrecommendation, against Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle approach,\nthat those with unequal natural endowments should receive\ncompensation. For instance, people born with disabilities, or\nill-health, who have not brought these circumstances upon themselves,\ncan be explicitly compensated so that they are not disadvantaged in\ntheir economic prospects. Under Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle,\nthough, no such explicit compensation is forthcoming\u2014as Rawls\nsays, the Difference Principle is not the principle of redress (Rawls\n1971, 101). Of course, for the subset of people with long-term\ndisabilities or ill-health who are also in the least advantaged group\n(variously defined by Rawls, but most commonly defined as the lowest\nsocio-economic grouping) the Difference Principle will help. But the\nhelp will not be proportionate to their needs arising from their\ndisabilities or ill-health.\n\nLuck egalitarians continue to refine such aspects of their theories as\n(a) what they believe is the relevant conception of equality of\nopportunity, (b) how much of a role luck should play in the\ndistribution of economic benefits and (c) what is the best conception\nof \u2018luck\u2019 (Arneson 1990 and 2001, Fleurbaey 2001, Hurley\n2001 and 2003, Swift 2008, Sher 2010). Relatedly, they continue to\nexplore what role responsibility should play in the distribution of\neconomic goods (Sen 1985, Cohen 1997, Valentyne 1997, Knight\n2011).\n\nBecause the luck egalitarian proposals have a similar motivation to\nthe Difference Principle the moral criticisms of them tend to be\nvariations on those leveled against the Difference Principle. However,\nas noted above, what is practically required of a society operating\nunder the Difference Principle is relatively straightforward. How the\ntheoretical concerns of luck egalitarians are to be practically\nimplemented is often not so clear. For instance, it has seemed\nimpossible to measure differences in people\u2019s natural \ntalents\u2014unfortunately, people\u2019s talents do not neatly divide\ninto the natural and those for which people can be held responsible. A\nsystem of special assistance to the physically and mentally disabled\nand to the ill would be a partial implementation of the compensation\nsystem, but most natural inequalities would be left untouched by such\nassistance while the theories commonly require compensation for such\ninequalities. Exploring how in practical ways the economic systems can\nbe refined to track responsibility while mitigating certain types of\npure luck will be an ongoing challenge for luck egalitarians. A\ndifferent type of challenge has come from theorists who believe\negalitarian justice is not wholly, or even primarily, about\nneutralising or compensating for bad brute luck. (See for example,\nJonathan Wolff, 1998 and 2010, or Elizabeth Anderson, 1999 and 2010.)\nSuch theorists believe the emphasis of justice should be the\nexpression of equal respect for people, and the conditions which will\nallow for equal social standing or equal political participation.\nWhile some distributive measures for counteracting bad luck may be\nnecessary, and taking people\u2019s choices seriously may be part of\nrespecting them, these theorists worry that emphasis on how unlucky\npeople are in the natural lottery, or what poor choices people have\nmade, can run counter to the goal of equal status.\n\n",
