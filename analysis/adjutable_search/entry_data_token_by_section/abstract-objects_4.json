Among philosophers who take\nthe distinction seriously, it is generally supposed that while\nconcrete objects clearly exist, abstract entities are problematic in\ndistinctive ways and deny the existence of abstract entities\naltogether. In this section we briefly survey the arguments for\nnominalism and the responses that platonists have offered. If the\nabstract objects are unified as a class, it is because they have some\nfeature that generates what seems to be a distinctive problem\u2014a\nproblem that nominalists deem unsolvable and which platonists aim to\nsolve. Before we ask what the unifying feature might be, it may\ntherefore help to characterize the various problems it has been\nthought to generate.\n\nThe contemporary debate about platonism developed in earnest when\nQuine argued (1948) that mathematical objects exist, having changed\nhis mind about the nominalist approach he had defended earlier\n(Goodman & Quine 1947). Quine\u2019s 1948 argument involves\nthree key premises, all of which exerted significant influence on the\nsubsequent debate: (i) mathematics is indispensable for empirical\nscience; (ii) we should be ontologically committed to the entities\nrequired for the truth of our best empirical theories (all of which\nshould be expressible in a first-order language); and (iii) the\nentities required for the truth on an empirical theory are those in\nthe range of the variables bounded by its first-order quantifiers\n(i.e., the entities in the domain of the existential quantifier\n\u2018\\(\\exists x\\)\u2019 and the universal quantifier\n\u2018\\(\\forall x\\)\u2019). He concluded that in addition to the\nconcrete entities contemplated by our best empirical science, we must\naccept the existence of mathematical entities, even if they are\nabstract (see also Quine 1960, 1969, 1976).\n\nQuine\u2019s argument initiated a debate that is still alive. Various\nnominalist responses questioned one or another of the premises in his\nargument. For instance, Field (1980) challenged the idea that\nmathematics is indispensable for our best scientific\ntheories\u2014i.e., rejecting (i) above\u2014and thus faced the task\nof rewriting classical and modern physics in nominalistic terms in\norder to sustain the challenge. Others have taken on the somewhat less\ndaunting task of accepting (i) but rejecting (ii) and (iii);\nthey\u2019ve argued that even if our best scientific theories, in\nregimented form, quantify over mathematical entities, this\ndoesn\u2019t entail a commitment to mathematical entities (see\nAzzouni 1997a, 1997b, 2004; Balaguer 1996, 1998; Maddy 1995, 1997;\nMelia 2000, 2002; Yablo 1998, 2002, 2005, 2009; Leng 2010.) Colyvan\n(2010) coined the expression \u2018easy-roaders\u2019 for this\nsecond group, since they avoided the \u2018hard road\u2019 of\nparaphrasing our best scientific theories in non-mathematical\nterms.\n\nBy contrast, some mathematical platonists (Colyvan 2001; Baker 2005,\n2009) have refined Quine\u2019s view by advancing the so-called\n\u2018Enhanced Indispensability Argument\u2019 (though see Saatsi\n2011 for a response). Some participants describe the debate in terms\nof a stalemate they hope to resolve (see Baker 2017, Baron 2016, 2020,\nKnowles & Saatsi 2019, and Mart\u00ednez-Vidal\n& Rivas-de-Castro 2020, for\n discussion).[3]\n\n\nAside from the debate over Quine\u2019s argument, both platonism and\nnominalism give rise to hard questions. Platonists not only need to\nprovide a theory of what abstract objects exist, but also an account\nof how we cognitively access and come to know non-causal, abstract\nentities. This latter question has been the subject of a debate that\nbegan in earnest in Benacerraf (1973), which posed just such a dilemma\nfor mathematical objects. Benacerraf noted that the causal theory of\nreference doesn\u2019t seem to make it possible to know the truth\nconditions of mathematical statements, and his argument applies to\nabstract entities more generally. On the other hand, nominalists need\nto explain the linguistic uses in which we seem to appeal to such\nentities, especially those uses in what appear to be good\nexplanations, such as those in scientific, mathematical, linguistic,\nand philosophical pursuits (see Wetzel 2009, 1\u201322, for a\ndiscussion of the many places where abstract types are used\nin scientific explanations). Even though nominalists argue that there\nare no abstracta, the very fact that there is disagreement about their\nexistence suggests that both platonists and nominalists acknowledge\nthe distinction between the abstract and concrete to be a meaningful\none.\n\nOn the platonist side, various proposals have been raised to address\nthe challenge of explaining epistemic access to abstract entities,\nmostly in connection with mathematical objects. Some, including\nG\u00f6del (1964), allege that we access abstract objects in virtue of\na unique kind of perception (intuition). Maddy (1990, 1997) developed\ntwo rather different ways of understanding our knowledge of\nmathematics in naturalistic ways. Other platonists have argued that\nabstract objects are connected to empirical entities, either via\nabstraction (Steiner 1975; Resnik 1982; Shapiro 1997) or via\nabstraction principles (Wright 1983; Hale 1987); we\u2019ll discuss\nsome of these views below. There are also those who speak of existent\nand intersubjective abstract entities as a kind of mental\nrepresentation (Katz 1980).\n\nA rather different line of approach to the epistemological problem was\nproposed in Linsky & Zalta 1995, where it is suggested that\none shouldn\u2019t attempt to explain knowledge of abstracta on the\nsame model that is used to explain knowledge of concrete objects. They\nargue that not only a certain plenitude principle for abstract objects\n(namely, the comprehension principle for abstract objects put forward\nin Zalta 1983, 1988\u2014see below) yields unproblematic\n\u2018acquaintance by description\u2019 to unique abstract objects\nbut also that their approach actually comports with naturalist\nbeliefs. Balaguer (1995, 1998) also suggests that a plenitude\nprinciple is the best way forward for the platonist, and that our\nknowledge of the consistency of mathematical theories suffices for\nknowledge of mathematical objects. And there are views that conceive\nof abstract objects as constituted by human\u2014or, in general,\nintelligent\u2014subjects, or as abstract artifacts (see Popper 1968;\nThomasson 1999).\n\nA number of nominalists have been persuaded by Benacerraf\u2019s\n(1973) epistemological challenge about reference to abstract objects\nand concluded that sentences with terms making apparent reference to\nthem\u2014such as mathematical statements\u2014are either false or\nlack a truth value. They argue that those sentences must be\nparaphrasable without vocabulary that commits one to any sort of\nabstract entity. These proposals sometimes suggest that statements\nabout abstract objects are merely instrumental; they serve only to\nhelp us establish conclusions about concrete objects. Field\u2019s\nfictionalism (1980, 1989) has been influential in this\nregard. Field reconstructed Newtonian physics using second-order logic\nand quantification over (concrete) regions of space-time. A completely\ndifferent tactic for avoiding the commitment to abstract, mathematical\nobjects is put forward in Putnam (1967) and Hellman (1989), who\nseparately reconstructed various mathematical theories in second-order\nmodal logic. On their view, abstract objects aren\u2019t in\nthe range of the existential quantifier at the actual world (hence, we\ncan\u2019t say that they exist), but they do occur in the range of\nthe quantifier at other possible worlds, where the axioms of the\nmathematical theory in question are true.\n\nThese nominalistic approaches must contend with various issues, of\ncourse. At the very least, they have to successfully argue that the\ntools they use to avoid commitments to abstract objects don\u2019t\nthemselves involve such commitment. For example, Field must argue that\nspace-time regions are concrete entities, while Putnam and Hellman\nmust argue that by relying on logical possibility and modal logic,\nthere is no commitment to possible worlds considered as abstract\nobjects. In general, any nominalist account that makes essential use\nof set theory or model-theoretic structures must convincingly argue\nthat the very use of such analytic tools doesn\u2019t commit them to\nabstract objects. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997 for a systematic\nsurvey of different proposals about the existence of abstract\nobjects.)\n\nAnother nominalistic thread in the literature concerns the suggestion\nthat sentences about (posited) abstract objects are quasi-assertions,\ni.e., not evaluable as to truth or falsehood (see Yablo 2001 and\nKalderon 2005). Still others argue that we should not believe\nsentences about abstracta since their function, much like the\ninstrumentalism discussed earlier, is to ensure empirical adequacy for\nobservational sentences (Yablo 1998). This may involve differentiating\nbetween apparent content, which involves posited abstract objects, and\nreal content, which only concerns concrete objects (Yablo 2001, 2002,\n2010, 2014). (For more on these fictionalist accounts, see Kalderon\n2005, Ch.\u00a03, and the entry on\n fictionalism.)\n\nA final group of views in the literature represents a kind of\nagnosticism about what exists or about what it is to be an object, be\nit abstract or concrete. These views don\u2019t reject an external\nmaterial world, but rather begin with some question as to whether we\ncan have experience, observation, and knowledge of objects directly,\ni.e., independent of our theoretical frameworks. Carnap (1950 [1956]),\nfor example, started with the idea that our scientific knowledge has\nto be expressed with respect to a linguistic framework and that when\nwe wish to put forward a theory about a new kind of entity, we must\nhave a linguistic framework for talking about those entities. He then\ndistinguished two kinds of existence questions: internal questions\nwithin the framework about the existence of the new entities\nand external questions about the reality of the framework itself. If\nthe framework deals with abstract entities such as numbers, sets,\npropositions, etc., then the internal question can be answered by\nlogical analysis of the rules of the language, such as whether it\nincludes terms for, or implies claims that quantify over, abstract\nobjects. But, for Carnap, the external question, about whether the\nabstract entities really exist, is a pseudo-question and should be\nregarded as nothing more than the pragmatic question of whether the\nframework is a useful one to adopt, for scientific or other forms of\nenquiry. We\u2019ll discuss Carnap\u2019s view in more detail in\n subsection\u00a03.7.1.\n\nSome have thought that Carnap\u2019s view offers a\ndeflationist view of objects, since it appears that the\nexistence of objects is not language independent. After Carnap\u2019s\nseminal article, several other deflationist approaches were put\nforward (Putnam 1987, 1990; Hirsch 2002, 2011; Sider 2007, 2009;\nThomasson 2015), many of them claiming to be a vindication of\nCarnap\u2019s view. However, there are deflationist proposals that\nrun counter to Carnap\u2019s approach, among them, deflationary\nnominalism (Azzouni 2010) or agnosticism about abstract objects (Bueno\n2008a, 2008b, 2020). Additionally, philosophers inspired by\nFrege\u2019s work have argued for a minimal notion of an object (Rayo\n2013, Rayo 2020 [Other Internet Resources]; and Linnebo\n2018). We\u2019ll discuss some of these in greater detail below, in\nsubsection\u00a03.7.2.  A final agnostic\nposition that has emerged is one that rejects a strict version of\nplatonism, but suggests that neither a careful analysis of\nmathematical practice (Maddy 2011), nor the enhanced version of the\nindispensability argument (Leng 2020) suffice to decide between\nnominalism and moderate versions of platonism. Along these lines,\nBalaguer (1998) concluded that the question doesn\u2019t have an\nanswer, since the arguments for \u2018full-blooded\u2019 platonism\ncan be matched one-for-one by equally good arguments by the\nanti-platonist.\n\nFor additional discussion about the basic positions in the debate\nabout abstract and concrete objects, see Szab\u00f3 2003 and the\nentries on\n nominalism in metaphysics\n and\n platonism in metaphysics,\n nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics and\n platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n",
