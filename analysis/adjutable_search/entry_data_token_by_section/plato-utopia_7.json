    "main_text": "Theology\n8. Theology\n\nThe Athenian opens the dialogue by asking Kleinias and Megillus\nwhether god or some man is responsible for their laws, and they answer\nthat, for each of them, it is a god (Zeus for the Cretans and Apollo\nfor the\n Spartans).[52]\n God is thus presented from the very start of the dialogue as the\nappropriate source of law and human institutions. This notion of god\nas the lawgiver or ruler for a city returns in Book 4, when the three\nare considering what sort of constitution to give to their new city:\nthere, the Athenian claims that the best ruler for a city to have is\ngod, and that they ought to imitate the rule of god by ordering their\nsociety in obedience to the immortal element within themselves, namely\nreason, which here will have the name of law (Laws 714A; see\nalso Laws 762E, where service to the laws is said to be\nservice to the gods). God is also presented in the Laws as\nthe appropriate model for a human life. In the address to the new\nsettlers, they are told that they ought to become like god, and that\nto do this is to become virtuous; in fact, the Athenian claims that\ngod is the measure of human affairs, where this means that god, by\npossessing the virtues, embodies the standard to which we should aim\n(Laws\n 716C\u2013D).[53]\n It is also worth noting that the early books of the Laws\noften present a fairly traditional theology: we\u2019re encouraged to\npray to the gods, the gods are presented as having the power to\nintervene in human affairs, and the Athenian happily uses the names of\nthe Olympian gods (see e.g. Laws 717A, 828B\u2013D).\n\nBook 10 takes up the existence and nature of the god(s) as its main\ntheme, and it is here that we get the most sophisticated theology the\nLaws has to offer. The bulk of the book is presented as the\nprelude to impiety laws, and consists in an argument against three\nbeliefs which are the characteristic causes of impiety: (1) that the\ngods do not exist; (2) that the gods are not concerned with human\nbeings; and (3) that the gods can be influenced by prayers and\nsacrifices.\n\nThe Athenian begins by addressing those who believe that the gods do\nnot exist. He attributes to these people the view that it is material\nsubstances which exist by nature and which are the causes of the\nmotions we see in the cosmos, and says that what they\u2019ve failed\nto understand is the nature and power of soul \u2013 that is, the\nfact that soul is \u201camong the first things\u201d and older than\nbodies, and that \u201cit more than anything governs their changes\nand all of their transformations\u201d (Laws\n 892A2\u20137).[54]\n He begins by arguing that soul, which he here defines in terms of\nself-motion, must be the source of all other motions, as none of them\nhave the capacity to move themselves. Soul is not simply the original\nsource of all motion, however; the Athenian also claims that it\ngoverns the motion of all bodies which are in motion by using\nits own characteristic motions (e.g., wishing and believing) to take\nover the secondary motions of\n bodies.[55]\n As soul governs the motion of bodies in general, it must govern the\nmotions of the heavens in particular (896E); and as those motions are\norderly, they must be governed by a good soul possessing reason rather\nthan a bad soul (897B\u2013898C). The Athenian then says that such a\nsoul \u2013 one possessing reason and governing the orderly motions\nof the heavens \u2013 ought to be regarded as a god (899A\u2013B).\nThis concludes the argument with someone who thinks that the gods do\nnot exist. The Athenian then turns to argue that god (or, the gods)\ncare for human beings and cannot be bribed. These arguments crucially\nappeal to a characterization of god as a craftsman and a ruler: god\nwould be a poor craftsman indeed if he did not attend to even the\nsmall parts of the whole (i.e., human beings), and a bad ruler if he\ncould be bribed with prayers and\n sacrifices.[56]\n\nThese arguments raise a number of questions:\n\n\n\nThe Athenian goes back and forth, in the entire text of the\nLaws, between speaking of \u2018god\u2019 and \u2018the\ngods\u2019. How many gods are there, and, if more than one, is there\none which is somehow\n supreme?[57]\n\n\n\nWhat is the nature of a god? Plato\u2019s argument demonstrates that\nthere are gods by identifying a certain sort of soul \u2013 one that\npossesses reason and governs the heavens \u2013 as a god. Are\nall gods like this, or can there be a god without soul? Plato\nalso claims that soul is \u201camong the first things to have come\ninto being\u201d (892C4). Do some or all gods come into being, or is\nthere a god who has always\n existed?[58]\n\n\n\nSoul is said to be the cause of all motions and, thus, \u201cof good\nthings and bad\u201d (896D6), and Plato suggests the hypothesis of an\nevil soul precisely to explain bad things (896E). On the other hand,\nPlato elsewhere explains the existence of evil in other\n terms[59];\n and soul and especially god are deeply linked to reason and good\norder in this discussion. Is a cosmic soul (either good or bad)\nresponsible for evil in the Laws, or is there some other\ncause of\n evil?[60]\n\n\n\nHow do cosmic souls govern the motions of the celestial bodies? Is it\nby being within them, by acting on them by means of some external\nmatter, or in some other\n way?[61]\n\n\n\nFinally, how does the theology of the Laws relate to the\ntheology of other late dialogues such as the Timaeus,\nPhilebus, and\n Statesman?[62]\n\n\n\nWhat is clear from the theological discussion in Book 10, however, is\nthat god is something which governs the cosmos, by using reason, in a\nway that aims at its best state. This adds richness to the idea that\ngod and god\u2019s rule provides a standard for law and for\nindividual human lives: just as god governs the cosmos, so too law\ngoverns a society and reason an individual, in all cases for the sake\nof their best\n state.[63]\n",
