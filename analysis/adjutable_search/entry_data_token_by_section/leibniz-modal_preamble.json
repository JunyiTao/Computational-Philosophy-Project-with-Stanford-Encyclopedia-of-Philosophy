    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn the main article on Leibniz, it was claimed that Leibniz's\nphilosophy can be seen as a reaction to the Cartesian theory of\ncorporeal substance and the necessitarianism of Spinoza and\nHobbes. This entry will address this second aspect of his\nphilosophy. In the course of his writings, Leibniz developed an\napproach to questions of modality\u2014necessity, possibility,\ncontingency\u2014that not only served an important function within\nhis general metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical theology but\nalso has continuing interest today. Indeed, it has been suggested that\n20th-century developments in modal logic were either based\non Leibnizian insights or at least had a Leibnizian spirit.\n",
