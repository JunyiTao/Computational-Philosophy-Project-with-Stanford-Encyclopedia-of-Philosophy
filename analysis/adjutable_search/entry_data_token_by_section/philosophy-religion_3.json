    "main_text": "The Meaning of Religious Beliefs || Wittgensteinian Philosophy of Religion\n2.2 Wittgensteinian Philosophy of Religion\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s early work was interpreted by some members of the\nVienna Circle as friendly to their empiricism, but they were surprised\nwhen he visited the Circle and, rather than Wittgenstein discussing\nhis Tractatus, he read them poetry by Rabindranath Tagore\n(1861\u20131941), a Bengal mystic (see Taliaferro 2005b: chapter\neight). In any case, Wittgenstein\u2019s later work, which was not\nfriendly to their empiricism, was especially influential in post-World\nWar II philosophy and theology and will be the focus here.\n\nIn the Philosophical Investigations (published posthumously\nin 1953) and in many other works (including the publication of notes\ntaken by his students on his lectures), Wittgenstein opposed what he\ncalled the picture theory of meaning. On this view, statements are\ntrue or false depending upon whether reality matches the picture\nexpressed by the statements. Wittgenstein came to see this view of\nmeaning as deeply problematic. The meaning of language is, rather, to\nbe found not in referential fidelity but in its use in what\nWittgenstein referred to as forms of life. As this position\nwas applied to religious matters, D.Z. Phillips (1966, 1976), B.R.\nTilghman (1994), and, more recently, Howard Wettstein (2012), sought\nto displace traditional metaphysical debate and arguments over theism\nand its alternatives and to focus instead on the way language about\nGod, the soul, prayer, resurrection, the afterlife, and so on,\nfunctions in the life of religious practitioners. For example,\nPhillips contended that the practice of prayer is best not viewed as\nhumans seeking to influence an all powerful, invisible person, but to\nachieve solidarity with other persons in light of the fragility of\nlife. Phillips thereby sees himself as following Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlead by focusing, not on which picture of reality seems most faithful,\nbut on the non-theoretical ways in which religion is practiced.\n\n\nTo ask whether God exists is not to ask a theoretical question. If it\nis to mean anything at all, it is to wonder about praising and\npraying; it is to wonder whether there is anything in all that. This\nis why philosophy cannot answer the question \u201cDoes God\nexist?\u201d with either an affirmative or a negative reply \u2026\n\u201cThere is a God\u201d, though it appears to be in the\nindicative mood, is an expression of faith. (Phillips 1976: 181; see\nalso Phillips 1970: 16\u201317)\n\n\nAt least two reasons bolstered this philosophy of religion inspired by\nWittgenstein. First, it seemed as though this methodology was more\nfaithful to the practice of philosophy of religion being truly\nabout the actual practice of religious persons themselves.\nSecond, while there has been a revival of philosophical arguments for\nand against theism and alternative concepts of God (as will be noted\nin\n section 5),\n significant numbers of philosophers from the mid-twentieth century\nonward have concluded that all the traditional arguments and\ncounter-arguments about the metaphysical claims of religion are\nindecisive. If that is the case, the Wittgenstein-inspired new\nphilosophy of religion had the advantage of shifting ground to what\nmight be a more promising area of agreement.\n\nWhile this non-realist approach to religion has its defenders today,\nespecially in work by Howard Wettstein, many philosophers have\ncontended that traditional and contemporary religious life rests on\nmaking claims about what is truly the case in a realist context. It is\nhard to imagine why persons would pray to God if they, literally,\nthought there is no God of any kind. (see Wynn 2020, chapter six)\n\nInterestingly, perhaps inheriting the Wittgenstein stress on practice,\nsome philosophers working on religion today place greater stress on\nthe meaning of religion in life, rather than seeing religious belief\nas primarily a matter of assessing an hypothesis (see Cottingham\n2014).\n",
