    "main_text": "Dialectical Argument and the Art of Dialectic || The Uses of Dialectic and Dialectical Argument\n8.3 The Uses of Dialectic and Dialectical Argument\n\nAn art of dialectic will be useful wherever dialectical\nargument is useful. Aristotle mentions three such uses; each merits\nsome comment.\n8.3.1 Gymnastic Dialectic\n\nFirst, there appears to have been a form of stylized argumentative\nexchange practiced in the Academy in Aristotle\u2019s time. The main\nevidence for this is simply Aristotle\u2019s Topics,\nespecially Book VIII, which makes frequent reference to rule-governed\nprocedures, apparently taking it for granted that the audience will\nunderstand them. In these exchanges, one participant took the role of\nanswerer, the other the role of questioner. The answerer began by\nasserting some proposition (a thesis: \u201cposition\u201d\nor \u201cacceptance\u201d). The questioner then asked questions of\nthe answerer in an attempt to secure concessions from which a\ncontradiction could be deduced: that is, to refute\n(elenchein) the answerer\u2019s position. The questioner was\nlimited to questions that could be answered by yes or no; generally,\nthe answerer could only respond with yes or no, though in some cases\nanswerers could object to the form of a question. Answerers might\nundertake to answer in accordance with the views of a particular type\nof person or a particular person (e.g. a famous philosopher), or they\nmight answer according to their own beliefs. There appear to have been\njudges or scorekeepers for the process. Gymnastic dialectical contests\nwere sometimes, as the name suggests, for the sake of exercise in\ndeveloping argumentative skill, but they may also have been pursued as\na part of a process of inquiry.\n8.3.2 Dialectic That Puts to the Test\n\nAristotle also mentions an \u201cart of making trial\u201d, or a\nvariety of dialectical argument that \u201cputs to the test\u201d\n(the Greek word is the adjective peirastik\u00ea, in the\nfeminine: such expressions often designate arts or skills, e.g.\nrh\u00eatorik\u00ea, \u201cthe art of rhetoric\u201d).\nIts function is to examine the claims of those who say they have some\nknowledge, and it can be practiced by someone who does not possess the\nknowledge in question. The examination is a matter of refutation,\nbased on the principle that whoever knows a subject must have\nconsistent beliefs about it: so, if you can show me that my beliefs\nabout something lead to a contradiction, then you have shown that I do\nnot have knowledge about it.\n\nThis is strongly reminiscent of Socrates\u2019 style of\ninterrogation, from which it is almost certainly descended. In fact,\nAristotle often indicates that dialectical argument is by nature\nrefutative.\n8.3.3 Dialectic and Philosophy\n\nDialectical refutation cannot of itself establish any proposition\n(except perhaps the proposition that some set of propositions is\ninconsistent). More to the point, though deducing a contradiction from\nmy beliefs may show that they do not constitute knowledge, failure to\ndeduce a contradiction from them is no proof that they are true. Not\nsurprisingly, then, Aristotle often insists that \u201cdialectic does\nnot prove anything\u201d and that the dialectical art is not some\nsort of universal knowledge.\n\nIn Topics I.2, however, Aristotle says that the art of\ndialectic is useful in connection with \u201cthe philosophical\nsciences\u201d. One reason he gives for this follows closely on the\nrefutative function: if we have subjected our opinions (and the\nopinions of our fellows, and of the wise) to a thorough refutative\nexamination, we will be in a much better position to judge what is\nmost likely true and false. In fact, we find just such a procedure at\nthe start of many of Aristotle\u2019s treatises: an enumeration of\nthe opinions current about the subject together with a compilation of\n\u201cpuzzles\u201d raised by these opinions. Aristotle has a\nspecial term for this kind of review: a diaporia, a\n\u201cpuzzling through\u201d.\n\nHe adds a second use that is both more difficult to understand and\nmore intriguing. The Posterior Analytics argues that if\nanything can be proved, then not everything that is known is known as\na result of proof. What alternative means is there whereby the first\nprinciples of sciences are known? Aristotle\u2019s own answer as\nfound in Posterior Analytics II.19 is difficult to interpret,\nand recent philosophers have often found it unsatisfying since (as\noften construed) it appears to commit Aristotle to a form of apriorism\nor rationalism both indefensible in itself and not consonant with his\nown insistence on the indispensability of empirical inquiry in natural\nscience.\n\nAgainst this background, the following passage in Topics I.2\nmay have special importance:\n\nIt is also useful in connection with the first things concerning each\nof the sciences. For it is impossible to say anything about the\nscience under consideration on the basis of its own principles, since\nthe principles are first of all, and we must work our way through\nabout these by means of what is generally accepted about each. But\nthis is peculiar, or most proper, to dialectic: for since it is\nexaminative with respect to the principles of all the sciences, it has\na way to proceed.\n\n\nA number of interpreters (beginning with Owen 1961) have built on this\npassage and others to find dialectic at the heart of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophical method. Further discussion of this issue would take us\nfar beyond the subject of this article (the fullest development is in\nIrwin 1988; see also Nussbaum 1986 and Bolton 1990; for criticism,\nHamlyn 1990, Smith 1997).\n",
