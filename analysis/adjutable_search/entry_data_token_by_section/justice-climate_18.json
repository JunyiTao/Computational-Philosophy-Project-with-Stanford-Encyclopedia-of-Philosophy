    "main_text": "Justice and Climate Policies || Geoengineering\n7.3 Geoengineering\n\nOne additional climate policy needs also be mentioned, namely\n\u201cgeoengineering\u201d the climate system, either by extracting\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Carbon Dioxide Removal) or by\nseeking to block the sun\u2019s rays (Solar Radiation Management).\nThese raise a host of ethical issues.\n\nOne concern is that some forms of geoengineering can have harmful\nside-effects, ones that can harm already vulnerable people (a point\nwhich takes us back to\n Section 7.1).\n For example, some forms of solar radiation management may affect the\nmonsoon season in India (Jamieson 2014: 220).\n\nA second challenge is that while they may constitute a response to\nclimate change in some sense, some geoengineering policies (like Solar\nRadiation Management), do not tackle other greenhouse-gas related\nproblems like ocean acidification, whereas mitigation policies would\n(Jamieson 2014: 220).\n\nA related concern is that geoengineering policies are unnecessary\nbecause other less risky policies (like mitigation) should be\nadopted.\n\nA fourth problem concerns the political legitimacy of decisions to go\nahead with geoengineering. Geoengineering policies can have\nwide-ranging impacts on many countries and so it would be problematic\nfor some to engage in it unilaterally (Jamieson 2014: 222\u2013224).\nIf they are to be legitimate such world-shaping policies would stand\nin need of an inclusive decision-making process that is global in\nscope.\n\n(For rich discussions of the ethical issues surrounding geoengineering\nsee further Gardiner [2010; 2011: chapter 10], Jamieson [2014:\n219\u2013227] and, from a Confucian perspective, Wong [2015].)\n",
