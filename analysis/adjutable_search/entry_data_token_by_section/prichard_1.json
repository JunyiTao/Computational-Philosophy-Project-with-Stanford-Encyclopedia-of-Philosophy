Prichard\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n\n[All simple page references from now on will be to the MacAdam 2002\nedition of Prichard\u2019s work.]\n\nPrichard starts where many moral philosophers never tread: from an\naccount of what an act is. For him, an act is the origination of a\nstate of affairs. That is, to act is to originate a state of affairs.\nThe agent is the originator.\n\nWhat makes an act, so conceived, either right or wrong? Prichard holds\nthat the rightness of an act is \u2018constituted\u2019 by a\ncombination of two things:\n\nthe nature of the state of affairs originated, and\nwhat Prichard calls \u2018a definite relation\u2019 in which the\nagent stands to himself or to others, that relation forming part of\nthe actual situation in which he has to act.\n\n\nWhat this means is that a right act is made right by such a\ncombination of features. An example might be that of an act made right\nby being the origination of a certain change, say, the educating of a\nyoung person, and the relation between the agent and that person, say,\nhis being her parent. However Prichard is pretty catholic about what\nis to count as a relation, since he allows common humanity to count as\nsuch: \u2018the obligation not to hurt the feelings of another\ninvolves no special relation of us to that other, i.e. no relation\nother than that of our both being men, and men in one and the same\nworld\u2019 (13). So a \u2018definite\u2019 relation need not be a\n\u2018special\u2019 relation.\n\nThere is a question what Prichard meant to exclude by his claim about\nwhat constitutes the rightness of an act. One thing he definitely\nmeant to exclude was that an act can be made right merely by the\ngoodness of its consequences. He argues (216\u201317) that this alone\ncannot be sufficient to constitute an act as right. Take an act whose\nconsequence will be an increase in someone\u2019s patience, which is\ngood. If that someone is oneself, one has a duty to do it, Prichard\nclaims; if it is someone else, one also has a duty to act in that way\nbut it is a different duty. So the mere goodness of the consequence is\ninsufficient to render an act a duty. We need also to know what the\nrelevant \u2018definite relation\u2019 is.\n\nAs it stands, however, all this is compatible with the view that the\nrightness of an act is (at least capable of being) constituted by this\ncombination:\n\n\n\n1.*\nthe value of the state of affairs originated, and \n\n2.\na definite relation.  \n\n\nBut in my view this reading of Prichard is wrong; it would involve two\nmistakes. The first, less subtle but still enticing, is to suppose\nthat the value of the state of affairs originated is at least part of\nwhat we would now call the \u2018ground\u2019 of the relevant duty\n\u2013 part of what makes the action a duty. The second, more subtle,\nis to suppose that the phrase \u2018state of affairs\noriginated\u2019 refers to the consequences of the action rather than\nto the nature of the action itself. I will comment on the first of\nthese supposed mistakes immediately, and on the second later.\n\nOne might be forgiven for thinking that Prichard is a sort of\nagent-relative consequentialist. He says that \u2018unless the effect\nof an act were in some way good, there would be no obligation to\nproduce it, i.e. the goodness of the thing produced is a\npresupposition of the obligation to produce it\u2019 (2). And he says\nthat a moral principle specifies two things, (a) a good thing which\nthe action will produce and (b) a definite relation\u2026\u2019\n(4). And in his most famous published article he writes \u2018At best\nit can only be maintained that there is this element of truth in the\nUtilitarian view, that unless we recognized that something which an\nact will originate is good, we should not recognize that we ought to\ndo the action\u2019 (10). I take it, however, that it is one thing to\nspecify as part of the ground something that is good, and another to\nsay that its goodness is itself part of the ground, and that\nPrichard\u2019s choice of the word \u2018presupposition\u2019 was\nwell advised. (Not all necessary conditions for the rightness of an\nact are parts of the ground for that rightness; consider the role of\nthe fact that there is nothing else that one should be doing instead.)\nAnd I would offer in support of this reading the following sentence\nfrom the same paper: \u2018we do not come to appreciate an obligation\nby an argument, i.e. by a process of non-moral thinking, and in\nparticular we do not do so by an argument of which a premiss is the\nethical but not moral activity of appreciating the goodness either of\nthe act or of a consequence of the act, i.e. our sense of the\nrightness of an act is not a conclusion from our appreciation of the\ngoodness either of it or of anything else\u2019 (13\u201314). Note\nthe words \u2018a premiss\u2019 in this sentence.\n\nWhy did Prichard reject all such appeals to value? I think his main\npoint is similar in style to the main \u2018argument\u2019 of\nBerkeley\u2019s Principles \u00a73. \u2018Suppose we ask ourselves\nwhether our sense that we ought to pay our debts or to tell the truth\narises from our recognition that in doing so we would be originating\nsomething good \u2026 We at once and without hesitation answer\n\u201cNo\u201d\u2019 (10). But he does try to support this claim by\nargument. For instance, it might be held that the reasoning that runs\n\u2018This would be the repayment of a debt, and one which I\nvoluntarily incurred; so I ought to do it\u2019 is actually\nenthymematic, and properly runs \u2018This would be the repayment of\na debt, and one which I voluntarily incurred; such a result would be\ngood; so I ought to do it\u2019. But Prichard says that there is\nnothing much wrong with the original reasoning, and that the expanded\nversion is actually worse, since it appeals to an unsound principle,\nthat what is good ought to be. The principle is unsound because the\nidea of \u2018ought to be\u2019 does not make sense; what makes\nsense is \u2018I ought to do it\u2019. But we can only derive\n\u2018I ought to do it\u2019 by means of a principle that what is\ngood ought to be, and another that if something ought to be, then we\nought to do whatever would have it as a consequence. But these\nprinciples require us to think of the good as somehow imperatival\n(nowadays we would say \u2018deontic\u2019), because otherwise there\nwould be no explanation of our ability to extract an\n\u2018ought\u2019 from a \u2018good\u2019 \u2013 and nobody\nthinks of the good as imperatival in that way. Further, it does not\nfollow that if some state of affairs would be good, and I am able to\nbring it about by acting in some way, then I ought to act in that way.\nSuppose, for instance, that it would be good if you gave money to a\nhospital, and that you would do this if I wrote you a letter asking\nyou to make some contribution. Does it follow that I ought to write\nyou a letter? Not at all. What follows is not even that my writing you\na letter would be good. (Prichard rejects the very notion of the\n\u2018instrumentally good\u2019.) All that we get is that my writing\nyou a letter is something that would have a good result, which is just\nwhat we had at the beginning.\n\nSo much for Prichard\u2019s views about what makes acts right. He\nfurther held that every act that is right is of a type (specified as\nabove) such that all acts of that type are right. At least, this is\nhow he expressed himself early in his career. Later, he came to\nrealize that this was incautious. We may have one act that is right,\nand which is of such and such a type, and which (as he would have\nsaid) is made right by being of that type, but where there could be\nanother act of that type which is not right, because it is also of\nanother type which is more important, as it were, and which makes the\nact either not a duty, or even plain wrong. So what he came to say was\nthat if an act is right, it is of a type such that all acts of that\ntype make a claim on the agent \u2013 a claim which may however be\ndefeated by a greater claim made on the agent to avoid acting in that\nway. Either way round, Prichard is not a particularist. Wherever an\nact is right, according to him, there is a principle at work.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that in order to appreciate the rightness\nof the act, one must appeal to the principle. Prichard\u2019s view is\nquite the contrary. The main thrust of his famous article is the claim\nthat \u2018the sense of obligation to do, or of the rightness of, an\naction of a particular kind is absolutely underivative and\nimmediate\u2019 (12). To come to recognize that an act is a duty, one\nneed only concentrate on the relevant non-moral facts, facts about the\nstate of affairs that one will, if successful, originate (including\nany consequences) and facts about the relations in which one stands\nhere to others and to oneself (e.g. that one borrowed the money and\npromised to return it by the end of the week). Then, by an act of\nspecifically moral thinking, one recognizes that those facts together\nmake a claim on one to respond in a specific way, and that the claim\nmade is stronger than any competing claim thrown up by other features\nof the situation. Again, \u2018Suppose we come genuinely to doubt\nwhether we ought, for example, to pay our debts \u2026 The only\nremedy lies in actually getting into a situation which occasions the\nobligation, or \u2013 if our imagination be strong enough \u2013 in\nimagining ourselves in that situation, and then letting our capacities\nof moral thinking do their work\u2019 (20).\n\nBut Prichard also supposes that if we ask why a feature that grounds\nan obligation does so, for example why the fact that I borrowed the\nmoney means that I ought to pay it back, all we can really do is to\noffer a principle, e.g. \u2018because I ought to pay anything I\nowe\u2019 (4). If we then go on to ask for a reason for the\nprinciple, there is nothing left to be said. But this is not because\nthere is no reason for the principle; it is because the principle\n\u2018includes its reason, the reason becoming explicit when the\nprinciple is properly expressed\u2019 (ibid.). It is when we\nhave lost our sense of the truth of the principle itself, so\nconceived, that \u2018the only remedy lies\u2019 in exposing\nourselves to a real or imaginary case. \u2018We first recognize the\nparticular obligation and then by reflecting on it discover the\nprinciple, i.e. formulate to ourselves that general character of the\nact which renders it, or any act like it, an obligation\u2019\n(5).\n\nThis process, then, enables one to discern a moral principle, one that\nsays that all acts of a specified type (that is, which are the\norigination of some specified sort of state of affairs), and whose\nagents stand in some specified relation either to others or to\nthemselves, are such that there is a claim on those agents to act in\nthat way, this claim being grounded in the specified nature of the act\nand/or the relevant relation. Knowing this principle might be of some\nuse. But if one comes to doubt the principle, just gazing at it will\nnot restore one\u2019s confidence in it, no matter how searching\none\u2019s gaze. Nor will it help to try to infer the principle from\nsomething else; \u201cthe remedy lies not in any process of general\nthinking\u201d (20). To recover one\u2019s sense of its truth, one\nneeds to put oneself into a situation of the relevant sort, or at\nleast to imagine oneself in such a situation, if one\u2019s\nimagination is powerful enough, and see whether the sense of\nobligation arises or not.\n",
