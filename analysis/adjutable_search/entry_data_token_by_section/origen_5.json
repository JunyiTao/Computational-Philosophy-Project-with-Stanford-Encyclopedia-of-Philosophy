    "main_text": "The Work of Christ\n7. Conclusion\n\nBy convention Origen is a \u201cChristian Platonist of\nAlexandria\u201d. In fact, his native city was only intermittently\nhis place of residence; on the other hand, his intellectual home\nthroughout his life was one in which Plato was never his compatriot\nbut an honoured guest. There is no doubt that he knew the works of the\ngreat Athenian intimately, and credited him at times with more than a\nsuperficial grasp of the highest truths. Nevertheless, no Greek\nphilosopher possessed for him the authority that he accorded to the\nscriptures; Plato was only the most prominent of the dead pagans who\nassisted him in the exegesis and harmonisation of this infallible\ntext. The work in which Origen makes most frequent reference to Plato,\nhis reply to Celsus, as noted above, is also the one in which he\nasserts that Christ takes flesh in the written word, disclosing\nmysteries that no human intellect has fathomed without revelation\n(Cels. 4.15). He was never troubled, as a mediaeval schoolman\nmight be, by a conflict between ecclesiastical dogma and the best\nthought of the ancients, because the Word who taught the ancients from\nafar is, for him, the daily shepherd of the Church.\n",
