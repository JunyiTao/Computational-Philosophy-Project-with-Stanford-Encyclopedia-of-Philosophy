    "main_text": "A Neo-Romantic Definition\n8. A Neo-Romantic Definition\n\nHis own preferred view is neo-Romantic and\nintentionalistic\u2014perhaps surprisingly, since Beardsley opposes\nRomanticism and intentionalism in the philosophy of art on every other\nfront. A work of art is defined as\n\n\neither an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of\naffording an experience with marked aesthetic character or\n(incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of\narrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity. (APV:\n299)\n\n\nThe first disjunct is the more important one; it says that\nsomething\u2019s a work if it\u2019s an artifact, \u201can\narrangement of conditions\u201d, that was intended by its creator to\nbe capable of providing an experience with non-negligible aesthetic\ncharacter. It\u2019s important to realize what\u2019s not being said\nhere. First, the definition doesn\u2019t say that a work of art is\nintended to provide (or be capable of providing) a full-blown\naesthetic experience. Only \u201can experience with marked aesthetic\ncharacter\u201d is required. Second, the definition doesn\u2019t say\nthat a work of art doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t have a utilitarian\nfunction, in the everyday sense of the term. A work of art could be a\nchair that\u2019s many times simply sat in, for example. Third, the\ndefinition doesn\u2019t say that the primary intention behind the\ncreation of the artifact is an aesthetic one. The primary intention\nbehind the creation of a religious icon, for example, could be to\nbring worshipers closer to God. What makes such an icon a work of art,\nhowever, is not that intention\u00a0but another one: the\nintention that it be capable of affording viewers an experience with\nmarked aesthetic character. How marked this character must be\nisn\u2019t specified, but that may be all to the good. As the exact\nextension of \u201cwork of art\u201d is somewhat indefinite, so is\nthe extension of \u201cartifact created with the intention of being\ncapable of affording an experience with marked aesthetic\ncharacter\u201d. If the extensions of the two are the same or very\nnearly so, and the objects in the \u201cgray areas\u201d, the areas\nnot definitely within or without the extension of the two, are also\nthe same or very nearly so, then so much the better for the\ndefinition.\n\nThe second part of the definition picks up those objects that\ndefinitely are works of art\u00a0but were created in a mechanical,\nalmost an assembly-line fashion, or as just another instance of its\nkind. Some beautiful vases may fall into the first class, and many\nmedieval icons into the second. To make sure that the extension of the\ndefiniens matches that of the definiendum, the\nsecond disjunct of the definition is needed.\n\nWhy accept the definition? For several reasons, Beardsley thinks.\nFirst, a definition\n\n\nchosen for a role in aesthetic theory should mark a distinction that\nis\u2026 significant for aesthetic theory\u00a0(APV: 299),\n\n\nand Beardsley\u2019s does. Second,\n\n\nin selecting key terms for aesthetic theory we ought to stay as close\nas convenient to ordinary use\u00a0(APV: 300).\n\n\nNot everyone\u2019s use of a term needs to be captured in fashioning\na definition, which would be impossible in any case with a term as\nelastic and tendentiously used as \u201cwork of art\u201d.\nBeardsley\u2019s definition has the merit of capturing\n\n\nreasonably well a use that has been prominent for some centuries and\nstill persists quite widely today, outside the speech and writing of\nor about the avant-garde. (APV: 300)\n\n\nIn other words, Beardsley\u2019s definition captures the ordinary\nextension of a term. The fact that it may not capture the extension of\na term as used by the avant-garde\u2014who may claim that Waltina\nWeber\u2019s arthritis is a work of art\u2014doesn\u2019t count\nagainst it to any appreciable extent. Third, a definition of\n\u201cwork of art\u201d\n\n\nshould be of the greatest possible utility to inquirers in other\nfields besides aesthetics\u2014fields to which aesthetics itself\nshould (sometimes) be thought of as a support and underpinning. (APV:\n304)\n\n\nThe fields Beardsley has in mind, more than any other, are art history\nand anthropology. Fourth and last, a definition of \u201cwork of\nart\u201d should \u201cconceptually link\u2026 art and the\naesthetic\u201d (APV: 312). That Beardsley\u2019s does in spades,\ndirectly defining art in terms of the aesthetic as it does.\n\nWhat can be said against the definition? Complaints could come from\nany number of quarters, but most would focus on its being too narrow.\nThe definition simply doesn\u2019t get the extension of \u201cwork\nof art\u201d right, it would be argued, because of its antiquated\nfocus on the aesthetic. Developments in art, art criticism, and the\nphilosophy of art in the twentieth century have shown the independence\nof art and the aesthetic, with the result being a\nmarked divergence in their extensions. Pieces of driftwood and stones,\nfor example, have been displayed in museums and catalogued as works of\nart. Artifactuality thus isn\u2019t a necessary condition of art. And\nmany objects obviously have no aesthetic intention behind them, and\nyet are works of art. Duchamp\u2019s famous Fountain, for\nexample, a urinal turned upside down, is a work of art, but it was\nmanufactured in a factory. No aesthetic intention stands behind it, it\nhas no aesthetically interesting properties, and it doesn\u2019t\nbelong to a kind whose members are normally created with an aesthetic\nintention. Literally thousands of objects of the same sort can be\nfound in museums and galleries today. They\u2019re listed in museum\ncatalogues, discussed in art history texts, and analyzed in journals\nof art criticism. If they aren\u2019t works of art, what are\nthey?\n\nBeardsley never explicitly responded to this objection, but he\nwouldn\u2019t be fazed. The objection assumes that if an object is\ndisplayed in a museum\u2014a fine arts museum, not a history museum\nor any other sort of museum\u2014or if an art historian or art critic\ndiscusses an object, then it must be a work of art, or at least that\nthere\u2019s very strong reason to think that it\u2019s a work of\nart. That it\u2019s some reason to think so Beardsley wouldn\u2019t\ndeny; but that it\u2019s necessarily a strong or definitive reason he\ncertainly would. Fine arts museums sometimes display the working\nclothes or palettes of artists, but they aren\u2019t works of art.\nThis has to do with the fact that even if the primary business of a\nmuseum is to display art, it has other functions as well,\u00a0and\njustifiably extends its mission in various ways. Palettes and working\nclothes are an extension in one direction, for one reason, but pieces\nof driftwood and stones are a different extension, in a different\ndirection, and for a different reason. They\u2019re\ndisplayed\u2014in small numbers\u2014because they\u2019re\naesthetically interesting, just as most works of art are. And\nDuchamp\u2019s Fountain might be displayed not because\nit\u2019s a work of art\u2014although presenting an upside\ndown urinal to a museum might be regarded as a small joke, and thus a\nminor work of art\u2014but because (a) art, as a human endeavor, has\na history, (b) museums, as a social institution, have a duty to\nacknowledge and exhibit that history, and (c) Fountain, as a\nwell-chosen memorial to the joke, has a place in that history. Much\nthe same can be said about the remarks of art critics and art\nhistorians respecting Fountain and its many kin. If such\nobjects are called \u201cworks of art\u201d for a long enough period\nof time, by a large enough group of people, the term can easily\nacquire a secondary sense or a number of derivative senses. Beardsley\nis probably alluding to as much in his remarks about the use of the\nterm by or about the avant-garde. But that the appearance of\ncoatracks, old shoes, broken sticks, and such like in museums, or that\nmention of them in books and journals by art critics and historians\nmeans that \u201cart\u201d in the primary sense is wrongly defined\nin terms of artifactuality and aesthetic intention\u2014that\nhasn\u2019t been shown, he would say. A perfectly good explanation of\nsuch phenomena can be provided in accord with a relatively traditional\ndefinition of art.\n",
