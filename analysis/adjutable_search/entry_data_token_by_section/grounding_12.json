    "main_text": "Why Think There is Grounding? || Skeptical responses\n3.2 Skeptical responses\n\nSome are skeptical of grounding. A distinction can be drawn between\nwhat we might call first-wave and second-wave\ngrounding skepticism (see Koslicki 2020, though she uses different\nterminology). First-wave skepticism is characterized by a general\nconcern about the intelligibility of the notion. Daly (2012) argues\nthat the notion of grounding doesn\u2019t really make sense. In a\nsimilar spirit, Hofweber (2009) states that grounding theorists are\nguilty of engaging in a problematic form of metaphysics\u2014while\nthey make use of perfectly ordinary terms such as priority,\nfundamental and ultimately, they use them in a\ndistinctively non-ordinary, metaphysical way. (For non-skeptical\nrejoinders to first-wave skepticism, see Audi 2012b and Raven 2012.)\nSecond-wave skeptics, by contrast, generally grant that the notion of\ngrounding is coherent, but they think that it doesn\u2019t belong in\nour theoretical toolkit in any case, as the arguments in favor of\npositing grounding aren\u2019t persuasive. What unites second-wave\nskeptics is a shared sense that grounding theorizing is simultaneously\nundermotivated and overreaching.\n\nWith respect to the unity argument, Koslicki (2015) and J. Wilson\n(2016a) challenge the second premise, arguing that, even if the\nmetaphysical relations (or some sub-collection thereof) are\nsubstantially unified, this on its own wouldn\u2019t give us a good\nreason to posit a generic relation of grounding as a unifier. J.\nWilson (2014) challenges the first premise as well, arguing that there\nis a class of metaphysical relations, what she calls the\nsmall-g grounding relations, that are neither\nterminologically, formally, nor metaphysically unified. Relatedly,\nTurner (2016) describes various differences in the way certain kinds\nof grounding claims behave, ultimately distinguishing between two\nforms of grounding, dependence-grounding and\nrealization-grounding. (For non-skeptical rejoinders to these\nchallenges, see Raven 2017, and Schaffer 2016b.)\n\nRoughly speaking, monists claim that there is ultimately just\none core type of grounding, while pluralists claim that there\nare different types and no core type. It\u2019s important to note\nthat being a pluralist about grounding doesn\u2019t necessarily make\nyou a grounding skeptic, at least given how we understand the usage of\nthe terms. It\u2019s true that some pluralists, as we\u2019ve just\nseen, are skeptics. But not all of them are. For example, Fine\n(2012a), a proponent of grounding if anyone is, stresses the\ndifferences between various forms of grounding, rejecting the idea\nthat they are unified in a way that might motivate positing a genetic\nform of grounding. Just what might make it fitting to call one\npluralist view a version of skepticism about grounding and another\npluralist view non-skeptical instead is perhaps worth further thought.\n(For further discussion of monism and pluralism about grounding, see\nBerker 2018, Cohen 2020, Griffith 2014, Litland 2018b, Rettler 2017,\nand Richardson 2020 and 2021.)\n\nAs for the explanation argument, Kovacs (2017) objects to both the\nseparatist and unionist versions set out above. For example, Kovacs\nargues that, with respect to the former version of the argument,\nworldly relations such as necessitation taken together with facts\nabout their relata, rather than determinationG,\nback ontic explanations. Relatedly, Miller and Norton (2017) propose\nan explanation of why you might judge, say, that {Beijing} exists\nbecause Beijing exists that doesn\u2019t appeal to grounding. And\nNorton and Miller (2019) propose an account of the truth conditions\nfor statements of such explanations that doesn\u2019t appeal to\ngrounding.\n\nReturning to the priority argument, there are two types of priority\ncases to consider: cases in which the prior fact is fundamental, and\ncases in which neither the prior nor posterior facts are fundamental.\nJ. Wilson (2014, 2016a) develops a proposal according to which a\nprimitive notion of fundamentality plays the direction-fixing role in\npriority cases of the first type. And this primitive notion and other\ngrounding-free considerations (e.g., modal considerations) play the\ndirection-fixing role in cases of the second type. (For non-skeptical\nrejoinders, see Cameron 2016 and Raven 2017.)\n\nWhat about additional theoretical applications of grounding? Returning\nto the application to physicalism discussed above, J. Wilson (2014)\npoints out that, as there are importantly different approaches to\ngrounding (ones disagreeing about, e.g., how grounding interacts with\nreduction, necessitation, and real definition\u2014see\n \u00a74),\n the bald grounding claim that the physical grounds the mental\ndoesn\u2019t on its own speak to even very basic characteristics of\nthe mental-physical interface. A natural response, however, is to\nsimply work in this context with an approach to grounding that is\nfleshed out to a degree that such issues aren\u2019t left open\n(deRosset 2020; cf. J. Wilson 2016a). Still, questions about the\ntheoretical utility of grounding-theoretic formulations of physicalism\nremain, including whether the nothing-over-and-above notion central to\ninitial characterizations of physicalism is best captured in terms of\ngrounding (Melnyk 2016; J. Wilson 2016b).\n\nTo take another example, Sider (2011: Ch. 8; 2020) questions whether\ngrounding is apt to play the role of a level connector. Intuitively,\nthe world has an overarching structure where entities occupy different\nlevels of reality. One way to formulate the view that grounding is a\nlevel connector is this: different levels of reality are connected to\none another by virtue of grounding relations between facts\ncharacterizing occupants of these levels. With this in mind, consider\nthe fundamental physical level and a higher level, one occupied by\ncities. The grounding theorist might claim that these levels are\nconnected partly in virtue of the fact that some quantum-mechanical\nfact, Q, grounds the fact, N, that New York is a\ncity. But Sider asks: what is the grounding profile of this grounding\nfact? On the face of it, [Q grounds N] itself is\nungrounded. Roughly speaking, the worry is this: provided that any\nentity that an ungrounded fact concerns is fundamental in nature, it\nfollows that New York is a fundamental entity. Hence, it may be that\nin using grounding to explain how different levels of reality are\nconnected, we get unacceptable results about which entities are\nfundamental. (See\n \u00a74.3\n for more on fundamentality; for an overview of views according to\nwhich facts like [Q grounds N] are grounded, see\nLitland 2020.)\n\nFor a different skeptical take on grounding related to its theoretical\napplications, Della Rocca (2014) and Tallant (2018: Ch. 5) argue, very\nroughly, that various metaphysical claims (e.g., material objects\npersist over time and truths have truthmakers) are false, as these\nclaims are ultimately about what grounds what but there is no\ngrounding.\n",
