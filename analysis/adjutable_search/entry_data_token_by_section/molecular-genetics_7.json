The unconnectability objection rests on the assumption\nthat classical genetics took the relationships between genes and\nphenotypic traits to be simple one-to-one relationships. But classical\ngeneticists knew better.  Consider what Sturtevant, one of Morgan's\nstar students and collaborators, had to say about genes and eye\ncolor:\n\n\n\nThe difference between normal red eyes and colorless (white) ones in\nDrosophila is due to a difference in a single gene. Yet red\nis a very complex color, requiring the interaction of at least five\n(and probably of very many more) different genes for its\nproduction. And these genes are quite independent, each chromosome\nbearing some of them. Moreover, eye-color is indirectly dependent upon\na large number of other genes such as those on which the life of the\nfly depends. We can then, in no sense identify a given gene with the\nred color of the eye, even though there is a single gene\ndifferentiating it from the colorless eye. So it is for all\ncharacters \u2026 (my emphasis, quoted from Carlson 1988, p. 69)\n\n\n\nThis quotation suggests that the relationship between gene and\neye-color in classical genetics exhibited the same complexity that\nRosenberg discussed at the molecular level (compare this quotation to\nthe passage from Rosenberg 1985 quoted in section 3.2). According to\nthis critique of the unconnectability objection, it is not the case\nthat genotype-phenotype relationships appear simple and uniform at\nthe level of classical genetics and complicated and dis-unified at the\nmolecular level. The situation appears similarly complex at both levels\nof analysis (Waters 1990).\n\n\nClassical genetics nevertheless finds a simple way to explain\ntransmission phenomena by appealing to the difference principle,\naccording to which particular differences in particular genes\ncause particular differences in phenotypic traits in\nparticular contexts (see section 2.1). Sturtevant alludes to this\nprinciple in the first sentence of the quotation above and again in\nthe emphasized clause. So the question arises, can this relationship\nbe captured at the molecular level? And the answer is yes. The\ndifferences used by classical geneticists to explain inheritance\npatterns have been routinely identified at the molecular level by\ncontemporary geneticists.\n\n\nAccording to this critique, the gory details objection also fails.\nThis objection claims that biologists cannot improve upon\nthe classical explanations of transmission phenomena by citing\nmolecular details. The cytological level allegedly provides the best\nlevel of explanation because explanations at this level uniformly\naccount for a wide range of cases that would look heterogeneous from a\nmolecular perspective. Consider Kitcher's formulation of this\nobjection. Kitcher believes that to explain is to unify (1989). It\nfollows that the best explanation of a class of phenomena is the\nexplanation that accounts for the class in a uniform way. Kitcher\nclaims meiosis exemplifies this kind of situation. The uniformity of\npair-separation processes is evident at the cytological level, but is\nlost in the gory details at the molecular level where the process\n\u201cmay occur because of the action of electromagnetic forces or\neven of nuclear forces \u2026\u201d (Kitcher 1984, p. 350). But\nit is unclear what Kitcher could have in mind. The molecular\nmechanisms underlying the pairing and separation of chromosomes are\nremarkably uniform in creatures ranging from yeast to human beings; it\nis not the case that some involve electromagnetic forces and others\ninvolve nuclear forces.  Kitcher's claim that \u201cit is easy\nto think of examples in which the separation is effected by the action\nof gravity\u201d has no basis in what molecular biologists have\nlearned about the pairing and separation of chromosomes.\n\n\nMeiosis is an unpromising candidate to illustrate the idea that what\nappears uniform at the level of classical genetics turns out to be\nheterogeneous at the molecular level. But this idea is illustrated by\nother genetic phenomena. Consider the phenomenon of genetic dominance.\nIn classical genetics, all examples of complete dominance are treated\nalike for the purposes of explaining transmission phenomena. But\ncontemporary genetics reveals that there are several very different\nmechanisms underlying different instances of dominance. According to\nKitcher's unificationist theory of scientific\nexplanation, the classical account of dominance provides an objectively\nbetter basis for explaining transmission phenomena because it provides\na more unified organization of the phenomena. But this would imply that\nthe shallow explanations of classical genetics are objectively\npreferable to the deeper explanations provided by the molecular theory\n(Waters 1990). \n",
