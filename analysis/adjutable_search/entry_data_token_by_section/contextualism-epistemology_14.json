    "main_text": "Further Arguments for EC, with some Non-Contextualist Responses || Fallibilism and Concessive Knowledge Attributions\n5.1 Fallibilism and Concessive Knowledge Attributions\nIt is plausible to suppose that, if knowing requires believing on the basis of evidence that entails what is believed, we have hardly any knowledge at all. Hence the near-universal acceptance of fallibilism (Cohen 1988, 91). Hence too the significance of \u2018concessive knowledge attributions\u2019 (CKAs) (Rysiew 2001)\u2014i.e., sentences of the form \u2018S knows that p, but it is possible that q\u2019 (where q entails not-p). To many, utterances of such sentences sound very odd:\nIf you claim that S knows that P, and yet you grant that S cannot eliminate a certain possibility in which not-P, it certainly seems as if you have granted that S does not after all know that P. To speak of fallible knowledge, of knowledge despite uneliminated possibilities of error, just sounds contradictory. (Lewis 1996, 549)\nIf Lewis is correct in supposing that the relevant utterances are merely \u201covert, explicit\u201d statements of fallibilism (ibid., 550), their seeming incoherence suggests that, contrary to our everyday epistemic pretensions, \u201cknowledge must be by definition infallible\u201d after all (ibid., 549).\nLewis\u2019 own attempt \u201cto thread a course between the rock of fallibilism and the whirlpool of skepticism\u201d (ibid., 566) involves embracing EC: We may say with the infallibilist that S knows that p iff S\u2019s evidence eliminates \u201cevery\u201d possibility in which not-p (ibid., 551). But since \u2018every\u2019 is restricted to a particular conversational domain (ibid., 553\u2013554), and since certain not-p possibilities will be \u201cproperly ignored\u201d in a given situation, we preserve our intuitive non-skepticism.\nJason Stanley (2005a) attempts to block Lewis\u2019 move to EC and defends fallibilism against the worry that concessive knowledge attributions are incoherent. According to Stanley, CKAs are not just odd-sounding: in most cases, they are simply false. But this does not impugn fallibilism. If the odd-sounding utterances Lewis cites stated the fallibilist idea, the latter portion thereof (\u2018S cannot eliminate a certain possibility in which not-p\u2019, e.g.) would expresses the thought that the subject\u2019s evidence does not entail that p\u2014hence, the negation every proposition contrary to p.[22] According to Stanley, however, this is not the best reading of such statements of epistemic possibility. Stanley reads the cited part of CKAs\u2014\u2018S cannot eliminate a certain possibility in which not-p\u2019\u2014as saying this: it is possible for S that not-p. And he reads that statement as saying: what S knows [versus, as per fallibilism, S\u2019s evidence] does not, in a manner that is obvious to S, entail the denial of not-p. (Cf. DeRose 1991, 1999; and Hawthorne 2004, 24\u201328.) The latter claim does contradict the first part of CKAs, which says that p is known; for p does obviously entail the denial of not-p. So the sentences Lewis cites are self-contradictory. But they do not capture the fallibilist idea after all.\nDougherty and Rysiew (2009) offer a different strategy for accounting for CKAs\u2019 oddity while both protecting fallibilism and avoiding EC. While they grant that the latter portion of CKAs express epistemic possibility, they recommend thinking of what is epistemically possible for a subject in terms of those things which his evidence, rather than what he knows, does not rule out. (Dougherty and Rysiew take a person\u2019s evidence, roughly, to be their basic data. While wishing to stay neutral as to just what comprises this, they deny the Williamsonian thesis (2000) that one\u2019s evidence just is one\u2019s knowledge.) On this view, CKAs express, as Lewis assumes, precisely the fallibilist idea. According to Dougherty and Rysiew, however, their oddity poses no problem for fallibilism, and so does not motivate EC, as that oddity can be explained pragmatically.\nWhich, if either, of these responses to the problem Lewis sets is correct is a matter of dispute. (Other recent contributions on CKAs include Dodd 2010, Littlejohn 2011, Dougherty and Rysiew 2011, Hawthorne 2012, Worsnip 2015, and Colgrove and Dougherty 2016.) But there are at least these two ways in which a non-contextualist could counter Lewis\u2019 argument.\n",
