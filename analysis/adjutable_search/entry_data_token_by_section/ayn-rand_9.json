    "main_text": "Social-Political Philosophy || Rights, Capitalism, the Trader Principle, and Government\n3.1 Rights, Capitalism, the Trader Principle, and Government \n \u201cForce and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun\nbegins\u201d (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting\nsomeone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The\nnon-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle\nguiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society,\nor in the state of nature.  It is also the basic political principle:\n\u201cno man may initiate the use of physical force against\nothers. \u2026 Men have the right to use physical force only\nin retaliation and only against those who initiate its\nuse\u201d (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only\nindividuals in their interactions with each other, but also,\nimportantly, the government. Rand\u2019s ideal society is a society\nof independent individuals who respect each other\u2019s rights to\nlife, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially\nand spiritually.  They live, in her words, by \u201cthe trader\nprinciple\u201d.  Individual rights and the trader principle are both\ndictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to\nthink and act for our \u201cproper survival\u201d (1961b: 31). Both\nare based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as\nends in themselves, not mere means to others\u2019 ends. But what\nexactly is a right? \n\n\n\u201cRights\u201d are a moral concept\u2014the concept that\nprovides a logical transition from the principles guiding an\nindividual\u2019s actions to the principles guiding his relationship\nwith others\u2014the concept that preserves and protects individual\nmorality in a social context\u2014the link between the moral code of\na man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics.\nIndividual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral\nlaw. (1963b: 92). \n\n\nAgain,\n\nA \u201cright\u201d is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a\nman\u2019s freedom of action in a social context. (1964a 93).\n\n\nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to\nactions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only\nthrough the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence,\nall natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others\u2019\nnon-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain\ngoods or outcomes.[9]\nThe fundamental right is the right to life:\nthe right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper\nto a human being.\n\n\nThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the actions\nrequired by the nature of a rational being for the support, the\nfurtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such\nis the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness.). (1963b: 93) \n\n\nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and\nspeak) on one\u2019s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness\nis the right to pursue goals for one\u2019s own fulfillment; the\nright to property is \u201cthe right to gain, to keep, to use and to\ndispose of material values\u201d (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body\ndichotomy, the common dichotomy between \u201chuman rights\u201d and\nthe right to property is a false one, because to own one\u2019s life\nis to own one\u2019s actions and their fruits (1962b:\n 91).[10]\n Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues,\nso there is between these rights: a government that violates human\nrights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating\nthe right to freedom of expression by banning \u201cobscene\u201d\nspeech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners\nof the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other\nlibertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes\nstate regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state,\nwhether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and\nliberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for\nwanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the\nspiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the\nmaterial or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides\nthus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need\nto be free in both realms to be free in either.\n\nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need\nthem for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take\nactions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such\nas blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living\noff others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for\nourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most\nobviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the\nfreedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no\nfreedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that\n\u201cThe right to life means\u2026the freedom to take all the\nactions required by the nature of a rational being for the support,\nthe furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own\nlife.\u201d What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have\nrights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar\n2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we\nvalue our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our\nvery nature we didn\u2019t care whether we lived or died,\ndidn\u2019t care about being forced by the government or other people\nto act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and\ncouldn\u2019t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no\nrights. It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that we don\u2019t have the\nright to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or\nhappiness. As Rand says elsewhere: \n\n\nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which\ncan be exercised without anyone\u2019s permission (Rand 2018 83). \n\n[A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act\non his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,\nuncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.)\n\n\nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of\nthe individual\u2019s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is\nthe position taken here that is compatible with Rand\u2019s\ndeep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government. \n\nAnother criticism of Rand\u2019s theory of rights is that it is\nincompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for\nothers\u2019 rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate\nend of one\u2019s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under\nperfectly realistic scenarios, one\u2019s survival can require one to\nviolate another\u2019s right to life or property. Thus, according to\nthese critics, Rand\u2019s defense of rights suffers from the same\nunresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic\nstrand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack\n1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of\nRand\u2019s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no\nincompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we\u2019ve argued\nabove, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the\ncriticism that the primary reason for respecting others\u2019 rights,\nor exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one\u2019s\neudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in\nthemselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and\nliving accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary\nreason for respecting people\u2019s rights.\n Everything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals\nhave rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a\ngovernment. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests\nthat rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a\n\u201cformulated morality\u201d (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand\nmeans by \u201cformulated morality\u201d: a written, or at least\nexplicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of\nRights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine\u2019s Rights of\nMan?? But aren\u2019t there many societies \u2013 perhaps a majority\n\u2013 that don\u2019t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at\nleast individuals\u2019 basic rights against each other and the government,\nand many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize\nthese rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case,\nRand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier\nview that:\n\n\nThe source of man\u2019s rights is not divine law or congressional\nlaw, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are\nconditions of existence required by man\u2019s nature for his proper\nsurvival (\u201cGalt\u2019s Speech,\u201d Rand 1961a: 182).\n\n\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have in the absence of a government, she says, is\nobjectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been\nviolated (2018: 211). A \u201cproper government,\u201d in her words,\n\u201cis the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical\nforce under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined\nlaws\u201d (1963a: 128).\n\nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this\nview. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of\nnature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you\ndomesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do\nyou have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or\nstealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday\nare strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior\nspear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate\u2019s main point is that\nbecause individuals in his scenarios don\u2019t have a government, they\ndon\u2019t have objectively defined laws, and because they don\u2019t have\nobjectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are\nunclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot\ntalk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or\nwhy Crusoe and Friday can\u2019t talk things over and decide on the\nboundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any\ncommon sense, he\u2019ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose\nthat they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and\nyou might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of\nyou. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is in principle impossible to do\nso. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a\npeaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with\nobjective laws that define the boundaries of their rights \u2013 as,\nin fact, they do in Rand\u2019s Atlantis: Galt\u2019s Gulch. Their\nview seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked\nfor 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a\nBill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis\neach other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a\ndispute. But we don\u2019t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many\nscholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from\nvarious countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in\norder to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws\n(Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at\nlibertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law\nMerchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also\ncreated by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of\nany European government.\n\nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only\nsystem compatible with our rational nature and with the right of\nindividuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b),\nthat is, \n\n\nlaissez-faire capitalism\u2014with a separation of state and\neconomics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation\nof state and church. (1961b, 1964a) \n\n\nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for\ncorrupting both state and market institutions, just as political\nregulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever\nit exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation\ncreates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians\nand religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas\nShrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the\neconomic, political, and moral corruption spawned by\n\u201ccronyism\u201d between government and business.\nLaissez-faire capitalism is \u201cthe only [social] system\nthat bans force from social relationships\u201d domestically and\nabroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand\n1966a). Rand\u2019s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical\nthan the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly\ndifferent both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists,\nand the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for\ndiscussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does,\nof course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating\nwidespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by\nthe fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In\nAtlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business\npeople who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking\nfavors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of\n\u201cthe aristocracy of pull\u201d (\u201ccrony\ncapitalists\u201d, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only\nthrough such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has\nalways prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a\nshort period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a\nlaissez-faire system than any other society before or since,\nbut that capitalism remains an unknown ideal.  Some critics complain,\nhowever, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always\nrecognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world\u2014business\nleaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and\nrestrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006).\n\nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire\ncapitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and\nundermine people\u2019s ability to lead their own lives,\nbecause laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a\nwell-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a\ncorollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a\nsociety, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent\nconcentration of power in a few hands. \n\nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person\u2019s\nrational interests and another\u2019s, hence that there is no\nconflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57\u201365). Is it true,\nhowever, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do,\nit follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both\nquestions is \u2018no\u2019. We think that whenever two or more\npeople have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for\nconflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show\notherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for\nthe same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no\nconflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate\nhas earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been\ngiven the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is\na good thing, because the business would close if only one person\napplied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the\nbusiness wasn\u2019t doing very well).\n\nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational\nand gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because,\nsay, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the\ntwo candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses\none over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a\nconflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the\nfirst possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn\u2019t\ntrace its implications for her thesis that rational interests\ndon\u2019t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally\nqualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on\nfirmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary\nconflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in\ntheir nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to\ncontingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified\npeople. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not\nentail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out,\nneither party has a right to the job.\n\nRand defines government as: \n\n\nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce\ncertain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a:\n125) \n\n\nA proper government is: \n\n\nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under\nobjective control\u2014i.e., under objectively defined law.\n(1963b: 128) \n\n\nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals\nand foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts\nwith the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively\ndefined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his\ncontracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the\n\u201cindirect\u201d use of force, in that he obtains a value from\nanother without that person\u2019s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly,\nthe government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against\nthose who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A\ngovernment that tries to enforce the brother\u2019s keeper\nprinciple\u2014\u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each\naccording to his need\u201d; or that drafts citizens into the armed\nservices or \u201cpublic service\u201d; or that forces them,\ndirectly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered,\nhealthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from\nunlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds\nwith our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in\nourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill\nanyone\u2019s needs for long, because \u201c[t]o deal with men by\nforce is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion\u201d\n(1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and\nthe mind does not function well when forced.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt\u2019s\nGulch, as a \u201cvoluntary association of men held together by\nnothing but every man\u2019s self-interest\u201d, without any formal\norganization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate\ndisagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration.\nGalt\u2019s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never\ncalls it that. In \u201cThe Nature of Government\u201d, however,\nRand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says,\nit is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus,\nwith rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist\ncritics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978),\nhave argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government)\nis not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective\nlegal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long\nand Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and\nenforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries,\nillustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal\nsystem. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand\u2019s own\nprinciple of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as\nthe linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and\n2013b).\n\nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial\nexchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually\nrespectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only\nbasis for a peaceful relationship among countries: \u201cthe trader\nand the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout\nhistory\u201d (1966a: 38).\n\nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To\nlove or admire someone is to \u201cpay\u201d him for the pleasure\none derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)\u2014or, Rand might say in\nthe case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would\nseem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal,\ngiven that the child receives both pleasure and material support from\nthe parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all\nwhen a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of\npain rather than pleasure.\n",
