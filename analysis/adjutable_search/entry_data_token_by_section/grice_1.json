    "main_text": "Defending a dogma\n2. Defending a dogma\n\nGrice and Strawson begin their article with a dissection of the\nvarious ways one can reject a dichotomy and conclude that\nQuine\u2019s rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction is one\nof the more extreme cases: \u201cHe declares, or seems to declare,\nnot merely that the distinction is useless or inadequately clarified,\nbut that it is altogether illusory, that the belief in its existence\nis a philosophical mistake\u201d (Grice & Strawson, 142).\n\nGrice and Strawson deploy a number of arguments against Quine\u2019s\nposition, but the two main ones involve the distinction between an\nutterance meaning something and not meaning anything, and between the\nkind of revision of belief that merely recognize a previous belief as\nfalse and the kind which involves a change of concept, and hence a\nchange in the meaning of a word. These can both be illustrated with\ntheir pair of example sentences:\n\nMy neighbor\u2019s three year old child understands\nRussell\u2019s theory of types.\nMy neighbor\u2019s three year old child is an adult.\n\n\nThey claim that it is not difficult to understand what someone would\nmean by uttering (1), and it is fairly clear what it would take to\npersuade someone that (1) is not false, as seems initially evident.\nBut in the case of (2), they argue, in effect, that with further\ninvestigation one would either conclude that the speaker was using\nfamiliar words to express new concepts, or else would conclude that\nnothing at all was being said. No attempt will be made here to\nadjudicate the dispute with Quine, who would reject both of these\ndichotomies (new concepts/old concepts, something said/nothing said)\nas well. But the reader should note that the crucial claims are that\nsomeone who asserts (2) is either asserting it with a meaning other\nthan the standard conventional one, or with no meaning at all. A\nfurther elaboration of their claims depends therefore on elucidating\nthe notion of the meaning of an utterance, and Section 4 will explore\nGrice\u2019s account of this notion further.\n",
