    "main_text": "\n\nIt is no secret that G. W. Leibniz is a difficult philosopher to\nstudy. One central reason for this is that the content of his\nphilosophy is extremely challenging. It involves a range of subtle\ndistinctions and paradoxical theses, such as the denial of causal\ninteraction between substances and the thesis that each substance\nexpresses every other substance in the universe. Just as significant,\nhowever, is the fact that his philosophical corpus is immense,\ncomprising a bewildering array of letters, notes, essays, and larger\nmanuscripts. These writings span a period of over fifty years. Only a\nsmall number of his essays and one philosophical book, the Essais\nde th\u00e9odic\u00e9e, were published during his lifetime.\nNone of his published or unpublished works is considered a magnum\nopus on the order of Spinoza\u2019s Ethics or\nKant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. The complexity of\nLeibniz\u2019s literary remains forces scholars of his thought to\nengage difficult questions: how much continuity is there between\nLeibniz\u2019s treatments of particular topics at different times in\nhis career? On what issues does he attain considered views? Should\ncertain texts be privileged over others in attempting to discern\nLeibniz\u2019s views? Is Leibniz a deeply systematic philosopher who\naddresses a wide range of problems from the perspective of a unified\ntheory, or does he apply his penetrating mind to a series of\nphilosophical problems with little concern for the systematic\ncoherence of his results?\n\nOne important clue for approaching the labyrinth of Leibniz\u2019s\ntexts is a distinction that he draws between esoteric\n(acroamaticus/acroamatique) and exoteric\n(exotericus/exoterique) presentations of his philosophy.\nRoughly speaking an esoteric presentation is one that is fully\nrigorous while an exoteric or \u201cpopular\u201d presentation is\nless rigorous but easier to understand, which is more appropriate for\na general audience. Leibniz distinguishes between these two modes of\npresentation early in his career and explicitly classifies many of his\n(later) published works such as the Essais de\nth\u00e9odic\u00e9e as exoteric. This distinction is clearly\nrelevant to the questions raised in the previous paragraph. If it is\npossible to distinguish between esoteric and exoteric texts, then the\nmost precise statements of Leibniz\u2019s considered views are likely\nto be found in the esoteric texts. Similarly, if Leibniz\u2019s\ntreatments of an issue in different works seem to be in tension with\none another, one potential explanation of the discrepancy is that one\ntreatment is esoteric and the other is exoteric.\n\nIn order to plausibly use Leibniz\u2019s distinction between the\nesoteric and the exoteric as an interpretive tool one must have a more\ndetailed account of how he understands the distinction. This itself is\nnot an easy matter, however, as Leibniz\u2019s remarks on the\ndistinction also require interpretation. One challenge for\nunderstanding his views on this issue is that some of his most\nexplicit remarks on it are written quite early in his career. Although\nit is clear that he does not abandon the distinction later in his\ncareer one should not uncritically assume that his views on the\ndistinction do not change over time. A second challenge is that\nLeibniz typically does not identify his exoteric texts as exoteric\nwithin those texts. For example, if you were to focus exclusively on\nwhat Leibniz writes in the Syst\u00e8me nouveau de la nature et\nde la communication des substances, aussi bien que de l\u2019union\nqu\u2019il y a entre l\u2019\u00e2me et le corps (New\nsystem of the nature and communication of substances, and of the union\nof the soul and body)\u2014the first public presentation of his\nphilosophy\u2014you would have no idea that it is a popular\npresentation of is views. It is only in letters to certain of his\ncorrespondents that Leibniz identifies this text as exoteric. And when\nhe does identify a text as exoteric he often provides few details\nabout exactly what this is supposed to involve. A third challenge for\nunderstanding Leibniz\u2019s views is that he does not use the terms\n\u201cesoteric\u201d and \u201cexoteric\u201d univocally.\nSometimes these words are used to distinguish different kinds of\ncontent that a philosophy might have; other times they signify\ndifferent modes of presenting one\u2019s philosophy. It will be\ncrucial to disambiguate these terms as we proceed (see Melzer 2014 for\nan insightful account of different kinds of esoteric and exoteric\nwriting that have been utilized throughout the history of\nphilosophy).\n\nThe notion of an exoteric Leibnizian philosophy is often associated\nwith Bertrand Russell\u2019s influential interpretation of Leibniz.\nRussell infamously claimed that the difference between Leibniz\u2019s\npublic and private writings is so significant that they effectively\ncomprise two distinct philosophies: a theologically imbued fantasy\ndesigned to please royalty, and his true philosophy, derived from\naustere logical principles, that he revealed to a select few of his\ncorrespondents (Russell 1945). In recent decades Russell\u2019s view\nhas been rejected; nearly everyone agrees that there is much more\ncontinuity between Leibniz\u2019s public and private works than\nRussell was willing to admit (see Curley 1972 for a critique of\nRussell\u2019s view). And as we will see, the distinction between the\nesoteric and the exoteric does not involve a simple classification of\nhis works depending on whether or not they were published. In order to\nattain a more accurate understanding of Leibniz\u2019s distinction\nbetween the esoteric and the exoteric we must turn to his views on the\nideal form that metaphysics should take.\n",
