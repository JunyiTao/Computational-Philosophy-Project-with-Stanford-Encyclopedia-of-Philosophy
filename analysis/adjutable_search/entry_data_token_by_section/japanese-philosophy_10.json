    "main_text": "Historical Periods of Philosophical Development and Interaction || Medieval Philosophy (late 12th through 16th centuries)\n4.2 Medieval Philosophy (late 12th through 16th centuries)\n\nThe medieval period witnessed the destabilization of the social,\npolitical, and religious order. The luxuries and amusements of court\nlife had become so attractive that many aristocrats abandoned their\nfar-flung estates to spend more time in the capital, entrusting their\nwealth-generating domains to the hands of their stewards, the\nsamurai (\u201cthose who serve\u201d). Eventually, the\nsamurai took over the domains for themselves, then fought each other\nfor national dominance until the Minamoto were victorious in 1185,\nestablishing Japan\u2019s first military government or shogunate in\n1192. To protect its vulnerable position, it centered its operations\nin Kamakura, leaving the court and the emperor in Kyoto. The political\ninstability and the attendant economic upheaval were exacerbated by an\nunusually devastating period of natural disasters, pestilence, and\nfamine. When personal survival was at stake, the complex theories and\npractices of Shingon and Tendai Buddhism were of little solace to most\npeople. Furthermore, the financial success of the monastic centers had\nled to institutional corruption and a popular theory was that Buddhism\nhad entered its final Degenerate Age (mapp\u014d) in which\nteachings were lost, could no longer be understood, and enlightenment\nno longer attained. Tendai\u2019s Mt Hiei, which had been a magnet\nfor many of Japan\u2019s brightest and most gifted thinkers, started\nto lose some of its most talented monks as they left the mountain and\neventually advanced new Buddhist philosophies resulting in the rise of\nnew religious sects, most notably Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren.\n4.2.1 The Strategy of Selection\n\nAmong the founders of the so-called Kamakura New Religions, the Pure\nLand philosopher H\u014dnen (1133\u20131212) expressed a seminal idea\nthat keynoted the greater movement. (See the entry on \n Japanese Pure Land Philosophy, section 3.) \nA noted Tendai master of Mt Hiei\u2019s texts\nand practices, both esoteric and exoteric, he was frustrated with his\npersonal failure to find any liberating insight. As a Tendai\nphilosopher, however, he recognized one teaching that could lead to a\nnew philosophical approach, namely, the holographic paradigm of the\nwhole-in-every-part. Tendai had used it to go from simplicity to\nreveal ever greater levels of complexity, but might it now also be\nreversed? Could it not be used to pare complexity down to a minimal\nparticularity that would still be all-inclusive? The key would not be\nto set out to embrace the whole, but instead to select one\nthing\u2013\u2013one practice, one teaching, one text\u2014and to\nfocus on that, realizing that by the holographic paradigm ultimately\nnothing would be lost. By that line of thought, H\u014dnen came to his\nidea of selection (senjaku or senchaku) as\nthe guiding strategy for his engaged philosophy. By engaging a\nproperly selected single teaching or practice, one does not abandon\nthe holistic view but instead discovers it as inscribed in that\nparticular. That philosophical modus operandi became the guiding\nprinciple for all three of the major branches of Kamakura-period\nphilosophies: Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren.\n\nSelection involves a decision about what to select and a methodology\nfor engaging the selection as a single bodymind focus. Pure Land\nthinkers like H\u014dnen and Shinran (1173\u20131263) concentrated on\nthe mythos of the Vow of Amida Buddha to aid those who could not\nattain liberating insight by their own devices or efforts and so\nneeded assistance from outside. Since the theory of the Degenerate Age\nsuggested all people were in that state of personal helplessness,\nAmida\u2019s Vow was intended to serve everyone. For Nichiren\n(1222\u20131282), the creator of the Nichiren School, the despair of\nthe Degenerate Age was again a consideration, but in his\ninterpretation, the second half of the Lotus Sutra was\nwritten specifically for those times and should be the sole focus of\nselection. For philosophers like D\u014dgen (1200\u20131253), the\nfounder of Japanese S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhism, the theory of the\nDegenerate Age was irrelevant. As a result, he selected a single\npractice he considered central to all Buddhist traditions from the\noutset: the state of bodymind achieved in seated meditation\n(zazen) under the guidance of a master. (See the entry on \n Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy.)\n\nThe biographies of the Kamakura philosophers suggest that most often\ntheir selection process arose from a sudden intuition, or a statement\nfrom an inspiring text or teacher, after a frustrating period of trial\nand error. Since most of them had originally trained at Mt Hiei and\nbecause they were deviating from the Tendai Buddhist\nestablishment\u2019s doctrines and practices, they were accused of\nheresy, which could lead to a penalty of exile or even execution. So\nthey devised ex post facto philosophical justifications for\ntheir choices, often explaining how their new selective teachings and\nmethods were consistent with tradition and demonstrating, by using a\nholographic argument, that nothing significant was really being\nomitted from the orthodox tradition. The situation resulted in some of\nthe most creative medieval theories of metaphysics, philosophical\nanthropology, and philosophies about the structures of experience.\n\nAs for engaging the selection wholeheartedly in a focused bodymind\nactivity, H\u014dnen, Shinran, and Nichiren all emphasized\n\u201centrusting faith\u201d (shinjin) as the Way that\ndissolves the ego-self into a focal object. For the Pure Land\nphilosophers, the object is the fulfillment of Amida Buddha\u2019s\nVow as expressed in the phrase of the nenbutsu (namu\namida butsu \u201cI take refuge in Amida Buddha\u201d), for\nNichiren the power of the Lotus Sutra (especially as further\nholographically particularized in the recitation of its title). In\nsuch cases the model of faith is one of internal relations and\nimmersion in immanence rather than one of external relations and faith\nin a transcendent reality. In the case of D\u014dgen\u2019s Zen, the\nengagement in zazen is characterized by a state of\nwithout-thinking (hishiryo) in which \u201cbodymind drops\naway.\u201d In that state of full engagement with as-ness\n(inmo or nyoze, how phenomena are before they are\nstructured by concepts), one is at the prereflective point that is in\nitself without meaning, but is the basis from which meaning is\ngenerated in any context. That is the \u201ceye for the truth\u201d\n(sh\u014db\u014dgen) that is the provenance (yue) of\nboth words and praxis. Thus, in D\u014dgen\u2019s decision to make\nseated meditation his item of selection, he focused on how to find the\nexperiential point from which full engagement can originate. (Kasulis\n2018, 218\u201334)\n\nOne benefit of the Kamakura innovations was that their singular\npractices were readily accessible to anyone, even the uneducated. Over\nthe centuries, the Kamakura New Religions gradually became the most\npopular forms of Buddhism in Japan. At the same time, the\nphilosophical justifications for those minimalized practices,\nthe metapraxes, were often highly sophisticated and have continued to\nattract the further reflection of some of the best philosophical minds\nin Japan over the centuries. For example, some twentieth-century\nJapanese philosophers found points of contact between Western\nexistential philosophers\u2019 responses to Angst and the\nmedieval Buddhist philosophers\u2019 responses to the anguish of the\nDegenerate Age.\n4.2.2 Muromachi Aesthetics\n\nWith the decline of the cloistered Heian court, the nature of Japanese\naesthetics underwent a change as dramatic as that of religious\nphilosophies. After the fall of the Minamoto\u2019s shogunate in\nKamakura and the takeover by the Ashikaga, the new shogunate moved its\nheadquarters to Muromachi in Kyoto in 1338. The reestablishment of\nrelations with China precipitated an economic boom and revival of the\nChinese-influenced arts in the capital, but the prosperity was\nshort-lived. Triggered by a dispute over shogunal succession, open\nwarfare broke out in Kyoto, ultimately involving most of the major\nregional military lords from around the country. The capital was\nleveled and the \u014cnin War (1467\u20131477) ended in stalemate but\nnot before the coffers of the shogunate and the court were almost\ncompletely depleted. Upon returning to their home regions, local wars\ncontinued and the entire country entered the Period of Warring\nDomains, lasting for over a century. Without the isolation of a\ncloistered community of aristocratic courtiers, the former aesthetic\ncategories were superseded by new ones suggestive of retreat or\nwithdrawal: withdrawal from the cultured and elegant to the plainness\nof the rustic (wabi), withdrawal from the outward glitter to\nthe lonely, neglected, and isolated (sabi), and withdrawal\nfrom the surface to the quiet, mysterious depths\n(y\u016bgen). These became central categories in the new art\nforms of tea ceremony, poetry, n\u014d drama, and landscaped gardens.\n(See the entry on \n Japanese Aesthetics, sections 3\u20135.)\n",
