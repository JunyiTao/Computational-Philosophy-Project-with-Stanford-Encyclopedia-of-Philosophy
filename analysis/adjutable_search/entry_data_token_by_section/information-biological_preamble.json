    "main_text": "\nSince the 1950s, the concept of information has acquired a\nstrikingly prominent role in many parts of biology. This enthusiasm\nextends far beyond domains where the concept might seem to have an\nobvious application, such as the biological study of perception,\ncognition, and language, and now reaches into the most basic parts of\nbiological theory. Hormones and other cellular products through which\nphysiological systems are regulated are typically described as\nsignals.  Descriptions of how genes play their causal role in\nmetabolic processes and development are routinely given in terms of\n\u201ctranscription\u201d, \u201ctranslation\u201d, and\n\u201cediting\u201d. The most general term used for the processes by\nwhich genes exert their effects is \u201cgene expression\u201d. The\nfates of cells in a developing organism are explained in terms of\ntheir processing of \u201cpositional information\u201d given to them\nfrom surrounding cells and other factors. Many biologists think of the\ndevelopmental processes by which organisms progress from egg to adult\nin terms of the execution of a \u201cdevelopmental\nprogram\u201d. Other biologists have argued for a pivotal role for\ninformation in evolution rather than development: John Maynard Smith\nand Eors Szathm\u00e1ry (for example) suggest that major transitions in\nevolution depend on expansions in the amount and accuracy with which\ninformation is transmitted across generations. And some have argued\nthat we can only understand the evolutionary role of genes by\nrecognizing an informational \u201cdomain\u201d that exists\nalongside the domain of matter and energy. \nBoth philosophers and biologists have contributed to an ongoing\nfoundational discussion of the status of this mode of description in\nbiology. It is generally agreed that the sense of information isolated\nby Claude Shannon and used in mathematical information theory is\nlegitimate, useful, and relevant in many parts of biology. In this\nsense, anything is a source of information if it has a range\nof possible states, and one variable carries information\nabout another to the extent that their states are physically\ncorrelated. But it is also agreed that many uses of informational\nlanguage in biology seem to make use of a richer and more problematic\nconcept than Shannon\u2019s. Some have drawn on\nthe teleosemantic tradition in philosophy of mind to make\nsense of this richer concept.  Other theorists have countered that Shannon\u2019s correlational conception of information is richer than it looks.\nA minority tradition has argued that the enthusiasm for information\nin biology has been a serious theoretical wrong turn, and that it\nfosters naive genetic determinism, other distortions of our\nunderstanding of the roles of interacting causes, or an implicitly\ndualist ontology. However, this sceptical response is fading, with key\nsceptics coming to accept a modest but genuine role for informational\nconcepts in the life sciences. Others have taken the critique seriously but\ntried to distinguish legitimate appeals to information from misleading\nor erroneous ones.\n",
