    "main_text": "Presupposition || Presupposition and dynamic semantics of connectives\n3.1 Presupposition and dynamic semantics of connectives\n\nContext plays an important role in presupposition. A sentence like\n (13)\n presupposes that John is late. But put this sentence in a context\nproviding this very information, as in\n (14),\n and the presupposition disappears. That John is late is\nasserted in\n (14),\n not presupposed.\n\n(13) Mary\nknows that John is late\n(14) John is\nlate and Mary knows that he is late.\n\n\nStalnaker 1973 takes\npresupposition to be based on presumed common knowledge. Uttering a\nsentence like\n (13)\ntakes for granted that it is common knowledge that John is\nlate. In this sense,\n (13)\n requires the context of utterance to be such that this common\nknowledge is in place. In contrast,\n (14)\n lacks such a requirement simply because the first conjunct in\n (14)\n asserts what the second conjunct takes for granted. The crucial\nassumption made by Stalnaker is that interpretation is incremental in\nthe following sense: for a sentence of the form [\\(S\\)1 and\n\\(S\\)2], the interpretation of \\(S\\)2 occurs in a context which\nis already updated with \\(S\\)1. Schematically:\n\n(15)\n\n\\({C}[{S1 \\textrm{ and } S2}] = ({C}[{S1}])({S2})\\)\n\n\nStalnaker\u2019s interpretation of the scheme in\n (15)\n is pragmatic: when we encounter a series of clauses in discourse, we\ninterpret these clauses in light of a context that is already\ninformed by the interpretation of previous clauses. This idea of\nincremental interpretation is simple yet powerful and it makes perfect\nsense for complex discourses with conjunctive interpretations (for\ninstance, coordinations with and and simple sequences of\ndeclarative sentences). Since the conjuncts in a conjunction have\nassertoric force, they can be used to update the context in order to\ncreate a new local context. The problem is though that presuppositions\ndo not just disappear in conjunctive environments. Just like\n (14),\n (16) also lacks the requirement that it should be common\nknowledge that John is late. But here the first disjunct does not have\nassertoric force (see, for instance, Schlenker 2009 for discussion).\nIt is not obvious what kind of pragmatic rule could account for the\nlack of a presupposition in\n (16).\n\n(16) Either\nJohn is not late or Mary does not know that he is late. \n\n\nExamples like\n (16)\n call into question the value of an incremental interpretation schema\nlike\n (15).\n On top of that,\n (15)\n is rather presumptuous in its assumptions of how interpretation\nproceeds. Asserting a clause with propositional content \\(p\\) does\nnot automatically make it common knowledge that \\(p\\). Rather, such\nan assertion should be regarded as a proposal to make\n\\(p\\) common knowledge. Whether or not \\(p\\) becomes common\nground is dependent on the willingness of the other interlocutors to\naccept the proposition (for instance, by not objecting against the\nassertion). In other words,\n (15)\n seems ill-suited for capturing the pragmatics of (the dynamics of)\ninformation flow.\n\nA possible way out is to regard\n (15)\n not as a pragmatic rule, but rather as a semantic rule, couched in a\ndynamic notion of interpretation. This was most prominently proposed\nin Heim 1983b, following Karttunen 1973. Karttunen distinguishes\nglobal contexts, which are contexts relative to which the\ncurrent sentence is evaluated, from local contexts, which are\ncontexts relative to which the current clause (or potentially some\nsub-clausal entity) is interpreted. The idea now is that a rule like\n (15)\n can express the semantics of and. In\n (15),\n \\(C\\) is the global context. A crucial part of the semantics of\nconjunction is that the local context for \\(S\\)2 is the update of\nthe global context with \\(S\\)1. Thus, there is no presupposition in\n (14)\n simply because of the dynamic semantics of and. All\nwe need to account for the lack of presupposition in\n (16)\n is to come up with a semantics for disjunction in which the local\ncontext for the second disjunct has already been updated with the\nnegation of the first disjunct; see Krahmer and Muskens 1996 for such\nan account that also captures interactions between (double) negation\nand anaphora.\n\nTo make things more concrete let us assume that contexts are sets of\npossible worlds and that an update \\(C[S]\\) of \\(C\\) with a simple\nclause \\(S\\) is \\(C\\cap p\\), where \\(p\\) is the propositional\ncontent of \\(S\\): updating \\(C\\) with a clause outputs the\n\\(C\\) worlds in which the clause is true. The rules in\n (18)\n show a Heimian fragment of a dynamic interpretation of the main\npropositional operators in English.\n\n(17)\n\n\\({C}[{\\textrm{not } S1}] = {C}  \\backslash {C}[{S1}]\\)\n\n\\({C}[{S1 \\textrm{ and } S2}] = ({C}[{S1}])[{S2}]\\)\n\n\\({C}[{\\textrm{If }S1, \\textrm{ then } S2}] = ({C}[{\\textrm{not }S1}]) \\cup ({C}[{S1}])[{S2}]\\)\n\n\\({C}[{S1 \\textrm{ or } S2}] = {C}[{S1}] \\cup ({C}[{\\textrm{not }S1}])[{S2}]\\)\n\n\nSome question the explanatory value of such a dynamic interpretation\nin the sense that the framework fails to account for why there appear\nto be no natural language expressions that encode a minimal variation\nof\n (17),\n where the local context of the second disjunct \\(S\\)2 is \\(C[S1]\\)\ninstead of \\(C[\\textrm{not }S1]\\), or where the local context of\n\\(S\\)1 is based on an update with \\(S\\)2, or where there are no\nlocal contexts at all as in\n (18)\n (see, for instance, Soames 1989).\n\n(18)\n\n\\({C}[{S1 \\textrm{ or } S2}] = {C}[{S1}] \\cup {C}[{S2}]\\)\n\n\nIn light of such criticisms, there has been a recent resurgence of\nstatic approaches to presupposition projection, such as the pragmatic\napproaches of Schlenker (2008, 2009), Chemla (2008, Other Internet\nResources) and the semantic (trivalent) approaches of George (2008)\nand Fox (2008). As Rothschild points out though, there is a route to\nmaking a semantics along the lines of\n (17)\n explanatory. To do so, one has to show that permissible dynamic\ninterpretations of connectives share certain properties. As Rothschild\n(2011) shows, an\nexplanatory and empirically adequate dynamic treatment of\npresupposition is possible if we assume that context change potentials\nadhere to certain principles of definedness. Let us assume that\n\\(C[S]\\) (for a simple clause \\(S\\)) is only defined if and only if\nany presupposition of \\(S\\) is true in all the worlds in \\(C\\).\nThe rules in\n (17)\n determine the definedness conditions for complex statements. For\ninstance, according to\n (17)\n [not S] is only undefined in \\(C\\) if \\(S\\) is undefined in\n\\(C\\). Rothschild\u2019s insight is that we can constrain dynamic\ninterpretation by constraining the resulting definedness\nconditions.\n",
