    "main_text": "Freedom of Conscience\n3. Freedom of Conscience\n\nEverything that Bayle wrote on religious toleration is either a\ndefence or an elaboration of the following argument, which first\nappeared in Bayle\u2019s General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s\nHistory of Calvinism (1682):\n\n\n[I]f the true religion has some right to oppress others, then every\nreligion has this same right, provided that it is persuaded that it is\nGod\u2019s True Church. But it is false and impious that every\nreligion has the right to oppress, so it follows that God has not\ngiven to his Church any way other than persuasion and peaceful\ninstruction to bring people to the true faith. Consequently, Christian\nPrinces do not have any greater or lesser right to torment people over\nmatters of religion. (OD II: 105)\n\n\nThis argument was originally intended as an objection to\nMaimbourg\u2019s argument that Catholic Sovereigns have the right to\noppress Protestants in their realms, but not vice versa, and therefore\nthe persecution of Calvinists by Louis XIV was just, while the\npersecution of Catholics elsewhere was unjust. Despite this narrow\noriginal purpose, Bayle\u2019s claim eventually grew in scope to\nbecome the foundation of two of Bayle\u2019s most well-known theses:\nthe universal right to freedom of conscience, and the necessity of\nreligious toleration.\n\nBayle\u2019s fullest and clearest defence of the right to freedom of\nconscience appears in his sequel to the General Critique of\nMaimbourg\u2019s History of Calvinism, namely the New\nLetters by the Author of the General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s\nHistory of Calvinism (1685). In the Ninth Letter, Bayle expands\nand defends the first part of the argument quoted above, namely\nthat\n\n\nif the true religion has some right to oppress others, then every\nreligion has this same right, provided that it is persuaded that it is\nGod\u2019s True Church.\n\n\nBayle reports that this claim was considered an \u201cimpious\nparadox\u201d by many readers. Bayle defends the claim in two steps.\nThe first step is to demonstrate that individuals have the right and\nthe duty to espouse any proposition that appears true to them after a\ncareful examination. The second step is to demonstrate that everyone\nhas the right and the duty to act on the basis of whatever apparent\ntruths they have espoused. In other words, individuals have the right\nand the duty to form and to act on the basis of conscience.\nFollowing a Medieval tradition, Bayle understood conscience to be\nfirst, a set of intuited moral truths (synderesis), and\nsecond, practical judgments made on the basis of these moral truths\n(conscientia).\n\nBayle employs an example to illustrate these steps of his argument for\nfreedom of conscience. He imagines a master who leaves his home for a\nlong time in the care of a servant, and who orders the servant not to\nallow anyone to enter the home unless they produce a certificate with\na particular insignia: anyone who produces such a certificate must be\ngiven entry, but anyone who lacks the certificate must be turned away.\nThe example is an analogy meant to represent the human mind\u2019s\nrelationships to God and the truth. God has left minds in the care of\nGod\u2019s servants, individual humans. We have been ordered by God\nto allow into our minds\u2014to believe\u2014only those propositions\nthat bear the criterion of truth, which Bayle always considered to be\na certain clarity and distinctness, or \u201cevidence\u201d as he\ncalled it. In order to obey God, we must accept all evident\npropositions as true and reject all non-evident propositions as false.\nJust as the servant has the right and duty in the master\u2019s\nabsence to decide what is an authentic certificate and what is not, so\ntoo individual humans have the right and duty to decide what is\nevident and what is not. This is the right and duty to form our\nindividual consciences, to decide what is morally good and true. And\njust as the servant has the right and duty subsequently to act on\ntheir inspection of certificates, so too humans have the right and\nduty to act on the basis of whatever has appeared true to them. This\nis the right and duty to act conscientiously. The Cartesian roots of\nBayle\u2019s epistemology and ethics of belief are clear.\n\nThe problem arises when, for example, the master\u2019s own son\narrives at the home, but lacks the required certificate; or when a\nbandit arrives at the home bearing a certificate that he found or that\nhe forged. In other words, what should we do when the objective truth\ndoes not appear evident, or when falsehoods appear evident to us?\nBayle takes it to be a historical fact that these cases arise\nfrequently, and he answers that we must reject the truth and believe\nthe falsehood:\n\n\n[T]he rights that God has given to the truth depend on a condition\nthat is so absolutely necessary, that in the absence of this condition\none could not render the least homage to the truth without committing\na crime. Since by this condition we can mean nothing other than that\nGod demands that we love and respect the truth provided that we know\nit, it is evident that, if the truth is unknown to us, it loses all\nits rights over us; and that, if error appears to us in the form of\nthe truth, then it acquires all rights over us. For, since it would\ndisplease God if we respected the truth that we thought was a lie,\ntherefore it would also offend him if we did not respect a lie that we\nbelieved was the truth. (OD II: 219)\n\n\nDuring the absence of the master, the servant has a duty to obey the\nmaster\u2019s orders: to admit those with a certificate, and to\nreject those without a certificate. The servant must do due diligence\nto ensure the certificates are authentic. However, if after the\nservant has inspected the certificate, he is convinced that a forged\ncertificate is authentic, or that an authentic certificate is forged,\nthen the servant has no recourse: he must act on his own best judgment\nuntil the master returns. Even though it is objectively bad to allow a\nbandit into the home, nevertheless, if the bandit\u2019s certificate\nis authentic or a compelling forgery, then the servant has the duty to\ngrant the bandit entry into the home. So too, human beings must act on\nthe basis of their individual judgment\u2014their conscience\u2014as\nlong as God is invisible and silent, which God always seems to be. In\nthe master\u2019s absence, the servant is effectively the master. So\ntoo in God\u2019s apparent absence, individual human beings are\nmasters of their own minds and actions, for there is nobody else who\ncan decide for us what is evident and what is not. Evidence, as Bayle\nconceives it, is an inherently individual matter, since it is a kind\nof appearance to an individual mind. Since the individual authority\nover one\u2019s mind and actions is based in a command of God, and\nsince God is a higher authority than any Sovereign, the Sovereign must\nrespect the individual\u2019s freedom to obey God\u2019s commands as\nthey see fit. The Sovereign must respect human autonomy, because it is\nGod\u2019s will. Bayle\u2019s argument for freedom of conscience\nprovides a clear link between Cartesian epistemology and later Kantian\nmoral autonomy.\n",
