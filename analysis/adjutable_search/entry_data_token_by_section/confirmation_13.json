    "main_text": "Bayesian confirmation theories || New evidence, old evidence, and total evidence\n3.5 New evidence, old evidence, and total evidence\n\nLet us go back to a classical HD case, where the (consistent)\nconjunction \\(h \\wedge k\\) (but not \\(k\\) alone) entails \\(e.\\) The\nfollowing can be proven:\n\nSurprising prediction theorem (SP)\n\nFor any \\(e, h, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP\\) such that \\(h \\wedge\nk\\vDash e\\) and \\(k\\not\\vDash e:\\)\n\n\nif \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1,\\) then \\(e\\) relevance-confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) and \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) is a decreasing function\nof \\(P(e\\mid k);\\)\nif \\(P(e\\mid k) = 1,\\) then \\(e\\) is relevance-neutral for \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k.\\)\n\n\n\nFormally, it is fairly simple to show that (SP) characterizes\nrelevance confirmation (see, e.g., Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010, 80;\nH\u00e1jek and Joyce 2008, 123), but the philosophical import of\nthis result is nonetheless remarkable. For illustrative purposes, it\nis useful to assume the endorsement of the principle of total evidence\n(TE) as a default position for the Bayesian. This means that \\(P\\) is\nassumed to represent actual degrees of belief of a rational\nagent, that is, given all the background information available. Then,\nby clause (i) of (SP), we have that the occurrence of \\(e\\), a\nconsequence of \\(h \\wedge k\\) (but not of \\(k\\) alone), confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) provided that \\(e\\) was initially uncertain\nto some degree (even given \\(k\\)). In other words: \\(e\\) must have\nbeen predicted on the basis of \\(h \\wedge k\\). Moreover, again by\n(i), the confirmatory impact will be stronger the more surprising\n(unlikely) the evidence was unless \\(h\\) was conjoined to \\(k\\). So,\nunder TE, relevance confirmation turns out to embed a squarely\npredictivist version of hypothetico-deductivism! As we know, this\nneutralizes the charge of underdetermination, yet it comes at the\nusual cost, namely, the old evidence problem. In fact, if TE is in\nforce, then clause (ii) of (SP) implies that no statement that is\nknown to be true (thus assigned probability 1) can ever have\nconfirmatory import. \n\nInterestingly, the Bayesian predictivist has an escape (neatly\nanticipated, and criticized, by Glymour 1980a, 91\u201392). Consider\nEinstein and Mercury once again. As effectively pointed out by Norton\n(2011a, 7), Einstein was extremely careful to emphasize that the\nprecession phenomenon had been derived \u201cwithout having to\nposit any special [auxiliary] hypotheses at\nall\u201d. Why? Well, presumably because if one had allowed\nherself to arbitrarily devise ad hoc auxiliaries (within\n\\(k\\), in our notation) then one could have been pretty much certain\nin advance to find a way to get Mercury\u2019s data right (remember:\nthat\u2019s the lesson of the underdetermination theorem). But\ngetting those data right with auxiliaries \\(k\\) that were not thus\nadjusted\u2014that would have been a natural consequence had\nthe theory of general relativity been true and it would have been\nsurprising otherwise. Arguably, this line of argument exploits\nmuch of the use-novelty idea within a predictivist framework. The\ncrucial points are (i) that the evidence implied is not a verified\nempirical statement \\(e\\) but the logical fact that \\(h \\wedge k\\)\nentails \\(e\\), and (ii) that the existence of this connection of\nentailment was not to be obviously anticipated at all, precisely\nbecause \\(h \\wedge k\\) and \\(e\\) are such that the latter did not\nserve as a constraint to specify the former. On these conditions, it\nseems that \\(h\\) can be confirmed by this kind of\n\u201csecond-order\u201d (logical) evidence in line with (SP)\nwhile TE is concurrently preserved.\n\nAt least two main problems arise, however. The first one is more\ntechnical in nature. Modelling rational uncertainty concerning logical\nfacts (such as \\(h \\wedge k \\vDash e\\)) by probabilistic means is no\ntrivial task. Garber (1983) put forward an influential proposal, but\ndoubts have been raised that it might not be well-behaved (e.g., van\nFraassen 1988; a careful survey with further references can be found\nin Eva and Hartmann forthcoming). Second, and more substantially, this\nsolution of the old evidence problem can be charged of being an\nelusive change of the subject: for it was Mercury\u2019s\ndata, not anything else, that had to be recovered as having\nconfirmed (and still confirming, some would add) Einstein\u2019s\ntheory. That\u2019s the kind of judgment that confirmation theory\nmust capture, and which remains unattainable for the predictivist\nBayesian. (Earman 1992, 131 voiced this complaint forcefully. Hints\nfor a possible rejoinder appear in Eells\u2019s 1990 thorough\ndiscussion; see also Skyrms 1983.)\n\nBayesians that are unconvinced by the predictivist position are\nnaturally led to dismiss TE and allow for the assignment of initial\nprobabilities lower than 1 even to statements that were known all\nalong. Of course, this brings the underdetermination problem back, for\nnow \\(k\\) can still be concocted ad hoc to have known\nevidence \\(e\\) following from \\(h \\wedge k\\) and moreover\n\\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1\\) is not prevented by TE anymore, thus potentially\nlicencing arbitrary confirmation relations. Two moves can be combined\nto handle this problem. First, unlike HD, the Bayesian framework has\nthe formal resources to characterize the auxiliaries themselves as\nmore or less likely and thus their adoption as relatively safe or\nsuspicious (the standard Bayesian treatment of auxiliary hypotheses is\ndeveloped along these lines in Dorling 1979 and Howson and Urbach\n2006, 92\u2013102, and it is critically discussed in Rowbottom 2010,\nStrevens 2001, and Worrall 1993; also see Christensen 1997 for an\nimportant analysis of related issues). Second, one has to provide\nindications as to how TE should be relaxed. Non-TE Bayesians of the\nimpermissivist strand often suggest that objective likelihood values\nconcerning the outcome \\(e\\)\u2014\\(P(e\\mid h \\wedge k)\\)\u2014can\nbe specified for the competing hypotheses at issue quite apart from\nthe fact that \\(e\\) may have already occurred. Such values would\ntypically be diverse for different hypotheses (thus mathematically\nimplying \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1\\)) and serve as a basis to capture formally\nthe confirmatory impact of \\(e\\) (see Hawthorne 2005 for an argument\nalong these lines). Permissivists, on the other hand, can not\ncoherently rely on these considerations to articulate a non-TE\nposition. They must invoke counterfactual degrees of belief\ninstead, suggesting that \\(P\\) should be reconstructed as representing\nthe beliefs that the agent would have, had she not known that \\(e\\)\nwas true (see Howson 1991 for a statement and discussion, and Sprenger\n2015 for an original recent variant; also see Jeffrey 1995 and Wagner\n2001 for relevant technical results, and Steele and Werndl 2013 for an\nintriguing case-study from climate science).\n",
