    "main_text": "Induction\n7. Induction\n\nGoodman thought that the difference between laws of nature and\naccidental truths was linked inextricably with the problem of\ninduction. In his \u201cThe New Riddle of Induction\u201d (1983,\n[f.p. 1954], 73), Goodman says,\n\nOnly a statement that is lawlike \u2014 regardless of its\ntruth or falsity or its scientific importance \u2014 is capable of\nreceiving confirmation from an instance of it; accidental statements\nare not.\n\n\n(Terminology: P is lawlike only if P is a law if\ntrue.) Goodman claims that, if a generalization is accidental (and so\nnot lawlike), then it is not capable of receiving confirmation from\none of its instances.\n\nThis has prompted much discussion, including some challenges. For\nexample, suppose there are ten flips of a fair coin, and that the\nfirst nine land heads (Dretske 1977, 256\u2013257). The first nine\ninstances \u2014 at least in a sense \u2014 confirm the\ngeneralization that all the flips will land heads; the probability of\nthat generalization is raised from (.5)10\nup to .5. But this generalization is not\nlawlike; if true, it is not a law. It is standard to respond to such\nan example by arguing that this is not the pertinent notion of\nconfirmation (that it is mere \u201ccontent-cutting\u201d) and by\nsuggesting that what does require lawlikeness is confirmation of the\ngeneralization\u2019s unexamined instances. Notice that, in the coin\ncase, the probability that the tenth flip will land heads does not\nchange after the first nine flips land heads. There are, however,\nexamples that generate problems for this idea too.\n\nSuppose the room contains one hundred men and suppose you ask fifty of\nthem whether they are third sons and they reply that they are; surely\nit would be reasonable to at least increase somewhat your expectation\nthat the next one you ask will also be a third son (Jackson and\nPargetter 1980, 423)\n\n\nIt does no good to revise the claim to say that no generalization\nbelieved to be accidental is capable of confirmation. About\nthe third-son case, one would know that the generalization, even if\ntrue, would not be a law. The discussion continues. Frank Jackson and\nRobert Pargetter have proposed an alternative connection between\nconfirmation and laws on which certain counterfactual truths must\nhold: observation of As that are F-and-B\nconfirms that all non-F As are Bs only if\nthe As would still have been both A and B\nif they had not been F. (This suggestion is criticized by\nElliott Sober 1988, 97\u201398.) Lange (2000, 111\u2013142) uses a\ndifferent strategy. He tries to refine further the relevant notion of\nconfirmation, characterizing what he takes to be an intuitive notion\nof inductive confirmation, and then contends that only generalizations\nthat are not believed not to be lawlike can be (in his sense)\ninductively confirmed.\n\nSometimes the idea that laws have a special role to play in induction\nserves as the starting point for a criticism of Humean analyses.\nDretske (1977, 261\u2013262) and Armstrong (1983, 52\u201359, and\n1991) adopt a model of inductive inference that involves an inference\nto the best explanation. (Also see Foster 1983 and 2004.) On its\nsimplest construal, the model describes a pattern that begins with an\nobservation of instances of a generalization, includes an inference to\nthe corresponding law (this is the inference to the best explanation),\nand concludes with an inference to the generalization itself or to its\nunobserved instances. The complaint lodged against Humeans is that, on\ntheir view of what laws are, laws are not suited to explain their\ninstances and so cannot sustain the required inference to the best\nexplanation.\n\nThis is an area where work on laws needs to be done. Armstrong and\nDretske make substantive claims on what can and can\u2019t be\ninstance confirmed: roughly, Humean laws can\u2019t,\nlaws-as-universals can. But, at the very least, these claims cannot be\nquite right. Humean laws can\u2019t? As the discussion above\nillustrates, Sober, Lange and others have argued that even\ngeneralizations known to be accidental can be confirmed by their\ninstances. Dretske and Armstrong need some plausible and suitably\nstrong premise connecting lawhood to confirmability and it is not\nclear that there is one to be had. Here is the basic problem: As many\nauthors have noticed (e.g., Sober 1988, 98; van Fraassen 1987, 255),\nthe confirmation of a hypothesis or its unexamined instances will\nalways be sensitive to what background beliefs are in place. So much\nso that, with background beliefs of the right sort, just about\nanything can be confirmed irrespective of its status as a law or\nwhether it is lawlike. Thus, stating a plausible principle describing\nthe connection between laws and the problem of induction will be\ndifficult.\n",
