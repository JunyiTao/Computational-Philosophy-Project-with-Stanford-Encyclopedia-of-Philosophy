    "main_text": "Diagnosis\n8. Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is the process through which a clinician determines what is\nwrong with a patient who is ill or ailing in some way. Although a\ncritical part of the practice of medicine, it has been relatively\nneglected in the literature of philosophy of medicine particularly in\ncomparison to more statistically-based methods for evaluating evidence\nin other fields (Stanley and Campos 2013). The key philosophical\nissues that arise in this context relate to how such determinations\ncan be made in a manner that is accurate given the high amount of\nuncertainty and complexity often associated with the human condition,\nand hence involve logical, epistemological, and ontological issues.\nThe usual way of proceeding in a clinical setting is to ask the\npatient to articulate what is ailing him or her, and thus to use a\nstandardized reporting format to detail various symptoms which\nrepresent subjective manifestations of the illness or disease. In\naddition, clinicians perform various tests and examinations that allow\nmore objective manifestations or signs to be recorded, such as heart\nrate, blood pressure and count, reflexes, and so on. A perennial\ndebate in the philosophy of medicine is what constitutes symptoms and\nsigns and whether they are in fact distinct, which relates to deeper\nissues about the realism of disease conditions as discussed above\n (Section 2).\n\nThe tricky part of the process is to find a means for mapping these\nsymptoms and signs onto a particular disease condition. Some would\nadvocate that this process is no different than usual methods in\nphilosophy of science for hypothesis generation and testing based on\nevidence, and this type of model fits with what is termed differential\ndiagnosis. Differential diagnosis involves a set of hypothetical\nexplanations for a particular condition which come to be ruled in (or\nout) based on the evidence together with additional data that is\ncollected, hence relying on a form of reasoning via decision nodes or\nalgorithmic pathways (Stanley and Campos 2013). However, the details\nof the rules of reasoning that underlie this sort of process remain\nlargely unarticulated, as does the amount of \u201ctacit\u201d\nknowledge that may contribute to diagnostic reasoning.\n\nThere are various ways in which diagnosis is taught and\noperationalized in clinical settings: in some subspecialties in\nparticular, \u201cpattern\u201d recognition often using pictorial\nrepresentations seems to be common, and hence diagnosis is a form of\nrecognizing repeated patterns. However this approach can be dangerous\nparticularly among novices, given the large number of similar patterns\namong common diseases. Some have claimed that the making of a\ndiagnosis is both a deontic act and computable, and that diagnoses are\nrelative only inasmuch as they occur in a complex context which in\nturn makes them a social practice (Sadegh-Zadeh 2011).\nComputer-assisted diagnostic techniques have improved and are used\nincreasingly in clinical settings; Kenneth Schaffner (1981) provided\nan early analysis of the criteria which an ideal diagnostic logic\nwould need to satisfy (for updated discussions see Schaffner 1993,\n2010, and for arguments about the limitations of such types of\ndiagnosis see Wartofsky 1986). In recent years there is a relative\nconsensus among medical professionals and those involved in medical\ninformatics that medical diagnosis almost certainly relies on some\nform of \u201cfuzzy logic\u201d (e.g., Sadegh-Zadeh 2000; Barro and\nMarin 2002).\n",
