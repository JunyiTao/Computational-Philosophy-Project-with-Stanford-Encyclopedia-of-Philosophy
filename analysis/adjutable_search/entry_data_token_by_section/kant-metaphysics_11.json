    "main_text": "God and Rational Theology || The Other Proofs\n6. Reason and the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic\n\nThe criticisms of the metaphysical arguments offered in the\nTranscendental Dialectic do not bring Kant\u2019s discussion to a\nclose. Indeed, in an \u201cAppendix\u201d to the Transcendental\nDialectic, Kant returns to the issue of reason\u2019s positive or\nnecessary role. The curious \u201cAppendix\u201d has provoked a\ngreat deal of confusion, and not without reason. After all, the entire\nthrust of the Dialectic seemed to be directed at\n\u201ccritiquing\u201d and curbing pure reason, and undermining its\npretense to any real use. Nevertheless, Kant goes on to suggest that\nthe very reason that led us into metaphysical error is also the source\nof certain necessary ideas and principles, and moreover, that these\nrational postulations play an essential role in scientific theorizing\n(A645/B673; A671/B699). Exactly what role they are supposed to play in\nthis regard is less clear.\n\nThe Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic is divided into two\nparts. In the first, \u201cOn the Regulative Use of the Ideas of Pure\nReason,\u201d Kant attempts to identify some proper\n\u201cimmanent\u201d use for reason. In its most general terms, Kant\nis here concerned to establish a necessary role for reason\u2019s\nprinciple of systematic unity. This principle was first formulated by\nKant in the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic in two forms,\none prescriptive, and the other in what sounded to be a metaphysical\nclaim. In the first, prescriptive form, the principle enjoins us to\n\u201cFind for the conditioned knowledge given through the\nunderstanding the unconditioned whereby its unity is brought to\ncompletion.\u201d The complementary metaphysical principle assures us\nthat the \u201cunconditioned\u201d is indeed given and there to be\nfound. Taken together, these principles express reason\u2019s\ninterests in securing systematic unity of knowledge and bringing such\nknowledge to completion.\n\nKant is quite clear that he takes reason\u2019s demand for\nsystematicity to play an important role in empirical inquiry. In\nconnection with this, Kant suggests that the coherent operation of the\nunderstanding somehow requires reason\u2019s guiding influence,\nparticularly if we are to unify the knowledge given through the real\nuse of the understanding into scientific theory (cf.\nA651\u201352/B679\u201380). To order knowledge systematically, for\nKant, means to subsume or unify it under fewer and fewer principles in\nlight of the idea of one \u201cwhole of knowledge\u201d so that its\nparts are exhibited in their necessary connections (cf. 646/B674). The\nidea of the form of a whole of knowledge is thus said to postulate\n\u201ccomplete unity in the knowledge obtained by the understanding,\nby which this knowledge is to be not a mere contingent aggregate, but\na system connected according to necessary laws\u201d (A646/B676).\nHaving said this, it should be noted that Kant\u2019s position is, in\nits details, difficult to pin down. Sometimes Kant suggests merely\nthat we ought to seek systematic unity of knowledge, and this\nmerely for own theoretical convenience (A771/B799-A772/B800). Other\ntimes, however, he suggests that we must assume that the nature\nitself conforms to our demands for systematic unity, and this\nnecessarily, if we are to secure even an empirical criterion of truth\n(cf. A651\u201353/B679\u201381). The precise status of the demand\nfor systematicity is therefore somewhat controversial.\n\nRegardless of these more subtle textual issues Kant remains committed\nto the view that reason\u2019s proper use is always only\n\u201cregulative\u201d and never constitutive. The distinction\nbetween the regulative and the constitutive may be viewed as\ndescribing two different ways in which the claims of reason may be\ninterpreted. A principle of reason is constitutive, according to Kant,\nwhen it is taken to supply a concept of a real object (A306/B363;\nA648/B676). Throughout the Dialectic Kant argued against this\n(constitutive) interpretation of the ideas and principles of reason,\nclaiming that reason so far transcends possible experience that there\nis nothing in experience that corresponds with its ideas. Although\nKant denies that reason is constitutive he nevertheless, as we have\nseen, insists that it has an \u201cindispensably necessary\u201d\nregulative use. In accordance with reason\u2019s demand, the\nunderstanding is guided and led to secure systematic unity and\ncompletion of knowledge. In other words, Kant seeks to show that\nreason\u2019s demand for systematic unity is related to the project\nof empirical knowledge acquisition. Indeed, Kant links the demand for\nsystematicity up with three other principles \u2014 those of\nhomogeneity, specification and affinity \u2014 which he thinks\nexpress the fundamental presumptions that guide us in theory\nformation. The essential point seems to be that the development and\nexpansion of empirical knowledge is always, as it were,\n\u201calready\u201d guided by the rational interests in securing\nunity and completion of knowledge. Without such a guiding agenda, and\nwithout the assumption that nature conforms to our rational demands\nfor securing unity and coherence of knowledge, our scientific pursuits\nwould lack orientation. Thus, the claim that reason\u2019s principles\nplay a necessary \u201cregulative\u201d role in science reflects\nKant\u2019s critical reinterpretation of the traditional rationalist\nideal of arriving at complete knowledge.\n\nIt is connection with this that Kant argues, in the second part of the\nAppendix (\u201cOn the Final Aim of the Natural Dialectic of Human\nReason\u201d (A669/B697)), that the three highest ideas of reason\nhave an important theoretical function. More specifically, in\nthis section Kant turns from a general discussion of the important\n(regulative) use of the principle of systematicity, to a consideration\nof the three transcendental ideas (the Soul, the World, and God) at\nissue in the Dialectic. As examples of the unifying and guiding role\nof reason\u2019s ideas, Kant had earlier appealed to the ideas of\n\u201cpure earth\u201d and \u201cpure air\u201d in Chemistry, or\nthe idea of a \u201cfundamental power\u201d in psychological\ninvestigations (cf. A650/B678). His suggestion earlier was that these\nideas are implicit in the practices governing scientific\nclassification, and enjoin us to seek explanatory connections between\ndisparate phenomena. As such, reason\u2019s postulations serve to\nprovide an orienting point towards which our explanations strive, and\nin accordance with which our theories progressively achieve systematic\ninterconnection and unity. Similarly, Kant now suggests that each of\nthe three transcendental ideas of reason at issue in the Dialectic\nserves as an imaginary point (focus imaginarius) towards\nwhich our investigations hypothetically converge. More specifically,\nhe suggests that the idea of the soul serves to guide our empirical\ninvestigations in psychology, the idea of the world grounds physics,\nand the idea of God grounds the unification of these two branches of\nnatural science into one unified Science (cf. A684/B712-A686/B714). In\neach of these cases, Kant claims, the idea allows us to represent\n(problematically) the systematic unity towards which we aspire and\nwhich we presuppose in empirical studies. In accordance with the idea\nof God, for example, we \u201cconsider every connection in the world\naccording to principles [Principien] of a systematic unity,\nhence as if they had all arisen from one single\nall-encompassing being, as supreme and all-sufficient cause\u201d\n(A686/B714). Such a claim, controversial as it is, illuminates\nKant\u2019s view that empirical inquiries are one and all undertaken\nin light of the rational goal of a single unified body of knowledge.\nIt also points towards the Kantian view, later emphasized in the\nTranscendental Doctrine of Method, that reason\u2019s theoretical and\npractical interests ultimately form a higher unity.\n\nFor discussions on the Appendix and the role of reason and\nsystematicity, see Allison (2004), Brandt (1989), Buchdahl (1967),\nBritton (1978), Forster (2000), Friedman (1992), Ginsborg (1990),\nGrier (2001, forthcoming), Guyer (1990a, 1990b), Horstmann (1989),\nO\u2019Neill (1992), Patricia Kitcher (1991), Philip Kitcher (1984),\nNieman (1994), MacFarland (1970), Walker (1990), Walsh (1975),\nWartenberg (1979, 1992), Rauscher (2010), Willaschek (2018).\n\nFor an important discussion on the \u201cunity\u201d of theoretical\nand practical reason, see again Forster (2000).
