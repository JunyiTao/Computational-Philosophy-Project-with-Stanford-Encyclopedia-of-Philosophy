    "main_text": "Intuition and Expression || Feeling, Expression and the Commonplace\n4.3 Feeling, Expression and the Commonplace\n\nWhen Croce says that intuition and expression are the same phenomenon,\nwe are likely to think: what does this mean for a person who cannot\ndraw or paint, for example? Even if we allow Croce his widened notion\nof feeling, surely the distinction between a man who looks at a bowl\nof fruit but cannot draw or paint it, and the man who does draw or\npaint it, is precisely that of a man with a Crocean intuition but who\ncannot express it, and one who has both. How then can expression\nbe intuition?\n\nCroce comes at this concern from both sides. On one side, there is\n\u2018the illusion or prejudice that we possess a more complete\nintuition of reality than we really do\u2019 (Aes. 9). We\nhave, most of the time, only fleeting, transitory intuitions amidst\nthe bustle of our practical lives. \u2018The world which as rule we\nintuit is a small thing\u2019, he writes; \u2018It consists of small\nexpressions \u2026 it is a medley of light and colour\u2019\n(Aes. 9). On the other side, if our man is seriously focussed\non the bowl of fruit, it is only a prejudice to deny that then he is\nto that extent expressing himself\u2014although, according to Croce,\nordinary direct perception of things, as glimpsed in photography, will\ngenerally be lacking the \u2018lyrical\u2019 quality that genuine\nartists give to their works (though this particular twist is a later\naddition; see section 9 below).\n",
