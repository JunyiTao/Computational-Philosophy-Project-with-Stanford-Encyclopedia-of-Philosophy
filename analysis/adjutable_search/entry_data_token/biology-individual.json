The Focal Question: What are Biological Individuals?\n\nThe biological world contains an incredibly diverse variety of\nindividuals. At the ground level of common sense, there are\nalligators, ants, beetles, marmots, moles, mushrooms, ostriches,\nroses, trees, and whales. At this ground level, biological individuals\nare physically-bounded, relatively well-integrated, autonomous agents,\nthe ones listed being amongst those that can be readily detected with\nthe senses. Extending the reach of common sense through magnification\nallows flagella-propelled protists, tRNA molecules, prions, and\nbacteria of many kinds to be seen or inferred. At larger or collective\nscales, there are herds of zebras, sweeping and astonishing coral\nreefs, algae blooms, biofilms made up of many different species, and\neven fungus complexes several hectares in area and with masses greater\nthan that of an elephant.\n\nWhat we will call the Focal Question\u2014what are\nbiological individuals?\u2014can be paraphrased in a number of\nways:\n\nWhat constitutes being a biological individual?\nWhat makes something a biological individual?\nWhat is the nature of the category biological\nindividual?\nWhat is the best explicative definition of the term\n\u201cbiological individual\u201d?\n\n\nIn the rapidly expanding literature on biological individuals (cf.\nHull 1992 with Guay & Pradeu 2016a, 2016b, and Lidgard &\nNyhart 2017b), such questions take biological individual as a\ngeneral category that may subsume several kinds of biological\nindividual (e.g., evolutionary, developmental, genetic, metabolic).\n\n\nThe psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus\u2019s famous quip that\n\u201cpsychology has a long past, but only a short history\u201d\n(1908: 1, Die Psychologie hat eine lange Vergangenheit, doch nur\neine kurze Geschichte) might well be adapted to remind us that\nanswers to the Focal Question have a long past, one stretching back to\nat least the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the life\nsciences. In their recent collection of essays Biological\nIndividuality, the historians Scott Lidgard and Lynne Nyhart\nreviewed the literature of the past two hundred years to compile a\nlist of twenty three criteria used to define or characterize\n\u201cindividual or its contained subset\norganism\u201d, noting that while \n\n\nthe terms are not equivalent, they have been used interchangeably in\nmany publications, precluding a simple separation here. (2017a: 18)\n\n\n\nAddressing the Focal Question thus calls for sensitivity to this\ntendency in the long past.\n\nAs Derek Skillings says, the \u201ctraditional target of accounts of\nbiological individuality is the organism\u201d (2016: 880), a\ntradition reinforced in some influential contemporary discussions that\nsimply identify biological individuals with organisms (Queller &\nStrassmann 2009, Clarke 2013; see\n section 8\n below). The present review follows Lidgard and Nyhart and others\n(Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2009; Nicholson 2014; Pradeu 2016a,\n2016b) in taking biological individual to name a\nsuperordinate category whose nature and relation to the category\norganism is complex and worthy of exploration.\n\nPhilosophers of biology typically understand biological individuals to\nbe distinct from other kinds of entities in the biosciences, such as\nproperties, processes, and events (though see Dupr\u00e9 2012,\nNicholson 2018, Nicholson & Dupr\u00e9 2018). Biological\nindividuals have three-dimensional spatial boundaries, endure for some\nperiod of time, are composed of physical matter, bear properties, and\nparticipate in processes and events. Biological processes\n(such as photosynthesis) and biological events (such as\nspeciation) lack such a suite of features. Although philosophers have\nexplored the question of what makes anything an individual of\nany kind (e.g., Strawson 1959; van Inwagen 1990; Chauvier\n2016; French 2014, 2016; Lowe 2016; Wiggins 2016), such questions are\nbracketed off here in order to concentrate on biological\nindividuals (cf. Love & Brigandt 2017).\n\nTo provide a sense of the complexities that an answer to the Focal\nQuestion must address, consider two examples that take us from the\nground level of common sense with which this review began to\nthe intimate interplay between empirical data gathered by biologists\nand the conceptual clarification provided by philosophers that is a\nhallmark of thinking about biological individuals. The first of these\nexamples was introduced into discussions of biological individuals by\nthe philosopher of biology Jack Wilson (1999: 23\u201325), the second\nby the physiologist Scott Turner (2000: ch.2).\n2. Some Complexities: A Humungous Fungus and Coral Reefs\n\nIn the early 1990s, a team of biologists reported in the journal\nNature that they had found high levels of genetic identity in\nsamples of a species of fungus (Armillaris bulbosa), which\nhad taken over a large geographic region in Michigan\u2019s Upper\nPeninsula. They used this data to make a case for viewing these\nsamples as constituting parts of one gigantic biological individual\nwith an estimated biomass of more than ten tons and an estimated age\nexceeding 1500 years. They concluded that \u201cmembers of the fungal\nkingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest\norganisms on earth\u201d (Smith, Bruhn, & Anderson 1992: 431).\nSome scientists have questioned whether this final claim about the\norganismal status of the humungous fungus is warranted, and some have\nargued it is mistaken to say the gigantic fungus constitutes a single\nbiological individual. Since then, other scientists have recognized\neven larger funguses as biological individuals (Schmitt & Tatum\n2008).\n\nHow does one judge such claims and disputes? Minimally, more empirical\ninformation about the example is needed. Is the fungus a continuous\nbiological structure? Does it have a determinate growth pattern? Can\nit reproduce? But this empirical information alone doesn\u2019t\nsettle the matter. One must also draw on antecedent concepts of\norganism and biological individual. The empirical information, in\nturn, also allows one to fine-tune, amend, or challenge those\nantecedent concepts, better so than would common sense reflection\nalone. For example, if the humungous fungus is not an organism but\nsome other sort of biological individual, which empirical\nconsiderations motivate this distinction?\n\nConsider a more elaborately described example (Turner 2000: ch.2; see\nalso Skillings 2016: 877\u2013879). Coral reefs are spectacular and\nbeautiful parts of the living world, despite rapidly becoming a thing\nof the past due to the climate changes associated with global warming.\nAt least at the ground level of common sense, they are often thought\nof as consisting of two chief components. The first are accretions of\ncalcite deposits. The second are the small animals, polyps, which\nproduce and grow on the deposits. (Coral polyps belong to the same\nLinnaean class as sea anemones, and to the same Linnaean phylum as\njellyfish.) The polyps are indisputably biological individuals. But\nfurther, conservation biologists also often describe the coral reefs\nthemselves, consisting of the polyps and the deposits considered\ntogether, as living things that can grow and die.\n\nThe reefs are at least biological individuals, typically being thought\nof as ecosystems; formal methods already exist for modeling them as\nsuch (e.g., Huneman 2014). And taking seriously their life, growth and\ndeath leads to the question of whether they too might be organisms: to\na first approximation, metabolically-circumscribed entities that are\nrelatively well-integrated and function as a whole. The dependence\nrelations between the reefs and the polyps does not rule this out,\nsince such dependence is common in organisms. Human beings depend on\ninternal bacteria that outnumber our own cells by about ten to one,\nand yet they are organisms (Ackerman 2012). Similarly, the polyps that\nreefs depend on are themselves dependent on single-celled algae,\ncommonly referred to as zooxanthellae, for the glucose that\nprovides the energy necessary for polyp respiration, which in turn\ndrives the process of calcification. Moreover, it is the zooxanthellae\nthat supply the pigments that give living corals their spectacular\ncolors; when zooxanthellae are absent or diminished, this signals a\nproblem for the long-term survival of a coral reef. Neither are the\nzooxanthellae free of dependence. By infecting the polyps they gain a\nfeeding den crucial to their survival.\n\nFurther reflection along these lines may suggest that an integrated\ncausal network of dependence relations is a mark of being an organism\nor biological individual; \u201ccausal integration, cohesion,\ncollaboration, or agency of parts\u201d is the criterion on Lidgard\nand Nyhart\u2019s (2017a) list of criteria that they found most often\ncited in the literature they reviewed. If that were so, then the coral\nreef may come to be viewed as a better exemplar of either than are the\npolyps and zooxanthellae, as the reef enjoys a kind or degree of\ncomplex, functional integrity that polyps and zooxanthellae arguably\nlack when considered singly (see also Combes 2001). Alternatively,\nperhaps the reef should be thought of as some other kind of biological\nindividual, such as an ecosystem, that contains several distinct\norganisms, the polyps and the zooxanthellae, as proper parts.\n\nAgain, knowing what to say about the striking claim that the\npolyp-zooxanthellae-calcite deposit complex is an organism turns in\npart on the empirical facts, but on more than just those. Polyps,\nzooxanthellae and whole reef complexes do not wear placards that state\nwhich is an example of an organism, and whether all three should be\nviewed as biological individuals of some kind or other (and which\nkind). The interplay between our conceptions and empirical\ncomplexities both allows those conceptions to be unpacked and informs\nhow they might be regimented to better capture nuances of the\nbiological world inaccessible to commonsense reflection alone. \n\nThis interplay has recently involved philosophers and biologists\nattending more squarely to the microbial world\n(O\u2019Malley, Simpson, & Roger 2013; O\u2019Malley 2014),\nrecognizing the various tight integrative and collaborative relations\nbetween what prima facie are distinct biological individuals\n(Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2009, Ereshefsky & Pedroso\n2015), and trying to make sense of the diversity one finds in the\nprocesses of reproduction, metabolism, and development (Godfrey-Smith\n2016b, Griesemer 2016). The next section provides an introductory\nsurvey of this interplay via discussion of three subsidiary\nquestions.\n3. Conceptual Space, Distinctions, and Beyond Organisms\n\nResponses to the Focal Question have advanced discussion of at least\nthree closely related subsidiary questions:\n\n Beyond Organisms: In what ways does the traditional\nfocus on organisms hinder us in thinking about biological\nindividuals?\n Distinctions:  What are the most useful distinctions\nbetween various kinds of biological individuals?\n Conceptual Space: What is the most informative way to\narticulate the conceptual space surrounding the concept of biological\nindividuals?\n\n\nThe first of these questions anchors our discussion in the short\nhistory of thinking about biological individuals while acknowledging\nthe long past of the Focal Question. \n3.1 Beyond Organisms: Microbialism, Eliminativism, and Holobionts\n\nScientists themselves\u2014following common sense\u2014have been\ndrawn first and foremost to organisms when beginning their theorizing\nabout biological individuals. For example, consider John Maynard Smith\nand E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s The Major Transitions of\nLife (1995), a wide-ranging book on the origins and evolution of\nlife that has stimulated much work on the evolution of individuality (Buss\n1987) and the Darwinian dynamics (Michod 1999) that governs emerging\nkinds of biological entities (see\n section 9\n below). The book opens with a simple point about the living world and\na characterization of the book\u2019s chief theme: \n\n\nLiving organisms are highly complex, and are composed of parts that\nfunction to ensure the survival and reproduction of the whole. This\nbook is about how and why this complexity has increased in the course\nof evolution. The increase has been neither universal nor inevitable.\n(Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 3) \n\n\nHere organisms or biological individuals are viewed as exemplars of\ncomplex living things composed of many parts, and their complexity is\ntaken to have increased\u2014albeit unevenly and\ncontingently\u2014through evolution by natural selection. \n\nLikewise, an early collection of essays on evolutionary developmental\nbiology (\u201cevo-devo\u201d) by Gerd M\u00fcller and Stuart Newman\n(2003) focuses on how organismal form originated and on the\nevolutionary, developmental, and ecological processes shaping it over\ngenerations. The essays in that volume concentrate on the\nrelationships between basic body plans of organisms over phylogenetic\ntime, rather than the evolution of individuality as such, and do not\ntake up The Focal Question about biological individuals at all. But\nlike that of Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry, the project of\nexploring these relationships is naturally expressed in terms of the\nconcept of an organism. \n\nThis should occasion no surprise, since, as\n section 1\n indicated, historically organisms have been regarded as prominent\nexamples of biological individuals and organism and\nbiological individual have often been used interchangeably.\nBut the short quotation drawn from Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nalso helps to explain why simply equating biological individuals with\norganisms would be a mistake. The parts that compose organisms in all\ntheir complexity are, often enough, themselves biological individuals.\nEven if some of those parts are also organisms (e.g., the microbes\nthat live on and in macrobes), many are not. Precisely the same is\ntrue of the populations and lineages that individual organisms in turn\nconstitute. These may occasionally be organisms (e.g., eusocial insect\ncolonies as \u201csuperorganisms\u201d), but typically populations\nand lineages are biological individuals that are not\norganisms. If either this internal compositional complexity to\norganisms or their formation into populations and lineages are\nnecessary features of organisms (which many philosophers and\nbiologists at least tend to think they are; see Lidgard & Nyhart\n2017a: 18\u201323), then this would prove a stronger conclusion:\ngiven that there are organisms, there must be some biological\nindividuals that are not organisms.\n\nSo one way in which the traditional focus on organisms can hinder us\nin thinking about biological individuals is if, by equating the two,\nthere is too little attention focused on biological individuals that\nare not organisms. But hindrance here could take a different form, as\nsome have argued. One might think that a focus on organisms,\nparticularly those identified at the ground level of common sense,\ncommits not just this kind of error of omission, but also proves\npositively misleading about what biological individuals are.\nConsider two positions that challenge the privileging of organisms in\ndiscussions of The Focal Question:\n\nMicrobialism: Understanding the living world requires\nfocusing on collaborations between macrobes and a variety of\nmicrobes (e.g., viruses, prions, plasmids, symbionts), taking\nseriously the idea that the biological individuals identified at the\nground level of common sense constitute a small part of that world\n(Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2007, 2009).\nEliminativism: Far from being paradigmatic\nbiological individuals, organisms may be marginal or unusual special\ncases of biological individuals and should be eliminated from our\nontology (Haber 2013, Okasha 2011).\n\n\nMicrobialism has been part and parcel of Dupr\u00e9 and\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s plaint against the macrobist bias in\nthe philosophy of biology and the positive case they have made for the\nsignificance of the microbial world for reconceptualizing biological\nindividuals (O\u2019Malley 2014, 2015; O\u2019Malley, Simpson, &\nRoger 2013; Dupr\u00e9 2010). One direction that this has been taken\nis Dupr\u00e9\u2019s (2012) promiscuous individualism.\n\n\nPromiscuous individualism is not simply the view that there are many\nlegitimate ways to classify the world into biological individuals. It\nis also the corresponding ontological view that such legitimation is\nprovided by there being multiple biological individuals there to\nclassify. To illustrate this view, consider lichens, which are\ntypically regarded as what have been called corporate\norganisms (R.A. Wilson 2005: 80\u201384), in this case made up\nof a fungus and either a cyanobacterium or some other\nphotosynthesizing agent, such as green algae. Challenging the view\nthat there is just one biological individual (the lichen) or two (the\nfungus and the cyanobacterium), an advocate of promiscuous\nindividualism can readily make the case that there are three\nbiological individuals (the lichen, the fungus, and the\ncyanobacterium), pointing to the different purposes and goals one\nmight have in opting for any of the numerical counts here. \n\nGiven that it is a population of millions of cyanobacteria inhabiting\nany given fungus that jointly compose a lichen, and that there are\nmultiple ways to draw the boundary between individual fungi of a given\nspecies (Molter 2017), note how rampant promiscuity can run here.\nDupr\u00e9 himself holds that populations, including multispecies\npopulations such as those found in microbial biofilms, can themselves\nbe both biological individuals and organisms (2012: 89, 175\u2013176,\n194, 203). He also says that \u201c[w]hether a group of microbes is a\nclosely connected ecological community or an organism may be a matter\nof biological judgment\u201d (2012: 153). Promiscuous individualism\nthus implies that there are many, many different numbers of\nindividuals present in this paradigm case. It seems even to suggest\nthat whether there are any biological individuals at all is\n\u201ca matter of biological judgment\u201d, rather than something\ndetermined by the biological facts. \n\nThe emphasis on collaborations between living things in Microbialism\ncan undermine the focus on organisms without entering (at least\ndirectly) into these deep metaphysical waters. That emphasis can also\nmotivate Eliminativism. One way it can do so is by embracing the idea\nthat it is not organisms but holobionts that are really\nparadigmatic biological individuals. A holobiont is, at least roughly,\n\u201cthe multicellular eukaryote plus its colonies of\nsymbionts\u201d (Gilbert & Tauber 2016: 842). This concept is\nattractive to some scientists (e.g., Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg\n2008; Bordenstein & Theis 2015; Bosch & Miller 2016; cf.\nDouglas & Werren 2016) while also sparking ongoing philosophical\nwork (Theis et al. 2016, Booth 2014, Doolittle & Booth 2017). For\nexample, a recent special issue of the journal Biology &\nPhilosophy on biological individuality (volume 31, issue 6)\ncontains papers that focus on the significance of the holobiont for\nimmunology (Chiu & Eberl 2016; Gilbert & Tauber 2016) and for\nthe evolution of individuality and its major transitions (Queller\n& Strassmann 2016, Skillings 2016; cf. Bourrat & Griffiths\n2018).\n\nLike the concept of an organism that it putatively supplements or\nsupplants, that of the holobiont encompasses a huge diversity of\nentities. These include macro-organisms and the microbial\nendosymbionts living within their cells (such as Chlamydia\nand other obligate parasites); those that live beyond their cells but\nin close symbiotic relations (such as cyanobacteria); and the\nmultispecies microbiota that inhabit the human intestine (Booth 2014).\nThere are challenges in how to delineate individual holobionts that,\nas we will see in the next section, may be met by embracing particular\nphysiological criteria for individuation (Pradeu 2012). Yet those\nchallenges have suggested to some that the take-away lesson from\nreflection on holobionts is that emphasis should be placed not on\nanother kind of individual, a holobiont, but instead on the process of\nholobiosis (Doolittle & Booth 2017). It remains too early\nto tell whether the concept of the holobiont will live up to its\nstill-early promise of revolutionizing thinking about biological\nindividuals; this will likely be an area of emerging and exciting work\nfor the next several years.\n3.2 Distinctions: The Evolutionary and the Physiological\n\nConsider now our second subsidiary question, Distinctions: what are\nthe most useful distinctions between the various kinds of biological\nindividuals that exist? The most commonly recognized distinction here,\nin the recent literature, is that between evolutionary and\nphysiological (or metabolic) individuals (Pradeu\n2016a, 2016b).\n\nProminent in contemporary thinking about evolutionary individuals is\nthe work of Peter Godfrey-Smith on what he calls Darwinian\nindividuals. On the view of evolution and natural selection he\ndefends in Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection\n(2009), what evolves are \u201cDarwinian populations\u201d,\ncollections of things in which at least three conditions hold: there\nis variation in the traits had by things in the collection,\nthose traits are heritable within the collection, and some\nvariants of the traits confer reproductive advantage on the things\nthat bear them. In such a Darwinian population, the members are\nDarwinian individuals, which are both bearers and active reproducers\nof heritable traits (see Godfrey-Smith 2013: 19\u201320). \n\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s approach to evolutionary individuals is intended\nto contrast with the earlier replicator-based views developed by\nRichard Dawkins and others. Replicator views have been central to\ndiscussions of the levels and units of selection (Godfrey-Smith 2015;\nSober & Wilson 1994, 1998; Okasha 2006), and derivatively so to\nviews of biological individuals. Here genes are paradigmatic\nreplicators, being housed in interactors, such as organisms,\nand it is the survival of these replicators that matters in evolution.\nThe replicator framework emphasizes the importance for natural\nselection of high-fidelity copying across generations. By contrast,\nwhat matters for natural selection in Godfrey-Smith\u2019s view is\nthe establishment of parent-offspring lineages that feature\nheritability, as well as the variety of forms that reproduction can\ntake in the establishment and stabilization of those lineages. \n\nThis shift from replication to the process of reproduction in accounts\nof biological individuals has a longer history, particularly amongst\nthose sensitive to the relationships between evolution and\ndevelopment. For example, James Griesemer (2000) has argued that\nbiological reproduction involves fission and fusion requiring what he\ncalls progeneration, a process that creates new entities\nthrough material overlap, and that that process is a crucial\nfeature of how living agents evolve.\n Section 6\n takes up this issue in more detail in discussing reproduction, life\ncycles, and lineages.\n\nWhichever way evolutionary individuals are conceptualized, they do not\nexhaust the realm of biological individuals any more than do\norganisms. The general point here is that although evolution is\nfoundational when thinking about interactors and Darwinian\nindividuals, it does not play this role for all kinds of biological\nindividual, as Godfrey-Smith himself recognizes. Indeed, Godfrey-Smith\n(2013) strikingly (and controversially) proposes that even some\norganisms, understood from a metabolic point of view, are not\nDarwinian individuals at all. These are a subset of corporate\norganisms, multi-species organisms formed through symbiotic\nrelationships between members of different species. Here Godfrey-Smith\nposits the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and the\nVibrio bacteria they contain as an example (see also Nyholm &\nMcFall-Ngai 2004; Bouchard 2010). Since the squid-Vibrio corporate\norganism does not itself form the right kinds of parent-offspring\nlineages it is not a Darwinian individual, differing in this respect\nwith other often-discussed corporate organisms, such as\naphid-Buchnera complexes (Andersson 2000):\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Godfrey-Smith\u2019s\nDifferent Biological Individuals.\n\n(Copied from Figure 4 of Godfrey-Smith 2013.)\n\n[An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhatever one says about the intricacies of such examples, in addition\nto individuals delineated by evolutionary criteria there are also what\nThomas Pradeu calls physiological individuals. These are\nbiological individuals individuated by appeal to criteria such as\nhaving a metabolism and being governed by internal control mechanisms\nof various kinds. For Pradeu, each physiological individual is\n\u201ca functionally integrated and cohesive metabolic whole, made of\ninterdependent and interconnected parts\u201d (Pradeu 2016b: 807; see\nalso Godfrey-Smith 2009: 71). \n\nAs Pradeu notes (2016b: 799\u2013802), there is a long tradition in\nthe physiological sciences of addressing the Focal Question by asking\nwhat it is that makes for unity of functioning in biological\nindividuals: \n\n\nto ask how distinct and heterogeneous components interact and\nconstitute a cohesive whole, functioning collectively as a regulated\nunit that persists through time. (2016b: 800) \n\n\nAlthough there is typically a nod paid to physiological individuals in\nearly influential discussions of biological individuals in the short\nhistory of the topic (e.g., Sober 1991, Hull 1992, Dawkins 1989:\nch.13), the bulk of this literature has focused until very recently on\nevolutionary individuals. Pradeu\u2019s reminder of the long past of\nthe Focal Question, and the prominence of physiological individuals in\nit, is a welcome redress to the resulting skew of attention.\n\nIn addition to this general point, Pradeu has also defended the view\nthat an organism is a particular kind of physiological individual,\nbeing \n\n\na functionally integrated whole composed of heterogeneous components\nthat are locally interconnected by strong biochemical interactions and\ncontrolled by constant systemic immune interactions of a constant\naverage intensity. (Pradeu 2012: 244) \n\n\nHere Pradeu builds on a particular view of immunology developed in his\nThe Limits of the Self that moves beyond the theory\nassociated with Frank Burnet, the self-nonself theory. In its place,\nPradeu offers a general account of immunogenicity that applies across\na wide range of phlya, ignoring the exogenous or endogenous origin of\nantigens in favor of a criterion that emphasizes immune-tolerance and\nacceptance.\n\nPradeu takes the boundary established and maintained by the immune\nsystem as the boundary of the organism. On Pradeu\u2019s\nview, organisms are inherently heterogeneous, given the collaborative\nnature of the microbial and macrobial worlds articulated in\nMicrobialism. To put it slightly differently, the true organisms\ndelineated by Pradeu\u2019s immunity criterion are holobionts\nconstituted by a macrobial organism and all and only those microbes at\nleast tolerated by its immune system. This criterion provides a way to\nindividuate organisms as holobionts, and the resulting view\nconstitutes one way to constructively respond to the challenges of\nMicrobialism and Eliminativism. Whether holobionts are best thought of\nas organisms or evolutionary individuals at all (Skillings 2016), or\nwhether Pradeu\u2019s view in particular can resolve the putative\n\u201ctension in seeing symbionts as both organisms themselves and\nalso parts of larger organisms\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2016c: 782),\nremain live issues.\n\nSo minimally there are evolutionary individuals and there are\nphysiological individuals, and organisms are typically thought of as\nexemplars of (but not strictly identical to) both.\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s articulation of evolutionary individuals as\nDarwinian individuals has structured much recent and ongoing\ndiscussion, and Pradeu\u2019s emphasis on physiological individuals\nand his appeal to immunology as a source for ideas about organisms and\nbiological individuals more generally has garnered recent attention.\nThese responses to Distinctions also facilitate rich responses to our\nremaining subsidiary question, Conceptual Space: What is the most\ninformative way to articulate the conceptual space surrounding the\nconcept of biological individuals? \n3.3 Conceptual Space and Pluralism\n\nRecognizing the distinction between evolutionary and physiological\nindividuals commits one to a minimal form of pluralism about what\npopulates that conceptual space. But there are also more radical forms\nthat pluralism about biological individuals has taken in the\nliterature.\n Section 3.1\n indicated that the emphasis on the collaborative nature of the\ninteractions between biological individuals in Microbialism motivates\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s promiscuous individualism, a position that\ninvites a very liberal form of pluralism that makes biological\nindividuality seem, at least partly, a function of our epistemic,\npractical, and other proclivities, rather than of just the structure\nof the biological world itself. \n\nHere Dupr\u00e9 can be understood as following the general intuition\nthat if some kind K seems too diverse to characterize, it should be\nsplit into diverse sub-kinds, with each of those characterized. In\nearly philosophical work (J. Wilson 1999, 2000) also drew on this\nintuition, where K = biological individual, moving beyond\nthat broad concept to characterize genetic,\nfunctional, developmental, and evolutionary\nindividuals. Famously, the botanist John Harper invoked pluralism,\nwhere K = plant, by introducing the more particular kinds\nramet and genet to replace talk of individuals. A\nramet is what might be readily identified as an individual plant; a\ngenet is a collection of ramets that propagate, as is often the case,\nthrough the clonal growth of a particular ramet (Harper 1977). How\nmany plants there are, in many cases, depends on whether ramets or\ngenets are meant. For example, while each of the trees in an aspen\ngrove that forms clonally is a ramet, collectively they typically form\na single genet. A pluralist might prefer a description cast in terms\nof ramets and genets over any attempt to answer the question of how\nmany plants or individuals, per se, there are in this case. \n\nPluralism about biological individuals has also been motivated by the\ngeneral idea that particular epistemic practices, rather than\nor additional to high-level biological theory, should drive\none\u2019s ontological commitments (Kovaka 2015, Chen 2016, Love\n2018; for interplay of theory and experimental practice in this\nconnection, see Fagan 2016). Just as practices of the individuation of\nspecies might vary with the differential practices of (say)\nciliatologists and ornithologists, so too might the very individuative\ncriteria for being a (relevant) biological individual differ according\nto the varying epistemic practices across the biological sciences. How\nradical the resulting form of pluralism is will depend in part on how\nfine-grained one\u2019s view of the relevant practices is and the\nexpanse of the range of those practices. For example, are all of the\npractices in developmental biology clustered, or are distinctions to\nbe drawn between those relevant to the experimental investigation of\ngrowth and those relevant to homology? Are biological individuals that\nare posited in community ecology and are constituted by organisms,\nother living things, and non-living things including soils, included,\nas Roberta Millstein (2018) has recently done when discussing the\nland community (see also Eliot 2011)? Whether this results in\nwhat Alan Love calls strong individuality pluralism, the view\nthat \u201cfor a given situation, individuality can be modeled\ncorrectly in more than one way\u201d (2018: 187), turns on answers to\nsuch questions. \n4. Structuring Conceptual Space Beyond Pluralism\n\nSo far some of the pluralistic directions that discussions of\nDistinctions and Conceptual Space have taken in the literature have\nbeen outlined, leading to a conceptual landscape populated by a\nplethora of adjectivally-modified kinds of individuals: evolutionary,\nphysiological, developmental, functional, genetic, etc.. Although\nsimply equating biological individuals with organisms would be a\nmistake, some biologists (e.g., Pepper & Herron 2008; cf. Jagers\nop Akkerhuis 2010) have explored the idea that a more nuanced appeal\nto organisms can provide some informative structure to this landscape.\nNoting that \n\n\namongst biologists, the question of what constitutes an individual is\nusually identical with the question of what constitutes an individual\norganism. (Pepper & Herron 2008: 622) \n\n\nPepper and Herron pose the question of whether any given biological\nindividual is an organism, a part of an organism, or a group of\norganisms. Consider then a framework that holds that biological\nindividuals include exactly:\n\norganisms (such as wasps and whales)\nsome parts of organisms (such as placentas and plasmids)\nand\nsome groups of organisms (such as zebra lineages and\ncolonies of bacteria).\n\n\nFigure 2 depicts this framework visually.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A Framework for Structuring\nConceptual Space. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThese three sub-categories of biological individual need not be\nmutually exclusive when considering any particular individual. For\nexample, a given bacterium, such as an individual Buchnera\nbacterium, may both be an organism itself and be part of a corporate\norganism, such as the human whose gut it is integral to (Andersson\n2000). Likewise, some groups, such as the colonies of eusocial insects\nsometimes called \u201csuperorganisms\u201d, or highly integrated\nmultispecies communities, may be true organisms. This kind of\nview may also capture what truth lies behind proposals to extend the\nterm organism both to some parts and some groups of organisms\n(e.g., Queller 1997; Okasha 2011): parts of organisms (such as\nsymbiotic gut bacteria), as well as groups of organisms (such as\ncolonies of ants or bees), are really organisms as well. \n\nDirectly relevant to the Focal Question is that this framework invites\na more systematic treatment of the relationship between each of the\nprimary kinds of biological individuals\u2014evolutionary and\nphysiological individuals\u2014and other key features typically\nappealed to in characterizing them, including growth, reproduction,\nlineages, cohesion, metabolism, and control.\n Sections 6 and 7\n will elaborate the initial visual summary offered by\n Figure 2\n in ways that further fill out the conceptual space occupied by\nbiological individuals. But first\n Section 5\n attends to the right-hand side of Figure 2 by providing a brief\noverview of the idea of groups as biological individuals.\n5. Groups as Evolutionary Individuals: Superorganisms, Trait Groups, Species, Clades\n\nAs the discussion of evolutionary individuals in\n section 3\n indicated, responses to the question of whether natural selection has\ncreated groups that are themselves biological individuals has been\nimportant to the history of the Focal Question. Groups here might\nrange from temporary dyads of individuals, such as two crickets\nsharing a ride on a leaf (Sober & Wilson 1998), through to\nhigher-level taxonomic groups whose members are largely separated in\nspace and time, such as planktotrophic mollusks (Jablonski 1986,\n1987). One fundamental distinction that emerged with the revival of\ngroup selection, largely through the work of David Sloan Wilson (1975,\n1977, 1980, 1983) and Elliott Sober (D.S. Wilson & Sober 1989;\nSober & Wilson 1994, 1998), is between two sorts of groups:\nsuperorganisms and trait groups.\n\nThe term superorganism was introduced by the entomologist\nWilliam Morton Wheeler in his 1920 essay \u201cTermitodoxa, or\nBiology and Society\u201d, although he had talked of ant colonies as\norganisms as early as his 1911 essay \u201cThe Ant-Colony as an\nOrganism\u201d. Paradigm examples of superorganisms are colonies of\nsocial insects, e.g., Hymenoptera such as ants, wasps, and\nbees, together with the taxonomically distinct termites, which are\ntypically viewed as a special kind of biological individual arising\nfrom the specific genetics and reproductive division of labor in those\ncolonies. \n\nTrait group was introduced by D.S. Wilson, by contrast,\nspecifically to name a type of group that he thought was pervasive in\nnature, one that could be a unit of selection just as individual\norganisms were. The intuitive idea behind a trait group is that\npopulations can feature evolutionarily relevant structure wherein\norganisms belonging to one part of the population are subject to\ncausal influences on fitness that do not extend to the population as a\nwhole. A population of such structured demes would then\nfunction as a metapopulation, with natural selection operating between\nthe trait groups that make up that metapopulation. The individuals in\na trait group could thus be seen as evolutionary individuals, being\nthe agents for evolutionary change over time.\n\nA common two-pronged response to this distinction (e.g., Sterelny\n1996) has been to concede the reality of superorganismic group\nselection (but underscore its rarity) and argue that instances of\ntrait group selection are better described as cases of genic or\nindividual selection relativized to a particular environment,\nwhere part of that environment is composed of other individual\norganisms (see also Okasha 2006, 2018). In effect, this is to\nallow for superorganisms as a special kind of biological individual,\nbut to reject a more expansive conception of evolutionary individual\nat the group level. On this view, eusocial insects may be evolutionary\n(and even physiological) individuals, but trait groups are\nneither.\n\nA distinct pathway taken by appeals to group selection has focused on\nspecies and clade selection, particularly in work by paleobiologists\nand paleontologists (Grantham 1995; see also Doolittle 2017). Clades\nare monophyletic groups of organisms or species, groups defined by an\nancestor and all and only its descendants. Steven Stanley and Stephen\nJay Gould have been two of the most prominent defenders of the idea\nthat there are large-scale patterns of evolutionary change that are\ndue to species of clade selection, and both have done so in part by\nexplicitly developing an extended analogy between individual organisms\nand species (e.g., Stanley 1979: 189; Gould 2002: 703\u2013744).\nAmongst putative examples of clade selection are the evolution of\nplanktotrophic mollusks in the late Cretaceous, being selected for\ngreater geographic dispersal and so longevity (Jablonski 1986, 1987),\nthe evolution of larger body size in males, selected via population\ndensity and geographic range (Brown & Maurer 1987, 1989), and the\nevolution of flowering plants, selected via vector-mediated pollen\ndispersal (Stanley 1981: 90\u201391).\n\nThere is a similar caution in discussions of species or clades as\nevolutionary or physiological individuals as there is with trait\ngroups. One of the chief threads to the debate over species and clade\nselection also parallels that over trait group selection: are species\nor clades themselves really the agents of selection, the units that\nare being selected, or do they simply tag along for the ride, with\nselection operating exclusively on organisms and genes? Elisabeth Vrba\n(1984, 1989; Vrba & Gould 1986), for example, has distinguished\nbetween species sorting and species selection,\narguing that while a sorting of species may be the product of\nevolution by natural selection (see Barker & Wilson 2010), this\noutcome is typically brought about not by species selection but by\nindividual selection. On this view, species or clades may be a\nproduct of natural selection, and so in some sense\nevolutionary individuals, but they are not themselves agents in the\nprocess of natural selection. Rather, they are epiphenomena\nof that process, lacking the kind of agency that full-blown\nevolutionary individuals have.\n\nThe much-discussed claim that species are individuals (Ghiselin 1974;\nHull 1976, 1978), which developed as part of a response to the\nperceived failure of essentialism about species (Barker 2013, Sober\n1980), might be viewed in this same light. The species-as-individuals\nthesis reflects the way in which species were treated within\nsystematics and evolutionary biology not as kinds but instead as\nspatiotemporally restricted lineages, with individual\norganisms as their physical parts (Ereshefsky 1992; R.A. Wilson\n1999b). The species-as-individuals thesis was originally presented and\nseen as making a radical break with previous views of the ontological\nstatus of species, as it implied that biologists and philosophers\nalike had misidentified the basic ontological category to which\nspecies belonged. But over time, both as its proponents have clarified\nwhat the thesis implied (e.g., gravitating to talk of historical\nentities rather than individuals) and as more sophisticated options\nfor defenders of the view that species are kinds were developed (e.g.,\nBoyd 1999, Griffiths 1999, R.A. Wilson 1999a), this radical edge to\nthe thesis has diminished. A now widely accepted insight clarified in\nthe process is that in the case of many species, organisms belong to\nthem (as parts or members) by virtue of their interactions and their\nextrinsic rather than intrinsic properties (Barker 2010; cf. Devitt\n2008). Whether this combats (or instead exemplifies) what the\nhistorian James Elwick has recently called \u201cresilient\nessentialisms\u201d (Elwick 2017; cf. Hull 1965) remains contentious.\n\n\nFinally here, Mariscal and Doolittle (forthcoming) have recently\nsuggested that all of life, i.e., the Last Universal Common Ancestor\nand all of its descendants, is a biological individual in the sense in\nwhich Ghiselin and Hull argued that species were. They take life to be\n\u201ca monophyletic clade that originated with a last universal\ncommon ancestor, and includes all of its descendants\u201d\n(forthcoming: abstract). Complementing this is their adaption of\nEreshefsky\u2019s (1992) eliminative pluralism about living things as\na kind, arguing for eliminativism about living things as a natural\nkind. \n6. From Physiological to Evolutionary Individuals: Life, Reproduction, and Agency\n\nSection 3\n indicated that John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry drew\nexplicitly on the concept of living organisms in\ncharacterizing the chief theme of their influential work on the major\ntransitions in the history of life. However, reflection on organisms\nas living agents generally has been backgrounded in work concentrating\non evolutionary individuals. This is perhaps for the obvious reason\nthat many evolutionary individuals\u2014including genes, lineages,\nand clades\u2014are not themselves living things. Yet physiological\nindividuals are paradigms of living agents and a more complete sense\nof the conceptual space that biological individuals occupy calls for\nsome discussion of life, including the roles that an appeal to life\ncycles and agency play in characterizing physiological individuals.\n\n6.1 Physiological Individuals as Living Agents\n\nOne approach here would be to attempt to define life, or living agent,\nor to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these (Maynard\nSmith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 17\u201318; Cleland 2012). A\nrecurrent property in such definitions is that of having a\nmetabolism, which involves both an anabolic dimension in\nthe breakdown of chemical molecules to produce energy and a\ncatabolic dimension in intracellular synthesis of those\ncompounds (Pradeu 2016b: 801). But there are other properties that\nliving agents have, some presupposed by that of having a metabolism,\nothers existing independently. These include what might be thought of\nas structural properties\u2014such as having heterogeneous\nand specialized parts, including a variety of internal mechanisms, and\ncontaining diverse organic molecules, including nucleic acids and\nproteins\u2014as well as functional or\ndispositional properties\u2014such as the capacity for\ngrowth or development, reproduction, and self-repair.\n\nCells, organs, and perhaps bodily systems, such as the respiratory\nsystem or the digestive system, are physiological individuals that\nhave most if not all of these properties that characterize living\nagents. As physiological individuals, organisms also share these\nproperties, but are distinguished by one or more further\ncharacteristics, such as possessing an immune system (as Pradeu\nemphasizes) or having a life cycle, one that is typically\ndemarcated through reproduction, which is the focus of\n section 6.2\n below.\n\nConceiving of physiological individuals as living agents, and\nsupposing that all organisms are living agents but that there may be\nboth parts and groups of organisms that are not, allows us to extend\nthe visual summary introduced in\n Figure 2.\n Figure 3 depicts organisms as living agents but also contains\nregions for organs such as hearts and other constituent parts of\norganisms as living agents, as well as groups that may be living\nagents but not organisms (e.g., perhaps a coral reef).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Living Things as Biological\nIndividuals. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n6.2 Reproduction, Life Cycles, and Lineages\n\nOne feature of organismic, physiological individuals that partially\ndistinguishes them amongst living things is that they have life\ncycles that allow them to form reproductive lineages of a certain\nkind. The importance of life cycles for evolutionary change has been\nrecognized both in the replicator-based view of evolutionary\nindividuals (Dawkins 1989: ch.13) and in reproductively-centered\naccounts of Darwinian individuals (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2016a). And the\nclose relationship between being an individual organism and having a\nlife cycle is widely accepted, being manifested in an extreme form by\nGriffiths and Gray\u2019s (1994) identification of biological\nindividuals with their life cycles within developmental systems\ntheory.\n\nPut most generally, a life cycle is an intergenerationally replicable\nseries of events or stages through which a living thing passes (Bonner\n1993). These events or stages constitute a cycle in that they\nbegin and end with the same event, such as the formation of a\nfertilized egg in sexually reproducing individuals, or the creation of\na fissioned cell in clonally reproducing individuals.\nDevelopment is the global name for the processes that\ncausally mediate between these events or stages in a life cycle, with\nreproduction marking the transition to the creation of a new\nindividual, the offspring of one or more parents. Although Richard\nDawkins\u2019s suspicion \n\n\nthat the essential, defining feature of an individual organism\nis that it is a unit that begins and ends with a\nsingle-celled bottleneck (1989: 264) \n\n\nhas proven hyperbolic, the more cautious view that the \u201ctwo\nphenomena, bottlenecked life cycles and discrete organisms, go hand in\nhand\u201d (1989: 264) expresses a view that has been widely\nendorsed.\n\nIt has long been recognized that some biological individuals, such as\nflukes, have life cycles that take them literally through one or more\nhosts, and that many insects undergo significant metamorphic changes\nin bodily form through their life cycle. But such sophistications to\nlife cycles are only the tip of the iceberg here. While the stages\nthemselves often form standard sequences within particular species,\nthere can be tremendous variation across species and phyla in what a\ngiven individual\u2019s life cycle consists in, as others have\nemphasized (Buss 1987), including in recent discussions of complex\nlife cycles (Godfrey-Smith 2016b, 2016d; Griesemer 2016; Herron 2016; O\u2019Malley 2016; cf.\nGerber 2018). \n\nIn the life cycles that are most immediately familiar, processes that\nmark the end of one life cycle and the beginning of another of the\nsame kind of individual\u2014processes such as material\nbottlenecking, sexual reproduction, and\nmultiplication\u2014temporally coalesce. In the life cycles of other\nindividuals, such as ferns and scyphozoan jellyfish, these processes\nare sometimes dispersed, function differently, or are absent\n(Godfrey-Smith 2016a, 2016b). Such cases call for a corresponding\nsophistication of accounts of reproduction and, as James Griesemer\nsays, these complexities in life cycles may \n\n\ncomplicate relations between processes of development and reproduction\nto such an extent that even the meaning of \u2018organism\u2019\nbegins to break down. (Griesemer 2016: 804) \n\n\nMaureen O\u2019Malley (2016) has drawn attention to other cases that\npose more radical challenges to the standard ways of thinking of life\ncycles themselves. An example is the asexually reproducing,\nmulticellular protist Volvox carteri (green algae), whose\n\u201csexual phase of the life cycle is nonreproductive because there\nis no multiplication\u201d (O\u2019Malley 2016: 838). This kind of\nsexual recombination occurring between members of asexually\nreproducing generations takes on a striking form in ciliates, such as\nTetrahymena, whose micronucleus provides germ-line isolation.\nWhether O\u2019Malley\u2019s concept of multigenerational\nindividuals can be squared with extensions of standard views of\nreproduction and life cycles remains subject to further\nexploration.\n\nAlthough there is a relationship between having a life cycle and\nreproducing, simply reproducing is not the distinctive\nfeature here, as a number of authors have recognized (Griesemer 2014,\nGodfrey-Smith 2013, O\u2019Malley 2016, R.A. Wilson 2005). Organisms\nand perhaps other biological individuals typically reproduce through\nmaterial overlap (Griesemer 2000), or via bottlenecks requiring\nmaterial minimalization and mark the transition between generations\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: ch.5). These kinds of constraints on biological\nreproduction go hand in hand with growth and development as part of\nthe intergenerational life cycle of biological individuals.\nIntergenerational life cycles, in turn, make it possible for\nbiological individuals to form reproductive lineages of\nliving things. Reproduction structures not only such lineages, but\nalso the lineages of non-living biological individuals,\nwhether they be smaller than the individuals they are parts of (such\nas genes), or groups (such as populations) that feature centrally in\ndiscussions of evolutionary individuals.\n\nAlthough reproduction itself has sometimes been conceptualized as part\nof the life cycle of biological individuals, the role of reproduction\nin intergenerational life cycles in general requires more careful\narticulation. For there are many species in which only a small\nminority of individuals actually get to reproduce, with reproductive\nskew being a widespread feature. Meanwhile it seems clear that all of\nthese biological individuals, however much or little they reproduce,\nstill possess a life cycle. Note that even the capacity to\nreproduce is not a universal feature of life cycles. This is not only\nbecause the capacity itself may not be replicated, but also because\nthere are biological individuals designed by natural\nselection to be non-reproductive, with sterile castes in eusocial\ninsects being perhaps the best-known example. \n\nIn such species, a few individuals (e.g., queens) do most if not all\nof the direct reproductive labor, and many others are rendered\nreproductively sterile throughout all or much of their life (e.g.,\nworker castes). So there are reasons to include neither reproduction\nnor the capacity to reproduce as part of the generic life cycle of\nbiological individuals. What is true, however, is that all organisms\nhave life cycles that allow them to form reproductive lineages. They\ndo so sometimes through the reproductive activity of members of the\nlineage to which they belong, even if not every member of that lineage\nreproduces or even can reproduce. Like viruses, individual members of\nsterile castes of insects rely on the reproductive machinery of\nothers in order for descendant members of those castes to be\nreproduced in future generations.\n\nThis is an example of what Godfrey-Smith (2009: ch.5) calls\nscaffolded reproducers, \u201centities which get reproduced\nas part of the reproduction of some larger unit\u201d and whose\n\u201creproduction is dependent on an elaborate scaffolding of some\nkind that is external to them\u201d (2009: 88). These contrast with\nwhat he calls simple reproducers, a paradigm of which is a\nbacterial cell, being \u201cthe lowest-level entities that can\nreproduce largely \u2018under their own steam\u2019\u201d (2009:\n88). Both simple and scaffolded reproducers can be parts of what\nGodfrey-Smith calls collective reproducers, which are \n\n\nreproducing entities with parts that themselves have the capacity to\nreproduce \u2026 largely through their own [the parts\u2019]\nresources rather than through the coordinated activity of the whole.\n(2009: 87) \n\n\nBoth groups and multicellular organisms exemplify collective\nreproduction, and Godfrey-Smith\u2019s discussion of the continuous\ndimensional space that characterizes collective reproducers, and\nDarwinian individuals more generally, has been influential, and is\nsummarily depicted in\n Figure 4\n below. \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Godfrey-Smith\u2019s\nDimensional Space for Collective Reproduction. (From Figure 5.1 in\nGodfrey-Smith 2009.) [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n6.3 Autonomous Agency\n\nThat all physiological individuals have some kind of autonomous agency\nis widely recognized and is the intuitive basis for the early\nsystematic formal theorization of biological autonomy undertaken on\nautopoetic systems by Maturana and Varela (1980) and more recently by Moreno\nand Mossio (2015). Although such views are typically cast in terms of\nbiological systems rather than individuals, they view the\nkind of unity of purpose that characterizes both physiological and\nevolutionary individuals as arising from more general principles\ngoverning biological organization, and that organization is important\nto biological individuality.\n\nPhysiological individuals such as organisms, however, are not simply\nbiological systems but living agents that have a life of their\nown. They are able to exercise some sort of special degree of\ncontrol over their whole selves and subsequently are relatively free\nwith respect to other things, including other agents and environments.\nThis might be expressed in terms of both the individual\u2019s\nrelative autonomy from its external environment and its control over\nthe activity of its components or internal parts (R.A. Wilson 2005:\n62\u201365). Organisms in particular have a distinctive kind of\nagency because of the integrity with which such autonomy and control\nimbues them. For Moreno and Mossio (2015: ch.6), developmental\nfunctions and constraints play an especially important role in\nestablishing this kind of organismic autonomy.\n\nThe idea of biological individuals having a locus of control\nin ways that neither non-living things nor obligately-dependent living\nthings (such as organs) have is key here. Pradeu\u2019s (2012) view\nof immunological control as marking the boundary of the biological\nindividual is one way of specifying this idea, as is\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s continuous dimension of integration,\nwhich summarizes features such as \n\n\nthe extent of division of labor, the mutual dependence (loss of\nautonomy) of parts, and the maintenance of a boundary between a\ncollective and what is outside of it. (2009: 93) \n\n\nThe high level of functional integration or cohesion possessed by\nparts of individuals imbues the whole organisms they\nconstitute with both capacities to act and largely shared fates to\nwhich those capacities contribute (Collier 2004; Okasha 2011: 59;\nSober 1991: 291). In some sense, this is why any organism has a life\nto lead, rather than simply being alive.\n\nThis appeal to autonomous agency has a long history in thinking about\nwhat is distinctive about the biological world, particularly when the\nfocus has been on physiological individuals. For example, in the first\nvolume of his Principles of Biology (1866), Herbert Spencer\nargued at length that the capacity of a biological individual to \n\n\ncontinuously adjust its internal relations to\nexternal relations, so as to maintain the equilibrium of its\nfunctions (1866: 207, our emphasis) \n\n\nis one of the key features that sets it apart as biological. Likewise\nwhen Julian Huxley later proposed three conditions of what he called\nminimal organismality, one of these concerned integration of\ninternal functions and a second concerned independence from\nexternal forces (Huxley 1912: 28). Like Spencer, Huxley saw\nthese internal and external matters as causally linked within\nindividuals, and as together achieving equilibria in distinctive ways.\nHuxley thought this was due especially to the parts of biological\nindividuals being both more heterogeneous and functionally integrated\nwith each other than is seen in the non-biological context external to\nsuch individuals. Two contemporary cousins of this idea in the\nliterature focused on evolutionary individuals will be the focus of\n section 8\n below.\n\nAn interesting, relatively recent question is why the use of\ncognitive metaphors in describing biological agency is\nwidespread, if not ubiquitous (R.A. Wilson 2005: ch.4). Explorations\nof this question have involved some interesting integrative thinking\nacross the philosophy of biology, cognitive science, and the\nphilosophy of economics (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 142\u2013145; Dennett\n2011; Nicholson 2018; Okasha 2018). Four responses to this question\ngive some idea of the diverse literatures relevant to answering it.\n\n\nOne early hypothesis (R.A. Wilson: 2005: 74\u201379) is that the\nfunction of these metaphors is to crystallize agency,\nbringing about a focus on the causal agency of biological individuals\nby assimilating them to our paradigm of agents, human agents. This\ncrystallization thesis forms part of Wilson\u2019s tripartite view of\norganismic living agents (R.A. Wilson 2005: ch.3) that draws on the\nhomeostatic property cluster view of natural kinds (Boyd 1999, R.A.\nWilson, Barker, & Brigandt 2007). A second view is that the\ncognitive metaphor applies when behaviors and processes are\ngoal-directed, behavior is flexible, and there is exhibition of\nadaptation, and the metaphor earns it keep through the parallels\nbetween rational choice theory and evolutionary theorizing (Okasha\n2018). Okasha is concerned to articulate the scope and limits of the\ncognitive metaphor in evolutionary biology, taking organisms as his\nparadigm agents. A third view is that the use of psychological\npredication of the activities of cells, neurons, and bodily systems is\nnot metaphorical but should be taken literally (Figdor\n2018). Figdor\u2019s\nliteralism is a response to what she views as an anthropocentric\nperspective that assumes that human cognition is the standard against\nwhich other uses of psychological ascriptions should be judged.\nFinally, a fourth view is that appeals to the nature of subjectivity\nand point of view are key here (Godfrey-Smith 2019; see also\nGodfrey-Smith 2016c). Godfrey-Smith takes understanding the evolution\nof subjectivity to be central to advancing responses to\n\u201cexplanatory gap\u201d arguments in the philosophy of mind,\nimplying the graduated nature of cognition itself.\n7. Locating Biological Individuals in Conceptual Space\n\nThe discussion in\n section 6\n has drawn out more about the conceptual space that physiological\nindividuals occupy and their relationship to evolutionary individuals.\nThis section offers a more complete and integrative overview of that\nconceptual space. Before populating the running summary diagram with\nexamples of various kinds of biological individuals, we first simply add\nDarwinian or evolutionary individuals to\n Figure 3\n and label the resulting nine regions in it to arrive at\n Figure 5:\n \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Adding Darwinian Individuals.\n[An\n extended description of figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs simple as this modification to\n Figure 3\n is, it allows for much more fine-grained answers to the Focal\nQuestion, both in terms of the relationship between the subsidiary\ncategories living agents, organisms, and Darwinian individuals, and in\nterms of where particular individuals are located in the resulting\nconceptual space. It may turn out that some of these regions are\nunoccupied by actual biological individuals, or that some of the\nadjacent regions collapse into one another. But the following proceeds\nby indicating how the preceding discussion suggests all nine regions\nare exemplified by distinct kinds of biological individual, moving\nfrom less contentious to more contentious examples.\n\nFirst, consider the lower half of\n Figure 5\n and regions 1, 2 and 3. While organisms are both Darwinian\nindividuals and living agents, there are two different types of\nDarwinian individuals that are not living agents: some parts of\norganisms, such as genes (region 2) and, perhaps more controversially,\ngroups such as colonies of eusocial insects (region 3). For example,\nhoney bee colonies appear to be Darwinian individuals even though they\nare not literally living agents. Each individual bee within a colony\nis alive, but as suggested by the discussion of living agency in\n section 6,\n it is only by invoking the cognitive metaphor that the whole colony\nitself can be said to be a living agent.\n\nSecond, consider the outermost regions to the left and right of\n Figure 5,\n regions 4 and 5. There are both some parts and some groups of\norganisms that are neither organisms nor Darwinian individuals nor\nliving agents. Most parts of the cellular machinery possessed by\norganisms, such as lysosomes (region 4) or ribosomes, are biological\nindividuals that, like genes, are not living agents, but unlike them,\nare not Darwinian individuals. Groups with this same status include\nhigher taxa, such as species and clades discussed in\n section 4.\n Clades (region 5) are neither organisms nor living agents. And even\nthe most optimistic of clade selectionists will probably agree that a\nrelatively inclusive and diverse taxon such Bryophyta,\nconsisting of about 10,000 moss species, is not itself a Darwinian\nindividual. Yet if the common assumption that monophyletic clades are\na type of biological individual is accepted, Bryophyta will\nnonetheless count as a biological individual (De Luna, Newton, &\nMishler 2003\n Other Internet Resources).\n Bryophyta thus belongs in the far right of\n Figure 5.\n\nThird, consider the upper half of\n Figure 5\n and regions 6 and 7. There are correspondingly two different types of\nliving agents that are not Darwinian individuals: some parts of\norganisms such as hearts (region 6) and (again, perhaps more\ncontroversially), groups of organisms such as coral reefs (region 7).\nAs physiological individuals, hearts are alive but they do not\nreproduce or relate to reproducers in the manner that Darwinian\nindividuals do. As suggested at the end of\n section 6.1,\n a coral reef may also be an example of this kind of biological\nindividual at the group level. Coral reefs don\u2019t feature the\ntype of reproduction-involving life cycles characteristic of\norganisms, and some of the same facts about reproduction likely\ndisqualify them from being Darwinian individuals. Yet perhaps the\nreefs (in addition to their constituent individuals) have a better\nchance than eusocial insect colonies of counting as living agents.\n\nFinally, what of the two remaining regions of\n Figure 5,\n regions 8 and 9? These contain, respectively, biological individuals\nthat are parts of organisms and are both Darwinian individuals and\nliving agents, and organisms that are living agents but not Darwinian\nindividuals. Some viruses are at least plausible candidate examples of\nthe former category (region 8), since they have the internal\ncomplexity and unity of function possessed by physiological\nindividuals but employ a scaffolded form of reproduction that relies\non the replicative machinery of their host. And perhaps corporate\norganisms that are typified by tightly integrated multispecies\ncomplexes exemplify the latter (region 9). Consider again the Hawaiian\nbobtail squid plus its colony of Vibrio fischeri bacteria\nthat Godfrey-Smith (2013) discusses as such an example (see\n Figure 1\n above). Those who view this entity as an organism do so because of\nthe intricate integration between squid and bacteria (Nyholm &\nMcFall-Ngai 2004; Bouchard 2010). As such, it seems to be a living\nagent or physiological individual. But lacking a reproductive life\ncycle, it is not a Darwinian individual. One might well argue, by\ncontrast, that this feature of the squid-Vibrio complex also\ndisqualifies it as an organism, making it no different in\nkind from coral reefs. Resolving this issue will turn partly on how\nexactly different sorts of reproduction are distinguished, and which\nsorts are required for evolution by natural selection, topics that\nhave recently become more intensely debated (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2015,\n2016b; Griesemer 2014, 2016; O\u2019Malley 2016).\n\nFigure 6\n completes this running visual summary of conceptual space that\nbiological individuals occupy, with the addition of a table which\nassociates the regions with the examples discussed above.\n\n\n\n\nRegions with their examples\n\n\nregion\nexample \n\n\n1\nFruit fly\n\n2\nGene\n\n3\nEusocial insect colony\n\n4\nLysosome\n\n5\nClades (such as Bryophyta)\n\n6\nHeart\n\n7\nCoral reef\n\n8\nVirus\n\n9\nSquid+Vibrio bacteria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Biological Individuals in\nConceptual Space. [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n8. Regulating Evolutionary Individuals\n\nIt was noted at the outset that organism and biological\nindividual have been simply equated by several influential\ncontemporary authors (Queller & Strassmann 2009; Clarke 2012).\nThis section explores their views of the regulation of evolutionary\nindividuals. \n\nDavid Queller and Joan Strassmann have provided one agenda for the\nempirical study of what they call \u201cthe evolution of\norganismality\u201d (Queller & Strassmann 2009, 2016; Strassmann\n& Queller 2010). They begin from the claim that the definitive\nfeature of organisms is the combination of high cooperation and low\nconflict between their parts (see also Folse & Roughgarden 2010 on\norganisms). Queller and Strassmann note both that these things are\nmatters of degree and that one can vary independently of the other.\nThey use these parameters to define a two-dimensional space that\nrepresents a variety of biological individuals, as\n Figure 7\n illustrates.\n\n\n\n\n7a: Groups of cells\n\n\n\n\n7b: Groups of multi-cellular\nindividuals\n\n\nFigure 7: Varying Degrees of Conflict\nand Cooperation (From Fig. 1 & 2, Queller & Strassmann 2009).\n[An\n extended description of figure 7 (a and b)\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nTo capture these ideas, it is useful to think of the feature that\nQueller and Strassmann believe is definitive of biological individuals\nas the internal ratio: it is the ratio of the level of\ncooperation between internal parts of individuals to that of the\nconflict between them. The higher this ratio is, the higher the degree\nof individuality. Figure 7a indicates that, relative to other groups\nof cells, a mouse will have a relatively large internal ratio, while a\nyeast floc will have a relatively small internal ratio. \n\nSince the internal ratio considers only the level of internal control\nwithin a biological individual, focusing on it alone neglects the\nother aspect of autonomous agency that arose in\n section 6.3:\n freedom from external influence. This external dimension to\nindividuality can also be thought of as involving a ratio between\ncooperation and conflict\u2014not between the parts of the individual\nbut between that individual and other individuals that it interacts\nwith. Just as an individual with a relatively large internal ratio has\na higher level of individuality, according to Queller and Strassmann,\nso too would an individual with a low external ratio, i.e.,\none in which external cooperation was low and external conflict was\nhigh. To extend Queller and Strassmann\u2019s idea along these lines,\nthe measure of the level of individuality would be a type of meta\nratio: the ratio between the internal and external ratios. \n\nThis extension of Queller and Strassmann\u2019s view of individuality\nmay prove useful in fleshing out more details of what Godfrey-Smith\n(borrowing a term of Huxley\u2019s) calls the movement of\nindividuality (2013: 33). This refers to the ways in which new\nkinds of individual evolve slowly, over geological time scales, from\nrecurring collaborations between different types of Darwinian\nindividuals. Such partnerships sometimes lead to new examples of\nparadigm individuals, but other times falter or stall at the mere\ncollaboration stage with no new individuals at all. Closure of a\npathway to a higher degree of individuality could be brought about by\neither a drop in the internal ratio (reduced individuality because of\ninternal matters) or a rise in the external ratio (reduced individuality\nbecause of external matters).\n\nIn effect, Queller and Strassmann have proposed a view of evolutionary\nindividuals that is exclusively focused on the regulation of the parts\nof an evolutionary individual as a means to avoiding subversion from\nwithin. In a series of papers, Ellen Clarke has developed a more\nintegrative view of evolutionary individuals that develops this\nregulative dimension to biological individuality (Clarke 2010, 2012,\n2013, 2016a, 2016b). In work focused on plant individuality, Clarke\nemphasizes the mechanisms that constrain either sources of\nheritable variation, such as niche construction, bottlenecks, and\npolyploidy, or fitness differences, such as investment in root\nconnections and the synchronization of flowering (2012: 351, 356).\nClarke then argues that something is an evolutionary individual if and\nonly if it possesses what she calls policing and\ndemarcating mechanisms (2013: 427). \n\nA policing mechanism \u201cis any mechanism that inhibits the\ncapacity of an object to undergo within-object selection\u201d\n(Clarke 2013: 421), typically by decreasing the genetic variation\nbetween parts of an object. This decreases the chance that\nthe object\u2019s parts will undergo selection that disrupts the\nintegration of those parts. There is a sense in which demarcating\nmechanisms operate in just the opposite way. Rather than working to\nconstrain or limit selective processes amongst an individual\u2019s\nparts, a demarcating mechanism \u201cincreases or maintains the\ncapacity of an object to undergo between-object selection\u201d\n(2013: 424), doing so by promoting the variation (between objects)\nthat fuels selection.\n\nFor Clarke, it is what these two sorts of mechanisms do that\nis important, not how the mechanisms do this in various ways\n(Clarke 2013: 429). In other words, it is only the functions\nof the mechanisms that Clarke thinks are definitive, not the various\nmaterial ways those functions are realized. As Clarke\nstresses, this implies the multiple realizability of evolutionary\nindividuals. This \u201cthoroughgoing functionalism about\nindividuality\u201d (Sterner 2015: 610) abstracts away from specific\nrealizations of the functional roles of policing and demarcation. In\nthis respect, Clarke\u2019s view contrasts with many other views of\nevolutionary individuals that emphasize the importance of particular\nways in which these mechanisms are realized. For example, Dawkins,\nMaynard-Smith, and Bonner imply that certain material\nbottlenecks\u2014narrowings between generations exemplified by our\nown single-celled, zygotic bottleneck\u2014are essential ways for\npolicing to be realized in evolutionary individuals (Clarke 2013:\n418\u2013419), while Ratcliffe and Kirk instead make material\ngerm-soma separation essential (Clarke 2013: 420).\n\nClarke\u2019s functionalism thus leads her to reject \u201cthe\nbottleneck condition\u201d as strictly necessary for evolutionary\nindividuality, a condition that Marc Ereshefsky and Makmiller Pedroso\nalso reject as part of their defense of the view that multispecies\nbiofilms are evolutionary individuals (Ereshefsky &\nPedroso 2013, 2015). Clarke\u2019s functionalism thus in principle\nfacilitates the search for alternative mechanisms\u2014perhaps such\nas lateral gene transfer in the case of biofilms\u2014that serve that\nfunction in contexts where the usual material bottlenecks are not\npresent. \n\nThis makes all the more interesting Clarke\u2019s own disagreement\nwith those who have defended the idea that biofilms are evolutionary\nindividuals (Clarke 2016a), wherein she argues that many of the\nimportant claims that underpin ascriptions of multicellularity to\nbiofilms\u2014such as that they are physiologically unified systems\nor contain cells that interact synergistically\u2014are either not\nverifiable (e.g., they have higher-level adaptions) or are false\n(e.g., they display heritable variation in fitness). While\nClarke\u2019s functionalism means that she remains open to the\nsuggestion that there may be some non-genetic form of heritability in\nbiofilms (Doolittle 2013), she takes the relevant empirical evidence\nhere to be indecisive (Clarke 2016a: 202).\n9. The Evolution of Biological Individuality\n\nFinally, the evolution of biological individuality continues to be a\nlively topic (Okasha 2011; Calcott & Sterelny 2011; Bourrat 2015;\nClarke 2016b; O\u2019Malley & Powell 2016; Queller &\nStrassmann 2016; Herron 2017; Sterner 2017). The starting point here\nis the idea that the history of life is the history of the\nconstruction of more complicated biological individuals from simpler\nindividuals, with natural selection (operating at one or more levels)\nfacilitating the transitions between these individuals. Underlying\nthese ideas is the assumption that many or all biological individuals\nare hierarchically organized: earlier individuals provide the material\nbasis for later individuals. For example, prokaryotes, which are\nsingle-celled organisms without a nucleus, form the material basis for\nsingle-celled eukaryotes, which do have a nucleus; in turn,\nsingle-celled eukaryotes serve as the material basis for multicellular\neukaryotes.\n\nThe evolution of biological individuals from prokaryotes to\nsingle-celled eukaryotes around 2 billion years ago, and from those to\nmulticellular eukaryotes in the last 600\u2013800 million years, are\nestablished facts. In addition, there appear to be no counter-examples\nto this evolutionary trend. Yet speculation and controversy surround\nalmost everything else that has been said about these evolutionary\ntransitions. Consider three such issues on which there is a sort of\ndefault position in the literature that remains subject to ongoing\nphilosophical and empirical interrogation.\n\nFirst, it is common to view the evolution of individuality itself as\nthe evolution of complexity. There are, however, questions both about\nhow complexity itself should be measured or conceived and about what\nempirical evidence there is for viewing the complexity of individuals\nas increasing over evolutionary time (McShea 1991). Are the number of\ncell types that an individual has considered (Bonner 1988), the types\nof hierarchical organization it manifests (Maynard Smith 1988), or\nsome more taxa-specific criterion, such as the information required to\nspecify the diversity of limb-pair types (Cisne 1974)? Fossils\nconstitute a principal source for the criteria that have been proposed\nhere. Yet different kinds of organisms leave fossils with distinct\nkinds of features, and some kinds of organisms are more likely to\nleave fossils than are others.\n\nOne natural suggestion is that there may well be different kinds of\nhierarchies for the evolution of individuality, since kinds of\nindividuals can differ from one another in more than one way. Daniel\nMcShea (2001a, 2001b; McShea & Changizi 2003) has proposed a\nstructural hierarchy that is based on two components, the number of\nlevels of nestedness and the degree to which the highest individual in\nthe nesting is individuated or developed. McShea provides an\noverarching framework in which eukaryotic cells can be viewed as\nevolving from differentiated aggregations of prokaryotic cells that\nhave intermediate parts; multicellular eukaryotes as evolving from\ndifferentiated aggregations of single-celled eukaryotes; and colonial\neukaryotes as evolving from differentiated aggregations of\nmulticellular eukaryotes.\n\nBy contrast, Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry (1995) focus on\ndifferences in how genetic information is transmitted across\ngenerations, proposing eight major transitions in the history of life.\nThese start with the transition from replicating molecules to\ncompartmentalized populations of such molecules, and end with the\ntransition from primate societies to human societies. While Maynard\nSmith and Szathm\u00e1ry are interested in individuality and\ncomplexity, their eight transitions do not form a continuous,\nnon-overlapping hierarchy. Their discussion is focused primarily on\nexploring the processes governing each of the particular transitions\nthey propose in terms of changes in replicative control.\nO\u2019Malley and Powell (2016) have recently argued that not only\ndoes this perspective omit critical events\u2014such as the\nacquisition of mitochondria and plastids, in what those authors prefer\nto think of as turns rather than transitions in the evolution of\nliving things\u2014but also that what is needed is a \n\n\nsupplementary perspective that is less hierarchical, less focused on\nmulticellular events, less replication oriented, and in particular,\nmore metabolic. (O\u2019Malley and Powell 2016: 175)\n\n\nSecond, it is common to view the trend from prokaryotes to\nmulticellular eukaryotes as resulting from some type of directional\nbias, one that makes the trend a tendency supported by underlying\nmechanisms and constraints. Perhaps the tendency is underwritten by\nthermodynamic, energetic considerations, by facts about the generative\nentrenchment of developmental systems (Griffiths & Gray 2001), or\nby evolutionary advantages of increases in size (McShea 1998). But in\nsupposing that there is some type of directional bias, each of these\nhypotheses might be thought committed to the sort of Panglossianism\nabout adaptation that Gould and Lewontin (1979) are famous for\ncritiquing, or (more subtly) to a view of evolutionary change as\nprogressive or inevitable in some way. Gould has used his discussion\nof the Burgess Shale (Gould 1989) to challenge such views of\nevolution, arguing that the disparity of the fossils in that shale\nindicates that living things are significantly less different\nfrom one another than they once were. Gould argues that the range of\nbiological individuals now on the planet is largely the result of\nhighly contingent extinction events, and there should be wariness of\nimmediately assuming that observed trends or patterns are adaptive (or\nother) tendencies.\n\nThird, many authors have recognized that whatever trends or tendencies\nthere are in the evolution of individuals, there have also been\nchanges over evolutionary time in the social relations between\nindividuals (e.g., Frank 1998), and in the sorts of shared resources\nthat are available to the biological individuals that Douglas Erwin\nhas recently discussed while drawing on the economic concepts of\npublic goods and club goods (Erwin 2015, McInerney\n& Erwin 2017). Yet how sociality should be integrated into a view\nof the evolution of biological individuals remains under-theorized\n(for recent exceptions, see Birch 2017 and Okasha 2018). And however\nlimited fossil evidence for individual structures and ecological\nniches may be, such evidence for the kinds and extent of sociality is\nsignificantly more sparse. Much of the work to be done here seems\ndistinctly philosophical in that it concerns how sociality is\nconceptualized. Should one accept the simple aggregation of\nindividuals as a basic form of sociality? Does sociality essentially\ninvolve some form of cooperation, and if not, what is the relationship\nbetween \u201cprosocial\u201d sociality and antagonistic forms of\nsociality (e.g., competition or predation)? Although the\n\u201cevolution of sociality\u201d has been taken up by animal\nbiologists (especially by primatologists) and evolutionary\nanthropologists (where it is often viewed game-theoretically), this\nhas served to reinforce a view of sociality that seems somewhat\nnarrow, e.g., the view is not clearly applicable to structurally\nsimpler individuals. Perhaps the idea that sociality is not a\nrelatively recent addition to multicellular life needs to be taken\nseriously. Instead, sociality may be a more sweeping feature of many\nif not all biological individuals, with the evolution of individuality\nunderstood in tandem with the idea of changing, shared, public and\nclub goods. This would make for a more dynamic and cyclical view of\nthe history of life than has been assumed in past thinking about\nbiological individuals.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackerman, Jennifer, 2012, \u201cThe Ultimate Social\nNetwork\u201d, <em>Scientific American</em>, 306(6):\n36\u201343.", "Andersson, Jan O., 2000, \u201cEvolutionary Genomics: Is Buchnera\na Bacterium or an Organelle?\u201d, <em>Current Biology</em>, 10(23):\nR866\u2013R868. doi:10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00816-2", "Barker, Matthew\u00a0J., 2010, \u201cSpecious Intrinsicalism\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 77(1): 73\u201391.\ndoi:10.1086/650209", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013, \u201cEssentialism\u201d, in\n<em>Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences</em>, Byron\nKaldis (ed.), Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 270\u2013275.\ndoi:10.4135/9781452276052.n107", "Barker, Matthew J. and Robert A.
