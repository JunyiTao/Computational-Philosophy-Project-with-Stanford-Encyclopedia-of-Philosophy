    "main_text": "Demonstrative Pronouns\n6. Demonstrative Pronouns\n\n\nPriscian made a strong connection between the proper name and the\npronoun (pronomen), saying that the pronoun is taken in place\nof a proper name. It also has a kind of primacy over the proper\nname. As Priscian said, even if we know that Virgil is a man and a\npoet, we won\u2019t be able to identify him (assuming we are in his\npresence) unless someone says \u201cThis is Virgil.\u201d  The type\nof pronoun we are interested in here is what medieval grammarians\ncalled the primitive (non-derived) demonstrative pronoun, which\nincludes personal pronouns such as \u2018I\u2019 and demonstratives\nsuch as \u2018this\u2019. Demonstration (construed as\n\u2018pointing to\u2019) can be either direct, when something is\nbefore one\u2019s eyes, or intellectual, or a mixture of the two.  Leaving\naside intellectual demonstration, which occurs when an object is\nincorporeal or absent (see \u00a78), we can note that the use of a\ndemonstrative pronoun in normal circumstances has the implication that\nthe object pointed to must be present to the speaker.\n\n\nThe standard case is represented by \u2018this\u2019 or by\n\u2018this man\u2019, and the mental correlate in both cases is a\ncommon concept singularized by a demonstrative act. Because\n\u2018this\u2019 is tied to particular demonstrative acts, Buridan,\nlike many other logicians in the fourteenth, fifteenth and early\nsixteenth centuries, took it that genuine referring uses of the phrase\n\u2018this man\u2019 are equivocal. What I signify when I say\n\u2018this man\u2019 pointing to Socrates is quite different from\nwhat you signify when you say \u2018this man\u2019 pointing to\nPlato, and every use of the phrase requires a new imposition.  As Soto\npointed out, this is quite compatible with the claim that \u2018this\nman\u2019 has an unchanging general sense which is understood by all\nspeakers of Latin.  It is also compatible with failures of reference\nof various sorts, as Buridan and others frequently remarked. I can say\n\u2018this man\u2019 and point to a donkey, or to\nnothing. Similarly, I can utter \u2018this chimera\u2019, a phrase\nwhich can never have a referent, given that chimeras are impossible\nobjects.\n\n\nOne might suppose that mere pointing is all that a demonstrative\npronoun does, and certainly Priscian had claimed that while the name\nsignifies substance with quality, that is, a referent plus its nature,\nthe pronoun signifies substance without quality, that is, a bare\nreferent (cf. \u00a78).  However, medieval grammarians and logicians\ntended to demand some identification of the object denoted. One\ncontext for the demand is found in the discussion of constructions\nmixing first-person pronouns and first-person verb forms with proper\nnames, which were counted as third-personal. Priscian took such\nlocutions as \u201cPriscian read\u201d (Priscianus lego) to\nbe ill-formed, and preferred the expansion, \u201cI Priscian\nread\u201d (Ego Priscianus lego). In his discussion of this\nsentence, Peter Helias placed the emphasis on the presence of\n\u2018I\u2019. He explained that \u201cI\u201d cannot pick out a\nform, so \u2018Priscian\u2019 has to be supplied in order for there\nto be a perfect subject. Nearly two and a half centuries later John\nDorp appealed to the same grammatical doctrine in order to explain\nthat the sense of the spoken phrase \u201cI run\u201d is either\n\u201cI John run\u201d or \u201cI, a man, run.\u201d The mental\ncorrelate of a personal pronoun must involve an identifying concept,\nwhether singular or universal.\n\n\nFor Dorp and other later logicians ordinary demonstrative pronouns\nsuch as \u2018this\u2019 similarly require the presence of an\nidentifying concept. This raised the issue of what in the mind\ncorresponds to the pronoun itself, an issue which relates to the more\ngeneral issue of the mental correlate of syncategorematic terms, that\nis, terms which perform some logical function, as opposed to\ncategorematic terms, or terms such as nouns and adjectives, which fall\nunder Aristotle\u2019s categories. Some people apparently held that there\nare no pronouns in the mind.  Hence one can argue that a demonstrative\npronoun is a disguised categorematic term, and that the mental\ncorrelate of \u201cThis man runs\u201d is \u201cThe man Socrates\nruns.\u201d On the more common view, pronouns are subordinated to\nspecial demonstrative or relative acts in the mind. If the pronoun is\njoined to a noun in the spoken phrase, then it represents a purely\nsyncategorematic act in the mind. If it appears alone in the spoken\nphrase, there are two possibilities, as John Dorp argued. It can be\ntaken to be subordinated to a mental phrase containing both a\nsyncategorematic act and a name, and this case would be\nlegitimate. Alternatively, it could be taken as purely\nsyncategorematic, and this use would be illegitimate, because there\nwould be no sign of the thing pointed to, and a purely\nsyncategorematic term cannot be the subject of a proposition. You\ncannot successfully think \u201cThis is running\u201d without\nidentifying the \u2018this\u2019 in some way.  However, it seems\nthat the identification need not involve a sortal concept. A singular\nconcept is enough. \n",
