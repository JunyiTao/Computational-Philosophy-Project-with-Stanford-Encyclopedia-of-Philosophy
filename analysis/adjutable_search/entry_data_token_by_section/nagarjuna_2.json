Arguments against svabh\u0101va\n\nAs we noted earlier the understanding of svabh\u0101va in\nterms of substance (which is rejected by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna)\nconceives of it as an end-point in a series of dependence relations.\nVarious kinds of dependence relations are discussed in the Madhyamaka\nliterature; the most important ones for our purposes are mereological\ndependence (the dependence of a composite object on its parts), causal\ndependence (the dependence of an effect on its cause) and conceptual\ndependence (the dependence of an object on the conceptualizing mind).\nFor the Madhyamaka these dependence relations are equivalent to the\nextent that none ever bottoms out. They do have different weight in\ntheir philosophical argumentation, however, since only establishing\nthat conceptual dependence does not have a foundation is sufficient\nfor establishing the absence of svabh\u0101va in the\ncomprehensive sense intended by the Madhyamaka philosophers. Even if\nthere was no foundation for mereological dependence, i.e. even if\nthere were no partless particles, or no foundation of causal\ndependence, i.e. no first cause there would still remain an important\nsense in which things exist substantially, namely independent of human\ncognition and conceptualization. Only if we can show that no objects\nexist independently with respect to conceptual dependence are we able\nto establish N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s anti-foundationalism in the\nfull sense.\n\nIt is interesting to note that despite the fact that arguing for the\nnon-existence of svabh\u0101va and the establishment of the\ntheory of universal emptiness is the central concern of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s philosophy we do not find a \u201cmaster\nargument\u201d to accomplish this (see Siderits 2000: 228 and 2003:\n147). Of course we do find systematic lists of the core Madhyamaka\narguments, in particular in the later scholastic developments of this\nschool but none of them is regarded as the single argument that\nsettles the matter once and for all. The reason for this comes\ndirectly from the comprehensive rejection of svabh\u0101va.\nIf nothing has its nature intrinsically and independently there can\nalso be no argument for a particular thesis that by its very nature\nestablishes its conclusion independent of the context in which it is\nmade and independent of the audience towards which it is directed. The\nMadhyamaka refutation of svabh\u0101va must proceed in a\nstep-by-step manner. If there is someone who believes that some\nobjects of kind x exist substantially the Madhyamaka will\nproduce an argument to show that these objects really lack\nsvabh\u0101va. For another opponent, who thinks that not the\nxs but the ys are substantial a different argument\nhas to be used. It is plausible, however, that there are certain areas\nof human thought in which human beings inevitably superimpose\nsvabh\u0101va on things which in fact lack it. A great deal\nof Madhyamaka literature is devoted to the discussion of these, and to\narguments showing their lack of svabh\u0101va. The following\nsection will examine some of these areas more closely.\n",
