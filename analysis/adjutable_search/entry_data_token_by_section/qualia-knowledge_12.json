But an influential alternative approach sees the argument\nas working not against physicalism per se, but against a different\nposition which can be termed\n objectivism.[7]\n Objectivism is the view that an objective description of what exists\ncan be complete; that there are no aspects of reality which can only\nbe understood by having experiences of a specific type. This notion is\nclosely related to Nagel\u2019s characterization of the physical nature\nof organisms as \u201ca domain of objective facts par\nexcellence \u2013 the kind that can be observed and understood\nfrom many points of view and by individuals with differing perceptual\nsystems\u201d (1974, 442). On this view, the point of Jackson\u2019s\nthought experiment is to bring out that Mary learns something which\ncan only be known by having an experience of a certain kind (e.g., a\nperceptual experience). If this is correct, then this shows that no\nobjective description of what exist can be complete. As Howell\nformulates it, the argument understood in this way runs as\nfollows:\n\nbefore leaving the room, Mary knew all the objective information about\nthe world. When she left the room, she gained further understanding\nabout the world. Therefore, all the objective information about the\nworld is insufficient for a complete understanding of the world (2007,\n147).\n\n\nA number of proponents of this interpretation of the Knowledge\nArgument suggest that it is compatible with a specific form of\nphysicalism, on which all facts are physical or metaphysically\nnecessitated by microphysical facts but some facts can only be\nunderstood by having specific experiences (see, e.g., Kallestrup 2006;\nHowell 2007; for slightly different formulations see Crane 2003; Zhao\n2012). That said, it is worth asking how the \u2018physical\u2019 is\nto be understood, such that facts which can only be known if one has\ncertain experiences can count as physical. Furthermore, it is worth\nquestioning whether a view on which facts are either physical or\nmetaphysically necessitated by microphysical facts thereby counts as a\nform of physicalism. It has been argued that such a view is compatible\nwith non-physicalist positions such as emergentism or certain forms of\nethical non-naturalism (see Horgan 1993, 559-566; 2010, 311-314; Crane\n2010; for discussion see Stoljar 2017, section 9).\n",
