    "main_text": "Consciousness of Self and Knowledge of Self || Thesis 4: Referential Machinery of Consciousness of Self\n4.4 Thesis 4: Referential Machinery of Consciousness of Self\n\n\nKant generated the special treatment he needed by focussing first on\nreference to self. Here are some of the things that he said about\nreference to oneself as subject. It is a consciousness of self in\nwhich \u201cnothing manifold is given.\u201d (B135). In the kind of\nreference in which we gain this consciousness of self, we\n\u201cdenote\u201d but do not \u201crepresent\u201d ourselves\n(A382). We designate ourselves without noting \u201cany quality\nwhatsoever\u201d in ourselves (A355). This yields his fourth thesis\nabout consciousness of and knowledge of self.\n\nThe referential machinery used to obtain consciousness of self as\nsubject requires no identifying (or other) ascription of properties to\noneself.\n\n\n\nThis is a remarkably penetrating claim; remember, the study of\nreference and semantics generally is usually thought to have begun only\nwith Frege. Kant is anticipating two important theses about reference\nto self that next saw the light of day only 200 years later.\n\nIn certain kinds of consciousness of self, one can be conscious of\nsomething as oneself without identifying it (or anything) as oneself\nvia properties that one has ascribed to the thing (self-reference\nwithout identification) (Shoemaker\n 1968),[8]\n\n\nand,\n\n\nIn such cases, first-person\n indexicals\n (I, me, my, mine) cannot be analysed out in favour of anything else,\nin particular anything descriptionlike (the essential indexical)\n(Perry 1979). \n\n\nWas Kant actually aware of (1) and/or (2) or had he just stumbled\nacross something that later philosophers recognized as significant?\n\n\nOne standard argument for (1) goes as follows:\nMy use of the word \u2018I\u2019 as the subject of\n[statements such as \u2018I feel pain\u2019 or \u2018I see a\ncanary\u2019] is not due to my having identified as myself something\n[otherwise recognized] of which I know, or believe, or wish to say,\nthat the predicate of my statement applies to it [Shoemaker 1968,\npp.558].\n\n\nA standard argument for (2), that certain indexicals are essential,\ngoes as follows. To know that I wrote a certain book a few\nyears ago, it is not enough to know that someone over six feet tall\nwrote that book, or that someone who teaches philosophy at a particular\nuniversity wrote that book, or \u2026 or \u2026 or \u2026 , for I\ncould know all these things without knowing that it was me who\nhas these properties (and I could know that it was me who\nwrote that book and not know that any of these things are properties of\nme). As Shoemaker puts it,\n\u2026 no matter how detailed a token-reflexive-free\ndescription of a person is, \u2026 it cannot possibly entail that I\nam that person [1968, pp. 560].\n\n\nKant unquestionably articulated the argument for (1):\nIn attaching \u2018I\u2019 to our thoughts, we designate\nthe subject only transcendentally \u2026 without noting in it any\nquality whatsoever\u2014in fact, without knowing anything of it\neither directly or by inference [A355].\n\n\nThis transcendental designation, i.e., referring to oneself\nusing \u2018I\u2019 without \u2018noting any quality\u2019 in\noneself, has some unusual features. One can refer to oneself in a\nvariety of ways, of course: as the person in the mirror, as the person\nborn on such and such a date in such and such a place, as the first\nperson to do X, and so on, but one way of referring to oneself\nis special: it does not require identifying or indeed any ascription to\noneself. So Kant tells\n us.[9]\n\n\nThe question is more complicated with respect to (2). We cannot go\ninto the complexities here (see Brook 2001). Here we will just note\nthree passages in which Kant may be referring to the essential\nindexical or something like it.\nThe subject of the categories cannot by thinking the\ncategories [i.e. applying them to objects] acquire a concept of itself\nas an object of the categories. For in order to think them, its pure\nself-consciousness, which is what was to be explained, must itself be\npresupposed. [B422]\n\n\nThe phrase \u2018its pure self-consciousness\u2019 seems to refer\nto consciousness of oneself as subject. If so, the passage may be\nsaying that judgments about oneself, i.e., ascriptions of properties to\noneself, \u2018presuppose \u2026 pure self-consciousness\u2019,\ni.e., consciousness of oneself via an act of ascription-free\ntranscendental designation.\n\n\nNow compare this, \u201cit is \u2026 very evident that I cannot\nknow as an object that which I must presuppose to know any object\n\u2026 .\u201d (A402), and this,\nThrough this I or he or it (the thing) which thinks,\nnothing further is represented than a transcendental subject of the\nthoughts = X. It is known only through the thoughts which are\nits predicates, and of it, apart from them, we cannot have any concept\nwhatsoever, but can only revolve in a perpetual circle, since any\njudgment upon it has always already made use of its representation.\n[A346=B404]\n\n\nThe last clause is the key one: \u201cany judgment upon it has\nalways already made use of its representation\u201d. Kant seems to be\nsaying that to know that anything is true of me, I must first know that\nit is me of whom it is true. This is something very like the essential\nindexical claim.\n\n\nIf reference to self takes place without \u2018noting any\nproperties\u2019 of oneself, the consciousness that results will also\nhave some special features.\n",
