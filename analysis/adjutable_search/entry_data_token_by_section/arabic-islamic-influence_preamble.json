    "main_text": "\n\nThe Arabic-Latin translation movements in the Middle Ages, which\nparalleled that from Greek into Latin, led to the transformation of\nalmost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world. The\nimpact of Arabic philosophers such as al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b,\nAvicenna and Averroes on Western philosophy was particularly strong in\nnatural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics, but also extended to\nlogic and ethics.\n\nAmong the influential Arabic theories are: the logical distinction\nbetween first and second intentions; the intension and remission of\nelementary forms; the soul\u2019s faculty of estimation and its\nobject, the intentions; the conjunction between human intellect and\nseparate active intellect; the unicity of the material intellect\n(Averroism); naturalistic theories of miracles and prophecy; the\neternity of the world and the concept of eternal creation; the active\nintellect as giver of forms; the first cause as necessary being in\nitself; the emanation of intelligences from the first cause; the\ndistinction between essence and existence; the theory of primary\nconcepts; the concept of human happiness as resulting from perfect\nconjunction of the human intellect with the active intellect.\n",
