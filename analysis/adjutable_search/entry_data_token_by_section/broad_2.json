    "main_text": "Perception || Na\u00efve Realism Delineated\n2.1 Na\u00efve Realism Delineated\n\nBroad\u2019s treatment of perception in The Mind and Its Place in\nNature sets off with a careful description of Na\u00efve Realism.\nAnd this seems a suitable place to begin our exposition of his theory\nof perception. What, then, does Na\u00efve Realism say? To\npre-philosophical reflection perception seem to provide us with some\nsort of immediate cognitive contact with a physical object, for\nexample a bell. Consider a situation where we perceive a bell. Compare\nthis situation with one where we are merely thinking of a bell. There\nis a deep difference between the situations. We could \u201cvaguely\nexpress one part of this difference by saying that in the perceptual\nsituation we are \u2018in more immediate touch with\u2019 the bell\nthan in the thought-situation\u201d (1925, p. 144).\n\nThis rough and ready picture of the Na\u00efve Realist view must,\nhowever, be slightly modified. Suppose we visually perceive an apple.\nClearly there is a sense in which we do not perceive \u201call\u201d\nof the apple. There is a sense in which we are aware of only a\npart of its surface; and we are (in that sense) aware only of\nthe sensible colour of that part but not of its sensible temperature.\nThus perception provides us with a cognitive contact a part of the\napple, but no more. It is, then, strictly speaking only a part of the\napple with which we are acquainted; it is only a part of the\napple that is sensuously manifested to us. (1925, pp.\n148\u201350.)\n\nBroad does not equate or identify the perception of a worldly object\nwith the sort of immediate acquainting awareness we have (or seem to\nhave) with its facing surface (pace Chisholm, 1957, p. 154).\nHe is, on the contrary, careful to point out that the experience\nfeatures more than this awareness: it also has an intentional\ncontent. Broad designates this the external reference of\nthe experience. By virtue of its external reference the experience of\nthe apple represents the sensuously manifested constituent as an\nintegral part of a larger spatio-temporal whole, having a whole array\nof properties not sensuously manifested to us. (1925, pp.\n150\u20134.)\n\nWhat is the nature of the external reference? Broad warns against the\nrisk of unduly \u201cintellectualising\u201d perception. The\nexternal reference is not reached by inference from what is\nsensuously manifested; nor is it a belief or\njudgement simply accompanying the awareness of the manifested\nconstituent: \u201cAt the purely perceptual level, people do not have\nthe special experience called \u2018belief\u2019 or\n\u2018judgment\u2019\u201d (1925, p.\n 153).[1]\n",
