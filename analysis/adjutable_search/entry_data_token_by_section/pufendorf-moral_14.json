    "main_text": "Influence || 18th-Century Presence\n5.3 Eclipse & Rediscovery\n\nKant\u2019s Critical philosophy does not distinguish clearly between\nthe rather different streams of natural law that it is usually thought\nto have surpassed (Hochstrasser 2000, Hartung 1998, Haakonssen 2006).\nIndeed, when Kant arrived on the scene the two had already been\nthoroughly commingled, and the discipline as a whole straddled an\nuncomfortable position between the rational and the empirical. Its\nsituation now became increasingly precarious, as it was subjected to\nepistemological and metaphysical challenges that it had not been\ndesigned to meet, and whose purist, a priori assumptions it would\nreject (Hunter 2001, 2002, 2005). Like much else, Kant effectively\nfolded natural law into the dialectical pre-history of his own system.\nIn fact, he hardly mentions it at all, since it does not fit the\nformal schematic of his conception of the history of philosophy as a\nconflict between dogmatic rationalism and sceptical empiricism. In\nethics, natural law is implicitly dismissed in the critique of\ntechnical and prudential imperatives, and in political philosophy it\nappears similarly wanting in the face of pure Right. To be sure,\nKant\u2019s own views in both areas \u2013 including the notion of\ncategorical obligation, the historical-political mechanism of\n\u2019unsocial sociability\u2019, and the trademark concept of\n\u2018autonomy\u2019 mediated by Rousseau\u2019s General Will\n\u2013 owed significant debts to Pufendorf and the voluntarist\ntradition (Schneewind 1993, 2009, 2010; Kersting 2006). However, since\nhis system gave that problematic a new (in)significance, it did not\nplay an explicit role in his discussions. Kant\u2019s sole mention of\nPufendorf (in the company of Grotius and Vattel) is a vague and\ndismissive reference to the \u201cwretched comforters\u201d\n(leidige Tr\u00f6ster) who are criticized \u2013 in the\nessay on Perpetual Peace (Zum ewigen Frieden, 1795)\n\u2013 for their overly flexible, empirical, and situational\ntreatment of the law of nations (ius gentium). Ironically,\nthat approach (including sovereigns\u2019 resort to prudence and the\nright of necessity) had previously been considered a strength, but\nKant saw it as little more than a recipe for endless war. In its\nplace, he substituted a universal, necessary, and absolute metaphysics\nof right \u2013 albeit in a transcendental vein \u2013 precisely of\nthe sort that the \u2018modern\u2019 natural law theory of Hobbes\nand Pufendorf had originally sought to displace because of its\npernicious social consequences. \n\nThe actual refutation or, rather, historical erasure of natural law\nwas the work of post-Kantian historians like C. F. St\u00e4udlin\n(1761\u20131826), J. G. Buhle (1763\u20131807), and W. G. Tennemann\n(1761\u20131819), whose versions of the history of moral philosophy\nironically left Grotius, Pufendorf and Thomasius (Barbeyrac\u2019s\nprotagonists) with only minor roles to play. Even so, natural law\nremained a presence in the nineteenth century. Thus, Fichte (The\nFoundations of Natural Law [Grundlage des Naturrechts nach\nPrinzipien der Wissenschaftslehre, 1796\u201397]), Schelling\n(A New Deduction of Natural Law [Neue Deduction des\nNaturrechts, 1797]), and the young Hegel (The Scientific Ways\nof Treating Natural Law [\u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen\nBehandlungsarten des Naturrechts, 1802\u20133]) all published\nworks on \u201cnatural law\u201d (Naturrecht) \u2013\nshowing that the idiom remained serviceable (Klippel 1997, 2012). In\nthe British domain, insofar as it was not also\n\u2018idealized\u2019, Bentham\u2019s vague and dismissive attitude\ntoward \u2018natural rights\u2019, and the comparatively\ncircumscribed \u2018ethics\u2019 of Mill\u2019s utilitarianism,\nfound little connection with modern natural law, even through its own\neighteenth-century inheritance which that approach had helped to\nshape. The rebirth of Thomism in the Catholic world toward the end of\nthe century, and the permutation of natural into human rights before\nand after the First World War, made the disjunction and the amnesia\ncomplete.\n\nThis debate continues, albeit in different registers and with\nequivocal notions of \u2018natural law\u2019. For about half of the\ntwentieth century (in philosophy, law, and international relations),\nnatural law referred to a revived Scholasticism or Neo-Thomism. This\nwas joined after mid-century by the \u2018secular\u2019 natural law\nof John Finnis (1940\u2013 ) and Robert P. George (1955\u2013 ),\nlater by the naturalism (or neo-Aristotelianism) of Amartya Sen\n(1933\u2013 ) and Martha Nussbaum (1947\u2013 ), and most recently\nby a new kind of Protestant natural law with roots in\nsixteenth-century Reformed theology (Grabhill 2006, VanDrunen 2010,\nWitte Jr. 2008). All these approaches involve essentialist claims of\nsorts, even if empirically supported, and together with a Kantian\nmetaphysics of the person that is variously present in versions of\nJohn Rawls (1921\u20132002) and J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1929\u2013 )\nthey provide ontological, procedural, or constructivist foundations\nfor discourse about human rights and dignity, and support for\ninternational organizations and mechanisms that police them.\nAccordingly, the supposed \u2018right to punish\u2019 is in full\nforce again, as are duties to assist, to rescue, and the like \u2013\nunderstandably so. However, despite attempts to enlist Pufendorf in\nsuch causes by finding the prehistory of pivotal notions like rights,\ndignity, and equality in his texts (Saastamoinen 2010, Fiorillo 2013a,\nM\u00fcller 2011), his natural law is actually more akin to contrarian\napproaches like the neo-Hobbesianism of Carl Schmitt\n(1888\u20131985), the agonism of Chantal Mouffe (1943\u2013) and\nJames Tully (1946\u2013), the realism of Raymond Geuss (1946\u2013\n), and even the pragmatic naturalism of Philip Kitcher (1947\u2013 ).\nThese perspectives are not necessarily opposed to the practical aims\nof the views they oppose and criticize, it may be useful to note (also\nabout Pufendorf), but merely insist upon fewer suppositions, less\npresumption, and more modest goals. \n",
