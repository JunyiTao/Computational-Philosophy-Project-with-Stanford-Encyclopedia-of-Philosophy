His last objection is that there is no coherent way of\napplying Protagoras\u2019 relativism to judgements about the future.\n\n\nHow might Protagoras counter this objection? Protagoras has already\nsuggested that the past may now be no more than whatever I now\nremember it to have been (166b). Perhaps he can also suggest that the\nfuture is now no more than I now believe it will be. No prediction is\never proved wrong, just as no memory is ever inaccurate. All that\nhappens is it seems to one self at one time that something will\nbe true (or has been true), and seems to another self at\nanother time that something different is true.\n\n\nBut these appeals to distinctions between Protagorean\nselves\u2014future or past\u2014do not help. Suppose we grant to\nProtagoras that, when I make a claim about how the future will be,\nthis claim concerns how things will be for my future self. It\nis just irrelevant to add that my future self and I are different\nbeings. Claims about the future still have a form that makes them\nrefutable by someone\u2019s future experience. If I predict on\nMonday that on Tuesday my head will hurt, that claim is falsified\neither if I have no headache on Tuesday, or if, on Tuesday, there is\nsomeone who is by convention picked out as my continuant whose head\ndoes not hurt.\n\n     \nSimilarly with the past. Suppose I know on Tuesday that on Monday I\npredicted that on Tuesday my head would hurt. It is no help against\nthe present objection for me to reflect, on Tuesday, that I am a\ndifferent person now from who I was then. My Monday-self can only have\nmeant either that his head would hurt on Tuesday, which was a\nfalse belief on his part if he no longer exists on Tuesday; or else\nthat the Tuesday-self would have a sore head. But if the Tuesday-self\nhas no sore head, then my Monday-self made a false prediction, and so\nmust have had a false belief. Either way, the relativist does not\nescape the objection.\n\n\nMoreover, this defence of Protagoras does not evade the following\ndilemma. Either what I mean by claiming (to take an example of\nBostock\u2019s) that \u201cThe wine will taste raw to me in five years\u2019\ntime\u201d is literally that. Or else what I mean is just\n\u201cIt seems to me that the wine will taste raw to me in\nfive years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\nSuppose I mean the former assertion. If the wine turns out not to\ntaste raw five years hence, Protagoras has no defence from the\nconclusion that I made a false prediction about how things would seem\nto me in five years. Or suppose I meant the latter assertion. Then I\ndid not make a prediction, strictly speaking, at all; merely\na remark about what presently seems to me.  Either way, Protagoras\nloses.\n",
