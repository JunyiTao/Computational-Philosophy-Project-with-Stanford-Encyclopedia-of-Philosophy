    "main_text": "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten || Life and Works\n4.1 Life and Works\n\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten was born in Berlin on 17 June 1714.\nBaumgarten\u2019s mother died when he was three, and his father, a\ngarrison chaplain and pastor, died when he was eight in 1722, leaving\nhim to the care of his grandmother and older brothers. In accordance\nwith his father\u2019s wishes, Baumgarten went to Halle to study,\nenrolling in the Latin school at Francke\u2019s Waisenhaus\nwhere his older brother Siegmund Jakob (1706\u201357), who would\nhimself become a famous theologian, was an inspector. Baumgarten\nthrived in his studies, and in 1730 matriculated at the university,\nwhere he attended lectures by Francke and Lange in theology. While it\nwas still forbidden to teach Wolff\u2019s philosophy, Baumgarten\nundertook (with his brother\u2019s encouragement) a thorough study of\nWolff\u2019s thought, lecturing on his logic in the Latin school and\nvisiting Wolffians at the university in Jena. Baumgarten turned to the\nstudy of philosophy, attaining his Magister in 1735, and held\nlectures on logic and Wolffian metaphysics, dictating from his own\nnotes on the latter (rather than a textbook) from which notes his own\nlater Metaphysica derives. In 1736, a chronic lung ailment\ninterrupted his academic work and saw him hospitalized in Berlin,\nreturning to Halle in 1737 where he continued to lecture to great\nacclaim. His position at Halle had been as an (unpaid) extraordinary\nprofessor, but in 1739 he was called to a position at the university\nat Frankfurt an der Oder, and he left Halle in 1740 just before\nWolff\u2019s triumphant return. In Frankfurt, Baumgarten lectured\nwidely in philosophy, including on aesthetics for the first time in\n1742. Health problems, likely tuberculosis, and other difficulties,\nmarked the last decade of Baumgarten\u2019s life, and he died on 26\nMay 1762.\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s philosophical works cover a wide range of topics.\nThe 1000 sections of his Metaphysica of 1739 offers a\nsynopsis of his views, following the Wolffian division, on ontology,\ncosmology, empirical and rational psychology, and natural theology. He\nalso published two influential textbooks on ethics: the Ethica\nphilosophica (Philosophical Ethics) of 1740 and\nInitia philosophiae practicae primae (Elements of First\nPractical Philosophy), both of which Kant also regularly used in\nhis lectures on moral philosophy. Baumgarten\u2019s abiding interest\nin aesthetics issued in two texts, the first a dissertation entitled\nMeditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema\npertinentibus (Reflections on Poetry) in 1735, and the\nsecond the ambitious Aesthetica, the first volume of which\nappeared in 1750, with a second unfinished volume printed (at the\nrequest of the publisher) in 1758.\n",
