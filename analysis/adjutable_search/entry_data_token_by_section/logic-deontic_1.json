Consider six basic alethic modal notions, expressed as\nsentential operators\u2014constructions that, when applied to a\nsentence, yield a sentence (as does \u201cit is not the case\nthat\u201d):\n\n\nit is necessary (necessarily true) that\nit is possible that\nit is impossible that\nit is non-necessary that\nit is contingent that\nit is non-contingent\n that[7]\n\n\n\nAlthough all of the above operators are generally deemed definable in\nterms of any one of the first four, the necessity operator, usually\nsymbolized as a box, \\(\\Box\\), is typically taken as primitive and the\nrest defined accordingly. Where \u201c\\(\\neg\\)\u201d,\n\u201c&\u201d , and \u201c\\(\\vee\\)\u201c denote classical\nnegation, conjunction, and disjunction, the definitions are as\nfollows:\n\n\nIt is possible that \\(p\\) \\((\\Diamond p)\\)\n\n\\( \\eqdf \\neg \\Box \\neg p\\)\nIt is impossible that \\(p\\)\n\n\\( \\eqdf \\Box \\neg p\\)\nIt is non-necessary that \\(p\\)\n\n\\( \\eqdf \\neg \\Box p\\)\nIt is contingent that \\(p\\)\n\n\\( \\eqdf \\neg \\Box p \\amp \\neg \\Box \\neg p\\)\nIt is non-contingent that \\(p\\)\n\n\\( \\eqdf \\Box p \\vee \\Box \\neg p\\)\n\n\n\nIt was also routinely assumed that the following threefold partition\nof propositions holds:\n\n\n\nFig. 1\n\n\nThe three rectangular cells are intended to be jointly exhaustive and\nmutually exclusive: every proposition is either necessary, contingent\n(possibly true but also possibly false), or impossible, but no\nproposition is more than one of these. The possible propositions are\nthose that are either necessary or contingent, the non-necessary\npropositions are those that are either impossible or contingent, and\nthe non-contingent ones are those either necessary or impossible.\n\nThirdly, dating back at least to the twelfth and thirteenth century\n(Knuuttila 2008), the following modal square of opposition is often\n noted:[8]\n\n\n\nFig. 2\n [An extended description of figure 2.]\n\n\nFurthermore it is generally assumed that the following hold:\n\n\nIf \\(\\Box p\\) then \\(p\\) (if it is necessary that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\) is\ntrue).\n\nIf \\(p\\), then \\(\\Diamond p\\) (if \\(p\\) is true, then it is\npossible).\n\n\nThese indicate that the idea of necessity here is alethic or\ntruth-implicating. Many of the ideas above were noted in medieval\ntimes. (See, e.g., the entry on\n medieval theories of modality.)\n",
