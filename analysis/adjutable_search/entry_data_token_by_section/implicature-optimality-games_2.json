    "main_text": "Implicatures and Game Theory\n2. Implicatures and Game Theory\n\nThe first to systematically explore the use of game theory for an\naccount of communication as strategic inference was Prashant\nParikh in his 1988 dissertation (Parikh 1988). Parikh\u2019s theory\nis based on what he calls games of partial information,\nrevolves around the game-theoretic solution concept of\nPareto-optimal Nash equilibrium and has been refined and\napplied to various phenomena, including but not restricted to\nimplicature-strengthened utterance meaning, in a series of articles\nand monographs (e.g., Parikh 1991, 1992, 2000, 2001, 2010, 2019).\nAnother noteworthy early contribution is the work of Asher, Sher, and\nWilliams (2001), which tries to rationalize Grice\u2019s Maxims of\nConversation using ideas from game theory. In the following we focus\non approaches to implicatures based on so-called iterative reasoning\nin signaling games. The relation between optimality theory and game\ntheory is explored by Dekker and van Rooij (2000) and Franke and\nJ\u00e4ger (2012). Stevens and Benz (2018) give another insightful\noverview of game-theoretic pragmatics.\n",
