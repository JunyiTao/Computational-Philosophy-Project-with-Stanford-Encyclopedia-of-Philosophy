Introduction\n\nPhilosophical reflection on scientific discovery occurred in different\nphases. Prior to the 1930s, philosophers were mostly concerned with\ndiscoveries in the broad sense of the term, that is, with the analysis\nof successful scientific inquiry as a whole. Philosophical discussions\nfocused on the question of whether there were any discernible patterns\nin the production of new knowledge. Because the concept of discovery\ndid not have a specified meaning and was used in a very wide sense,\nalmost all discussions of scientific method and practice could\npotentially be considered as early contributions to reflections on\nscientific discovery. In the course of the 18th century, as\nphilosophy of science and science gradually became two distinct\nendeavors with different audiences, the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nbecame a technical term in philosophical discussions. Different\nelements of scientific inquiry were specified. Most importantly,\nduring the 19th century, the generation of new knowledge\ncame to be clearly and explicitly distinguished from its assessment,\nand thus the conditions for the narrower notion of discovery as the\nact or process of conceiving new ideas emerged. This distinction was\nencapsulated in the so-called \u201ccontext distinction,\u201d\nbetween the \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and the \u201ccontext\nof justification\u201d.\n\nMuch of the discussion about scientific discovery in the\n20th century revolved around this distinction It was argued\nthat conceiving a new idea is a non-rational process, a leap of\ninsight that cannot be captured in specific instructions.\nJustification, by contrast, is a systematic process of applying\nevaluative criteria to knowledge claims. Advocates of the context\ndistinction argued that philosophy of science is exclusively concerned\nwith the context of justification. The assumption underlying this\nargument is that philosophy is a normative project; it determines\nnorms for scientific practice. Given this assumption, only the\njustification of ideas, not their generation, can be the subject of\nphilosophical (normative) analysis. Discovery, by contrast, can only\nbe a topic for empirical study. By definition, the study of discovery\nis outside the scope of philosophy of science proper.\n\nThe introduction of the context distinction and the disciplinary\ndistinction between empirical science studies and normative philosophy\nof science that was tied to it spawned meta-philosophical disputes.\nFor a long time, philosophical debates about discovery were shaped by\nthe notion that philosophical and empirical analyses are mutually\nexclusive. Some philosophers insisted, like their predecessors prior\nto the 1930s, that the philosopher\u2019s tasks include the analysis\nof actual scientific practices and that scientific resources be used\nto address philosophical problems. They maintained that it is a\nlegitimate task for philosophy of science to develop a theory of\nheuristics or problem solving. But this position was the minority view\nin philosophy of science until the last decades of the 20th\ncentury. Philosophers of discovery were thus compelled to demonstrate\nthat scientific discovery was in fact a legitimate part of philosophy\nof science. Philosophical reflections about the nature of scientific\ndiscovery had to be bolstered by meta-philosophical arguments about\nthe nature and scope of philosophy of science.\n\nToday, however, there is wide agreement that philosophy and empirical\nresearch are not mutually exclusive. Not only do empirical studies of\nactual scientific discoveries in past and present inform philosophical\nthought about the structure and cognitive mechanisms of discovery, but\nworks in psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and\nrelated fields have become integral parts of philosophical analyses of\nthe processes and conditions of the generation of new knowledge.\nSocial epistemology has opened up another perspective on scientific\ndiscovery, reconceptualizing knowledge generation as group\nprocess.\n2. Scientific inquiry as discovery\n\nPrior to the 19th century, the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nwas used broadly to refer to a new finding, such as a new cure, an\nunknown territory, an improvement of an instrument, or a new method of\nmeasuring longitude. One strand of the discussion about discovery\ndating back to ancient times concerns the method of analysis as the\nmethod of discovery in mathematics and geometry, and, by extension, in\nphilosophy and scientific inquiry. Following the analytic method, we\nseek to find or discover something \u2013 the \u201cthing\nsought,\u201d which could be a theorem, a solution to a geometrical\nproblem, or a cause \u2013 by analyzing it. In the ancient Greek\ncontext, analytic methods in mathematics, geometry, and philosophy\nwere not clearly separated; the notion of finding or discovering\nthings by analysis was relevant in all these fields.\n\nIn the ensuing centuries, several natural and experimental\nphilosophers, including Avicenna and Zabarella, Bacon and Boyle, the\nauthors of the Port-Royal Logic and Newton, and many others,\nexpounded rules of reasoning and methods for arriving at new\nknowledge. The ancient notion of analysis still informed these rules\nand methods. Newton\u2019s famous thirty-first query in the second\nedition of the Opticks outlines the role of analysis in\ndiscovery as follows: \u201cAs in Mathematicks, so in Natural\nPhilosophy, the Investigation of difficult Things by the Method of\nAnalysis, ought ever to precede the Method of Composition. This\nAnalysis consists in making Experiments and Observations, and in\ndrawing general Conclusions from them by Induction, and admitting of\nno Objections against the Conclusions, but such as are taken from\nExperiments, or other certain Truths \u2026 By this way of Analysis\nwe may proceed from Compounds to Ingredients, and from Motions to the\nForces producing them; and in general, from Effects to their Causes,\nand from particular Causes to more general ones, till the Argument end\nin the most general. This is the Method of Analysis\u201d (Newton\n1718, 380, see Koertge 1980, section VI). Early modern accounts of\ndiscovery captured knowledge-seeking practices in the study of living\nand non-living nature, ranging from astronomy and physics to medicine,\nchemistry, and agriculture. These rich accounts of scientific inquiry\nwere often expounded to bolster particular theories about the nature\nof matter and natural forces and were not explicitly labeled\n\u201cmethods of discovery\u201d, yet they are, in fact,\naccounts of knowledge generation and proper scientific reasoning,\ncovering topics such as the role of the senses in knowledge\ngeneration, observation and experimentation, analysis and synthesis,\ninduction and deduction, hypotheses, probability, and certainty. \n\nBacon\u2019s work is a prominent example. His view of the method of\nscience as it is presented in the Novum Organum showed how\nbest to arrive at knowledge about \u201cform natures\u201d (the most\ngeneral properties of matter) via a systematic investigation of\nphenomenal natures. Bacon described how first to collect and organize\nnatural phenomena and experimentally produced facts in tables, how to\nevaluate these lists, and how to refine the initial results with the\nhelp of further trials. Through these steps, the investigator would\narrive at conclusions about the \u201cform nature\u201d that\nproduces particular phenomenal natures. Bacon expounded the procedures\nof constructing and evaluating tables of presences and absences to\nunderpin his matter theory. In addition, in his other writings, such\nas his natural history Sylva Sylvarum or his comprehensive\nwork on human learning De Augmentis Scientiarium, Bacon\nexemplified the \u201cart of discovery\u201d with practical examples\nand discussions of strategies of inquiry.\n\nLike Bacon and Newton, several other early modern authors advanced\nideas about how to generate and secure empirical knowledge, what\ndifficulties may arise in scientific inquiry, and how they could be\novercome. The close connection between theories about matter and force\nand scientific methodologies that we find in early modern works was\ngradually severed. 18th- and early 19th-century\nauthors on scientific method and logic cited early modern approaches\nmostly to model proper scientific practice and reasoning, often\ncreatively modifying them\n (section 3).\n Moreover, they developed the earlier methodologies of\nexperimentation, observation, and reasoning into practical guidelines\nfor discovering new phenomena and devising probable hypotheses about\ncause-effect relations.\n\nIt was common in 20th-century philosophy of science to draw\na sharp contrast between those early theories of scientific method and\nmodern approaches. 20th-century philosophers of science\ninterpreted 17th- and 18th-century approaches as\ngenerative theories of scientific method. They function simultaneously\nas guides for acquiring new knowledge and as assessments of the\nknowledge thus obtained, whereby knowledge that is obtained \u201cin\nthe right way\u201d is considered secure (Laudan 1980; Schaffner\n1993: chapter 2). On this view, scientific methods are taken to have\nprobative force (Nickles 1985). According to modern,\n\u201cconsequentialist\u201d theories, propositions must be\nestablished by comparing their consequences with observed and\nexperimentally produced phenomena (Laudan 1980; Nickles 1985). It was\nfurther argued that, when consequentialist theories were on the rise,\nthe two processes of generation and assessment of an idea or\nhypothesis became distinct, and the view that the merit of a new idea\ndoes not depend on the way in which it was arrived at became widely\naccepted.\n\nMore recent research in history of philosophy of science has shown,\nhowever, that there was no such sharp contrast. Consequentialist ideas\nwere advanced throughout the 18th century, and the early\nmodern generative theories of scientific method and knowledge were\nmore pragmatic than previously assumed. Early modern scholars did not\nassume that this procedure would lead to absolute certainty. One could\nonly obtain moral certainty for the propositions thus secured.\n3. Elements of discovery\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the\ndifferent elements of discovery gradually became separated and\ndiscussed in more detail. Discussions concerned the nature of\nobservations and experiments, the act of having an insight and the\nprocesses of articulating, developing, and testing the novel insight.\nPhilosophical discussion focused on the question of whether and to\nwhat extent rules could be devised to guide each of these\nprocesses.\n\nNumerous 19th-century scholars contributed to these\ndiscussions, including Claude Bernard, Auguste Comte, George Gore,\nJohn Herschel, W. Stanley Jevons, Justus von Liebig, John Stuart Mill,\nand Charles Sanders Peirce, to name only a few. William\nWhewell\u2019s work, especially the two volumes of Philosophy of\nthe Inductive Sciences of 1840, is a noteworthy and, later, much\ndiscussed contribution to the philosophical debates about scientific\ndiscovery because he explicitly distinguished the creative moment or\n\u201chappy thought\u201d as he called it from other elements of\nscientific inquiry and because he offered a detailed analysis of the\n\u201cdiscoverer\u2019s induction\u201d, i.e., the pursuit and\nevaluation of the new insight. Whewell\u2019s approach is not unique,\nbut for late 20th-century philosophers of science, his\ncomprehensive, historically informed philosophy of discovery became a\npoint of orientation in the revival of interest in scientific\ndiscovery processes.\n\nFor Whewell, discovery comprised three elements: the happy thought,\nthe articulation and development of that thought, and the testing or\nverification of it. His account was in part a description of the\npsychological makeup of the discoverer. For instance, he held that\nonly geniuses could have those happy thoughts that are essential to\ndiscovery. In part, his account was an account of the methods by which\nhappy thoughts are integrated into the system of knowledge. According\nto Whewell, the initial step in every discovery is what he called\n\u201csome happy thought, of which we cannot trace the origin; some\nfortunate cast of intellect, rising above all rules. No maxims can be\ngiven which inevitably lead to discovery\u201d (Whewell 1996 [1840]:\n186). An \u201cart of discovery\u201d in the sense of a teachable\nand learnable skill does not exist according to Whewell. The happy\nthought builds on the known facts, but according to Whewell it is\nimpossible to prescribe a method for having happy thoughts.\n\nIn this sense, happy thoughts are accidental. But in an important\nsense, scientific discoveries are not accidental. The happy\nthought is not a wild guess. Only the person whose mind is prepared to\nsee things will actually notice them. The \u201cprevious condition of\nthe intellect, and not the single fact, is really the main and\npeculiar cause of the success. The fact is merely the occasion by\nwhich the engine of discovery is brought into play sooner or later. It\nis, as I have elsewhere said, only the spark which discharges a gun\nalready loaded and pointed; and there is little propriety in speaking\nof such an accident as the cause why the bullet hits its mark.\u201d\n(Whewell 1996 [1840]: 189).\n\nHaving a happy thought is not yet a discovery, however. The second\nelement of a scientific discovery consists in binding\ntogether\u2014\u201ccolligating\u201d, as Whewell called it\u2014a\nset of facts by bringing them under a general conception. Not only\ndoes the colligation produce something new, but it also shows the\npreviously known facts in a new light. Colligation involves, on the\none hand, the specification of facts through systematic observation,\nmeasurements and experiment, and on the other hand, the clarification\nof ideas through the exposition of the definitions and axioms that are\ntacitly implied in those ideas. This process is extended and\niterative. The scientists go back and forth between binding together\nthe facts, clarifying the idea, rendering the facts more exact, and so\nforth.\n\nThe final part of the discovery is the verification of the colligation\ninvolving the happy thought. This means, first and foremost, that the\noutcome of the colligation must be sufficient to explain the data at\nhand. Verification also involves judging the predictive power,\nsimplicity, and \u201cconsilience\u201d of the outcome of the\ncolligation. \u201cConsilience\u201d refers to a higher range of\ngenerality (broader applicability) of the theory (the articulated and\nclarified happy thought) that the actual colligation produced.\nWhewell\u2019s account of discovery is not a deductivist system. It\nis essential that the outcome of the colligation be inferable from the\ndata prior to any testing (Snyder 1997).\n\nWhewell\u2019s theory of discovery clearly separates three elements:\nthe non-analyzable happy thought or eureka moment; the process of\ncolligation which includes the clarification and explication of facts\nand ideas; and the verification of the outcome of the colligation. His\nposition that the philosophy of discovery cannot prescribe how to\nthink happy thoughts has been a key element of 20th-century\nphilosophical reflection on discovery. In contrast to many\n20th-century approaches, Whewell\u2019s philosophical\nconception of discovery also comprises the processes by which the\nhappy thoughts are articulated. Similarly, the process of verification\nis an integral part of discovery. The procedures of articulation and\ntest are both analyzable according to Whewell, and his\nconception of colligation and verification serve as guidelines for how\nthe discoverer should proceed. To verify a hypothesis, the\ninvestigator needs to show that it accounts for the known facts, that\nit foretells new, previously unobserved phenomena, and that it can\nexplain and predict phenomena which are explained and predicted by a\nhypothesis that was obtained through an independent happy\nthought-cum-colligation (Ducasse 1951).\n\nWhewell\u2019s conceptualization of scientific discovery offers a\nuseful framework for mapping the philosophical debates about discovery\nand for identifying major issues of concern in 20th-century\nphilosophical debates. Until the late 20th century, most\nphilosophers operated with a notion of discovery that is narrower than\nWhewell\u2019s. In more recent treatments of discovery, however, the\nscope of the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d is limited to either the\nfirst of these elements, the \u201chappy thought\u201d, or to the\nhappy thought and its initial articulation. In the narrower\nconception, what Whewell called \u201cverification\u201d is not part\nof discovery proper. Secondly, until the late 20th century,\nthere was wide agreement that the eureka moment, narrowly construed,\nis an unanalyzable, even mysterious leap of insight. The main\ndisagreements concerned the question of whether the process of\ndeveloping a hypothesis (the \u201ccolligation\u201d in\nWhewell\u2019s terms) is, or is not, a part of discovery proper\n\u2013 and if it is, whether and how this process is guided by rules.\nMuch of the controversies in the 20th century about the\npossibility of a philosophy of discovery can be understood against the\nbackground of the disagreement about whether the process of discovery\ndoes or does not include the articulation and development of a novel\nthought. Philosophers also disagreed on the issue of whether it is a\nphilosophical task to explicate these rules.\n\nIn early 20th-century logical empiricism, the view that\ndiscovery is or at least crucially involves a non-analyzable creative\nact of a gifted genius was widespread. Alternative conceptions of\ndiscovery especially in the pragmatist tradition emphasize that\ndiscovery is an extended process, i.e., that the discovery process\nincludes the reasoning processes through which a new insight is\narticulated and further developed.\n4. Pragmatic logics of discovery\n\nIn the pragmatist tradition, the term \u201clogic\u201d is used in\nthe broad sense to refer to strategies of human reasoning and inquiry.\nWhile the reasoning involved does not proceed according to the\nprinciples of demonstrative logic, it is systematic enough to deserve\nthe label \u201clogical\u201d. Proponents of this view argued that\ntraditional (here: syllogistic) logic is an inadequate model of\nscientific discovery because it misrepresents the process of knowledge\ngeneration as grossly as the notion of an \u201caha\nmoment\u201d.\n\nEarly 20th-century pragmatic logics of discovery can best\nbe described as comprehensive theories of the mental and\nphysical-practical operations involved in knowledge generation, as\ntheories of \u201chow we think\u201d (Dewey 1910). Among the mental\noperations are classification, determination of what is relevant to an\ninquiry, and the conditions of communication of meaning; among the\nphysical operations are observation and (laboratory) experiments.\nThese features of scientific discovery are either not or only\ninsufficiently represented by traditional syllogistic logic (Schiller\n1917: 236\u20137).\n\nPhilosophers advocating this approach agree that the logic of\ndiscovery should be characterized as a set of heuristic principles\nrather than as a process of applying inductive or deductive logic to a\nset of propositions. These heuristic principles are not understood to\nshow the path to secure knowledge. Heuristic principles are suggestive\nrather than demonstrative (Carmichael 1922, 1930). One recurrent\nfeature in these accounts of the reasoning strategies leading to new\nideas is analogical reasoning (Schiller 1917; Benjamin 1934, see also\n section 9.2.).\n However, in academic philosophy of science, endeavors to develop more\nsystematically the heuristics guiding discovery processes were soon\neclipsed by the advance of the distinction between contexts of\ndiscovery and justification.\n5. The distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification\n\nThe distinction between \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and\n\u201ccontext of justification\u201d dominated and shaped the\ndiscussions about discovery in 20th-century philosophy of\nscience. The context distinction marks the distinction between the\ngeneration of a new idea or hypothesis and the defense (test,\nverification) of it. As the previous sections have shown, the\ndistinction among different elements of scientific inquiry has a long\nhistory but in the first half of the 20th century, the\ndistinction between the different features of scientific inquiry\nturned into a powerful demarcation criterion between\n\u201cgenuine\u201d philosophy and other fields of science studies,\nwhich became potent in philosophy of science. The boundary between\ncontext of discovery (the de facto thinking processes) and\ncontext of justification (the de jure defense of the\ncorrectness of these thoughts) was now understood to determine the\nscope of philosophy of science, whereby philosophy of science is\nconceived as a normative endeavor. Advocates of the context\ndistinction argue that the generation of a new idea is an intuitive,\nnonrational process; it cannot be subject to normative analysis.\nTherefore, the study of scientists\u2019 actual thinking can only be\nthe subject of psychology, sociology, and other empirical sciences.\nPhilosophy of science, by contrast, is exclusively concerned with the\ncontext of justification.\n\nThe terms \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and \u201ccontext of\njustification\u201d are often associated with Hans\nReichenbach\u2019s work. Reichenbach\u2019s original conception of\nthe context distinction is quite complex, however (Howard 2006;\nRichardson 2006). It does not map easily on to the disciplinary\ndistinction mentioned above, because for Reichenbach, philosophy of\nscience proper is partly descriptive. Reichenbach maintains that\nphilosophy of science includes a description of knowledge as it really\nis. Descriptive philosophy of science reconstructs scientists\u2019\nthinking processes in such a way that logical analysis can be\nperformed on them, and it thus prepares the ground for the evaluation\nof these thoughts (Reichenbach 1938: \u00a7 1). Discovery, by\ncontrast, is the object of empirical\u2014psychological,\nsociological\u2014study. According to Reichenbach, the empirical\nstudy of discoveries shows that processes of discovery often\ncorrespond to the principle of induction, but this is simply a\npsychological fact (Reichenbach 1938: 403).\n\nWhile the terms \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and \u201ccontext\nof justification\u201d are widely used, there has been ample\ndiscussion about how the distinction should be drawn and what their\nphilosophical significance is (c.f. Kordig 1978; Gutting 1980; Zahar\n1983; Leplin 1987; Hoyningen-Huene 1987; Weber 2005: chapter 3;\nSchickore and Steinle 2006). Most commonly, the distinction is\ninterpreted as a distinction between the process of conceiving a\ntheory and the assessment of that theory, specifically the assessment\nof the theory\u2019s epistemic support. This version of the\ndistinction is not necessarily interpreted as a temporal distinction.\nIn other words, it is not usually assumed that a theory is first fully\ndeveloped and then assessed. Rather, generation and assessment are two\ndifferent epistemic approaches to theory: the endeavor to articulate,\nflesh out, and develop its potential and the endeavor to assess its\nepistemic worth. Within the framework of the context distinction,\nthere are two main ways of conceptualizing the process of conceiving a\ntheory. The first option is to characterize the generation of new\nknowledge as an irrational act, a mysterious creative intuition, a\n\u201ceureka moment\u201d. The second option is to conceptualize the\ngeneration of new knowledge as an extended process that\nincludes a creative act as well as some process of\narticulating and developing the creative idea.\n\nBoth of these accounts of knowledge generation served as starting\npoints for arguments against the possibility of a philosophy of\ndiscovery. In line with the first option, philosophers have argued\nthat neither is it possible to prescribe a logical method that\nproduces new ideas nor is it possible to reconstruct logically the\nprocess of discovery. Only the process of testing is amenable to\nlogical investigation. This objection to philosophies of discovery has\nbeen called the \u201cdiscovery machine objection\u201d (Curd 1980:\n207). It is usually associated with Karl Popper\u2019s Logic of\nScientific Discovery.\n\n\nThe initial state, the act of conceiving or inventing a theory, seems\nto me neither to call for logical analysis not to be susceptible of\nit. The question how it happens that a new idea occurs to a\nman\u2014whether it is a musical theme, a dramatic conflict, or a\nscientific theory\u2014may be of great interest to empirical\npsychology; but it is irrelevant to the logical analysis of scientific\nknowledge. This latter is concerned not with questions of\nfact (Kant\u2019s quid facti?), but only with\nquestions of justification or validity (Kant\u2019s quid\njuris?). Its questions are of the following kind. Can a\nstatement be justified? And if so, how? Is it testable? Is it\nlogically dependent on certain other statements? Or does it perhaps\ncontradict them? [\u2026]Accordingly I shall distinguish sharply\nbetween the process of conceiving a new idea, and the methods and\nresults of examining it logically. As to the task of the logic of\nknowledge\u2014in contradistinction to the psychology of\nknowledge\u2014I shall proceed on the assumption that it consists\nsolely in investigating the methods employed in those systematic tests\nto which every new idea must be subjected if it is to be seriously\nentertained. (Popper 2002 [1934/1959]: 7\u20138)\n\n\nWith respect to the second way of conceptualizing knowledge\ngeneration, many philosophers argue in a similar fashion that because\nthe process of discovery involves an irrational, intuitive process,\nwhich cannot be examined logically, a logic of discovery cannot be\nconstrued. Other philosophers turn against the philosophy of discovery\neven though they explicitly acknowledge that discovery is an extended,\nreasoned process. They present a meta-philosophical objection\nargument, arguing that a theory of articulating and developing ideas\nis not a philosophical but a psychological or sociological theory. In\nthis perspective, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is understood as a\nretrospective label, which is attributed as a sign of accomplishment\nto some scientific endeavors. Sociological theories acknowledge that\ndiscovery is a collective achievement and the outcome of a process of\nnegotiation through which \u201cdiscovery stories\u201d are\nconstructed and certain knowledge claims are granted discovery status\n(Brannigan 1981; Schaffer 1986, 1994).\n\nThe impact of the context distinction on 20th-century\nstudies of scientific discovery and on philosophy of science more\ngenerally can hardly be overestimated. The view that the process of\ndiscovery (however construed) is outside the scope of philosophy of\nscience proper was widely shared amongst philosophers of science for\nmost of the 20th century. The last section shows that there\nwere some attempts to develop logics of discovery in the 1920s and\n1930s, especially in the pragmatist tradition. But for several\ndecades, the context distinction dictated what philosophy of science\nshould be about and how it should proceed. The dominant view was that\ntheories of mental operations or heuristics had no place in philosophy\nof science and that, therefore, discovery was not a legitimate topic\nfor philosophy of science. Until the last decades of the\n20th century, there were few attempts to challenge the\ndisciplinary distinction tied to the context distinction. Only during\nthe 1970s did the interest in philosophical approaches to discovery\nbegin to increase again. But the context distinction remained a\nchallenge for philosophies of discovery.\n\nThere are several lines of response to the disciplinary distinction\ntied to the context distinction. Each of these lines of response opens\na philosophical perspective on discovery. Each proceeds on the\nassumption that philosophy of science may legitimately include some\nform of analysis of actual reasoning patterns as well as\ninformation from empirical sciences such as cognitive science,\npsychology, and sociology. All of these responses reject the idea that\ndiscovery is nothing but a mystical event. Discovery is conceived as\nan analyzable reasoning process, not just as a creative leap by which\nnovel ideas spring into being fully formed. All of these responses\nagree that the procedures and methods for arriving at new hypotheses\nand ideas are no guarantee that the hypothesis or idea that is thus\nformed is necessarily the best or the correct one. Nonetheless, it is\nthe task of philosophy of science to provide rules for making this\nprocess better. All of these responses can be described as theories of\nproblem solving, whose ultimate goal is to make the generation of new\nideas and theories more efficient.\n\nBut the different approaches to scientific discovery employ different\nterminologies. In particular, the term \u201clogic\u201d of\ndiscovery is sometimes used in a narrow sense and sometimes broadly\nunderstood. In the narrow sense, \u201clogic\u201d of discovery is\nunderstood to refer to a set of formal, generally applicable rules by\nwhich novel ideas can be mechanically derived from existing data. In\nthe broad sense, \u201clogic\u201d of discovery refers to the\nschematic representation of reasoning procedures.\n\u201cLogical\u201d is just another term for \u201crational\u201d.\nMoreover, while each of these responses combines philosophical\nanalyses of scientific discovery with empirical research on actual\nhuman cognition, different sets of resources are mobilized, ranging\nfrom AI research and cognitive science to historical studies of\nproblem-solving procedures. Also, the responses parse the process of\nscientific inquiry differently. Often, scientific inquiry is regarded\nas having two aspects, viz. generation and assessments of new ideas.\nAt times, however, scientific inquiry is regarded as having three\naspects, namely generation, pursuit or articulation, and assessment of\nknowledge. In the latter framework, the label \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nis sometimes used to refer just to generation and sometimes to refer\nto both generation and pursuit.\n\nOne response to the challenge of the context distinction draws on a\nbroad understanding of the term \u201clogic\u201d to argue that we\ncannot but admit a general, domain-neutral logic if we do not want to\nassume that the success of science is a miracle (Jantzen 2016) and\nthat a logic of scientific discovery can be developed\n (section 6).\n Another response, drawing on a narrow understanding of the term\n\u201clogic\u201d, is to concede that there is no logic of\ndiscovery, i.e., no algorithm for generating new knowledge, but that\nthe process of discovery follows an identifiable, analyzable pattern\n (section 7).\n\nOthers argue that discovery is governed by a methodology. The\nmethodology of discovery is a legitimate topic for philosophical\nanalysis\n (section 8).\n Yet another response assumes that discovery is or at least involves a\ncreative act. Drawing on resources from cognitive science,\nneuroscience, computational research, and environmental and social\npsychology, philosophers have sought to demystify the cognitive\nprocesses involved in the generation of new ideas. Philosophers who\ntake this approach argue that scientific creativity is amenable to\nphilosophical analysis\n (section 9.1).\n\nAll these responses assume that there is more to discovery than a\neureka moment. Discovery comprises processes of articulating,\ndeveloping, and assessing the creative thought, as well as the\nscientific community\u2019s adjudication of what does, and does not,\ncount as \u201cdiscovery\u201d (Arabatzis 1996). These are the\nprocesses that can be examined with the tools of philosophical\nanalysis, augmented by input from other fields of science studies such\nas sociology, history, or cognitive science.\n6. Logics of discovery after the context distinction\n\nOne way of responding to the demarcation criterion described above is\nto argue that discovery is a topic for philosophy of science because\nit is a logical process after all. Advocates of this approach to the\nlogic of discovery usually accept the overall distinction between the\ntwo processes of conceiving and testing a hypothesis. They also agree\nthat it is impossible to put together a manual that provides a formal,\nmechanical procedure through which innovative concepts or hypotheses\ncan be derived: There is no discovery machine. But they reject the\nview that the process of conceiving a theory is a creative act, a\nmysterious guess, a hunch, a more or less instantaneous and random\nprocess. Instead, they insist that both conceiving and testing\nhypotheses are processes of reasoning and systematic inference, that\nboth of these processes can be represented schematically, and that it\nis possible to distinguish better and worse paths to new\nknowledge.\n\nThis line of argument has much in common with the logics of discovery\ndescribed in\n section 4\n above but it is now explicitly pitched against the disciplinary\ndistinction tied to the context distinction. There are two main ways\nof developing this argument. The first is to conceive of discovery in\nterms of abductive reasoning\n (section 6.1).\n The second is to conceive of discovery in terms of problem-solving\nalgorithms, whereby heuristic rules aid the processing of available\ndata and enhance the success in finding solutions to problems\n (section 6.2).\n Both lines of argument rely on a broad conception of logic, whereby\nthe \u201clogic\u201d of discovery amounts to a schematic account of\nthe reasoning processes involved in knowledge generation.\n6.1 Discovery as abduction\n\nOne argument, elaborated prominently by Norwood R. Hanson, is that the\nact of discovery\u2014here, the act of suggesting a new\nhypothesis\u2014follows a distinctive logical pattern, which is\ndifferent from both inductive logic and the logic of\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning. The special logic of discovery is the\nlogic of abductive or \u201cretroductive\u201d inferences (Hanson\n1958). The argument that it is through an act of abductive inferences\nthat plausible, promising scientific hypotheses are devised goes back\nto C.S. Peirce. This version of the logic of discovery characterizes\nreasoning processes that take place before a new hypothesis\nis ultimately justified. The abductive mode of reasoning that leads to\nplausible hypotheses is conceptualized as an inference beginning with\ndata or, more specifically, with surprising or anomalous\nphenomena.\n\nIn this view, discovery is primarily a process of explaining anomalies\nor surprising, astonishing phenomena. The scientists\u2019 reasoning\nproceeds abductively from an anomaly to an explanatory hypothesis in\nlight of which the phenomena would no longer be surprising or\nanomalous. The outcome of this reasoning process is not one single\nspecific hypothesis but the delineation of a type of hypotheses that\nis worthy of further attention (Hanson 1965: 64). According to Hanson,\nthe abductive argument has the following schematic form (Hanson 1960:\n104):\n\nSome surprising, astonishing phenomena p1,\np2, p3 \u2026 are\nencountered.\nBut p1, p2,\np3 \u2026 would not be surprising were an\nhypothesis of H\u2019s type to obtain. They would follow as\na matter of course from something like H and would be\nexplained by it.\nTherefore there is good reason for elaborating an hypothesis of\ntype H\u2014for proposing it as a possible hypothesis from whose\nassumption p1, p2,\np3 \u2026 might be explained.\n\n\nDrawing on the historical record, Hanson argues that several important\ndiscoveries were made relying on abductive reasoning, such as\nKepler\u2019s discovery of the elliptic orbit of Mars (Hanson 1958).\nIt is now widely agreed, however, that Hanson\u2019s reconstruction\nof the episode is not a historically adequate account of\nKepler\u2019s discovery (Lugg 1985). More importantly, while there is\ngeneral agreement that abductive inferences are frequent in both\neveryday and scientific reasoning, these inferences are no longer\nconsidered as logical inferences. Even if one accepts\nHanson\u2019s schematic representation of the process of identifying\nplausible hypotheses, this process is a \u201clogical\u201d process\nonly in the widest sense whereby the term \u201clogical\u201d is\nunderstood as synonymous with \u201crational\u201d. Notably, some\nphilosophers have even questioned the rationality of abductive\ninferences (Koehler 1991; Brem and Rips 2000).\n\nAnother argument against the above schema is that it is too\npermissive. There will be several hypotheses that are explanations for\nphenomena p1, p2,\np3 \u2026, so the fact that a particular\nhypothesis explains the phenomena is not a decisive criterion for\ndeveloping that hypothesis (Harman 1965; see also Blackwell 1969).\nAdditional criteria are required to evaluate the hypothesis yielded by\nabductive inferences.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the schema of abductive reasoning\ndoes not explain the very act of conceiving a hypothesis or\nhypothesis-type. The processes by which a new idea is first\narticulated remain unanalyzed in the above schema. The schema focuses\non the reasoning processes by which an exploratory hypothesis is\nassessed in terms of its merits and promise (Laudan 1980; Schaffner\n1993).\n\nIn more recent work on abduction and discovery, two notions of\nabduction are sometimes distinguished: the common notion of abduction\nas inference to the best explanation (selective abduction) and\ncreative abduction (Magnani 2000, 2009). Selective abduction\u2014the\ninference to the best explanation\u2014involves selecting a\nhypothesis from a set of known hypotheses. Medical diagnosis\nexemplifies this kind of abduction. Creative abduction, by contrast,\ninvolves generating a new, plausible hypothesis. This happens, for\ninstance, in medical research, when the notion of a new disease is\narticulated. However, it is still an open question whether this\ndistinction can be drawn, or whether there is a more gradual\ntransition from selecting an explanatory hypothesis from a familiar\ndomain (selective abduction) to selecting a hypothesis that is\nslightly modified from the familiar set and to identifying a more\ndrastically modified or altered assumption.\n\nAnother recent suggestion is to broaden Peirce\u2019s original\naccount of abduction and to include not only verbal information but\nalso non-verbal mental representations, such as visual, auditory, or\nmotor representations. In Thagard\u2019s approach, representations\nare characterized as patterns of activity in mental populations (see\nalso\n section 9.3\n below). The advantage of the neural account of human reasoning is\nthat it covers features such as the surprise that accompanies the\ngeneration of new insights or the visual and auditory representations\nthat contribute to it. Surprise, for instance, could be characterized\nas resulting from rapid changes in activation of the node in a neural\nnetwork representing the \u201csurprising\u201d element (Thagard and\nStewart 2011). If all mental representations can be characterized as\npatterns of firing in neural populations, abduction can be analyzed as\nthe combination or \u201cconvolution\u201d (Thagard) of patterns of\nneural activity from disjoint or overlapping patterns of activity\n(Thagard 2010).\n6.2 Heuristic programming\n\nThe concern with the logic of discovery has also motivated research on\nartificial intelligence at the intersection of philosophy of science\nand cognitive science. In this approach, scientific discovery is\ntreated as a form of problem-solving activity (Simon 1973; see also\nNewell and Simon 1971), whereby the systematic aspects of problem\nsolving are studied within an information-processing framework. The\naim is to clarify with the help of computational tools the nature of\nthe methods used to discover scientific hypotheses. These hypotheses\nare regarded as solutions to problems. Philosophers working in this\ntradition build computer programs employing methods of heuristic\nselective search (e.g., Langley et al. 1987). In computational\nheuristics, search programs can be described as searches for solutions\nin a so-called \u201cproblem space\u201d in a certain domain. The\nproblem space comprises all possible configurations in that domain\n(e.g., for chess problems, all possible arrangements of pieces on a\nboard of chess). Each configuration is a \u201cstate\u201d of the\nproblem space. There are two special states, namely the goal state,\ni.e., the state to be reached, and the initial state, i.e., the\nconfiguration at the starting point from which the search begins.\nThere are operators, which determine the moves that generate new\nstates from the current state. There are path constraints, which limit\nthe permitted moves. Problem solving is the process of searching for a\nsolution of the problem of how to generate the goal state from an\ninitial state. In principle, all states can be generated by applying\nthe operators to the initial state, then to the resulting state, until\nthe goal state is reached (Langley et al. 1987: chapter 9). A problem\nsolution is a sequence of operations leading from the initial to the\ngoal state.\n\nThe basic idea behind computational heuristics is that rules can be\nidentified that serve as guidelines for finding a solution to a given\nproblem quickly and efficiently by avoiding undesired states of the\nproblem space. These rules are best described as rules of thumb. The\naim of constructing a logic of discovery thus becomes the aim of\nconstructing a heuristics for the efficient search for solutions to\nproblems. The term \u201cheuristic search\u201d indicates that in\ncontrast to algorithms, problem-solving procedures lead to results\nthat are merely provisional and plausible. A solution is not\nguaranteed, but heuristic searches are advantageous because they are\nmore efficient than exhaustive random trial and error searches.\nInsofar as it is possible to evaluate whether one set of heuristics is\nbetter\u2014more efficacious\u2014than another, the logic of\ndiscovery turns into a normative theory of discovery.\n\nArguably, because it is possible to reconstruct important scientific\ndiscovery processes with sets of computational heuristics, the\nscientific discovery process can be considered as a special case of\nthe general mechanism of information processing. In this context, the\nterm \u201clogic\u201d is not used in the narrow sense of a set of\nformal, generally applicable rules to draw inferences but again in a\nbroad sense as a label for a set of procedural rules.\n\nThe computer programs that embody the principles of heuristic searches\nin scientific inquiry simulate the paths that scientists followed when\nthey searched for new theoretical hypotheses. Computer programs such\nas BACON (Simon et al. 1981) and KEKADA (Kulkarni and Simon 1988)\nutilize sets of problem-solving heuristics to detect regularities in\ngiven data sets. The program would note, for instance, that the values\nof a dependent term are constant or that a set of values for a term\nx and a set of values for a term y are linearly\nrelated. It would thus \u201cinfer\u201d that the dependent term\nalways has that value or that a linear relation exists between\nx and y. These programs can \u201cmake\ndiscoveries\u201d in the sense that they can simulate successful\ndiscoveries such as Kepler\u2019s third law (BACON) or the Krebs\ncycle (KEKADA).\n\nComputational theories of scientific discoveries have helped identify\nand clarify a number of problem-solving strategies. An example of such\na strategy is heuristic means-ends analysis, which involves\nidentifying specific differences between the present and the goal\nsituation and searches for operators (processes that will change the\nsituation) that are associated with the differences that were\ndetected. Another important heuristic is to divide the problem into\nsub-problems and to begin solving the one with the smallest number of\nunknowns to be determined (Simon 1977). Computational approaches have\nalso highlighted the extent to which the generation of new knowledge\ndraws on existing knowledge that constrains the development of new\nhypotheses.\n\nAs accounts of scientific discoveries, the early computational\nheuristics have some limitations. Compared to the problem spaces given\nin computational heuristics, the complex problem spaces for scientific\nproblems are often ill defined, and the relevant search space and goal\nstate must be delineated before heuristic assumptions could be\nformulated (Bechtel and Richardson 1993: chapter 1). Because a\ncomputer program requires the data from actual experiments, the\nsimulations cover only certain aspects of scientific discoveries; in\nparticular, it cannot determine by itself which data is relevant,\nwhich data to relate and what form of law it should look for (Gillies\n1996). However, as a consequence of the rise of so-called \u201cdeep\nlearning\u201d methods in data-intensive science, there is renewed\nphilosophical interest in the question of whether machines can make\ndiscoveries\n (section 10).\n7. Anomalies and the structure of discovery\n\nMany philosophers maintain that discovery is a legitimate topic for\nphilosophy of science while abandoning the notion that there is a\nlogic of discovery. One very influential approach is Thomas\nKuhn\u2019s analysis of the emergence of novel facts and theories\n(Kuhn 1970 [1962]: chapter 6). Kuhn identifies a general pattern of\ndiscovery as part of his account of scientific change. A discovery is\nnot a simple act, but an extended, complex process, which culminates\nin paradigm changes. Paradigms are the symbolic generalizations,\nmetaphysical commitments, values, and exemplars that are shared by a\ncommunity of scientists and that guide the research of that community.\nParadigm-based, normal science does not aim at novelty but instead at\nthe development, extension, and articulation of accepted paradigms. A\ndiscovery begins with an anomaly, that is, with the recognition that\nthe expectations induced by an established paradigm are being\nviolated. The process of discovery involves several aspects:\nobservations of an anomalous phenomenon, attempts to conceptualize it,\nand changes in the paradigm so that the anomaly can be\naccommodated.\n\nIt is the mark of success of normal science that it does not make\ntransformative discoveries, and yet such discoveries come about as a\nconsequence of normal, paradigm-guided science. The more detailed and\nthe better developed a paradigm, the more precise are its predictions.\nThe more precisely the researchers know what to expect, the better\nthey are able to recognize anomalous results and violations of\nexpectations:\n\n\nnovelty ordinarily emerges only for the man who, knowing with\nprecision what he should expect, is able to recognize that something\nhas gone wrong. Anomaly appears only against the background provided\nby the paradigm. (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 65)\n\n\nDrawing on several historical examples, Kuhn argues that it is usually\nimpossible to identify the very moment when something was discovered\nor even the individual who made the discovery. Kuhn illustrates these\npoints with the discovery of oxygen (see Kuhn 1970 [1962]:\n53\u201356). Oxygen had not been discovered before 1774 and had been\ndiscovered by 1777. Even before 1774, Lavoisier had noticed that\nsomething was wrong with phlogiston theory, but he was unable to move\nforward. Two other investigators, C. W. Scheele and Joseph Priestley,\nindependently identified a gas obtained from heating solid substances.\nBut Scheele\u2019s work remained unpublished until after 1777, and\nPriestley did not identify his substance as a new sort of gas. In\n1777, Lavoisier presented the oxygen theory of combustion, which gave\nrise to fundamental reconceptualization of chemistry. But according to\nthis theory as Lavoisier first presented it, oxygen was not a chemical\nelement. It was an atomic \u201cprinciple of acidity\u201d and\noxygen gas was a combination of that principle with caloric. According\nto Kuhn, all of these developments are part of the discovery of\noxygen, but none of them can be singled out as \u201cthe\u201d act\nof discovery.\n\nIn pre-paradigmatic periods or in times of paradigm crisis,\ntheory-induced discoveries may happen. In these periods, scientists\nspeculate and develop tentative theories, which may lead to novel\nexpectations and experiments and observations to test whether these\nexpectations can be confirmed. Even though no precise predictions can\nbe made, phenomena that are thus uncovered are often not quite what\nhad been expected. In these situations, the simultaneous exploration\nof the new phenomena and articulation of the tentative hypotheses\ntogether bring about discovery.\n\nIn cases like the discovery of oxygen, by contrast, which took place\nwhile a paradigm was already in place, the unexpected becomes apparent\nonly slowly, with difficulty, and against some resistance. Only\ngradually do the anomalies become visible as such. It takes time for\nthe investigators to recognize \u201cboth that something is and what\nit is\u201d (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 55). Eventually, a new paradigm\nbecomes established and the anomalous phenomena become the expected\nphenomena.\n\nRecent studies in cognitive neuroscience of brain activity during\nperiods of conceptual change support Kuhn\u2019s view that conceptual\nchange is hard to achieve. These studies examine the neural processes\nthat are involved in the recognition of anomalies and compare them\nwith the brain activity involved in the processing of information that\nis consistent with preferred theories. The studies suggest that the\ntwo types of data are processed differently (Dunbar et al. 2007).\n8. Methodologies of discovery\n\nAdvocates of the view that there are methodologies of discovery use\nthe term \u201clogic\u201d in the narrow sense of an algorithmic\nprocedure to generate new ideas. But like the AI-based theories of\nscientific discovery described in\n section 6,\n methodologies of scientific discovery interpret the concept\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d as a label for an extended process of\ngenerating and articulating new ideas and often describe the process\nin terms of problem solving. In these approaches, the distinction\nbetween the contexts of discovery and the context of justification is\nchallenged because the methodology of discovery is understood to play\na justificatory role. Advocates of a methodology of discovery usually\nrely on a distinction between different justification procedures,\njustification involved in the process of generating new knowledge and\njustification involved in testing it. Consequential or\n\u201cstrong\u201d justifications are methods of testing. The\njustification involved in discovery, by contrast, is conceived as\ngenerative (as opposed to consequential) justification\n (section 8.1)\n or as weak (as opposed to strong) justification\n (section 8.2).\n Again, some terminological ambiguity exists because according to some\nphilosophers, there are three contexts, not two: Only the initial\nconception of a new idea (the creative act is the context of discovery\nproper, and between it and justification there exists a separate\ncontext of pursuit (Laudan 1980). But many advocates of methodologies\nof discovery regard the context of pursuit as an integral part of the\nprocess of justification. They retain the notion of two contexts and\nre-draw the boundaries between the contexts of discovery and\njustification as they were drawn in the early 20th\ncentury.\n8.1 Discoverability\n\nThe methodology of discovery has sometimes been characterized as a\nform of justification that is complementary to the methodology of\ntesting (Nickles 1984, 1985, 1989). According to the methodology of\ntesting, empirical support for a theory results from successfully\ntesting the predictive consequences derived from that theory (and\nappropriate auxiliary assumptions). In light of this methodology,\njustification for a theory is \u201cconsequential\njustification,\u201d the notion that a hypothesis is established if\nsuccessful novel predictions are derived from the theory or\nclaim. Generative justification complements consequential\njustification. Advocates of generative justification hold that there\nexists an important form of justification in science that involves\nreasoning to a claim from data or previously established\nresults more generally.\n\nOne classic example for a generative methodology is the set of\nNewton\u2019s rules for the study of natural philosophy. According to\nthese rules, general propositions are established by deducing them\nfrom the phenomena. The notion of generative justification seeks to\npreserve the intuition behind classic conceptions of justification by\ndeduction. Generative justification amounts to the rational\nreconstruction of the discovery path in order to establish its\ndiscoverability had the researchers known what is known now,\nregardless of how it was first thought of (Nickles 1985, 1989). The\nreconstruction demonstrates in hindsight that the claim could have\nbeen discovered in this manner had the necessary information and\ntechniques been available. In other words, generative\njustification\u2014justification as \u201cdiscoverability\u201d or\n\u201cpotential discovery\u201d\u2014justifies a knowledge claim by\nderiving it from results that are already established. While\ngenerative justification does not retrace exactly those steps of the\nactual discovery path that were actually taken, it is a better\nrepresentation of scientists\u2019 actual practices than\nconsequential justification because scientists tend to construe new\nclaims from available knowledge. Generative justification is a weaker\nversion of the traditional ideal of justification by deduction from\nthe phenomena. Justification by deduction from the phenomena is\ncomplete if a theory or claim is completely determined from what we\nalready know. The demonstration of discoverability results from the\nsuccessful derivation of a claim or theory from the most basic and\nmost solidly established empirical information.\n8.2 Preliminary appraisal\n\nDiscoverability as described in the previous paragraphs is a mode of\njustification. Like the testing of novel predictions derived from a\nhypothesis, generative justification begins when the phase of finding\nand articulating a hypothesis worthy of assessing is drawing to a\nclose. Other approaches to the methodology of discovery are directly\nconcerned with the procedures involved in devising new hypotheses. The\nargument in favor of this kind of methodology is that the procedures\nof devising new hypotheses already include elements of appraisal.\nThese preliminary assessments have been termed \u201cweak\u201d\nevaluation procedures (Schaffner 1993). Weak evaluations are relevant\nduring the process of devising a new hypothesis. They provide reasons\nfor accepting a hypothesis as promising and worthy of further\nattention. Strong evaluations, by contrast, provide reasons for\naccepting a hypothesis as (approximately) true or confirmed. Both\n\u201cgenerative\u201d and \u201cconsequential\u201d testing as\ndiscussed in the previous section are strong evaluation procedures.\nStrong evaluation procedures are rigorous and systematically organized\naccording to the principles of hypothesis derivation or H-D testing. A\nmethodology of preliminary appraisal, by contrast, articulates\ncriteria for the evaluation of a hypothesis prior to rigorous\nderivation or testing. It aids the decision about whether to take that\nhypothesis seriously enough to develop it further and test it. For\nadvocates of this version of the methodology of discovery, it is the\ntask of philosophy of science to characterize sets of constraints and\nmethodological rules guiding the complex process of prior-to-test\nevaluation of hypotheses.\n\nIn contrast to the computational approaches discussed above,\nstrategies of preliminary appraisal are not regarded as\nsubject-neutral but as specific to particular fields of study.\nPhilosophers of biology, for instance, have developed a fine-grained\nframework to account for the generation and preliminary evaluation of\nbiological mechanisms (Darden 2002; Craver 2002; Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993; Craver and Darden 2013). Some philosophers have\nsuggested that the phase of preliminary appraisal be further divided\ninto two phases, the phase of appraising and the phase of revising.\nAccording to Lindley Darden, the phases of generation, appraisal and\nrevision of descriptions of mechanisms can be characterized as\nreasoning processes governed by reasoning strategies. Different\nreasoning strategies govern the different phases (Darden 1991, 2002;\nCraver 2002; Darden 2009). The generation of hypotheses about\nmechanisms, for instance, is governed by the strategy of \u201cschema\ninstantiation\u201d (see Darden 2002). The discovery of the mechanism\nof protein synthesis involved the instantiation of an abstract schema\nfor chemical reactions: reactant1 + reactant2 =\nproduct. The actual mechanism of protein synthesis was found through\nspecification and modification of this schema.\n\nNeither of these strategies is deemed necessary for discovery, and\nthey are not prescriptions for biological research. Rather, these\nstrategies are deemed sufficient for the discovery of mechanisms. The\nmethodology of the discovery of mechanisms is an extrapolation from\npast episodes of research on mechanisms and the result of a synthesis\nof rational reconstructions of several of these historical episodes.\nThe methodology of discovery is weakly normative in the sense that the\nstrategies for the discovery of mechanisms that were successful in the\npast may prove useful in future biological research (Darden 2002).\n8.3 Heuristic strategies\n\nAs philosophers of science have again become more attuned to actual\nscientific practices, interest in heuristic strategies has also been\nrevived. Many analysts now agree that discovery processes can be\nregarded as problem solving activities, whereby a discovery is a\nsolution to a problem. Heuristics-based methodologies of discovery are\nneither purely subjective and intuitive nor algorithmic or\nformalizable; the point is that reasons can be given for pursuing one\nor the other problem-solving strategy. These rules are open and do not\nguarantee a solution to a problem when applied (Ippoliti 2018). On\nthis view, scientific researchers are no longer seen as Kuhnian\n\u201cpuzzle solvers\u201d but as problem solvers and decision\nmakers in complex, variable, and changing environments (Wimsatt 2007).\n\n\nPhilosophers of discovery working in this tradition draw on a growing\nbody of literature in cognitive psychology, management science,\noperations research, and economy on human reasoning and decision\nmaking in contexts with limited information, under time constraints,\nand with sub-optimal means (Gigerenzer & Sturm 2012). Heuristic\nstrategies characterized in these studies, such as Gigerenzer\u2019s\n\u201ctools to theory heuristic\u201d are then applied to understand\nscientific knowledge generation (Gigerenzer 1992, Nickles 2018). Other\nanalysts specify heuristic strategies in a range of scientific fields,\nincluding climate science, neurobiology, and clinical medicine\n(Gramelsberger 2011, Schaffner 2008, Gillies 2018). Finally, in\nanalytic epistemology, formal methods are developed to identify and\nassess distinct heuristic strategies currently in use, such as\nBayesian reverse engineering in cognitive science (Zednik and\nJ\u00e4kel 2016). \n\nAs the literature on heuristics continues to grow, it has become clear\nthat the term \u201cheuristics\u201d is itself used in a variety of\ndifferent ways. (For a valuable taxonomy of meanings of\n\u201cheuristic,\u201d see Chow 2015, see also Ippoliti 2018.)\nMoreover, as in the context of earlier debates about computational\nheuristics, debates continue about the limitations of heuristics. The\nuse of heuristics may come at a cost if heuristics introduce\nsystematic biases (Wimsatt 2007). Some philosophers thus call for\ngeneral principles for the evaluation of heuristic strategies (Hey\n2016). \n9. Cognitive perspectives on discovery\n\nThe approaches to scientific discovery presented in the previous\nsections focus on the adoption, articulation, and preliminary\nevaluation of ideas or hypotheses prior to rigorous testing, not on\nhow a novel hypothesis or idea is first thought up. For a long time,\nthe predominant view among philosophers of discovery was that the\ninitial step of discovery is a mysterious intuitive leap of the human\nmind that cannot be analyzed further. More recent accounts of\ndiscovery informed by evolutionary biology also do not explicate how\nnew ideas are formed. The generation of new ideas is akin to random,\nblind variations of thought processes, which have to be inspected by\nthe critical mind and assessed as neutral, productive, or useless\n(Campbell 1960; see also Hull 1988), but the key processes by which\nnew ideas are generated are left unanalyzed.\n\nWith the recent rapprochement among philosophy of mind, cognitive\nscience and psychology and the increased integration of empirical\nresearch into philosophy of science, these processes have been\nsubmitted to closer analysis, and philosophical studies of creativity\nhave seen a surge of interest (e.g. Paul & Kaufman 2014a). The\ndistinctive feature of these studies is that they integrate\nphilosophical analyses with empirical work from cognitive science,\npsychology, evolutionary biology, and computational neuroscience\n(Thagard 2012). Analysts have distinguished different kinds and\ndifferent features of creative thinking and have examined certain\nfeatures in depth, and from new angles. Recent philosophical research\non creativity comprises conceptual analyses and integrated approaches\nbased on the assumption that creativity can be analyzed and\nthat empirical research can contribute to the analysis (Paul &\nKaufman 2014b). Two key elements of the cognitive processes involved\nin creative thinking that have been in the focus of philosophical\nanalysis are analogies\n (section 9.2)\n and mental models\n (section 9.3).\n9.1 Kinds and features of creativity\n\nGeneral definitions of creativity highlight novelty or originality and\nsignificance or value as distinctive features of a creative act or\nproduct (Sternberg & Lubart 1999, Kieran 2014, Paul & Kaufman\n2014b, although see Hills & Bird 2019). Different kinds of\ncreativity can be distinguished depending on whether the act or\nproduct is novel for a particular individual or entirely novel.\nPsychologist Margaret Boden distinguishes between psychological\ncreativity (P-creativity) and historical creativity (H-creativity).\nP-creativity is a development that is new, surprising and important to\nthe particular person who comes up with it. H-creativity, by contrast,\nis radically novel, surprising, and important\u2014it is generated\nfor the first time (Boden 2004). Further distinctions have been\nproposed, such as anthropological creativity (construed as a human\ncondition) and metaphysical creativity, a radically new thought or\naction in the sense that it is unaccounted for by antecedents and\navailable knowledge, and thus constitutes a radical break with the\npast (Kronfeldner 2009, drawing on Hausman 1984). \n\nPsychological studies analyze the personality traits and creative\nindividuals\u2019 behavioral dispositions that are conducive to\ncreative thinking. They suggest that creative scientists share certain\ndistinct personality traits, including confidence, openness,\ndominance, independence, introversion, as well as arrogance and\nhostility. (For overviews of recent studies on personality traits of\ncreative scientists, see Feist 1999, 2006: chapter 5).\n\nRecent work on creativity in philosophy of mind and cognitive science\noffers substantive analyses of the cognitive and neural mechanisms\ninvolved in creative thinking (Abrams 2018, Minai et al 2022) and\ncritical scrutiny of the romantic idea of genius creativity as\nsomething deeply mysterious (Blackburn 2014). Some of this research\naims to characterize features that are common to all creative\nprocesses, such as Thagard and Stewart\u2019s account according to\nwhich creativity results from combinations of representations (Thagard\n& Stewart 2011, but see Pasquale and Poirier 2016). Other research\naims to identify the features that are distinctive of scientific\ncreativity as opposed to other forms of creativity, such as artistic\ncreativity or creative technological invention (Simonton 2014).\n9.2 Analogy\n\nMany philosophers of science highlight the role of analogy in the\ndevelopment of new knowledge, whereby analogy is understood as a\nprocess of bringing ideas that are well understood in one domain to\nbear on a new domain (Thagard 1984; Holyoak and Thagard 1996). An\nimportant source for philosophical thought about analogy is Mary\nHesse\u2019s conception of models and analogies in theory\nconstruction and development. In this approach, analogies are\nsimilarities between different domains. Hesse introduces the\ndistinction between positive, negative, and neutral analogies (Hesse\n1966: 8). If we consider the relation between gas molecules and a\nmodel for gas, namely a collection of billiard balls in random motion,\nwe will find properties that are common to both domains (positive\nanalogy) as well as properties that can only be ascribed to the model\nbut not to the target domain (negative analogy). There is a positive\nanalogy between gas molecules and a collection of billiard balls\nbecause both the balls and the molecules move randomly. There is a\nnegative analogy between the domains because billiard balls are\ncolored, hard, and shiny but gas molecules do not have these\nproperties. The most interesting properties are those properties of\nthe model about which we do not know whether they are positive or\nnegative analogies. This set of properties is the neutral analogy.\nThese properties are the significant properties because they might\nlead to new insights about the less familiar domain. From our\nknowledge about the familiar billiard balls, we may be able to derive\nnew predictions about the behavior of gas molecules, which we could\nthen test.\n\nHesse offers a more detailed analysis of the structure of analogical\nreasoning through the distinction between horizontal and vertical\nanalogies between domains. Horizontal analogies between two domains\nconcern the sameness or similarity between properties of both domains.\nIf we consider sound and light waves, there are similarities between\nthem: sound echoes, light reflects; sound is loud, light is bright,\nboth sound and light are detectable by our senses. There are also\nrelations among the properties within one domain, such as the causal\nrelation between sound and the loud tone we hear and, analogously,\nbetween physical light and the bright light we see. These analogies\nare vertical analogies. For Hesse, vertical analogies hold the key for\nthe construction of new theories.\n\nAnalogies play several roles in science. Not only do they contribute\nto discovery but they also play a role in the development and\nevaluation of scientific theories. Current discussions about analogy\nand discovery have expanded and refined Hesse\u2019s approach in\nvarious ways. Some philosophers have developed criteria for evaluating\nanalogy arguments (Bartha 2010). Other work has identified highly\nsignificant analogies that were particularly fruitful for the\nadvancement of science (Holyoak and Thagard 1996: 186\u2013188;\nThagard 1999: chapter 9). The majority of analysts explore the\nfeatures of the cognitive mechanisms through which aspects of a\nfamiliar domain or source are applied to an unknown target domain in\norder to understand what is unknown. According to the influential\nmulti-constraint theory of analogical reasoning developed by Holyoak\nand Thagard, the transfer processes involved in analogical reasoning\n(scientific and otherwise) are guided or constrained in three main\nways: 1) by the direct similarity between the elements involved; 2) by\nthe structural parallels between source and target domain; as well as\n3) by the purposes of the investigators, i.e., the reasons why the\nanalogy is considered. Discovery, the formulation of a new hypothesis,\nis one such purpose.\n\n\u201cIn vivo\u201d investigations of scientists reasoning in their\nlaboratories have not only shown that analogical reasoning is a key\ncomponent of scientific practice, but also that the distance between\nsource and target depends on the purpose for which analogies are\nsought. Scientists trying to fix experimental problems draw analogies\nbetween targets and sources from highly similar domains. In contrast,\nscientists attempting to formulate new models or concepts draw\nanalogies between less similar domains. Analogies between radically\ndifferent domains, however, are rare (Dunbar 1997, 2001).\n9.3 Mental models\n\nIn current cognitive science, human cognition is often explored in\nterms of model-based reasoning. The starting point of this approach is\nthe notion that much of human reasoning, including probabilistic and\ncausal reasoning as well as problem solving takes place through mental\nmodeling rather than through the application of logic or\nmethodological criteria to a set of propositions (Johnson-Laird 1983;\nMagnani et al. 1999; Magnani and Nersessian 2002). In model-based\nreasoning, the mind constructs a structural representation of a\nreal-world or imaginary situation and manipulates this structure. In\nthis perspective, conceptual structures are viewed as models and\nconceptual innovation as constructing new models through various\nmodeling operations. Analogical reasoning\u2014analogical\nmodeling\u2014is regarded as one of three main forms of model-based\nreasoning that appear to be relevant for conceptual innovation in\nscience. Besides analogical modeling, visual modeling and simulative\nmodeling or thought experiments also play key roles (Nersessian 1992,\n1999, 2009). These modeling practices are constructive in that they\naid the development of novel mental models. The key elements of\nmodel-based reasoning are the call on knowledge of generative\nprinciples and constraints for physical models in a source domain and\nthe use of various forms of abstraction. Conceptual innovation results\nfrom the creation of new concepts through processes that abstract and\nintegrate source and target domains into new models (Nersessian\n2009).\n\nSome critics have argued that despite the large amount of work on the\ntopic, the notion of mental model is not sufficiently clear. Thagard\nseeks to clarify the concept by characterizing mental models in terms\nof neural processes (Thagard 2010). In his approach, mental models are\nproduced through complex patterns of neural firing, whereby the\nneurons and the interconnections between them are dynamic and\nchanging. A pattern of firing neurons is a representation when there\nis a stable causal correlation between the pattern or activation and\nthe thing that is represented. In this research, questions about the\nnature of model-based reasoning are transformed into questions about\nthe brain mechanisms that produce mental representations.\n\nThe above sections again show that the study of scientific discovery\nintegrates different approaches, combining conceptual analysis of\nprocesses of knowledge generation with empirical work on creativity,\ndrawing heavily and explicitly on current research in psychology and\ncognitive science, and on in vivo laboratory observations, as\nwell as brain imaging techniques (Kounios & Beeman 2009, Thagard\n& Stewart 2011).\n10. Machine discovery\n\nEarlier critics of AI-based theories of scientific discoveries argued\nthat a computer cannot devise new concepts but is confined to the\nconcepts included in the given computer language (Hempel 1985:\n119\u2013120). It cannot design new experiments, instruments, or\nmethods. Subsequent computational research on scientific discovery was\ndriven by the motivation to contribute computational tools to aid\nscientists in their research (Addis et al. 2016). It appears that\ncomputational methods can be used to generate new results leading to\nrefereed scientific publications in astrophysics, cancer research,\necology, and other fields (Langley 2000). However, the philosophical\ndiscussion has continued about the question of whether these methods\nreally generate new knowledge or whether they merely speed up data\nprocessing. It is also still an open question whether data-intensive\nscience is fundamentally different from traditional research, for\ninstance regarding the status of hypothesis or theory in\ndata-intensive research (Pietsch 2015). \n\nIn the wake of recent developments in machine learning, some older\ndiscussions about automated discovery have been revived. The\navailability of vastly improved computational tools and software for\ndata analysis has stimulated new discussions about computer-generated\ndiscovery (see Leonelli 2020). It is largely uncontroversial that\nmachine learning tools can aid discovery, for instance in research on\nantibiotics (Stokes et al, 2020). The notion of \u201crobot\nscientist\u201d is mostly used metaphorically, and the vision that\nhuman scientists may one day be replaced by computers \u2013 by\nsuccessors of the laboratory automation systems \u201cAdam\u201d and\n\u201cEve\u201d, allegedly the first \u201crobot scientists\u201d\n\u2013 is evoked in writings for broader audiences (see King et al.\n2009, Williams et al. 2015, for popularized descriptions of these\nsystems), although some interesting ethical challenges do arise from\n\u201csuperhuman AI\u201d (see Russell 2021). It also appears that,\non the notion that products of creative acts are both novel and\nvaluable, AI systems should be called \u201ccreative,\u201d an\nimplication which not all analysts will find plausible (Boden\n2014)\n\nPhilosophical analyses focus on various questions arising from the\nprocesses involving human-machine complexes. One issue relevant to the\nproblem of scientific discovery arises from the opacity of machine\nlearning. If machine learning indeed escapes human understanding, how\ncan we be warranted to say that knowledge or understanding is\ngenerated by deep learning tools? Might we have reason to say that\nhumans and machines are \u201cco-developers\u201d of knowledge\n(Tamaddoni-Nezhad et al. 2021)? \n11. Social epistemology and discovery\n\nNew perspectives on scientific discovery have also opened up in the\ncontext of social epistemology (see Goldman & O\u2019Connor\n2021). Social epistemology investigates knowledge production as a\ngroup process, specifically the epistemic effects of group composition\nin terms of cognitive diversity and unity and social interactions\nwithin groups or institutions such as testimony and trust, peer\ndisagreement and critique, and group justification, among others. On\nthis view, discovery is a collective achievement, and the task is to\nexplore how assorted social-epistemic activities or practices have an\nimpact on the knowledge generated by groups in question. There are\nobvious implications for debates about scientific discovery of recent\nresearch in the different branches of social epistemology. Social\nepistemologists have examined individual cognitive agents in their\nroles as group members (as providers of information or as critics) and\nthe interactions among these members (Longino 2001), groups as\naggregates of diverse agents, or the entire group as\nepistemic agent (e.g., Koons 2021, Dragos 2019).  \n\n\nStandpoint theory, for instance, explores the role of outsiders in\nknowledge generation, considering how the sociocultural structures and\npractices in which individuals are embedded aid or obstruct the\ngeneration of creative ideas. According to standpoint theorists,\npeople with standpoint are politically aware and politically engaged\npeople outside the mainstream. Because people with standpoint have\ndifferent experiences and access to different domains of expertise\nthan most members of a culture, they can draw on rich conceptual\nresources for creative thinking (Solomon 2007). \n\nSocial epistemologists examining groups as aggregates of agents\nconsider to what extent diversity among group members is conducive to\nknowledge production and whether and to what extent beliefs and\nattitudes must be shared among group members to make collective\nknowledge possible (Bird 2014). This is still an open question. Some\nformal approaches to model the influence of diversity on knowledge\ngeneration suggest that cognitive diversity is beneficial to\ncollective knowledge generation (Weisberg and Muldoon 2009), but\nothers have criticized the model (Alexander et al (2015), see also\nThoma (2015) and Poyh\u00f6nen (2017) for further discussion). \n 12. Integrated approaches to knowledge generation\n\nThis essay has illustrated that philosophy of discovery has come full\ncircle. Philosophy of discovery has once again become a thriving field\nof philosophical study, now intersecting with, and drawing on\nphilosophical and empirical studies of creative thinking, problem\nsolving under uncertainty, collective knowledge production, and\nmachine learning. Recent approaches to discovery are typically\nexplicitly interdisciplinary and integrative, cutting across previous\ndistinctions among hypothesis generation and theory building, data\ncollection, assessment, and selection; as well as\ndescriptive-analytic, historical, and normative perspectives (Danks\n& Ippoliti 2018, Michel 2021). The goal no longer is to provide\none overarching account of scientific discovery but to produce\nmultifaceted analyses of past and present activities of knowledge\ngeneration in all their complexity and heterogeneity that are\nilluminating to the non-scientist and the scientific researcher alike.\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": [" Abraham, A. 2019, <em>The Neuroscience of Creativity,</em>\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Addis, M., Sozou, P.D., Gobet, F. and Lane, P.
