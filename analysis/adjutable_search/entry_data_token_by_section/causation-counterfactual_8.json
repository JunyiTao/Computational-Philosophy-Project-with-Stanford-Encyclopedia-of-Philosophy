    "main_text": "The Structural Equations Framework || SEF and Counterfactuals\n5.2 SEF and Counterfactuals\n\nThose who have pursued the SEF approach to providing an analysis of\n\u2018actual\u2019 causation \u2013 that is, the causal relation\nbetween actual, particular events \u2013 have had very little to say\nabout the semantics of the counterfactuals that underpin SEF. Some\nauthors (e.g. Hitchcock 2001) explicitly \u2013 and many authors\nimplicitly \u2013 assume a broadly Lewisian approach to\ncounterfactuals, so that the structural equations are representations\nof relations of facts about counterfactual dependence \u2013 as\ndescribed above \u2013 whose truth conditions are broadly\nLewisian.\n\nOn the other hand, one might go in the other direction, using the SEF\napproach to deliver the truth conditions for counterfactuals by\ntreating the structural equations (such as SH = ST) as\nrepresentations of causal dependency relationships, which in\nturn deliver those truth conditions (Galles & Pearl 1998, Woodward\nand Hitchcock 2003, Schulz 2011, Briggs 2012). Relatedly, one might\neschew a Lewisian, miracle-based conception of an intervention and\ndefine interventions in explicitly causal terms (see e.g. Woodward and\nHitchcock 2003: 12\u201313).\n\nThe choice between these two different ways of proceeding connects\nwith the broader debate about whether causation should be analysed in\nterms of counterfactuals or vice versa. Lewis, of course, takes the\nformer approach. One attraction of doing so \u2013 at least for him\n\u2013 is that it fits within a broadly Humean agenda: since\ncausation is a modal notion, it threatens the thesis of Humean\nsupervenience (Lewis 1986a, ix) unless it can somehow we cashed out in\nterms of similarity relations between worlds, where those similarity\nrelations do not appeal in turn to causal (or other Humean\nsupervenience-violating) features of worlds. Lewis\u2019s analysis of\ncounterfactuals, together with his analysis of laws, turns that trick.\nBy contrast, other authors have argued that the trick simply cannot be\nturned: we cannot analyse counterfactuals without appealing to\ncausation (Edgington 2011).\n\nThere are deep metaphysical issues at stake here, then: one might view\nthe SEF approach as offering a more sophisticated variant of\nLewis\u2019s approach that shares the reductionist aspirations of\nthat approach. Or one might \u2013 especially if one is sceptical\nabout the prospects for those reductionist aspirations \u2013 take\nthe SEF approach in anti-reductionist spirit, viewing it not as a way\nof defining causation in non-causal terms but rather as a way of\nextracting useful and sophisticated causal information from an\ninherently causal model of a given complex situation.\n",
