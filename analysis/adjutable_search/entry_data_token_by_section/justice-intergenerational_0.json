How Intergenerational Relations Differ from Relations Among Contemporaries\n\nIt may seem that considerations of justice do not apply to\nintergenerational relations, because there is a lack of direct\nreciprocity between generations of people who are not contemporaries.\nAmong non-contemporaries, there is no mutual cooperation and there are\nno exchanges in kind (see Barry 1989b: 189\u2013203; Barry 1991:\n231\u2013234; Heyd 2009a: 167\u2013176; but see Gosseries 2009,\nMazor 2010, and Brandstedt 2015 for conceptions of indirect and\ntransgenerational reciprocity that do not require that the initial\ncontributor is among the final beneficiaries). This fact about the\nrelations between present and remote past or future generations is\nclosely related to a second feature of intergenerational relations:\nthe permanent asymmetry in power-relations between living people and\nthose who will live in the future. These power relations are\nqualitatively different from those among contemporaries, which are\nrelatively fluid and subject to change (Barry 1977: 243\u201344;\nBarry 1989b: 189).\n\nNot only can the present generation influence the conduct of future\npeople by affecting their desires and circumstances, it can also\nexercise power by setting back the interests of future generations. It\ncan, for example, pursue a natural-resource policy with long-term\nnegative consequences. In this case, the present generation imposes\nupon future generations the risk of having their options reduced to an\ninadequate range\u2014unless, that is, future generations will have\navailable to them and can afford to use technologies that allow them\nto adapt to the circumstances (Barry 1999; Beckerman 1999; Heyward\n2017). By contrast, remote future people cannot at all affect the\nwell-being of the lives of the presently living, at least not today\nand according to conceptions of well-being that have a subjective\ncomponent. Still, such future people might nevertheless be considered\nable to set back the interests of or even wrong present or past\npersons insofar as the latter have, or had, interests with respect to\nposthumous future states of affairs. In the same way, the presently\nliving may be morally constrained in their actions that relate to\npeople who lived in the remote past (see\n \u00a75.4).\n\nThird, those presently alive can affect the very existence of future\npeople (whether or not future people will exist), the number of future\npeople (how many future people will exist), and the identity of future\npeople (who will exist). In short: future people\u2019s existence,\nnumber, and specific identity depend (are contingent) upon currently\nliving people\u2019s decisions and actions. A decision taken by\npresent generations could conceivably result in the termination of\nhuman life (see, e.g., Scheffler 2013; Mulgan 2015; McKinnon 2017);\nthere is a long tradition of institutionalized population policy whose\ngoal is to control the size of future generations (see, e.g., McMahan\n1981); and, more prosaically, a couple can certainly decide whether or\nnot to have children (see\n \u00a72.2\n and\n \u00a73.2).\n Furthermore, many of our decisions have indirect effects on how many\npeople will live and who they are, for many of our decisions affect\nwho meets whom and who decides to have children with whom. To explain\nsuch \u201cdifferent people choices\u201d, Parfit adopts the genetic\nidentity view of personal identity: the identity of a person is at\nleast in part constituted by the DNA the person has as a result of\nwhich ovum was fertilized by this or that spermatozoon in the creation\nof this person. Our actions thus have an effect on the genetic\nidentity of future people in so far as they affect from which\nparticular pairs of cells future people will grow\u2014and any action\nthat affects people\u2019s reproductive choices, directly or\nindirectly, will do that. Many of our actions in fact have an indirect\neffect on when future people will be conceived. If we decide between\ntwo long-term policies regarding the use of natural resources, for\nexample, we know that depending on which we choose, different (and\nmost likely also a different number of) future people will come into\nexistence. For example, the European Commission finds that more than\none million babies may have been produced as a result of the Erasmus\nProgramme (the European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of\nUniversity Students, and with more than three million students\nparticipating since 1987), most of who would very likely not have come\nto existence without at least one of their parents participating in\nthe Programme (European Commission 2014: 130\u2013131).\n\nBy contrast, when we make decisions affecting our contemporaries, we\ndo not face different people choices. Our decisions may affect their\nexistence only with respect to their survival; their number only with\nrespect to how many survive; their identity only in the sense that we\nmight be in a position to change their conditions of life, character,\nand self-understanding. Of course, we can affect neither the number\nnor the identity of past generations.\n\nLastly, our knowledge of the future is limited. While we can know the\nparticular identities of presently existing people (and very many\npreviously living people), we are normally not in a position to refer\nto specifically identifiable future persons. It is not that all\npredictions about the future decrease in certainty at some constant\nrate (see Cowen & Parfit 1992: 148). Indeed, many predictions are\nmore likely to be true concerning the further future than the more\nimmediate future. For example, the prediction that some policy will\nhave changed or that certain resources will have been exhausted is\nmore likely to be true in the further future. Nonetheless, we cannot\nknow the specific identities of persons in the further future. Our\nlack of certain knowledge of the future also means that we often will\nbe in a position to know at best merely the likelihood of normatively\nrelevant consequences of alternative long-term policies.\n\nThese differences between our relations to one another and our\nrelations to subsequent or antecedent generations give rise to a\nnumber of important debates. Among them are the following: The first\nconcerns the normative significance of the non-changeable fact that\nremote future people as well as deceased people do not even have the\npotential for exercising power over presently living people. According\nto the Will Theory, for a person to have a right vis-\u00e0-vis\nanother person requires the former to be able to exercise his or her\nrights with respect to the conduct of the latter (Hart 1955:\n183\u2013184; Hart 1982: 183; Wellman 1995: 91\u201392; Steiner\n1994: 59\u201373). Thus, the unchangeable power-asymmetry among\nnon-contemporaries will exclude the possibility of future\nnon-contemporaries and deceased people being bearers of rights claims\nagainst presently living people (Steiner 1983; Steiner 1994:\n249\u2013261; Fabre 2001; see also Ackerman 1980: 70\u201375).\nConsequently, for the proponents of the Will Theory considerations of\njustice (as understood in this entry) do not apply to\nintergenerational relations. According to the Interest Theory of\nRights (Raz 1984; Raz 1986: 166\u2013188; Raz 1994: 45\u201351;\nKramer 1998: 60\u2013101) being able to exercise one\u2019s\nrights\u2014to demand or waive the enforcement of a right\u2014is\nneither sufficient nor necessary for someone to be the bearer of the\nright. For a person to hold a right, the right, when actual,\nnecessarily preserves one or more of the persons\u2019 interests\n(Kramer 1998: 62). Understanding the relations between currently\nliving people and future non-contemporaries in terms of justice\nassumes that for a person to have a valid justice claim\nvis-\u00e0-vis another person (who stands under the correlative\nduties) does not depend upon being able to harm or benefit the other\nperson (Barry 1989b: chs. 4\u20136; Buchanan 1990; but see Gauthier\n1986; Heyd 2009a; Hiskes 2009: 9).\n\nThe second debate concerns the normative significance of the\ncontingency of future people upon currently living people\u2019s\ndecisions and actions. If and insofar as the existence, identity, or\nnumber of future people depend upon present decisions and actions, to\nwhat extent can the former be said to be harmed by the latter?\nFurthermore, can presently existing persons, in making such decisions,\nbe guided by the interests of future persons? These are the questions\nthat underlie the so-called \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d (see\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74;\n see also entry on\n nonidentity problem).\n\nThe third debate concerns the status of previously living people. Is\nit possible for currently living people to harm past people, and do\ncurrently living people have duties toward them? (See\n \u00a75)\n\nOther important debates include the interpretation of the significance\nof our limited knowledge of the future. As we know at best merely the\nlikelihood of the differing consequences of alternative policies, how\nshould we assess the imposition of differing risks on and the likely\nor uncertain provision of benefits for future people? (See, e.g.,\nBirnbacher 1988: 140\u2013172, 175\u2013179; Jonas\u2019 notion of\na \u201cHeuristik der Furcht\u201d (heuristics of fear) in\n1979: 63\u201364; Mintz-Woo 2019). Some focus on how how to assess\nthe imposition of differing risks of rights violations (see, e.g.,\nMcCarthy 1997; Oberdiek 2012; Perry 2014; Meyer & Stelzer 2018).\nAnother issue is whether we have reasons to discount the future in the\nsense of discounting future persons\u2019 well-being (see, e.g.,\nSidgwick 1907 [1981: 414]; Ramsey 1928: 261; Rawls 1971: 263; Parfit\n1984: appendix F; Cowen & Parfit 1992; Broome 1994; Mintz-Woo\nforthcoming). A further debate concerns the motivation that currently\nliving have for fulfilling their supposed duties to future people,\ngiven that currently living people know neither future people\u2019s\nindividual identities nor their particular preferences. Partly due to\nthese features as well as the unchangeable asymmetry in\npower-relations between currently living people and remote future\ngenerations, currently living people\u2019s compliance with their\nobligations to remote future people is likely to be less reliable (see\nBirnbacher 2009)\n\nThe entry will report on the second and third debates as they are\ncentrally important for understanding the very possibility of\nintergenerational justice. In both debates one needs to be clear about\nhow one assesses an act as harmful or beneficial. Owing to the death\nof the bearer of interests and the contingency of future people the\nway in which currently living people can be said to harm or benefit\npreviously living and future people is problematic. According to the\nso-called person-affecting view, an act can be wrong only if that act\nharms, or will harm or can be expected to harm, a person who does or\nwill exist (see especially Parfit 1984: 363, 295\u2013396; Heyd 1992\nand 2014: 2\u20133; Boonin 2008; Roberts 2013). One important issue\nis whether one should adopt a person-affecting view or an impersonal\nview. Some interpret duties of intergenerational justice on the basis\nof what might be called a weak person-affecting view. According to\nthis view, in assessing whether an act is harmful or wrongful what\nmatters is what has been done to a particular existing or future\nperson. A weakly person-affecting assessment does not require that the\nact under scrutiny make an existing or future person worse off or harm\nthat person by comparing how well off the person was before.\nConcerning the questions of whether a future person will be harmed or\nwronged by having been brought into existence under certain conditions\nthe weak person affecting view relies neither on a comparison with the\nstate the person would have been in had she not been brought into\nexistence, that is with the person\u2019s never-ever existing, nor on\na comparison with how well off other people would have been had\ncurrently living people acted differently. Never-ever existing and\npotentially existing people do not count; only those people who\nactually exist at some time count.\n\nThis weak person-affecting view stands in contrast to a strong\nperson-affecting view according to which an act or action harms a\nperson only if the same person is worse off than she would otherwise\nat that time have been. Both the weak and the strong person-affecting\nviews differ from impersonal views according to which the value of\nstates of affairs is not reducible to their effect on the interests of\nactual people. Currently living people ought to choose to bring about\nthe state of affairs in which more of the morally relevant values will\nbe realized irrespective of who the people are who will live. Many\ntheorists claim that a plausible understanding of intergenerational\nethics must be impersonal or must combine person-affecting and\nimpersonal considerations (see especially J. Harris 1992: 94\u201395;\nSinger 1998; Buchanan et al. 2000: 249; Harman 2004: 101\u2013102;\nMcBrayer 2008: 304; Holtug 2009: 71\u201392; McMahan 2009:\n49\u201368; Temkin 2012: 313\u2013362; Williams & Harris 2014:\n347; Heyd\u2019s interpretation of Parfit 2011 in Heyd 2014; Parfit\n2017). The differences between the person-affecting and impersonal\nunderstandings will come to the fore in\n Section 2.2\n and\n Section 3\n on intergenerational duties that reflect what is owed to future\npeople as a matter of justice as well as in\n Section 4.6\n on the limits of a rights-based account of intergenerational\nethics.\n",
