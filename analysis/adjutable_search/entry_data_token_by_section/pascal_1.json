    "main_text": "Nature and Grace\n2. Nature and Grace\n\n\nPascal's philosophical reflections are dominated by a theological\ninterpretation of the human condition that he claimed to have borrowed\nfrom Saint Augustine. On this view, Adam's fall from grace resulted in\na human nature that is essentially corrupt, and there is no\npossibility of recovery by natural means or human effort.  This\ntheological perspective determined Pascal's views about human freedom,\nand about ethics and politics; it also set extra-philosophical limits\nto his theory of knowledge, and prompted the negative assessment that\nhe adopted, during the final years of his life, of the value of\nscientific or mathematical research.\n\n\nFollowing Augustine, Pascal emphasized the extent to which any\nrecovery from the fallen state of human nature was a gift from God,\nwhich could not be earned or deserved in any way by human agents. This\ndivine gift included, as one of its elements, religious faith itself,\nthat is, the capacity of humans to believe the theological\ninterpretation on which the implied worldview depended. Other\nphilosophical commentators on Christian belief in the seventeenth\ncentury, such as John Locke or John Toland, argued that what a\nChristian is invited to believe must be intelligible; according to\nthem, there were no mysteries in Christianity if that term includes\npropositions that we cannot understand. Thus religious faith merely\ncompensated for a lack of evidence in support of a particular\nproposition, and made it possible for a Christian to accept it as true\n(Clarke, 2011). For Pascal, however, faith provides appropriately\ndisposed Christians with a means to transcend the limits of what is\nintelligible and to accept as true even matters that they cannot\nunderstand. To claim otherwise would be to set limits to the reality\nof God and to reduce religious faith to the compass of human\nunderstanding. The Pens\u00e9es suggest: \u201cif one\nsubmits everything to reason, our religion will contain nothing that\nis mysterious or supernatural\u201d (Fragment 162: II, 602). Thus\nthose who are given the gift of genuine religious faith are expected\nnot only to accept things that are uncertain but, especially, to\naccede to realities that are incomprehensible. Pascal offered no\nexplanation of how this was possible.\n\n\nThis degree of incomprehensibility in the content of religious belief\nis consistent with a corresponding relativism about the competing\nclaims of different religious traditions. For example, each religion\nor each Christian sect might be understood as an alternative and\nequally uncertain perspective on the transcendent. However, Pascal was\nas committed to the exclusive truth of Catholicism, and even to his\npreferred interpretation of that tradition, as he was unwavering in\nhis belief in mysteries. \u201cI see several inconsistent religions,\nall of which except one are false. Each one wishes to be believed on\nthe basis of its own authority and threatens unbelievers. I therefore\ndo not believe them for that reason\u201d (Fragment 184: II,\n608). For Pascal, the Roman Catholic Church was the only true church,\n\u201coutside of which I am fully convinced there is no\nsalvation\u201d (Provincial Letters: I, 781).\n\n\nIn contrast therefore with many of his contemporaries in France, such\nas Descartes or Malebranche, Pascal also rejected the suggestion that\none could prove the existence of God by rational arguments. \u201cThe\nmetaphysical proofs \u2026 have little value\u201d (Fragment 179:\nII, 605). A fortiori, he rejected the view adopted by Malebranche,\nthat we have no basis for believing the alleged content of revelation\nunless we have a prior proof that there exists a God who is capable of\ncommunicating with us. For Pascal, reason was completely inadequate to\nthe task of relating to a transcendent divinity, and the only way to\nGod was by \u2018faith\u2019.\n\n\nThus the discussion of wagering in favour of religious belief in the\nPens\u00e9es (Fragment 397: II, 676\u201381), which Pascal\ndrafted and revised a number of times, was written from the\nperspective of someone who already believed in God, and who assumed\nthat their belief was itself a gift from God. Pascal had independently\nstudied the mathematics of gambling, and while considering how to\ncompose an apology or defence of Christianity, he reviewed ways in\nwhich a committed Christian might adapt the logic of wagering to show\nthat their belief is not unreasonable. However, according to Pascal's\ndeepest theological convictions, nothing that he wrote in this context\ncould persuade an unbeliever to become a believer in any sense that\ncould lead to salvation. No one can communicate religious faith in\nPascal's sense to others by reasoning or wagering, nor can such faith\nbe self-induced by the same methods. For Pascal, a decision to believe\nGod's revelation (in the relevant sense of \u2018believe\u2019) is\nnot based on rational calculation nor, as indicated above, does it\npresuppose a philosophical argument in favour of God's existence. A\ncalculation of the probability of one's wager is logically posterior\nto belief, and it purports to show only that those who have accepted\ndivine grace and believed in God have made a wager that is not\nunreasonable. Why? Because the significance or value of the belief as\na means to eternal salvation would, if it were true, compensate for\nits relative implausibility.\n\n\nThe various kinds of divine assistance (or, in the language of\ntheology, grace) by which human beings may overcome their Fallen\ncondition were the subject of intense theological controversy in the\nseventeenth century. The Church had condemned as heretical the\nPelagian theory that human beings could achieve eternal salvation by\nthe use of their unaided, natural powers. Various opinions to the\neffect that they could make some independent contribution to this\nprocess were equally condemned as semi-Pelagian. These suggestions\nwere thought to deny or mitigate the exclusive efficacy of the\nIncarnation. Jansenism represented a starkly exclusive interpretation\nof how God's assistance enabled Fallen human beings to recover from\nthe effect of Original Sin by the influence of \u2018efficacious\ngrace\u2019. However, such a unilateral interpretation of God's\nintervention seemed to make human effort redundant. Pascal mocked the\nsuggestion that God assisted weak human beings by means of a\n\u2018sufficient grace\u2019 which was not sufficient, and that this\ninsufficient grace required an independent contribution from human\nagents. \u201cBy sufficient grace you mean a grace that is not\nsufficient\u201d (Provincial Letters: I, 601). In response\nto what he understood as various degrees of Pelagianism, Pascal\ndefended the theory that no human effort could\ncontribute to salvation, even as a partial cause, and that God's agency is\ncompletely efficacious if He chooses freely to assist undeserving\nsinners.\n\n\nThis controversy about the relative efficacy of God's grace\nwas most evident in the discussion of free will, and in Pascal's\naccount of how we come to know the truth about radically different\nkinds of reality, the natural and the supernatural.\n",
