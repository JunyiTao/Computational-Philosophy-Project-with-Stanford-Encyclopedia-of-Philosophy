Personal and Intellectual Development\n\n\nRosenzweig was born in 1886, and grew up as the only child of Georg\nand Adele Rosenzweig, in an intellectually and culturally vibrant,\nassimilated Jewish home in Kassel. After beginning his university\nstudies in 1904 with the intention of studying medicine, first in\nG\u00f6ttingen and then in Munich, Rosenzweig moved in the fall of 1906\nto Freiburg. The University of Freiburg was one of the centers of the\nSouthwest school of neo-Kantianism at the time, and Rosenzweig studied\nphilosophy there with Heinrich Rickert and Jonas Cohn, and history with\nFriedrich Meinecke. By the early months of 1908, Rosenzweig had decided\nto write a dissertation on the genesis of Hegel\u2019s political\nphilosophy under Meinecke.\n",
