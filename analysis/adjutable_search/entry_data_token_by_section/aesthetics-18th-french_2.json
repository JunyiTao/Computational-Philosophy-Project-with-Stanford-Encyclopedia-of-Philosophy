    "main_text": "Cartesian Beauty\n3. Cartesian Beauty\n\nAlthough this turn towards subjectivism and sensualism represented a\nmajor innovation in aesthetics, Descartes was still a dominant\ninfluence on French thought of the eighteenth century, and his\nphilosophy was applied to theories of beauty, even though he wrote\nlittle on the topic. Scholars such as Crousaz and Andr\u00e9\nproposed objective measures of beauty, as Descartes did with truth,\nthat could be applied to any object. This standard would ideally\ntranscend the vicissitudes of fashion, personal biases, or cultural\ndifferences.\n\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz, a professor of logic and mathematics in\nLausanne, Switzerland, published his Treatise on Beauty in\n1715. He does not offer original ideas on the nature of the beautiful;\nhe takes up the old dictum that it is a mix of unity and diversity, so\nas to preserve order and proportion from both caprice and monotony.\nBut he approaches it with a new awareness of the constraints and\nprejudices that obstruct the way:\n\n\nEveryone possesses [an idea of the beautiful], but since it hardly\never appears alone we do not reflect upon it and fail to distinguish\nit from the tangle of other ideas which appear alongside it. (1715\n[AT: 390])\n\n\nThe root of this difficulty lies in the duality of human\nfaculties:\n\n\nSometimes ideas and feelings are in agreement with each other and an\nobject merits the qualification \u201cbeautiful\u201d on both\ncounts. Sometimes, however, reason and feelings are at war with each\nother and then an object pleases and at the same time does not: from\none perspective it is beautiful, while from another it lacks beauty.\n(1715 [AT: 392])\n\n\nCrousaz is not satisfied with this duality; on the contrary, he\nbelieves we have a responsibility to discover\n\n\nwhich principles regulate our approbation when we judge something from\nideas only [or, as he likes to say, \u201ccoolly\u201d] and find it\nbeautiful independently of feeling. (1715 [AT: 393])\n\n\nTaste is a forerunner of what reason would have approved, had it time\nenough to weigh everything relevant to a judgment. Crousaz finally\nreconciles knowledge with sensations, a fact that appears to testify\nin favor of God\u2019s wisdom. Similar ideas are also to be found in\nminor authors such as Frain du Tremblay, Brumoy, or Trublet.\n\nYves-Marie Andr\u00e9\u2019s Essay on Beauty (1741) covers\nthe same territory, but with a strong influence from Malebranche. In\naccordance with the Cartesian distinction between ideas (innate,\nadventitious, and fictitious), Andr\u00e9 suggests several notions\nof beauty. Essential beauty is \u201cindependent of any\ninstitution, even divine\u201d and so is identified with what is\nuniversal, immutable, and recognizable by divine Reason.\nNatural beauty concerns the whole range of created things; it\nis \u201cindependent of any human opinion\u201d but follows from\nGod\u2019s will; it is present in the harmony and finality of nature.\nThe lowest degree of beauty is the product of human activity and is\npartly arbitrary, because it combines intellectual as well as sensual\ningredients. This arbitrary beauty that speaks to the eye and\near is itself organized into three levels: genius, taste, and caprice\n(in descending order). Only genius is recognizable by our reason, when\nthe latter is adequately supported by other faculties. Andr\u00e9\nsummarizes:\n\n\nI call beautiful not what pleases to imagination\u2019s first\nsight\u2014but what has a right to please reason and reflection by\nits own excellence. (Essay on Beauty quoted in Becq 1994: 419\n[translation by J. Morizot])\n\n\nFor him, there is no distinction between beauty and\ntruth, and this is the very definition of the aesthetics of\nperfection. But aesthetic feeling is a normal affective accompaniment\nof any act of creation or reception, and the distinguishing feature of\nhumankind as a species.\n\nCharles Batteux had somewhat different goals. When he published\nThe Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle in 1746, he took\nup a challenge: to establish Aristotelian ideas firmly as the general\nbasis for a unified system of the arts. The main concept on which he\nfocuses is mimesis, but generalized to any kind of art (thus\ngoing beyond Aristotle or Horace). To achieve this generalization, he\ndistinguishes the liberal arts, of which the object is pleasure (i.e.,\nmusic, poetry, painting, sculpture, and dance), from the mechanical\nones, and he proposes an interpretation of what amounts to the\n\u201cimitation of the beautiful nature\u201d (Batteux 1746). He\ninsists that imitation is not a matter of slavishly copying the given,\nbut a sensible and enlightened process that struggles its way forward\nto the best result. Recalling the famous anecdote of Zeuxis who\ncomposed his Helen out of parts taken from Crotone\u2019s\nmost perfect women, he concludes that the artist has the\nresponsibility to imitate what reason decides is nature\u2019s\nessence. That is why Batteux praises artifice so much: \u201cart is\nmade for fooling\u201d (Batteux 1746), not because it is inherently\nduplicitous but because truth is a complex construction that hides its\nstructure and development. Of course, the problem of taste remains\nunresolved when we ask how the artist selects the parts that he will\nassemble in his imitation of \u201cbeautiful nature\u201d: by what\nstandard does he determine that a certain part of nature is\nbeautiful?\n\nIt is also important to mention composer Jean-Philippe Rameau, who\npassionately adhered to Cartesian thought. In his Treatise on\nHarmony (1722), he attempted to lay the scientific foundations of\nmusic, and codifies many of the ideas that are the basis of our\nanalysis of music to this day (e.g., tonality, major vs. minor keys,\nprinciples of composition and accompaniment). For Rameau, harmony is\nmore fundamental to music than melody. Nonetheless, from the\nDemonstration of the principle of harmony (1750) on, and\nafter the so-called Querelle des bouffons or \u201cQuarrel\nof Buffoons\u201d, where Rousseau took him to task (in his Letter\nabout French Music 1753, a libel in favor of the Italian opera),\nRameau retreated to the certainty that music is the universal\n\u201ckey\u201d to any subject whatsoever, including geometry.\n",
