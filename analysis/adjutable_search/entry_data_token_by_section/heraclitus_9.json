    "main_text": "Influence\n7. Influence\n\nAlthough Heraclitus is not known to have had students, his writings\nseem to have been influential from an early time. He may have provoked\nParmenides to develop a contrasting philosophy (Patin 1899; Graham\n2002), although their views have much more in common than is generally\nrecognized (Nehamas 2002). Empedocles seems to have invoked\nHeraclitean themes, and some Hippocratic treatises imitated\nHeraclitean language and presented applications of Heraclitean themes.\nDemocritus echoed many of Heraclitus\u2019 ethical pronouncements in\nhis own ethics. From an early time Heraclitus was seen as the\nrepresentative of universal flux in contrast to Parmenides, the\nrepresentative of universal stasis. Cratylus brought Heraclitus\u2019\nphilosophy to Athens, where Plato heard it. Plato seems to have used\nHeraclitus\u2019 theory (as interpreted by Cratylus) as a model for\nthe sensible world, as he used Parmenides\u2019 theory for the\nintelligible world. As mentioned, both Plato and Aristotle viewed\nHeraclitus as violating the law of non-contradiction, and propounding\nan incoherent theory of knowledge based on a radical flux. Yet\nAristotle also treated him as a coherent material monist who posited\nfire as an ultimate principle. The Stoics used Heraclitus\u2019\nphysics as the inspiration for their own, understanding him to\nadvocate a periodic destruction of the world by fire, followed by a\nregeneration of the world; Cleanthes in particular commented on\nHeraclitus. Aenesidemus interpreted Heraclitus as a kind of\nproto-skeptic (see Polito 2004). \n\nEver since Plato, Heraclitus has been seen as a philosopher of flux.\nThe challenge in interpreting the philosopher of Ephesus has always\nbeen to find a coherent theory in his paradoxical utterances. Since\nHegel, he has been seen as a paradigmatic process\nphilosopher\u2013perhaps with some justification. \n",
