    "main_text": "Cultural Appropriation || What is Cultural Appropriation?\n4.1 What is Cultural Appropriation?\n\nCultural appropriation is generally understood as the taking or use of\nthe cultural products of \u201ccultural insiders\u201d by\n\u201ccultural outsiders\u201d (Young 2005: 136). Cultural products\ncan range widely, including stories, styles, motifs, artifacts,\nartworks, traditional knowledge, as well as representations of the\nmembers of a particular culture (Young 2008: 4; 2005: 136; Scafidi\n2005). Questions about cultural appropriation thus often arise in a\nbroad array of artistic contexts (in particular, but not limited to,\nmusic and fashion) as well as other non-artistic contexts, such as\ncostumes, hairstyles, cuisine, and traditional knowledge (Young &\nBrunk 2012).\n\nThe concept of cultural appropriation can be used in either a\ndescriptive or normative sense, and so it is important to be attentive\nto how it is being employed in a particular context. By comparison,\nconsider how \u201cexploitation\u201d can have a descriptive or\nnormative sense (Valdman 2009: 2): you can exploit an opportunity to\nget a snack when the food truck unexpectedly arrives without this\nimplying wrongfulness. Likewise, some writers invoke cultural\nappropriation in a descriptive sense that leaves open whether a\nparticular act of appropriation is wrongful (Young 2008: 18), whereas\nothers employ the normative sense in order to pick out a particular\nkind of wrongful action (Todd 1990: 24).\n\nDisputes over cultural appropriation often have an important racial\ndimension, as in discussions surrounding the blues or hip hop (Rudinow\n1994; Taylor 1995; Taylor 2005). However, this need not be the case.\nFor instance, cultural appropriation (whether wrongful or not) could\nbe thought to arise with respect to cultural groups that cut across\nmultiple racialized groups, such as cultures surrounding disability,\nsexual orientation, gender identity, and religion, as well as arising\nwithin the diverse cultural groups that are circumscribed by a single\nracialized category (Matthes 2016a: 356). In whatever context it\narises, it is generally recognized that an essential ingredient in\nwrongful appropriation is a background of social inequality between\ncultural insiders and cultural outsiders (Ziff & Rao 1997: 5;\nHurka 1999: 184; Hladki 1994). Indeed, given the way in which dominant\ncultural groups tend to assimilate minority cultures, it may even be a\ncategory mistake to speak of members of marginalized cultural groups\n\u201cappropriating\u201d from dominant ones (Rogers 2006:\n480\u20131). That being said, some commentators argue in favor of\nleaving conceptual space for the appropriation of objects or practices\nby marginalized groups, though construed in a beneficial as opposed to\nharmful light (Walsh & Lopes 2012).\n\nA substantial catalyst for academic and popular discussion of cultural\nappropriation (particularly in Canada) was the recommendation in 1992\nof an ad hoc committee of the Canada Council to take cultural\nappropriation into account in its decisions about the award of arts\ngrants (Rowell 1995: 138). Concerns about government funding for work\nabout culturally marginalized peoples made by non-group members are\ntheoretically consistent with finding cultural appropriation\nunobjectionable if it succeeds in the marketplace of its own merits\n(Rowell 1995: 141). However, in more recent years, public and\nscholarly discussion has shifted beyond this narrower question about\ngovernment funding towards more general discussion of whether cultural\nappropriation is wrongful.\n",
