    "main_text": "Philosophy of Education || Education and Human Thriving\n5.2 Education and Human Thriving\n\nGiven two classes of citizens, the laborers and the learned, Jefferson\nrecognized two levels of education ([R]: 459\u201360). The\nlaborers\u2014divided roughly into husbandmen, manufacturers, and\ncraftsmen\u2014needed to conduct business to sustain and improve\ntheir domestic affairs. Thus, they needed access to primary education.\nThe learned needed access to college-level (Jefferson\u2019s\nintermediary grammar schools) and university-level education. To Peter\nCarr (7 Sept. 1814), Jefferson writes, \n\n\nIt is the duty of [our country\u2019s] functionaries, to provide that\nevery citizen in it should receive an education proportioned to the\nconditions and pursuits of his life.\n\n\nNeeds are not all personal. People are, for Jefferson, social\ncreatures, republics are progressive, and thus, citizens have\npolitical duties. Education is critical. \u201cIf the condition of\nman is to be progressively ameliorated, as we fondly hope and\nbelieve,\u201d writes Jefferson to the French revolutionary Marc\nAntoine Jullien (6 Oct. 1818), \u201ceducation is to be the chief\ninstrument in effecting it.\u201d To fit and function in a stable,\nthriving democracy, all citizens are expected to know and assume a\nparticipatory role to the best of their capacities.\n\nTo promote both fullest political participation and moral progress,\nJefferson realized that educational reform had to be systemic. In a\nletter to Senator Joseph C. Cabell (9 Sept. 1817), Jefferson outlines\nsix features of that system.\n\nBasic education should be available to all.\nEducation should be tax-supported.\nEducation should be free from religious dictation.\nThe educational system should be controlled at the local\nlevel.\nThe upper levels of education should feature free inquiry.\nThe mentally proficient should be enabled to pursue education to\nthe highest levels at public expense.\n\n\nOnly a system could offer all citizens an education proportioned to\ntheir needs: the laborers, a broad, general education; the learned, an\neducation suited to their idiosyncratic needs (Bowers 1943: 243 and\nWalton 1984: 119). Jefferson gets across that point to academician\nGeorge Ticknor (25 Nov. 1817) in the manner of Bacon by limning the\nimportant truths\u2014\u201cthat knowledge is power, that knowledge\nis safety, and that knowledge is happiness.\u201d That knowledge is\nuseful, data-driven.\n\nOverall, observation showed that human capacities were greatly\nunderdeveloped (TJ to William Green Munford, 17 June 1799).\nConsequently, education needed to tap into untapped human potential in\nmorally responsible ways.\n\n\nAs well might it be urged that the wild and uncultivated tree,\nhitherto yielding sour and bitter fruit only, can never be made to\nyield better; yet we know that the grafting art implants a new tree on\nthe savage stock, producing what is most estimable both in kind and\ndegree. Education, in like manner, engrafts a new man on the native\nstock, and improves what in his nature was vicious and perverse into\nqualities of virtue and social worth ([R]: 461).\n\n\nHuman perfectibility, for Jefferson, was a matter of improved\nefficiency of living, which implied not merely progress in the fields\nof human health and human productivity through discoveries and\nlabor-saving inventions, but also and especially moral improvement.\nMoral improvement was much more important than exercise of rationality\n(e.g., TJ to Maria Cosway, 12 Oct. 1786). Pure rationality was a\nmatter of humans abstracting from reality; moral sensibility was a\nmatter of humans immersed in reality.\n\nStill Jefferson thought courses in morality were unneeded, if not\ninjurious. \u201cI think it lost time to attend lectures in this\nbranch,\u201d Jefferson writes to Carr (10 Aug. 1787), for moral\nconduct is not a matter of reason. That of course was consistent with\nthe empiricism of his day\u2014e.g., Lord Kames and David Hume.\nNonetheless, Jefferson in Notes on the State of Virginia has\na role for education in moral development. The first stage of\neducation is not the time to encourage critical engagement with\nmaterial like the Bible, for human rationality is not sufficiently\ndeveloped, but instead a time when children should store historical\nfacts to be used critically later in life. While doing so, the\n\u201celements of morality\u201d can be instilled. Such elements\nteach children, says Jefferson in Aristotelian fashion, that\n\n\ntheir own greatest happiness \u2026 does not depend on their\ncondition in life in which chance has placed them, but is always the\nresult of a good conscience, good health, occupation [i.e., industry],\nand freedom in all just pursuits ([NV]: 147).\n\n\nMoral \u201clearning\u201d is, thus, less a matter of ingesting and\ndigesting moral principles to apply to circumstances\u2014there were\nno inviolable principles for Jefferson, as morality was a matter of\nsensing the right thing to do in circumstances\u2014but of placing\nfaith in the capacity of one\u2019s moral sense to\n\u201cdecide\u201d the right course of action without the corruptive\ninfluence of reason or peer pressure (TJ to Martha Jefferson, 11 Dec.\n1783, TJ to Peter Carr, 19 Aug. 1785 and 10 Aug. 1787).\n\nBecause of the subordination of rationality to morality, education\nmust be useful. It must engender effective, participatory citizenry\nand political stability. Jefferson always insisted on the practicality\nof education, because his take on knowledge was\n Baconian.[33]\n Consider what Jefferson says to scientist and physician Edward Jenner\n(14 May 1806) on behalf of the \u201cwhole human family\u201d for\nhis discovery of a vaccine for small pox.\n\n\nMedecine has never before produced any single improvement of such\nability. Harvey\u2019s discovery of the circulation of the blood was\na beautiful addition to our knowledge of the animal economy, but on a\nreview of the practice of medicine before & since that epoch, I do\nnot see any great amelioration which has been derived from that\ndiscovery, you have erased from the Calendar of human afflictions one\nof it\u2019s greatest. Yours is the comfortable reflection that\nmankind can never forget that you have lived.\n\n\nYet every scientific discovery is potentially fruitful. \u201cNo\ndiscovery is barren; it always serves as a step to something\nelse\u201d (TJ to Robert Patterson, 17 Apr. 1803).\n\n\u201cUseful\u201d for Jefferson was broad and with normative\n implications.[34]\n A complete education for Jefferson would produce men who were\n\n\nin all ways useful to society\u2014useful because intelligent,\ncultured, well-informed, technically competent, moral (this\nparticularly), capable of earning a living, happy, and fitted for\npolitical and social leadership (Martin: 37). \n\n\nUseful implied socially and politically active. Male citizens of\ngreatest virtue and greatest genius would contribute by participation\nin science and in the most politically prominent positions. Lesser\ncitizens would contribute more modestly and mostly at local levels\nthrough, for illustration, jury duty, participation in militia, and\nvoting for and overseeing elected representatives.\n\nFinally, education for Jefferson was a way of living. Its aim was to\ngive persons the tools they would need to make them socially and\npolitically involved, free, self-sufficient, and happy. As Karl\nLehmann (201\u20132) notes:\n\n\nTo Thomas Jefferson, school would never be a \u2018finishing\u2019\nagency. From each stage, man would have to move on in a never ending\nprocess of self-education\u2026. The narrow professional who had but\na technical knowledge of his little vocational area was a curse to\nhim. Education had to be broad in order to assure the freedom and\nhappiness of man.\n\n",
