    "main_text": "The Divine Creative Act || Creation ex nihilo and the Fountain of Life\n4.1 Creation ex nihilo and the Fountain of Life\n\n\nTo begin with, Ibn Gabirol's God is described as a Creator God\nwho is an absolute simple unity\u2014so simple as to exceed the\ngrasp of the human mind and tongue. This apophatic theme (a theme which\nin any philosopher highlights the absolute unity of God) can be seen\nfor example, in the very first canto of his Keter\nMalkh\u00fbt [Kingdom's Crown] depiction of God:\n\u201cYours is the name hidden from the wise\u2026\u201d God, for\nIbn Gabirol, is, in proper Neoplatonic fashion, an absolute unity. That\nsaid, God is nonetheless described in the Fons Vitae by Ibn\nGabirol in dual\u2014and in some sense, tripart\u2014terms:\nGod's unity consists on the one hand in a purely hidden Essence\nand on the other hand in the manifesting activity of a Divine Will. We\nalso learn (thirdly) of God's Wisdom (and in related fashion, of\nthe Divine Word). Emphasizing more of a dual\u2014and less of a\ntripart\u2014vision of this absolutely simple Creator, Ibn Gabirol\nsometimes directly identifies the Divine Will with the divine Wisdom\n(though that does not always seem clear throughout Ibn Gabirol's\nwritings).\n\n\nWhile God's creative act is described by Ibn Gabirol as a\ncreation ex nihilo (see Fons Vitae 3.3, p. 79, line\n18; FV 3.25, p. 139, lines 24\u201325) a view normally seen in opposition to\ndoctrines of emanation, he also uses common emanation metaphors\u2014the \nflow of light and the flow of water\u2014to describe the origins\nof the cosmos. For example, drawing on the Psalms 36:10 image\nof a \u201cfountain of life,\u201d in the very title of his Fons\nVitae\n text[18]\nIbn Gabirol seems to at least beckon to Greek and Muslim Neoplatonic\nvisions of an emanating\n God.[19]\nSimilarly stressing an emanating cosmos (though\nnot necessarily the idea of an emanating God per se), Ibn Gabirol\u2014in \nwhat appears to be part of a commentary on Genesis\u2014likens \nthe material core of being (to which we will return in\nsection 5) to a river. Allegorically rendering the Garden of Eden\nwaters to the pure matter which sits at the root of the unfolding\ncosmos, Ibn Gabirol envisions the pulse of existence as a River of Life\u2014a \nvibrant outpouring which links all of existence to a single\noverflowing source (see Sirat 1985, p. 79). Of course, this particular\nimage does not necessarily suggest that God Himself emanates (i.e. the\nidea that existence emanates forth from matter is still consistent with\nGod creating that matter ex nihilo, and not via\nemanation).\n\n\nAttempting to put all the pieces of Ibn Gabirol's complex\ncosmogony together, we can find pieces of creation ex nihilo,\nemanation, and creation ex aliquo; God's formative act\nbegins with creating matter and form (possibly a creation ex\nnihilo, but described fluidly enough as to leave open other\ninterpretations), and He then draws out, in an emanating flow, the\nremainder of existence from these dual starting points (emanation, but\nalso creation ex aliquo in the sense that all of existence is\nbeing formed through the mediation of matter, as opposed to each\nexistent being created directly\u2014in the sense of\n\u2018unmediated\u2019\u2014by God as in other versions of\ncreation ex nihilo\n accounts).[20]\nIn the end, Ibn Gabirol's conceptual play\u2014with \nnotions of creation and emanation side by side\u2014ought \nleave us open to various interpretations of how precisely to\nunderstand his cosmogony.\n\n\nIn his Keter Malkh\u00fbt poem (Kingdom's\nCrown), Ibn Gabirol further describes God's creative act as\na splitting open of nothingness: \u201c\u2026ve-qara el\nha-\u2019ay\u00een ve-nivqa\u2026,\u201d (\u201c\u2026and\nHe called out to the nothing and it split open\u2026\u201d; in\nGabirol's poem, Keter Malkh\u00fbt, canto 9; See\nSchirmann 1967, p. 262, line 82; for a treatment of this line, see\nPines 1980). Here, the void of precreation\u2014the pre-existent\n\u2019ay\u00een, or \u201cnothingness\u201d\u2014is\nsplit open by God's own voice in the moment of creation\u2014a\nmoment arguably described by Ibn Gabirol in his poem\nahavt\u00eekha (\u201cI Love You\u201d) as the material\n\u201cproto-existence\u201d (kem\u00f4-y\u00eash) awaiting\nits fulfillment through\n form,[21]\nand described in the Fons Vitae as a\ncomplex unfolding of and downward manifesting of a first pure matter\nthrough the introduction of (or unfolding of) forms by the Divine Will.\nThe material nothing\u2014in all three images\u2014is the ground\nof existence, as it is at once the site of desire, a yearning to be\nen-formed, which is to say, to become more and more manifest. We will\nsay more about this emphasis on desire below (see section 4.3).\n\n\nCentral to Ibn Gabirol's cosmogony is also the notion of the\nDivine Will, an emphasis for which the Fons Vitae is\nhighlighted in the history of ideas.\n",
