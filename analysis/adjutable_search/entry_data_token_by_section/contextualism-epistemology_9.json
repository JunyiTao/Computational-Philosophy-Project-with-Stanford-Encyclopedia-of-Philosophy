    "main_text": "Critical Reactions, Contextualist Responses || EC and Skepticism\n4.2 EC and Skepticism\nWhile a reminder that EC is a semantic or metalinguistic thesis helps both to defuse certain objections and to expose as misleading Lewisian presentations of the view, it also sets the stage for a more difficult objection for contextualists to counter: namely, that it does not successfully respond to skepticism.\nOn one version of this complaint (e.g., Feldman 2001, Conee 2014), it is said that EC per se does not generate the results essential to the contextualist resolution of SA, for example. That the propositions expressed by utterances of \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences in ordinary contexts are true, for example, is not secured by EC on its own; only a substantive theory of what is required for the truth of a \u2018knowledge\u2019 claim (in context) can deliver that result. On another version, the objection is simply that EC does not correctly characterize the skeptic\u2019s position at all. As we have seen, EC has it that skeptical claims express truths only relative to extraordinarily high epistemic standards. But surely, the objection runs, what is at issue between skeptics and non-skeptics is the quality of the evidence we in fact have, and whether we satisfy even our ordinary epistemic standards (see Kornblith 2000, 27; Feldman 2004, 32; cf. Feldman 1999, 2001).\nWhile he is prepared to grant the contextualist his/her semantic thesis, Ernest Sosa (2000) likewise takes it to have limited relevance to epistemology generally. For, just because it is restricted to certain metalinguistic claims, EC has only limited significance for skepticism: from the fact that, in non-skeptical contexts, we can use \u2018S knows that p\u2019 to express propositions which are true, nothing follows about whether we know anything\u2014a question which we can and do wonder about in philosophical contexts. The proponent of EC might deny that whether an utterance of \u2018S knows that p\u2019 expresses a truth admits of any acontextual answer. But Sosa\u2019s objection does not imply that those utterances have a truth value outside of any context. The objection specifies one or more contexts\u2014namely, the context(s) of philosophical discourse about \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nSeveral proponents of EC have offered replies to the charge that EC does not fairly characterize and/or engage with skepticism. While allowing that the complaint may apply to other forms of EC, Neta claims that, on his version, the skeptic \u201cis not making the uninteresting claim that we do not meet unusually stringent standards of knowledge. Rather, she is claiming that we do not meet ordinary standards for knowledge\u201d (2003b, 2). In reply, however, the objector may press that, as Neta says, and as we saw above, the skeptic is able to do this on his view only because she \u201cdisqualif[ies] certain mental states from counting as evidence\u201d (ibid.). And one might think that that constitutes the imposition of unusually high epistemic standards.\nResponding to Sosa (2000), Cohen (1999, 79\u201380) writes that, by his lights, what is troubling about skepticism is the idea that, in saying things of the form, \u201cS knows that p\u201d, we have all along been expressing falsehoods (cf. DeRose 2004b, 37). The point of EC is not to show that we know, or even that our ordinary \u201cknowledge\u201d claims express true propositions; it is, rather, to reconcile the presumed truth of such claims with the apparent truth of the premises of SA (Cohen 2001, 95\u201396; DeRose 1995 characterizes the problem posed by SA in very similar terms). And EC shows us how we might do so. But, Sosa counters, insofar as non-skeptics wish to preserve and defend a \u201cMoorean stance\u201d, the latter is not a metalinguistic claim to the effect that folks in ordinary situations who claim to \u201cknow\u201d express truths. Rather, the latter \u201cis a stance, adopted in a philosophical context, about what one then knows and, by extension, what people ordinarily know. At a minimum it is a stance about whether people are right in their ordinary claims to know, which is not quite the same as whether they are right in their ordinary utterances of the form \u2018I know that p\u2019.\u201d So \u201c[o]nce we abandon the object language and ascend to the metalanguage,\u201d as a proper understanding of EC requires, \u201cwe abandon thereby the Moorean stance\u201d (Sosa 2004, 281).\nThis last claim of Sosa\u2019s brings us back to an earlier point. There seems to be a good sense in which, when epistemologists carefully consider the extent of our knowledge, the cogency (or not) of various skeptical arguments, and so on, they occupy a single, shared context (Conee 2014, 66). Within that context, some deny that we know very much, while their anti-skeptical counterparts insist that we do. But to hold, as EC\u2019s proffered handling of SA implies, that in this context it is the skeptic\u2019s claims that are true is not licensed by EC itself: the propositions expressed by knowledge sentences may be contextually variable, but that does not tell us, concerning some particular context such as a philosophical dispute, which specific such propositions are true, and which false. (It is possible to read Dretske\u2019s objection to EC, mentioned in the previous Section, as intended to make essentially this point.)\nIn response, the contextualist may deny that there is, in fact, a single, shared context constituted by serious epistemological discussion. (DeRose\u2019s 2004a, and Chapter 4 of his 2009, are an extended discussion of just this topic; see too Cohen 2014, 72\u201373.) So too, she may grant\u2014which, as noted above (Section 3.3), some proponents of EC readily do\u2014that contextualists are not forced to any view as to whether and/or under what circumstances the skeptic\u2019s claims do express truths, while still insisting that EC provides the basis for an appealing resolution of puzzles like SA (Cohen 2014, 71\u201373). Of course, such moves may in turn give rise to further worries. For example, if there is no single, shared context constituted by serious epistemological discussion, perhaps that is true of all domains of specialized discourse. If so, one might worry that that threatens to dissolve all apparently substantive disagreements among specialists.[14]\nClearly, the effectiveness of EC in addressing and resolving skeptical problems is far from settled. It would appear, however, that one\u2019s verdict on this matter will depend in no small part upon just what one takes the problem posed by skepticism to be, and also perhaps upon facts about particular contextualist views which go beyond an endorsement of EC per se.\n",
