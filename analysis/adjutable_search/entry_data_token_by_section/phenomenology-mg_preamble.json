    "main_text": "\n\nIn the first decades of the twentieth century, the members of the\nso-called \u201cMunich and G\u00f6ttingen circles\u201d of\nphenomenology made important contributions to philosophy of mind,\nphilosophy of language, philosophy of action, epistemology, social\nphilosophy, axiology, and ontology. Some of the most prominent members\nof these circles are Alfred Brunswig, Theodor Conrad, Hedwig\nConrad-Martius, Johannes Daubert, August Gallinger, Moritz Geiger,\nRoman Ingarden, Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Adolf Reinach, Wilhelm Schapp,\nMax Scheler, Kurt Stavenhagen, Edith Stein, and Gerda Walther. The\nideas of these authors were influenced by such thinkers as Henri\nBergson, Bernard Bolzano, Franz Brentano, Theodor Lipps, Hermann\nLotze, Anton Marty, Alexius Meinong, and\u2014perhaps to a more\nsignificant degree\u2014by the work of Edmund Husserl.\n\nSome of the most original insights provided by what has also been\ncharacterized as \u201cearly phenomenology\u201d concern the notion\nof intentionality, which is the property of some mental states whereby\nthey are directed towards objects and states of affairs. Several\nmembers of the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen circles claimed that there\nare radically different kinds of intentionality (and, by extension, of\nintentional acts), which cannot be reduced to a unitary genus.\nMoreover, these authors fostered our understanding of various forms of\nintersubjective intentionality by developing insightful theories about\nsocial or speech acts, empathy, and collective intentionality.\n\nEarly phenomenologists understood the investigation of mental\nexperiences as part of a general theory of objects or ontology, and\ntheir contributions share some common traits on this matter. In\nparticular, it was assumed that objects and facts exist independently\nof anyone\u2019s beliefs, mental states or conceptual schemes, and\nthat they instantiate essential properties. The two main categories of\nphenomenological ontology, to which several members of both circles\ndevoted extensive research, are that of objects and states of\naffairs.\n",
