    "main_text": "Issues || Human Rights\n3.3 Human Rights\n\nThe term \u2018human rights\u2019 refers simultaneously to several\nthings: a moral language; a set of norms and laws, both national and\ninternational; and a framework for analyzing and responding to the\nvarious serious harms experienced by men and women around the world.\nFeminist political philosophers argue that globalization has had\ncontradictory effects on the extent to which women experience human\nrights violations.\n\nMany feminist political philosophers have argued that globalization\nhas contributed to human rights violations against women. Most\nobviously, neoliberal policies have led to infringements of specific\nsocial and economic rights, such as the right \u201cto a standard of\nliving adequate for the health and well-being\u201d and the right\n\u201cto security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability,\nwidowhood, and old age\u201d (Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\narticle 25). Moreover, by diminishing women\u2019s economic security,\nneoliberal policies have exacerbated existing forms of gender\ndiscrimination and violence and made women and girls more vulnerable\nto a wide variety of additional human rights violations. Three\nexamples are prominent in the literature. First, the economic\ninsecurity and concomitant increase in poverty associated with\nglobalization have made girls more vulnerable to sexual exploitation.\nIn particular, girls are more likely to be sold as child brides or\npushed into prostitution or sexual slavery in order to support their\nfamilies (Okin 1998, 45). Second, when resources are scarce, women and\ngirls are less likely to receive food than boys and men and are less\nlikely to attend school. Finally, Shiva argues that neoliberal\nglobalization has made women more vulnerable to sexual violence. She\nnotes the extraordinary increase in rape in India: 800 percent since\nthe 1970s and an additional 250 percent since the economy was\nliberalized (Morgan 2013). Although the reasons for this rise are\ncomplex, Shiva believes they are connected to several aspects of\nglobalization: structural adjustment policies, which eliminated major\nsectors of women\u2019s economic activity; the destruction of the\nnatural environment, which displaced many women; and the exclusion of\nwomen from economic and political decision-making.\n\nMore positively, some feminist philosophers contend that globalization\nhas enabled women to claim their human rights by creating \u201cnew\nspaces, institutions and rhetoric where the notion of universal human\nrights is a powerful justificatory principle\u201d (Walby 2002, 534).\nOthers credit globalization for the emergence of new international\nnon-governmental organizations and feminist social movements, which\nhave strengthened the worldwide movement for women\u2019s human\nrights (Robinson 2003, 161). The \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human\nrights\u201d movement has used the language of human rights, which\nsome proponents believe provides \u201cthe best chance of realizing\nthe long sought after goal of gender equality,\u201d to criticize\nmany assaults on women\u2019s dignity that were previously considered\nto be natural or inevitable (Panzer 2009, 45). For instance, the\nmovement has shown that abuses in the private sphere, such as domestic\nviolence, so-called \u201chonor killings,\u201d and violence done in\nthe name of culture or tradition, are legitimate human rights\nviolations. Others have argued that cultural practices like female\ngenital cutting (FGC), which many consider to be human rights\nviolations, can be made compatible with universal human rights if\ncertain conditions are met (Gordon 2018). The movement also helped to\ncodify women\u2019s human rights in formal United Nations documents,\nsuch as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Declaration on the\nElimination of Violence Against Women, which activist groups have\nsubsequently used to challenge domestic laws and norms (Stamatopoulou\n1995). However, as McLaren points out, it is important to attend to\nthe critiques made by feminists in the global South that social and\neconomic rights, rights that are particularly important to women in\nthe global South, have been marginalized in Western feminist\ndiscourse. This critique can be accounted for, McLaren argues, if we\nadopt an integrated approach to rights that both insists on the\nindivisibility of human rights and acknowledges their ambivalence. If\nhuman rights are to realize their liberatory potential, we must\nrecognize that human rights can reinforce injustice as well as\nundermine it (McLaren 2017b). \n\nWomen\u2019s human rights movements have also had an impact on\ninternational understandings of the gendered consequences of war and\nmilitarization. In UN forums and other global venues, feminists have\nchallenged international human rights laws concerning rape and sexual\nviolence in war. As Copelon explained in 2003, \u201c[l]ess than a\ndecade ago, it was openly questioned whether rape was a war crime.\nHuman rights and humanitarian organizations largely ignored sexual\nviolence and the needs of its victims\u201d (Copelon, 1). However, by\n2002, feminists had successfully convinced the authors of the Rome\nStatute to include a broad range of sexually violent crimes among the\ngravest crimes of war. The document considers rape, forced pregnancy,\nsexual assault, and forced prostitution to be \u201ccrimes against\nhumanity\u201d if they are committed as part of a widespread or\nsystematic attack on civilian populations, in times of war as well as\npeace, by non-state actors as well as official state actors. The\nStatute\u2019s definition of rape goes a long way toward recognizing\nrape as a gender-based atrocity on par with other long-recognized\natrocities, such as torture and genocide (Parekh 2009). Arguably,\nthese changes in international law would not have been possible\nwithout transnational activism, which can clearly be seen as an\nexample of \u201cglobalization from below.\u201d\n",
