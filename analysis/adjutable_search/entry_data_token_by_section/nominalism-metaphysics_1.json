    "main_text": "Abstract objects and universals || Abstract Objects\n2.1 Abstract Objects\n\n\nWhat is an abstract object? There is no standard definition of the\nphrase. Perhaps the most common conception of abstract objects is that\nof non-spatiotemporal and causally inert objects. Often the requirement\nthat abstract objects are causally inert is not an independent\ncondition but is derived from the requirement that abstract objects are\nnot spatiotemporal since it is assumed that only spatiotemporal\nentities can enter in causal relations.\n\n\nBut this conception of abstract objects has been criticised. Games\nand languages are supposedly abstract and yet they are temporal\nentities, since they come into being at a certain point in time, and\nsome of them develop and change in time (Hale 1987, 49). Defining\nabstract objects simply as causally inert objects also presents\nproblems (see, for example, the entry on \n abstract objects).\n\n\nThere have been other proposals as to how to characterise abstract\nobjects. One approach defines abstract objects as those the\nunderstanding of whose names involves a recognition that the named\nobject is in the range of a certain functional expression (Dummett\n1973, 485). It has also been thought that an abstract object is one\nthat either couldn't possibly exist or couldn't possibly be concrete,\ndepending on whether you interpret the predicate \u2018E!\u2019\n(used to formally represent the definition of \u2018abstract\u2019)\nas an existence predicate or a concreteness predicate (Zalta 1983, 60,\n50-52). On another conception of\nabstract objects these are objects that cannot exist separately from\nother entities (Lowe 1995, \n 514).[3] \n (For a discussion of the various ways\nof characterising the abstract/concrete distinction see Burgess and Rosen\n1997, 13\u201325.)\n\n\nThere are thus several alternative conceptions of abstract objects.\nBut in what follows I shall take abstract objects to be those that are\nnon-spatiotemporal and causally inert. This is because what motivates\nNominalism (in one of its senses) is basically the rejection of\nnon-spatiotemporal and causally inert objects. That is, the nominalist\nsees trouble with abstract objects simply because he sees trouble with\nnon-spatiotemporal, causally inert objects. That this is so can be seen\nfrom the fact that nominalist theories are often motivated by\nempiricist or naturalist views, which find no place for\nnon-spatiotemporal, causally inert \n objects.[4] \n Thus, for example, one of\nthe main problems with mathematical objects \u2014 a subclass of\nabstract objects \u2014 from a nominalist point of view is that it is\nnot easy to see how we can come to have knowledge or form reliable\nbeliefs about them and refer to them, since there are no causal\nrelations between them and us. But this presupposes that what makes\nabstract objects problematic is their causal inertness. And the source\nof their causal inertness might be their lack of spatiotemporality.\n\n\nThe characterisation of abstract objects as non-spatiotemporal and\ncausally inert objects might be thought unsatisfactory to the extent\nthat it tells us only what they are not, but not what they are. But\nthis is not a problem for the nominalist. The business of the\nnominalist is to reject such objects, not to characterise them in a\npositive way. And for the purposes of rejecting abstract objects, their\ncharacterisation as non-spatiotemporal, causally inert objects is a\nreasonably clear characterisation (at least as clear as the notions of\nspatiotemporal object, causation, causal power, and related ones\nare).\n\n\nHistorically the distinction between abstract and concrete objects\nhas been thought of as exclusive and exhaustive. But the exhaustiveness\nof the distinction has recently been questioned. Linsky and Zalta argue\nthat while abstract objects are necessarily abstract, there are objects\nwhich are not concrete but could have been concrete. These objects are\nnon-concrete in virtue of being non-spatiotemporal and causally inert\nbut they are not abstract since they could have been concrete (Linsky\nand Zalta 1994). Since Nominalism rejects abstract objects because of\ntheir non-spatiotemporality and their causal inertness, Nominalism also\nrejects non-concrete objects.\n",
