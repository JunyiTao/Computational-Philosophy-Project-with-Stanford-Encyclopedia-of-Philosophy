    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Self-Reference || Set-Theoretic Paradoxes\n1.2 Set-Theoretic Paradoxes\n\nThe best-known set-theoretic paradoxes are Russell\u2019s paradox and\nCantor\u2019s paradox. Russell\u2019s paradox arises from\nconsidering the Russell set \\(R\\) of all sets that are\nnot members of themselves, that is, the set defined defined by\n\\(R = \\{ x \\mid  x \\not\\in x \\}\\). The\ncontradiction is then derived by asking whether \\(R\\) is a member\nof itself, that is, whether \\(R \\in R\\) holds. If\n\\(R \\in R\\) then \\(R\\) is a member of itself,\nand thus \\(R \\not\\in R\\), by definition of \\(R\\).\nIf, on the other hand, \\(R \\not\\in R\\) then \\(R\\)\nis not a member of itself, and thus \\(R \\in R\\),\nagain by definition of \\(R\\).\n\nCantor\u2019s paradox is based on an application of\nCantor\u2019s theorem. Cantor\u2019s theorem states that\ngiven any finite or infinite set \\(S\\), the power set of\n\\(S\\) has strictly larger cardinality (greater size) than\n\\(S\\). The theorem is proved by a form of diagonalisation, the\nsame idea underlying Richard\u2019s paradox. Cantor\u2019s paradox\nconsiders the set of all sets. Let us call this set the universal\nset and denote it by \\(U\\). The power set of \\(U\\) is\ndenoted \\(\\wp(U)\\). Since \\(U\\) contains all\nsets it will in particular contain all elements of\n\\(\\wp(U)\\). Thus \\(\\wp(U)\\) must be a subset of\n\\(U\\) and must thus have a cardinality (size) which is less than\nor equal to the cardinality of \\(U\\). However, this immediately\ncontradicts Cantor\u2019s theorem. \n\nThe Hypergame paradox is a more recent addition to the list\nof set-theoretic paradoxes, invented by Zwicker (1987). Let us call a\ntwo-player game well-founded if it is bound to terminate in a\nfinite number of moves. Tournament chess is an example of a\nwell-founded game. We now define hypergame to be the game in\nwhich player 1 in the first move chooses a well-founded game to be\nplayed, and player 2 subsequently makes the first move in the chosen\ngame. All remaining moves are then moves of the chosen game. Hypergame\nmust be a well-founded game, since any play will last exactly one move\nmore than some given well-founded game. However, if hypergame is\nwell-founded then it must be one of the games that can be chosen in\nthe first move of hypergame, that is, player 1 can choose hypergame in\nthe first move. This allows player 2 to choose hypergame in the\nsubsequent move, and the two players can continue choosing hypergame\nad infinitum. Thus hypergame cannot be well-founded,\ncontradicting our previous conclusion.\n",
