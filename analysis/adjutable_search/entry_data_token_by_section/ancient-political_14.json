    "main_text": "Aristotle || Aristotle in Political Philosophy\n4.4 Aristotle in Political Philosophy\n\n\u201cAll modern discussions of citizenship as a noninstrumental\ngood-in-itself are indebted, if only indirectly, to him [sc.\nAristotle]\u201d (Ober 1998: 290). The Politics emphasizes\nthat \u201ca state is not a mere society, having a common place,\nestablished for the prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of\nexchange\u201d but is rather \u201ca community of families and\naggregations of families [sc. united] in well-being, for the sake of a\nperfect and self-sufficing life\u201d (III.9, 1280b30\u201334, with\nsquare brackets added). It has been suggested in this article that the\nfinal clause of that sentence is important: Aristotelian citizenship\ncounts as a noninstrumental good-in-itself only so long as it does\nindeed aim at the telos of a perfect life. That is, while\nAristotle indeed valued the possibility of political participation in\nofficeholding and the control of officeholding as part of the best\nconstitution, he saw its value as most fully realized only insofar as\nit was an expression of virtue, as it would be in that best\nconstitution (whether governed by a collectivity of virtuous citizens\nas in the regime described in Books VII and VIII, or in the rare and\nperhaps purely hypothetical case of a superlatively virtuous\nmonarch).\n\nNevertheless, Ober\u2019s observation rings true more broadly for the\nhistorical significance of Aristotle\u2019s political thought. The\nmedieval rediscovery in the West of the full Greek texts of\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics and Politics and their\ntranslation into Latin in the thirteenth century served as a basis for\nreconceiving civic life as valuable on the basis of reason independent\nof revelation. Thus 1260 \u2013 the date of William of\nMoerbeke\u2019s complete Latin translation of the\nPolitics\u2014symbolizes a fundamental turning point in\npolitical philosophy, one in which Aristotelian philosophy would be\nwidely deployed within certain strands of thought of the Catholic\nChurch, while also inspiring a wide range of philosophical movements\nand later becoming the target of others. Indeed, modern debates over\nthe meaning of Aristotle find him a precursor of or inspiration for a\nrange of intellectual and political positions: Aristotle as a\ncommunitarian (MacIntyre 1984) vs. Aristotle as an exponent of class\nconflict (Yack 1993); Aristotle as a democrat, or at least as\nproviding the basis for democracy (Frank 2005), vs. Aristotle in\nopposition to Athenian democracy in his day (Ober 1998). One\ninteresting development has been the use of Aristotle to articulate an\nethics of capability (Nussbaum 1993). In evaluating Aristotle\u2019s\npolitical thought, it is important to distinguish between modern\ndemocratic assumptions and his own starting points, many of which were\nin tension with the democracies of his own time.\n",
