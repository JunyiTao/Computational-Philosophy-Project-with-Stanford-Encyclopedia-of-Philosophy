    "main_text": "\n\n\nQuestions central to the philosophical discussion of lying to others\nand other-deception (interpersonal deceiving) may be divided into two\nkinds. Questions of the first kind are definitional or conceptual.\nThey include the questions of how lying is to be defined, how\ndeceiving is to be defined, and whether lying is always a form of\ndeceiving.  Questions of the second kind are normative \u2014 more\nparticularly, moral.  They include the questions of whether lying and\ndeceiving are either defeasibly or non-defeasibly morally wrong,\nwhether lying is morally worse than deceiving, and whether, if lying\nand deception are defeasibly morally wrong, they are merely morally\noptional on certain occasions, or are sometimes morally obligatory. In\nthis entry, we only consider questions of the first kind.\n",
