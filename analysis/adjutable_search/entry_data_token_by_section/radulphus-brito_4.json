    "main_text": "Logic || The Subject Matter of Logic and Its Division: The Methods of Scientific-Knowledge Acquisition and the Syllogism\n4.1 The Subject Matter of Logic and Its Division: The Methods of Scientific-Knowledge Acquisition and the Syllogism\n\nAccording to Brito, logic is a theoretical science dealing with the\nmethods of scientific-knowledge acquisition (modi sciendi,\nhereafter \u2018methods of knowledge\u2019) (QsP; see\nEbbesen & Pinborg 1981\u20131982: 301). However, since the\nsyllogism is the method of knowledge par excellence, and that\nto which all the other methods of knowledge are subordinated, it can\nalso be posited as the general subject matter of logic.\n\nFor a medieval master like Brito, the science of logic is first and\nforemost contained in Aristotle\u2019s organon (see entry on\n Aristotle's logic).\nHence, Brito\u2019s account of logic as a science must explain the\ndivision of the organon into six treatises as a reflection of\na division of the syllogism into its different kinds (the\ndemonstrative syllogism, the dialectical syllogism, etc.) and its\nconstituent parts (simple words, assertions, etc.). Accordingly,\nBrito\u2019s first division of logic proceeds as follows: the\nsyllogism considered only with regard to its moods and figures is the\nsubject matter of the Prior Analytics. The syllogism\nconsidered according to the alethic modality of its premises is the\nsubject matter of the Topics and of the Posterior\nAnalytics, the former dealing with the syllogism from probable\npremises and the latter with the syllogism from necessary premises.\nThe syllogism from apparently probable premises is, in turn, the\nsubject matter of the Sophistical Refutations. Now, since the\nsyllogism can also be analyzed with respect to its constituent parts,\nthe Categories deals with its simple parts\u2014simple\nwords\u2014insofar as they can be sorted into different kinds\n(substance, quality, quantity, etc.). Finally, the De\ninterpretatione deals with the complex parts of the\nsyllogism\u2014assertions that become its premises and\nconclusion\u2014as well as with the simple parts of the assertion,\ni.e., the subject and predicate terms (QsP; see Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981\u20131982: 301 and 303).\n",
