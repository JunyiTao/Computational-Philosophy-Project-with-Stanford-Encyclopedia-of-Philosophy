    "main_text": "Evaluation and Image in Modern Scholarship\n3. Evaluation and Image in Modern Scholarship\n\n\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s work in psychology attracted the interest of the great\npioneer in Islamic studies, Ignace Goldziher (1896), who devoted a\nshort study to Ibn Kammuna\u2019s arguments for the soul\u2019s\nimmortality. However, Ibn Kammuna\u2019s main claim to fame in the\ntwentieth century was certainly his Examination, which was\nwidely hailed as the first dispassionate, scientific, non-polemical\ncomparative study of its sort.  Henri Corbin\u2019s (1945) 2-volume work in\nFrench opened up the world of Suhrawardi and the Ishraqi philosophers\nfor western scholarship, and signaled Ibn Kammuna\u2019s key role in the\ndiffusion of Suhrawardi\u2019s thought. Nonetheless, we still have no clear\npicture of a distinctive Ibn Kammunian interpretation of Suhrawardi,\nif such a thing exists. His philosophy belongs to the elaboration,\nrefinement, and defense of the Avicennian tradition, led in his day by\nNasir al-Din al-Tusi, with whom he corresponded. On the other hand, he\nevidently accepted some of the criticisms leveled at Avicenna by\nAbu-l-Barakat al-Baghdadi and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Finally, the\npresent article hopes to add to his intellectual portrait the deep\npiety evident in his ethical treatises, which draw upon Jewish,\nIslamic, and non-denominational philosophic sources.\n",
