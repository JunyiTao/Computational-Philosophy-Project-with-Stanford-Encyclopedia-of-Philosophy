The Transcendental \u2018True\u2019\n\n\nIn the same way as the reflection on the concept of unity in\nmedieval doctrines of the transcendentals envisaged to articulate a\nmore fundamental feature of unity underneath the mathematical\nconception of unity, their investigation into the transcendental notion\nof truth uncovered a basic feature of reality, prior to and explicative\nof its logical dimension as a property of propositions.\n\n\nWhat is a basic tension in Aristotle\u2019s affirmations concerning\nthe relation between being and the true, i.e. the tension between the\nassertion that each thing is related to truth in the same way as it is\nto being and the assertion that being-as-true (ens ut\nverum) is a kind of intramental being that falls outside the\nscience of metaphysics, is part of a synthesizing program in\nAnselm\u2019s treatise De veritate, where the propositional\ntruth, ontological truth, and moral truth are all explained, in an\nintegrative effort, under the aegis of the basic concept of\n\u2018rightness\u2019 (rectitudo). Anselm\u2019s definition\nwas important in early attempts in the medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals to relate the true that is convertible with being with\nthe truth of the proposition. Gradually, the definition of truth as the\n\u2018conformity of the thing with the intellect\u2019\n(adaequatio rei et intellectus) rose to hegemony,\nwhich has the advantage of making explicit the constitutive relation\nwith the intellect, but threatens to make transcendental truth depend\nupon actual cognition.\n\n\nIn De ver. 1.1, Aquinas presents his analysis of the\nconcept of truth in a threefold scheme, according to which there is a\nmoment of conformity of intellect and thing, right between the thing as\nthe foundation of truth and knowledge as its result; this conformity,\nin which the meaning of the true is formally accomplished, is\ntranscendental truth. In contrast to this, in the Summa theol.\nAquinas uses a twofold scheme, according to which the intellect is true\nin a primary sense, the thing only in a secondary sense, namely in\nrelation to the intellect; the aptness of the\n\u2018adaequatio\u2019-formula is that it comprises both\nsenses. In the development of Aquinas\u2019 reflection on truth\nbetween De ver. and the Summa theol., therefore, an\nelimination of the intermediary moment occurs, a merging of\ntranscendental truth with the truth of cognition, which has been\ninterpreted as a dissolution of transcendental truth. (See Dewan\n2004.)\n\n\nThe fundamental dimension of transcendental truth as an openness of\nbeing in its intelligibility to cognition, which Aquinas had identified\nin De ver., is also clearly expressed in Duns Scotus\u2019\nreflection on truth in his commentary on the sixth book of the\nMetaphysics. After having declared that all truth related to\nthe divine intellect is studied by metaphysics, he continues to\ndistinguish three senses in which the human mind is related to truth,\nof which only the first is studied by metaphysics: namely when a thing\nis said to be true because it is able to manifest itself to an\nintellect capable of perceiving it, of which Scotus explicitly says\nthat it is convertible with being. The other senses, according to which\na thing is true because it is assimilated to or known by the human\nintellect, fall outside the scope of metaphysics and belong to\nlogic.\n\n\nIn response to the same tension that motivated Aquinas to give more\nemphasis to the intellect in the definition of transcendental truth,\nthe transcendental true was advanced to claim conceptual precedence\nbefore and hence challenge the conceptual priority of the concept of\nbeing. Potencies are specified by the formal aspect under which they\nconceive things and the intellect is distinguished from the will, since\nthe formal object of the former is the true, the formal object of the\nlatter is the good. On account of \u2018the objective turn\u2019, the\nidentification of the first known with the proper object, it is clear,\ntherefore, that the true is in a sense the first known, as the formal\naspect under which everything is understood by the intellect. Henry of\nGhent is the main representative of this much-discussed position. He\ndistinguishes between the true as what is \u2018dispositively\u2019\nfirst known, in the sense of what is conditional for knowledge, and\nbeing as what is \u2018objectively\u2019 first known. This\ndistinction respects the difference between direct and reflective\ncognition, but also shows the vulnerability of the medieval foundation\nof the priority of the concept of being. It might be taken as another\nexample of the basic instability that underlies the doctrines of the\ntranscendentals: the non-identity of the first object of the intellect\nand the subject of metaphysics.\n",
