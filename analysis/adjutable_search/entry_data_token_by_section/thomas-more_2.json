Early Poetry, Conscience, and Philosophic Considerations\n\nLord Chancellor and Archbishop John Morton marveled at the\ntwelve-year-old More\u2019s extraordinary theatrical ability to\n\n\nstep in among the players, and never studying for the matter, make a\npart of his own there presently among them, which made the lookers-on\nmore sport than all the players besides. (Roper\u2019s Life of\nSir Thomas More [EW 1391.10\u201314])\n\n\nReflecting on this passage and on More\u2019s early poetry and life,\nRichard Sylvester\u2014the Yale scholar who launched the Complete\nWorks project\u2014observed that he had, even from that early\nage, an awareness \u201cof himself in relation to others\u201d,\nshowing \u201cconscience in the old sense of the word, \u2018a\nknowing with\u2019\u201d that always enabled him to determine a\n\u201cpart of his own\u201d (1967: 30).\n\nIn his earliest known poem, \u201cPageant Verses\u201d (c. 1496\n[EW 3\u20134, CW 1: 3\u20137]), More shows his\nflair for dramatic representations of life. Each of the nine\nfirst-person monologues expresses, in rhyme royal verse, a different\nand fitting perspective about the ages of life and their specific\ncharacteristics (EW 3\u20134), each with a touch of humor.\nThe poem not only includes in its scope the full scale of life\n(following the ages-of-man trope of Childhood, Youth, Maturity, Old\nAge) and what follows one\u2019s earthly life (Death, Fame,\nTime, and a secular Eternity), but also ends, in Latin, with the\nPoet\u2019s view of all that preceded in the light of a loving God,\nthe one true good\u2014and the Poet\u2019s challenge for the reader\nto reflect and choose.\n\n\u201cPageant Verses\u201d begins with Childhood boasting of his\nstage of life: \u201c[I]n play is all my mind\u201d. Childhood\nhumorously calls upon God twice to enable him to play games all day;\nto have all those \u201chateful books\u201d burned \u201cto powder\nsmall\u201d, and thus send him a \u201clife always in play\u201d.\nThis stanza brings out the power of pleasure\u2019s allure\u2014as\ndo the following few stanzas, and as will Utopia and\nMore\u2019s later works. But the child does naturally turn to God in\nthose lines (17 and 20), and in lines 14 and 20 he reveals an\nawareness of his own mind and of death. The next stanzas dramatize the\npursuit of pleasure in different forms according to the particular age\nof life, but all show the prominence of pride: each speaker ups the\nboast, explaining how their pleasure or power exceeds that of the one\nbefore. Even the old ruler boasts\u2014of his wisdom and discretion\nin achieving the \u201cpublic weal\u201d\u2014in the stanza\nentitled \u201cAge\u201d.\n\n\u201cRueful Lamentation\u201d (EW 5\u20136)\u2014written\nin 1503, when More was twenty-five\u2014is a moving first-person\nmonologue by Queen Elizabeth of York (the mother of Henry VIII) on her\ndeathbed, bearing witness to what the Poet of \u201cPageant\nVerses\u201d said about the \u201cgoods of th[is] fragile\nworld\u201d being \u201cslippery\u201d. Queen Elizabeth makes this\npoint powerfully in the concluding refrain for each of her twelve\nstanzas: \u201cLo, here I lie\u201d. More\u2019s last two English\npoems, written in prison, are also about \u201cflattering\nFortune\u201d and unreliable \u201cLady Luck\u201d (c. 1534\n[EW 16]).\n\nMore\u2019s greatest English poem is \u201cThe Fortune Verses\u201d\n(c. 1504), a dialogue between Lady Fortune and two other speakers with\ndiffering perspectives (EW 12\u201316). As one scholar put\nit:\n\n\nMore\u2019s Fortune Verses present a three-way dialectical\nconsideration of how best to live one\u2019s life in the world\ncontrolled by Fortune. The poem is shown to progress from speaker to\nspeaker in its several parts, in order to present an increasingly\naccurate understanding of the person of Fortune and her relationship\nto human life. (Mock 2011: 69)\n\n\nThe speaker in the opening Prologue is identified as\n\u201cT.M.\u201d and the meter is rhyme royal, the form, as we have\nseen, that More used most frequently in his other early poetry. This\nspeaker addresses the reader directly in his fifty lines, giving a\nsimplistic and entirely negative view of Fortune. This speaker even\nquotes, in French, a poet dismissing Fortune as \u201cperverse\u201d\nand the cause of all evils. The 250 lines that follow, however, are an\nengaging dialogue\u2014not at all simplistic\u2014between Lady\nFortune and an exceptionally wise and persuasive interlocutor, all\nwith More\u2019s customary humor.\n\nIn the Fortune Verses, More dramatizes how human beings contend with\nthe powerful allure of Fortune\u2019s fleeting goods. He gives the\nexamples of \u201cwise Socrates\u201d and other \u201cold\nphilosophers\u201d who achieved \u201cfelicity\u201d and\n\u201cfree liberty\u201d by choosing \u201cglad Poverty\u201d\ninstead of Fortune. This choice led them to a \u201cwisdom\u201d\nresulting in happiness rather than wretchedness (EW\n14\u201315). By choosing poverty, Socrates and like-minded\nphilosophers chose only \u201cwhat nature may sustain, / Banishing\nclear all other surplusage\u201d (EW 14.210\u201311; also\n1201ff). The nature of \u201cfree liberty\u201d, along with its\nrelations to wisdom and virtue is one of More\u2019s major themes\nthroughout his writings.\n\nThese early poems show More\u2019s preoccupation with challenging the\nreader to participate in, to reflect on, and, as the Poet of the\n\u201cPageant Verses\u201d puts it, to \u201cnourish his\nsoul\u201d on \u201ctrue things\u201d through the \u201cfashioned\nfigures\u201d of \u201cwondrous art\u201d (EW 4). This\nyouthful focus on truth and wonder is another early sign of\nMore\u2019s philosophic cast of mind.\n",
