    "main_text": "The structure of concepts || The theory theory\n2.3 The theory theory\n\nAnother and currently more popular suggestion is that cores are best\nunderstood in terms of the theory theory of concepts. This is\nthe view that concepts stand in relation to one another in the same\nway as the terms of a scientific theory and that categorization is a\nprocess that strongly resembles scientific theorizing (see, e.g.,\nCarey 1985, 2009, Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997, Keil 1989). It\u2019s\ngenerally assumed, as well, that the terms of a scientific theory are\ninterdefined so that a theoretical term\u2019s content is determined\nby its unique role in the theory in which it occurs.\n\nThe theory theory is especially well-suited to explaining the sorts of\nreflective categorization judgments that proved to be difficult for\nthe prototype theory. For example, theory theorists maintain that\nchildren override perceptual similarity in assessing the situation\nwhere the dog is made to look like a raccoon, claiming that even\nchildren are in possession of a rudimentary biological theory. This\ntheory tells them that being a dog isn\u2019t just a matter of\nlooking like a dog. More important is having the appropriate hidden\nproperties of dogs\u2014the dog essence (see Atran & Medin 2008\non folkbiology). Another advantage of the theory theory is that it is\nsupposed to help to explain important aspects of conceptual\ndevelopment. Conceptual change in childhood is said to follow the same\npattern as theory change in science.\n\nOne problem that has been raised against the theory theory is that it\nhas difficulty in allowing for different people to possess the same\nconcepts (or even for the same person to have the same concept over\ntime). The reason is that the theory theory is holistic. A\nconcept\u2019s content is determined by its role in a theory, not by\nits being composed of just a handful of constituents. Since beliefs\nthat enter people\u2019s mental theories are likely to be different\nfrom one another (and are likely to change), there may be no\nprincipled basis for comparison (Fodor & Lepore 1992). Another\nproblem with the theory theory concerns the analogy to theory change\nin science. The analogy suggests that children undergo radical\nconceptual reorganization in the course of cognitive development, but\nmany of the central case studies have proved to be controversial on\nempirical grounds, with evidence that the relevant concepts are\nimplicated in core knowledge systems that are enriched in development\nbut not fundamentally altered (see Spelke & Kinzler 2007 on core\nknowledge). However, there are certain specific examples where radical\nconceptual reorganization is plausible, for instance, when children\neventually develop a theory of matter that allows them to\ndifferentiate weight from density, and air from nothing (Carey\n2009).\n",
