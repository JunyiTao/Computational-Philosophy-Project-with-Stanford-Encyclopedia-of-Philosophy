Future Buddhahood lives in\npast delusion, so delusion is \u201cBuddhahood-delusion\u201d. Past\ndelusion lives in future Buddhahood, so Buddhahood is\n\u201cdelusion-Buddhahood\u201d. The same goes also for the famous\nTiantai claim that \u201cinsentient beings have the\nBuddha-nature\u201d\u2014i.e., that rocks and stones and all other\nthings with no awareness have the all-pervasive unconditional nature\nof awareness: awareness is always nonawareness-awareness (all\nawareness exists-with nonawareness, e.g., the objects of awareness,\nwhich are not themselves aware), nonawareness is always\nawareness-nonawareness (i.e., nonawareness is determinately\nnonawareness only as contrasted by awareness to awareness itself, and\nis intrinsically inseparable from whatever awareness might exist in\nthe universe, simply by virtue of the inseparability of all\nexistence).\n\nThe controversial idea of \u201cthe Buddha-nature of insentient\nbeings\u201d is developed by Zhanran in his Jingangpi using\na slightly different approach to the Three Truths, focusing on the\ntrope of space as advanced as a metaphor for Buddha-nature in\nthe Mah\u0101y\u0101na Nirvana Sutra, in its character of\nall-pervasiveness, ineradicability, and indivisibility, and the\nnon-different/non-identical relation of all regions of space to each\nother and of each region of space to whatever possible object can\noccupy it. But here too the central argument is the inseparable\nintersubsumption of the two opposite terms: sentience is always\ninsentience-sentience, insentience is always\nsentience-insentience.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider a magnet. It has a north\nand a south \u201cpole\u201d to it. If we wanted to separate the\nnorth from the south pole, we might try cutting it in half. But when\nwe do so, we find that each half still has both a north and a\nsouth pole. No matter how many times we slice it, the total set of\ndifferent characteristics pertaining to the whole are also found in\nthat separate part: northness and southness are, in their entirety,\nfound in what was formerly, in the context of the whole magnet, purely\nthe north part, and also in the former south part. This is how it is\nin the Tiantai universe: the universe is one big magnet, but instead\nof just a north and a south, it has 3000 different characteristic\naspects: meness, youness, trains, oceans, dogs, soups, historical\nincidents, smiles, tears, delusion, enlightenment. If we try to\nisolate any of these, however, what we end up with is another entire\n\u201cmagnet\u201d, which also has all 3000 aspects to it: this\nmeness, it turns out, also has its youness part, its train part, its\nocean part, its dog part, and so on. When I face you, it is you-and-me\nfacing you-and-me. It is me-and-all-worlds facing all-worlds-and-me.\nIt is the entire universe facing the entire universe. We are always\ndifferent, because wherever we go, there is a you and a me, two\ndifferent aspects, never merging into a blank indifferent mush of a\nsingle quality. But since me-and-you is contrasted to me-and-you,\nthere is really no contrast at all: the same thing is found on both\nsides of the contrast. We are neither the same nor different. We are\ndivided from ourselves, impossible to unify into a simple unity, but\nfor that very reason we are impossible to separate from one\nanother. Each of us, at each moment, are, in a word, absolute, the\nCenter as which all appears, and which is appearing in and as all\nthings. All things are our transformation bodies, we are the\ntransformation body of all things.\n",
