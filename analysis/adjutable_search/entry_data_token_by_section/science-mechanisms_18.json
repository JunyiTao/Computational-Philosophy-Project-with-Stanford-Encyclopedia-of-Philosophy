    "main_text": "Metaphysics of Mechanisms || Mechanisms and Functions\n4.5 Mechanisms and Functions\nEmphasis on the importance of mechanisms is historically associated\nwith the rejection of teleology and formal causes (e.g., Westfall\n1971). Yet contemporary biology and many other special sciences,\ndespite the widespread acceptance of the mechanism framework concept,\ncontinue to make use of the concept of function, a teleological notion\n(see the entry on \n teleological notions in biology).\n How is the notion of function at play in contemporary\nscience related to the concept of mechanism? Craver (2001a), following\nCummins (1975), argues that functional description is a perspectival\nmeans of situating some part within a higher-level\nmechanism. According to this view, teleology is not a feature of the\nworld so much as it is imposed upon it by an intentional describer\n(see also Machamer 1977). Garson (2011, 2012), following Wimsatt\n(1972b), Wright (1973) and Neander (1991a,b), argues that functions\nare effects of an item that are part of the etiological explanation\n(through selection, learning, or reinforcement) for why the item is\npresent; as such, functions are reduced to causal histories. In a\nthird view, Maley and Piccinini (forthcoming) argue that the\n(teleological) function of an item is its contribution to the goals of\norganisms, which may be objective or subjective goals. Like Garson,\nMaley and Piccinini hold that functions are objective (i.e., not\nobserver relative). Unlike Garson, however, they are not grounded in\nthe etiology of the item but in their current contribution to survival\nor reproduction (the objective goals of organisms) or to what the\norganism itself desires (the subjective goals of organisms).\n",
