    "main_text": "Speaker-Meaning and Force || Grice\u2019s Account of Speaker Meaning\n5.1 Grice\u2019s Account of Speaker Meaning\n\n\nIn his influential 1957 article, Grice\ndistinguished between two uses of \u2018mean\u2019. One use is\nexemplified by remarks such as \u2018Those clouds mean rain,\u2019\nand \u2018Those spots mean measles.\u2019 The notion of meaning in\nplay in such cases Grice dubs \u2018natural meaning\u2019. Grice\nsuggests that we may distinguish this use of \u2018mean\u2019 from\nanother use of the word more relevant to communication, exemplified\nin such utterances as\n\nIn saying \u201cYou make a better door than a window\u201d, George\nmeant that you should move,\n\nand\n\nIn gesticulating that way, Salvatore means that there\u2019s quicksand over\nthere,\n\nGrice used the term \u2018non-natural meaning\u2019 for this\nuse of \u2018mean\u2019, and in more recent literature this jargon\nhas been replaced with the term \u2018speaker\nmeaning\u2019.[13]\n After distinguishing between natural and\n(what we shall hereafter call) speaker meaning, Grice attempts to\ncharacterize the latter. It is not enough that I do something that\ninfluences the beliefs of an observer: In putting on a coat I might\nlead an observer to conclude that I am going for a walk. Yet in such a\ncase it is not plausible that I mean that I am going for a walk in the\nsense germane to speaker meaning. Might performing an action with an\nintention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs be sufficient for speaker\nmeaning? No: I might secretly leave Smith\u2019s handkerchief at the crime scene to\nmake the police think that Smith is the culprit. However, whether or\nnot I am successful in getting the authorities to think that Smith is\nthe culprit, in this case it is not plausible that I mean that Smith\nis the culprit.\n\n\nWhat is missing in the handkerchief example is the element of\novertness. This suggests another criterion: Performing an action with\nthe, or an, intention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs, while\nintending that this very intention be recognized. Grice contends that\neven here we do not have enough for speaker meaning. Herod presents\nSalome with St. John\u2019s severed head on a charger, intending that she\ndiscern that St. John is dead and intending that this very intention\nof his be recognized. Grice observes that in so doing Herod is\nnot telling Salome anything, but is instead deliberately and\nopenly letting her know something. Grice concludes that Herod\u2019s action\nis not a case of speaker meaning either. The problem is not that Herod\nis not using words; we have already considered communicators who mean things\nwordlessly. The problem seems to be that to infer what Herod intends\nher to, Salome does not have to take his word for anything. She can\nsee the severed head for herself if she can bring herself to look. By\ncontrast, in its central uses, telling requires a speaker to intend to\nconvey information (or alleged information) in a way that relies\ncrucially upon taking her at her word. Grice appears to assume that at\nleast for the case in which what is meant is a proposition (rather\nthan a question or an imperative), speaker meaning requires a telling\nin this central sense. What is more, this last example is a case of\nperforming an action with an intention of influencing someone\u2019s\nbeliefs, even while intending that this very intention be recognized;\nyet it is not a case of telling. Grice infers that it is not a case of\nspeaker meaning either.\n\n\nGrice holds that for speaker meaning to occur, not only must one (a)\nintend to produce an effect on an audience, and (b) intend that this\nvery intention be recognized by that audience, but also (c) intend this effect on the audience to be produced at least in\npart by their recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention. The intention to\nproduce a belief or other attitude by means (at least in part) of\nrecognition of this very intention, has come to be called\na reflexive communicative intention.\n",
