    "main_text": "Causalism and Causal Theories of Action || Davidson on the Nature of Intentional Actions\n2.2 Davidson on the Nature of Intentional Actions\n\nAlthough initially presented as an account of the nature of action\nexplanation, Davidson\u2019s account also contains the basic\nstructure of an understanding of human action: according to Davidson,\na true action statement (of the form \u201dx \u03c6-ed\u201c) denotes\nan event, and more specifically, a bodily movement. A bodily movement\nis an action if, and only if, the event is an intentional action\n(Davidson 1971). Davidson does not say this\n explicitly,[2]\n but clearly on his view, an event is an intentional action under a\ncertain description, if and only if, there is a true rationalizing\nexplanation of the event under this description. Davidson (1971)\n(following Anscombe) points out that \u201dx \u03c6-ed\nintentionally\u201c creates an intensional context; that is whether\nan action is intentional depends on how the action is described. To\nuse Davidson\u2019s example, if I flip a switch, I also turn on the\nlight, and alert the burglar. On Davidson\u2019s view \u201dflipping\nthe switch\u201c, \u201dturning on the light\u201c, and\n\u201dalerting the burglar\u201c are all descriptions of the same\naction. The \u201daccordion effect\u201c (so dubbed by Feinberg\n1965), characteristic of human action, makes it the case that the\ncausal consequences of an intentional action provide further\ndescriptions of human actions. If my flipping the switch caused the\nlight to go on and the burglar to be alerted, then I also turned the\nlight on and alerted the burglar. However, only the first two are\nintentional actions. On Davidson\u2019s view, all these descriptions\nare descriptions of the same action; alerting the burglar is an action\nin virtue of the fact that these same bodily movements, under a\ndifferent description, are a case of intentional action (flipping the\nswitch). Thus Davidson concludes that, \u201dwe never do more than\nmove our bodies: the rest is up to nature\u201c (Davidson 1971, 23).\nWe can see now how the claims developed in these papers provide us\nwith a theory of action: an action is a bodily movement such that,\nunder some description, the bodily movement is causally explained by a\nprimary reason.\n\nThis also gives us the barebones of a causal theory of action:\naccording to \u201dcausalists\u201c, intentional action is explained\nin terms of mental states that are the causal antecedents, or\nconcomitants, of the agent\u2019s behaviour or bodily movement.\nSubsequent to Davidson, causalists have aimed to provide reductive\nexplanations: intentional action is identified with behaviour or\nbodily movement (or in less \u201dambitious\u201c versions of the\nview, a more general form of action, see Setiya 2011) whose causal\nantecedents (or concomitants) are certain specified mental states.\nAlthough Davidson himself is often portrayed as proposing a reductive\nanalysis, he never presents any of his views as fulfilling such\nambition and expresses skepticism that such analysis is possible given\nthe problem of deviance (see below).\n",
