This position is called \u201cdenotation of what is related\u201d (anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na) and it is opposed to the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 analysis discussed earlier (abhihit\u0101nvaya). The principle of parsimony is central to Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara arguments. On the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view, there are multiple levels of meaning and a complex process of moving from a word to a word meaning to a unified sentence which connects those meanings. \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha argues that it would be better to explain the resultant connections (anvaya) among word meanings as being understood directly from the word. The idea that the same operation is responsible for unifying the word meanings into a sentence anticipates, to a degree, Frege\u2019s idea of word meanings as unsaturated entities, although \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha is not thinking in the same ontological terms (see the discussion of semantic power and the reduction of semantic properties in the entry on analytic philosophy in the entry on early modern India, and Siderits 1991).\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara thinkers deny that the meaning of a \u201ccow\u201d is a universal and that indication is necessary to shift the generic referent of the noun to a particular. \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha argues that while it may be true that something the same is remembered in each case when someone says \u201ccow,\u201d this remnant of memory is not the same thing as a word meaning (PS: 381ff, Ollett 2020b). Meaning has to do with the role that a word\u2019s cognition plays within a sentence. Further, he argues that a word conveys the universal and the particular together, since the first cannot be understood without the second. So, while he agrees with the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das that a series of universals cannot be connected together in a qualificative relationship, he concludes that this is a reason to reject the view that words primarily communicate generalities (s\u0101m\u0101nya), arguing that they must communicate a qualified thing (vi\u015be\u1e63ana).\nHowever, \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha does leave room for the distinction between primary and secondary meaning in cases like \u201cThe village is on the Ganges\u201d and \u201cThe boy is a lion.\u201d He argues that where the ordinary meaning of words cannot form a connective relationship then there is recourse to secondary meaning. So in the case of words like \u201cGanges\u201d and \u201clion,\u201d the meaning\u2013in\u2013relation which is in connection with other word meanings is the secondary meaning, not the primary meaning. Despite this allowance for a distinction, the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view is often touted as a radically contextualist approach. For instance, Abhinavagupta, who lived after the highly influential \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha, characterizes the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara position as one on which there is no distinction between primary meaning, secondary meaning, or suggestion. He says that their view is that the meaning of the word is simply its final result (1.4b The Eye, DL). He points, however, out that the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 must accept different kinds of statements in the Vedas for exegetical purposes\u2014some more direct than others\u2014and thus they should have no problem in principle allowing for suggested meaning.\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas emphasize three concepts in their account of word and sentence meaning: expectancy (\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101), cognitive proximity (sannidhi), and semantic fittingness (yogyat\u0101). Depending on the word\u2019s role in a sentence, it will have different expectancies. This expectancy also varies depending on which word meanings are presented to the subject\u2019s mind as candidates for connection\u2014or which meanings have cognitive proximity (these may not be words which uttered in sequence, as a connected subject and verb may be separated by a dependent clause). Finally, the goal of a sentence is to convey something meaningful, so the word meanings in relation must work together semantically: a sentence such as \u201cSprinkle the garden with fire\u201d would fail to have semantic fittingness. These three criteria determine what the meaning-in-relations are which result in a sentence. Secondary meaning is resorted to when there is no relation possible (anvay\u0101nupapatti), such as when the word \u201cvillage\u201d cannot be related to \u201con the Ganges,\u201d since this expression would lack semantic fittingness. These three concepts are not restricted to Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas, however, but are discussed and refined in various ways by nearly all of the intellectual traditions treating language (see section 5.1).\n",
