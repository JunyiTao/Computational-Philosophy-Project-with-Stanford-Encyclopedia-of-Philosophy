    "main_text": "Bacon\u2019s Later Philosophy: Language Study and Science in the Service of both Moral Philosophy and Theology || Background\n5.1 Background\n\nAt the beginning of the Opus maius and related works, Bacon\noffers a structural critique of scholastic practice in the\nuniversities. He favors both language study and science over the\n\u201cSentence-Method\u201d as a way of interpreting the texts of\nPhilosophy and of Scripture. And he advocates training in mathematics\nand the sciences as requirements for students in theology. Second,\nBacon\u2019s later works on language and science are written in the\nspecific historical and political context of the Mongol invasion of\nEurope, the sack of Baghdad in 1258 by the Mongols, and the\ngeo-political situation of a Europe hemmed in by both the Mongols and\nIslam. His sense of world geography was aided by the travel reports of\nWilliam of Rubruck [Southern, WVI]. The wider historical context for\nBacon\u2019s concerns has recently been outlined by Amanda Power\n(Power 2013). The overall division of the Opus maius is\nPlatonic/Stoic: language study, natural philosophy/mathematics,\nmorals. The general context is theological and Franciscan: the arts\nand sciences leading to human well being in this world and the next.\nIt is also clear that Bacon is constructing a \u201cnew model\u201d\nfor medieval philosophy, one in which Aristotelian concerns are taken\nup and transcended in a Neo-Platonism with significant Roman Stoic\ninfluence and adapted to moral philosophy and Christian theology.\nMetaphysics is taken up and completed in Moral Philosophy. The latter\nbecomes the end of linguistic and scientific study. Logic is reduced\nto mathematics, and the applications of mathematics become central to\nan understanding of the sciences (Perler 2005). The applications of\nmathematics can in turn be used in religion and theology. Therefore,\nin his later works, especially in the Perspectiva and\nScientia experimentalis, Bacon will define\nexperientia-experimentum in a distinctly new manner, one that\ntakes up and also goes beyond the use of this term in Aristotle. His\nnew definition advances on his own Questiones from the 1240s.\nPeter King has recently claimed that Ockham was the first to create\nthis new definition of experientia-experimentum (2003). He is\ncorrect that this definition is found in Ockham, but not in claiming\nthat this concept began with Ockham. The concept is formulated in the\nscientific works of Roger Bacon and is found in a number of Franciscan\nwriters including John Pecham well before the age of Ockham (Hackett\n2009).\n",
