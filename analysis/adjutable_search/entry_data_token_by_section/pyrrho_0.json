    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nPyrrho appears to have lived from around 365\u2013360 BCE until\naround 275\u2013270 BCE (for the evidence see von Fritz (1963), 90).\nWe have several reports of philosophers from whom he learned, the most\nsignificant (and the most reliable) of which concern his association\nwith Anaxarchus of Abdera. Alongside Anaxarchus (and several other\nphilosophers) he allegedly accompanied Alexander the Great on his\nexpedition to India. We are told that in the course of this expedition\nhe encountered some \u201cnaked wise men\u201d\n(gumnosophistai); Diogenes Laertius (9.61) claims that his\nphilosophy developed as a result of this meeting, but it is not clear\nwhat basis, if any, he has for this assertion. In any case, after his\nreturn to Greece Pyrrho did espouse a philosophy that attracted\nnumerous followers, of whom the most important was Timon of Phlius.\nThe travel writer Pausanias reports (6.24.5) seeing a statue of him in\nthe marketplace in Pyrrho\u2019s home town of Elis in the\nPeloponnese; Diogenes also reports (9.64) that he was made high\npriest, and that in his honor philosophers were made exempt from city\ntaxation. While Pausanias\u2019 report is easier to accept at face\nvalue than Diogenes\u2019, both suggest that (at least locally) he\nachieved considerable celebrity. However, there is no good reason to\nbelieve that a Pyrrhonist \u2018movement\u2019 continued beyond his\nown immediate followers; it was not until the first century BCE that\nPyrrhonism became the name of an ongoing philosophical tradition.\n",
