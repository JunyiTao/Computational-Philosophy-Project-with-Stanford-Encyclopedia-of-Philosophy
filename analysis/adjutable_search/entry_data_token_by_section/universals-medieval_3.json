Boethius\u2019 Aristotelian Solution\n\nBoethius\u2019 solution of the problem stated in this form consists\nin the rejection of this last argument, by pointing out the ambiguity\nof the principle that \u201cwhat is understood otherwise than the\nthing is is false\u201d. For in one sense this principle states the\nobvious, namely, that an act of understanding that represents a thing\nto be otherwise than the thing is is false. This is\nprecisely the reading of this principle that renders it plausible.\nHowever, in another sense this principle would state that an act of\nunderstanding which represents the thing in a manner which is\ndifferent from the manner in which the thing exists is false. In this\nsense, then, the principle would state that if the mode of\nrepresentation of the act of understanding is different from the mode\nof being of the thing, then the act of understanding is false. But\nthis is far from plausible. In general, it is simply not true that a\nrepresentation can be true or faithful only if the mode of\nrepresentation matches the mode of being of the thing represented. For\nexample, a written sentence is a true and faithful representation of a\nspoken sentence, although the written sentence is a visible, spatial\nsequence of characters, whereas the spoken sentence is an audible,\ntemporal pattern of articulated sounds. So, what exists as an audible\npattern of sounds is represented visually, that is, the mode of\nexistence of the thing represented is radically different from the\nmode of its representation. In the same way, when particular things\nare represented by a universal act of thought, the things exist in a\nparticular manner, while they are represented in a universal manner,\nstill, this need not imply that the representation is false. But this\nis precisely the sense of the principle that the objection exploited.\nTherefore, since in this sense the principle can be rejected, the\nobjection is not\n conclusive.[11]\n\nHowever, it still needs to be shown that in the particular case of\nuniversal representation the mismatch between the mode of its\nrepresentation and the mode of being of the thing represented does in\nfact not entail the falsity of the representation. This can easily be\nseen if we consider the fact that the falsity of an act of\nunderstanding consists in representing something to be in a\nway it is not. That is to say, properly speaking, it is only an act of\njudgment that can be false, by which we think something\nto be somehow. But a simple act of understanding, by\nwhich we simply understand something without thinking it to\nbe somehow, that is, without attributing anything to it, cannot\nbe false. For example, I can be mistaken if I form in my mind the\njudgment that a man is running, whereby I conceive a man\nto be somehow, but if I simply think of a man without\nattributing either running or not running to him, I certainly cannot\nmake a mistake as to how he\n is.[12]\n In the same way, I would be mistaken if I were to think that a\ntriangle is neither isosceles nor scalene, but I am certainly not in\nerror if I simply think of a triangle without thinking either that it\nis isosceles or that it is scalene. Indeed, it is precisely this\npossibility that allows me to form the universal mental\nrepresentation, that is, the universal concept of all particular\ntriangles, regardless of whether they are isosceles or scalene. For\nwhen I think of a triangle in general, then I certainly do not think\nof something that is a triangle and is neither isosceles nor scalene,\nfor that is impossible, but I simply think of a triangle, not thinking\nthat it is an isosceles and not thinking that it is a scalene\ntriangle. This is how the mind is able to separate in thought what are\ninseparable in real existence. Being either isosceles or scalene is\ninseparable from a triangle in real existence. For it is impossible\nfor something to be a triangle, and yet not to be an\nisosceles and not to be a scalene triangle either.\nStill, it is not impossible for something to be thought to be\na triangle and not to be thought to be an isosceles\nand not to be thought to be a scalene triangle\neither (although of course, it still has to be thought to be\neither-isosceles-or-scalene). This separation in thought of those\nthings that cannot be separated in reality is the process of\n abstraction.[13]\n In general, by means of the process of abstraction, our mind (in\nparticular, the faculty of our mind Aristotle calls active\nintellect (nous poietikos, in Greek, intellectus\nagens, in Latin) is able to form universal representations of\nparticular objects by disregarding what distinguishes them, and\nconceiving of them only in terms of those of their features in respect\nof which they do not differ from one another.\n\nIn this way, therefore, if universals are regarded as universal mental\nrepresentations existing in the mind, then the contradictions emerging\nfrom the Platonic conception no longer pose a threat. On this\nAristotelian conception, universals need not be thought of as somehow\nsharing their being with all their distinct particulars, for their\nbeing simply consists in their being thought of, or rather, the\nparticulars\u2019 being thought of in a universal manner. This is\nwhat Boethius expresses by saying in his final replies to\nPorphyry\u2019s questions the following:\n\n\n\u2026 genera and species subsist in one way, but are understood in\nan another. They are incorporeal, but subsist in sensibles, joined to\nsensibles. They are understood, however, as subsisting by themselves,\nand as not having their being in others. [Five Texts, Spade\n1994, p. 25]\n\n\nBut then, if in this way, by positing universals in the mind, the most\nobvious inconsistencies of Plato\u2019s doctrine can be avoided, no\nwonder that Plato\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d universals, the\nuniversal models which particulars try to imitate by their features,\nfound their place, in accordance with the long-standing Neo-Platonic\ntradition, in the divine\n mind.[14]\n It is this tradition that explains Boethius\u2019 cautious\nformulation of his conclusion concerning Aristotelianism pure and\nsimple, as not providing us with the whole story. As he writes:\n\n\n\u2026 Plato thinks that genera and species and the rest are not\nonly understood as universals, but also exist and subsist apart from\nbodies. Aristotle, however, thinks that they are understood as\nincorporeal and universal, but subsist in sensibles.\n\nI did not regard it as appropriate to decide between their views. For\nthat belongs to a higher philosophy. But we have carefully followed\nout Aristotle\u2019s view here, not because we would recommend it the\nmost, but because this book, [the Isagoge], is written about\nthe Categories, of which Aristotle is the author.
