    "main_text": "Critical Responses || Hype\n5.1 Hype\n\n\nResearch on implicit bias has received a lot of attention, not only\nin philosophy and psychology, but in politics, journalism,\njurisprudence, business, and medicine as well. Some have worried that\nthis attention is excessive, such that the explanatory power of\nresearch on implicit bias has been overstated (e.g., Singal 2017;\nJussim 2018 (Other Internet Resources); Blanton & Ikizer 2019).\n\n\nWhile the difficulty of public science communication is pervasive\n(i.e., not limited to implicit bias research), and the most egregious\ncases are found in the popular press, it is true that some researchers\nhave overhyped the importance of implicit bias for explaining social\nphenomena. Hype can have disastrous consequences, such as creating\npublic distrust in science. One important point to bear in mind,\nhowever, is that the challenges facing science communication and the\nchallenges facing a body of research are distinct. That is, one\nquestion is whether the science is strong, and it is a separate\nquestion whether the strength of the science, such as it is, is\naccurately communicated to the public. Overhyped research may create\nincentives for scientists to do flashy but weak work\u2014and this is\na problem\u2014but problems with hype are nevertheless distinct from\nproblems with the science itself. \n",
