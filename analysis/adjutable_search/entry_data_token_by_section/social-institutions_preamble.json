    "main_text": "\n\nThe term, \u201csocial institution\u201d is somewhat unclear both in\nordinary language and in the philosophical literature (see below).\nHowever, contemporary sociology is somewhat more consistent in its use\nof the term. Typically, contemporary sociologists use the term to\nrefer to complex social forms that reproduce themselves such as\ngovernments, the family, human languages, universities, hospitals,\nbusiness corporations, and legal systems. A typical definition is that\nproffered by Jonathan Turner (1997: 6): \u201ca complex of\npositions, roles, norms and values lodged in particular types of\nsocial structures and organising relatively stable patterns of human\nactivity with respect to fundamental problems in producing\nlife-sustaining resources, in reproducing individuals, and in\nsustaining viable societal structures within a given\nenvironment.\u201d Again, Anthony Giddens (1984: 24) says:\n\u201cInstitutions by definition are the more enduring features of\nsocial life.\u201d He (Giddens 1984: 31) goes on to list as\ninstitutional orders, modes of discourse, political institutions,\neconomic institutions and legal institutions. The contemporary\nphilosopher of social science, Rom Harre follows the theoretical\nsociologists in offering this kind of definition (Harre 1979: 98):\n\u201cAn institution was defined as an interlocking double-structure\nof persons-as-role-holders or office-bearers and the like, and of\nsocial practices involving both expressive and practical aims and\noutcomes.\u201d He gives as examples (Harre 1979: 97) schools, shops,\npost offices, police forces, asylums and the British monarchy. In this\nentry the above-noted contemporary sociological usage will be\nfollowed. Doing so has the virtue of grounding philosophical theory in\nthe most salient empirical discipline, namely, sociology.\n\nIn the not so recent past it might have been asked why a theory of\nsocial institutions has, or ought to have, any philosophical interest;\nwhy not simply leave theories of institutions to the theoretical\nsociologists? However, in recent years philosophers have addressed a\nvariety of ontological, explanatory, normative and other theoretical\nissues concerning social institutions (Searle 1995, 2007 and 2010;\nTuomela 2002; Miller 2010; Epstein 2015; Guala 2016; Ludwig 2017). Of\nparticular importance is the work of John Searle (1995; 2010). One\nsource of the impetus for this has been recent philosophical work on\nsocial action and social forms more generally (Gilbert 1989; Searle\n1990); Tuomela 2007; Schmid 2009; Miller 2001; Bratman 2014; Tollefsen\n2015; Ludwig 2016). Another source is the recognition that a good deal\nof normative work on social justice, political philosophy and the like\npresupposes an understanding of social institutions. For instance,\nphilosophers, such as John Rawls (1972), have developed\nelaborate normative theories concerning the principles of justice that\nought to govern social institutions.  Yet they have done so in the\nabsence of a developed theory of the nature and point of the very\nentities (social institutions) to which the principles of justice in\nquestion are supposed to apply. Surely the adequacy of one\u2019s\nnormative account of the justice or otherwise of any given social\ninstitution, or system of social institutions, will depend at least in\npart on the nature and point of that social institution or\nsystem. Thus distributive justice is an important aspect of most, if\nnot all, social institutions; the role occupants of most institutions\nare the recipients and providers of benefits, e.g. wages, consumer\nproducts, and the bearers of burdens, e.g. allocated tasks and,\naccordingly, are subject to principles of distributive\njustice. Moreover, arguably some institutions, perhaps governments,\nhave as one of their defining ends or functions, to ensure conformity\nto principles of distributive justice in the wider society. However,\ndistributive justice does not appear to be a\ndefining feature, end or function of all social\ninstitutions. By this I do not mean that some social institutions are\nunjust and, for instance, exist in practice to serve narrow economic\nor other special interests (Marx 1867; Habermas 1978; Honneth 1995);\nthough clearly many are. Rather I am referring to the fact that a\nnumber of social institutions, such as the so-called Fourth Estate and\nthe university, are arguably not defined\u2014normatively\nspeaking\u2014in terms of justice, but rather by some other moral\nvalue(s), e.g. truth (Ostrom 2005; Miller 2010). \n\nThe entry has five sections. In the first section an overview of\nvarious salient accounts of social institutions and their main points\nof theoretical difference is provided. Accounts emanating from\nsociological theory as well as philosophy are mentioned. Here, as\nelsewhere, the boundaries between philosophy and non-philosophical\ntheorising in relation to an empirical science are vague. Hence, it is\nimportant to mention theories such as those of Emile Durkheim and\nTalcott Parsons, as well as those of John Searle and David Lewis.\nMoreover, it is also important to highlight some of the theoretical\ndifferences, notably those of an ontological character.\n\nIn the second section individualist theories of social institutions\nbased on rational choice theory and, in particular, on notions of\ncoordination equilibria are discussed (Lewis 1969; Guala 2016).\n\nIn the third section collective acceptance theories of social\ninstitutions are discussed (Searle 1995 and 2010; Tuomela 2002 and\n2007; Ludwig 2017). \n\nIn the fourth section the teleological account of social institutions\nis presented (Miller 2010).\n\nIn the fifth section, issues of agency are discussed. In what sense,\nif any, are institutions agents (French 1984; List and Pettit (2011);\nTollefsen 2015; Epstein 2015)? Is there an inconsistency between the\nautonomy (or alleged autonomy) of individual human agents, on the one\nhand, and the ubiquity and pervasive influence of institutions on\nindividual character and behaviour, on the other (Giddens 1984;\nBhaskar 1979)?\n",
