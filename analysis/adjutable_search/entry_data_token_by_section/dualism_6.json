    "main_text": "Varieties of Dualism: Interaction || Interactionism\n3.1 Interactionism\n\n\nInteractionism is the view that mind and body \u2013 or mental\nevents and physical events \u2013 causally influence each other. That\nthis is so is one of our common-sense beliefs, because it appears to be\na feature of everyday experience. The physical world influences my\nexperience through my senses, and I often react behaviourally to those\nexperiences. My thinking, too, influences my speech and my actions.\nThere is, therefore, a massive natural prejudice in favour of\ninteractionism. It has been claimed, however, that it faces serious\nproblems (some of which were anticipated in section 1).\n\n\nThe simplest objection to interaction is that, in so far as mental\nproperties, states or substances are of radically different kinds from\neach other, they lack that communality necessary for interaction. It is\ngenerally agreed that, in its most naive form, this objection to\ninteractionism rests on a \u2018billiard ball\u2019 picture of\ncausation: if all causation is by impact, how can the material and the\nimmaterial impact upon each other? But if causation is either by a more\nethereal force or energy or only a matter of constant conjunction,\nthere would appear to be no problem in principle with the idea of\ninteraction of mind and body.\n\n\nEven if there is no objection in principle, there appears to be a\nconflict between interactionism and some basic principles of physical\nscience. For example, if causal power was flowing in and out of the\nphysical system, energy would not be conserved, and the conservation\nof energy is a fundamental scientific law. Various responses have been\nmade to this. One suggestion is that it might be possible for mind to\ninfluence the distribution of energy, without altering its\nquantity. (See Averill and Keating 1981). Another response is to\nchallenge the relevance of the conservation principle in this context.\nThe conservation principle states that \u2018in a causally isolated\nsystem the total amount of energy will remain constant\u2019. Whereas\n\u2018[t]he interactionist denies\u2026that the human body is an\nisolated system\u2019, so the principle is irrelevant (Larmer (1986),\n282: this article presents a good brief survey of the options). This\napproach has been termed conditionality, namely the view that\nconservation is conditional on the physical system being closed, that\nis, that nothing non-physical is interacting or interfering with it,\nand, of course, the interactionist claims that this condition is,\ntrivially, not met. That conditionality is the best line for the\ndualist to take, and that other approaches do not work, is defended in\nPitts (2019) and Cucu and Pitts (2019). This, they claim, makes the\nplausibility of interactionism an empirical matter which only close\ninvestigation on the fine operation of the brain could hope to\nsettle. Cucu, in a separate article (2018), claims to find critical\nneuronal events which do not have sufficient physical explanation.This\nclaim clearly needs further investigation.\n\n\nRobins Collins (2011) has claimed that the appeal to conservation by\nopponents of interactionism is something of a red herring because\nconservation principles are not ubiquitous in physics. He argues that\nenergy is not conserved in general relativity, in quantum theory, or\nin the universe taken as a whole. Why then, should we insist on it in\nmind-brain interaction?\n\n\nMost discussion of interactionism takes place in the context of the\nassumption that it is incompatible with the world\u2019s being \u2018closed\nunder physics\u2019. This is a very natural assumption, but it is not\njustified if causal overdetermination of behaviour is possible. There\ncould then be a complete physical cause of behaviour, and a mental one.\nThe strongest intuitive objection against overdetermination is clearly\nstated by Mills (1996: 112), who is himself a defender of\noverdetermination.\n\n\nFor X to be a cause of Y, X must contribute\nsomething to Y. The only way a purely mental event could\ncontribute to a purely physical one would be to contribute some\nfeature not already determined by a purely physical event. But if\nphysical closure is true, there is no feature of the purely physical\neffect that is not contributed by the purely physical cause. Hence\ninteractionism violates physical closure after all.\n\n\nMills says that this argument is invalid, because a physical event\ncan have features not explained by the event which is its sufficient\ncause. For example, \u201cthe rock\u2019s hitting the window is causally\nsufficient for the window\u2019s breaking, and the window\u2019s breaking has the\nfeature of being the third window-breaking in the house this year; but\nthe facts about prior window-breakings, rather than the rock\u2019s hitting\nthe window, are what cause this window-breaking to have this\nfeature.\u201d\n\n\nThe opponent of overdetermination could perhaps reply that his\nprinciple applies, not to every feature of events, but to a \nsubgroup \u2013 say, intrinsic features, not merely relational or comparative\nones. It is this kind of feature that the mental event would have to\ncause, but physical closure leaves no room for this. These matters are\nstill controversial.\n\n\nThe problem with closure of physics may be radically altered if\nphysical laws are indeterministic, as quantum theory seems to assert.\nIf physical laws are deterministic, then any interference from outside\nwould lead to a breach of those laws. But if they are indeterministic,\nmight not interference produce a result that has a probability greater\nthan zero, and so be consistent with the laws? This way, one might have\ninteraction yet preserve a kind of nomological closure, in the sense\nthat no laws are infringed. Because it involves assessing the\nsignificance and consequences of quantum theory, this is a difficult\nmatter for the non-physicist to assess. Some argue that indeterminacy\nmanifests itself only on the subatomic level, being cancelled out by\nthe time one reaches even very tiny macroscopic objects: and human\nbehaviour is a macroscopic phenomenon. Others argue that the structure\nof the brain is so finely tuned that minute variations could have\nmacroscopic effects, rather in the way that, according to \u2018chaos\ntheory\u2019, the flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings in China might affect the\nweather in New York. (For discussion of this, see Eccles (1980),\n(1987), and Popper and Eccles (1977).) Still others argue that quantum\nindeterminacy manifests itself directly at a high level, when acts of\nobservation collapse the wave function, suggesting that the mind may\nplay a direct role in affecting the state of the world (Hodgson\n1988; Stapp 1993).\n",
