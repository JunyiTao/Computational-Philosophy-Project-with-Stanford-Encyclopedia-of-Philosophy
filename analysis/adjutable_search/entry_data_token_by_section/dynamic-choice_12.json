    "main_text": "Some Familiar Phenomena Illuminated by Dynamic Choice Theory\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nWhen one performs a series of actions that do not serve one\u2019s\nconcerns well, it is natural to feel regret and frustration. Why, it\nmight be wondered, is one doing so badly by oneself? Self-loathing,\ncompulsion, or simple ignorance might in some cases explain the\nsituation; but, oftentimes, none of these things seems to be at the\nroot of the problem. For, in many cases, one\u2019s steps along a\ndisadvantageous course seem voluntary, motivated by the prospect of\nsome benefit, and performed in light of a correct understanding of the\nconsequences of each step taken. As we have seen, dynamic choice\ntheory makes it clear how such cases are possible.\n\nAlthough an agent with a dynamic choice problem can often be described\nas insufficiently resolute, she is normally guided by her preferences\nor her evaluation of the options she faces. As such, she is not, in\ngeneral, properly described as simply out of control. Still, the\ncontrol she exhibits is inadequate with respect to the task of\neffectively governing her (temporally-extended) self. So her problem\nis, at least in part, a problem of effective self-governance over\ntime. Accordingly, some work on choice over time (e.g. Velleman 2000;\nBratman, 2012) includes discussion of effective self-governance over\ntime and explores the connection between the requirements for\neffective self-governance over time and the requirements for rational\nchoice over time (sometimes referred to as the requirements of\ndiachronic rationality). Some big questions in this area include the\nfollowing: To what extent does self-governance over time (or at least\neffective self-governance over time) require cross-temporal coherence\nin the form of a presumption in favor of prior intentions? To what\nextent does diachronic rationality require self-governance over time?\nAnd to what extent does diachronic rationality require cross-temporal\ncoherence in the form of a presumption in favor of prior intentions.\nMy own view is that it is ensuring the avoidance of self-defeating\nbehavior rather than ensuring self-governance over time that is\nrationally required, and so diachronic rationality requires a\npresumption in favor of prior intentions only when this is necessary\nfor avoiding self-defeating behavior (Andreou, 2012). But debate on\nthis topic has not been very extensive and further exploration of the\ntopic is certainly in order.\n",
