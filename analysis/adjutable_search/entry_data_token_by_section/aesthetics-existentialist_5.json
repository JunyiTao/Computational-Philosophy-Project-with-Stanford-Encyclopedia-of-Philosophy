    "main_text": "Ontology of the artwork\n6. Ontology of the artwork\n\n\nSartre drew some particularly interesting conclusions from the\ndefinition of the functions of art on the basis of an existentialist\nmetaphysics. These conclusions relate to what, in contemporary\ndiscussions, is called the \u2018ontology\u2019 of the artwork: the\ntype of reality of the artwork\u2019s different elements and their\ninternal relations. Mikel Dufrenne has most thoroughly pursued this\nontological approach.\n\n\nSartre\u2019s early texts on the imagination already provided\nsignificant insights in that regard (in particular, see\nDufrenne\u2019s lengthy discussions of them in his The\nPhenomenology of Aesthetic Experience, 1973). The freedom that\ncharacterises human subjectivity is manifested most vividly in a\nspecific type of intentionality: the imagining of an object.\nImagination exemplifies the power of human consciousness because it is\na type of intentionality that posits in the same act both the existence\nof the object and its inexistence, since it \u201cintends\u201d it\nprecisely as a virtual object. In imagination, the object is indeed\nintended by consciousness, but \u201cas absent\u201d, as\n\u201ccontaining a certain part of nothingness\u201d inasmuch as it\nis posited as not existing here and now (Sartre 1940). This\ndistinguishes it from the type of intentionality involved in\nperception, one of the key aspects of which is precisely the positing\nof its object as existent.\n\n\nThis emphasis on the \u2018derealising\u2019 aspect of the\nconsciousness of an image has important implications for the\nontological status of the artwork. The real, material elements of the\nartwork are, properly speaking, not the actual elements on which the\naesthetic judgement is fixed. These are fixed instead on a virtual\nobject, i.e., the work\u2019s ideal qualities, wherein the work\u2019s\nmeaning, power and beauty are manifested (Sartre 1940, 213; see also\nDufrenne 1973, 3). On this account, the material aspects of the artwork\nare \u201coccasions\u201d for the manifestation of the ideal aspects.\nSartre insists that one should reject any suspicion of dualism here:\n\u201cThere is no realisation of the imaginary, nor can we speak of\nits objectification,\u201d (ibid.) as though a prior mental\nrepresentation had been \u201cobjectified\u201d and realised in the\nactual artwork. Rather, the \u201creal\u201d artwork has two sides: a\nreal and an \u201cunreal\u201d (irr\u00e9el, virtual, or\nideal) side. These two are, however, indistinguishable. \u201cThe\npainting should then be conceived as a material thing visited from time\nto time by an unreal which is precisely the painted object\u201d\n(ibid; see Dufrenne 1973, 3\u201318). The real, says Sartre, is the\nanalogue of the ideal. Merleau-Ponty puts it in similar terms,\nat first in terms of sense and non-sense, and later on in terms of the\nvisible and the invisible: the ideal content of the artwork is\n\u201cin transparency behind the sensible or in the heart of the\nsensible.\u201d It \u201cdoubles up the lights and sounds from\nbeneath, is their other side or their depth\u201d (Merleau-Ponty\n1964a, 150\u2013151, but already in 1945a, 182\u2013183).\n\n\nThis general \u201cnegative\u201d dimension of the artwork (the\nfact that as an ideal object it is not reducible to the materiality\nthat carries it) applies also to each of the artwork\u2019s elements\nand their relations (the colours and shapes in a painting, the words\nand sentences in a novel, and so on). Existentialist\naesthetics generally insists on the unity that artistic expression\nbrings to the world. As a consequence of this emphasis on organic\nunity, it seems to propound a rather conventional image of the\naesthetic qualities of the artwork (see, for example, from a\ntheologically informed perspective, Marcel\u2019s discussion of the\nsymphony and the fugue as examples of self-enclosed\n\u201cperfection\u201d [1960b, 53\u201354]).\n\n\nHowever, Sartre\u2019s analyses of the relationship between the\nartwork\u2019s elements shows that the insistence on unity as a\ncriterion of artistic beauty is perhaps not as banal as it might sound.\nSartre\u2019s pre-war texts on the imagination are especially\ninformative on this topic. In them, Sartre shows the substantial\nrelationship between the power of human consciousness to\n\u201cnihilate\u201d the world (to overlook some of its aspects and\nemphasise others on the basis of an existential set of values) and the\ninternal coherence of the artwork:\n\n\n\u2026 each stroke of the brush (is) not for itself, (\u2026) it\n(is) given together with an unreal (irr\u00e9el) synthetic\nwhole and the aim of the artist is to construct a whole of real colours\nwhich enable this unreal to manifest itself. (\u2026) It is the\nconfiguration of these unreal objects that I designate as beautiful\n(Sartre 1940, 216).\n\n\nThis implies that the consistency of the existential project, from\nwhich the world is revealed in a special way, also commands the\nconsistency of the artwork. But the quote above also indicates the\nrelation between the different elements that make up the overall\ncomposition: in the end, every particular material element that\ncontributes to the general composition is related to the others through\na relation of negativity.\n\n\nThe theory of meaning that underpins this view of the\nartwork\u2019s structure thus seems to anticipate a Saussurean\ndefinition of language. Famously, Saussure analysed the functioning of\nlanguage as a \u2018diacritical\u2019 system in which each sign owes\nits signification not to a substantial, one-to-one relation between\nword and referent, but rather to its place within the overall\nlinguistic system. Basically, a sign means what it means on the basis\nof \u2018not being\u2019 any of the other signs. \u2018Dog\u2019\nmeans what it does because the signifier (the material sound) and the\nsignified (the intended meaning) differs from all others, and\nespecially the proximate ones: \u2018log\u2019, \u2018fog\u2019,\n\u2018god\u2019, and so on; \u2018wolf\u2019, \u2018cat\u2019,\nand so on.\n\n\nIn the same manner, the existentialist philosophers who dedicated\nthe most attention to the articulation of meaning (Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty) insist on the essentially diacritical essence of the\naesthetic element in a given composition: an element has aesthetic\nsignificance on the basis of its relation to the other elements, rather\nthan owing to any substantial meaning of its own. It follows that, for\nexample, in a painting the pleasure derived from a particular colour in\nisolation from the rest of the work is not \u2018aesthetic\u2019 in\nthe strong sense but only in a lower sense: as a pleasure for the\nsenses only. This also implies that often the meaning and aesthetic\npower of a composition (a text, a painting and so on) rests just as\nmuch on what is not said or not shown; what lies in-between the\nelements of the composition, rather than on the elements explicitly\nshown. The existentialists all insist that meaning is largely to be\nfound in a certain form of silence. In the case of a\nnovel:\n\n\n\u2026 the literary object, though realised through\nlanguage, is never realised in language. On the contrary, it\nis by nature a silence and a contestation of speech. The hundred\nthousand words aligned in a book can be read one by one without the\nmeaning of the work emerging; meaning is not the sum of the words, but\nits organic totality (Sartre 1948a, 30).\n\n\nThis means that the different elements of the artwork should not be\napproached separately or in their immediate reality, but in terms of\nhow they function organically, systematically and negatively. The\ncolours in a painting, and the choice of words and the rhythm of\nsentences in a novel are all but traces, ellipses, elisions, and\ncaesuras that suggest in the negative, just as much as the elements\npositively indicate the contours of a certain perspective onto the\nworld.\n",
