    "main_text": "The U.S. Constitution\n4. The U.S. Constitution\n\nIn 1851 Douglass broke from William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s position\nthat the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document and that the\nfree states should peacefully secede from the Union. In a letter to\nGerrit Smith, he reported that he was \u201csick and tired of arguing\non the slaveholder\u2019s side\u2026\u201d (21 January 1851 [FDSW:\n171\u2013173]). So, he decided to break with Garrison and side with\nSmith and the Liberty party\u2019s position that the United\nStates\u2019 founding documents were anti-slavery (Blight 1989:\n26\u201358; Root 2020).\n\nIn his famous speech on the topic, \u201cWhat To the Slave Is The\nFourth of July?\u201d (1852 [SFD: 55\u201392]), he detailed his\nsignature positions on the U.S. Constitution: that slavery is contrary\nto natural law, that blacks are self-evidently human and entitled to\nnatural rights, and that slavery is inconsistent with the\nConstitution, American Republicanism, and Christian doctrine, and that\nit should be\n forcefully\u2014violently\u2014resisted.[15]\n A principal example of this shift is the changes in his second\nautobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom (1855, FDAB);\nparticularly relevant is the extra and weighty meaning he imparts to\nthe famous scene of his fight with the slave breaker Covey\n (\u00a75).\n\nDouglass acknowledged that initially, he accepted the view, promoted\nby William Lloyd Garrison and allies aligned with him, that the\nframers intended to allow slavery to continue in the slave states and\nthat the Constitution was thereby consistent with the institution of\nslavery. However, the Garrisonian view of the Constitution resulted in\npassivity in the face of the Slave-holding states\u2019 threat of\nsuccession. That position did not sit well with Douglass because he\nwanted a more aggressive stance and strategy for abolishing slavery\nand the emancipation of the enslaved, including in the southern\nslave-holding states. Plus, he became convinced of the natural law\nreading of the U.S. Constitution that foregrounded the values outlined\nin the U.S. Declaration of Independence. What convinced him were the\narguments of Gerrit Smith, Lysander Spooner, William Goddell, and\nSamuel E. Sewall that the Constitution was an anti-slavery document\nand that the founders were at cross-purposes on the question of\nslavery. Douglass argued that the general ideas of America\u2019s\nfounding documents supported an interpretation of the U.S.\nConstitution as an evolving document in tune with the development of\ncivilization. Thus, he intoned the call, \u201clet there be\nlight\u201d, to capture his hope for abolition, emancipation, and\nuniversal political and social progress (1852 [SFD: 91]).\n\nDouglass\u2019s view of the Constitution is one of the reasons why he\nis associated with the assimilationist (or what is better understood\nas the integrationist tradition) tradition in African American\npolitical thought. It sets him up for the criticism that he did not\nsquarely recognize the racialized character of the nation, how deeply\nembedded race and racism were in its institutions, and that it was in\nmany respects a racial\n state.[16]\n Douglass, however, was not blithe to the nation\u2019s sins\u2014he\nrepeatedly and forcefully condemned them through the end of his life\n (\u00a712).\n His reading of the Constitution was reasonable, grounded in his\naffirmation of natural law theory, and it was an essential part of the\nhistory of abolition (Sinha 2016; Delbanco 2018).\n",
