    "main_text": "Doxastic Accounts\n2. Doxastic Accounts\n\n\nDoxastic accounts explain modesty and its value by appeal to the\npresence or absence of certain beliefs. The relevant beliefs are\ntypically self-evaluations, beliefs about our own value, skill, or\ngoodness. The content of the relevant beliefs is sometimes taken to be\ncomparative and sometimes not\u2014think of the difference between\nthinking that you\u2019re really great and thinking that you are\nbetter than others.\n\n\nIgnorance accounts explain modesty by appeal to states that are\nepistemically defective in some way; the modest person either lacks\ncertain beliefs about their own goodness or has false beliefs that\ninvolve underrating themselves. Accuracy accounts, on the other hand,\naim to remove any tension between epistemic and moral virtue and so\nexplain modesty via beliefs that are epistemically good. On these\nviews, modesty is at its heart about getting it right about\none\u2019s place in the world. Strong accuracy accounts make modesty\nincompatible with ignorance. For these views modesty is essentially\nabout having accurate beliefs. Weak accuracy accounts deny that\nmodesty requires an epistemic defect, but leave it open whether moral\nvirtue is compatible with epistemic vices.\n",
