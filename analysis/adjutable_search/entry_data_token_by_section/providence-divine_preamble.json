    "main_text": "\n\nTraditional theism holds that God is the creator of heaven and earth,\nand that all that occurs in the universe takes place under Divine\nProvidence \u2014 that is, under God\u2019s sovereign guidance\nand control. According to believers, God governs creation as a loving\nfather, working all things for good. Moreover, it is said, God is an\nabsolutely perfect being. He is, first of all, omniscient or\nall-knowing: he knows of all truths that they are true, and of all\nfalsehoods that they are false, whether they pertain to past, present\nor future. And God\u2019s knowledge does not change. Nothing is\nlearned or forgotten with him; what he knows, he knows from eternity\nand infallibly. Second, God is omnipotent or all-powerful: anything\nthat is logically possible, he can do. Finally, God is perfectly good:\nin all circumstances he acts for the best, intending the best possible\noutcome. Given these suppositions, our initial expectation would be\nthat all of creation, animate and inanimate, is ordained to perfect\ngood: that as creator God pitches his efforts, which none can resist,\ntoward accomplishing the greatest good imaginable, and hence that the\nworld in which we find ourselves is, as Leibniz put it, the best of\nall possible worlds. But alas, the evidence is otherwise. The world\nmay contain much good, but it is also a place of suffering,\ndestruction, and death. Life is brief, and afflicted with sorrows of\nevery kind\u2014as often as not with no discernible purpose at all,\nmuch less a good one. And it ends for each of us in personal\ndestruction\u2014in death, which trumps all worldly hopes, and\nconceals impenetrably any experience that may lie beyond. Nor are\nthese mere human hardships. Every living thing dies, all that is\nbeautiful perishes, everything nature builds is destroyed. Indeed, on\none scientific account of the end of things not an atom, not a photon\nwill escape the cauldron of the universe\u2019s final collapse. And\nthat is not all. In human affairs there is the additional evil of sin:\nthe willful wrongdoing of which we all are at times victims and at\nother times perpetrators. How can all of this be, if God\u2019s\nnature is as tradition postulates?\n",
