    "main_text": "Anti-Epicureanism\n6. Anti-Epicureanism\n\nIn line with John\u2019s heavy emphasis on moderation, significant\nsections of Books Seven and Eight of the Policraticus deliver\na withering critique of a philosophy he regards as the antithesis of\nmoderation, namely, Epicureanism (despite virtually no mention of\nEpicurus and/or his school in the examination of John\u2019s use of\nclassical philosophy in Hermand-Schebat 2015). While John\u2019s\nviews reflect Cicero\u2019s highly critical perspective (similar\ncriticisms exist in Seneca and Augustine\u2019s De civitate\ndei), several aspects of John\u2019s presentation of\nEpicureanism seem highly distinctive and innovative. In selectively\nappropriating Epicurean doctrines, he omits significant dimensions of\nthe tradition, while extending other elements in novel directions.\nClassical Epicureanism depended upon an atomistic cosmology that\nposited random occurrences in the void as the ontological premise of\nthe universe. As a consequence, classical Epicureans insisted that no\npolitical lessons followed from their moral theory. John sets aside\nthe cosmological backdrop to Epicurean ethical teachings, while also\nfinding in them the source of a potent (albeit dangerous) political\ndoctrine. There does not seem to be any direct precedent for such an\ninterpretation, but, given John\u2019s inventive use of authorities\nand exempla, one ought not to be surprised by his selective\nand idiosyncratic treatment of the Epicurean school (von Moos 1984;\nMartin 1984).\n\nOne indication that John is offering a unique reading of the Epicurean\ntradition emerges from his claim that the ideas of Epicurus himself\nare not to be mainly disdained, but that his followers should be\nblamed for turning his ethics into a form of untrammeled hedonism.\nDeviating from his ancient and patristic sources, John detaches master\nfrom school, finding some merit in Epicurus\u2019 notion that\nhappiness may be sought through the pursuit of moderate hedonism.\n\u201c[I]f moderation is displayed\u201d, John states,\n\n\nI do not judge it unbecoming \u2026 to dwell at times upon these\npleasures of the senses \u2026 [for] nothing is unseemly except that\nwhich is beyond measure. (FCP: 373)\n\n\n\u201c[T]he field of virtue\u201d consists neither in excessive\nenjoyment of nor denial of pleasure, but is to be found in \u201cthe\nmean between vices\u201d (FCP: 374).\n\nJohn asserts that the followers of Epicurus broke loose from the\ncrucial restraint of moderation, such that Epicureanism became the\npursuit of sensual pleasure without bounds. John separates\nEpicurus\u2019 acceptable philosophy from its later practice:\n\n\n\u2026[W]hat should have been the instrument of virtue has been\ndiverted by writers to the profit of filthiness. Flesh then has\nconcluded (for assuredly no man endowed with sense holds the opinion)\nthat to think, say, and do all that the mind, tongue, and hand covet\nand to thwart oneself or to repress one\u2019s inclination in nothing\nis the life of a man enjoying supreme happiness \u2026. (FCP:\n273)\n\n\nThe sensual has been placed above the philosophical, the external\nabove the internal, and pleasure above wisdom, so that in all ways\nEpicureanism subverts true happiness. Epicureanism not only perverts\nthe individual, but also the entire body politic, inasmuch as a nation\nthat \u201chas \u2026 been conquered by its own\nself-indulgence\u201d is ripe for conquest (FCP: 331).\n\nThose whom John labels Epicureans are so branded not because of any\nself-proclaimed adherence to the school of Epicurus, but rather\nbecause of their observable behaviors and deeds. Excess is the\ndefining characteristic of Epicureans, \u201cwho in all matters serve\ntheir own personal desires\u201d (PC: 182). Because they \u201cteach\nphilosophy and \u2026 serve their own private wills\u201d, they are\nalso hypocrites (PC: 175). Despite John\u2019s flexible standard for\nevaluating moderation, he finds that \u201cthe world is filled with\nEpicureans for the reason that in its great multitude of men there are\nfew who are not slaves to lust\u201d (FCP: 399\u2013400). Since most\npeople are susceptible to sensual gratification, one need not call\noneself an Epicurean, John asserts, in order to practice its\nteachings.\n\nJohn is convinced that Epicureans, lacking moderation, cannot achieve\nthe happiness that Epicurus himself postulated (FCP: 399), because\n\n\ntoilsome is the passage to happiness by the route of pleasure, for its\nvotaries gather wealth to maintain themselves, seek grandeur to be\nupheld by power, position to inspire respect and to avoid contempt,\nand aim at glory to win fame. Yet that life which Epicurus describes\nis not acquired by all these means. (FCP: 274)\n\n\nOne sign that a man driven by Epicurean acquisitiveness is\nnotoriety\u2014whether in conduct, speech, or dress\u2014\u201cfor\nnotoriety connotes lack of moderation\u201d (FCP: 371). Thus it is\nthat \u201cermine makes the judge\u201d (FCP: 386). A person\u2019s\ndesire for possessions \u201cexhaust[s] the strength of [his] whole\nbeing\u201d and can never lead to the good life, \u201c[f]or the\nfrenzy of avarice \u2026 covets to excess the possessions of others\nor guards its own too tenaciously\u201d (FCP: 277). John is explicit\nabout the origin of this vicious cycle: \u201cPride is the beginning\nof all sin\u201d, creating in man the desire to be pre-eminent. From\nits \u201cpoisonous root\u201d spring ambition, acquisitiveness,\nhoarding, resentment, flattery, false modesty, over-indulgence, and\nall manner of evils (FCP: 295).\n\nWhile John recognizes hierarchy as intrinsic to human and corporate\nrelations, he warns of the perverting effects hierarchy can produce\nwhen the twin pillars of liberality and justice have been toppled:\n\u201cWealth, influence, and favor, since they confer much power, put\ncharacter to a severe test\u201d (FCP: 298). The only way to survive\nsuch a test is to embrace the guiding light of moderation, for\n\u201c[e]ach one more easily becomes puffed up with pride in that in\nwhich he excels others, unless he be sustained by the grace of\nmoderation\u201d (FCP: 297). Though aware of Plato\u2019s contention\nthat such pleasures ought to be actively struggled against (a stock\nview of classical philosophers), John advocates that \u201cthe safer\ncourse [is] to flee and evade the conflict\u201d, as he has never\n\u201cread of anyone who has challenged carnal pleasures who has not\nfallen in the encounter\u201d (FCP: 353). Likely, his own experience\nand observations of rampant Epicureanism also inform his views.\n\nJohn\u2019s treatment of Epicureanism leads him to identify a\npolitical component not present in the ancient school. For John, the\nEpicurean mindset and lifestyle are intimately associated with and\nform the foundation for tyranny, which is not a wholly political\nconcept. The Policraticus details several species of tyrant:\nthe private tyrant, the ecclesiastical tyrant, and the public or royal\ntyrant (PC: 191\u201392). According to John, anyone who employs power\nto impose his will arbitrarily upon another is a tyrant. John admits\nthat his definition deviates considerably from the ordinary\nunderstanding:\n\n\nIt is said that the tyrant is one who oppresses a people by forceful\ndomination; but it is not solely over a people that [the tyrant]\nexercises his tyranny, but he can do so from the lowest position. For\nif not over a people, still he will lord over (dominatur)\nwhomever he can \u2026 Who is it who does not wish to come before\nsome other one if he might be subdued? (PC: 163)\n\n\nAnyone, in John\u2019s estimation, is capable of behaving\ntyrannically, owing to humans\u2019 deep-seated desire to seek\nsensual gratification. \u201cThey who wish to do their own will are\nto be rated as Epicureans\u201d, John concludes, \u201cfor when\nactions become the slave of lust, affection changes to passion\u201d\n(FCP: 399). The vices of Epicureanism spring from \u201cthe well of\npassion\u201d, which leads men to suppose that they \u201ccan do\nwith impunity\u201d whatever they wish and \u201ccan to a certain\ndegree be just like God\u201d\u2014not in imitation of divine\ngoodness, but in the belief that their wills can supplant God\u2019s\nown. Thus, Epicureanism promotes pride and ambition, leading to\n\u201ca passion for power and honors\u201d that constitutes the root\nof tyranny (PC: 162\u201363).
