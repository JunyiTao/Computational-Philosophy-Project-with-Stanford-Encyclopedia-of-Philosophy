    "main_text": "The Text of the Book of Changes || Decision Making\n1.2 Decision Making\n\nTogether, Jiji and Weiji show that human agency is\nthe key driving force that would transform a dreadful situation (e.g.,\nWeiji) into a more positive, enterprising situation (e.g.,\nJiji). For the authors of Xici, this is where\ndecision matters. In a favorable situation, if someone can make good\ndecisions as to what to do, how to do, and when to do, it will yield\n\u201cgood fortune\u201d as opposite to courting\n\u201cmisfortune.\u201d Even in an undesirable situation, if people\nare smart, they can find ways to make a horrendous situation into a\nmild \u201cremorse\u201d or even a less less-harmful\n\u201chumiliation.\u201d\n\nIn the hexagram and line statements, the importance of decision making\nis spelled out clearly. For instance, in the\nprognostications\u2014inquirers\u2019 interpretations of the\nmessages received in divination\u2014we find both positive utterances\nsuch as \u201causpicious\u201d (ji \u5409) and\n\u201cwithout blame\u201d (wujiu \u65e0\u548e) and\nstern warnings such as \u201ccalamity\u201d (xiong\n\u51f6), \u201cblame\u201d (jiu\u548e),\n\u201cregret\u201d (hui \u6094) and \u201cremorse\u201d\n(lin \u541d). These contrasting prognostications highlight\nthe reality of human existence that when the wind of luck is on our\nside, we will do well, but when we are out of luck, we will be doomed\nto failure.\n\nTake, for instance, Qian \u4e7e (\u4dc0 The Creative,\n#1). The line statements depict the six yang lines as a dragon in\nvarious positions (for a translation of Qian, see WB67:\n3\u201310). Reading from the bottom to the top, the first line of\nQian is a \u201chidden dragon\u201d, the second line an\n\u201cemerging dragon\u201d, the third line \u201ca gentleman\n(perhaps a stand in of a dragon) in deep thought all day long\u201d,\nthe fourth line a \u201cwavering dragon\u201d, the fifth line a\n\u201cflying dragon\u201d, and the top line an \u201carrogant\ndragon\u201d (see\n Appendix 5).\n In addition, each line statements of Qian suggest a proper\ncourse of action in respective to the position of the dragon. Thus,\nthe \u201chidden dragon\u201d should avoid taking aggressive action,\nthe \u201cemerging dragon\u201d and the \u201cflying dragon\u201d\nmost look for assistance from \u201ca great man\u201d, the\n\u201cwavering dragon\u201d should take flight over the depths\ndespite the danger and apparent risks, and the \u201carrogant\ndragon\u201d will regret being stubborn and excessively\nconfident.\n\nBut, as a hexagram, Qian is ambiguous. On the one hand, in\nfive of its six lines, the tone seems to be upbeat, projecting an\nimpression of an incessant progress from a hidden dragon to an\nemerging dragon, a wavering dragon and finally a flying dragon. On the\nother hand, the progression is abruptly interrupted by the swift\ndownfall of an arrogant dragon. Like a Greek tragedy, the rapid fall\nof the arrogant dragon suggests hubris, highlighting the danger of\nexcessive human pride in making strenuous efforts to pull oneself\nup.\n\nTo highlight the danger of hubris, the authors of Tuan zhuan\n\u5f56\u50b3 (Commentary on the Decision, one of the Ten Wings),\nemphasize the importance of creatively and continuously assuming the\npositions of the six dragons in response to the challenges in daily\nlife (for a translation of the Tuan zhuan statement, see\nWB67: 370\u201372). By taking up all six positions of the six\ndragons, the authors of Tuan Zhuan mean two things. First,\nthey view Qian not as a structure of six discrete steps\nstarting from the first line and ending with the top line. Rather they\nsee Qian as a continuum, a cycle of events that keeps\nrepeating itself. Even if one strictly follows the incremental\nprogress from a hidden dragon (the first line) to an emerging dragon\n(the second line) to a flying dragon (the fifth line), upon reaching\nthe top (an arrogant dragon), one must go back down to a hidden dragon\nand to start all over again. Second, the authors of Tuan\nzhuan suggest readers when facing a challenge in their lives,\nthey should choose a dragon most suitable to the circumstances, such\nas to assume the position of a hidden dragon when starting a new\nbusiness or beginning a new career, to act like an emerging dragon\nafter receiving recognition from peers or bosses, to be like a\nwavering dragon when making crucial transition in career or location,\nto be like a flying dragon when everything seems to be flourishing,\nand last but not least, to avoid becoming an arrogant dragon when\neverything looks perfect but a decline is imminent.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors of Xici also highlight the\nimportance of decision-making by putting strong emphasis on human\nprecariousness. To draw attention to making wise decisions, the\nauthors of Xici focus on \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d\n(youhuan \u6182\u60a3) as a main theme of the\nChanges. For instance, they link the rise of the popularity\nof the Changes to the political crisis during the Shang-Zhou\ntransition (Xici II: 7; WB67: 345). To them, the popularity\nof hexagram divination was a consequence of the \u201cfear and\nanxiety\u201d arisen from the transferal of the \u201cmandate of\nheaven\u201d (tianming \u5929\u547d) from the Shang\nrulers to the Zhou rulers. Particularly, they view the epic battle\nbetween the last ruler of Shang (King Zhou \u7d02\u738b) and the\nfirst ruler of Zhou (King Wen \u6587\u738b) as the turning point\nin this drastic shift in political fortune, where the evil king was\nbrought low by the superior power of a virtuous ruler. In this epic of\nShang-Zhou translation, the authors of Xici find an\naffirmation of the Mandate of Heaven\u2014an invisible force of the\nuniverse in choosing wise rulers, and also a stern warning in the\nconcrete facts that a once powerful King Zhou was brought low due to\nthe circumstances. Particularly in the downfall of the evil King Zhou,\nthe authors of Xici remind readers of the disastrous\nconsequences of bad decisions and reckless moves.\n\nFor the authors of Xici, whether provoking fear or instilling\nanxiety, the effect of hexagram divination is the same. It forces\nreaders to reflect on their arrogance, complacency, and\nself-indulgence. It shocks them to look for ways to come to terms with\ncontingency and uncertainty. Above all, it directs attention to the\ndark side of human beings such as complacency, jealousy, greediness,\nand wickedness.\n",
