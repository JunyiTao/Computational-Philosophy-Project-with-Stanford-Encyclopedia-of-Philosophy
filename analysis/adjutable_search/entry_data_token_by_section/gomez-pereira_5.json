    "main_text": "Animal Mechanism\n5. Aftermath\n\nThe little attention that has been paid to the Antoniana\nMargarita by Spanish researchers (outside Spain this attention\nhas been non-existent) has been mainly focused on the impact of the\nwork especially in post-sixteenth century philosophy, just when its\nfortune was linked to the Cartesian philosophy as a possible precedent\nof the animal mechanism formulated by the French philosopher (see\nGonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 99\u2013125; Bandr\u00e9s & Llavona\n1993: 131\u2013137; Valverde 2019: 55\u201361). However, a closer\nlook allows us to verify that in the immediate context of sixteenth\ncentury Spanish philosophy the Antoniana had a certain\nimpact, negative rather than positive. G\u00f3mez Pereira himself\nintroduced in an early reprint of his work the first or at least one\nof the first reactions to his book. In this case, the reaction was\nsolicited directly by Pereira, because he asked his old teacher Miguel\nde Palacios, Professor of Theology at the University of Salamanca, for\na critical survey of his book. The Objectiones which Palacios\nwrote to please his pupil were included in the Antoniana\nMargarita and accompanied by an Apologia where Pereira\nsummarized and defended all the theses previously\nestablished. Palacios\u2019 attitude was that of a professor who\ncondescendingly reads the work of a good student, not that of a\ngenuine critic. In any case, these Objectiones failed to\nidentify the central message of the Antoniana, either because\nthe author did not read the work carefully or because he did read it\nbut did not understand his student\u2019s thought.  Palacios\u2019\nwork analyzed some questions which, even if they do not lack some\ninterest, do not address the core of the work, that is,\nPereira\u2019s intention of dissociating the soul and the body so as\nto formulate on this basis a demonstrative proof of the immortality of\nthe human soul. For, even if in the order of the text the thesis of\nanimals\u2019 lack of sensory perception is the first issue\naddressed, this was only one of the consequences drawn from the\nclaimed independence and unity of the human soul. In Palacios\u2019\nopinion, however, that was the only significant content of the book,\nso he was unable to build a systematic criticism of Pereira\u2019s\narguments.\n\nAnother notably adverse reaction to the Antoniana was\nthe Endec\u00e1logo contra Antoniana Margarita, written in\nCastilian by Francisco Sosa, a colleague of Pereira who lived in the\nsame city and probably met him. This work is a satiric fable in which\nthe animals bring a suit before Jupiter, as a judge, against Pereira\nbecause he has deprived them of genuine sensory perception and\nself-movement. Gonz\u00e1lez Vila emphasizes that the work, beyond\nits questionable literary quality and lack of philosophical depth,\nserves only to demonstrate that the Antoniana had some\npopular repercussion (see Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 102).\n\nThese two books show that the immediate reception of Pereira\u2019s\nwork was adverse and probably disappointing for the author, who could\nfeel misunderstood and unjustly attacked. In any case, the echo of his\nwork vanished soon, as evidenced by the fact that during the next\ncentury the references to the Antoniana and to G\u00f3mez\nPereira himself were very few.\n\nThe second period dates from the moment when G\u00f3mez Pereira\nbecame the object of the attention of those who saw in him a precedent\nof the philosophy of Descartes. The great occasion for this ephemeral\nchange arose from the French philosopher Pierre Bayle. Before him,\nVossius had already spoken of Pereira as a precursor of animal\nmechanism (Vossius, De theologia gentili, 1641 [1700: vol. V,\np. 345]). But when Bayle\nincluded Pereira in his Dictionnaire (Bayle 1730: vol. III,\npp. 649\u2013656), he gave rise to a debate about the true\noriginality of Descartes before the unquestionable precedent contained\nin the Antoniana Margarita. Bayle did not discuss\nPereira\u2019s merit as the true author of a primitive version of\nanimal mechanism, but he thought that the real originality should\nnevertheless be attributed to Descartes, because his mechanism derived\nfrom the firm principles of its philosophy, while Pereira had only an\ningenious occurrence without the support of a true system of\nprinciples such as that of Descartes.\n\nFrom this moment on, the figure of Pereira acquired a relevance like\nnever before. Even if Bayle tried to show the unmethodical way in\nwhich the doctor of Medina del Campo expressed his doctrine of\nanimals\u2019 lack of sensory perception, the fact is that it did not\ntake the opponents of Descartes long to spread the suspicion that he\nhad plagiarized some of the contents of the Antoniana\nMargarita. This accusation was known to the extent that Adrien\nBaillet, the great biographer of the French philosopher, was obliged\nto claim that the doctrine of animal mechanism had already been\nconceived by the young Descartes before he had the opportunity to know\nof the existence of Pereira\u2019s book (Baillet 1691: vol. I, p. 51\nff.). However, it has been maintained that neither the chronological\nobservations of Baillet nor the denial expressed by Descartes himself\nof having read Pereira\u2019s work completely rules out the\npossibility that he could have read Pereira\u2019s book in the\nNetherlands, where it was probably more accessible than in France.\nThose chronological reasons of Baillet were not accepted by many\nothers, such as Huet, who openly stated that Pereira had clearly\nanticipated Descartes in the theory of animal automatism (Huet 1689\n[1734: 193 ff.]).\n\nOther references to the work of G\u00f3mez Pereira can be found\nduring the transition from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century,\nfor example, in the Portuguese Jewish physician Isaac Cardoso, who\nedited his Philosophia libera in 1673. Here Pereira is placed\non the same level as Vall\u00e9s and Gassendi as a modern atomist\nwho rejected the Aristotelian concept of prime matter. Even in Leibniz\nhimself we can find traces of Pereira: in two letters dated on 1711\nand 1713 he said he was looking for a copy of the Antoniana,\nand after having found it, he recognized that the thought of Descartes\nwas not too different from that of Pereira. Leibniz believed, however,\nthat the French philosopher had not read his work.\n\nThe question of Descartes\u2019 debt to G\u00f3mez Pereira will be\nfound again among the Enlightenment writers, as we can see in the\nDictionaries of Calmeto, Moreri, Brucker, etc. (see Bandr\u00e9s\n& Llavona 1993: 133\u2013134). In the Encyclopedia of\nDiderot and D\u2019Alembert, particularly in the article devoted to\nthe soul of beasts, we may read that Descartes was the first who dared\nto treat animals as mere machines, even if G\u00f3mez Pereira had\nsaid something similar before him, but he arrived at this concept by\npure chance. The Enlightenment authors echoed the opinion of Bayle in\npointing out that Pereira did not draw his doctrine from any\nprinciple, and therefore his name had scant relevance: he suffered the\nsaddest thing that can happen to an innovator, \u201cil ne fit\npoint de Secte\u201d (Bayle 1730: vol. III, pp. 651).\n\nOne unexpected effect of the presence of G\u00f3mez Pereira in the\nFrench erudite elite, even if in a pale way, was the recovery of his\nwork during the eighteenth century. But, unfortunately for our author\nagain, this recovery did not involve any serious and detailed study of\nhis thought (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 109). The unique perspective\nadopted to comment on and analyze the contents of the Antoniana\nMargarita was determined by the notion of their possible\ninfluence on Descartes; moreover, the Spanish writers generally\nfollowed the sentence of Bayle denying such an influence. One of the\nmost notable exceptions was the Jesuit Juan de Ulloa, who after\nrefuting mechanism and atomism, said that, in spite of everything, he\nwas proud of the fact that some of his countrymen, such as Pereira and\nVall\u00e9s, had guided such powerful minds as that of Descartes\n(Bandr\u00e9s & Llavona 1993: 134).\n\nThis growing interest in animal mechanism and specifically in the\nAntoniana Margarita was the cause of the second and final\nedition of the book in 1749, whose preface and permission generously\npraised G\u00f3mez Pereira, and lamented the fact that such an\ninnovator had fallen into total oblivion among the philosophers of his\nown land. Unfortunately, this new edition did not remedy the\nprevailing ignorance about him, as one can realize by reading the\ndifferent works of natural philosophy and the dictionaries produced in\nSpain at that time, where there are few references to our doctor and\nthey seem to come from indirect sources, not from a direct reading of\nthe text.\n\nThis same poverty of references to G\u00f3mez Pereira\u2019s\nphilosophy was also present during the nineteenth century, at least\nuntil the moment when, in the context of a debate on Spanish science\nwhich was stimulated by Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo and J. M. Guardia,\namong others, the figure of G\u00f3mez Pereira was recovered as an\nillustrious example of a true scientific tradition, or on the contrary\nas an exception in the most desolate desert.\n\nIn the case of Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, whose interest in the\nAntoniana came from his youth, G\u00f3mez Pereira was\nconsidered as an outstanding physician, a great scholar and a true\npioneer of Cartesianism not only from the point of view of animal\nmechanism, but also as the first author of the famous cogito ergo\nsum (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 113). Later the Cantabrian\nscholar dedicated a detailed monographic study to the\nAntoniana, which he first published independently in 1878 and\nlater as an appendix to his famous work La ciencia\nespa\u00f1ola (Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo 1887\u20131888: vol. II,\nAppendix). Against the interpretative tradition that was\nrooted in Pierre Bayle\u2019s opinion with respect to the thought of\nPereira, Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo argued that in the Antoniana\nthere is a complete philosophical system based on well-established\nprinciples. The image of Pereira drawn by Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo was\nthat of a great thinker (comparable to Vives), a sincere Catholic who\nwas able to reconcile independence with orthodoxy, and someone who\nrepresented the living proof of the freedom of Spanish scientists\nunder the Inquisition.\n\nAnother relevant vision of the Castilian doctor, contemporary with\nthat of Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, can be found in the doctor, science\nwriter and Humanist Jos\u00e9 M. Guardia, who was educated in France\n(in fact, the majority of his works were published in the famous\nRevue Philosophique de la France et de l\u2019Etranger).\nGuardia destined an extensive study to the figure of G\u00f3mez\nPereira, for whom he felt a special affinity as a free thinker in a\nremarkably hostile environment (Guardia 1889: 270\u2013291,\n382\u2013407, 607\u2013634). He tried to present him as a victim of\nthe Inquisition in Spain: Pereira\u2019s unquestionable materialism\nwas soon persecuted, and his works almost disappeared. But, in spite\nof everything, an heroic Pereira was able to exercise a scientific\nmethodology which helped him to overcome all the prejudices\naccumulated over the long history of the scholastic school. From this\nperspective, Guardia held that the third part of the\nAntoniana devoted, as we have seen, to the immortality of the\nsoul, was only a subterfuge to \u201ckeep up appearances\u201d. For\nhim the central thesis of the book is the animal mechanism, where it\nis necessary to place Pereira\u2019s great originality. With regard\nto the \u201cCartesian question\u201d Guardia emphasized that\nneither Descartes nor the Cartesians wanted to recognize how much\ntheir philosophy owed to this Spanish doctor. This debate on the\ninterpretation and the meaning of Pereira\u2019s thinking somehow\ndetermined his recovery among the small number of Spanish scholars who\nhave focused their attention on the figure of G\u00f3mez Pereira\nduring the twentieth century (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 120 ff.).\n",
