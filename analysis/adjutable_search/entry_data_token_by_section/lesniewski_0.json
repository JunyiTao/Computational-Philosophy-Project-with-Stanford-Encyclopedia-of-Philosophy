    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nStanis\u0142aw Kazimierz Le\u015bniewski was born on 28 March 1886 at\nSerphukhov, near Moscow, to Izydor, an engineer working on the\nconstruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and Helena, n\u00e9e\nPalczewska. He was baptised at St. Stanislav\u2019s church in\nSt. Petersburg. His mother died when he was young and his father\nremarried. He attended classical Gimnazjum (grammar school\nstudying classical languages) in Irkutsk in Siberia. Between 1904 and\n1910 Le\u015bniewski studied Philosophy and Mathematics in Germany,\nSwitzerland and Russia, at Leipzig, Zurich, Heidelberg,\nSt. Petersburg, and at Munich, where he heard lectures by Hans\nCornelius, Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pf\u00e4nder. In 1910 he went\nas a doctoral student to Lw\u00f3w University, then in\nAustria-Hungary, where the foremost Polish philosopher of the day,\nKazimierz Twardowski, a student of Franz Brentano, was professor and\nwas building up a cadre of outstanding young philosophers. In 1912 he\nobtained his doctorate with a dissertation Przyczynek do analizy\nzda\u0144 egzystencjalnych [Contributions to the Analysis of\nExistential Propositions]. This was published the previous year in the\nleading Polish-language philosophy journal Przegl\u0105d\nFilozoficzny. Several further publications followed until the\noutbreak of war, which Le\u015bniewski spent in Moscow teaching\nmathematics at Polish schools. During this period he developed what\nlater became known as Mereology. After the Bolshevik Revolution in\nRussia, Le\u015bniewski left Russia for Poland. During the\n1919\u201321 Polish\u2013Bolshevik War he worked under Lt. Col. Jan Kowalewski as a codebreaker\nfor the Polish General Staff\u2019s Cipher Section, in part because of his knowledge of Russian, helping Poland to\nsurvive Russia\u2019s attempt to reconquer it. He tried unsuccessfully to\nobtain his habilitation in Lw\u00f3w, where he was blocked, getting\nit instead in the University of Warsaw, where in 1919 he became\n(Extraordinary\u2014Associate) Professor of the Foundations of\nMathematics, a position especially created for him. From then until\nhis final illness Le\u015bniewski lectured regularly on logical and\nmathematical topics, and built up his logical systems. Though his\nlogic never became widely accepted, even in Poland, with Jan\n\u0141ukasiewicz he was respected as one of the co-founders of the\nWarsaw School of Logic. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s only doctoral student,\nAlfred Tarski (Le\u015bniewski used to boast of having 100% geniuses\nas doctoral students) joined them to form the world\u2019s pre-eminent\ncentre of mathematical logic in the interwar years. Le\u015bniewski\nwas made a full professor in 1936. Always a smoker, he contracted\nthyroid cancer and died on 13 May 1939 at the age of 53. His papers,\nentrusted to his student Boles\u0142aw Soboci\u0144ski, included\nunfinished works on logical antinomies and on many-valued logic. All\nthese papers were destroyed during the Warsaw Rising of 1944.\n",
