    "main_text": "The Pragmatic Philosopher as Public Intellectual\n4. The Pragmatic Philosopher as Public Intellectual\n\nSidney Hook\u2019s emergence as a major American philosopher and his\naccompanying prominence as an influential intellectual in the American\ncultural and political scene took place during the decades of the\n1930s and 40s. During that period he was recognized as a forceful\ndefender of pragmatic theses in theory of knowledge and ethical\ntheory. Yet the greatest part of Hook\u2019s oeuvre is\ncomprised of writings on the issues that were brought into focus\nwithin American social and political thought in the post-War period.\nAs a political philosopher, Hook had been involved from the outset of\nhis career in the fundamental issues of democracy, liberty and\nequality. In the post-War period, however, Hook was embroiled in\npolitical controversy over the balance between individual liberty and\nnational security occasioned by the exigencies of the Cold War.\nHook\u2019s support for a balance which recognized the need for\nlimitations of liberty for the sake of national security led him to a\ncritique of the dominant liberal position which argued against new\nexecutive or legislative efforts to enhance national security that\ncould requires any limitation of individual liberty. On Hook\u2019s\nview, the traditional liberal position of the Millian variety\nrepresented a form of what he termed \u201critualistic\nliberalism.\u201d\n\nHook\u2019s belief in democracy involved a commitment to civil\nliberties and racial desegregation. Again, after the 1960s, he was\ninvolved in political controversy over the legitimacy of\ndiscrimination on grounds of race as an instrument for educational\ndesegregation and racial integration.\n\nThe range of issues on which Hook wrote included the redirection and\nreshaping of his perennial interest in philosophy of education and in\nthe relationship between the economic structure of a society and its\npolitical institutions. In the post-War period, Hook revisited his\nearlier position in philosophy of education as well as his support for\nsocialism. His later work in philosophy of education involved him in a\nresponse to the emergence in the 1960s of an educational approach that\nadvocated relevance as the most important criterion for the\neducational curriculum, as well as a response to the debate between an\nemphasis on the Western tradition and the thesis of multiculturalism\nin education. Along similar lines, his reexamination of the issues\nraised by socialist theory was engendered by the need to respond to\nthe evidence that had emerged, particularly by the 1980s, regarding\nthe failure of socialist economics in diverse countries where it had\nbeen practiced. The positions that Hook advanced in these areas were\ngenerally perceived as representing a shift from his\nself-identification as an anti-communist democratic socialist to his\narrival at a prominent place in the diverse ranks of supporters of\nAmerican conservative thought. Yet Hook had remained constant to his\npragmatism which sought to resolve ideological issues on the basis of\na continuing and ongoing inquiry, evaluation of evidence, and\nappraisal of values.\n\nHook followed Dewey in considering the philosophy of education to be a\ncentral focus of concern for any social and political philosophy. Hook\nargued that American educational institutions, in their bureaucratic\nstructure and organization, were too authoritarian and were not\nsufficiently responsive to the needs of the individual student. As for\nthe content of the curriculum and the methods of teaching, Hook argued\nthat they were too rigidly bound by the traditional disciplines and\nwas insufficiently concerned with the classroom as a community of\ninquiry or a forum for the development of critical and independent\nthinking. Under Dewey\u2019s banner, a legion of advocates and\nsupporters of progressive education had carried out a thoroughgoing\nreform of American educational institutions. These reforms included\nthe development of alternative schools that defined themselves as\n\u201cchild-centered\u201d and the development of curricula that\nabolished traditional requirements in favor of the rights of students\nto have a greater role in the determination of the course of their own\nof studies. Like Dewey, Hook came to the conclusion that the\ndevelopments within progressive education that had been fostered in\nDewey\u2019s name had gone too far in their rejection of the need for\nauthority and the importance of liberal education as an education in\nfundamental knowledge, including the knowledge of traditional subject\nmatter. As a result, Hook tried to formulate a measured criticism that\nwould balance the strengths of the American educational system and\ntradition while at the same time seeking to reform aspects of that\nsystem and that tradition. In his Education for Modern Man of\n1946, Hook sought to develop a direction for American education that\nwould conform to the ideals of pragmatic liberalism. For Hook, this\nrequired that the classroom should become a community of inquiry in\nwhich students would develop their potentiality for critical inquiry\nas a method which is analogous to scientific method. One of the\nstrongest claims in Education for Modern Man was the primacy\nof method for education. To a degree, Hook\u2019s belief in the\nprimacy of scientific method presupposed the pragmatist account of a\ngeneralized methodology for all the sciences. Criticism of the\npragmatic thesis of a single generalized scientific method as opposed\nto the recognition of the difference in the methods used in the\nwriting of history, the study of literature and research on social\nproblems as distinct from the methods of the natural sciences had an\nimpact on Hook\u2019s philosophy of education. Hook\u2019s\nsubsequent recognition of the ways in which the teaching of science\ninvolved the learning of substantive subject matter and experimental\ntechniques rather than a generalized method for the criticism and\ntesting of hypotheses marked a nuanced shift in his educational\nphilosophy.\n\nAlthough Education for Modern Man recognized the place of the\nmajor intellectual disciplines in the sciences and the humanities in\nthe curriculum of the public school and the college, the stress was\nnot laid upon the learning of the substantive subject matter as much\nas upon the development of the student\u2019s ability for independent\nthinking and the fostering of his capacity for exercising critical\nintelligence. Similarly, although the authority of the teacher and\nadministrator was recognized, the stress was placed upon the\ndemocratic character of the classroom as a community of free inquiry.\nIn Hook\u2019s interpretation of education, a condition for the\nidentification of an educational institution as a democratic\ninstitution was the requirement that it sustain freedom of\ninquiry.\n\nIn Hook\u2019s general theory of democracy, the idea of freedom of\ninquiry also retained pride of place. Thus constraint on freedom of\ninquiry by a democratic majority in an electoral democracy would\nrepresent not only a violation of freedom but a violation of the\ndemocratic process. Continuous with the value of freedom of inquiry,\nthe idea of cultural freedom was identified as a condition for\ndemocratic society. Accordingly, Hook was to formulate his criticism\nof Soviet society during the period of the cold war by reference to\nthe violations of cultural freedom within the Soviet Empire.\n\nAt the same time, Hook\u2019s interpretation of a free and democratic\nsociety was consistent with the recognition that such a society could\nset limits to freedom of expression. Conceptually, this recognition of\nthe limits of freedom related to pragmatic pluralism. Its\nphilosophical justification rested on the belief that no single value\nwas absolute and that every value was justified only as a result of a\nprocess of mediation, compromise, or balance with other values. Hook\nappreciated the pluralistic character of liberty as recognized in the\nlater terminology of John Austin, according to which the\n\u201ccorrelative opposites\u201d of the term \u201cliberty\u201d\nare not only such terms as \u201cslavery,\u201d\n\u201crepression\u201d and \u201ccoercion,\u201d but also such\nterms as \u201csecurity,\u201d \u201corder,\u201d\n\u201cself-restraint\u201d and \u201claw.\u201d The significance\nof this recognition of the duality of opposites of the concept of\nliberty is that it points to different contexts in the application of\nliberty. When \u201cliberty\u201d is opposed to\n\u201cslavery\u201d or \u201ctyranny,\u201d the realization of\nliberty involves the abolition of slavery or tyranny. When\n\u201cliberty\u201d is opposed to \u201csecurity\u201d or\n\u201corder,\u201d the realization of liberty involves a balance of\nvalues between liberty and security or order.\n\nHook\u2019s formulation of the issue of the limits of freedom in a\ndemocracy could be traced back to his sensitivity to his observation\nof the rise of Nazism in Germany during his residency in that country\nin the late 1920s. The anti-Nazi neo-Kantian philosopher, Leonard\nNelson, had pointed out at that time that totalitarian movements,\nparticularly the National Workers Socialist movement, confronted\ndemocracy with a potentially fatal dilemma: if the democratic system\nwere to outlaw or prohibit the National Workers Socialist Party from\nparticipation in political elections, it would be taking a significant\nstep toward the destruction of democracy by excluding a party which\nhad a mass following. If the democratic system were to fail to outlaw\nor prohibit the National Workers Socialist Party from participation in\nnational electoral politics, however, it would be taking a potentially\neven more significant step toward the destruction of democracy. A\nsingle electoral victory of the National Workers Socialist Party, no\nmatter by how small a margin, would result in the abolition of other\npolitical freedoms or in the termination of subsequent elections, as\nin the standard refrain of democracies that have committed suicide:\n\u201cone person, one vote \u2013 one election.\u201d Thus,\nNelson\u2019s dilemma recognized a possibly fatal flaw in democracy\nonce a significant pro-totalitarian or anti-democratic party had\nachieved a degree of popular support.\n\nHook\u2019s understanding of the dilemma led him to the belief that\nit was legitimate for a democratic system to take steps to constrain\nthe influence of anti-democratic or totalitarian groups or parties\nwithin a democratic society. In the United States, the question of the\nright of the American Fascist Party or the American Communist Party to\nparticipate in electoral politics did not rise to the level of\npolitical controversy, probably because of the lack of popular support\nfor these parties. The issue was drawn, however, over the legitimacy\nof excluding members or advocates of such parties from positions which\ninvolved access to national security decisions as well as their\nexclusion from positions of major influence in the cultural sphere.\nHook sought to resolve this dilemma in a controversial book titled\nHeresy, Yes \u2013 Conspiracy, No. The line that Hook sought\nto draw was the granting of full cultural and political freedom to any\nheretical anti-democratic views. At the same time, if holders of such\nviews were organized as a disciplined cadre which could represent a\nthreat to national security or as a doctrinally controlled movement\nwhich could exercise coercive influence in a free marketplace of\nideas, then the activities of such groups could be limited. Critics\ncharged that in developing the thesis of Heresy, Yes \u2013\nConspiracy, No, Hook was in effect permitting the exclusion of\nCommunist Party members or \u201cfellow travelers\u201d from holding\njobs in universities or from holding positions of power or influence\nin cultural activities like films and theater. In Hook\u2019s\ndefense, the record would show that Hook was involved in the\nformulation of a thesis within the theory of democracy about the\nlegitimacy of the line to be drawn in defense of democracy, rather\nthan the application of this thesis to individual cases. Thus, Hook\ndid not seek to resolve the question of what kind of evidence would\nconstitute participation in a conspiracy as between such diverse\nconsiderations as the fact of membership in a political party, the\ncriterion of \u201cadvocacy\u201d for policies that were considered\nas \u201csubversive,\u201d indoctrination along lines laid down and\nenforced by a leadership cadre, or participation in an espionage\nring.\n\nHeresy, Yes \u2013 Conspiracy, No represented, from\nHook\u2019s perspective, a contribution to the defense of democracy\nand cultural freedom in an environment in which both democracy and\ncultural freedom were under attack from the Soviet Union. As\npreviously mentioned, Hook was a leading member of the editorial board\nof Partisan Review. During the 1950s, this journal was the\npremier anti-communist publication in the United States. The leading\nintellectual figures who represented opposition to the policies of\nJoseph Stalin and the leaders of the Soviet Union in their internal\npolicies and to the international policies of the Soviet Union wrote\non the nature of Soviet society and policy for this journal. These\nfigures included such leading writers from Western Europe as George\nOrwell, Andr\u00e9 Malreaux, and Ignazio Silone as well as the\nAmerican black novelist Richard Wright and such intellectual\nluminaries from Eastern Europe as Czeslaw Milosz, Arthur Koestler and\nManes Sperber. As the leading journal within the anti-communist\nspectrum, Partisan Review was confronted by the moral issue\nof McCarthyism. The activities of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the late\n1940s and early 1950s represented a problem for anti-communism in two\ndimensions. On the one hand, from the public relations perspective,\nMcCarthy\u2019s inaccuracies and exaggerations provided a sword to\nthe critics of anti-communism. One quip of the period that represented\nthis aspect was the thesis of liberal opponents of McCarthy that they\nwere \u201canti-anti-communists.\u201d More significantly, on\nsubstantive moral grounds, as Hook recognized, it was not tenable for\nan intellectual movement that charged Stalinism with framing its\nenemies in purges, trials and rehabilitation camps to be complicit\nwith a movement which would falsely accuse persons of being communist\nagents or members of the Communist Party. The result was the decision\nby a majority of the editorial board of Partisan Review,\nincluding Sidney Hook, to condemn McCarthyism and to lend its support\nto the opponents of Senator McCarthy. In terms of the contemporaneous\nmoral context, it is relevant to note that Professor James Burnham,\nwho was a colleague of Sidney Hook at the Department of Philosophy at\nNew York University, disagreed with this position and resigned from\nthe editorial board of Partisan Review. Burnham\u2019s\nargument was that it was a fallacy of moral equivalence to compare the\nenormity of immoral evil carried out by communism in its attack on\ndemocratic institutions with the moral flaws that had taken place\nduring Senator McCarthy\u2019s strategy and tactics of seeking to\nuncover Soviet agents who were guilty of espionage in the U.S. State\nDepartment or Government.\n\nThe theoretical background of Heresy, Yes \u2013 Conspiracy,\nNo was not limited to the analysis of the specific means that a\ndemocratic society could use to protect itself from internal\ntotalitarian movements without impinging upon legitimate civil\nliberties, but involved the general conception of the absolute status\nof the right of liberty and the legitimacy of constraints upon\nfreedom. In a subsequent work titled The Paradoxes of\nFreedom, Hook confronted the Jeffersonian theme of a right to\nliberty as an absolute and inalienable right. As a pragmatist, Hook\nargued that moral rights, like legal rights, could not be absolute,\nwhether grounded in God or Nature. Rather, Hook sought to show how the\nlanguage of rights presupposed obligations of other persons to protect\na right and that these obligations to protect the rights of the\nindividual person were derived from shared human interests in social\nlife. It followed that although rights for Hook could not be reduced\nto utilities, preferences or expressions of emotive attitude, all\nrights, including the right to liberty, were defeasible by other\nvalues or interests. Thus, a right to liberty could be overridden by\nthe need for a society to protect itself. This is evident when a\nperson\u2019s right to liberty is denied and he is imprisoned after\ncommitting a crime. The logic of the defeasibility of absolute rights,\nhowever, would also imply that the right of a citizen to hold a\nnational security clearance or a job with a nation\u2019s\nintelligence agency could be limited by reference to the value of\nnational security. Hook\u2019s practical position was buttressed by\nhis theoretical account of the pragmatic nature of the concept of\nliberty. The pragmatic account of liberty, however, was not a\nrationalization for Hook\u2019s political advocacy. The\ninterpretation of natural rights as admitting of limitations upon\nrights by reference to other values is a constant aspect of the\napproach that pragmatism offered to the traditions of absolutism and\nimprescriptability on natural or human rights.\n\nHook\u2019s theoretical interest in the issue of cultural freedom was\novershadowed by his involvement in the forum of public policy.\nHook\u2019s rejection of Marxism led him to support the value of\npolitical freedom as an essential condition for a democratic society,\nwhether in capitalist or socialist economic frameworks. The\nimplication of this theoretical analysis, for Hook, was his support of\nthe American commitment to political and cultural freedom as opposed\nto what he saw as a Soviet or communist commitment against political\nfreedom in furthering the growth of a totalitarian state. For that\nreason, therefore, Hook could be counted as a \u201cCold\nWarrior\u201d in support of the West during the Cold War. It should\nbe noted that in the political terminology of the period, the\nidentification of Hook as a Cold Warrior by persons who favored the\nuse of that term did not mean a supporter of the Western democratic\nalliance or what was termed \u201cthe free world\u201d against\ntotalitarianism. Rather, \u201cCold Warrior\u201d was used\npejoratively to indicate a person who sought to influence American\npolicy so that it would pursue a containment or adversarial strategy\ntoward the Soviet Union as a corollary to an ideological and paranoiac\ninterpretation of the Soviet Union as an aggressive and expansionist\nempire. Thus, critics of Cold Warriors and the Cold War saw the Soviet\nUnion as an alternative, socialist system with which a realistic,\nmoderate and non-ideological Western policy should pursue\n\u201cconstructive engagements\u201d toward compromise, cooperation\nand mutual respect.\n\nIn his support for the idea of cultural freedom, Hook was a founder of\nthe American Committee for Cultural Freedom. This Committee organized\na number of symposia on issues related to cultural freedom among a\nwide intellectual community, including such figures as W.H. Auden and\nArthur Schlesinger, Jr. Much more significant in political terms was\nthe extension of this kind of activity to international forums,\nparticularly in Western Europe. Among Western European intellectuals\nin the early 1950s, the issue of their choice among the options of\nEuropean neutralism, ideological support for the Soviet Union or\nsupport for the United States was at the center of political debate.\nThe Congress of Cultural Freedom conference that Hook helped organize\nin Paris at that time represented a rallying base for criticism of the\nSoviet Union and for support of a philosophy of liberal democracy that\nwas compatible with the American foreign policy interest. One of the\nmore remarkable results of the activities of the Congress of Cultural\nFreedom was the founding of a number of cultural journals modeled on\nPartisan Review. These journals included Encounter\nin England, Les Preuves in France and Der Monat in\nGermany, as well as similar periodicals in India and Australia. The\nhigh cultural standards adopted by these journals led to their\nbecoming vanguard publications in their own national cultures, so that\ntheir advocacy of the anti-communist message was transcended by their\nliterary achievement. The continued exposure of the abuses of human\nrights and democratic values in the Soviet Union and its satellites\nremained a constant theme even as they were in the forefront of\nliterary and artistic culture and provided independent and open forums\nfor the discussion of major questions of economic development and\nsocial policy.\n\nConsequently, it was a source of embarrassment when the revelation\nbroke that the CIA had helped finance the activities of the Congress\nof Cultural Freedom and of these publications. Inferentially, Hook\nbelieved that the funding source did not corrupt the integrity of\nthese publications or taint their legitimacy as forums of critical\ninquiry. From the other direction, there was surprise that the CIA was\nprepared to fund publications that had been openly critical of many\naspects of American foreign policy and domestic affairs.\nInterestingly, the acronym in the bureaucratic files of the CIA that\nreferred to the funding of this project was \u201cNCL,\u201d that\nis, the non-communist left. Hook believed that it represented a degree\nof prudential wisdom by the United States government to be willing to\nsupport a non-capitalist, anti-communist cultural enterprise that was\nnot necessarily faithful to the line projected in American foreign\npolicy, since it had developed a significant body of criticism against\nboth the theory and the practice of totalitarian communism.\n\nThroughout this period, Hook\u2019s political views could be\nidentified as \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d\n\nOne significant evidence of the transition of Hook\u2019s thought on\neconomic issues is available in his early encounter with the writings\nof Friedrich von Hayek, the economist of the Austrian school which had\ndeveloped the thesis that democratic socialism was incoherent from\nboth economic and political perspectives. Hook wrote a review of\nHayek\u2019s Road to Serfdom which confirms the shift from\nhis earlier view on Marxism and socialism. Far from asserting his\nearlier thesis that the achievement of political democracy require\nsocialism or, at any rate, a greater degree of economic democracy in\nthe form of lessened concentration of economic power in the capitalist\nclass, Hook advanced the criticism that Hayek\u2019s thesis\nparalleled in a significant sense the fallacious Marxist thesis of\neconomic determinism.\n\nHayek had argued, according to Hook, that socialist societies\nrepresented a state concentration of economic power which had a\npotential for totalitarianism that would be actualized over the\nlong-run. For Hayek, the reverse also held, namely that free-market\nsocieties required the rule of law and constraints upon the exercise\nof monopolistic or arbitrary power so that free market economies would\nlead to the establishment of democratic institutions, again, over the\nlong-run.\n\nHook\u2019s counter-thesis was the independence of political\nstructures and economic systems. According to Hook, authoritarian or\ntyrannical regimes have been established in countries in which both\ncapitalist as well as socialist economic institutions have prevailed.\nSimilarly, for Hook, there would be no bar to the realization of\ndemocracy in either a society that had free markets or in a society in\nwhich government owned or controlled the economic means of\nproduction.\n\nIn the decades since The Road to Serfdom was published, there\nhas been significant evidence regarding the close relationship between\nthe concentration of economic power and political power, particularly\nin many of the developing countries. At the same time, it could be\nargued that neither Hayek\u2019s thesis nor Hook\u2019s\ncounter-thesis has been definitively proven. The democratic and\nsocialist states of Western Europe could represent a refutation of\nHayek\u2019s thesis. The Hayek rebuttal, however, could point to the\ndegree in which free markets operate in European societies alongside\nthe governmental sector. The new phenomenon of one-party political\ndictatorships that embrace and encourage free-market economics in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China or Vietnam would also suggest a\nrefutation of Hayek\u2019s close connection between free societies\nand free market economics. The Hayek rebuttal would be that the\nnecessity for the rule of law as well as for greater freedom of\nmovement of persons and goods in these developing economies have\nalready limited to a degree the exercise of totalitarian power and\narbitrary rule. Consequently, the thesis remains that the potential\nfor change in the direction of liberal and democratic society is built\ninto the continuing function of free markets even in these\nlong-standing one-party dictatorial states.\n\nSubsequently, Hook\u2019s own views on economics underwent\nsignificant change. To a degree, this reflected his move from New York\nUniversity, where he had been a professor of philosophy for four\ndecades, to the Hoover Institution in California. At the Hoover\nInstitution, Hook was closely involved with a number of the leading\ntheoreticians of the economics of free-market societies. Although\nthere was a shift in Hook\u2019s approach to economic theory, the\ngeneral change in his views on issues of political philosophy are not\nattributable to theoretical economics but to other social, political\nand cultural factors in the United States.\n\nThe legitimacy of the attribution of Hook as a conservative in his\nlater views in political philosophy derives from his writings and\nactivities across the entire gamut of social policy questions. To\nHook\u2019s long-standing opposition to the Left on foreign policy\nissues that had stemmed from his major commitment to anti-communism,\nthere was added his stance against major positions of the left wing of\nthe American political spectrum on domestic issues, particularly after\nthe self-identified revolutionary activities of the New Left in the\nlate 1960s.\n\nAs a response to campus turmoil of the late 1960s, Hook founded an\norganization called University Centers for Rational Alternatives.\nThrough this organization, Hook aimed to advance his critical\nrejection of radical efforts to transform the American university and\neducational system. The newsletter of that organization, titled\nMeasure, represented Hook\u2019s belief in a balance between\nthe traditional practices of the American university and the need for\nreform based on critical method and rational criticism.\n\nThe range of Hook\u2019s political writings was extended broadly in\nhis contributions to Measure. The issues that had dominated\nHook\u2019s criticism of totalitarianism, as well as his criticism of\naspects of American liberalism through the 1950s had revolved around\nthe pole of communism versus anti-communism. The emergence of the New\nLeft in 1968 moved Hook\u2019s application of what he believed was\nhis pragmatic commitment to free inquiry from its previous emphasis on\nthe reform of institutional practice toward the emphasis, expressed in\nMeasure, on the balance between continuity and change.\nConsequently, in the spectrum of political philosophical thought Hook\nhad moved from the liberal wing, in which the priority had been\nidentified as the need to critically evaluate the flaws and faults of\nAmerican institutional practices in order to reform or transform them,\nto the conservative wing, in which the priority was identified as the\nneed to protect and sustain the strengths and values that were\ninherent in American institutional practices. Hook\u2019s writings\nand positions became linked to American political conservatism on a\nrange of issues from educational curriculum through affirmative action\nto constitutional questions of the limits of executive privilege and\njudicial authority.\n\nThe issues that were discussed most frequently by Hook in\nMeasure related to American education, which, as previously\nnoted, had been an enduring focus of his interests from the outset of\nhis career. Hook\u2019s changed approach to education was developed\nin his essay, Philosophy of the Curriculum, in 1976. In that\nessay, Hook sought to formulate the indispensable subject matter for a\ncurriculum in higher education. While Hook maintained his previous\nthesis that the development of critical thinking was crucial to any\nvaluable educational experience, his formulation of the curricular\nsubject matter reveals the degree to which the critical method is\nintertwined with the learning of appropriate subject matter, whether\nin the humanities or the sciences. Further, Hook defended liberal\neducation as requiring the reading and study of the Western canon even\nif such a requirement goes against perceived student needs and the\nexpression of student preferences, or violates some proposed criterion\nof social relevance. Thus, without reneging on his earlier criticism\nin Education for Modern Man of any educational philosophy\nthat assumed a fixed human nature, Hook recognized the legitimate role\nof a liberal education as the initiation of every human being into the\ncultural traditions of his society. Such initiation into a tradition\nwas compatible with the development of a critical method and approach.\nThe idea that the classroom was a community of free inquiry remained a\ncentral feature of Hook\u2019s philosophy of education. At the same\ntime, the identification of the classroom as a community of free\ninquiry was no longer directed against academic traditionalism in its\ncurricular implications such as the tradition of reading the greatest\nworks of the humanities or the classic texts of political and social\nthought. Rather, it was directed against the classroom as a community\nof faith or a forum for political advocacy. Thus, the growing\ncurricular practice of \u201ccultural studies\u201d of\n\u201cdesignated groups of victims\u201d represented the\ntransformation of the classroom into a community of shared substantive\nvalues with a political agenda rather than a community of inquiry with\na shared critical method. To the degree to which multiculturalism did\nnot represent the study of the languages and texts of other cultures\nbut represented a species of political commitment to designated\ndeprived cultural groups, it would entail, for Hook, an unjustified\nmetamorphosis of the university from a community of free inquiry into\na community of political faith and advocacy.\n\nEducational issues were intertwined with broader issues of American\nsociety. The issue of affirmative action for college admissions, for\nexample, related to the social issue of the nature of American\ndemocratic pluralism. Hook supported a conception of American\ndemocracy as a society that had been built upon individual rights and\nequality before the law, where greater equality was to be realized by\nvirtue of the fact that the United States was a society of multiple\nopportunities with differing patterns for upward mobility. In\ncontrast, Hook perceived affirmative action, with its corollary of\nquotas assigned to designated groups as a conception of American\ndemocracy as a system of group rights, where greater equality was to\nbe realized by distributive measures. For Hook, rights were ascribed\nto the individual and not to individuals as members of majority or\nminority groups. Consequently, discrimination on grounds of race was\nillegitimate, whether it was designed as an expression of majority\nprejudice against a minority or as a benign instrument of\nrectificatory justice. Accordingly, for Hook, programs of affirmative\naction could be justified if they functioned to help a deprived\nindividual student overcome deficiencies in his educational background\nor to eliminate any bars to opportunity that had been erected by\ndiscriminatory laws or practices. Programs of affirmative action,\nhowever, that resulted in quotas for minority group participation\ninvolved discrimination against the rights of other individuals. Since\neach individual was entitled to equality before the law and equality\nof rights, no individual was entitled, on grounds of membership in an\nhistorically deprived group or racial or ethnic minority, to\nadvantages that violate equality of rights and justify discrimination\nagainst other individuals on racial or ethnic ground. While the social\nideal of overcoming economic inequality was legitimate, the means for\nits realization could not involve replacing individual rights with\ngroup rights or justifying discrimination against individuals who were\nconsidered equal before the law. Hook took note of the great progress\ntoward equality that had taken place in American society from the turn\nof the century through the 1980s. Hook expressed confidence in the\ncapacities of a democratic society to overcome inequalities in\neconomic distribution and in social participation of ethnic minorities\nwithout transforming the legal structure of the American system that\nhad prevailed through those decades. As a lifelong supporter of John\nDewey, Hook believed that democratic society, if it embodied the\ncritical method, would be capable of progressive improvement.\n\nIn light of this Deweyan optimism, it is significant that Hook took as\nthe subject of his Presidential Address for the American Philosophical\nAssociation the question of whether pragmatism had an appropriately\n\u201ctragic sense of life.\u201d Hook sought to counter the charge\nthat the meliorism and optimism of pragmatism represented a failure to\nunderstand the tragic situation that is an inevitable part of the\nhuman condition. Hook had argued that Deweyan pragmatism did not\nrepresent an excessively optimistic faith in human perfectibility, on\nthe model of Condorc\u00e9, and distanced itself from a logically\ndialectical faith in the inevitable historical progress along the\nlines of Hegel or Marx. Hook and the pragmatic philosophy recognized\nthat there have been innumerable sites of human failure,\nself-destructive action and tragic defeat in history. Hook recognized\nthe empirical phenomena of historical evil while believing that a\nphilosophical or theological emphasis upon these phenomena as\nrepresenting the essence of mankind or determining with historical\ninevitability the end of civilization could be identified as a\n\u201cfailure of nerve\u201d which went beyond the required\nacceptance of the facts about the human condition. Rather,\nHook\u2019s thesis in his presidential lecture was that it was\nnecessary to appreciate those enduring features of the human condition\nthat rendered utopian thought untenable and incoherent even as they\nmade possible progress through scientific method and an increase in\nhuman freedom that could occur at any particular time and place.\n\nAccordingly, Hook\u2019s conclusion recognized the recurrence of\ntragedy throughout human history and throughout the careers of\nindividuals. Hook argued that this recognition of a tragic sense was\ncompatible with the humanistic naturalism that Deweyan pragmatism had\nfostered. The tragic sense of this pragmatic naturalism did not\nrequire the acceptance of the inevitability of the triumph of fateful\n\u201cNecessity\u201d on the model of Greek tragedy or within the\nframework of an Ionian metaphysical perspective in which human\nachievement is unavoidably dwarfed and overwhelmed by the immense\nmagnitudes of natural phenomena. Similarly, the tragic sense of\npragmatic naturalism did not require the acceptance of the\ninevitability of human self-destruction because of the flawed\nconstitution of human nature, as in the religious metaphors of\noriginal sin or the Freudian metaphor of the \u201cdeath\ninstinct.\u201d So pragmatic naturalism could sustain the recognition\nof a tragic sense while retaining the Deweyan optimistic realism that\nhuman nature, interacting with the environing processes of Nature,\ncould survive and develop a free society of free human beings, with\nthe use of human reason and the methods of the sciences.\n",
