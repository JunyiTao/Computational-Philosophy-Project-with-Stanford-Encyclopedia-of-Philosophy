    "main_text": "Khayyam in the West || The Impact of Khayyam on Western Literary and Philosophical Circles\n6. Conclusion \nIn the foregoing discussion, we have seen that Umar Khayyam was a philosopher-sage (h\u0323ak\u012bm) and a spiritual-pragmatist whose Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t should be seen as a philosophical commentary on the human condition. The salient features of Umar Khayyam\u2019s pioneering work in various branches of mathematics were also discussed. Khayyam\u2019s mathematical genius not only produced the most accurate calendar to date, but the issues he treated remained pertinent up until the modern period.\nFor Khayyam, there are two discourses, each of which pertains to one dimension of human existence: philosophical and poetic. Philosophically, Khayyam defended rationalism against the rise of orthodoxy and made an attempt to revive the spirit of rationalism which was so prevalent in the first four centuries in Islam. Poetically, Khayyam represents a voice of protest against what he regards to be a fundamentally unjust world. Many people found in him a voice they needed to hear, and centuries after he had died, his works became a venue for those who were experiencing the same trials and tribulations as Khayyam had.\n",
