    "main_text": "\n\nChemistry is the study of the structure and transformation of matter.\nWhen Aristotle wrote the first systematic treatises on chemistry in\nthe 4th century BCE, his conceptual grasp of the nature of\nmatter was tailored to accommodate a relatively simple range of\nobservable phenomena. In the 21st century, chemistry has\nbecome the largest scientific discipline, producing over half a\nmillion publications a year ranging from direct empirical\ninvestigations to substantial theoretical work. However, the\nspecialized interest in the conceptual issues arising in chemistry,\nhereafter Philosophy of Chemistry, is a relatively recent\naddition to philosophy of science.\n\nPhilosophy of chemistry has two major parts. In the first, conceptual\nissues arising within chemistry are carefully articulated and\nanalyzed. Such questions which are internal to chemistry include the\nnature of substance, atomism, the chemical bond, and synthesis. In the\nsecond, traditional topics in philosophy of science such as realism,\nreduction, explanation, confirmation, and modeling are taken up within\nthe context of chemistry.\n",
