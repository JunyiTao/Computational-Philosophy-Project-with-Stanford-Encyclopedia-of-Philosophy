    "main_text": "Logic || Further Applications of the Method of Idea-Variation\n3.9 Further Applications of the Method of Idea-Variation\n\nBeyond the usage of the method of idea-variation for his truly\npioneering definitions of logical truth and logical consequence and\nrelated concepts (such as the concepts of satisfiability and\ncompatibility), Bolzano made use of this method also for a series of\nother purposes, above all in his development of the theory of\nprobability (WL II, 77\u201382, 171\u2013191, 509\u2013514, WL III,\n136\u2013138, 263\u2013288, 559\u2013568, RW II, 39\u201349,\n57\u201361, 66\u201371). Bolzano\u2019s theory of probability is\nbased on his distinction of different degrees of validity of a\nproposition \\(s\\) with respect to a sequence \\(i\\) of ideas. This\ndegree of validity of s with respect to i is representable as\na fractional number \\(\\bfrac{m}{n}\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of all\npossible variants of \\(s\\) with respect to \\(i\\) and \\(m\\) is the\nnumber of true variants of \\(s\\) with respect to \\(i\\). If all\nvariants of \\(s\\) with respect to \\(i\\) with non-empty subject ideas\nare true, \\(m = n\\) and \\(\\bfrac{m}{n} = 1\\), i.e., \\(s\\) is\nuniversally valid with respect to \\(i\\); if all variants are false,\n\\(m = 0\\) and \\(\\bfrac{m}{n} = 0\\), i.e., \\(s\\) is universally\ncontravalid with respect to \\(i\\) (WL II, 81 f.). The logical\ndegree of validity of s is thus the degree of validity of \\(s\\)\nwith respect to \\(i^s\\), i.e., with respect to a certain sequence of\nall simple extra-logical ideas contained in \\(s\\). \n\nIn order to be able to apply these notions in a useful way, we have to\nexplain how to count the variants of a proposition, since for each\nvariant of a proposition (as for each proposition in general) there\nare infinitely many others that are logically equivalent to it (e.g.,\ndue to replacing a part \\([b]\\) of the proposition by [non-non-\\(b]\\),\n[non-non-non-non-\\(b]\\) etc.). If we would count all of them, the\nresulting fractional number would not be very informative. Bolzano was\ncompletely aware of this problem (WL II, 79 f.), and he was very\ncreative in developing methods for solving it as well as many other\npuzzling problems.\n\nBolzano is not content with this concept of probability\nsimpliciter but rather continues to develop an even more\nimportant relative concept of probability. What is at stake\nhere is the probability of a proposition \\(s\\) relative to a set\n\\(\\sigma\\) of propositions with respect to a sequence \\(i\\) of ideas,\nand in particular with respect to \\(i^{\\sigma \\cup \\{s\\}}\\), i.e., the\nsequence of all simple extra-logical ideas contained in \\(s\\) or\n\\(\\sigma\\). Its degree can again be represented by a fractional number\n\\(0 \\le^m /_n \\le 1\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of cases where\n\\(\\sigma\\) comes out true and \\(m\\) is the number of cases where\n\\(\\sigma \\cup \\{s\\}\\) comes out true (WL II, 171\u2013191; for a\ncareful reconstruction of Bolzano\u2019s theory of probability see\nBerg 1962, 148\u2013150).\n\nIn his Tractatus (5.15) Ludwig Wittgenstein came so close to\nBolzano\u2019s definition of probability that Georg Henrik von Wright\nfelt it to be appropriate \u201cto speak of one definition\nof probability here and call it the Bolzano-Wittgenstein\ndefinition\u201d (Wright 1982, 144 f.).\n\nBolzano\u2019s work on probability was not only of purely theoretical\ninterest to him but also had interesting practical consequences with\nrespect to problems in the philosophy of science (cf. section 4) and\nin particular also with respect to religious questions (cf. section\n8).\n",
