    "main_text": "The problem of theoretical terms\n3. The problem of theoretical terms\n\nA physical theory \\(T\\) consists, among other things, of a group of\nlaws which are formulated in terms of certain concepts. But an\napparent circularity arises when one considers how the laws of \\(T\\)\nand the concepts acquire their content, because each seems to acquire\ncontent from the other \u2014 the laws of \\(T\\) acquire their content\nfrom the concepts used in the formulation of the laws, while the\nconcepts are often \u201cintroduced\u201d or \u201cdefined\u201d\nby the group of laws as a whole. To be sure, if the concepts can be\nintroduced independently of the theory \\(T\\), the circularity does not\nappear. But typically every physical theory \\(T\\) requires some new\nconcepts which cannot be defined without using \\(T\\) (we call the\nlatter \u201c\\(T\\)-theoretical concepts\u201d). Is the apparent\ncircularity concerning the laws and the T-theoretical concepts a\nproblem? Some examples will help us assess the threat.\n",
