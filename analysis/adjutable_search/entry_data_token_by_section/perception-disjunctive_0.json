Introduction\n\n\nDisjunctivists and their opponents agree that veridical perceptions,\nillusions and hallucinations have something in common, in so far as\nthey agree that such mental events should be grouped together as being\nperceptual experiences. They also agree that there are differences to\nbe marked between them, hence the different labels for them. However,\nthey disagree when it comes to specifying what these commonalities and\ndifferences consist in. What distinguishes the disjunctivist theory is\nits rejection of a \u2018common kind claim\u2019\u2014the claim\nthat the conscious perceptual experiences that are involved in cases\nof veridical perception, illusion and hallucination have the same\nnature. If one accepts that the same kind of conscious experience\noccurs in all three cases, then this imposes a constraint on the\naccount one can give of the kind of conscious event that occurs when one\nveridically perceives the world.  Disjunctivists deny that our\naccounts of veridical perception should be constrained in this way. So\nthe disjunctivist view of perceptual experience can be regarded as a\nnegative thesis\u2014the rejection of a common kind claim\u2014that\nis adopted in defence of a positive view of veridical perception.\n\n\nThose who hold a disjunctive theory of perception do not deny that\nit is possible to have a hallucination of an F that is subjectively\nindistinguishible from a veridical perception of an F. That is, they do\nnot deny that it is possible for one to have a hallucination such that\none cannot tell through introspection alone that it is not a veridical\nperception of an F. So associated with the disjunctivist\u2019s\nmetaphysical stance, namely the rejection of the common kind claim, is\nan epistemological proposal that emphasises limitations on a\nsubject\u2019s capacity to tell what kind of experience she is\nundergoing on the basis of introspection alone. For example, J.M.\nHinton, an early proponent of the disjunctive theory,\nacknowledges that both a hallucination of an F and a veridical\nperception of an F can appear, from the inside, to be a veridical\nperception of an F. However, he holds that it is a mistake to assume\nthat this appearance is to be explained by the thesis that these\nexperiences share a common nature that is manifest to one when has the\nexperiences.\n\n\nHinton is generally credited with being the first to demarcate clearly\nthe disjunctivist stance, and the fact that the disjunctive theory of\nperception is so named is due to his way of framing the view. Hinton\n(1967 and 1973) argued that we should understand a statement about how\nthings sensorily appear to a subject to be equivalent to a disjunctive\nstatement that either one is veridically perceiving such and\nsuch or one is suffering an illusion (or hallucination); and\nsuch statements are not to be regarded as making a report about a\ndistinctive mental event or state that is common to these disjoint\nsituations. (For discussion of the historical significance of Hinton,\nsee Snowdon 2008). The disjunctive approach to perceptual experience\nwas later developed by Paul Snowdon (1980\u201381), John McDowell\n(1982), and M.G.F. Martin (2002), among others.\n",
