    "main_text": "(Trans) Gender Trouble || Gender Trouble\n5.1 Gender Trouble\n\n\nButler's work was partly motivated by the desire to answer\nconcerns that queer enactments of gender (as in a butch-femme\nrelationship or in gay male drag) merely replicate traditional\npatriarchal norms. For Butler, such a view presupposes a heterosexual\nbias obscuring the way in which gender is re-worked in queer contexts.\nWhat she has in mind is that in queer subculture gender practices do\nnot always have the same meaning that they do in mainstream cultural\ncontexts. For example, feminine presentation in some queer contexts may\ninvolve a degree of irony not found in mainstream instances of that\nfeminine presentation. To treat queer gender practices as simply\nrepeating or miming non-queer practices without any significant change\nin meaning is to understand all gender practices in a way that assigns\ndominant heterosexual meanings to it.\n\n\nQueer gender performance, far from replicating patriarchal norms,\ncan subvert such norms by exposing their non-natural, imitative\ncharacter (1990, 174\u201380). Sometimes queer gender performance can\ninvolve irony and/or parody through exaggeration. (Good examples of\nthis can be found in early films by John Waters, such as Female\nTrouble). Queer gender can make fun of heterosexual gender\npractices by exaggerating them and parodying them in such ways that\nmake them seem theatrical and contrived. And gay male drag, for Butler,\ncan show that feminine presentation is not the sole property of female\nindividuals. Once it is recognized that such behavior is only\ncontingently assigned to groups of individuals, the very idea that gay\ndrag merely involves imitation of heterosexual women as the original\nassigns a priority to the latter over the former. This prioritization,\nfor Butler, reflects a heterosexual bias. And, so for Butler, feminist\nidentification of all gendered behavior as inherently\nsexist (as, for example, found in Raymond's work) is nothing\nshort of a heterosexist tendency to attach a primacy to heterosexual\ngender performance.\n\n\nButler's account of gender aims to call into question the\npre-existence of a group of individuals (i.e., women, females) prior to\nthe enforcement of gender role. Instead, in Butler's view,\nbiological sex is culturally instituted and in this sense \u201cgender\nall along.\u201d Prima facie this view seems counter-intuitive. One\nway to motivate it is to recognize that contrary to the natural\nattitude about sex (discussed above), human beings cannot always be\nneatly divided into male and female. Indeed, once we recognize various\nfeatures which go into sex determination (chromosomal sex, gonadal sex,\ngenital sex, etc.) we see that sex is not a single, unitary,\neasily-determined feature. Insofar as the natural attitude prevails,\nhowever, individuals act as if the natural attitude were true.\nSex is now understood in terms of a particular attitude which shapes\neveryday social practices. And to the extent that such an attitude\nhelps ground medical practices designed to surgically assign intersex\ninfants to one sex or the other, it appears that sexual dimorphism is\nmedically instituted. Insofar as bodies are made to conform to a\nparticular cultural ideology about sex\u2014an ideology which governs\nsocial practice\u2014it makes some sense to say that biological sex itself\nis, to this degree, \u201cculturally instituted.\u201d\n\n\nIn Butler's view, whenever we discuss the body, we are also\nalways representing it in culturally specific ways. To speak of the\nbiologically sexed body as somehow prior to particular discourses\nabout it is to, in so doing, nonetheless ironically speak about\nit within some particular discourse and hence to represent in\nsome way.  According to Butler, sex is culturally instituted by\nrepresenting the body as the natural container of some inner,\ngendered self.  Sex is understood as the bodily indication that\nconcealed within it is the essence of either a woman or a man. For\nButler, this view is false.  However, just as the natural attitude may\nbe treated as if it were true even though it is not, so, too, bodies\ncan be falsely treated as containers of gendered selves. To the extent\nthat this view is pervasive and regulative of human conduct, one\ncan\u2014in this sense\u2014say that sex is socially\nconstructed.\n\n\nFor Butler, behavioral manifestations of gender are often taken to\nexpress a prior gender identity that is contained within a naturally\nsexed body. Thus, feminine behavior is seen as expressive of an inner\nfeminine core (contained within the body sexed female). On the\ncontrary, in her view, such performances simply serve to generate the\nfiction of a pre-existing gender identity as well as the fiction of the\nsexed body qua natural container of this identity (1990, 178\u20139). This\nis to say: Behavioral manifestations are prior to gender identity and\nsexed body (rather than the other way around). The illusion of a stably\nsexed body, core gender identity, and (hetero) sexual orientation is\nperpetuated through repeated, stylized bodily performances that are\nperformative in the sense that they are productive of the\nfiction of a stable identity, orientation, and sexed body as prior to\nthe gendered behavior (173).\n\n\nThis allows Butler to answer the charge that queer gender\nperformances merely replicate sexist gender role behavior. In her view,\nall gender behavior is imitative in nature. Heterosexual\ngender identity involves an instability that it attempts to cover over:\nWhile it purports to be grounded in a naturally gendered core, it\namounts to nothing more than repeated attempts to imitate past\ninstances of gendered behavior (1990, 185). Thus, there is also a\nsubversive potential of queer drag and camp gender performance, in her\nview, insofar as it can parody and thereby expose this\nconcealed imitative quality (1990, 174\u20136). As a consequence, Butler\nwelcomes the proliferation of queer gender behaviors that re-signify,\nparody, and expose the mechanisms by which the fiction of normative\nheterosexist gender is created (1990, 184\u2013190).\n",
