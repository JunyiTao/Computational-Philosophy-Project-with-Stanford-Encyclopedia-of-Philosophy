One has been legal and\nadministrative as courts, legislatures, and executive departments of\ngovernment have made and applied rules requiring affirmative action.\nThe other has been the path of public debate, where the practice of\npreferential treatment has spawned a vast literature, pro and con.\nOften enough, the two paths have failed to make adequate contact, with\nthe public quarrels not always very securely anchored in any existing\nlegal basis or practice.\n\n\nThe ebb and flow of public controversy over affirmative action can\nbe pictured as two spikes on a line, the first spike representing a\nperiod of passionate debate that began around 1972 and tapered off\nafter 1980, and the second indicating a resurgence of debate in the\n1990s leading up to Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in 2003 and 2016\nupholding certain kinds of affirmative action. The first spike\nencompassed controversy about gender and racial preferences alike. This\nis because in the beginning affirmative action was as much about the\nfactory, the firehouse, and the corporate suite as about the college\ncampus. The second spike represents a quarrel about race and ethnicity.\nThis is because the burning issue at the turn of the twentieth-first\ncentury is about college\n admissions.

    "main_text": "\n1. In the Beginning\n\n\nIn 1972, affirmative action became an inflammatory public issue.\nTrue enough, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already had made something\ncalled \u201caffirmative action\u201d a remedy federal courts could\nimpose on violators of the Act. Likewise, after 1965 federal\ncontractors had been subject to President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Executive\nOrder 11246, requiring them to take \u201caffirmative action\u201d to\nmake sure they were not discriminating. But what did this 1965 mandate\namount to? The Executive Order assigned to the Secretary of Labor the\njob of specifying rules of implementation. In the meantime, as the\nfederal courts were enforcing the Civil Rights Act against\ndiscriminating companies, unions, and other institutions, the\nDepartment of Labor mounted an ad hoc attack on the construction\nindustry by cajoling, threatening, negotiating, and generally\nstrong-arming reluctant construction firms into a series of region-wide\n\u201cplans\u201d in which they committed themselves to numerical\nhiring goals. Through these contractor commitments, the Department\ncould indirectly pressure recalcitrant labor unions, who supplied the\nemployees at job sites.\n\n\nWhile the occasional court case and government initiative made the\nnews and stirred some controversy, affirmative action was pretty far\ndown the list of public excitements until the autumn of 1972, when the\nSecretary of Labor\u2019s Revised Order No. 4, fully implementing the\nExecutive Order, landed on campus by way of directives from the\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare. Its predecessor, Order\nNo. 4, first promulgated in 1970, cast a wide net over American\ninstitutions, both public and private. By extending to all contractors\nthe basic apparatus of the construction industry \u201cplans,\u201d\nthe Order imposed a one-size-fits-all system of \n\u201cunderutilization analyses,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d and\n\u201ctimetables\u201d on hospitals, banks, trucking companies,\nsteel mills, printers, airlines\u2014indeed, on all the scores of\nthousands of institutions, large and small, that did business with the\ngovernment, including a special set of institutions with a\nparticularly voluble and articulate constituency, namely, American\nuniversities.\n\n\nAt first, university administrators and faculty found the rules of\nOrder No. 4 murky but hardly a threat to the established order. The\nnumber of racial and ethnic minorities receiving PhDs each year and\nthus eligible for faculty jobs was tiny. Any mandate to increase their\nrepresentation on campus would require more diligent searches by\nuniversities, to be sure, but searches fated nevertheless largely to\nmirror past results. The 1972 Revised Order, on the other hand, effected a\nchange that punctured any campus complacency: it included women among\nthe \u201cprotected classes\u201d whose\n\u201cunderutilization\u201d demanded the setting of\n\u201cgoals\u201d and \u201ctimetables\u201d for \u201cfull\nutilization\u201d (Graham 1990, 413). Unlike African-Americans and\nHispanics, women were getting PhDs in substantial and growing\nnumbers. If the affirmative action required of federal contractors was\na recipe for \u201cproportional representation,\u201d then Revised\nOrder No. 4 was bound to leave a large footprint on campus. Some among\nthe professoriate exploded in a fury of opposition to the new rules,\nwhile others responded with an equally vehement defense of\nthem.[2]\n\n\nAs it happened, these events coincided with another development,\nnamely the \u201cpublic turn\u201d in philosophy. For several\ndecades Anglo-American philosophy had treated moral and political\nquestions obliquely. On the prevailing view, philosophers were suited\nonly to do \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d\u2014they could lay\nbare, for example, the conceptual architecture of the idea of justice,\nbut they were not competent to suggest political principles,\nconstitutional arrangements, or social policies that actually did\njustice.  Philosophers might do \u201cmeta-ethics\u201d but not\n\u201cnormative ethics.\u201d This viewed collapsed in the 1970s\nunder the weight of two counter-blows. First, John Rawls published in\n1971 A Theory of Justice, an elaborate, elegant, and inspiring\ndefense of a normative theory of justice (Rawls 1971).\nSecond, in the same year Philosophy & Public Affairs,\nwith Princeton University\u2019s impeccable pedigree, began life, a few\nmonths after Florida State\u2019s Social Theory and\nPractice. These journals, along with a re-tooled older\nperiodical, Ethics, became self-conscious platforms for\nsocially and politically engaged philosophical writing, born out of\nthe feeling that in time of war (the Vietnam War) and social tumult\n(the Civil Rights Movement, Women\u2019s Liberation), philosophers ought to\ndo, not simply talk about, ethics.  In 1973, Philosophy &\nPublic Affairs published Thomas Nagel\u2019s \u201cEqual Treatment\nand Compensatory Justice\u201d (Nagel 1973) and Judith Jarvis\nThomson\u2019s \u201cPreferential Hiring\u201d (Thomson 1973), and the\nphilosophical literature on affirmative action burgeoned\n forth.[3]\n\n\nIn contention was the nature of those \u201cgoals\u201d and\n\u201ctimetables\u201d imposed on every contractor by Revised Order\nNo. 4. Weren\u2019t the \u201cgoals\u201d tantamount to\n\u201cquotas,\u201d requiring institutions to use racial or gender\npreferences in their selection processes? Some answered\n\u201cno\u201d (Ezorsky 1977, 86).  Properly understood, affirmative\naction did not require (or even permit) the use of gender or racial\npreferences.  Others said \u201cyes\u201d (Goldman 1976, 182\u20133).\nAffirmative action, if it did not impose preferences outright, at\nleast countenanced them.  Among the yea-sayers, opinion divided\nbetween those who said preferences were morally permissible and those\nwho said they were not.  Within the \u201cmorally permissible\u201d\nset, different writers put forward different justifications.\n2. The Controversy Engaged\n\n\nThe essays by Thomson and Nagel defended the use of preferences but on\ndifferent grounds. Thomson endorsed job preferences for women and\nAfrican-Americans as a form of redress for their past exclusion\nfrom the academy and the workplace. Preferential policies, in her\nview, worked a kind of justice. Nagel, by contrast, argued that\npreferences might work a kind of social good, and without doing\nviolence to justice.  Institutions could for one or another good\nreason properly depart from standard meritocratic selection criteria\nbecause the whole system of tying economic reward to earned\ncredentials was itself indefensible.\n\n\nJustice and desert lay at the heart of subsequent arguments. Several\nwriters took to task Thomson\u2019s argument that preferential hiring\njustifiably makes up for past wrongs. Preferential hiring seen as\nredress looks perverse, they contended, since it benefits\nindividuals (African-Americans and women possessing good educational\ncredentials) least likely harmed by past wrongs while it burdens\nindividuals (younger white male applicants) least likely to be\nresponsible for past wrongs (Simon 1974, 315\u201319; Sher 1975, 162;\nSher 1979, 81\u201382; and Goldman 1976, \n190\u20131).[4]\n Instead of doing justice, contended the critics, preferential\ntreatment violated rights. What rights were at issue? The right of an\napplicant \u201cto equal consideration\u201d (Thomson 1973, 377;\nSimon 1974, 312), the right of the maximally competent to an open\nposition (Goldman 1976, 191; Goldman 1979, 24\u20138), or the right\nof everyone to equal opportunity (Gross 1977a, 382; Gross 1978,\n97). Moreover, according to the critics, preferential treatment\nconfounded desert by severing reward from a \u201cperson\u2019s character,\ntalents, choices and abilities\u201d (Simon 1979, 96), by\n\u201csubordinating merit, conduct, and character to race\u201d\n(Eastland and Bennett 1979, 144), and by disconnecting outcomes from\nactual liability and damage (Gross 1978, 125\u201342).\n\n\nDefenders of preferences were no less quick to enlist justice and\ndesert in their cause. Mary Anne Warren, for example, argued that in a\ncontext of entrenched gender discrimination, gender preferences might\nimprove the \u201coverall fairness\u201d of job selections. Justice\nand individual desert need not be violated.\n\n\nIf individual men\u2019s careers are temporarily set back because\nof\u2026[job preferences given to women], the odds are good that\nthese same men will have benefited in the past and/or will benefit in\nthe future\u2014not necessarily in the job competition, but in some\nways\u2014from sexist discrimination against women. Conversely, if\nindividual women receive apparently unearned bonuses [through\npreferential selection], it is highly likely that these same women will\nhave suffered in the past and/or will suffer in the future\nfrom\u2026sexist attitudes. (Warren 1977, 256)\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, James Rachels defended racial preferences as devices to\nneutralize unearned advantages by whites. Given the pervasiveness of\nracial discrimination, it is likely, he argued, that the superior\ncredentials offered by white applicants do not reflect their greater\neffort, desert, or even ability. Rather, the credentials reflect their\nmere luck at being born white. \u201cSome white\u2026[applicants]\nhave better qualifications\u2026only because they have not had to\ncontend with the obstacles faced by their African-American\ncompetitors\u201d (Rachels 1978, 162).  Rachels was less confident\nthan Warren that preferences worked uniformly accurate\noffsets. Reverse discrimination might do injustice to some whites; yet\nits absence would result in injustices to African-Americans who have\nbeen unfairly handicapped by their lesser advantages.\n\n\nRachels\u2019 diffidence was warranted in light of the counter-responses.\nIf racial and gender preferences for jobs (or college admissions) were\nsupposed to neutralize unfair competitive advantages, they needed to\nbe calibrated to fit the variety of backgrounds aspirants brought to\nany competition for these goods. Simply giving blanket preferences to\nAfrican-Americans or women seemed much too ham-handed an approach if\nthe point was to micro-distribute opportunities fairly (Sher 1975,\n165ff).\n3. Rights and Consistency\n\n\nTo many of its critics, reverse discrimination was simply\nincoherent. When \u201cthe employers and the schools favor\nwomen and blacks,\u201d objected Lisa Newton, they commit the same\ninjustice perpetrated by Jim Crow discrimination. \u201cJust as the\nprevious discrimination did, this reverse discrimination violates the\npublic equality which defines citizenship\u201d (Newton 1973,\n 310).[5]\n\n\nWilliam Bennett and Terry Eastland likewise saw racial preferences\nas in some sense illogical:\n\n\nTo count by race, to use the means of numerical equality to achieve\nthe end of moral equality, is counterproductive, for to count by race\nis to deny the end by virtue of the means. The means of race counting\nwill not, cannot, issue in an end where race does not \n matter (Eastland and Bennett 1979,\n 149).[6]\n\n\n\nWhen Eastland and Bennett alluded to those who favored using race to\nget to a point where race doesn\u2019t count, they had in mind specifically\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s Justice Blackmun who, in the famous 1978\nBakke case (discussed below), put his own view in just those\nsimple terms. For Blackmun, the legitimacy of racial preferences was\nto be measured by how fast using them moves us toward a society where\nrace doesn\u2019t matter (a view developed in subtle detail by the\nphilosopher Richard Wasserstrom in Wasserstrom 1976). While the\ncritics of preferences claimed to find the very idea of using race to\nend racism illogical and incoherent, they also fell back on principle\nto block Blackmun\u2019s instrumental defense should it actually prove both\nreasonable and plausible. \u201cThe moral issue comes in classic\nform,\u201d wrote Carl Cohen. \u201cTerribly important\nobjectives\u2026appear to require impermissible means.\u201d  Cohen asked,\n\u201cmight we not wink at the Constitution this once\u201d and allow\npreferences to do their good work (Cohen 1995, 20)?  Neither he nor\nother critics thought so.  Principle must hold firm. \u201c[I]n the\ndistribution of benefits under the laws all racial\nclassifications are invidious\u201d (Cohen 1995, 52).\n\n\nBut what, exactly, is the principle\u2014constitutional or\nmoral\u2014that always bars the use of race as a means to\n\u201cterribly important objectives\u201d? Alan Goldman did more\nthan anyone in the early debate to formulate and ground a relevant\nprinciple. Using a contractualist framework, he surmised that rational\ncontractors would choose a rule of justice requiring positions to be\nawarded by competence. On its face, this rule would seem to preclude\nfilling positions by reference to factors like race and gender that\nare unrelated to competence. However, Goldman\u2019s\n\u201crule\u201d blocked preferences only under certain empirical\nconditions. Goldman explained the derivation of the rule and its\nconsequent limit this way:\n\n\nThe rule for hiring the most competent was justified as part of a\nright to equal opportunity to succeed through socially productive\neffort, and on grounds of increased welfare for all members of society.\nSince it is justified in relation to a right to equal opportunity, and\nsince the application of the rule may simply compound injustices when\nopportunities are unequal elsewhere in the system, the creation of more\nequal opportunities takes precedence when in conflict with the rule for\nawarding positions. Thus short-run violations of the rule are justified\nto create a more just distribution of benefits by applying the rule\nitself in future years. (Goldman 1979, 164\u2013165).\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, if \u201cterribly important\nobjectives\u201d having to do with\nequalizing opportunities in a system rife with unjust inequalities could in\nfact be furthered by measured and targeted reverse\ndiscrimination, justice wouldn\u2019t stand in the way. Goldman\u2019s principle\ndid not have the adamantine character Cohen and other critics sought\nin a bar to preferences. Where can such an unyielding principle be\nfound? I postpone further examination of this question until I discuss\nthe Bakke case, below, whose split opinions constitute an\nextended debate on the meaning of constitutional equality.\n4. Real-World Affirmative Action: The Workplace\n\n\nThe terms of the popular debate over racial and gender preferences\noften mirrored the arguments philosophers and other academics were\nmaking to each other. Preference\u2019s defenders offered many reasons to\njustify them, reasons having to do with compensatory or distributive\njustice, as well as reasons having to do with social utility (more\nAfrican-Americans in the police department would enable it better to\nserve the community, more female professors in the classroom would\ninspire young women to greater achievements). Critics of preferences\nretorted by pointing to the law. And well they should, since the text\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 seemed a solid anchor even if general\nprinciple proved elusive. Title VI of the Act promised that\n\u201c[n]o person\u2026shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial\n assistance.\u201d[7]\n Title VII similarly prohibited\nall employment practices that discriminated on the basis of race,\ngender, religion, or national\n origin.[8]\n\n\n\nIn face of the plain language of Titles VI and VII, how did\npreferential hiring and promotion ever arise in the first place? How\ncould they be justified legally? Part of the answer lies in the meaning\nof \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d The Civil Rights Act did not define\nthe term. The federal courts had to do that job themselves, and the\ncases before them drove the definition in a particular direction. Many\nfactories and businesses prior to 1964, especially in the South, had\nin place overtly discriminatory policies and rules. For example, a\ncompany\u2019s policy might have openly relegated African-Americans to the\nmaintenance department and channeled whites into operations, sales,\nand management departments, where the pay and opportunities for\nadvancement were far better. If, after passage of the Civil Rights\nAct, the company willingly abandoned its openly segregative policy,\nit could still carry forward the effects of its past segregation\nthrough other already-existing facially neutral rules. For example, a\ncompany policy that required workers to give up their seniority\nin one department if they transferred to another would have locked in\nplace older African-American maintenance workers as effectively as the\ncompany\u2019s own prior segregative rule that made them ineligible to transfer\nat all. Consequently, courts began striking down facially neutral\nrules that carried through the effects of an employer\u2019s past\ndiscrimination, regardless of the original intent or provenance of the\nrules. \u201cIntent\u201d was effectively decoupled from\n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d In 1971, the Supreme Court ratified this\nprocess, giving the following\nconstruction of Title VII:\n\n\nThe objective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII\u2026was\nto achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers\nthat have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white\nemployees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures,\nor tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent,\ncannot be maintained if they operate to \u201cfreeze\u201d the status\nquo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\n\n\nWhat is required by Congress is the removal of artificial,\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers\noperate invidiously to exclude on the basis of racial or other\nimpermissible\n classification.[9]\n\n\n\n\nIn a few short paragraphs the Court advanced from proscribing\npractices that froze in place the effects of a firm\u2019s own past\ndiscrimination to proscribing practices that carried through the\neffects of past discrimination generally. The Court characterized\nstatutory discrimination as any exclusionary practice not necessary\nto an institution\u2019s activities. Since many practices in most\ninstitutions were likely to be exclusionary, rejecting minorities and\nwomen in greater proportion than white men, all institutions needed to\nreassess the full range of their practices to look for, and correct,\ndiscriminatory effect. Against this backdrop, the generic idea of\naffirmative action took form:\n\n\nEach institution should effectively monitor its practices for\nexclusionary effect and revise those that cannot be defended as\n\u201cnecessary\u201d to doing business. In order to make its\nmonitoring and revising effective, an institution ought to predict, as\nbest it can, how many minorities and women it would select over time,\nwere it successfully nondiscriminating. These predictions constitute\nthe institution\u2019s affirmative action \u201cgoals,\u201d and failure\nto meet the goals signals to the institution (and to the government)\nthat it needs to revisit its efforts at eliminating exclusionary \npractices. There may still remain practices that ought to be modified or\n eliminated.[10]\n\n\n\nThe point of such affirmative action: to induce change in institutions\nso that they could comply with the nondiscrimination mandate of the\nCivil Rights Act.\n\n\nHowever, suppose this self-monitoring and revising fell short? In\nearly litigation under the Civil Rights Act, courts concluded that some\ninstitutions, because of their histories of exclusion and\ntheir continuing failure to find qualified women or minorities, needed\nstronger medicine. Courts ordered these institutions to adopt\n\u201cquotas,\u201d to take in specific numbers of formerly excluded\ngroups on the assumption that once these new workers were securely\nlodged in place, the institutions would adapt to this new\n reality.[11]\n\n\nThroughout the 1970s, courts and government enforcement agencies\nextended this idea across the board, requiring a wide range of firms\nand organizations\u2014from AT&T to the Alabama Highway\nPatrol\u2014temporarily to select by the numbers. In all these cases,\nthe use of preferences was tied to a single purpose: to prevent\nongoing and future discrimination. Courts carved out this\njustification for preferences not through caprice but through\nnecessity. They found themselves confronted with a practical dilemma\nthat Congress had never envisaged and thus never addressed when it\nwrote the Civil Rights Act.  The dilemma was this: courts could impose\nracial preferences to change foot-dragging or inept defendants (and by\ndoing so apparently transgress the plain prohibition in Title VII) or\nthey could order less onerous steps they knew would be ineffective,\nthus letting discrimination continue (and by doing so violate their\nduty under Title VII). Reasonably enough, the federal courts resolved\nthis dilemma by appeal to the broad purposes of the Civil Rights Act\nand justified racial preferences where needed to prevent ongoing and\nfuture\n discrimination.[12]\n\n\nThus, preferential affirmative action in the workplace served the\nsame rationale as the non-preferential sort. Its purpose was\nnot to compensate for past wrongs, offset unfair advantage,\nappropriately reward the deserving, or yield a variety\nof social goods; its purpose was to change institutions so they could\ncomply with the nondiscrimination mandate of the Civil Rights Act.\n5. Real-World Affirmative Action: The University\n\n\nIn the 1970s, while campuses were embroiled in debate about how to\nincrease African-Americans and women on the faculty, universities were\nalso putting into effect schemes to increase minority presence within\nthe student body. Very selective universities, in particular, needed\nnew initiatives because only a handful of African-American and\nHispanic high school students possessed test scores and grades good\nenough to make them eligible for admission. These institutions faced a\nchoice: retain their admissions criteria unchanged and live with the\nupshot\u2014hardly any African-Americans and Hispanics on\ncampus\u2014or fiddle with their criteria to get a more substantial\nrepresentation. Most elected the second path.\n\n\nThe Medical School of the University of California at Davis\nexemplified a particularly aggressive approach. It reserved sixteen of\nthe one hundred slots in its entering classes for minorities. In 1973\nand again in 1974, Allan Bakke, a white applicant, was denied\nadmission although his test scores and grades were better than most or\nall of those admitted through the special program. He sued. In 1977,\nhis case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,\nreached the Supreme Court. The Court rendered its decision a year\n later (438 U.S. 265 [1978]).[13]\n\n\nAn attentive reader of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act might have\nthought this case was an easy call. So, too, thought four justices on\nthe Supreme Court, who voted to order Bakke admitted to the Medical\nSchool. Led by Justice Stevens, they saw the racially segregated,\ntwo-track scheme at the Medical School (a recipient of federal funds)\nas a clear violation of the plain language of the Title.\n\n\nFour other members of the Court, led by Justice Brennan, wanted very\nkeenly to save the Medical School program. To find a more attractive\nterrain for doing battle, they made an end-run around Title VI, arguing\nthat, whatever its language, it had no independent meaning itself. It\nmeant in regard to race only what the Constitution\n meant.[14]\n Thus,\ninstead of having to parse the stingy and unyielding language of Title\nVI (\u201cno person shall be subjected to\u2026on the ground of\nrace\u201d), the Brennan group could turn their creative energies to\ninterpreting the broad and vague language of the Fourteenth Amendment\n(\u201cno person shall be denied the equal protection of the\nlaws\u201d), which provided much more wiggle-room for justifying\nracial preferences. The Brennan justices persuaded one other member,\nJustice Powell, to join them in their view of Title VI. But Powell\ndidn\u2019t agree with their view of the Constitution. He argued that the\nMedical School\u2019s policy was unconstitutional and voted that Bakke must\nbe admitted. His vote, added to the four votes of the Stevens group,\nmeant that Allan Bakke won his case and that Powell got to write the\nopinion of the Court. The Brennan strategy didn\u2019t reap the fruit it\nintended.\n\n\nAgainst the leanings of the Brennan group, who would distinguish\nbetween \u201cbenign\u201d and \u201cmalign\u201d uses of race and\ndeal more leniently with the former, Powell insisted that the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s promise of \u201cequal protection of the\nlaw\u201d must mean the same thing for all, black and white alike. To\nparaphrase Powell:\n\n\nThe Constitution can tolerate no \u201ctwo-class\u201d theory of\nequal protection. There is no principled basis for deciding between\nclasses that deserve special judicial attention and those that don\u2019t.\nTo think otherwise would involve the Court in making all kinds of\n\u201cpolitical\u201d decisions it is not competent to make. In\nexpounding the Constitution, the Court\u2019s role is to discern\n\u201cprinciples sufficiently absolute to give them roots throughout\nthe community and continuity over significant periods of time, and to\nlift them above the pragmatic political judgments of a particular time\nand place\u201d (Bakke, at 295\u2013300 [Powell quoting Cox 1976,\n114]).\n\n\n\n\nWhat, then, was the practical meaning of a \u201csufficiently\nabsolute\u201d rendering of the principle of equal protection? It was\nthis: when the decisions of state agents \u2018touch upon an\nindividual\u2019s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial\ndetermination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is\nprecisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental\n interest (Bakke, at 300).\n\n\n\n\nPowell, with this standard in hand, then turned to look at the four\nreasons the Medical School offered for its special program: (i) to\nreduce \u201cthe historic deficit of traditionally disfavored\nminorities in medical schools and the medical profession;\u201d (ii)\nto counter \u201cthe effects of societal discrimination;\u201d (iii)\nto increase \u201cthe number of physicians who will practice in\ncommunities currently underserved;\u201d and (iv) to obtain \u201cthe\neducational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student\n body\u201d (Bakke, at 307). Did any or all of them specify a\ncompelling governmental interest? Did they necessitate use of racial\npreferences?\n\n\nAs to the first reason, Powell dismissed it out of hand.\n\n\nIf [the School\u2019s] purpose is to assure within its student body some\nspecified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race\nor ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as\ninsubstantial but as facially invalid. Preferring members of any one\ngroup for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination\nfor its own sake.\n\n\nAs to the second reason, Powell allowed it more force. A state has a\nlegitimate interest in ameliorating the effects of past discrimination.\nEven so, contended Powell, the Court,\n\n\nhas never approved a classification that aids persons perceived as\nmembers of relatively victimized groups at the expense of other\ninnocent individuals in the absence of judicial, legislative, or\nadministrative findings of constitutional or statutory\n violations (Bakke, at 308).\n\n\n\nAnd the Medical School does not purport to have made, and is in no\nposition to make, such findings. Its broad mission is education, not\nthe formulation of any legislative policy or the adjudication of\nparticular claims of illegality.\u2026[I]solated segments of our vast\ngovernmental structures are not competent to make those decisions, at\nleast in the absence of legislative mandates and legislatively\ndetermined criteria (Bakke, at 309).\n\n\n\nAs to the third reason, Powell found it, too, insufficient. The\nMedical School provided no evidence that the best way it could\ncontribute to increased medical services to underserved communities was\nto employ a racially preferential admissions scheme. Indeed, the\nMedical School provided no evidence that its scheme would result in any\nbenefits at all to such\n communities (Bakke, at 311).\n\n\nThis left the fourth reason. Here Powell found merit. A university\u2019s\ninterest in a diverse student body is legitimated by the First\nAmendment\u2019s implied protection of academic freedom. This constitutional\nhalo makes the interest \u201ccompelling.\u201d However, the Medical\nSchool\u2019s use of a racial and ethnic classification scheme was not\n\u201cprecisely tailored\u201d to effect the School\u2019s interest in\ndiversity, argued Powell.\n\n\nThe diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses\na far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which\nracial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element. [The\nMedical School\u2019s] special admissions program, focused solely on ethnic\ndiversity, would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine\n diversity (Bakke, at 316).\n\n\n\n\nThe diversity which provides an educational atmosphere\n\u201cconducive to speculation, experiment and creation\u201d\nincludes a nearly endless range of experiences, talents, and attributes\nthat students might bring to campus. In reducing diversity to racial\nand ethnic quotas, the Medical School wholly misconceived this\nimportant educational interest.\n\n\nIn sum, although the last of the Medical School\u2019s four reasons\nencompassed a \u201ccompelling governmental interest,\u201d the\nSchool\u2019s special admissions program was not necessary to effect the\ninterest. The special admissions program was unconstitutional. So\nconcluded Justice Powell.\n6. Equality\u2019s Rule\n\n\nThis was a conclusion Justice Brennan tried vigorously to forestall.\nBrennan agreed with Powell that \u201cequal protection\u201d must\nmean the same thing\u2014that is, remain one rule\u2014whether\napplied to blacks or whites. But the same rule applied to different\ncircumstances need not yield the same results. Racial preferences\ncreated for different reasons and producing different outcomes need not\nall be judged in the same harsh, virtually fatal, manner. This point\nwas the crux of Brennan\u2019s defense of the Medical School\u2019s policy.\n\n\nPowell thought there was no principled way to distinguish\n\u201cbenign\u201d from \u201cmalign\u201d discrimination, but\nBrennan insisted there was. He argued that if the Court looked\ncarefully at its past cases striking down Jim Crow laws, it would see\nthe principle at work. What the Court found wrong in Jim Crow was that\nit served no purpose except to mark out and stigmatize one group of\npeople as inferior. The \u201ccardinal principle\u201d operating in\nthe Court\u2019s decisions condemned racial classifications \u201cdrawn on\nthe presumption that one race is inferior to another\u201d or that\n\u201cput the weight of government behind racial hatred and\n separation\u201d (Bakke, at 358 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n Brennan agreed with Powell that no public\nracial classification motivated by racial animus, no classification\nwhose purpose is to stigmatize people with the \u201cbadge of\ninferiority,\u201d could withstand judicial scrutiny. However, the\nMedical School\u2019s policy, even if ill-advised or mistaken, reflected a\npublic purpose far different from that found in Jim Crow. The policy\nought not be treated as though it were cut from the same cloth.\n\n\nBrennan granted that if a state adopted a racial classification for\nthe purpose of humiliating whites, or stigmatizing Allan Bakke as\ninferior and confining him to second-class citizenship, that\nclassification would be as odious as Jim Crow. But the Medical School\u2019s\npolicy had neither this purpose nor this effect. Allan Bakke may have\nbeen upset and resentful at losing out under the special plan, but he\nwasn\u2019t \u201cin any sense stamped as an inferior by the Medical\nSchool\u2019s rejection of him.\u201d Nor did his loss constitute a\n\u201cpervasive injury,\u201d in the sense that wherever he went he\nwould be treated as a \u201csecond-class citizen\u201d because of his\n color (Bakke, at 376 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n\n\nIn short, argued Brennan, the principle expressed in the Equal\nProtection Clause should be viewed as an anti-caste principle,\na principle that uniformly and consistently rejects all public\nlaw whose purpose is to subject people to an inferior and degraded\nstation in life, whether they are black or \n white.[15]\n Of course, given\nthe asymmetrical position of whites and blacks in our country, we are\nnot likely to encounter laws that try to stigmatize whites as an\ninferior caste (much less succeed at it). But this merely shows that a\nprinciple applied to different circumstances produces different\nresults. Because the Medical School\u2019s program sought to undo the\neffects of a racial caste system long-enduring in America, it\nrepresented a purpose of great social importance and should not be\nfound Constitutionally infirm: so maintained\n Brennan (Bakke, at 363 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n\n\nJustice Powell never successfully engaged this way of reading\n\u201cconstitutional equality.\u201d His insistence on clear, plain,\nunitary, absolute principle did not cut against the Brennan view. The\nissue between Powell and Brennan was not the consistency and stringency\nof the principle but its content. If the Constitution says, \u201cThe\nstate cannot deliberately burden someone by race if its purpose is\nto create or maintain caste,\u201d then constitutional law\ndoesn\u2019t block any of the Medical School\u2019s\n justifications.[16]\n\n\nIf we turn away from exegesis of the Constitution, are we likely to\nfind in political theory itself any principle of equality implying that\nevery use of racial preferences in every circumstance\nworks an intolerable injustice? \n\nThe prospects seem dim. Won\u2019t very general notions of equality\nlend themselves to defending affirmative action (and the social\ninclusion it effects) as well as condemning it (and the racial\nnon\u2013neutrality it\n involves)?[17] \nThe challenge here is well-illustrated by\nCarl Cohen\u2019s most recent effort, in a debate with James Sterba,\nto extract a strict prohibition on racial preferences from the\nAristotelian principle that \u201cequals should be treated\nequally\u201d (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 23).  This principle, urges\nCohen, \u201ccertainly entails at least this: It is wrong, always and\neverywhere, to give special advantage to any group simply on the basis\nof physical characteristics that have no relevance to the award given\nor the burden imposed\u201d (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 25).  Whether\nanything interesting follows from this proposition depends on how we\nconstrue \u201crelevance.\u201d Cohen admits that public policy may\nrightly treat some people differently because of their physical\ncharacteristics. For example, the state might offer special assistance\nto the old or disabled. Now, this example suggests that the relevance\nof physical differences is something independent of social policy. Age\nand disability, it seems, are real features of persons and public\npolicy simply tracks them. However, the difference that differences\nmake is not something itself given by nature; it is determined by\npublic purposes. Age and disability are made relevant in this\nmanner\u2014in the one case, by the social purpose of assuring that\npeople do not have to live in poverty when they can no longer work; in\nthe other case, by the social purpose of assuring that people are not\nforeclosed from developing and marketing their talents by impediments\nin the (largely constructed) physical environment. \n\n\nPurpose determines relevancy, and this is true whether or not the\nrelevant differences are physical. If the nation thinks it desirable to change white\ninstitutions so that they are less uniformly white, that purpose links\nskin color to recruitment.\n\n\nBecause the Aristotelian principle by itself doesn\u2019t rule out\nracial preferences (since blacks and whites may be relevantly\ndifferent with respect to certain legitimate public purposes), it is\nnot surprising that Cohen also invokes a substantive conception of\nequality: \u201cAll members of humankind are equally ends in themselves,\nall have equal dignity\u2014and therefore all are entitled to equal\nrespect from the community and its laws\u201d (Cohen and Sterba 2003,\n24). This principle, however, brings us back to the interpretive\nquestions about \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d played out in the\nPowell-Brennan exchange in Bakke. By Justice Brennan\u2019s lights,\nAllen Bakke\u2019s basic dignity was not violated. The Medical\nSchool\u2019s two-track policy that resulted in Bakke\u2019s\nrejection did not, by intent or effect, stigmatize him as inferior, or\nmark him off as a member of a despised caste, or turn him into a\nsecond-class citizen. Bakke arguably had to bear a particular burden\nbecause of his race but the burden was not significantly different\nobjectively from others that public policy might have thrown his\nway. If the Medical School had reserved sixteen of its seats for\napplicants from economically deprived backgrounds, no one would have\nsuggested that it had violated the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Yet under this hypothetical policy Allan Bakke\ncould have lost out as well\u2014lost out to low-income applicants\nwhose college grades and MCAT scores were inferior to his own. Allen\nBakke may have felt aggrieved at losing out under the Medical\nSchool\u2019s policy of racial preferences, but it is not enough to\nshow that those who lose out under some public scheme feel offended or\ndisgruntled. Cohen needs to specify a conception of dignity in which\nbearing unequal burdens on behalf of urgent social ends invariably\namounts to an assault on dignity if the burdens happen to be assigned\nby race. This specification remains unfinished in his work so far.\n\n7. Diversity\u2019s Dominion\n\n\nHow, if it held the Medical School\u2019s policy unconstitutional, did\nJustice Powell\u2019s Bakke opinion become the basis upon which\nuniversities across the land enacted\u2014or\nmaintained\u2014racially preferential admissions policies?\n\n\nIf Powell had concluded with his assessment of the Medical School\u2019s\nfour justifications, Bakke would have left university\naffirmative action in a precarious situation. However, he didn\u2019t stop\nthere. In an earlier ruling on Bakke\u2019s lawsuit, the California Supreme\nCourt had forbidden the Medical School to make any use of race or\nethnicity in its admissions decisions. Powell thought this went too\nfar. Given higher education\u2019s protected interest in\n\u201cdiversity,\u201d and given that a student\u2019s race or ethnicity\nmight add to diversity just in the same way that her age, work\nexperience, family background, special talents, foreign language\nfluency, athletic prowess, military service, and unusual\naccomplishments might, Powell vacated that portion of the California\nSupreme Court\u2019s order.\n\n\nThen he added some dicta for guidance. If universities want to\nunderstand diversity and the role that race and ethnicity might play in\nachieving it, they should look to Harvard, proposed Powell, and he\nappended to his opinion a long statement of Harvard\u2019s affirmative action program.\nIn such a program, Powell contended, racial or ethnic background\nmight\n\n\nbe deemed a \u201cplus\u201d in a particular applicant\u2019s file, yet\nit does not insulate the individual from comparison with all other\ncandidates for the available seats.\u2026This kind of program treats\neach applicant as an individual in the admissions process. The\napplicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate\nreceiving a \u201cplus\u201d on the basis of ethnic background will\nnot have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply\nbecause he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. It would\nmean only that his combined qualifications\u2026did not outweigh\nthose of the other applicant. His qualifications would have been\nweighed fairly and competitively, and he would have had no basis to\ncomplain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth\n Amendment (Bakke, at 318, 319).\n\n\n\nIn these off-hand comments, universities saw a green light for pushing\nahead aggressively with their affirmative action programs.  Justice\nPowell\u2019s basic holding could not have been plainer: any system like\nthe Medical School\u2019s that assessed applications along two different\ntracks defined by race or that used numerical racial quotas must fail\nconstitutional muster. Yet by the mid-1980s universities across the\nland had in place systems of admissions and scholarships that\nexhibited one or both of these features. When the University of\nMaryland\u2019s Banneker scholarships\u2014awarded only to\nAfrican-American students\u2014were held in violation of the\nConstitution in 1994, the house of cards forming university\naffirmative action began to\n fall.[18]\n In 1996, the Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit struck down the University of Texas Law School\u2019s two-track\nadmissions program.\n In 1998, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit struck down a Boston plan\nassigning students to selective high schools by\n race.[19]\n In 2001, two more schools saw their admissions programs invalidated\nby federal courts: the University of\n Georgia[20]\n and the University of Michigan Law\n School.[21]\n In many of these cases, educational\ninstitutions were using schemes that made race something very much more than\nJustice Powell\u2019s \u201cplus\u201d\n factor.[22]\n The Fifth Circuit Court\u2019s ruling in the University of Texas case (Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F 3d 932 [Fifth Circuit, 1996]) threw a cloud\neven over this small window for affirmative action, boldly asserting\nthat the Bakke holding was now dead as law and that race\ncould not be used at all in admissions.\n\n\nGiven Justice Powell\u2019s singular opinion, supported by no one else on\nthe Court, and given the drift of Supreme Court decisions on racial\npreferences since\n 1978,[23]\n the Hopwood court was not\noutlandish, if a bit presumptuous, in declaring Powell\u2019s holding in\nBakke dead. As it happened, Powell\u2019s opinion was far from dead.\nIn the University of Michigan Law School case, Grutter v.\nBollinger, eventually decided by the Supreme Court in June 2003,\nJustice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s lead opinion declared: \u201ctoday we\nendorse Justice Powell\u2019s view that student body diversity is a\ncompelling state interest that can justify the use of race in\nuniversity admissions\u201d (Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU.S. 306 [2003], at 330).  Diversity was alive after all. But how it\nworked its affirmative action elixir remained as unclear in 2003 as it\nhad been in 1978.\n\n\nTo see why, consider how in Grutter Justice\nO\u2019Connor posed the issue:\n\n\nThe [Law School\u2019s] policy aspires to \u201cachieve that\ndiversity which has the potential to enrich everyone\u2019s education\nand thus make a law class stronger than the sum of its\nparts.\u201d\u2026The policy does not restrict the types of\ndiversity contributions eligible for substantial weight in the\nadmissions process, but instead recognizes \u201cmany possible bases\nfor diversity admissions.\u201d\u2026The policy does, however,\nreaffirm the Law School\u2019s longstanding commitment to \u201cone\nparticular type of diversity,\u201d that is, \u201cracial and ethnic\ndiversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from\ngroups which have been historically discriminated against\u201d\n(Grutter, at 325).\n\n\n\n\nNow, posing the issue this way and allowing the Law School to assert a\nspecial interest in \u201cone particular type of diversity\u201d\ninvites the conflation of general diversity\u2014a diversity\nof opinions, experiences, backgrounds, talents, aspirations, and\nperspectives\u2014with ethnic and racial diversity\nthat Justice Powell appeared strongly to resist. After all, the\nMedical School too had asserted in its defense a similar special\ninterest.\n\n\nRecall Justice Powell\u2019s principal objection to the Medical School\u2019s\nset-asides. In making the race or ethnicity of an applicant a\n\u201cplus,\u201d a scheme like Harvard\u2019s does\n\n\nnot insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates\nfor the available seats. The file of a particular African-American\napplicant may be examined for his potential contribution to diversity\nwithout the factor of race being decisive when compared, for example,\nwith that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the\nlatter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote\nbeneficial educational pluralism.\u2026In short, an admissions\nprogram operated in this way is flexible enough to consider all\npertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular\nqualifications of each applicant\u2026. This kind of program treats\neach applicant as an individual in the admissions\n process (Bakke, at 318\u201319).\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, Allan Bakke was not able to compete for all one hundred\nseats at the Medical School; sixteen were reserved for candidates not\nlike him.\n\n\nIt is Powell\u2019s resistance to this reservation that underpins Justice\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in Grutter, where she observed:\n\n\nWe find that the Law School\u2019s admissions program bears the hallmark\nof a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in\nBakke, truly individualized consideration demands that race be\nused in a flexible, non-mechanical way. It follows from this mandate\nthat universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial\n groups (Grutter, at 337).\n\n\n\n\nWhat vindicated the Law School in O\u2019Connor\u2019s eyes was its\n\u201chighly individualized, holistic review of each applicant\u2019s file,\ngiving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might\ncontribute to a diverse educational\nenvironment\u201d (Grutter, at\n 339).[24]\n This \u201cindividualized consideration\u201d is crucial; in\nGratz v.  Bollinger, decided the same day as\nGrutter, Justice O\u2019Connor switched sides to hold\nunconstitutional the undergraduate admissions process at the\nUniversity of Michigan. The undergraduate admissions office operated\ndifferently than the Law School. It computed an index score for each\napplicant by assigning numerical points for academic factors such as\nhigh school grades, admissions test scores, quality of high school,\nstrength of curriculum; and for nonacademic factors such as being a\nresident of Michigan, a child of an alumnus, a recruited athlete, or a\nmember of \u201can underrepresented minority group.\u201d An\napplicant falling in this last category automatically received 20\n points (Gratz v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 244 [2003], at 287).\n In O\u2019Connor\u2019s view, this \u201cmechanical\u201d procedure meant\nthat the undergraduate admissions office did not fully take account in\neach application \u201cof all factors that may contribute to student\nbody\n diversity\u201d (Gratz, at 288).\n \n\n\nBut O\u2019Connor\u2019s conclusion here simply draws us back to the lacuna in\nJustice Powell\u2019s Bakke opinion. Why should the undergraduate\nadmissions office take account of all the factors that may\ncontribute to student body diversity if it especially wants to select\nfrom certain parts of the diversity spectrum? Why can\u2019t it, like the\nLaw School, claim a special interest in \u201cone particular type of\ndiversity\u201d? Why bar the undergraduate admissions office from\nusing an effective tool to promote its interest even if the tool is\n\u201cmechanical\u201d? In fact, the Law School\u2019s\n\u201cnon-mechanical\u201d procedure differed from the undergraduate\nadmissions policy only on its face, not in its results. During\nadmissions season, the Law School\u2019s director of admissions frequently\nconsulted the \u201cdaily reports\u201d that \u201ckept track of\nthe racial and ethnic composition\u201d of the incoming class. He did\nso to make sure a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students was\n included (Grutter, at 326).\n In short, the Law School\n\u201cmanaged\u201d its admissions process so that roughly 6 to 7\npercent of each entering class was African-American. The undergraduate\nadmissions procedure, with its index scores, yielded a similar\n outcome (Grutter, at 367\u201369 [Rehnquist, dissenting] and 374 [Kennedy,\ndissenting]).\n Only surface appearance distinguished the\ntwo procedures. Justice Scalia called\nthe Law School\u2019s \u201cholistic\u201d admissions process \u201ca\nsham,\u201d and not without\n reason (Grutter, at 375 [Scalia, dissenting]).\n\n\nAs it turned out, Grutter failed to close the book on\nuniversity affirmative action. A new legal challenge soon arose, this\ntime against the University of Texas, which had revised its own\nadmission program in 2004 to emulate the scheme validated\nin Grutter. The case, Fisher v. Texas, wound its way\nthrough the courts for a decade, twice landing on the steps of the\nSupreme Court before final disposition in 2016.\n\nJustice Kennedy, writing for the Court, left the Grutter\ndefense of racial preferences intact, essentially retracing Justice\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion. Universities bent upon pursuing the\n\u201ceducational benefits that flow from student body\ndiversity,\u201d he wrote, are due a degree of judicial deference\n(Fisher v. University of Texas, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2419\n[2013]).\n\n\nThe University explains that it strives to provide an \u2018academic\nenvironment\u2019 that offers a \u2018robust exchange of ideas,\nexposure to differing cultures, preparation for the challenges of an\nincreasingly diverse workforce, and acquisition of competencies\nrequired of future leaders.\u2019 \u2026 All of these\nobjectives \u2026 mirror the \u2018compelling interest\u2019 this\nCourt has approved in its prior cases (Fisher v. University of\nTexas, 136 S. Ct. 2198, 2211 [2016]).\n\n\n\nPersuaded that race\u2013neutral policies didn\u2019t allow the\nUniversity fully to succeed in deriving the \u201ceducational\nbenefits\u201d of diversity, the Court majority found the\nUniversity\u2019s modest use of race permissible. \n\n\nBut despite these legal victories, have universities actually made a\ncase for diversity as the justifying basis for race\u2013conscious\nadmissions? Caught napping in the mid\u20131990s when the legal\nchallenges began, higher education rushed to put meat on\nthe Bakke bones and turn Justice Powell\u2019s\noff\u2013hand remarks into a full\u2013fledged defense. As the\nUniversity of Michigan cases approached a final test in 2003, the\nSupreme Court was bombarded with scores of\nfriend\u2013of\u2013the\u2013court briefs from business groups,\nmilitary officers, higher education associations, coteries of\nscholars, and other interested parties lauding the benefits of\ndiversity. A similar outpouring preceded the two decisions\nin Fisher v. University of\nTexas.[25]\n\nConsider some of the claims in these briefs. \u201c[S]tudent body\ndiversity is essential\u201d if universities are to provide\nstudents with \u201cskills necessary for\u2026success in an\nincreasingly globalized world\u201d (Leading Public Research\nUniversities 2015, 11\u201312; emphasis added). Racial and ethnic\ndiversity on campus are vital to securing a capable\nworkforce; it is  essential that [students] be educated in an\nenvironment where they are exposed to diverse people, ideas,\nperspectives, and interactions (65 Leading American Businesses 2003,\n1, 2; emphasis added). Otherwise, the education of students is\n\u201cdegraded\u201d (823 Social Scientists 2015, 5;\nemphasis added). \u201c[S]tudents today must receive direct\nexperience with people of different backgrounds\u201d (American\nCouncil on Education 2015, 6; emphasis added). The\n\u201conly means of obtaining properly qualified employees\nis through diversity at institutions of higher\neducation\u2026[Appropriate] skills can only be developed\nthrough exposure to widely diverse people, culture, ideas, and\nviewpoints\u201d (Fortune 100 and Other Leading Businesses 2013, 3,\n5; emphasis added). \u201cDiversity is an indispensable\nprerequisite to establishing the most productive problem\u2013solving\ngroups\u201d (Social and Organizational Psychologists 2015, 47;\nemphasis added).\n\n\nAccording to the briefs the positive effects of diversity are\nbountiful. They include \u201cimprovements in cognitive abilities,\nanalytical problem solving skills and complex thinking\nskills\u2026[C]ross racial interactions are more strongly linked\nwith cognitive growth than are interactions with non\u2013racial\ndiversity\u201d (American Educational Research Association 2012,\n12). \u201c[R]esearch shows that by increasing diversity, universities can\nhelp their graduates enter society with better problem\u2013solving\ncapabilities than students who are not exposed to diversity\u201d (Social\nand Organizational Psychologists 2015, 37). \n\nNow consider four points. First, the promiscuous use of \u201cdiversity\u201d in\nthe argument for affirmative action opens the door to waffling and\nequivocation. Students learn through \u201cexposure to widely diverse\npeople, culture, ideas, and viewpoints\u201d announces the Fortune 100\nbrief. Of course. But the issue at hand is racial\ndiversity. Wrapping the latter into the former is not an aid to\nprecision.[26]\nSecond, can we imagine that the University of Michigan or the\nUniversity of Texas would abandon its affirmative action program if\nstudies showed no particular educational benefit to diversity? Suppose\nit turns out that students in general don\u2019t show additional \u201ccognitive\ngrowth\u201d from increased racial diversity. Suppose it turns out students\nwould best prepare for our \u201cincreasingly globalized world\u201d by learning\nMandarin Chinese or Spanish.\n\nThird, the straining by academics to show that cross-racial\ninteraction\nis essential, indispensable, vital, necessary,\nor imperative to a good education, if taken at face value,\nleads to an unpleasant conclusion, namely that a lot of black college\nstudents suffer a deficient education. The young woman who excels at\nDunbar High School in Washington, DC (enrollment 95 % black, 1 %\nwhite) and then gets her Bachelor of Science degree in\nstatistics magna cum laude at Spelman College (enrolling, in\n2017, one white among its 2097 students) is, according to Fortune 100\ncompanies, not the sort of employee they want. Graduates of Fisk\nUniversity (0.7% white) or Tougaloo (0.6% white) or Florida A & M\n(3.5% white) haven\u2019t achieved enough cognitive growth,\nhaven\u2019t sufficiently honed their problem\u2013solving\nskills\u2014is that what we are supposed to conclude? The University\nof Texas (enrolling 25% Hispanics and 5% blacks) contends that without\na \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students it can\u2019t reap\n\u201cthe educational benefits of diversity.\u201d Does this mean\nthat Prairie View University, two hours down the road from Austin and\nenrolling 7% Hispanics and 1.8% whites, has to do without those\nbenefits? Are its students poorly prepared for \u201cour increasingly\ndiverse workforce and society\u201d (Fisher 2016, at 2210,\n2211)? Defenders of affirmative action should think twice about\nclaiming an education in a \u201cnon\u2013diverse\u201d setting\nmust be degraded. \n\nFourth, there is a noticeable lack of \u201cfit\u201d between university\naffirmative action practices and the diversity rationale (see, for\nexample, Anderson 2002, 27; Anderson 2004, 1217, 1221; Anderson 2010,\n142\u2013143). Race is not treated just like any other special factor\nthat might warrant an admission \u201cplus.\u201d Universities work diligently\nto maintain a relatively constant percentage of black and Hispanic\nenrollees but give variable attention to other of the myriad qualities\nstudents can bring to campus. As one proponent of affirmative action\nnotes, \u201caffirmative action programs\u2026do not look or operate as\nif they were testing for \u2018diversity\u2019.\u201d He suggests that many\nsupporters of affirmative action nevertheless disregard this fact,\nbelieving \u201cthat there is no harm in [a] miscast reliance on diversity\nbecause, with a wink and a nod, everyone understands that diversity is\nreally a proxy for integration\u201d (Issacharoff 2002, 30, 34;\nemphasis added). \n8. The Integration Argument\n\n\nAlthough the University couched its legal defense in terms of the\n\u201ceducational benefits of diversity,\u201d another rationale lay ready at\nhand. The main reason the University of Michigan strives for a\nreasonable representation of minorities on campus is because of the\nway it conceives of its mission: to prepare Michigan\u2019s future\nleaders.\n\n\nThe argument is straightforward:\n\nThe leadership of the state ought roughly to represent the state\u2019s\npopulation, ethnically and racially.\nAs the state\u2019s premier training ground for leadership, the\nUniversity ought to graduate rising generations of future leaders that\nconform to this representational goal.\nTo graduate such rising generations, it needs to admit racially and\nethnically representative classes.\n\n\n\nThis is the \u201cMichigan Mandate\u201d (Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 135 F. Supp. 2d 790 [2001], at 796\u2013797).\nRacial and ethnic diversity aren\u2019t incidental contributors to a\ndistinct academic mission; they are part of the mission of\nthe University, just as educating young people from Michigan is part\nof it (see Fullinwider and Lichtenberg 2004, 165\u2013188). And\nsomething like a national version of the mandate underlies the\nMichigan Law School\u2019s affirmative action policy, since its\ngraduates move into elite law firms or government service outside\nMichigan (see Lempert et al. 2000, 399; Wilkins 2000,\n530\u2013534).\n\n\nThis \u201cintegration\u201d rationale seems better aligned with the\nactual practice of university affirmative action than the diversity\nrationale. Indeed, in the midst of her nominally Powell-like defense\nof the Law School, Justice O\u2019Connor in Grutter for a\nmoment veered away from the \u201ceducational benefits of\ndiversity\u201d to go down a quite different path. Institutions like\nthe University of Michigan and its Law School, she noted,\n\u201crepresent the training ground for\u2026our Nation\u2019s\nleaders.\u201d She went on:\n\n\nIn order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes\nof the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be\nvisibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and\nethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have\nconfidence in the openness and integrity of the educational\ninstitutions that provide this training.\u2026Access\u2026must be\ninclusive\u2026of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of\nour heterogeneous society may participate in the educational\ninstitutions that provide the training and education necessary to\nsucceed in\n America (Grutter, at 336).\n\n\n\n\nThis \u201clegitimacy\u201d argument\u2014not in any way about\nenriching the climate of opinion on campus or improving\nstudents\u2019 complex thinking skills\u2014parallels the simple\nsyllogism set out just above. Justice O\u2019Connor inserted this new\nrationale into the middle of her Grutter\nopinion\u2014inserted it unexpectedly and then abandoned it just as\nquickly to resume tracing the byways of diversity. Justice Kennedy did\nthe same in Fisher (2016, 2211).  \n\n\nCertainly, something in the spirit of the \u201cMichigan\nMandate\u201d has animated elite universities, including those\nstudied by William Bowen and Derek Bok in The Shape of the River:\nLong-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University\nAdmissions. The primary aim of these institutions is not through\nvigorous affirmative action to enhance the liberal learning of their\nstudents (although they welcome this gain for all students). Their\nmain motive for assuring that the percentage of African-Americans and\nHispanics on their campuses is more than token derives from their\nself-conceptions as institutions training individuals who will some\nday take up national and international leadership roles in the\nprofessions, arts, sciences, education, politics, and government\n(Bowen and Bok 1998, 7).  Society, they believe, will be stronger and\nmore just if the ranks of its leading citizens include a racially and\nethnically broader range of people than it does now. Nor are they\nwrong in thinking that the pipeline to local and national elites runs\nthrough top-notch universities.\n\n\nElizabeth Anderson, in two long essays (2002, 2004), bookending\nthe Grutter decision, makes a thorough and cogent case for\nputting racial integration at the center of conceptions of affirmative\naction. The diversity argument is insufficient, she\nwrites. \u201cConsidered as a purely cognitive end, divorced from the\nvalues of democracy and social justice, the \u2018robust exchange of\nideas\u2019 cannot support the scope of racial preferences in college\nadmissions\u201d (Anderson 2002, 1221). She goes on:\n\n\nThe integrative model of affirmative action offers an alternative\nrationale for race\u2013sensitive admissions that unites educational\nwith democratic and social justice concerns. It begins with a\nrecognition that Americans live in a profoundly segregated society, a\ncondition inconsistent with a fully democratic society and with equal\nopportunity. To achieve the latter goals, we need to\ndesegregate\u2014to integrate, that is\u2014to live together as one\nbody of equal citizens (Anderson 2002, 1222).\n\n\n\nThe integrative model has several legal advantages over the diversity\nand compensation models of affirmative action. It makes sense of the\nscope and weight that educational institutions actually give to race\nin the admissions process. It thus closes the gap between theory and\npractice that makes affirmative action programs so vulnerable under\nstrict scrutiny. It also shows how race can be directly relevant to a\ncompelling state interest, rather than merely a proxy for something\nelse, such as diversity of opinions (Anderson 2002, 1226).\n\n\n\nGiven the realities of race in the U.S., people of different races\noccupy different walks of life. So in the U.S., democracy requires\nracial integration of the main institutions of civil society, the\nplaces where discussion of public import among citizens take place:\npublic accommodations, workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. The\nsame point applies to society\u2019s elites, those who play a pivotal\nrole in formulating and adopting policies of public import. Elites, to\nbe legitimate, must serve a representative function: they must be\ncapable of and dedicated to representing the concerns of people from\nall walks of life, so that the policies they forge are responsive to\nthese concerns. An elite drawn only from segments of society that live\nin isolation from other segments will be ignorant of the circumstances\nand concerns of those who occupy other walks of life (Anderson 2004,\n22).\n\n\n\nAnderson sees integration as an end courts can accept, one that\ninforms many past judicial opinions and acts of legislation, and one\ngiven endorsement in Grutter:\n\nThe \u201cdiversity\u201d defense of affirmative action, articulated\nin Justice Powell\u2019s Bakke opinion, limits integration\nto those cases in which it can be shown to yield educational\nbenefits. Grutter advances a more robust integrationist\nperspective, which affirms racial integration as a compelling interest\napart rom its educational benefits (Anderson 2004, 23).\n\n\n(It is hard to see how Grutter represents a\n\u201crobust\u201d defense of integrative affirmative\naction. Justice O\u2019Connor introduced the \u201clegitimacy\u201d\nargument without prior preparation and left it hanging without further\ndevelopment. Justice Kennedy in Fisher likewise seemed not to\nnotice that the \u201clegitimacy\u201d argument departs considerably\nfrom the diversity rationale he was rehearsing. Nevertheless, there it\nis in the majority opinions, to be seized on and developed by a future\ncourt if it is so disposed.)[27] \n \nOther writers, too, have talked about affirmative action in terms\nof integration (Warnke 1998; Estlund 2002; Jacobs 2004; Boddie\n2016). \n\n\nThe integration argument, like the diversity argument, is\nstraightforwardly instrumental. It points to hoped-for outcomes of\naffirmative action. If those outcomes don\u2019t materialize, then\naffirmative action\u2019s cause is weakened. Moreover, the little\nintegration syllogism isn\u2019t complete as it stands. It needs to include\nanother premise: that the gains from achieving racially and ethnically\nintegrated classes don\u2019t come at a disproportionate cost.\n\n\nPerhaps the cost is high, or even too high. Stephan and Abigail\nThernstrom certainly think so. They contend that most of the cost\nfalls on the very persons affirmative action is supposed to benefit.\nUnder-prepared African-Americans are thrown into academic environments\nwhere they cannot succeed (Thernstrom and Thernstrom 1997, 395\u2013411).\nIn the Thernstroms\u2019 view, race-blind admissions policies will result\nin a desirable \u201ccascading,\u201d with African-American and\nHispanic students ending up at colleges and universities where the\nacademic credentials of their fellow students match their\nown. However, the Bowen and Bok study provides some evidence that\ncascading isn\u2019t necessarily a valuable phenomenon. In fact, at the\nschools they studied, the better the institution a student entered,\nwhatever his academic credentials, the more likely he was to graduate,\ngo on to further education, and earn a good\nincome (Bowen and Bok 1998, 63, 114,\n 144).\n\n\nEven so, the select schools Bowen and Bok studied may be quite\nunrepresentative of the full range of schools that\nresort to racial preferences and the cost-benefit picture that holds\nfor these schools may not hold for the rest. Indeed, the picture drawn\nby Richard Sander in a lengthy review of affirmative action in law\nschools, published in the November 2004 Stanford Law Review,\nlends credence to the Thernstrom\u2019s academic mismatch thesis. Ranking\nlaw schools from best to worst, Sander found that affirmative action\nboosts African-American students 20 or more steps up the ladder,\nputting them in schools with white classmates who possess considerably\nbetter LSAT scores and undergraduate college grades.  The upshot:\n\u201cclose to half of black students end up in the bottom tenth of\ntheir classes.\u201d This bad performance yields three bad\nconsequences.  First, African-American students suffer high attrition\nrates.  Second, they fail the bar exam at a high rate (the principal\npredictor of a student\u2019s passing or failing is her grades, not the\nquality of her school).  Third, they suffer a significant employment\npenalty for low grades \u201cin all schools outside the top\nten.\u201d Sander estimates that under a race-blind admissions\nsystem, American law schools would actually create more\nAfrican-American lawyers than they do under affirmative action (Sander\n2004, 449, 460, 478, 479).\n\n\nSander\u2019s article inspired a flurry of responses disputing his\nmethodology and conclusions (e.g., Ayers and Brooks 2005, Chambers,\net al. 2005, Wilkins 2005, Ho 2005, Barnes 2007, and\nRothstein and Yoon 2008).  Sander replied to his critics (Sander\n2005); other writers found evidence of mismatch effects in educational\ndomains outside law schools (Elliott et al. 1996, Smith and\nMcArdle, 2004, Arcidiacono et al. 2012); yet other scholars\npresented independent confirmation of Sander\u2019s hypothesis\n(Arcidiacono et al. 2011b, Williams 2013), One critic, upon\nre-analysis, had to withdraw her refutation of Sander (Barnes 2007,\nBarnes 2011); and in 2012 Sander joined with co-author Stuart Taylor\nto publish Mismatch, a book-length treatment setting out old\nand new research supporting Sander\u2019s hypothesis. Others continue\nto find the law school mismatch hypothesis dubious and unsupported\n(Camilli and Welner 2011; Camilli and Jackson 2011; Kidder and Lempert\n2015) \n\nOther researchers, following the lead of Bowen and Bok, have focused\non undergraduate performance. Fischer and Massey, for example,\nconcluded that though affirmative action has \u201cboth positive and\nnegative implications for minority students, [such policies] operate,\non balance, to enhance the academic achievement of minority\nstudents\u201d (Fischer and Massey 2007, 546). In another study,\nMassey and Mooney found \u201clittle support for the mismatch\nhypothesis\u201d (Massey and Mooney 2007, 114). Dale and Krueger\ndetermined that \u201cthe effect of attending a school with a higher\naverage SAT score is positive for black and Hispanic students\u201d\n(Dale and Krueger 2014, 350). Similarly, Melguizo held: \n\nthat for minority students who were admitted to\u2026selective\ninstitutions under affirmative action (i.e., with slightly\nbelow\u2013average SAT scores but with other personal characteristics\nand experiences correlated with persistence), their probability of\ngraduation was not lower as was predicted by critics of affirmative\naction. On the contrary, their probability of graduation was higher at\nthe most and very selective institutions compared to the\nnon\u2013selective ones (Melguizo 2008, 233).\n\n\n\n\nOne reason disputes persist about cause and effect is imperfect\ndata. Although often operating with large sets of information,\nresearchers must decide which statistical models most appropriately\ntease out significance, decisions that involve debatable assumptions\nabout filling in missing pieces. Two researchers note that\n\u201c[b]etter data would undoubtedly permit more relevant and\nconvincing analyses of the effects of mismatch and and would\nespecially help to identify any threshold below which potential\nmismatch effects become more probable\u201d (Camilli and Welner 2011,\n500). Much of the back\u2013and\u2013forth about the effects of\naffirmative action could be resolved if educational institutions\ndisclosed information about their admissions processes, student\ngrades, graduation rates, and the like. But institutional resistance\nmakes this unlikely.[28] \n9. Desert Confounded, Desert Misapplied\n\n\nThe affirmative action debate throws up many ironies but one in\nparticular should be noted. From the time in 1973 when Judith Jarvis\nThomson conjectured that it was \u201cnot entirely\ninappropriate\u201d that white males bear the costs of the\ncommunity\u2019s \u201cmaking amends\u201d to African-Americans and women\nthrough preferential affirmative action, the affirmative action debate\nhas been distracted by intense quarrels over who deserves\nwhat. Do the beneficiaries of affirmative action deserve\ntheir benefits (Allen 2011)? Do the losers deserve their loss?\n\n\nChristopher Edley, the White House assistant put in charge of\nPresident Clinton\u2019s review of affirmative action policy in 1994\u201395,\nspeaks of how, during the long sessions he and his co-workers put in\naround the conference table, the discussion of affirmative action kept\ncircling back to the \u201ccoal miner\u2019s son\u201d \n question (I\u2019ve changed the gender for expository purposes).\n\n\nImagine a college admissions committee trying to decide between the\nwhite [son] of an Appalachian coal miner\u2019s family and the African\nAmerican son of a successful Pittsburgh neurosurgeon. Why should the\nblack applicant get preference over the white\napplicant? (Edley 1996, 132ff)\n\n\n\n\nWhy, indeed? This is a hard question if one defends affirmative action\nin terms of compensatory or distributive justice. If directly doing\njustice is what affirmative action is about, then its mechanisms must\nbe adjusted as best they can to reward individual desert and true\nmerit. The \u201ccoal miner\u2019s son\u201d example is meant to throw\ndesert in the defender\u2019s face: here is affirmative action at\nwork thwarting desert, for surely the coal miner\u2019s son\u2014from the\nhard scrabble of Harlan County, say\u2014has lived with far less\nadvantage than the neurosurgeon\u2019s son who, we may suppose, has reaped\nall the advantages of his father\u2019s (or mother\u2019s) standing. Why should\nthe latter get a preference?\n\n\nA defender might answer in the way that Charles Lawrence and Mari\nMatsuda do in their 1997 book, We Won\u2019t Go Back:\n\u201cAll the talk about class, the endless citings of the\n\u2018poor white male from Appalachia,\u2019 cannot avoid the\nreality of race and gender privilege\u201d (Lawrence and Matsuda\n1997, 190\u2013191). As they see it, because white privilege persists\nracial preferences really do balance the scales. Because male\nprivilege persists, gender preferences really do make selections\nfairer. Lawrence and Matsuda brook no concession: in every case the\nloser in affirmative action is not the more deserving.\n\n\nEven Justice Brennan tried his hand at this argument, writing in\nBakke:\n\n\nIf it was reasonable to conclude\u2014as we hold that it\nwas\u2014that the failure of minorities to qualify for admission at\n[the University of California at] Davis [Medical School] under regular\nprocedures was due principally to the effects of past discrimination,\nthen there is a reasonable likelihood that, but for pervasive racial\ndiscrimination\u2026[Bakke] would have failed to qualify for\nadmission even in the absence of Davis\u2019 special admissions\n program (Bakke, at 365\u20136 [Brennen, dissenting]).\n\n\n\n\nBakke was not denied anything to which he had moral claim in the\nfirst place.\n\n\n\nJust as Mary Anne Warren and James Rachels in the 1970s thought that\nthe losers under affirmative action were losing only illicit\nprivileges, and the gainers merely gaining what should have been theirs\nto start with, so Michel Rosenfeld in the 1990s, in his extended\n\u201cdialogic\u201d defense of affirmative action, echoes the same\nthought:\n\n\nAlthough affirmative action treats innocent white males unequally, it\nneed not deprive them of any genuine equal opportunity rights.\nProvided an affirmative action plan is precisely tailored to\nredress the losses in prospects of success [by African-Americans and\nwomen] attributable to racism and sexism, it only deprives innocent\nwhite males of the corresponding undeserved increases in their\nprospects of success\u2026. [R]emedial affirmative action does\nnot take away from innocent white males anything that they have\nrightfully earned or that they should be entitled to\n keep (Rosenfeld 1991, 307\u20138, emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\nHowever, programs that give blanket preferences by race or gender are\nhardly \u201cprecisely tailored\u201d to match desert and reward\nsince, as Lawrence and Matsuda themselves acknowledge at one place,\nthe white male \u201cprivilege\u201d is \u201cstatistical\u201d\n(Lawrence and Matsuda 1997, 252).  Yet it is individuals, not\nstatistical averages, who gain or lose in admissions determinations\nand employment selections.[29] \n\n\nThe persistence of this strategy of defense reflects a residual\nfeeling that the fruits of affirmative action are somehow spoiled if they are\nnot deserved (Harris 2003). Nevertheless, it is the wrong strategy for defending\nreal world affirmative action. The programs legitimated under the\nCivil Rights Act, in both their nonpreferential and preferential\nforms, had\u2014and have\u2014a clear aim: to change institutions so\nthat they can meet the nondiscrimination mandate of the Act. Selection\nby race or gender was\u2014and is\u2014a means to such change. To\nthe extent that such selection also compensates individuals for past\nwrongs or puts people in places they really deserve, these are\nincidental by-products of a process aimed at something else.\n\n\nThe same is true with university admissions policy. When the Medical\nSchool of the University of California at Davis offered four reasons\nin defense of the special admissions program that left Bakke on the\noutside, none of these reasons said anything about matching admissions\nand desert. The criteria of the special admissions program\u2014race\nand ethnicity\u2014were instruments to further ends: integrating the\nclassroom, the profession, and the delivery of medical services, and\nbreaking the chain of self-reproducing societal discrimination.\nLikewise, when the University of Michigan and the University of Texas\ndefended their programs they pointed not to desert rewarded but\neducational value generated.\n\n\nNow, if the neurosurgeon\u2019s son because of his race can\nadvance each of these goals and the coal miner\u2019s son, because of\nhis race, cannot, then isn\u2019t the selection decision easy? Pick\nthe African-American neurosurgeon\u2019s son (however advantaged\nhe may be) over the\nwhite coal miner\u2019s son (even if he is the\nmost deserving creature imaginable). The aims of real world\naffirmative action make race and ethnicity (and sometimes gender)\nsalient, not personal desert or merit. The test of real world\naffirmative action lies in the urgency of its ends (preventing\ndiscrimination, promoting diversity or integration) and the aptness\n(moral and causal) of its means (racial, ethnic, and gender\npreferences).  Both remain much in dispute.\n\n",
