    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || The transfer of necessity\n2.6 The transfer of necessity\n\nThe next premise in the argument is (5), the principle that licenses\nthe \u201ctransfer\u201d of necessity from (3) to (6) via (4).\nOckhamists and Dependence Theorists both allow that the necessity of\nthe past, when applicable to past events, transfers to the future.\nWhether this transfer principle is valid depends on the modality being\ntransferred and the modality effecting the transfer. Logical\nnecessity, for example, is validly transferred by entailment:\n\u25a1p, \u25a1(p \u2283 q), \u2234\n\u25a1q. But some modalities, like non-accidentality (Slote\n1982), are not closed under entailment. How about the necessity of the\npast? A much-discussed transfer principle, playing the same role in\nPeter van Inwagen\u2019s Consequence Argument that (5) plays in the\nargument for theological fatalism, is rule \u03b2 (van Inwagen 1983).\nThe necessity-operator featured in this principle is\nN, where Np is to be read,\n\u201cp, and no one has, or ever had, any choice about\nwhether p.\u201d Rule \u03b2 states that, given\nNp and N(p \u2283\nq), it follows that Nq.\nCounterexamples to rule \u03b2 were soon discovered, e.g., by McKay\nand Johnson (1996). But it was easy to amend the Consequence Argument\nto rest on Np, \u25a1(p \u2283\nq), \u2234 Nq, and this principle\nappears to have no counterexample. The parallel principle for\ntheological fatalism is \u25a1tp,\n\u25a1(p \u2283 q), \u2234\n\u25a1tq, where \u25a1tp is\nto be read, \u201cp is fixed, accidentally necessary, no longer\navoidable, etc., relative to time t.\u201d This principle,\ntoo, seems to have no counterexample.\n\nDuns Scotus (Kenny 1979, 56\u201358) appears to have challenged this\nprinciple. Fischer (1985b) responds to the challenge. But the theory\nof divine omniscience that has been most closely associated with the\ndenial of (5) is the doctrine of Middle Knowledge. This doctrine was\nvehemently debated in the 16th century, with the version of\nLuis de Molina, referred to as \u201cMolinism,\u201d getting the\nmost attention in the contemporary literature. Recently the doctrine\nhas received strong support by Thomas Flint (1998) and Eef Dekker\n(2000). Unlike the other compatibilist solutions we are considering,\nwhich aim only at showing that infallible foreknowledge and human\nfreedom are compatible, Molinism provides an account of how\nGod knows the contingent future, along with a strong doctrine of\ndivine providence. Middle knowledge is called \u201cmiddle\u201d\nbecause it is said to stand between God\u2019s knowledge of necessary\ntruths and his knowledge of his own creative will. The objects of\nMiddle Knowledge are so-called counterfactuals of freedom:\n\nIf person S were in circumstances C, S\nwould freely do X.\n\nMiddle knowledge requires that there are true counterfactuals of this\nform corresponding to every possible free creature and every possible\ncircumstance in which that creature can act freely. These propositions\nare intended to be contingent (a claim that has been disputed by some\nobjectors), but they are prior to God\u2019s creative will. God uses\nthem in deciding what to create. By combining his Middle Knowledge\nwith what he decides to create, God knows the entire history of the\nworld.\n\nThere are a number of objections to Middle Knowledge in the\ncontemporary literature. Robert Adams (1991) argues that Molinism is\ncommitted to the position that the truth of a counterfactual of\nfreedom is explanatorily prior to God\u2019s decision to create us.\nBut the truth of a counterfactual to the effect that if I were in\ncircumstance C I would do A is strictly inconsistent\nwith my refraining from A in C, and so my refraining\nfrom A in C is precluded by something prior in the\norder of explanation to my act in C. This is inconsistent\nwith my acting freely in C. Climenhaga and Rubio\n(forthcoming) clarify the nature of explanatory priority and in so\ndoing affirm the essential correctness of Adams\u2019 analysis. There\nare a number of other objections to Middle Knowledge in the\nliterature, as well as replies by its defenders. William Hasker (1989,\n1995, 1997, 2000) has offered a series of objections and replies to\nWilliam Craig, who defends Middle Knowledge (1994, 1998). Yet other\nobjections have been proposed by Walls (1990) and Gaskin (1993).\nRecent critical discussions of Molinism appear in Fischer (2008),\nGuleserian (2008), and Fales (2010). Defenses of Molinism appear in\nBr\u00fcntrup & Schneider (2011) and Kosciuk (2010), and a\ncritique in Shieber (2009). Perszyk (2011) is a collection of essays\nexamining Molinism and its future direction, while Perszyk (2013)\nprovides a survey of the recent literature.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of argument, that the doctrine of Middle\nKnowledge is defensible. How does that avoid the conclusion of the\nargument for theological fatalism? Middle Knowledge does not entail\nthe falsehood of any premise of the basic argument. Freddoso (1988,\n53\u201360) argues that Molina rejects the closure of accidental\nnecessity under entailment, but for reasons closer to those inspiring\nthe Dependence Solution (though Molina does not dispute the necessity\nof the past). Flint (1998) rejects some of the steps of the fatalist\nargument in addition to defending Middle Knowledge, and more recently\nblends of Ockhamism and Molinism have been defended (Kosciuk 2010),\nwhich suggests that even though the theory of Middle Knowledge is a\npowerful theory of divine knowledge and providence, it is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to avoid theological fatalism by itself.\n",
