    "main_text": "Ultimate Truth and the Middle Way\n1. Ultimate Truth and the Middle Way\n\nThe Geluk interpretation of the Middle Way offers a unique\npresentation of the Buddhist doctrine of two truths: the ultimate\ntruth and conventional (or relative) truth. Geluk philosophers are\nconcerned to avoid the reification of the ultimate truth and the\ndeprecation of conventional truth, arguing that conventional existence\nand ultimate nonexistence are mutually implicative. In this tradition,\nthe two truths are said to be \u201cextensionally identical but\nintensionally distinct\u201d (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha\ndad). That is, the two truths are not different entities, but are\nconceptually distinct aspects of all entities. Thus Geluk philosophers\nargue that (1) to exist is to be empty and (2) to exist is to exist\nconventionally (see Changkya in Cozort 1998, 429).\n\nThe ultimate truth is said to be emptiness because things are not\nfound to exist separate from their parts, causes, or designations;\nthis non-finding itself is the meaning of emptiness. Emptiness, too,\nis not \u201cfound\u201d when sought (emptiness is empty, too). To\nbe found (when an ultimate essence is sought) is to be intrinsically\nor ultimately real, and nothing has this status for the Geluk\ntradition, not even emptiness. Emptiness is interpreted in the Geluk\ntradition as a non-implicative negation (med dgag). As\nopposed to a negation that implies something else, a non-implicative\nnegation is simply an absence, such as a lack of true existence. This\nmere lack or absence, as a negation of essence that does not implicate\nany other essence, is the meaning of the ultimate truth in the Geluk\ntradition. Nevertheless, the claim that there is nothing ultimately\nreal\u2014or that the ultimate truth is emptiness\u2014is itself a\n(conventional) truth (Jinpa 2002, 46\u201348). It is expressed like\nthis: \u201cThe ultimate truth is posited as solely the negation of\ntruth [that is, inherent existence] upon a subject that is a basis of\nnegation\u2026\u201d (Tsongkhapa, 396). Thus, on this view, nothing\nexists ultimately. This lack of essence in phenomena, or\n\u201cemptiness,\u201d does not annul their appearance or\nconventional reality. Rather, emptiness is held to be the condition\nfor the possibility for any appearance. To be empty means to arise\ndependently\u2014to lack independent, real existence. Since nothing\ncan be found to be independent, everything is said to be empty. Thus,\nin the Geluk tradition, emptiness is the nature of all phenomena (or\ntheir lack of independent nature), and all phenomena are\nnecessarily empty.\n",
