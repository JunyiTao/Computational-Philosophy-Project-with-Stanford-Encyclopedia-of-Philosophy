    "main_text": "Models of faith and their key components\n1. Models of faith and their key components\n\nWhile philosophical reflection on faith of the kind exemplified in\nreligious contexts might ideally hope to yield an agreed definition in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions that articulate the\nnature of faith, the present discussion proceeds by identifying key\ncomponents that recur in different accounts of religious faith. It\nalso aims to identify a focal range of issues on which different\nstances are taken by different accounts. There is a plurality of\nexisting philosophical understandings or models of faith of the\nreligious kind. This discussion therefore aims to set out\ndialectically an organisation of this plurality, while also giving\nindications of the reasons there may be for preferring particular\nmodels over others. Since \u2018religion\u2019 itself may well be a\n\u2018family resemblance\u2019 universal, essentialism about faith\nof the religious kind might be misplaced. Nevertheless, the concept of\nfaith as found in the Abrahamic, theist, religious traditions is\nwidely regarded as unified enough for an inquiry into its nature to\nmake sense, even if a successful real definition is too much to expect\n(this kind of faith might conceivably be a conceptual primitive, for\nexample).\n\nNote that some philosophers approach the target of religious faith by\nfirst classifying and analysing ordinary language uses of the term\n\u2018faith\u2019 and locutions in which that term occurs. See, for\nrecent examples, Audi 2011 (Chapter 3, Section I), who identifies\nseven different kinds of faith, and Howard-Snyder (2013b), who\nattempts a general analysis of \u2018propositional\u2019\nfaith\u2014i.e., faith that p is true, where p is a relevant\nproposition. The present discussion, however, deals directly with the\ntarget notion of the kind of faith exemplified in religious\nfaith, assuming the background of a working grasp of the notion\nas deployed in religious forms of life, and specifically in those\nbelonging to the theist traditions. Insights from the analysis of\nfaith understood more broadly may, nevertheless, be important in\nconstructing models of faith of the religious kind, as will emerge\nbelow in the discussion of religious faith as a kind of trust (Section\n6).\n\nThe notion of religious faith as the possession of a whole people is\nfamiliar, and arguably theologically primary in the theist traditions.\nPhilosophical accounts of theistic faith typically focus, however, on\nwhat it is for an individual person to \u2018have faith\u2019 or be\n\u2018a person of faith\u2019. An initial broad distinction is\nbetween thinking of faith just as a person\u2019s state when\nthat person \u2018has faith\u2019, and thinking of it as also\ninvolving a person\u2019s act, action or activity.\nFaith may be a state one is in, or comes to be in; it may also\nessentially involve something one does. An adequate account of faith,\nperhaps, needs to encompass both. In the Christian context, faith is\nunderstood both as a gift of God and also as requiring a human\nresponse of assent and trust, so that their faith is something with\nrespect to which people are both receptive and active.\n\nThere is, however, some tension in understanding faith both as a gift\nto be received and as essentially involving a venture to be willed and\nenacted. A philosophical account of faith may be expected to\nilluminate this apparent paradox. One principle for classifying models\nof faith is according to the extent to which they recognise an active\ncomponent in faith itself, and the way they identify that active\ncomponent and its relation to faith\u2019s other components. It is\nhelpful to consider the components of faith (variously recognised and\nemphasised in different models of faith) as falling into three broad\ncategories: the affective, the cognitive and the\npractical. There are also evaluative components in\nfaith\u2014these may appear as implicated in the affective and/or the\ncognitive components, according to one\u2019s preferred meta-theory\nof value.\n",
