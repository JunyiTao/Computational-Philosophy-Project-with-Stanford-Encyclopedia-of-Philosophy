    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Being and truth\n3.2 Being and truth\n\nAccording to Wyclif, the constitutive property of each kind of being\nis the capacity to be the object of a complex act of signifying\n(De ente in communi, chap. 3, p. 36; De ente primo in\ncommuni, chap. 1, p. 70). This choice implies a revolution in the\nstandard medieval theory of transcendentals, since Wyclif actually\nreplaces being (ens) with true (verum). According to\nthe common belief, among the transcendentals (being, thing, one,\nsomething, true, good) being was the primitive notion, from which all\nthe others stemmed by adding a specific connotation in relation to\nsomething else, or by adding some new determination. So true\n(verum) was nothing but being (ens) itself\nconsidered in relation to an intellect, no matter whether divine or\nhuman. In Wyclif\u2019s view, on the contrary, being is no longer the\nmain transcendental and its notion is not the first and simplest;\nrather there is something more basic to which being can be reduced:\ntruth (veritas or verum). According to the English\nphilosopher, only what can be signified by a complex expression is a\nbeing, and whatever is the proper object of an act of signifying is a\ntruth. Truth is therefore the true name of being itself (Tractatus\nde universalibus, chap. 7, p. 139). Thus everything that is is a\ntruth, and every truth is something not simple but complex. Absolute\nsimplicity is unknown within Wyclif\u2019s metaphysical world. From\nthe semantic point of view, this means the collapsing of the\nfundamental distinction in the common Aristotelian theory of meaning,\nthe one between simple signs (like nouns) and compound signs (like\npropositions). From the ontological point of view, this entails the\nuniqueness in type of what is signified by every class of\ncategorematic expressions (Logica, chap. 5, p. 14). Within\nWyclif\u2019s world, it is the same kind of object that both concrete\nterms and propositions refer to, as individual substances have to be\nregarded as (atomic) states of affairs. According to him, from the\nmetaphysical point of view a singular man is nothing but a real\nproposition (propositio realis), where actual existence in\ntime as an individual plays the role of the subject, the common nature\n(i.e., human nature) plays the role of the predicate, and the singular\nessence (i.e., that by means of which this individual is a man) plays\nthe role of the copula (ibid., pp. 14\u201315).\n\nDespite appearances, Wyclif\u2019s opinion on this subject is not\njust a new formulation of the theory of the complexe\nsignificabile. According to the supporters of the complexe\nsignificabile theory, the same things that are signified by\nsimple concrete terms are signified by complex expressions (or\npropositions). In Wyclif\u2019s thought, on the contrary, there are\nno simple things in the world that correspond to simple concrete\nterms; rather, simple concrete terms designate real propositions, that\nis, atomic states of affairs. Wyclif\u2019s real proposition is that\neverything that is, as everything save God is composed at least of\npotency and act (De ente praedicamentali, chap. 5, pp.\n38\u201339), can therefore be conceived of and signified both in a\ncomplex (complexe) and in a non-complex manner\n(incomplexe) (Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 2,\npp. 55\u201356; chap. 3, pp. 70, 74, and 84; chap. 6, pp.\n118\u201319). When we conceive of a thing in a complex manner, we\nconsider that thing according to its metaphysical structure, and so\naccording to its many levels of being and kinds of essence. As a\nconsequence, Wyclif\u2019s metaphysical world, like his physical\nworld, consists of atomic objects, that is, single essences belonging\nto the ten different types or categories. But these metaphysical atoms\nare not simple but rather composite, because they are reducible to\nsomething else, belonging to a different rank of reality and unable to\nexist by themselves: being and essence, potency and act, matter and\nform, abstract genera, species and differences. For that reason,\neverything one can speak about or think of is both a thing and an\natomic state of affairs, while every true sentence expresses a\nmolecular state of affairs, that is, the union (if the sentence is\naffirmative) or the separation (if the sentence is negative) of two\n(or more) atomic objects (on Wyclif\u2019s theory of proposition see\nCesalli 2005).\n",
