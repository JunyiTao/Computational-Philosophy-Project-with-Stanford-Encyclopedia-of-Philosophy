    "main_text": "Arguments for PIT || Internalism and brains in a vat\n4.3 Internalism and brains in a vat\n\nIt is possible to argue for PIT on the basis of internalism\nabout mental content, the view that what a subject\u2019s mental\nstates represent is fully determined by her intrinsic properties. (The\nalternative to internalism is externalism. Intentional\ncontent that is determined by a subject\u2019s intrinsic properties\nis said to be narrow as opposed to wide. See the\nentries on\n narrow mental content\n and\n externalism about mental content.)\n\nLoar (2003a) argues from internalism to PIT.\nFirst, Loar proposes the following two desiderata for a theory of\nintentionality: (1) The theory should be a non-referential theory,\nwhere a non-referential theory is a theory that does not take\nintentionality to be a matter of reference to external entities, for\nexample, concrete or abstract objects. This desideratum is motivated\nby internalism. (Note that, for Loar, intentionality is not the same\nthing as reference, and so a non-referential theory of intentionality\ndoes not commit one to denying that there is such a thing as\nreference.) (2) The theory should accommodate externalism about\nreference and truth-conditions (see, e.g., Putnam 1975, Burge 1979,\nKripke 1980). \n\nLoar then argues that internalist views that do not appeal to phenomenal consciousness fail to meet\ndesiderata (1) and (2). The first view he considers is short-arm\nfunctionalism, the view that causal interactions between brain states\ngive rise to intentionality. The second view is a version of\n the descriptivist theory of reference\n combined with short-arm functionalism about its primitive\nrepresentations. Having excluded these views, he argues that a version\nof PIT can meet his two desiderata. Phenomenal properties are\ninherently intentional in that they exhibit directedness, or purport\nto refer. Since purporting to refer is not the same thing as\nreferring, the result is non-referential mental content. This\nsatisfies the first desideratum. \n\nLoar argues that his view satisfies the second desideratum by arguing\nthat phenomenal properties do not by themselves secure reference or\ntruth-conditions. Instead, reference and truth-conditions are a matter\nof externally-determined relations, as externalists such as Putnam\n(1975), Burge (1979), and Kripke (1980) claim. However, which\nexternally-determined relations matter for reference depends on a\nsubject\u2019s non-referential internalist content. Horgan, Tienson,\n& Graham (2004) also suggest that PIT is the best available theory\nof narrow content and suggest that phenomenal intentionality can provide a basis for externalist content.\n\nAnother argument for PIT involves appeal to brain in a vat scenarios (see Loar 2003a and Horgan, Tienson & Graham 2004). A brain in a\nvat duplicate is an exact physical duplicate of a normally\nembodied human brain that is kept in a vat of life-sustaining liquids\nand is hooked up to a computer that delivers to it the same kinds of\nstimulation its embodied twin receives. It intuitively seems that a\nbrain in a vat would have a mental life \u201cmatching\u201d that of\nits embodied twin. The brain in a vat and its twin would have matching\nperceptual experiences, perceptual judgments, and beliefs. For\nexample, when the embodied twin believes that she is lying on the\nbeach sipping a frapp\u00e9, the brain in a vat twin believes that\nthey are lying on the beach sipping a frapp\u00e9. However, while\nthe normal subject\u2019s belief might be true, the envatted\nsubject\u2019s beliefs, and many other of their mental states, would\nbe false or non-veridical.\n\nFarkas (2008a) agrees with Loar and Horgan et al. (2004) that PIT is\nthe best available theory of narrow content but criticizes Loar\n(2003a) and Horgan et al. (2004) for making a concession to\nexternalism by allowing for externally-determined\nreference, truth-conditions, or broad content. Instead,\nFarkas argues that internalist, phenomenally-constituted\nintentionality is all that a theory of intentionality needs.\n\nWilson (2003) objects to Loar\u2019s appeal to brains in vats,\nclaiming that intuitions concerning them are theoretical intuitions\nand are likely to be rejected by many of PIT\u2019s opponents. \n",
