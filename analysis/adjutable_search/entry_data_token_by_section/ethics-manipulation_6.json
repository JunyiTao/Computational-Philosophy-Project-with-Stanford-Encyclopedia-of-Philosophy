    "main_text": "Answering the Identification Question || Manipulation as Pressure\n2.3 Manipulation as Pressure\n\nA third way to characterize manipulation is to treat it as a kind of\npressure to do as the influencer wishes. On this account, tactics like\nemotional blackmail and peer pressure are paradigm cases of\nmanipulation, since they exert pressure on the target by imposing\ncosts for failing to do what the manipulator wishes. One rationale for\ntreating manipulation as a form of pressure is the observation that\nmanipulation is neither rational persuasion nor coercion. It seems\nplausible, then, to suppose that there is a continuum between rational\npersuasion and coercion with regard to the level of pressure being\nexerted, with rational persuasion exerting no pressure, coercion\nexerting maximum pressure, and the middle region, manipulation,\nexerting pressure that falls short of being coercive. In this way, we\nmight arrive at the idea that manipulation is a form of pressure that\ndoes not rise to the level of coercion.\n\nOne of the earliest philosophical accounts of manipulation, by Ruth\nFaden, Tom Beauchamp, and Nancy King, has this structure. They begin\nby contrasting using rational persuasion to convince a patient to take\na medically necessary drug with simply coercing him to take it. Then\nthey observe that\n\n\nThere are many in-between cases: For example, suppose the physician\nhas made clear that he or she will be upset with the patient if the\npatient does not take the drug, and the patient is intimidated.\nAlthough the patient is not convinced that it is the best course to\ntake the medication, \u2026 the patient agrees to take the drug\nbecause it appears that acceptance will foster a better relationship\nwith the doctor\u2026 Here the patient performs the action \u2026\nunder a heavy measure of control by the physician\u2019s\nrole, authority, and indeed prescription. Unlike the first case, the\npatient does not find it overwhelmingly difficult to resist the\nphysician\u2019s proposal, but, unlike the second case, it is\nnonetheless awkward and difficult to resist this rather\n\u201ccontrolling\u201d physician. (Faden, Beauchamp, & King\n1986: 258)\n\n\nThey claim that such \u201cin between\u201d cases constitute\nmanipulation. However, they do not claim that all forms of\nmanipulation fall into the middle region of this continuum; they also\ncount forms of deception, indoctrination, and seduction as\nmanipulative, and claim that\n\n\nsome manipulative strategies can be as controlling as coercion or as\nnoncontrolling as persuasion; other manipulations fall somewhere\nbetween these endpoints. (Faden, Beauchamp, & King 1986: 259)\n\n\nNevertheless, the idea that at least some forms of manipulation\ninvolve pressure has been very influential.\n\nJoel Feinberg offers a similar account of manipulation. He writes that\nmany techniques for getting someone to act in a certain way\n\n\ncan be placed on a spectrum of force running from compulsion proper,\nat one extreme, through compulsive pressure, coercion proper, and\ncoercive pressure, to manipulation, persuasion, enticement, and simple\nrequests at the other extreme. The line between forcing to act and\nmerely getting to act is drawn somewhere in the manipulation or\npersuasion part of the scale. (Feinberg 1989: 189)\n\n\nMichael Kligman and Charles Culver offer a similar account:\n\n\nThe attempt to influence B\u2019s behavior takes on a\nmanipulative character when \u2026 A\u2019s primary intent\nis no longer to convince B, in a good faith manner, that\nacting as desired by A would be in keeping with\nB\u2019s rational assessments of outcome; [but rather] to\nprocure or engineer the needed assent by bringing pressure to bear, in\na deliberate and calculated way, on what he presume to be the\nmanipulable features of B\u2019s motivational system.\n(Kligman & Culver 1992: 186\u2013187)\n\n\nKligman and Culver go on to distinguish this manipulative pressure\nfrom coercion by claiming that the latter, unlike the former, involves\n\u201csufficiently strong incentives \u2026 that it would be\nunreasonable to expect any rational person not to so act\u201d\n(Kligman & Culver 1992: 187). More recently, Marcia Baron and\nAllen Wood have also discussed forms of manipulation that seem best\ncharacterized as forms of pressure (Baron 2003; Wood 2014).\n\nAlthough we can treat the idea that manipulation consists of a form of\npressure as a full-fledged theory of manipulation, most of the authors\njust cited hold only that some forms of manipulation consist of\npressure. In particular, most agree with Faden, Beauchamp, and King,\nthat other forms of manipulation are more akin to deception. Thus, it\nis somewhat artificial to speak of the pressure model as a theory\nmeant to cover all forms of manipulation. It is more accurate to\nregard the pressure model as claiming that exerting non-coercive\npressure is sufficient (but perhaps not necessary) for an influence to\ncount as manipulative.\n",
