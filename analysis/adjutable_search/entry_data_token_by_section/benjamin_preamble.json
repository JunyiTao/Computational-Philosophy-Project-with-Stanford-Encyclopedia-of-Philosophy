    "main_text": "\n\nWalter Benjamin\u2019s importance as a philosopher and critical\ntheorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influence\nand the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as a\nliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis of\nBenjamin\u2019s writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were a\ndecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno\u2019s conception of\nphilosophy\u2019s actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).\nIn the 1930s, Benjamin\u2019s efforts to develop a politically\noriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulus\nfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poet\nand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.\u00a0 \n\nThe delayed appearance of Benjamin\u2019s collected writings has determined\nand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volume\nselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition not\nappearing until 1972\u201389, and a 21-volume critical edition has been in production since 2008; English anthologies first appeared in\n1968 and 1978, and the four-volume Selected Writings between\n1996 and 2003.) Originally received in the context of literary\ntheory and aesthetics, only in the last decades of the 20th century did the philosophical depth and cultural breadth of Benjamin\u2019s thought begin to be fully appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literature\nthat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source of\nproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his work\nhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early German\nRomanticism. His philosophy of language has played a seminal role in translation theory. His essay on \u2018The Work of Art in the Age of Its\nTechnical Reproducibility\u2019 remains a major theoretical text for\nfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from his\nunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The Arcades\nProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory and\nphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin\u2019s messianic\nunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoretical\nfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophical\nthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in a\ncritical context, J\u00fcrgen Habermas. The \u2018Critique of\nViolence\u2019 and \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019 are\nimportant sources for Derrida\u2019s discussion of messianicity, which has\nbeen influential, along with Paul de Man\u2019s discussion of allegory, for\nthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin\u2019s writings. Aspects of\nBenjamin\u2019s thought have also been associated with a revival of\npolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true to\nthe tendencies of Benjamin\u2019s own political thought. More recently,\ninterest in Benjamin\u2019s philosophy of education has been fueled by the\ntranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and the\ntranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (Radio\nBenjamin) in 2014.\n",
