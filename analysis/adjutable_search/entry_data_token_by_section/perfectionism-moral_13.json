    "main_text": "Perfectionism in Politics || Indirect Arguments\n4. Conclusion\n\n\nPerfectionism has a distinguished pedigree in the history of ideas,\nbut like many theories in moral and political philosophy it remains\nvery much a work in progress. The topics discussed in this \nentry\u2014perfectionist value theory, perfectionist ethics and\nperfectionism as an approach to politics\u2014are subject to\non-going controversy and development. Moreover, these topics, while\ncomplementary, remain partially independent of one another. It is\npossible to affirm perfectionist ethics and reject perfectionism as an\napproach to politics. Likewise, it is possible to accept some of the\nclaims of perfectionist value theory while rejecting perfectionist\nethical and political conclusions.\n",
