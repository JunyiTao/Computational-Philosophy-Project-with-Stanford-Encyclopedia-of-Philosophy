Fallacies\n\nThe treatment of fallacies addresses one of the complementary\nconditions expressed by the definition of logic, which is supposed to\ndeal not only with what is required in order to infer correctly what\nis unknown from what is known, but also with what is required to avoid\nerror in the case of inferences that appear legitimate without being\nso. There is a parallel in the case of conception and definition:\nlogic provides rules to identify and construct definitions and at the\nsame time instructions on how to avoid common errors in the process.\nAvicenna\u2019s analysis of fallacious reasoning attempts to combine\n(or perhaps force) Aristotle\u2019s treatment from the\nSophistical Refutations into a broader scheme driven by more\nsystematic concerns, which even in the extensive treatment of the\nCure is rather compact. The analysis of error in defining is\nusually covered in connection with the Posterior Analytics and\nthe Topics (for instance at Burh\u0101n IV,\n\u011eadal, IV, Na\u011f\u0101t 149). I will focus\nhere only on the former.\n\nThe Na\u011f\u0101t treatment perfectly captures this complex\nstrategy. It starts with a canonical distinction between fallacies as\n(i) dependent on expression (laf\u1e93) or (ii) dependent on\nmeaning (ma\u02bfn\u0101)\u2014the familiar distinction\nbetween de dictione and extra dictionem\n(language-dependent and language-independent) fallacies\u2014and\npairs it with the claim that fallacies are also either dependent on\n(iii) the form or on (iv) the matter of an argument, an aspect that is\npresent also in the cursory classification given in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (Street forthcoming).\n\nThe analysis continues with an attempt to \u201cdeduct\u201d the\nfallacies based on the idea that when a false conclusion is reached,\nthen at least one of the characteristic conditions of syllogistic\nreasoning must not have been met. It then proceeds to articulate a\ndetailed account of the different ways in which failure to meet those\nconditions corresponds to different items in Aristotle\u2019s famous\nlist of thirteen fallacies, which Avicenna occasionally groups or divides in\nslightly different ways, especially in the case of those that are dependent\non expression.\n\nThe discussion ends with a recapitulation that yields something very\nclose to Aristotle\u2019s list, even though in a few cases it is hard\nto pinpoint where exactly certain items belong in the systematic\nanalysis.\n\nThe primary reasons of error may be abstracted from a strong\ncharacterization of a syllogism. If a syllogistic argument is (a)\narranged according to one of the figures and its mood is productive,\n(b) it has primary distinct parts (terms) and secondary distinct parts\n(premises), (c) its premises are true, (d) distinct from and (e)\nbetter known than the conclusion, then a true conclusion must follow.\nOtherwise, at least one of conditions (a)\u2013(e) has not been\nmet.\n\nAvicenna unequivocally identifies two of the fallacies that are not\ndependent on expression with (d) and (e), namely petitio\nprincipii (mu\u1e63\u0101dara \u02bfal\u0101\nl-ma\u1e6dl\u016bb al-awwal) and positing what is not a cause as\na cause (a\u1e2b\u1e0f or wa\u1e0d\u02bf m\u0101 laysa\nbi-\u02bfilla \u02bfillatan). The latter is identified with\ncircular proof (bay\u0101n ad-dawr), which is consistent with\nthe doctrine of Qiy\u0101s IX.4 and Burh\u0101n\nII.1.\n\nThe fallacy of consequent (\u012bh\u0101m \u02bfaks\nal-law\u0101zim or \u012bh\u0101m al-\u02bfaks) can be\ntraced back to a subdivision of (c).\n\nThe fallacy of combining many questions (\u011fam\u02bf\nal-mas\u0101\u02beil) is listed in the Na\u011f\u0101t without being discussed and it is altogether absent from the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t. In Safsa\u1e6da I.3,\nhowever, Avicenna seems to treat this case, too, as a subdivision of (c).\n\nTwo other canonical fallacies of type (ii), namely the fallacy of\naccident (m\u0101 bi-l-\u02bfara\u1e0d) and secundum\nquid (s\u016b\u02be i\u02bftib\u0101r al-\u1e25aml or\ni\u0121f\u0101l taw\u0101bi\u02bf al-\u1e25aml) are listed\nat the end of the Na\u011f\u0101t section without being discussed, although\nthey, too, may presumably be classified as subdivisions of (c), namely\nerrors based on taking a premise to be true which merely appears to be\ntrue.\n\nThe case of ignoratio elenchi is more problematic. The last\navailable slot in the Na\u011f\u0101t list is called\n\u201csterility of the connection\u201d (\u02bfaqm\nal-qar\u012bna) and is seemingly not discussed in the preceding\nanalysis. A possibility is to associate it with case (a), namely with\nthe error resulting from failing to recognize an argument as invalid,\nwhich would however distort the original Aristotelian meaning. It may\nbe that Avicenna fails (or refuses) to recognize ignoratio\nelenchi in Aristotle\u2019s sense and perhaps turns into\nsomething like the error resulting from a lack of awareness of the form of\nthe syllogism, which leads to accept an invalid argument as valid.\nThis would be consistent with the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nvocabulary, which introduces the \u201cignorance of the\ncomposition\u201d (\u01e7ahl at-ta\u02bfl\u012bf) as a\nfallacy while at the same time failing to mention ignoratio\nelenchi.\n\nIn the Na\u011f\u0101t, fallacies dependent on expressions\nseem to be variously associated with cases (a)\u2013(c). Avicenna\ndivides this category into two main sub-cases involving (i) a\nsimple expression (laf\u1e93 mufrad) or (ii) a compound\nexpression (laf\u1e93 murakkab).\n\nIn case (i), error may result from the association of multiple\nmeanings with an expression either in its core form\n(\u011fawhar) or in a derivative form (hay\u02bea).\nThe first case is proper equivocation (i\u0161tir\u0101k\nal-ism) (even though Avicenna uses the term also to refer\ngenerically to other types of language-dependent fallacies) and is in\nfact divided into a number of different sub-types (laf\u1e93\nmu\u0161tarak, mu\u0161akkak, muta\u0161\u0101bih, laf\u1e93\nmanq\u016bl, musta\u02bf\u0101r, ma\u011f\u0101z). The second\ncase is where Avicenna puts the counterpart of the fallacies of accent\nand form of expression (or inflection).\n\nCase (ii) includes the canonical fallacies of composition\n(tark\u012bb al-laf\u1e93) and division\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl al-laf\u1e93).\n\nThe case of amphiboly (judging from the examples) seems to be treated\nas an independent type, associated with (b), but its omission in the\nfinal Na\u011f\u0101t list may suggest that Avicenna, in line with what he does in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, possibly regards it as a sub-type of\nequivocation.\n\nThe treatment of fallacies is complemented by a parallel\nclassification of fallacious assertions (propositions that are deemed\nto be true because of a systematic error in their evaluation)\nconsistently discussed throughout Avicenna\u2019s logical works\n(e.g., Burh\u0101n I.4, I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nI.6).\nAbbreviations\n\nI use standard abbreviations for quantified categorical propositions:\na-, e-, i-, and o-propositions (universal affirmative, universal\nnegative, particular affirmative, and particular negative).\n\n\nAaB\n \u201cEvery A is B\u201d\n (kull A B)\n\nAeB\n \u201cNo A is B\u201d\n (l\u0101 \u0161ay\u02be min A B)\n\nAiB\n \u201cSome A is B\u201d\n (ba\u02bf\u1e0d A B)\n\nAoB \n\u201cNot every A is B\u201d \n(laysa kull A B)\n\n\nIn the case of modalized categoricals, the modality is prefixed (for\nthe one-sided absolute proposition, I omit the identifier X1\nunless required to avoid ambiguity).\nA full list of abbreviations is given below. For example, Ld1-AaB\nstands for \u201cEvery A is\nnecessarily B as long as it is A\u201d, M1-AiB\nfor \u201cSome A is possibly\nB\u201d, and A-AeB for \u201cNo A is ever\nB\u201d.\n\nIn the case of hypotheticals, I indicate first between parentheses\nquantification and type (conditional or disjunctive), followed by an\nindication of the quality and quantity of the parts (or, when the latter is not required, by simple propositional variables); in some cases the syntactic structure of an embedded categorical is made explicit in the above canonical form. Below are a few examples of expressions frequently used in this entry:\n\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa\n \u201cAlways, if every A is B, then every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ia\n \u201cNever, if some A is B, then every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))oe\n \u201cSometimes, if not every A is B, then no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ee\n \u201cNot always, if no A is B, then no C is\nD\u201d\n\n\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))aa\n \u201cAlways, either every A is B or every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(e-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))ia \n\u201cNever, either some A is B or every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(i-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))oe\n \u201cSometimes, either not every A is B or no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))ee \n\u201cNot always, either no A is B or no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq\n \u201cAlways, if p, then q\u201d\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))p-AaB\n \u201cAlways, if p, then every A is B\u201d\n\n\nOccasionally, a more fine-grained distinction between types of\nconditionals (luz\u016bm\u012b or ittif\u0101q\u012b) or types of disjunctions (exclusive and\nexhaustive; exclusive but non-exhaustive; inclusive) is required.\nSimilarly, it is sometimes necessary to identify antecedents and\nconsequents of conditionals (for conversion and inferential relations\nwith disjunctions). In such cases the above abbreviations are expanded\nto include the required additional information. For instance to\nexpress the claim that a universal affirmative exclusive and\nexhaustive disjunction implies a universal affirmative\nluz\u016bm\u012b conditional in which antecedent and\nconsequent are contradictories and may be any of the parts of the\ndisjunctive, I will write that\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1)a1a2 implies\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a1o2,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a2o1,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o1a2, and\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o2a1, where superscript\n\u201cl\u201d stands for luz\u016bm\u012b, and the\nsuperscript numbers are used to track the disjuncts where they appear\nas antecedent or consequent of the conditional statements.\n",
