    "main_text": "The Argument For Fictionalism || Premise (5) and Platonism\n1.5 Premise (5) and Platonism\n\nIf the arguments given so far are correct, then the only remaining\nviews\u2014the only philosophies of mathematics that haven\u2019t\nbeen ruled out\u2014are platonism and fictionalism. Thus, to complete\ntheir argument, fictionalists need merely to provide an argument for\npremise (5); in other words, they just need to argue against\nplatonism. But this turns out to be a lot harder than arguing against\nthe various non-fictionalistic versions of anti-platonism considered\nabove. As we\u2019ve seen, fictionalists can argue against those\nviews by simply motivating a series of empirical hypotheses about\nordinary mathematical discourse and the ordinary meaning of the word\n\u2018true\u2019. More specifically, fictionalists can argue against\nthese views by arguing that (a) ordinary mathematical utterances are\nbest interpreted at face value, and (b) these utterances cannot\nplausibly be interpreted as being about physical or mental objects,\nand (c) sentences of the form \u2018The object a is an\nF\u2019 cannot be true, in the ordinary sense of the term,\nunless there really is such a thing as a. But fictionalists\ncannot argue against platonism in anything like this way, because\nfictionalists and platonists are in agreement about the meanings of\nordinary mathematical utterances (and the word \u2018true\u2019).\nIndeed, platonists and fictionalists don\u2019t disagree about\nany semantic theses. Their disagreement is about an\nontological thesis: platonists believe in abstract objects,\nwhereas fictionalists do not. Thus, if fictionalists are going to\nargue against platonism, they\u2019re going to have to use a\ndifferent kind of argument.\n\nThere are a few different arguments that have been brought against\nmathematical platonism, but the most important\u2014and the most\nfamous\u2014is what is known as the epistemological argument\nagainst platonism. This argument goes back at least to Plato. In\ncontemporary times, it received its most classical statement in a\npaper by Paul Benacerraf (1973), although most philosophers of\nmathematics agree that Benacerraf\u2019s formulation of the argument\nis problematic because of its reliance on an implausible causal theory\nof knowledge. A better way to formulate the argument is as\nfollows:\n\nHuman beings exist entirely within spacetime.\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then they exist\noutside of spacetime. Therefore, it seems likely that\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then human\nbeings could not attain knowledge of them. But\nIt\u2019s built into the platonistic view that there do exist\nabstract objects and that human beings can acquire knowledge of them\n(after all, according to platonism, mathematical knowledge just\nis knowledge of abstract objects). Therefore,\nPlatonism is false.\n\n\nPlatonists have tried to respond to this argument in a few different\nways, but the most popular (and, it can be argued, the most plausible)\nresponse is to try to undermine the inference from (i) and (ii) to\n(iii) by explaining how (iii) could be false even if (i) and (ii) are\ntrue\u2014i.e., how human beings could acquire knowledge of abstract\nobjects despite the fact that they are causally isolated from such\nobjects and, hence, do not have any information-transferring\ncontact with such objects. This strategy of response has been\npursued by Quine (1948, 1951), Steiner (1975), Katz (1981, 1998),\nResnik (1982, 1997), Shapiro (1989, 1997), Lewis (1986), Linsky and\nZalta (1995), Balaguer (1995, 1998a), and Linnebo (2006). The question\nof whether any of these responses succeeds is extremely controversial\namong philosophers of mathematics. Moreover, anti-platonists do not\nhave any compelling argument for the thesis that platonists\ncouldn\u2019t provide the required explanation\nhere\u2014i.e., that they couldn\u2019t explain how human beings\ncould acquire knowledge of abstract objects without the aid of any\ninformation-transferring contact with such objects. Thus, to make a\nvery long story short, it seems fair to say that the epistemological\nargument against platonism is, at best, controversial and\ninconclusive.\n\n(For a more complete discussion of the epistemological argument\nagainst platonism, including discussions of the various responses that\nplatonists have attempted, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy entry entitled \u201cPlatonism in\nMetaphysics\u201d.)\n\nGiven that the epistemological argument does not succeed in refuting\nplatonism, fictionalists might attempt to provide some other argument\nagainst platonism. One such argument that has received considerable\nattention is the multiple-reductions argument. The classical\nstatement of this argument is given, once again, by Benacerraf (1965).\nThe argument can be run in connection with any of our mathematical\ntheories, but the point is usually made in connection with arithmetic.\nMoreover, even when we zero in on arithmetic, there are still many\ndifferent ways to formulate the argument. One way to do this is as\nfollows: (A) if there are any sequences of abstract objects that\nsatisfy our arithmetical theories, then there are infinitely many, and\nthere is nothing \u201cmetaphysically special\u201d about any of\nthese sequences that makes it stand out as the sequence of\nnatural numbers; but (B) platonism is committed to the thesis that\nthere is a unique sequence of abstract objects that is the natural\nnumbers. Therefore, (C) platonism is false.\n\nPlatonists have offered numerous responses to this argument. Probably\nthe most common strategy has been to reject (A), i.e., to argue that\nplatonists can in fact defend the claim that there is a unique\nsequence that stands out as the sequence of natural numbers.\nThis strategy has been pursued in different ways by, e.g., Resnik\n(1997), Shapiro (1997), Parsons (1990), and Linsky and Zalta (1995).\nMoreover, Balaguer (1998a) argues that even if (A) is true, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter, because (B) is false: platonists can simply\nadmit that there are numerous sequences that satisfy our arithmetical\ntheories and that it may be that none of them stands out as the one\nand only sequence of natural numbers. There is no widespread agreement\non the status of these platonistic responses, and so, as is the case\nwith the epistemological argument, it would be extremely\ncontroversial, if not downright implausible, to claim that the\nmultiple-reductions argument refutes platonism.\n\nAside from this, the only argument against platonism that has received\nmuch attention in the philosophy of mathematics is an\nOckham\u2019s-razor-based argument. We will return to this argument\n(very briefly) in section 3; for now, we can simply note that, like\nthe epistemological argument and the multiple-reductions argument, the\nOckham\u2019s-razor-based argument is very controversial, and the\nclaim that this argument refutes platonism is (at the very least)\ntendentious. Thus, the overall conclusion that we seem led to here is\nthis: even if fictionalists can motivate the platonist/fictionalist\nsemantics of mathematical discourse and, thus, eliminate all of the\nanti-platonistic alternatives to fictionalism, they do not have any\nreally compelling argument against platonism, or for the conclusion\nthat fictionalism is superior to platonism. In other words,\nfictionalists don\u2019t have any compelling argument for premise\n(5), and so the positive argument for their view is, at best,\nincomplete.\n",
