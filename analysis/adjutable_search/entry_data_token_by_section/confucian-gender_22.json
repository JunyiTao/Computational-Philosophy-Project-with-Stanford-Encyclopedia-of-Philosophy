    "main_text": "Confucian Feminism: A Hybrid Feminist Theory || Relational Personhood and Dependency Care\n7.4 Ren as Feminist Care\n\nSome early critics of care ethics have pointed out that by advocating\nfor a care-based approach to ethics by itself doesn\u2019t make it\nfeminist, since it might well exacerbate the demand for caring labor\non women (Card 1990; Friedman 1993; Yuan 2002). In Confucian feminism,\nthis imbalance in caring labor is addressed through the substitution\nof the gender-based division of labor in marriage on the basis of\nnei-wai with friendship. Without gender-based hierarchy or\nthe gender-based division of labor on the basis of nei-wai,\nthis Confucian model not only provides a flexible arrangement for both\nmen and women to assume different caring responsibilities, but also\nguards against a one-sided demand for self-sacrifice. Since a mutual\ncommitment to moral perfectibility is the anchor of Confucian\nfriendship, exploitation and moral degradation characteristic in many\noppressive relationships would also be contrary to a friendship-based\nmarriage where caring labor is performed for the sake of propelling\neach other to moral perfectibility, not for the sake of fulfilling the\ngender-based division of labor or gender-based hierarchy.\n\nOnce the gender-based division of labor and hierarchy is removed from\nthe performance of caring labor, Confucian feminism can move forward\nwith its moral affirmation of the importance of caring for others,\nespecially those who cannot care for themselves. This pronouncement is\nfeminist because not only is it morally sound, but because, as a\nfeminist, one should be committed to creating a more caring and\nequitable world not just for oneself but for those who need it most.\nNo feminist, as Eva Kittay argues, would, could, or should advocate\nfor voluntary abandonment of the old, the young, the sick, or the\ndisabled, let it be under the pretext of the pursuit of equality or\nfairness (Kittay 2002: 238). If feminists abandon those who cannot\nhelp themselves, then the focus on one\u2019s liberation from\ngender-based oppression rings hollow.\n\nAs in Confucianism where morality is deeply embedded in the\ncultivation of one\u2019s relational personhood, feminism should also\nlive up to the basic moral decency of being responsive to the needy,\nfirst, in one\u2019s family and then concentrically radiating to the\nworld at large. There should be no chasm between being a feminist and\nbeing a morally responsive person to those who cannot care for\nthemselves from near to afar. Confucian feminism\u2014a hybrid\naccount of a feminist theory in a Confucian framework\u2014is\ncommitted to creating an ever more inclusive and compassionate world\nthrough a ren-based self-cultivation and through a\nren-based political governance.\n\nThe caricature of Confucianism as synonymous with patriarchy and a\nbackwater ideology need not persist. With the rise of the field of\ncomparative feminist studies on Confucianism, it is now also possible\nto imagine a hybrid Confucian-feminist theory to address women\u2019s\nissues, concerns, and experiences. This tentative theoretical\nconstruct of Confucian feminism is here to serve as a facilitator to\nspur further positive engagement between the Chinese-comparative\ncommunities and the feminist communities to not only expand the range\nof our understanding of gender oppression in the lives of women, but\nalso provide women with viable conceptual tools going beyond the\nconfine of the western philosophical canon to articulate their own\nvision of a liberating future.\n",
