    "main_text": "Theories of Adjudication || Adjudication in Policy Analysis\n5.2 Adjudication in Policy Analysis\n\nThe normative theory of adjudication implicit in both policy analysis\nand doctrinal analysis follows from Posner\u2019s early claim that\nthe common law ought to be efficient. The theories are essentially\nidentical. The two projects differ only in the seriousness with which\nthey take actual behavior. Policy analysis rests on the behavioral\nclaim and hence must look to the actual behavior induced by legal\nrules, while doctrinal analysis often seems to rely only on\n\u201cefficiency\u201d within some specified model.\n\nA normative theory of adjudication was among the earliest claims\nadvanced in the economic analysis of law. Posner [1973, 1979, 1980,\n1985, 1990, 1995] asserted claim VI in the introduction: the common\nlaw ought to be efficient. He interpreted efficiency as\n\u201cwealth maximization\u201d but then interpreted wealth\nmaximization as \u201cwillingness to pay.\u201d This interpretive\nstance yielded an argument that judges in (common law) cases ought to\nchoose the legal rule that maximized the ratio of benefits to costs as\nmeasured by the sum of individual willingnesses to pay.\n\nPosner\u2019s claim evoked great controversy in the late 1970s and\nearly 1980s. (See, e.g., Symposium [1980].) Twenty years\nlater, Kaplow and Shavell [2001] revived and revised Posner\u2019s\nclaim. The revision had two components. First, and most importantly,\nthey chose welfarism generally rather than cost-benefit\nanalysis in particular as the normative basis for adjudication.\nWelfarism requires that evaluation depend solely on the well-being of\nindividuals. Cost-benefit analysis is thus a form of welfarist\nevaluation; but Kaplow and Shavell\u2019s argument allows them to\navoid various criticisms of cost-benefit analysis. Second, Kaplow and\nShavell do not argue primarily for a normative theory of adjudication.\nRather, they contend that evaluation of legal rules and institutions\nby scholars ought to be welfarist. They suggest, however, that judges\nby and large have the same evaluative obligation as the third-party\nanalyst.\n5.2.1 A brief critique of cost-benefit analysis as a theory of adjudication\n\nCost-benefit analysis attempts to implement a Kaldor-Hicks evaluative\ncriterion. According to the Kaldor-Hicks criterion, a distribution of\ngoods (broadly understood) X is superior to a distribution of\ngoods Y if and only if there exists a third distribution of\ngoods Z such that (a) Z is a redistribution of the\ndistribution X; and (b) Z is Pareto preferred to\n Y.[25]\n\nCost-benefit analysis proceeds in two steps. First, for each\nindividual, it identifies a particular representation of the\nindividual\u2019s ordinal ranking of the options open to the policy\nmaker. Second, it aggregates these representations of each\nindividual\u2019s preferences into a social ranking.\n\nThe first step is unproblematic. Consider agent K. K\nhas preferences over states of the world. A representation of these\npreferences begins with a baseline policy and ranks all policies\nrelative to the baseline. Specifically, it assigns a number to each\nstate of the world such that K prefers state X to\nstate Y if and only if the number assigned to state\nX is higher than the number assigned to state Y.\nCost-benefit analysis defines states of the world as (policy, wealth)\npairs and defines the agent\u2019s willingness to pay for a move from\nstate X to Y as the change in wealth in state\nY that would the agent indifferent to the state X.\nThis procedure thus links the range of numbers that the agent may\nassign to the agent\u2019s wealth as willingness to pay is defined in\npart in terms of the agent\u2019s ability to\n pay.[26]\n The procedure for assigning numbers on the basis of an\nindividual\u2019s willingness to pay in fact yields a representation\nof that agent\u2019s preferences. Willingness to pay is a utility\nfunction that accurately represents the agent\u2019s (ordinal)\npreferences over states. Notice, however, that, if the agent chooses a\ndifferent baseline policy, the numbers, though ordered identically,\nwill not be the same as those derived from the original baseline. (One\nsees this immediately when one notes that the baseline policy always\nreceive a value 0.)\n\nThe second step of cost-benefit analysis is more problematic. To\naggregate the individual willingnesses to pay, cost-benefit analysis\nsimply sums the individual willingnesses to pay. One can see\nimmediately several difficulties with this procedure. First, each\nranking is ordinal; the numbers have no significance beyond the order.\nSuppose that, using the status quo Q as a baseline, K assigns\na number 2 to policy X, a number 4 to policy Y and a\nnumber 16 to policy Z while, when using policy P as a\nbaseline, she assigns a number 3 to policy X, a number 9 to\npolicy Y and a number 27 to policy Z. As the\nrepresentations are ordinal, one cannot conclude anything about\nK\u2019s intensity of preference; her Q-based representation\nof her preferences \u201cassesses\u201d the difference between\nZ and Y as six times the difference between\nY and X while her P-based representation of her\npreferences thinks the difference between Z and Y is\nonly three times the difference between Y and X. not\nprefer Z to Y. The choice of baseline may thus\naffect the choice of policy.\n\nSecond, cost-benefit analysis adopts a method of interpersonal\ncomparisons of well-being that is particularly unconvincing.\nInterpersonal comparison of well-being requires that one identify the\nappropriate representation of each individual\u2019s preference\nordering and compare those representations. Cost-benefit analysis,\nhowever, does not identify representations on moral or political\ngrounds; rather it chooses the representations that contingently arise\nfrom the actual distribution of wealth and income in the\n society.[27]\n If Tom is poor while Bill is wealthy, it is unclear why the\nrepresentations of the well-being of each that derives from\nwillingness to pay provide interpersonally comparable measures.\nEqually, if Tom and Bill are equally wealthy but Tom is disabled and\nBill is not, the willingness to pay of each may still not be\ninterpersonally comparable.\n5.2.2 A Structural Critique of Welfarist theories of adjudication.\n\nOne might construct a normative theory of adjudication at either of\ntwo levels. First, one might take as given the general structure of\nadjudication within a particular judicial system and ask what\nobligations the judges within that system ought to have. Second, one\nmight more fundamentally design the judicial system from scratch. On\nthis second account, the institutional environment in which judges act\nas well as the obligations of judges within that institutional\nenvironment would be subject to evaluation.\n\nMost normative theories of adjudication are of the first type. They\ntake the institutional structure in which adjudication occurs largely\nas given and then identify the obligations of judges within that\nsystem. Phrased differently, normative theories of adjudication are\ninterpretive of an ongoing practice rather than efforts to design a\npractice from scratch. Welfarist theories of adjudication face several\ndifficulties when understood as interpretive theories of existing\n(common law)\n practice.[28]\n\nFirst, the structure of adjudication does not generally provide\nadequate or appropriate information for the selection of rules that\nmaximize social welfare. Adjudication in a common law system usually\nfocuses on a past transaction between particular parties. This\ntransaction may not be typical of transactions that were litigated; it\ncertainly will not be typical of the entire population of transactions\nthat a rule would govern. Under a given rule, for instance, the set of\ntransactions that do not lead to litigation are likely to differ\nsystematically from the set of transactions that do give rise to\nlitigation. Equally important, different legal rules are apt to\ngenerate different sets of transactions. The current structure of\nadjudication does not provide any information that would help a\ndecision maker assess these differences across potential legal\nrules.\n\nSecond, the selection procedure for judges does not identify\nindividuals with the appropriate training and background to make\naccurate calculations of social welfare. Judges in common law\ncountries have generally not been trained systematically in economics\nand statistics, two disciplines necessary (but not sufficient) for the\ndetermination of social welfare under alternative legal rules.\n\nThird, and related, judges usually face severe constraints in the set\nof legal rules they may consider in any adjudication. When confronted\nby a tort case, for example, the court usually considers a limited\nnumber of legal regimes; perhaps it will reformulate the standard of\ncare or shift from a regime of negligence to one of strict liability.\nA court, however, is unlikely to adopt a complex scheme of no-fault\ninsurance or to impose a different insurance scheme, even though these\nmore radical transformations of social institutions would provide\nhigher overall welfare.\n",
