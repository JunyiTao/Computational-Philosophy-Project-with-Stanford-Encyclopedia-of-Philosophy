    "main_text": "Naturalism and Holism\n3. Naturalism and Holism\n\nAlthough both premises of the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument\nhave been questioned, it\u2019s the first premise that is most\nobviously in need of support. This support comes from the doctrines of\nnaturalism and holism. \n\nFollowing Quine, naturalism is usually taken to be the philosophical\ndoctrine that there is no first philosophy and that the philosophical\nenterprise is continuous with the scientific enterprise (Quine 1981b).\nBy this Quine means that philosophy is neither prior to nor privileged\nover science. What is more, science, thus construed (i.e. with\nphilosophy as a continuous part) is taken to be the complete story of\nthe world. This doctrine arises out of a deep respect for scientific\nmethodology and an acknowledgment of the undeniable success of this\nmethodology as a way of answering fundamental questions about all\nnature of things. As Quine suggests, its source lies in\n\u201cunregenerate realism, the robust state of mind of the natural\nscientist who has never felt any qualms beyond the negotiable\nuncertainties internal to science\u201d (Quine 1981b, p. 72). For the\nmetaphysician this means looking to our best scientific theories to\ndetermine what exists, or, perhaps more accurately, what we ought to\nbelieve to exist. In short, naturalism rules out unscientific ways of\ndetermining what exists. For example, naturalism rules out believing\nin the transmigration of souls for mystical reasons. Naturalism would\nnot, however, rule out the transmigration of souls if our best\nscientific theories were to require the truth of this\n doctrine.[4]\n\n\nNaturalism, then, gives us a reason for believing in the entities in\nour best scientific theories and no other entities. Depending on\nexactly how you conceive of naturalism, it may or may not tell you\nwhether to believe in all the entities of your best\nscientific theories. We take it that naturalism does give us\nsome reason to believe in all such entities, but that this is\ndefeasible. This is where holism comes to the fore: in particular,\nconfirmational holism.\n\nConfirmational holism is the view that theories are confirmed or\ndisconfirmed as wholes (Quine 1980b, p. 41). So, if a theory is\nconfirmed by empirical findings, the whole theory is\nconfirmed. In particular, whatever mathematics is made use of in the\ntheory is also confirmed (Quine 1976, pp. 120\u2013122). Furthermore,\nit is the same evidence that is appealed to in justifying belief in\nthe mathematical components of the theory that is appealed to in\njustifying the empirical portion of the theory (if indeed the\nempirical can be separated from the mathematical at all). Naturalism\nand holism taken together then justify\n P1.\n Roughly, naturalism gives us the \u201conly\u201d and holism gives\nus the \u201call\u201d in P1.\n\nIt is worth noting that in Quine\u2019s writings there are at least\ntwo holist themes. The first is the confirmational holism discussed\nabove (often called the Quine-Duhem thesis). The other is semantic\nholism which is the view that the unit of meaning is not the single\nsentence, but systems of sentences (and in some extreme cases the\nwhole of language). This latter holism is closely related to\nQuine\u2019s well-known denial of the analytic-synthetic distinction\n(Quine 1980b) and his equally famous indeterminacy of translation\nthesis (Quine 1960). Although for Quine, semantic holism and\nconfirmational holism are closely related, there is good reason to\ndistinguish them, since the former is generally thought to be highly\ncontroversial while the latter is considered relatively\nuncontroversial.\n\nWhy this is important to the present debate is that Quine explicitly\ninvokes the controversial semantic holism in support of the\nindispensability argument (Quine 1980b, pp. 45\u201346). Most\ncommentators, however, are of the view that only confirmational holism\nis required to make the indispensability argument fly (see, for\nexample, Colyvan (1998a); Field (1989, pp. 14\u201320); Hellman\n(1999); Resnik (1995a; 1997); Maddy (1992)) and my presentation here\nfollows that accepted wisdom. It should be kept in mind, however, that\nwhile the argument, thus construed, is Quinean in flavor it is not,\nstrictly speaking, Quine\u2019s argument.\n",
