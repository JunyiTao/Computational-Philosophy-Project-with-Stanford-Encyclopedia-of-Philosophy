    "main_text": "From Languages of Art to Reconceptions: New Looks at Aesthetic Issues || Pictorial Representation\n4.1 Pictorial Representation\n\nLanguages of Art prompted a lively debate especially\nconcerning Goodman\u2019s claims about the nature of pictorial\nrepresentation, or depiction. According to Goodman, the symbolic\nfunction that is distinctive of pictures is denotation (1976, Chap.\n1)\u2014hence pictures are labels and in that respect are analogous\nto linguistic predicates. The characteristics that distinguish\npictorial systems from other denotational systems (e.g., from natural\nlanguages) make them the very opposite of a notation: pictorial\nsystems are dense throughout and in that respect are similar to other\nanalog systems, such as those of diagrams and maps (1976,\n194\u2013198; Goodman, Elgin 1988, Chap. 7).\n\nAt a first approximation, Goodman\u2019s claim that \u201cdenotation\nis the core of representation\u201d (1976, 5) means that pictures are\npictorial labels for their subjects, individuals or sets of\nindividuals, analogously to how names, or predicates, or verbal\ndescriptions are linguistic labels for their denotata. Yet, of course,\nnot all pictures that have a subject\u2014i.e., all pictures that are\nrepresentational, versus images that are non-representational or\nabstract\u2014have an actual individual as their subject. Some\npictures have just a generic subject (say, a picture of a man, in the\nsense of a picture of no man in particular), others have a fictional\nsubject (a picture of a unicorn, for example). Goodman\u2019s account\nof such cases is in terms of multiple denotation for the\nformer and null denotation for the latter. Some\npictures\u2014exemplary is an illustration of an eagle placed, in a\ndictionary, next to the definition of the word\n\u201ceagle\u201d\u2014refer, severally, to all the members of a\ngiven set, such as the set of eagles. Other pictures, such as pictures\nof unicorns, refer to nothing, since there are no unicorns in reality:\nthey have null denotation. Goodman insists that the existence of\npictures with null denotation does not represent a problem for the\nview that claims that \u201cdenotation is the core of\nrepresentation.\u201d Such pictures are, of course, to be\ndistinguished from other pictures with null denotation, such as\npictures of Pegasus or of Pickwick. Yet, they are so distinguished in\nbeing pictures of a certain\nkind\u2014unicorn-pictures\u2014classified differently from pictures\nof other kinds, such as Pegasus-pictures or Pickwick-pictures.\n\nHence, Goodman appears to analyze pictorial representation as an\nambiguous concept, ambiguous, that is, between a denotational sense\n(\u201cis a picture of a so-and-so\u201d) and a non-denotational\nsense (\u201cis a so-and-so-picture\u201d). This may be seen as a\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cperceptual\u201d theories of\ndepiction such as those proposed, for instance, by Richard Wollheim\n(1987) and Kendall Walton (1990) (cf. Robinson 2000). Yet concerns on\nGoodman\u2019s treating the concept of depiction as ambiguous are\nmisplaced, for the phrase \u201cpicture of\u201d and its cognates\ncan be easily shown to admit two different interpretations. What can\nbe called the phrase\u2019s relational sense has to do with\nwhat, if anything, a picture refers to; the non-relational\nsense, instead, has to do with, as Goodman would say, the sort of\npicture it is, or better with the picture\u2019s depictive content\n(see, e.g., Budd 1993). Indeed, Goodman is right in claiming that,\nwith any picture, there are always two questions: one, what the\npicture represents, if anything; two, what kind of picture it is\n(1976, 31). Rather, a much more real problem with Goodman\u2019s\ntheory derives from his not addressing some of the most fundamental\nquestions regarding depiction. Goodman articulates his account of\nrelational depiction in some detail: pictures are symbols in symbol\nsystems that are devoted to denotation (although their members may\nhave individual, multiple, or null denotation) and that have certain\n(primarily) syntactic characteristics. Yet, Goodman has nothing to say\non why certain pictures denote what they do. Lacking a theory of\npictorial reference is no oversight on the part of the philosopher\nhowever. The fact is that Goodman is interested in investigating the\n\u201croutes\u201d of reference (1981a)\u2014how symbols can denote\nor exemplify or refer in more complex and indirect ways. He is not\ninterested in the origins, or \u201croots,\u201d of\nreference\u2014hence, with regard to pictures, in how certain marks\nand not others have become commonly correlated with certain kinds of\nitems in the world. This is as much true of what pictures are labels\nfor as of which labels apply to pictures, that is, of how they are\nclassified. Hence, it turns out, Goodman also has not much to say on\nthe non-relational sense of depiction, i.e., with what makes a picture\nthe sort of picture it is (e.g., a man-picture or a unicorn-picture or\na so-and-so-picture). Why pictures are classified in certain\nways\u2014as unicorn-pictures, man-pictures, and so\non\u2014ultimately, is a matter of entrenchment of certain predicates\nout of the many predicates available. Given the actual history of the\nuse of our symbols, certain pictorial labels (i.e., pictures) are\nprojected rather than others, and certain verbal labels are projected\nover those pictorial labels. Accordingly, for the most part,\nGoodman\u2019s theory of depiction is better seen for what it has to\ntell us on its own terms\u2014in general, on what distinguishes\npictorial symbols from symbols of other sorts.\n\nPictures are distinguished from symbols of other sorts in virtue of\nthe distinguishing characteristics of pictorial symbol systems. In\nparticular, pictorial symbol systems are syntactically and\nsemantically dense. That is, given any two marks, no\nmatter how small the difference between them, they could be\ninstantiating two different characters, and given any two characters,\nno matter how small the difference between them, they may have\ndifferent referents (Goodman 1976, 226\u2013227; Goodman, Elgin 1988,\nChap. 7). Hence, pictures are grouped together with such things as\ndiagrams, ungraduated instruments of measurement, and maps\u2014with\nthose symbols, that is, for which, in simpler words, any difference\nmay make a difference: any difference in a mark may correspond to a\ndifferent character, and any difference in the character may stand for\na different correlation to the field of reference. Even a simple\npicture, for Goodman, is dense, in the sense that any, however small,\nmark on the canvas may turn out being relevant to pictorial meaning.\nWhatever the merits of, or problems with, Goodman\u2019s technical\nanalysis, the notion of density is certainly one way to account for\nwhat other thinkers\u2014most notably Kendall Walton\n(1990)\u2014have referred to as an \u201copenendedness\u201d in the\ninvestigation of pictures.\n\nOf course, as pictures are likened to such things as diagrams, they\nalso need to be distinguished from them. Goodman\u2019s claim is that\nthe difference between pictures and diagrams is syntactic, i.e., has\nto do with the composition of the characters or symbols. Pictorial\nsymbol systems, when compared to diagrammatic systems, tend to be\nrelatively replete. That is, to the interpretation of a\npicture typically a larger number of features is relevant than to the\ninterpretation of a non-pictorial dense system. A drawing by Hokusai\nmay be made of the same marks as an electrocardiogram. Yet, while in a\nlinear diagram as the electrocardiogram only relative distances from\nthe originating point of the line matter, in the drawing a higher\nnumber of features\u2014color, thickness, intensity, contrast,\netc.\u2014are relevant (Goodman 1976, 229\u2013230). Diagrams\ntypically are relatively \u201cattenuated.\u201d Accordingly, the\ndifference between diagrams and pictures is only a matter of\ndegree: typically, with a picture a smaller number of\nfeatures can be dismissed as contingent or irrelevant.\n\nThere is indeed more that can be found in Languages of Art\nregarding depiction, and indirectly regarding the notion of being a\nso-and-so-picture or a such-and-such-picture. An important part of\nGoodman\u2019s view on depiction is his critique of the idea that\nresemblance is the distinguishing feature of this sort of\nsymbolization. While Goodman may appear to be, and is usually\ndiscussed as, criticizing the resemblance theory of pictorial\nrepresentation\u2014the \u201cmost na\u00efve view of\nrepresentation\u201d (1976, 3)\u2014his real target is indeed much\nbroader than that. After all, of the resemblance view he also claims\nthat \u201cvestiges\u201d of it, \u201cwith assorted refinements,\npersist in most writing on representation\u201d (1976, 3). What\nmainly concerns Goodman in Languages of Art is to establish\nthe symbolic, and hence ultimately conventional, nature of\npictorial representation\u2014is to draw similarities between\npictorial and nonpictorial forms of symbolization. With regard to\nresemblance, Languages of Art echoes the claim in Fact,\nFiction, and Forecast with regard to regularities: resemblances\ncan be found anywhere, for anything resembles anything else in some\nrespect or other. Hence, Goodman does not deny the existence of\nresemblances between a picture and its subject, rather he claims that\nwhich resemblances are going to be noticed depends on what the system\nof correlation employed makes relevant. To Goodman, pictorial\nrepresentation is always relative to the conceptual framework (that\nis, to the system of classification) within which a picture should be\ninterpreted, in the same way in which vision is relative to the\nconceptual frameworks with which one approaches the visual world. On\nperception, Languages of Art echoes what Goodman had already\nclaimed in his 1960 review of Ernst Gombrich\u2019s Art and\nIllusion: \u201cThat we know what we see is no truer than we see\nwhat we know. Perception depends heavily on conceptual schemata\u201d\n(Goodman 1972, 142). Thinking that vision may ever take place\nindependently of all conceptualization is to rely on the \u201cmyth\nof the innocent eye\u201d: \u201cthere is no innocent eye\n[\u2026]. Not only how but what [the eye] sees is regulated by need\nand prejudice. [The eye] selects, rejects, organizes, associates,\nclassifies, analyzes, constructs\u201d (Goodman 1976, 7\u20138).\n\nAccordingly, realism in pictorial representations is reduced\nto a matter of habit or familiarity, in contrast not\nonly to a resemblance account of realism but to accounts in terms of\namount or accuracy of conveyed information as well. Realistic pictures\ncan include inaccuracies\u2014indeed, those used in games of the type\n\u201cfind the n mistakes in the picture\u201d include\ninaccuracies by definition (Goodman 1984, 127). And the amount of\ninformation is not altered, for instance, by switching from the\nrealistic mode of representation of conventional perspective to the\nnon-realistic mode of, say, reverse perspective (Goodman 1976, 35).\nGoodman\u2019s conventionalism is pervasive and uncompromising: even\nthe rules of perspective in the representation of space, he claims,\nare conventionally established, and provide only a\nrelative\u2014i.e., relative to culturally established conceptual\nschemata\u2014standard of fidelity (1976, 10\u201319). Realistic\npaintings, drawings, etc. are those that are painted or drawn in a\nfamiliar style, i.e., according to a familiar system of correlation.\nTo put it metaphorically, for Goodman, you always need a key to read a\npicture\u2014sometimes the key is more ready at hand, part of\none\u2019s cultural background, other times one must find it and\nlearn how to use it.\n\nThere are claims, in Goodman\u2019s account of depiction, that are\nleft unexplained, especially with respect to pictures with\nindeterminate or fictional reference, that is, with pictures that\nGoodman would classify by predicates like \u201cman-picture,\u201d\n\u201cunicorn-pictures,\u201d etc. Of them, Goodman claims that they\nhave \u201cpurported\u201d denotation (1976, 67), yet without saying\nanything on how that should contribute to pictorial meaning.\nFurthermore, as the analysis progresses, and keeps facing the\nnecessity to account for pictures with indeterminate or fictional\nreference, as well as with the notion of representation-as\n(as in a picture that represents Winston Churchill as a bulldog), a\nsomewhat puzzling claim makes its way into Goodman\u2019s account:\nthat depiction in such cases is really a matter of\nexemplification\u2014exemplification of labels such as\n\u201cunicorn-picture,\u201d \u201cman-picture,\u201d or\n\u201cbulldog-picture\u201d (1976, 66). The motivation for such a\nclaim may be that of finding, after all, a mode of reference capable\nof explaining the way in which such pictures have meaning, i.e., of\naddressing the above-mentioned non-relational sense of depiction. Yet,\nGoodman provides no argument to support the claim that a picture\nrepresenting, say, a unicorn is not just denoted by labels\nsuch as \u201cunicorn-picture\u201d but also refers back to\nthose labels. Lack of actual or determinate reference cannot be\nsufficient to establish that an item denoted by a label refers back to\nthat label. Furthermore, precisely because samples refer to the labels\ndenoting them selectively, an argument would be needed to the effect\nthat pictures of unicorns exemplify such labels as\n\u201cof-a-unicorn,\u201d rather than labels as, say,\n\u201cpicture\u201d or even \u201cpainted by someone\u201d or\n\u201cpainted canvas,\u201d which after all are labels applying to\nsuch pictures.\n\nIn fact, in light of the above-mentioned ambiguity in the concept of\ndepiction, hence of the fundamental distinction between a relational\nand a non-relational sense of \u201cpicture of,\u201d we should\nemphasize how much is left out of Goodman\u2019s attempted\naccount of the concept. Notice how pictures may or may not represent\nsomething, i.e., relationally; yet, insofar as they have depicted\ncontent, they all are, non-relationally, O-pictures, or\nP-pictures, etc., that is, pictures with an O, or P, etc. content.\nSuch non-relational sense of depiction is indeed the one a theory of\ndepiction ought to investigate (cf. Budd 1993), and Goodman\u2019s\ngeneral claims on the syntactic and semantic characteristics of\npictorial (vs. verbal, or musical, or diagrammatic, etc.) symbol\nsystems do not seem able to encompass the fundamental question about\nsuch a notion, hence in a sense the fundamental question for any\ntheory of pictorial representation (cf. Giovannelli 1997). To\nillustrate, Goodman\u2019s account offers suggestions on what makes a\nsymbol a picture of a dog rather than a verbal description of a dog;\nat a very general level, the account has also something to say on what\nmakes a symbol a dog-picture rather than a dog-description. Yet, the\nfundamental question for a theory of depiction is what it means that a\npicture is a dog-picture, i.e., a picture with a dog as its depictive\ncontent, a picture in which competent viewers see a dog, instead of,\nsay, a cat-picture, i.e., a picture in which competent viewer see a\ncat. For better or worse, perceptual theories of depiction offer an\nanswer to that question; yet, no real competing answer is to\nbe found in Goodman. As mentioned, why some type of marks have become\ncorrelated with a certain kind of depictive content (hence presumably\nprompting a visual perception of such content when looking at the\npicture) is a matter of entrenchment; and that, in turn, is a question\nfor the anthropologist and the historian, not the philosopher,\naccording to Goodman.\n",
