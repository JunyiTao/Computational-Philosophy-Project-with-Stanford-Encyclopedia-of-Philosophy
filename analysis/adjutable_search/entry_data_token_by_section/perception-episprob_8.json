    "main_text": "Epistemological Solutions || Etiological Approaches\n3.2 Etiological Approaches\n\nIf experiences have justificatory power only when reliability or\nproper function are added into the mix, one might wonder if it\u2019s\nbetter to just omit any reference to experience and instead simply\nanalyze perceptual justification directly in terms of reliability or\nproper function. Indeed, these make up two prominent etiological\napproaches to perceptual justification and knowledge. A third\netiological approach is an inferentialist one. All three reject the\nMetaevidential Principle and access internalism.\n\nGoldman (1979, 1986) argues that justification results from the\noperation or exercise of a cognitive process whose operation is\nobjectively likely to yield true beliefs; the process must really be\nreliable in this sense, but the agent need not be aware of that\nfact.[5]\n (To be ultima facie justified the agent must not have reasons to\nthink the process unreliable.)\n\nA reliabilist theory of perceptual justification falls out from a\nreliabilist theory of justification in general, the simplest version\nof which is one that holds\n\n(SR): a belief is prima facie justified iff it is the result\nof a reliable cognitive process.\n\nBy claiming that reliability is sufficient for perceptual\njustification, the theory allows for justification in the absence of\nexperiences or anything else that the agent might use as evidence for\nthe belief. It allows that blindsighters and zombies could have\nperceptual justification. (Blindsight is a real phenomenon where\npatients with damage to early visual cortex are capable of forming\nreliable perceptual judgments in the absence of perceptual\nexperiences; philosophical depictions of blindsight tend to be\nsomewhat fictionalized. Zombies in philosophical parlance are\ncreatures otherwise just like us but lacking conscious experiences\naltogether.) It is nonevidentialist in the further sense that even\nwhere some link in the causal chain happens to count as an evidential\nstate for the cognizer (i.e., one on which they might base a belief),\nthat state\u2019s status as evidence is irrelevant to its epistemic\nrole, so long as it still makes the same contribution to the\nreliability of the overall process.\n\nA different kind of broadly reliabilist theory emphasizes skills or\ncompetences, rather than cognitive processes (Sosa 1991, 2007, 2021).\nSkills will likely be individuated in different ways than cognitive\nprocesses, and reliability might be assessed differently for different\nskills (as one does with performances more generally: a skillful\ndriver must almost never wreck the car, while a skillful batter might\nstrike out more than half the time). Nevertheless, the view is still\nreliabilist in that skill is a matter of having a high enough\npropensity to believe truly. Ernest Sosa\u2019s influential\ndevelopment of this view distinguishes \u201canimal\nknowledge\u201d\u2014a belief is true because competently\nformed\u2014from \u201creflective knowledge\u201d\u2014where the\nsubject has true-because-competently-formed belief that a lower order\nbelief is true because competently formed. Concepts of animal and\nreflective justification are easily derived from these. Although Sosa\ndenies the Metaevidential Principle for animal\nknowledge/justification, he embraces it for reflective\nknowledge/justification.\n\nOne reliabilist theory that aims at perceptual justification in\nparticular holds that it is not merely reliability that gives\nperception its epistemic force but also the fact that perceptual\nbeliefs have a distinctive psychological provenance. In particular,\nthey are the outputs of (weakly) \u201cmodular\u201d perceptual\nprocesses (where what counts as a perceptual module is spelled out in\narchitectural terms, rather than in terms of phenomenology or the\nagent\u2019s background beliefs; Lyons 2009). This\n\u201cinferentialist reliabilist\u201d theory (so-called not because\nof its treatment of perception but because of its treatment of some\nnonperceptual belief) claims that reliability is only sufficient for\nthe (prima facie) justification of the outputs of modular\nprocesses, but that the reliabilist can and should impose inferential\nrequirements (understood in reliabilist ways) on other beliefs. Though\nthe view is designed as a version of reliabilism, a mentalist\ninternalist could accept the modularity part and drop the reliability\npart, claiming that the outputs of perceptual modules are thereby\nprima facie justified whenever held, irrespective of either\nexperience or reliability.\n\nIn addition to or instead of reliability, one could endorse a\nfunctionalist view about the justification of perceptual beliefs.\nTyler Burge (2003, 2020) and Peter Graham (2012, 2019) are the most\nprominent proponents of this sort of view in its non-evidentialist\nmode. Both hold that the belief-forming process need not be reliable,\nbut it must have the (teleological) function of producing\nreliably true beliefs. This requires that the process be (/have been)\nreliable in normal conditions\u2014i.e., the conditions where\nproducing a particular result led to the establishment of that result\nas the function. For Burge, however, the functions derive from the\nfact that percepts and beliefs are representational states, and\nit\u2019s an a priori condition on any representational state that it\nhas the function of representing correctly; thus the view is that\nperceptual justification (he calls it \u201centitlement\u201d)\nrequires that the perceptual process and its elements be reliable in\nthose conditions in which the contents of those elements was fixed.\nFor Graham, the functions result from the empirical fact that the\nprocesses have done the organism (or its ancestors) some practical,\nbiological good.\n\nThese views are fully externalist, but there is a kind of etiological\nview that is compatible with mentalism. An\n\u201cinferentialist\u201d theory holds that perception involves an\ninferential or quasi-inferential process and that perceptual beliefs\nare justified or not, according as the inferential moves pass muster\nvis-a-vis whatever the ordinary standards are for inference more\ngenerally. The inference to be evaluated can be unconscious and of the\nHelmholtzian sort that perceptual psychologists talk about (Siegel\n2013, 2017), or it can be a move from conscious, person-level\ncontents, like low-level sensory contents, to high level perceptual\ncategorization beliefs (e.g., \u2018there\u2019s a cat\u2019)\n(Markie 2006, 2013; McGrath 2013, 2018). The latter option ends up\nbeing a version of the evidentialist theories discussed above (usually\na conservative kind of modest foundationalism) and won\u2019t get\nrepeated treatment here; but the former is a distinctive theory of\nperceptual justification. Susanna Siegel takes her inferentialism so\nfar as to claim that nondoxastic perceptual experiences are themselves\nepistemically evaluable and can be effectively unjustified, if their\netiology is an inferentially bad one. Although the inferentialist can\nmake explicit appeal to experiences, one can also develop an\ninferentialism that assigns no significant role to experience as such\n(Ghijsen 2021), and in any case, the experience is merely one link in\nthe inferential chain on the basis of which the perceptual belief is\nevaluated. (As stated above, the evidential, etiological, and\nworld-involving approaches were not held to be mutually exclusive.)\nOne putative counterexample to Siegel\u2019s inferentialism involves\nan agent who believes for no good reason that the woods around them\nare full of snakes, and this irrational belief affects their\nperceptual experiences in such a way that they are now better at\nspotting snakes that are actually there (Lyons 2011). Intuitively, the\nagent is justified in their perceptual beliefs, despite an irrational\ninferential etiology.\n\nAs with the seeming externalist views, the standard clairvoyance, new\nevil demon, and Swampman objections to reliabilist and functionalist\ntheories are leveled against these theories of perceptual\njustification. Proponents of the phenomenal determination principle\n(section\n 3.1.5\n above) will reject all of these views as incompatible with that\nprinciple (Smithies 2019, Pautz 2020). A closely related issue\nconcerns agents who don\u2019t have any experiences. Because these\ntheories allow perceptual justification in the absence of any\nexperience, they will allow zombies and blindsighters to have\nperceptual justification, so long as their perceptual processes are\nreliable, or functioning normally, or drawing rational unconscious\ninferences, and so on. Intuitions on this matter seem to be divided;\nsome authors think this consequence is a virtue of such views\n(Plantinga 1993, Lyons 2009, Tucker 2010), though others think it is\nclearly a vice (e.g., Smithies 2019, Johnston 2011).\n",
