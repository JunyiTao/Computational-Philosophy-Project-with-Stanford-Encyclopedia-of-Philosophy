The Isma\u2018ili Tradition\n\nOn the Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs side, the use of the esoteric\ndoctrine of Hermeticism and the Greco-Alexandrian mystical teachings\nwere adopted by Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs philosophers. Such\nconcepts as emanation from the One, asceticism, the body as prison\nwith the soul as its inmate, initiation into the mysteries of gnosis\n(ma\u2018rifah), levels of interpretations of spiritual\nhermeneutics (ta\u2019w\u012bl), sacred geometry with its\nmystical symbolism, cycles of prophecy, and the initiatic role of\nShi\u2018ite Imams are among many of the mystical themes of\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b philosophical tradition. Among the most\nnotable Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b figures in the 10th\nand 11th century CE is Jabir Ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n, (c.\n721\u2013c. 815 CE) who was more of a scientist and chemist and as\nsuch offered in his The Book of Stones (Kit\u0101b\nal-a\u1e25j\u0101r) a mystical interpretation of the science of\nletters and the esoteric mathematical concepts that are influenced by\nPythagorean geometry. It should be noted that he was a figure under\nwhose name works by many diverse thinkers may have been collected.\nAb\u016b Ya\u2018qub Sijist\u0101n\u012b was also a notable figure in\nthe movement whose mystical writings in Unveiling of the\nHidden (Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb) and The Book of\nWell Springs (Kit\u0101b al-yan\u0101bi\u2018) provide an\nesoteric commentary on major philosophical and religious matters (see\nNasr & Aminrazavi 1999/2001). Sijist\u0101n\u012b, whose writings\nshould be regarded as a spiritual commentary on the gnostic doctrine\npertaining to the flight of the soul toward its paradisal state,\ncenters on the oneness of God, the intellects both Divine and human,\nand different types of souls together with their relationship with the\nbody. In the above mentioned works, Sijist\u0101n\u012b systematically\ntreats notions of creation, the role of prophets as spiritual guides,\nand the hidden symbolism of their teachings. As one goes from the\noutward to the inward and esoteric level of Islam, one gains the\nconsciousness which is the key to understanding the symbolism of\nprophetic teachings. Among other major figures and esoteric mystical\ntexts in this vein is Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s\n(811\u2013891 CE) Science of Prophecy (A\u2018l\u0101m\nal-nubuwwah), in which he applies the concept of emanation to the\ncosmological notion of Be (kun) and offers a\nmystical commentary on how human soul is a trace of the higher soul\nthat is perfect.\n\nAlso, one must mention \u1e24am\u012bd al-D\u012bn Kirm\u0101n\u012b\n(d. 996\u20131021 CE) and his numerous writings on Sufism and\ngnosticism, the most notable of which is his Repose of the\nIntellect (R\u0101\u1e25at al-\u2018aql). A prominent\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b philosopher, considered by some as the\n\u201cIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs\u2019 Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101,\u201d he argued that an understanding of truth is\nbased on two precepts. First, one has to live a morally virtuous life\nand second, the adept must prepare himself philosophically. The\nchapters of R\u0101\u1e25at al-\u2018aql\nare called aswar (walls) and the paragraphs,\nmash\u0101ri\u2018 (paths). The novice has\nto travel through fifty-six paths within seven walls in order for the\nsoul to gain the knowledge of Reality. Reality, according to\nKirm\u0101n\u012b, is divided into four different levels: first is the\nworld of Divine creation or the incorporeal world\n(\u2018al\u0101m\nal-ibd\u0101\u2018), second, the corporeal\nrealm (\u2018\u0101lam al-jism), third,\nthe domain of religion (\u2018al\u0101m\nal-d\u012bn), and finally, the return of the\nworld to its original unity with God (Baumstark 1932; Corbin 1961;\nCorbin 1964, 130\u20131; Hunzai 1986).\n\nPerhaps the most important figure of the\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs tradition, one who was both poet and\nphilosopher, is N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw (1004\u2013c.1072 CE).\nWhether in his collection of mystical and didactic poems known as\nDiv\u0101n, or his mystically oriental works such as The\nSum of the Two Wisdoms (J\u0101mi\u2018\nal-\u1e25ikmattay\u012bn) and Knowledge and Liberation\n(Gush\u0101yesh wa rah\u0101yesh), he relentlessly offers\nadvice on the catharsis of the soul and the pursuing of the spiritual\njourney. N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw\u2019s attempt to reconcile\nSufism and reason is seen in his The Sum of the Two Wisdoms,\nwhere he argues that the \u201csages of real religion\u201d\n(\u1e25ukam\u0101y-i d\u012bn-i \u1e25aqq) and the\nphilosophers are in agreement. For N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw, the\nscience of the soul is the way to attain real knowledge, knowledge\nwhich transcends the difference between the perceiver and perception.\nHe writes:\n\nBetween the knower and the known.\n\nThere lies a distinction by one who\n\nHas awakened from sleep of heedlessness.\n\n\nN\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw offers specific instructions how a novice\nshould follow the spiritual path, relying on specific ascetic\npractices. Similar to the figures of St. Augustine and St. Francis of\nAssisi, N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw pursued a hedonistic lifestyle in\nthe early part of his life but underwent a spiritual metamorphosis and\ndedicated himself to the Sufi path. Echoes from both phases of his\nlife can be seen through out his works (Hunsburger 2000).\n\nThere are also several encyclopedic works of the\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b tradition whose authors are unknown.\nMany of these deal with mystical and Sufi ideas. Among the works that\nhave been influential in the spread of gnostic ideas are treatises\nlike Brethren of Purity (Ikhw\u0101n\nal-\u1e63af\u0101) and The Mother of Books (Umm\nal-kit\u0101b) (Daftary 1990; Nasr & Aminrazavi\n1999/2001).\n",
