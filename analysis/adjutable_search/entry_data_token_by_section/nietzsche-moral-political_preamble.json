    "main_text": "\n\nNietzsche\u2019s moral philosophy is primarily critical in\norientation: he attacks morality both for its commitment to untenable\ndescriptive (metaphysical and empirical) claims about human agency, as\nwell as for the deleterious impact of its distinctive norms and values\non the flourishing of the highest types of human beings\n(Nietzsche\u2019s \u201chigher men\u201d). His positive ethical\nviews are best understood as combining (i) a kind of consequentialist\nperfectionism as Nietzsche\u2019s implicit theory of the good, with\n(ii) a conception of human perfection involving both formal and\nsubstantive elements. Because Nietzsche, however, is an\nanti-realist about value, he takes neither his positive\nvision, nor those aspects of his critique that depend upon it, to have\nany special epistemic status, a fact which helps explain his rhetoric\nand the circumspect character of his \u201cesoteric\u201d\nmoralizing. Although Nietzsche\u2019s illiberal attitudes\n(for example, about human equality) are apparent, there are no grounds\nfor ascribing to him a political philosophy, since he has no\nsystematic (or even partly systematic) views about the nature of state\nand society. As an esoteric moralist, Nietzsche aims at freeing higher\nhuman beings from their false consciousness about morality (their\nfalse belief that this morality is good for them), not at a\ntransformation of society at large.\n",
