    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism || The Vicious Circle Problem\n8.1 The Vicious Circle Problem\n\nAccording to Stevenson and Ayer the function of moral judgments is to\nexpress approval and disapproval. But to approve of X is to\nthink or feel that X is good or right: to disapprove is to\nthink or feel that it is bad or wrong. Thus the emotivist analysis of\nthe moral terms is viciously circular. (Russell himself had developed\na similar line of argument against theories which identify rightness\nwith a tendency to arouse approval in his \u201cThe Elements of\nEthics\u201d (1912).)\n\nThis objection leaves Russell untouched. To approve of X may be\nto think or feel that X is good, but for Russell to think\nX good is not to approve of it, but to desire that everyone\nshould desire X. Implausible as this may be, there is no\ncircle, vicious or otherwise.\n",
