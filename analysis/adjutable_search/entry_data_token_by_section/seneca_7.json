    "main_text": "Virtue || Benefiting Others\n4.2 Benefiting Others\n\nAlthough the Stoics are, with respect to the good, most famous for the\nclaim that only virtue is good, they define the good as benefit.\nSeneca agrees with the early Stoic view that the good benefits. As we\nhave seen, Seneca thinks that both public life and philosophy are good\nforms of life, if conducted right, precisely because both are of\nbenefit to others. When discussing the benefit that a philosophical\nlife brings to others, he claims that the virtuous person\u2019s life\nis beneficial even if she performs no public function whatsoever. Her\ngait, her silent persistence, and the expression of her eyes, benefit.\nJust as some medication works merely through its smell, virtue has its\ngood effects even from a distance (On Peace of Mind\n4.6\u20137).\n\nSeneca devotes an entire treatise to the question of how one should\nbenefit others, and how one should receive benefits, On\nBenefits (or: On Favors, lat. De beneficiis).\nOn Benefits is the longest extant Senecan treatise on one\nspecific ethical topic. Though the treatise is firmly situated in the\nRoman social context, its detailed analysis and richness of examples\nmake it more than an historical document. Seneca discusses good deeds\nand badly performed favors, graceful and ungraceful receiving, the joy\nor burden of returning favors, as well as gratitude and envy.\nSeneca\u2019s topic is a hybrid of the kind of phenomena\nanthropologists discuss in terms of gift exchange, the specific\nconfiguration of these phenomena studied in ancient Rome, and Stoic\nviews to the effect that only the good person benefits others. This\nmix makes for a rather difficult text. It is no surprise, then, that\nthere used to be almost no helpful literature. This state, however, is\nameliorated by recent translations with philosophical introductions,\nby John Cooper and J.F. Procop\u00e9 (1995; Books 1\u20134) and by\nMiriam Griffin and Brad Inwood (featuring also an Introduction by the\nseries editors E. Asmis, S. Bartsch and M. Nussbaum, 2011), as well as\nGriffin\u2019s new \u201cguide\u201d to On Benefits\n(2013)\n\nWhat, then, are benefits or favors as Seneca uses the term? Roughly\nspeaking, one can think of beneficia as any kind of help a\nperson might offer to another person qua member of a group, such that\nthis strengthens the cohesion of the group and affirms or creates\nsocial bonds. Examples include: to give money or other material\nassistance, to use one\u2019s influence in someone\u2019s favor or\nin favor of someone\u2019s family member, to advance someone\u2019s\nhealth or personal safety, to save someone (her child, etc.) from\ncalamity, to get someone out of prison, to console, to speak on\nsomeone\u2019s behalf, to further someone\u2019s career, to teach\nand educate someone, to instruct or advise someone.\n\nBenefits are given largely between those who do not belong to the same\nhousehold. They thus differ from the responsibilities that attach to\nthe roles of son or wife and from the services that slaves or\nemployees are expected to perform (3.18.1). What parents do for their\nchildren, however, counts as benefit and not as role-specific\nresponsibilities. Sons are returning what they owe, thus fulfilling\nthe obligations that attach to their role. But it is important to\nSeneca that sons can also genuinely benefit their parents\n(3.29.1\u201338.3), for example, if through their outstanding\nachievements they put the parents into the spotlight, in\nSeneca\u2019s eyes a priceless benefit (3.32.2). Moreover, Seneca\nspends much of Book 3 arguing that slaves can benefit their masters,\nnamely when they do more than they are compelled to do. Seneca thinks\nthat, given how hateful compulsion is for anyone, benefits conferred\nby slaves reflect an admirable ability to overcome resentment for\nbeing in the position they are in (3.19.4).\n\nLending (as opposed to giving) money is not a beneficium. If\nmoney or wealth is involved in a favor, it must be freely given.\nIndeed, if one does not want to stand in the kind of social\nrelationship that the giving and receiving of benefits creates, one\ncan accept money only as a loan. If, say, a person whom you did not\nwant in your life were to free you from captivity through paying the\nransom, you might accept this, but you should quickly raise the money\nto repay her. That way, no bond is established (2.21.1\u20132). The\ndistinction between lending and giving runs through the treatise as a\nwhole. It connects to two further ideas. First, that the right\nattitudes of giving, receiving, and returning a benefit involve\nfreedom (1.4.3; on the kind of freedom that, according to Seneca,\nmasters and slaves share, to the effect that slaves too can confer\nbenefits, see Gianella 2019). The addressee of On benefits is\ncalled Liberalis, a name that drives home a point that Seneca wants to\nemphasize. For something to count as a benefit it must not be given\nslowly, grudgingly, or in some other reluctant way; it must be given\nfreely. To be rightly received, the good deed should not be perceived\nby the recipient as a burden; it must be accepted freely. Indeed, the\nkind of emotion that reflects the appropriate attitudes on both parts\nis joy. Anything else would be suggestive of hesitations, concerns\nabout undesired ties, and so on. Second, the distinction between\nlending and giving is reflected in a distinction between justice and\nbeneficence (3.14.3\u201315.3). Justice appears inferior to Seneca\ninsofar as, in that sphere, we are putting faith in seals rather than\nsouls (3.15.3). If the domain of \u2018good deeds\u2019 was invaded\nby attitudes appropriate to lending and contractual obligations,\nSeneca thinks that something of great value would be lost.\n\nThroughout the treatise, Seneca\u2019s focus is on attitudes, not on\nde facto performed actions. It is not the transfer of an\nobject, or the return of a favor, that ultimately counts. Strictly\nspeaking, a favor consists in the relevant state of mind of the giver\n(that he wants to benefit someone) and similarly in the grateful state\nof mind of the receiver. What we might call the intention to benefit,\nand the intention to gratefully repay the favor are the relevant\nactions of giving and receiving correctly. As some scholars put it, it\nis the act of willing which counts as a correct action (Inwood, 2005\n[3]; cf. Letter 81.10\u201313). These arguments reflect core\nintuitions of Stoic ethics. Scholars traditionally judge Book 4 to be\nthe part of the treatise that addresses more abstract philosophical\nquestions, thus aiming to integrate a discussion about the norms\npertaining to a historical practice in Rome with Stoic tenets in\nethics. However, this assessment is best seen as making a comparative\njudgment. There is more explicit Stoic theory in Book 4 than in the\nother books. Seneca discusses the benefits conveyed by God, drawing on\nStoic theology and philosophy of nature (see 5.3 below on Stoic\ntheology).\n\nOtherwise, one might argue that Book 4 is not all that different from\nthe rest of the treatise. In particular, Seneca\u2019s question\nwhether benefits ought to be given for their own sake or for the sake\nof some advantage to the giver does not employ any quintessentially\nStoic assumptions. Indeed, one might even say that it is in\nconsiderable tension with central intuitions of earlier Stoic ethics.\nFor the Stoics, the good and the advantageous really are one and the\nsame. Moreover, Book 4 does not, as one might expect, address the\nsubtleties of the Stoic conception of the good, which would be a way\nof pushing the discussion to a more theoretical level. Seneca\u2019s\narguments about good deeds are essentially already laid out in Books 1\nto 3. The claim that what matters are intentions and attitudes was\nalready established in ways that are relatively independent of Stoic\npremises about the good: by distinguishing benefits from obligations;\nby pointing to the dangers of burdening others with expectations they\nshall not be able to meet; by elaborating on the fact that there must\nbe a way of repaying even for those who are without material means;\nand so on. Seneca addresses in rather concrete ways the problems that\nare likely to arise in a society that is held together by the exchange\nof favors. As a result of imperfect giving, recipients easily become\ndependents and feel enslaved by their donors.\n\nMuch of On Benefits is normative, aiming to lay down \u201ca\nlaw of life\u201d (1.4.2.) about giving, receiving, and returning.\nSeneca\u2019s recommendations, however, are based on what he\nperceives to be facts about human psychology. For example, he thinks\nthat the negative aspects of how others conduct themselves towards us\nshall stick more firmly in our minds than the positive aspects\n(1.1.8), and that we tend to have ever new desires, so that we are\ninevitably less aware of benefactions received in the past than we are\nof what we want for the present and future (3.3.1.). To give well\ninvolves recognition of such facts. Often, Seneca observes, we are\nevasive and assist only grudgingly. No wonder that our reticence\nsticks out more in people\u2019s minds than the fact that we\neventually relented; no wonder that we are not held in esteem for such\nungracious giving (1.1.8).\n\nAssuming that Seneca is right, and that it is difficult to be good at\nhelping, the focus of an ethical discussion about helping should not\nbe in the first instance on how much help should be given (as it often\nis today). Rather, it should be on how one achieves something rare and\ndifficult, namely to help in such a way that the recipient does not\nend up being worse off for having been helped. Among works in modern\nmoral philosophy, the treatise that perhaps bears most resemblance\nwith On Benefits is Kant\u2019s Doctrine of Virtue,\na book that contains so-called \u201ccasuistical\u201d sections\nwhere Kant discusses such matters as how certain ways of helping might\nlower the recipient in her own eyes and the eyes of others, thus\nmaking the receiver appear more manifestly inferior than she should be\n(Vogt 2008). Indeed, Kant and Seneca agree on the following point\n(though of course much of the background reasoning differs): good\ngiving may even require leaving the recipient of help in the dark,\nbecause otherwise the negative effects (the social positioning of\nsomeone as recipient and ultimately dependent) can outweigh the\nbenefit (2.10.1). Seneca\u2019s tone suggests that he agrees with a\npopular sentiment when he says that ungratefulness is an extremely\ngrave and widespread vice. And yet, he thinks that bad giving is prior\nto and often directly responsible for bad receiving or lack of\nrepaying; Book 1 and Book 2 both begin with this idea.\n",
