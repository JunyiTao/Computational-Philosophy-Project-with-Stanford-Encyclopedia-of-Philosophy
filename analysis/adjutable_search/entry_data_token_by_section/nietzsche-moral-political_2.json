    "main_text": "The Critique of Morality || Critique of the Normative Component of MPS\n1.3 Critique of the Normative Component of MPS\n\nAll of Nietzsche\u2019s criticisms of the normative component of MPS\nare parasitic upon one basic complaint \u2014 not, as some have held\n(e.g., Nehamas [1985], Geuss [1997]), the universality of moral\ndemands, per se, but rather that \u201cthe demand of one\nmorality for all is detrimental to the higher men\u201d (BGE 228).\nUniversality would be unobjectionable if agents were relevantly\nsimilar, but because agents are relevantly different, a universal\nmorality must necessarily be harmful to some. As Nietzsche writes\nelsewhere: \u201cWhen a decadent type of man ascended to the rank of\nthe highest type [via MPS], this could only happen at the expense\nof its countertype [emphasis added], the type of man that is\nstrong and sure of life\u201d (EH III:5). In the preface to the\nGenealogy, Nietzsche sums up his basic concern particularly\nwell:\n\nWhat if a symptom of regression lurked in the \u201cgood,\u201d\nlikewise a danger, a seduction, a poison, a narcotic, through which\nthe present lived at the expense of the future? Perhaps more\ncomfortably, less dangerously, but at the same time in a meaner style,\nmore basely? \u2014 So that morality itself were to blame if the\nhighest power and splendor [M\u00e4chtigkeit und\nPracht] possible to the type man was never in fact attained? So\nthat morality itself was the danger of dangers? (GM Pref:6; cf. BT\nAttempt:5)\n\n\nThis theme is sounded throughout Nietzsche\u2019s work. In a book of\n1880, for example, he writes that, \u201cOur weak, unmanly social\nconcepts of good and evil and their tremendous ascendancy over body\nand soul have finally weakened all bodies and souls and snapped the\nself-reliant, independent, unprejudiced men, the pillars of a\nstrong civilization\u201d (D 163). Similarly, in a\nposthumously published note of 1885, he remarks that \u201cmen of\ngreat creativity, the really great men according to my understanding,\nwill be sought in vain today\u201d because \u201cnothing stands more\nmalignantly in the way of their rise and evolution\u2026than what in\nEurope today is called simply \u2018morality\u2019\u201d (WP 957).\nIn these and many other passages (e.g., BGE 62; GM III:14; A:5, 24; EH\nIV:4; WP 274, 345, 400, 870, 879.), Nietzsche makes plain his\nfundamental objection to MPS: simply put, that MPS thwarts the\ndevelopment of human excellence, i.e., \u201cthe highest power and\nsplendor possible to the type man\u201d (for more on the\n\u201chigher man,\u201d see section (2)).\n\nThere is another, competing reading of Nietzsche\u2019s central\ncomplaint about MPS: namely, that it is \u201charmful to life\u201d\nor, more simply, \u201canti-nature.\u201d Geuss, for example, says\nthat, \u201cThere is little doubt that \u2018Life\u2019\u2026in\nNietzsche does seem to function as a criterion for evaluating\nmoralities\u201d (1997: 10). So, too, Schacht claims that Nietzsche\n\u201ctakes \u2018life\u2019 in this world to be the sole locus of\nvalue, and its preservation, flourishing, and above all its\nenhancement to be ultimately decisive for determinations of\nvalue\u201d (1983: 359). Thus, the question of the value of MPS is\nreally the question of its \u201cvalue for life\u201d (1983: 354).\nBut what does that mean? After all, it is obvious that Nietzsche has\nnothing but contempt for most forms of human life, from St. Paul to\nBismarck to the modern \u201cherd.\u201d So the real question has to\nbe: what does \u201clife\u201d refer to? Schacht, following a\nsuggestion of Nietzsche\u2019s from the Nachlass (WP 254),\nsuggests that life is will to power, and thus degree of power\nconstitutes the standard of value. (We shall return to this suggestion\nin detail in section 3.1, below.) But this involves no gain in\nprecision. Nietzsche may, indeed, have thought that more\n\u201cpower\u201d \u2014 in his sense \u2014 was more valuable\nthan less, but that still leaves us with the question: power of\nwhat or of whom? The only plausible candidate\n\u2014 given especially his other remarks discussed above \u2014 is\npower of people; just as the only plausible candidate for the\n\u201clife\u201d that Nietzsche considers it valuable to preserve\nand enhance must be the lives of people and, in particular,\nthe lives of the \u201chighest men.\u201d\n\nThat this is what Nietzsche means is revealed by the context of his\nactual remarks about the \u201cvalue for life.\u201d For example, he\ncomments that \u201ca higher and more fundamental value for\nlife might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and\nlust\u201d (BGE 2, emphasis added). But what sort of\n\u201clife\u201d is, e.g., \u201cselfishness\u201d valuable for?\nAs Nietzsche writes elsewhere (e.g., GM Pref:5\u20136), it is simply\nthat life which manifests \u201cthe highest power and splendor\nactually possible to the type man.\u201d And similarly, when\nNietzsche says that a \u201ctendency hostile to life is therefore\ncharacteristic of morality,\u201d it is clear in context that what\n\u201clife\u201d refers to is \u201cthe type man\u201d who might\nbe \u201craised to his greatest splendor and power\u201d (that is,\nbut for the interference of MPS) (WP 897). In short, then, the things\nNietzsche identifies as \u201cvaluable\u201d for life are those he\ntakes to be necessary for the flourishing of the highest types of life\n(or human excellence), while those that he identifies as harmful to it\nare those that he takes to be things that constitute obstacles to such\nflourishing. This suggests, then, that the \u201clife\u201d for\nwhich things are either valuable or disvaluable must be the life (or\nlives) that manifest human excellence \u2014 i.e., the lives of\n\u201chigher men.\u201d\n\nSomething similar may be said for the claim that Nietzsche objects to\nMPS because it is \u201canti-nature.\u201d For example, when\nNietzsche says in Ecce Homo (IV:7) that \u201cit is the lack\nof nature, it is the utterly gruesome fact that antinature\nitself received the highest honors as morality\u201d that he\ncentrally objects to in a morality, his claim will remain obscure\nunless we can say precisely what about MPS makes it\n\u201canti-natural.\u201d Nietzsche, himself, offers guidance on\nthis in the same section when he explains that a MPS is anti-natural\ninsofar as it has the following sorts of characteristics: it teaches\nmen \u201cto despise the very first instincts of life\u201d and\n\u201cto experience the presupposition of life, sexuality, as\nsomething unclean\u201d; and it \u201clooks for the evil principle\nin what is most profoundly necessary for growth, in severe\nself-love\u201d (EH IV:7).\n\nBut from this it should be apparent, then, that it is not\nanti-naturalness itself that is objectionable, but the consequences of\nan anti-natural MPS that are at issue: for example, its opposition to\nthe instincts that are \u201cprofoundly necessary for growth.\u201d\nThis point is even more explicit in The Antichrist, where\nNietzsche notes that Christian morality \u201chas waged deadly war\nagainst this higher type of man; it has placed all the basic\ninstincts of his type under ban\u201d (5, emphasis added). In\nother words, the anti-naturalness of MPS is objectionable because the\n\u201cnatural\u201d instincts MPS opposes are precisely those\nnecessary for the growth of the \u201chigher type of man.\u201d\nThus, underlying Nietzsche\u2019s worries about the anti-naturalness\nof MPS \u2014 just as underlying his worries about the threat MPS\nposes to life \u2014 is a concern for the effect of MPS on\n\u201chigher men.\u201d\n\nSo Nietzsche objects to the normative agenda of MPS because it is\nharmful to the highest men. In Nietzsche\u2019s various accounts of\nwhat the objectionable agenda of MPS consists, he identifies a variety\nof normative positions (see, e.g., D 108, 132, 174; GS 116, 294, 328,\n338, 345, 352, 377; Z I:4, II:8, III:1, 9, IV:13, 10; BGE 197, 198,\n201\u2013202, 225, 257; GM Pref:5, III: 11 ff.; TI II, V, IX:35,\n37\u201338, 48; A: 7, 43; EH III:D-2, IV:4, 7\u20138; WP 752). We may\ncharacterize these simply as \u201cpro\u201d and \u201ccon\u201d\nattitudes, and we may say that a morality is the object of\nNietzsche\u2019s critique (i.e., it is an MPS) if it contains one or\nmore of the following normative views (this is a representative, but\nnot exhaustive, list):\n\n\nPro\nCon \n\nHappiness\nSuffering \n\nAltruism/Selflessness\nSelf-love or self-interest \n\nEquality\nInequality \n\nPity/Compassion\nIndifference to the suffering \n\n\nThe various possible normative components of MPS should, of course, be\nunderstood construed as ideal-typical, singling out for\nemphasis and criticism certain important features of larger and more\ncomplex normative views. Let us call that which morality has a\n\u201cpro\u201d attitude towards is the \u201cPro-Object,\u201d\nand that which morality has a \u201ccon\u201d attitude towards the\n\u201cCon-Object.\u201d Keeping in mind that what seems to have\nintrinsic value for Nietzsche is human excellence or human\ngreatness (see the next section), Nietzsche\u2019s attack on the\nnormative component of MPS can be summarized as having two parts:\n\n(a) With respect to the Pro-Object, Nietzsche argues either (i) that\nthe Pro-Object has no intrinsic value (in the cases where MPS\nclaims it does); or (ii) that it does not have any or not nearly as\nmuch extrinsic value as MPS treats it as having; and\n\n\n(b) With respect to the Con-Object, Nietzsche argues only\nthat the Con-Objects are extrinsically valuable for the\ncultivation of human excellence \u2014 and that this is obscured by\nthe \u201ccon\u201d attitude endorsed by MPS.\n\n\nThus, what unifies Nietzsche\u2019s seemingly disparate critical\nremarks \u2014 about altruism, happiness, pity, equality, Kantian\nrespect for persons, utilitarianism, etc. \u2014 is that he thinks a\nculture in which such norms prevail as morality will be a culture\nwhich eliminates the conditions for the realization of human\nexcellence \u2014 the latter requiring, on Nietzsche\u2019s view,\nconcern with the self, suffering, a certain stoic indifference, a\nsense of hierarchy and difference, and the like. Indeed, when we turn\nto the details of Nietzsche\u2019s criticisms of these norms we find\nthat, in fact, this is precisely what he argues. One detailed example\nwill have to suffice here.\n\nWhat could be harmful about the seemingly innocuous MPS valuation of\nhappiness (\u201cpro\u201d) and suffering (\u201ccon\u201d)? An\nearly remark of Nietzsche\u2019s suggests his answer:\n\nAre we not, with this tremendous objective of obliterating all the\nsharp edges of life, well on the way to turning mankind into\nsand? Sand! Small, soft, round, unending sand! Is that your\nideal, you heralds of the sympathetic affections? (D 174)\n\n\nIn a later work, Nietzsche says \u2014 referring to hedonists and\nutilitarians \u2014 that, \u201cWell-being as you understand it\n\u2014 that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state\nthat soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible\u2026\u201d (BGE\n225). By the hedonistic doctrine of well-being, Nietzsche takes the\nutilitarians to have in mind \u201cEnglish happiness,\u201d\nnamely, \u201ccomfort and fashion\u201d (BGE 228) \u2014 a\nconstrual which, if unfair to some utilitarians (like Mill), may do\njustice to our ordinary aspirations to happiness. In a similar vein,\nNietzsche has Zarathustra dismiss \u201cwretched contentment\u201d\nas an ideal (Z Pref:3), while also revealing that it was precisely\n\u201cthe last men\u201d \u2014 the \u201cmost despicable\nmen\u201d \u2014 who \u201cinvented happiness\n[Gl\u00fcck]\u201d in the first place (Pref:5).\n\nSo happiness, according to Nietzsche, is not an intrinsically valuable\nend, and men who aim for it \u2014 directly or through cultivating\nthe dispositions that lead to it \u2014 would be \u201cridiculous\nand contemptible.\u201d To be sure, Nietzsche allows that he himself\nand the \u201cfree spirits\u201d will be \u201ccheerful\u201d or\n\u201cgay\u201d [fr\u00f6lich] \u2014 they are, after all,\nthe proponents of the \u201cgay science.\u201d But the point is that\nsuch \u201chappiness\u201d is not criterial of being a\nhigher person, and thus it is not something that the higher person\n\u2014 in contrast to the adherent of MPS \u2014 aims for.\n\nYet why does aiming for happiness make a person so unworthy of\nadmiration? Nietzsche\u2019s answer appears to be this: because\nsuffering is positively necessary for the cultivation of\nhuman excellence \u2014 which is the only thing, recall, that\nwarrants admiration for Nietzsche. He writes, for example, that:\n\nThe discipline of suffering, of great suffering \u2014 do\nyou not know that only this discipline has created all\nenhancements of man so far? That tension of the soul in unhappiness\nwhich cultivates its strength, its shudders face to face with great\nruin, its inventiveness and courage in enduring, persevering,\ninterpreting, and exploiting suffering, and whatever has been granted\nto it of profundity, secret, mask, spirit, cunning, greatness \u2014\nwas it not granted to it through suffering, through the discipline of\ngreat suffering? (BGE 225; cf. BGE 270)\n\n\nNietzsche is not arguing here that \u2014 in contrast to the view of\nMPS \u2014 suffering is really intrinsically valuable (not\neven MPS claims that). The value of suffering, according to Nietzsche,\nis only extrinsic: suffering \u2014 \u201cgreat\u201d suffering\n\u2014 is a prerequisite of any great human achievement. As Nietzsche\nputs the point elsewhere: \u201cOnly great pain is the ultimate\nliberator of the spirit\u2026.I doubt that such pain makes us\n\u2018better\u2019; but I know that it makes us more profound\u201d\n(GS Pref:3). Nietzsche\u2019s attack, then, conforms to the model\nsketched above: (i) he rejects the view that happiness is\nintrinsically valuable; and (ii) he thinks that the negative\nattitude of MPS toward suffering obscures its important extrinsic\nvalue. (There is reason to think that, on this second point, Nietzsche\nis generalizing from his own experience with physical suffering, the\nworst periods of which coincided with his greatest productivity.\nIndeed, he believed that his suffering contributed essentially to his\nwork: as he writes, admittedly hyperbolically, in Ecce Homo:\n\u201cIn the midst of the torments that go with an uninterrupted\nthree-day migraine, accompanied by laborious vomiting of phlegm, I\npossessed a dialectician\u2019s clarity par excellence and\nthought through with very cold blood matters for which under healthier\ncircumstances I am not mountain-climber, not subtle, not cold\nenough\u201d (EH I:1).)\n\nEven if there is no shortage in the history of art and literature of\ncases of immense suffering being the spur to great creativity, there\nremains a serious worry about the logic of this line of Nietzschean\ncritique. Following Leiter (2002), we may call this the \u201cHarm\nPuzzle,\u201d and the puzzle is this: why should one think the\ngeneral moral prescription to alleviate suffering must stop the\nsuffering of great artists, hence stop them from producing great art?\nOne might think, in fact, that MPS could perfectly well allow an\nexception for those individuals whose own suffering is essential to\nthe realization of central life projects. After all, a prescription to\nalleviate suffering reflects a concern with promoting well-being,\nunder some construal. But if some individuals \u2014 nascent Goethes,\nNietzsches, and other geniuses \u2014 would be better off\nwith a good dose of suffering, then why would MPS recommend otherwise?\nWhy, then, should it be the case that MPS \u201charms\u201d\npotentially \u201chigher men\u201d?\n\nThis seems the natural philosophical question to ask, yet it also\ninvolves an important misunderstanding of Nietzsche\u2019s critique,\nwhich is not, we might say, about philosophical theory but\nrather about the real nature of culture. When MPS values come\nto dominate a culture, Nietzsche thinks (plausibly), they will affect\nthe attitudes of all members of that culture. If MPS values emphasize\nthe badness of suffering and the goodness of happiness, that will\ninfluence how individuals with the potential for great achievements\nunderstand, evaluate and conduct their own lives. If, in fact,\nsuffering is a precondition for these individuals to do anything\ngreat, and if they have internalized the norm that suffering must be\nalleviated, and that happiness is the ultimate goal, then we run the\nrisk that, rather than \u2014 to put it crudely \u2014 suffer and\ncreate, they will instead waste their energies pursuing pleasure,\nlamenting their suffering and seeking to alleviate it. MPS values may\nnot explicitly prohibit artists or other potentially\n\u201cexcellent\u201d persons from ever suffering; but the risk is\nthat a culture \u2014 like ours \u2014 which has internalized the\nnorms against suffering and for pleasure will be a\nculture in which potential artists \u2014 and other doers of great\nthings \u2014 will, in fact, squander themselves in\nself-pity and the seeking of pleasure.\n\nSo Nietzsche\u2019s response to the Harm Puzzle depends upon an\nempirical claim about what the real effect of MPS will be.\nThe normative component of MPS is harmful not because its specific\nprescriptions and proscriptions explicitly require potentially\nexcellent persons to forego that which allows them to flourish (the\nclaim is not that a conscientious application of the\n\u201ctheory\u201d of MPS is incompatible with the flourishing of\nhigher men); rather, the normative component of MPS is harmful because\nin practice, and especially because of MPS\u2019s commitment\nto the idea that one morality is appropriate for all, potentially\nhigher men will come to adopt such values as applicable to themselves\nas well. Thus, the normative component of MPS is harmful because, in\nreality, it will have the effect of leading potentially excellent\npersons to value what is in fact not conducive to their flourishing\nand devalue what is in fact essential to it.\n\nIn sum, Nietzsche\u2019s central objection to MPS is that it thwarts\nthe development of human excellence. His argument for this, in each\ncase, turns on identifying distinctive valuations of MPS, and showing\nhow \u2014 as in the case of norms favoring happiness and devaluing\nsuffering \u2014 they undermine the development of individuals who\nwould manifest human excellence.
