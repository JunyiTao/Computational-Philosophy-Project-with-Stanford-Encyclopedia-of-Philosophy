    "main_text": "\n\nA good argument is one whose conclusions follow from its premises; its\nconclusions are consequences of its premises. But in what\nsense do conclusions follow from premises? What is it for a\nconclusion to be a consequence of premises? Those questions,\nin many respects, are at the heart of logic (as a philosophical\ndiscipline). Consider the following argument:\n\nIf we charge high fees for university, only the rich will enroll.\n\nWe charge high fees for university.\n\nTherefore, only the rich will enroll.\n\n\nThere are many different things one can say about this argument, but\nmany agree that if we do not equivocate (if the terms mean the same\nthing in the premises and the conclusion) then the argument is\nvalid, that is, the conclusion follows deductively from the\npremises. This does not mean that the conclusion is true. Perhaps the\npremises are not true. However, if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is also true, as a matter of logic. This entry is about the\nrelation between premises and conclusions in valid arguments.\n\nContemporary analyses of the concept of consequence\u2014of the\nfollows from relation\u2014take it to be both\nnecessary and formal, with such answers often being\nexplicated via proofs or models (or, in some cases,\nboth). Our aim in this article is to provide a brief characterisation\nof some of the notions that play a central role in contemporary\naccounts of logical consequence.\n\nWe should note that we only highlight a few of the\nphilosophical aspects of logical consequence, leaving out\nalmost all technical details, and also leaving out a large number of\nphilosophical debates about the topic. Our rationale for doing as much\nis that one will get the technical details, and the particular\nphilosophical issues that motivated them, from looking at specific\nlogics\u2014specific theories of logical consequence (e.g.,\nrelevant logics, substructural logics, non-monotonic logics, dynamic\nlogics, modal logics, theories of quantification, and so on).\n(Moreover, debates about almost any feature of\nlanguage\u2014structure versus form of sentences, propositions,\ncontext sensitivity, meaning, even truth\u2014are relevant to debates\nabout logical consequence, making an exhaustive discussion practically\nimpossible.) Our aim here is simply to touch on a few of the very\nbasic issues that are central to logical consequence.\n",
