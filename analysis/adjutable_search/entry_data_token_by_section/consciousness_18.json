    "main_text": "The explanatory question: How can consciousness exist? || Reductive and non-reductive explanation\n5.3 Reductive and non-reductive explanation\n\n\nAs the need for intelligible linkage has shown, a priori\ndeducibility is not in itself obviously sufficient for successful\nexplanation (Kim 1980), nor is it clearly necessary. Some weaker\nlogical link might suffice in many explanatory contexts. We can\nsometimes tell enough of a story about how facts of one sort depend\nupon those of another to satisfy ourselves that the latter do in fact\ncause or realize the former even if we can not strictly deduce all the\nformer facts from the latter.\n\n\nStrict intertheoretical deduction was taken as the reductive norm by\nthe logical empiricist account of the unity of science (Putnam and\nOppenheim 1958), but in more recent decades a looser nonreductive\npicture of relations among the various sciences has gained favor. In\nparticular, nonreductive materialists have argued for the so called\n\u201cautonomy of the special sciences\u201d (Fodor 1974) and for the\nview that understanding the natural world requires us to use a\ndiversity of conceptual and representational systems that may not be\nstrictly intertranslatable or capable of being put into the tight\ncorrespondence required by the older deductive paradigm of interlevel\nrelations (Putnam 1975).\n\n\nEconomics is often cited as an example (Fodor 1974, Searle 1992).\nEconomic facts may be realized by underlying physical processes, but no\none seriously demands that we be able to deduce the relevant economic\nfacts from detailed descriptions of their underlying physical bases or\nthat we be able to put the concepts and vocabulary of economics in\ntight correspondence with those of the physical sciences.\n\n\nNonetheless our deductive inability is not seen as cause for\nontological misgivings; there is no \u201cmoney-matter\u201d problem.\nAll that we require is some general and less than deductive\nunderstanding of how economic properties and relations might be\nunderlain by physical ones. Thus one might opt for a similar criterion\nfor interpreting the How question and for what counts as explaining how\nconsciousness might be caused or realized by nonconscious items.\nHowever, some critics, such as Kim (1987), have challenged the\ncoherence of any view that aims to be both non-reductive and\nphysicalist, though supporters of such views have replied in turn (Van\nGulick 1993).\n\n\nOthers have argued that consciousness is especially resistant to\nexplanation in physical terms because of the inherent differences\nbetween our subjective and objective modes of understanding. Thomas\nNagel famously argued (1974) that there are unavoidable limits placed on our\nability to understand the phenomenology of bat experience by our\ninability to empathetically take on an experiential perspective like\nthat which characterizes the bat's echo-locatory auditory experience of\nits world. Given our inability to undergo similar experience, we can\nhave at best partial understanding of the nature of such experience. No\namount of knowledge gleaned from the external objective third-person\nperspective of the natural sciences will supposedly suffice to allow us\nto understand what the bat can understand of its own experience from\nits internal first-person subjective point of view.\n",
