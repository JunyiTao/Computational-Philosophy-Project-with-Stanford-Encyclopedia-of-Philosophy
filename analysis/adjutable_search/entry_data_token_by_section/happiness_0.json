    "main_text": "The meanings of \u2018happiness\u2019 || Two senses of \u2018happiness\u2019\n1.1 Two senses of \u2018happiness\u2019\n\nWhat is happiness? This question has no straightforward answer,\nbecause the meaning of the question itself is unclear. What exactly is\nbeing asked? Perhaps you want to know what the word\n\u2018happiness\u2019 means. In that case your inquiry is\nlinguistic. Chances are you had something more interesting in mind:\nperhaps you want to know about the thing, happiness, itself.\nIs it pleasure, a life of prosperity, something else? Yet we\ncan\u2019t answer that question until we have some notion of what we\nmean by the word.\n\nPhilosophers who write about \u201chappiness\u201d typically take\ntheir subject matter to be either of two things, each corresponding to\na different sense of the term:\n\nA state of mind\nA life that goes well for the person leading it\n\n\nIn the first case our concern is simply a psychological matter. Just\nas inquiry about pleasure or depression fundamentally concerns\nquestions of psychology, inquiry about happiness in this\nsense\u2014call it the (long-term) \u201cpsychological\nsense\u201d\u2014is fundamentally the study of certain mental\nstates. What is this state of mind we call happiness? Typical answers\nto this question include life satisfaction, pleasure, or a positive\nemotional condition.\n\nHaving answered that question, a further question arises: how\nvaluable is this mental state? Since \u2018happiness\u2019\nin this sense is just a psychological term, you could intelligibly say\nthat happiness isn\u2019t valuable at all. Perhaps you are a\nhigh-achieving intellectual who thinks that only ignoramuses can be\nhappy. On this sort of view, happy people are to be pitied, not\nenvied. The present article will center on happiness in the\npsychological sense.\n\nIn the second case, our subject matter is a kind of value,\nnamely what philosophers nowadays tend to call prudential\nvalue\u2014or, more commonly, well-being,\nwelfare, utility or flourishing. (For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n well-being.\n Whether these terms are really equivalent remains a matter of\ndispute, but this article will usually treat them as interchangeable.)\n\u201cHappiness\u201d in this sense concerns what benefits a person,\nis good for her, makes her better off, serves her interests, or is\ndesirable for her for her sake. To be high in well-being is to be\nfaring well, doing well, fortunate, or in an enviable condition.\nIll-being, or doing badly, may call for sympathy or pity, whereas we\nenvy or rejoice in the good fortune of others, and feel gratitude for\nour own. Being good for someone differs from simply\nbeing good, period: perhaps it is always good, period, for you to be\nhonest; yet it may not always be good for you, as\nwhen it entails self-sacrifice. Not coincidentally, the word\n\u2018happiness\u2019 derives from the term for good fortune, or\n\u201cgood hap,\u201d and indeed the terms used to translate it in\nother languages often have similar roots. In this sense of the\nterm\u2014call it the \u201cwell-being sense\u201d\u2014happiness\nrefers to a life of well-being or flourishing: a life that goes well\nfor you.\n\nImportantly, to ascribe happiness in the well-being sense is to make a\nvalue judgment: namely, that the person has whatever it is\nthat benefits a\n person.[1]\n If you and I and have different values, then we may well differ about\nwhich lives we consider happy. I might think Genghis Khan had a happy\nlife, because I think what matters for well-being is getting what you\nwant; while you deny this because you think a life of evildoing,\nhowever \u201csuccessful,\u201d is sad and impoverished.\n\nTheories of well-being\u2014and hence of \u201chappiness\u201d in\nthe well-being sense\u2014come in three basic flavors, according to\nthe best-known taxonomy (Parfit 1984): hedonism, desire theories, and\nobjective list theories. Whereas hedonists identify well-being roughly\nwith experiences of pleasure, desire theorists equate it with the\nsatisfaction of one\u2019s desires\u2014actually getting\nwhat you want, versus merely having certain experiences. Both hedonism\nand desire theories are in some sense subjectivist, since they ground\nwell-being in the individual\u2019s subjective states. Objective list\ntheorists, by contrast, think some things benefit us independently of\nour attitudes or feelings: there are objective prudential goods.\nAristotelians are the best-known example: they take well-being\n(eudaimonia) to consist in a life of virtuous\nactivity\u2014or more broadly, the fulfillment of our human\ncapacities. A passive but contented couch potato may be getting what\nhe wants, and he may enjoy it. But he would not, on Aristotelian and\nother objective list theories, count as doing well, or leading a happy\nlife.\n",
