    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Ethics\n\nDewey wrote extensively on ethics throughout his career; some writings\nwere explicitly about ethics, but ethical analyses are present in\nworks with other\n foci.[35]\n As elsewhere, Dewey critiques then reconstructs traditional views; he\nargued it is typical for traditional systems (e.g., teleological,\ndeontological, or virtue-based) to seek comprehensive and monocausal\naccounts of, for example, ultimate aims, duties, or values. Such ideal\ntheory is obligated to explain morality\u2019s requirements for all\nindividuals actions or character.\n\nDewey, in contrast, argued for a more experimental approach. Rather\nthan a grand and final explanatory account of moral life, ethics\ndescribes intelligent methods for dealing with novel and morally\nperplexing situations. There are no stipulated, ultimate values, nor\nshould any be\n sought.[36]\n At best, the only value toward which he would gesture was\n \u201cgrowth\u201d.[37]\n Ethics means inquiry into concrete, problematic conditions; such\ninquiry may use theories to inform hypotheses tested in experience.\nReliable hypotheses may come to be called \u201cknowledge\u201d, but\nmust, in the end, be considered fallible and revisable. Actual\nresolutions to moral problems, Dewey observed, typically point toward\nplural factors (aims, duties, virtues), rather than just one\n(TIF, LW5). Moreover, actual conduct (including inquiry) is\nundertaken not by isolated, rational actors but by\nfundamentally social\n beings.[38]\n \u201cConduct\u201d, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nis always shared; this is the difference between it and a\nphysiological process. It is not an ethical \u201cought\u201d that\nconduct should be social. It is social, whether bad\nor good. (HNC, MW14: 16)\n\n\nDewey\u2019s ethical theory, like those in education and politics,\nutilizes his transactional views of experience, habit, inquiry, and\nthe communicative, social self. It also exemplifies Dewey\u2019s\nmetaphysics of a world both precarious and stable, where\nconflict is natural and quests to deny or permanently eradicate it are\n fantastical.[39]\n Conflict is a generic trait of life, not a defect; theories denying\nthis tend to be so reductive and absolutist that they divorce inquiry\nfrom the essential details of concrete situations, cultures, and\npersons. Such strategies tend to\n fail.[40]\n\nProgress in ethical theory, then, means improvements that render\ninquiry more discriminating, more revelatory of alternatives and\n consequences.[41]\n Improved deliberation is crucial to more effective inquiry; Dewey\nargued this requires being open to contributions from many sources:\nall sciences, social customs, jurisprudence, biographies, and, yes,\neven moral systems of the\n past.[42]\n Deliberation especially benefits from what Dewey called\n\u201cdramatic rehearsal\u201d, where creative and dramatic\nenactment adds to logical tools and helps illuminate the emotional\nweight and color of potential ethical\n choices.[43]\n\nFor further details on Dewey\u2019s ethics, see the entry\n Dewey\u2019s moral philosophy\n by E. Anderson (2018). \n",
