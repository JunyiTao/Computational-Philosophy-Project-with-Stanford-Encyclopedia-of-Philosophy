    "main_text": "Metaphysics of Mechanisms || Token Mechanisms, Type Mechanisms, and Laws\n4.1 Token Mechanisms, Type Mechanisms, and Laws\nIn much of the early literature on mechanisms, mechanisms are\ncontrasted explicitly with laws of nature (Bechtel 1988; Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen 2005; MDC 2000). This contrast clearly grew out of an\nemerging consensus in philosophy that there are few, or perhaps no,\nlaws of biology (see Section 3.1 above). The\nempirical generalizations one finds in biology tend to be hedged\nby ceteris paribus clauses; whether they hold or not depends\non background conditions that might not hold and on conditions\ninternal to the mechanism that might fail.  These generalizations, in\nshort, are mechanistically explicable; what necessity they have\nderives from a mechanism (Cummins 2000; Glennan 1996). Mechanisms thus\nseem to play the role of laws in the biological sciences: we seek\nmechanisms to explain, predict, and control phenomena in nature even\nif mechanisms lack many of the characteristics definitive of laws in\nthe logical empiricist framework (such as universality, inviolable\nnecessity, or unrestricted scope).\nOne specific strand of this discussion emerged from consideration\nof Weber\u2019s (2005) argument that biology is heteronymous,\ni.e., that it ultimately borrows its explanatory power from the laws\nof physics and chemistry. Weber uses Hodgkin and Huxley\u2019s model of the\naction potential as an exemplar of the reducing biological phenomena\nto physical laws (such as Ohm\u2019s law and the Nernst equation). Craver\n(2006) responds that the explanatory force of Hodgkin and\nHuxley\u2019s model, in fact, requires a grasp of the distinctly biological\nproperties of ion channels, which properties were black-boxed in\nHodgkin and Huxley\u2019s total current equation (see also Craver 2007;\nBogen 2008b; Weber 2008).\nYet the contrast between laws and mechanisms has not always been\nentirely clear. Some, such as Bogen (2005), Machamer (2004), and\nGlennan (forthcoming) emphasize that causes and mechanisms are, at\nbase, singular, not general or universal. Leuridan (2010), building on\nthe work of Mitchell (2000), objects that mechanisms cannot replace\nlaws of nature in our conceptual understanding of explanation and the\nmetaphysics of science. Scientists rarely investigate token\nmechanisms, one might think, but are much more interested in\ntypes. And once one starts talking about types of mechanisms, one is\nback in the business of formulating general regularities about how\nmechanisms work. So it would appear that the concept of mechanism\ncannot supplant the work that generalization was supposed to do, but\nrequires the idea of regularity, and so something akin to laws, if it\nis to do that explanatory work (see Andersen 2011, 2012, 2014a,b;\nKrickel 2014). For a reply to Leuridan, see Kaiser and Craver (2013).\n \n",
