    "main_text": "A Brief Presentation\n1. A Brief Presentation\n\nModal logics are particularly well suited to study a wide range of\nphilosophical concepts, including different kinds of beliefs,\nobligations, knowledge, time, space, intentions, desires, obligations,\nevidence, preferences and diverse types of ontic and epistemic\nactions, among many others. Indeed, all these concepts have specific\ncontext-dependent features, which indicates that they can be best\nstudied using models that can express different modes of truth (e.g.,\nboth global and local truth). Such an analysis provides us with the\nkey insights of the basic building blocks and principles that regulate\nthese different notions. This has proven to be useful in a wide range\nof academic disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence,\nPsychology, Social Sciences, Economics, Physics and so on. But, as\nScott\u2019s quote above suggests, there is something missing when\nsuch philosophical concepts are studied in isolation. A big part of\nwhat defines a concept lies in the way it interacts with others. For\ninstance, rational beliefs are expected to rely on proper\narguments, justifications or evidence;\ndisjunctions may not behave as they do in natural language in\nthe context of obligations; knowledge is better\nunderstood when looking for the actions that modify it;\nintentions may be understood as derived from desires\nand beliefs. What is required for this study are logical\nsystems with more than one modal operator, commonly known as\nmulti-modal logics, describing not only the isolated properties of the\nindividual concepts, but also the way they relate to one another.\nIndeed, multi-modal logics have been designed for a wide range of\napplications, including reasoning about time, space, knowledge,\nbeliefs, intentions, desires, obligations, actions such as public and\nprivate communication, observations, measurements, moves in a game and\nothers.\n\nThe present text intends to give a brief (but broad) overview of the\ninteraction between many different philosophical concepts, and to show\nhow the use of multi-modal logical systems can shed some light on\nthese concepts\u2019 interaction. We start in\n section 2\n (Defining concepts in terms of others) by discussing basic\nscenarios that, starting from existing systems, use a combination of\n\u2018syntactic\u2019 and \u2018semantic\u2019 strategies for\ndefining further concepts. These cases are based on the idea that some\nnotions can be defined in terms of others, with the famous\nunderstanding of knowledge as justified true belief being one of the\nmost notable examples. An alternative to this idea is to consider that\nthe involved concepts emerge independently, but are still somehow\nrelated, as the case of the relationship between knowledge and time.\nFrom a formal perspective, this amounts to looking at the different\nmodes in which two (or more) existing systems can be combined.\n Section 3\n on General strategies for combining modal systems presents\nan overview of some of the most relevant strategies. After this\nslightly technical excursion, the discussion takes a philosophical\nperspective, describing first combinations of multiple modalities\n (section 4\n on Significant interactions between modalities), and\nfinishing with examples of cases where the interaction between\nmodalities sheds light on philosophical issues\n (section 5\n on Multi-modal systems in philosophical discussions).\n\nA note on notation and the level of\ntechnicality To discuss aspects of multi-modal logic, this\nentry assumes basic knowledge of\n modal logic,\n specifically about its language and its relational\n \u2018possible worlds\u2019\n semantics (though other semantic models will be mentioned too). In\nparticular, a relational model is understood as a tuple containing a\nset of possible worlds, one or more (typically binary) relations\nbetween them, and a valuation indicating what each possible world\nactually represents. Such structures can be described by different\nmodal languages. We will use \\(\\cL\\) to denote the standard\npropositional language, and \\(\\cL_{\\left\\{ O_1, \\ldots, O_n\n\\right\\}}\\) to denote its extension with modalities \\(O_1\\), \u2026,\n\\(O_n\\). Given a relational model M and a formula \\(\\varphi\\),\nwe will use \\(\\llbracket \\varphi \\rrbracket^{M}\\) to denote the set of\nworlds in M where \\(\\varphi\\) holds. Readers can find more\ndetails about the basics of modal logic not only in the referred SEP\nentries, but also in the initial chapters of Blackburn, Rijke, &\nVenema (2001) and van Benthem (2010), and also in Blackburn & van\nBenthem (2006).\n\nStill, the goal of this text is not to provide a comprehensive study\nof the topic, but rather to highlight the most interesting and\nintriguing aspects. Thus, although some level of formal discussion\nwill be used, most technical details will be restricted to the\n appendix.\n",
