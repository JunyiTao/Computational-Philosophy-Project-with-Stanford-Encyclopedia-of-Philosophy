Early Writings: From the System of Objects to The Mirror of Production\n\n\nJean Baudrillard was born in the cathedral town of Reims, France in\n1929. He told interviewers that his grandparents were peasants and his\nparents became civil servants (Gane 1993: 19). Baudrillard also claims\nthat he was the first member of his family to pursue an advanced\neducation and that this led to a rupture with his parents and cultural\nmilieu. In 1956, he began working as a professor of secondary education\nin a French high school (Lyce\u00e9) and in the early 1960s did\neditorial work for the French publisher Seuil. Baudrillard was\ninitially a Germanist who published essays on literature in Les\ntemps modernes in 1962\u20131963 and translated works of Peter Weiss\nand Bertolt Brecht into French, as well as a book on messianic\nrevolutionary movements by Wilhelm M\u00fchlmann. During this period,\nhe met and studied the works of Henri Lefebvre, whose critiques of\neveryday life impressed him, and Roland Barthes, whose semiological\nanalyses of contemporary society had lasting influence on his work.\n\n\nIn 1966, Baudrillard entered the University of Paris, Nanterre, and\nbecame Lefebvre\u2019s assistant, while studying languages,\nphilosophy, sociology, and other disciplines. He defended his\n\u201cThese de Troisi\u00e8me Cycle\u201d in sociology at Nanterre\nin 1966 with a dissertation on \u201cLe syst\u00e8me des\nobjects,\u201d and began teaching sociology in October of that year.\nOpposing French and U.S. intervention in the Algerian and Vietnamese\nwars, Baudrillard associated himself with the French Left in the 1960s.\nNanterre was a key site of radical politics and the \u201cMarch 22\nmovement,\u201d associated with Daniel Cohn-Bendit and the\nenrag\u00e9s, began in the Nanterre sociology department.\nBaudrillard said later that he participated in the events of May 1968\nthat resulted in massive student uprisings and a general strike that\nalmost drove de Gaulle from power.\n\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Baudrillard published a series of books that\nwould eventually make him world famous. Influenced by Lefebvre,\nBarthes, and a series of French thinkers whose influence will be\ndiscussed below, Baudrillard undertook serious work in the field of\nsocial theory, semiology, and psychoanalysis in the 1960s and published\nhis first book The System of Objects in 1968 (1996), followed\nby a book on The Consumer Society in 1970 (1998), and For\na Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign in\n1972\n (1981).[2]\nThese early\npublications are attempts, within the framework of critical sociology,\nto combine the studies of everyday life initiated by Lefebvre (1971 and\n1991 [1947]) with a social semiology that studies the life of signs in\nsocial life. This project, influenced by Barthes (1967 [1964], 1972\n[1958], and 1983 [1967]), centers on the system of objects in the\nconsumer society (the focus of his first two books), and the interface\nbetween political economy and semiotics (the nucleus of his\nthird\n book).[3]\nBaudrillard\u2019s\nearly work was one of the first to appropriate semiology to analyze how\nobjects are encoded with a system of signs and meanings that constitute\ncontemporary media and consumer societies. Combining semiological\nstudies, Marxian political economy, and sociology of the consumer\nsociety, Baudrillard began his life-long task of exploring the system\nof objects and signs which forms our everyday life.\n\n\nThe early Baudrillard described the meanings invested in the objects\nof everyday life (e.g., the power accrued through identification with\none\u2019s automobile when driving) and the structural system through\nwhich objects were organized into a new modern society (e.g., the\nprestige or sign-value of a new sports car). In his first\nthree books, Baudrillard maintained that the classical Marxian critique\nof political economy needed to be supplemented by semiological theories\nof the sign which articulated the diverse meanings signified by\nsignifiers into languages organized into systems of meaning.\nBaudrillard, following Barthes and others, argued that fashion, sports,\nthe media, and other modes of signification produced systems of meaning\narticulated by specific rules, codes, and logics (terms used somewhat\ninterchangeably by Baudrillard which are elucidated in more detail\nbelow).\n\n\nSituating his analysis of signs, language, and everyday life in a\nhistorical framework, Baudrillard argued that the transition from the\nearlier stage of competitive market capitalism to the stage of monopoly\ncapitalism required increased attention to demand management, to\naugmenting and steering consumption. At this historical stage, from\naround 1920 to the 1960s, the need to intensify demand supplemented\nconcern with lowering production costs and with expanding production.\nIn this era of capitalist development, economic concentration, new\nproduction techniques, and the development of new technologies,\naccelerated capacity for mass production and capitalist corporations\nfocused increased attention on managing consumption and creating needs\nfor new prestigious goods, thus producing the regime of what\nBaudrillard has called sign-value.\n\n\nOn Baudrillard\u2019s analysis, advertising, packaging, display,\nfashion, \u201cemancipated\u201d sexuality, mass media and culture,\nand the proliferation of commodities multiplied the quantity of signs\nand spectacles, and produced a proliferation of sign-value. Henceforth,\nBaudrillard claims, commodities are not merely to be characterized by\nuse-value and exchange value, as in Marx\u2019s theory of the\ncommodity, but sign-value \u2014 the expression and mark of style,\nprestige, luxury, power, and so on \u2014 becomes an increasingly\nimportant part of the commodity and consumption (see Goldman and Papson\n1996).\n\n\nFrom this perspective, Baudrillard claims that commodities are\nbought and displayed as much for their sign-value as their use-value,\nand that the phenomenon of sign-value has become an essential\nconstituent of the commodity and consumption in the consumer society.\nThis position was influenced by Veblen\u2019s notion of\n\u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d and display of commodities\nanalyzed in his Theory of the Leisure Class that Baudrillard\nargued has become extended to everyone in the consumer society. For\nBaudrillard, the entire society is organized around consumption and\ndisplay of commodities through which individuals gain prestige,\nidentity, and standing. In this system, the more prestigious\none\u2019s commodities (houses, cars, clothes, and so on), the higher\none\u2019s standing in the realm of sign value. Thus, just as words\ntake on meaning according to their position in a differential system of\nlanguage, so sign values take on meaning according to their place in a\ndifferential system of prestige and status.\n\n\nIn The Consumer Society, Baudrillard concludes by extolling\n\u201cmultiple forms of refusal\u201d of social convention,\nconspicuous consumption, and conformist thought and behavior, all of\nwhich can be fused in a \u201cpractice of radical change\u201d (1998:\n183). He alludes here to the expectation of \u201cviolent eruptions\nand sudden disintegration which will come, just as unforeseeably and as\ncertainly May 68, to wreck this white mass\u201d [of consumption]\n(1998: 196). On the other hand, Baudrillard also describes a situation\nwhere alienation is so total that it cannot be surpassed because\n\u201cit is the very structure of market society\u201d (1998: 190).\nHis argument is that in a society where everything is a commodity that\ncan be bought and sold, alienation is total. Indeed, the term\n\u201calienation\u201d originally signified \u201cto sale,\u201d\nand in a totally commodified society, alienation is ubiquitous.\nMoreover, Baudrillard posits \u201cthe end of transcendence\u201d (a\nphrase borrowed from Marcuse) where individuals can neither perceive\ntheir own true needs or another way of life (1998: 190ff).\n\nBaudrillard and Neo-Marxism\n\n\nBy 1970, Baudrillard has distinguished himself from the Marxist\ntheory of revolution and instead postulates only the possibility of\nrevolt against the consumer society in an \u201cunforeseeable but\ncertain\u201d form. In the late 1960s, he had associated himself with\na group of intellectuals around the journal Utopie which\nsought to overcome disciplinary boundaries and in the spirit of Guy\nDebord and the Situationist International to combine reflections on\nalternative societies, architecture, and modes of\neveryday\n life.[4]\nBringing together\nindividuals on the margins of architecture, city planning, cultural\ncriticism and social theory, Baudrillard and his associates\ndistinguished themselves from other political and theoretical groupings\nand developed idiosyncratic and marginal discourse beyond the\nboundaries of established disciplines and political tendencies. This\naffiliation with Utopie only lasted into the early 1970s, but\nit may have helped produce in him a desire to work on the margins, to\nstand aside from current trends and fads, and to develop his own\ntheoretical positions. His articles from this project have been\ncollected in English translation in Utopia Deferred\n(2006a).\n\n\nBaudrillard thus had an ambivalent relation to classical Marxism by\nthe early 1970s. On one hand, he carried forward the Marxian critique\nof commodity production which delineates and criticizes various forms\nof alienation, domination, and exploitation produced by capitalism. At\nthis stage, it appeared that his critique takes place from the standard\nneo-Marxian vantage point which assumes that capitalism is blameworthy\nbecause it is homogenizing, controlling and dominating social life,\nwhile robbing individuals of their freedom, creativity, time and human\npotentialities. On the other hand, he cannot point to any revolutionary\nforces and in particular did not discuss the situation and potential of\nthe working class as an agent of change in the consumer society.\nIndeed, Baudrillard has no theory of the subject as an active agent of\nsocial change whatsoever, thus following the structuralist and\npoststructuralist critique of the philosophical and practical subject\ncategorized by Descartes, Kant, and Sartre which was long dominant in\nFrench thought. Structuralists and poststructuralists argued that\nsubjectivity was produced by language, social institutions, and\ncultural forms and was not independent of its construction in these\ninstitutions and practices.\n\n\nNor does Baudrillard develop a theory of class or group revolt, or\nany theory of political organization, struggle, or strategy of the sort\nfrequent in post-1960s France. Yet Baudrillard\u2019s work here is\nparticularly close to the work of the Frankfurt school, especially that\nof Herbert Marcuse, who had already developed some of the first Marxist\ncritiques of the consumer society (see Kellner 1984 and 1989b). Like\nLuk\u00e0cs (1971) and the Frankfurt School, Baudrillard analyzes how\nthe commodity and commodification permeate social life and come to\ndominate individual thought and behavior. Following the general line of\ncritical Marxism, Baudrillard argues that the process of social\nhomogenization, alienation, and exploitation constitutes a process of\nreification in commodities, technologies, and things (i.e.,\n\u201cobjects\u201d) come to dominate people (\u201csubjects\u201d)\ndivesting them of their human qualities and capacities.\n\n\nFor Luk\u00e0cs, the Frankfurt School, and Baudrillard,\nreification \u2014 the process whereby human beings become\ndominated by things and become more thinglike themselves \u2014 comes\nto govern social life. Conditions of labor imposed submission and\nstandardization on human life, as well as exploiting workers and\nalienating them from a life of freedom and self-determination. In a\nmedia and consumer society, culture and consumption also became\nhomogenized, depriving individuals of the possibility of cultivating\nindividuality and self-determination.\n\n\nIn a sense, Baudrillard\u2019s work can be read as an account of a\nfurther stage of reification and social domination than that described\nby the Frankfurt School who described how individuals were controlled\nby ruling institutions and modes of thought. Baudrillard goes beyond\nthe Frankfurt School by applying the semiological theory of the sign to\ndescribe how commodities, media, and technologies provide a universe of\nillusion and fantasy in which individuals become overpowered by\nconsumer values, media ideologies and role models, and seductive\ntechnologies like computers which provide worlds of cyberspace.\nEventually, he will take his analysis of domination by signs and the\nsystem of objects to even more pessimistic conclusions where he\nconcludes that the thematic of the \u201cend of the individual\u201d\nsketched by the Frankfurt School has reached its fruition in the total\ndefeat of human subjectivity by the object world (see\n Section 3).\n\n\nYet in some writings, Baudrillard has a somewhat more active theory\nof consumption than that of the Frankfurt School\u2019s that generally\nportrays consumption as a passive mode of social integration. By\ncontrast, consumption in Baudrillard\u2019s early writings is itself a\nkind of labor, \u201can active manipulation of signs,\u201d a way of\ninserting oneself within the consumer society, and working to\ndifferentiate oneself from others. Yet this active manipulation of\nsigns is not equivalent to postulating an active human subject that\ncould resist, redefine, or produce its own signs, thus Baudrillard\nfails to develop a genuine theory of agency.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s first three works can thus be read in the\nframework of a neo-Marxian critique of capitalist societies. One could\nread Baudrillard\u2019s emphasis on consumption as a supplement to\nMarx\u2019s analysis of production and his focus on culture and signs\nas an important supplement to classical Marxian political economy,\nwhich adds a cultural and semiological dimension to the Marxian\nproject. But in his 1973 provocation, The Mirror of Production\n(translated into English in 1975), Baudrillard carries out a systematic\nattack on classical Marxism, claiming that Marxism is but a mirror of\nbourgeois society, placing production at the center of life, thus\nnaturalizing the capitalist organization of society.\n\n\nAlthough in the 1960s, Baudrillard participated in the tumultuous\nevents of May 1968, and was associated with the revolutionary Left and\nMarxism, he broke with Marxism in the early 1970s, but remained\npolitically radical though unaffiliated the rest of the decade. Like\nmany on the Left, Baudrillard was disappointed that the French\nCommunist Party did not support the radical \u201860s movements and he\nalso distrusted the official Marxism of theorists like Louis Althusser\nwho he found dogmatic and reductive. Consequently, Baudrillard began a\nradical critique of Marxism, one that would be repeated by many of his\ncontemporaries who would also take a postmodern turn (see Best and\nKellner 1991 and 1997).\n\n\nBaudrillard (1975) argues that Marxism, first, does not adequately\nilluminate premodern societies that were organized around religion,\nmythology, and tribal organization and not production. He also argues\nthat Marxism does not provide a sufficiently radical critique of\ncapitalist societies and alternative critical discourses and\nperspectives. At this stage, Baudrillard turns to anthropological\nperspectives on premodern societies for hints of more emancipatory\nalternatives. Yet it is important to note that this critique of Marxism\nwas taken from the Left, arguing that Marxism did not provide a radical\nenough critique of, or alternative to, contemporary capitalist and\ncommunist societies organized around production. Baudrillard concluded\nthat French communist failure to support the May 68 movements was\nrooted in part in a conservatism that had roots in Marxism itself.\nHence, Baudrillard and others of his generation began searching for\nalternative critical positions.\n",
