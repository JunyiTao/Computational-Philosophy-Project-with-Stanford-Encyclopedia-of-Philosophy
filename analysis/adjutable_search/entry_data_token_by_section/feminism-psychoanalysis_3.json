    "main_text": "French Feminism\n4. French Feminism\n\nFrench Feminism is in many ways a misnomer since the authors thus\ncharacterized are rarely of French origin or nationality (although\nFrench is the predominant language of their writing) and not\nnecessarily overtly self-identified as feminist. The writers\naffiliated with French Feminism, including Luce Irigaray, Julia\nKristeva, Sarah Kofman, Catherine Clement, and Helene Cixous, among\nothers, variously ask about the relation between the maternal and the\nfeminine, doubt that we can say what a woman is, worry about\nFreud\u2019s lack of attention to mothers, play with writing style,\nwonder about feminine subjectivity, ask if women can be subjects or\ncitizens without adapting to masculine norms, impeach Lacan\u2019s\nphallocentrism, and suspect that access to language assimilates women\ninto neutralized brothers. Unlike Beauvoir, they are philosophically\nand temperamentally more sympathetic to the split of subjectivity\ndetailed by psychoanalysis, the idea that I am not I, that\nself-division rather than self-identity is the fundamental feature of\nhuman existence, and therefore that the subject is not a unitary point\nof origin for choice. Like Beauvoir, they ask whether the structures\nof femininity and the structures of subjectivity are compatible,\ncommensurable, reconcilable, and are vexed by the apprehension that\nthey are fundamentally at odds. While they aim to disentangle\nfemininity from maternity, and provide a critique of their conflation,\nthey also take seriously the significance of maternity for women and\nfor children of both sexes. Because they concede the limits of\nsocio-cultural explanations for women\u2019s lack of standing in the\nsocial contract, and take femininity and the feminine body as points\nof departure for speech or writing, they have often been accused of\nessentialism. Below I focus on the work of Irigaray and Kristeva,\nexamining how they engage with and transform the ideas of Freud and\nLacan, and how they articulate sexual difference as integrally\nconnected to the foundation, and disruption, of a symbolic order.\n",
