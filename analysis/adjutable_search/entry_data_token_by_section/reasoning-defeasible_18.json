Logical Approaches\n\nLogical approaches to defeasible reasoning treat the subject as a part\nof logic: the study of nonmonotonic consequence relations (in\ncontrast to the monotonicity of classical logic). These relations are\ndefined on propositions, not on the beliefs of an agent, so the focus\nis not on epistemology per se, although a theory of nonmonotonic logic\nwill certainly have implications for epistemology.\n",
