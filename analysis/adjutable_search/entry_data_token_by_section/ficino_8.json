The immortality of the human soul represented\nFicino\u2019s main preoccupation, fearing as he did the potential loss of\nbelief among intellectual elites. He entitled the first chapter of\nhis Platonic Theology accordingly: \u201cWere the soul not\nimmortal, no creature would be more miserable than man.\u201d (Allen\nand Hankins 2001\u201306, 1.1, vol. 1, p. 14\u201315) The reason\nbehind this statement is Ficino\u2019s conception, shared with many other\nthinkers, that the human soul is endowed with a \u201cnatural\nappetite\u201d that induces it, however haltingly and diversely\n(owing to its en-mattered state), to return to its divine origin\n(Kristeller 1988, 181; Ficino 1576, 1187). Ficino writes that\n\u201cman alone never rests in his present habit of living: he alone\nis a pilgrim in these regions and cannot rest on the journey as long\nas he aspires to his celestial homeland, which all of us seek,\nalthough we proceed on sundry paths on account of the diversity of\nopinion and of judgment.\u201d (Allen and Hankins 2001\u201306,\n14.7, vol. 5, p.  272\u201373)\n\n\nIf Ficino shared this notion with Plotinus, and indeed with all\nPlatonists, he differed concerning the issue of the transmigration of\nsouls. Since Plato\u2019s Myth of Er in the Republic\n(10.614\u2013621), a staple of Platonism had been the notion that\nsouls were not only immortal but that they had also pre-existed before\ntheir human embodiment and that they would exist again in another body\nwhen the human body-soul dyad was severed after death. Since this\nnotion was heretical to Christian ears (both because it precluded\nthe ex nihilo creation of each and every human soul and\nbecause God, having created man in His own image, could not allow a\nhuman soul eventually to be reincarnated as an animal), Ficino had to\ncombat it. In his view, Plato himself must be read more sensitively,\nso that in different contexts Ficino spoke of this heretical notion as\nprefiguring bodily resurrection, as allusions to the return of the\nsoul to the One, or failing that as a hateful doctrine that must be\nattributed, not to Plato, but to Pythagoras (Hankins 1989,\n358\u201359; Celenza 1999, 681\u201399; Allen and Hankins\n2001\u201306, 17.4, vol. 6, p.  45\u201363)\n\n\nOne final point needs to be made regarding Ficino and the human soul,\nwhich is that he emphatically did not theorize it as an\n\u201cextension-less\u201d mind, as Descartes later would do in his\nMeditations (Descartes, Oeuvres 7: 71\u201390). Ficino\u2019s\nsoul-body dualism was not the same as \u201cmind-body\u201d dualism,\nnor indeed was it for Plato, for late ancient Platonists, or for\nmedieval thinkers before Ficino (Celenza 2007, 88\u201389). For\nFicino as for his predecessors, the human soul, and \u201cSoul\u201d\nin general, could have material effects on the phenomenological world\nin ways that \u201cmind\u201d could not in the Cartesian\ntradition.\n",
