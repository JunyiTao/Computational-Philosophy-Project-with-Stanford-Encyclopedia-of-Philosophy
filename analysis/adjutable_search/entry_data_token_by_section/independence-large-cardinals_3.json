Large Cardinal Axioms and the Interpretability Hierarchy\n\n\nThe large cardinal axioms discussed above are naturally well-ordered\nin terms of strength.[11]\nThis provides a natural way of climbing the hierarchy of\ninterpretability.  At the base we start with the theory\nZFC-Infinity and then we climb to ZFC and up through\nZFC+\u03a6 for various large cardinal axioms \u03a6.  Notice that for\ntwo large cardinal axioms \u03a6 and \u03a8, if \u03a8 is stronger\nthan \u03a6 then \u03a8 implies that there is a standard model of\n\u03a6 and so we have a natural interpretation of ZFC+\u03a6 in\nZFC+\u03a8.\n\n\nWe have already noted that ZFC+\u00acPM is mutually interpretable\nwith ZFC+LC where LC is the large cardinal axiom \u201cThere is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal\u201d and that this is shown using the dual\ntechniques of inner and outer model theory.  It is a remarkable\nempirical fact that for any \u201cnatural\u201d statement in the\nlanguage of set theory \u03c6 one can generally find a large cardinal\naxiom \u03a6 such that ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03a6 are mutually\ninterpretable.  Again, this is established using the dual techniques\nof inner and outer model theory only now large cardinals enter the\nmix.  To establish that ZFC+\u03a6 interprets ZFC+\u03c6 one\ngenerally starts with a model of ZFC+\u03a6 and uses forcing to\nconstruct a model of ZFC+\u03c6.  In many cases the forcing\nconstruction involves \u201ccollapsing\u201d the large cardinal associated\nwith \u03a6 and arranging the collapse in such a way that \u03c6 holds\nin the \u201crubble\u201d.  In the other direction, one generally starts with\na model of ZFC+\u03c6 and then constructs an inner model (a model\nresembling L but able to accommodate large cardinal axioms) that\ncontains the large cardinal asserted to exist by \u03a6. The branch of\nset theory known as inner model theory is devoted to the\nconstruction of such \u201cL-like\u201d models for stronger and stronger\nlarge cardinal axioms.\n\n\nIn this way the theories of the form ZFC+LC, where LC is a large\ncardinal axiom, provide a yardstick for measuring the strength of\ntheories.  They also act as intermediaries for comparing theories\nfrom conceptually distinct domains: Given ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03c8\none finds large cardinal axioms \u03a6 and \u03a8 such that (using\nthe methods of inner and outer models) ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03a6 are\nmutually interpretable and ZFC+\u03c8 and ZFC+\u03a8 are mutually\ninterpretable.  One then compares ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03c8 (in terms\nof interpretability) by mediating through the natural interpretability\nrelationship between ZFC+\u03a6 and ZFC+\u03a8.  So large\ncardinal axioms (in conjunction with the dual method of inner and outer\nmodels) lie at the heart of the remarkable empirical fact that\nnatural theories from completely distinct domains can be compared in\nterms of interpretability.\n\n",
