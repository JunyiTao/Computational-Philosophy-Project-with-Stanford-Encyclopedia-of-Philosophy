    "main_text": "Realism and anti-realism || Realism and truth\n4.1 Realism and truth\n\nIn discussing the approach to correspondence of section 3.1, we noted\nthat it has few ontological requirements. It relies on there being\nobjects of reference, and something about the world which makes for\ndeterminate satisfaction relations; but beyond that, it is\nontologically neutral. But as we mentioned there, this is not to say\nthat it has no metaphysical implications. A correspondence theory of\ntruth, of any kind, is often taken to embody a form of\nrealism.\n\nThe key features of realism, as we will take it, are that:\n\nThe world exists objectively, independently of the ways we think\nabout it or describe it.\nOur thoughts and claims are about that world.\n\n\n(Wright (1992) offers a nice statement of this way of thinking about\nrealism.) These theses imply that our claims are objectively true or\nfalse, depending on how the world they are about is. The world that we\nrepresent in our thoughts or language is an objective world. (Realism\nmay be restricted to some subject-matter, or range of discourse, but\nfor simplicity, we will talk about only its global form.)\n\nIt is often argued that these theses require some form of the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. (Putnam (1978, p. 18) notes,\n\u201cWhatever else realists say, they typically say that they\nbelieve in a \u2018correspondence theory of truth\u2019.\u201d) At\nleast, they are supported by the kind of correspondence theory without\nfacts discussed in section 3.1, such as Field\u2019s proposal. Such a\ntheory will provide an account of objective relations of reference and\nsatisfaction, and show how these determine the truth or falsehood of\nwhat we say about the world. Field\u2019s own approach (1972) to this\nproblem seeks a physicalist explanation of reference. But realism is a\nmore general idea than physicalism. Any theory that provides objective\nrelations of reference and satisfaction, and builds up a theory of\ntruth from them, would give a form of realism. (Making the objectivity\nof reference the key to realism is characteristic of work of Putnam,\ne.g., 1978.)\n\nAnother important mark of realism expressed in terms of truth is the\nproperty of bivalence. As Dummett has stressed (e.g., 1959;\n1976; 1983; 1991), a realist should see there being a fact of the\nmatter one way or the other about whether any given claim is correct.\nHence, one important mark of realism is that it goes together with the\nprinciple of bivalence: every truth-bearer (sentence or\nproposition) is true or false. In much of his work, Dummett has made\nthis the characteristic mark of realism, and often identifies realism\nabout some subject-matter with accepting bivalence for discourse about\nthat subject-matter. At the very least, it captures a great deal of\nwhat is more loosely put in the statement of realism above.\n\nBoth the approaches to realism, through reference and through\nbivalence, make truth the primary vehicle for an account of realism. A\ntheory of truth which substantiates bivalence, or builds truth from a\ndeterminate reference relation, does most of the work of giving a\nrealistic metaphysics. It might even simply be a realistic\nmetaphysics.\n\nWe have thus turned on its head the relation of truth to metaphysics\nwe saw in our discussion of the neo-classical correspondence theory in\nsection 1.1. There, a correspondence theory of truth was built upon a\nsubstantial metaphysics. Here, we have seen how articulating a theory\nthat captures the idea of correspondence can be crucial to providing a\nrealist metaphysics. (For another perspective on realism and truth,\nsee Alston (1996). Devitt (1984) offers an opposing view to the kind\nwe have sketched here, which rejects any characterization of realism\nin terms of truth or other semantic concepts.)\n\nIn light of our discussion in section 1.1.1, we should pause to note\nthat the connection between realism and the correspondence theory of\ntruth is not absolute. When Moore and Russell held the identity theory\nof truth, they were most certainly realists. The right kind of\nmetaphysics of propositions can support a realist view, as can a\nmetaphysics of facts. The modern form of realism we have been\ndiscussing here seeks to avoid basing itself on such particular\nontological commitments, and so prefers to rely on the kind of\ncorrespondence-without-facts approach discussed in section 3.1. This\nis not to say that realism will be devoid of ontological commitments,\nbut the commitments will flow from whichever specific claims about\nsome subject-matter are taken to be true.\n\nFor more on realism and truth, see Fumerton (2002) and the entry on\n realism.\n",
