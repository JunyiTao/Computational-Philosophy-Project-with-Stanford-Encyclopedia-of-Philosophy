    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Duns Scotus (1265/66\u20131308) was one of the most important\nand influential philosopher-theologians of the High Middle Ages. His\nbrilliantly complex and nuanced thought, which earned him the nickname\n\u201cthe Subtle Doctor,\u201d left a mark on discussions of such\ndisparate topics as the semantics of religious language, the problem\nof universals, divine illumination, and the nature of human freedom.\nThis essay first lays out what is known about Scotus\u2019s life and\nthe dating of his works. It then offers an overview of some of his key\npositions in four main areas of philosophy: natural theology,\nmetaphysics, the theory of knowledge, and ethics and moral\npsychology.\n",
