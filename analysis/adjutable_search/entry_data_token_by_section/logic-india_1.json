    "main_text": "Preclassical Period\n2. Preclassical Period\n\nThe fact that humans reason is no guarantee that those who do reflect\non which reasoning is good and which is bad. Clearly, the activity of\nreasoning, on the one hand, and the activity of reflecting on which\nreasoning is good and which is not, on the other, are distinct, though\nnaturally they are intimately related. The exposition here, while\nreporting primarily on what is explicit, will also report on what is\nimplicit. In looking at the origins of reasoning in India, it is\nnatural to begin with the practices in which reasoning played a role\nand which, as a result, were likely candidates for reflection. The\nobvious starting points for such practices are all forms of rational\ninquiry.\n\nRational inquiry comprises the search for reasons for publicly\naccepted facts, subject to public and rational scrutiny. This activity\ninvolves people both severally and collectively. It involves people\nseverally insofar as people, individually, are the locus of inference.\nIt involves people collectively insofar as arguments, the public\nmanifestation of inferences, are sharpened by the scrutiny of\nothers.\n\nThough the origins in India of public debate, one form of rational\ninquiry, are not clear, we know that public verbal exchanges were\ncommon in preclassical India, starting around the fifth century bce,\nfor they are occasionally alluded to in various\nUpani\u1e63ads and frequently described at some length in\nthe Buddhist canon. As pointed out by Todeschini (2011, 92), these\nexchanges are not debates in the usual sense of the word, for they\ninclude everything from verbal instruction in the ideas of the Buddha\nto verbal sparring. The instruction may take the form of question and\nanswer, where the respondent is judged by how well he, or she,\nexpresses himself, or herself. An assessment depends on how persuasive\nthe answer is or how authoritative it sounds. Simile and analogy loom\nlarge. Rare are what we would call arguments. More than half of the\nsuttas of the D\u0131\u0304gha Nik\u0101ya contain such\nexchanges. These exchanges typically have the following features: a\ncentral character, typically the Buddha, a statement of his or her\ncredentials, an adversary, a statement of his or her credentials, a\ndescription of the location and audience, a greeting ceremony, a\nchallenge, a refutation of the adversary\u2019s position, the\nestablishment of the Buddhist position, a hypothetical case history, a\nsurrender and a reward (Mann\u00e9, 1992, 117). These exchanges\ncontain much, sometimes nearly the only surviving, information on the\nparticipants and the sects to which they belonged. (See Mann\u00e9,\n1992; von Hin\u00fcber, 1996, II.2.1; Solomon, 1976, 30\u201334;\nWatanabe, 1983; Todeschini, 2011, 79\u201389 for details.)\n\nPublic verbal exchanges also include public assemblies\n(pari\u1e63ad or sabh\u0101) of various sorts,\ncomprising relevant experts, convened to deliberate on a variety of\nmatters, including administrative, legal and religious matters. As\nreported by Solomon (1976, ch. 3), much of the legal vocabulary for\nsuch deliberations includes the well-known terms of debate and\nargument found in the philosophical literature (see also Preisendanz\n2009, 2010).\n\nAlso during this period, rational inquiry into a wide range of topics\nwas under way, including agriculture, architecture, astronomy,\ngrammar, law, logic, mathematics, medicine, phonology and statecraft.\nAside from the world\u2019s earliest extant grammar,\nP\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s\nA\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, however, no works\ndevoted to these topics actually date from this preclassical period.\nNonetheless, scholars agree that incipient versions of the first\nextant texts on these topics were being formulated and early versions\nof them were redacted by the beginning of the common era. They include\nsuch texts as K\u1e5b\u1e63i-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise\non agriculture), \u015ailpa-\u015b\u0101stra\n(Treatise on architecture),\nJyoti\u1e63a-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise on\nastronomy), Dharma-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise on\nlaw), Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 (Caraka\u2019s\ncollection), a treatise on medicine, and\nArtha-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise on wealth), a\ntreatise on politics.\n\nThree late canonical Buddhist texts are especially noteworthy for the\nstudy of the history of reasoning in India. They are\nKath\u0101-vatthu (Points of controversy), attributed to\nMoggaliputta Tissa, Yamaka (Couplets) and\nMilinda-pa\u00f1ha (Questions of King Milinda).\nWhile all three are from the Therav\u0101da (or Sthavirav\u0101da)\ntradition, only the first two are canonical texts of the tradition,\nboth found in the Abhidhamma canon. The three date from around the\nthird century bce.\n",
