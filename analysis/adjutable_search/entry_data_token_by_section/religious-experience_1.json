    "main_text": "Language and Experience\n2. Language and Experience\n\nMany have thought that there is some special problem with religious\nlanguage, that it can\u2019t be meaningful in the same way that\nordinary language is. The Logical Positivists claimed that language is\nmeaningful only insofar as it is moored in our experiences of the\nphysical world. Since we can\u2019t account for religious language by\nlinking it to experiences of the physical world, such language is\nmeaningless. Even though religious claims look in every way like\nordinary assertions about the world, their lack of empirical\nconsequences makes them meaningless. Ayer (1952) calls such language\n\u201cmetaphysical,\u201d and therefore meaningless. He says, \u201cThat a\ntranscendent god exists 3s a metaphysical assertion, and therefore not\nliterally significant.\u201d The principle of verification went through\nmany formulations as it faced criticism. But if it is understood as a\nclaim about meaning in ordinary language, it seems to be\nself-undermining, since there is no empirical way to verify it.\nEventually, that approach to language fell out of favor, but some\nstill use a modified, weaker version to criticize religious language.\nFor example, Antony Flew (Flew and MacIntyre, 1955) relies on a\nprinciple to the effect that if a claim is not falsifiable, it is\nsomehow illegitimate. Martin (1990) and Nielsen (1985) invoke a\nprinciple that combines verifiability and falsifiability; to be\nmeaningful, a claim must be one or the other. It is not clear that\neven these modified and weakened versions of the verification principle\nentirely escape self-undermining. Even if they do, they seem to take\nother kinds of language with them\u2014like moral language, talk\nabout the future or past, and talk about the contents of others\u2019\nminds \u2014 that we might be loath to lose. Moreover, to deny the\nmeaningfulness of religious-experience claims on the grounds that it\nis not moored in experience begs the question, in that it assumes that\nreligious experiences are not real experiences.\n\nAnother possibility is to allow that religious claims are meaningful,\nbut they are not true or false, because they should not be understood\nas assertions. Braithwaite (1970), for example, understands religious\nclaims to be expressions of commitments to sets of values. On such a\nview, what appears to be a claim about a religious experience is not\nin fact a claim at all. It might be that some set of mental events,\nwith which the experience itself can be identified, would be the\nground and prompting of the claim, but it would not properly be what\nthe claim is about.\n\nA second challenge to religious-experience claims comes from\nWittgensteinian accounts of language. Wittgenstein (1978) muses at\nsome length on the differences between how ordinary language is used,\nand how religious language is used. Others (see Phillips 1970, for\nexample), following Wittgenstein, have tried to give an explanation of\nthe strangeness of religious language by invoking the idea of a\nlanguage-game. Each language-game has its own rules, including its own\nprocedures for verification. As a result, it is a mistake to treat it\nlike ordinary language, expecting evidence in the ordinary sense, in\nthe same way that it would be a mistake to ask for the evidence for a\njoke. \u201cI saw God\u201d should not be treated in the same way as\n\u201cI saw Elvis.\u201d Some even go so far as to say the religious\nlanguage-game is isolated from other practices, such that it would be\na mistake to derive any claims about history, geography, or cosmology\nfrom them, never mind demand the same kind of evidence for them. On\nthis view, religious experiences should not be treated as comparable\nto sense experiences, but that does not entail that they are not\nimportant, nor that they are not in some sense veridical, in that they\ncould still be avenues for important insights about reality. Such a\nview can be attributed to D. Z. Phillips (1970).\n\nWhile this may account for some of the unusual aspects of religious\nlanguage, it certainly does not capture what many religious people\nthink about the claims they make. As creationism illustrates, many\nreligious folk think it is perfectly permissible to draw empirical\nconclusions from religious doctrine. Hindus and Buddhists for many\ncenturies thought there was a literal Mount Meru in the middle of the\n(flat, disc-shaped) world. It would be very odd if \u201cThe Buddha\nattained enlightenment under the bo tree\u201d had to be given a very\ndifferent treatment from \u201cThe Buddha ate rice under the bo\ntree\u201d because the first is a religious claim and the second is\nan ordinary empirical claim. There are certainly entailment relations\nbetween religious and non-religious claims, too: \u201cJesus died for\nmy sins\u201d straightforwardly entails \u201cJesus died.\u201d\n",
