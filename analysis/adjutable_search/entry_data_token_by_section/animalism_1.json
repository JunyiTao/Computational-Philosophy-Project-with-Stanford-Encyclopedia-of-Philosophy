    "main_text": "Formulating Animalism || Our Fundamental Nature\n1.1 Our Fundamental Nature\n\nAnimalism\u2019s hallmark claim concerns our basic metaphysical\nnature: whether we are material or immaterial; simple or composite;\nsubstance, property, process, or event; organic or inorganic; etc. In\nthis context, the animalist asserts simply:\n\n(1\u2032)\nWe are animals.\n\n\nDespite its plainness, (1\u2032) is easily misinterpreted (for\ndiscussion, see D. Mackie 1999b: 230\u201333; Olson 2003:\n318\u201321; and Snowdon 2014: ch. 1). According to the intended\nreading, the \u2018we\u2019 picks out human persons such as you and\nme. Nevertheless, (1\u2032) should not be taken to assert that\nall persons are animals. It leaves open the possibilities of\nboth non-animal people (e.g., robots, angels, aliens, deities) and\nhuman animals that are not people (e.g., patients in persistent\nvegetative states, human fetuses). The \u2018are\u2019 reflects the\n\u2018is\u2019 of numerical identity. Consequently, animalism is not\nthe view that each of us is \u201cconstituted by\u201d a particular\norganism, in the way that a statue is sometimes said to be\nnon-identically constituted by the hunk of matter with which it\ncoincides (see\n section 2.3).\n Nor still should (1\u2032) be understood to claim that each of us\nhas a body that is an animal\u2014as if you were one thing\nand your animal body another. Finally, \u2018animals\u2019 refers to\nbiological organisms\u2014members of the primate species Homo\nsapiens. While participants on both sides of the debate over\nanimalism tend to treat these terms interchangeably, some prominent\ncritics distinguish \u2018animals\u2019 from \u2018organisms\u2019\nand deny that these terms co-refer (e.g., Johnston 2007: 55\u201356,\nS. Shoemaker 2011: 353).\n\nExpressed in logical notation and individualized, (1\u2032) is\nsometimes presented in the following form:\n\n(1\u2033)\n\\(\\Box (\\forall x) (x \\text{ is a human person} \\rightarrow \n\t\tx \\text{ is an animal})\\).\n\n\nThis says: necessarily, for any object x, if x is a\nhuman person, then x is an animal, i.e., necessarily, human\npersons are animals. While neither (1\u2032) nor (1\u2033) is\nunproblematic (see, e.g., Johansson 2007 and Toner 2011), it is clear\nenough what they do not suggest. According to the animalism\naccount of our most fundamental nature, we are not\n\n immaterial souls or egos (Descartes; Foster 1991);\n material bodies (Thomson 1997; Williams 1957);\n body-soul complexes (Swinburne 1984);\n bundles of mental states (Hume; Rovane 1998; S. Campbell\n2006);\n material simples (Chisholm 1978 [1989]; Lowe 1996, 2001);\n parts of brains (Puccetti 1973; McMahan 2002);\n persons materially constituted by, but nonidentical with, animals\n(S. Shoemaker 1999; Baker 2000; Johnston 2007); or\n nothing at all (Unger 1979a,b; cf. Unger 1990).\n\n\nHaving said that, this entry will focus primarily on animalism\u2019s\npositive assertions, rather than on animalist criticisms of each of\nits rival views. The interested reader is directed to Olson 2007 and\nSnowdon 2014, which not only include qualified defenses of (1), but\nalso raise a host of criticisms of the foregoing\nalternatives\u2014criticisms that, if not motivated by an acceptance\nof (1), are at least consistent with its truth.\n\nIt bears mention that animalism is sometimes formulated slightly\ndifferently as:\n\n(1\u2034)\nWe are essentially animals.\n\n\nOn this construal, animalism is the view that we could not exist\nexcept as animals. Indeed, some have alleged that a commitment to\n(1\u2032) is insufficient to qualify anyone as an animalist and that\nthis label should be reserved only for those committed to\nboth (1\u2032) and (1\u2034) (Belshaw 2011: 401; cf. Olson\n2007: 26\u201327, Snowdon 1990). Insistence on this point is probably\ninnocuous, however, since most philosophers accept that all animals\n(human and otherwise) are essentially animals, in which case,\n(1\u2034) follows immediately from (1\u2032).\n\n(1)\nUnless otherwise noted, in what follows, \u2018(1)\u2019 will \n\tbe treated as referring equivocally to (1\u2032), (1\u2033), and \n\t(on the assumption that all animals are essentially animals) \n\t(1\u2034).\n\n",
