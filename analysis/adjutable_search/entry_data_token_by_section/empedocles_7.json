    "main_text": "Purifications || Transmigration\n3.1 Transmigration\n\nTransmigration is central to the philosophical program of the\nPurifications. The doctrine already had adherents in the\nfollowers of Orphism and among the Pythagoreans, and Empedocles no\ndoubt drew upon this prominent south Italian and Sicilian tradition in\nadvocating for his own cycle of incarnations (Kingsley 1995, Palmer\n2019). One part of the cycle begins under the total domination of Love\nthrough the Sphere, with Strife exiled from the four roots. After\nthese have become blended, Strife \u201cleaps\u201d into action,\nbecoming the motivator of the pollution by those gods who perjure a\nsacred decree governed by Necessity. This triggers a chain reaction of\nbanishment and wandering for the newly fallen daemons in a fragment\ntraditionally taken as part of the Purifications\n(O\u2019Brien 2001):\n\n\n\nThere is an oracle of Necessity, an ancient decree of the gods, \n\nEternal, sealed by broad oaths: \n\nWhenever by crimes some one [scil. of them] pollutes his limbs, by\nmurder \n\n<\u2026> whoever commits a fault by perjuring himself on oath,\n\n\nThe divinities (daimones) who have received as lot a long\nlife, \n\nMust wander thrice ten thousand seasons far from the blessed ones, \n\nGrowing during this time in the different forms of mortal beings, \n\nExchanging the painful paths of life. \n\nFor the force of the aether chases them toward the sea, \n\nThe sea spits them out toward earth\u2019s surface, the earth toward\nthe rays \n\nOf the bright sun, and he [i.e., the sun] hurls them into the eddies\nof the aether. \n\nEach one receives them from another, but all hate them. \n\nOf them, I too am now one, an exile from the divine and a wanderer, \n\nI who relied on insane Strife. (B 115 = D 10)\n\n\nThe daemon\u2019s fate reworks a passage from Hesiod\u2019s\nTheogony (775\u2013806) that recounts the prerogatives of\nthe goddess Styx, who, after strife and quarrels have emerged,\npunishes the gods\u2019 perjury with an exile of nine years. Yet, as\nin On Nature, the four roots are crucial\u2014air, water,\nearth, and fire play a key role in the cycle of incarnation,\nsuccessively expelling the daemon from their spheres of influence.\nDetails on the beginning of the cycle remain frustratingly unclear. At\nwhat stage in the rising influence of Strife the gods pollute\nthemselves is ambiguous, as are the precise conditions under which the\ngods become daemons. As in epic and tragedy, there may be \u201cdual\nmotivation\u201d: Strife provokes transmigration, but the daemon\nremains accountable for its crimes.\n\nPunishment arises through exile from the gods and a long wandering;\nthe daemon is hated by all and reliant on Strife. Neither Zeus nor\nHades will receive it (B 142 = D 12). The fate of mortals in general\nis grim:\n\n\n\nAlas! Wretched race of mortals, miserable race! \n\nFrom such kinds of strife and from such groans you are born! (B 124 =\nD 17)\n\n\nThe persona loquens laments, \u201cI wept and wailed when I\nsaw an unaccustomed place\u201d (B118 = D 14), and finds himself,\n\u201cFar from what honor and from what abundance of\nbliss\u201d\u2026 (B 119 = D 15). Transmigration as part of the\nritual of purification mandates partaking in a world of suffering in\nwhich all life is fated to be born, become corrupt, and die. This\nreasserts the doctrine in On Nature that all things are\nmortal except for the four roots and Love and Strife, which combine\nand break down matter. Empedocles narrates his own dissolutions and\nrecombination, \n\n\n\nFor as for me, once I was already both a youth and a girl \n\na bush and a bird, and a sea-leaping, voyaging fish. (B 117 = D 13)\n\n\n\nThe wandering of the daemon forms a \u201cladder\u201d of\ntransmigration, in a cycle ascending from animal to plant to human.\nThis hierarchy of incarnation is further subdivided, with laurel at\nthe highest plant rung; lions at the highest animal one; and seers,\npoets, doctors, and leaders of men for humans (B 127, 146 = D 36, 39).\nTheoretically, the cycle applies to all living creatures. This\nconsideration necessitates the injunction against bloodshed and\nmeat-eating:\n\n\n\nWill you not desist from evil-sounding murder? Do you not see \n\nThat you are devouring each other in the carelessness of your mind? (B\n136 = D 28)\n\n\nHumans unaware of the cycle of transmigration commit murder by eating\nflesh. The verb in Greek for \u201cdevouring\u201d\n(\u03b4\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) is used of\nwild animals, highlighting the dehumanizing effect of being\ncarnivorous. The legal language of the gods\u2019 oath returns in the\nhuman sphere, where all humans are bound by the injunction against\nkilling (B 135 = D 27a). The hexameter verse form is used to\nspectacular effect in Empedocles\u2019 equation of ritual animal\nsacrifice to human sacrifice familiar from Agamemnon\u2019s slaughter\nof Iphigenia:\n\n\n\nThe father, lifting up his own son who has changed shape, \n\nCuts his throat, with a prayer\u2014fool that he is! The others are\nat a loss \n\nWhile they sacrifice the suppliant; but he [scil. the father], deaf to\nthe shouts, \n\nHas cut the throat and prepared an evil meal in his house. \n\nIn the same way, a son seizes his father and children their mother, \n\nAnd ripping out their life they devour the flesh of their dear ones.\n(B 137 = D 29)\n\n\nThe gnomic wisdom that \u201cnot to be born is best\u201d is\nmodified by Empedocles in light of his prior transgressions: \n\n\n\nAlas, that the pitiless day did not destroy me earlier, \n\nBefore I contrived terrible deeds of feeding around my lips. (B 139 =\nD 34) \n\n\nThis fragment finds an almost exact parallel in On Nature,\nagain pointing to the fundamental unity of what have been perceived as\nphysical and ritual doctrines. Vegetarianism becomes an antidote to\nthe cannibalism inherent in meat-eating, and the extant fragments show\nsimilar injunctions against bay leaves (B 140 = D 32) and beans (B 141\n= D 31).\n\nAt an earlier stage in the cycle with Love more powerful, humans\nenjoyed a kind of Golden Age of prosperity and peace. Under her\ninfluence, humans and animals are harmonious: beasts and birds become\ntame and gentle (B 130 = D 26). For these humans, the worship of Love\nrejects blood sacrifice for honey, myrrh, perfume, and votives (B 128\n= D 25). Early human history thus models the ethical norms that must\nbe recovered in Empedocles\u2019 modernity in order to become pure\nand advance in the cycle of incarnations. The focus upon ethics in the\nPurifications is a radical shift from prior Presocratic\ndiscourse (Barnes 1979). Abstaining from meat, bay, beans, and\nheterosexual congress may place the cycle in the realm of human\nmanipulation, and the Purifications thus has a didactic\nmessage with the potential to accelerate the daemon\u2019s path from\nhuman to divine being. More speculatively, it has been suggested that\nthe motion of the cycle itself can be changed on the basis of human\naction (Osborne 2005), though this has not gone unchallenged (Picot\n& Berg 2015). \n",
