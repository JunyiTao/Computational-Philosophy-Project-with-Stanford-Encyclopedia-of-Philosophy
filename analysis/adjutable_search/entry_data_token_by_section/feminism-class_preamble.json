    "main_text": "\n\nA good place to situate the start of theoretical debates about women,\nclass and work is in the intersection with Marxism and feminism. Such\ndebates were shaped not only by academic inquiries but as questions\nabout the relation between women\u2019s oppression and liberation and\nthe class politics of the left, trade union and feminist movements in\nthe late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly\nin the U.S., Britain and Europe. It will also be necessary to consider\nvarious philosophical approaches to the concept of work, the way that\nwomen\u2019s work and household activities are subsumed or not under\nthis category, how the specific features of this work may or may not\nconnect to different \u201cways of knowing\u201d and different\napproaches to ethics, and the debate between essentialist and social\nconstructionist approaches to differences between the sexes as a base\nfor the sexual division of labor in most known human societies.\n\nThe relation of women as a social group to the analysis of economic\nclass has spurred political debates within both Marxist and feminist\ncircles as to whether women\u2019s movements challenging male\ndomination can assume a common set of women\u2019s interests across\nrace, ethnicity, and class. If there are no such interests, on what\ncan a viable women\u2019s movement be based, and how can it evade\npromoting primarily the interests of white middle class and wealthy\nwomen? To the extent to which women do organize themselves as a\npolitical group cutting across traditional class lines, under what\nconditions are they a conservative influence as opposed to a\nprogressive force for social change? If poor and working class\nwomen\u2019s issues are different than middle and upper class\nwomen\u2019s issues, how can middle class women\u2019s movements be\ntrusted to address them? In addition to these questions, there is a\nset of issues related to cross-cultural comparative studies of women,\nwork and relative power in different societies, as well as analyses of\nhow women\u2019s work is connected to processes of globalization.\n\nConsiderable research in the past 30 years has been devoted to women\nand work in the context of shifting divisions of labor globally\n(Ehrenreich and Hochschild 2004). Some of this feminist work proceeds\nfrom the development perspectives promoted by the UN and other policy\nmaking institutions (Chen et al. 2005), while other research\ntakes a more critical view (Beneria 2003; Pyle and Ward 2007). Many\nstudies address changes in the gender division of labor within\nspecific national economies (Freeman 1999; George 2005; Rofel;\nSangster 1995) while others consider the impact of transnational\nmigration on women\u2019s class position (Pratt 2004; Romero 1992;\nStephen 2007; Keogh 2015) and women\u2019s opportunities for\ncross-class solidarity and grassroots-based organizing (Mohanty 2003).\nMore recent feminist research has addressed the restructuring of work\nand its impact on women and gender culture as an effect of neo-liberal\neconomic adjustments (Adkins 2002; Enloe 2004; Federici 2008 [Other\nInternet Resources]; McRobbie 2002; Skeggs 2003).\n",
