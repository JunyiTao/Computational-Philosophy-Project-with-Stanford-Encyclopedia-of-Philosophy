    "main_text": "The Philosophical History of Hope || Hope in 17th and 18th Century Philosophy\n2.3 Hope in 17th and 18th Century Philosophy\n\nIn 17th and 18th century philosophy, many\nphilosophers reject Aquinas\u2019 division between different kinds of\npassions in favor of a moral psychology which classifies emotions and\ndesires together as passions that generate action, of which hope is\nusually conceived as a species. Almost all authors mentioned in the\nfollowing also embrace some version of the idea defining for the\n\u201cstandard account\u201d that hope is based on uncertainty in\nbelief together with a representation of an object as desirable\n(Bl\u00f6ser 2020a).\n\nAccording to Descartes, hope is a weaker form of confidence\n(Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985: 389) and consists in a\ndesire (a representation of an outcome to be both good for us and\npossible) together with a disposition to think of it as likely but not\ncertain (Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985: 350f, 389). This\nmeans that hope and anxiety always accompany each other (in contrast\nto both despair and confidence which are absolute opposites). Hobbes\nadopts a similar analysis. For him, hope is a complex passion or a\n\u201cpleasure of the mind\u201d, i.e., a pleasure that arises not\nfrom direct sensation but from thinking. For Hobbes, the simplest\nbuilding block underlying hope is appetite, and \u201cappetite with\nan opinion of obtaining\u201d is hope (Leviathan, 36,\nI.VI.14). As in Descartes, hope serves as a building block for more\ncomplex mental phenomena, such as courage or confidence\n(Leviathan, 36f, I.VI.17/19). But hope also plays a role in\nthe mental activity of deliberation which is defined as the\nalternation of hope and fear with appetites and aversion\n(Leviathan, 39, I.VI.49; see also Bobier 2020b). Hope\u2014a\nterm which Hobbes often uses more or less synonymously with\n(justified) expectation\u2014plays an important role in the political\napplication of his moral psychology: Not only is the equality in the\nstate of nature defined as an equality of hope (Leviathan,\n83, I.XIII.3)\u2014which makes it rational for everyone to pursue\ntheir individual advantage\u2014the laws of nature also command one\nto seek peace where one has hope for obtaining it (Leviathan,\n87, I.XIV.4). Both the collective agency problem in the state of\nnature and the solution to it thus depend on what hopes individuals\ncan rationally entertain.\n\nSpinoza also defines the passion of hope as a form of pleasure\n(Ethics III, P18, Spinoza [1677] 1985: 505) or joy that is\nmingled with sadness (due to the uncertainty of the outcome, see\nShort Treatise, book II, ch. IX, Spinoza [c. 1660] 1985:\n113). In contrast to more modern definitions, Spinoza distinguishes\nthe pleasure that is involved in hope from desire. Hope (in the\nEthics) is thus not necessarily connected to desire, but\nrather a way in which the mind is affected by the idea of a future\nevent. In contrast to Hobbes and Descartes, Spinoza understands hope\nas fundamentally irrational. He argues that it must be the result of\nfalse belief inasmuch as it does not correctly represent that\neverything is governed by necessity (Short Treatise, book II,\nch. IX, [c. 1660] 1985: 113). Additionally, in the Ethics,\nSpinoza describes hope as one of the causes of superstition,\nespecially as it is always accompanied by fear (Ethics III,\nP50, [1677] 1985: 521). Such fear necessarily precludes it from being\nintrinsically good (Ethics IV, P47, [1677] 1985: 573). This\nis also the reason why we should attempt to make ourselves independent\nfrom hope (although Gatens et al. (2021: 202) argue that Spinoza also\nhas room for the idea of reasonable hopes).\n\nSpinoza agrees with Hobbes, however, by ascribing political\nsignificance to hope. As he explains in the Theological-Political\nTreatise, the fact that people are governed by hope and fear makes\nthem easy victims of superstition and false belief\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 389); however,\ngood laws can also take advantage of this and motivate people by\narranging outcomes such that they can be motivated by hope\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 439; see Gatens\net al. 2021 for a discussion of the political significance of hope in\nSpinoza). The same importance he places on hope also underlies his\nsocial contract argument. Like Hobbes, he argues that the only reason\nwhy people remain faithful to the social contract or carry out the orders\nof a sovereign has to be found in their hope of obtaining a certain\ngood this way (Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002:\n529). Even a people as a whole is always united by common hopes and\nfears (Political Treatise, [1675] 2002: 700), but hope rather\nthan fear is dominant in the case of free peoples (ibid.).\nThis leads Spinoza to proclaim hope and fear as the basis of political\npower in the Political Treatise ([1675] 2002: 686).\n\nHume\u2019s account is another example of an analysis of hope as a\npassion\u2014modified, however, by the specific approach he takes to\nhuman psychology. For Hume, hope is a \u201cdirect passion\u201d\nthat is produced when the mind considers events that have a\nprobability between absolute certainty and absolute impossibility.\nHume describes probability-beliefs as an effect of the mind\nentertaining contrary views\u2014of an event or object as either\nexistent or non-existent\u2014in quick succession after another. Each\nof these views gives rise to either joy or sorrow (when the object is\nsomething good or bad) which linger longer in the mind than the\noriginal imagination of the object\u2019s existence or non-existence.\nWhen considering objects that are probable, but not certain, the mind\nis thus affected by a mixture of joy and sorrow that, depending on the\npredominant element, can be called hope or fear.\n\n\nIt is after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different\nmixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their\nimperfect union and conjunction. (Treatise, [1738] 2007:\n283)\n\n\nAs Hume sees hope as a necessary effect of the consideration of an\nuncertain event, it follows that we cannot but hope for any positive\noutcome about which we are uncertain. The uncertainty in question can\nbe based on the actual uncertainty of the event but also on uncertain\nbelief.\n",
