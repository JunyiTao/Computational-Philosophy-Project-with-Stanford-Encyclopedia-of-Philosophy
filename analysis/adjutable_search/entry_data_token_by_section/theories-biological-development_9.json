    "main_text": "Regulative Theories of Development || Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion model\n8.2 Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion model\n\nEschewing genetics, Turing\u2019s theory of morphogenesis (1952)\nsought to explain how patterns first emerge in an early embryo. His\nanswer was a simple model consisting of two reaction-diffusion\nequations, representing chemical \u201cmorphogens\u201d X\nand Y diffusing through a tissue\nat rates determined by constants \\(D_x\\) and \\(D_y,\\) coupled to\nchemical reactions with effects represented by functions f\nand g: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} X_t &= f(X,Y) + D_x\\nabla^2X \\\\ Y_t &= g(X,Y) + D_y\\nabla^2Y \\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(These equations follow Keller\u2019s 2002 presentation, which is\nmore streamlined than Turing\u2019s original.) One morphogen is an\nactivator, the other an inhibitor. Both are made and destroyed at\nconstant rates. Initially, the tissue is homogeneous, lacking any\nspatial organization. Crucially, for stable patterns to emerge\nX and Y must diffuse at different rates, the\ninhibitor having the larger diffusion coefficient. Under these\nparameter values, random fluctuations in the system lead to\ninstability resulting in pattern-formation. That is, from an initially\nstable, homogeneous system of cells/tissue, interaction between two\ndiffusing chemicals (morphogens) leads to emergence of a stable\nchemical pattern. Turing assumes that steady-state chemical patterns\ndetermine patterns at the cell/tissue level (through mechanisms wholly\nunspecified). Given that assumption, the model accounts for pattern\nformation in a group of cells or a tissue.\n\nTuring\u2019s model of morphogenesis has several striking features.\nFirst, it is based on physics and chemistry rather than biology:\nreaction-diffusion equations incorporating Fourier series and the law\nof mass action. Reaction-diffusion equations are a class of non-linear\npartial differential equations. (Hodgkin and Huxley\u2019s model of\nneural propagation is also of this class\u2014at the time, one of the\nfew applications of these equations to biology; see the entry on\n mechanisms in science.)\n Turing\u2019s use of these equations to model the transition from\nhomogeneity to spatial patterning is rather counterintuitive, as\ndiffusion is a characteristically homogenizing process. So his model\nwas a theoretical advance, extending the insight that\nreaction-diffusion equations can model transitions and \u201cwaves of\nadvance\u201d (e.g., in neurons) to morphogenesis (Berestycki 2013).\nSecond, the model is strikingly abstract\u2014\u201c\u2026a\nsimplification and an idealization, and consequently a\nfalsification\u201d (Turing 1952: 37). Yet it has many biological\napplications. Turing (1952) explored mainly simple cases of chemical\ndiffusion through a tissue of fixed size. But he also applied the\nmodel to chemical waves on spheres to represent gastrulation. That\nmore complex case, with three interacting morphogens, can produce\ntraveling waves and out-of-phase oscillations. Turing also applied his\nmodel to plant development, specifically phyllotaxis (arrangement of\nleaves on a stem; see S. B. Cooper & van Leeuwen 2013). Subsequent\ngeneralizations of Turing\u2019s equations have been used to model a\nwide variety of developmental phenomena, including fish pigmentation\npatterns, human mesenchymal cell differentiation, butterfly wing\npatterns, mouse hair follicles/coat color patterns, limb and tooth\ndevelopment, and bacterial colony growth dynamics (Meinhardt 1982,\nMurray 1989). However, its explanatory role is controversial,\nprimarily because it is hard to show that Turing\u2019s model\ndescribes how development actually proceeds in real organisms.\n\nKeller (2002) discusses this issue, as well as major features of\nTuring\u2019s model. One key problem (noted by Waddington at the\ntime) is that \u201cpure homogeneity\u201d as a starting point for\ndevelopment is unrealistic; the egg or early embryo is never a\n\u201cblank slate\u201d as Turing assumed. She argues that\nTuring\u2019s was a premature attempt at mathematical biology, noting\nas well the challenge it posed to prevalent ideas about causality:\norganismal form as emergent, self-organizing; holistic, arising from\nthe system rather than driven by genes. Vecchi and Hern\u00e1ndez\n(2014) build on Keller\u2019s view, diagnosing \u201ca clash of\ncausal ideologies\u201d in the different possible interpretations of\ninitiating cause in Turing\u2019s model. They are more optimistic\nabout its biological relevance and influence. Scientists continue to\napply and reflect on Turing\u2019s model of morphogenesis (e.g.,\nKondo & Miura 2010). As the latter scholars note, Francis\nCrick\u2019s source-sink model of embryonic development (1970) can be\nconsidered the simplest form of a reaction-diffusion model, with the\nreaction term removed. However, Crick\u2019s model is mechanistically\nsimpler, with morphogenesis controlled by a single morphogen diffusing\nalong a line of cells:\n\n\nAt one end of a line of cells one postulates a source\u2014a cell\nthat produces a chemical (which I shall call a morphogen) and\nmaintains it at a constant level. At the other end the extreme cell\nacts as a sink: that is, it destroys the molecule, holding the\nconcentration at that point to a fixed low level. The morphogen can\ndiffuse from one cell to another along a line of cells. (Crick 1970:\n420)\n\n\nUnlike Turing\u2019s more holistic model, in which patterns emerge\nfrom initial random instability due to interaction of multiple\nmorphogens, Crick\u2019s model grounds morphogenesis in simple\nchemical diffusion. Agutter, Malone, and Wheatley (2000) and Vecchi\nand Hern\u00e1ndez (2014) argue that Crick\u2019s model lacks\nexplanatory power. However, Minelli (2009) suggests an updated\nsource-sink model, informed by advances in molecular and cell\nbiology.\n",
