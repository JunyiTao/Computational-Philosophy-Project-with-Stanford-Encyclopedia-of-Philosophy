    "main_text": "Relational Equality\n4. Relational Equality\n\n\nThe discussion so far presupposes that an egalitarian holds that in\nsome respect people should get the same or be accorded the same\ntreatment. There are other possibilities. One is the idea that in an\negalitarian society people should relate to one another as equals or\nshould enjoy the same fundamental status (and also perhaps the same\nrank and power).\n\n\nRelational equality ideals are often coupled with the ideal of equal\ndemocratic citizenship. On this view, in an egalitarian society, all\npermanent adult members of society are equal citizens, equal in\npolitical rights and duties, including the right to an equal vote in\ndemocratic elections that determine who shall be top public officials\nand lawmakers responsible for enacting laws and public policies\nenforced on all. An ideal of social equality complements political\nequality norms. The idea is that citizens might be unequal in wealth,\nresources, welfare, and other dimensions of their condition, yet be\nequal in status in a way that enables all to relate as equals. On this\napproach, an egalitarian society contrasts sharply with a society of\ncaste or class hierarchy, in which the public culture singles out some\nas inferior and some as superior, and contrasts also with a society\nwith a dictatorial or authoritarian political system, accompanied by\nsocially required kowtowing of ordinary members of society toward\npolitical elites.\n\n\nFrom the standpoint of the relational equality versions of\negalitarianism, equality of condition doctrines get the moral\npriorities backward. These doctrines make a fetish of what should not\nmatter to us, or should not matter very much. A better approach is to\nlook at distributive justice issues by asking what social and\ndistributive arrangements are needed to establish and sustain a society\nof free, equal people, a society in which individuals all relate as\nequals. When the question is posed in this way, relational equality\nadvocates sometimes claim to discern a new strong case for embracing a\nsufficientarian approach to distributive justice. That some people have\nmore money than others is not an impediment to a society of equals, the\nargument goes. But if some are so poor they are effectively excluded\nfrom market society or pushed to its margins, they are in effect\nbranded as socially inferior, which offends against relational\nequality. Some philosophers argue for some restriction on the size of\nthe gap between richest and poorest that society tolerates, again as\nwhat is needed to sustain a society of equals. Others might see the\ndifference principle as required for the same purpose. Some also pleas\nfor institutional insulation of the political and some social spheres\nso as to protect these as realms of equality from the corrosive\ninfluence of economic inequality (Walzer 1983 and Rawls 2005, Lecture\nVIII).\n\n\nThe ideal of a just modern society as a democratic society in which\ncitizens relate as equals appears in writings by Michael Walzer on\nsocial justice (Walzer, 1983). Elizabeth Anderson and Samuel Scheffler\nboth affirm versions of relational equality and from this standpoint\ncriticize the family of views that Anderson calls \u201cluck\negalitarian,\u201d whose foremost exponents are perhaps G. A. Cohen\nand Ronald Dworkin (Cohen 1989, Anderson 1999, Scheffler 2010, chapters\n7 and 8, Dworkin 2000, and for responses to criticisms, Dworkin\n2003 and 2010 and Arneson 2004). According to Anderson, the luck\negalitarian holds that unchosen and uncourted inequalities ought to be\neliminated and that chosen and courted inequalities should be left\nstanding). She criticizes these views on several grounds. One is that\nthe luck egalitarian wrongly takes the aim of egalitarian justice to be\nachieving an equal distribution of stuff rather than egalitarian\nsolidarity and respect among members of society. Another is that the\npolicy recommendations implied by luck egalitarian principles are too\nharsh in their dealings with people who fare badly but are deemed\npersonally responsible for their plight (see also Fleurbaey 1995). A\nthird is that the luck egalitarian, in order to establish that people\nwho are badly off are owed equalizing compensation, must involve\ndistributive agencies in intrusive and disrespectful inquiries that\nissue in public negative assessments of people's traits as\ngrounding the conclusion that these unfortunate individuals are not\nproperly held personally responsible for their misfortune (see also\nWolff 1998). A related criticism is that luck egalitarianism adopts a\nmoralizing posture toward individual wayward choice that would make\nsense only if free will libertarianism were correct (Scheffler\n2010).\n\n\nA further criticism is that the luck egalitarian supposes that if we\naim to undo unchosen luck, this aim somehow provides an underlying\njustification for some form of equal distribution (Hurley 2003). It is\nnot clear that undoing the influence of unchosen luck has anything to\ndo with promoting equal distribution: consider that sometimes via\nunchosen luck people end up equally well off. A better strategy is for\nthe luck egalitarian to start with the intuitive idea that distribution\nshould be equal and then allow that this presumption for equality can\nbe taken away when people could sustain equal distribution and instead\nend up unequally well off via individual choices. Equality is deemed\nmorally valuable on the condition that inequality does not emerge from\nchoices for which people are reasonably held responsible.\n\n\nAnother criticism of luck egalitarianism, pressed by Scheffler and\nespecially Anderson, is that the doctrine engenders an inappropriate\nexpansion of what is deemed to be the legitimate business of the state.\nSuppose we distinguish roughly between misfortune that is imposed on\npeople by social action and social arrangements and misfortune that\njust falls on people without being imposed by anyone. The distinction\ndraws a line between inequality due to society and inequality due to\nnature. In the words of Anderson, \u201cthe proper negative aim of\negalitarian justice is not to eliminate the impact of brute luck from\nhuman affairs, but to end oppression, which by definition is socially\nimposed\u201d (Anderson 1999).\n\n\nRelational equality ideals might be regarded either as required by\njustice or as not required by justice or other morally mandatory\nprinciples, rather as morally optional. Or a component of social\nequality might count as a justice requirement while another component\nis treated as a part of a broader social ideal that is desirable but\nnot mandatory.\n\n\nThe idea of relating as equals can be construed in different ways.\nSamuel Scheffler suggests one specification when he writes that\n\u201cwe believe that there is something valuable about human\nrelationships that are, in certain crucial respects at least,\nunstructured by differences of rank, power, or status\u201d (Scheffler\n2010, 225). The idea is that equality of rank, power, and status is\nboth instrumentally valuable and valuable for its own sake. He\nimmediately notes that such differences are ubiquitous in the social\nlife of modern industrial democracies, so equality so understood is\npuzzling. If the ideal calls on us to tear down and completely\nrestructure the social life of modern industrial democracies, it looks\nproblematic. Why accept this demand? If one qualifies and hedges the\nideal, so it is less revisionary, then the question arises, what is the\nbasis for drawing these lines of qualification and hedge.\n\n\nAt this point the advocate of an equality of condition doctrine in\nthe luck egalitarian range may see an opening. The advocate may urge\nthat we should regard inequalities in rank, power, and status not as\ndesirable or undesirable in themselves but in purely instrumental\nterms, as means or impediments to fundamental justice goals, the ones\nidentified by the best version of luck egalitarianism. For example, a\nwelfarist luck egalitarian will say that the inequalities in rank,\npower, and status that we should accept are those that contribute\neffectively to promoting good lives for people, taking account of fair\ndistribution of good across individual persons. The inequalities that\nare impediments to promoting good lives for people, fairly distributed,\nwe should oppose. The luck egalitarian will add that we should\ndistinguish two different claims that might be asserted in holding that\nSchefflerian social equality is valuable. Social inequality might be\naffirmed either as morally wrong or as humanly bad, something a prudent\nperson would seek to avoid. The luck egalitarian critic of this\nrelational equality ideal is committed only to rejecting it as a\nproposal for the domain of moral right. If being on the lower rungs of\na status hierarchy were per se a way in which one's life might go\nbadly, like failing to attain significant achievement or to have\nhealthy friendships, it would register in a luck egalitarian\ncalculation of a person's situation that determines what we\nfundamentally owe one another\u2014at least according to versions of\nluck egalitarianism that affirm a welfarist measure of people's\ncondition.\n\n\nScheffler makes a suggestion as to how one might incorporate into\nthe theory of justice a norm against certain inequalities of rank,\npower, and status and justify the selection of the \u201ccertain\ninequalities\u201d that are singled out in this way. One might invoke\nthe Rawlsian political liberalism project (Rawls, 2005). In this\nproject what is rock-bottom is the idea of society as a system of fair\ncooperation among free and equal people. This idea is understood in\nphilosophically noncommittal ways so that it can plausibly command\nsupport from all of the reasonable comprehensive conceptions of the\nright and the good affirmed by members of society and also from\nreasonable individuals who affirm no such comprehensive conception. The\nprinciples of justice are the principles people committed to this idea\nof social cooperation would affirm as capturing the core of their\nintuitive pre-theoretical commitment. Norms of relational equality that\nfigure in this scheme would then qualify as principles of justice that\nall citizens of modern democracies can affirm, and to which we are\nalready implicitly committed. To evaluate this suggestion one would\nhave to examine and assess the Rawlsian political liberalism\nproject.\n\n\nAn alternative construal of the relational equality ideal proposes\nthat people in a society relate as equals when the society's\npolitical constitution is democratic and all members are enabled to be\nfully functioning members of democratic society (Walzer 1983, Anderson\n1999). All are fully functioning members of democratic society when all\nare able to participate to a \u201cgood enough\u201d extent in all of\nits core institutions and practices. So understood, the relational\nequality ideal becomes a version of the sufficiency doctrine (on which,\nsee section 6.1 of this entry).\n\n\nRelational equality advocates usually advance their equality ideal\nas a rival to other understandings of equality including luck\negalitarianism. But these disparate equality ideals need not be\nopposed. For example, one could (1) affirm relational equality and hold\nthat in a just society people should relate as free and equal and also\n(2) affirm luck egalitarianism and hold that people should be equal in\ntheir condition (according to their holdings and attainments of\nresources, capabilities, or welfare or according to some other measure)\nexcept that people's being less well off than others is\nacceptable if the worse off could have avoided this fate by\nreasonable voluntary choice. One could uphold both ideals even if they\nsometimes conflict. One could also mix and match elements of these\ndifferent equality ideals. For example, one might hold that people\nshould have equal status and relate as equals but add that one can\nlegitimately be demoted to lesser status by being responsible for\nmaking bad choices or failing to make good choices. Along this line,\neven a staunch democratic equality advocate might allow that by virtue\nof committing a serious crime and being convicted of this offense one\nforfeits some citizenship rights at least for a time. Egregiously bad\nconduct might warrant exile. Along the same line, some benefits\ndisbursed by a democratic state might be made conditional on specified\nforms of responsible choice. These moves would all involve qualifying\nthe relational equality ideal by a luck egalitarian commitment to\nappropriate sensitivity to personal responsibility. On the other side,\na luck egalitarian view might allow that in certain domains entitlement\nto equal treatment might be forfeitable by one's irresponsible\nchoice but maintain that there is a floor of democratic equality status\nto which all members of society are unconditionally entitled. Taking\nthis stance would be to qualify commitment to luck egalitarianism by a\nconstraint of insistence on some democratic equality.\n\n\nLuck egalitarianism could be a module or component in either a\nconsequentialist or non-consequentialist moral doctrine. Luck\negalitarianism might specify one goal or even the sole goal to be\npromoted in the former, or might be understood as a deontically\nrequired form of treatment in the latter. The same is true of the\nrelational equality ideal. That people should relate as free and equal\nmight be taken to be a goal to be promoted or an entitlement to be\nrespected.\n\n\nThe discussion of relational equality versus luck egalitarianism has\nstressed the relational equality critique of the luck egalitarian way\nof integrating personal responsibility concerns into the ideal of\nequality. There are other lines of potential conflict. What these are\nwill turn on the particular versions of the ideals being considered.\nFor example, consider versions of luck egalitarianism that affirm the\nidea that all should have equal opportunity for welfare as assessed\nover the life course. The advocate of views in the welfarist equality\nof condition family will worry that relational equality could be fully\nachieved world-wide even if in each society some people lead avoidably\nmiserable and squalid lives and even if in some societies people on the\naverage are far more likely to lead avoidably miserable and squalid\nlives than in other societies. In other words, the concern is that the\nrelational equality ideal pays no heed to the moral imperative of\nbringing it about that people lead genuinely good lives, or have the\nopportunity to lead genuinely good lives, while ensuring that the\nopportunities for good are fairly distributed.\n",
