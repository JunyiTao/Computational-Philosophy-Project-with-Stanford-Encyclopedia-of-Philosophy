    "main_text": "Religion || Virtue and belief in God\n8. Sex and related issues\n\nCommentators have recently brought attention to issues of sex and\ngender in Shaftesbury\u2019s work. Shaftesbury frequently contrasts\nfemale with male characteristics, almost always with the purpose of\nelevating the latter and lowering the former (see C 1.24, 1.75, 1.149,\n1.193\u20135, 1.214\u20135, 2.16, 2.35, 2.154, 2.161, 2. 186, 2.191;\nSecond Characters 225). Trumbach argues for a \u201chomosexual\nreading\u201d of Shaftesbury\u2019s Askemata (1998: 441).\nKlein says Shaftesbury\u2019s letters suggest \u201chomosexual\nlongings and attachments\u201d that social convention and obligation\nkept him from acting on (Klein 2004). Branch (2006: 264) also finds\nsuggestions of homosexuality in his writing. Klein (2004) and\nTierney-Hynes (2015) both emphasize the \u201chomosocial\u201d\ncharacter of Shaftesbury\u2019s view of elevated human society, such\nas in the friendship between Theocles and Philocles of The\nMoralists. Tierney-Hynes also detects in Soliloquy extended\ncomparisons of writing and sex-acts, exploring in particular a\ncomparison between the self-reflection Shaftesbury recommends to\nwriters and masturbation. Barker-Benfield and Branch find in\nShaftesbury\u2019s writings \u201ca repression of male\nbehavior\u201d (Barker-Benfield 1992, 112) that leads to \u201can\naggressive sexualization of philosophy,\u201d culminating in \u201ca\nmetaphorical sexual assault on the \u2018Deity\u2019\u201d (Branch\n2006, 10). M\u00fcller (2010b) seeks to discredit all these readings\nby arguing that they misinterpret key passages by failing to take into\naccount the surrounding features of Shaftesbury\u2019s own texts, the\nearly eighteenth-century context in which Shaftesbury was writing, and\nthe ancient Greek subjects (such as Plato and Socrates) Shaftesbury\nwas discussing. Voitle\u2019s view of Shaftesbury\u2019s letters\naccords with M\u00fcller\u2019s reading (Voitle 1984: 242-244). \n",
