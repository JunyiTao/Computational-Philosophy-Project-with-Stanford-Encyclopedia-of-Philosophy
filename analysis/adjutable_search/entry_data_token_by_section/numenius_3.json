    "main_text": "Psychology\n4. Psychology\n\n\nLike most contemporary Platonists, Numenius was much preoccupied with\nthe status of soul and its relation to body. First, some fragments\nfrom Numenius' treatise On the Good (frs. 2\u20134) show\nclearly that the treatment of the soul was extensive in this\nwork. Secondly, Numenius' views on the soul are discussed by several\nlater Platonists, including Porphyry, Iamblichus, Damascius, and\nCalcidius, while they can arguably be detected in Macrobius' In\nSomnium Scipionis. The main reason for Numenius' strong interest\nin the soul, especially the human soul, must have been one which can\nbe detected also in Plotinus: the soul-body relation is paradigmatic\nfor the relation between intelligible and sensible reality in general.\nThe former is an instance of the latter, which means that we cannot\ngrasp the one independently from the other. Indeed Numenius' views on\nsoul and its relation to body square well with his views on the\nrelation between intelligible and sensible reality.\n\nPorphyry reports that Numenius speaks of two souls, a rational and a\nnon-rational one (Porphyry in Stobaeus I.350.25-351.1 Wachsmuth;\nfr. 44), while Philoponus (In de anima 9.35\u201338; fr. 47)\nsuggests that Numenius may have distinguished also a third kind of\nsoul, namely a vegetative one (phytikon). To begin with\nPorphyry's testimony, this is somewhat confusing because it does not\nmake clear that Numenius distingushes two kinds of soul and not two\nsouls in man (as Merlan 1967, 103 claims), while it groups Numenius\ntogether with those Platonists who distinguish parts of the soul\n(reason, spirit, and appetite). This, however, is a different matter\nfrom that of distinguishing different kinds of soul for different\nkinds of living thing, although both distinctions can be held by a\nPlatonist, and possibly also by Numenius. Further evidence, though,\ncorroborates the conclusion that Numenius did distinguish at least two\nkinds of soul, a rational one for humans and gods, and a nonrational\none for animals. The distinction of a third kind of soul for plants,\nthough less well attested, is perfectly possible given the testimony\nof Timaeus 77b and given Numenius' reliance on the\nTimaeus. Porphyry himself states that according to Numenius\nthe rational soul has an \u201cassenting faculty\u201d which\nmotivates all actions (fr. 45). This reference to assent suggests that\nNumenius operates with a notion of reason similar to that of the\nStoics and that, like the Stoics, he considers souls of human adults\nto be nothing but reason. This view, though, does have Platonic\ncredentials, arguably going back to Socrates as he appears in the\nProtagoras. This may explain why other Platonists\ncontemporary with Numenius, such as Celsus (Origen, Against\nCelsus VIII.49), also endorse it. This picture is confirmed by\nIamblichus' testimony, which suggests that there is a fundamental\nopposition between Numenius' two kinds of soul (On the Soul\nin Stobaeus I.374.21-375-18 Wachsmuth, fr. 43.4\u20135), namely that\nthe human soul, being rational or intellectual, is in its essence that\nof gods (fr.  41.15\u20136; Kahn 2001, 130\u20131), while that of\nother animals, being essentially non rational, is not. For Numenius\nthe human soul is of the kind of the divine soul, namely an immortal\nintellect (fr. 31.25\u20136), and in this sense human souls have\ndivine origin (fr. 52.73\u20135).\n\nApparently Numenius sides with those (notably the Stoics) who believe\nthat possessing reason makes a soul fundamentally different from souls\ndevoid of reason, and that this is crucial both for the status of the\nsoul as such as well as for its relation to the body and perhaps also\nfor the related bodily functions. For Numenius functions of this kind,\nsuch as perception, memory, and desire, are not essential to the soul\nand are later additions to it (fr. 43.7\u20139), coming into\nexistence with its embodiment. Numenius apparently held that the human\nsoul is an intellect that descended to human bodies through the\nplanets (fr.  12.14\u201316). This is a view that also Celsus shared\n(Origen, Against Celsus VI.21; see Frede 1994, 5211), which\nwe can find also in Hermetic treatises (Corpus Hermeticum. I.25;\nDodds 1960, 8). Furthermore, Origen also adopts the view that the\nhuman soul is essentially an intellect that falls in bodies and then\nbecomes a soul with the necessary faculties to operate within a human\nbody, yet the soul retains the ability to ascend and become an\nintellect again (On Principles I.4.1, I.8.1, II.6.4,\nII.9.7). Numenius arrives at this view guided by the analogy of the\nCave and the story of Er in Republic VII and X respectively,\nbut also by the description of the creation of the soul in\nthe Timaeus (41e), according to which the demiurge mounts the\nsouls on vehicles (och\u00eamata). Porphyry in his\nwork The Cave of Nymphs makes clear that he relies on\nNumenius' exegesis of the soul's descent to bodies through the planets\n(frs. 30\u201333) and speaks of the honey offered by the astrologists\nin anticipation of the future pleasures of the souls in earth\n(fr. 32). Apparently pleasures draw the soul towards the earth and\nalso keep it attached to it.\n\nFurther light is shed in Macrobius' long account about the descent of\nthe soul from the sky to the earth (In Somnium Scipionis\n1.12; test. 47 Leemans, omitted by Des Places), which at least to some\nextent must be drawn from Numenius (thus Dodds 1960, 8\u201310\nagainst Beutler 1940, 676\u2013677; the extent of Macrobius' debt to\nNumenius is debated by Elferink 1968, Ley 1972, Baltes 1975,\n252\u20133, Deuse 1983, 72\u201373). According to Macrobius' story\nof the soul's descent from heaven to earth, the soul acquires a number\nof capacities necessary for its functions in a body as it goes through\nthe planets, such as the capacity of theoretical thinking\n(logistikon) in Saturn, that of practical thinking\n(praktikon) in Jupiter, the spirited aspect (thumos)\nin Mars, the perceptual capacity (aisth\u00eatikon) and\nimagination (phantastikon) in the Sun, appetite\n(orektikon) in Venus, the linguistic capacity\n(hermeneutikon) in Mercury, and finally the vegetative\nfunctions (phutikon) in the Moon. As Frede (1987, 1072) has\nargued, the capacities acquired in the seven planetary spheres\ncorrespond to the seven parts of the soul according to the Stoics. It\nis crucial to stress that these acquired capacities neither are\nessential to soul nor do they change what the soul actually is, i.e.\nintellect (fr. 42). They rather are, as Iamblichus reports, causes of\nevil (On the Soul in Stobaeus I.374.21-375.18;\nfr. 43.7\u20139), as the soul loses its simplicity and purity. Yet\nthe evil is not due (or not only due) to the capacities themselves,\nbut rather to the accumulation of astral matter while the soul\ndescends through the planets. This is confirmed by the testimony of\nIamblichus according to which Numenius,\n Cronius,[1]\n and Harpocration\nconsider all embodiments to be invariably bad (fr. 48.10\u201314) and\nis compatible with Numenius' view that matter is the source of all\nthat is bad (see above, Metaphysics; cf. Dillon 1977, 375-376, Zambon\n2002, 213-221).\n\nWhen the soul is released from the body at death, then it remains only\nwhat it is essentially, namely intellect (fr. 35.21\u201326). If this\nis so, then for Numenius only the intellect is immortal. This however\nconflicts with the report of Damascius (In Phaedonem I.177\nWesterink; fr. 46a Des Places, wrongly attributed to Olympiodorus),\naccording to which Numenius maintained that not only the essence of\nthe soul, the intellect, is immortal, but also \u201cthe ensouled\ncondition\u201d survives death, that is, the sum of all other psychic\ncapacities (the ones connected to bodily functions), and also with the\nreport of Philoponus (In de anima 3.35\u201338; fr.  47),\naccording to which Numenius follows Plato's Phaedrus (245c)\nin maintaining that \u201call soul is immortal\u201d (Baltes 1975,\n245\u2013246, Deuse 1983, 77). The immortality of the entire soul\nthough would be incompatible with the story of the soul's descent,\naccording to which the rest of the psychic capacities is acquired and\nnot originally present in the soul. Yet Numenius possibly\ndistinguished between the immortality of the intellect, and the\nimmortality for the rest of the psychic capacities. The intellect is\nimmortal in the sense that it always lives, while the irrational part\nof the soul is immortal in that it survives death as its constituent\ncapacities dissolve gradually into the spheres from which they were\noriginated. This is also the view that Porphyry later takes (in\nStobaeus 1.384.19\u201328, Porphyry fr. 453 Smith), who may well\nfollow Numenius on this (see Smith 1974, 56\u201368, Karamanolis\n2006, 292). For Numenius the soul is immortal strictly speaking only\nin its essence, that is as intellect, being free from body, even the\nastral body or matter accumulated during its descent. Numenius\nmaintains that the human rational soul may continue to live in other\nbodies and these may also be bodies of animals if the soul becomes bad\nduring its bodily life (fr. 49; cf. Alcinous, Didascalicus\n178.26-179.39 Hermann). Presumably such a life is a form of\npunishment. \n",
