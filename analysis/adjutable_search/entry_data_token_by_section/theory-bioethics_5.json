In a 1984 issue of The Monist dedicated to\n\u201cEthics and the Modern World\u201d, Beauchamp and MacIntyre\neach probe the relation between moral theory and applied ethics.\nBeauchamp argues for the elimination of the distinction between the\ntwo, citing the lack of significant difference between them in terms\nof philosophical activity or method. Philosophers doing applied ethics\ndo what philosophers have always done, says Beauchamp\u2014they\nanalyze concepts, for instance, and submit to critical scrutiny\nvarious strategies that are used to justify beliefs, policies, and\nactions. The application model also problematically presumes a\nunilateral direction to the flow of ethical knowledge, from moral\ntheory to practical cases and problems. But in fact, says Beauchamp,\nmoral theory has much to learn from practical contexts (Beauchamp\n1984).\n",
