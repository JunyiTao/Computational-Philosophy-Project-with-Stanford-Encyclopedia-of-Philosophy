Preliminaries\n1.1 The School and its History\n\nThe Stoic school was founded around 300 BCE by Zeno of Citium, a\nvoracious reader of Socratic dialogues, who also studied under the\nCynic Crates and was influenced by the teachings of Plato\u2019s\nAcademy and the Megarian School. The Stoa competed with the school\nfounded only a little before in Athens by Epicurus, and Stoic and\nEpicurean views are often compared and contrasted. Zeno was succeeded\nin the leadership of the Stoa first by Cleanthes of Assos and then by\nChrysippus of Soli, who headed the school from around 230 until 206\nBCE and was by all accounts its foremost theorist and systematizer.\nFollowing Chrysippus, the position of \u201cscholarch\u201d passed\nto his former students, the last of which being Diogenes of Babylon in\nthe middle of the 2nd century BCE.\n\nSome scholars see this moment as marking a shift in the Stoic school,\nfrom the so-called \u201cOld Stoa\u201d to \u201cMiddle\nStoicism\u201d, though the relevance and accuracy of this\nnomenclature is debated (see Inwood 2022). The latter term is\nnonetheless frequently used to encompass the work of Stoic\nphilosophers in the second and first centuries BCE. A significant\nfeature of the second century is the sharp and powerful attacks\nagainst Stoic views formulated by the Academic\n Carneades,\n to which Antipater of Tarsus, Diogenes\u2019 successor, responded at\nlength. Diogenes and Antipater also heralded increased engagement with\nPlatonic (Sedley 2003; Reydams-Schils 1999) and possibly Aristotelian\ndoctrine, arguably peaking with Panaetius in the second half of 2nd\ncentury BCE and his student Posidonius in the first century BCE. For\ndevelopments from Antipater onwards, see Inwood 2022; for the\ncontributions of Panaetius and Posidonius and their relation to\nprevious thinkers, see Tieleman 2007.\n\nStoicism became particularly fashionable in the Roman period. Although\nnever identifying as a Stoic himself,\n Cicero,\n who studied philosophy in Athens and endeavored to popularize it at\nRome, engaged extensively with Stoic theory in his philosophical works\nand modeled his On Proper Functions (De Officiis) on\nPanaetius\u2019 treatise of the same name. During the Imperial era,\nseveral prominent public figures were associated with the Stoic\nschool. Appointed to the court of Emperor Augustus in the late 1st\ncentury BCE was the Stoic philosopher Arius Didymus, and a generation\nlater\n Seneca\n served as advisor to Nero.\n Epictetus,\n a former slave, was expelled from Rome by Domitian along with other\nphilosophers in 93 CE, and his works, recorded by his student Arrian,\nheavily influenced\n Marcus Aurelius,\n Roman Emperor from 161\u2013180 CE. Also active in the second\ncentury CE was the Stoic philosopher Hierocles, whose detailed\ntreatise on psychology and ethical theory, The Elements of\nEthics, is partially extant (see Ramelli 2009).\n\nOver this remarkable span of time during which the Stoic school\noperated in some form or another, evolutions in views and shifts in\nfocus unsurprisingly took place. The nature and extent of these\nintra-school developments and disagreements \u2013 some of which we\nwill consider below \u2013 remains the subject of ongoing scholarly\ndebate.\n1.2 Systematicity\n\nStoic philosophy was, from Zeno onwards, conceived of as comprising\nthree parts: physics (phusik\u00ea), logic\n(logik\u00ea), and ethics (\u00eathik\u00ea).\nEach of these parts includes a wide array of further topics nowadays\ndealt with separately. Logic, for example, includes not only formal\nlogic, but also questions now typically falling under the remit of\nphilosophy of language, epistemology, and philosophy of mind. In\naddition, all three parts of philosophy were thought by the Stoics to\nwork together to form an interconnected and coherent system (exactly\nhow strongly the claim of systematization is to be taken is disputed;\nsee below). The Stoics emphasized this point with a number of\nanalogies intended to illustrate how the three parts of philosophy fit\ntogether and form a whole:\n\n\nThey compare philosophy to a living being, likening logic to bones and\nsinews, ethics to the fleshier parts, and physics to the soul. They\nmake a further comparison to an egg: logic is the outside, ethics what\ncomes next, and physics the innermost parts; or to a fertile field:\nthe surrounding wall corresponds to logic, its fruit to ethics, and\nits land or trees to physics. (Diogenes Laertius, 26B; see our\n bibliography\n for a guide to citations in this entry)\n\n\nThe latter two analogies seem to point to the idea that the purpose of\nphilosophy, according to the Stoics, is to become virtuous, that is,\nto attain wisdom and thereby lead the good life, so that the\noverarching goal (the crop or the egg white, which the ancients\nassumed was nourished by the yolk) is ethical. Nonetheless, the other\nparts of philosophy play an essential and necessary part in achieving\nthis goal, and the orthodox Stoic position is that mastery of all\nthree parts of philosophy is required for human flourishing. This is\napparent in the way the Stoics treat a number of philosophical\nquestions and in the many connections visible between the different\nparts of their theory: conclusions in one part of Stoic philosophy\ntend to reinforce and ratify those in another. For recent discussion\nof the unity of the Stoic system, see Bronowski 2019, ch. 1; cf.\nChristensen 1962, Ierodiakonou 1993, and Inwood 2012. For debates on\nthe connection of Stoic ethics to other parts of the system,\nespecially physics, see Annas 1993, who takes the ethical part to be\nlargely independent of physical theory, and Cooper 1999a and 2012, who\nsees them as thoroughly intertwined (see also Betegh 2003).\n1.3 Sources\n\nIt is impossible to consider the philosophical contributions of the\nStoics without noting a significant exegetical challenge: the paucity\nof original texts. We do not possess a single complete work authored\nby any of the first three heads of the Stoic school, Zeno, Cleanthes,\nand Chrysippus, despite their prolific output in antiquity.\nChrysippus, for example, is reported to have written over 150 works,\nof which only fragments remain. Likewise, the treatises authored in\nthe Middle Stoa are no longer extant. The only complete works by Stoic\nphilosophers that survive are those by writers of Imperial times,\nSeneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, as well as by lesser known\nauthors such as Cornutus, Cleomedes, and Hierocles (discussed in\nInwood 2022). Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus focus to a significant\ndegree on ethics and only sparingly present the wide and extensive\ntheoretical bases of the system (for their views on logic, see Barnes\n1997). These later Stoics also had philosophical agendas of their own,\nso that their work might not always straightforwardly reflect the\nviews of their predecessors.\n\nFor detailed information about the Old Stoa, we have to depend on\neither later doxographies, including Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nencyclopedia account in book 7 of his Lives of Eminent\nPhilosophers, pseudo-Plutarch\u2019s Philosophers\u2019\nOpinions on Nature (Placita), and Stobaeus\u2019\nExcerpts (Eclogae) \u2013 and their sources Aetius\n(circa 1st c. CE) and Arius Didymus (1st c. BCE\u2013CE) \u2013 or\nother philosophers who discuss the Stoics for their own purposes.\nNearly all of the latter group are hostile witnesses. Among them are\nthe Aristotelian commentator\n Alexander of Aphrodisias\n (late 2nd c. CE) who criticizes the Stoics in On Mixture and\nOn Fate and contrasts their views piecemeal with those of\nAristotle in other works; the Platonist\n Plutarch\n (1st-2nd c. CE) who authored anti-Stoic tracts such as On Stoic\nSelf-Contradictions and Against the Stoics on Common\nConceptions; the medical writer\n Galen\n (2nd c. CE); the Pyrrhonian skeptic,\n Sextus Empiricus\n (2nd c. CE) who sharply criticizes most aspects of the Stoic system,\nand in so doing provides detailed reports of Stoic doctrine; the\nNeo-Platonist\n Plotinus\n (3rd c. CE); the Christian bishops Eusebius (3rd\u20134th c. CE),\nNemesius (circa 400 CE); and the sixth-century Neo-Platonist\ncommentator,\n Simplicius.\n Another important source is\n Cicero\n (1st c. BCE). Though his own philosophical position derives from that\nof his teacher\n Philo of Larissa\n and the New Academy, Cicero is not without sympathy for what he sees\nas the high moral tone of Stoicism. In his philosophical works \u2013\nespecially On Academic Skepticism, On the Nature of the\nGods, and On Moral Ends (De Finibus) \u2013 he\nprovides summaries in Latin, with critical discussion, of Stoic views.\nSee also the entry on the\n Doxography of Ancient Philosophy.\n\nFrom these sources, scholars have assembled collections of quotations\nand doxographical reports. The first collection of its kind, von\nArnim\u2019s Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta (SVF), gathered\nfragments of Stoic works and testimonia in their original Greek and\nLatin into a three-volume set in 1903\u20135. Fragments and\ntestimonia of the early Stoics are often referred to by von\nArnim\u2019s volume numbers and text numeration, e.g. SVF I.345. The\nsecond half of the 20th century saw a revival of interest in\nHellenistic philosophy and in the Stoics in particular, not least\nthanks to A. A. Long and D. Sedley\u2019s 1987 The Hellenistic\nPhilosophers (LS) which contains (in vol. 1) English translations\nand commentary of many important texts on the Stoics, Epicureans, and\nSkeptics. This was followed by Hellenistic Philosophy in\n1988, a collection of primary texts edited by B. Inwood and L. P.\nGerson, with a second edition in 1997. In 1987, fragments pertaining\nto dialectic were collected with a German translation in K.\nH\u00fclser\u2019s Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker\n(FDS). More recently, in 2022, Later Stoicism 155 BCE to CE\n200 by B. Inwood has made available the works of some often\nneglected Stoic writers. \n\nThe surviving evidence so gathered allows readers to piece together a\npicture of the content and, in some cases, the development of Stoic\ndoctrine. In some areas, there is a fair bit of consensus about what\nthe Stoics thought, and we can even attach names to particular\ninnovations. However, in other areas the interpretation of our meager\nevidence is hotly contested.\n2. Physical Theory\n\nStoic physical theory included topics traditionally covered by natural\nphilosophy, and it is where the Stoics developed their ontology and\nmetaphysics. As is to be expected of their systematic approach to\nphilosophy, much of Stoic physics is fundamental in underpinning their\nviews in ethics and also interacts with some of their logic and\nphilosophy of language.\n2.1 Bodies and Incorporeals\n\nStoic ontology is radically materialist or, more precisely,\ncorporealist. According to the Stoics, only bodies exist, because only\nbodies have the capacity to act or be acted upon (Cicero, 45A; Sextus,\n45B, Nemesius, 45C). This bold stance has wide-ranging implications:\nthe soul is a body, as are its attributes, so that wisdom, too, for\nexample, is a body (see below,\n 2.9).\n This follows from the intricate make up of the world by principles\n (2.3).\n\nBodies nonetheless do not exhaust their ontology. Although only bodies\nexist, i.e. only bodies have being, the Stoics allow for entities with\na lesser, or, at any rate, distinct, ontological status, that of\n\u201csubsisting\u201d (huphistanai). This is the case of\nthe four incorporeals: time, place, void, and lekta. Of\nthese, void is perhaps the most intuitively grasped: it is\n\u201cincorporeal and intangible, neither has shape nor takes on\nshape, neither is acted upon in any respect nor acts, but is simply\nable to receive body\u201d (Cleomedes, 49C). Void is essential to the\nuniverse, not least because it surrounds it and allows for bodies to\nmove into it during the cyclical conflagrations (more on which below,\n 2.5;\n on void, see de Harven 2015). Place\u2019s incorporeal status is\nsimilarly justified insofar as it can be the receptor of body but\nlacks the power to act or be acted upon. Understanding the incorporeal\nstatus of time is trickier (for a recent treatment, see Salles 2018).\nSome of what we might consider aspects of time are uncontroversially\nbodies: day and night, or years, for example. We are also told that\nthe past and the future subsist, while the present\n\u201cobtains\u201d or \u201cis realized\u201d\n(huparchein, a term which has been the subject of much\nscholarly attention: see Goldschmidt 1972, Barnes 2007, p. 69, Bailey\n2014). One way of understanding the sense in which time is incorporeal\nis by analogy with place, as the temporal intervals through which\nbodies pass (cf. Sedley 1999, section 6). Lekta, the final\nkind of incorporeal item, seem to stand out on this list. Usually\ntranslated as \u201csayables\u201d (from legein, \u201cto\nsay\u201d), they are roughly the sorts of things that can be said or\nexpressed by linguistic expressions and form the contents of\nimpressions and thoughts. They are treated in more detail in the\nsection on logic\n (3.2),\n but they also play a role in causation\n (2.8),\n and their metaphysical status has been the subject of much debate.\nFor a recent treatment of lekta, see Bronowski 2019; see also\nFrede 1994b.\n\nIt is particularly interesting that the incorporeals are said to\n\u201csubsist\u201d (huphistanai): the nature of this\nontological status remains a puzzle. What, if anything, they depend on\nfor their subsistence is not clear. It is usually agreed that place,\nvoid, and time are mind independent, and many agree that this is also\nthe case of lekta (Long 1971 is perhaps the strongest\nproponent of the alternative view that lekta are\nmind-dependent). It is in any case generally clear that\nincorporeals together with bodies are in some way essential to the\nmakeup of the universe, and that bodies and incorporeals share the\nstatus of being \u201csomething\u201d (ti).\n2.2 Something: the Supreme Genus\n\n\u201cSomething\u201d (ti) is described as the\n\u201csupreme genus\u201d (Seneca, 27A), broader than being, which\nconstitutes \u201cthe all\u201d (to pan). The Stoics\nrecognize other entities to which they deny being, including fictional\nentities and concepts or universals, which they place on a par with\neach other as \u201cfigments of the mind\u201d (Diogenes Laertius,\n32C). Universals, in particular, are famously said to be\nquasi-somethings (hosanei ti) or not-somethings\n(outina) (Diogenes Laertius, 32C; Stobaeus, 30A). This has\nled to much debate and speculation as to the status of these entities\nand in particular where they stand relative to the class of\n\u201csomethings\u201d. For different views on the matter, see\nBrunschwig 1988; Sedley 1984, 1999; Caston 1999; Sellars 2011; Bailey\n2014. The metaphysical status of limits is similarly debated: see Ju\n2009.\n2.3 Principles and Mixture\n\nFundamental to Stoic physics and the explanations of natural phenomena\nit offers are the two principles (archai), the active\nprinciple and the passive principle, which bear complex and often\ndebated relations to pneuma, primary matter, the four\nelements (air, water, fire, earth), and the cosmos as a whole. These\nterms appear to be used in different senses in the surviving\nfragmentary evidence, making the task of reconstructing a coherent and\nunified physical theory somewhat challenging.\n\nThe active and passive principles together make up the world and\neverything in it. To achieve this, the active principle, which is\nidentified with God or Zeus (see\n 2.7\n for further discussion of Stoic theology), acts on the passive\nprinciple, which is also called (at least by Zeno) primary matter.\nPrimary matter is eternal, unqualified, formless, and inert. Primary\nmatter is suffused throughout by the active principle in order to\ncreate objects in the world. The active and the passive principles in\nthis way both constitute the cosmos and all objects in it. The Stoics\nstressed that they are entirely blended, or mixed \u201cthrough and\nthrough\u201d (Galen, 47H; Alexander of Aphrodisias, 48C), and\ndeveloped a theory of mixture which allowed for two bodies to be in\nthe same place at the same time (Hensley 2018; cf. Helle 2018 and\n2022).\n\nThe vehicle for the divine active principle is called pneuma,\nliterally \u201cbreath\u201d (Hensley 2020). Pneuma, by its\nnature, has a simultaneous movement inward and outward which\nconstitutes its inherent \u201ctensility\u201d. Pneuma\npasses through all (other) bodies; in its outward motion it gives them\nthe qualities that they have, and in its inward motion makes them\nunified objects (Nemesius, 47J; cf. Helle 2021). Pneuma comes\nin gradations and endows the bodies which it pervades with different\nqualities as a result. The pneuma which sustains an inanimate\nobject is a \u201ctenor\u201d (hexis, lit. \u201ca\nholding\u201d). Pneuma in plants is, in addition,\n\u201cphysique\u201d (phusis, lit. \u201cnature\u201d),\nand in animals, it is \u201csoul\u201d (psuch\u00ea, see\n 2.9\n below). \n2.4 Elements\n\nThe four elements, fire, air, water, and earth, are also important\nentities to which the Stoics appeal in their physical theory. Sources\noffer contradicting evidence as to the relationship of the elements to\nother bodies and notably to the two principles. Unlike the passive\nprinciple, elements appear to have some qualities (fire, for example,\nis hot). Nonetheless, the elements also sometimes seem to constitute\nor make up the principles themselves. The active principle, for\nexample, is said to be made up of fire and air, while matter is\nsometimes said to be made up of water and earth (Nemesius, 47D). The\nactive principle is described as fiery (Galen, On the Habits of\nthe Soul, 4.783) and the tensility of pneuma is\nsometimes accounted for by the interaction of hot fire and cold air\nwhich rarefy and condense in turn, modifying the density of other\nelements.\n2.5 Cosmic Cycle and Conflagration\n\nThe elements, especially fire, play a central role in the cosmogony\nand the cosmogonic process (Hensley 2021, Salles 2015, Long 2008, Hahm\n1977). The Stoics hold that the cosmos goes through a cycle of endless\nrecurrence with periods of conflagration, a state in which all is\nfire, and periods of cosmic order, with the world as we experience it\n(Nemesius, 52C). In between these periods, the generation of the\nelements occurs to create the cosmos in which all four elements exist.\n(This apparently orthodox Stoic view was rejected by some, notably\nPanaetius (Van Staaten, fr. 65).)\n\nThis idea of world-cycles punctuated by conflagrations raises a number\nof questions. Will there be another you reading this encyclopedia\nentry in the next world cycle? Or merely someone exactly similar to\nyou? Different sources attribute different answers to the Stoics on\nthese questions. (For sameness of person, see Alexander, 52F; for\nsomeone indistinguishable, but somehow not identical, see Origen,\n52G.) The doctrine of eternal recurrence also bears on the Stoic view\nof time. Did they suppose that the moment in the next world cycle at\nwhich you (or someone indistinguishable from you) reads this entry is\na moment in the future (so time is linear) or the very same moment\n(with some notion of circular time)? The Stoic definition of time as\nthe \u201cdimension (diast\u00eama) of motion\u201d or\n\u201cof the world\u2019s motion\u201d (Simplicius, 51A) hardly\nseems to settle the question. For a clear exchange on the issue, see\nLong 1985 and Hudson 1990; see also Greene 2018 and Salles 2018.\n2.6 Categories\n\nAside from the basic ontology, the Stoics identify four genera of\nbeing usually referred to as \u201ccategories\u201d (see especially\nMenn 1999): matter or substance (hupokeimenon), quality\n(poion), disposition (p\u00f4s echon), relative\ndisposition or relation (pros ti p\u00f4s echon). Substance\nis a portion of passive principles or elements. An object so conceived\njust is a lump of matter (unlike prime matter, not entirely\nundifferentiated insofar as it is a portion of it, distinct from some\nother portion). Quality, which is subdivided into common and proper is\na portion of pneuma, organizing the matter so as to give it\ncertain properties. In particular, the portion of pneuma\nserves to unify the underlying matter or substance so as to make it a\nparticular object. This latter role is likely to be that of what is\nidentified as a proper quality, for example the quality of being\nSocrates (on proper qualities, see Nawar 2017). Proper qualities play\nan important role in questions about identity and individuation (cf.\nSedley 1982, Lewis 1995). Objects do not exclusively belong to one or\nthe other category. We can speak of an object as the underlying\nsubstance (the hupokeimenon) or of a qualified object capable\nof bearing further qualities. Disposition and relations are\nparadigmatically properties of already qualified objects, so that the\nfist, for example, is said to be the hand disposed in a certain way\n(Sextus, 33P). Relations are properties which depend on the relata, so\nthat a change in the relata causes the relation to cease to exist, for\nexample \u201cbeing on the right of\u201d. The categories are put to\nwork in various ways, including in ethics and psychology (see\nAlexander, 29A and Seneca, 29B), e.g. in the claim that knowledge is\nthe commanding faculty disposed in a certain way (Sextus, 33P).\n2.7 God\n\nIn accord with their ontology, the Stoics make God a corporeal entity,\nidentical with the active principle. God is further characterized as\neternal reason (logos: Diogenes Laertius, 44B) or intelligent\ndesigning fire or breath (pneuma) which structures matter in\naccordance with its plan (Aetius, 46A). The Stoic God is thus immanent\nthroughout the cosmos and directs its development down to the smallest\ndetail. The entire cosmos is a living thing, and God stands to the\ncosmos as an animal\u2019s life force stands to the animal\u2019s\nbody, enlivening, moving and directing it by its presence throughout.\nThe designing fire is likened to sperm or seed which contains the\nfirst principles or directions of all the things which will\nsubsequently develop (Diogenes Laertius, 46B; Aristocles in Eusebius,\n46G). This makes cosmic nature and all its parts inherently governed\nby a rational force. God and divine actions are not, like the gods of\nGreek Mythology, random and unpredictable. It is rather orderly,\nrational, and providential. The association of God with\npneuma may have its origins in medical theories of the\nHellenistic period: see Baltzly 2003 and Annas 1992. On the issue of\nGod and its relation to the cosmos in Stoicism, see the essays in\nSalles 2009.\n2.8 Causes and Determinism\n\nAn important issue that straddles metaphysics and logic is that of\ncausal determinism. The Stoics are determinists about causation, who\nregard the present as fully determined by past events, but who\nnonetheless want to preserve scope for moral responsibility by\ndefending a version of compatibilism.\n\nThe Stoic analysis of causation is peculiar and might sound odd to the\nmodern ear. They say that every cause is a body which becomes the\ncause to a body of something incorporeal. For instance, the scalpel, a\nbody, becomes the cause to the flesh, a body, of the incorporeal\npredicate \u201cbeing cut\u201d. (Sextus, 55B; cf. Stobaeus, 55A).\nIn addition, the Stoics develop a taxonomy of causes, the sources on\nwhich are complex and not always clear, but which they brought to bear\nin their defense of compatibilism.\n\nWhat the Stoics call fate, which they identify with the working out of\nthe \u2013 rational and predictable \u2013 will of Zeus, is \u201ca\ncertain natural everlasting ordering of the whole: one set of things\nfollows on and succeeds another, and the interconnexion in\ninviolable\u201d (Aulus Gellius, 55K). In other words, every event\nthat occurs in the world is the result of a cause or chain of causes,\nso that everything that happens is metaphysically determined by\npreceding causes in the chain (but not logically necessary; cf. de\nHarven 2016). This sequence of causes is inescapable.\n\nThe inescapability of this sequence of causes leads to concerns about\naction and moral responsibility. The first worry, which takes the form\nof the so-called \u201clazy argument\u201d (Cicero, 55S) is that, if\nall my actions and their consequences are predetermined, there is no\npoint in acting at all: why call the doctor when ill, if it is\ndetermined that the doctor will come? The second worry is that if my\nactions come about by prior causes, they are not in my power and I am\ntherefore not truly responsible for them.\n\nIn response to the former challenge, Chrysippus claimed that not all\nevents are independent of one another. Rather, some are co-fated: part\nof one and the same causal chain in such a way that they cannot be\ndissociated. The call to the doctor and the doctor\u2019s coming are\nso joined, as is the patient\u2019s healing. The doctor will not come\nif she is not called, and the patient will not heal if the doctor does\nnot come. Calling the doctor is thus not superfluous or pointless. The\nconsequences of our actions may be predetermined, but only insofar as\nthey are caused by our actions. Our actions are thus not pointless: we\nmust act in order to ensure their consequences come about (see further\ncritical discussion in Brennan 2005, ch. 16).\n\nIn response to the concern about moral responsibility, Chrysippus\nbegins by distinguishing different types of causes. Although nothing\nhappens without an antecedent cause, he claims, not all antecedent\ncauses are sufficient for bringing about their effect (Plutarch, 55R):\nsome antecedent causes \u2013 those which are called \u201cauxiliary\nand proximate\u201d (Cicero, 62C) \u2013 function as merely\nnecessary conditions.\n\nChrysippus deploys this distinction among antecedent causes in the\ncourse of explaining how human actions are both causally determined\nand subject to moral evaluation. Though the details are difficult, the\ngeneral strategy is clear enough and illuminated by the famous\ncylinder and cone analogy:\n\n\n[Chrysippus] resorts to his cylinder and cone: these cannot begin to\nmove without a push; but once that has happened, he holds that it is\nthereafter through their own nature that the cylinder rolls and the\ncone spins. \u2018Hence\u2019, he says, \u2018just as the person\nwho pushed the cylinder gave it its beginning of motion but not its\ncapacity for rolling, likewise, although the impression encountered\nwill print and, as it were, emblazon its appearance on the mind,\nassent will be in our power.\u2019 (Cicero, 62C; see also Gellius,\n62D)\n\n\nConsider two differently shaped solids \u2013 a cylinder and a cone\n\u2013 both sitting atop the same steep slope. The two solids are\ngiven a push of equal strength and begin to tumble down the hill. But\nwhereas the cylinder rolls in a straight path, the cone spins and\nveers off to the side. Neither of these movements could have occurred\nwithout the push, Chrysippus argues, but the particular way each solid\nmoves \u2013 whether it rolls or spins \u2013 is caused by its own\nnature and \u201ccapacity for rolling\u201d. The push therefore\nfunctions as an \u201cauxiliary and proximate\u201d antecedent\ncause, which on its own is sufficient for causing the solid to move,\nbut not for causing it to roll rather than spin. Rather, it is the\nindividual nature of each solid that is so responsible. (Note that,\ngiven the push the solid receives, together with its own nature and\ncapacity for rolling, each solid could not do otherwise than move in\nthe way that it does.)\n\nNow consider two agents with different psychological profiles \u2013\nfor instance, one person who is a glutton for sweets and another who\nis not \u2013 both of whom are presented with a thick slice of carrot\ncake. That the glutton rushes towards the cake and eagerly gobbles it\nup, whereas the other agent does not (perhaps picking at it slowly\nover a few hours), maps onto the cylinder\u2019s rolling and the\ncone\u2019s spinning. Both agents receive the same external stimulus\nfor action and form \u201cimpressions\u201d (mental representations,\nphantasiai / visa) of the cake, but, like the push\nin the case of the solids, these are not sufficient to cause the\ndifferential behavioral response in the two agents. Rather, it is\ntheir individual psychological profiles and the activity of giving or\nwithholding mental \u201cassent\u201d to the impression that eating\nthe cake is fitting to do which cause them to gobble the cake or not\n(more on impression, assent, and action in\n 2.9\n below). One\u2019s psychological profile is causally efficacious for\naction, over and above the external stimulus. So among the antecedent\ncauses for human action \u2013 and by far the most decisive \u2013\nis the agent himself, his individual nature or psychological profile,\nwith the result that our actions are \u201cup to us\u201d or\n\u201cin our power\u201d in a way that is relevant for the notion of\nresponsibility.\n\nMuch more could be said on this analogy. Detailed scholarly work on\nthe question of freedom and determinism in Stoicism can be found in\nBobzien 1998. See also Brennan 2005, ch. 14\u201315, Salles 2005, and\nthe entry on\n Ancient Theories of Freedom and Determinism.\n2.9 Psychology\n\nOne further topic treated as part of Stoic physics is psychology, the\naccount of the soul. Here the Stoics argue that the soul is corporeal,\ni.e. a body of a certain kind, since it is causally efficacious in a\nway that only bodies are. If the soul were incorporeal, as some\nancient philosophers maintain, then it could not causally interact\nwith the body it animates, as it does e.g. in feeling pain when the\nbody suffers a flesh-wound or in causing the cheeks to blush when it\nfeels shame (Nemesius reporting Cleanthes, 45C). Furthermore, if\nx and y come into contact with each other, then\nx and y must be bodies. But the soul and the body it\nanimates are in constant contact, the Stoics hold, and are later\nseparated from each other at death (Nemesius reporting Chrysippus,\n45D). Therefore the soul is corporeal.\n\nWhat kind of body is the soul? As mentioned above\n (2.3),\n the Stoics identify the soul as pneuma at a certain degree\nof tensility, more rarified than pneuma in the condition of\ntenor (hexis), which is responsible for the coherence of\nsolid objects, and than pneuma in the condition of nature\n(phusis), which regulates vital activities such as nutrition\nand growth (Philo, 47P, Q). Pneuma in the condition of soul\nenables the animal to take in perceptual information from its\nsurroundings, by forming impressions (phantasiai), and to\nmove itself from place to place, by forming impulses (hormai)\n(Origen, 53A).\n\nIn a noteworthy break from both ordinary Greek usage and earlier\nphilosophical theories, the Stoics deny that all living things have\nsouls. Plants have tenor-pneuma and nature-pneuma\nbut not soul, since they do not engage in perception or\nself-locomotion (Philo, 47P; Origen, 53A). Ensouled life is therefore\ndistinguished by the possession of the representational and\nmotivational faculties just mentioned: impression and impulse. In\nnarrowing the conception of the soul from a general principle of life\nto one that refers specifically to these more obviously mental\ncharacteristics, the Stoics take an important step forward in the\nhistory of the philosophy of mind (on which see Annas 1992, Nawar\n2020, and the entry on\n Ancient Theories of Soul).\n\nAmong ensouled creatures, some, such as mature human beings, possess\nreason (logos) and are called \u201crational\u201d\n(logikos), while others, such as dogs or cows, do not and are\ncalled \u201cnon-rational\u201d (alogos). What can the\nrational soul do that the non-rational cannot? Arguably, the most\nimportant difference is the power of assent (sunkatathesis).\nAssent is a faculty found only in the rational soul \u2013 in\nparticular, only in the ruling part or commanding faculty\n(h\u00eagemonikon) of the rational soul (Aetius, 53H;\nIamblichus, 53K) \u2013 which enables us to adopt a critical stance\ntowards our own impressions and pass judgment on them (Origen, 53A).\nRational creatures give assent to the impression that p when\nthey deem p to be true; otherwise, they suspend assent on\np. (\u201cDissenting\u201d, or taking p to be\nfalse, seems to be more precisely analyzed by the Stoics as suspending\nassent on p and then giving assent to not-p.)\nRational creatures are morally and epistemically responsible for our\nacts of assent, but not for the kinds of impressions we form: assent\nis \u201cin our power\u201d or \u201cup to us\u201d in a way that\nreceiving an impression is not (cf. the cylinder and cone analogy\nabove,\n 2.8).\n For the Stoics, there is no exaggeration in the claim that what kind\nof person we are \u2013 whether we are virtuous or not, or\nknowledgeable or not \u2013 depends entirely on our acts of assent.\nThe Stoic conception of assent is therefore of far-reaching\nimportance, both within their own system and for a proper\nunderstanding of later philosophical debates (cataloged in Nawar 2020;\nsee also Frede 2011).\n\nAccording to Stoic psychological theory,\n the outcome of giving assent to the impression that p will\nbe either a doxastic commitment of a certain kind (knowledge,\ncognition, or the opinion that p; see\n 3.7\n below) or a \u201crational impulse\u201d. Impulse, in general, is\nthe psychological event responsible for action, and in rational\ncreatures all impulses are \u201crational impulses\u201d \u2013\n\u201cmovements of thought towards something in the sphere of\naction\u201d (Stobaeus, 53Q). Since assent is necessary and\nsufficient for any rational impulse to be created, the Stoics can be\nseen to endorse a strong form of \u201cmotivational\ncognitivism\u201d: all cases of human action require, and follow\nupon, the agent forming the judgment that the action in question is\nappropriate for them to do (Klein 2015; Graver 2007; Inwood 1985).\nThis account would seem to rule out the possibility of occurrent\nmental conflict, or akrasia, in the form of simultaneously\nconflicting impulses, since it is impossible for the rational mind as\na whole to maintain, at one and the same time, conflicting judgments\n(acts of assent) about what is fitting to do. (Some Stoics seem to\nhave re-analyzed cases of putatively simultaneous akrasia as\ninstead a rapid oscillation between opposing practical judgments:\nPlutarch, 65G.) Stoic psychology and action theory can therefore be\nunderstood as a rejection of the Platonic-Aristotelian approach of\npositing non-rational sources of cognition and motivation in the\nmature human soul, which can potentially oppose the dictates of\nreason, in favor of a reversion to the monistic intellectualism of\nSocrates. Like Socrates, the Stoics are committed to the claim that\nhuman action invariably reflects the assessment of the rational mind\nas a whole concerning what is appropriate to do in the scenario.\n\nGiven this theory, the Stoics construe the skeptical practice of\nglobal suspension of judgment as entailing apraxia, i.e.\ntotal inaction (cf. Plutarch, 69A). For further discussion of the\napraxia charge, see Obdrzalek 2012 and the entries on\n Arcesilaus\n and\n Ancient Skepticism.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, human beings are not born with reason but\nrather acquire it later in life (at age seven, according to Aetius,\n39E). In childhood, then, we utilize a non-rational soul, just like\nnon-rational animals, and thus form impulses without the intervention\nof assent. (On the development of rationality in humans, see Frede\n1994c.) Interestingly, the Stoics also distinguish between rational\nand non-rational impressions, i.e. the impressions formed by\nrational and non-rational creatures (Diogenes Laertius, 39A). Exactly\nhow rational impressions (phantasiai logikai) differ from\ntheir non-rational counterparts remains the subject of lively\nscholarly debate. It is broadly agreed, however, that only rational\nimpressions are created under the direct influence of the\nperceiver\u2019s concepts (ennoiai; cf. Galen, 53V), and\nthat only rational impressions express propositions\n(axi\u00f4mata, one kind of sayable or lekton) (see\nFrede 1983, 1994c; Brittain 2002; Shogry 2019; for alternative views,\nsee Caston forthcoming, and Sorabji 1990).\n3. Logic\n\nThe scope of the branch of philosophy the Stoics called\n\u201clogic\u201d (logik\u00ea) was wide, including not\nonly the analysis of argument forms and the development of a formal\nsystem of logic, but also rhetoric, grammar, epistemology, and what we\nmight now call philosophy of language, including extensive theories of\nlanguage and meaning. Stoic contributions to logic and philosophy of\nlanguage, as well as the backdrop of Aristotelian and Megarian views\nin the Hellenistic period, are thoroughly surveyed in Barnes, Bobzien\nand Mignucci 1999, and in an abbreviated version by Bobzien in Inwood\n2003.\n3.1 Rhetoric and Dialectic\n\nThe branch of logic is subdivided into rhetoric and dialectic\n(Diogenes Laertius, 31A). The former is described as \u201cthe\nscience [or knowledge, epist\u00eam\u00ea] of speaking\nwell\u201d, though it also included, for example, extensive study of\netymology (for more on rhetoric, and in particular how narrow its\nscope might have been, see Atherton 1988). Dialectic is \u201cthe\nscience [or knowledge, epist\u00eam\u00ea] of what is true,\nfalse, and neither\u201d or \u201cthe science [or knowledge,\nepist\u00eam\u00ea] of what signifies and what is\nsignified\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 32C), mastery of which is\nrequired for wisdom, since \u201cthe Sage is always a\ndialectician\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 31C; the \u201cSage\u201d\nbeing the Stoic label for the ideal human being, i.e. the wise and\nvirtuous person). Dialectic as a field of study first sprung from the\npractice of dialectic in the form of questions and answers but became,\nlargely under the influence of Chrysippus, increasingly systematized\nand more technical to include the in-depth study of language, meaning,\narguments, and epistemology (cf. Gourinat 2000; Castagnoli 2010). It\nis in fact in dialectic that we find most of the material that\ninfluences the later so-called technical grammarians (on which see\nmore below,\n 5.1,\n cf. Atherton and Blank 2003). This goes hand in hand with the\nsystematicity of Stoic philosophy. The Stoics believed language to be\ninherently natural and to be such as to match the natural, rational\norder of things, so that language has a natural propensity to capture\nobjects in the world and its structure. The study of language in\ndialectic is thus an integral part of Stoic philosophy as a whole.\n3.2 Philosophy of Language and Lekta\n\nWith the distinction of \u201cwhat signifies\u201d and \u201cwhat\nis signified\u201d, the Stoics introduce what is perhaps their most\ncelebrated innovation in the philosophy of language: the\nlekta or \u201csayables\u201d. What signifies is uttered or\nwritten language (words, sentences) in the form of air struck or\nsymbols in ink or in clay, and, as such, a body. What is signified, on\nthe other hand, is an incorporeal, namely a lekton. The term\nitself is notoriously difficult to translate: from the verb\nlegein, \u201cto speak\u201d but also \u201cto\nreason\u201d, it is literally \u201cwhat can be said\u201d \u2013\nand not all lekta are in fact said. Lekta are\ndefined as \u201cthat which subsists in accordance with a rational\nimpression\u201d (Sextus, 33B), and they form the contents of\nrational impressions, concepts, and judgments.\n\nThe relationship of language to lekta is the subject of\ndebate, but it seems clear that lekta do not map neatly onto\nthe language that express them (Bobzien 2021). This is likely one of\nthe roots of the Stoic interest in ambiguity (on which see Atherton\n1993). Nonetheless, the Stoics identified and classified different\nparts of speech (proper noun, common noun, verb, conjunction, article,\nto which some add mesot\u00eas, which is usually taken to be\nthe participle, though it could be adverbs: Diogenes Laertius 33A,\n33M), each of which appear to express distinct signifieds. Verbs, for\nexample, typically express predicates\n(kat\u00eagor\u00eamata, 33\u039c; see detailed discussion in\nBobzien and Shogry 2020). Whether all parts of speech express\nlekta is unclear. Nouns, for example, may signify the elusive\ncases (pt\u00f4seis), or qualities, or both (Diogenes\nLaertius 33A, 33M, 34K; see Frede 1994a, Gaskin 1997, Bronowski 2019,\nch. 8\u20139).\n\nThe Stoics provide an extensive taxonomy of lekta. They begin\nby dividing them into complete and incomplete. Incomplete\nlekta include predicates, while complete lekta\nappear to be those usually expressed by syntactically complete\nsentences and include wishes, commands, questions, and the\nall-important propositions (axi\u00f4mata), which are\ntypically expressed by declarative sentences.\n3.3 Propositions\n\nPropositions are the only bearers of truth-value and the central\nentity in much of Stoic philosophy of language and logic. Sometimes\nalso translated as \u201cassertibles\u201d, Stoic propositions bear\nsome similarities to the modern proposition, but also some important\ndifferences. Notably, Stoic propositions change truth-value over time,\nso \u201cit is day\u201d is true while it is day, will become false\nwhen it is night, and true again the following day, etc. The Stoics\nalso distinguish different types of propositions on the basis of their\nsubject (Sextus, 34\u0397; Diogenes Laertius, 34\u039a). The major\nthree types of simple affirmative propositions are the definite or\ncategorical, composed of a deictic or demonstrative and a predicate\n(\u201cthis one walks\u201d); the middle or categoreutical, whose\nsubject is expressed by a noun (\u201cSocrates walks\u201d,\n\u201cman sits\u201d); and the indefinite whose subject is expressed\nby an indefinite pronoun (\u201csomeone is sitting\u201d). These\ndifferent types of propositions have different semantic but also\nepistemological properties, as a result of the modes of references of\ntheir subject (Durand 2019). For example, one perhaps surprising\nproperty of the definite is that it can only be said of objects to\nwhich one has successfully referred, so that, for example, the\nproposition \u201cthis one is dead\u201d, can only be said of\nsomething or someone that exists, but is \u201cdestroyed\u201d, that\nis, is no longer a proposition and no longer has a truth-value if and\nwhen the referent ceases to exist. As a result, \u201cthis one is\ndead\u201d can never be said truly, since it would be true only of\nobjects to which reference cannot be fixed deictically. This odd\nfeature is appealed to in the Stoic response to competing accounts of\nmodality\n (3.5).\n\nThe so-called simple propositions can be combined to form complex\npropositions, composed of multiple simple propositions joined by a\nconnective. The Stoics thus developed accounts of the truth-conditions\nof the conjunction (\u201cp and q\u201d),\ndisjunction (\u201cp or q\u201d), which they\ntreated as exclusive, and entered the lively ancient debate over the\ncorrect understanding of conditionals (\u201cif p, then\nq\u201d). (For more on this, see the entry on\n Ancient Logic, section 5.2.)\n They also treated the negation as truth-functional and as negating a\nwhole proposition (\u201cit is not the case that p\u201d:\nAlex. Aphr., in Ar. An. Pr. 402.12\u201319 = FDS 921), which\ncould be applied to simple or complex propositions. The Stoic interest\nin non-simple propositions and their logical relations was shared\nwith, and built upon work by, philosophers in the\n Dialectical School.\n3.4 Syllogistic\n\nArguments themselves are composed of complex propositions, including\nat least two premises and one conclusion (Diogenes Laertius,\n31\u0391). This definition of arguments made the Stoic system one of\nwhat we might now call propositional logic, by contrast with\nAristotle\u2019s logic of terms or predicate logic.\n\nSyllogisms are arguments that take the form of one of the five\nso-called \u201cindemonstrables\u201d, which are axiomatic\narguments, or can be reduced to one by means of one of four rules of\ninference, the themata. The five indemonstrables are familiar\nargument forms presented in the following abbreviated way (Diogenes\nLaertius, 36\u0391, cf. Sextus, M 8.224\u20135, where\n\u201cthe first\u201d and \u201cthe second\u201d are used in place\nof p and q, following standard Stoic practice):\n\nif p then q; p; therefore q\n(modus ponens);\nif p then q; not-q; therefore\nnot-p (modus tollens);\nnot: both p and q; p; therefore\nnot-q;\neither p or q; p; therefore\nnot-q;\neither p or q; not-p; therefore\nq.\n\n\nA syllogism is a valid argument (Diogenes Laertius, 36A), as is any\nargument whose conclusion follows from the premises, that is, in\nChrysippean terms, if the (Chrysippean) conditional formed from its\npremises as antecedent and its conclusion as consequent is true\n(Sextus, 72I; Diogenes Laertius, 36A). An argument is sound (literally\n\u201ctrue\u201d) if it is valid and its premises are true. For more\non the details on Stoic syllogistic, including a reconstruction of the\nthemata, see the entry on\n Ancient Logic sections 5.3\u20134\n and Bobzien 1996.\n3.5 Modality\n\nThe Stoics also contributed to questions about modality, following in\nthe footsteps, indirectly, of\n Aristotle\n and, more directly, of the\n Megarians.\n At the heart of their interest were issues of possibility and\nnecessity tied in part to their commitment to causal determinism.\n\nThese matters primarily came to the fore in discussions of the\nso-called\n Master Argument\n introduced by Diodorus Cronus. The Master Argument itself does not\nsurvive and the details are the subject of debate (cf. e.g. Gaskin\n1995, Denyer 1999). It involved the three apparently inconsistent\nclaims that (i) past truths are necessary, (ii) nothing impossible\nfollows from the possible, and (iii) there is something possible but\ndoes not yet happen (Epictetus, 38A). Just why these claims are\nincompatible is not entirely clear, though the Master Argument\nreportedly worked to establish this result. In response, one had to\ngive up one of the claims. Which one of them one rejects has serious\nimplications for one\u2019s commitments with regards to the notions\nof possibility and necessity. Diodorus Cronus rejected (iii), arguing\nthat what is possible is limited to what either is or will be true at\nsome point in the future (Boethius, 38C). Among the Stoics, Cleanthes\nreportedly rejected (i), while Chrysippus rejected (ii). He argued\nthat the conditional \u201cif Dion is dead, this one is dead\u201d\nis a counterexample, by appealing to the semantics of deictic\nreference and reference failure (Alex. Aphr., 48F, cf. above\n 3.3\n and Durand 2019). This arguably ad hoc argument enables\nChrysippus to retain both the necessity of the past and the thesis\nthat there are things which are possible but do not happen. This in\nturn allows him to introduce a distinction between metaphysical\nnecessity (since all things are fated and pre-determined by antecedent\ncauses, see above\n 2.8)\n and logical necessity (de Harven 2016) at the heart of his\ncompatibilist account. For more on Stoic views on modality, see\nBobzien 1986.\n3.6 Paradoxes\n\nThe Stoics were interested in logical paradoxes and tackled a number\nof them, including the Liar and the Sorites (Chrysippus, 37G; Cicero,\n37H; Plutarch, 37I). The evidence on the solutions they offered is\npoor but suggests a great deal of thought and sophistication. On the\nLiar, see Cavini 1993 and Mignucci 1999. On the Sorites, see Bobzien\n2002 and Vogt 2022. On the so-called Horned One, see Bobzien 2012.\n(These logical paradoxes and the Stoic efforts to solve them should\nnot be confused with the \u201cStoic Paradoxes\u201d discussed by\nCicero in his treatise of the same name; the latter refer to Stoic\ndoctrines in ethics running contrary to common opinion.)\n3.7 Epistemology\n\nThe Stoics develop their epistemological theory as a sub-branch of\nlogic, but here, as in so many other cases, their conclusions lend\nsupport to, and draw on, doctrines in other parts of their\nphilosophical system. Readers should familiarize themselves with the\n Stoic psychological theory\n presented above.\n\nOne central task of Stoic epistemology is to provide an account of\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea). Like Plato and Aristotle,\nthe Stoics conceive of knowledge as the paramount intellectual\nachievement available to human beings and, accordingly, place\ndemanding conditions on its possession. Knowledge, for the Stoics, is\na maximally stable and modally robust grasp of reality, in the sense\nthat if S knows that p, then not only is p\ntrue, but also S will not revise their commitment to\np in response to any degree of dialectical scrutiny that may\nbe applied to S. This requirement is registered in the Stoic\nclaim that knowledge is \u201csecure and unchangeable by\nreason\u201d (Stobaeus, 41H) and seems originally born out of\nreflection on the action of Plato\u2019s Socratic dialogues: whoever\nasserts p but is led to accept not-p \u00adas a\nresult of elenctic cross-examination thereby reveals his own lack of\nknowledge of p (even in cases where p happens to be\ntrue) (Frede 1983).\n\nCrucially, for the Stoics, the immutability characterizing\nS\u2019s knowledge that p does not rest on churlish\nstubbornness in S or on their unquestioning faith in\np, but rather on S\u2019s ability to understand\nwhat makes p true and why the arguments against p,\nif ever they are presented to S, are unsound. This thesis has\ntwo significant consequences. First, to know p requires a\nmastery of a comprehensive suite of dialectical skills, including\n\u201cirrefutability\u201d, i.e. \u201cstrength in argument, so as\nnot to be carried away into the contradictory\u201d (Diogenes\nLaertius, 31B), and a grasp of the canons of formal logic and Stoic\nsyllogistic, in order to distinguish valid from invalid arguments and\ndetect when the latter are offered in favor of not-p. Second,\nknowledge is essentially systematic (Stobaeus, 41H). In knowing\np, S is in a position to appreciate how p\nfits into a larger body of information, both within p\u2019s\ndomain and in other parts of philosophical inquiry. Thus our Stoic\nsources use \u201cknowledge\u201d to pick out both a stable\npsychological condition and a token activity: the knowledge that\np (token activity) is only possible in a mind in which\np has been integrated and organized into a complex unified\nstructure (stable condition) (Vogt 2012, ch. 7; Brennan 2005, ch. 6).\nFor these reasons, the Stoics restrict knowledge to the Sage (Cicero,\n41A; Sextus, 41C). Only the perfected human agent genuinely knows\nanything, because only she possesses the wide-ranging argumentative\nexpertise necessary to defend what she has affirmed against any\npossible challenge, together with a grasp of the further facts that\nexplain its truth.\n\nLike virtue and happiness (see\n 4.2\n below), knowledge does not come in degrees. One\u2019s endorsement\nof p is either maximally stable and unable to be overturned\nthrough rational means, or it is not, and virtue (as we will see) is\nitself analyzed as knowledge of what is good, bad, and neither (cf.\nStobaeus, 61D, 61H). Since virtue is necessary and sufficient for\nhappiness (Diogenes Laertius, 61A), it follows that those lacking\nknowledge will not be happy.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance of knowledge, how can it be acquired?\nAttaining knowledge is exceedingly difficult, the Stoics concede\n\u2013 not even the leaders of the school claimed to have it \u2013\nbut, for all that, still humanly possible.\n\nHere it is useful to consider the Stoics\u2019 three-fold distinction\nbetween knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea), cognition\n(katal\u00eapsis), and ignorance (agnoia) (on which\nChrysippus wrote four books, now lost; Diogenes Laertius, 7.201).\nWhereas knowledge is found only in the Sage, only the non-Sage is\nafflicted by ignorance (Stobaeus, 41G). Knowledge and ignorance are\nthus mutually exclusive conditions. This result also falls out of the\nStoic definition of ignorance, as \u201cchangeable and weak\nassent\u201d (Stobaeus, 41G). The Stoics therefore divide human\nagents into two sharply disjoint categories, the knowledgeable and the\nignorant, with the overwhelming majority of us falling into the latter\ncamp. To account for the move from a condition of ignorance to a\ncondition of knowledge, Zeno introduces a mental state he calls\nkatal\u00eapsis (translated by Long and Sedley as\n\u201ccognition\u201d but elsewhere as \u201cgrasp\u201d or\n\u201capprehension\u201d; in non-technical contexts the Greek word\nconnotes an act of seizing something with the hands).\n\nThe basic idea behind Zeno\u2019s proposal is that, when S\ncognizes (= has katal\u00eapsis of) p, S\nsuccessfully latches on to or grabs hold of a truth, because the\nrelationship between S and p ensures that p\ncannot be false: roughly, the process through which p enters\nS\u2019s mind and the clarity and distinctness with which\np is represented are such as to guarantee p\u2019s\ntruth. Cognition is therefore factive \u2013 there is no cognition of\nfalsehoods \u2013 but not all true judgments amount to cognition, as\nwhen, for instance, one assents to p in a state of\nhallucination or intoxication but p happens to be true\n(Sextus, 40E). Cognition, then, is a mental state characterized in the\nfirst instance by its representational fidelity to the external world\nand not \u2013 as with knowledge and ignorance \u2013 by the\ndisposition of the agent to retain or revise it under varying\ndialectical circumstances. In this sense, cognition is \u201cplaced\nbetween\u201d knowledge and ignorance (Cicero, 41B): it is an\nintellectual achievement shared by both Sages and non-Sages (Sextus,\n41C). This entails, however, that any token cognition that p\nwill count as either knowledge or ignorance, depending on the\ncharacter of the cognizer. The Sage\u2019s cognition that p\nis a piece of knowledge, since it is immutable and systematically\norganized in the manner described above, while the non-Sage\u2019s is\na piece of ignorance (Cicero, 41B), since it is still insecure and\nprone to be abandoned in the face of contrary argumentative pressure\n(Plutarch, 31P; see Shogry 2022). This led the Academic skeptic\nArcesilaus to object that cognition will be an empty category and have\nno independent existence apart from knowledge and ignorance (cf.\nSextus, 41C). But the Stoics have good reasons for presenting their\ntripartite distinction as they do, because they see cognition as the\n\u201cnatural foundation\u201d (or \u201cstarting point\u201d:\nprincipium) for knowledge (Cicero, 41B).\n\nBeginning with Zeno, the Stoics characterize cognition\n(katal\u00eapsis) as an assent to a special kind of\nimpression, one that functions as a criterion of truth and thus\nguarantees its own veridicality: such an impression they call\n\u201ccognitive\u201d (lit. \u201ccognition-prompting\u201d,\nkatal\u00eaptikos) (Sextus, 41C; see also PH 3.241\nand M 8.397). While some scholars simply transliterate this\nlabel as \u201ckataleptic\u201d, Long and Sedley\u2019s translation\nof \u201ccognitive\u201d, whatever its infelicities, helpfully\nreplicates the connection, visible in the Greek, with the outcome of\nassenting to such an impression: \u201ccognition\u201d. (Similarly,\nwhen katal\u00eapsis is translated as \u201cgrasp\u201d or\n\u201capprehension\u201d, we find \u201cgraspable\u201d or\n\u201capprehensive\u201d for katal\u00eaptikos; Cicero\ntranslates the two terms into Latin as comprehensio and\ncomprehendibile, respectively.) So cognition is guaranteed to\nbe true because it is analyzed as an assent to an impression that is\nitself guaranteed to be true: cognitive impressions \u201chave a\npeculiar power of revealing their objects\u201d (Cicero, 40B).\n\nThe existence of cognitive impressions makes cognition possible, and\nknowledge, the Stoics hold, is attained when all of one\u2019s acts\nof assent amount to cognition: the Sage is distinguished from the\nnon-Sage in assenting exclusively to cognitive impressions.\n\u201cAssent iff cognitive\u201d therefore functions as a norm of\nStoic epistemology and sketches a pathway to progress from ignorance\nto knowledge. The Stoics assume that cognition, especially of\nperceptual facts, is commonplace and regularly achieved by the\nnon-Sage, and so that on these occasions there is no great obstacle to\nobeying the norm. For instance, ordinary agents regularly entertain\nand accept the cognitive impression that \u201cit is day\u201d when\nstanding in a sunny field at noon. But other cases present greater\nchallenges, such that the non-Sage will assent to an impression that\nfails to be cognitive and thus infect their mind with\n\u201copinion\u201d (doxa) (Plutarch, 41E). By contrast,\nthe Sage is entirely free of opinion, since she withholds assent on\nany impression that is non-cognitive (Stobaeus, 41G). (Scholars\ndispute the status of opinion in Stoic epistemology, but on one\nwell-attested usage doxa is the label used specifically for\nthe non-Sage\u2019s acts of assent to non-cognitive impressions; for\nan alternative view, on which opinion is identical to ignorance, see\nMeinwald 2005 and Vogt 2012, ch. 7.)\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, the Stoics expend no small effort explaining\nwhat distinguishes cognitive and non-cognitive impressions. Zeno\neventually settled on the following three-clause definition of the\ncognitive impression, which was retained throughout the history of the\nschool. According to the Stoics, \u201ca cognitive impression is one\nwhich:\n\narises from what is, and\nis stamped and impressed exactly in accordance with what is,\nof such a kind as could not arise from what is not.\u201d\n(Sextus, 40E)\n\n\nThese three clauses are construed by the Stoics as providing\nindividually-necessary and jointly-sufficient conditions for an\nimpression to be cognitive (Nawar 2014). Together, they are supposed\nto capture the feature(s) shared by all and only cognitive\nimpressions, in virtue of which they serve as criteria of truth\n(Diogenes Laertius, 40A). However, their precise interpretation\nremains highly controversial.\n\nOne longstanding dispute concerns the meaning of \u201cwhat is\u201d\nas it features in clause (1): is it to be understood\nexistentially or veridically? On the existential\ninterpretation, \u201cwhat is\u201d refers to a being or real\nobject, so that clause (1) requires the cognitive impression to be\ncaused by (\u201carise from\u201d) an existing object in the\nexternal world. So construed, clause (1) rules out cases where an\nimpression is formed solely through the activity of the mind (e.g. in\na hallucinatory episode). However, this reading has been challenged on\nboth textual and philosophical grounds. Textually, the Greek phrase\ntranslated by Long and Sedley as \u201cwhat is\u201d does not use a\nform of \u201cto be\u201d (einai) but rather a different,\ntechnical expression: \u201cto obtain\u201d (huparchein).\nAccording to Stoic metaphysics (see above,\n 2.1),\n only bodies \u201care\u201d or \u201cexist\u201d\n(einai), and so if clause (1) were intended to refer\nspecifically to external objects (bodies), we would expect a form of\neinai, not huparchein. Philosophically, the\nexistential reading implies there are only cognitive impressions of\nbodies. However, the Stoics acknowledge the possibility of cognition\nconcerning incorporeal propositions, for instance, truths about the\nnature of the gods (Diogenes Laertius, 40P), and insofar as cognition\nconsists in an assent to a cognitive impression, there should be\ncognitive impressions of these true incorporeal propositions as well.\n(On this issue, see Schwab forthcoming, and the recent exchange\nbetween Vogt 2022 and Nawar 2022.) The veridical interpretation points\nto a resolution of both these difficulties. On this reading,\n\u201cwhat is\u201d picks out a true proposition, in line with the\nStoic claim that true propositions \u201cobtain\u201d rather than\n\u201cexist\u201d (cf. Sextus, 34D) and with further evidence in\nCicero (cf. 40I and Acad. 2.112). Thus clause (1) amounts to\na veridicality requirement: all cognitive impressions must be true.\nMoreover, a veridical reading of clause (1) would also seem to allow\nfor the possibility that there are cognitive impressions of true\npropositions, though this point is controversial: see Sedley 2002 and\nNawar 2014. For an effort to rehabilitate a version of the existential\nreading, see Stojanovi\u0107 2019 and Caston forthcoming.\n\nThe major debate over clause (2) turns on whether it serves to\ncharacterize the cognitive impression\u2019s phenomenological\ncharacter, causal history, or both, and one\u2019s stance on this\nquestion affects one\u2019s interpretation of clause (3) in turn.\nBoth Cicero and Sextus report that clause (3) was added by Zeno to an\nearlier definition consisting just of clauses (1) and (2) (40D, E),\nand the grammar of clause (3) itself suggests it should be read as a\nfurther elucidation of clause (2). According to what has come to be\ncalled the \u201cinternalist\u201d interpretation, clause (2)\nrequires that the cognitive impression display a unique level of\nclarity and phenomenological sharpness, which is lacking in any false\nimpression (clause (3)) (Sedley 2002). By contrast, on the\n\u201cexternalist\u201d reading, clause (2) stipulates that the\ncognitive impression is appropriately caused, i.e. \u201cexactly in\naccordance with\u201d the fact it represents and not any other,\nwithout speaking to its phenomenological qualities: the causal link\nbetween the cognitive impression and its object is \u201cof such a\nkind as\u201d no false impression will possess (clause (3)) (Frede\n1983; for the viability of this interpretation, see the exchange\nbetween Perin 2005 and Shogry 2018). A \u201chybrid\u201d view reads\nclauses (2) and (3) as stating that the cognitive impression enjoys\nmaximal phenomenological clarity because it is caused in the\nappropriate way, i.e. by the state-of-affairs it represents and no\nother (Nawar 2014; cf. Frede 1999).\n\nFrom its initial formulation by Zeno, the Stoic account of the\ncognitive impression was fiercely contested by the school\u2019s\nskeptical opponents, provoking a centuries-long debate over its\ntenability (Annas 1990). Academic skeptics, such as Arcesilaus and\nCarneades, argued that no impression could meet all three clauses of\nZeno\u2019s definition (40 H, J), with the result that cognition, as\nthe Stoics conceive of it, is impossible, since cognitive impressions\ndo not exist. For discussion of these Academic arguments, see the\nentries on\n Ancient Skepticism,\n Arcesilaus,\n Carneades,\n and\n Philo of Larissa.\n Sextus Empiricus presents a number of further arguments devised by\nPyrrhonian skeptics to show that cognitive impressions cannot serve as\ncriteria of truth.\n\nFor helpful comments on the relation in Stoicism between reasonable\nimpressions and cognitive impressions, see Brennan 1996 (with Diogenes\nLaertius, 40F). For articles exploring the influence of Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus on the development of the Stoic account of the\ncognitive impression, see Shogry 2021 and Long 2002.\n4. Ethics\n\nStoic ethics is eudaimonist in structure, in the sense that it posits\nhappiness (eudaimonia) \u2013 a well-lived, flourishing life\n\u2013 as the rational agent\u2019s ultimate practical goal or end\n(telos). Thus the Stoics characterize happiness as \u201cthe\nend, for the sake of which everything is done, but which is not itself\ndone for the sake of anything\u201d else (Stobaeus, 63A). This core\neudaimonist thesis is shared by the Epicureans, Peripatetics, and\nother philosophical schools contemporary with the Stoics, and is\nregarded as an uncontroversial starting-point for further ethical\nreflection and theorizing (Annas 1993). Every human agent, it is\nassumed, wants nothing more than to live a flourishing, happy life and\ntherefore arranges their own projects and efforts according to what\nthey think will accomplish this goal. Unfortunately, however, most\nhuman beings are mistaken about what will in fact make them happy.\nRegardless of what they themselves might say about the value and\nsuccess of their lives, most humans, according to the Stoics, hold\nfalse opinions about what their happiness consists in, i.e. false\nopinions about what is good. In the eudaimonist framework in which\nStoic ethics is articulated, to claim that x is good (or a\ngood) is to claim that x is a constituent or causal source of\nhappiness. Stoic ethical theory therefore aims to provide an account\nof what really is good and what really brings\nhappiness to a human being, so that we can guide our lives\naccordingly. In this respect, the Stoics\u2019 aims are continuous\nwith those of the Epicureans, Peripatetics, and other rival ethical\nschools, but the eudaimonist philosophers of the Hellenistic and Roman\nperiods put forward different accounts of what human happiness\ngenuinely consists in, so that it became standard practice among\nancient writers to distinguish each school by its view of \u201cthe\nhighest good\u201d (summum bonum) and \u201cthe end\u201d\n(telos / finis) (cf. the title of Cicero\u2019s\ntreatise, De Finibus).\n4.1 The Telos\n\nWhat, then, is the Stoic account of the end? How do they describe the\nkind of activity in which human happiness consists?\n\n\nZeno represented the end as: \u2018living in agreement\u2019. This\nis living in accordance with one concordant reason, since those who\nlive in conflict are unhappy... Cleanthes, [Zeno\u2019s] first\nsuccessor, added \u2018with nature\u2019, and represented it as\nfollows: \u2018the end is living in agreement with nature\u2019.\n(Stobaeus, 63B)\n\n\nAlthough our Stoic sources record a number of further descriptions of\nthe telos, some of which we will consider below, the\nformulation attributed in this passage to Cleanthes (and elsewhere to\nZeno himself, see Diogenes Laertius 63C) \u2013 \u201cliving in\nagreement with nature\u201d \u2013 offers a convenient entry-point\ninto the Stoic ethical system.\n\nOne feature of the happy life brought out by Zeno\u2019s shorter\nformulation \u2013 \u201cliving in agreement\u201d \u2013 is\nagreement with oneself. The flourishing human being is free\nof both internal psychological division and vacillation in her\npractical commitments and priorities, such that she enjoys \u201ca\ngood flow of life\u201d (Stobaeus, 63A). In characterizing the\nflourishing life as one which adheres to \u201cone concordant\nreason\u201d (Stobaeus, 63B), i.e. one coherent practical outlook\nthat is never at odds with itself or discordant over time, Zeno\nrespects what is arguably a basic intuition about human happiness\n(Cooper 2012; cf. Aristotle, Nic. Eth. 1.4,\n1095a22\u201326).\n\nWith the longer formulation, the Stoics underscore their commitment to\na bolder thesis, that, in living with agreement with herself, the\nhappy agent is also living in agreement with nature and so with the\ncosmos as a whole:\n\n\nTherefore, living in agreement with nature comes to be the end, which\nis in accordance with the nature of oneself and that of the whole,\nengaging in no activity wont to be forbidden by the universal law,\nwhich is the right reason pervading everything and identical to Zeus,\nwho is this director of the administration of existing things.\n(Diogenes Laertius, 63C)\n\n\nAs we saw above\n (2.7)\n in the context of Stoic physics \u2013 i.e. the study of nature\n\u2013 God or Zeus is identified with the active principle of the\nuniverse, the corporeal mind present everywhere within it, structuring\nand shaping the underlying matter according to an all-encompassing,\nperfectly rational plan. For a human being to live \u201cin\nagreement\u201d (homologoumen\u00f4s) with cosmic nature\ntherefore requires attuning her own reason (logos) with that\nof the whole, by thinking the same thoughts about her situation and\ncircumstances as does Zeus in governing the portion of the world she\noccupies (Cooper 2012). In this way, the flourishing agent lives in\nconformity \u201cwith the will of the administrator as the\nwhole\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 63C).\n4.2 Virtue\n\nTo bring our mind into this state of agreement and achieve the\ntelos, the Stoics argue that only one thing is needed:\nvirtue. Virtue is the perfected condition of human reason (Seneca,\n63D), or \u201ca soul which has been fashioned to achieve consistency\n[or agreement, homologia] in the whole of life\u201d\n(Diogenes Laertius, 61A). Having developed her own power of reason to\nits fullest extent, the virtuous agent not only lives a life that is\nthe highest expression of human nature \u2013 the best possible\ncondition for a human being to be in, given the kind of creature we\nare \u2013 but also replicates in herself the condition of the divine\n(Seneca, 60H; Plutarch, 61J). To live virtuously is therefore to live\nin agreement with both human nature and cosmic or divine nature at\nonce (Chrysippus in Diogenes Laertius, 63C).\n\nSince virtue is the perfection of human rationality, and knowledge is\nthe highest rational achievement open to us, it is unsurprising that\nthe Stoics identify the virtues as forms of knowledge. The virtue of\ncourage, for instance, just is knowledge of what should be endured and\nfeared, and the Stoics argue that this virtue is inseparable from all\nthe rest: whoever has one virtue has them all (61B-H; see Schofield\n1984). Thus the knowledge that constitutes courage entails a\nsystematic grasp of further topics in ethics (e.g. of what should be\ndone and what is choiceworthy, the provinces of prudence and\nmoderation, respectively) and also, remarkably, of the truths of logic\nand physics as well (Cooper 1999a, Menn 1995; for an alternative view,\nsee Annas 1993). One cannot genuinely know (e.g.) what should be\nendured or feared without also knowing how knowledge itself is\nacquired (a topic in logic) and how nature operates in both human\nbeings and the cosmos at large (a topic in physics). The knowledge\nthat makes up virtue therefore ranges beyond the narrowly ethical, and\nsince knowledge is an all-or-nothing affair, so too is virtue\n(Plutarch, 61T). For the Stoics, comprehensive knowledge of reality\n(including but not limited to moral facts) is what is necessary and\nsufficient to live in agreement with nature and be happy.\n4.3 Indifferents\n\nThis sketch of Stoic eudaimonism allows us to better appreciate two of\ntheir most contentious ethical doctrines: (1) human happiness is fully\nin our power and (2) virtue is the only good.\n\nRecall that, for the Stoics, the possession of knowledge depends\nsolely on the agent\u2019s acts of assent, and all acts of assent are\nin the agent\u2019s power (see above,\n 2.8\n and\n 2.9).\n So if virtue is knowledge and both necessary and sufficient for\nhappiness, it follows that happiness will also be in the agent\u2019s\npower and entirely up to them.\n\nLet us grant for the sake of argument that virtue and knowledge are in\nthe agent\u2019s power. Even so, one might object that it is\nimpossible to be happy in the midst of grave misfortune and material\ndeprivation: a terminally ill patient racked with pain, impoverished\nfrom medical bills, and reviled by all of society cannot be happy,\neven if he is virtuous. This intuitive thought led Academic and\nPeripatetic philosophers working in the eudaimonist tradition to argue\nthat, while virtue is necessary for happiness, it is not sufficient,\nor to recognize different degrees of happiness and hold that, while\nvirtue is necessary and sufficient for a minimal amount of happiness,\nit does not suffice for full or maximal happiness (cf. Cicero, De\nFinibus 5.77; Seneca, Moral Letters 85.18\u201323). On these\nviews, some things other than virtue and lying outside the\nagent\u2019s power \u2013 i.e. his share of \u201cexternal\ngoods\u201d \u2013 will make a difference to his happiness.\n\nThe Stoics reject such approaches:\n\n\nThey [the Stoics] say that some existing things are good, others are\nbad, and others are neither of these. The virtues \u2013 prudence,\njustice, courage, moderation and the rest \u2013 are good. The\nopposites of these \u2013 foolishness, injustice and the rest \u2013\nare bad. Everything which neither does benefit nor harms is neither of\nthese: for instance, life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth,\nreputation, noble birth, and their opposites, death, disease, pain,\nugliness, weakness, poverty, low repute, ignoble birth and the like.\nFor just as heating, not chilling is the peculiar characteristic of\nwhat is hot, so too benefiting, not harming is the peculiar\ncharacteristic of what is good. But wealth and health no more do\nbenefit than they harm. Therefore wealth and health are not something\ngood. (Diogenes Laertius, 58A)\n\n\nIn sharp contrast with eudaimonist theories which regard health,\nwealth, reputation, etc. as \u201cexternal goods\u201d, the Stoics\nmaintain that such items are neither good nor bad and, thus,\n\u201cindifferent\u201d (adiaphora /\nindifferentia) to human happiness. To establish this\nconclusion, the Stoics do not rely on the claim that wealth, for\ninstance, sometimes benefits and sometimes harms the\nagent. Instead, the Stoic position is that wealth \u201cneither does\nbenefit nor harms\u201d: in no case is a human life ever made better\nor worse by the possession or deprivation of wealth (or health or\nreputation etc.). Just as what is hot necessarily provides heat, so\ntoo what is good necessarily provides benefit (cf. Sextus, 60G). The\nStoics\u2019 fundamental axiological thesis, then, is that only\nvirtue benefits a human being and makes our lives go well, so only\nvirtue is good.\n\nThe Greek Stoics were prolific in crafting arguments in support of\nthis thesis, a number of which survive in our sources (e.g. Cicero,\n60N; see also Seneca, Moral Letters 82, 85, and 87). Among\nother strategies, Chrysippus appealed to his account of human nature\nto show that only virtue is good, arguing that human nature is such\nthat only the perfection of reason is genuinely beneficial to us (cf.\nCicero, 64K and Brennan 2009; see also Klein 2016). In any event, the\nStoics fully embrace the conclusion that Aristotle considers too big a\nbullet to bite (cf. Nic. Eth. 1.5, 1095b33\u20131096a2):\nthey maintain that, even while being tortured on the rack, his body\nmutilated and searing with pain, and isolated from all his family and\nfriends, the virtuous person is maximally happy (Cicero, De\nFinibus 3.42). Indeed, according to the Stoics, he is equally\nhappy as he was before the torture began, since at both times he\npossesses the one thing that is really beneficial \u2013 virtue\n\u2013 despite having a different share of indifferents (physical\npain, health, etc.). Human happiness therefore does not come in\ndegrees, on the Stoic view. Provided that the agent is virtuous (and\nregardless of how long she continues to possess virtue:\nCicero, De Finibus 3.45\u20137), nothing external will\ndetract from or add to her personal flourishing.\n\nWith respect to their contribution to happiness, then, all\nindifferents are on a par (Diogenes Laertius, 58B). From this bracing\nthesis, one might be tempted to infer that there is no reason to exert\noneself in the pursuit of one type of indifferent (e.g. health) over\nits opposite (e.g. disease). While some marginal figures in\nZeno\u2019s circle endorsed this kind of absolute equality of\nindifferents, such a position was explicitly rejected by Chrysippus,\nand it did not become Stoic orthodoxy (Cicero, 58I; cf. Sextus, 58F).\nInstead, the mainstream Stoic view is that some indifferents \u2013\nsuch as health, wealth, and reputation \u2013 are of a promoted or\npreferred type (pro\u00eagmena / praeposita), have\nvalue (axia / aestimatio), and are according to\nnature (kata phusin / secundum naturam), such that\nis appropriate or dutiful or one\u2019s proper function\n(kath\u00eakon / officium) to select them over\ntheir opposites in normal circumstances (Cicero, 59D; Stobaeus 58C-E).\nFor this reason, the virtuous agent will typically pursue (e.g.)\nhealth and undertake the further steps needed to obtain it (e.g. eat\nsalad, exercise, etc.), even though her successful acquisition of\nhealth \u2013 her actually being healthy rather than unhealthy\n\u2013 makes no difference to her happiness and is neither good nor\nbad. The virtuous agent is therefore not lackadaisical in her attitude\ntoward indifferents, according to the orthodox Stoic account, but\nrather energetic and conscientious in her pursuit of those which are\npreferred, valuable, and according to nature: her general policy will\nbe to select these and reject their opposites.\n\nThe Stoics\u2019 ancient critics replied that this doctrine was\nincoherent, even confused, and it is indeed difficult to see how\nsomething could be both indifferent to our happiness and nevertheless\nrational to care about and pursue. The ancient critique of the Stoic\naccount of indifferents can be formulated as a dilemma (cf. Plutarch,\n64C; Cicero, 64F, L; see Klein 2015, Barney 2003). According to these\ncritics, there are just two ways the Stoics can explain why we should\npursue health, wealth, and other preferred indifferents, both of which\nleading to self-contradiction: either (i) these items really are good\nand directly or indirectly contribute to human happiness, or (ii)\nhappiness is not the ultimate practical goal. Option (i) makes the\npursuit of these items intelligible, on the grounds that possessing\nthem is good for human beings and happiness-affecting, but is\ninconsistent with the Stoic claim that only virtue is good. On this\noption, \u201cpreferred indifferents\u201d turn out to be external\ngoods by another name. Option (ii) respects the Stoic insistence that\nthese items are genuinely indifferent to our happiness, but sacrifices\nthe bedrock eudaimonist thesis that happiness is \u201cthe end, for\nthe sake of which everything is done\u201d (Stobaeus, 63A). On option\n(ii), indifferents are pursued for the sake of a goal independent\nfrom, and standing outside of, the agent\u2019s own happiness, but\nthis result is one that no eudaimonist school can consistently\naccept.\n\nWhether the Stoic account is ultimately impaled on these two horns\nremains the subject of ongoing scholarly debate. However, the\nepistemic interpretation of Stoic indifferents \u2013 first sketched\nby Cooper 1999a and Brennan 2005 but authoritatively presented in\nKlein 2015 \u2013 deserves further consideration here, as a promising\nattempt to rescue the Stoics from the dilemma. On this interpretation,\nthe agent is justified in selecting (e.g.) health over its contrary\nindifferent, illness, not because health is itself good or because\nthere is some happiness-independent reason to be healthy as opposed to\nsick, but instead because, for finite agents like us, who lack\nknowledge of future events, selecting promoted indifferents over their\nopposites is generally the most epistemically responsible way of\nfollowing the will of Zeus (cf. Chrysippus in Epictetus, 58J).\n\nRecall that the telos is standardly specified as\n\u201cliving in agreement with nature\u201d. Chrysippus holds that\nthis formulation is equivalent to \u201cliving in accordance with\nexperience of what happens by nature\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 63C).\nAccording to Diogenes of Babylon, the telos can also be\ndescribed as \u201creasoning well in the selection and dis-selection\nof things in accordance with nature\u201d (Stobaeus, 58K).\nDiogenes\u2019 formulation suggests that the correct\nselection of indifferents makes a positive contribution to\nhuman happiness, even though their possession does not.\nMoreover, the Stoics think that a selection can be correct even if\nZeus decides not to produce the indifferent that the agent pursues:\nlike excellent dancing, virtuous selection of indifferents does not\nrequire the acquisition of any object external to the agent in order\nto count as successful (Cicero, 64H). So, on the epistemic\ninterpretation, when the virtuous agent selects health over illness,\nshe does not act for the sake of obtaining health, as if being healthy\nrather than sick would make a difference to her flourishing, but\ninstead because pursuing health on this occasion reflects her\n\u201cexperience of what happens by nature\u201d and follows upon\nher best assessment of what conformity to Zeus\u2019 providential\ncosmic plan requires of her in this instance. (See Stobaeus 65Q, with\ndiscussion in Inwood 1985, ch. 5, and Brennan 2000, for the\n\u201creservations\u201d included in the Sage\u2019s selections of\nindifferents.)\n4.4 Deliberation\n\nSo far, for ease of exposition, we have focused on a simplified case\nin which an agent deliberates over whether to select one preferred\nindifferent over its opposite. But for the Stoics the typical case of\ndeliberation is much more complicated, with more than one agent and\nmore than one kind of indifferent at stake, so that it may not be\nimmediately obvious what the appropriate action or proper function is\nin a given scenario. However, since failing to perform one\u2019s\nproper function is incompatible with living in agreement with nature\n(Stobaeus, 59I; Diogenes Laertius, 59J), it is incumbent upon the\nStoic theorist to assist ordinary agents and moral progressors in\ntheir deliberation in these cases. To this end, the Greek Stoics\ncomposed works On Proper Functions (Peri\nKath\u00eakont\u00f4n), with Panaetius\u2019 forming the basis\nof Cicero\u2019s treatise of the same name (De Officiis).\nThe main assumption guiding these Stoic works is that indifferents\nserve as the subject-matter or raw material of virtue (Plutarch, 59A):\nthe virtuous agent must impartially weigh indifferent against\nindifferent when deliberating over what to do. For the Stoics, justice\nrequires distributing the right amount of indifferents to each person\n(cf. Plutarch, 61C and Stobaeus, 61H), and in some cases the just\nagent will select a dispreferred indifferent for herself, in order to\nallocate a greater amount of preferred indifferents to others. Since\nbeing alive is itself a preferred indifferent, there are cases when\none\u2019s proper function is to sacrifice one\u2019s own life (e.g.\nto save others fleeing the battlefield or to avoid large amounts of\nfuture pain and disease) (Cicero, 66G; Diogenes Laertius, 66H).\nAlthough it might be tempting to attribute to the Stoics a simple\nmaximization rule, on which one\u2019s proper function just is to\nmaximize the net amount of preferred indifferents for the most agents,\nour evidence points against the idea that the Stoics accepted any one\nsingle principle for determining what one\u2019s proper function is\nin a given scenario (see Brennan 2005, chs. 11\u201313, and the\nexchange between Inwood 1999 and Striker 1987; for defeasible\nguidelines or rules of thumb that may assist the ordinary agent in\nfinding what is appropriate, see e.g. Seneca, Moral Letters\n94 and 95).\n4.5 Stoic Cosmopolitanism\n\nHow far do the demands of justice extend? To all\nhuman-beings, the Stoics insist (Plutarch, 67A; Cicero, 57F;\nHierocles, 57G; Anonymous Commentary, 57H). In virtue of our shared\nrationality, all human beings, together with Zeus, make up the\ncitizenry of one universal city or cosmopolis (Marcus Aurelius, 4.4;\nArius Didymus, 67L). The just agent therefore looks beyond her\nimmediate physical proximity and conventional political community when\ndistributing indifferents and takes the interests of every human being\n\u2013 even the \u201cmost distant Mysian\u201d (Anonymous\nCommentary, 57H) \u2013 into account.\n\nOne motivation for characterizing the cosmos as a kind of city is\nStoic thinking on law, which in turn draws on wider tenets of their\nphysical and ethical theory. According to the Stoics, to live in\nagreement with nature and achieve the human telos involves\n\u201cengaging in no activity wont to be forbidden by the universal\nlaw (ho nomos ho koinos), which is the right reason pervading\neverything and identical to Zeus\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 63C; cited\nabove,\n 4.1).\n The providential activity of Zeus in administering the cosmos thus\nserves as universal law, setting a perfectly\nrational standard for human beings to follow and emulate (Marcian,\n67R). So, since \u201ca city is a group of people living in the same\nplace and administered by law\u201d (Dio Chrysostom, 67J), and all\nhuman beings are bound by the universal law of Zeus \u2013 a law that\nis \u201cdiffused over everyone, consistent, everlasting\u201d\n(Cicero, 67S) \u2013 it follows that the cosmos is a kind of a\ncity.\n\nFor further details of Stoic cosmopolitanism, see Vogt 2008, Schofield\n1991, and the entries on\n Ancient Political Philosophy\n and\n Cosmopolitanism.\n4.6 Oikei\u00f4sis\n\nTo support their account of cosmopolitan justice and their fundamental\naxiological thesis that only virtue is good, the Stoics rely on their\ndoctrine of oikei\u00f4sis (\u201cappropriation\u201d or\n\u201caffiliation\u201d; the Greek term suggests a process whereby\nobjects come to be recognized as oikeion \u2013 as\n\u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201caffiliated\u201d or\n\u201cbelonging\u201d to the creature in question). This doctrine\nbegins with the observation that, straight from birth, every creature\nseeks to preserve its own constitution, even when this is painful\n(Diogenes Laertius, 57A; Seneca, 57B): its own constitution is thus\nthe first thing each creature sees as oikeion to it and,\nhence, as an object of concern. This is because each animal is born\nwith a capacity for self-perception, which enables it to detect, among\nother things, what is appropriate or harmful to its constitution, and\na capacity for impulse, which enables it to pursue or avoid objects\naccordingly (Hierocles, 57C). So, to use Seneca\u2019s example, a\nturtle that has fallen on its back perceives that this situation is\nunfavorable to its constitution and forms an impulse to right itself.\nMoreover, the turtle does all this by nature, without having been\ntrained to do so, showing that non-rational creatures are set-up by\nprovidential nature to perceive what is needed for their own\nteleological success and to act appropriately in pursuit of this goal.\nNewborn infants and children are no exception: as we saw above\n (2.9),\n humans are not born with reason but rather acquire it later in life,\nso that prior to maturing into adults we employ a non-rational soul\nand pursue the objects appropriate for a constitution of this kind.\nThe transition into adulthood comes when \u201creason supervenes as\nthe craftsman of impulse\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 57A), i.e., when\nwe acquire a rational nature and begin to form \u201crational\nimpulses\u201d (Stobaeus, 53Q). The Stoics maintain that the rational\nconstitution of a mature adult differs from that of a non-rational\nchild (Seneca, 57B), and so too the things favorable to it.\nFurthermore, adding a social dimension to the theory of\noikei\u00f4sis, the Stoics observe that humans, like members\nof certain animal species (bees, ants, etc.), naturally cooperate with\none another, and, in general, \u201cit could not be consistent for\nnature both to desire the production of offspring and not to be\nconcerned that offspring should be loved\u201d (Cicero, 57F).\nHowever, it is not exactly clear how these various observations are\nsupposed to offer support for the Stoics\u2019 ethical commitments.\nScholarly debate has focused on three main issues. First, how, if at\nall, are these apparently descriptive claims able to provide any\nnormative guidance? Second, how could a natural disposition toward\nself-preservation underwrite the other-regarding demands of\ncosmopolitan justice? Third, in what ways, if any, is a non-rational\ncreature\u2019s pursuit of food, shelter, and other things favorable\nto their non-rational constitution analogous to the Sage\u2019s\nattachment to virtue as the sole good? It is worth noting that one of\nour main sources on oikei\u00f4sis concludes with an account\nof the ideal agent\u2019s development, culminating in her\nappreciation that consistency [or agreement, homologia] and\nharmony of conduct is the only true source of benefit in a human life\n(Cicero, 59D). Magrin 2018 and Klein 2016 take up these issues with\nadmirable clarity and should be consulted for further details; they\nalso provide an up-to-date bibliography on this wide-ranging\ntopic.\n4.7 Passions\n\nThe Stoics famously argue that the virtuous agent feels no passions\n(path\u00ea) and, so, that the happy life is entirely\npassion-free (apath\u00eas). To better understand this\nstriking and notorious claim, let us examine how they define the\npassions:\n\n\nThey [the Stoics] say that passion is impulse which is excessive and\ndisobedient to the dictates of reason, or a movement of soul which is\nirrational and contrary to nature; and that all passions belong to the\nsoul\u2019s commanding-faculty. (Stobaeus, 65A)\n\n\nNotice that all passions are impulses (hormai) of a certain\nkind, i.e. psychological events directly prefiguring action, which\n\u201cbelong to the soul\u2019s commanding-faculty\u201d. This\nimplies that all passions are \u201crational impulses\u201d, in the\nStoic scheme (Stobaeus, 53Q), insofar as they are created through the\nexercise of the agent\u2019s rational mind (his\n\u201ccommanding-faculty\u201d), specifically, through an act of\nassent (see\n 2.9\n above). Passions are therefore \u201cirrational\u201d and\n\u201cdisobedient to the dictates of reason\u201d not because they\narise in some part of the mind that lacks reason (like Plato\u2019s\nspirit or appetite), for the Stoics deny that the human mind has any\nnon-rational parts. In what sense, then, do the passions disobey the\ndictates of reason and count as irrational?\n\nOne answer is that, in undergoing a passion, the agent disobeys\nright reason, i.e. the rationality of the cosmos or the\nuniversal law of Zeus. To suffer a passion is to be in conflict with\nnature \u2013 to experience \u201cfluttering\u201d rather than the\n\u201cgood flow\u201d of the happy person (Stobaeus, 65A; cf.\nStobaeus, 63A) \u2013 and is therefore a vicious action par\nexcellence, one that frustrates the agent\u2019s progress\ntowards the telos. To see why, we need to introduce further\naspects of the Stoic account of passions.\n\nInsofar as each passion follows upon the agent\u2019s act of assent,\nit is amenable to a cognitivist analysis. According to the Stoics,\neach passion can be described as an opinion or judgment or weak\nsupposition (65B-D), whose content includes two elements, both of\nwhich (in the standard case) are false: (i) an ascription of value to\nan object that is present or in prospect and (ii) an assessment that a\nparticular course of action is appropriate to perform in response\n(Graver 2007, ch. 2; Brennan 2005, ch. 7; Inwood 1985, ch. 5). In\nstandard cases, (i) is false because the passionate agent mistakes\nsomething he currently possesses or expects to possess as either good\nor bad, when really it is indifferent. So, for instance, the distress\nI feel in learning that I have heart disease involves my mind\u2019s\nassent to the proposition that illness is both present and something\nbad \u2013 where \u201cbad\u201d carries the eudaimonist\nconnotation of being deleterious to my happiness (Cooper 1999b). This\nthought is false, of course: disease is dis-preferred, but not bad,\nand its presence makes no difference to my happiness. My case of\ndistress, then, involves a cognitive failure, according to the Stoics:\nin suffering this passion, I have incorrectly evaluated illness and\nmisjudged its connection to my own personal flourishing. As part of my\ndistress, I may also experience anxious internal constricting and\nstart to weep, as a result of my mind\u2019s assessment that such\nactions are appropriate responses to my present illness (element (ii)\nabove). On the Stoic view, this assessment is also false, for these\nare not objectively appropriate reactions to the presence of something\nbad (cf. the more complicated Alcibiades case, discussed by Graver\n2007, ch. 9).\n\nDistress is one of four main types or genera of passion recognized by\nthe Stoics. Each type is distinguished by the character of its\nintentional object: distress, a present perceived bad; fear, a future\nperceived bad; appetite, a future perceived good; delight (or\npleasure), a present perceived good. Appetite and fear are primary,\nwith distress and delight secondary (Stobaeus, 65A). What is common in\nall four genera, however, is a cognitive mistake on the part of the\nagent concerning the value of the intentional object or concerning the\nappropriate behavioral response \u2013 an epistemic failure that is\nincompatible with living in agreement with nature. This is one\nimportant upshot of Chrysippus\u2019 runner analogy (in Galen, 65J).\nJust as a runner moves in such a way that he is \u201ccarried\naway\u201d and cannot immediately come to a halt, so the passionate\nagent acts on impulses \u201cgoing beyond the rational\nproportion\u201d, i.e. contrary to the right reason of Zeus (Inwood\n1985). However, some commentators see the runner analogy as gesturing\nat a sense in which, for Chrysippus, the passionate agent disobeys her\nown reason as well (Graver 2007, ch. 3). If so, then perhaps\nthe Chrysippean theory can recognize some form of occurrent mental\nconflict after all, although the details of such an interpretation\nhave not yet been worked out.\n\nScholars are divided on how exactly to understand Posidonius\u2019\nreaction to the Chrysippean account of the passions. From the verbatim\nremarks and paraphrases in Galen (65K, M, P, Q), it seems clear that\nPosidonius considered some elements of the Chrysippean account\ninadequate, but whether Posidonius chose merely to emphasize different\naspects of that account, without substantially revising it, or instead\nintended to modify some of its tenets, remains the subject of debate:\nsee Lorenz 2011 and Cooper 1999b.\n\nIn characterizing the ideal human agent as passion-free, what exactly\nare the Stoics denying to her? One might suppose that this ideal\nimplies the eradication of all emotional feelings whatsoever, but the\nStoic account of the virtuous person\u2019s \u201cgood\nfeelings\u201d (eupatheiai) belies the caricature of the\nSage as an unfeeling robot (Diogenes Laertius, 65F). Whereas passions\nare typically directed at indifferents incorrectly judged to be good\nor bad, the Sage\u2019s good feelings are emotional responses to\ngenuine goods, i.e. to virtue, virtuous actions, and virtuous friends\n(see Graver 2007, ch. 2, and Cooper 2005). Moreover, at some point in\nthe school\u2019s history, the Stoics introduced a category of\nfeelings called \u201cpre-emotions\u201d (propatheiai),\nemotional reactions that occur without the intervention of assent and\nso able to be experienced by the Sage without compromising the\nknowledge in which her virtue consists (Gellius, 65Y; for discussion,\nsee Graver 2007, ch. 4).\n5. Influence\n5.1 On Grammatical Writers\n\nWhether \u201cgrammar\u201d was properly speaking a subdiscipline of\nStoic philosophy is debated, but it is generally agreed that Stoic\nphilosophy of language heavily influenced the works of Ancient\nGrammarians. There had long been interest in the study of language,\nbut the Stoics, and Chrysippus chief among them, with their systematic\nstudy of language, are considered by many to have laid the foundations\nfor what became the independent discipline of technical grammar. The\nStoic influence can be traced in various works, and Stoic views\n(sometimes attributed to \u201cthe philosophers\u201d) are\nexplicitly discussed in Scholia, especially to Dionysius Thrax\u2019s\nArt of Grammar. More notably, a debt to the Stoics is\nacknowledged by Apollonius Dyscolus, a highly influential second\ncentury CE Greek grammarian, one of the earliest grammarians for whom\nwe have extant works. Stoic influences can similarly be found in\nPriscian, a Latin grammarian of the 6th century CE living in\nConstantinople, whose Institutiones Grammaticae, in part\nbased on Apollonius Dyscolus\u2019 work, provided much of the\nfoundation for medieval grammar. The extent and exact nature of this\nStoic influence on the grammatical tradition has, however, been the\nsubject of considerable debate. On the interactions of grammar and\nphilosophy, see Lallot 1988, Sluiter 1990, Ildefonse 1997, Swiggers\nand Wouters 2002, Atherton and Blank 2013; on the Stoics specifically,\nsee Frede 1977, Atherton and Blank 2003; on Apollonius Dyscolus, Blank\n1982, 2000; and on Latin grammar and Priscian, Baratin 1989, Luhtala\n2005, Baratin et al. 2009, Ebbesen 2009.\n5.2 On Christian Writers\n\nChristian writers were receptive to some elements of Stoicism. There\nexists an inauthentic correspondence between St Paul and Seneca\nincluded in the Apocrypha. This forgery is a very ancient one, since\nit was referred to in both Jerome (De Viris Illustribus 12)\nand Augustine (Epistle 153.4). But the fact that the letters\nwere not written by Paul or by Seneca does not mean that Paul was\nunaware of Stoic philosophy, nor that his own thought may not be\nunderstood in relation to Stoic theory, cf. Engberg-Pedersen 2000. The\ntradition of theories of natural law in ethics seems to stem directly\nfrom Stoicism. (Compare Cicero, De Legibus 1.18 with later\nwriters like Aquinas in Summa Theologica II, 2, q. 94.)\nAugustine chose to follow the Stoics rather than the Platonists (his\nusual allies among the philosophers) on a number of points, including\non the question of animals\u2019 membership in the moral community\n(City of God 1.20) and in his philosophy of language. Sorabji\n2000, part IV, argues that the Stoic idea of freedom from the passions\nwas adapted and transmuted into the idea of seven deadly sins by\nEvagrius. In general, see Colish 1985 for the presence of Stoicism in\nLatin writers through the sixth century.\n\nThe influence of Stoicism on Medieval thought has been considered by\nVerbeke 1983. In general, the handling of Stoic ideas in the context\nof Christian orthodoxy required a certain delicacy. While it was\nagreed by nearly all that God was not a material being, the state of\nthe human soul was a more controversial matter. In general, ancient\nChristian orthodoxy evolved away from materialist anthropology of the\nsort found in Tertullian to the immaterialist notion of the soul that\npresent-day Christians take for granted. Medieval Christians felt it\nnecessary to reject what they called Stoic fatalism, but notions of\nconscience and natural law had clear connections with Stoic\nthought.\n5.3 On Renaissance and Early Modern Philosophy\n\nThe late 16th and early 17th centuries saw efforts to form a\nsystematic synthesis of Christianity and Stoicism. The most important\nfigure in the Neo-Stoic movement was\n Justus Lipsius.\n The influence of the Hellenistic schools generally on early modern\nphilosophy is the theme of the essays collected in Miller and Inwood\n2003. See also Osler 1991 and Strange and Zupko 2004.\n5.4 On Contemporary Philosophy\n\nWhile Stoic texts were not widely read or readily accessible in the\n19th and early 20th centuries, some of their views were presented in\nanthologies and historical surveys, such as Prantl\u2019s 1855\nHistory of Western Logic, the first volume of which contains\na lengthy chapter on Stoic logic. A recent study by S. Bobzien (2021)\nhas suggested that the latter might have found its way to Gottlob\nFrege, the 20th century philosopher credited by many with founding\nanalytic philosophy. In this work, Bobzien produces evidence that some\nof Frege\u2019s own work is derived from, and heavily indebted to,\nthese Stoic texts.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Collections of primary texts", "Primary texts by specific authors", "Useful Reference Works", "Introductions to Stoicism", "A few collections, monographs, and some individual articles referred to above"], "cat_ref_text": {"Collections of primary texts": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "von Arnim, H., 1903\u20135 <em>Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</em>\nLeipzig: Teubner.
