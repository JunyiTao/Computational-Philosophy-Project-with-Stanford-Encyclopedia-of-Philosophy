    "main_text": "Foundational Feminist Perspectives || Ontology\n2.1 Ontology\n\nFeminist philosophy favors a moral ontology that contrasts sharply\nwith that of traditional moral philosophy. In a now well-rehearsed\ncritique, feminists argue that the model of the agential subject used\nin mainstream moral and political thought reflects rather too closely\nthe gendered social and political environment in which it was first\ndevised (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000). This model identifies the self\nas a singular, isolated locus of consciousness, with little account\ngiven to either the particularities of the body or the familial and\ncommunity contexts within which moral agents operate except where\nembodiment and social embeddedness are thought to compromise moral\nagency. Feminist moral theory has long argued that this picture is\nflawed, and in the end, ethically treacherous, because it leaves out\nmany features of human life that are essential to genuine moral\nselfhood and agency. Mainstream theory was (and often still is)\ndevised by the most privileged members of societies in which privilege\nis distributed according to sex and class. Feminist theory notes that\nthis has resulted in the perspectives and experiences of men being\nmistaken for universals, and the perspectives and experiences of women\n(shaped by the biological fact of female embodiment and the social\nfact of subordinate status) being dismissed. In the nonideal world,\nmoral subjects are embodied beings, and the particularities\nof their bodies are morally relevant; they are also linked to known\nand unknown others through dependencies and responsibilities that are\noften unchosen; and these connections to other persons are asymmetric\nas a rule rather than exceptionally. This moral ontology gives a more\naccurate depiction of reality and is therefore a more theoretically\nuseful model.\n\nIt is only fair to acknowledge that contemporary moral and political\nphilosophy has engaged to some extent with these critiques from\nfeminists and others, and as a result some would now consider this to\nbe a caricature of its views. Nevertheless, it is still relatively\nrare to see nonfeminist applied ethics, including bioethics,\ndescribing moral subjects and agents in explicitly socially embedded\nand embodied terms.\n",
