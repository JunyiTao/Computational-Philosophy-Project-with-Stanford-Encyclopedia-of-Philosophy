    "main_text": "Mach || Mach-lite versus Mach-heavy\n1.3 Mach-lite versus Mach-heavy\n\nMach-lite, like the relational interpretations of Newtonian physics\nreviewed in the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 5, offers us a way of understanding Newtonian physics without\naccepting absolute position, velocity or acceleration. But it does so\nin a way that lacks theoretical clarity and elegance, since it does\nnot delimit a clear set of cosmological models. We know that Mach-lite\nmakes the same predictions as Newtonian physics for worlds in which\nthere is a static frame associated with the stars and galaxies; but if\nasked about how things will behave in a world with no frame of fixed\nstars, or in which the stars are far from \u2018fixed\u2019, it\nshrugs and refuses to answer. (Recall that Mach-lite simply says:\n\u201cNewton\u2019s laws hold in the frame of reference of the fixed\nstars.\u201d) This is perfectly acceptable according to Mach\u2019s\nphilosophy of science, since the job of mechanics is simply to\nsummarize observable facts in an economical way. But it is\nunsatisfying to those with stronger realist intuitions about laws of\nnature.\n\nIf there is, in fact, a distinguishable privileged frame of reference\nin which the laws of mechanics take on a specially simple form,\nwithout that frame being determined in any way by relation to the\nmatter distribution, a realist will find it hard to resist the\ntemptation to view motions described in that frame as the\n\u2018true\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 motions. If there is a\nfamily of such frames, disagreeing about velocity but all agreeing\nabout acceleration, then the realist will feel a temptation to think\nof at least acceleration as \u2018true\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute\u2019. If such a realist believes motion to be by\nnature a relation rather than a property (and not all philosophers\naccept this; see the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 1) then they will feel obliged to accord some sort of\nexistence or reality to the structure \u2013 e.g., the structure of\nGalilean spacetime \u2013 in relation to which these motions are\ndefined. For philosophers with such realist inclinations, the ideal\nrelational account of motion would therefore be some version of\nMach-heavy.\n",
