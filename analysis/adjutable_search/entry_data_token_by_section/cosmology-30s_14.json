In short order, McCrea, Walker\nand Robertson succumbed to Milne\u2019s methodological\nrecommendations: first, to carry out an operationalist paring of\nnon-observational concepts, then, secondly, to embed the resulting\nminimalist concept set in an axiomatic hypothetical-deductive\nstructure. Thus was the famous Robertson-Walker spacetime metric\nborn.\n",
