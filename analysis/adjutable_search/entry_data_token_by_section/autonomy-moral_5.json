    "main_text": "Autonomy in Moral Philosophy || Autonomy and Paternalism\n2.2 Autonomy and Paternalism\n\nAutonomy is the aspect of persons that undue paternalism offends\nagainst. Paternalistic interventions can be both interpersonal\n(governed by social and moral norms) and a matter of policy (mediated\nby formal or legal rules). Such interventions are identified not by\nthe kind of acts they involve but by the justification given for them,\nso that paternalism involves interference with a person\u2019s\nactions or knowledge against that person\u2019s will for the purpose\nof advancing that person\u2019s good. Respect for autonomy is meant\nto prohibit such interventions because they involve a judgment that\nthe person is not able to decide for herself how best to pursue her\nown good. Autonomy is the ability to so decide, so for the autonomous\nsubject of such interventions paternalism involves a lack of respect\nfor autonomy. See also Paternalism.\n\nBut as our discussion of the nature of autonomy indicated, it is often\nunclear exactly what that characteristic involves. Important in this\ncontext is whether autonomy can be manifested in degrees \u2014\nwhether the abilities and capacities that constitute autonomy obtain\nall at once or progressively, or I can enjoy sufficient autonomy in\nsome areas of my life but not in others. If autonomy is a matter of\ndegree in any of these ways, then it is unclear that a blanket\nprohibition against paternalism is warranted. Some people will be less\nable to judge for themselves what their own good is and hence be more\nsusceptible to (justified) paternalistic intervention (Conly 2013; see\nalso Killmister 2017, chap. 7).\n\nOften such an obligation toward another person requires us to treat\nher as autonomous, independent of the extent to which she is so\nconcerning the choice in question. At least this is the case when a\nperson is autonomous above a certain threshold: she is an adult, not\nunder the influence of debilitating factors, and so on. I might know\nthat a person is to some degree under the sway of external pressures\nthat are severely limiting her ability to govern her life and make\nindependent choices. But as long as she has not lost the basic ability\nto reflectively consider her options and make choices, if I intervene\nagainst her will (for her own good), I show less respect for her as a\nperson than if I allow her to make her own mistakes. (Which is not to\nsay, of course, that intervention in such cases might not, in the end,\nbe justified; only that something is lost when it is engaged in, and\nwhat is lost is a degree of interpersonal respect we owe each\nother.)\n\nHowever, as we saw in the last section, this move depends on the\ndetermination of basic autonomy and an argument that such a threshold\nis non-arbitrary. Also relevant here is the question of procedural\nversus substantive autonomy as the ground of the prohibition of\npaternalism. For if by \u201cautonomy\u201d we mean the ability to\ngovern oneself no matter how depraved or morally worthless are the\noptions being exercised, it is unclear that the bar to paternalism\n(and respect for persons generally) retains its normative force. As I\nmentioned above, the response to this challenge must be that the\ndecision making capacity itself is of non-derivative value,\nindependent of the content of those decisions, at least if one wishes\nto avoid the difficulties of positing a substantive (and hence\nnon-neutral) conception of autonomy as the basis for interpersonal\nrespect.\n\nThis is merely a sampling of some of the central ways that the idea of\nautonomy figures in moral philosophy. Not discussed here are areas of\napplied ethics, for example in medical ethics, where respect for\nautonomy grounds such principles as that of informed consent. Such\ncontexts illustrate the fundamental value that autonomy generally is\nthought to represent as expressive of one of the fundamentals of moral\npersonhood. \n",
