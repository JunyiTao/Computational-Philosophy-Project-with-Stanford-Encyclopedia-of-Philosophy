    "main_text": "Ethics || God or Nature\n2.1 God or Nature\n\n\u201cOn God\u201d begins with some deceptively simple definitions\nof terms that would be familiar to any seventeenth century\nphilosopher. \u201cBy substance I understand what is in itself and is\nconceived through itself\u201d; \u201cBy attribute I understand what\nthe intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its\nessence\u201d; \u201cBy God I understand a being absolutely\ninfinite, i.e., a substance consisting of an infinity of attributes,\nof which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.\u201d\nThe definitions of Part One are, in effect, simply clear concepts that\nground the rest of his system. They are followed by a number of axioms\nthat, he assumes, will be regarded as obvious and unproblematic by the\nphilosophically informed (\u201cWhatever is, is either in itself or\nin another\u201d; \u201cFrom a given determinate cause the effect\nfollows necessarily\u201d). From these, the first proposition\nnecessarily follows, and every subsequent proposition can be\ndemonstrated using only what precedes it. (References to the\nEthics will be by part (I\u2013V), proposition (p),\ndefinition (d), scholium (s) and corollary (c).)\n\nIn propositions one through fifteen of Part One, Spinoza presents the\nbasic elements of his picture of God. God is the infinite, necessarily\nexisting (that is, self-caused), unique substance of the universe.\nThere is only one substance in the universe; it is God; and everything\nelse that is, is in God.\n\n\nProposition 1: A substance is prior in nature\nto its affections.\n\nProposition 2: Two substances having different\nattributes have nothing in common with one another. (In other words,\nif two substances differ in nature, then they have nothing in\ncommon).\n\nProposition 3: If things have nothing in\ncommon with one another, one of them cannot be the cause of the\nother.\n\nProposition 4: Two or more distinct things are\ndistinguished from one another, either by a difference in the\nattributes [i.e., the natures or essences] of the substances or by a\ndifference in their affections [i.e., their accidental\nproperties].\n\nProposition 5: In nature, there cannot be two\nor more substances of the same nature or attribute.\n\nProposition 6: One substance cannot be\nproduced by another substance.\n\nProposition 7: It pertains to the nature of a\nsubstance to exist.\n\nProposition 8: Every substance is necessarily\ninfinite.\n\nProposition 9: The more reality or being each\nthing has, the more attributes belong to it.\n\nProposition 10: Each attribute of a substance\nmust be conceived through itself.\n\nProposition 11: God, or a substance consisting\nof infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite\nessence, necessarily exists. (The proof of this proposition consists\nsimply in the classic \u201contological proof for God\u2019s\nexistence\u201d. Spinoza writes that \u201cif you deny this,\nconceive, if you can, that God does not exist. Therefore, by axiom 7\n[\u2018If a thing can be conceived as not existing, its essence does\nnot involve existence\u2019], his essence does not involve existence.\nBut this, by proposition 7, is absurd. Therefore, God necessarily\nexists, q.e.d.\u201d)\n\nProposition 12: No attribute of a substance\ncan be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be\ndivided.\n\nProposition 13: A substance which is\nabsolutely infinite is indivisible.\n\nProposition 14: Except God, no substance can\nbe or be conceived.\n\n\nThis proof that God\u2014an infinite, eternal (necessary and\nself-caused), indivisible being\u2014is the only substance of the\nuniverse proceeds in three simple steps. First, establish that no two\nsubstances can share an attribute or essence (Ip5). Then, prove that\nthere is a substance with infinite attributes (i.e., God) (Ip11). It\nfollows, in conclusion, that the existence of that infinite substance\nprecludes the existence of any other substance. For if there\nwere to be a second substance, it would have to have\nsome attribute or essence. But since God has all\npossible attributes, then the attribute to be possessed by this second\nsubstance would be one of the attributes already possessed by God. But\nit has already been established that no two substances can have the\nsame attribute. Therefore, there can be, besides God, no such second\nsubstance.\n\nIf God is the only substance, and (by axiom 1) whatever is, is either\na substance or in a substance, then everything else must be\nin God. \u201cWhatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be\nconceived without God\u201d (Ip15). Those things that are\n\u201cin\u201d God (or, more precisely, in God\u2019s attributes)\nare what Spinoza calls \u2018modes\u2019 (or\n\u2018affections\u2019).\n\nAs soon as this preliminary conclusion has been established, Spinoza\nimmediately reveals the objective of his attack. His definition of\nGod\u2014condemned since his excommunication from the Jewish\ncommunity as a \u201cGod existing in only a philosophical\nsense\u201d\u2014is meant to preclude any anthropomorphizing of the\ndivine being. In the scholium to proposition fifteen, he writes\nagainst \u201cthose who feign a God, like man, consisting of a body\nand a mind, and subject to passions. But how far they wander from the\ntrue knowledge of God, is sufficiently established by what has already\nbeen demonstrated.\u201d Besides being false, such an anthropomorphic\nconception of God standing as judge over us can have only deleterious\neffects on human freedom and activity, insofar as it fosters a life\nenslaved to hope and fear and the superstitions to which such emotions\ngive rise.\n\nMuch of the technical language of Part One is, to all appearances,\nright out of Descartes. But even the most devoted Cartesian would have\nhad a hard time understanding (and, certainly, accepting) the full\nimport of propositions one through fifteen. What does it mean to say\nthat God is substance and that everything else is \u201cin\u201d\nGod? Is Spinoza saying that rocks, tables, chairs, birds, mountains,\nrivers and human beings are all properties of God, and hence\ncan be predicated of God (just as one would say that the table\n\u201cis red\u201d)? It seems very odd to think that objects and\nindividuals\u2014what we ordinarily think of as independent\n\u201cthings\u201d\u2014are, in fact, merely properties of a thing,\nitems that inhere in something else. Spinoza was sensitive to the\nstrangeness of this kind of talk, not to mention the philosophical\nproblems to which it gives rise. When a person feels pain, does it\nfollow that the pain is ultimately just a property of God,\nand thus that God feels pain? All of this has given rise to a great\ndeal of scholarly debate as to what Spinoza means by saying all things\nbeing modes of or \u201cin\u201d God. They may also explain why, as\nof Proposition Sixteen, there is a subtle but important shift in\nSpinoza\u2019s language. God is now described not so much as the\nunderlying substance of all things, but as the universal, immanent and\nsustaining cause of all that exists: \u201cFrom the necessity of the\ndivine nature there must follow infinitely many things in infinitely\nmany modes, (i.e., everything that can fall under an infinite\nintellect)\u201d.\n\nAccording to the traditional Judeo-Christian conception of divinity,\nGod is a transcendent creator, a being who causes a world distinct\nfrom himself to come into being by creating it out of nothing. God\nproduces that world by a spontaneous act of free will, and could just\nas easily have not created anything outside himself. By contrast,\nSpinoza\u2019s God is the cause of all things because all things\nfollow causally and necessarily from the divine nature. Or, as he puts\nit, from God\u2019s infinite power or nature \u201call things have\nnecessarily flowed, or always followed, by the same necessity and in\nthe same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows, from\neternity and to eternity, that its three angles are equal to two right\nangles\u201d (Ip17s1). The existence of the world is, thus,\nmathematically necessary. It is impossible that God should exist but\nnot the world. This does not mean that God does not cause the world to\ncome into being freely, since nothing outside of God\nconstrains him to bring it into existence. But Spinoza does deny that\nGod creates the world by some arbitrary and undetermined act of free\nwill. God could not have done otherwise. There are no alternatives to\nthe actual world\u2014no other possible worlds\u2014and there is no\ncontingency or spontaneity within the world. Nothing could possibly\nhave been otherwise. Everything is absolutely and necessarily\ndetermined.\n\n(Ip29): In nature there is nothing contingent, but all things have\nbeen determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and\nproduce an effect in a certain way.\n\n\n(Ip33): Things could have been produced by God in no other way, and in\nno other order than they have been produced.\n\n\nThere are, however, differences in the way things depend on God. As an\ninfinite being, God has infinite \u201cattributes\u201d. An\nattribute is best understood as a most basic way of being, a general\nnature that is expressed in determinate ways by particular things. We\nhave knowledge of only two of these attributes: thought and extension.\nSome features of the universe follow necessarily from God\u2014or,\nmore precisely, from the absolute nature of one of God\u2019s\nattributes\u2014in a direct and unmediated manner. These are the\nuniversal and eternal aspects of the world, and they do not come into\nor go out of being; Spinoza calls them \u201cinfinite modes\u201d.\nThey include the most general principles of the universe, together\ngoverning all things in all ways. From the attribute of extension\nthere follow the principles governing all extended objects (the truths\nof geometry) and laws governing the motion and rest of bodies (the\nlaws of physics); from the attribute of thought, there follow laws of\nthought (understood by commentators to be either the laws of logic or\nthe laws of psychology). Particular and individual things are causally\nmore remote from God. They are nothing but \u201caffections of\nGod\u2019s attributes, or modes by which God\u2019s attributes are\nexpressed in a certain and determinate way\u201d (Ip25c). More\nprecisely, they are finite modes.\n\nThere are two causal orders or dimensions governing the production and\nactions of particular things. On the one hand, they are determined by\nthe general laws of the universe that follow immediately from\nGod\u2019s natures. On the other hand, each particular thing is\ndetermined to act and to be acted upon by other particular things.\nThus, the actual behavior of a body in motion is a function not just\nof the universal laws of motion, but also of the other bodies in\nmotion and rest surrounding it and with which it comes into\ncontact.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics of God is neatly summed up in a phrase\nthat occurs in the Latin (but not the original Dutch) edition of the\nEthics: \u201cGod, or Nature\u201d, Deus, sive\nNatura: \u201cThat eternal and infinite being we call God, or\nNature, acts from the same necessity from which he exists\u201d (Part\nIV, Preface). It is an ambiguous phrase, since Spinoza could be read\nas trying either to divinize nature or to naturalize God. But for the\ncareful reader there is no mistaking Spinoza\u2019s intention. The\nfriends who, after his death, published his writings left out the\n\u201cor Nature\u201d clause from the more widely accessible Dutch\nversion, probably out of fear of the reaction that this identification\nwould, predictably, arouse among a vernacular audience.\n\nThere are, Spinoza insists, two sides of Nature. First, there is the\nactive, productive aspect of the universe\u2014God and his\nattributes, from which all else follows. This is what Spinoza,\nemploying the same terms he used in the Short Treatise, calls\nNatura naturans, \u201cnaturing Nature\u201d. Strictly\nspeaking, this is identical with God. The other aspect of the universe\nis that which is produced and sustained by the active aspect,\nNatura naturata, \u201cnatured Nature\u201d.\n\nBy Natura naturata I understand whatever follows from the\nnecessity of God\u2019s nature, or from any of God\u2019s\nattributes, i.e., all the modes of God\u2019s attributes insofar as\nthey are considered as things that are in God, and can neither be nor\nbe conceived without God. (Ip29s).\n\n\nThere is some debate in the literature as to whether God is also to be\nidentified with Natura naturata. The more likely reading is\nthat God, as Nature, is both Natura naturans and Natura\nnaturata, and that the infinite and finite modes are not just\neffects of God or Nature\u2019s power but actually inhere in and\nexpress that infinite substance. Be that as it may, Spinoza\u2019s\nfundamental insight in Book One is that Nature is an indivisible,\neternal or self-caused, substantial whole\u2014in fact, it is the\nonly substantial whole. Outside of Nature, there is nothing,\nand everything that exists is a part of Nature and is brought into\nbeing by Nature with a deterministic necessity. This unified, unique,\nproductive, necessary being just is what is meant by\n\u2018God\u2019. Because of the necessity inherent in Nature, there\nis no teleology in the universe. God or Nature does not act for any\nends, and things do not exist for any set purposes. There are no\n\u201cfinal causes\u201d (to use the common Aristotelian phrase).\nGod does not \u201cdo\u201d things for the sake of anything else.\nThe order of things just follows from God\u2019s essences with an\ninviolable determinism. All talk of God\u2019s purposes, intentions,\ngoals, preferences or aims is just an anthropomorphizing fiction.\n\nAll the prejudices I here undertake to expose depend on this one: that\nmen commonly suppose that all natural things act, as men do, on\naccount of an end; indeed, they maintain as certain that God himself\ndirects all things to some certain end, for they say that God has made\nall things for man, and man that he might worship God. (I, Appendix)\n\n\nGod is not some goal-oriented planner who then judges things by how\nwell they conform to his purposes. Things happen only because of\nNature and its laws. \u201cNature has no end set before it \u2026\nAll things proceed by a certain eternal necessity of nature.\u201d To\nbelieve otherwise is to fall prey to the same superstitions that lie\nat the heart of the organized religions.\n\n\nPeople] find\u2014both in themselves and outside\nthemselves\u2014many means that are very helpful in seeking their own\nadvantage, e.g., eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, plants and\nanimals for food, the sun for light, the sea for supporting fish\n\u2026 Hence, they consider all natural things as means to their own\nadvantage. And knowing that they had found these means, not provided\nthem for themselves, they had reason to believe that there was someone\nelse who had prepared those means for their use. For after they\nconsidered things as means, they could not believe that the things had\nmade themselves; but from the means they were accustomed to prepare\nfor themselves, they had to infer that there was a ruler, or a number\nof rulers of nature, endowed with human freedom, who had taken care of\nall things for them, and made all things for their use.\n\nAnd since they had never heard anything about the temperament of these\nrulers, they had to judge it from their own. Hence, they maintained\nthat the Gods direct all things for the use of men in order to bind\nmen to them and be held by men in the highest honor. So it has\nhappened that each of them has thought up from his own temperament\ndifferent ways of worshipping God, so that God might love them above\nall the rest, and direct the whole of Nature according to the needs of\ntheir blind desire and insatiable greed. Thus this prejudice was\nchanged into superstition, and struck deep roots in their minds. (I,\nAppendix)\n\n\nA judging God who has plans and acts purposively is a God to be obeyed\nand placated. Opportunistic preachers are then able to play on our\nhopes and fears in the face of such a God. They prescribe ways of\nacting that are calculated to avoid being punished by that God and\nearn his rewards. But, Spinoza insists, to see God or Nature as acting\nfor the sake of ends\u2014to find purpose in Nature\u2014is to\nmisconstrue Nature and \u201cturn it upside down\u201d by putting\nthe effect (the end result) before the true cause.\n\nNor does God perform miracles, since there are no, and cannot be,\ndepartures whatsoever from the necessary course of nature. This would\nbe for God or Nature to act against itself, which is absurd. The\nbelief in miracles is due only to ignorance of the true causes of\nphenomena.\n\nIf a stone has fallen from a room onto someone\u2019s head and killed\nhim, they will show, in the following way, that the stone fell in\norder to kill the man. For if it did not fall to that end, God willing\nit, how could so many circumstances have concurred by chance (for\noften many circumstances do concur at once)? Perhaps you will answer\nthat it happened because the wind was blowing hard and the man was\nwalking that way. But they will persist: why was the wind blowing hard\nat that time? why was the man walking that way at that time? If you\nanswer again that the wind arose then because on the preceding day,\nwhile the weather was still calm, the sea began to toss, and that the\nman had been invited by a friend, they will press on\u2014for there\nis no end to the questions which can be asked: but why was the sea\ntossing? why was the man invited at just that time? And so they will\nnot stop asking for the causes of causes until you take refuge in the\nwill of God, i.e., the sanctuary of ignorance. (I, Appendix)\n\n\nThis is strong language, and Spinoza is clearly aware of the risks of\nhis position. The same preachers who take advantage of our credulity\nwill fulminate against anyone who tries to pull aside the curtain and\nreveal the truths of Nature. \u201cOne who seeks the true causes of\nmiracles, and is eager, like an educated man, to understand natural\nthings, not to wonder at them, like a fool, is generally considered\nand denounced as an impious heretic by those whom the people honor as\ninterpreters of nature and the Gods. For they know that if ignorance\nis taken away, then foolish wonder, the only means they have of\narguing and defending their authority is also taken away.\u201d\n\nFor centuries, Spinoza has been regarded\u2014by his enemies and his\npartisans, in the scholarly literature and the popular\nimagination\u2014as a \u201cpantheist\u201d. It is not clear,\nhowever, that this is the proper way to look at his conception of God.\nOf course, Spinoza is not a traditional theist, for whom God is a\ntranscendent and providential being. But does Spinoza\u2019s\nidentification of God with Nature mean that he is, as so many have\ninsisted for so long, from the early eighteenth century up through the\nmost recent edition of the Cambridge Dictionary of\nPhilosophy, a pantheist?\n\nIn general, pantheism is the view that rejects the transcendence of\nGod. According to the pantheist, God is, in some way, identical with\nthe world. There may be aspects of God that are ontologically or\nepistemologically distinct from the world, but for pantheism this must\nnot imply that God is essentially separate from the world. The\npantheist is also likely to reject any kind of anthropomorphizing of\nGod, or attributing to the deity psychological and moral\ncharacteristics modeled on human nature. The pantheist\u2019s God is\n(usually) not a personal God.\n\nWithin this general framework, it is possible to distinguish two\nvarieties of pantheism. First, pantheism can be understood as the\ndenial of any distinction whatsoever between God and the natural world\nand the assertion that God is in fact identical with everything that\nexists. \u201cGod is everything and everything is God.\u201d On this\nview, God is the world and all its natural contents, and nothing\ndistinct from them. This is reductive pantheism. Second, pantheism can\nbe understood as asserting that God is distinct from the world and its\nnatural contents but nonetheless contained or immanent within them,\nperhaps in the way in which water is contained in a saturated sponge.\nGod is everything and everywhere, on this version, by virtue of being\nwithin everything. This is immanentist pantheism; it involves that\nclaim that nature contains within itself, in addition to its natural\nelements, an immanent supernatural and divine element.\n\nIs Spinoza, then, a pantheist? Any adequate analysis of\nSpinoza\u2019s identification of God and Nature will show clearly\nthat Spinoza cannot be a pantheist in the second, immanentist sense.\nFor Spinoza, there is nothing but Nature and its attributes and modes.\nAnd within Nature there can certainly be nothing that is supernatural.\nIf Spinoza is seeking to eliminate anything, it is that which is above\nor beyond nature, which escapes the laws and processes of nature. But\nis he a pantheist in the first, reductive sense?\n\nThe issue of whether God is to be identified with the whole of Nature\n(i.e., Natura naturans and Natura naturata) or only\na part of Nature (i.e., Natura naturans alone), which has\noccupied a good deal of the recent literature, might be seen as\ncrucial to the question of Spinoza\u2019s alleged pantheism. After\nall, if pantheism is the view that God is everything, then Spinoza is\na pantheist only if he identifies God with all of Nature. Indeed, this\nis exactly how the issue is often framed. Both those who believe that\nSpinoza is a pantheist and those who believe that he is not a\npantheist focus on the question of whether God is to be identified\nwith the whole of Nature, including the infinite and finite modes of\nNatura naturata, or only with substance and its attributes\n(Natura naturans) but not the modes. Thus, it has been argued\nthat Spinoza is not a pantheist, because God is to be identified only\nwith substance and its attributes, the most universal, active causal\nprinciples of Nature, and not with any modes of substance. Other\nscholars have argued that Spinoza is a pantheist, just because he does\nidentify God with the whole of nature.\n\nHowever, this debate about the extent of Spinoza\u2019s\nidentification of God with Nature is not really to the point when the\nquestion is about Spinoza\u2019s alleged pantheism. To be sure, if by\n\u2018pantheism\u2019 is meant the idea that God is everything, and\nif one reads Spinoza as saying that God is only Natura\nnaturans, then Spinoza\u2019s God is not everything and\nconsequently Spinoza is not a pantheist, at least in the ordinary\nsense. Finite things, on this reading, while caused by the eternal,\nnecessary and active aspects of Nature, are not identical with God or\nsubstance, but rather are its effects. But this is not the interesting\nsense in which Spinoza is not a pantheist. For even if Spinoza does\nindeed identify God with the whole of Nature, it does not follow that\nSpinoza is a pantheist. The real issue is not what is the proper\nreading of the metaphysics of Spinoza\u2019s conception of God and\nits relationship to finite modes. On either interpretation,\nSpinoza\u2019s move is a naturalistic and reductive one. God is\nidentical either with all of Nature or with only a part of Nature; for\nthis reason, Spinoza shares something with the reductive pantheist.\nBut\u2014and this is the important point\u2014even the atheist can,\nwithout too much difficulty, admit that God is nothing but Nature.\nReductive pantheism and atheism maintain extensionally equivalent\nontologies.\n\nRather, the question of Spinoza\u2019s pantheism is really going to\nbe answered on the psychological side of things, with regard to the\nproper attitude to take toward Deus sive Natura. And however\none reads the relationship between God and Nature in Spinoza, it is a\nmistake to call him a pantheist in so far as pantheism is still a kind\nof religious theism. What really distinguishes the pantheist from the\natheist is that the pantheist does not reject as inappropriate the\nreligious psychological attitudes demanded by theism. Rather, the\npantheist simply asserts that God\u2014conceived as a being before\nwhich one is to adopt an attitude of worshipful awe\u2014is or is in\nNature. And nothing could be further from the spirit of\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy. Spinoza does not believe that worshipful\nawe or religious reverence is an appropriate attitude to take before\nGod or Nature. There is nothing holy or sacred about Nature, and it is\ncertainly not the object of a religious experience. Instead, one\nshould strive to understand God or Nature, with the kind of adequate\nor clear and distinct intellectual knowledge that reveals\nNature\u2019s most important truths and shows how everything depends\nessentially and existentially on higher natural causes. The key to\ndiscovering and experiencing God, for Spinoza, is philosophy and\nscience, not religious awe and worshipful submission. The latter give\nrise only to superstitious behavior and subservience to ecclesiastic\nauthorities; the former leads to enlightenment, freedom and true\nblessedness (i.e., peace of mind).\n",
