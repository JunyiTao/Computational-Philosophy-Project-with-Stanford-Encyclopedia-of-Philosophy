    "main_text": "Type-free truth || Axiomatisations of Kripke\u2019s theory with supervaluations\n4.6 Axiomatisations of Kripke\u2019s theory with supervaluations\nKF is intended to be an axiomatization of Kripke\u2019s (1975)\nsemantical theory. This theory is based on partial logic with the\nStrong Kleene evaluation scheme. In Strong Kleene logic not every\nsentence \\(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi\\) is a theorem; in particular, this\ndisjunction is not true if \\(\\phi\\) lacks a truth\nvalue. Consequently \\(T\\ulcorner L\\vee \\neg L\\urcorner\\)\n(where \\(L\\) is the Liar sentence) is not a theorem of KF and its\nnegation is even provable. Cantini (1990) has proposed a system VF\nthat is inspired by the supervaluations scheme. In VF all classical\ntautologies are provably true\nand \\(T\\ulcorner L \\vee \\neg L\\urcorner\\), for instance, is a theorem of\nVF. VF can be formulated\nin \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) and uses\nclassical logic. It is no longer a compositional theory of\ntruth, for the following is not a theorem of VF:\n\n\\[\n\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\forall{\\scriptsize B}(T[{\\scriptsize A} \\vee{\\scriptsize B}] \\leftrightarrow(T{\\scriptsize A} \\vee T{\\scriptsize B})).\n\\]\n\nNot only is this principle inconsistent with the other axioms of\nVF, it does not fit the supervaluationist model for it\nimplies \\(T\\ulcorner L\\urcorner \\vee T\\ulcorner \\neg L\\urcorner\\),\nwhich of course is not correct because according to the intended\nsemantics neither the liar sentence nor its negation is true: both\nlack a truth value.\nExtending a result due to Friedman and Sheard (1987), Cantini\nshowed that VF is much stronger than KF: VF is proof-theoretically\nequivalent to the theory ID\\(_1\\) of non-iterated inductive\ndefinitions, which is not predicative. \n",
