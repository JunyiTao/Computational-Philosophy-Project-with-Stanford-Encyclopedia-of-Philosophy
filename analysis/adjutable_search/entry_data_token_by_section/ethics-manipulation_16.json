    "main_text": "Further Issues || Manipulation and Intent\n4.2 Manipulation and Intent\n\nSome views of manipulation seem to suggest, if not require, that\nmanipulators have fairly complex intentions\u2014such as the\nintention to lead the target astray\u2014for manipulation to occur.\nMarcia Baron and Kate Manne offer compelling reasons to think that\nsuch requirements are too strong. Baron argues that manipulation can\noccur even if the manipulator only has\n\n\na combination of intent and recklessness: the aim of getting the other\nperson do what one wants, together with recklessness in the way that\none goes about reaching that goal. (Baron 2014: 103)\n\n\nShe goes on to argue that the manipulator need not be aware that she\nhas that intention (Baron 2014, 101). Manne agrees; to support this\nclaim, she offers the example of Joan, who gives extravagant gifts to\nrelatives who pay her less attention than (she thinks) they should\n(Manne 2014, 225). Manne tells Joan\u2019s story in such a way that\nit seems plausible to say both that Joan\u2019s gift-giving is a\nmanipulative attempt to make her relatives feel guilty, and that Joan\ndoes not consciously intend to make her relatives feel guilty. If\nManne\u2019s description of her example is correct, then it seems\nthat Joan can manipulate her relatives into feeling guilty without\nhaving any conscious intention of making them feel guilty. (Later,\nManne [2014, 235] goes even farther, suggesting that \u201cpeople can\neven behave manipulatively despite consciously intending not\nto.\u201d) Of course, those who hold that manipulation requires more\nconscious intention than Manne allows might simply deny that\nJoan\u2019s behavior is manipulative. Nevertheless, the arguments\noffered by Baron and Manne raise important questions about the level\nof conscious intentionality required for an action to be\nmanipulative.\n\nThe question of what sort of intention is required for an act to count\nas manipulative has practical implications for assessing the behavior\nof children, who sometimes behave in ways that seem aptly described as\nmanipulative even when they are too young to have the complicated\nintentions that some theories of manipulation might require. Similar\nworries arise for assessing the behavior of people for whom\nmanipulativeness has become a habit, or a part of their personalities.\nIndeed, certain personality disorders\u2014such as borderline\npersonality disorder and antisocial personality disorder\u2014are\noften characterized by manipulativeness, as is the so-called\nMachiavellian personality type (Christie & Geis 1970). As\nprofessor of psychiatric nursing Len Bowers writes,\n\n\nthe manipulative behaviour of some personality-disordered (PD)\npatients is consistent and frequent. It is an integral part of their\ninterpersonal style, a part of the very disorder itself. (Bowers 2003:\n329; see also Potter 2006)\n\n\nIn such cases, one wonders what level of intentionality lies behind\nbehavior that we would otherwise think of as manipulative. Even if we\nare inclined to regard childhood or certain personality disorders as\nfactors that mitigate the blameworthiness of manipulative behavior, it\nwould seem counterintuitive for a theory of manipulation to say that\nchildren and persons with personality disorders are incapable of\nacting manipulatively.\n",
