It corresponds to using the\nframework \\(\\FC_u\\), \\eqref{eqn21} in subsection 7.2,\nwith \\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) the superposition of dead and live cat states. The\nhistories approach addresses this paradox by first noting that there\nis nothing wrong from the point of view of fundamental quantum theory\n(principle R2 of subsection 5.1) with using\n\\(\\FC_u\\), but it is a serious misunderstanding to suppose that\n\\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) or the corresponding property \\([\\Psi_2]\\) represents a\ncat which is both dead and alive. First, the projectors, let us call\nthem \\(P_d\\) and \\(P_a\\), that correspond to the cat being dead and alive\ndo not commute with \\([\\Psi_2]\\), so they cannot, by the single\nframework rule, be brought into the discussion (and, indeed, it is\ndoubtful that any projector associated with what one might call\n\u201ccatness\u201d will commute with \\([\\Psi_2]\\)). Second, since\n\\(P_d P_a=0\\) (distinct macroscopic states) \nboth properties cannot be true simultaneously, so it is false to say that the cat is\nboth dead and alive. In addition the historian may\nremark that the existence of other frameworks in no way invalidates a\ndiscussion based on the quasiclassical one that lies behind the\nordinary language discussion of cats, which is distinguished by its\nutility and not by some framework selection rule,\nsee subsection 11.3. In this case a useful\nframework is the counterpart of \\(\\FC_1\\), \\eqref{eqn22}\nin subsection 7.2, with quasiclassical projectors\n\\(P_d\\) and \\(P_a\\) at time \\(t_2\\), and \\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) understood not as a\nproperty but as a pre-probability useful for assigning probabilities\nthat the cat is dead or alive. At this point the paradox has\ndisappeared.\nA similar but somewhat more complex analysis can be applied\nto Wigner (1961)\u2019s friend; the solution\nis to use an appropriate framework.\n",
