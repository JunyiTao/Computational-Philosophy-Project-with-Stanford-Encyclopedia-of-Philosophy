    "main_text": "Physics || Space\n5.1 Space\n\n\nMach perhaps writes more about space than any single other topic;\nthe Analysis of Sensations is dominated by discussions about\nit (Chapters 6 to 10 are devoted, more or less, exclusively to it) as\nis Space and Geometry. His Science of Mechanics\ncontains his famous analysis of absolute space.  The starting point of\nMach\u2019s thought is that physiological space is different\nfrom geometrical space. The idea of physiological space was\nnot new with Mach; apparently initiated by M\u00fcller, it was\ndiscussed by both Helmholtz and Hering.  Physiological space is the\nspace constructed by our cognitive structure. It is not something we\nintentionally create, but rather it is a product of unconscious\nadaptation, and as such, may be a source of a priori\ntruths. Geometrical space, on the other hand, is an intellectual\nconstruction, \u201creached for the most part by purposeful\nexperience.\u201d [SG: 5] While physiological space is\ncompletely psychological, geometrical space is an abstraction on\nphysiological space. Neither is an \u2018objective\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute\u2019 space.\n\n\nWhereas geometrical space is unbounded, infinite, and homogeneous (at\nleast in its Euclidean form), physiological space is highly bounded,\nfinite, and non-uniform. Geometrical space is detached from our\nemotional psyche, but physiological space is intertwined with basic\nemotions: a tiger nearby in physiological space brings about different\nemotions than a tiger far away in physiological space. Similarly,\nupness and downness, rightness and leftness are not just abstract\ndirections but have physiological, and thus psychological\nmeaning. When objects in physiological space are moved, their (apparent)size\nchanges (similarly, when we move, the size of objects in physiological\nspace also changes).  And, importantly, physiological space does not,\nat least in its origins, have a metric. The origins of physiological\nspace are in unconscious biological need, whereas the origins of\ngeometrical space are in physiological space and intellectual\ndevelopment.\n",
