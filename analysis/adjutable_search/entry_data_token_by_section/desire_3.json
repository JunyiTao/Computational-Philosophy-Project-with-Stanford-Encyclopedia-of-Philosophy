    "main_text": "Theories of Desire || Good-Based Theories of Desire\n1.3 Good-Based Theories of Desire\n\n\nWhile some philosophers hold that desires need to be strongly\nseparated from judgments of goodness, other philosophers think that\nthey need to be more closely linked. It was perhaps the view of\nSocrates that to want something is simply to think it good, and it is\nsimple enough to formulate a theory of desire on this basis.\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for it to believe p\n  is good.\n\n  \n\n\nRecommending such a theory is the intuition, shared by many, that we\nare motivated to do what we judge good just because we judge it good\n(and the intuition that, if I am motivated to do something, I desire to\ndo it). If I judge it good to go to a meeting of the PTA, then that\nsuffices to motivate me to go to the meeting, it would seem, and thus\n(perhaps) to desire it.\n\n\nDavid Lewis has mounted a challenge to such theories of desire on\nthe basis of results from decision theory (Lewis 1988; 1996). Lewis\nconsiders the thesis, Desire As Belief, that a rational individual is\nmotivated to make true a proposition p to the extent that she\nbelieves p to be good, and shows that within a familiar\ndecision-theoretic framework inconsistencies result. In Lewis's\nargument, the result follows because of the differences between\nrational belief revision and rational desire (or motivation) revision\nwithin the decision-theoretic framework. In response to Lewis, a number\nof philosophers have sought to defend the general idea that desires are\nbeliefs in goodness (or are entailed by such beliefs in rational\nindividuals) by defending different specific formulations of the thesis\nwithin decision theory (e.g., Price 1989; Byrne and H\u00e1jek 1997).\nThere have also been efforts to show that formal decision theory might\nnot be formalizing the right things to draw conclusions about desire\nand goodness (e.g., Broome 1991).\n\n\nIn a less formal mode, Dennis Stampe and Graham Oddie have\nindependently advanced very similar good-based theories of desire\naccording to which desires are a kind of high-level perceptual state: a\nperception of goodness.\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for p to\n  appear good to the organism.\n\n  \n\n\nAccording to these theorists, perceptions of goodness are not like\nperceptions of cold or white light, but more like perceptions of\nsomething as looking like Mikhail Gorbachev\u2014i.e., complex,\nhigh-level perceptual states that are nonetheless distinct from belief\nstates. Stampe and Oddie are both careful to hold that the appearance\nof goodness is something quite distinct from the judgment or belief\nthat something is good (and thus, though this is not their main\nconcern, they evade Lewis's formal arguments). On Stampe's\nview, this distinctness is best demonstrated by the fact that it is\nconsistent to claim to believe that something is good while it does not\nseem good (i.e., is not wanted), but it is not consistent to claim to\ndesire something while it does not seem good (i.e., is not wanted). In\na related vein, Oddie argues that, while it is not incoherent to\nbelieve that one course of action is the best while not desiring to\ntake it, there is a tension in such a state of affairs, and this\ntension is best explained as resulting from the fact that desires\nrepresent their contents as good (Stampe 1987; Oddie 2005).\n\n\nOne other interesting variant of the position is defended by\nT.M. Scanlon (1998). According to Scanlon, motivating desires are\njudgments of, not what is good, but what we have reason to\ndo. (Scanlon also holds that there are non\u2013motivating desires\nthat direct attention; these sorts of desires are discussed in the\nnext section.)\n\n\nGood-based theories of desire are motivated by considerations so\ndifferent from action-based theories of desire (or pleasure-based\ntheories) that it is very rare to see advocates of the one attack the\nother, with the exception of Lewis's very technical work and the\nliterature following from it. As a result, difficulties for good-based\ntheories of desire have not been richly explored in the philosophical\nliterature. One puzzle for such theories might be to explain the\nrelationship of desires to non-human animals. On the one hand, it would\nseem that rats desire to get away from cats, desire to be around other\nrats, and the like. On the other hand, it would seem that rats do not\nrepresent anything as good (they would both seem to lack the concept of\ngoodness and to lack a perceptual-style representation of goodness that\nwould be well poised to generate such a concept). But if rats can\ndesire without representing the good, then why would people be\ndifferent? The options available for solving such puzzles have not yet\nbeen fully explored.\n",
