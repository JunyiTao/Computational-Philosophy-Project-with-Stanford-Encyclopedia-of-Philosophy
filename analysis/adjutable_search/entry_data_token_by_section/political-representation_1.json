    "main_text": "Key Components of Political Representation || Delegate vs. Trustee\n1.1 Delegate vs. Trustee\n\nHistorically, the theoretical literature on political representation\nhas focused on whether representatives should act as\ndelegates or as trustees. Representatives who are\ndelegates simply follow the expressed preferences of their\nconstituents. James Madison (1787\u20138) describes representative\ngovernment as \u201cthe delegation of the government...to a small\nnumber of citizens elected by the rest.\u201d Madison recognized that\n\u201cEnlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm.\u201d\nConsequently, Madison suggests having a diverse and large population\nas a way to decrease the problems with bad representation. In other\nwords, the preferences of the represented can partially safeguard\nagainst the problems of faction.\n\nIn contrast, trustees are representatives who follow their own\nunderstanding of the best action to pursue. Edmund Burke (1790) is\nfamous for arguing that\n\nParliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile\ninterests, which interest each must maintain, as an agent and\nadvocate, against other agents and advocates; but Parliament is a\ndeliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the\nwhole\u2026 You choose a member, indeed; but when you have chosen\nhim he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of Parliament\n(115).\n\n\nThe delegate and the trustee conception of political representation\nplace competing and contradictory demands on the behavior of\nrepresentatives. [For a discussion of the similarities and differences\nbetween Madison\u2019s and Burke\u2019s conception of\nrepresentation, see Pitkin 1967, 191\u2013192.] Delegate conceptions\nof representation require representatives to follow their\nconstituents\u2019 preferences, while trustee conceptions require\nrepresentatives to follow their own judgment about the proper course\nof action. Any adequate theory of representation must grapple with\nthese contradictory demands.\n\nFamously, Hanna Pitkin argues that theorists should not try to\nreconcile the paradoxical nature of the concept of representation.\nRather, they should aim to preserve this paradox by recommending that\ncitizens safeguard the autonomy of both the representative and of\nthose being represented. The autonomy of the representative is\npreserved by allowing them to make decisions based on his or her\nunderstanding of the represented\u2019s interests (the trustee\nconception of representation). The autonomy of those being represented\nis preserved by having the preferences of the represented influence\nevaluations of representatives (the delegate conception of\nrepresentation). Representatives must act in ways that safeguard the\ncapacity of the represented to authorize and to hold their\nrepresentatives accountable and uphold the capacity of the\nrepresentative to act independently of the wishes of the\nrepresented.\n\nObjective interests are the key for determining whether the autonomy\nof representative and the autonomy of the represented have been\nbreached. However, Pitkin never adequately specifies how we are to\nidentify constituents\u2019 objective interests. At points, she\nimplies that constituents should have some say in what are their\nobjective interests, but ultimately she merely shifts her focus away\nfrom this paradox to the recommendation that representatives should be\nevaluated on the basis of the reasons they give for disobeying the\npreferences of their constituents. For Pitkin, assessments about\nrepresentatives will depend on the issue at hand and the political\nenvironment in which a representative acts. To understand the multiple\nand conflicting standards within the concept of representation is to\nreveal the futility of holding all representatives to some fixed set\nof guidelines. In this way, Pitkin concludes that standards for\nevaluating representatives defy generalizations. Moreover,\nindividuals, especially democratic citizens, are likely to disagree\ndeeply about what representatives should be doing.\n",
