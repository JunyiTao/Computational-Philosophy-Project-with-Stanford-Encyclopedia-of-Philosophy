    "main_text": "Responding to Civil Disobedience || Accommodating Civil Disobedience\n4.3 Accommodating Civil Disobedience\n\nPhilosophers have typically focused on the question of how courts\nshould treat civil disobedients, while neglecting to apply that\nquestion to law enforcement. Yet the police have much discretion in\nhow to deal with civil disobedients. In particular, they have no\nobligation to arrest protesters when they commit minor violations of\nthe law such as traffic obstruction: accommodation of and\ncommunication with protesters is something they can but all too rarely\ndecide to do. Instead, many governments practice militarized\nrepression of protests. Local police departments in the U.S. often\nrespond to demonstrations with riot gear and other military equipment.\nAlso, the British government sought to strengthen public order laws\nand secure new police powers to crack down on Extinction Rebellion\n(XR), the global environmental movement whose street protests,\ndie-ins, and roadblocks for climate justice have brought cities to a\nstandstill.\n\nOne notable exception to the theoretical neglect of law enforcement is\nSmith\u2019s (2013, ch. 5) articulation of a \u201cpolicing\nphilosophy\u201d that orientates policing strategies toward\naccommodation, rather than prevention or repression, of civil\ndisobedience. On Smith\u2019s view, \u201cthe police should, where\npossible, cooperate with civilly disobedient activists in order to\nassist in their commission of a protest that is effective as an\nexpression of their grievance against law or policy\u201d (2013,\n111). Accommodation requires communication channels between police and\nactivists and involves strategies such as pre-negotiated arrests.\nWhile the U.S. often implements punitive and strong-handed law\nenforcement strategies, the U.K.\u2019s current goal (at the time of\nwriting) is, according to one senior police source, to develop\n\u2018move forward\u2019 \u2013 proactive and preventive \u2013\ntactics that are designed to clear the streets of XR demonstrators.\nNeither approach respects anything like a right to civil\ndisobedience.\n\nA constitutional government committed to recognizing the right to\ncivil disobedience would also have to reform part of its criminal laws\nand make available certain defenses. Brownlee proposes two. First,\ndisobedients should have access to a\n\u201cdemands-of-conviction,\u201d excusatory defense to point to\nthe deep and sincere reasons they had for believing they were\njustified in acting the way they did (Brownlee 2012, ch. 5). Second,\nstates should accept necessity as a justificatory defense for civil\ndisobedience undertaken as a reasonable and parsimonious response to\nviolations of and threats to non-contingent basic needs (Brownlee\n2012, ch. 6). As these defenses suggest, constitutionally recognizing\ncivil disobedience does not mean making civil disobedience legal.\nDisobedients would still be arrested and prosecuted, but they would\nget to explain and defend their actions in court. They would be\nheard.\n",
