    "main_text": "\n\n\nPierre Duhem (1861\u20131916) was a French physicist and historian\nand philosopher of science. As a physicist, he championed\n\u201cenergetics,\u201d holding generalized thermodynamics as\nfoundational for physical theory, that is, thinking that all of\nchemistry and physics, including mechanics, electricity, and magnetism,\nshould be derivable from thermodynamic first principles. In philosophy\nof science, he is best known for his work on the relation between\ntheory and experiment, arguing that hypotheses are not\nstraightforwardly refuted by experiment and that there are no crucial\nexperiments in science. In history of science, he produced massive\ngroundbreaking work in medieval science and defended a thesis of\ncontinuity between medieval and early modern science.\n",
