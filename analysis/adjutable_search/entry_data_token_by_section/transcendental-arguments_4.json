Connections to Modal Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nIn listing key features of transcendental arguments in section 2, it\nwas indicated that metaphysical necessity might be the right\nkind of modality for transcendental arguments, and this brings the\ndiscussion to the realm of modal metaphysics. To begin with, if one is\nsceptical about modality anyway (Quine 1953), then using modality to\nunderstand transcendental arguments is a non-starter. However, if one\nis comfortable with modality in general, it is then a natural way to\nanalyse transcendental arguments. After all, transcendental arguments\ncan be seen as offering certain kind of philosophical\nexplanation\u2014\u2018transcendental explanation\u2019, as\nit is sometimes called\u2014and given this, metaphysical\nexplanations of various sorts are natural candidates. More\nspecifically, with our schema above, we should say that X\ntranscendentally explains the possibility of Y, or more\nsuccinctly, X possibilitates Y, and this relation\nshould be understood with metaphysical modalities. This picture is not\nuniversally shared: some hold that in answering transcendental\nhow-possible questions, identifying the necessary conditions for the\ntargets is explanatorily idle (Cassam 2007).\n\nModal metaphysics is itself a difficult area that involves all kinds\nof sophisticated theories, such as realism, ersatzism, fictionalism,\nto name just a few (see entry on varieties of modality). Fortunately,\nto analyse transcendental arguments with metaphysical modality, there\nis no need to commit to any theory of the nature of metaphysical\nnecessity. In effect, what is more relevant is modal epistemology;\nmore specifically, how one manages to know whether a given modal claim\nis true or not. To see how this is so, let\u2019s use this toy\nexample:\n\nKantian categories are necessary conditions for the possibility of\nobjective cognition.\n\n\nWe will use \u201cKantian categories\u201d as a placeholder for any candidates\nfor being the relevant conditions. To analyse this with metaphysical\nnecessity, this statement can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nIt is metaphysically necessary that if there is objective cognition,\nthen Kantian categories are in place.\n\n\nNow, how do we know, or at least try to figure out, the truth or\nfalsity of such a statement? This is where modal epistemology enters\nthe scene. As with many other areas in philosophy, the territory is\noften divided into rationalism and empiricism, though admittedly such\ndivision can also miss the subtleties among different views. In any\ncase, one major view within the rationalist tradition is the\nconceivability approach (Yablo 1993; Chalmers 1996, 2010).\nAccording to such an approach, knowledge of the above statement about\nmetaphysical necessity is based on knowledge of the following:\n\nIt is inconceivable that there is objective cognition without there\nbeing categories in place.\n\n\nThe rationale for this move is that according to such an approach,\nconceivability is a guide to metaphysical possibility, while\ninconceivability is a guide to metaphysical impossibility. Given this,\nif it is metaphysically necessary that if A then B, then it is not\nmetaphysically possible that there is A without B. Now it is natural\nto expect that the difficulties with the conceivability approach will\nthereby translate into this rendering of transcendental arguments, in\nroughly this way: this rendering assumes that inconceivability entails\nmetaphysical impossibility, but such entailment does not hold, because\ninconceivability might just reflect human\u2019s lack of imagination,\nand therefore transcendental arguments are in trouble (Mizrahi 2017).\nWhen Mizrahi makes this claim, he uses Kant\u2019s Refutation of\nIdealism as the prime example, but he intends this point to be applied\nto other transcendental arguments too.\n\nHowever, note that defenders of transcendental arguments have at least\ntwo ways to respond to such a challenge. First, to understand the\ntranscendental conditionals (i.e., claims asserting that the\npossibility of Y requires or presupposes X) as\n(in)conceivability claims is not mandatory. Second, even if we\nunderstand the conditionals this way, there is a weaker version of the\nconceivability approach which holds that (in)conceivability is only a\nguide to (im)possibility, which is obviously much more defensible than\nthe stronger version that involves entailment. To be sure, some might\nfind this version too weak to secure the distinctiveness of certain\narguments being \u2018transcendental.\u2019 If one goes down the\nfirst route, one can opt for other approaches in modal epistemology.\nFor example, another camp of rationalism in this area is the\nessentialist approach (Fine 1995; Lowe 2011, 2012, 2013).\nAccording to such an approach, knowledge of the above statement about\nmetaphysical necessity is based on knowledge of the following:\n\nIt is part of the essence of objective cognition that if there is\nobjective cognition, then categories are in place.\n\n\nNow again, this rendering inherits all the problems with such\napproaches, which will not be covered here (see the entry on the\nepistemology of modality). One can then reject rationalism in this\narea and opt for an entirely different camp, for example the\ncounterfactual approach (Williamson, 2005, 2007, 2016).\nAccording to such an approach, knowledge of the above statement about\nmetaphysical necessity is based on knowledge of the following:\n\nIf there were objective cognition without there being categories in\nplace, then there would be a contradiction.\n\n\nor\n\nObjective cognition without categories counterfactually implies a\ncontradiction.\n\n\nThis approach invokes certain notion of \u2018imaginative\nsimulation\u2019 to model the inference, and it is sometimes said\nthat such an exercise is neither a priori nor a\nposteriori, but \u2018armchair\u2019 (Williamson 2013). Whether\nthis threefold distinction is reasonable is controversial, as it is\ngenerally thought that armchair inferences are a priori\ninferences. Now, note that the same dialectic recurs: this rendering\ninherits all the problems with such approach, and one might therefore\nwish to opt for a different analysis (for more on connecting\ntranscendental arguments and counterfactuals, see Kannisto 2020).\n\nThe point of the above discussion is not to present all the approaches\nin modal epistemology; for example, there are other approaches such as\nthe one that invokes analogical inferences (Roca-Royes 2017). There\nare also approaches that might combine several ideas, for example\nHusserl\u2019s \u2018imaginative variation\u2019 that combines\nconceivability and essence (1931/2012). The key message here is that\nif transcendental conditionals can be thought to embody claims about\nmetaphysical modalities, then both considerations from modal\nmetaphysics and modal epistemology\u2014especially the\nlatter\u2014will influence what we should say about such\nconditionals.  Another potential direction is to see whether\nmetaphysical grounding can be an explanation of transcendental\nconditionals (see the entry on metaphysical grounding). Although it\ncan be tempting and potentially enlightening to connect these\ncontemporary approaches to the historical tradition, no claim about a\ndirect historical connection is made here: it should not be\nassumed\u2014without textual analyses anyway\u2014that any above\napproach captures what Kant, Fichte, and other historical figures had\nin mind when they invoked such arguments.\n",
