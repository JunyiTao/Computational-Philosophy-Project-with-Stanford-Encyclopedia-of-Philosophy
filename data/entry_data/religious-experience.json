    "preamble": "\n\nReligious experiences can be characterized generally as experiences\nthat seem to the person having them to be of some objective reality\nand to have some religious import. That reality can be an individual,\na state of affairs, a fact, or even an absence, depending on the\nreligious tradition the experience is a part of. A wide variety of\nkinds of experience fall under the general rubric of religious\nexperience. The concept is vague, and the multiplicity of kinds of\nexperiences that fall under it makes it difficult to capture in any\ngeneral account. Part of that vagueness comes from the term\n\u2018religion,\u2019 which is difficult to define in any way that\ndoes not either rule out institutions that clearly are religions, or\ninclude terms that can only be understood in the light of a prior\nunderstanding of what religions are. Nevertheless, we can make some\nprogress in elucidating the concept by distinguishing it from distinct\nbut related concepts.\n\nFirst, religious experience is to be distinguished from religious\nfeelings, in the same way that experience in general is to be\ndistinguished from feelings in general. A feeling of elation, for\nexample, even if it occurs in a religious context, does not count in\nitself as a religious experience, even if the subject later comes to\nthink that the feeling was caused by some objective reality of\nreligious significance. An analogy with sense experience is helpful\nhere. If a subject feels a general feeling of happiness, not on\naccount of anything in particular, and later comes to believe the\nfeeling was caused by the presence of a particular person, that fact\ndoes not transform the feeling of happiness into a perception of the\nperson. Just as a mental event, to be a perception of an object, must\nin some sense seem to be an experience of that object, a\nreligiously oriented mental event, to be a religious experience, must\nin some way seem to be an experience of a religiously\nsignificant reality. So, although religious feelings may be involved\nin many, or even most, religious experiences, they are not the same\nthing. Discussions of religious experience in terms of feelings, like\nSchleiermacher\u2019s (1998) \u201cfeeling of absolute\ndependence,\u201d or Otto\u2019s (1923) feeling of the numinous,\nwere important early contributions to theorizing about religious\nexperience, but some have since then argued (see Gellman 2001 and\nAlston 1991, for example) that religious affective states are not all\nthere is to religious experience. To account for the experiences\nqua experiences, we must go beyond subjective feelings.\n\nReligious experience is also to be distinguished from mystical\nexperience. Although there is obviously a close connection between the\ntwo, and mystical experiences are religious experiences, not all\nreligious experiences qualify as mystical. The word\n\u2018mysticism\u2019 has been understood in many different ways.\nJames (1902) took mysticism to necessarily involve ineffability, which\nwould rule out many cases commonly understood to be mystical. Alston\n(1991) adopted the term grudgingly as the best of a bad lot and gave\nit a semi-technical meaning. But in its common, non-technical sense,\nmysticism is a specific religious system or practice, deliberately\nundertaken in order to come to some realization or insight, to come to\nunity with the divine, or to experience the ultimate reality directly.\nAt the very least, religious experiences form a broader category; many\nreligious experiences, like those of Saint Paul, Arjuna, Moses,\nMuhammad, and many others come unsought, not as the result of some\ndeliberate practice undertaken to produce an experience.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Types of Religious Experience\n\nReports of religious experiences reveal a variety of different kinds.\nPerhaps most are visual or auditory presentations (visions and\nauditions), but not through the physical eyes or ears. Subjects report\n\u201cseeing\u201d or \u201chearing,\u201d but quickly disavow any\nclaim to seeing or hearing with bodily sense organs. Such experiences\nare easy to dismiss as hallucinations, but the subjects of the\nexperience frequently claim that though it is entirely internal, like\na hallucination or imagination, it is nevertheless a veridical\nexperience, through some spiritual analog of the eye or ear (James\n1902 and Alston 1991 cite many examples). \nIn other cases, the language of \u201cseeing\u201d is used in its\nextended sense of realization, as when a yogi is said to\n\u201csee\u201d his or her identity with Brahman; Buddhists speak of\n\u201cseeing things as they are\u201d as one of the hallmarks of\ntrue enlightenment, where this means grasping or realizing the\nemptiness of things, but not in a purely intellectual way.\n\nA third type is the religious experience that comes through\nsensory experiences of ordinary objects, but seems to carry with it\nextra information about some supramundane reality. Examples include\nexperiencing God in nature, in the starry sky, or a flower, or the\nlike. Another person standing nearby would see exactly the same sky or\nflower, but would not necessarily have the further religious content\nto his or her experience. There are also cases in which the religious\nexperience just is an ordinary perception, but the physical object is\nitself the object of religious significance. Moses\u2019s experience\nof the burning bush, or the Buddha\u2019s disciples watching him\nlevitate, are examples of this type. A second person standing nearby\nwould see exactly the same phenomenon. Witnesses to miracles are\nhaving that kind of religious experience, whether they understand it\nthat way or not. \n\nA fourth type of religious experience is harder to\ndescribe: it can\u2019t be characterized accurately in sensory\nlanguage, even analogically, yet the subject of the experience insists\nthat the experience is a real, direct awareness of some religiously\nsignificant reality external to the subject. These kinds of\nexperiences are usually described as \u201cineffable.\u201d\nDepending on one\u2019s purposes, other ways of dividing up religious\nexperiences will suggest themselves. For example, William James (1902)\ndivides experiences into \u201chealthy-minded\u201d and\n\u201csick-minded,\u201d according to the personality of the\nsubject, which colors the content of the experience itself. Keith\nYandell (1993, 25\u201332) divided them into five categories,\naccording to the content of the experiences: monotheistic, nirvanic\n(enlightenment experiences associated with Buddhism), kevalic\n(enlightenment experiences associated with Jainism), moksha\n(experiences of release from karma, associated with Hinduism), and\nnature experiences. Differences of object certainly make differences\nin content, and so make differences in what can be said about the\nexperiences. See Section 4 for further discussion of this\nissue.\n2. Language and Experience\n\nMany have thought that there is some special problem with religious\nlanguage, that it can\u2019t be meaningful in the same way that\nordinary language is. The Logical Positivists claimed that language is\nmeaningful only insofar as it is moored in our experiences of the\nphysical world. Since we can\u2019t account for religious language by\nlinking it to experiences of the physical world, such language is\nmeaningless. Even though religious claims look in every way like\nordinary assertions about the world, their lack of empirical\nconsequences makes them meaningless. Ayer (1952) calls such language\n\u201cmetaphysical,\u201d and therefore meaningless. He says, \u201cThat a\ntranscendent god exists 3s a metaphysical assertion, and therefore not\nliterally significant.\u201d The principle of verification went through\nmany formulations as it faced criticism. But if it is understood as a\nclaim about meaning in ordinary language, it seems to be\nself-undermining, since there is no empirical way to verify it.\nEventually, that approach to language fell out of favor, but some\nstill use a modified, weaker version to criticize religious language.\nFor example, Antony Flew (Flew and MacIntyre, 1955) relies on a\nprinciple to the effect that if a claim is not falsifiable, it is\nsomehow illegitimate. Martin (1990) and Nielsen (1985) invoke a\nprinciple that combines verifiability and falsifiability; to be\nmeaningful, a claim must be one or the other. It is not clear that\neven these modified and weakened versions of the verification principle\nentirely escape self-undermining. Even if they do, they seem to take\nother kinds of language with them\u2014like moral language, talk\nabout the future or past, and talk about the contents of others\u2019\nminds \u2014 that we might be loath to lose. Moreover, to deny the\nmeaningfulness of religious-experience claims on the grounds that it\nis not moored in experience begs the question, in that it assumes that\nreligious experiences are not real experiences.\n\nAnother possibility is to allow that religious claims are meaningful,\nbut they are not true or false, because they should not be understood\nas assertions. Braithwaite (1970), for example, understands religious\nclaims to be expressions of commitments to sets of values. On such a\nview, what appears to be a claim about a religious experience is not\nin fact a claim at all. It might be that some set of mental events,\nwith which the experience itself can be identified, would be the\nground and prompting of the claim, but it would not properly be what\nthe claim is about.\n\nA second challenge to religious-experience claims comes from\nWittgensteinian accounts of language. Wittgenstein (1978) muses at\nsome length on the differences between how ordinary language is used,\nand how religious language is used. Others (see Phillips 1970, for\nexample), following Wittgenstein, have tried to give an explanation of\nthe strangeness of religious language by invoking the idea of a\nlanguage-game. Each language-game has its own rules, including its own\nprocedures for verification. As a result, it is a mistake to treat it\nlike ordinary language, expecting evidence in the ordinary sense, in\nthe same way that it would be a mistake to ask for the evidence for a\njoke. \u201cI saw God\u201d should not be treated in the same way as\n\u201cI saw Elvis.\u201d Some even go so far as to say the religious\nlanguage-game is isolated from other practices, such that it would be\na mistake to derive any claims about history, geography, or cosmology\nfrom them, never mind demand the same kind of evidence for them. On\nthis view, religious experiences should not be treated as comparable\nto sense experiences, but that does not entail that they are not\nimportant, nor that they are not in some sense veridical, in that they\ncould still be avenues for important insights about reality. Such a\nview can be attributed to D. Z. Phillips (1970).\n\nWhile this may account for some of the unusual aspects of religious\nlanguage, it certainly does not capture what many religious people\nthink about the claims they make. As creationism illustrates, many\nreligious folk think it is perfectly permissible to draw empirical\nconclusions from religious doctrine. Hindus and Buddhists for many\ncenturies thought there was a literal Mount Meru in the middle of the\n(flat, disc-shaped) world. It would be very odd if \u201cThe Buddha\nattained enlightenment under the bo tree\u201d had to be given a very\ndifferent treatment from \u201cThe Buddha ate rice under the bo\ntree\u201d because the first is a religious claim and the second is\nan ordinary empirical claim. There are certainly entailment relations\nbetween religious and non-religious claims, too: \u201cJesus died for\nmy sins\u201d straightforwardly entails \u201cJesus died.\u201d\n3. Epistemological Issues\n\nSince the subjects of religious experiences tend to take them to be\nreal experiences of some external reality, we may ask what reason\nthere is to think they are right. That is to say, do religious\nexperiences amount to good reasons for religious belief? One answer to\nthat question is what is often called the Argument from Religious\nExperience: Religious experiences are in all relevant respects like\nsensory experiences; sensory experiences are excellent grounds for\nbeliefs about the physical world; so religious experiences are\nexcellent grounds for religious beliefs. This argument, or one very\nlike it, can be found in Swinburne (1979), Alston (1991), Plantinga\n(1981, 2000), Netland (2022) and others. Critics of this approach\ngenerally find ways in which religious experiences are different from\nsensory experiences, and argue that those differences are enough to\nundermine the evidential value of the experiences. Swinburne (1979)\ninvokes what he calls the \u201cPrinciple of Credulity,\u201d\naccording to which one is justified in believing that what seems to\none to be present actually is present, unless some appropriate\ndefeater is operative. He then discusses a variety of circumstances\nthat would be defeaters in the ordinary sensory case, and argues that\nthose defeaters do not obtain, or not always, in the case of religious\nexperience. To reject his argument, one would have to show that\nreligious experience is unlike sensory experience in that in the\nreligious case, one or more of the defeaters always obtains. Anyone\nwho accepts the principle has excellent reason to accept the\ndeliverances of religious experience, unless he or she believes that\ndefeaters always, or almost always, obtain.\n\nPlantinga offers a different kind of argument. According to\nCartesian-style foundationalism, in order to count as justified, a\nbelief must either be grounded in other justified beliefs, or derive\nits justification from some special status, like infallibility,\nincorrigibility, or indubitability. There is a parallel view about\nknowledge. Plantinga (1981) argued that such a foundationalism is\ninconsistent with holding one\u2019s own ordinary beliefs about the\nworld to be justified (or knowledge), because our ordinary beliefs\nderived from sense-experience aren\u2019t derived from anything\ninfallible, indubitable, or incorrigible. In fact, we typically treat\nthem as foundational, in need of no further justification. If we hold\nsensory beliefs to be properly basic, then we have to hold similarly\nformed religious beliefs, formed on experiences of God manifesting\nhimself to a believer (Plantinga calls them \u2018M-beliefs\u2019),\nas properly basic. He proposed that human beings have a\nfaculty\u2014what John Calvin called the \u2018sensus\ndivinitatis\u2019\u2014that allows them to be aware of\nGod\u2019s actions or dispositions with respect to them. If beliefs\nformed by sense-experience can be properly basic, then beliefs formed\nby this faculty cannot, in any principled way, be denied that same\nstatus. His developed theory of warrant (2000) implies that, if the\nbeliefs are true, then they are warranted. One cannot attack claims of\nreligious experience without first addressing the question as to\nwhether the religious claims are true. He admits that, since there are\npeople in other religious traditions who have based beliefs about\nreligious matters on similar purported manifestations, they may be\nable to make the same argument about their own religious\nexperiences.\n\nAlston develops a general theory of doxastic practices (constellations\nof belief-forming mechanisms, together with characteristic background\nassumptions and sets of defeaters), gives an account of what it is to\nrationally engage in such a practice, and then argues that at least\nthe practice of forming beliefs on the basis of Christian religious\nexperiences fulfills those requirements. If we think of the broad\ndoxastic practices we currently employ, we see that some of them can\nbe justified by the use of other practices. The practice of science,\nfor example, reduces mostly to the practices of sense-perception,\ndeductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning (memory and testimony\nalso make contributions, of course). The justificatory status the\npractice gives to its product beliefs derives from those more basic\npractices. Most, however, cannot be so reduced. How are they\njustified, then? It seems that they cannot be justified\nnon-circularly, that is, without the use of premises derived from the\npractices themselves. Our only justification for continuing to trust\nthese practices is that they are firmly established, interwoven with\nother practices and projects of ours, and have \u201cstood the test\nof time\u201d by producing mostly consistent sets of beliefs. They\nproduce a sufficiently consistent set of beliefs if they don\u2019t\nproduce massive, unavoidable contradictions on central matters, either\ninternally, or with the outputs of other equally well-established\npractices. If that\u2019s all there is to be said about our ordinary\npractices, then we ought to extend the same status to other practices\nthat have the same features. He then argues that the Christian\npractice of belief-formation on the basis of religious experience does\nhave those features. Like Plantinga, he admits that such an argument\nmight be equally available to other religious practices; it all\ndepends on whether the practice in question generates massive and\nunavoidable contradictions, on central matters, either internally, or\nwith other equally well-established practices. To undermine this\nargument, one would have to show either that Alston\u2019s criteria\nfor rationality of a practice are too permissive, or that religious\npractices never escape massive contradictions.\n\nBoth Plantinga\u2019s and Alston\u2019s defense of the epistemic\nvalue of religious experiences turn crucially on some degree of\nsimilarity with sense-experience. But they are not simple arguments\nfrom analogy; not just any similarities will do to make the positive\nargument, and not just any dissimilarities will do to defeat the\nargument. The similarities or dissimilarities need to be\nepistemologically relevant. It is not enough, for example, to show\nthat religious experiences do not typically allow for independent\npublic verification, unless one wants to give up on other perfectly\nrespectable practices, like rational intuition, that also lack that\nfeature.\n\nThe two most important defeaters on the table for claims of the\nepistemic authority of religious experience are the fact of religious\ndiversity, and the availability of naturalistic explanations for\nreligious experiences. Religious diversity is a prima facie defeater\nfor the veridicality of religious experiences in the same way that\nwildly conflicting eyewitness reports undermine each other. If the\nreports are at all similar, then it may be reasonable to conclude that\nthere is some truth to the testimony, at least in broad outline. A\nversion of this objection is the argument from divine hiddenness (cf.\nLovering 2013). If God exists, and shows himself to some people in\nreligious experiences, then the fact that he doesn\u2019t do so for\nmore people, more widely distributed, requires some explanation.\nAxtell provides another version of that objection. He argues that to\ninsist that one\u2019s own religious convictions are true in the face of\nthe diversity of religions is to reason counter-inductively, and is\ntherefore irrational. The reasoning is counter-inductive because your\nown convictions come from the same kinds of epistemic sources\n(investment in testimonial authority) as those you deem to be wrong,\nso if you are right, it is just a matter of luck. But if two\neyewitness reports disagree on the most basic facts about what\nhappened, then it seems that neither gives you good grounds for any\nbeliefs about what happened. It certainly seems that the contents of\nreligious-experience reports are radically different from one another.\nSome subjects of religious experiences report experience of\nnothingness as the ultimate reality, some a vast impersonal\nconsciousness in which we all participate, some an infinitely perfect,\npersonal creator. To maintain that one\u2019s own religious\nexperiences are veridical, one would have to a) find some common core\nto all these experiences, such that in spite of differences of detail,\nthey could reasonably be construed as experiences of the same reality,\nor b) insist that one\u2019s own experiences are veridical, and that\ntherefore those of other traditions are not veridical. The first is\ndifficult to manage, in the face of the manifest differences across\nreligions. Nevertheless, John Hick (1989) develops a view of that\nkind, making use of a Kantian two-worlds epistemology. The idea is\nthat the object of these experiences, in itself, is one and the same\nreality, but it is experienced phenomenally by different people\ndifferently. Thus, is possible to see how one and the same object can\nbe experienced in ways that are completely incompatible with one\nanother. This approach is only as plausible as the Kantian framework\nitself is. Jerome Gellman (2001) proposes a similar idea, without the\nKantian baggage. Solutions like these leave the problem untouched: If\nthe different practices produce experiences the contents of which are\ninconsistent with one another, one of the practices must be\nunreliable. Alston (1991) and Plantinga (2000) develop the second kind\nof answer. The general strategy is to argue that, from within a\ntradition, a person acquires epistemic resources not available to\nthose outside the tradition, just as travelling to the heart of a\njungle allows one to see things that those who have not made the\njourney can\u2019t see. As a result, even if people in other\ntraditions can make the same argument, it is still reasonable to say\nthat some are right and the others are wrong. The things that justify\nmy beliefs still justify them, even if you have comparable resources\njustifying a contrary view.\n\nNaturalistic explanations for religious experiences are thought to\nundermine their epistemic value because, if the naturalistic\nexplanation is sufficient to explain the experience, we have no\ngrounds for positing anything beyond that naturalistic cause. Freud\n(1927) and Marx (1876/1977) are frequently held up as offering such\nexplanations. Freud claims that religious experiences can be\nadequately explained by psychological mechanisms having their root in\nearly childhood experience and psychodynamic tensions. Marx similarly\nattributes religious belief in general to materialistic economic\nforces. Both claim that, since the hidden psychological or economic\nexplanations are sufficient to explain the origins of religious\nbelief, there is no need to suppose, in addition, that the beliefs are\ntrue. Freud\u2019s theory of religion has few adherents, even among\nthe psychoanalytically inclined, and Marx\u2019s view likewise has\nall but been abandoned, but that is not to say that something in the\nneighborhood might not be true. More recently, neurological\nexplanations of religious experience have been put forward as reasons\nto deny the veridicality of the experiences. Events in the brain that\noccur during meditative states and other religious experiences are\nvery similar to events that happen during certain kinds of seizures,\nor with certain kinds of mental disorders, and can also be induced\nwith drugs. Therefore, it is argued, there is nothing more to\nreligious experiences than what happens in seizures, mental disorders,\nor drug experiences. Some who are studying the neurological basis of\nreligious experience do not infer that they are not veridical (see,\ne.g., d\u2019Aquili and Newberg 1999), but many do. Guthrie (1995),\nfor example, argues that religion has its origin in our tendency to\nanthropomorphize phenomena in our vicinity, seeing agency where there\nis none.\n\nThere are general problems with all kinds of naturalistic explanations\nas defeaters. First of all, as Gellman (2001) points out, most such\nexplanations (like the psychoanalytic and socio-political ones) are\nput forward as hypotheses, not as established facts. The proponent\nassumes that the experiences are not veridical, then casts around for\nan explanation. This is not true of the neurological explanations, but\nthey face another kind of weakness noted by Ellwood (1999):\nevery experience, whatever its source, is accompanied by a\ncorresponding neurological state. To argue that the experience is\nillusory because there is a corresponding brain state is fallacious.\nThe same reasoning would lead us to conclude that sensory experiences\nare illusory, since in each sensory experience, there is some\ncorresponding neurological state that is just like the state that\noccurs in the corresponding hallucination. The proponent of the\nnaturalistic explanation as a defeater owes us some reason to believe\nthat his or her argument is not just another skeptical argument from\nthe veil of perception.\n\nOne further epistemological worry accompanies religious experience.\nJames claimed that, while mystical experiences proved authoritative\ngrounds for belief in the person experiencing them, they cannot give\ngrounds for a person to whom the experience is reported. In other\nwords, my experience is evidence for me, but not for you. Bovens\n(2012) gives a modern expansion and explanation of this claim. The\nclaim can be understood in a variety of ways, depending on the kind of\nnormativity that attaches to the purported evidential relation. Some\n(see Oakes 1976, for example) have claimed that religious experiences\nepistemically can necessitate belief; that is, anyone who has the\nexperience and doesn\u2019t form the corresponding belief is making\nan epistemic mistake, much like a person who, in normal conditions,\nrefuses to believe his or her eyes. More commonly, defenders of the\nepistemic value of religious experience claim that the experiences\nmake it epistemically permissible to form the belief, but you may also\nbe justified in not forming the belief. The testimony of other people\nabout what they have experienced is much the same. In some cases, a\nperson would be unjustified in rejecting the testimony of others, and\nin other cases, one would be justified in accepting it, but need not\naccept it. This leaves us with three possibilities, on the assumption\nthat the subject of the experience is justified in forming a religious\nbelief on the basis of his or her experience, and that he or she tells\nsomeone else about it: the testimony might provide compelling evidence\nfor the hearer, such that he or she would be unjustified in rejecting\nthe claim; the testimony might provide non-compelling justification\nfor the hearer to accept the claim; or the testimony might fail to\nprovide any kind of grounds for the hearer to accept the claim. When a\nsubject makes a claim on the basis of an ordinary experience, it might\nfall into any one of these three categories, depending on the\nclaim\u2019s content and the epistemic situation of the hearer. The\nmost natural thing to say about religious experience claims is that\nthey work the same way (on the assumption that they give the subject\nof the experience, who is making the claim, any justification for his\nor her beliefs). James, and some others after him, claim that\ntestimony about religious experiences cannot fall under either of the\nfirst two categories. If that\u2019s true, it must be because of\nsomething special about the nature of the experiences. If we assume\nthat the experiences cannot be shown a priori to be defective\nsomehow, and that religious language is intelligible\u2014and if we\ndo not make these assumptions, then the question of religious\ntestimony doesn\u2019t even arise\u2014then it must be because the\nevidential value of the experience is so small that it cannot survive\ntransmission to another person; that is, it must be that in the\nordinary act of reporting an experience to someone else, there is some\ndefeater at work that is always stronger than whatever evidential\nforce the experience itself has. While there are important differences\nbetween ordinary sense-experience and religious experience (clarity of\nthe experience, amount of information it contains, presence of\ncompeting explanations, and the like), it is not clear whether the\ndifferences are great enough to disqualify religious testimony always\nand everywhere.\n4. The Diverse Objects of Religious Experience\n\nJust as there are a variety of religions, each with its own claims\nabout the nature of reality, there are a variety of objects and states\nof affairs that the subjects of these experiences claim to be aware\nof. Much analytic philosophy of religion has been done in Europe and\nthe nations descended from Europe, so much of the discussion has been\nin terms of God as conceived of in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic\ntraditions. In those traditions, the object of religious experiences\nis typically God himself, understood as an eternal, omniscient,\nomnipotent, free, and perfectly good spirit. God, for reasons of his\nown, reveals himself to people, some of them unbidden (like Moses,\nMuhammad, and Saint Paul), and some because they have undertaken a\nrigorous practice to draw closer to him (like the mystics). To say\nthat an experience comes unbidden is not to say that nothing the\nsubject has done has prepared her, or primed her, for the experience\n(see Luhrmann 2012); it is only to claim that the subject has not\nundertaken any practice aimed at producing a religious experience. In\nsuch experiences, God frequently delivers a message at the same time,\nbut he need not. He is always identifiable as the same being who\nrevealed himself to others in the same tradition. Other experiences\ncan be of angels, demons, saints, heaven, hell, or other religiously\nsignificant objects.\n\nIn other traditions, it is not necessarily a personal being who is the\nobject of the experience, or even a positive being at all. In the\ntraditions that find their origin in the Indian\nsubcontinent\u2014chiefly Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism\u2014the\nobject of religious experiences is some basic fact or feature of\nreality, rather than some entity separate from the universe. In the\northodox Hindu traditions, one may certainly have an experience of a\ngod or some other supernatural entity (like Arjuna\u2019s encounter\nwith Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita), but a great many important kinds\nof experiences are of Brahman, and its identity with the self. In\nYoga, which is based in the Samkhya understanding of the nature of\nthings, the mystical practice of yoga leads to a calming and stilling\nof the mind, which allows the yogi to apprehend directly that he or\nshe is not identical to, or even causally connected with, the physical\nbody, and this realization is what liberates him or her from\nsuffering.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, the goal of meditation is to \u201csee things\nas they are,\u201d which is to see them as unsatisfactory,\nimpermanent, and not-self (Gowans 2003, 191). The meditator, as he or\nshe makes progress along the way, sheds various delusions and\nattachments. The last one to go is the delusion that he or she is a\nself. To see this is to see all of reality as made up of sequences of\nmomentary events, each causally dependent on the ones that went\nbefore. There are no abiding substances, and no eternal souls. Seeing\nreality that way extinguishes the fires of craving, and liberates the\nmeditator from the necessity of rebirth (Laumakis 2008,\n158\u2013161). Seeing things as they are involves removing from the\nmind all the delusions that stand in the way of such seeing, which is\ndone by meditation practices that develop the meditator\u2019s\nmastery of his or her own mind. The type of meditation that brings\nthis mastery and allows the meditator to see the true nature of things\nis called Vipassana (insight) meditation. It typically\ninvolves some object of meditation, which can be some feature of the\nmeditator him- or herself, some feature of the physical or mental\nworld, or some abstraction, which then becomes the focus of the\nmeditator\u2019s concentration and examination. In the end, it is\nhoped, the meditator will see in the object the unsatisfactory and\nimpermanent nature of things and that there is no self to be found in\nthem. At the moment of that insight, nirvana is achieved.\nWhile the experience of nirvana is essentially the realization of a\nkind of insight, it is also accompanied by other experiential\nelements, especially of the cessation of negative mental states.\nNirvana is described in the Buddhist canon as the extinction of the\nfires of desire. The Theravada tradition teaches other kinds of\nmeditation that can help the meditator make progress, but the final\ngoal can\u2019t be achieved without vipassana\nmeditation.\n\nIn the Mahayana Buddhist traditions, this idea of the constantly\nfluctuating nature of the universe is extended in various ways. For\nsome, even those momentary events that make up the flow of the world\nare understood to be empty of inherent existence (the idea of inherent\nexistence is understood differently in different traditions) to the\npoint that what one sees in the enlightenment experience is the\nultimate emptiness (sunyata) of all things. In the Yogacara\nschool of Mahayana Buddhism, this is understood as emptiness of\nexternal existence; that is, to see things as they are is to see them\nas all mind-dependent. In the Zen school of Mahayana Buddhism, the\nenlightenment experience (kensho) reveals that reality\ncontains no distinctions or dualities. Since concepts and language\nalways involve distinctions, which always involve duality, the insight\nso gained cannot be achieved conceptually or expressed linguistically.\nIn all Mahayana schools, what brings enlightenment is direct\nrealization of sunyata as a basic fact about reality.\n\nThe situation is somewhat more complicated in the Chinese traditions.\nThe idea of religious experience seems to be almost completely absent\nin the Confucian tradition; the social world looms large, and the idea\nof an ultimate reality that needs to be experienced becomes much less\nprominent. Before the arrival of Buddhism in China, Confucianism was\nprimarily a political and ethical system, with no particular concern\nwith the transcendent (though people who identified themselves as\nConfucians frequently engaged in Chinese folk religious practices).\nNevertheless, meditation (and therefore something that could be called\n\u201creligious experience\u201d) did come to play a role in\nConfucian practice in the tenth century, as Confucian thought began to\nbe influenced by Buddhist and Daoist thought. The resulting view is\nknown as Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism retains the Mencian\ndoctrine that human beings are by nature good, but in need of\npurification. Since goodness resides in every person, then examination\nof oneself should reveal the nature of goodness, through the\nexperience of the vital force within (qi). The form of\nmeditation that arises from this line of thought (\u201cquiet\nsitting\u201d or \u201csitting and forgetting\u201d) are very like\nBuddhist vipassana meditation, but there is no value placed on any\nparticular insight gained, though one can experience the principle of\nunity (li) behind the world. Success is measured in gradual\nmoral improvement.\n\nThe Daoist ideal is to come to an understanding of the Dao, the\nfundamental nature of reality that explains all things in the world,\nand live according to it. Knowledge of the Dao is essential to the\ngood life, but this knowledge cannot be learned from discourses, or\ntransmitted by teaching. It is only known by experiential\nacquaintance. The Dao gives the universe a kind of grain, or flow,\ngoing against which causes human difficulty. The good human life is\nthen one that respects the flow of Dao, and goes along with it. This\nis what is meant by \u201clife in accordance with nature,\u201d and\nis the insight behind the Daoist admonition of wu wei,\nsometimes glossed as \u201cactionless action.\u201d By paying attention to\nreality as it presents itself, a person can learn what the Dao is,\nand can experience unity with it. This picture of reality, along with\nthe picture of how one can come to know it, heavily influenced the\ndevelopment of Ch\u2019an Buddhism, which became Zen.\n\nAll of the same epistemological problems that arise for theism will\nalso arise for these other traditions, though in different forms.\nThat is, one can ask of experiences of Brahman, Sunyata, the Dao, and\nanything else that is the object of religious experience whether there\nis any reason to think the experience is veridical. One can also ask\nwhether testimony about those experiences carries the same weight as\nordinary experience. Naturalistic explanations can also be offered to\nthese experiences. It is equally true that the responses that have\nbeen offered to these objections in a theistic context are also\navailable to defenders of non-theistic religious experience.\n",
