Retributivist Accounts\n\nWhereas consequentialist accounts regard punishment as justified\ninstrumentally, as a means to achieving some valuable goal (typically\ncrime reduction), retributivist accounts contend that punishment is\njustified as an intrinsically appropriate, because deserved, response\nto wrongdoing (but see Berman 2011 for an argument that some recent\nversions of retributivism actually turn it into a consequentialist\ntheory).\n\nTheorists have distinguished \u2018positive\u2019 and\n\u2018negative\u2019 forms of retributivism. Positive retributivism\nholds that an offender\u2019s desert provides a reason in favour of\npunishment; essentially, the state should punish those found guilty of\ncriminal offences to the extent that they deserve, because they\ndeserve it. Penal desert constitutes not just a necessary, but an\nin-principle sufficient reason for punishment (only in principle,\nhowever, since there are good reasons \u2014 to do with the costs,\nboth material and moral, of punishment \u2014 why we should not even\ntry to punish all the guilty). Negative retributivism, by contrast,\nprovides not a positive reason to punish, but rather a constraint on\npunishment: punishment should be imposed only on those who deserve it,\nand only in proportion with their desert. Because negative\nretributivism represents only a constraining principle, not a positive\nreason to punish, it has been employed in various mixed accounts of\npunishment, which endorse punishment for consequentialist reasons but\nonly insofar as the punishment is no more than is deserved (see s. 6\nbelow).\n\nA striking feature of penal theorising during the last three decades\nof the twentieth century was a revival of positive retributivism\n\u2014 of the idea that the positive justification of punishment is\nto be found in its intrinsic character as a deserved response to crime\n(see H. Morris 1968; N. Morris 1974; Murphy 1973; von Hirsch 1976; two\nuseful collections of contemporary papers on retributivism are White\n2011 and Tonry 2012).\n\nPositive retributivism comes in very different forms (Cottingham\n1979). All can be understood, however, as attempting to answer the two\ncentral questions faced by any retributivist theory of punishment.\nFirst, what is the justificatory relationship between crime and\npunishment that the idea of desert is supposed to capture: why do the\nguilty \u2018deserve to suffer\u2019 (see L. Davis 1972) \u2014 and\nwhat do they deserve to suffer (see Ardal 1984; Honderich 2005, ch.\n2)? Second, even if they deserve to suffer, or to be burdened in some\ndistinctive way, why should it be for the state to inflict that\nsuffering or that burden on them through a system of criminal\npunishment (Murphy 1985; Husak 1992 and 2015; Shafer-Landau 1996;\nWellman 2009)?\n\nOne retributivist answer to these questions is that crime involves\ntaking an unfair advantage over the law-abiding, and that punishment\nremoves that unfair advantage. The criminal law benefits all citizens\nby protecting them from certain kinds of harm: but this benefit\ndepends upon citizens accepting the burden of self-restraint involved\nin obeying the law. The criminal takes the benefit of the\nself-restraint of others but refuses to accept that burden herself:\nshe has gained an unfair advantage, which punishment removes by\nimposing some additional burden on her (see H. Morris 1968; Murphy\n1973; Sadurski 1985; Sher 1987, ch. 5; Adler 1992, chs. 5\u20138;\nDagger 1993, 2008, 2011; Stichter 2010; Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2017; for\ncriticism, see Burgh 1982; Duff 1986, ch. 8; Falls 1987; Dolinko 1991;\nAnderson 1997; Boonin 2008: 119\u2013143; Hoskins 2011b).\n\nThis kind of account does indeed answer the two questions noted above.\nWhat the criminal deserves to suffer is the loss of her unfair\nadvantage, and she deserves that because it is unfair that she should\nget away with taking the benefits of the law without accepting the\nburdens on which those benefits depend; it is the state\u2019s job to\ninflict this suffering on her, because it is the author or guarantor\nof the criminal law. However, such accounts have internal\ndifficulties: for instance, how are we to determine how great was the\nunfair advantage gained by a crime; how far are such measurements of\nunfair advantage likely to correlate with our judgements of the\nseriousness of crimes? (For a detailed defence of the \u2018unfair\nadvantage\u2019 theory as a theory of sentencing, see M. Davis 1992,\n1996; for criticism, see Scheid 1990, 1995; von Hirsch 1990.)\nFurthermore, they seem to misrepresent what it is about crime that\nmakes it deserving of punishment: what makes murder, or rape, or\ntheft, or assault a criminal wrong, deserving of punishment, is surely\nthe wrongful harm that it does to the individual victim \u2014 not\n(as on this kind of account) the supposed unfair advantage that the\ncriminal takes over all those who obey the law (for recent attempts to\ndefend fair play retributivism against these objections, see Stichter\n2010 and Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2017).\n\nA different retributivist account appeals not to the abstract notion\nof unfair advantage, but to our (normal, appropriate) emotional\nresponses to crime: for instance, to the resentment or\n\u2018retributive hatred\u2019, involving a desire to make the\nwrongdoer suffer, that crime may arouse (see Murphy and Hampton 1988,\nchs. 1, 3); or to the guilt, involving the judgement that I ought to\nbe punished, that my own wrongdoing would arouse in me (see Moore\n1997, ch. 4). Such accounts try to answer the first of the two\nquestions noted above: crime deserves punishment in the sense that it\nmakes appropriate certain emotions (resentment, guilt) which are\nsatisfied by or expressed in punishment. They do not yet show,\nhowever, why it should be the state\u2019s task to satisfy or provide\nformal expression for such emotions (but see Stephen 1873: 152); and\ntheir answers to the first question are also problematic. Criminal\nwrongdoing should, we can agree, provoke certain kinds of emotion,\nsuch as self-directed guilt and other-directed indignation; and such\nemotions might typically involve a desire to make those at whom they\nare directed suffer. But just as we can agree that anger is an\nappropriate response to wrongs done to me, while also arguing that we\nshould resist the desire to hit back that anger often, even typically,\ninvolves (see Horder 1992:194\u20137), so we could argue that\nalthough guilt, resentment and indignation are appropriate responses\nto our own and others\u2019 wrongdoing, we should resist the desire\nfor suffering that they so often involve. At the least we need to know\nmore than we are told by these accounts about just what wrongdoers\ndeserve to suffer, and why the infliction of suffering should be an\nappropriate way to express such proper emotions. (For critical\ndiscussions of Murphy, see Murphy and Hampton 1988, ch. 2; Duff 1996:\n29\u201331; Murphy 1999. On Moore, see Dolinko 1991: 555\u20139;\nKnowles 1993; Murphy 1999. See also Murphy 2003, 2012.)\n\nMore recently, critics of emotion-based retributivist accounts have\ncontended that the emotions on which retributive (and other\ndeontological) intuitions are based have evolved as mechanisms to\nstabilise cooperation; given that we have retributive emotions only\nbecause of their evolutionary fitness, it would be merely a\ncoincidence if intuitions based on these emotions happened to track\nmoral truths about, e.g., desert (see especially Greene 2008; also\nSinger 2005). A problem with such accounts is that they appear to\nprove too much: consequentialist accounts also rely on certain\nevaluation intuitions (about what has value, or about the proper way\nto respond to that which we value); insofar as such intuitions are\nnaturally selected, then it would be no less coincidental if they\ntracked moral truths than if retributive intuitions did so. Thus the\nconsequentialist accounts that derive from these intuitions would be\nsimilarly undermined by this evolutionary argument (see Kahane 2011;\nMason 2011; but see Wiegman 2017).\n\nA third version of retributivism holds that when people commit a\ncrime, they thereby incur a moral debt to their victims, and\npunishment is deserved as a way to pay this debt (McDermott 2001).\nThis moral debt differs from the material debt that an offender may\nincur, and thus payment of the material debt (returning stolen money\nor property, etc.) does not settle the moral debt: punishment is\nneeded to pay the moral debt, by denying the ill-gotten moral good to\nthe perpetrator. Among the challenges for this account are to explain\nthe nature of the moral good, how the offender takes this moral good\nfrom the victim, how punishment denies this good to the offender, and\nhow doing so thereby pays the offender\u2019s debt to the victim.\n",
