    "main_text": "Neuroscience of Generic Consciousness: Unconscious Vision as Case Study || Blindsight\n4.2 Blindsight\n\nA second neuropsychological phenomenon also highlighting putative\nunconscious vision is blindsight which results from lesions\nin primary visual cortex (V1) typically leading to blindness over the\npart of visual space contralateral to the sight of the lesion\n(Weiskrantz 1986). For example, left hemisphere V1 deals with right\nvisual space, so lesions in left V1 lead to deficits in seeing the\nright side of space. Subjects then report that they cannot see a\nvisual stimulus in the affected visual space. Strikingly, these\nclinically blind subjects can draw on information from the\n\u201cunseen\u201d stimulus to visually inform behavior regarding\nit, often in striking ways. For example, a blindsight patient with\nbilateral damage to V1 (i.e., in both hemispheres) who is blind across\nthe visual field can walk down a hallway around obstacles he reports\nbeing unable to see (Gelder et al. 2008). Blindsight patients see in\nthe sense of visually discriminating the stimulus to act on it yet\ndeny that they see it. The contrast between behavior and report leads\nto the paradoxical term, \u201cblindsight\u201d. Like DF,\nblindsighters show a dissociation between certain actions and report,\nbut unlike DF, they do not spontaneously respond to relevant features\nbut must be encouraged to generate behaviors towards\n them.[11]\n\nThe neuroanatomical basis of blindsight capacities remains unclear.\nCertainly, the loss of V1 deprives later cortical visual areas of a\nnormal source of visual information. Still, there are other ways that\ninformation from the eye bypasses V1 to provide inputs to later visual\nareas. Alternative pathways include the superior colliculus (SC), the\nlateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus, and the pulvinar as\nlikely sources.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Subcortical Pathways and their\nConnection to Cortical Vision (from Urbanski, Coubard, &\nBourlon 2014)\n\nFigure Legend: The front of the head is to the left, the back of the\nhead is to the right. One should imagine that the blue-linked regions\nare above the orange-linked regions, cortex above subcortex. V4 is\nassigned to the base of the ventral stream; V5, called area MT in\nnonhuman primates, is assigned to the base of the dorsal stream.\n\n\nThe latter two have direct extrastriate projections\n(projections to visual areas in the occipital lobe outside of V1)\nwhile the superior colliculus synapses onto neurons in the LGN and\npulvinar which then connect to extrastriate areas (Figure 3). Which of\nthese provide for the basis for blindsight remains an open question\nthough all pathways might play some role (Cowey 2010; Leopold 2012).\nIf blindsight involves nonphenomenal, unconscious vision, then these\npathways would be a substrate for it, and a functioning V1 might be\nnecessary for normal conscious vision.\n\nCampion et al. (1983) raised an important alternative explanation:\nblindsight subjects in fact have severely degraded conscious vision\nbut merely report on them with low confidence. In their reports,\nblindsight subjects feel like they are guessing about stimuli they can\nobjectively discriminate. Campion et al. drew on signal detection\ntheory, which emphasizes two determinants of detection behavior:\nperceptual sensitivity and response criterion. A\nsubject\u2019s ability to visually detect a signal will depend partly\non how well her visual system extracts the signal from noise (sensitivity) but also\non the criterion that is set as a threshold for response. Consider\ntrying to detect something moving in the brush at twilight versus at\nnoon. In the latter, the signal will be greatly separated from noise\n(the object will be easier to detect) while in the former, the signal\nwill not be (the object will be harder to detect). Yet in either case,\none might operate with a conservative response criterion, say because\none is afraid to be wrong. Thus, even if the signal is detectable, one\nmight still opt not to report on it given a conservative\nbias (criterion), say if one is in the twilight scenario and would be ridiculed\nfor \u201cfalse alarms\u201d, i.e., claiming the object to be\npresent when it is not.\n\nCampion et al. hypothesized that blindsight patients are conscious in\nthat they are aware of visual signal where discriminability is low\n(cf. the twilight condition). Further, blindsight patients are more\nconservative in their response so will be apt to report the absence of\na signal by saying that they do not see the relevant stimulus even\nthough the signal is there, and they can detect it, as verified by\ntheir above chance visually guided behavior. This possibility was\nexplicitly tested by Azzopardi and Cowey (1997) with the well-studied\nblindsight patient, GY. They compared blindsight performance with\nnormal subjects at threshold vision using signal detection measures\nand found that with respect to motion stimuli, the difference between\ndiscrimination and detection used to argue for blindsight can be\nexplained by changes in response criterion, as Campion et al.\nhypothesized. That is, GYs claim that he does not see the stimulus is\ndue to a conservative criterion and not to a detection incapacity.\nInterestingly, for static stimuli, his response criterion did not\nchange but his sensitivity did, as if he was tapping into two\ndifferent visual processing mechanisms in each task (for an\nalternative explanation based on shifting response criterion, see Ko\n& Lau 2012).\n\nIn introspecting, what concepts are available to subjects will\ndetermine their sensitivity in report. In many studies with\nblindsight, subjects are given a binary option: do you see the\nstimulus or do you not see it? The concern is that the do not\nsee option would cover cases of degraded consciousness that\nsubjects might be unwilling to classify as seeing due to a conservative\nresponse criterion. So, what if subjects are given more options for\nreport? Rams\u00f8y and Overgaard (2004; see also Overgaard et al.\n2006) provided subjects with four categories for introspective report:\nno experience; brief glimpse; almost clear experience; clear\nexperience. Using this perceptual awareness scale, they\nfound that subjects\u2019 objective performance tracked their\nintrospective reports where performance was at chance when subjects\nreported no visual experience. As visibility increased, so did\nperformance. When the scale was used with a blindsight patient\n(Overgaard et al. 2008), no above chance performance was detected when\nthe subject reported no visual experience (see also Mazzi, Bagattini,\n& Savazzi 2016 for further evidence). A live alternative\nhypothesis is that blindsight does not present a case of unconscious\nvision, but of degraded conscious vision with a conservative response\nbias that affects introspection. At the very least, the issue depends\non how introspection is deployed, a topic that deserves further\nattention (see Phillips 2016 for further discussion of\nblindsight).\n",
