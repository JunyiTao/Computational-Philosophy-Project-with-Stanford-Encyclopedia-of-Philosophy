    "main_text": "\n\nDefinitions have interested philosophers since ancient times.\nPlato\u2019s early dialogues portray Socrates raising questions about\ndefinitions (e.g., in the Euthyphro, \u201cWhat is\npiety?\u201d)\u2014questions that seem at once profound and elusive.\nThe key step in Anselm\u2019s \u201cOntological Proof\u201d for the\nexistence of God is the definition of \u201cGod,\u201d and the same\nholds of Descartes\u2019s version of the argument in his\nMeditation V. More recently, the Frege-Russell definition of\nnumber and Tarski\u2019s definition of truth have exercised a\nformative influence on a wide range of contemporary philosophical\ndebates. In all these cases\u2014and many others can be\ncited\u2014not only have particular definitions been debated; the\nnature of, and demands on, definitions have also been debated. Some of\nthese debates can be settled by making requisite distinctions, for\ndefinitions are not all of one kind: definitions serve a variety of\nfunctions, and their general character varies with function. Some\nother debates, however, are not so easily settled, as they involve\ncontentious philosophical ideas such as essence, concept, and\nmeaning.\n",
