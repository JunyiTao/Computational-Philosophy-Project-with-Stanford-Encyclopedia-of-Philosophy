    "main_text": "Mathematical Tools: Models and Proofs || Between models and proofs\n3.3 Between models and proofs\n\nThe proof-theoretic and model-theoretic perspectives have been\nconsidered as providing rival accounts of logical consequence.\nHowever, one can also view \u201clogical consequence\u201d and\n\u201cvalidity\u201d as expressing cluster concepts:\n\u201cA number of different, closely related notions go by those\nnames. They invoke matters of modality, meaning, effectiveness,\njustification, rationality, and form\u201d (Shapiro 2014). One can\nalso note that the division between the model-theoretic and the\nproof-theoretic perspectives is a modern one, and it was only made\npossible when tools for metamathematical investigations were\ndeveloped. Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift, for instance, which\npredates the development of those tools, is formulated as an axiomatic\nproof system, but the meanings of the connectives are given via truth\nconditions.\n\nOnce there are two different analyses of a relation of logical\nconsequence, one can ask about possible interactions, and we\u2019ll\ndo that next. One can also ask what general features such a relation\nhas independently of its analysis as proof-theoretic or\nmodel-theoretic. One way of answering this question goes back to\n Tarski,\n who introduced the notion of consequence operations. For our\npurposes, we note only some features of such operations. Let\n\\(Cn(X)\\) be the consequences of \\(X\\). (One can think of\nthe operator \\(Cn\\) as deriving from a prior consequence relation\nwhich, when taking \\(X\\) as \u2018input (or premise)\u2019 set,\ntells you what follows from \\(X\\). But one can also see the\n\u2018process\u2019 in reverse, and a key insight is that\nconsequence relations and corresponding operations are, in effect,\ninterdefinable. See the entry on\n algebraic propositional logic\n for details.) Among some of the minimal conditions one might impose\non a consequence relation are the following two (from Tarski):\n\n\\(X\\) is a subset of \\(Cn(X)\\).\n\\(Cn(Cn(X)) = Cn(X)\\).\n\n\nIf you think of \\(X\\) as a set of claims, then the first\ncondition tells you that the consequences of a set of claims includes\nthe claims themselves. The second condition demands that the\nconsequences of \\(X\\) just are the consequences of the\nconsequences of \\(X\\). Both of these conditions can be motivated\nfrom reflection on the model-theoretic and proof-theoretic approaches;\nand there are other such conditions too. (For a general discussion,\nsee the entry on\n algebraic propositional logic.)\n But as with many foundation issues (e.g., \u2018what are the\nessential features of consequence relations in general?\u2019), even\nsuch minimal conditions are contentious in philosophical logic and the\nphilosophy of logic. For example, some might take condition (2) to be\nobjectionable on the grounds that, for reasons of vagueness (or more),\nimportant consequence relations over natural languages (however\nformalized) are not generally transitive in ways reflected in (2).\n(See Tennant 1994, Cobreros et al 2012, and Ripley 2013, for\nphilosophical motivations against transitive consequence.) But we\nleave these issues for more advanced discussion.\n\nWhile the philosophical divide between Realists and Anti-realists\nremains vast, proof-centered and model-centered accounts of\nconsequence have been united (at least with respect to extension) in\nmany cases. The great soundness and completeness theorems for\ndifferent proof systems (or, from the other angle, for different\nmodel-theoretic semantics) show that, in an important sense, the two\napproaches often coincide, at least in extension. A proof system is\nsound with respect to a model-theoretic semantics if every\nargument that has a proof in the system is model-theoretically valid.\nA proof system is complete with respect to a model-theoretic\nsemantics if every model-theoretically valid argument has a proof in\nthe system. While soundness is a principal condition on any proof\nsystem worth its name, completeness cannot always be expected.\nAdmittedly, these definitions are biased towards the model-theoretic\nperspective: the model-theoretic semantic sets the standard to what is\n\u201csound\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d. Leaving terminological\nissues aside, if a proof system is both sound and complete with\nrespect to a model-theoretic semantics (as, significantly, in the case\nof first order predicate logic), then the proof system and the\nmodel-theoretic semantics agree on which arguments are valid.\n\nCompleteness results can also support the adequacy of the\nmodel-theoretic account, as in Kreisel\u2019s \u201csqueezing\nargument\u201d. We have noted a weakness of the model-theoretic\naccount: all models are sets, and so it might be that no model\nrepresents the actual world. Kreisel has shown that if we have a proof\nsystem that is \u201cintuitively sound\u201d and is complete with\nrespect to the model-theoretic semantics, we won\u2019t be missing\nany models: every intuitively valid argument will have a\ncounter-model. Let \\(L\\) be a first order language. Let \\(Val\\) denote\nthe set of intuitively valid arguments in \\(L\\). Kreisel takes\nintuitive validity to be preservation of truth across all structures\n(whether sets or not). His analysis privileges the modal analysis of\nlogical consequence\u2014but note that the weakness we are addressing\nis that considering set-theoretic structures might not be enough. Let\n\\(V\\) denote the set of model-theoretic validities in \\(L\\): arguments\nthat preserve truth over models. Let \\(D\\) be the set of deductively\nvalid arguments, by some accepted proof system for first order\nlogic. Now, any such proof system is \u201cintuitively sound\u201d,\nmeaning that what is deductively valid by the system is intuitively\nvalid. This gives us \\(D \\subseteq Val\\). And obviously, by the\ndefinitions we\u2019ve given, \\(Val \\subseteq V\\), since an\nargument that preserves truth over all structures will preserve truth\nover set-structures.\n\nBy the completeness result for first order logic, we have: \\(V\\)\n\u2286 \\(D\\). Putting the three inclusions together (the\n\u201csqueeze\u201d), we get that all three sets must be equal, and\nin particular: \\(V = Val\\). In this way, we\u2019ve proven\nthat if there is some structure that is a counterexample to a first\norder argument, then there is a set-theoretic one.\n\nAnother arena for the interaction between the proof-theoretic and the\nmodel-theoretic perspectives has to do with the definition of the\nlogical vocabulary. For example, one can hold a \u201cmoderate\u201d\ninferentialist view which defines the meanings of logical connectives\nthrough their semantics (i.e. truth conditions) but demands that the\nmeaning of a connective be determined by inference rules. Carnap has\nfamously shown that the classical inference rules allow non-standard\ninterpretations of the logical expressions (Carnap 1943). Much recent\nwork in the field has been devoted to the exact nature and extent of\nCarnap\u2019s categoricity problem (Raatikainen 2008, Murzi and\nHjortland 2009, Woods 2012, Garson 2013, Peregrin 2014, Bonnay and\nWesterst\u00e5hl 2016. See also the entry on\n sentence connectives in formal logic).\n\nFinally, we should note that while model theory and proof theory are\nthe most prominent contenders for the explication of logical\nconsequence, there are alternative frameworks for formal semantics\nsuch as\n algebraic semantics,\n game-theoretic semantics and\n dynamic semantics\n (see Wansig 2000).\n",
