    "main_text": "Logically and Philosophically Motivated Variations || Constructive set theory\n8.1 Constructive set theory\n\nThere are a number of attempts at constructive (intuitionistic)\ntheories of types and set theories. We will describe a few systems\nhere, quite briefly as we are not expert in constructive\nmathematics.\n\nAn intuitionistic typed theory of sets is readily obtained by simply\nadopting the intuitionistic versions of the axioms of TST as\naxioms. An Axiom of Infinity would be wanted to ensure that an\ninterpretation of Heyting arithmetic could be embedded in the theory;\nit might be simplest to provide type 0 with the primitives of Heyting\narithmetic (just as the earliest versions of TST had the\nprimitives of classical arithmetic provided for type 0). We believe\nthat this would give a quite comfortable environment for doing\nconstructive mathematics.\n\nDaniel Dzierzgowski has gone so far as to study an intuitionistic\nversion of NF constructed in the same way; all that we can\nusefully report here is that it is not clear that the resulting theory\nINF is as strong as NF (in particular, it is unclear\nwhether INF interprets Heyting Arithmetic, because\nSpecker\u2019s proof of Infinity in NF does not seem to go\nthrough in any useful way) but the consistency problem for\nINF remains open in spite of the apparent weakness of the\ntheory.\n\nA more ambitious theory is IZF (intuitionistic ZF).\nAn interesting feature of the development of IZF is that one\nmust be very careful in one\u2019s choice of axioms: some\nformulations of the axioms of set theory have (constructively\ndeducible) consequences which are not considered constructively valid\n(such as Excluded Middle), while other (classically equivalent)\nformulations of the axioms appear not to have such consequences: the\nlatter forms, obviously to be preferred for a constructive development\nof set theory, often are not the most familiar ones in the classical\ncontext.\n\nA set of axioms which seems to yield a nontrivial system of\nconstructive mathematics is the following:\n\n\nExtensionality: in the usual ZF form.\n\nPairing, Union, Power Set, Infinity: in the usual\nZF form.\n\nCollection: We are not sure why this is often\npreferred in constructive set theory, as it seems to us less\nconstructive than replacement? But we have heard it said that\nReplacement is constructively quite weak.\n\n\\(\\in\\)-Induction: The induction on membership form\nis preferred for a highly practical reason: more usual formulations of\nFoundation immediately imply the Axiom of Excluded Middle!\n\n\nSee Friedman 1973 and\n Other Internet Resources\n for further information about IZF.\n\nAs is often the case in constructive mathematics generally, very\nsimple notions of classical set theory (such as the notion of an\nordinal) require careful reformulation to obtain the appropriate\ndefinition for the constructive environment (and the formulations\noften appear more complicated than familiar ones to the classical\neye). Being inexpert, we will not involve ourselves further in this.\nIt is worth noting that IZF, like many but not all\nconstructive systems, admits a double negation interpretation of the\ncorresponding classical theory ZF; we might think of\nIZF as a weakened version of ZF from the classical\nstandpoint, but in its own terms it is the theory of a larger, more\ncomplex realm in which a copy of the classical universe of set theory\nis embedded.\n\nThe theories we have described so far are criticized by some\nconstructive mathematicians for allowing an unrestricted power set\noperation. A weaker system CZF (constructive ZF has\nbeen proposed which does not have this operation (and which has the\nsame level of strength as the weak set theory KPU without\nPower Set described earlier).\n\nCZF omits Power Set. It replaces Foundation with\n\\(\\in\\)-Induction for the same reasons as above. The axioms of\nExtensionality, Pairing, and Union are as in ordinary set theory. The\naxiom of Separation is restricted to bounded \\((\\Delta_0)\\) formulas\nas in Mac Lane set theory or KPU.\n\nThe Collection axiom is replaced by two weaker axioms.\n\nThe Strong Collection axiom scheme asserts that if for every \\(x \\in\nA\\) there is \\(y\\) such that \\(\\phi (x, y)\\), then there is a set\n\\(B\\) such that for every \\(x \\in A\\) there is \\(y \\in B\\) such that\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\) (as in the usual scheme) but also for every \\(y \\in B\\)\nthere is \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) (\\(B\\) doesn\u2019t\ncontain any redundant elements). The additional restriction is useful\nbecause of the weaker form of the Separation Axiom.\n\nThe Subset Collection scheme can be regarded as containing a very weak\nform of Power Set. It asserts, for each formula \\(\\phi(x, y, z)\\) that\nfor every \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there is a set \\(C\\) such that for each\n\\(z\\) such that \\(\\forall x \\in A\\exists y \\in B[\\phi(x, y, z)\\)]\nthere is \\(R_z \\in C\\) such that for every \\(x \\in A\\) there is \\(y\n\\in R_z\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y, z)\\) and for every \\(y \\in\nR_z\\) there is \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y, z)\\) (this is the\nsame restriction as in the Strong Collection axiom; notice that not\nonly are images under the relation constructed, but the images are\nfurther collected into a set).\n\nThe Subset Collection scheme is powerful enough to allow the\nconstruction of the set of all functions from a set \\(A\\) to a set\n\\(B\\) as a set (which suggests that the classical version of this\ntheory is as strong as ZF, since the existence of the set of\nfunctions from \\(A\\) to \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) is classically as strong as the\nexistence of the power set of \\(A\\), and strong collection should\nallow the proof of strong separation in a classical environment).\n\nThis theory is known to be at the same level of consistency strength\nas the classical set theory KPU. It admits an interpretation\nin Martin-L\u00f6f constructive type theory (as IZF does\nnot).\n\nSee Aczel (1978, 1982, 1986) for further information about this\ntheory.\n",
