    "main_text": "Classical Compatibilism\n2. Classical Compatibilism\n\nCompatibilism\u2019s place in contemporary philosophy has developed\nin at least three stages. The first stage involves the classical form\nof compatibilism, which was developed in the modern era by the\nempiricists Hobbes and Hume, and reinvigorated in the early part of\nthe twentieth century. The second stage involves three distinct\ncontributions in the 1960s, contributions that challenged many of the\ndialectical presuppositions driving classical compatibilism. The third\nstage involves various contemporary forms of compatibilism, forms that\ndiverge from the classical variety and that emerged out of, or\nresonate with, at least one of the three contributions found in the\nsecond transitional stage. This section is devoted to the first stage,\nthat of classical compatibilism.\n",
