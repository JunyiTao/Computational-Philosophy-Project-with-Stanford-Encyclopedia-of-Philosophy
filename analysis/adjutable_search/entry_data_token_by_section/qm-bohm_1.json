The Impossibility of Hidden Variables \u2026 or the Inevitability of Nonlocality?\n\nJohn von Neumann, one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth\ncentury, claimed that he had proven that Einstein\u2019s dream of a\ndeterministic completion or reinterpretation of quantum theory was\nmathematically impossible. He concluded that \n\n\nIt is therefore not, as is often assumed, a question of a\nre-interpretation of quantum mechanics\u2014the present system of\nquantum mechanics would have to be objectively false, in order that\nanother description of the elementary processes than the statistical\none be possible. (von Neumann [1932] 1955: 325) \n\n\nPhysicists and philosophers of science almost universally accepted von\nNeumann\u2019s claim. (The philosopher Grete Hermann was a notable exception.) For example, Max Born, who formulated the\nstatistical interpretation of the wave function, assured us that \n\n\nNo concealed parameters can be introduced with the help of which the\nindeterministic description could be transformed into a deterministic\none. Hence if a future theory should be deterministic, it cannot be a\nmodification of the present one but must be essentially different.\n(Born 1949: 109) \n\n\nBohmian mechanics is a counterexample to the claims of von Neumann and Born.\nThus von Neumann\u2019s argument must be wrong. In fact, according to\nJohn Bell, von Neumann\u2019s assumptions (about the relationships\namong the values of quantum observables that must be satisfied in a\nhidden-variables theory, see Bell 1966) are so unreasonable that the \u201cthe proof\nof von Neumann is not merely false but foolish!\u201d\n(Mermin 1993: 805, fn 8, quoting an interview in Omni, May,\n1988: 88). Nonetheless, some physicists continue to rely on von\nNeumann\u2019s proof. \n\nRecently, however, physicists more commonly cite the\n Kochen-Specker Theorem\n and, even more frequently,\n Bell\u2019s inequality\n in support of the contention that a deterministic completion of\nquantum theory is impossible. We still find, a quarter of a century\nafter the rediscovery of Bohmian mechanics in 1952, statements such as\nthese:\n\n\nThe proof he [von Neumann] published \u2026, though it was made much\nmore convincing later on by Kochen and Specker (1967), still uses\nassumptions which, in my opinion, can quite reasonably be questioned.\n\u2026 In my opinion, the most convincing argument against the\ntheory of hidden variables was presented by J.S. Bell (1964). (Wigner\n[1976] 1983: 291) \n\n\nNow there are many more statements of a similar character that we\ncould cite. This quotation is significant because Wigner was one of\nthe leading physicists of his generation. Unlike most of his\ncontemporaries, moreover, he was also profoundly concerned about the\nconceptual foundations of quantum mechanics and wrote on the subject\nwith great clarity and insight.\n\nThere was, however, one physicist who wrote on this subject with even\ngreater clarity and insight than Wigner himself: the very J. S. Bell\nwhom Wigner praises for demonstrating the impossibility of a\ndeterministic completion of quantum theory such as Bohmian mechanics.\nHere\u2019s how Bell himself reacted to Bohm\u2019s discovery:\n\n\nBut in 1952 I saw the impossible done. It was in papers by David\nBohm. Bohm showed explicitly how parameters could indeed be\nintroduced, into nonrelativistic wave mechanics, with the help of\nwhich the indeterministic description could be transformed into a\ndeterministic one. More importantly, in my opinion, the subjectivity\nof the orthodox version, the necessary reference to the\n\u201cobserver\u201d, could be eliminated. \u2026\n\nBut why then had Born not told me of this \u201cpilot wave\u201d? If\nonly to point out what was wrong with it? Why did von Neumann not\nconsider it? More extraordinarily, why did people go on producing\n\u201cimpossibility\u201d proofs, after 1952, and as recently as\n1978? \u2026 Why is the pilot wave picture ignored in text books?\nShould it not be taught, not as the only way, but as an antidote to\nthe prevailing complacency? To show us that vagueness, subjectivity,\nand indeterminism, are not forced on us by experimental facts, but by\ndeliberate theoretical choice? (Bell 1982, reprinted in 1987c: 160) \n\n\nWigner to the contrary notwithstanding, Bell did not establish the\nimpossibility of a deterministic reformulation of quantum theory, nor\ndid he ever claim to have done so. On the contrary, until his untimely\ndeath in 1990, Bell was the prime proponent, and for much of this\nperiod almost the sole proponent, of the very theory, Bohmian\nmechanics, that he supposedly demolished.\n\nBohmian mechanics is of course as much a counterexample to the\nKochen-Specker argument for the impossibility of hidden variables as\nit is to the one of von Neumann. It is obviously a counterexample to\nany such argument. However reasonable the assumptions of such an\nargument may be, some of them must fail for Bohmian mechanics.\n\nWigner was quite right to suggest that the assumptions of Kochen and\nSpecker are more convincing than those of von Neumann. They appear, in\nfact, to be quite reasonable indeed. However, they are not. The\nimpression that they are arises from a pervasive error, an uncritical\nrealism about operators, that we discuss below in the sections on\n quantum observables,\n spin, and\n contextuality.\n\nJohn Bell replaced the \u201carbitrary axioms\u201d (Bell 1966,\nreprinted 1987c: 11) of Kochen-Specker and others by an assumption of\nlocality, of no action-at-a-distance. It would be hard to argue\nagainst the reasonableness of such an assumption, even if one were so\nbold as to doubt its inevitability. Bell showed that any\nhidden-variables formulation of quantum mechanics must be nonlocal,\nas, indeed, Bohmian mechanics is. But he showed much much more. (For\nmore detail on Bell\u2019s locality assumption, see Goldstein et al.\n2011 and Norsen 2011.) \n\nIn a celebrated paper he published in 1964, Bell showed that quantum\ntheory itself is irreducibly nonlocal. (More precisely, Bell\u2019s\nanalysis applies to any single-world version of quantum theory, i.e.,\nany version for which measurements have outcomes that, while they may\nbe random, are nonetheless unambiguous and definite, in contrast to\nthe situation with Everett\u2019s many-worlds version of quantum\ntheory.) This fact about quantum mechanics, based as it is on a short\nand mathematically simple analysis, could have been recognized soon\nafter the discovery of quantum theory in the 1920\u2019s. That this\ndid not happen is no doubt due in part to the obscurity of\n orthodox quantum theory\n and to the ambiguity of its commitments. (It almost did happen:\nSchr\u00f6dinger 1935, in his famous cat paper, came remarkably close\nto discovering a Bell-type argument for quantum nonlocality. For\ndetails see Hemmick and Shakur 2012, chapter 4.) It was, in fact, his\nexamination of Bohmian mechanics that led Bell to his nonlocality\nanalysis. In the course of investigating Bohmian mechanics, he\nobserved that:\n\n\nin this theory an explicit causal mechanism exists whereby the\ndisposition of one piece of apparatus affects the results obtained\nwith a distant piece. \u2026\n\nBohm of course was well aware of these features of his scheme, and has\ngiven them much attention. However, it must be stressed that, to the\npresent writer\u2019s knowledge, there is no proof that\nany hidden variable account of quantum mechanics\nmust have this extraordinary character. It would therefore be\ninteresting, perhaps, to pursue some further \u201cimpossibility\nproofs\u201d, replacing the arbitrary axioms objected to above by\nsome condition of locality, or of separability of distant systems.\n(Bell 1966: 452; reprinted 1987c: 11) \n\n\nIn a footnote, Bell added that \u201cSince the completion of this\npaper such a proof has been found\u201d (1966: 452, fn. 19). He\npublished it in his 1964 paper, \u201cOn the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nParadox\u201d. In this paper he derives Bell\u2019s inequality, the\nbasis of his conclusion of quantum nonlocality. (See the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem.\n For a discussion of how nonlocality emerges in Bohmian mechanics, see\n Section 13.)\n\nIt is worth stressing that Bell\u2019s analysis indeed shows that any\n(single-world) account of quantum phenomena must be nonlocal, not just\nany hidden variables account. Bell showed that the predictions of\nstandard quantum theory itself imply nonlocality. Thus if these\npredictions govern nature, then nature is nonlocal. [That nature is so\ngoverned, even in the crucial EPR-correlation experiments, has by now\nbeen established by a great many experiments. The first rather\nconclusive such experiment was that of Aspect (Aspect, Dalibard, &\nRoger 1982). More conclusive still is the experiment of Weihs\net al. 1998. Very recently there have been several \u201cloop-hole\nfree\u201d tests of Bell\u2019s inequality (Giustina et al. 2015;\nHensen et al. 2015; and Shalm et al. 2015. See also the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem.).]\n\nBell, too, stressed this point (by determinism Bell here means hidden\nvariables):\n\n\nIt is important to note that to the limited degree to which\ndeterminism plays a role in the EPR argument, it is not\nassumed but inferred. What is held sacred is the principle of\n\u201clocal causality\u201d\u2014or \u201cno action at a\ndistance\u201d\u2026\n\nIt is remarkably difficult to get this point across, that determinism\nis not a presupposition of the analysis. (Bell 1981a,\nreprinted 1987c: 143)\n\nDespite my insistence that the determinism was inferred rather than\nassumed, you might still suspect somehow that it is a preoccupation\nwith determinism that creates the problem. Note well then that the\nfollowing argument makes no mention whatever of determinism. \u2026\nFinally you might suspect that the very notion of particle, and\nparticle orbit \u2026 has somehow led us astray. \u2026 So the\nfollowing argument will not mention particles, nor indeed fields, nor\nany other particular picture of what goes on at the microscopic level.\nNor will it involve any use of the words \u201cquantum mechanical\nsystem\u201d, which can have an unfortunate effect on the discussion.\nThe difficulty is not created by any such picture or any such\nterminology. It is created by the predictions about the correlations\nin the visible outputs of certain conceivable experimental set-ups.\n(Bell 1981a, reprinted 1987c: 150) \n\n\nThe \u201cproblem\u201d and \u201cdifficulty\u201d to which Bell\nrefers above is the conflict between the predictions of quantum theory\nand what can be inferred, call it \\(C\\), from an assumption of\nlocality in Bohm\u2019s version of the EPR argument, a conflict\nestablished by Bell\u2019s inequality. \\(C\\) happens to concern the\nexistence of a certain kind of hidden variables, what might be called\nlocal hidden variables, but this fact is of little substantive\nimportance. What is important is not so much the identity of \\(C\\) as\nthe fact that \\(C\\) is incompatible with the predictions of quantum\ntheory. The identity of \\(C\\) is, however, of great historical\nsignificance: it is responsible for the misconception that Bell proved\nthat hidden variables are impossible, a belief that physicists until\nrecently almost universally shared, as well as for the view, even now\nalmost universally held, that what Bell\u2019s result does is to rule\nout local hidden variables, a view that is misleading.\n\nHere again is Bell, expressing the logic of his two-part\ndemonstration of quantum nonlocality, the first part of which is\nBohm\u2019s version of the EPR argument, concerning EPRB correlations:\n\n\nLet me summarize once again the logic that leads to the impasse. The\nEPRB correlations are such that the result of the experiment on one\nside immediately foretells that on the other, whenever the analyzers\nhappen to be parallel. If we do not accept the intervention on one\nside as a causal influence on the other, we seem obliged to admit that\nthe results on both sides are determined in advance anyway,\nindependently of the intervention on the other side, by signals from\nthe source and by the local magnet setting. But this has implications\nfor non-parallel settings which conflict with those of quantum\nmechanics. So we cannot dismiss intervention on one side as a\ncausal influence on the other. (Bell 1981a, reprinted 1987c: 149) \n\n\nAs with just about everything else in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, there remains considerable controversy about what exactly\nBell\u2019s analysis demonstrates. (For further insight into the\nvarious controversies see Maudlin 2014 and Goldstein et al. 2011. See also the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem.)\nNonetheless, the opinion of Bell himself about what he showed is\nperfectly clear. See Norsen 2011 for a nice overview of Bell\u2019s\nviews on the matter.\n",
