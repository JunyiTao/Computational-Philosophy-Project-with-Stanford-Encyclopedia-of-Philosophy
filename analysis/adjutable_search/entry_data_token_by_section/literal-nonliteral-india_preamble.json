    "main_text": "\nIndian thinkers distinguish between literal and non-literal meaning early in their history. They do so within different intellectual disciplines (\u015b\u0101stra-s), each broadly philosophical, but with varying emphases. Within the grammatical discipline, Y\u0101ska\u2019s Semantic Explanation (Nirukta), an early (perhaps 6th century to 3rd century BCE) etymological treatise recognizes the difference between ordinary (laukika) and metaphorical language (upam\u0101). This text, possibly pre-dating the renowned Sanskrit grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini (ca 4th century BCE), employs etymological analysis in order to ascertain the meanings of unfamiliar terms used in the Vedas, a collection of texts including religious hymns, poetry, and rituals. In portions of the Vedas called Upani\u1e63ads, widely recognized as proto-philosophical, the limits of language are made explicit: ordinary speech cannot characterize ultimate reality, though figurative language can hint at it. These early texts focus on topics which would give rise to three intellectual disciplines: Grammar, Philosophy, and Aesthetics. (Capital letters distinguish the schools of thought from their subject matter.)\nTwo of the three disciplines, Grammar and Philosophy, are identifiable by their relationship to early \u201croot\u201d texts which form the basis of later commentarial reflection. Within Grammar, the aforementioned Y\u0101ska, as well as P\u0101\u1e47ini, Pata\u00f1jali (ca 2nd century BCE), and Bhart\u1e5bhari (ca 5th century CE), are a few of the most crucial thinkers whose reflections\u2014on the structure of Sanskrit in particular, and by way of Sanskrit, language in general\u2014informed philosophical reflection on meaning. For instance, P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s analysis of the morphology, syntax, and semantics of Sanskrit, in his Eight Chapters (A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b) continues to be cited by philosophers a thousand years later. The literal/non-literal distinction is a topic as well for the various philosophical schools, each one known as a dar\u015bana, roughly a \u201cviewpoint.\u201d Both those who accept the Vedas as authoritative and those who do not address the distinction in the context of testimony and theories of reference. Among the former Vedic thinkers, this article primarily treats the Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophical traditions, and of the Veda-denying, the Buddhists and the Jainas. Finally, the tradition here called Aesthetics (ala\u1e43k\u0101ra) is primarily focused on the aesthetics of poetry and drama\u2014especially the courtly poetry known as k\u0101vya. It encompasses topics studied in rhetoric, poetics, and aesthetics. Ala\u1e43k\u0101ra, despite meaning \u201cembellishment\u201d or \u201cornamentation,\u201d (in reference to figures of speech), studies the psychology of utterances, their ensuing emotional states in audiences, and their logical or semantic structures. Until the highly influential Light on Suggestion (Dhvany\u0101loka) of \u0100nandavardhana (ca 9th century CE), aesthetic theory was primarily, though not exclusively, focused on taxonomies of figuration, but after \u0100nandavardhana, it drew on philosophical work, in particular M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, to theorize about meaning itself.\nWhat follows focuses on the conceptual space for Indian theorizing about literal and non-literal meaning in each of these three textual traditions. Since the article\u2019s structure is topical rather than historical, a chronology of major figures is appended to help orient readers. The focus of the article is the period demarcated roughly from 200 CE to 1300 CE, often characterized as the Classical Period of Indian philosophy.\n",
