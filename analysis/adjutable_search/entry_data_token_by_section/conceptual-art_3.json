Because more weight tends to given to creative\nprocess than physical material, and because art should be about\nintellectual inquiry and reflection rather than beauty and aesthetic\npleasure (as traditionally conceived), the identity of the work of art\nis said to lie in the idea at the heart of the piece in question. In\nthe words of Kosuth, \u2018[t]he actual works of art are ideas\u2019\n(Lippard 1973, 25). For conceptual art, \u2018the idea or concept is\nthe most important aspect of the work\u2019 (LeWitt 1967, 166). Art\nis \u2018de-materialised\u2019, and in this sense held to be prior\nto its materialisation in any given object.\n\nThe claim that the conceptual artwork is to be identified with an idea\nthat may be seen to underlie it has far-reaching ramifications. It not\nonly affects the ontology of the conceptual artwork but also\nprofoundly alters the role of the artist by casting her in the role of\nthinker rather than object-maker. Moreover, it calls for a thorough\nreview of the way in which we perceive, engage and appreciate\nartworks. Further still, it links art so intimately to ideas and\nconcepts that even a principled distinction between the domain of art\nand the realm of thought seems difficult to preserve.\n",
