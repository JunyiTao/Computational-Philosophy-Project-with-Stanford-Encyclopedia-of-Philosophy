    "main_text": "Traditional Questions || Monism/Pluralism\n2.2 Monism/Pluralism\n\nOne of the oldest questions in the theory of value is that of whether\nthere is more than one fundamental (intrinsic) value. Monists say\n\u201cno\u201d, and pluralists say \u201cyes\u201d. This question\nonly makes sense as a question about intrinsic values; clearly there\nis more than one instrumental value, and monists and pluralists will\ndisagree, in many cases, not over whether something is of value, but\nover whether its value is intrinsic. For example, as important\nas he held the value of knowledge to be, Mill was committed to holding\nthat its value is instrumental, not intrinsic. G.E. Moore disagreed,\nholding that knowledge is indeed a value, but an intrinsic one, and\nthis expanded Moore\u2019s list of basic values. Mill\u2019s theory\nfamously has a pluralistic element as well, in contrast with\nBentham\u2019s, but whether Mill properly counts as a pluralist about\nvalue depends on whether his view was that there is only one value\n\u2014 happiness \u2014 but two different kinds of pleasure which\ncontribute to it, one more effectively than the other, or whether his\nview was that each kind of pleasure is a distinctive value. This point\nwill be important in what follows.\n2.2.1 Ontology and Explanation\n\nAt least three quite different sorts of issues are at stake in this\ndebate. First is an ontological/explanatory issue. Some monists have\nheld that a plural list of values would be explanatorily\nunsatisfactory. If pleasure and knowledge are both values, they have\nheld, there remains a further question to be asked: why? If this\nquestion has an answer, some have thought, it must be because there is\na further, more basic, value under which the explanation subsumes both\npleasure and knowledge. Hence, pluralist theories are either\nexplanatorily inadequate, or have not really located the basic\nintrinsic values.\n\nThis argument relies on a highly controversial principle about how an\nexplanation of why something is a value must work \u2014 a very\nsimilar principle to that which was appealed to in the argument that\nintrinsic value must be an intrinsic property [section 2.1.1]. If this\nprinciple is false, then an explanatory theory of why both\npleasure and knowledge are values can be offered which does not work\nby subsuming them under a further, more fundamental value. Reductive\ntheories of what it is to be a value satisfy this description,\nand other kinds of theory may do so, as well (Schroeder [2005]). If\none of these kinds of theory is correct, then even pluralists can\noffer an explanation of why the basic values that they appeal to are\nvalues.\n2.2.2 Revisionary Commitments?\n\nMoreover, against the monist, the pluralist can argue that the basic\nposits to which her theory appeals are not different in kind\nfrom those to which the monist appeals; they are only different in\nnumber. This leads to the second major issue that is at stake\nin the debate between monists and pluralists. Monistic theories carry\nstrong implications about what is of value. Given any monistic theory,\neverything that is of value must be either the one intrinsic value, or\nelse must lead to the one intrinsic value. This means that if some\nthings that are intuitively of value, such as knowledge, do not, in\nfact, always lead to what a theory holds to be the one intrinsic value\n(for example, pleasure), then the theory is committed to denying that\nthese things are really always of value after all.\n\nConfronted with these kinds of difficulties in subsuming everything\nthat is pre-theoretically of value under one master value, pluralists\ndon\u2019t fret: they simply add to their list of basic intrinsic\nvalues, and hence can be more confident in preserving the\npre-theoretical phenomena. Monists, in contrast, have a choice. They\ncan change their mind about the basic intrinsic value and try all over\nagain, they can work on developing resourceful arguments that\nknowledge really does lead to pleasure, or they can bite the bullet\nand conclude that knowledge is really not, after all, always good, but\nonly under certain specific conditions. If the explanatory commitments\nof the pluralist are not different in kind from those of the\nmonist, but only different in number, then it is natural for\nthe pluralist to think that this kind of slavish adherence to the\nnumber one is a kind of fetish it is better to do without, if we want\nto develop a theory that gets things right. This is a\nperspective that many historical pluralists have shared.\n2.2.3 Incommensurability\n\nThe third important issue in the debate between monists and\npluralists, and the most central over recent decades, is that over the\nrelationship between pluralism and incommensurability. If one state of\naffairs is better than another just in case it contains more value\nthan the other, and there are two or more basic intrinsic values, then\nit is not clear how two states of affairs can be compared, if one\ncontains more of the first value, but the other contains more of the\nsecond. Which state of affairs is better, under such a circumstance?\nIn contrast, if there is only one intrinsic value, then this\ncan\u2019t happen: the state of affairs that is better is the one\nthat has more of the basic intrinsic value, whatever that is.\n\nReasoning like this has led some philosophers to believe that\npluralism is the key to explaining the complexity of real moral\nsituations and the genuine tradeoffs that they involve. If some things\nreally are incomparable or incommensurable, they reason, then\npluralism about value could explain why. Very similar reasoning\nhas led other philosophers, however, to the view that monism\nhas to be right: practical wisdom requires being able to make\nchoices, even in complicated situations, they argue. But that would be\nimpossible, if the options available in some choice were incomparable\nin this way. So if pluralism leads to this kind of incomparability,\nthen pluralism must be false.\n\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll consider the debate over the\ncomparability of values on which this question hinges. But even if we\ngrant all of the assumptions on both sides so far, monists have the\nbetter of these two arguments. Value pluralism may be one way\nto obtain incomparable options, but there could be other ways, even\nconsistently with value monism. For example, take the interpretation\nof Mill on which he believes that there is only one intrinsic value\n\u2014 happiness \u2014 but that happiness is a complicated sort of\nthing, which can happen in each of two different ways \u2014 either\nthrough higher pleasures, or through lower pleasures. If Mill has this\nview, and holds, further, that it is in some cases indeterminate\nwhether someone who has slightly more higher pleasures is happier than\nsomeone who has quite a few more lower pleasures, then he can explain\nwhy it is indeterminate whether it is better to be the first way or\nthe second way, without having to appeal to pluralism in his theory of\nvalue. The pluralism would be within his theory of\nhappiness alone.\n\nSee a more detailed discussion in the entry on\n value pluralism.\n",
