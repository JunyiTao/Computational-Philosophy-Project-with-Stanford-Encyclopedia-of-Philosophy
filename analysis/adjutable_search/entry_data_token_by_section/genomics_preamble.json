    "main_text": "\n\nAbout 30 years ago researchers and other stakeholders started setting\nup the first genomics initiative, the Human Genome Project (HGP) (see \nthe link to All About the Human Genome Project (HGP) in the\n Other Internet Resources section below). \nWhat was conceived as an audacious plan in the 1980s turned\ninto an official multi-centre, international program in 1990 and was\nbrought to a conclusion in 2003.\n\nMore than a decade later genomics is still big in business (and big\nbusiness): the Obama administration announced in January 2015 that\nthey intend to sequence one million human genomes (see Precision\nMedicine Initiative in the \n Other Internet Resources section\n below; see also Reardon 2015). Craig Venter, the commercially minded\nnemesis of the publicly-funded HGP is also in the mix again, this time\ninvolved in a privately-funded collaboration that aims to sequence two\nmillion genomes over the course of the next ten years (Ledford 2016).\nAnd equally important, we see not only the same players clash again\nbut also the same promises being made, with talk of\n\u201cgroundbreaking health benefits\u201d and \u201cnew medical\nbreakthroughs\u201d appearing once again in press releases and other\nannouncements (see for instance Collins & Varmus 2015 or NIH\n2015).\n\nBut many things are also different now. For instance, China has\nemerged as a major player in the genomics field, with the BGI\n(formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute) already announcing in 2011\nthe aim to sequence one million genomes. Moreover, DNA sequencing is\nno longer the only goal of these large-scale initiatives: the new\ngenomics is of course still a genome-based effort, but it is a\ntransformed enterprise that also focuses on data about proteins, DNA\n methylation[1]\n patterns or the physiology and the environment of the people studied;\nDNA sequence data now forms only part of a much larger picture in the\npush for what is called \u2018precision\u2019 or\n\u2018personalised\u2019 medicine. Developments such as these have\nled many to refer to the present as a \u2018postgenomic\u2019 age\n(Richardson & Stevens 2015). The goal of this entry is to look at\nthis constantly developing space of genomic and postgenomic research\nand outline some of the central philosophical issues it raises.\n\nSection 1\n will introduce and discuss several key terms, such as\n\u2018genome\u2019 or \u2018genomics\u2019.\n Section 2\n will then turn to the question of what it means to read and interpret\nthe genome. What did the sequencing and the mapping of the human\ngenome entail and what philosophical issues arose in the context of\nthe human genome project? How did sequencing evolve into a much larger\n\u2018postgenomic\u2019 enterprise and what issues did this\ntransformation bring about? To answer the last question\n Section 3\n will consider two different projects, perhaps newly emerging fields,\nnamely the HapMap project, and metagenomics. In the supplementary\ndocument\n The ENCODE Project and the ENCODE Controversy,\n we will look at the ENCODE project and the controversy that\nsurrounded it. These three cases will highlight key issues that come\nup again and again in the context of genomics and postgenomics.\n\nIt is also important to point out what this article is not\nabout. There are already a number of entries in the Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) that deal specifically with\ngenes, genetics and also the HGP, and the present entry will not,\ntherefore, address in much detail the history of, or the philosophical\nissues surrounding, the concept of the \u2018gene\u2019 (see SEP\nentry\n gene,\n but also the entries\n molecular biology,\n molecular genetics, and\n the human genome project),\n or the history of the HGP (see SEP entry,\n the human genome project).\n Broader issues that also play a role in genomics, such as the notion\nof biological information and the issue of reductionism have also been\ndiscussed in a set of SEP entries (for more on reductionism see\n reductionism in biology;\n gene;\n HGP;\n and\n molecular genetics\n and for more on the metaphor of a \u2018genetic program\u2019 and\nbiological information see entries on\n biological information;\n gene;\n molecular genetics;\n and\n molecular biology).\n Furthermore, and probably most importantly of all, our focus here\nwill be on the epistemological, ontological and methodological issues\nraised by genomics rather than the ethical, legal and social issues\nthat the sequencing of DNA inevitably brings up (but see\n HGP\n entry for more on these topics).\n",
