    "main_text": "The Transcendental Deduction || Universality and Necessity in our Experience of Objects\n1.3 Universality and Necessity in our Experience of Objects\n\nIn \u00a718 Kant draws our attention to certain features of our\nrepresentations of objects that, in his view, will serve to defeat\nassociationism and establish a priori synthesis:\n\nThe transcendental unity of apperception is that unity through which\nall the manifold given in an intuition is united in a concept of the\nobject. It is therefore entitled objective, and must be distinguished\nfrom the subjective unity of consciousness\u2026 Whether I can\nbecome empirically conscious of the manifold as simultaneous\nor as successive depends on circumstances and empirical conditions.\nTherefore, the empirical unity of consciousness, through association\nof representations, itself concerns an appearance, and is wholly\ncontingent\u2026 Only the original unity is objectively valid: the\nempirical unity of apperception,\u2026 which\u2026 is merely\nderived from the former under given conditions in concreto,\nhas only subjective validity. One person connects the representation\nof a certain word with one thing, the other [person] with another\nthing; the unity of consciousness in that which is empirical is not,\nas regards what is given, necessarily and universally valid.\n(B139\u201340)\n\n\nFor Kant, a defining feature of our representations of objects is\ntheir objective validity. For a representation to be objectively valid\nit must be a representation of an objective feature of reality, that\nis, a feature whose existence and nature is independent of how it is\nperceived (Guyer 1987:11\u201324). In this argument, it appears that\nKant just assumes that the representations that make up experience are\nobjectively valid. He then aims to establish that association is\ninadequate because it can yield only representations that are not\nobjectively valid. In the above passage, Kant contends that our\nobjectively valid representations must in a sense be necessary and\nuniversal. However, the empirical unity of consciousness, which\ninvolves an ordering of representations achieved by association, can\nonly be non-universal, contingent, and hence merely subjectively\nvalid, by contrast with the transcendental unity of apperception,\nwhich involves an ordering that is universal and necessary, and is\ntherefore objectively valid. In Kant\u2019s conception, it is the\nfact that the transcendental unity of apperception is generated by\na priori synthesis that allows it to yield an ordering that\nis universal, necessary, and objectively valid. (Ameriks 1978,\nPereboom 1995, Patricia Kitcher 2011: 115\u201360; Allais 2011, 2015;\nVinci 2014). On Lucy Allais\u2019s proposal, empirically we are\nacquainted with objects, but absent a priori synthesis, empirical\nrepresentations would be of objects that are indeterminate with\nrespect to multiple possible ways of conceptualizing and individuating\nthem. Only with a priori synthesis is the representation of\ndeterminate objects possible. The concept of cause has a key role\nhere, since determinacy is paradigmatically a function of represented\ncausal unity of objects (Allais 2015: 275\u201385; cf. Beck 1978;\nVinci 2014: 134\u201344). This determinacy, by virtue of a shared\nscheme of a priori concepts, yields the universality and necessity\nKant has in mind.\n\nTo illustrate and support these claims, Kant invokes examples of the\nordering of phenomena in time that also have the key role in the\ndiscussion of the Second Analogy (cf. Guyer 1987: 87\u201390; Dicker\n2004: 137\u201344). There Kant argues that our representations,\nconsidered independently of their content, are always successive. For\nexample, when I view the front, sides, and back of the house when\nwalking around it, and when I watch a boat float downstream, my\nrepresentations of the individual parts and states occur successively.\nThe content of these successive representations, however, can be\nrepresented as either determinately and objectively successive or as\ndeterminately and objectively simultaneous. And as it in fact turns\nout, despite the representations in each of these sequences being\nsubjectively successive, we represent the parts of the house as\nobjectively simultaneous, and the positions of the boat as objectively\nsuccessive. How might we account for this difference in objectivity\ndespite the similarity in subjectivity? (Melnick 1973: 89)\n\nThe important clue for answering this question is that these\nrepresentations of objective simultaneity and succession are universal\nand necessary. It is the universality and necessity of our\nrepresenting the parts of the house as simultaneous that accounts for\nour representing them as objectively simultaneous, and the\nuniversality and necessity of our representing the positions of the\nboat as successive that accounts for our representing them as\nobjectively successive. Association is inadequate for accounting for\nthis objectivity because it is incapable of yielding such universality\nand necessity, a defect not shared by synthesis.\n\nA first approximation of the import of \u2018universal\u2019 in the\nhouse example is:\n\n(U) Any human experience of the parts of the house is an experience of\nthese parts as objectively simultaneous.\n\n\nThe addition of necessity has the following effect on (U):\n\n(U-N, first pass) Necessarily, any human experience of the parts of\nthe house is an experience of these parts as objectively simultaneous.\n\n\nThis claim would be resisted by Hume if the necessity were specified\nas ranging over all possible circumstances, for Hume\u2019s theory\nwould allow for the possibility of a deviant ordering in unusual\nempirical conditions. But (U-N, first pass) can be reformulated more\nprecisely as\n\n(U-N) Necessarily, if empirical conditions are normal, any human\nexperience of the parts of the house is an experience of these parts\nas objectively simultaneous.\n\n\nKant\u2019s view is that given only the resources of association, the\ntruth of (U-N) cannot be explained. The reason is \u201cwhether I can\nbecome empirically conscious of the manifold as simultaneous or as\nsuccessive depends on circumstances or empirical conditions,\u201d\nand so \u201cthe empirical unity of consciousness, through\nassociation of representations, itself concerns an appearance, and is\nwholly contingent\u201d (B139\u201340). Association cannot explain\nthe truth of (U-N), for given only the resources of association, the\nparts of the house will not necessarily or universally be represented\nas objectively simultaneous even supposing only normal empirical\nconditions. Kant asks us to consider an activity, word association,\nwhich functions as a paradigm for association. Word association,\nfamiliarly, does not yield universal and necessary patterns;\n\u201cone person connects the representation of a certain word with\none thing, the other [person] with another thing\u2026\u201d\n(B140). Hume\u2019s own paradigm for association in is the relations\namong parts of a conversation (1748: \u00a73). In such conversations,\npeople make different associations in the same circumstances.\nKant\u2019s point is that if the very paradigms for association fail\nto exhibit the sort of necessity and universality at issue, then the\nhypothesis that association is powerful enough to yield such an\nordering of representations \u2013 wherever we find it \u2013 is\nruled out. (Pereboom 1995; Dickerson 2004: 170\u201377; for an\naccount of a more general relationship in Kant between universality\nand necessity on the one hand and apriority on the other, see Smit\n2009).\n\nHere we should see Kant as advancing his claim for the applicability\nof the categories by ruling out association as an explanation for\n(U-N). The structure of this (part of the) argument can be represented\nas follows:\n\nWe have representations of objects, i.e., of objectively valid\nphenomena. (premise)\nAll of our representations of objects are (in part) of universal\nand necessary features of experience. (9, premise)\nNecessary and universal features of experience cannot be explained\nby association. (premise, from reflection on the nature of\nassociation))\nIf (10) and (11) are true, all of our representations of objects\nrequire a faculty for ordering mental states distinct from\nassociation. (premise)\nAll of our representations of objects require a faculty for\nordering mental states distinct from association. (11, 12)\nIf (13) is true, all of our representations of objects require a\nfaculty for synthesis by a priori concepts. (premise)\nAll of our representations of objects require a faculty for\nsynthesis by a priori concepts. (13, 14)\n\n\nWe can expand (15) to explicitly note the link to the argument from\nabove:\n\n\n\n15*.\nAll of our representations of objects require a faculty for\nsynthesis by a priori concepts, the same faculty required to\naccount for my consciousness of the identity of myself as subject of\ndifferent self-attributions of mental states. (1\u20138, 13, 14)\n \n\n\nTo this we can add the final moves, which are explained in the\nsubsequent sections of the B-Deduction:\n\nInsofar as our representations of objects require a faculty for\nsynthesis by a priori concepts, certain a priori\nconcepts \u2013 the categories \u2013 legitimately apply to these\nobjects. (premise)\n\n\nWe have representations of objects, and they are all such that the\ncategories legitimately apply to these objects. (9, 15, 16)\n\n\nThe key necessary conditions, expressed by (12) and (14), like those\nof the argument from above, are necessary conditions of only possible\nexplanation.\n\nGuyer objects that at various places in the Transcendental Deduction\nKant illegitimately assumes knowledge of necessity, and perhaps this\nargument falls to such a concern (Guyer 1987: 146\u20137). While this\nconcern has the potential of weakening Kant\u2019s argument, perhaps\nHume would not deny the necessity under consideration at this point in\nthe argument. Hume does maintain that it is in some sense impossible,\ngiven an experience of constant conjunction, that the mind not be\ncarried from an impression of the first conjunct to an idea of the\nnext:\n\n\u2026 having found, in many instances, that any two kinds of\nobjects, flame and heat, snow and cold, have always been conjoined\ntogether; if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind\nis carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and to believe,\nthat such a quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer\napproach. This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in\nsuch circumstances. It is an operation of the soul, when we are so\nsituated, as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love, when we\nreceive benefits; or hatred, when we meet with injuries. (1748:\n\u00a75)\n\n\nThus Hume himself contends that given certain specific empirical\ncircumstances, a particular type of ordering of perceptions in a sense\nnecessarily comes about.\n\nA further concern of Guyer\u2019s is that Kant assumes without\ndefense that all knowledge of necessity is grounded in a\npriori concepts. But, in response, perhaps we need not interpret\nKant as arguing directly from (U-N) to the claim that the categories\ncorrectly apply to objects in our experience. Rather, we might see him\nas advancing his claim for the applicability of the categories by\nruling out association as an explanation for (U-N). This transition\ncan be divided into three steps:\n\nTo explain the truth of (U-N), we must have a mental faculty other\nthan association for ordering representations.\nThis faculty does not consist solely of sensory items.\nThis faculty must employ a priori concepts, the\ncategories in particular.\n\n\nThe challenge Kant issues is to explain why, under normal conditions,\nthe ordering in question is universal and necessary. Part of the best\nexplanation, he believes, is (a), that we must have a faculty for\nordering the representations. Hume might agree with this conclusion,\nsupposing a sufficiently thin conception of \u2018faculty\u2019. Yet\nhe would deny (b), that this faculty does not consist solely of\nsensory items. Kant argues that the Humean proposal for a faculty that\nconsists solely of sensory items, the faculty of association, cannot\naccount for the truth of propositions such as (U-N), for the very\nparadigms of association, such as word association, and the\nassociation of topics in a conversation, do not exhibit the requisite\nuniversality and necessity. The alternative that can account for the\ntruth of propositions such as (U-N) involves affirming (c), that the\nfaculty in question must be one that employs the categories.\n\nThe associationist might counter that sensory experience is\nsufficiently uniform for association to produce the universalities and\nnecessities at issue. Perhaps Kant is too quick to conclude that the\nargument from universality and necessity is decisive, for in addition,\nassociationist objections of this sort must be answered \u2013 as\ncontemporary critical discussions of proposals for innate concepts\nindicate (Pereboom 1995: 31\u20133). But this does not detract from\nthe anti-associationist force provided by the sorts of universalities\nand necessities Kant has in mind, and this fact is recognized by the\ncontemporary discussion.\n",
