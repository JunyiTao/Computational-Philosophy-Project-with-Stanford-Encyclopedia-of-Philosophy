    "main_text": "Avicenna\u2019s Logical Works and His Sources\n1. Avicenna\u2019s Logical Works and His Sources\n\nAvicenna\u2019s logical works consist of a significant amount of\nmaterial unevenly distributed across his various philosophical\nsummae. The most comprehensive treatment of logic is, by far,\nthe one to be found in the monumental treatment of the\n\u0160if\u0101\u02be (The Cure), from the 1020s,\nwhere Avicenna extensively engages in systematic analysis as well as\ninterpretive debate with the Peripatetic tradition. At the opposite\nend of the spectrum is the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nwa-tanb\u012bh\u0101t (Pointers and Reminders), the\nshortest and likely the latest (from the 1030s), where Avicenna\norganizes the material in an original way that came to shape the\napproach to logic in the Post-Avicennan tradition. In between (not\nchronologically, as the work largely reflects Avicenna\u2019s early\nviews from around 1014) lies the account of logic developed in the\nNa\u011f\u0101t (The Salvation). While offering a\nmuch abridged treatment (and leaving out dialectic, rhetoric, and\npoetics altogether), the latter is methodologically closer to the\nCure than it is to Pointers and Reminders but far\nless ponderous, and offers a good point of access to Avicenna\u2019s\nlogic as a whole.\n\nIn light of their relative position in the corpus, the balance of\ndetail and perspicuity, and\u2014in the case of the Cure and\nPointers\u2014the relative influence they exerted on the\nlater tradition, I have chosen in this entry to focus almost\nexclusively on these three sources, which also happen to be the ones\nthat are in better shape in terms of available editions.\n\nOther treatments of logic include the account found in the D\u0101ne\u0161n\u0101me-ye \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u012b (Philosophy for \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ad-Dawla),\nin Persian, or the one preserved by the partially extant al-Ma\u0161riqiyy\u016bn (The Easterners), which reflects an approach no\nlonger committed to the terminology and exegetical problems of the\nAristotelian tradition, written as it is in opposition to the methods\nand doctrines of (Western) Ba\u0121dadi Aristotelians (Street 2004).\n\nFinally, interesting insights on certain areas of logic may also be gleaned from additional heterogeneous sources, such as Avicenna\u2019s correspondence\n(Street 2010a) and texts not directly dealing with\nlogic, most notably the Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t (especially books\nI and V), which is his major work in metaphysics.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s logic is indebted first and foremost to\nAristotle\u2014the First Teacher (al-mu\u02bfallim al-awwal)\u2014and\nthe works of the Organon: the Categories\n(Maq\u016bl\u0101t), On Interpretation\n(\u02bfIb\u0101ra), the Prior Analytics\n(An\u016bl\u016b\u1e6d\u012bq\u0101 \u016bl\u0101 or\nQiy\u0101s), the Posterior Analytics\n(An\u016bl\u016b\u1e6d\u012bq\u0101 \u1e6f\u0101niya or\nBurh\u0101n), the Topics\n(\u1e6c\u016bb\u012bq\u0101 or \u011eadal), and the\nSophistical Refutations (S\u016bfis\u1e6d\u012bq\u0101 or Mu\u0121\u0101la\u1e6da). As noted above, the Arabic\nOrganon included Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\n(\u012as\u0101\u0121\u016b\u011f\u012b or\nMad\u1e2bal) as well as Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric\n(\u1e2ai\u1e6d\u0101ba) and Poetics\n(\u0160i\u02bfr).\n\nBesides Aristotle, among the figures we encounter in Avicenna\u2019s\nlogical writings\u2014whether identifiable by name, definite\ndescription, or doctrine\u2014are Plato, Theophrastus, Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Galen, Porphyry, Themistius, and Philoponus from the\nGreek tradition; al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and other\nBa\u0121d\u0101d\u012b Aristotelians from the Arabic tradition (all\nvariously involved in exegetical efforts focusing on the books of the\nOrganon, traces of which survive in the glosses to the\nfamous manuscript Paris BNF, Arabe 2346 that preserves\nits Arabic translation). Their presence varies from the explicit ascription\nof alternative interpretations (e.g., in the case of the\ninterpretation of the absolute proposition) to the rejection of\ncompeting accounts (the contrast between \u201cthe widespread\nview\u201d (al-ma\u0161h\u016br) and \u201cthe\ntruth\u201d (al-\u1e25aqq) is a standard device of\nAvicenna\u2019s style of argument); from the tacit adoption of\nsystematic distinctions and concepts (especially with regard to\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, who is rarely acknowledged) to minute\nexegetical points.\n\nIn the following, I refer to Avicenna\u2019s works by title, book, chapter, page, and line numbers from the Cairo edition for all\nworks that are part of the \u0160if\u0101\u02be; from Forget\u2019s edition of the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t wa-tanb\u012bh\u0101t, and from D\u0101ne\u0161pa\u017e\u016bh\u2019s\nedition of the Na\u011f\u0101t.\n",
