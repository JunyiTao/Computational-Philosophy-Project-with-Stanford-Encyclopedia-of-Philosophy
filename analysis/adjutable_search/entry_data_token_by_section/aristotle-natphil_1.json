    "main_text": "Motion\n2. Motion\n\nBecause motion or change (kin\u00easis) is mentioned in the\ndefinition of nature, any discussion of nature will need to rely upon\nthe explanation of motion. One might\u2014erroneously\u2014think\nthat this is an easy task, because Aristotle\u2019s categories (as\nlisted in the Categories and also elsewhere) do contain two\nrelated types of entities, action and passion. Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion of motion in the Physics, however, starts out in a\nsomewhat different manner. When he submits that there is no motion\nbesides the categories (Physics 3.1, at 200b32\u2013201a3),\nhe does not assign motions to the categories of action and passion.\nAfter mentioning that the entities in the categories come in\noppositions, Aristotle claims a few lines later (at 201a8\u20139)\nthat there are as many kinds of motion and change as there are kinds\nof being. This means that motions are grouped here with the entities\nof the category where they effect\n change.[9]\n\nNevertheless, when making this claim, Aristotle speaks about four\nkinds of motion and change only\u2014those in substance, in quality,\nin quantity and in place\u2014whereas the number of the kinds of\nbeing should have remained ten.\n\nIndeed, the Physics will later submit its own list of\ncategories. That list is slightly reduced\u2014it has seven or eight\nelements, depending on whether we include or exclude\n time.[10]\n The reduced list also concludes with the claim that there are three\nkinds of motion, plus the additional kind of substantial\n change.[11]\n That is to say, even where Aristotle enumerates a fairly complete\nlist of categories, he will not have motions in every one of these\ncategories, and he is not content to relegate motions to the\ncategories of action and\n passion.[12]\n But this is a context where Aristotle stresses another issue: he is\nnot interested in assigning a separate ontological niche for\nmotions\u2014regardless of whether that might or might not have been\na feasible task within the categorization of entities. Here Aristotle\nis more intent on characterizing the ontological links which motions\nhave to entities falling into different categories, and to find a\ngeneral matrix of undergoing and effecting change. This happens in\nseveral steps. First Aristotle claims that changes of relations are\nnot changes in their own right; rather they are accidental, as they\noccur also in entities in which no change occurs at all, if the entity\nwhich they stand in relation to undergoes some\n change.[13]\n After these considerations the crucial two categories of action and\npassion are eliminated. They cannot possibly house motions in the same\nway as the other four categories do. This is so because such a motion\nwould require that there should be motion or change of an action or a\npassion. But there are no motions of motions, so even though actions\nand passions qualify as motions, or at least are intimately linked to\nmotions, we can set aside action and passion as types in which motions\ncan\n occur.[14]\n This leaves us with the shorter list of relevant categories, (1)\nsubstance, (2) quality, (3) quantity, and (4)\n place.[15]\n\nWithin the four domains where genuine change can occur, change always\nrequires the existence of a potentiality which can be actualised. But\nchange is neither identical to this potentiality, nor to the lack of a\nproperty, nor, without further qualifications, to the actuality which\nis acquired when the potentiality is actualised (Physics 3.2,\n201b33\u201335). It is a special kind of actuality, the actuality of\nthe potential in so far as it is potential (Physics 3.2,\n201b4\u20135). Aristotle\u2019s formulation strongly suggests that\nthe potentiality actualised in the process of change is not a separate\nand independent potentiality for motion, alongside the entity\u2019s\npotentiality for harbouring the end-state of the process: the process,\nsay, house-building, and the end result, the house, are different\nactualisations of the same potentiality of a set of materials that is\nbuildable into a house. Not only would Aristotle\u2019s definition be\nuninformative otherwise, amounting to the tautologous claim that\nchange is the actualisation of the capacity for change, the further\nqualification in the definition, that change is the actuality of the\npotential in so far as it is potential, would be completely\n idle.[16]\n This further restriction is easiest taken as selecting between the\ndifferent types of the realisations of the same\n potentialities.[17]\n As Aristotle stresses these are the incomplete actualities belonging\nto these potentialities, adding also that what is actualised in a\nprocess of realisation is an incomplete potentiality only\n(Physics 3.2, 201b32\u201333). Accordingly, potentialities\nof change may be admitted into the ontology. But even if they are\nadmitted as additional potentialities, they]do not need to feature as\npotentialities in their own right, but as the incomplete variants of\nthe fundamental potentiality for an end\n result.[18]\n\nIt is furthermore important to note that potentiality in this\ndiscussion throughout excludes actuality. In a formulation closely\nmatching the formulation of the principle of non-contradiction,\nAristotle asserts that \u201csome things are the same [=have the same\nproperties, are the same substances] both in potentiality and in\nactuality, but not at the same time or not in the same respect, as\ne.g. [a thing is] warm in actuality and cold in potentiality\u201d\n(Physics 3.1,\n 201a19\u201322).[19]\n Hence the ability of Aristotle\u2019s definition to pick out the\nparadoxical entity, which is the actuality of a potentiality that can\nno longer be present once it has been replaced by the corresponding\nproperty in actuality.\n3. The principle of causational synonymy\n\nThe definition of motion suggests that such processes can be\ncharacterised in terms of a property or state of an entity, acquired\nas a result at the end of the process, which can be labelled the\nform within this process, and an initial lack of\nthis form. Furthermore, Aristotle claims, there is a third component,\nwhich is not changed in the process, the substrate or subject of the\nmotion (Physics\n 1.7).[20]\n\nIn terms of this threefold division it is the duty of the entity\neffecting change to confer the requisite form on the object changed,\nas Physics 3.2, 202a9\u201312 puts it. But there are further\nimportant requirements for such a change to occur. First of all, these\nmotions or changes occur at the interaction of two potentialities.\nOne, the passive potentiality, is in the object undergoing change,\nwhile the other, the active potentiality, is in the entity initiating\nchange. The two potentialities need to match each other: when there is\na potentiality for being heated in the object undergoing change, the\nprocess needs to be initiated by another object possessing an active\npotentiality for effecting the heating. This is true to the extent\nthat Aristotle can claim that the definition of passive potentiality\nis dependent on that of the active potentiality (Metaphysics\n9.1, 1046a9\u201313). These two potentialities need to work in\ntandem, and consequently Aristotle can claim that there is only a\nsingle process going on, which is located in the entity moved. Thus,\nfor example, when a process of instruction is going on, it is\nidentical to a process of knowledge acquisition, which happens in the\nmind of the learner. Hence although action and passion retain their\ncategorical difference, because their accounts are different, what\nthey subsist in, the motion, will be the same (Physics 3.3,\n 202b19\u201322).[21]\n\nAristotle already by the introduction of a matching pair of active and\npassive potentialities for each causal interaction comes very close to\nadmitting a separate potentiality for each and every change, something\nuncomfortably close to the vis dormitiva, ridiculed by\nMoli\u00e8re, according to which a sleeping pill allegedly induces\nsleep just in virtue of its power to induce sleep. Aristotle, however,\nsubscribes to an even stronger principle, that causes in effecting\nchange transmit the form they possess to the entity they effect change\nin. According to this claim the active capacity of the item effecting\nchange is at its root an actuality, which is synonymous (in the\nAristotelian sense) with the effect that is brought about by it. In\nAristotle\u2019s favourite example, only a human in actuality\nproduces a human from what is a human in potentiality. If this is so,\na sleeping pill need not only possess an active potentiality for\ninducing sleep: it needs also to be slumbering\n itself.[22]\n The principle\u2014which we could term the principle of causational\nsynonymy\u2014comes from Plato (see e.g. Phaedo\n100B\u2013101D), but Aristotle has his own reasons for endorsing it.\nHis science attests to the presence and operation of causally active\nforms at each level of analysis of the physical\n world.[23]\n Hence, as we shall see, Aristotle\u2019s forms are the causally\nsignificant components of the substance effecting a change.\nAccordingly, when it comes to specifying the moving cause of an\nartefact, Aristotle will refer to the art of the craftsman as the\nfundamental component operative in the change. In cases where a living\nbeing is generated, it is the parental form which is transmitted to\nthe newly emerging living\n being.[24]\n\nBut it is not only processes of generation that conform to this\nrequirement. Instances of qualitative change are often mentioned\nalongside substantial generation, and as a crucially important\ninstance of qualitative alteration\u2014or of qualitative\nquasi-alteration, depending on how we interpret Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of\n perception[25]\u2014Aristotle\n presupposes that the principle of causational synonymy characterises\nalso the causal link connecting the object of sensation and the sense\norgan.\n\nIt is, nevertheless, important to note that Aristotle restricts the\nprinciple of causational synonymy in different and subtle ways. Most\nsignificantly, an important domain of cases where a property of an\nobject is actualised is exempted from the requirements of this\nprinciple. The actualisation of a property can be the continuation of\na previous causal process to the extent that Aristotle claims it is a\nsecond actuality, following upon a previously acquired\nfirst actuality. In these cases the emergence of the second\nactuality does not necessarily require an additional external\nefficient cause. The operation of this first actuality, through which\nit reinforces and completes itself, can be the mere extension of the\noperation of the original efficient cause (this will be\nAristotle\u2019s claim about the natural locomotion of the elements,\nsee\n Section 5\n below), or the entity which has acquired this first actuality can be\nalready causally responsible for its own activities, including the\nones which bring it to a level of higher\n actuality[26]\n (Aristotle\u2019s examples for this case are the soul of the embryo\nor of the newborn cub, which commands and effects the nourishing and\nthe activities of the animal; or the actual application of a piece of\nknowledge one has acquired beforehand). It is important to note that\nthese claims are far from trivial: they rest on further claims that\nthe very definitions of these first actualities (what it is to be an\nelement, an animal, or knowledge, respectively) inseparably include\nreferences to these activities.\n\nSecond, the principle of causational synonymy is couched in terms\nwhich do not include locomotions: it is substantial, qualitative or\nquantitative form which is claimed to be transmitted through the\nefficacy of the cause in Physics 3.2, 202a9\u201312. One of\nthe reasons for this is that locomotion, as Aristotle claims, affects\nthe least the substance, the ousia of the object undergoing\nmotion (Physics 8.7, 261a20f). Unlike the other types of\nchange, locomotion does not change the being of the moved object at\nall. To some extent that should mean that the predication of place\nshould remain extrinsic to the being of the entity that is at a\nparticular\n location.[27]\n Hence the fundamental presupposition of causation, that it is\nintrinsic characterisations of entities which are conferred on the\nobject moved cannot be in full force in cases of\n locomotion.[28]\n Accordingly, Aristotle will have a more intricate account for natural\nand forced locomotions.\n\nThird, the principle of causational synonymy is restricted to\nsubstances at the end of Metaphysics\n 7.9,[29]\n and in the first half of the same chapter the non-standard presence\nof some causally relevant forms may also be envisaged.\nAristotle\u2019s example there is the heat in motion, which produces\nheat in the body when the doctor rubs the patient in the appropriate\nmanner. This heat in the motion can be the presence of an active\npotentiality in the motion which is able to elicit heat in the body,\nwithout heat being predicable of motion itself. But even if such\nnon-inherential subsistence of properties is only hinted at, and not\nexpressly envisaged in this passage (on a more detailed description\nthe heat in motion is the active capacity of motion to produce heat in\nthe skin of the patient\u2014and in the skin of the\ndoctor\u2014which as far as the treatment is concerned enters into\nthe inner recesses of the patient\u2019s body, becoming heat in the\nbody), some similar sort of presence is required in two large classes\nof cases: natural generations and artificial productions.\n\nAristotle claims that in a chain of efficient causes, where the first\nelement of the series acts through the intermediary of the other\nitems, it is the first member in the causal chain, rather than the\nintermediaries, which is the moving cause (Physics 8.5,\n257a10\u201312). Then, both in cases of natural generation and\nartificial production, it is only this first efficient cause which has\nto satisfy the requirement of synonymous causation. Aristotle\u2019s\nprime example, that human generates human, is also such a case. Here,\nthe causal efficacy of the paternal human form is transmitted through\nthe generative potentialities of the semen of the father. The semen,\nhowever, although it acts as an efficient cause in the process of the\nformation of the embryo, is not a human; it does not possess the form\nit transmits in the same way as the male parent does.\nAristotle\u2019s discussion makes it clear that this is not an\nisolated instance of an exception from the general principle. He\ncompares the case to the activity of a craftsman, where the form of\nthe product of the artistic production is in the soul of the\ncraftsman, and then through the motions of the instruments this form\ncan get imposed on the material manufactured into an artefact. The\ninstruments and their motions are efficient causes of the process, but\nthey do not contain the form in the same way as the soul of the\ncraftsman (On the generation of animals 730b14\u201323 and\n740b25\u201329, for further discussion see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s biology).[30]\n\nAll these restrictions notwithstanding, Aristotle can claim that the\nprinciple of causational synonymy remains universally valid. This is\nso, because all the three restrictions above specify cases where\nAristotle can claim that a preceding, more prominent cause has already\nsatisfied the requirement: in the case of second actualities the first\nactuality was called into existence by a synonymous cause in the first\nplace; locomotions, qualitative and quantitative changes, even if not\ncaused by a synonymous entity, can be part of a larger pattern of\ncausation, in which a substance is caused by a substance of the same\nkind; and causal chains producing substances can be claimed to start\nout invariably from synonymous substances.\n\nGiven his commitment to causal synonymy, Aristotle needs to invoke\nconsiderations through which a chain of efficient causes of some\nentity can be meaningfully compared in terms of causal efficacy. These\nconsiderations will on each occasion describe synonymous causes not\nonly as temporally prior, but also as having priority in terms of\ncausal efficacy over the intermediate causes, which are responsible\nonly for the transmission of the forms of the original locus of causal\nefficacy.\n\nThis allows, then, that in the two major paradigms of such\ncausation\u2014in natural generation and in artificial\nproduction\u2014the nature of the natural entity, and the\n art[31]\n of the craftsman exercising his art respectively, the relevant form\nis the causally operative entity initiating change. This has wide\nranging consequences for the status of forms in several respects.\nFirst, the causal relevance of these forms shows that not any\narrangement or configuration can qualify as a full-fledged form. While\nit is true that privations are also forms in some sense\n(Physics 2.1, 193b19\u201320), this is not the sense in\nwhich the causally operative forms, describable in evaluative terms,\ncan be called forms. Moreover, the causal relevance of forms allows\nAristotle to switch (e.g. in De generatione et corruptione\n1.7) without notice between the craftsman and the craft itself as the\nappropriate specification of the efficient cause in these cases. We\nshould note that in the latter cases, Aristotle specifies causes which\nare unmoved. They do not effect motion by being in motion themselves,\nin so far as they are the causally effective forms within the causal\nframework; hence they are not under any reactive influence during this\nprocess either.\n4. Priority among motions\n\nEven though the foregoing might have suggested that generation of\nsubstances is fundamental for all the other kinds of changes, in fact\nlocomotion will have a privileged status. All other changes depend on\nlocomotions, because any two entities involved in change, with their\nactive and passive potentialities, respectively, need to come into\ncontact in order for the interaction to\n occur.[32]\n Contact, however, as a rule needs to be established by locomotion:\neither the entity to be moved, or the mover, or both, need to proceed\nso that they meet (Physics 8.7, 260a26\u2013b7). Moreover\nlocomotion is the form of change which can occur in isolation of\ngeneration, perishing and the other forms of change (Physics\n8.7, 260b26\u201329). Other changes are independent kinds of change\ninsofar as they can occur in an entity which does not perform any\nother change. Nevertheless all these forms of change include or\npresuppose that some other entity engages in\n locomotion.[33]\n\nAristotle argues at the opening of Physics bk. 8 that motion\nand change in the universe can have no beginning, because the\noccurrence of change presupposes a previous process of change. With\nthis argument Aristotle can establish an eternal chain of motions and\nrefute those who hold that there could have been a previous stationary\nstate of the universe. Such an eternal chain, Aristotle argues, needs\nto rely on a cause which guarantees its persistence: if each of the\nconstitutive processes in the causally connected web were of finite\nduration, for every one of them it can be the case that it is not\npresent in the world, indeed, at some later time it will not be\npresent any longer. But then the whole causally connected series of\nevents, Aristotle claims, would also be\n contingent.[34]\n Hence Aristotle postulates that the processes of the universe depend\non an eternal motion (or on several eternal motions), the eternal\nrevolution of the heavenly spheres, which in turn is dependent on one\nor several unmoved movers (Physics 8.6,\n 258b26\u2013259a9).[35]\n\nThe priority of the eternal celestial revolutions, furthermore,\nguarantees the causal finitude of the universe. This is so, even\nthough there are infinite causal chains: behind every single\nindividual of an animal species there is an infinite series of male\nancestors, each causally responsible for the subsequent members in the\nseries, because Aristotelian species are eternal and male parents are\nthe efficient causes of their\n offspring.[36]\n Left to its own devices, the finite universe on its own would\ncertainly reach a dissolution, a state of complete separation of the\nelemental masses into their concentrically arranged natural places. In\nview of the fact that such a complete segregation of the elemental\nmasses is avoided through the constant excitation caused by the\ncelestial motions, producing heat in the sublunary domain, especially\naround the regions of the\n Sun,[37]\n Aristotle will be entitled to assert that the cause of the human\nbeing is in the first instance his or her father, but is at the same\ntime the Sun as it moves along its annual ecliptic\n path.[38]\n Between celestial revolutions and the individual natural processes\nthere is always a finite causal chain, as these natural processes\ncould not possibly have continued without the celestial motions. The\ninfinite causal chains passing through male parents cannot subsist on\ntheir own without this constant external support, and this dependence\ncan always be analysed in terms of finite causal chains.\n5. Movers and unmoved movers\n\nThe definition of motion as the actuality of a potentiality of the\nentity undergoing motion in so far as it is potential requires that in\neach case the passive potentiality for the change is present in the\nchanging object. The presence of the potentiality can, nevertheless,\nbe in accordance with the nature of the object\u2014in which case the\nchange is natural (phusei) or according to\nnature (kata phusin), or can happen in the face of a\ncontrary disposition on the part of the nature of the entity\u2014in\nwhich case the change is forced (bi\u00e2i) or\ncontrary to nature (para phusin). A major\npresupposition on Aristotle\u2019s part is that this division is\nexhaustive: there are no changes to which the nature of the entity\nwould be indifferent or\n neutral.[39]\n The major consideration behind such a presupposition is that natures\nregulate the behaviour of the entities to which they belong in a\ncomprehensive manner, and not merely partially. Any influence the\nentity is exposed to interacts with its nature in a substantive\nmanner. The entity does not possess potentialities for change which\nwould not be directly related to the tendencies emerging from its\nnature.\n\nNote, however, that even if we endorsed the exhaustiveness of the\ndichotomy of natural and forced motions, and accepted the thesis that\nsimple bodies possess a unique natural motion (De caelo 1.2,\n269a8\u20139), we would not need thereby to accept Aristotle\u2019s\nfurther major claim, that natural and forced motions come in pairs of\nopposites, with the result that if a motion is contrary to the nature\nof an entity, the opposite motion will be its natural motion (De\ncaelo 1.2, 269a9\u201318). Where there is room for some more\ncomplex relationships among the targets of changes than a simple\nopposition along an axis of a single dimension\u2014and this is\neminently so between locomotions along rectilinear and circular paths,\nrespectively\u2014there can be several forced translations in\ncontrast to the single natural motion of the elements endowed with\nrectilinear natural motion, as Aristotle also admits in some passages\nof the De caelo (see 1.2, 269a30\u2013b2 and\n269b10\u201312).\n\nAlthough this allows for several different motions that are contrary\nto the nature of the same entity, the natural motion will still have a\nsingle opposite motion, the one which is directed to the opposite\nlocation. Consequently, natural circular motion will have no motion\nthat is opposite to it (De caelo 1.4,\n 270b32\u2013271a5).[40]\n\nAristotle\u2019s classification of motions into those contrary to\nnature and those according to nature applies not only to the motions\nof the moved objects, but transfers also to the movers effecting\nmotions. A mover can effect a motion which is contrary to its own\nnature. Aristotle\u2019s example of such an unnatural mover is the\nlever, an object heavy by nature, with which loads can be lifted\n(Physics 8.4, 255a20\u201323). Although such movers can\neffect motions in the contrary direction to the motion at the head of\nthe causal chain (levers are operated by the downward push of\nsomething heavy at the other end), the crucial consideration for\nAristotle in this case is that the original, initiating cause of the\ncausal chain should effect the motion according to its nature. Taken\ntogether, these considerations imply that we have a complete account\nof the physical domain once we have a thorough description of what is\nnatural to the entities in that domain, together with a specification\nof all the circumstances in which they\n operate.[41]\n\nBk. 8 of the Physics argues for the additional thesis that\nfor each motion, whether natural or contrary to nature, there needs to\nexist a\n mover.[42]\n In cases of forced motion, movers are present in a conspicuous way.\nThis need not be so, however, in cases of natural motion. Apart from\nthe cases where the nature of the entity is at the same time a moving\nand efficient cause\u2014i.e., apart from living beings, whose\nnature, the soul, is both formal and efficient cause\u2014the mover\nmay be inconspicuous. This is eminently so in the remaining large\nclass of natural motions, the natural motions of the elements. The\nnature of these elements, their inner principle of motion and rest is\nnot the moving cause of the motions of the elements, Aristotle claims.\nIf it were, then it would be up to the elementary masses to determine\nwhen they should perform their motions, but plainly this is not so.\nMoreover, the principle of causational synonymy rules out that any\nhomogenous mass, without an internal demarcation into separate\ncomponents, one moving and the other being moved, could move itself\n(Physics 8.4, 255a5\u201318). This is so because, on the\nassumption that one part of a homogeneous body could move another\npart, the active component of change would be, in every aspect,\nindistinguishable from the part in which change is effected, and this\nin turn would mean that change would occur even though there would be\nno transmission of a causally relevant property from the active part\nto the passive. This implies that even though we may answer the\nquestion as to why the elements move to their natural places\u2014the\nlight bodies up and the heavy ones down\u2014by an appeal to their\nrespective natures as causes (\u201cthat it is simply their nature to\nmove\n somewhere,[43]\n and this is what it is to be light and to be heavy,\u201d\nPhysics 8.4, 255b13\u201317), we do not thereby specify\ntheir moving causes. Their thrust being in a single direction, the\nelements cannot circumvent even rather simple obstacles they may\nencounter on their way (a sealed container can retain air under water,\nthe roof stays put pressing down on the walls of a building etc.).\nHence, whoever removes an obstacle to an element\u2019s motion is\ncausally responsible for the ensuing elemental motions. But even such\na causally responsible agent will not qualify as the moving\ncause, without yet further qualifications. For the identification of\nthe moving cause of these locomotions Aristotle invokes his\ndistinction of two potentialities. Some heavy material can be\npotentially light, as it can be transformed into a light material in a\nprocess of generation, whereas the emerging light material is still\npotential in a sense until it has acquired its full-fledged status,\nwhich involves its having arrived at that region of the cosmos which\nis its natural place. This analysis, then, describes the natural\nlocomotion of the elements as a possibly postponed, completing stage\nwithin a single overarching process, and hence in these cases\nAristotle can identify the cause of the second stage of the process\nwith the efficient cause of the first stage, the entity which\ngenerated the element in the first place (Physics 8.4,\n256a1).\n\nOnce it is established that there is a mover for each change, the\nfinite causal\n chains[44]\n can be followed up to the primary instance of motion, which are\neternal circular motions. (In particular the Sun\u2019s course along\nthe ecliptic is responsible for many sublunar changes, the cycle of\nthe seasons being foremost among them.) Whether these circular motions\nrequire external movers, and ultimately, whether the universe is\ncausally closed or needs some external causal influence for its\npreservation, depends on the status of these revolutions.\n\nIn this regard the very first thing to establish is that they cannot\nbe constrained\n motions.[45]\n But natural motions are also in need of movers, as Physics\n8.4 argues. This does not apply only to the natural motions of living\nbeings, which are performed under the causal influence of their soul.\nThe natural motions of the four sublunary elements are also caused by\nspecific external causes responsible for these motions, and on the\nbasis of these considerations Aristotle feels entitled to assert that\nevery motion whatsoever\u2014including also, then, the eternal\ncircular motions\u2014require a mover.\n\nBut the entities performing these eternal circular motions cannot\npossibly be moved by moving causes of the same kind as the movers of\nsublunary elemental motions. These entities are eternal and\nungenerated bodies. Consequently, there is no entity that could\nproduce them. Nothing can be responsible for the circular motion on\naccount of generating these eternal and ungenerated bodies. Moreover,\nas they do not encounter any hindrance during their revolutions, there\nis no room for an accidental mover which would remove any obstacle in\ntheir way.\n\nAlthough Aristotle\u2019s physical treatises do not discuss in what\nparticular way their movers are causally responsible for these eternal\ncircular motions, the general framework set out apparently applies to\nthem as well. In accordance with this, motion is an incomplete\nactuality of the potentiality of what is movable (Physics\n8.5, 257b6ff). This incomplete actuality is always dependent on the\ncausal efficacy of the corresponding actuality of a mover. The example\npresented here is the process of heating a potentially hot item,\ncaused to be hot by an actually hot thing. The division of roles\nguarantees that the same item cannot possibly be the mover and the\nmoved entity at the same time. Consequently, these eternal circular\nmotions are envisaged as having a cause responsible for their motion,\nthe causal influence of which produces (and upholds) this motion\ncontinuously in them. Aristotle does not specify in any detail what\nexactly the actuality of the mover is; nor does he indicate what\nrelationship there is between this actuality and the actuality that is\nbeing continuously communicated by the mover to the entities in\neternal circular motion.\n\nA further requirement is that the mover of these eternal circular\nmotions has to be\n unmoved.[46]\n But then the actuality of this mover should not be restricted to a\ncausally efficacious single property. Rather, the mover should be\nactual all way through. Any potentiality it might have would carry\nwith it the jeopardy that it might undergo possible changes of its\n own.[47]\n This is ruled out to the extent that such a first cause cannot house\nmotion even\n accidentally.[48]\n In other words, the mover cannot be related to the moving object in\nthe way the soul of an animal is related to the moving animal; in the\ncase of an animal wherever the living being, the animal, moves, its\nsoul will follow suit and will also move,\u2014accidentally\u2014to\nthe same\n place.[49]\n\nMoreover, the entity causally responsible for the eternal circular\nmotions in the world has to possess an infinite\n power,[50]\n which it communicates to the bodies it moves. As a result, this\nentity cannot be divisible and cannot have extension. Moreover, it\nmust be located where the motion is quickest, at the periphery of the\nphysical realm (Physics 8.10).\n\nAll this testifies to the exceptional status of the first movement,\nand behind it, of the first mover in the universe. The mover of these\nspheres possesses nothing but actuality, but this actuality is not\nwhat is transmitted in the process of causation. As we have seen in\n Section 3\n above, this would not be exceptional as such: locomotion need not be\ncaused on the transmission model of causation. But locomotions,\nalthough caused without the transmission of an actuality of being\nlocated in any particular location, were understood to be embedded in\nlarger patterns of causation which observe the principle of\ncausational synonymy. It is precisely any such larger pattern of\ncausation which is missing in the case of celestial\n motions.[51]\n Note furthermore that what we hear in Metaphysics 12.6, that\nthe first mover moves as an object of love and\n striving,[52]\n comes perilously close to abandoning the claims of Physics\nbk. 8 to the effect that there is an unmoved mover serving as the\nefficient cause of the motions of the cosmos. Such doubts, however,\nshould be dismissed. In these two contexts Aristotle gives distinct\ndescriptions of some principle that is beyond the realm of physics.\nFirst, still connecting it to the framework of the Physics,\nhe is characterizing a supra-physical entity without which the\nuniverse could not function or persist, and then, second, in the\nMetaphysics, he is offering an account of the causal efficacy\nof the supra-physical substance in terms of what this entity itself\nis. Small wonder that these two accounts situate the mode of operation\nof this entity in two different frames of physical\ncausation.\nGlossary of Aristotelian terms\n\naction: poiein\nactivity: praxis\nactuality: energeia or entelecheia\nart, craft: techn\u00ea\ncapacity: dunamis\ncause: aitia or aition\nchange: kin\u00easis or metabol\u00ea\n\nto effect change or motion: kinein\n\nto undergo change or motion: kineisthai\n\nqualitative change: alloi\u00f4sis\n\nquantitative changes\u2014growth: aux\u00easis; decay:\nphthisis\n\nlocomotion: phora\nto come to be: gignesthai\ncoming to be: genesis\nforce: bia\n\nforced: bi\u00e2i\nform: eidos or morph\u00ea\nin so far as: h\u00eai\ngenus, kind: genos\ngoal: telos\nkind, species: eidos\nknown, knowable: gn\u00f4rimon\n\nmore known, more knowable: gn\u00f4rim\u00f4teron\nmatter: hul\u00ea\nmagnitude: megethos\nmotion: kin\u00easis\nnature: phusis\n\nnatural: phusikos, phusei\n\naccording to nature: kata phusin\n\ncontrary to nature: para phusin\npassion: paschein\nto perish: phtheirein\nperishing: phthora\nplace: pou (as one of the categories, literally: where)\nor topos\npotentiality: dunamis\npower: dunamis\nquality: poion\nquantity: poson\nsubstance: ousia\ntime: pote (as one of the categories, literally: when) or\nchronos\n",
