    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Nationalist theories\n3.4 Nationalist theories\n\nNationalism has been identified as a relatively modern\nphenomenon\u2014with some theorists pinpointing its rise with the\nFrench Revolution, and the associated principle of self-determination;\nand others with the rise of print media, which created a community of\npeople who shared similar political values and aspirations and\nidentities, but were not related in a face-to-face way (Anderson\n1983). Nationalism, even in its earliest versions, appealed to the\nidea of a \u2018national homeland\u2019, but this was not defended\nphilosophically, nor grounded in terms of any particular values. More\nrecently, several theorists (Miller 2007; Meisels 2009; Gans 2003)\nhave sought to defend liberal nationalism, which involves articulating\nan account of how a nation can come to have a particular territory.\nThe structure of this argument\u2014identifying a link between the\nright-holding group (the nation) and the land\u2014has a Lockean\nstructure, but the right-holder is not the individual person, but\ninstead a collective\u2014the nation. \n\nWhat is a nation? David Miller defines a nation as \n\n\na community (1) constituted by shared beliefs and mutual commitments,\n(2) extended in history, (3) active in character, (4) connected to a\nparticular territory, and (5) marked off from other communities by its\ndistinct public culture. (Miller 1995: 27) \n\n\nThe connection to land is definitional of a nation. The\nrelationship between people and land is not simply assumed: rather, an\naccount is given of the inter-relationship between group culture and\nland. People who inhabit a certain territory shape the land that they\noccupy; their culture is mixed with the physical characteristics of\nthe land, and the physical characteristics shape the culture that they\ndevelop. Land has value for the people, both objective value, because\nthey improve it in various ways, building places of religious worship\nand developing cities and irrigating farmland; and subjective value,\nbecause the land comes to have symbolic significance for them, as they\nbury their dead in certain places, build monuments to significant\nhistoric achievements or losses, and so on. (Miller 2007:\n217\u2013218). In this way, a group comes to have a special\nrelationship to land that they occupy, and can make a better claim to\nthat land than any other group. This argument does not yet justify\nterritorial rights, however. This is established via a further\nargument that in order to maintain value (subjective and objective) in\nland, the people need to have jurisdictional authority over it (Miller\n2012: 263).\n\nThis argument has no difficulty explaining the wrong of conquest (even\nif the conquering state is more effective or objectively just than the\npolitical order that it replaces), since the link between the group\nand the land is established prior to the political order. Therefore\nany conquest of the land represents a violation of the interests,\nsubjective and objective, of group members. Although the contours or\nprecise boundaries of the nation are somewhat permeable, this type of\nargument is able to identify a group and then define the land to which\nthe group is entitled. It is not clear how exactly we are to\nadjudicate cases where two groups are subjectively and objectively\nattached to the same territory\u2014as with Jerusalem\u2014although\nMiller seems to think that a comparative assessment of the claims will\nbe able to yield conclusions in most cases, and in some cases will\nendorse a shared sovereignty arrangement (Miller 2014).\n\nOne key problem with this theory is that the territorial right-holder\nis conceived of as a \u2018nation\u2019, and some have argued that\nthis is problematic because potentially exclusionary. Proponents of\nthis argument endorse a liberal form of nationalism, so conceive of\nthe culture as a thin, public culture potentially inclusive of many\ndifferent groups in society. Nevertheless, one might think that any\nreference to a cultural nation suffers from both over-inclusion and\nunder-inclusion. The over-inclusion problem is that the actual\n\u2018cultural mixing\u2019 which is supposed to explain rights to\nland could also apply to cultural groups that are not nations, such as\nneighborhood cultures or sub-cultures in society. Do they not also mix\ntheir culture with the geographical area and so have right to protect\nthe value so created? Another sort of problem is that any reference to\n\u2018cultural nation\u2019 might seem to raise the problem of\nessentialism, which is that it rests on particular (essential)\nfeatures as necessary or important to the culture or nation, which\nthen has the effect of marginalizing people who do not share in that\nfeature (Moore 2019b). Miller is careful to offer a Wittgensteinian\nfamily resemblance conception of nations, which is designed to address\nthe problem of essentialism by not specifying that any particular\nfeature or value is necessary, but one may wonder whether this\nconceptual move is consistent with the account of \u2018value\u2019\nin the land, which may reify certain properties. \n",
