    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nJohn Dewey lead an active and multifarious life. He is the subject of\nnumerous biographies and an enormous literature interpreting and\nevaluating his extraordinary body of work: forty books and\napproximately seven hundred articles in over one hundred and forty\njournals.\n\nDewey was born in Burlington, Vermont on October 20, 1859 to Archibald\nDewey, a merchant, and Lucina Rich Dewey. Dewey was the third of four\nsons; the first, Dewey\u2019s namesake, died in infancy. He grew up\nin Burlington, was raised in the Congregationalist Church, and\nattended public schools. After studying Latin and Greek in high\nschool, Dewey entered the University of Vermont at fifteen and\ngraduated in 1879 at nineteen. After college, Dewey taught high school\nfor two years in Oil City, Pennsylvania. Subsequent time spent in\nVermont studying philosophy with former professor H.A.P. Torrey, along\nwith the encouragement of the editor of the Journal of Speculative\nPhilosophy, W.T. Harris, helped Dewey decide to attend graduate\nschool in philosophy at Johns Hopkins University in 1882. There, his\nstudy included logic with Charles S. Peirce (which Dewey found too\n\u201cmathematical\u201d, and did not pursue), the history of\nphilosophy (especially with George Sylvester Morris, and physiological\nand experimental psychology with Granville Stanley Hall (who trained\nwith Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig and William James at\n Harvard).[1]\n\nThough many years later Dewey attributed important credit to\nPeirce\u2019s pragmatism for his mature views, during graduate\nschool, Peirce had no sizable impact. Dewey\u2019s main graduate\nschool influences\u2014Neo-Hegelian idealism, Darwinian biology, and\nWundtian experimental psychology\u2014created a tension, which he\nsought to resolve. Was the world fundamentally biological, functional,\nand material or was it, rather, inherently creative and spiritual? In\nno small part, Dewey\u2019s career was launched by his attempt to\nmediate and harmonize these views. While they shared the idea of\n\u201corganism\u201d, Dewey also saw in both \u2014- and\nrejected\u2014any aspects deemed overly abstract, atomizing, or\nreductionistic. His earliest attempts to create a \u201cnew\npsychology\u201d (aimed at merging experimental psychology with\nidealism) sought a method by which experience could be understood as\nintegrated and whole. As a result, Dewey\u2019s early approach was a\nmodified, English absolute idealism. Two years after matriculating,\nDewey completed graduate school in 1884 with a dissertation\ncriticizing Kant from an Idealist position (\u201cThe Psychology of\nKant\u201d); it remains lost.\n\nWhile scholars still debate the degree to which Dewey\u2019s mature\nphilosophy retained early Hegelian influences, it is clear that the\npersonal influence on Dewey was profound. New England\u2019s\nreligious culture, Dewey recalled, imparted an \u201cisolation of\nself from the world, of soul from body, [and] of nature from\nGod\u201d, and he reacted with \u201can inward laceration\u201d and\n\u201ca painful oppression\u201d. His study (with George Sylvester\nMorris) of British Idealist T.H. Green and G.W.F. Hegel afforded Dewey\npersonal and intellectual healing: \n\n\nHegel\u2019s synthesis of subject and object, matter and spirit, the\ndivine and the human, was, however, no mere intellectual formula; it\noperated as an immense release, a liberation. Hegel\u2019s treatment\nof human culture, of institutions and the arts, involved the same\ndissolution of hard-and-fast dividing walls, and had a special\nattraction for me. (FAE, LW5: 153) \n\n\nPhilosophically, Dewey\u2019s early encounters with Hegelianism\ninformed his career-long quest to integrate, as dynamic wholes, the\nvarious dimensions of experience (practical, imaginative, bodily,\npsychical) that philosophy and psychology had defined as discrete.\n\nDewey\u2019s family and reputation as a philosopher and psychologist\ngrew while at various universities, including the University of\nMichigan (1886\u201388, 1889\u20131894) and the University of\nMinnesota (1888\u201389). At Michigan, Dewey developed long-term\nprofessional relationships with James Hayden Tufts and George Herbert\nMead. In 1886, Dewey married Harriet Alice Chipman; they had six\nchildren and adopted one. Two of the boys died tragically young (two\nand eight). Chipman had a significant influence on Dewey\u2019s\nadvocacy for women and his shift away from religious orthodoxy. During\nthis period, Dewey wrote articles critical of British idealists from a\nHegelian perspective; he read and taught James\u2019 Principles\nof Psychology (1890), and called his own view \u201cexperimental\nidealism\u201d (1894a, The Study of Ethics, EW4: 264).\n\nIn 1894, at Tuft\u2019s urging, President William Rainey Harper\noffered Dewey the position of head of the Philosophy Department at the\nUniversity of Chicago, which at that time included both Psychology and\nPedagogy. Attracted by the prospect of putting these disciplines into\nactive collaboration, Dewey accepted the offer, and began to build the\ndepartment by hiring G.H. Mead from Michigan and J.R. Angell, a former\nstudent at Michigan (who also studied with James at Harvard). Dubbed,\nby James, the \u201cChicago School\u201d Dewey along with Tufts,\nAngell, Mead and several others develop \u201cpsychological\nfunctionalism\u201d. He also published the seminal \u201cReflex Arc\nConcept in Psychology\u201d (1896, EW5; hereafter RAC), and\nbroke from transcendental idealism and from his church.\n\nAt Chicago, Dewey founded The Laboratory School, which provided a site\nto test his psychological and educational theories. Dewey\u2019s wife\nAlice was the school\u2019s principal from 1896\u20131904. Dewey\nbecame active in Chicago\u2019s social and political causes,\nincluding Jane Addams\u2019 Hull House, and Addams became a close\npersonal friend of the Dewey\u2019s. Dewey and his daughter and\nbiographer Jane Dewey credited Addams with helping him develop his\nviews on democracy, education, and philosophy; nevertheless, the\nsignificance of Dewey\u2019s intellectual debt to Addams is still\nbeing uncovered (\u201cBiography of John Dewey\u201d, Dewey 1939a;\nsee also Seigfried 1999, Fischer 2013).\n\nIn 1904, conflicts related to the Laboratory School lead Dewey to\nresign his Chicago positions and move to the philosophy department at\nColumbia University in New York City; there, he also established an\naffiliation with Columbia\u2019s Teacher\u2019s College. Among\nDewey\u2019s important influences at Columbia were F.J.E. Woodbridge,\nWendell T. Bush, W.P. Montague, Charles A. Beard (political theory)\nand Franz Boas (anthropology). Dewey remained at Columbia until\nretirement 1930, going on to produce eleven more books.\n\nIn addition to a raft of important academic publications, Dewey wrote\nfor many non-academic audiences, notably via the New\nRepublic; he was active in leading, supporting, or founding a\nnumber of important organizations including the American Civil\nLiberties Union, the American Association of University Professors,\nthe American Philosophical Association, the American Psychological\nAssociation, and the New School for Social Research. Dewey was spoke\nout in support of both progressive politics and social change during\nthe first part of the twentieth century. His renown as a philosopher\nand educator lead to numerous invitations; he inaugurated the Paul\nCarus Lectures (revised and published as Experience and\nNature, 1925), gave the 1928 Gifford Lectures (revised and\npublished as The Quest for Certainty, 1929), and gave the\n1933\u201334 Terry Lectures at Yale (published as A Common\nFaith, 1934a). He traveled for two years in Japan and China, and\nalso made notable trips to Turkey, Mexico, the Soviet Union, and South\nAfrica.\n\nIn 1946, almost two decades after Alice Chipman Dewey died (1927),\nDewey married Roberta Lowitz Grant. John Dewey died of pneumonia in\nhis home in New York City on June 1, 1952.\n\nShort Chronology of the Life and Work of John Dewey\n\nSource: H&A 1998, xiv\n\n1859 Oct. 20.
