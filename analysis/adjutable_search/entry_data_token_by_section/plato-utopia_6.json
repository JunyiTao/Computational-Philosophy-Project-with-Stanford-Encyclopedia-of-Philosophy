Poetry and Education\n\nThe goal of the city of the Laws, as we\u2019ve seen, is to\nproduce citizens who possess complete virtue (Laws\n630C3\u20136; see also e.g. 705D3\u2013706A4, 963A). The education\nin virtue of the citizens is, therefore, of central importance for the\nLaws: we are told early on that well-educated men will turn\nout to be good men and thus that it is of great importance for a state\nto educate its citizens well (Laws 641B). This makes the\neducation of the citizens a topic of great importance for interpreters\nof the Laws as well, especially insofar as understanding what\neffect the educational program of Magnesia can be expected to have on\nthe citizens will help us to understand what sort of virtue the\ncitizens can be expected to have.\n\nThe educational program of Magnesia begins with music and gymnastics,\nand Plato emphasizes the deep importance of this part of the\neducational program in various parts of the\n Laws.[40]\n The right nurture of children begins in the womb, and is described as\n\u201cpre-natal gymnastics\u201d: pregnant women are to walk, and,\nlater, nurses are to carry the children, so as to, as much as\npossible, have the children moved as though they were being constantly\nrocked by the sea (Laws 789B\u2013790C). From the ages of\nthree to six children are to play at prescribed games (Laws\n797B; but see also the claim, at 794A, that the games arise from\nnatural instinct). Plato in fact insists that childrens\u2019 games\nare of decisive importance for legislation, as a change in the games\nwill, he thinks, lead to a change in the childrens\u2019 standards\nfor propriety and impropriety; this will, in turn, lead to a change in\ntheir characters and in the laws they desire to be governed\n by.[41]\n At the age of six the sexes are to be divided and lessons in music\nand gymnastics begun. Both music and gymnastics include imitations of\nvirtuous people engaged in virtuous activities or exhibiting virtuous\ntraits, such as fighting courageously or feeling moderate pleasures\n(see e.g. Laws 655A\u2013655E, 660A, 795E\u2013796C, and\n814E\u2013816B); what it is to be well-educated in choristry is to\ndelight in and to hate the imitations that one ought, more so than to\nbe able to execute certain songs and dances skillfully (Laws\n654C\u2013D). This education in music and gymnastics is a lifelong\nprocess: citizens of Magnesia are meant to sing and dance in\nage-specific choruses for the rest of their lives, and are told that\nit is their duty to constantly encourage in themselves an appetite for\nethically improving songs (Laws 665C). The oldest chorus\nmembers participate in symposia in addition to singing, at least in\npart with the goal of making their souls soft and youthful, and thus\nonce again capable of being molded by the legislator (Laws\n671C\u2013D).\n\nIn addition to music and dance, children are given a literary\neducation, are taught to play the lyre, and learn arithmetic,\ngeometry, and astronomy (Laws 809C). The Athenian warns\nagainst having children read the poets, as, he says, each has said\nsome things badly, but declares that the text of the Laws\nitself and whatever other prose, poetry, or speeches should resemble\nit are appropriate for the children to study (Laws\n 811B\u2013E).[42]\n In arithmetic and geometry, the Athenian emphasizes how shameful it\nis for the citizens to be ignorant (as so many Greeks then were) of\nincommensurability (Laws 819E\u2013820D). The situation is\neven worse in astronomy: there, the common belief that the planets\nwander rather than traveling the same circular path is not only\nshameful but also impious, as it is a mistake about the gods\n(Laws 821A\u2013D).\n\nOne striking feature of the educational program in the Laws\nis its emphasis on music and gymnastics, from the very beginning up to\nthe very end of a life. What sort of impact does this type of\neducation have on the soul and how can we explain why it is so central\nto the educational program? In considering these questions, it is\nworth thinking about the educational program in the Republic\nas a contrast case: there the musical education given to the\nauxiliaries is said to be an education through habits which cannot\nproduce genuine virtue (Rep 522A4\u2013B1, cf.\n484C3\u2013D10 and\n 516E8\u2013517E2).[43]\n If we think that Plato wants the educational program of Magnesia to\nproduce something approaching genuine virtue in the citizens, then\nwe\u2019ll need to give an account of how music and dance can do more\nthan produce good habits in the citizens. (This is not to say that\nhabituation does not or cannot play an important role in the\neducational program: see e.g. Laws 656B.)\n\nOne recent\n strategy[44]\n that might explain the centrality given to education in music and\ngymnastics in the Laws begins with the following passage:\n\n[A]lmost without exception, every young creature is incapable of\nkeeping either its body or its tongue quiet, and is always striving to\nmove and to cry, leaping and skipping and delighting in dances and\ngames, and uttering, also, noises of every description. Now, whereas\nother creatures are devoid of any perception of the various kinds of\norder and disorder in movement (which we term rhythm and harmony), to\nus men the very gods, who were given, as we said, to be our fellows in\nthe dance, have granted the pleasurable perception of rhythm and\nharmony, whereby they cause us to move and lead our choirs\u2026\n(Laws 653D7\u2013654A3)\n\nThis passage tells us that human beings are capable of perceiving\norder in sound and motion and that they have natural tendencies\ntowards moving and making noise which provide the opportunity for that\ncapacity to perceive order to be trained. Insofar as good order is\nwhat makes things\n fine,[45]\n then the pleasurable perception of the good order in sound and motion\nwill be a way of appreciating finemaking properties, which could in\nturn help the child to acquire or refine the concepts of fineness and\ngoodness. And if this perception and resulting comprehension of order\nis cognitively continuous with the grip on order that is involved in\ngenuine virtue, then this also helps us show how this education could\nbe part of the acquisition of genuine\n virtue.[46],\n [47]\n\nCitizens of Magnesia, as we\u2019ve seen, also get a sophisticated\neducation in mathematics and astronomy. The particular results that\nthis education aims to impart may be significant. As Ian Mueller has\npointed out, incommensurability is itself a non-sensible property: two\n(physical) lines which represent incommensurable magnitudes will\nnonetheless appear to someone who measures them carefully to be\n commensurable.[48]\n Understanding the fact that there are some incommensurable segments\nthus crucially involves a grip on non-sensible properties, which is\nessential for coming to grasp genuine value\n properties.[49]\n The results aimed at in astronomical education are also significant:\ncircular motion is the motion associated with reason and thus the\ncircular motion of the gods is related to their status as paradigms of\nreason and of goodness.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen, then, that there are robust resources available for\nan interpreter of the Laws to show how the educational system\nof Magnesia could produce something like genuine virtue: their\neducation in music and dance may serve to give students an\nappreciation of order which will help them to grasp value concepts,\nand their mathematical and astronomical education may be designed to\nallow them to articulate those concepts and to see their role in\nstructuring the cosmos. There are, however, also reasons to worry\nabout how robust the virtue established by the educational system of\nMagnesia really is. The lifelong nature of education \u2013 and, in\nparticular, the striking claim that old men must participate in\nsymposia so as to make their souls young and malleable again \u2013\nsuggests that the virtue of the citizens is fragile enough to require\nconstant\n upkeep.[50]\n The way in which we account for what does or can go wrong to make the\ncitizens\u2019 virtue need reinforcement will also help us fix on the\nnature of that reinforcement and thus on the way in which the\neducational system affects the souls of the citizens more generally.\nMore research, then, is needed into the two interrelated questions of\nthe way in which the education given to the citizens of Magnesia has\nits effect and of what sort of virtue the educational program of\nMagnesia can or tends to produce.\n\nPlato also offers some discussion of the standards of music and poetry\nin their own right in the course of his discussion of education. As in\nother works, Plato is quite critical of the ethical content of poetry\nand the ethical knowledge possessed by the poet (see e.g.\nLaws 719A\u2013C, 811B\u2013E) and heavily censors the\npoetry that will be allowed into the city (see e.g. Laws\n657B, 719B\u2013D, 796E\u2013802E). Plato also here offers a\nsomewhat obscure discussion of the standard for correctness in music,\nsaying both that it must be judged by the pleasure of the virtuous man\n(Laws 659A) and that, because music is imitative, the\nstandard must involve not pleasure but truth, and that correct music\nis music which resembles the imitation of the beautiful (Laws\n 668A\u2013B).[51]\n",
