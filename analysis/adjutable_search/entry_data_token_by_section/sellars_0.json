    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\nWilfrid Stalker Sellars was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on 20 May\n1912, to Roy Wood and Helen Stalker Sellars.  His father was a\nsignificant philosopher in his own right, a professor at the\nUniversity of Michigan and a founder of American Critical Realism.\nWilfrid\u2019s childhood in Ann Arbor was interrupted for two years\nwhen he was 9: the family spent a year in New England, the summer at\nOxford, and the subsequent year in Paris, where Wilfrid attended the\nLyc\u00e9e Montaigne.  Returning to Ann Arbor, Sellars then attended\nthe high school run by the University\u2019s School of Education,\nwhere he particularly enjoyed mathematics.  Following his graduation\nin 1929, the family returned to Paris. Sellars entered the\nLyc\u00e9e Louis le Grand, where philosophy was in the curriculum\nand Marxism was in the air.  Not having discussed philosophy\npreviously with his father, he began in philosophy as a French\nMarxist, although his father\u2019s influence soon took precedence. (For a partial account of their philosophical connections, see F. Gironi 2017, 2018.)\nHe followed his year at the Lyc\u00e9e with six months in Munich,\npolishing his German.\nIn 1931 Sellars returned to Ann Arbor as an undergraduate\nphilosophy major, studying with his father, DeWitt Parker,\nC.H. Langford and others in Michigan\u2019s excellent department.\nAmong other things, he studied the work of Russell and Moore, modal\nlogic with Langford, and continued the dialogue with his father that\nhad begun in Paris.  At the height of the depression, Sellars was also\ninvolved in left-wing politics, campaigning for the socialist Norman\nThomas.  Because of his Lyc\u00e9e background, Sellars tested out of\na number of requirements, graduating college with his high school cohort in\n1933. He then enrolled at the University of Buffalo for an M.A., where he\nstudied Husserl and Kant with Marvin Farber.  \nSellars was a competitive athlete in college and won a Rhodes\nscholarship, which took him in the fall of 1934 to Oriel College at\nOxford, where he enrolled in the PPE program.  W. G. Maclagan was his\ntutor, and he came under the influence of H. A.  Prichard and\nH. H. Price, and, through them, Cook Wilson.  He took first class\nhonors in 1936 and returned that fall for a D. Phil., attempting a\ndissertation on Kant under T. D.  Weldon.  While at Oxford, he also\nmet his first wife, Mary Sharp, who was born in Yorkshire and to\nwhom he was married in 1938.  Unable to articulate his new\ninterpretation of Kant sufficiently well to complete the degree,\nSellars returned to the U.S. in the fall of 1937, entering the\ngraduate department at Harvard and passing his prelims in the spring\nof 1938. \nNewly married, Sellars was offered a job in 1938 at the University\nof Iowa by Herbert Feigl.  The department there was small, and Sellars\ntook charge of teaching the history of philosophy courses, working out\nthe view of the history of philosophy that informed his work\nthereafter.  But he never finished the dissertation at Harvard and was\nplagued for a number of years by an inability to get his thoughts down\non paper.  World War II interrupted his career; he served in the Navy\nfrom 1943\u201346.  When the war ended, Sellars had no choice\nbut to publish, and began a program of writing up to 10 hours a day,\nhowever much (or little) he produced.  Draft after draft of his first\nattempt slowly evolved into \u201cRealism and the New Way of\nWords.\u201d Once he established a writing process, Sellars began\npublishing steadily. For a thorough interpretation of Sellars\u2019 earliest publications, see P. Olen (2016, 2016).\nIn 1946, Sellars moved to the University of Minnesota, where he\nrejoined Feigl.  Together they published Readings in Philosophical\nAnalysis (1949), a classic early collection of analytical\nphilosophy, and founded Philosophical Studies, a leading\njournal of analytic philosophy.  With his colleague John Hospers,\nSellars published Readings in Ethical Theory (1952), which also\nbecame an industry standard.  Sellars chaired the department at\nMinnesota from 1952\u201359, a time which also saw the flowering of the\nMinnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science.\nIn the 1950s Sellars laid the groundwork for his systematic\napproach to philosophy in such path-breaking essays as \u201cSome\nReflections on Language Games\u201d (1954, expanded in 1963) and\n\u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy of Mind,\u201d (1956) which\nTyler Burge (1992: 33) has called \u201cthe most influential paper of\nthe period.\u201d He visited at Yale in 1958, moving there as a\ntenured professor in 1959.  But Yale became factionalized, and Sellars\nthought the internal politics disrupted his ability to do philosophy.\nIn 1963 he moved to the University of Pittsburgh, which was in the\nprocess of reconstructing its philosophy department, becoming\na top-ranked department.  Sellars remained at Pittsburgh until his\ndeath in 1989, though he visited and lectured at a number of other\nuniversities.  He also accrued a number of honors, giving the John\nLocke Lectures in 1965, the Matchette Foundation Lectures in 1971, the\nJohn Dewey Lectures in 1973, and the Carus Lectures in 1977.  Sellars\nwas elected President of the Eastern Division of the American\nPhilosophical Association in 1970.  He published many books and\narticles and also left his mark on the profession by training a large\nnumber of graduate students (this author included).  He was productive\ninto the early 1980s, when a stroke slowed him down; he died 2 July\n1989.  Following a lull in interest in his philosophy in the late\n1980s and early 1990s, his work has garnered steadily increasing attention in the U. S. and abroad.   \n",
