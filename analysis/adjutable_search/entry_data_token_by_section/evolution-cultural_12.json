For example, it is well-confirmed that\ncamouflage puts individual peppered moths at a selective advantage\nover less-well camouflaged individuals in the face of predation by\nbirds. However, theorists have regularly suggested that groups of\norganisms might also differ in their fitness, and that adaptations\npromoting group fitness might be favored by the action of selection at\nthis higher level (see the entry on\n units and levels of selection).\n In mainstream evolutionary theory, progress has been made in\ndisambiguating what is meant by group fitness\u2014it can mean either\nthe ability of a group to produce individual organisms, or the ability\nof a group to produce new groups\u2014and also in assessing how\nrobust the effects of group selection might be (Okasha 2006).\n\nSeveral leading theorists of cultural evolution have placed\nconsiderable stress on the importance of what they have called\nCultural Group Selection (sometimes abbreviated to \u201cCGS\u201d).\nCGS is a form of group-level selection that occurs when differences\nbetween groups of individuals are maintained by cultural inheritance.\nDarwin\u2019s own work on the emergence of human morality helps set\nthe scene for the sort of explanatory problem that a group selection\nprocess (whether cultural or otherwise) is apt to solve. He points out\nthat forms of morally admirable behavior that benefit others can be\nhard to explain using simple appeals to natural selection. In many\ncases it seems an individual\u2019s ability to leave offspring will\nbe promoted by selfish, rather than other-regarding, actions. However,\nthe detrimental effects of selection at the level of individuals can\nbe overcome if selection is efficient at a higher level:\n\n\nWhen two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into\ncompetition, if\u2026the one tribe included a great number of\ncourageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to\nwarn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe\nwould succeed better and conquer the other. (Darwin 1871: 162 [1877:\n130], wording from the 1877 edition which is slightly different than\nthe 1871 edition)\n\n\nDarwin writes of selection acting at the level of the\n\u201ctribe\u201d or the \u201ccommunity\u201d. What makes the\nappeal to higher-level selection salient is its potential ability to\noverride a countervailing force at the individual-level.\nIndividual-level selection promotes self-regard, says Darwin, but\ncompetition between tribes favors other-regard (at least with respect\nto other members of one\u2019s own tribe).\n\nThis feature is not always present in the recent invocations of CGS.\nConsider how Heyes (2018) understands CGS. She notes that cultural\ninheritance can often be \u201cdiffuse\u201d: a trait such as the\nability to ascertain what others are thinking and feeling\n(\u201cmind-reading\u201d) is acquired in part by close interaction\nwith one\u2019s parents as a baby, also by interaction with other\nrelatives and siblings, by engagement with other children, and by\nreflective exposure to sources such as novels and films under the\ninstruction of unrelated adults. In other words, these traits are\ninherited via complex crisscrossing networks. Heyes conjectures that\nthis form of inheritance tends to reduce variation within groups,\nthereby accentuating variation between groups, and establishing the\npossibility of \u201can adaptive response at the level of the social\ngroup\u201d (2018: 41). In a more detailed presentation of her\nunderstanding of cultural group selection, she envisages two groups\n(for simplicity she calls them Right and Left). Each group has a\ndifferent prevalent version of some important cognitive mechanism.\nMost people in Left have M, most people in Right have\nM*. M and M* are stable features of Left\nand Right respectively, because they are inherited via diffuse forms\nof learning within those groups. If M* better enables\nindividuals to carry out some significant function, then people in\nRight may end up having more biological offspring than people in Left.\nThis means the Right group does better overall than Left and\nM* increases its representation in the population as a\nwhole.\n\nWe do not take issue here with the potential efficacy of the mechanism\nHeyes proposes. We do, however, question whether it is a form of CGS.\nHeyes thinks of this as CGS because one group is more successful than\nthe other, and because the inheritance of the traits of interest\n(M and M*) is achieved through forms of learning.\nBut this need not indicate a distinctively group-level process of\nselection. This is the cultural analogue of an old-fashioned problem\nin mainstream evolutionary theory. A herd of fast-running deer will do\nbetter in terms of reproductive output than a herd of slow-running\ndeer, but it does not follow that this indicates selection at the\nlevel of the herd. Here, the herd as a whole does better because of\nthe individual-level selection processes going on within it (Williams\n1966).\n\nRicherson and Boyd\u2019s \u201cTribal Social Instincts\u201d\napproach to CGS is much more closely aligned with Darwin\u2019s own\nexplanation of features of human moral psychology. Their favored\nexplanatory hypothesis is a complex one, involving interaction between\nCGS and natural selection acting on genetic variation:\n\n\nSelection on tribes can account for the innate foundation of our\nsocial psychology via the process of gene-culture coevolution.\n(Richerson & Boyd 2005. See also: Boyd & Richerson 1985: Ch.\n7)\n\n\nThey argue, based on a mixture of historical, ethnographic and\ntheoretical work, for a scenario that begins with what they also call\n\u201ctribes\u201d\u2014they consider these to be ethnolinguistic\nunits of around 500 to 1500 people\u2014competing against each other\nin ways that are aided by culturally transmissible differences in\ngroup properties. This competitive process eventually produces\n\n\nculturally transmitted cooperative, group-oriented norms, and systems\nof rewards and punishments to ensure that such norms are obeyed.\n(Richerson & Boyd 2005: 196)\n\n\nOnce cultural transmission has established this social environment,\nnatural selection acting on genetic variation then favors an innate\npsychology that is suited to this new, socially-inherited set of\nenvironmental problems.\n\nThe Tribal Social Instincts hypothesis can be challenged on empirical\ngrounds: one can question the claims made about the innateness of the\nsocial psychological dispositions in question, the characterization of\nPleistocene social groups and conditions, the inability of more\ntraditional evolutionary resources to explain our altruistic\ntendencies, and so forth (see Birch 2017; Sterelny 2016, 2021b, 2022;\nand Birch & Buskell 2022). Such challenges are inevitable when a\nhypothesis is as ambitious as this one, and when it draws on such a\nvariety of supporting sources of data. There are also conceptual\nconcerns. The very idea of group selection has been a contested one\nwithin mainstream evolutionary theory. Some commentators have taken a\nskeptical view of group selection when underpinned by genetic\ninheritance, because of worries that competition based on genetic\nvariation within groups will tend to undermine the effects of\ncompetition between groups.\n\nSeveral cultural evolutionists (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 2009;\nHenrich 2016) reply that cultural inheritance processes are better\nable than processes of genetic inheritance to sustain between-group\ndifferences, for they believe there is good empirical and theoretical\nevidence that cultural processes can maintain within-group homogeneity\nin the face of various countervailing factors (immigration, unreliable\nimitation and so forth). This leads to further questions concerning\nhow, in general, to characterize CGS. Richerson, Baldini, et al.\n(2016) lists three different forms, of which straightforward\ncompetition between groups is just one variant. The second, selective\nimitation, happens when traits move from one group to another, when\nindividuals see their benefits and adopt them. The third, selective\nmigration, happens when individuals move from one group to another,\nonce again when they see the benefits of the traits in question. These\nare indeed additional ways by which behavioral traits that are of\nbenefit to a group can increase in frequency in a larger population of\ngroups. However, in the second two cases, trait frequencies are\nincreased simply by individuals\u2019 attraction to traits that they\nregard as bestowing collective benefits. Because two of these three\nprocesses are quite different to what one might think of as a central\ncase of CGS\u2014whereby groups compete against each\nother\u2014critics such as Morin (2016b) have argued that they are\nnot helpfully regarded as group selection processes at all.\n\nRicherson and colleagues shrug off these concerns about labeling:\n\n\nThe main thing all three have in common is that they are driven by\nvariation among groups. We are not wedded to any particular\nterminology in this matter. (Richerson, Baldini, et al. 2016: \u00a7\nR4)\n\n\nThese issues need not be merely terminological, for (as we suggested\nfor Heyes\u2019s work) they also raise basic theoretical concerns\nabout distinguishing individual-level selection from group-level\nselection. These concerns become especially acute in the context of a\nspecies able to observe and learn from others. For suppose individuals\nin group G1 slowly develop a process P1\u2014perhaps a form of\nprocessing food\u2014that gives each individual using it an advantage\nover the older technique P0. Within the neighboring group G2, everyone\nstill uses P0. Group G1 grows, flourishes, and expands its territory\nthanks to P1. Soon individuals in G2 notice the conspicuous success of\nthe ever-expanding G1, they notice their neighbors in G1 are mainly\nusing P1, and they start to adopt P1 as a consequence. This is a\nprocess whereby a group-beneficial trait spreads because of variation\nbetween groups. It is also an instance of selective imitation. But at\nleast in this case\u2014because of the payoffs of P1 compared with P0\nfor individuals\u2014to call it an instance of group selection\nthreatens to introduce confusion in the context of more general\nevolutionary theorizing. So selective imitation may sometimes be a\nmechanism for a form of group selection proper, but it need not always\nbe.\n",
