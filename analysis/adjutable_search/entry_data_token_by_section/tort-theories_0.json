    "main_text": "The Range of Torts\n1. The Range of Torts\n\nIn common law legal systems, as well as in what are often described as\n\u201cmixed\u201d common law/civil law systems such as those of\nIsrael and South Africa, most of tort doctrine developed through\ndecisions made by judges addressing private disputes. In the past\ncentury and a half, the diversity of common law jurisdictions and the\nintroduction of statutes and competing regulatory regimes have\nintroduced considerable diversity into the common law, in some cases\nentirely displacing parts of it. Despite such variation, the broad\ndoctrinal structure of the law of torts is fairly clear. It addresses\ntwo fundamental questions of human social interaction.\n\nFirst, tort law lays out the minimal forms of conduct that people are\nlegally entitled to demand of each other, prior to any arrangements\nthat they have made with each other. It does so by identifying and\narticulating a range of wrongs for which one person can claim against\nanother before a court and, if successful, be awarded a remedy. The\nmost prominent of these wrongs, both in the business of courts and in\nscholarly (particularly philosophical) discussions, is the tort of\nnegligence, which involves careless injury of one person by another.\nOther wrongs include defamation, deceit, trespasses to land and\nchattel, intentional torts against persons (such as battery, false\nimprisonment and private nuisance) and liability for dangerous or\ndefective products, as well as a range of more specialized torts, such\nas public nuisance, misfeasance in public office, the tort of\nstatutory breach, and constitutional torts (cases in which a private\ncitizen sues an official for a violation of the citizen\u2019s\nconstitutional rights).\n\nSecond, tort law addresses a question about whose problem it is when\nthings go wrong by generating and enforcing a remedial structure\nwithin which those who have been wronged can claim a remedy from the\nperson who has wronged them. In order to establish the remedial claim,\nthe complaining party (the \u201cplaintiff\u201d) must establish\nthat the act of the alleged wrongdoer (the \u201cdefendant\u201d)\nsatisfies each of the elements of the tort of which they complain.\n\nTort law protects each person\u2019s bodily integrity against both\nintentional and negligent interference; it protects each person\nagainst deceit by others; it protects each person\u2019s mental\nhealth against intentional infliction of emotional distress and\nnegligent infliction of psychiatric injury; it protects each\nperson\u2019s reputation against misstatements by others; it protects\nprivacy and freedom of movement against certain interferences; and it\nprotects property against various forms of interference, including\nunauthorized use, willful or careless damage and, in the special case\nof land, against unauthorized entry and loss of usefulness. No less\nsignificantly, the common law of torts declines to protect other\ninterests that might be thought equally pressing, such as the interest\nin adequate resources or a favorable context in which to pursue\none\u2019s purposes, the interest in assistance in times of urgent\nneed, and the interest in the continued availability of objects and\npeople on which one relies. Different explanations of the principle on\nwhich tort law decides which interests to protect will be considered\nbelow. It protects the interests that it does by articulating basic\nnorms of conduct, most of which are continuous with familiar moral\nideas. For example, the basic norm of negligence requires that people\nexercise appropriate care around the bodies and property of others, a\nmoral and social norm that figures in warnings given to children at\nplaygrounds. So, too, the basic norm of battery\u2014which in English\nlaw is characterized as \u201cunauthorized touching\u201d and in\nAmerican law as \u201charmful or offensive\ntouching\u201d\u2014reflects the admonition given to children to\nkeep their hands to themselves. In each case, tort law specifies and\nsystematizes these familiar ideas and makes them legal rather than\nmerely social or moral norms.\n",
