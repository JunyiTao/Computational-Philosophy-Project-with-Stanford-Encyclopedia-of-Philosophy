    "main_text": "General Background\n2. General Background\n\nBosanquet\u2019s philosophical views were in many ways a reaction to\n19th century Anglo-American empiricism and materialism\n(e.g., that of Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Alexander Bain),\nbut also to that of contemporary personalistic idealism (e.g., that of\nAndrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, James Ward, Hastings Rashdall, W.R.\nSorley, and J.M.E. McTaggart) and organicism (e.g., Herbert Spencer).\nBosanquet held that the inspiration of many of his ideas could be\nfound in Hegel, Kant, and Rousseau and, ultimately, in classical Greek\nthought. Indeed, while at the beginning of his philosophical career\nBosanquet described Kant and Hegel as \u201cthe great masters who\n\u2018sketched the plan\u2019\u201d (Muirhead 1935, p. 21; see\nBosanquet, Knowledge and Reality, p. vii), he said that the\nmost important influence on him was that of Plato. The result was a\nbrand of idealist philosophical thought that combined the Anglo-Saxon\npenchant for empirical study with a vocabulary and conceptual\napparatus borrowed from the continent. Bosanquet is generally\nconsidered to be one of the most Hegelian of the British Idealists,\nthough the extent to which the term \u2018Hegelian\u2019 is\nappropriate or illuminating in describing his work has been a matter\nof some debate (Sweet 1995).\n\nMore directly, Bosanquet\u2019s thought shows a number of\nsimilarities to that of T.H. Green, his teacher, and to Bradley, his\ncontemporary. Bosanquet himself acknowledges that these similarities\nare far from coincidental. He frequently admits his debt to\nGreen\u2019s works and, as late as 1920, he wrote that \n\n\nsince the appearance of Ethical Studies\u2026 I have recognized\n[Bradley] as my master; and there is never, I think, any more than a\nverbal difference or difference of emphasis, between us.(Letter to\nLello Vivante, 27 March 1920, cited in Muirhead 1935, p. 262)\n\n\nThere is, however, at least some hyperbole in such comments. Bosanquet\ndid not follow either Green or Bradley blindly (see Sweet 1996), and\nthere are important differences in his work. While he defended\nGreen\u2019s ethical theory and many of Green\u2019s conclusions, he\naddressed a number of issues never dealt with in Green\u2019s corpus.\nMoreover, while it is clear that Bosanquet considered Bradley\u2019s\nwork in metaphysics and ethics to have been momentous, this admiration\nwas no doubt influenced by the fact that Bradley\u2019s philosophy\nand method reflected interests and an approach that Bosanquet had\narrived at quite independently.\n",
