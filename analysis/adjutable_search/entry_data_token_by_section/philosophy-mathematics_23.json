    "main_text": "Special Topics || Mathematical Proof\n6. The Future\n\nIn the twentieth century, research in the philosophy of mathematics\nrevolved mostly around the nature of mathematical objects, the\nfundamental laws that govern them, and how we acquire mathematical\nknowledge about them. These are foundational concerns that\nare intimately connected with traditional metaphysical and\nepistemological questions.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, research in the\nphilosophy of science to a significant extent moved away from\nfoundational concerns. Instead, philosophical questions relating to\nthe growth of scientific knowledge and of scientific understanding\nbecame more central. As early as the 1970s, there were voices that\nargued that a similar shift of attention should take place in the\nphilosophy of mathematics. Lakatos initiated the philosophical\ninvestigation of the evolution of mathematical concepts\n(Lakatos 1976). He argued that the content of a mathematical concept\nevolves in roughly the following way. A mathematician formulates a\ndeep conjecture, but is unable to prove it. Then counterexamples\nagainst the conjecture are found. In response, the definition of one\nor more central concepts in the conjecture is changed in such a way\nthat the counterexamples are at least eliminated. Still the thus\nrevised conjecture cannot be proved, and gradually new counterexamples\nappear. The procedure of revising the definition of one or more\ncentral concepts is applied again and again, until a proof of the\nconjecture is found. Lakatos calls this procedure concept\nstretching. In recent decades, Lakatos\u2019 model of concept\nchange in mathematics has been revised and refined (Mormann 2002).\n\nFor some decades, the view that the philosophy of mathematics should\ntake a historical and sociological turn remained restricted to a\nsomewhat marginal school of thought in the philosophy of mathematics.\nHowever, in recent years the opposition between this new movement of\nmathematical practice on the one hand, and \u2018mainstream\u2019\nphilosophy of mathematics on the other hand, is softening.\nPhilosophical questions relating to mathematical practice, the\nevolution of mathematical theories, and mathematical explanation and\nunderstanding have become more prominent, and have been related to\nmore traditional themes from the philosophy of mathematics (Mancosu\n2008). This trend will doubtlessly continue in the years to come.\n\nFor an example, let us briefy return to the subject of computer proofs\n(see\n section 5.3).\n The source of the discomfort that mathematicians experience when\nconfronted with computer proofs appears to be the following. A\n\u201cgood\u201d mathematical proof should do more than to convince\nus that a certain statement is true. It should also explain\nwhy the statement in question holds. And this is done by\nreferring to deep relations between deep mathematical concepts that\noften link different mathematical domains (Manders 1989). Until now,\ncomputer proofs typically only employ fairly low level mathematical\nconcepts. They are notoriously weak at developing deep concepts on\ntheir own, and have difficulties with linking concepts in from\ndifferent mathematical fields. All this leads us to a philosophical\nquestion which is just now beginning to receive the attention that it\ndeserves: what is mathematical understanding?\n",
