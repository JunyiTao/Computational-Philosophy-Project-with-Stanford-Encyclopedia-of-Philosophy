    "main_text": "Perfectionism and Value Theory || Perfectionism and Pluralism\n1.2 Perfectionism and Pluralism\n\n\nThe distinction between human nature perfectionism and objective\ngoods perfectionism helps us approach an important question in value\ntheory. Must perfectionists be monists, holding that there is at\nbottom only one form of life that is best for all human beings; or can\nthey hold that there exists a plurality of equally good forms of life\nfor human beings? The question is important, since it is very\nplausible to think that the best life for one human being may differ\nfrom the best life for another.\n\n\nHuman nature perfectionism identifies the human good with the\ndevelopment of human nature. This looks like a monistic ideal,\none that identifies a single form of life as best for all human\nbeings. But, in fact, the ideal leaves many issues open.\nLet us stipulate that the best life for a human being is the life that\nmaximizes the development of his nature. Then, it still could be\ntrue that for different human beings different activities and pursuits\nwould best promote their good. This could be true, since\ndifferent people may be able to best develop different aspects of human\nnature. Given their temperament and talents, some do well to\nconcentrate on artistic pursuits, while others do well to focus on\ntheoretical studies or athletic achievements. Moreover, even\nthose who do well to focus on the same type of perfection, may find\nthat some activities and goals serve this end better for them than for\nothers. Finally, different tradeoffs between one\u2019s own\nperfection and the perfection of others may be rationally eligible and\nthis too will contribute to the plurality and variety of modes of life\nconsistent with the perfectionist ideal.\n\n\nThe compatibility of objective goods perfectionism and value pluralism\nalso can be established. One need only assume that some perfectionist\ngoods are either roughly equal or incomparable in value (Finnis 1980,\nRaz 1986). Friendship and understanding, for example, may both be\nperfectionist goods, but they may not be comparable in a way that\nallows us to rank lives that realize these goods to different\ndegrees. More generally, perfectionist goods may be combinable in\ndifferent proportions, yielding a range of different types of life\nthat are valuable and worthy of pursuit.  The adjective\n\u201cperfect\u201d when applied to a human life suggests one that\nis maximally good or excellent, but if goods conflict and are\nincomparable, or if combinations of goods are of equal or incomparable\nvalue, then a plurality of different types of life may have a title to\nthat designation\u2014or perhaps no life can be strictly perfect, but\nmany can be very good.\n\n\nNothing said here, of course, rules out the possibility that there\nreally is only one way of life that is maximally best for human\nbeings. The point pressed is merely that perfectionism is\nconsistent with value pluralism. Put otherwise, if objective\ngoods are plural and incomparable, as many recent writers maintain,\nthen this fact about the nature of value does not undercut the\nplausibility of perfectionism, of either the human nature or objective\ngoods variety. To be sure, a plausible perfectionism will\nrecognize that pluralism has its limits. Perfectionist value\ntheory seeks to identify goods and activities that human beings ought\nto preserve, promote and engage with. It implies that some ways\nof living are not valuable for human beings, even if they are fully\nembraced.\n",
