    "main_text": "Logical Approaches || Objections to Nonmonotonic Logic\n5.9 Objections to Nonmonotonic Logic\n5.9.1 Confusing Logic and Epistemology?\n\nIn an early paper (Israel 1980), David Israel raised a number of\nobjections to the very idea of nonmonotonic logic. First, he\npointed out that the nonmonotonic consequences of a finite theory are\ntypically not semi-decidable (recursively enumerable). This remains\ntrue of most current systems, but it is also true of second-order\nlogic, infinitary logic, and a number of other systems that are now\naccepted as logical in nature.\n\nSecondly, and more to the point, Israel argued that the concept of\nnonmonotonic logic evinces a confusion between the rules of\nlogic and rules of inference. In other words, Israel accused defenders\nof nonmonotonic logic of confusing a theory of defeasible inference (a\nbranch of epistemology) with a theory of genuine consequence relations\n(a branch of logic). Inference is nonmonotonic, but logic (according\nto Israel) is essentially monotonic.\n\nThe best response to Israel is to point out that, like deductive\nlogic, a theory of nonmonotonic or defeasible consequence has a number\nof applications besides that of guiding actual inference. Defeasible\nlogic can be used as part of a theory of scientific explanation, and\nit can be used in hypothetical reasoning, as in planning. It can be\nused to interpret implicit features of stories, even fantastic ones,\nso long as it is clear which actual default rules to suspend. Thus,\ndefeasible logic extends far beyond the boundaries of the theory of\nepistemic justification. Moreover, as we have seen, nonmonotonic\nconsequence relations (especially the preferential ones) share a\nnumber of very significant formal properties with classical\nconsequence, warranting the inclusion of them all in a larger family\nof logics. From this perspective, classical deductive logic is simply\na special case: the study of indefeasible consequence.\n5.9.2 Problems with the Deduction Theorem\n\nIn a recent paper, Charles Morgan (Morgan 2000) has argued that\nnonmonotonic logic is impossible. Morgan offers a series of\nimpossibility proofs. All of Morgan\u2019s proofs turn on the fact\nthat nonmonotonic logics cannot support a generalized deduction\ntheorem, i.e., something of the following form:\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{p\\} \\dproves q\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\dproves\n(p \\Rightarrow q)\\)\n\n\nMorgan is certainly right about this.\n\nHowever, there are good grounds for thinking that a system of\nnonmonotonic logic should fail to include a generalized\ndeduction theorem. The very nature of defeasible consequence ensures\nthat it must be so. Consider, for example, the left-to-right\ndirection: suppose that \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{p\\} \\dproves q\\). Should it\nfollow that \\(\\Gamma \\dproves (p \\Rightarrow q)\\)? Not at all. It may\nbe that, normally, if \\(p\\) then \\(\\neg q\\), but \\(\\Gamma\\) may\ncontain defaults and information that defeat and override this\ninference. For instance, it might contain the fact \\(r\\) and the\ndefault \\(((r \\amp p) \\Rightarrow q)\\). Similarly, consider the\nright-to-left direction: suppose that \\(\\Gamma \\dproves (p \\Rightarrow\nq)\\). Should it follow that \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{p\\} \\dproves q\\)? Again,\nclearly not. \\(\\Gamma\\) might contain both \\(r\\) and a default \\(((p\n\\amp r) \\Rightarrow \\neg q)\\), in which case \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{p\\}\n\\dproves \\neg q\\).\n\nIt would be reasonable, however, to demand that a system of\nnonmonotonic logic satisfy the following special deduction\ntheorem:\n\n\\(\\{p\\} \\dproves q\\) iff \\(\\varnothing \\dproves (p \\Rightarrow q)\\)\n\n\nThis is certainly possible. The special deduction theorem holds\ntrivially; if we define\\(\\{p\\} \\dproves q\\) as \\(\\varnothing \\vDash(p\n\\Rightarrow q)\\); that is, \\(\\{p\\}\\) defeasibly entails \\(q\\) if and\nonly if (by definition) \\((p \\Rightarrow q)\\) is a theorem of the\nclassical conditional\n logic.[9]\n",
