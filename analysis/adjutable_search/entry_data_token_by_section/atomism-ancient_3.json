    "main_text": "Atomism in Classical Indian Philosophy || Jaina atomism\n1.3 Jaina atomism\n\nJaina atomist theory treats matter, space and time as composed of\nindivisible smallest parts (Pines 1987). Although natural philosophy\nmay not have occupied a large role in Jaina thought, the reason for\npositing atoms is as the ultimate cause of perceived physical\nqualities (Nyayavijayaji 1998). They posited a homogenous matter out\nof which every material body is composed, in contrast to the atomism\nof the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and Buddhist systems, which\nposited atoms of different kinds for each of the elements earth,\nwater, fire and air (Gangopadhyaya 1980). Atoms thus bring different\nproperties to aggregates, as, for example, the addition of water atoms\ncauses earth atoms to stick together (Dasgupta 1987). The tendency of\natoms to cohere into aggregates was thought to come from their own\nnature and not from external pressures (Nyayavijayaji 1998).\n\nJaina atomists also regarded soul as a distinct kind of entity,\nalthough they held that material atoms can percolate into soul and\naffect it. Space was also treated as a distinct kind of substance\n(Mehta 1954). Jaina tradition claims to have been the oldest atomist\nsystem and to have inspired Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism, although\nrecent scholarship suggests that the reverse is true (Matilal 1977,\n60; Thakar 2003, 7\u20138, 450).\n",
