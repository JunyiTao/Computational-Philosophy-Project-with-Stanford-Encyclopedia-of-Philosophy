    "main_text": "\n1. Domination: The Basic Idea\n\nThere is, of course, considerable disagreement about what\ndomination really is. Even so, theorists of domination tend to agree\nabout this much: domination is a kind of unconstrained, unjust\nimbalance of power that enables agents or systems to control other\nagents or the conditions of their actions. We can call this \u201cthe\nbasic idea\u201d of domination. The basic idea has the following\ncomponents:\n\nDomination is a kind of power, and usually social\npower\u2014that is, power over other people.\nDomination involves imbalances or asymmetries in power. The\nEnglish domination comes from the Latin dominus. A\ndominus is a master, and mastery represents an extreme of\nsocial power. Masters usually have all but complete control over how\ntheir slaves will act or over the conditions in which they act. As a\nresult, the master/slave relation is often treated as the most obvious\ncase of domination.\nDomination has many forms. Traditional Roman republicanism\nrecognized a distinction between imperium and\ndominium\u2014domination by the state contrasted with\ndomination by private parties (Pettit 1997; 31; 2001: 152ff). The\npower a master has over a slave may be the clearest case of\ndomination, but it is not necessary to have a literal dominus\nin order to be dominated. For example, tyrants over their subjects and\nmen over women in patriarchal societies are also common examples of\ndomination. Combined with the master/slave, these examples are so\ncommon in the literature that we can refer to them together simply as\nthe Paradigms. Failure to explain why the Paradigms count as\ndomination is sometimes considered reason enough to reject a theory of\ndomination (see Lovett 2010, Blunt 2015, and McCammon 2015). Other\nexamples may not manifest the extremes of power we see in the\nParadigms; but it is generally agreed that domination comes in\ndegrees, and that someone may be dominated even if nobody has total\npower over them.\nDominating power is in some sense unconstrained. It is\nup to masters how they will or will not use their power. Such power is\noften described as arbitrary or discretionary; or,\nperhaps, unlimited by the interests of those under its sway; or,\nperhaps, projects only the vision of the world most favorable to the\nempowered while preventing the subjugated from seeing themselves or\nthe world on their own terms. However it is characterized, that claim\nthat domination counts as such because of the absence of some limit\nrecurs in many theories.\nDomination is an unjust or morally illegitimate form of social\npower. Whatever domination turns out to be, it is morally serious. It\nis a complaint (Pettit 2005). To be dominated is typically to have\ncause for indignation and resentment against the dominator or against\ninstitutions that dominate or make domination possible.\n\n\nMuch contemporary disagreement about domination involves competing\nanswers to three questions: (1) Who, or what, can dominate? (2) Is it\npossible to dominate merely by having power with a certain\nstructure, or is domination an exercise or an abuse\nof power? (3) Exercised or unexercised, what kind of power is\ndomination? The remainder of this entry will address each of these\nquestions in turn, then conclude with a survey of how the idea of\ndomination has been used in recent applied ethical theory. It will\nbecome clear as we examine competing answers to these three questions\nthat different theorists have very different ideas of why, exactly, we\nneed a theory of domination. There may be wide agreement that we need\nthe idea of domination to make sense of unjust power relations, but\nunjust power relations are wildly varied, and theorists of domination\ndisagree not only about which varieties most need to be understood,\nbut about how theorizing domination helps us to understand them. \n\nAnother word of qualification before proceeding: what follows is a\nsurvey of work almost entirely from Anglophone political philosophers\nand political theorists, broadly within the Analytic tradition. For\ntheories of domination from the Continental tradition, see the entry,\n feminist perspectives on power.\n2. Who, or What, Can Dominate?\n2.1 Domination by Agents, Group Agents, and Groups\n\nThe neorepublican tradition (i.e., the tradition of thinking about\ndomination associated primarily with the historical scholarship of\nQuentin Skinner and the political theory of Philip Pettit) tends to\npresent domination as a relation between agents; only agents can\ndominate or be dominated (Pettit 1997: 52), though the agent/agents\nmight be a group or collective. Domination by groups may not require\nthat they do so as a group agent (List & Pettit 2011:\n19\u201341). The metaphysics of group agency usually require shared\nbeliefs or joint intentions among the members of the group; but,\ndominating power may be grounded in group membership (white people in\nWestern racialized hierarchies, men in patriarchy) even if that group,\nor some of its members, do not meet the metaphysical requirements for\ngroup agency. At least for those who think unexercised power is\nsufficient for domination, a man who rejects the patriarchy of his\nsociety may still dominate women because of what he is in a position\nto do\u2014e.g., have his testimony in court taken more seriously\nthan a woman\u2019s\u2014even if he explicitly rejects and tries to\nundermine patriarchal institutions.\n\nA minority position in the literature sees domination fundamentally as\na relation between groups, where any domination between individuals is\nparasitic on group membership. If this is true, the domination of one\nindividual by another counts as such only because one belongs to a\ndominant group and the other belongs to a subordinate group\n(Wartenberg 1990).\n2.2 Can Non-Agents Dominate?\n\nThat agents alone can be dominated is rarely disputed; but can agents\nalone dominate? What about non-agents like institutions or systems or\nideologies? Vaclav Havel\u2019s (1991: 136\u2013138) example of a\ngrocer in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia recurs in the literature as a\npossible example of domination by a system, where particular agents\nare merely conduits (Lovett 2010; Krause 2013; Blunt 2015). The grocer\nposts slogans favorable to the regime in the window of his shop. By\nposting the slogans, he both signals his cooperation with power and\nextends its reach. Similarly, Sharon Krause (2013: 194) recalls her\nmother\u2019s insistence that she take smaller, more\n\u201cladylike\u201d, steps and overcome her natural stride. Perhaps\nthe ideology Krause\u2019s mother both obeys and enforces is what\ndominates, rather than any particular agent or agents (see also\nFoucault 1975 [1977: 26\u201327]). Workers who have deeply imbibed\nthe values of capitalism might be another example (see Thompson 2013,\n2018): e.g., someone who accepts whatever meaningless work is\navailable because their sense of self-worth depends on not being a\n\u201cslacker\u201d. While it may be that the values of capitalism\nare a social construct produced over time by agents for their own\nbenefit, if what motivates the worker is their own corrupted sense of\nself-worth, it makes sense to think that they might be dominated by an\nideology rather than other agents.\n\nThe central question is whether we can understand possible examples of\ndomination by systems or ideologies as instances of domination\nby agents through systems or ideologies. An\naffirmative answer is more often assumed than argued for in the\nliterature, but Frank Lovett tries to motivate it with this\nexample:\n\n\nImagine a society in which the law of property recognizes the\npossibility of ownership in human beings, but in which it just happens\nthat there are as yet no slaves. After some time, however, slaves are\nimported, and the law duly supports their masters\u2019 rights of\nownership. Later still, the masters repent, and manumit their slaves.\n(2010: 48\u201349)\n\n\nLovett thinks we will agree that domination occurs only during the\nperiod after slaves are imported and before their manumission: the\nlegal system that allowed property in slaves enabled\ndomination but did not dominate.\n\nThe proposed lesson of another thought experiment\u2014this one from\nGwilym David Blunt (2015: 17\u201318)\u2014is that domination without\nagents is conceivable but impracticable, at least in the near term.\nSuppose, a legislator organized a dominating regime and died soon\nafter, but not before programming \u201ca series of automatons\n\u2026 that cannot be reprogrammed\u201d to enforce his will\nagainst a subordinate group in the name of a privileged group. If this\nis domination, it cannot be domination by the deceased legislator (on\nthe assumption that the dead have no agency), or by the automatons\n(who are assumed to be not sophisticated enough to count as agents),\nor by the privileged population (who did not write the laws and cannot\ncontrol the automatons); therefore, it must be the system itself that\ndominates.\n\nIn general, the disagreement about whether agents alone dominate\ntracks the division between theories directly influenced by\nneorepublicans and those descended from other traditions. The\nneorepublican preoccupation with the master/slave relation makes it\nnatural to focus on domination by agents: to be dominated by a master\nis, obviously, to be dominated by an agent. Working from this central\nexample, the republican tradition tends to see institutions, systems,\nand ideologies as sources of power that make mastery possible rather\nthan as standalone sources of domination without agents. If, instead,\nour attention is focused on the ways power can shape the consciousness\nof those under its sway, domination by, e.g., patriarchy itself\nbecomes more plausible, even without the looming presence of\nparticular patriarchs.\n3. Does Domination Require the Exercise of Power?\n3.1 Domination as a Power Structure\n\nOne of the most persistent recent disagreements concerns whether or\nnot domination requires the exercise of power. Neorepublicans tend to\nlink domination to what agents are in a position to do or\nhave the capacity to do rather than what agents actually do.\nThis is mostly because of the role domination plays within\nneorepublican ideas of freedom. The classical liberal theory of\nfreedom\u2014the neorepublican\u2019s primary competitor and\nfoil\u2014is supposedly defective just because it identifies freedom\nwith the absence of actual choice-interference.\nNeorepublicans say their advantage is the way they highlight how\npotential interference reduces freedom. This is the point of\nthe most famous example from the republican tradition: the slaves of a\nkind or lazy master are slaves nonetheless, and so are\nparadigmatically unfree even though their master is too kind or lazy\nto interfere with them.\n\nWhat does it look like to have power that counts as domination even\nthough unexercised? In addition to the language encountered above\nhighlighting the \u201ccapacities\u201d of the powerful,\nneorepublicans emphasize what Lovett (2010) calls the\nstructure instead of the outcome of dominating power\nrelations. Whether or not an employer can fire their employees at will\nis about how the employer/employee relationship is structured; whether\nor not an employer actually fires an employee, or whether or not the\nemployee manages not to starve because they have the job, manifests\nthe outcome of the relationship. This way of examining social\nrelationships looks away from how empowered agents exercise their\npower to the nature of that power itself. We do not stop objecting to\nparadigmatic dominators merely because they promise to make kind and\njudicious use of their powers; emancipation seems to require that they\ncease to have that kind of power. This highlights\nneorepublican doubts about whether self-regulation by the powerful can\nreduce domination (Lovett 2010: 97). At an extreme, Pettit has said\nthat domination persists without \u201cexternal checks that remove or\nreplace the interference option or put it cognitively off the\nmenu\u201d; that domination is reduced only by\n\u201cexogenous\u201d forces; or, if internal, forces that\n\u201cdisable\u201d in the manner of deep-seated neuroses (2012:\n63). \n3.2 Does Character Matter after All?\n\nThere are two primary lines of objection to the claim that only a\nchange in how power relations are structured can check domination,\nrather than changes to the outcome of the relation or to the character\nof the empowered. The first is that it fails to capture realities of\nwhat the dominated really object to; the second is that it leads to\nsignificant over-generalization.\n\nNo one denies that victims of power object to the outcomes of its use,\nand not merely to their initial vulnerability to that power.\n(Certainly, neorepublicans want to say that both are\nobjectionable.) But if we insist that domination refers properly only\nto the structure of a power relation, and not to outcomes of that\nrelation, we may have a difficult time explaining the standard use of\ndomination to refer to overwhelming power wielded against the\ndefenseless. Suppose Columbus had merely sailed around the margins of\nthe \u201cNew World\u201d without making landfall, and that his\npower to exploit and destroy native cultures was never exercised. Is\nthis counterfactual history still a story of European domination? If\nnot, it is tempting to identify European domination with the actual\nharm inflicted on people who were not equipped to resist them (Katz\n2017).\n\nThere is reason to think, too, that the dominated sometimes have\ncomplaints specifically about the character of the powerful. This\nissue has been revisited in the work of Christopher Lebron (2013) and\nMelvin Rogers (forthcoming). Rogers especially insists that theories\nof domination influenced by neorepublicanism overplay the irrelevance\nof character to dominating power. His recent work on black American\nrepublicans like Martin Delany (1852 [1968]), Hosea Easton (1837\n[1999]), Maria W. Stewart (1987), David Walker (1829 [2003]), reveals\na contrasting emphasis on the \u201ccomportment\u201d of white\nAmericans. Opposing race-based systems of domination requires not just\n\u201cfreedom from the arbitrary power\u201d of white Americans, but\na \u201ctransformation of the system of cultural value in which\nblacks occupy a lower position of worth\u201d (Rogers, forthcoming).\nThis transformation requires not only the external checks on\ndomination achievable by legal reforms, but a transformation in the\nhearts of white Americans. Rogers argues that neorepublican theories\nof domination are formed by resistance to political slavery,\nwhere the essential humanity of the slave is not in question; unlike\nchattel slavery, which was built on and maintained by an\nideological commitment to white supremacy and black inferiority. Legal\nreforms may be sufficient to counter political slavery: they represent\na turn of the legal order toward closer alignment with the already\nacknowledged value of the enslaved. However, legal reforms alone,\nwhile necessary, are not enough when this value is systematically\ndenied.\n3.3 Over-Generalization Problems for Structure-Based Accounts\n\nOver-generalization worries are the most common objection to\nneorepublican approaches to domination. If domination is just the\ncapacity for arbitrary interference, and given that such\ncapacities seem ubiquitous, domination may be ordinary to the point of\ntriviality. Even when sitting around minding their own business,\nphysically strong people have the capacity to overpower weaker people;\neven if they never do, people with a natural gift for persuasion have\nthe capacity to talk the gullible out of their savings (Friedman 2008:\n251). Also, if the primary function of the state is to minimize\ndomination, neorepublicanism suggests that the state should try to\nmake people less strong or less persuasive in order to reduce their\ncapacity for arbitrary interference. That is unsavory. An obvious fix\nis to insist that only \u201cactual or attempted arbitrary\ninterference\u201d dominates (Friedman 2008: 252).\n\nFor some feminists, the over-generalization worry is specifically that\nneorepublicans make relationships of care and dependency unreasonably\nsuspect. A caregiver who would not dream of harming their charges\nnevertheless has the capacity to: infecting wounds instead of cleaning\nthem, throwing someone down the stairs instead of helping them up\n(Friedman 2008: 254). Pettit acknowledges this feature of his theory\nwhen he claims that caring and uncaring mothers\u2014and presumably\ncaring and uncaring fathers\u2014alike dominate their children in a\nstate of nature (Pettit 1999: 119\u2013120). The alternative is to\ninsist that though care providers may stand in a relationship of\nunequal power with a vulnerable dependent, unless this power is abused\nit does not dominate. Domination, instead of mere power, requires\nactive violation of moral standards and/or compromising the best\ninterests of others (Kittay 1999: 33\u201334).\n\nThe attractiveness of this alternate depends on how we understand\npowers or capacities. If A has a power or capacity to interfere\nso long as it is possible in any sense for A to do so,\nas Pettit sometimes suggests, criticism focusing on the value of care\nis damaging: clearly, it is [e.g.] physically possible for caregivers\nand parents to interfere with their dependents. If, however, A\ndoes not have the power to interfere so long as appropriate penalties\nare in place for such interference, the objection may not be so\npotent. In other words, it\u2019s not mere possibility that matters,\nbut social or legal possibility\u2014roughly, what it is possible to\ndo without risk of sanction from other members of your social group or\nby agents of the state (see List & Valentini 2016). A hallmark of feminist\nethics and political philosophy has been the insistence that power\nrelations inside the home often manifest domination, even though the\nhome can be a center of loving care and dependence, and that legal\nregulation\u2014against spousal abuse or child neglect\u2014might\nreduce that domination (Costa 2013: 928). Such laws, of course, do not\nmake interference impossible simpliciter; instead, it makes\ninterference risky and potentially costly.\n\nAlso, shifting from domination as mere power to domination as abuse of\npower may lead to other unattractive results, especially given broadly\nfeminist commitments. If domination requires actual or attempted\ninterference, women who avoid interference by \u201cseduction,\ningratiation, [or] avoidance\u201d will not count as dominated (Costa\n2013: 926). This feature of neorepublican accounts\u2014the\ninsistence that domination is the \u201cmere condition of being\nvulnerable\u201d\u2014may be exactly what makes the concept useful\nfor feminist philosophy (Laborde 2008: 152).\n\nThere are other proposed counter-examples to the claim that the\n\u201ccapacity to interfere \u2026 at will\u201d dominates\n(Shapiro 2016: 21). What about \u201ca playground bully\u201d who is\n\u201cable to beat up any of the smaller children but is widely known\nonly to beat up black children\u201d? Does the bully dominate the\nwhite children just as much as the black children? What about someone\nlike 1950s American senator Joseph McCarthy? He had the same power to\ninterfere in the lives of right-wing and left-wing Americans; but\ncitizens on the left had far more reason to fear him. Perhaps the\nintuitive judgment here is that the bully only dominates the black\nchildren, and that McCarthy only dominates left-wing citizens. (Both\nexamples are from Ian Shapiro 2012: 324; 2016: 21). It should be\nnoted, however, that the persuasiveness of these examples depends in\npart on whether we think domination is the sole political evil, at\nleast in the sense that all other political evils can be addressed\nmost effectively by minimizing domination. The black children and the\nleft-wing citizens in Shapiro\u2019s examples are obviously worse off\nthan the white children/right-wing citizens. If we diagnose their\ncondition only by appeal to the evil of domination, Shapiro\u2019s\nexamples are damaging to the idea that domination can be an\nunexercised power. This is true even though there may not be much\npractical space between Shapiro\u2019s account of domination and\nPettit\u2019s, given that Shapiro speaks of complaints against\ndomination as complaints against a \u201cpower relationship\u201d.\nInterestingly, Shapiro emphasizes the possibility that someone may be\nvulnerable to domination without being dominated, and that\nvulnerability to domination\u2014like domination itself\u2014is\nmorally significant and represents an injustice (2016: 22). While the\nidea of domination as vulnerability recurs in the\nneorepublican literature, there is relatively little examination of\nthis intermediate category: those who are vulnerable to domination\nwithout being dominated. (Perhaps the closest consideration in\nPettit\u2019s work is his brief discussion of \u201cvirtual\ndomination\u201d in 1997: 54.)\n\nThe controversy about whether completely dormant power can dominate\ncontinues, but there is broad consensus that you can be dominated even\nif nobody is actively dominating you at the moment. Even if\nthere is no domination without an actual display of power over you or\npeople like you at some time, domination might persist when\nunexercised precisely because of its previous exercise. As Wartenberg\n(1990) says, the actual exercise of power can \u201ccondition\u201d\na social relationship in a \u201clongstanding\u201d manner. If power\nhas been exercised over you in the past, or over someone like you\n(perhaps because you are both members of a subordinated social group),\nthis will affect how you relate to those in power. For example,\nsuppose you know that the boss can fire you at will. He has not fired\nyou or even threatened to do so, and so has not actually exercised his\npower over you. Even so, you have seen him exercise this power over\nother employees. As a result, you do whatever you\u2019re told for\nfear of what the boss can do to you and has done to\nothers. This motivates the view that your domination does not require\nthe active exercise of power against you even though it might require\nthe active exercise of power against someone relevantly like\nyou. Of course, this leads to further questions: e.g., How recent must\nactive exercises of power be in order to condition ongoing social\nrelationships where power is dormant? Such questions have received\nrelatively little attention thus far (but see Hirschmann 2003). \n4. What Kind of Power Is Domination?\n\nExercised or unexercised, what kind of power is domination? If\ndomination is about how social relationships are structured, what is\nA in a position to do if A dominates B? If\ndomination requires the exercise of power, how does A use their\npower when they dominate B?\n\nAlong one dimension, we can sort answers to these questions into the\nmoralized vs. the non-moralized. For a moralized\ntheory, identifying domination requires us to settle more foundational\nquestions about what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust. For\nexample, if we say that dominating power is the power to violate human\nrights, our theory of domination depends on a theory of human\nrights\u2014obviously a moral theory. Non-moralized theories hold\nthat we can identify domination without reference to theories of the\nright or the good. For example, if we say that dominating power is\npower over the means of production, our theory of domination will\ndepend on a [plausibly] descriptive theory of what counts as the means\nof production. \n\nOf course, those who insist that domination can be defined without\nmaking moral judgments aren\u2019t usually committed to what Ian\nCarter calls \u201cvalue-independence\u201d about the phenomenon, or\n\u201cthe complete detachment of our analysis from all ethical\nconcerns\u201d (2015: 280\u2013281). Contributions to the contemporary discussion of\ndomination from all-comers are generally motivated by profound ethical\nconcerns.\n\nSorting is also required along another dimension. In addition to\nquestions of moralization or non-moralization, there is the question\nof how domination relates to the use of power to dictate norms and\nrules, or the use of power to claim authority. Is domination always an\nattempt to rule? Does domination always involve a claim\u2014however\nmistaken\u2014by dominators that their power is legitimate? Does\ndomination always involve an attempt by the powerful to demand that\nthe dominated conform to norms? If you answer any of these questions\nin the affirmative, you advocate a norm-dependent theory of\ndomination.\n\nConfusion is easy here, given that moralized theories often appeal to\nnorms and rules. The difference between such moralized theories and\nnon-moralized but norm-dependent theories depends on the difference\nbetween correct moral norms/rules as distinguished from just\nany norm or rule. Norm-dependent theories say that domination always\ninvolves power exercised through norms and rules that some regard as\nlegitimate\u2014perhaps the dominator, perhaps the dominated, or\nperhaps both. As we will see, for theories that are not just\nnorm-dependent but also moralized, domination always involves\na failure to respect the moral status of agents as sources of the\nnorms that govern them. For a merely norm-dependent theory, the\ndomination of a patriarch might be essentially connected to the\npatriarch\u2019s claim that he deserves obedience from his family.\nObviously, whether or not someone claims or doesn\u2019t claim to\ndeserve obedience is a merely descriptive matter; as a result, such a\ntheory is not moralized. The legitimacy of the patriarch\u2019s\nauthority is merely sociological, not moral. If a theory of domination\nsays instead that the patriarch dominates because his demand for\nobedience unjustly undermines the right of his spouse and children to\nshape the norms that govern them, that theory is both norm-dependent\nand moralized. A theory that depends in part on an account of\nunjust infringements is clearly moralized.\n\nIt is not always easy to sort theories into these categories. The\nsorting is complicated by the fact that whether a theory is moralized\nor norm-dependent is sometimes a matter of active controversy. (This\nis particularly true of Pettit\u2019s theory of domination.) In what\nfollows, theories will be sorted to reflect the intentions of the\ntheorist\u2014at least as far as these intentions can be\ndiscerned.\n\nOnce we recognize the distinction between moralization and\nnorm-dependency, we end up with four kinds of answer to the question\n\u201cWhat kind of power is domination?\u201d Assuming for now that\nonly agents (represented here by A and B) can dominate\nor be dominated:\n\n\n\nNorm-Independent\nNorm-Dependent\n\nNon-Moralized\nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises\nuncontrolled power over what B is in a position to do. \nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises\nsociologically legitimate power over what B is in a position to\ndo.  \n\nMoralized\nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises power\nover what B is in a position to do by violating\nB\u2019s rights or undermining B\u2019s interests with\nimpunity. \nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises power over\nwhat B is in a position to do that is both sociologically\nlegitimate and unconstrained by institutions designed to protect\nB\u2019s rights and interests. \n\n\nThis section will examine theories from each division, with their\nbasic motivations and primary exemplars. \n4.1 Non-Moralized, Norm-Independent Theories\n\nTheories identifying domination with even unexercised power tend away\nfrom moralization and norm-dependence. If A has a great deal of\npower over B, A will be well positioned to wrong\nB, or to force B at least to act like A has\nauthority. Non-moralized/norm-independent theories maintain that this\nis not essential to domination. What is essential? Roughly, that\nA has an unchecked or uncontrolled power to impose their will\non B, to shape the framework of choices available to B\nso that B is highly likely to cooperate with A. The\ndisagreements among non-moralized/norm-independent theorists are about\nthe kind of checks or control that might prevent domination, and about\nhow imposition works.\n\nMost non-moralized/norm-independent theories follow in the wake of\nneorepublicanism, and share its basic approach\u2014theorizing\ndomination in two movements: identifying a kind of power manifest in\ndomination but also in non-dominating social relationships; then\nidentifying the feature of domination that separates it from the power\nmanifest in those non-dominating relationships. Usually, the second\nmovement describes the controls or checks present in non-dominating\nsocial relationships and absent from the dominating ones. These two\nmotives will be treated in order below:\n\nFirst, what kind of social power is of interest to a theory of\ndomination? Neorepublicans like Pettit focus on the capacity to\ninterfere with an individual\u2019s choices, by replacing, removing,\nand/or misrepresenting these choices. A can interfere with\nB\u2019s choices by removing potential objects of\nchoice: suppose A runs over B\u2019s bicycle,\ndestroying it. This removes the option of riding B\u2019s\nbike. Suppose instead A knifes the tire: this replaces\nB\u2019s option of riding their bike with another option:\nriding the bike after the tire is replaced or repaired.\nRemoval and replacement are both objective\nforms of choice interference: mind-independent alternatives been\nremoved or replaced. Misrepresentation of options is\ncognitive: e.g., A lies to B and says that only\nidiots have bikes like B\u2019s. If B is credulous and\nrefuses to ride their bike from embarrassment, A manages in\nthis way to interfere with B by misrepresentation (see Pettit\n2012).\n\nThis general emphasis on choice is what provokes the\nover-generalization worries already introduced (Shapiro 2012; Friedman\n2008; Blunt 2015; McCammon 2015). Some choices clearly have more\nweight than others. Nobody thinks having no choice about where to sit\nin a caf\u00e9 matters compared to having no choice about where to\nlive. Connecting the former as well as the latter to dominating\nvarieties of choice-interference, because both might represent, e.g.,\nthe removal or replacement of an option, seems to exaggerate the idea\nof domination. If, however, we want to keep domination and the\nreduction of freedom conceptually connected, there is reason to see\ndomination in all power to interfere, at least when that power is\noutside the control of the interferee.\n\nWhile Pettit analyzes domination in terms of choice-interference, his\nfavorite heuristic focuses directly on dominated agents, and the way\nthey are social related to their dominators. To be dominated, for\nPettit, is to fail \u201cthe eyeball test\u201d: i.e., you cannot\n\u201clook others in the eye without reason for the fear or deference\nthat a power of interference might inspire\u201d (2012: 84). Other\ntheories share this emphasis on domination as a kind of power within a\nsocial relationship and tend to prefer it to talk of\nchoice-interference (Lovett 2010; McCammon 2015).\n\nWhat is a social relationship? A\u2019s social relatedness to\nB, first of all, seems to require strategic relatedness, in the\nsense that what B is likely to do is a function, at least in\npart, of what A does. To get from social relatedness to\ndomination has other requirements. It is difficult to see how A\ncould dominate B unless A has more power over B\nthan B has over A within their social relationship.\nFurther, for A to have power over B plausibly requires\nthat B cannot easily exit the relationship. If someone can\neasily get a new job just as good as the one they have already, their\n\u201cexit costs\u201d are low, and they will have a correspondingly\nlow dependence on the social relationship\u2014probably too low for\ndomination to occur (Lovett 2010). It may be that A\u2019s\npower over B, and B\u2019s exit costs from their social\nrelationship, are not really separate conditions, that\nA\u2019s power over B is a function of A\u2019s\ncontrol of resources B cannot access except through A\n(see Pansardi 2013).\n\nA capacity for choice-interference, or social relatedness however\nrendered, is necessary but not sufficient for domination on a\nnon-moralized/norm-independent theory. To get domination, something\nmore is required than mere choice-interference or power within a\nsocial relationship.\n\nNeorepublicans first referred to this \u201csomething more\u201d as\nthe arbitrariness of dominating power, and still do with some\nregularity, but Pettit himself now favors the language of control or\nthe absence of control (2012: 57\u201358). This move was an attempt\nto emphasize the non-moralized nature of his theory. (For criticism\nconnected to this shift in Pettit\u2019s presentation, see especially\nChristman 1998, Costa 2007, and McMahon 2005.) The terminological\nshift was probably wise, given the natural tendency to contrast\narbitrary power with power backed by good reasons or power put to good\npurpose. Arbitrary power, for neorepublicans, has never been merely\nunreasoned power. Though Pettit earlier emphasized the connection\nbetween arbitrary power and power that fails to track the\n\u201cinterests\u201d of those subject to it, he measured interests\nnot by an independent notion of the objective good or objectively\nreasonable, but by appeal to what interests are \u201cavowed\u201d\nor \u201cavowal-ready\u201d (2006: 275\u2013276). The language of\ncontrol also has echoes in his earlier work. For example, in\nRepublicanism he says that an act is arbitrary \u201cby\nvirtue of the controls\u2014or more precisely the lack of\ncontrols\u2014under which it materializes\u201d (1997: 55). This\nshift toward domination as uncontrolled power follows Pettit\u2019s\nmore recent attempts to contrast domination with well-constructed\ndemocracy, but the opposition of democratically constrained power and\ndominating power reflects his earlier insistence that we cannot know\nwhen power is arbitrary except \u201cby recourse to public discussion\nin which people may speak for themselves and for the groups to which\nthey belong\u201d (1997: 56). Here, too, he connects his own theory\nto Iris Young\u2019s account of domination in Justice and the\nPolitics of Difference. Young says that domination is the\n\u201copposite\u201d of \u201cthorough social and political\ndemocracy\u201d and defines life within structures of domination as\nliving under others who \n\n\ncan determine without reciprocation the conditions of [the dominated\nperson\u2019s] actions, either directly or by virtue of the\nstructural consequences of their actions. (1990 [2011: 38])\n\n\nOf course, for a non-moralized theory, identifying domination as\nanti-democratic must involve a non-moralized account of democracy.\nThis is not necessarily a problem, given that we can describe\npolitical institutions as \u201cdemocratic\u201d in a merely\ndescriptive sense. (e.g., someone who says, \u201cThe expansion of\nthe franchise leads to a more democratic society\u201d might simply\nmean that a larger percentage of the population gets to vote and think\nthat is a terrible idea and a reason not to expand the franchise.)\nWhat is more difficult is showing how even broadly democratic states\nare non-dominating if we think the absence of domination involves\nliteral control of the state by those it governs. It is clear\nthat the vast majority of individual citizens do not control their\nstate in any meaningful way; given the enormity of contemporary\nstates, it is unclear how they could. We might say that they should\nrest content with a fair share of control, or with a fair chance at\ncontrol. But to say that we avoid domination when we have a fair share\nof control looks very much like a way of moralizing the theory, since\nfairness is clearly a moral notion. (Pettit\u2019s primary\nattempt to explain non-domination in terms of democratic political\narrangements can be found especially in the final three chapters of\nOn the People\u2019s Terms. For more interpretation and\ncriticism of Pettit\u2019s idea of control, see Arnold & Harris\n2017, Mayer 2015, Schink 2013, Sharon 2015, Simpson 2017, and Kolodny\nforthcoming.)\n\nFrank Lovett argues that avoiding domination does not require\ndemocracy, but instead subjecting the powerful to reliably enforced\nand widely known rules. Perhaps democracy does, in fact, most\neffectively reduce domination, but this should follow from substantive\nargument, not from the mere analysis of concepts (Lovett 2010). Also,\nthere is reason to think that subordinate groups are less dominated\nwhenever their overlords must abide by reliably enforced and widely\nknown rules, even when those rules do not express the will of the\nsubordinated in any way. Lovett uses the following case to make his\npoint:\n\n\nSuppose that for various historical, economic, and cultural reasons,\none group in some society manages to acquire a preponderance of social\npower, which it wields over the other groups in that society directly\nand without constraint, much to its own benefit. Since the subordinate\ngroups are in no position to challenge directly the preeminence of the\npowerful group, they instead demand only that the various rights and\nprivileges of the latter be written down, codified, and impartially\nenforced by independent judges. In time, let us suppose, the powerful\ngroup accedes to this demand, on the view that since the rules will be\ndesigned to benefit them, after all, there will be no significant cost\nin their doing so. (2012: 147)\n\n\nIf power is organized and systematized in law, it does sound odd to\ncall it arbitrary. After all, it may be entirely predictable\nin such circumstances. Lovett tacks closer to the commonsense idea\nthat what is arbitrary is unpredictable, unreasoned, and unfettered by\nrules. He even claims that \u201creal-world systems of\ndomination\u201d like Jim Crow and South African apartheid might\ncease to be dominating in possible worlds where they managed\n\u201cstrict adherence to explicit rules and procedures\u201d (2010:\n101). That such regimes would remain oppressive is obvious, but he\nbelieves this should be explained by the presence of other political\nevils than domination. Instead of a substantive account of\narbitrary power\u2014where power dominates when it isn\u2019t forced\nto track the will of those subject to it\u2014he recommends\nproceduralism: power dominates because it isn\u2019t\n\u201creliably constrained by effective rules, procedures, or goals\nthat are common knowledge to all persons or groups concerned\u201d\n(Lovett 2010: 96\u201397; 2012; for more treatment of the debate\nbetween Pettit and Lovett about the nature of arbitrary power, see the\nsection on\n \u201cWhat Counts as Arbitrary Power?\u201d\n in the entry on\n republicanism.)\n\nLovett\u2019s arguments for proceduralism have provoked several\nclarifications of what substantivism requires. Proceduralism\nhighlights what Gwilym David Blunt (2015) calls \u201csources\u201d of\ndomination that are personal as opposed to social,\nand \u201csites\u201d of domination that are interactional\nas opposed to systemic. Widely known and reliably enforced\nchecks on power, of the kind emphasized by proceduralism, really do\nreduce domination enabled by personal sources of power like\nA\u2019s possession of more guns or guile than B,\nespecially when this power is expressed in the interactions of\nA and B as individual agents. If A and B\nare neighbors, and A has a huge stockpile of weapons and\nB has none, it makes sense to think of B\u2019s\ncomplaint against A as a matter of their intense vulnerability\nto power constrained only by A\u2019s whims. Substantivism may\nbe better equipped to recognize domination in what Blunt calls social\n\u201csources\u201d and systemic \u201csites\u201d. In actual\nsystems of domination, A often has power over B not\nbecause A alone has more power (e.g., by having more guns of\ntheir own), but because A and B both live within a\nsystem intended to advantage A\u2019s group and disadvantage\nB\u2019s. Often, in such cases, A has power to adjust\nthe system, or access to such power, while B does not.\n\nThere is another way to account for proceduralism\u2019s insistence\nthat reliably enforced, common-knowledge rules reduce domination even\nwithout democratic constraints. When A alone decides whether\nand how to harass B, A\u2019s power to harass B\nis checked only by A\u2019s sense of what is best or what\nshould be done. Suppose A lives in a society that introduces a\nreliably enforced, common-knowledge rule that A can harass\nB only by putting B in the stocks but may not whip\nB. This changes the situation both for A and B.\nNow, A alone does not decide whether and how to harass\nB: now, A is not checked simply by what A thinks\nthey have reason to do. In this way, A\u2019s power is less\n\u201cdeliberatively isolated\u201d (McCammon 2015). If this is\nright, domination can be reduced even by non-democratic reforms.\nHowever, laws and other limits on individual power may be formed by\nwhole groups in a deliberatively isolated manner, as under Jim Crow\nand apartheid, if the members of A\u2019s group have input\ninto the rules, but the members of B\u2019s group do not.\nEmpowered groups often dictate the terms of their dealings with\nsubordinated groups based only on their own sense of how things should\nbe, and the deliberatively isolated power of groups may be\nstrengthened by measures that reduce the deliberative isolation of\nindividuals. \n4.2 Moralized, Norm-Independent Theories\n\nNorm-independent, moralized theories of domination are less\ninfluential than non-moralized varieties. Even so, their appeal is\neasy to see. There is straightforward reason to moralize domination:\ni.e., dominators use their power to do bad things. Slave masters rape\nand assault their slaves. Men within patriarchy rape and assault\nwomen. Domination allows evil deeds go unpunished. This impunity is\nperhaps what matters most to those who think of domination in a\nmoralized way. To be sure, not that every act of moral wrong manifests\ndomination. When a master tortures his slave, this is domination; but\nwhen a slave gets the drop on his master and tortures him it may not\nbe, even on the assumption that both cases of torture are wrong. Why?\nThe difference is in what the master will face as a consequence for\ntorturing the slave, as opposed to what the slave will face for\ntorturing the master. The master wrongs the slave with impunity; the\nslave wrongs the master only at grave risk from the enforcers of the\nsystem that enslaves him. To get domination instead of\nwrongdoing, it is necessary to include a requirement like\nthis: as a first pass, A dominates B just because\nA can wrong B in the context of an asymmetric power\nrelation favoring A. If A can wrong B with\nimpunity, and B knows this, A will be well-positioned to\nexercise control over B. B will know that refusal to\ncomply with A may result in violation of B\u2019s\nrights or interests.\n\nThe most common approaches to moralization without norm-dependence\ncouch domination in terms of violating \u201cbasic\u201d or\n\u201cbest\u201d interests. Allen (1999), Lukes (2005), and Wartenberg\n(1990) are primary advocates of a \u201cbasic\u201d interests\napproach. Kittay (1999: 34), Laborde (2013: 285), and Shapiro\n(2012: 310; 2016: 23) share an emphasis on \u201cbest\u201d\ninterests. Shapiro looks to local custom for guidance about the\nstandard for legitimate power, unless those customs dramatically\nundercut the interests of the less powerful. For example, he is happy\nto leave judgments of legitimate parental power to parents, except for\nthose who would deny their children education and healthcare. The\nbaseline is what is necessary to live as \u201ca normal adult\u201d\nin the context of contemporary democracies (2012: 294). Laborde\nmoralizes basic interests by appeal to what \u201cwe have reason to\nvalue\u201d (2013: 285), as opposed to what people might actually\nvalue. A non-moralized account of basic interests, of course, might\nconnect interests to what people actually value, regardless of what\nthey have reason to value. But this would leave us in the awkward\nposition of being unable to recognize domination in brainwashed slaves\nwho value their subordination. \n4.3 Non-Moralized, Norm-Dependent Theories\n\nWhen we take a hard look at the most obvious cases of\ndomination\u2014masters, tyrants, patriarchs\u2014we\u2019ll\nprobably notice that they all claim authority. The Paradigms all\ntypically think of themselves as the ones who make the rules, and that\ntheir subjects have an obligation to comply. To say that dominators,\nas such, always claim this kind of authority is to endorse a\nnorm-dependent theory: that A dominates B by virtue of\nhaving a kind of socially legitimate power over them. Not all social\npower operates in this way\u2014or doesn\u2019t seem to. The\nneighborhood mob boss who comes by your shop demanding protection\nmoney almost certainly does not expect you to think of his command,\n\u201cPay up or else!\u201d, as an expression of legitimate\nauthority backed by sanctions. Plausibly, the typical mob boss cares\nonly that you recognize him as a source of credible threats and\ncomply. According to most norm-dependent theories, this means that the\nmob boss does not dominate. Domination is always power \u201cunder\ncolor of right\u201d. The mob boss acts under no such colors. The\npatriarch, by contrast, believes that his commands create obligations\nfor those within his household; and this - not merely his power to\ninterfere with choice\u2014is why he dominates. Here, norm-dependent\ntheories part company from their norm-independent competitors: the\nlatter will tend to see both the mob boss and the patriarch as sources\nof domination.\n\nAs canvassed above, norm-dependence and moralization are separate\nissues. We don\u2019t need a theory of the right or the good to tell\nus whether someone has power legitimized by local social norms or\nlaws. Of course, we do need a moral theory to tell us if\nsocial norms or laws are right or just or truly legitimate. As we will\nsee in the next section, the most influential norm-dependent theories\nof domination tie it to a specific failure to respect the\nactual moral authority of the dominated, and so offer a\nmoralized as well as norm-dependent theory.\n\nWhy prefer norm-dependence to norm-independence? Often, the move to\nnorm-dependence is motivated by familiar worries about\nover-generalization. The world may be full of uncontrolled powers of\nchoice interference, but it is less common for one agent to regard\nsomeone else as a source of binding norms. I may have an uncontrolled\npower to interfere with your choices whenever I can take the last seat\nin a caf\u00e9 before you can get to it; this obviously has nothing\nto do with any kind of authority over you. The latter power seems less\nubiquitous and more serious.\n\nAlso, norm-dependent, non-moralized conceptions are perhaps best\nequipped to diagnose domination where the dominated have internalized\njustifications for their status. Neorepublicans often highlight how\nvictims of domination don\u2019t have enough power to contest their\nposition, but what about cases where victims of domination are\nunwilling to contest because they accept a worldview that\njustifies their domination? Michael Thompson calls such unwillingness\na manifestation of constitutive domination: the way \n\n\nnorms, institutions, and values of the community shape the rationality\nof subjects to accept forms of power and social relations and\ncollective goals as legitimate forms of authority. (2018: 44) \n\n\nIn so doing, he resists standard neorepublican talk of\n\u201carbitrary\u201d power. Domination is constitutive just because\nit is not regarded as arbitrary by those under its sway.\nInstead, he claims, domination is the expression of widely\nrationalized and internalized norms. Certainly, if we agree that all\npower necessarily involves legitimacy claims (see Azmanova 2012:\n49\u201350), it makes sense to think that intense varieties of social\npower, like domination, will go hand-in-hand with thoroughgoing\nacceptance of legitimacy claims.\n\nAccording to Marxist and Marxist-inflected theories like\nThompson\u2019s, neorepublicans are misled by their paradigms.\nNeorepublicans get their touchstones of domination from slavery and\ntraditional despotism\u2014varieties supposedly more prevalent in\npre-modern societies, where the threat of violence was the primary\ncurrency of domination. Instead, according to Marxist theories, we\nshould see domination in the ideologies that make violence and\ncoercion less necessary: for example, when the redistribution of pubic\ngoods to private elites is widely accepted as natural or as the result\nof free exchange, even by many who suffer as a result.\n\nThe internalization by the dominated of norms supposedly\nlegitimizing their domination is not the only way to connect\ndomination to internalized norms. Christopher Lebron points to another\npossibility: perhaps what is necessary isn\u2019t that the dominated\naccept a rationalization of their condition, but that the\ndominators do so. The difference between domination and more\nbenign hierarchies, he claims, is that dominators control\n\u201clegitimizing myths\u201d that hide their domination. The\nsimple fact that a worker has a boss does not indicate domination; it\nmay instead indicate only a mutually beneficial arrangement (Lebron\n2013: 56). A boss comes to dominate by accepting and promoting myths\nthat justify their ascendance. What matters, on this account, is that\nthe dominating group imbibe such myths, that their\nconsciousness is shaped, e.g., so that their power is mistaken for a\nfeature of nature, or a result of their innate merits or just deserts,\nnot that the dominated manifest a consciousness so altered. \n\nThe norm-dependent theories encountered so far look to institutions\nand systems to embody and promote social norms. Regardless of whether\ninstitutions and systems themselves dominate, standard\nnorm-dependent theories tend to see the existence of institutions as a\nnecessary condition for domination through norms: e.g., the\npatriarch\u2019s power to project authority in his family depends on\nwidely accepted attitudes about the place of fathers in the\ninstitution of the family; the slave master\u2019s power to project\nauthority to his slaves depends on an economic and political system\npermitting property in human lives. Gwilym David Blunt\u2019s theory stands\napart by being norm-dependent without requiring background\ninstitutions. According to Blunt, even the mob boss has power over\nnorms: in the language introduced above, this is an\ninteractional site of domination drawn from a\npersonal source: i.e., power between agents drawn from the\nmob boss\u2019 personal control of guns and muscle. Unlike\nnorm-independent theorists such as Lovett, Blunt claims that\nall social relationships involve norms. Insofar as the mob\nboss and the shop owner are socially related, this involves more than\nnon-normative elements like strategic relatedness or exit costs. The\nasymmetry of power that matters is an asymmetry in the power to define\nthe status of other parties in a social relationship. The mob boss has\npower enough to assign the shop owner an inferior place in their\nsocial relationships, and set up himself as the one who makes the\nrules in the relationship. In this way, Blunt believes he can preserve\nthe standard neorepublican intuition that powerful agents like the mob\nboss can be dominators within a norm-dependent framework.\n4.4 Moralized, Norm-Dependent Theories\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like we must appeal to moral concepts to say\nwhether a powerful person can or cannot dictate social norms; but, for\nan influential cluster of theories, the norm-dependence of domination\nis constructed in specifically moral terms. This is an understandable\nmove. After all, if we think domination is always expressed through\nnorms, and we think that domination is morally illegitimate\neven when socially legitimate, it makes sense to think of domination\nas a specific failure to reckon with morally legitimate\nnorms. For theories of domination that are moralized as well as\nnorm-dependent, we diagnose domination not just as power expressed\nthrough authority claims, but as a specific kind of morally\nillegitimate authority. \n\nGiven that the most influential moralized/norm-dependent\ntheories\u2014Henry Richardson\u2019s and Rainer\nForst\u2019s\u2014developed either within or in direct response to\nneorepublicanism, it is not surprising to find here a similar\ntwo-movement approach to domination; first giving an account of power\nmanifest in domination but also in benign forms of power, and second,\ngiving an account of what makes domination distinct and unjust. For\nRichardson, the broader category of benign or even legitimate power is\nthe power to \u201cmodify the rights and duties of others\u201d\n(2002: 34). An agent may have this power without dominating anyone;\ndominators exercise an unauthorized variety of this \u201cnormative\npower\u201d. Richardson here is motivated again by the desire to\nsteer around what he thinks are neorepublican false positives:\ncriminals like the mob boss do not, he claims, dominate. If an\nuncontrolled capacity to interfere with choice dominates, we are\ndominated by the mere possibility that our neighbors will slash our\ntires in the night. Secret tire-slashing may be arbitrary\nchoice-interference, but it serves no obvious role in wielding\nnormative power.\n\nForst favors the language of reasons in identifying the\nbroader category of power of which domination is a subset. All social\npower, he says, is power \u201cwithin the space of\nreasons\u201d\u2014specifically justifying reasons. This is\nwhy he calls his account of power noumenal: power is not\nbased merely on the control of material resources, but instead on\ninfluence over what other agents see as justified thought or action.\nThat you have a lot of some material resource\u2014say,\nmoney\u2014is irrelevant from the perspective of power unless you can\nuse it to alter what others think they have most reason to do. In\ngeneral, Forst says, power is \u201cthe capacity of A to\nmotivate B to think or do something that B would\notherwise not have thought or done\u201d (2015: 115). It is clear\nenough that such power has innocent varieties: when a teacher shows a\nstudent a new way to solve a math problem, they motivate them to think\nand do in ways they would not otherwise. Gentle persuasion between\nfriends manifests the same power.\n\nSo, both Richardson and Forst try to situate domination within a\nbroader, essentially normative phenomenon, the power to place others\nunder [supposed] duties or the power to affect what others regard as\njustified. What, then, makes domination distinct and unjust? For both\nRichardson and Forst, domination involves a violation of our rights\nrelative to the normative domain. Dominators claim authority or power\nwithin the space of reasons that properly belongs to the dominated.\nDomination is power unbound by the moral standing of its victims as\nco-authors of the norms that bind them. For Richardson, who focuses\nspecifically on power in the political context, the arbitrariness of\nnormative power manifests itself along several moralized dimensions:\ndominating power fails to express \u201cfair\u201d deliberative\nprocesses among \u201cfree and equal citizens\u201d that respect\n\u201cfundamental rights and liberties\u201d (2002: 52). The slave\nmaster dominates because he takes for himself a power that belongs\nproperly to his slaves: we have a moral right to decide together what\nour political rights and duties will be. He is able to do this because\nhis role as a master of slaves has institutional support. If one of\nhis slaves runs away, he can call on the state to track the slave down\nand return them. This is how real dominators are distinct from deluded\nclaimants to normative power. Imagine a mob boss who comes to believe\nthat he speaks for God. He might believe that he has a power to create\nrights and duties; even so, without social and legal backing analogous\nto what a tyrant or slave master or patriarch can depend on, the mob\nboss will not succeed even in creating illegitimate rights and\nduties\u2014and so will fail to dominate on a theory like\nRichardson\u2019s. \n\nSimilarly, Forst measures dominating power against an explicitly\nmoralized baseline\u2014power dominates to the extent that it is\nexercised outside a structure of democratic institutions designed to\nsecure and respect the equal authority of each citizen to offer and\nreceive adequate justifications (Forst 2013). Noumenal power within\nsocial relationships becomes domination when agents within that\nrelationship are denied their right to justification: i.e., their\nright to participate as free equals in the space of reasons (2015:\n116\u2013117). Interestingly, Forst\u2019s theory, like\nBlunt\u2019s non-moralized theory and unlike Richardson\u2019s,\napparently allows for domination outside official structures of\nauthority. Dominators, Forst says, \u201cseal off\u201d the space of\nreasons by denying our right to receive and offer adequate\njustifications, but there are many ways to do this. One way is simply\nthrough the threat of violence. If a mob boss has all the guns and\nmuscle, he will be able to crowd the shop owner completely out of the\njustificatory space. What the shop owner might believe about what they\nhave reason to think and do is irrelevant, given the price they will\npay for non-compliance.\n\nAgain, if we understand the power required for domination as a kind of\nauthority, it makes sense to diagnose the presence or absence of\ndomination in terms of illicit authority. When illicit\nnormative authority counts as such because it is claimed by a powerful\nfew, we are pushed firmly in the direction of a reckoning with the\nnormative authority of all. Of course, once this reckoning has begun,\nit is natural to diagnose domination in broadly Kantian terms as the\nabsence of institutions securing respect for our autonomy. (See Bohman\n2004 for a similar approach applied to international relations.)\n\nNorm-dependent or moralized theories identify domination with some\nvarieties of unrestrained asymmetric power and not others, whether it\nbe power to dictate the norms of a social relationship, to establish\nlegitimizing narratives, to alter the shape of our supposed rights and\nduties, to close us off from the space of reasons, to violate our\nbasic interests, or to do us wrong. This makes them more vulnerable to\nthe possibility that domination can take some form not captured by any\nof these specific powers. Lovett\u2014an advocate of a non-moralized,\nnorm-independent theory\u2014worries that moralized or norm-dependent\ntheories tend toward a kind of historical or cultural myopia, seeing\ndomination only in whatever \u201cforms of social power happen to be\nthe predominant instruments of domination\u201d here and now or in\ntime gone by (2010: 92). He recommends we see some of the powers\nhighlighted by moralized or norm-dependent theories as varieties of\ndomination, but remain alert to other forms it might assume. Of\ncourse, devotees of moralization or norm-dependency may respond that\nthe leading non-moralized/norm-independent contenders see domination\nwhere there is none, fail to see its specific threat, or cry\n\u201cdomination\u201d where some other social evil is really the\nproblem.\n5. Domination and Applied Ethics\n\nBecause power asymmetries persist in other contexts outside the\ntraditionally political, the idea of domination has been marshaled\nbeyond political philosophy in applied ethics. Anti-domination\napproaches have an ecumenical appeal. Few deny that the paradigms are\nexamples of injustice; thus, to show that some power structure or use\nof power resembles these paradigms goes a long way toward motivating a\nverdict against them. Awareness of domination also draws our attention\nto the ways moral wrong can be manifest outside the limits of\nindividual actions. Aside from questions about which individual\nactions are wrong, other questions become important. Who is empowered\nto act in what ways? How are potential victims empowered to resist?\nWho is vulnerable even if not actually victimized? However benevolent,\nwho makes the rules? Who obeys or refuses to obey, and what does their\ncompliance (or refusal) cost them? How do the actions of those with\nmore power construct the space where the less powerful or the\npowerless must act? \n\nMedical care (or the failure to provide it) is rife with potential for\ndomination. The sick are vulnerable to those who control what they\nneed to get well (O\u2019Shea 2017, 2018). The disabled choose and\nact in a world constructed almost entirely for the benefit of and\ncontrolled by others (De Wispelaere & Casassas 2014). Workers\noften have little say in the conditions or culture of their workplaces\n(Gourevitch 2011; Breen 2015; Anderson 2017). Migrant and immigrant\npopulations usually exist in political limbo where they are deeply\nvulnerable to exploitation and have no legal standing to contest their\ntreatment (Honohan 2014; Costa 2016; Sager 2017). The consumption\nhabits of wealthy nations shape a global environment in which all\nhumans now and for the foreseeable future will make their choices\n(Bohman 2011; Nolt 2011; Smith 2012; Smith 2013; Katz 2017).\n\nMost deployment of anti-domination arguments applies neorepublican\ntheories of domination, but there are important exceptions. In\naddition to the departures from neorepublican accounts noted above in\nFriedman\u2019s and Kittay\u2019s work on caregivers and families,\nother attempts to use domination beyond the traditionally political\nhave yielded revisionary results. For example, Tom O\u2019Shea\nworries that the standard neorepublican focus on choice interference,\nand the worsening of an agent\u2019s choice situation, leaves us\nill-equipped to see the possibility for \u201cassistive arbitrary\npower\u201d in medical care. In these cases, the sick may be\nvulnerable to domination not because someone acts intentionally to\ninterfere with their choices\u2014e.g., by raising the price of a\ndrug beyond what they can afford\u2014but by failing to provide a\nbenefit, as when no one will provide transportation to someone with\nimpaired mobility. In a more dramatic departure, Corey Katz argues\nthat the tendency of mainstream neorepublicanism to ground domination\nin social relatedness and the possibility for choice interference\nmakes it unfit to diagnose the domination of those yet to be born\n(2017). If we want to think of intergenerational injustice as a\nvariety of domination, Katz insists, we must shift to an outcome-based\nconception that focuses on unjust harm done to future generations, who\nare unable to resist that harm.\n6. Conclusion\n\nNothing is less surprising than persistent disagreement in philosophy,\nbut the persistence of disagreement about domination is connected to\nan interesting question about where the discussion should go from\nhere: What do we want a theory of domination to do? Is our theory of\ndomination supposed to tell us when people are free and when they are\nnot? Do we want our theory of domination to give us insight into the\nnature of social injustice? To diagnose political misrule? To motivate\na theory of democracy? To describe the underclass in late capitalist\nsocieties? To capture the complaint of racial minorities in oppressive\nracialized hierarchies? All of the above? All theories of domination\nare not equally suited to each of these tasks; as a consequence, the\nappeal of individual theories may differ according to which we find\nmost pressing.\n\nA related question, at present under-explored in the literature, is\nhow domination does or does not relate to other concepts often used to\ndescribe power-related injustices: for example, exploitation,\noppression, and subjugation. Young (1990 [2011])\ndistinguishes between domination and oppression, identifying the\nformer with asymmetric power over action and the contexts of action,\nand the latter with the more diffuse and sometimes unconscious shaping\nof institutions in ways that deny some social groups the capacity to\nunderstand and express themselves except from the perspective of the\nprivileged. Unfortunately, few have followed her in working out a\nsimilar division of labor between these concepts. (For an interesting\nexceptions, see Bellamy 2007: 151\u2013152.) More common is the\nneorepublican assumption that concern for injustices like oppression\ncan be folded into concern for domination (Pettit 1997: 80). Just as\nall theories of domination are not equally suited to every task we\nmight put them to, it may be that attention to domination itself\nshould be supplemented by attention to other varieties of injustice.\nIf nothing else, recent work on domination has dramatically sharpened\nour understanding of such injustice, even if all its varieties cannot\nusefully be diagnosed as manifestations of this single ill.\n",
