    "main_text": "Commentaries on Plato\n2. Commentaries on Plato\n\n\nOlympiodorus begins his commentary on Plato\u2019s Alcibiades with\na grand gesture: \u201cAristotle began his own Theology with the\nwords: \u2018All men by nature desire to know, and evidence for this\nis our love of perception\u2019. But as I begin to speak about\nPlato\u2019s philosophy, I would say this, which is better, that all men\nhave a desire for Plato\u2019s philosophy, because all men want to draw\nsomething useful from it; they hurry to be spell-bound by its fountain\nand stand still only when they are full of Platonic enthusiasm.\u201d\nOlympiodorus is working hard to galvanize his audience with his own\npassion for Plato; but it is characteristic of his entire work that he\nholds out for them, in the first place, that something useful is to be\ngained from the study of Plato.\n\n\nUseful in what sense? As if piecing together a Byzantine mosaic,\nOlympiodorus hands his students the shards and tesserae that could\namount, in the appropriate number and arrangement, to classical\npaideia. His commentaries on Plato abound with references to\nHomer, Demosthenes, the 2nd-century C.E. orator Aelius\nAristides, Plutarch, Epictetus and Aristotle as well as works of Plato\nother than the one being commented on, notably the Republic,\neven if his students had not read it yet. One gets the impression that\nOlympiodorus gently but firmly directs his pupils\u2019 attention to an\nintellectual world waiting for them to discover it \u2014 if they\nwant to. We are entering a period in late antiquity in which Plato and\nAristotle cease to be gateways to the \u2018truth\u2019 and turn\ninto some kind of cultural heritage that was worth keeping alive for\nother reasons. Olympiodorus has rightly been called \u201cthe first\nclassicist\u201d (Tarrant 1997).\n\n\nThis effort to stem the tide of cultural pauperization was carefully\npackaged and structured, without depriving the lecturer of the\nnecessary amount of flexibility: each class (praxis) was\ndivided into three sections. The reading of the original Platonic (or\nAristotelian) text was followed by an \u2018overview\u2019 over the\npassage (the\u00f4ria), which in turn segued into a closer\nreading (lexis). The overview allowed the professor to make\nall kinds of general remarks on the significance and meaning of the\npassage under discussion; the close reading presented more detailed\nand often simply philological, linguistic, logical, or rhetorical\nobservations not unlike those found in our modern annotated editions.\nThe procedure of dividing one\u2019s comments into these two different\nsections seems to be a formalized development of Proclus\u2019 work (see\nBeutler 1949, 226).\n\n\nFalsehood or truth in philosophical matters (somewhat abstractly\nenshrined for Olympiodorus in \u2018common notions\u2019 [koinai\nennoiai]) is not something he much talks about. The reason may\nnot have been that he harbored no such convictions, but that they\nwould have been inappropriate or unwanted in the classroom. Very\noften, what has proved most interesting to modern scholars for\nhistorical reasons are remarks made entirely in passing, for example\nthe puzzling statement that some of the endowment of the Academy in\nAthens was still intact in his time (in Alc. \u00a7141.1f.);\nthat the Alexandrian rhetor Anatolius adapted a line of Homer to great\neffect in the year 546 (in Alc. \u00a72.79\u201382); or that\nsuicide is forbidden because, according to the Orphic tradition,\n\u201chuman bodies belong to Dionysus\u201d (in Phaed.\n\u00a71.3).\n\n\nOccasionally, we encounter an anecdote about Ammonius, whom\nOlympiodorus clearly revered and whom he invokes frequently to inflate\nhis own authority. One such anecdote is suggestive of a tension\nbetween imperial rule and the political views of the\nphilosophers. Near the end of the Gorgias commentary\n(\u00a742), Olympiodorus endorses the view that aristocracy is the\nbest form of government and far superior to democracy, and he\njustifies this by claiming that the city, just like the human being,\nis a microcosm that should resemble the macrocosm\n\u2018universe\u2019. But this argument seems to favor monarchy; for\njust as the universe is ruled by one, i.e., God, there \u201cshould\nnot be a number of ordinary people who rule, but one prudent and true\nstatesman.\u201d Olympiodorus continues: \u201cNow, if somebody says\n\u2018But this is monarchy, not aristocracy, and that is not the same\nthing\u2019, reply as the philosopher Ammonius replied: \u2018Give\nhim the knuckles and praise him. For it is the same, \u2026 even if\nthere are many exceedingly good people, they form a living unit, for\nthey have everything in common.\u2019\u201d (\u00a742.2)\n\n\nOne question to ask is how the opposed positions of teacher and\nstudent, paganism and Christianity, ancient and \u2018modern\u2019\nplayed out in Olympiodorus\u2019 classroom? Here are some illustrative\nexamples. The Delphic oracle still seemed to enjoy an awe-inspiring\nreputation, but the names of Greek gods in Plato\u2019s text, especially\nZeus, are often omitted and/or replaced by the word \u2018God\u2019.\nOlympiodorus has trouble showing his students ways in which to make\nsense of pagan divinities in their effort to adapt pagan philosophy to\nthe Christian context: \u201cDo not be disturbed by names when you\nhear talk of a \u2018Power of Cronus\u2019 or a \u2018Power of\nZeus\u2019 or suchlike, but concentrate on the objects themselves,\nfor we signify something different when we use these names. If you\nwish, think that these powers do not have individual essences and are\nnot distinct from one another, but place them within the first cause\nand say that there are within it both intellectual and vital\npowers\u201d (in Gorg. \u00a747.2).\n\n\nAt times the underlying tensions rise to the surface, but Olympiodorus\nwas expertly evasive of trouble from the audience. In his\n44th lecture on the Gorgias, for instance, he\nreassures his students that pagan myths ought not to be taken\nliterally; one ought to understand that names such as Zeus and Hera\nand Hades were merely part of the language in which \u2018they\u2019\n(i.e., the ancient Greeks) talked. Puzzled by the vertiginous and\nconflicting possibilities of allegorical\ninterpretations of myth, once they are not taken literally, one\nobstinate student must have intervened, for Olympiodorus makes the\nfollowing evasive remark (\u00a744.7): \u201cIf someone says\n\u2018Then neither ought we put trust in philosophers, since they are\nin disagreement, some saying the soul is water, others that it is air,\nsome that it is mortal, others that it is immortal\u2019, we reply\nthat in this case we put our trust in those who stay closer to the\ncommon notions. But [in myths] there are no common notions to guide\nour education. Hence we should first explicate the myths \u2014 for\nindeed Plato explicates them. So he said earlier \u2026\u201d.\n\n\nEven if some students were repelled by the general world-view of\npaganism, it is clear that many of them were fascinated by its more\nsinister aspects. At one point in the Gorgias (513a),\nSocrates mentions in passing certain Thessalian witches who pull down\nthe moon and cause an eclipse. In Lecture 39 on the Gorgias,\nOlympiodorus explains the story behind these witches in a few broad\nstrokes, apparently to his own satisfaction. But witchcraft was just\nthe thing students wanted to hear a bit more about from the pagan\nphilosopher, so Lecture 40 begins like this: \u201cSince last time I\nreferred to the Thessalian women, it is worth explaining the practice,\nwhy people think wizards draw down the moon [at an eclipse], and why\nordinary people beat on bronze. Note that an eclipse is nothing other\nthan the privation of light. During this privation in particular,\nwhile it is dark, certain infernal demons wander around, since the\nworld is without light. Then unholy and God-hating wizards cast spells\nto attract these demons. Hence the multitude believes that they draw\ndown the moon. And since at such time demons are among us, people beat\non bronze, thereby casting off and driving the demonic interference\naway.  I have dealt with these things because you are not without\nideas about these customs. Now let me come to the present\ntopic.\u201d Philosophically, all this is of no interest at all, but\nlooking at it from a cultural point of view one gets a fascinating\nwhiff of the bewildering concerns of students reading Plato in the\nsixth century.\n\n\nBeing a pagan philosopher on the municipal payroll of the City of\nAlexandria\u2014or worse, being dependent on voluntary student\nfees\u2014must have been no enviable position. One can imagine that\nthe act of playing the token philosopher in Alexandria and lecturing\nfor decades on important matters which no-one in the audience any more\nreally cared about took its toll. The Greek\nAnthology attributes to Olympiodorus an at the same time artful\nand depressing epigram (Anth. Gr., Appendix 177):\n\n Had the writing of Plato not checked my impulse,\n I would have loosened by now the grievous, baneful bond of\nlife.\n \n",
