    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Anarchism is Utopian\n4.3 Anarchism is Utopian\n\nObjection: This objection holds that there simply is\nno way to destroy or deconstruct the state. So exercises in anarchist\npolitical theory are fruitless. It would be better, from this point of\nview to focus on critiques of hierarchy, inequality, and threats to\nliberty from within liberal or libertarian political theory\u2014and\nto engage in reforms that occur within the status quo and mainstream\npolitical organization.\n\nReply: Ideal theory is always in opposition to\nnon-ideal theory. But utopian speculation can be useful for clarifying\nvalues. Thus philosophical anarchism may be a useful exercise that\nhelps us understand our values and commitment, even though political\nanarchism has no hope of succeeding. Furthermore, there are examples\nof successful anarchist communities on a small local scale (for\nexample, in the separatist communities discussed above). These\nconcrete examples can be viewed as experiments in anarchist theory and\npractice.\n",
