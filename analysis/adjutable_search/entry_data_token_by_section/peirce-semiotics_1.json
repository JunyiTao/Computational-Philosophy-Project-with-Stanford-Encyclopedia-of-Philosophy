    "main_text": "Basic Sign Structure || The Signifying Element of Signs\n1.1 The Signifying Element of Signs\n\nThe very first thing to note is that there are some potential\nterminological difficulties here. We appear to be saying that there\nare three elements of a sign, one of which is the sign. This is\nconfusing and does not fully capture Peirce\u2019s idea. Strictly speaking,\nfor Peirce, we are interested in the signifying element, and\nit is not the sign as a whole that signifies. In speaking of the sign\nas the signifying element, then, he is more properly speaking of the\nsign refined to those elements most crucial to its functioning as a\nsignifier. Peirce uses numerous terms for the signifying element\nincluding \u201csign\u201d, \u201crepresentamen\u201d,\n\u201crepresentation\u201d, and \u201cground\u201d. Here we shall\nrefer to that element of the sign responsible for signification as the\n\u201csign-vehicle\u201d.\n\nPeirce\u2019s idea that a sign does not signify in all respects and has\nsome particular signifying element is perhaps best made clear with an\nexample. Consider, for instance, a molehill in my lawn taken as a sign\nof moles. Not every characteristic of the molehill plays a part in\nsignifying the presence of moles. The color of the molehill plays a\nsecondary role since it will vary according to the soil from which it\nis composed. Similarly, the sizes of molehills vary according to the\nsize of the mole that makes them, so again, this feature is not\nprimary in the molehill\u2019s ability to signify. What is central here is\nthe causal connection that exists between the type of mound in my lawn\nand moles: since moles make molehills, molehills signify moles.\nConsequently, primary to the molehill\u2019s ability to signify the mole is\nthe brute physical connection between it and a mole. This is the\nsign-vehicle of the sign. For Peirce, then, it is only some element of\na sign that enables it to signify its object, and when speaking of the\nsignifying element of the sign, or rather, the sign-vehicle, it is\nthis qualified sign that he means.\n",
