    "main_text": "Explanatory Approaches to Development\n3. Explanatory Approaches to Development\n\nExplanations in developmental biology are usually causal, though\nunlike standard mechanistic explanation there is a constant\nacquisition of new causal capacities (in terms of constituent\nentities, activities, and their organization) through development\n(McManus 2012; Parkkinen 2014). Although much work remains in\ncharacterizing different aspects of explanation in developmental\nbiology, there is no doubt that a difference making or manipulability\nconception of causation (see the entry on\n causation and manipulability)\n provides a core element of the reasoning (Woodward 2003; Strevens\n2009; Waters 2007a). Genetic explanations of development\n (Section 3.1),\n similar to what is seen in\n molecular genetics,\n work by identifying changes in the expression of genes and\ninteractions among their RNA and protein products that lead to changes\nin the properties of morphological features during ontogeny (e.g.,\nshape or size), while holding a variety of contextual variables fixed.\nMore recently, there has been growing interest in physical\nexplanations of development\n (Section 3.2)\n that involve appeals to mechanical forces due to geometrical\narrangements of mesoscale materials, such as fluid flow (Forgacs and\nNewman 2005). Researchers agree on the phenomena that need to be\nexplained\n (Section 1.2\n and\n Section 2.2),\n but differ on whether physical rules or genetic factors are more or\nless explanatory (Keller\n 2002).[8]\n The existence of two different types of causal explanations for\ndevelopmental phenomena poses an additional question about how they\nmight be combined into a more integrated explanatory framework\n (Section 3.3).\n",
