Quantum Probabilities\nProbabilities in the histories interpretation of quantum mechanics\nare standard Kolmogorov probabilities, not some new\ninvention that, for example, allows negative probabilities. But these\nstandard probabilities must be associated with a well-defined sample\nspace. While this is also true in classical applications of\nprobability theory, in quantum mechanics the penalty for carelessness\ncan be severe: confusion and unresolved paradoxes. The following\ndiscussion indicates what steps need to be taken to construct\nconsistent probabilities and stay out of trouble. For more details see\nCh. 5 of Griffiths (2002a).\n",
