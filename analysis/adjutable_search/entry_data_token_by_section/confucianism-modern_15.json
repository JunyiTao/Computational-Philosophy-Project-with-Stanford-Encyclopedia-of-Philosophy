    "main_text": "Political Thought || Political Equality from Equal Subjectivity\n5.2 Political Equality from Equal Subjectivity\n\nTang\u2019s arguments for democracy proceed along similar lines,\nbasing democracy on the equality of persons and the need for objective\ninstitutions. However, he employs his characteristic focus on\naffective connection and recognizing the subjectivity of other people\nto support democracy. It is critical for Tang that democracy is not\njust a modus vivendi that simply recognizes practically that\npeople won\u2019t accept giving up their rights. It must be based on\nequality of personality, exactly what Chinese culture puts at the\nfoundation (TJCW 9: 325). The basis of this is the universal moral\nheart-mind:\n\n\nWe say that the infinite value of the individual and highest dignity\nof the person are founded on possession of the heart-mind of moral\nreason. (TJCW 11: 195)\n\n\nAs covered previously, Tang thinks this heart-mind (he also calls it\nthe humane heart-mind) is minimally a presupposition of most activity\nin life. It is something we feel in ourselves and believe it is a\nuniversal characteristic of humanity.\n\nOne of Tang\u2019s innovations is to illustrate how political\nactivity is itself a way of experiencing affective connection with\nothers. Tang starts with the bare desire for power, something humans\nshare with animals. The difference is that people are necessarily\nself-aware, and so someone desiring power knows they cannot pursue it\nblindly without it being self-defeating. They will have to regulate\nthis desire and consider how to realize it most effectively, and when\nthey do so, they already begin to transcend the desire for power\nitself (TJCW 12: 123). The desire for power is a desire for other\npeople to submit to me and follow my will, and that itself recognizes\nthat other people have a will of their own (TJCW 12: 125). We do not\nseek submission from things, but simply use them. Going further, the\nway to get people to submit is provide something they value (such as\ntheir continued life). Then satisfying my desire for power depends on\nbeing able to provide something that other people value, and I tacitly\nrecognize that they have their own values, which I must understand.\nThrough this process, recognizing that others have values and seeking\nto persuade them to submit, the selfish heart-mind can transform into\na public-spirited heart-mind, though Tang admits this won\u2019t\nnecessarily happen (TJCW 12: 132\u201335; Fr\u00f6hlich 2017:\n168\u201375). Still, even here affective connection has been\nestablished. Tang wants to show that even the bare desire of power\nmust recognize the existence of other minds with wills and values of\ntheir own.\n\nThe route to democracy is based on recognition of others\u2019 minds\nand applying moral reason which demands universality. As I wish for my\nown rights and the ability to participate in government, rational\nconsistency requires that I respect others\u2019 rights and desire to\nparticipate in government. I must begin to see my own political\nactivity as something that could be approved by others. \u201cThen on\nthe basis of reason, we set up a form of participating in government\nthat is publicly accepted and universally approved\u201d. This is\ndemocracy (TJCW 11: 187). In contrast to Hobbes, Tang holds the belief\nthat people are not absolutely selfish, though of course they act\nselfishly at times. The state is not formed by a social contract among\nindividuals. Communities are an inherent part of human life even\nbefore there were states. (TJCW 12: 169\u201374). Communities are\nrequired by universal reason. Democracy is of course not perfect, but\nrealizes the requirements of reason better than alternative forms of\ngovernment. The flaws of democracy cannot be rectified by laws alone.\nElevating people\u2019s moral consciousness is necessary (TJCW 12:\n200\u2013205). This is why Tang thinks strictly political liberalism\nis fatally flawed. Democracy needs a vision of persons as moral\nbeings.\n",
