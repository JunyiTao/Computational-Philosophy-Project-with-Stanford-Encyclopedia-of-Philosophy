    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The idea of the general will\n3.1 The idea of the general will\n\nRousseau\u2019s account of the general will is marked by unclarities\nand ambiguities that have attracted the interest of commentators since\nits first publication. The principal tension is between a democratic\nconception, where the general will is simply what the citizens of the\nstate have decided together in their sovereign assembly, and an\nalternative interpretation where the general will is the transcendent\nincarnation of the citizens\u2019 common interest that exists in\nabstraction from what any of them actually wants (Bertram 2012). To\nthese can be added a general will as the will of individual citizens\ntowards the common good (Canon 2022). All of these interpretations\nfind some support in Rousseau\u2019s texts, and all have been\ninfluential. Contemporary epistemic conceptions of democracy often\nmake reference to Rousseau\u2019s discussion in Book 2 chapter 3 of\nof The Social Contract. These accounts typically take\nCondorcet\u2019s jury theorem as a starting point, where democratic\nprocedures are conceived of as a method for discovering the truth\nabout the public interest; they then interpret the general will as a\ndeliberative means of seeking outcomes that satisfy the preferences of\nindividuals and render the authority of the state legitimate (see for\nexample, Grofman and Feld 1988). The tension between the\n\u201cdemocratic\u201d and the \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nconceptions can be reduced if we take Rousseau to be arguing for the\nview that, under the right conditions and subject to the right\nprocedures, citizen legislators will be led to converge on laws that\ncorrespond to their common interest; however, where those conditions\nand procedures are absent, the state necessarily lacks legitimacy. On\nsuch a reading, Rousseau may be committed to something like an a\nposteriori philosophical anarchism. Such a view holds that it is\npossible, in principle, for a state to exercise legitimate authority\nover its citizens, but all actual states\u2014and indeed all states\nthat we are likely to see in the modern era\u2014will fail to meet\nthe conditions for legitimacy.\n\nRousseau argues that in order for the general will to be truly general\nit must come from all and apply to all. This thought has both\nsubstantive and formal aspects. Formally, Rousseau argues that the law\nmust be general in application and universal in scope. The law cannot\nname particular individuals and it must apply to everyone within the\nstate. Rousseau believes that this condition will lead citizens,\nthough guided by a consideration of what is in their own private\ninterest, to favor laws that both secure the common interest\nimpartially and that are not burdensome and intrusive. For this to be\ntrue, however, it has to be the case that the situation of citizens is\nsubstantially similar to one another. In a state where citizens enjoy\na wide diversity of lifestyles and occupations, or where there is a\ngreat deal of cultural diversity, or where there is a high degree of\neconomic inequality, it will not generally be the case that the impact\nof the laws will be the same for everyone. In such cases it will often\nnot be true that a citizen can occupy the standpoint of the general\nwill merely by imagining the impact of general and universal laws on\nhis or her own case.\n",
