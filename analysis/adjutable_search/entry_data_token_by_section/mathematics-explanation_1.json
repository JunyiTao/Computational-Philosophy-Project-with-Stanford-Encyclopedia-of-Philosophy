    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences || Some historical remarks\n1.1 Some historical remarks\n\nDoes mathematics help explain the physical world or does it actually\nhinder a grasp of the physical mechanisms that explain the how and why\nof natural phenomena? It is not possible here to treat this topic in\nits full complexity but a few remarks will help the reader appreciate\nthe historical importance of the question.\n\nAristotle describes his ideal of scientific knowledge in\n\u201cPosterior Analytics\u201d in terms of, among other things,\nknowledge of the cause:\n\nWe suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a\nthing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the\nsophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact\ndepends as the cause of the fact and of no other, and further, that\nthe fact could not be other than it is. (BWA, 111, Post. An. I.1, 71b\n5\u201310)\n\n\nThe causes [aitia] in question are the four Aristotelian causes:\nformal, material, efficient, and final. Nowadays, translators and\ncommentators of Aristotle prefer to translate aition [aitia] as\n\u2018explanation[s]\u2019, so that the theory of the four causes\nbecomes an account of four types of explanations. For instance, here\nis Barnes\u2019 translation of the passage quoted earlier: \u201cWe\nthink we understand a thing simpliciter (and not in the sophistic\nfashion accidentally) whenever we think we are aware both that the\nexplanation because of which the object is is its explanation, and\nthat it is not possible for this to be otherwise.\u201d (CWA, 115,\nPost. An. I.1, 71b 5\u201310)\n\nBut how do we obtain scientific knowledge? Scientific knowledge is\nobtained through demonstration. However, not all logically cogent\nproofs provide us with the kind of demonstration that yields\nscientific knowledge. In a scientific demonstration \u201cthe\npremisses must be true, primary, immediate, better known and prior to\nthe conclusion, which is further related to them as effect to\ncauses.\u201d (BWA, 112, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20\u201325) In\nBarnes\u2019 translation: \u201cIf, then, understanding is as we\nposited, it is necessary for demonstrative understanding in particular\nto depend on things which are true and primitive and immediate and\nmore familiar than and prior to and explanatory of the\nconclusion.\u201d (CWA, 115, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20\u201325)\n\nAccordingly, in \u201cPosterior Analytics\u201d I.13, Aristotle\ndistinguished between demonstrations \u201cof the fact\u201d and\ndemonstrations \u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d. Although both are\nlogically cogent only the latter mirror the causal structure of the\nphenomena under investigation, and thus provide us with knowledge. We\ncan call them, respectively, \u201cnon-explanatory\u201d and\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d demonstrations.\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s system, physics was not mathematized although\ncausal reasonings were proper to it. However, Aristotle also discussed\nextensively the so-called mixed sciences, such as optics, harmonics,\nand mechanics, characterizing them as \u201cthe more physical of the\nmathematical sciences\u201d. There is a relation of subordination\nbetween these mixed sciences and areas of pure mathematics (see Dear\n2011). For instance, harmonics is subordinated to arithmetic and\noptics to geometry. Aristotle is in no doubt that there are\nmathematical explanations of physical phenomena:\n\nFor here it is for the empirical scientist to know the fact and for\nthe mathematical to know the reason why; for the latter have the\ndemonstrations of the explanations, and often they do not know the\nfact, just as those who consider the universal often do not know some\nof the particulars through lack of observation. (CWA, vol. I, 128,\nPost. An. I.13, 79a1\u201379a7)\n\n\nHowever, the topic of whether mathematics could give explanations of\nnatural phenomena was one on which there was disagreement. As the\ndomains to which mathematics could be applied grew, so also did the\nresistance to it. One source of tension consisted in trying to\nreconcile the Aristotelian conception of pure mathematics, as\nabstracting from matter and motion, with the fact that both physics\n(natural philosophy) and the mixed sciences are all conversant about\nnatural phenomena and thus dependent on matter and motion. For\ninstance, an important debate in the Renaissance, known as the\nQuaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum, focused in large part on\nwhether mathematics could play the explanatory role assigned to it by\nAristotle (Mancuso 1996, ch. 1). Some argued that lacking causality,\nmathematics could not be the \u2018explanatory\u2019 link in the\nexplanation of natural phenomena (see also sections 1.2 and 1.3).\n\nBy the time we reach the seventeenth century and the Newtonian\nrevolution in physics, the problem reappears in the context of a\nchange of criteria of explanation and intelligibility. This has been\nbeautifully described in an article by Y. Gingras (2001). Gingras\nargues that \u201cthe use of mathematics in dynamics (as distinct\nfrom its use in kinematics) had the effect of transforming the very\nmeaning of the term \u2018explanation\u2019 as it was used by\nphilosophers in the seventeenth century\u201d (2001, 385). What\nGingras describes, among other things, is how the mathematical\ntreatment of force espoused by Newton and his followers \u2013 a\ntreatment that ignored the mechanisms that could explain why and how\nthis force operated \u2013 became an accepted standard for\nexplanation during the eighteenth century. After referring to the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries\u2019 discussions on the\nmechanical explanation of gravity, he remarks:\n\nThis episode shows that the evaluation criteria for what was to count\nas an acceptable \u2018explanation\u2019 (of gravitation in this\ncase) were shifting towards mathematics and away from mechanical\nexplanations. Confronted with a mathematical formulation of a\nphenomenon for which there was no mechanical explanation, more and\nmore actors chose the former even at the price of not finding the\nlatter. This was something new. For the whole of the seventeenth\ncentury and most of the eighteenth, to \u2018explain\u2019 a\nphysical phenomenon meant to give a physical mechanism involved in its\nproduction. \u2026 The publication of Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia marks the beginning of this shift where\nmathematical explanations came to be preferred to mechanical\nexplanations when the latter did not conform to calculations. (Gingras\n2001, 398)\n\n\nAmong those who resisted this confusion between \u201cphysical\nexplanations\u201d and \u201cmathematical explanations\u201d was\nthe Jesuit Louis Castel. In \u201cVrai syst\u00e8me de physique\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale de M. Isaac Newton\u201d (1734), he discussed\nPrincipia\u2019s proposition XIII of Book III (on\nKepler\u2019s law of areas). He granted that the proposition\nconnected mathematically the inverse square law to the ellipticity of\nthe course of the planets. However, he objected that \u201cthe one is\nnot the cause, the reason of the other\u201d (Castel 1734, 97) and\nthat Newton had not provided any physical explanation, only a\nmathematical one. Indeed \u201cphysical reasons are necessary reasons\nof entailment, of linkages, of mechanism. In Newton, there is none of\nthis kind.\u201d (Castel 1734, 121)\n\nSome contemporary discussions bear close proximity to these worries.\nConsider Morrison\u2019s book Unifying Scientific Theories\n(2000). One of the major theses of the book is that unification and\nexplanation often pull in different directions and come apart\n(contrary to what is claimed by unification theories of explanation).\nOne of the examples discussed in her introduction reminds us of\nCastel\u2019s objections:\n\nAnother example is the unification of terrestrial and celestial\nphenomena in Newton\u2019s Principia. Although influenced by\nCartesian mechanics, one of the most striking features of the\nPrincipia is its move away from explanations of planetary\nmotions in terms of mechanical causes. Instead, the mathematical form\nof force is highlighted; the planetary ellipses discovered by Kepler\nare \u201cexplained\u201d in terms of a mathematical description of\nthe force that produces those motions. Of course, the inverse-square\nlaw of gravitational attraction explains why the planets move in the\nway they do, but there is no explanation of how this gravitational\nforce acts on bodies (how it is transported), nor is there any account\nof its causal properties. (Morrison 2000, 4)\n\n\nUsing several case studies (Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetism, the\nelectroweak unification, etc.), Morrison argues that the mathematical\nstructures involved in the unification \u201coften supply little or\nno theoretical explanation of the physical dynamics of the unified\ntheory\u201d (Morrison 2000, 4). In short, the mathematical formalism\nfacilitates unification but does not help us explain the how and why\nof physical phenomena.\n\nWe have to close these historical remarks here, although it would be\ninteresting to pursue these questions in a more systematic way into\nthe nineteenth and the twentieth centuries (see however Dorato 2017\nfor a wide-ranging claim concerning \u201cexplanatory switches\u201d\nat crucial junctions in the history of physics).\n\nThe aim of the above was to prepare the ground for showing how in\ncontemporary discussions in philosophy of science, to which we now\nturn, we are still confronted with such issues.\n",
