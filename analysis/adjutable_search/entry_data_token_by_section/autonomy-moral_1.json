    "main_text": "The Concept of Autonomy || Basic Distinctions\n1.1 Basic Distinctions\n\nSeveral distinctions must be made to zero in on the kind of autonomy\nthat is of greatest interest to moral and political theory.\n\u201cMoral autonomy\u201d refers to the capacity to impose the\n(putatively objective) moral law on oneself, and, following Kant, it\nis claimed as a fundamental organizing principle of all morality (Hill\n1989). On the other hand, what can be called \u201cpersonal\nautonomy\u201d is meant as a trait that individuals can exhibit\nrelative to any aspects of their lives, not limited to questions of\nmoral obligation (Dworkin 1988, 34\u201347).\n\nPersonal (or individual) autonomy should also be distinguished from\nfreedom, although again, there are many renderings of these\nconcepts, and certainly some conceptions of positive freedom will be\nequivalent to what is often meant by autonomy (Berlin 1969,\n131\u201334). Generally, one can distinguish autonomy from freedom in\nthat the latter concerns the ability to act, without external or\ninternal constraints and also (on some conceptions) with sufficient\nresources and power to make one\u2019s desires effective (Berlin\n1969, Crocker 1980, MacCallum 1967). Autonomy concerns the\nindependence and authenticity of the desires (values, emotions, etc.)\nthat move one to act in the first place. Some distinguish autonomy\nfrom freedom by insisting that freedom concerns particular acts while\nautonomy is a more global notion, referring to states of a person\n(Dworkin 1988, 13\u201315, 19\u201320). But autonomy can be used to\nrefer both to the global condition (autonomous personhood) and as a\nmore local notion (autonomous relative to a particular trait, motive,\nvalue, or social condition). Addicted smokers for example are\nautonomous persons in a general sense but (for some) helplessly unable\nto control their behavior regarding this one activity (Christman 1989,\n13\u201314; cf. Meyers 1987, 66\u201367).\n\nIn addition, we must keep separate the idea of basic autonomy, the\nminimal status of being responsible, independent and able to speak for\noneself, from ideal autonomy, an achievement that serves as a goal to\nwhich we might aspire and according to which a person is maximally\nauthentic and free of manipulative, self-distorting influences. Any\nplausible conceptualization of basic autonomy must, among other\nthings, imply that most adults who are not suffering from debilitating\npathologies or are under oppressive and constricting conditions count\nas autonomous. Autonomy as an ideal, on the other hand, may well be\nenjoyed by very few if any individuals, for it functions as a goal to\nbe attained.\n\nThe reason to construe basic autonomy broadly enough to include most\nadults is that autonomy connects with other status designators which\napply (or, it is claimed, should apply) in this sweeping manner.\nAutonomy is connected, for example, to moral and legal responsibility,\non some views (e.g., Ripstein 1999); autonomous agency is seen as\nnecessary (and for some sufficient) for the condition of equal\npolitical standing; moreover, being autonomous stands as a barrier to\nunchecked paternalism, both in the personal, informal spheres and in\nlegal arenas (Feinberg 1986). Lacking autonomy, as young children do,\nis a condition which allows or invites sympathy, care, paternalism and\npossibly pity. Therefore, a guiding consideration in evaluating\nparticular conceptions of autonomy (though hardly a hard and fast\ntest) will be whether it connects properly to these ancillary\njudgments (for discussion of \u201cformal conditions\u201d of a\nconcept of autonomy, see Dworkin 1988, 7\u201310).\n",
