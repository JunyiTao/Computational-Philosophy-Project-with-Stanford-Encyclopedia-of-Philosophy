Criticism\n\n\nMuch of the critical discussion of methodological individualism in the\nphilosophy of social science concerns the relationship between what\nWatkins called \u201crock-bottom\u201d explanations and\n\u201chalf-way\u201d ones \u2013 or those that do and those that do\nnot specify an action theoretic mechanism. In general, there is no\nquestion that, given any particular half-way explanation of a social\nphenomenon, it would always be nice to know what agents are\nthinking, when they perform the actions that are involved in the\nproduction of that phenomenon. The question is whether the explanation\nis somehow deficient, or unscientific, in the absence of this\ninformation. The answer to that question will depend upon one\u2019s\nbroader commitments concerning the status and role of the social\nsciences. Nevertheless, it is worth noting two very common types of\nsocial-scientific inquiry that fall short of providing the sort of\nrock-bottom explanations that methodological individualism\ndemands:\n",
