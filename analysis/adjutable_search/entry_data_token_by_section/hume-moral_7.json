    "main_text": "Artificial and Natural Virtues\n9. Artificial and Natural Virtues\n\n\nThe standard object of moral evaluation is a \u201cquality of\nmind,\u201d a character trait. (As we have seen, for Hume evaluation\nof an action is derived from evaluation of the inner quality\nwe suppose to have given rise to it.) The typical moral judgment is\nthat some trait, such as a particular person\u2019s benevolence or\nlaziness, is a virtue or a vice. A character trait, for Hume, is a\npsychological disposition consisting of a tendency to feel a certain\nsentiment or combination of sentiments, ones that often move their\npossessor to action. We reach a moral judgment by feeling approval or\ndisapproval upon contemplating someone\u2019s trait in a disinterested way\nfrom the common point of view. So moral approval is a favorable\nsentiment in the observer elicited by the observed person\u2019s\ndisposition to have certain motivating sentiments.  Thus moral\napproval is a sentiment that is directed toward sentiments, or the\ndispositions to have them.\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume emphasizes that \u201cour sense of\nevery kind of virtue is not natural; but \u2026 there are some\nvirtues, that produce pleasure and approbation by means of an artifice\nor contrivance, which arises from the circumstances and necessities of\nmankind\u201d (T 3.2.1.1). He divides the virtues into those that are\nnatural \u2014 in that our approval of them does not depend upon any\ncultural inventions or jointly-made social rules \u2014 and those\nthat are artificial (dependent both for their existence as character\ntraits and for their ethical merit on the presence of conventional\nrules for the common good), and he gives separate accounts of the two\nkinds. The traits he calls natural virtues are more refined and\ncompleted forms of those human sentiments we could expect to find even\nin people who belonged to no society but cooperated only within small\nfamilial groups. The traits he calls artificial virtues are the ones\nwe need for successful impersonal cooperation; our natural\nsentiments are too partial to give rise to these without\nintervention. In the Treatise Hume includes among the\nartificial virtues honesty with respect to property (which he often\ncalls equity or \u201cjustice,\u201d though it is a strangely narrow\nuse of the term), fidelity to promises (sometimes also listed under\n\u201cjustice\u201d), allegiance to one\u2019s government, conformity to\nthe laws of nations (for princes), chastity (refraining from\nnon-marital sex) and modesty (both primarily for women and girls), and\ngood manners. A great number of individual character traits are listed\nas natural virtues, but the main types discussed in detail are\ngreatness of mind (\u201ca hearty pride, or self-esteem, if\nwell-concealed and well-founded,\u201d T 3.2.2.11), goodness or\nbenevolence (an umbrella category covering generosity, gratitude,\nfriendship, and more), and such natural abilities as prudence and wit,\nwhich, Hume argues, have a reasonably good claim to be included under\nthe title moral virtue, though traditionally they are not. Hume does\nnot explicitly draw a distinction between artificial and natural\nvirtues in the moral Enquiry.\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume argues in turn that the virtues of\nmaterial honesty and of faithfulness to promises and contracts are\nartificial, not natural virtues. Both arguments fall into at least two\nstages: one to show that if we suppose the given character trait to\nexist and to win our approval without help from any cooperative social\narrangement, paradoxes arise; and another, longer stage to explain how\nthe relevant convention might have come into being and to refute those\nwith a different genetic story. He also explains the social\nconstruction of the other artificial virtues and what social good they\nserve.\n10. Honesty with respect to Property\n10.1 The Circle\n\n\nHume offers a rather cryptic argument to show that our approval of\nmaterial honesty must be the product of collaborative human effort\n(convention). When we approve an action, he says, we regard it merely\nas the sign of the motivating passion in the agent\u2019s \u201cmind and\ntemper\u201d that produced it; our evaluation of the action is derived\nfrom our assessment of this inner motive. Therefore all actions deemed\nvirtuous derive their goodness only from virtuous motives \u2014\nmotives we approve. It follows from this that the motive that\noriginally \u201cbestows a merit on any action\u201d can never be\nmoral approval of that action (awareness of its virtue), but must be a\nnon-moral, motivating psychological state \u2014 that is, a state\ndistinct from the \u201cregard to the virtue\u201d of an action\n(moral approval or disapproval) (T 3.2.1.4). For if the\nvirtue-bestowing motive of the action were the agent\u2019s sense that the\nact would be virtuous to do \u2014 if that were why he did it, and why\nwe approved it \u2014 then we would be reasoning in a vicious circle:\nwe would approve of the action derivatively, because we approve of the\nagent\u2019s motive, and this motive would consist of approval of the\naction, which can only be based on approval of a motive... The basis of\nour approval could not be specified. For every virtue, therefore, there\nmust be some non-moral motive that characteristically\nmotivates actions expressive of that virtue, which motive, by eliciting\nour approval, makes the actions so motivated virtuous. The virtue of an\naction of this species would be established by its being done from this\nnon-moral motive, and only then could an agent also or alternatively be\nmoved so to act by her derivative concern for the virtue of the act.\nHowever, Hume observes that there is no morally approved (and\nso virtue-bestowing), non-moral motive of honest action. The only\napproved, reliable motive that we can find for acts of\n\u201cequity\u201d is a moral one, the sense of virtue or \u201cregard to\nthe honesty\u201d of the actions. The honest individual repays a loan not\n(merely) out of self-interest or concern for the well-being of the\nlender (who may be a \u201cprofligate debauchee\u201d who will reap\nonly harm from his possessions), but from a \u201cregard to justice,\nand abhorrence of villainy and knavery\u201d (T 3.2.1.9, 13). This,\nhowever, is \u201cevident sophistry and reasoning in a\ncircle\u2026\u201d Now nature cannot have \u201cestablish\u2019d a\nsophistry, and render\u2019d it necessary and unavoidable\u2026\u201d;\ntherefore, \u201cthe sense of justice and injustice is not deriv\u2019d\nfrom nature, but arises artificially\u2026 from education, and human\nconventions\u201d (T 3.2.1.17). Whatever, exactly, the logic of this\nargument is supposed to be, Hume\u2019s intent is to show that if we imagine\nequity to be a natural virtue we commit ourselves to a sophistry, and\ntherefore honesty is instead man-made.\n\n\nHume offers an account of the genesis of the social convention that\ncreates honesty with respect to property, and this is meant\nto cope in some way with the circularity he identifies. How it does so\nis a matter of interpretive controversy, as we will see.\n10.2 The Origin of Material Honesty\n\n\nHume next poses two questions about the rules of ownership of property\nand the associated virtue of material honesty: what is the artifice by\nwhich human beings create them, and why do we attribute moral goodness\nand evil to the observance and neglect of these rules?\n\n\nBy nature human beings have many desires but are individually\nill-equipped with strength, natural weapons, or natural skills to\nsatisfy them. We can remedy these natural defects by means of social\ncooperation: shared strength, division of labor, and mutual\naid in times of individual weakness. It occurs to people to form a\nsociety as a consequence of their experience with the small family\ngroups into which they are born, groups united initially by sexual\nattraction and familial love, but in time demonstrating the many\npractical advantages of working together with others. However, in the\nconditions of moderate scarcity in which we find ourselves, and given\nthe portable nature of the goods we desire, our untrammeled greed and\nnaturally \u201cconfined generosity\u201d (generosity to those dear\nto us in preference to others) tends to create conflict or undermine\ncooperation, destroying collaborative arrangements among people who\nare not united by ties of affection, and leaving us all materially\npoor. No remedy for this natural partiality is to be found in\n\u201cour natural uncultivated ideas of morality\u201d (T 3.2.2.8);\nan invention is needed.\n\n\nHume argues that we create the rules of ownership of property\noriginally in order to satisfy our avidity for possessions for\nourselves and our loved ones, by linking material goods more securely\nto particular individuals so as to avoid conflict. Within small groups\nof cooperators, individuals signal to one another a willingness to\nconform to a simple rule: to refrain from the material goods others\ncome to possess by labor or good fortune, provided those others will\nobserve the same restraint toward them. (This rule will in time require\nmore detail: specific rules determining who may enjoy which goods\ninitially and how goods may be transferred.) This signalling is not a\npromise (which cannot occur without another, similar convention), but\nan expression of conditional intention. The usefulness of such a custom\nis so obvious that others will soon catch on and express a similar\nintention, and the rest will fall in line. The convention develops\ntacitly, as do conventions of language and money. When an individual\nwithin such a small society violates this rule, the others are aware of\nit and exclude the offender from their cooperative activities. Once the\nconvention is in place, justice (of this sort) is defined as conformity\nwith the convention, injustice as violation of it; indeed, the\nconvention defines property rights, ownership, financial obligation,\ntheft, and related concepts, which had no application before the\nconvention was introduced. So useful and obvious is this invention that\nhuman beings would not live for long in isolated family groups or in\nfluctuating larger groups with unstable possession of goods; their\ningenuity would quickly enable them to invent property, so as to reap\nthe substantial economic benefits of cooperation in larger groups in\nwhich there would be reliable possession of the product, and they would\nthus better satisfy their powerful natural greed by regulating it with\nrules of justice.\n\n\nGreed, and more broadly, self-interest, is the motive for inventing\nproperty; but we need a further explanation why we think of justice\n(adherence to the rules of ownership) as virtuous, and injustice (their\nviolation) as vicious. Hume accounts for the moralization of property\nas follows. As our society grows larger, we may cease to see our own\nproperty violations as a threat to the continued existence of a stable\neconomic community, and this reduces our incentive to conform. But\nwhen we consider violations by others, we partake by sympathy in the\nuneasiness these violations cause to their victims and all of society. Such\ndisinterested uneasiness, and the concomitant pleasure we feel on\ncontemplating the public benefits of adherence, are instances of moral\ndisapproval and approval. We extend these feelings to our own behavior as a\nresult of general rules. This process is \u201cforwarded by the\nartifice of politicians\u201d (T 3.2.2.25), who assist nature by\ncultivating widespread esteem for justice and abhorrence of injustice in order to\ngovern more easily. Private education assists in this further artifice.\nThus material honesty becomes a virtue.\n10.3 The Motive of Honest Actions\n\n\nDoes this account resolve the circularity problem? Is there any\nnon-moral motive of honest action? Some interpreters say yes, it is\ngreed redirected, which removes the circle. But this presents two\ndifficulties: first, our greed is not in fact best satisfied by just\naction in every case, and second, Hume denies that this motive is\napproved. Some interpret Hume as coping with the first difficulty by\nsupposing that politicians and parents deceive us into thinking,\nfalsely, that every individual just act advances the interests of the\nagent; or they claim that Hume himself mistakenly thought so, at least\nin the Treatise (see Baron, Haakonssen, and Gauthier). Others\nclaim that Hume identifies a non-moral motive of honest action (albeit\nan artificial one) other than redirected greed, such as a disposition\nto treat the rules of justice as themselves reason-giving (Darwall) or\nhaving a policy of conforming to the rules of justice as a system\n(Garrett).  Still others say there is no non-moral motive of honest\naction, and Hume escapes from the circle by relaxing this ostensibly\nuniversal requirement on virtuous types of behavior, limiting it to\nthe naturally virtuous kinds. These interpreters either claim that\nthere is no particular motive needed to evoke approval for conformity\nto the rules of property \u2014 mere behavior is enough (Mackie)\n\u2014 or that we approve of a motivating form of the moral sentiment\nitself, the sense of duty (Cohon).\n\n\nHume\u2019s genetic account of property is striking for its lack of\npatriarchal assumptions about the family, its explicit denial that the\ncreation of ownership does or can depend on any promise or contract,\nand its concept of convention as an informal practice of mutual\ncompromise for mutual advantage that arises incrementally and entirely\ninformally, without the use of central authority or force.\n11. Fidelity to Promises\n\n\nFidelity is the virtue of being disposed to fulfill promises and\ncontracts. Hume has in mind promises made \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d\nthat parties undertake to promote their own interest, not affectionate\nexchanges of favors between friends. While he identifies the same circularity\npuzzle about the approved motive of fidelity that he tackles at length\nin connection with honesty, in the case of fidelity he concentrates on a\ndifferent conundrum that arises with the misguided attempt to analyze\nfidelity as a non-conventional (natural) virtue. Unlike Hobbes and\nLocke, who help themselves to the concept of a promise or contract in\ntheir imagined state of nature, Hume argues that the performative\nutterance \u201cI promise\u201d would be unintelligible in the\nabsence of background social conventions, and that the moral obligation\nof a promise is dependent upon such conventions as well.\n\n\nSuppose the practice of giving and receiving promises did not depend\non a socially-defined convention. In that case, what could we mean by\nthe utterances we use to make them, and what would be the origin of our\nobligation to fulfill them? Where the words are used\n(uncharacteristically) in a way that does not purport to\nreveal the agent\u2019s will (as when the person is joking or play-acting), we do not think a promise is really being\nmade; we only take a speaker to have promised, and so to be bound to\nperform, if he understands the words he uses, in particular as\npurporting to obligate him. Thus for effective use there must be some\nact of the speaker\u2019s mind expressed by the special phrase \u201cI\npromise\u201d and its synonyms, and our moral obligation results from\nthis act of the mind. (This seems to be Hobbes\u2019s assumption in\nLeviathan, where the implicit signs of covenant \u2014 as\ndistinct from the explicit ones \u2014 are clear signs of the person\u2019s\nwill.) The requisite mental act or mental state, though, could not be\none of mere desire or resolution to act, since it does not follow from\nour desiring or resolving to act that we are morally obligated to do\nso; nor could it be the volition to act, since that does not come into\nbeing ahead of time when we promise, but only when the time comes to\nact. And of course, one can promise successfully (incur obligation by\npromising) even though one has no intention to perform; so the mental\nact requisite to obligation is not the intention to perform. The only likely act of\nmind that might be expressed in a promise is a mental act of\nwilling to be obligated to perform the promised action, as\nthis conforms to our common view that we bind ourselves by choosing to\nbe bound.\n\n\nBut, Hume argues, it is absurd to think that one can actually bring\nan obligation into existence by willing to be obligated. What makes an\naction obligatory is that its omission is disapproved by unbiased\nobservers. But no act of will within an agent can directly change a previously\nneutral act into one that provokes moral disapproval in observers\n(even in the agent herself). Sentiments are not subject to such\nvoluntary control. Even on a moral rationalist view the thesis would be \nabsurd: to create a new obligation would be to change the abstract\nrelations in which actions and persons stand to one\nanother, and one cannot do this \nby performing in one\u2019s own mind an act of willing such a relation to\nexist. Thus, there is no such act of the mind. Even if people in their\nnatural (pre-conventional) condition \u201ccou\u2019d perceive each other\u2019s\nthoughts by intuition,\u201d they could not understand one another to\nbind themselves by any act of promising, and could not be obligated\nthereby. Since the necessary condition for a natural obligation of\npromises cannot be fulfilled, we may conclude that this obligation is\ninstead the product of group invention to serve the interests of\nsociety.\n\n\nPromises are invented in order to build upon the advantages afforded\nby property.  The invention of mere ownership suffices to\nmake possession stable. The introduction of transfer by consent permits some trade, but so far only simultaneous swapping of visible\ncommodities. Great advantages could be gained by all if people could\nbe counted on to provide goods or services later for benefits given\nnow, or exchange goods that are distant or described generically. But\nfor people without the capacity to obligate themselves to future\naction, such exchanges would depend upon the party who performs second doing so\nout of gratitude alone; and that motive cannot generally be\nrelied on in self-interested transactions. However, we can devise better\nways to satisfy our appetites \u201cin an oblique and artificial manner...\u201d\n(T 3.2.5.9). First, people can easily recognize that additional kinds\nof mutual exchanges would serve their interests. They need only\nexpress this interest to one another in order to encourage everyone to\ninvent and to keep such agreements. They devise a form of words to\nmark these new sorts of exchanges (and distinguish them from the\ngenerous reciprocal acts of friendship and gratitude). When someone\nutters this form of words, he is understood to express a resolution to\ndo the action in question, and he \u201csubjects himself to the penalty of\nnever being trusted again in case of failure\u201d (T 3.2.5.10), a penalty\nmade possible by the practice of the group, who enforce the\nrequirement to keep promises by the simple expedient of refusing to\ncontract with those whose word cannot be trusted . This \u201cconcert or\nconvention\u201d (ibid.) alters human motives to act. One is moved by\nself-interest to give the promising sign (in order to obtain the other\nparty\u2019s cooperation), and once one has given it, self-interest demands\nthat one do what one promised to do so as to insure that people will\nexchange promises with one in the future. Some interpreters say that\nthis enlightened self-interest remains the only motive for keeping\none\u2019s promise, once the practice of promising has been created. But\nHume says the sentiment of morals comes to play the same role in\npromise-keeping that it does in the development of honesty with\nrespect to property (T 3.2.5.12); so there is evidence he thinks the\nmoral sentiment not only becomes \u201cannex\u2019d\u201d to\npromise-keeping but further motivates it. In larger, more anonymous\ncommunities, a further incentive is needed besides the fear of\nexclusion; and a sentiment of moral approval of promise-keeping arises\nas the result of sympathy with all who benefit from the practice,\naided by a \u201csecond artifice,\u201d the well-meaning\npsychological manipulation of the people by parents and politicians,\nwhich yields a near-universal admiration of fidelity and shame at\nbreaking one\u2019s word (T 3.2.5.12). This may provide a moral motive for\npromise-keeping even in anonymous transactions.\n12. Allegiance to Government\n\n\nA small society can maintain a subsistence-level economy without any\ndominion of some people over others, relying entirely on voluntary\ncompliance with conventions of ownership, transfer of goods, and\nkeeping of agreements, and relying on exclusion as the sole means of\nenforcement. But an increase in population and/or material\nproductivity, Hume thinks, tends to stimulate a destabilizing rate of\ndefection from the rules: more luxury goods greatly increase the\ntemptation to act unjustly, and more anonymous transactions make it\nseem likely that one will get away with it. Though people are aware\nthat injustice is destructive of social cooperation and so ultimately\ndetrimental to their own interests, this knowledge will not enable\nthem to resist such strong temptation, because of an inherent human\nweakness: we are more powerfully drawn to a near-term good even when\nwe know we will pay for it with the loss of a greater long-term\ngood. This creates the need for government to enforce the rules of\nproperty and promise (the \u201claws of nature,\u201d as Hume\nsometimes rather ironically calls them, since on his view they are not\nnatural). This is the reason for the invention of government. Once in\npower, rulers can also make legitimate use of their authority to\nresolve disputes over just what the rules of justice require in\nparticular cases, and to carry out projects for the common good such\nas building roads and dredging harbors.\n\n\nHume thinks it unnecessary to prove that allegiance to government is\nthe product of convention and not mere nature, since governments are\nobviously social creations. But he does need to explain the creation of\ngovernments and how they solve the problem he describes. He speculates\nthat people who are unaccustomed to subordination in daily life might\ndraw the idea for government from their experience of wars with other\nsocieties, when they must appoint a temporary commander. To overcome\nthe preference for immediate gain over long-term security, the people\nwill need to arrange social circumstances so that the conformity to\njustice is in people\u2019s immediate interest. This cannot be done with\nrespect to all the people, but it can be done for a few. So the people\nselect magistrates (judges, kings, and the like) and so position them\n(presumably with respect to rank and wealth) that it will be in those\nmagistrates\u2019 immediate interest not only to obey but to enforce the\nrules of justice throughout society. Hume is vague about the incentives \nof the magistrates, but apparently they are so pleased with their own\nshare of wealth and status that they are not tempted by the possessions\nof others; and since they are \u201cindifferent\u2026 to the\ngreatest part of the state,\u201d they have no incentive to assist\nanyone in any crimes (T3.2.7.6). Thus the magistrates\u2019 most immediate\ninterest lies in preserving their own status and wealth by protecting\nsociety. (Perhaps more directly, they stand to lose their favored\nstatus if they are found by the people not to enforce the rules of\njustice.)\n\n\nIt is possible for the people to agree to appoint magistrates in spite\nof the incurable human attraction to the proximal good even when\nsmaller than a remote good, because this predilection only takes\neffect when the lesser good is immediately at hand. When considering\ntwo future goods, people always prefer the greater, and make decisions\naccordingly.  So looking to the future, people can decide now to\nempower magistrates to force them to conform to the rules of justice\nin the time to come so as to preserve society.  When the time comes to\nobey and individuals are tempted to violate the rules, the long-range\nthreat this poses to society may not move them to desist, but the\nimmediate threat of punishment by the magistrates will.\n\n\nWe initially obey our magistrates from self-interest. But once\ngovernment is instituted, we come to have a moral obligation to obey\nour governors; this is another artificial duty that needs to be\nexplained. On Hume\u2019s view it is independent of the obligation of promises.\nWe are bound to our promises and to obey the magistrates\u2019 commands on\nparallel grounds: because both kinds of conformity are so manifestly beneficial for \nall. Governors merely insure that the rules of justice are generally\nobeyed in the sort of society where purely voluntary conventions would\notherwise break down. As in the case of fidelity to promises, the\ncharacter trait of allegiance to our governors generates sympathy with\nits beneficiaries throughout society, making us approve the trait as a\nvirtue.\n\n\nThe duty of allegiance to our present governors does not depend upon\ntheir or their ancestors\u2019 divine right to govern, Hume says, nor on\nany promise we have made to them or any contract that transfers rights\nto them, but rather on the general social value of having a\ngovernment.  Rulers thus need not be chosen by the people in order to\nbe legitimate.  Consequently, who is the ruler will often be a matter\nof salience and imaginative association; and it will be no ground for\nlegitimate rebellion that a ruler was selected arbitrarily.  Rulers\nidentified by long possession of authority, present possession,\nconquest, succession, or positive law will be suitably salient and so\nlegitimate, provided their rule tends to the common good.  Although\ngovernments exist to serve the interests of their people, changing\nmagistrates and forms of government for the sake of small advantages\nto the public would yield disorder and upheaval, defeating the purpose\nof government; so our duty of allegiance forbids this.  A government\nthat maintains conditions preferable to what they would be without it\nretains its legitimacy and may not rightly be overthrown.  But\nrebellion against a cruel tyranny is no violation of our duty of\nallegiance, and may rightly be undertaken.  \n\n\nHume does advocate some forms of government as being preferable to\nothers, particularly in his Essays. Governments structured by\nlaws are superior to those controlled by the edicts of rulers or ruling\nbodies (\u201cThat Politics May Be Reduced to a Science\u201d).\nRepresentative democracy is superior to direct democracy, and\n\u201cfree\u201d (popular) governments are more hospitable to trade\nthan \u201cabsolute\u201d governments (ibid.). Hume speculates that a\nperfect government would be a representative democracy of\nproperty-holders with division of powers and some features of\nfederalism (\u201cIdea of a Perfect Commonwealth\u201d). He defends\nhis preferences by arguing that certain forms of government are less\nprone to corruption, faction (with the concomitant threat of civil\nwar), and oppressive treatment of the people than others; that is, they\nare more likely to enforce the rules of justice, adjudicate fairly, and\nencourage peace and prosperity.\n\n\nHume famously criticizes the social contract theory of political\nobligation. According to his own theory, our duty to obey our\ngovernors is not reducible to an instance of our duty to fulfill\npromises, but arises separately though in a way parallel to the\ngenesis of that duty.  Hume denies that any native citizen or subject\nin his own day has made even a tacit promise to obey the government,\ngiven that citizens do not think they did any such thing, but rather\nthink they are born to obey it. Even a tacit contract requires that\nthe will be engaged, and we have no memory of this; nor do governments\nrefrain from punishing disloyalty in citizens who have given no tacit\npromise.\n13. The Natural Virtues\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume\u2019s principle interest in the natural\nvirtues lies in explaining the causes that make us approve them. The\nmechanism of sympathy ultimately accounts for this approval and the\ncorresponding disapproval of the natural vices. Sympathy also explains\nour approval of the artificial virtues; the difference is that we\napprove of those as a result of sympathy with the cumulative effects\nproduced by the general practice of the artificial virtues on the\nwhole of society (individual acts of justice not always producing\npleasure for anyone); whereas we approve each individual exercise of\nsuch natural virtues as gratitude and friendship because we sympathize\nwith those who are affected by each such action when we consider it\nfrom the common point of view. As we saw, he argues that the traits of\nwhich we approve fall into four groups: traits immediately agreeable\nto their possessor or to others, and traits advantageous to their\npossessor or to others. In these four groups of approved traits, our\napproval arises as the result of sympathy bringing into our minds the\npleasure that the trait produces for its possessor or for others (with\none minor exception). This is especially clear with such\nself-regarding virtues as prudence and industry, which we approve even\nwhen they occur in individuals who provide no benefit to us observers;\nthis can only be explained by our sympathy with the benefits that\nprudence and industry bring to their possessors.\n\n\nAccording to Hume, different levels and manifestations of the passions\nof pride and humility make for virtue or for vice. An obvious and\n\u201cover-weaning conceit\u201d is disapproved by any observer (is\na vice) (T 3.3.2.1); while a well-founded but concealed self-esteem is\napproved (is a virtue). Hume explains these opposite reactions to such\nclosely related character traits by means of the interplay of the\nobserver\u2019s sympathy with a distinct psychological mechanism he calls\ncomparison. The mechanism of comparison juxtaposes a\nsympathetically-communicated sentiment with the observer\u2019s own\ninherent feeling, causing the observer to feel a sentiment opposite to\nthe one she observes in another (pleasure if the other is suffering,\npain if the other is pleased) when the sympathetically-communicated\nsentiment is not too strong. A person who displays excessive pride\nirritates others because, while others come to feel this person\u2019s\npleasant sentiment of pride (to some degree) via sympathy, they also\nfeel a greater uneasiness as a result of comparing that great pride\n(in whose objects they do not believe) with their own lesser pride in\nthemselves; this is why conceit is a vice. Self-esteem founded on an\naccurate assessment of one\u2019s strengths and politely concealed from\nothers, though, is both agreeable and advantageous to its possessor\nwithout being distressing to others, and so is generally\napproved. (Thus the professed preference of Christians for humility\nover self-esteem does not accord with the judgments of most\nobservers.) Although excessive pride is a natural vice and self-esteem\na natural virtue, human beings in society create\nthe artificial virtue of good breeding (adherence to customs\nof slightly exaggerated mutual deference in accordance with social\nrank) to enable us each to conceal our own pride easily so that it\ndoes not shock the pride of others.\n\n\nCourage and military heroism are also forms of pride. Though the\nstudent of history can see that military ambition has mostly been\ndisadvantageous to human society, when we contemplate the\n\u201cdazling\u201d character of the hero, immediate sympathy\nirresistibly leads us to approve it (T 3.3.2.15).\n\n\nOur approval of those traits that may be grouped together under the\nheading of goodness and benevolence, such as generosity, humanity,\ncompassion, and gratitude, arises from sympathy with people in the\nindividual\u2019s \u201cnarrow circle\u201d of friends and associates,\nsince, given natural human selfishness, we cannot expect people\u2019s\nconcerns to extend farther (T 3.3.3.2). By adopting the common point of\nview we correct for the distortions of sympathy by entering into the\nfeelings of those close to the person being evaluated even if they are\nremote from us. The vice of cruelty is most loathed because the\nsuffering of the person\u2019s victims that reaches us via sympathy readily\nbecomes hatred of the perpetrator.\n\n\nAlthough natural abilities of the mind are not traditionally\nclassified as moral virtues and vices, the difference between these\ntypes of traits is unimportant, Hume argues. Intelligence, good\njudgment, application, eloquence, and wit are also mental qualities\nthat bring individuals the approbation of others, and their absence is\ndisapproved. As is the case with many of the traditionally-recognized\nvirtues, the various natural abilities are approved either because they\nare useful to their possessor or because they are immediately agreeable\nto others. It is sometimes argued that moral virtues are unlike natural\nabilities in that the latter are involuntary, but Hume argues that many\ntraditional moral virtues are involuntary as well. The sole difference\nis that the prospect of reward or punishment can induce people to act\nas the morally virtuous would (as justice requires, for example), but\ncannot induce them to act as if they had the natural abilities.\n14. Differences between the Treatise and the Moral Enquiry\n\n\nLate in his life Hume deemed the Enquiry concerning the Principles\nof Morals his best work, and in style it is a model of elegance\nand subtlety. His method in that work differs from that of the\nTreatise: instead of explicating the nature of virtue and vice\nand our knowledge of them in terms of underlying features of the human\nmind, he proposes to collect all the traits we know from common sense\nto be virtues and vices, observe what those in each group have in\ncommon, and from that observation discover the \u201cfoundation of\nethics\u201d (EPM 1.10). The conclusions largely coincide with those\nof the Treatise. Some topics in the Treatise are\nhandled more fully in the moral Enquiry; for example Hume\u2019s\naccount of the motive to just action is enriched by his discussion\nof a challenge from a \u201csensible knave.\u201d However, without\nthe detailed background theories of the mind, the passions, motivation\nto action, and social convention presented in the Treatise,\nand without any substitute for them, some of the conclusions of the\nmoral Enquiry stand unsupported.\n\n\nIn the latter work, Hume\u2019s main argument that reason alone is not\nadequate to yield moral evaluations (in Appendix 1) depends on\nhis having demonstrated throughout the book that at least one\nfoundation of moral praise lies in the usefulness to society of the\npraised character trait. We use reason extensively to learn the effects\nof various traits and to identify the useful and pernicious ones. But\nutility and disutility are merely means; were we indifferent to the\nweal and woe of mankind, we would feel equally indifferent to the\ntraits that promote those ends. Therefore there must be some sentiment\nthat makes us favor the one over the other. This could only be\nhumanity, \u201ca feeling for the happiness of mankind, and resentment\nof their misery\u201d (EPM App. 1.3). This argument presupposes that\nthe moral evaluations we make are themselves the expression of\nsentiment rather than reason alone. (The alternative position would be\nthat while of course we do feel approval and disapproval for vice and\nvirtue, the judgment as to which is which is itself the deliverance of\nreason.) So Hume appends some arguments directed against the hypothesis\nof moral rationalism. One of these is an enriched version of the\nargument of Treatise 3.1.1 that neither demonstrative nor causal\nreasoning has moral distinctions as its proper object, since moral vice\nand virtue cannot plausibly be analyzed as either facts or relations.\nHe adds that while in our reasonings we start from the knowledge of\nrelations or facts and infer some previously-unknown relation or fact,\nmoral evaluation cannot proceed until all the relevant facts and\nrelations are already known. At that point, there is nothing further\nfor reason to do; therefore moral evaluation is not the work of reason\nalone but of another faculty. He bolsters this line of argument by\nexpanding his Treatise analogy between moral and aesthetic\njudgment, arguing that just as our appreciation of beauty awaits full\ninformation about the object but requires the further contribution of\ntaste, so in moral evaluation our assessment of merit or villainy\nawaits full knowledge of the person and situation but requires the\nfurther contribution of approbation or disapprobation. He also offers\nthe argument that since the chain of reasons why one acts must finally\nstop at something that is \u201cdesirable on its own account\u2026\nbecause of its immediate accord or agreement with\nsentiment\u2026\u201d (EPM App.1.19), sentiment is needed to account\nfor ultimate human ends; and since virtue is an end, sentiment and not\nreason alone must distinguish moral good and evil.\n\n\nIn the moral Enquiry Hume omits all arguments to show that\nreason alone does not move us to act; so the Representation\nArgument about the irrelevance of reason to passions and actions is absent.\nWithout it he has no support for his direct\nargument that moral goodness and evil are not identical with\nreasonableness and unreasonableness, which relies on it for its key\npremise; and that too is absent from EPM. On the whole in EPM Hume\ndoes not appeal to the thesis that reason cannot produce motives in\norder to show that morals are not derived from reason alone, but\nlimits himself to the epistemic and descriptive arguments showing that\nreason alone cannot discern virtue and vice in order to reject ethical\nrationalism in favor of sentimentalism.  However, at Appendix I.21 he\ndoes assert (without support) that \u201cReason, being cool and disengaged,\nis no motive to action,\u201d and perhaps this is intended to be a premise\nin a revised version of the famous argument that reason cannot produce\nmotives but morals can, though what he writes here is tantalizingly\ndifferent from that argument as it appears repeatedly in\nthe Treatise.\n\n\nWhy did Hume omit the more fundamental arguments for the\nmotivational inertia of reason? He may have reconsidered and rejected\nthem. For example, he may have given up his undefended claim that\npassions have no representative character, a premise of the\nRepresentation Argument on which, as we saw, some of his fundamental\nanti-rationalist arguments depend. Or he may have retained these views\nbut opted not to appeal to anything so arcane in a work aimed at a\nbroader audience and intended to be as accessible as possible. The\nmoral Enquiry makes no use of ideas and impressions, and so no\narguments that depend on that distinction can be offered there,\nincluding the Representation Argument. Apparently Hume thought he could\nshow that reason and sentiment rule different domains without using\nthose arguments.\n\n\nThus, not surprisingly, the causal analysis of sympathy as a mechanism\nof vivacity-transferal from the impression of the self to the ideas of\nthe sentiments of others is entirely omitted from the moral\nEnquiry. Hume still appeals to sympathy there to explain the\norigin of all moral approval and disapproval, but he explains our\nsympathy with others simply as a manifestation of the sentiment of\nhumanity, which is given more prominence. He is still concerned about the objection that sympathetically-acquired sentiments vary with spatial and temporal distance from the\nobject of evaluation while moral assessments do not; so he addresses it in the moral Enquiry as well,\nand resolves it by appealing once again to the common point of view.\nIn the Enquiry he places more emphasis on sympathy with the interests of the whole of society, in part achieved by conversation using shared moral vocabulary,\nas a way to correct our initial sentiments to make them genuinely moral (Taylor 2002). He also attends more explicitly to the role of reason and reflection in moral evaluation. Some interpreters see him as offering an account of how to arrive at reliable moral judgment superior to that in the Treatise (Taylor 2015). \n\n\nThe distinction between artificial and natural virtues that\ndominates the virtue ethics of the Treatise is almost entirely\nabsent from the moral Enquiry; the term \u2018artificial\u2019\noccurs in the latter only once in a footnote. Gone are the paradoxes of\nproperty and promises intended to prove that particular virtues are\ndevised on purpose; also missing is what some commentators think Hume\u2019s\nmost original contribution to the theory of justice, his account of\nconvention. Yet Hume briefly sketches part of the same \nquasi-historical account of the origin of justice that he gives in the\nTreatise; and while the emphasis has shifted, Hume not only\ntries to show that justice has merit only because of its beneficial\nconsequences, but that \u201cpublic utility is the sole\norigin of justice\u201d \u2014 were we not to find it useful (and in\nsome conditions we might not) we would not even have such a thing (EPM\n3.1.1). While any explanation of this shift and these omissions is\nmerely speculative, here it seems that Hume does not change his mind\nabout the arguments of the Treatise but chooses to lead the\nreader to the same conclusions by more subtle and indirect means while\navoiding provocative claims.\n\n\nIn the moral Enquiry Hume is more explicit about what he\ntakes to be the errors of Christian (or, more cautiously, Roman\nCatholic) moralists. Not only have they elevated craven humility to\nthe status of a virtue, which he hints in the Treatise is a\nmistake, but they also favor penance, fasting, and other\n\u201cmonkish virtues\u201d that are in fact disapproved by all\nreasonable folk for their uselessness and disagreeableness, and so are\nin fact vices.",
