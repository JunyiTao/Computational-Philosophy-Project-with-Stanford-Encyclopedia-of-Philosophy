    "main_text": "Quantum Field Theory and the Common Cause Principle\n9. Quantum Field Theory and the Common Cause Principle\n\nRelativistic quantum field theory (see entry on\n quantum field theory)\n predicts an abundance of correlations between observables that are\nlocalized in spacelike separated (hence causally independent)\nspacetime regions. This is a consequence of prevalence of entanglement\nand of violation of Bell\u2019s inequality in quantum field theory,\nwhich is even more striking than violation of Bell\u2019s inequality\nby standard, non-relativistic quantum mechanics (Summers 1997; Clifton\n& Halvorson 2001; Halvorson & Clifton 2000; entry on\n Bell\u2019s theorem).\n If relativistic quantum field theory is causally closed in the sense\nof providing common causes of these correlations, then this theory is\nconfirming evidence for the truth of the Common Cause Principle.\n\nThe quantum probability spaces describing relativistic quantum field\ntheory are based on type III von Neumann algebras (Haag 1992; Horuzhy\n1986 [1990]; Araki 1993 [1999]; entry on\n quantum field theory;\n consequently, these quantum probability spaces are measure\ntheoretically purely non-atomic. It follows then from the common cause\ncompleteness of such quantum probability spaces that there exists\ncommon causes of the correlations between spacelike separated\nobservables. Yet, one cannot conclude from this that quantum field\ntheory satisfies the Common Cause Principle, for the following reason:\nobservables in quantum field theory are explicitly associated with\nspecific spacetime regions. So the common causes also should be\nrequired to belong to specific spacetime regions. Given a correlation\nbetween observable A localized in spacetime region \\(V_1\\) and\nobservable B localized in spacetime region \\(V_2\\) spacelike\nseparated from \\(V_1\\), the common cause for this correlation should\nbe localized in a region V that is in the intersection of the\nbackward light cones of the spacelike separated spacetime regions\n\\(V_1\\) and \\(V_2\\). But the mere pure non-atomicity of the quantum\nprobability space of quantum field theory does not entail any such\nlocality of the common causes that exist as a consequence of the\nnon-atomicity of the quantum probability space describing quantum\nfields. When one imposes this additional localizability constraint on\nthe common causes in quantum field theory, the question of whether\nsuch properly localized common causes exist according to the\ntheory, becomes a highly non-trivial problem (R\u00e9dei 1997). So\nnon-trivial that the answer to it is still not known\u2014the problem\nof status of causal completeness of quantum field theory is an open\nquestion.\n\nIt is known however that quantum field theory is causally complete in\nthe weaker sense of containing common causes localized in the\nunion (as opposed to the intersection) of the\nbackward light cones of the spacelike separated spacetime regions\n\\(V_1\\) and \\(V_2\\) that contain the correlated observables\n(R\u00e9dei & Summers 2002, 2007b; Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et al.\n2013). It also is possible logically that the status of the Common\nCause Principle in relativistic quantum field theory cannot be\ndecided: The quantum field theory in which the abundance of\ncorrelations between spacelike separated observables has been proven\nis defined by axioms (Haag-Kastler axiomatization). The axioms might\njust be too weak to give an answer to the question whether all\ncorrelations between spacelike separated observables have properly\nlocalized common causes. Proving such an independence result would be\nvery interesting. Given how difficult it is to create any model of the\nHaag-Kastler axioms, attempting such a proof also appears to be\nextremely difficult because it requires displaying two models, one in\nwhich the Common Cause Principle holds (with properly localized common\ncauses), one in which it does not.\n\nOne also can consider the problem of the status of the Common Cause\nPrinciple in discrete (lattice) quantum field theory. This is a\nsimplified model of quantum field theory in which calculations are\nfrequently easier to carry out. One of the simplifications of this\ntheory is that the algebras of local observables are finite\ndimensional. The quantum probability spaces determined by such\nobservables are not purely non-atomic and this prevents common\ncauses\u2014localized or not\u2014to exist in these theories\n(Hofer-Szab\u00f3 & Vecserny\u00e9s 2012a). If, in the quantum\ncontext, one allows common causes not to commute with the correlated\nobservables, then \u201cnon-commutative\u201d common causes can be\nshown to exist in lattice quantum field theory (Hofer-Szab\u00f3\n& Vecserny\u00e9s 2012b, 2013, 2018). One also can raise the\nproblem of the status of the Common Cause Principle in categorial\nquantum field theory (Brunetti, Fredenhagen, & Verch 2003;\nR\u00e9dei 2014a). This requires a reformulation of the concept of\ncommon cause in terms of the notions of the categories used in\ncategorial quantum field theory, which is done in R\u00e9dei\n(2014a). This then leads to a number of specific questions about the\nstatus of the suitable reformulated Common Cause Principle. Most of\nthese questions are open\u2014this is an active area of research.\n",
