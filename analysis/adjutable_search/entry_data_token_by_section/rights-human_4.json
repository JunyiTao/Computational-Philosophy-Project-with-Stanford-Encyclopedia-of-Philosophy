    "main_text": "Which Rights are Human Rights? || Civil and Political Rights\n3.1 Civil and Political Rights\n\nThe least controversial family of human rights is civil and political\nrights. These rights are familiar from historic bills of rights such\nas the\n French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\n (1789) and the\n U.S. Bill of Rights\n (1791, with subsequent amendments). Contemporary sources include the\nfirst 21 Articles of the\n Universal Declaration,\n and treaties such as the\n European Convention,\n the\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\n the\n American Convention on Human Rights,\n and the\n African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights.\n Some representative formulations follow: \n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought and expression. This\nright includes freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and\nideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in\nwriting, in print, in the form of art, or through any other medium of\none\u2019s choice. (American Convention on Human Rights, Article\n13.1)\n\n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom\nof association with others, including the right to form and to join\ntrade unions for the protection of his interests (European Convention,\nArticle 11).\n\n\nEvery citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the\ngovernment of his country, either directly or through freely chosen\nrepresentatives in accordance with the provisions of the law. 2. Every\ncitizen shall have the right of equal access to the public service of\nhis country. 3. Every individual shall have the right of access to\npublic property and services in strict equality of all persons before\nthe law (African Charter, Article 13).\n\n\nMost civil and political rights are not absolute\u2014they can in\nsome cases be overridden by other considerations. For example, the\nright to freedom of movement can be restricted by public and private\nproperty rights, by restraining orders related to domestic violence,\nand by legal punishments. Further, after a disaster such as a\nhurricane or earthquake free movement is often appropriately suspended\nto keep out the curious, permit access of emergency vehicles and\nequipment, and prevent looting. The International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights permits rights to be suspended during times\n\u201cof public emergency which threatens the life of the\nnation\u201d (Article 4). But it excludes some rights from suspension\nincluding the right to life, the prohibition of torture, the\nprohibition of slavery, the prohibition of ex post facto criminal\nlaws, and freedom of thought and religion.\n",
