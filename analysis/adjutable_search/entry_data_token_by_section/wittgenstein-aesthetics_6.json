    "main_text": "The Critique of Scientism || The \u201cClick\u201d of Coherence\n2.2 The \u201cClick\u201d of Coherence\n\n\nAesthetic satisfaction, for Wittgenstein, is an experience that is\nonly possible within a culture and where the reaction that constitutes\naesthetic satisfaction or justification is both more immediate, and\nvastly larger and more expansive, than any simple mechanistic account\ncould accommodate. It is more immediate in that it is not usually\npossible to specify in advance the exact conditions required to\nproduce the satisfaction, or, as he discusses it, the\n\u201cclick\u201d when everything falls into place. Such exacting\npre-specifications for satisfaction are possible in narrowly\nrestricted empirical cases where, for example, we wait for two\npointers in a vision examination to come into a position directly\nopposite each other. And this, Wittgenstein says, is the kind of\nsimile we repeatedly use, but misleadingly, for in truth \u201creally\nthere is nothing that clicks or that fits anything\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 19). The satisfaction is more immediate, then,\nthan the causal-mechanistic model would imply. And it is much broader\nthan the causal-mechanistic model implies as well: there is no direct\naesthetic analogue to the matched pointers in the case of a larger and\ndeeper form of aesthetic gratification. Wittgenstein does, of course,\nallow that there are very narrow, isolated circumstances within a work\nwhere we do indeed have such empirical pre-specifiable conditions for\nsatisfaction (e.g. where in a piece we see that we wanted to hear a\nminor ninth, and not a minor seventh, chord). But, contrary to the\nempirical-causal account, these will not add up, exhaustively or\nwithout remainder, to the experience of aesthetic satisfaction. The\nproblem, to which Wittgenstein repeatedly returns in these lectures,\nis with the kind of answer we want to aesthetic puzzlement as\nexpressed in a question like \u201cWhy do these bars give me such a\npeculiar impression?\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 20) In such cases,\nstatistical results regarding percentages of subjects who report this\npeculiar impression rather than another one in precisely these\nharmonic, rhythmic, and melodic circumstances are not so much\nimpossible as just beside the point; the kind of question we\nhave here is not met by such methods. \u201cThe sort of explanation\none is looking for when one is puzzled by an aesthetic impression is\nnot a causal explanation, not one corroborated by experience or by\nstatistics as to how people react\u2026. This is not what one means\nor what one is driving at by an investigation into aesthetics\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 21). It is all too easy to falsify, under the\ninfluence of explanatory models misappropriated from science, the many\nand varied kinds of things that happen when, aesthetically speaking,\neverything seems to click or fall into place.\n",
