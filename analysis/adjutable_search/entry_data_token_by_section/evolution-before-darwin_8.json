    "main_text": "Buffon\u2019s Transformation of Enlightenment Natural History || Buffon on the Generation of Organisms\n3.2 Buffon on the Generation of Organisms\n\nThe concrete manifestation of Buffon\u2019s combination of novel\nmethodology and empirical inquiry is first displayed by his treatment\nof embryological generation in the second volume of his Natural\nHistory (1749). These principles also underlie his unusual\nanalysis of the meaning of \u201cspecies\u201d in natural history.\nIn both instances, the notion of epistemic certitude gained from a\n\u201cconstant recurrence\u201d of events plays a fundamental role\nin his reflections. Following the lead of his friend Maupertuis,\nBuffon also endorsed the theory of the male and female seeds to\nexplain sexual generation, deriving the origin of the embryo from the\nmechanical mixture of these ingredients. Amplifying upon\nMaupertuis\u2019s prior speculations (see above Section 2.4), he\nexplained the organization of the particles of these two seeds into a\nstructured whole through microforces closely identified with Newtonian\nattractive forces that formed an organizing force-field, an\n\u201cinternal mould\u201d, that assimilated matter in the proper\norder for embryological development. Viewed in longer historical\nperspective, Buffon\u2019s theory of the internal mould functioned in\na way similar to Aristotle\u2019s notion of an immanent substantial\nform, and was likely influenced by Aristotle\u2019s discussions in\nDe generatione animalium (see above Section 1.1). This\n\u201cmould\u201d serves as an immanent principle of organization\nthat acts in company with matter to structure the unified organism by\ngradual development. The internal mould also guaranteed the\nperpetuation of like by like over time. Unlike Aristotle\u2019s\nsubstantial form, however, Buffon\u2019s internal mould is without an\ninternal finality in its action. It is also not a principle of\nvitalization.\n\nTo explain the formation of the fetus, Buffon was conceptually\nrequired to attribute some new powers to matter to account for\norganization. In pursuing this option, he broke with universal\nmechanism and the assumption of the passivity of matter that was an\nintrinsic component of the mechanical philosophy and some\ninterpretations of Newtonianism (see above Section 2.3). There are\nalso important similarities of his new \u201cvitalism\u201d to that\nfound in Leibnizian discussions such as was expounded in the\nInstitutions de Physique of \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\nin 1740 (Sloan 2019). To give a plausible account of embryological\nformation, vital properties therefore had to be attributed to a\nspecific kind of matter confined to living beings, the organic\nmolecules, which had their own inherent dynamic and specifying\nproperties.\n\nThe introduction of the concept of \u201cvital\u201d matter by\nBuffon, even with restrictions on its actions, represents an important\ndevelopment in the history of the life sciences of this period. It\nbroke with the uniformity of matter assumed by the Newtonian,\nGassendist, and Cartesian traditions, and in a limited way it\npositioned Buffon at the opening of the \u201cvitalist\u201d\nrevolution which initiated the first reflections on genuine species\ntransformism, even though Buffon himself never moved into this new\nconceptual domain (Reill 2005: chp. 1).\n\nIn his original presentations, Buffon posited that these internal\nmoulds and specifying organic molecules originated by divine creation.\nAs the Natural History progressed, however, Buffon\nincreasingly viewed the organic molecules to be formed from an\noriginal undifferentiated \u201cbrute\u201d matter, and the internal\nmoulds themselves were seen to arise spontaneously, obtaining their\nspecificity of action purely from the differential forces of\nattraction between different shapes of organic particles (Buffon\n\u201cDe la Nature. Seconde vue\u201d, 1765, [OP, 38\u201341]).\n",
