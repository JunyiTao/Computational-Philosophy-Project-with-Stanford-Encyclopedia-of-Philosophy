    "main_text": "Phenomenological Ontology and Philosophical Anthropology || The Nature of Persons\n3.2 The Nature of Persons\n\nStein was concerned with the nature of the \u201cperson\u201d from\nthe beginning of her career, inspired by her teachers Stern, Husserl,\nand Scheler. In Empathy, she argues for the\n\u201cconstitution\u201d of the person in emotional experiences;\nfeelings \u201cannounce personal attributes\u201d (Stein 1917:\n117[99]), whereas mere bodily sensations do not (see\n sect. 2.2).\n Persons are unities, and indeed instantiate value; and each person is\ncorrelated to a \u201cvalue-world\u201d (Wertwelt; 1917:\n136[108]). Her 1922 Beitr\u00e4ge extended her discussion of\npersons, developing a layered ontology of body, soul, and spirit, and\ndiscussing her concept of \u201clife-power\u201d in detail (see\n sect. 2.1).\n In her later works, Stein embeds her phenomenological account of\nconscious life into a more Thomistic metaphysical, but also\nexistential, conception of the person.\n\nStein agrees with Scheler that a person is\n\u201cvalue-sensitive\u201d or \u201cvalue-tropic\u201d\n(werthaftig; 1922: 190[227]) and has \u201cpermeability for\nvalues in general\u201d (1922: 190[227]). Persons are intrinsically\nvalue-dependent, value-recognizing, and value-producing beings:\n\u201cwe see what a person is when we see which world of value she\nlives in\u201d (1922: 190[227]). Love, for example, is an\napprehension of the value of the loved person. Emotions have the\ngreatest effect on the inner form of the self (1931: 260[381]).\nEmotions reveal reality in its \u201ctotality and in its\npeculiarity\u201d (2000c: 87[96]). The person is in part constituted\nthrough emotions; a non-emotive person is, for Stein, an\nimpossibility. The emotions, furthermore, enable us to grasp other\npersons as value-beings (see also\n sect. 2.2\n and\n sect. 2.3).\n\nFollowing Husserl, Stein maintains that the person actualizes itself\nin his or her uniquely personal acts, either self-directed acts, such\nas making a firm decision, or expressing oneself creatively, or\nother-directed acts, such as promising, forgiving, that recognize\nother persons as persons). Spiritual acts are acts that persons\naddress to each other as persons (something found also in\nHusserl\u2019s Ideas II). The whole person, however, is not\nexhausted in any of these acts (1931: 260[381]), but they spring from\nthe person\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d. A person has a depth beyond his\nor her acts. Having \u201cdepth\u201d is characteristic of the human\nsoul (1931: 266[390]). The soul can receive something at the depth\nappropriate to it; it has \u201cdepth-reception\u201d\n(Tiefen-Aufnahme, Stein 1931: 255[391]).\n\nStein also maintains that human beings are \u201cbeings in the\nworld\u201d (2000c: 155[177]). Persons are integrated into both the\nmaterial and the immaterial, spiritual worlds (1931: 147[221]):\n\u201cThe being of human beings is a composite of body, soul, and\nspirit\u201d (1950/2006: 310[363]). Humans are necessarily embodied;\nthe soul is \u201cbound to matter\u201d (stoffgebunden;\n1950/2006: 321[377]). Human spirits exhibit\n\u201cbeing-tied-to-the-body\u201d (Leibgebundenheit;\n1950/2006: 333[392]). Following Aristotle, she maintains that the body\nreceives its vitality through the soul (2000c: 86[94]). For Stein, the\nsoul is the principle of formation, animateness, nutrition, and\nreproduction. The soul, furthermore, grows primarily from its\naffective nature; he soul is conditioned by the body, but the spirit\ncan also condition and curb the emotions. In humans, the spirit is\ndependent on the senses for its natural activity. \u201cThe soul\ncannot live without receiving\u201d (Stein 1950/2006: 318[373]).\nHuman persons as spirits are intentionally influenced and formed\n\u201cfrom above\u201d(i.e., from purely spiritual motivations) and\nalso \u201cfrom below\u201d (1950/2006: 310[364]), i.e., from bodily\ndrives. Spirit arises from a \u201cdark ground\u201d, an\n\u201cobscure depth\u201d (1950/2006: 310[364]).\n\nFor Stein, the soul is not static and complete but evolving and\ndeveloping (Stein 2000c: 85\u20136[94]), fulfilling its innate\ncapacities. It is a living \u201croot\u201d (Wurzel) whose\ninnate capacities have to be activated. The human being actualizes\nitself in the acts that come from its subjectivity. Ordinary daily\nexistence conditions the soul and the spirit (Stein 2000c: 89[98];\n1931: 261[383]). Humans can repress actions and shape them. Stein\nmaintains that the soul has its own inner \u201copenness\u201d\n(1931: 266[390]): openness to other subjects but also, following\nScheler in particular, openness to value. The soul, however,\nmust be open to values to receive them (1922: 193[230]). The soul is\nmore important than the pure ego: \n\n\nThe pure ego is, as it were, only the portal through which the life of\na human being passes on its way from the depth of the soul to the\nlucidity of consciousness. (1950/2006: 420[501])\n\n\nPersons are psychic wholes or totalities that must be approached as\nsuch. \u201cEvery I is unique\u201d (Jedes Ich ist\nEinmaliges, 1950/2006: 294[343]) with its own\n\u201cpeculiarity\u201d (Eigent\u00fcmlichkeit), that is\nincommunicable, even though it also has a \u201cquid\u201d\nthat it shares with other egos. Every human being has\n\u201cunrepeatable singularity\u201d (2000c: 161[182]). In the human\nego, there is a contrast between \u201cego-life\u201d and\n\u201cbeing\u201d (1950/2006 296[345]). The ego is\n\u201ctransparent\u201d (durchsichtig) to itself\n(1950/2006: 296[345]). For Stein, every person is an ego, but not\nevery ego is a person. A person must be aware of itself and there may\nbe egos (e.g., animal egos) that do not have this self-awareness and\ntransparency. In this regard, to be a person requires a degree of\ndeveloping self-awareness.\n\nStein maintained throughout her work that each human being has an\nindividual personal \u201ccore\u201d (Kern der Person, see\n1931: 122[183]; Pers\u00f6nlichkeitskern; 1922: 80[92]) that\nremains unchanged and that contains potentiality that can be\nactualized. For the personal core, Stein drew on Teresa of Avila\n(\u201ccastle of the soul\u201d, die Seelenburg, Stein\n1950/2006: 315[370]), John of the Cross, Max Scheler, and Hedwig\nConrad-Martius. The person \u201cunfolds\u201d or\n\u201cripens\u201d but the personal core is never completely\n\u201cdisclosed or disclosable\u201d (1931: 139[200]). This core is\ndirectly knowable only by God. We only actualize some of it in our\nfinite lives, but, in contrast to Heidegger, we actually are\nthis deeper core. Our being has a wholeness which our finite life does\nnot exhaust.\n\nThe person\u2019s character properties are its capacities for\napprehending values, and in them the core unfolds itself outwards\n(entfaltet sich in ihnen nach au\u00dfen; 1922: 193[231]).\nKindliness as a character trait doesn\u2019t just show itself in kind\nactions; a person can be kindly even if he doesn\u2019t get to do\nkind actions (1922: 193[231]). Not everything in the person comes from\nthe core. Some experiences are \u201cproper to the I\u201d\n(ichlich) whereas others are \u201cforeign to the I\u201d\n(ichfremd, 1931: 129[186]). Here Stein draws heavily from\nHusserl. There are emotional and other sentient traits that are\n\u201cindifferent\u201d to the core (1922:\n191\u201392[228\u201329]). External impressions do not penetrate\ndeeply into my soul and have little personal involvement (1931:\n128[185]). The same sound can slip by me, but if I am concentrating,\nit can disturb me and make me angry (1931: 130[187]). It penetrates my\nperson and affects me inwardly. There are \u201cdepths of the\nI\u201d (1931 129[186]; also discussed in Empathy (1917) and\nBeitr\u00e4ge (1922) (see\n sect. 2.1\n and\n sect. 2.2).\n People live at different depth dimensions (1931: 130[188]). The more\na person lives at depth, the more his or her core will unfold. Stein\ndistinguishes not just between \u201csurface\u201d and\n\u201cdepth\u201d of the self but also between center and periphery.\nI may be concentrating and open a window to get air but don\u2019t\nfully notice myself doing it. Penetrating things with understanding is\na work of depth and is an \u201cachievement of the will\u201d (1931:\n131[190]).\n\nStein appropriated the notion of \u201clife\u201d (Leben)\nfrom Husserl, Scheler, Dilthey, and Bergson. Development of the person\ncontinues through life but the person does not cease after death\n(1931: 140[202]). The person enters eternity \u201cas what s/he has\nbecome\u201d (was sie geworden ist; 1931: 135[195]). In our\ninnermost feeling of being alive we remain the same\u2014from child\nto adult to old age (1931: 2[21]).\n",
