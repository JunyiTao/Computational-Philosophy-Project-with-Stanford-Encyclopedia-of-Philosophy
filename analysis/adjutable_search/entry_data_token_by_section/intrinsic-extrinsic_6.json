    "main_text": "Notions of Intrinsicality || Interior vs. Exterior Properties\n2.3 Interior vs. Exterior Properties\n\nThe second characterisation listed in the quote by Lewis in section\n 1\n was \u201cA thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of the way\nthat thing itself, and nothing else, is\u201d. This\ncharacterisation can be stated more precisely by schema (4), where\n\u2018how \\(x\\) is intrinsically\u2019 abbreviates \u2018how \\(x\\)\nand its parts are and how they are related to each other, as opposed\nto how \\(x\\) and its parts are related to other things and how other\nthings are\u2019.\n\n\n(4)\n Being \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then\n\\(x\\) is \\(F\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically. \n\n\nCall the properties that are classified as intrinsic by (4)\ninterior properties, and call the properties that are\nclassified as non-intrinsic by (4) exterior properties. An\nimportant question is what meaning \u2018in virtue\u2019 is meant to\nhave in (4). One possible answer is that it is meant to have a reading\ncorresponding to metaphysical grounding, where metaphysical grounding\nis the relation that stands to metaphysical explanation as causation\nstands to causal explanation. Under such a reading of \u2018in\nvirtue\u2019, (5) is necessarily true.\n\n(5)\n \u2018\\(\\varphi\\)\nin virtue of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 is true iff the\nstate of affairs expressed by \\(\\phi\\) metaphysically grounds the\nstate of affairs expressed by \\(\\varphi\\). \n\n\nWhile it might be initially appealing to think that \u2018in\nvirtue\u2019 in (4) expresses metaphysical grounding, Marshall 2015\nhas given an argument that (4) fails to characterise a notion of\nintrinsicality when \u2018in virtue\u2019 has this reading. The\nargument relies on (6) being necessarily true and (7) being true on\nany notion of intrinsicality.\n\n(6)\n \u2018\\(\\varphi\\)\nin virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically\u2019 is true iff there is a\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) that expresses an obtaining state of affairs that is\nintrinsically about \\(x\\) such that \u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it\nbeing the case that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 is true. \n\n\n(7)\n It is possible for\nthere to be a sentence \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019, where \\(F\\)\nexpresses an intrinsic property and \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019\nexpresses a foundational fact in the sense of being a fact that is not\nmetaphysically grounded by any other fact. \n\n\nThe argument is the following. Suppose, for reductio, that (4)\ncharacterises a notion of intrinsicality when \u2018in virtue\u2019\nexpresses metaphysical grounding. It follows from this, and the\nnecessity of (5) and (6), that (8) is necessarily true.\n\n(8)\n Being \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then\nthere is an obtaining state of affairs \\(s\\) that is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\) such that \\(s\\) metaphysically grounds \\(x\\) being \\(F\\).\n\n\n\nBy (7), it is possible for a sentence \\(\\ulcorner a\\) is\n\\(F\\urcorner\\) to express a foundational fact, where \\(F\\) expresses\nan intrinsic property. Hence, it follows from (7) and the necessity of\n(8) that (9) is possibly true.\n\n(9)\n \\(a\\) being \\(F\\)\nis a foundational fact and there is an obtaining state of affairs\n\\(s\\) that is intrinsically about \\(a\\) such that \\(s\\) metaphysically\ngrounds \\(a\\) being \\(F\\). \n\n\nHowever, (9) is necessarily false, since foundational facts cannot be\nmetaphysically grounded by any facts. Hence, the assumption that (4)\ncharacterises a notion of intrinsicality when \u2018in virtue\u2019\nexpresses metaphysical grounding is false.\n\nGiven \u2018in virtue\u2019 doesn\u2019t express metaphysical\ngrounding in (4) on its intended use, what does it express? One\nattractive option is to think that \u2018in virtue\u2019 in (4) is\nmeant to be understood as having the same effect as \u2018is a matter\nof\u2019 and that, on this reading, it expresses the identity\nrelation. On this reading, \u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it being\nthe case that \\(\\psi\\)\u2019 is true iff the state of affairs\nexpressed by \\(\\phi\\) is identical to the state of affairs expressed\nby \\(\\varphi\\). Since it follows from (6) that, on this reading\n\u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically\u2019 is\ntrue iff there is a sentence \\(\\phi\\) that expresses an obtaining\nstate of affairs that is intrinsically about \\(x\\), (10) follows from\n(4) on this reading of \u2018in virtue\u2019.\n\n(10)\n Being \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then the\nstate of affairs of \\(x\\) being \\(F\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\).\n\n\n\nAn alternative option, which is investigated in Marshall 2016a, is to\nhold that \u2018in virtue\u2019 may express a number of different\nreflexive determination, or entailment, relations in (4), and that\neach of these relations determines a different notion of\nintrinsicality. In addition to identity, such entailment relations\nmight include metaphysical necessitation, nomic necessitation, and\nweak metaphysical grounding, where \\(p\\) weakly metaphysically grounds\n\\(q\\) iff either \\(p=q\\) or \\(p\\) metaphysically grounds \\(q\\). Given\nthese relations determine different notions of intrinsicality for each\nrelation \\(R\\), we may call the notion of interiority corresponding to\n\\(R\\) \u2018\\(R\\) interiority\u2019. So, for example, the notion of\nintrinsicality obtained from (4) by interpreting \u2018in\nvirtue\u2019 as expressing the identity relation might be called\nidentity interiority, while the notion of interiority obtained from\nmetaphysical necessitation might be called metaphysical necessitation\ninteriority, and the notion of interiority obtained from nomic\nnecessitation might be called nomic necessitation interiority. \n\nIf \u2018in virtue\u2019 expresses the relation \\(R\\), then\n\u2018\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019\nis true iff the state of affairs of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\nstands in \\(R\\) to the state of affairs of it being the case the\n\\(\\varphi\\). It follows from this, (4) and (6) that the \\(R\\) interior\nproperties satisfy (11).\n\n(11)\n Being \\(F\\) is\n\\(R\\) interior iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) then\nthere is an obtaining state of affairs \\(s\\) that is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\) such that \\(s\\) stands in \\(R\\) to the state of affairs of\nit being the case that \\(x\\) is \\(F\\). \n\n\nJust as being cubical is intuitively a local property, while being an\nuncle and being such that there is a number are intuitively non-local\nproperties, the former property is intuitively an identity interiority\nproperty, while the latter properties are both intuitively not\nidentity interior. (Those that claim that being such that there is a\nnumber is a local property, however, are likely to also claim that\nthis property is identity interior. See, for example, Sider (1993a),\nEddon (2011), Vallentyne (1997), Hoffman-Kolls (2014) and Francescotti\n(2014) for the relevant debate.) The identity interior properties,\nhowever, plausibly do not coincide with the local properties, since,\nwhile being identical to Obama is not a local property, it is\nplausibly an identity interior property. This is because, necessarily,\nfor any \\(x\\) that is identical to Obama, the state of affairs of\n\\(x\\) being identical to Obama is plausibly about how \\(x\\) and its\nparts are and how they are related to each other, as opposed to how\nthey are related to other things and how other things are.\n\nSince each identity interior property is also an \\(R\\) interior\nproperty, for each reflexive relation \\(R\\), the \\(R\\) interior\nproperties also do not coincide with the local properties for each\n\\(R\\). The \\(R\\) interior properties also differ from the identity\ninterior properties for at least some \\(R\\). For example, the\nmetaphysical necessitation interior properties plausibly differ from\nthe identity interior properties since, while being such that there is\na number is plausibly not identity interior, it is metaphysical\nnecessitation interior. This is because, given the assumption that\nnumbers necessarily exist, any \\(x\\) is such that how it is\nintrinsically necessitates that \\(x\\) is such that there is a\nnumber.\n",
