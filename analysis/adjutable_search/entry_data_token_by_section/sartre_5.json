    "main_text": "Being and Nothingness || The Look, shame and intersubjectivity\n4.3 The Look, shame and intersubjectivity\n\nSartre\u2019s work on inter-subjectivity is often the subject of\npremature dismissal. The hyperbolic dimension of his writings on the\nLook of the Other and the pessimism of his chapter on \u201cconcrete\nrelations with others\u201d, which is essentially a restatement of\nthe \u201cmaster-slave\u201d stage of Hegel\u2019s struggle for\nrecognition without the possibility of its overcoming, are sometimes\ntreated as if they were nothing but the product of a certain sort of\nmind\u2014a kind of adolescent paranoia or hysteria about the Other\n(see, e.g., Marcuse 1948). What this has meant, however, is that the\nsignificance of Sartre\u2019s work on inter-subjectivity, both within\nphenomenological circles and more broadly in regard to philosophy of\nmind and social cognition, has been downplayed. Building on the\ninsights of Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger, Sartre proposes a set of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for any theory of the other, which\nare far from trivial. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre\nsuggests that various philosophical positions\u2014realism and\nidealism, and beyond\u2014have been shipwrecked, often unawares, on\nwhat he calls the \u201creef of solipsism\u201d. His own solution to\nthe problem of other minds consists, first and foremost, in his\ndescriptions of being subject to the look of another, and the way in\nwhich in such an experience we become a \u201ctranscendence\ntranscended\u201d. On his famous description, we are asked to imagine\nthat we are peeping through a keyhole, pre-reflectively immersed and\nabsorbed in the scene on the other side of the door. Maybe we would be\nnervous engaging in such activities given the socio-cultural\nassociations of being a \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d, but after a period\nof time we would be given over to the scene with self-reflection and\nself-awareness limited to merely the minimal (tacit or\n\u201cnon-thetic\u201d in Sartre\u2019s language) understanding\nthat we are not what we are perceiving. Suddenly, though, we hear\nfootsteps, and we have an involuntary apprehension of ourselves as an\nobject in the eyes of another; a \u201cpre-moral\u201d experience of\nshame; a shudder of recognition that we are the object that the other\nsees, without room for any sort of inferential theorising or cognising\n(at least that is manifest to our own consciousness). This ontological\nshift, Sartre says, has another person as its condition,\nnotwithstanding whether or not one is in error on a particular\noccasion of such an experience (i.e., the floor creaks but there is\nno-one actually literally present). While many other phenomenological\naccounts emphasise empathy or direct perception of mental states (for\nexample, Scheler and Merleau-Ponty), Sartre thereby adds something\nsignificant and distinctive to these accounts that focus on our\nexperience of the other person as an object (albeit of a special kind)\nrather than as a subject. In common with other phenomenologists like\nMerleau-Ponty and Scheler, Sartre also maintains that it is a mistake\nto view our relations with the other as one characterised by a radical\nseparation that we can only bridge with inferential reasoning. Any\nargument by analogy, either to establish the existence of others in\ngeneral or to particular mental states like anger, is problematic,\nbegging the question and having insufficient warrant.\n\nFor Sartre, at least in his early work, our experience of being what\nhe calls a \u201cwe subject\u201d\u2014as a co-spectator in a\nlecture or concert for example, which involves no objectification of\nthe other people we are with\u2014is said to be merely a subjective\nand psychological phenomenon that does not ground our understanding\nand knowledge of others ontologically (Sartre 1943 [1956:\n413\u20135]). Originally, human relations are typified by dyadic mode\nof conflict best captured in the look of the other, and the sort of\nscenario concerning the key-hole we just considered above. Given that\nwe also do not grasp a plural look, for Sartre, this means that social\nlife is fundamentally an attempt to control the impact of the look\nupon us, either by anticipating it in advance and attempting to\ninvalidate that perspective (sadism) or by anticipating it and\nattempting to embrace that solicited perspective when it comes\n(masochism). In Sartre\u2019s words: \n\n\nIt is useless for human reality to seek to escape this dilemma: one\nmust either transcend the Other or allow oneself to be transcended by\nhim. The essence of the relations between consciousness is not the\nMitsein (being-with); it is conflict. (Sartre 1943 [1956:\n429])\n\n",
