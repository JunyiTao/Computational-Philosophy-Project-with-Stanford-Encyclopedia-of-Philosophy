    "main_text": "Language Acquisition || Linguistic nativism\n4.1 Linguistic nativism\n\nThe reader with prior acquaintance with the literature of linguistics\nwill notice that we have not made reference to any partitioning of\nlinguists into two camps called \u2018empiricists\u2019 and\n\u2018rationalists\u2019 (see e.g. Matthews 1984, Cowie 1999). We\ndraw a different distinction relating to the psychological and\nbiological prerequisites for first language acquisition. It divides\nnearly all Emergentists and Externalists from most Essentialists. It\nhas often been confused with the classical empiricist/rationalist\nissue.\n\nGeneral nativists maintain that the prerequisites for\nlanguage acquisition are just general cognitive abilities and\nresources. Linguistic nativists, by contrast, claim\nthat human infants have access to at least some specifically\nlinguistic information that is not learned from linguistic experience.\nTable 3 briefly sketches the differences between the two views.\n\n\n\n\ngeneral nativists\nlinguistic nativists \n\nLanguages are acquired mainly through the exercise of defeasible\ninductive methods, based on experience of linguistic\ncommunication\nLanguage cannot be acquired by defeasible inductive methods; its\nstructural principles must to a very large degree be unlearned\n\n\nThe unlearned capacities that underpin language acquisition\nconstitute a uniquely human complex of non-linguistic dispositions and\nmechanisms that also subserve other cognitive functions\nIn addition to various broadly language-relevant cognitive and\nperceptual capacities, language acquisition draws on an unlearned\nsystem of \u2018universal grammar\u2019 that constrains language\nform \n\nVarious non-human animal species may well have most or all of\nthe capacities that humans use for language acquisition\u2014though\nno non-human species seems to have the whole package, so interspecies\ndifferences are a matter of degree\nThere is a special component of the human mind which has the\ndevelopment of language as its key function, and no non-human species\nhas anything of the sort, so there is a difference in kind between the\nabilities of humans and other animals  \n\n\nTable 3: General and linguistic nativism\ncontrasted\n\n\nThere does not really seem to be anyone who is a complete\nnon-nativist: nobody really thinks that a creature with no unlearned\ncapacities at all could acquire a language. That was the point of the\nmuch-quoted remark by Quine (1972: 95\u201396) about how \u201cthe\nbehaviorist is knowingly and cheerfully up to his neck in innate\nmechanisms of learning-readiness\u201d. Geoffrey Sampson (2001, 2005)\nis about as extreme an opponent of linguistic nativism as one can\nfind, but even he would not take the failure of language acquisition\nin his cat to be unrelated to the cognitive and physical capabilities\nof cats.\n\nThe issue on which empirical research can and should be done is\nwhether some of the unlearned prerequisites that humans enjoy have\nspecifically linguistic content. For a philosophically-oriented\ndiscussion of the matter, see chapters 4\u20136 of Stainton (2006).\nFor extensive debate about \u201cthe argument from poverty of the\nstimulus\u201d, see Pullum and Scholz (2002) together with the six\ncritiques published in the same issue of The Linguistic\nReview and the responses to those critiques by Scholz and Pullum\n(2002).\n",
