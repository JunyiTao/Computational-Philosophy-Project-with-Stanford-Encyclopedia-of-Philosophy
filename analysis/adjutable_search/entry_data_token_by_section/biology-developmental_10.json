Model Organisms for the Study of Development\n\nModel organisms are central to contemporary biology and studies of\nembryogenesis (Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Steel 2008; Bier and McGinnis\n2003; Davis 2004). Biologists utilize only a small number of species\nto experimentally elucidate various properties of ontogeny (e.g.,\nC. elegans, Drosophila, and Brachydanio\n[zebrafish]; see\n Figure 5).\n These experimental models permit researchers to investigate\ndevelopment in great depth and facilitate a precise dissection of\ncausal relationships. Critics have questioned whether these models are\ngood representatives of other species because of inherent biases\ninvolved in their selection, such as rapid development and short\ngeneration time (Bolker 1995), and problematic presumptions about the\nconservation of gene functions and regulatory networks (Lynch 2009).\nFor example, C. elegans embryogenesis is not representative\nof nematodes in terms of pattern formation and cell specification\n(Schulze and Schierenberg 2011) and zebrafish appendage formation is a\npoor proxy for the development of appendages in tetrapods (Metscher\nand Ahlberg 1999).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Drosophila\nmelanogaster (the common fruit fly) is one of the standard model\norganisms used in developmental biology.\n\n\nOne response to this criticism is to emphasize the conserved genetic\nmechanisms shared by all animals despite differences in developmental\nphenomena (Gerhart and Kirschner 2007; Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Weber\n2005). Fruit flies may be unrepresentative in exhibiting syncytial\ndevelopment, but they use the collinear expression of Hox\ngenes to specify their anterior-posterior body axis. This response\nindicates that whether an entire model organism is representative\nper se is too coarse-grained a criterion to capture the\nrationale behind their use. We have to ask about representation\nwith respect to what, and some accounts have moved in this\ndirection. Jessica Bolker has distinguished exemplary and surrogate\nmodes of representation (Bolker 2009), where the former serve basic\nresearch by exemplifying a larger group and the latter correspond to\nmodels designed to provide indirect experimental access to otherwise\ninaccessible phenomena, such as mouse models of human psychological\ndisorders (e.g., depression). Surrogate models are adopted in\nbiomedical contexts where the phenomena of interest are manifested in\nhumans. Most developmental biologists consider model organisms as\nexemplars, not\n surrogates.[15]\n Thus, in order to respond to a criticism of non-representativeness,\nthe criterion of representation must be explored in more\n detail.[16]\n\nA basic presumption about model organisms is that they bear\nappropriate similarity relationships to larger groups of animals. This\npresumption is an instantiation of what is discussed generally for\n models in science\n meant to represent phenomena. Model organisms represent developmental\nphenomena in species that are either studied little or never studied\nat all: \u201cwe study flies and frogs as examples for the\ndevelopment of animals in general\u201d (N\u00fcsslein-Volhard 2006:\n87). One source of confidence in treating them as exemplars derives\nfrom an inductive inference over discovered patterns of evolutionary\nconservation with respect to developmental phenomena (e.g.,\ngastrulation or somite formation). If all or most model organisms\nshare a developmental feature, then all or most animals will share the\nfeature. This inference can be circumscribed more or less narrowly\n(e.g., if all or most vertebrate model organisms share somite\nformation, then all or most vertebrates will share it).\n\nAs a consequence of this confidence, the model organism\n(\u201csource\u201d) can represent these other unstudied species\n(\u201ctargets\u201d). This basic distinction between the model or\nsource and the phenomena or target it is supposed to represent is\nubiquitous in reasoning with model organisms (Ankeny and Leonelli\n2011). Zebrafish is a model or representation of vertebrate\ndevelopment, the target phenomena, because we expect to learn about\nvertebrate development generally by studying ontogeny in zebrafish\nspecifically. We do not invest time and resources into zebrafish as a\nmodel organism only because we are interested in zebrafish.\nResearchers plan to make claims about somite formation from\nobservations in zebrafish that will apply to somite formation in other\nvertebrates that we will never have the time or money to\ninvestigate.\n\nDevelopmental biologists often speak of investigating mechanisms that\naccount for phenomena in ontogeny (see\n Section 1.3),\n and focus on conserved genetic and cellular mechanisms in model\norganisms (Gerhart and Kirschner 2007; Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Weber\n2005). This suggests a distinction between representation with respect\nto developmental phenomena and representation with respect to genetic\nand cellular mechanisms operating in development. If we are interested\nin explaining how hearts (phenomena) develop, then we might\ninvestigate the molecular or cellular mechanisms occurring in\nthe heart field during zebrafish ontogeny. Some of these mechanisms\ncould be conserved even though the phenomena are not.\nDrosophila has only one cardiac cell type, no neural crest\ncells, and a heart with no atrial or ventricular chamber morphology\n(Kirby 1999). However, cardiogenesis in all invertebrates and\nvertebrates investigated thus far depends essentially on the\nexpression of the homeobox gene Nkx2-5/tinman\n(Gajewski and Schulz 2002). The reverse situation also can hold:\nsimilar phenomena may be manifested but genetic and cellular\nmechanisms might differ. Amphibians form a neural tube (neurulation)\nthrough a process of invagination (the folding of an epithelial\nsheet), whereas teleost fishes form a neural tube via cavitation (the\nhollowing out of a block of tissue via cell death). The neural tube is\nhomologous across vertebrates (i.e., a conserved phenomenon), but the\ncellular and genetic mechanisms involved in invagination versus\ncavitation are distinct (Davies 2013: ch. 4).\n\nThe distinction between phenomena and mechanisms assumes specificity;\ni.e., there are specific phenomena (somite formation in vertebrates)\nor mechanisms (collinear Hox gene expression) in view when\njudging the relationship between source (model) and target. But animal\ndevelopment consists of a multitude of different processes that\ninvolve a host of different mechanisms. Therefore, another distinction\noperating in the representational criterion pertains to questions of\nspecificity versus variety when selecting and using\nmodel organisms. A model might represent one type of target phenomena\n(differentiation or growth) or mechanism (cell signaling or cell\ncycling) but not others\u2014specificity\u2014or may do so better or\nworse with respect to particular types of phenomena or mechanisms. A\nmodel might represent several types of target phenomena and mechanisms\nsimultaneously\u2014variety\u2014with variability in how each type\nis represented. Trade-offs exist with respect to how well different\nphenomena or mechanisms are co-instantiated in a model organism. Note\nthat experimental organisms may be selected with respect to variety\nand specificity simultaneously, such as when a biologist working on a\nspecific phenomenon intends to work on others using the same model in\nthe future. They also may be selected with one or the other of these\ntwo aspects predominant. A model might be desirable if it has\nrepresentational variety in both mechanisms and phenomena even if it\nis not the best representative for every specific mechanism or\nphenomenon. Conversely, a model organism might be desirable if it is\nthe best representative for a specific mechanism despite being a very\npoor model for other phenomena or mechanisms. Variety is indicative of\nthe \u201cwhole organism\u201d being the\n model.[17]\n A further distinction can be introduced between \u201cmodel\norganisms\u201d and \u201cexperimental organisms\u201d (Ankeny and\nLeonelli 2011) or \u201cgeneral model organisms\u201d and\n\u201cKrogh-principle model organisms\u201d (Love 2010). General\nmodel organisms are selected and used with the variety aspect of the\nrepresentational criterion preeminent; experimental or Krogh-principle\nmodel organisms are selected and used with specificity preeminent.\n\nOther issues relevant to the representation criterion include how\nindividual cells or cell types serve as developmental models (Fagan\n2016), how developmental mechanisms in different model organisms are\ncompared and evaluated (Yoshida forthcoming), how the use of model\norganisms constitutes an example of case-based reasoning (Ankeny\n2012), and how model organisms involve idealizations or known\ndepartures from features present in the model\u2019s target as the\nresult of laboratory cultivation (Ankeny 2009;\n Section 5.2).\n Additionally, the question of representation is not the only one\ngermane to understanding model organism use. Because model organisms\nare utilized for experimental intervention, questions of\nrepresentation must be juxtaposed with questions of manipulation (see\nthe supplement on\n Model Organisms and Manipulation).\n",
