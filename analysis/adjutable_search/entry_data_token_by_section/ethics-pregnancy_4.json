    "main_text": "Ethical Issues in Obstetrical Care || The Fetus as Patient\n2.3 The Fetus as Patient\n\nMedical care for pregnant women generally impacts fetuses, whether by\ndesign or as a side effect. Likewise, direct attempts to provide\nmedical assistance to fetuses inevitably impact the women in whose\nbodies they reside. A recurring issue in obstetrical ethics concerns\nwhether and when the fetus should be conceptualized as a patient in\nits own right. Doing so has substantive and complex implications for\ndoctors, who have distinctive duties to their patients, as well as\nother possible legal and ethical consequences.\n\nIn several papers (the first published in 1996), Chervenak and\nMcCullough have argued that late-term, viable fetuses ought to be\nconceived of as patients who are owed beneficence and respect for\ntheir (future) autonomy. A pre-viable fetus, in their view, should\nbecome a patient if and only if the pregnant woman autonomously\nchooses to grant it such status. Once the fetus is a patient, they\nargue, the doctor has a duty to try to protect its well-being and\nbalance its needs against the needs of the pregnant woman. They point\nout that they are not committed to viewing fetuses as persons. The\nquestion of whether the fetus is a patient is distinct from (though in\nvarious ways intertwined with) the well-worn question of whether it is\na person. It is by no means obvious that only people can be patients,\nnor that all people become patients just by being impacted by a\nmedical procedure.\n\nNevertheless, many feminist bioethicists (i.e., Duden 1993, Lyerly and\nMahowald 2001) have been concerned that conceiving of the fetus as a\nseparate patient tends to imaginatively bolster the personification of\nthe fetus, as well as giving it a practical status that ought to be\nreserved for persons. Furthermore, understanding the fetus as a\npatient in its own right encourages conceiving of the mother and fetus\nas beings with entirely separate interests, which may then be in\nconflict as easily as aligned. While at times the interests of the\nwoman and the fetus may diverge, typically these interests are\ninextricably related, both because expectant mothers usually care\nintensely about fetal well-being, and because protecting the health of\nthe pregnant woman is typically the best way to protect the health of\nthe fetus (Mattingly 1992, Lyerly, Little and Faden 2008a).\n\nMaternal-fetal surgery to correct serious fetal anomalies such as\nsevere Spina Bifida is an experimental field of medicine. Until fairly\nrecently, such procedures were known as \u2018fetal\nsurgery\u2019\u2014a label that made it invisible that in all fetal\nsurgeries the pregnant woman underwent invasive surgery herself. Early\nassessments of \u2018fetal surgery\u2019 considered only the risks\nand potential benefits to fetuses, while the medical consequences for\nwomen were understudied and received short shrift in the informed\nconsent process (Lyerly and Mahowald 2001). At a 2000 conference on\n\u2018fetal surgery\u2019 at Vanderbilt University, Susan Wolf\nsuggested the switch to the term \u2018maternal-fetal surgery\u2019,\nand this terminology was adopted by the NIH, and by many\u2014though\nnot all\u2014practitioners and commentators (Ibid). Lyerly and\nMahowald argue that even the switch to conceiving the surgeries as\ninvolving two patients whose well-being must be weighed separately is\ninsufficient; rather, they think, we should understand maternal and\nfetal well-being and interests as tightly intertwined, and the woman\nas the sole patient. In both theory and practice, maternal-fetal\nsurgery raises a number of ethical issues we discuss in this article,\nincluding questions concerning pregnant women's autonomy, consent\nunder social pressure and in the shadow of powerful social values, and\nattitudes towards disability (Antiel 2016).\n",
