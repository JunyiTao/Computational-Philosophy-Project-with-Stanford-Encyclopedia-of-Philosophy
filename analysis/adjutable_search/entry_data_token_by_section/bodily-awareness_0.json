    "main_text": "The body from the inside\n1. The body from the inside\n\nThe body is a material entity located in space and time in the same\nway as a rock, a tree or a bird. But do we perceive and experience our\nbody like those other objects? Most philosophical interest for bodily\nawareness has come from its peculiarities. It is precisely because we\nassume that we are aware of our body differently from other objects\nthat it raises many questions. But what makes it unique? The most\nintuitive answer is that it bears a special relation to the self, and\nto self-awareness. As noted by O\u2019Shaughnessy (1980: vol. 1, p.\n138), \n\n\nNow there is every reason for expecting it to be a highly unusual\nrelation. For we are talking about the epistemological link\nbetween a man and in all probability himself qua material object! and\nin any case the one object in the universe that is his own body. Is\nnot that likely to be unusual? \n\n\nHowever, although introspectively familiar, it is hard to exactly\npinpoint the nature of the specific relation. One way to characterize\nit is to say that many bodies, including our own, can appear to us\nfrom the outside but only our own body appears to us from the\ninside. Most definitions of the inside mode then amount to little\nmore than list the internal ways of gaining knowledge about our body.\nHowever, it is not clear that they form a unified category. What they\nhave in common is that they seem to all guarantee that bodily\njudgments are immune to error through misidentification relative to\nthe first-person. But are body senses the only ones to guarantee\nbodily immunity and are bodily judgments still immune when the grounds\nof bodily awareness are multimodal?\n",
