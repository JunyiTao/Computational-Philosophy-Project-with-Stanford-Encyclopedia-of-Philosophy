    "main_text": "Explanation || Disorders as Statistical Networks\n3.2 Disorders as Statistical Networks\n\n\nOne way to start thinking about what we have to explain in\npsychiatry is to borrow from Thagard\u2019s (1999, 114\u20135) account of\ndiseases as networks of \u201cstatistically based causal\nrelations\u201d which are discovered using epidemiological and\nexperimental methods. This fits the picture that Kendler and Prescott\npresent for depression quite neatly (although their models are designed\nto incorporate both causal relations between variables and\ncorrelations). Thagard\u2019s causal-statistical networks, like\nKendler and Prescott\u2019s path models, provide \u201ca kind of\nnarrative explanation of why a person becomes sick\u201d (p15). They\nincorporate information about the typical course of a disease as it\nunfolds over time, including information about typical risk factors for\nthe disease\u2014such as the finding that heavy use of aspirin increases\nacid secretion which makes a duodenal ulcer more likely. The causal\nnetwork does not specify how each causal factor produces its effects,\nthough. It is really a descriptive model that lets us ask the question;\nwhat facts make it true that people get sick in these ways?\n\n\nIn effect we have a set of exception-prone generalizations about the\npathways a disorder takes: people in this situation are likely to\nbecome depressed unless such and such intervenes. And when they are\ndepressed they will probably have the following experiences, unless\nthey have these other ones. Thagard\u2019s idea of a narrative is\nhelpful here; path models represent typical stories about\ncharacteristic ways of getting sick. But a narrative by itself might\nnot explain anything; if it is explanatory, it is because earlier\nevents mentioned in the narrative pick out the causes of later\nevents.\n Rachel Cooper (2007) presents a way of thinking about psychiatric\nexplanation that fits well with the idea that a diagnosis lets us tell\na story. We often find ourselves with narratives that tell us how\nsomeone gets sick, and it might be that a useful narrative is one\nwhich isolates the temporally prior variables and lets us see how\nlater phenomena depend on them. One way to think about this is that a\ngood narrative is one that talks about a natural kind. If we have a\nnatural kind, with some causal structure underpinning it, the\nsystematic dependence of later states on earlier ones is easy to\ngrasp. Several theorists have defended a view of psychiatric disorders\nas natural kinds. Influential recent philosophical treatments have\nrejected the idea that mental disorders have essences, but have\ndefended the idea that mental disorder are natural kinds in\nBoyd\u2019s sense of homeostatic property clusters (Beebee and\nSabbarton-Leary 2010; Kendler et al. 2010; Parnas et al. 2010; Samuels\n2009, Zachar 2014, Pereira 2020), in which properties occur together\noften enough, and reliably enough, to support ampliative inferences,\neven if the mechanisms responsible for the kind do not make every\nmember of it the same as every other member. When inductive reasoning\nworks, thinks Boyd, it works because we have have latched onto these\nunderlying causal mechanisms that bring about the\nclustering. Successful inductions track the observable manifestations\nof the causal mechanisms responsible for the characteristics of the\nkind. The mechanisms, we might say, leave an identifiable causal\nsignature in the world.  The HPC account seems to suit mental\ndisorders. They often vary across cases, with characteristic symptoms\nsometimes absent even when the patient presents a typical cluster of\nsigns and symptoms. So it is understandable that theorists who are\nsympathetic to the medical model in psychiatry should be drawn to the\nhomeostatic property cluster idea.  \n",
