    "main_text": "History of the Concept of Scientific Revolution || Criteria for Identifying Scientific Revolutions\n2.3 Criteria for Identifying Scientific Revolutions\n\nI. B. Cohen (1985, chap. 2) lays down four historical tests, four\nnecessary conditions, for the correct attribution of a revolution.\nFirst, the scientists involved in the development must perceive\nthemselves as revolutionaries, and relevant contemporaries must agree\nthat a revolution is underway. Second, documentary histories must\ncount it as a revolution. Third, later historians and philosophers\nmust agree with this attribution and, fourth, so must later scientists\nworking in that field or its successors. By including both reports\nfrom the time of the alleged revolution and later historiographical\njudgments, Cohen excludes people who claimed in their day to be\nrevolutionaries but who had insufficient impact on the field to\nsustain the judgment of history. He also guards against whiggish, post\nhoc attributions of revolution to people who had no idea that they\nwere revolutionaries. His own four examples of big scientific\nrevolutions all have an institutional dimension: The Scientific\nRevolution featured the rise of scientific societies and journals, the\nsecond was the aforementioned revolution in measurement from roughly\n1800 to 1850 (which Kuhn, too, called \u201cthe second scientific\nrevolution\u201d; 1977, 220). Third is the rise of university\ngraduate research toward the end of that century. Fourth is the\npost-World War II explosion in government funding of science and its\ninstitutions. \n\nCohen sets the bar high. Given Copernicus\u2019 own conservatism and\nthe fact that few people paid attention to his work for half a\ncentury, the Copernican achievement was not a revolution by\nCohen\u2019s lights. Or if there was a revolution, should it not be\nattributed to Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes? This thought further\nproblematizes the notion of revolution, for science studies experts as\nwell as scientists themselves know that scientific and technological\ninnovation can be extremely nonlinear in the sense that a seemingly\nsmall, rather ordinary development may eventually open up an entire\nnew domain of research problems or a powerful new approach. Consider\nPlanck\u2019s semi-classical derivation of the empirical blackbody\nradiation law in 1900, which, under successively deeper theoretical\nderivations by himself and (mainly) others over the next two and a\nhalf decades, became a pillar of the revolutionary quantum theory. As\nKuhn (1978) shows, despite the flood of later attributions to Planck,\nit is surprisingly difficult, on historical and philosophical grounds,\nto justify the claim that he either was, or saw himself as, a\nrevolutionary in 1900 and for many years thereafter. (Kuhn 2000b\noffers a short summary.) Augustine Brannigan (1981) and Robert Olby\n(1985) defend similar claims about Mendel\u2019s alleged discovery of\nMendelian inheritance.\n\nThese examples suggest that Cohen\u2019s account of scientific\nrevolution (and Kuhn\u2019s) is tied too closely to the idea of\npolitical revolution in placing so much weight on the intentions of\nthe generators. In the last analysis, many would agree, revolution,\nlike speciation in biology, is a retrospective judgment, a judgment of\neventual consequences, not something that is always directly\nobservable as such in its initial phases, e.g., in the stated the\nintentions of its authors. On the other hand, a counterintuitive\nimplication of this consequentialist view of revolutions is that there\ncan be revolution without revolt (assuming that revolt is a deliberate\ncourse of action), revolutionary work without authors, so to speak, or\nat least revolutionary in eventual meaning despite the authors\u2019\nintentions. Then why not just speak of evolution rather than\nrevolution in such cases? For, as we know by analogy from evolutionary\nbiology, in the long run evolution can be equally transformative, even\nmoreso (see below).\n\nA related point is that, insofar as revolutions are highly nonlinear,\nit is difficult to ascribe to them any particular reason or cause;\nfor, as indicated, the triggering events can be quite ordinary work,\nwork that unexpectedly opens up new vistas for exploration. A small\ncause may have an enormous effect. To be sure, the state of the\nrelevant scientific system must be such that the events do function as\ntriggers, but we need not expect that such a system always be readily\nidentifiable as one in crisis in Kuhn\u2019s sense. Rather, the\nhighly nonlinear revolutionary developments can be regarded as\nstatistical fluctuations out of a \u201cnoisy\u201d background of\nordinary work. At any rate, on this view it is a mistake to think that\nexplaining revolutions requires locating a momentous breakthrough\n(Nickles 2012a and b).\n\nWhat of the common requirement that revolutions be rapid, event-like,\nunlike the century-and-a half-long Scientific Revolution? Brad Wray\n(2011, 42f) answers that there is no reason that a revolution need be\nan abrupt event. What is important is how thoroughgoing the change is\nand that it be change at the community level rather than a Gestalt\nswitch experienced by certain individuals. (After the original\npublication of Structure, Kuhn acknowledged his confusion in\nattributing Gestalt switches to the community as a whole as well as to\nindividuals.) On Wray\u2019s view, evolution and revolution are not\nnecessarily opposed categories. And with this understanding, the\nToulmin and Goodfield comment quoted above becomes compatible with\nrevolutionary transformation, which, not surprisingly, takes time to\nbecome thoroughgoing. Meanwhile, the Butterfield quotation suggests\nthat what counts as a striking change is a matter of historical scale.\nBy our lights today, 150 years is a long time; but, against the long\nsweep of total human history, a change of the magnitude of the\nScientific Revolution was quite rapid. Perhaps today\u2019s rapid\npace of scientific and technological innovation makes us impatient\nwith slower-scaled developments in the past. And it is surely the case\nthe some of the slow, large-scale transformations now underway are\nscarcely visible to us.\n\nFinally, what of Butterfield\u2019s criterion of broader social\nimpacts? Kuhn retained this criterion in The Copernican\nRevolution, but revolutions increasingly become changes in\nspecialist communities in his later work, since those communities\ninsulate themselves from the larger society. In the chapter on the\ninvisibility of revolutions in Structure, Kuhn tells us that\na tiny subspecialty can undergo a revolution that looks like a\ncumulative change even to neighboring fields of the same scientific\ndiscipline. In this respect Kuhn remained an internalist.\n",
