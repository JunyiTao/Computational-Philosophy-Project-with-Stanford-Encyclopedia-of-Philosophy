Conceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy and the Introduction of the Logical (Transformative) Conception\n\n\nIf anything characterizes \u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy, then it \nis presumably the emphasis placed on analysis. But as the foregoing \nsections have shown, there is a wide range of conceptions of \nanalysis, so such a characterization says nothing that would \ndistinguish analytic philosophy from much of what has either preceded\nor developed alongside it. Given that the decompositional conception \nis usually offered as the main conception today, it might be thought \nthat it is this that characterizes analytic philosophy. But this \nconception was prevalent in the early modern period, shared by both \nthe British Empiricists and Leibniz, for example. Given that Kant \ndenied the importance of decompositional analysis, however, it might \nbe suggested that what characterizes analytic philosophy is the \nvalue it places on such analysis. This might be true of \nMoore's early work, and of one strand within analytic \nphilosophy; but it is not generally true. What characterizes analytic\nphilosophy as it was founded by Frege and Russell is the role played \nby logical analysis, which depended on the development of \nmodern logic. Although other and subsequent forms of analysis, such \nas linguistic analysis, were less wedded to systems of formal logic, \nthe central insight motivating logical analysis remained.\n\n\nPappus's account of method in ancient Greek geometry suggests \nthat the regressive conception of analysis was dominant at the \ntime\u2014however much other conceptions may also have been \nimplicitly involved (see the supplementary section on \n Ancient Greek Geometry).\n In the early modern period, the decompositional conception became \nwidespread (see \n Section 4).\n What characterizes analytic philosophy\u2014or at least that central\nstrand that originates in the work of Frege and Russell\u2014is the \nrecognition of what was called earlier the transformative or\ninterpretive dimension of analysis (see \n Section 1.1).\n Any analysis presupposes a particular framework of interpretation, \nand work is done in interpreting what we are seeking to \nanalyze as part of the process of regression and decomposition. This \nmay involve transforming it in some way, in order for the \nresources of a given theory or conceptual framework to be brought to \nbear. Euclidean geometry provides a good illustration of this. But it\nis even more obvious in the case of analytic geometry, where the \ngeometrical problem is first \u2018translated\u2019 into the \nlanguage of algebra and arithmetic in order to solve it more easily \n(see the supplementary section on \n Descartes and Analytic Geometry).\n What Descartes and Fermat did for analytic geometry, Frege and \nRussell did for analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is \n\u2018analytic\u2019 much more in the sense that analytic geometry \nis \u2018analytic\u2019 than in the crude decompositional sense \nthat Kant understood it.\n\n\nThe interpretive dimension of modern philosophical analysis can also \nbe seen as anticipated in medieval scholasticism (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Medieval Philosophy),\n and it is remarkable just how much of modern concerns with \npropositions, meaning, reference, and so on, can be found in the \nmedieval literature. Interpretive analysis is also illustrated in the\nnineteenth century by Bentham's conception of \nparaphrasis, which he characterized as \u201cthat sort of \nexposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, \nhaving for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not \nfor its subject any other than a fictitious entity\u201d \n [Full Quotation].\n He applied the idea in \u2018analyzing away\u2019 talk of \n\u2018obligations\u2019, and the anticipation that we can see here \nof Russell's theory of descriptions has been noted by, among \nothers, Wisdom (1931) and Quine in \u2018Five Milestones of \nEmpiricism\u2019 \n [Quotation].\n \n\n\nWhat was crucial in the emergence of twentieth-century analytic \nphilosophy, however, was the development of quantificational theory, \nwhich provided a far more powerful interpretive system than anything \nthat had hitherto been available. In the case of Frege and Russell, \nthe system into which statements were \u2018translated\u2019 was \npredicate logic, and the divergence that was thereby opened up \nbetween grammatical and logical form meant that the process of \ntranslation itself became an issue of philosophical concern. This \ninduced greater self-consciousness about our use of language and its \npotential to mislead us, and inevitably raised semantic, \nepistemological and metaphysical questions about the relationships \nbetween language, logic, thought and reality which have been at the \ncore of analytic philosophy ever since.\n\n\nBoth Frege and Russell (after the latter's initial flirtation \nwith idealism) were concerned to show, against Kant, that arithmetic \nis a system of analytic and not synthetic truths. In the \nGrundlagen, Frege had offered a revised conception of \nanalyticity, which arguably endorses and generalizes Kant's \nlogical as opposed to phenomenological criterion, i.e., (ANL) rather than (ANO) (see the\nsupplementary section on \n Kant):\n \n(AN) A truth is analytic if its proof depends only\non general logical laws and definitions.\n\n\nThe question of whether arithmetical truths are analytic then comes \ndown to the question of whether they can be derived purely logically.\n(Here we already have \u2018transformation\u2019, at the \ntheoretical level\u2014involving a reinterpretation of the concept \nof analyticity.) To demonstrate this, Frege realized that he needed \nto develop logical theory in order to formalize mathematical \nstatements, which typically involve multiple generality (e.g., \n\u2018Every natural number has a successor\u2019, i.e. \u2018For \nevery natural number x there is another natural number \ny that is the successor of x\u2019). This \ndevelopment, by extending the use of function-argument analysis in \nmathematics to logic and providing a notation for quantification, was\nessentially the achievement of his first book, the \nBegriffsschrift (1879), where he not only created the first \nsystem of predicate logic but also, using it, succeeded in giving a \nlogical analysis of mathematical induction (see Frege FR, \n47-78).\n\n\nIn his second book, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (1884), \nFrege went on to provide a logical analysis of number statements. His\ncentral idea was that a number statement contains an assertion about \na concept. A statement such as \u2018Jupiter has four moons\u2019 \nis to be understood not as predicating of Jupiter the property of \nhaving four moons, but as predicating of the concept moon of \nJupiter the second-level property has four instances, \nwhich can be logically defined. The significance of this construal \ncan be brought out by considering negative existential statements \n(which are equivalent to number statements involving the number 0). \nTake the following negative existential statement:\n(0a) Unicorns do not exist.\n\n\nIf we attempt to analyze this decompositionally, taking its \ngrammatical form to mirror its logical form, then we find ourselves \nasking what these unicorns are that have the property of \nnon-existence. We may then be forced to posit the \nsubsistence\u2014as opposed to existence\u2014of \nunicorns, just as Meinong and the early Russell did, in order for \nthere to be something that is the subject of our statement. On the \nFregean account, however, to deny that something exists is to say \nthat the relevant concept has no instances: there is no need\nto posit any mysterious object. The Fregean analysis of (0a)\nconsists in rephrasing it into (0b), which can then be \nreadily formalized in the new logic as (0c):\n(0b) The concept unicorn is not instantiated. \n\n\n\n(0c) ~(\u2203x) Fx.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, to say that God exists is to say that the concept \nGod is (uniquely) instantiated, i.e., to deny that the \nconcept has 0 instances (or 2 or more instances). On this view, \nexistence is no longer seen as a (first-level) predicate, but \ninstead, existential statements are analyzed in terms of the \n(second-level) predicate is instantiated, represented by \nmeans of the existential quantifier. As Frege notes, this offers a \nneat diagnosis of what is wrong with the ontological argument, at \nleast in its traditional form (GL, \u00a753). All the \nproblems that arise if we try to apply decompositional analysis (at \nleast straight off) simply drop away, although an account is still \nneeded, of course, of concepts and quantifiers.\n\n\nThe possibilities that this strategy of \u2018translating\u2019 \ninto a logical language opens up are enormous: we are no longer \nforced to treat the surface grammatical form of a statement as a \nguide to its \u2018real\u2019 form, and are provided with a means \nof representing that form. This is the value of logical analysis: it \nallows us to \u2018analyze away\u2019 problematic linguistic \nexpressions and explain what it is \u2018really\u2019 going on. \nThis strategy was employed, most famously, in Russell's theory \nof descriptions, which was a major motivation behind the ideas of \nWittgenstein's Tractatus (see the supplementary \nsections on \n Russell\n and \n Wittgenstein).\n Although subsequent philosophers were to question the assumption that\nthere could ever be a definitive logical analysis of a given \nstatement, the idea that ordinary language may be systematically \nmisleading has remained.\n\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following examples from Ryle's\nclassic 1932 paper, \u2018Systematically Misleading \nExpressions\u2019:\n(Ua) Unpunctuality is reprehensible. \n\n\n\n(Ta) Jones hates the thought of going to hospital.\n\n\n\nIn each case, we might be tempted to make unnecessary reifications, \ntaking \u2018unpunctuality\u2019 and \u2018the thought of going to\nhospital\u2019 as referring to objects. It is because of this that \nRyle describes such expressions as \u2018systematically \nmisleading\u2019. (Ua) and (Ta) must therefore be rephrased:\n(Ub) Whoever is unpunctual deserves that other people\nshould reprove him for being unpunctual. \n\n\n\n(Tb) Jones feels distressed when he thinks of what he will undergo if\nhe goes to hospital.\n\n\n\nIn these formulations, there is no overt talk at all of \n\u2018unpunctuality\u2019 or \u2018thoughts\u2019, and hence \nnothing to tempt us to posit the existence of any corresponding \nentities. The problems that otherwise arise have thus been \n\u2018analyzed away\u2019.\n\n\nAt the time that Ryle wrote \u2018Systematically Misleading \nExpressions\u2019, he, too, assumed that every statement had an \nunderlying logical form that was to be exhibited in its \n\u2018correct\u2019 formulation \n [Quotations].\n But when he gave up this assumption (for reasons indicated in the \nsupplementary section on \n The Cambridge School of Analysis),\n he did not give up the motivating idea of logical analysis\u2014to \nshow what is wrong with misleading expressions. In The Concept of\nMind (1949), for example, he sought to explain what he called \nthe \u2018category-mistake\u2019 involved in talk of the mind as a \nkind of \u2018Ghost in the Machine\u2019. His aim, he wrote, was to\n\u201crectify the logical geography of the knowledge which we \nalready possess\u201d (1949, 9), an idea that was to lead to the \narticulation of connective rather than reductive \nconceptions of analysis, the emphasis being placed on elucidating the\nrelationships between concepts without assuming that there is a \nprivileged set of intrinsically basic concepts (see the supplementary\nsection on \n Oxford Linguistic Philosophy).\n \n\n\nWhat these various forms of logical analysis suggest, then, is that \nwhat characterizes analysis in analytic philosophy is something far \nricher than the mere \u2018decomposition\u2019 of a concept into \nits \u2018constituents\u2019. But this is not to say that the \ndecompositional conception of analysis plays no role at all. It can \nbe found in the early work of Moore, for example (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Moore).\n It might also be seen as reflected in the approach to the analysis of\nconcepts that seeks to specify the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for their correct employment. Conceptual analysis in this \nsense goes back to the Socrates of Plato's early dialogues (see\nthe supplementary section on \n Plato).\n But it arguably reached its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. As \nmentioned in \n Section 2\n above, the definition of \u2018knowledge\u2019 as \u2018justified \ntrue belief\u2019 is perhaps the most famous example; and this \ndefinition was criticised in Gettier's classic paper of 1963. \n(For details of this, see the entry in this Encyclopedia on \n The Analysis of Knowledge.)\n The specification of necessary and sufficient conditions may no \nlonger be seen as the primary aim of conceptual analysis, especially \nin the case of philosophical concepts such as \n\u2018knowledge\u2019, which are fiercely contested; but \nconsideration of such conditions remains a useful tool in the \nanalytic philosopher's toolbag.\n\n\nFor a more detailed account of the these and related conceptions of \nanalysis, see the supplementary document on\nConceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy.\n\n\nFor further reading, see the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a76.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nThe history of philosophy reveals a rich source of conceptions of \nanalysis. Their origin may lie in ancient Greek geometry, and to this\nextent the history of analytic methodologies might be seen as a \nseries of footnotes to Euclid. But analysis developed in different \nthough related ways in the two traditions stemming from Plato and \nAristotle, the former based on the search for definitions and the \nlatter on the idea of regression to first causes. The two poles \nrepresented in these traditions defined methodological space until \nwell into the early modern period, and in some sense is still \nreflected today. The creation of analytic geometry in the seventeenth\ncentury introduced a more reductive form of analysis, and an \nanalogous and even more powerful form was introduced around the turn \nof the twentieth century in the logical work of Frege and Russell. \nAlthough conceptual analysis, construed decompositionally from the \ntime of Leibniz and Kant, and mediated by the work of Moore, is often\nviewed as characteristic of analytic philosophy, logical analysis, \ntaken as involving translation into a logical system, is what \ninaugurated the analytic tradition. Analysis has also frequently been\nseen as reductive, but connective forms of analysis are no less \nimportant. Connective analysis, historically inflected, would seem to\nbe particularly appropriate, for example, in understanding analysis \nitself.",
