    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u2018contractualism\u2019 can be used in a broad\nsense\u2014to indicate the view that morality is based on contract or\nagreement\u2014or in a narrow sense\u2014to refer to a particular\nview developed in recent years by the Harvard philosopher T. M.\nScanlon, especially in his book What We Owe to Each Other.\nThis essay takes \u2018contractualism\u2019 in the narrower sense.\nWe begin with a brief summary of Scanlon\u2019s contractualism, and\nthen situate his view in relation both to other social contract\ntheories and to its main rival among impartial accounts of\nmorality\u2014namely, utilitarianism. Our discussion is then\norganised around a series of challenges to the contractualist\naccount.\n\nThere is already a huge literature surrounding Scanlon\u2019s\ncontractualism. Our aim is not to summarise that\nliterature\u2014still less to contribute anything novel to it.\nRather, we seek to explain the distinctive appeal of contractualism,\nas well as highlighting the challenges it faces from other\ntheories.\n",
