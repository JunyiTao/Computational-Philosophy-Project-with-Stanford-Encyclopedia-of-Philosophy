Major Works\n\nIn her recent study of Gersonides\u2019 science, Glasner notes that\nGersonides \u201cstands out as one of the more creative and daring\nfigures in the medieval west\u201d (Glasner 2015, p. 13). What\ndistinguished Gersonides from his predecessors was his reliance upon\nand consummate knowledge of mathematics, coupled with his belief in\nthe accuracy of observations achieved by the use of good instruments.\nBecause of this rootedness in empirical observation bolstered by\nmathematics, Gersonides believed that he had the tools to succeed\nwhere others had failed. Only when he has resolved the problems in\nastronomy does Gersonides apply their findings to theological\ncosmology. As we shall see, Gersonides\u2019 theology and astronomy\nare deeply involved with each other.\n\nThis realist stance is stated in the context of examining\nal-Bitruji\u2019s astronomical proposals. Gersonides\u2019\ncontention is that \u201cno argument can nullify the reality that is\nperceived by the senses, for true opinion must follow reality but\nreality need not conform to opinion\u201d (Goldstein 1974, p. 24).\nThat Gersonides clearly considered his own observations to be the\nultimate test of his system is explicit from his attitude towards\nPtolemy. The importance of empirical observation cannot be\nunderestimated, he claims, and he values his own observations over\nthose of others. \u201cWe did not find among our predecessors from\nPtolemy to the present day observations that are helpful for this\ninvestigation except our own\u201d (Wars, V.1.3, p. 27), he\nsays in describing his method of collecting astronomical data. Often\nhis observations do not agree with those of Ptolemy, and in those\ncases he tells us explicitly that he prefers his own. Gersonides lists\nthe many inaccuracies he has found trying to follow Ptolemy\u2019s\ncalculations. Having investigated the positions of the planets, for\nexample, Gersonides encountered \u201cconfusion and disorder\u201d\nwhich led him to deny several of Ptolemy\u2019s planetary principles\n(Goldstein 1988, p. 386). He does warn his colleagues, however, to\ndissent from Ptolemy only after great diligence and scrutiny. Both\nJohn Buridan and Gersonides took the first steps in the 14th century\ntoward a principle of inertia; in the words of Touati, Gersonides was\nthe first to \u201chave a presentiment of the principle of\ninertia\u201d (see Touati 1973, pp. 103, 311). Glasner supports\nTouati\u2019s contention, claiming that \u201cGersonides had a\nrudimentary, not yet correct, but insightful understanding of the\nconcept of inertial motion.\u201d Gersonides was aware of its\nsignificance and used it in order to lay the basis for a new physics,\nan alternative to that of Aristotle. (see Glasner 2015, p 36) He did\nnot rely on a theory of impetus [as did Buridan], which turned out to\nbe an advantage.\n\nGersonides\u2019 scientific works comprise mathematics and astronomy.\nHis Sefer Ma\u2019aseh Hoshev (The Work of a\nCounter, 1321) is concerned with arithmetical operations and uses\nof a symbolic notation for numerical variables. Gersonides\u2019\nmajor scientific contributions were in astronomy; his works were known\nby his contemporaries and influenced later astronomers. His\nastronomical writings are contained primarily in book 5, part 1 of\nMilhamot Ha-Shem. In 136 chapters Gersonides reviews and\ncriticizes astronomical theories of the day, compiles astronomical\ntables, and describes one of his astronomical inventions. This\ninstrument, which he called Megalle \u2018amuqqot\n(Revealer of Profundities) and which was called Bacullus\nJacobi (Jacob\u2019s staff) by his Christian\ncontemporaries, was used to measure the heights of stars above the\nhorizon. The astronomical parts of Milhamot Ha-Shem were\ntranslated into Latin during Gersonides\u2019 lifetime. One of the\ncraters of the moon, Rabbi Levi, is named after him.\n\nGersonides was well known as a Halakhist, one who deals with the\nintricacies of Jewish law. From this respect, his greatest\ncontribution to Judaica was in the area of biblical commentary. His\ncommentary on the Book of Job, completed in 1325, proved to be one of\nhis most popular works and was one of the earliest Hebrew books to be\npublished (in Ferrara, 1477). The commentary, which complements book 4\nof Milhamot Ha-Shem, is concerned with the problem of divine\nprovidence. Each of the characters in the Book of Job represents a\ndifferent theory of divine providence; Gersonides\u2019 own position\nis a restatement of Elihu\u2019s theory that providence is not\ndirected to particulars but rather to groups of individuals, or\nuniversals.\n\nGersonides also wrote a logical treatise, Sefer Ha-heqesh\nHa-yashar (On Valid Syllogisms, 1319), in which he\nexamines problems associated with Aristotle\u2019s modal logic as\ndeveloped in the Prior Analytics. This treatise was translated into\nLatin at an early date, although Gersonides\u2019 name was not\nattached to it.\n\nGersonides\u2019 major philosophical work, Milhamot Ha-Shem,\nwas completed in 1329; it had been twelve years in the making. In 1317\nGersonides began an essay on the problem of creation. This problem,\nwhich has vexed Jewish philosophers since Philo Judaeus, had recently\nreceived elaborate treatment by Maimonides. Gersonides was\ndissatisfied with Maimonides\u2019 discussion and proposed to reopen\nthe issue. This project was soon laid aside, however, for he felt that\nit could not be adequately discussed without proper grounding in the\nissues of time, motion, and the infinite. By 1325 his manuscript had\ndeveloped to include discussion not only of creation but also of\nimmortality, divination, and prophecy. By 1328 it included a chapter\non providence as well. Books 5 and 6 were completed, by\nGersonides\u2019 own dating, by 1329.\n\nAs Isaac Husik has pointed out, Gersonides \u201chas no use for\nrhetorical flourishes and figures of speech \u2026 the effect upon\nthe reader is monotonous and wearisome.\u201d His style has been\ncompared to that of Thomas Aquinas and even of Aristotle in its use of\na precise, technical vocabulary which eschews examples. In\ncontradistinction to Maimonides, who introduced allegory, metaphor,\nand imprecise language into his work to convey the ambiguity of the\nsubject matter, Gersonides saw it as his function to elucidate the\nissues as clearly as possible. Gersonides is the first Jewish\nphilosopher to use this analytic, scholastic method.\n",
