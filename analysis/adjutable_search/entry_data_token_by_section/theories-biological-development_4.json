    "main_text": "Evolution and Embryos: A New Preformationism\n5. Evolution and Embryos: A New Preformationism\n\nIn 1859, Darwin focused on embryos and their usefulness for\nunderstanding evolutionary relationships. Ernst Haeckel brought the\nstudy of embryos to popular attention. And histologists and\nembryologists, especially in Germany and the United States, used\nrapidly improving microscopic techniques to observe far more than had\nbeen possible before. These observations, in the context of\nevolutionary interpretations, raised new questions and provoked new\nanswers. The understanding of both epigenesis and preformation\nunderwent transformation so that the debates brought new questions\nalong with the traditional differences.\n\nDarwin pointed to embryology as fundamental for interpreting\nhistorical relationships. In Chapter 13 of the Origin he\nasked\n\n\nHow, then, can we explain these several facts in\nembryology,\u2014namely the very general, but not universal\ndifference in structure between the embryo and the adult;\u2014of\nparts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very\nunlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early period of\ngrowth alike;\u2014of embryos of different species within the same\nclass, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;\u2014of\nthe structure of the embryo not being closely related to its\nconditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period\nof life active and has to provide for itself;\u2014of the embryo\napparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature\nanimal, into which it is developed. (1859: 442\u2013443)\n\n\nBut we know that this was a rhetorical question, and sure enough he\nconcluded that\n\n\nI believe that all these facts can be explained, as follows, on the\nview of descent with modification. (1859: 443)\n\n\nAnd that furthermore,\n\n\nthe leading facts in embryology, which are second in importance to\nnone in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight\nmodifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some one\nancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though\nperhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding\nnot early period. Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus\nlook at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common\nparent-form of each great class of animals. (Darwin 1859: 450)\n\n\nHaeckel saw ontogeny as the brief and rapid recapitulation of\nphylogeny and saw each individual\u2019s development as following the\nsequence of, and indeed caused by, the evolutionary history of that\nindividual organism\u2019s species. In his highly popular books,\nwidely translated and widely read, Haeckel offered pictures of\ncomparative embryology. See, he seemed to suggest, the human form\nemerges following the evolutionary development and adaptations of its\nancestors. Form comes from form of the ancestors, and it unfolds\nfollowing pre-scripted stages (Haeckel 1866).\n\nDarwin was not an embryologist, and he did not contribute to our\nunderstanding of embryogenesis as such. Nor did Haeckel, really. But\nwhile Darwin\u2019s use of the embryo in supporting evolutionary\ntheory and in helping to interpret evolutionary relationships was\nconsistent with various versions of either epigenetic or\npreformationist development, Haeckel\u2019s view was decidedly\npreformationist. Here, then, was a preformationist interpretation\nbased not on additional embryological observations but on adherence to\nHaeckel\u2019s own metaphysical view\u2014monistic\nmaterialism\u2014and to his desire to provide evidence for evolution.\nThe Haeckelian approach reflected the context in which those studying\ncells and embryos worked at the end of the nineteenth century.\n",
