    "main_text": "Computability Theory\n3. Computability Theory\n\nComputability Theory is a subfield of contemporary mathematical logic\ndevoted to the classification of functions and sets of natural numbers\nin terms of their absolute and relative computability and\ndefinability-theoretic properties. This subject is closely related in\nboth origin and content to the study of recursive functions. This is\nreflected by the fact that computability theory was known as\nrecursive function theory (or simply recursion\ntheory) from the time of its inception in the 1930s until the\nlate 1990s. It is also reflected in the formulation and proof of the\nso-called Recursion Theorem which provides a fundamental link\nbetween recursive definability and the sort of self-referential\nconstructions which are at the core of many methods in computability\ntheory (see\n Section 3.4).\n\nFor reasons discussed in\n Section 1.7,\n contemporary expositions of computability theory are often presented\nin an abstract manner which seeks to minimize reference to the\nspecific features of a model of computation such as the partial\nrecursive functions. It is thus useful to stress the following\nmodifications to the traditional terminology which has been employed\nin\n Sections 1 and 2\n and the more contemporary terminology which will be employed in this\nsection:\n\n\n\nThe expressions computable function and\npartial computable function will be used\ninstead of the traditional terms recursive\nfunction and partial recursive\nfunction as defined in\n Section 2.2.1.\n\n\nThe expression computable set will be used\ninstead of the traditional term recursive\nset. Similarly, computably\nenumerable (or c.e.) set will\nbe used instead of the traditional term recursively\nenumerable (or r.e.) set (see\n Section 3.3).\n\n\nThe other notational conventions introduced at the beginnings of\n Section 2.1\n and\n Section 2.2\n will be retained in this section.\n",
