As already pointed out, first,\nWeber viewed it as a process taking place in disparate fields of human\nlife with a logic of each field\u2019s own and varying directions;\n\u201ceach one of these fields may be rationalized in terms of very\ndifferent ultimate values and ends, and what is rational from one\npoint of view may well be irrational from another\u201d [Weber\n1920/1992, 27]. Second, and more important, its ethical ramification\nfor Weber is deeply ambivalent. To use his own dichotomy, the\nformal-procedural rationality (Zweckrationalit\u00e4t) to\nwhich Western rationalization tends does not necessarily go with a\nsubstantive-value rationality (Wertrationalit\u00e4t). On the\none hand, exact calculability and predictability in the social\nenvironment that formal rationalization has brought about dramatically\nenhances individual freedom by helping individuals understand and\nnavigate through the complex web of practice and institutions in order\nto realize the ends of their own choice. On the other hand, freedom\nand agency are seriously curtailed by the same force in history when\nindividuals are reduced to a \u201ccog in a machine,\u201d or\ntrapped in an \u201ciron cage\u201d that formal rationalization has\nspawned with irresistible efficiency and at the expense of substantive\nrationality. Thus, his famous lament in the Protestant\nEthic:\n\nNo one knows who will live in this cage (Geh\u00e4use) in the\nfuture, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely\nnew prophets will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas\nand ideals, or, if neither, mechanized petrification, embellished with\na sort of convulsive self-importance. For the \u201clast man\u201d\n(letzten Menschen) of this cultural development, it might\nwell be truly said: \u201cSpecialist without spirit, sensualist\nwithout heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of\nhumanity (Menschentums) never before achieved\u201d [Weber\n1904\u201305/1992, 182: translation altered].\n\n\nThird, Weber envisions the future of rationalization not only in terms\nof \u201cmechanized petrification,\u201d but also of a chaotic, even\natrophic, inundation of subjective values. In other words, the\nbureaucratic \u201ciron cage\u201d is only one side of the modernity\nthat rationalization has brought about; the other is a\n\u201cpolytheism\u201d of value-fragmentation. At the apex of\nrationalization, we moderns have suddenly found ourselves living\n\u201cas did the ancients when their world was not yet disenchanted\nof its gods and demons\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 148]. Modern society\nis, Weber seems to say, once again enchanted as a result of\ndisenchantment. How did this happen and with what consequences?\n",
