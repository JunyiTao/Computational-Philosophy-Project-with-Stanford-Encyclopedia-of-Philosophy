    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n2. Metaphysics\n\n\nWeyl was first and foremost a mathematician, and certainly not a \n\u201cprofessional\u201d philosopher. But as a German intellectual \nof his time it was natural for him to regard philosophy as a pursuit \nto be taken seriously. In Weyl\u2019s case, unusually even for a German \nmathematician, it was idealist philosophy that from the beginning \nplayed a significant role in his thought. Kant, Husserl, Fichte, and,\nlater, Leibniz, were at various stages major influences on Weyl\u2019s \nphilosophical thinking. As a schoolboy Weyl had been impressed by \nKant\u2019s \u201cCritique of Pure Reason.\u201d He was especially taken\nwith Kant\u2019s doctrine that space and time are not inherent in the \nobjects of the world, existing as such and independently of our \nawareness, but are, rather, forms of our intuition As he reports in \nInsight and Reflection, (Weyl 1955), his youthful enthusiasm for Kant\ncrumbled soon after he entered G\u00f6ttingen University in 1904. \nThere he read Hilbert\u2019s Foundations of Geometry, a tour-de-force of \nthe axiomatic method, in comparison to which Kant\u2019s \u201cbondage to\nEuclidean geometry\u201d now appeared to him na\u00efve. After this \nphilosophical reverse he lapsed into an indifferent positivism for a \nwhile. But in 1912 he found a new and exciting source of \nphilosophical enlightenment in Husserl\u2019s \n phenomenology.[1]\n It was also at about this time that Fichte\u2019s metaphysical idealism \ncame to \u201ccapture his imagination.\u201d Although Weyl later \nquestioned idealist philosophy, and became dissatisfied with \nphenomenology, he remained faithful throughout his life to the \nprimacy of intuition that he had first learned from Kant, and to the \nirreducibility of individual consciousness that had been confirmed in\nhis view by Fichte and Husserl.\n\n\nWeyl never provided a systematic account of his philosophical views,\nand sorting out his overall philosophical position is no easy matter.\nDespite the importance of intuition and individual consciousness in\nWeyl\u2019s philosophical outlook, it would nevertheless be inexact to\ndescribe his outlook as being that of a \u201cpure\u201d idealist,\nsince certain \u201crealist\u201d touches seem also to be present,\nin his approach to physics, at least. His metaphysics appears to rest\non three elements, the first two of which may be considered\n\u201cidealist\u201d, and the third \u201crealist\u201d: these\nare, respectively, the Ego or \u201cI\u201d, the (Conscious) Other\nor \u201cThou\u201d, and the external or \u201cobjective\u201d\nworld. \n\n\nIt is the first of these constituents, the Ego, to which Weyl \nascribes primacy. Indeed, in Weyl\u2019s words,\n\n\nThe world exists only as met with by an ego, as one appearing to\na consciousness; the consciousness in this function does not\nbelong to the world, but stands out against the being as the \nsphere of vision, of meaning, of image, or however else one may call\nit. (Weyl 1934, 1)\n\n\nThe Ego alone has direct access to the given, that is, to the raw \nmaterials of the existent which are presented to consciousness with \nan immediacy at once inescapable and irreducible. The Ego is singular\nin that, from its own standpoint, it is unique. But in an act of \nself-reflection, through grasping (in Weyl\u2019s words) \u201cwhat I am \nfor myself\u201d, the Ego comes to recognize that it has a \nfunction, namely as \u201cconscious-existing carrier of the\nworld of phenomena.\u201d It is then but a short step for the Ego to\ntranscend its singularity through the act of defining an \n\u201cego\u201d to be an entity performing that same function \nfor itself. That is, an ego is precisely what I am for \nmyself (in other words, what the Ego is for itself)\u2014again a \n\u201cconscious-existing carrier of the world of \nphenomena\u201d\u2014and yet other than myself. \n\u201cThou\u201d is the term the Ego uses to address, and so to \nidentify, an ego in this sense. \u201cThou\u201d is thus the Ego \ngeneralized, the Ego refracted through itself. The Ego grasps that it\nexists within a world of Thous, that is, within a world of other Egos\nsimilar to itself. While the Ego has, of necessity, no direct access \nto any Thou, it can, through analogy and empathy, grasp what it is to\nbe Thou, a conscious being like oneself. By that very fact the Ego \nrecognizes in the Thou the same luminosity it sees in itself.\n\n\nThe relationship of the Ego with the external world, the realm of \n\u201cobjective\u201d reality, is of an entirely different nature. \nThere is no analogy that the Ego can draw\u2014as it can with the \nThou\u2014between itself and the external world, since that world \n(presumably) lacks consciousness. The external world is radically \nother, and opaque to the \n Ego[2].\n Like Kant\u2019s noumenal realm, the external world is outside the \nimmediacy of consciousness; it is, in a word, transcendent. \nSince this transcendent world is not directly accessible to the Ego, \nas far as the latter is concerned the existence of that world must \narise through postulation, \u201ca matter of metaphysics, \nnot a judgment but an act of acknowledgment or \n belief.\u201d[3]\n Indeed, according to Weyl, it is not strictly necessary for the Ego \nto postulate the existence of such a world, even given the existence \nof a world of Thous:\n\n\nFor as long as I do not proceed beyond what is given, or, more \nexactly, what is given at the moment, there is no need for the \nsubstructure of an objective world. Even if I include memory and in \nprinciple acknowledge it as valid testimony, if I furthermore accept \nas data the contents of the consciousness of others on equal terms \nwith my own, thus opening myself to the mystery of intersubjective \ncommunication, I would still not have to proceed as we actually do, \nbut might ask instead for the \u2018transformations\u2019 which \nmediate between the images of the several consciousnesses. Such a \npresentation would fit in with Leibniz\u2019s monadology. (Weyl 1949, \n117.)\n\n\nBut once the existence of the transcendent world is postulated, its \nopacity to the Ego can be partly overcome by constructing a \nrepresentation of it through the use of symbols, the \nprocedure called by Weyl symbolic construction, (or \nconstructive \n cognition)[4]\n and which he regarded as the cornerstone of scientific explanation. \nHe outlines the process as follows (Weyl 1934, 53):\n\n Upon that which is given, certain reactions are performed by\nwhich the given is in general brought together with other elements\ncapable of being varied arbitrarily. If the results to be read from\nthese reactions are found to be independent of the variable auxiliary\nelements they are then introduced as attributes inherent in the things\nthemselves (even if we do not actually perform those reactions on\nwhich their meaning rests, but only believe in the possibility of\ntheir being performed).\nBy the introduction of symbols, the judgements are split up and a\npart of the manipulations is made independent of the given and its\nduration by being shifted onto the representing symbols which are time\nresisting and simultaneously serve the purpose of preservation and\ncommunication. Thereby the unrestricted handling of notions arises in\ncounterpoint to their application, ideas in a relatively independent\nmanner confront reality.\nSymbols are not produced simply \u201caccording to demand\u201d\nwherever they correspond to actual occurrences, but they are embedded\ninto an ordered manifold of possibilities created by free construction\nand open towards infinity. Only in this way may we contrive to predict\nthe future, for the future is not given actually.\n\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s procedure thus amounts to the following. In step 1, a given \nconfiguration is subjected to variation. One then identifies those \nfeatures of the configuration that remain unchanged under the \nvariation\u2014the invariant features; these are in turn, \nthrough a process of reification, deemed to be properties of an \nunchanging substrate\u2014the \u201cthings themselves\u201d. It is\nprecisely the invariance of such features that renders them (as well \nas the \u201cthings themselves\u201d) capable of being represented \nby the \u201ctime resisting\u201d symbols Weyl introduces in step \n2. As (written) symbols these are communicable without temporal \ndistortion and can be subjected to unrestricted manipulation without \ndegradation. It is the flexibility conferred thereby which enables \nthe use of symbols to be conformable with reality. Nevertheless (step\n3) symbols are not haphazardly created in response to immediate \nstimuli; they are introduced, rather, in a structured, yet freely \nchosen manner which reflects the idea of an underlying \norder\u2014the \u201cone real world\u201d\u2014about which not \neverything is, or can be, known\u2014it is, like the future, \n\u201copen towards infinity\u201d. Weyl observes that the \nreification implicit in the procedure of symbolic construction leads \ninevitably to its iteration, for \u201cthe transition from step to \nstep is made necessary by the fact that the objects at one step \nreveal themselves as manifestations of a higher reality, the reality \nof the next step\u201d (Weyl (1934), 32\u201333). But in the end \n\u201csystematic scientific explanation will finally reverse the \norder: first it will erect its symbolical world by itself, without \nany reference, then, skipping all intermediate steps, try to describe\nwhich symbolical configurations lead to which data of \nconsciousness\u201d (ibid.). In this way the symbolic world\nbecomes (mistakenly) identified with the transcendent world.\n\n\nIt is symbolic construction which, in Weyl\u2019s vision, allows us access\nto the \u201cobjective\u201d world presumed to underpin our \nimmediate perceptions; indeed, Weyl holds that the objective world, \nbeing beyond the grasp (the \u201clighted circle\u201d) of \nintuition, can only be presented to us in symbolic \n form[5].\n We can see a double dependence on the Ego in Weyl\u2019s idea of symbolic \nconstruction to get hold of an objective world beyond the mental. For\nnot only is that world \u201cconstructed\u201d by the Ego, but the \nmaterials of construction, the symbols themselves, as signs intended \nto convey meaning, have no independent existence beyond their \ngraspability by a consciousness. By their very nature these symbols \ncannot point directly to an external world (even given an unshakable \nbelief in the existence of that world) lying beyond consciousness. \nWeyl\u2019s metaphysical triad thus reduces to what might be called a \npolarized dualism, with the mental (I, Thou) as the primary,\nindependent pole and objective reality as a secondary, dependent \n pole[6].\n \n\n\n\nIn Weyl\u2019s view mathematics simply lies \u2013 as it did for Brouwer\n\u2013 within the Ego\u2019s \u201clighted circle of intuition\u201d and\nso is, in principle at least, completely presentable to that\nintuition. But the nature of physics is more complicated. To the\nextent that physics is linked to the transcendent world of objective\nreality, it cannot arise as the direct object of intuition, but must,\nlike the transcendent world itself, be presented in symbolic form;\nmore exactly, as the result of a process of symbolic construction. It\nis this which, in Weyl\u2019s vision, allows us access to to the\n\"objective\" world presumed to underpin our immediate perceptions. \n\n\nWeyl\u2019s conviction that the objective world can only be presented to us\nthrough symbolic construction may serve to explain his apparently\nuntroubled attitude towards the highly counterintuitive nature of\nquantum theory. Indeed, the claims of numerous physicists that the\nquantum microworld is accessible to us only through abstract\nmathematical description provides a vindication of Weyl\u2019s thesis that\nobjective reality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the\nmediation of symbols. \nIn his later years Weyl attempted to enlarge his metaphysical triad \n(I, Thou, objective world) to a tetrad, by a process of completion, \nas it were, to embrace the \u201cgodhead that lives in impenetrable \nsilence\u201d, the objective counterpart of the Ego, which had been \nsuggested to him by his study of Eckhart. But this effort was to remain\nuncompleted.\n\n\n\n\nDuring his long philosophical voyage Weyl stopped at a number of \nports of call: in his youth, Kantianism and positivism; then \nHusserlian phenomenological idealism; later Brouwerian intuitionism \nand finally a kind of theological existentialism. But apart from his \nbrief flirtation with positivism (itself, as he says, the result of a\ndisenchantment with Kant\u2019s \u201cbondage to Euclidean \ngeometry\u201d), Weyl\u2019s philosophical orientation remained in its \nessence idealist (even granting the significant realist elements \nmentioned above). Nevertheless, while he continued to acknowledge the\nimportance of phenomenology, his remarks in Insight and \nReflection indicate that he came to regard Husserl\u2019s doctrine as\nlacking in two essential respects: first, it failed to give due \nrecognition to the (construction of) transcendent external world, \nwith which Weyl, in his capacity as a natural scientist, was \nconcerned; secondly, and perhaps in Weyl\u2019s view even more seriously, \nit failed to engage with the enigma of selfhood: the fact that I am \nthe person I am. Grappling with the first problem led Weyl to \nidentify symbolic construction as providing sole access to objective \nreality, a position which brought him close to Cassirer in certain \nrespects; while the second problem seems to have led him to \nexistentialism and even, through his reading of Eckhart, to a kind of\nreligious mysticism.\n",
