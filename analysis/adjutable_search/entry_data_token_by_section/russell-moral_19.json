    "main_text": "Objections to Objectivism || Russell and Explanatory Impotence\n9.3 Russell and Explanatory Impotence\n\nIn his polemical article \u201cNorth Staffs\u2019 Praise of War\u201d\n(1916) Russell suggests an argument which prefigures a famous argument\nof Gilbert Harman\u2019s 1977. (It is typical of Russell, incidentally,\nthat he develops his meta-ethical position in the course of a\nnewspaper controversy about the rights and wrongs of World War I\nrather than in an article in an academic journal.)\n\n\nI have been led to [the view that all ethics is subjective] by a\nnumber of reasons, some logical, some derived from observation.\nOccam\u2019s Razor \u2026 leads me to discard the notion of absolute good\nif ethics can be accounted for without it. Observation of ethical\nvaluations leads me to think that all ethical valuations can be so\naccounted for, and that the claim of universality which men associate\nwith their ethical judgments embodies merely the impulse to\npersecution or tyranny. (RoE: 117/Papers 13:\n325\u20136)\n\n\nThe idea seems to be that our moral evaluations\u2014our beliefs\nabout what is good or bad, wrong or right\u2014can be explained\nwithout supposing that they correspond to facts involving Moorean\nproperties of \u201cabsolute\u201d goodness or badness. And since\nour evaluations can be accounted for without supposing that there are\nany such properties, and since the only reason for we believing in\nthem is the evidence of our evaluations, we have no reason to suppose\nthat such properties exist, and some reasons (of an Occamist sort) for\nsupposing that they do not.\n\nAs it stands, this argument is inconclusive. For a Moorean might\nsimply hang tough, insisting that his own views about goodness are\nbest explained by close encounters of the Platonic kind, involving an\nintimate acquaintance with both goodness itself and the properties on\nwhich it supervenes. Of course, it is difficult to make naturalistic\nsense of such cognitions, but it is difficult to make naturalistic\nsense of our knowledge of logic, mathematics and modality. This is the\n\u201ccompanions in guilt\u201d strategy that is often deployed in\narguing for moral objectivity (for more on which, see Lillehammer\n2007). However the Argument from Explanatory Impotence gets a little\nstronger if we combine it with the Argument from Relativity. For the\nfact is that people often disagree about what is intrinsically good or\nbad, about how good or bad the good things and the bad things\nreally are, and about the relations between goodness and\nbadness and what we ought to do. We have already seen that Russell\ndisagreed with Moore about whether we ought to do that action that\nwill actually bring about the best consequences or the action\nthat it is reasonable to believe will bring about the best\nconsequences, which means that they had different intuitions about the\nrelations between goodness and obligation. Moore disagreed with\nSidgwick about whether anything besides pleasure is good as an\nend:\n\n\nThis proposition that \u201cpleasure alone is good as an end,\u201d\nthe fundamental proposition of Ethical Hedonism [is] in Professor\nSidgwick\u2019s language, \u2026 an object of intuition. I shall try to\nshew you why my intuition denies it, just as his intuition affirms it.\nIt may always be true notwithstanding; neither intuition can\nprove whether it is true or not; I am bound to be satisfied,\nif I can \u201cpresent considerations capable of determining the\nintellect\u201d to reject it. (PE: \u00a745)\n\n\nMore comically, the Cambridge Apostles seem to have had a serious\ndisagreement in 1899 about whether \u201cself-abuse\u201d was bad in\nitself, Moore intuiting that it was and his opponents arguing that it\nwas not (Levy 1981: 207\u20138). Now, how could Moore explain the\nintuitions of his opponents? Not by an encounter with badness, since\nanybody fully acquainted with badness and its relata would\nhave been forced to admit that self-abuse was bad. The non-natural\nfacts being impotent in this particular, he would have been driven\nback on natural causes (such as a taste for self-abuse) to explain the\nmisperceptions of his degenerate opponents. Thus he would have been\nforced to admit that some moral evaluations could be\nexplained without the aid of non-natural properties. But once this is\nadmitted, a \u201cWhy stop there?\u201d problem opens up. For after\nall, it would have been child\u2019s play for his opponents to return the\ncompliment, Moore\u2019s self-denying intuitions being the obvious products\nof a Puritanical upbringing. Once we admit that some moral\nintuitions can be explained by natural, as opposed to non-natural,\ncauses\u2014which seems pretty obvious given the prevalence of moral\n\u201cerror\u201d\u2014it is hard to hold the line and insist that\nthere are any of them that cannot be accounted for by\ntemperament, upbringing, desire and taste. It is possible, of\ncourse, that some moral evaluations are due to natural, and some to\nnon-natural, causes, but given that everybody admits that\nmany of our intuitions can be given a naturalistic\nexplanation (namely, the mistaken ones), Occam\u2019s razor suggests that\nthere is no need for the non-natural to explain those moral intuitions\nthat we regard as correct. When supplemented by Relativity (which is\nwhat Russell seems to be hinting at) Explanatory Impotence provides a\npowerful argument against non-natural properties.\n",
