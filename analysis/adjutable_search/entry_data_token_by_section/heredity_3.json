Philosophical issues arising from twin studies and heritability analysis\n\nDiscussions of the viability of heritability measures were most heated\nin the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s discussions about IQ and race\ncame to a head (this issue was revisited in the 1990s with the\npublication of Herrnstein and Murray (1994)), and in the late 1970s\nand early 1980s sociobiology came under critical scrutiny. Both\nproponents of the hereditary nature of IQ and sociobiologists made a\nconnection between human behavioral traits and genes. Hereditarians in\nthe IQ debates explicitly relied upon twin heritability analyses such\nas those introduced above. Critics of sociobiology and hereditarianism\nover IQ included biologists, philosophers and many social scientists\nas well as many left-leaning political and social activists (See Gould\n(1981), Paul (1998) and Segerstr\u00e5le (2000) for some of the\nrelevant history here).\n\nThe point of departure for many philosophers criticizing heritability\nanalysis is Lewontin\u2019s (1974) paper on the analysis of variance.\n(It is worth noting that Lewontin\u2019s paper is somewhat informal\nand should perhaps be best viewed as Lewontin\u2019s attempt to pass\non the received wisdom among population geneticists at the time to a\nwider audience. The formal arguments Lewontin alludes to are presented\nin a number of places including Layzer (1974) (and later Kempthorne\n(1978)) and precursors to these arguments can be found in Hogben\n(1933) and can also be found in R.A. Fisher\u2019s work.) Lewontin\nclaims that equation \\((1\u2019)\\) above presents the most accurate\npicture of the contributions to phenotypic variance. He goes on to\nargue that \\(V_{I}, V_{G\\times E}\\) and \\(\\COV(G,E)\\) are not\nnegligible. In fact, he argues that these are always part and parcel\nof the variance in traits. As a result, apportioning the phenotypic\nvariance between genes and environment is no easy matter and standard\nanalyses of variance simply cannot come up with useful and informative\nvalues for \\(h_b^2\\) and \\(h^2\\). Lewontin also points out that many\nproponents of heritability measures mistakenly attribute the\nheritability values to individuals rather than populations. Further,\nhe argues that norms of reaction gave a more accurate picture of the\nrelations between genes, environment and phenotypic traits. A norm of\nreaction is a graph of a quantitative phenotype plotted as a function\nof environment for different genotypes. Many philosophers and\nbiologists have extended and refined Lewontin\u2019s criticism of the\nanalysis of variance (e.g. Block 1995, Kitcher 1985, Sarkar 1998,\nSober 1988, Northcott 2006) and most share his conclusions that\nheritability measures are hard to come by and that norms of reaction\nare a superior way to examine gene/environment interactions.\n Lewontin (2006) later adds \u201cThe point of the (1974) paper\nwas to explain why the statistical partitioning of observed variation\nin phenotype into variance associated with variation in genetic\nrelationship as opposed to variance assigned to environmental\ndissimilarities does not, in fact, separate genetic and environmental\ncauses in development\u201d (2006, 536). He adds that advances in\nmolecular genetics now make it \u201cpossible to provide a detailed\nmolecular analysis of the chain of causation between nucleotide\nsubstitution and cell development and function\u201d (Lewontin, 2006,\n536). (Sober (1988) also emphasizes this aspect of Lewontin\u2019s\ncriticism of the analysis of variance.) Lewontin makes clear what he\ntakes genetic causation to be: the causal chain from a DNA sequence to\na protein product taking place within cells of organisms. His point is\nthat statistical methods of population genetics and behavioral\ngenetics alone are not appropriate to the task of revealing genetic\ncauses construed this way. We revisit this issue in Section 5. recast\nin light of GWAS and other \u201cmolecular\u201d techniques of\nmeasuring heritability.\n\nOne response to these kinds of criticisms is to emphasize caution in\nthe use of heritability measures and to re-emphasize Lewontin\u2019s\npoint that such measures do not provide information about the traits\nof individuals (See e.g. Plomin et al. 1990; 1997, Hamer and Copeland\n1998). Kitcher (1985) pointed out in response to this line of defense\nthat words of caution do not seem to be enough and many behavioral\ngeneticists and psychologists still talk as if they can discover the\ngenetic components of human behavioral traits by using heritability\nanalyses. A second line of response is to argue that norms of reaction\nare almost impossible to generate for complex human traits and, as a\nresult, are not a serious contender in the business of ascertaining\nthe genetic causes of human traits. Lewontin himself introduced this\nproblem for norms of reaction. In organisms whose genotypes and\nenvironments can be exhaustively manipulated, a norm of reaction for a\nparticular trait can be produced. Lewontin cites early work on\nDrosophila larvae\u2019s responses to temperature as\npioneering work of this kind. The problem for most human traits,\nparticularly human behavioral traits, is that we have no clear sense\nof either what the relevant genes to examine are or what the range of\nrelevant environments is. This response need not necessarily blunt\nLewontin\u2019s critical attack on heritability measures, as in cases\nwhere a norm of reaction can be reliably produced, we do have more\ninformation about the relations between genes and environment than can\nbe provided by a standard analysis of variance. Further, attempts to\nexperimentally partition the contribution of genetic variance to\nphenotypic variance run into problems for human traits similar to the\nproblems presented by attempts to generate norms of reaction. The\nexamples in Section 2. above are artificial for a reason: it is hard\nto establish the relevant genotypes and environments that lead to\nvariance in human traits. The current consensus among philosophers of\nbiology is that heritability analyses are misleading about the genetic\ncauses of human traits but Pearson (2007) provides a cautious defense\nof the explanatory usefulness of heritability analyses. Omri Tal also\npresents modest defenses of heritability via his application of\nprobability to heritability analysis. He does this both in cases in\nwhich there is assumed to be no gene-environment interaction (2009)\nand in cases in which there is gene-environment interaction (2011).\nSesardic\u2019s (1993 and 2005) work stands in stark contrast both\nthe anti-heritability consensus and the moderate and carefully\nmeasured support for heritability provided by Pearson and Tal.\nSesardic strongly supports heritability analyses and vehemently\ncriticizes critics of heritability analysis. Finally, work on norms of\nreaction (see e.g. Pigliucci 2001) since Lewontin\u2019s invoking of\nthe measure reinforces his point about the information that can be\ngained from such analyses.\n\nThere is something of a consensus in most fields (e.g. philosophy of\nbiology, evolutionary biology, psychology and behavioral genetics)\nthat heritability measures (particularly \\(h_b^2\\) measures) only have\na very limited use. The consensus among philosophers of biology is\nthat broad heritability measures are uninformative but there are a few\ndissenting voices (e.g. Sesardic 1993 and 2005, Pearson 2007 and Tal\n2009 and 2011). (The notion of consensus used here is informal,\ntechniques in science studies and experimental philosophy of science\ncould be used to test claims of consensus.) Kaplan (2000) provides an\nintroduction to heritability and its use in behavioral genetics.\nSarkar (1998) presents a sophisticated (and technically quite\ndifficult) treatment of arguments against heritability. Freeman and\nHeron (1998) present a clear analysis of the problems with the use of\nheritability measures by proponents of the connection between IQ and\nrace (understanding this analysis requires some knowledge of\nstatistics). Block (1995) presents an overview of arguments against\nthe use of heritability measures in the IQ and race literature. This\noverview is helpful and specifically designed for a non-technical\naudience. Sober (1988) presents a defense of Lewontin\u2019s (1974)\ncriticism of the use of the analysis of variance in assessing the role\nof genes in the formation of traits of individuals and Northcott\n(2006) provides further helpful analysis of Lewontin\u2019s and\nSober\u2019s work. Both Tabery (2014 and Taylor (2014 ) provide\nsustained criticism of heritability analysis via their alternate\nreflections on the nature/nurture debates.\n\nSesardic\u2019s recent work is a criticism of those who invoke\nLewontin-style arguments against heritability analyses. He argues in\nfavor of hereditarianism by attacking its critics. He summarizes his\ncomplaint as follows: \u201cFor some reason in [the heritability]\ndebate philosophers have displayed a surprising lack of intellectual\ncuriosity and analytical acuity\u201d (2005, 9). This is because\n\u201cthey hastily accepted anti-hereditarian arguments that\npossessed only superficial plausibility\u201d and \u201care often\npoorly informed about basic scientific facts in the very domain of\ntheir explorations\u201d (2005, 9). Sesardic\u2019s criticism is\npolemical and does not introduce any new techniques in heritability\nanalysis to the philosophical audience. Rather, he relies on a\nrecapitulation of earlier views, such as those of Jensen, one of the\noriginal targets of Lewontin\u2019s critique. There are several\nspirited responses to Sesardic\u2019s book (Tabery\u2019s 2006 and\n2009b reviews are examples) and Gri Oftedal (2005) presents a\nclarification of the issues at stake between Sesardic and\nLewontin.\n Part of what is at stake between followers of Lewontin and\nSesardic is whether or not \\(V_{GxE}\\) and other components of\nvariance are negligible or significant. This issue is not purely\nphilosophical and can and has been tackled experimentally. Tabery\n(2009a and 2014) draws attention to a longitudinal study by\npsychologists Caspi and Moffitt, who show GxE effects in a\nlongitudinal study of human anti-social behavior disorders, in support\nof a view in line with Lewontin\u2019s. Douglas Wahlsten also pursues\nthis issue in much of his experimental work (Wahlsten 1990 summarizes\nhis theoretical views and Wahlsten and Gottfried 1997 is a good survey\nof some of the relevant experimental work on animals).  Further,\nunderstanding gene-environment covariance, \\(\\COV(G,E)\\), as part of\nheritability has led some to incorrectly attribute environmental\neffects on phenotype to genes.  Dickens and Flynn (2001) use an\nexample of basketball playing ability, which they label BP, to make\nthis point.  They argue that if we assume that BP is highly heritable,\nthere still appears to be a large environmental component to BP.  On\ntheir account, this makes sense is we take gene/environment covariance\nseriously.  Just as our tall plants, in Section 2. above, can end up\nin nutrient rich environments that shorter plants do not, tall,\nathletic individuals are often placed in environments that enhance\ntheir BP. As Dickens and Flynn point out, identical twins who are tall\nand athletic, including those separated at birth, could have parents\nwho play basketball with them or could be placed in basketball\ntraining regimens in school or college.  In these situations each\nindividual's BP would increase but it is wrong to attribute this\nincrease in BP to genes for height and athleticism, since the relevant\nenvironment has a significant influence on the phenotype. \n\nThere is some irony in the fact that philosophers of biology, who\nfocus their attention almost exclusively on evolutionary biology, are\ncritics of heritability. Heredity is a central component to\nevolutionary change and heritability analysis, particularly via the\nnotion of realized heritability (see equation 5 above), is an\nimportant component of theoretical evolutionary biology. The critical\nattack on heritability arises against the background of nature/nurture\ndebates (see e.g. Tabery 2014) and concerns over genetic determinism\nand is best understood as a critical appraisal of behavioral\ngeneticists in psychology. There is growing interest among\nphilosophers in critically assessing the notion of heritability in its\nevolutionary context. The notion of realized heritability is briefly\ndiscussed by Samir Okasha (2006) (See also Downes 2010) and by Sober\n(2008). Until recently, thorough discussion of the relations between\nheritability and other central concepts of evolutionary theory was\npursued exclusively by evolutionary biologists (e.g. Lynch and Walsh\n1998 and Rice 2004). Peter Visscher et al.\u2019s (2008)\nreview article is a nice introduction to much of the work in this\narea. Philosophers have now presented and defended some radical claims\nabout heritability and heredity including the claim that evolution can\noccur without heredity (see e.g. Earnshaw-Whyte 2012 and Bourrat\n2013). Focusing on heritability in the context of evolutionary theory\nis a productive area for philosophical research as evidenced by\nBourrat\u2019s (2014) examination of the role of heritability in the\nrecipe approach to evolution by natural selection.\n",
