    "main_text": "Lebemeister or Lesemeister? Eckhart as Mystic, Theologian, and Philosopher\n3. Lebemeister or Lesemeister? Eckhart as Mystic, Theologian, and Philosopher\n\nIn much contemporary spiritual literature, various popular new-age\ntomes, and not a little academic scholarship, Meister Eckhart has been\ncharacterized first and foremost as a mystic\u2014and only\nsecondarily as a theologian or philosopher. This characterization has\nto do, in part, with the recovery of Eckhart\u2019s vernacular works\nby nineteenth-century Romantic and Idealist movements in Germany for\nwhom the so-called \u201cmystics\u201d symbolized the\nrepresentatives and custodians of \u201ctrue\u201d religion (Schmidt\n2003). (Eckhart\u2019s more \u201cscholarly\u201d Latin writings\nwere not discovered until the second half of the nineteenth century by\nwhich time he had already been claimed for mysticism.) Relatedly,\nEckhart\u2019s vernacular works lent themselves well to a growing\ninterest in religious perennialism and a desire in the burgeoning\nfields of religious studies, philosophy of religion, and religious\npsychology to locate parallels between the attitudes, experiences, and\nideas found in Christianity and those of other religious and spiritual\ntraditions (Griffioen 2021: 9\u201312). Already in Volume 2 of\nThe World as Will and Representation (1844), Schopenhauer\ncompared Eckhart\u2019s ideas with those found in Buddhism, Sufism,\nand the Upanishads (Schopenhauer 1844 [2018]), and Rudolf Otto\ncompared the Meister to Shankara in his influential 1926 Mysticism\nEast and West (Otto 1926 [1932]). Since then, Eckhart has often\nbeen set alongside other figures sometimes claimed for\nmysticism\u2014e.g., Abraham Abulafia, Ibn \u2018Arabi, Rumi,\nZhuangzi, and Zhu Xi, to name just a few\u2014and his work has been\ncompared to traditions as wide ranging as Advaita Vedanta,\nConfucianism, Sufism, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, and Zoharic Kabbalism,\namong others. Indeed, Eckhart remains a significant touchstone for\nscholars of comparative mysticism today. (For a few direct comparisons\nsee, e.g., Ueda 2018, 1977; Griffioen & Zahedi 2018; Zarrabi-Zadeh\n2016; Wolfson 2013; Zheng 2016b, 2016a; Heitz 2007; Shah-Kazemi 2006;\nSuzuki 1957.)\n\nEckhart\u2019s modern reception as a mystic is unfortunately also due\nto entrenched scholarly biases, both past and present, against\nmedieval vernacular spiritual and theological writing. Quite often,\nthe category commonly referred to as \u201cvernacular\nmysticism\u201d has been misleadingly set up as an irrationalist foil\nto medieval scholasticism, leading to the outright dismissal as\n\u201cnon-philosophical\u201d of many traditions and genres of late\nmedieval religious writing\u2014especially those penned by women and\nlaypersons (Griffioen 2022). And although Eckhart belonged to neither\nof these social categories, his connections to such groups and the air\nof heterodoxy surrounding his later work may have played a significant\nrole in the perpetuation of his contemporary reputation as a mystic\nand his partial exclusion from the scholastic canon. (It is telling\nthat, although an English translation of Eckhart\u2019s German\nsermons appeared already in 1909, his Latin works have never been\ncompletely translated into English.)\n\nAt the same time, in contrast to his Beguine counterparts,\nEckhart\u2019s role as a speculative thinker and champion of natural\nphilosophy did not go wholly unnoticed. For example, his adoption by\nGerman Idealists like Franz von Baader and G.W.F. Hegel transformed\nthe Dominican master into \u201cthe father of modern\nspeculation\u201d in the German-speaking world (Moran 2013:\n669\u201370) and served to make him culturally and philosophically\nrelevant in a way \u201cunmatched in the German intellectual sphere\nin the second half of the nineteenth and for much of the twentieth\ncentury\u201d (O\u2019Regan 2013: 666). However, this also resulted\nin twentieth-century German philosophers like Martin Heidegger\nadapting Eckhartian terms like Gelassenheit (\u201cthe state\nof letting-go\u201d or \u201creleasement\u201d) for their own\nphilosophical purposes, further obscuring the Meister\u2019s own use\nof such terms, as well as the rebranding of Eckhart by the National\nSocialists as the progenitor of a uniquely \u201cGerman\u201d\nChristianity (Moran 2013: 675). However, although Eckhart\u2019s\nplayful use of his vernacular tongue was indeed distinctive, and there\nis certainly a Rhenish-Flemish spiritual tradition to which he can be\nsaid to belong, there is nothing particularly \u201cGerman\u201d\nabout his theology. (Or, if there is, he has other\n\u201cGerman\u201d thinkers like Albert or Dietrich to thank for\nit.)\n\nMore recently, scholars like John Caputo have seen in Eckhart\u2019s\nthought an early critique of what has come to be known as\n\u201contotheology\u201d (Caputo 1975), placing him squarely in a\nhistorical lineage of thinkers taken to anticipate contemporary\nphenomenology and Continental philosophical theology. Others like Kurt\nFlasch place Eckhart in a more recognizably analytic lineage, focusing\non his\n\n\nattempts to prove those theses generally considered essential tenets\nof Christian thought with what he considers to be a purely rational\nmethod. (Flasch 2006 [2015: 15\u201316])\n\n\nStill, we should not be so hasty to completely disassociate Eckhart\nwith \u201cmystical theology\u201d altogether, at least as the term\nwas commonly understood in the late middle ages, in which it was\nassociated less with religious experience and more with a special kind\nof hermeneutical expertise (Griffioen 2021: 1\u20132;\nJantzen 1995: 59ff.). Several places in the Dominican\u2019s work\ndiscuss his self-described aim as a teacher and preacher to uncover\nthe \u201cmystical\u201d (i.e., \u201chidden\u201d) meanings lying\nunder the surface of Holy Scripture, a task that for Eckhart was\nsimultaneously speculative and practical, involving both the pursuit\nof truth and the edification of the soul. Moreover, although Eckhart\nrarely speaks of anything resembling mystical\nexperience\u2014in fact, his work might be better\ncharacterized as \u201canti-experiential\u201d (Yadav 2016; Van Dyke\n2010)\u2014the ideas expressed in both his German sermons and his\nLatin writings do appear to set out a spiritual program of the kind\nthat has traditionally been identified with apophatic (and especially\nDionysian) mysticism. For this reason, we might do better to think of\nhis work as embodying a kind of speculative\nmystagogy\u2014an edificatory spiritual itinerary grounded in a\ncomplex philosophical cosmology and anthropology, fused to a\nsophisticated Trinitarian doctrine of God, and culminating in (without\naiming at!) the intellectual realization of the unity of the Divine\nand human natures.\n\nIndeed, to assume that Eckhart\u2019s intellectual and pastoral tasks\nwere completely divorced from one another fails to capture the\nrichness of his thought. Eckhart has often been called both a\nLesemeister (\u201cmaster of learning\u201d) and a\nLebemeister (\u201cmaster of living\u201d), and it does not\nseem inappropriate to characterize him as simultaneously occupying the\nroles of mystic, theologian, and philosopher, even in his written\nworks (McGinn 2005: 108ff.; Ruh 1996: 229ff.). However we choose to\nlabel him, Eckhart\u2019s thought has been taken up (and adapted,\nrevised, or repurposed) by a wide range of figures and movements,\nincluding proponents of Thomism, negative theology, ecological\ntheology, liberation theology, analytic philosophy, Continental\nphilosophy, phenomenology, feminist theory, Marxist theory, and other\nintellectual circles\u2014as well as by spiritualists, artists, new\nage gurus, and those simply seeking spiritual or existential guidance,\ndemonstrating his relevance for thinkers and movers from all walks of\nlife.\n",
