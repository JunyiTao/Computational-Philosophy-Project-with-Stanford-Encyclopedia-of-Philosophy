    "main_text": "Problems for Meaning Holism || Compositionality\n3.1 Compositionality\n\nAn initial problem with meaning holism is that it seems to conflict\nwith the presumed compositionality of language (Fodor & Lepore\n2002). Semantics is supposed to explain, among other things, how the\nmeanings of sentences and complex terms are a function of the meanings\nof their parts, and meaning holism appears to stand in the way of such\nan approach. If meaning were, say, inferential role, then the\ninferential role of, for instance, \u201cpet fish\u201d would follow\nfrom the inferential roles of \u201cpet\u201d and\n\u201cfish\u201d, but while one can typically infer \u201cweighs\nless than three ounces\u201d from \u201cis a pet fish\u201d, this\ninference follows neither from \u201cis a pet\u201d or \u201cis a\nfish\u201d nor from a combination of those two sets of inferences. In\nshort, they argue:\n\nMeanings are compositional\nbut inferential roles (or any other holistic meaning) are not\ncompositional.\nso meanings can\u2019t be inferential roles. (Fodor and Lepore\n1991)\n\n\nHolists have a number of responses to this argument. \n\nOne of these is to insist (following Block 1993: 42) that as long as\nwe can count \u201cweighs less than three ounces if it\u2019s a\nfish\u201d as part of the inferential role of \u201cit\u2019s a\npet\u201d then inferential roles would compose in just the way that\nFodor and Lepore deny. Block argues that any attempt to keep\n\u201cweighs less than three ounces if it\u2019s a fish\u201d out\nof the inferential role of \u201cpet\u201d would already presuppose\nthe denial of holism, so the compositionality argument isn\u2019t an\nindependent argument against holism since it already presupposes its\ndenial. \n\nAnother is to follow Brandom in arguing that although, properly\nunderstood, a holistic semantics is \u201cnot\ncompositional\u201d, it can still be \u201cfully\nrecursive\u201d (Brandom 2008: 135).  That is to\nsay, while Brandom denies that the meanings of complex expressions can\nbe determined solely from the meanings of their components, he still\ninsists that the meanings of expressions at one level of complexity\nare determined by the meanings of the expressions at the level below,\nand that this recursivity can be used to explain the facts about\nsystematicity and language learning that compositionality is often\ninvoked to\n explain.[13]\n Of course, one could still insist that a language whose semantics was\nactually compositional might be still more systematic, and\neasier to learn. However, the compositionality argument\nagainst meaning holism needs to show more than just that it would be\neasier for us if our semantics were compositional, it needs\nto show that our semantics must be compositional, and this\nassumption is what Brandom\u2019s argument hopes to undercut.\n\nBoth of these responses suggest that while meaning holism may make\ngiving a compositional/recursive semantics hard, it does not\nmake it impossible. However, this leads to a related argument against\nmeaning holism that stresses (with Stanley 2008) that the project of\nproviding a semantics for our language within an atomistic framework\n(in which, say, the semantic value of \u201cdog\u201d is tied to the\nset of dogs), has been noticeably more productive than any attempt to\ndo so within a molecular or holistic framework (where, say, the\nsemantic value of \u201cdog\u201d is a set of inferences or some\nother property of the word\u2019s\n use).[14]\n While it may be possible that a holistic inferential semantics may\neventually catch up with the results achieved by more traditional\natomistic truth-conditional semantics (see the discussion in and\nfollowing Stanley 2006, Other Internet Resources), the results of the\nsemantic programs thus far may suggest that we should favor meaning\natomism over meaning holism unless given good reasons to do\notherwise.\n",
