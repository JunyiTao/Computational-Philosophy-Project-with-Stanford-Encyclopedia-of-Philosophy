    "main_text": "Voltaire\u2019s Life: The Philosopher as Critic and Public Activist || Becoming a Philosophe\n1.3 Becoming a Philosophe\nWhen French officials granted Voltaire permission to re-enter Paris in 1729, he was devoid of pensions and banned from the royal court at Versailles. But he was also a different kind of writer and thinker. It is no doubt overly grandiose to say with Lord Morley that, \u201cVoltaire left France a poet and returned to it a sage.\u201d It is also an exaggeration to say that he was transformed from a poet into a philosophe while in England. For one, these two sides of Voltaire\u2019s intellectual identity were forever intertwined, and he never experienced an absolute transformation from one into the other at any point in his life. But the English years did trigger a transformation in him.\nAfter his return to France, Voltaire worked hard to restore his sources of financial and political support. The financial problems were the easiest to solve. In 1729, the French government staged a sort of lottery to help amortize some of the royal debt. A friend perceived an opportunity for investors in the structure of the government\u2019s offering, and at a dinner attended by Voltaire he formed a society to purchase shares. Voltaire participated, and in the fall of that year when the returns were posted he had made a fortune. Voltaire\u2019s inheritance from his father also became available to him at the same time, and from this date forward Voltaire never again struggled financially. This result was no insignificant development since Voltaire\u2019s financial independence effectively freed him from one dimension of the patronage system so necessary to aspiring writers and intellectuals in the period. In particular, while other writers were required to appeal to powerful financial patrons in order to secure the livelihood that made possible their intellectual careers, Voltaire was never again beholden to these imperatives.\nThe patronage structures of Old Regime France provided more than economic support to writers, however, and restoring the cr\u00e9dit upon which his reputation as a writer and thinker depended was far less simple. Gradually, however, through a combination of artfully written plays, poems, and essays and careful self-presentation in Parisian society, Voltaire began to regain his public stature. In the fall of 1732, when the next stage in his career began to unfold, Voltaire was residing at the royal court of Versailles, a sign that his re-establishment in French society was all but complete.\nDuring this rehabilitation, Voltaire also formed a new relationship that was to prove profoundly influential in the subsequent decades. He became reacquainted with Emilie Le Tonnier de Breteuil,the daughter of one of his earliest patrons, who married in 1722 to become the Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet. Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet was twenty-nine years old in the spring of 1733 when Voltaire began his relationship with her. She was also a uniquely accomplished woman. Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s father, the Baron de Breteuil, hosted a regular gathering of men of letters that included Voltaire, and his daughter, ten years younger than Voltaire, shared in these associations. Her father also ensured that Emilie received an education that was exceptional for girls at the time. She studied Greek and Latin and trained in mathematics, and when Voltaire reconnected with her in 1733 she was a very knowledgeable thinker in her own right even if her own intellectual career, which would include an original treatise in natural philosophy and a complete French translation of Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica\u2014still the only complete French translation ever published\u2014had not yet begun. Her intellectual talents combined with her vivacious personality drew Voltaire to her, and although Du Ch\u00e2telet was a titled aristocrat married to an important military officer, the couple was able to form a lasting partnership that did not interfere with Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s marriage. This arrangement proved especially beneficial to Voltaire when scandal forced him to flee Paris and to establish himself permanently at the Du Ch\u00e2telet family estate at Cirey. From 1734, when this arrangement began, to 1749, when Du Ch\u00e2telet died during childbirth, Cirey was the home to each along with the site of an intense intellectual collaboration. It was during this period that both Voltaire and Du Ch\u00e2telet became widely known philosophical figures, and the intellectual history of each before 1749 is most accurately described as the history of the couple\u2019s joint intellectual endeavors.\n",
