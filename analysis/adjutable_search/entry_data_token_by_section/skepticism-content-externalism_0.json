    "main_text": "Skeptical Hypotheses and the Skeptical Argument\n1. Skeptical Hypotheses and the Skeptical Argument\n\nThe Cartesian Skeptic describes an alleged logically possible scenario\nin which our mental lives and their histories are precisely the same\nas what they actually are, but where the causes of the facts about our\nmental lives are not the kinds of events in the external world that we\ncommonly think they are. On Descartes\u2019 Evil Genius hypothesis,\nthere is no physical world. Rather you are a disembodied mind, and\nyour entire mental life, with all of its experiences, has been caused\nby an all-powerful, purely spiritual Evil Genius. As a result, your\nbeliefs about the external world, such as that you have a body, or\nthat there are planets in the solar system, are all mistaken. On the\nbrain-in-a-vat hypothesis, a given person is a disembodied brain\nliving in a vat of nutrients. The nerve endings of the brain are\nconnected to a supercomputer, whose program sends electrical impulses\nthat stimulate the brain in the same way that actual brains are\nstimulated when perceiving external objects. If you are a brain in a\nvat, suppose, your conscious experiences are and have been\nqualitatively indistinguishable from the experiences you have had over\nthe entire course of your mental life. But if as the result of your\ncomputer-caused experiences you believe, say, that you have a body,\nthen you are mistaken.\n\nGiven such an hypothesis as that of the brain-in-a-vat, the skeptic\ncan go on to argue that there are many commonsense beliefs that we\nthink we know, but that we do not in fact know. One common such\nargument is based on the widely endorsed closure principle that\nknowledge is closed under known entailments:\n\n(CL) For all persons\nS and propositions p and q, if S knows\nthat p, and S knows that p entails q, then\nS knows that q.\n \n\nNow pick any proposition about the external world that you think you\nknow to be true but that is inconsistent with your being a brain in a\nvat, say, the proposition that you have a body. Then the skeptic can\nargue as follows:\n\n(SA)\n(1)\n You know that the proposition that you have a\nbody entails that you are not a brain in a vat. [Premise]\n\n\n \n\u2234 (2) \nIf you know that you have a body, then you know that\nyou are not a brain in a vat. [By (1) and (CL)]\n\n \n(3) \nBut you don\u2019t know that you are not a brain in a\nvat. [Premise] \n\n \n\u2234 (4) \nYou don\u2019t know that you have a body. [By (2) and\n(3)] \n\n\nPremise (3) seems justified by the fact that you have the same\nconscious experiences whether you are a normal human in a normal\nphysical world or a brain in a vat. For again, the evidence you have\nfor each alternative is exactly the same. So you don\u2019t know that\nyou\u2019re not a brain in a vat.\n",
