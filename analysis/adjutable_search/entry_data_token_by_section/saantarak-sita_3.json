    "main_text": "\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Madhyamaka Thought || The Two Truths: Conventional Truths\n1.3 The Two Truths: Conventional Truths\n\nIn a variety of ways, virtually all M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s reject the\nexistence of an ultimate, absolute, unchanging nature in things, as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita demonstrates in the first sixty-two\nstanzas of MA. This is a key component in their presentations of\nultimate truths. The anti-essentialist position of rejecting an\nultimate nature in phenomena enables a M\u0101dhyamika, such as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita in this case, to avoid the\n\u201cextreme\u201d of clinging to objects as permanent, or more\nprecisely, as enduring for more than a moment. Though the arguments\nmay vary, most M\u0101dhyamika thinkers are similar in their\ndescriptions of ultimate truths. Debates among M\u0101dhyamikas tend\nto rise in relation to their presentations of conventional truths, the\nmeans by which the \u201cextreme\u201d of non-existence is\navoided.\n\nAfter concluding that phenomena do not ultimately exist,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita offers his concise summation and\ndefinition of a conventional truth in the sixty-third and sixty forth\nstanzas of MA:\n\nTherefore, these entities are characterized only by conventionality.\nIf someone accepts them as ultimate, what can I do for that person?\n\n\nThose phenomena that are only agreeable when not put to the test\nof\n\n[ultimate] analysis, those phenomena that are generated and\ndisintegrate and those that have the ability to function are known to\nbe of a conventional nature.\n\n\n\u015aantarak\u1e63ita comments on these verses by clarifying that,\n\u201cThis [kind of] conventional is not an entity of mere verbal\ndesignation but since they are dependently arisen entities which are\nperceived and wished for, they are authentic conventionalities\n(tathyasa\u1e43\u1e7frti).\u201d\n [9]\n\nIn these stanzas and in his accompanying auto-commentary, MAV,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita presents the parameters for his\ndefinition of a conventional truth that is authentic\n(Skt.tathya, Tib. yang dag pa). They are:\n\nthat which is known by a mind,\nthat which has the ability to function (i.e., that it is\ncausally efficacious),\nthat which is impermanent, and\nthat which is unable to withstand analysis which searches for an\nultimate nature or essence in entities.\n\n\nIn addition, later in the text, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita describes\nsuch objects in a manner previously only used by proponents of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra school, namely, that such objects\nare \u201cmere consciousness only\u201d. (This aspect will be\ndiscussed below in the section entitled\n\u201cYog\u0101c\u0101ra-Madhyamaka Synthesis\u201d.)\n\nTruths are objects of knowledge in Madhyamaka ontology, so the quality\nof being known by a mind is an imperative and to some degree a\ntautologous assertion. Being impermanent and causally efficacious\nimplies, in Buddhist thought, that they are dependently-arisen, that\nthey arise on the basis of impermanent causes and conditions that are\nthemselves, dependently-arisen. In his own commentary on these\nstanzas, MAV, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita explicitly describes\nconventional truths as dependently-arisen. He goes on to state that\nconventional truths are known with conceptual thought and designated\nby worldly convention (MAV, 88\u201393). Thus an object\u2019s lack\nof an inherent nature is an ultimate truth. Those impermanent,\ndependently arisen, causally efficacious objects of knowledge that are\nknown by conceptual thinking are conventional truths. This is how\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita presents his views on the ontological\nstatus of phenomena in his texts MA and MAV.\n",
