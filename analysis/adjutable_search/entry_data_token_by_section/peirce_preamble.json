    "main_text": "\n\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914) was the founder of American\npragmatism (after about 1905 called by Peirce\n\u201cpragmaticism\u201d in order to differentiate his views from\nthose of William James, John Dewey, and others, which were being\nlabelled \u201cpragmatism\u201d), a theorist of logic, language,\ncommunication, and the general theory of signs (which was often called\nby Peirce \u201csemeiotic\u201d), an extraordinarily prolific\nlogician (mathematical and general), and a developer of an\nevolutionary, psycho-physically monistic metaphysical\nsystem. Practicing geodesy and chemistry in order to earn a living, he\nnevertheless considered scientific philosophy, and especially logic,\nto be his true calling, his real vocation. In the course of his\npolymathic researches, he wrote voluminously on an exceedingly wide\nrange of topics, ranging from mathematics, mathematical logic,\nphysics, geodesy, spectroscopy, and astronomy, on the one hand (that\nof mathematics and the physical sciences), to psychology,\nanthropology, history, and economics, on the other (that of the\nhumanities and the social sciences).\n",
