    "main_text": "Life and Works\n3. Life and Works\n\n\nReferences to Pythagoras by Xenophanes (ca. 570\u2013475 BCE) and\nHeraclitus (fl. ca. 500 BCE) show that he was a famous figure in the\nlate sixth and early fifth centuries. For the details of his life we\nhave to rely on fourth-century sources such as Aristoxenus,\nDicaearchus and Timaeus of Tauromenium. There is a great deal of\ncontroversy about his origin and early life, but there is agreement\nthat he grew up on the island of Samos, near the birthplace of Greek\nphilosophy, Miletus, on the coast of Asia Minor. There are a number of\nreports that he traveled widely in the Near East while living on\nSamos, e.g., to Babylonia, Phoenicia and Egypt. To some extent reports\nof these trips are an attempt to claim the ancient wisdom of the east\nfor Pythagoras and some scholars totally reject them (Zhmud 2012,\n83\u201391), but relatively early sources such as Herodotus (II. 81) and\nIsocrates (Busiris 28) associate Pythagoras with Egypt, so\nthat a trip there seems quite plausible. Aristoxenus says that he left\nSamos at the age of forty, when the tyranny of Polycrates, who came to\npower ca. 535 BCE, became unbearable (Porphyry, VP 9). This\nchronology would suggest that he was born ca. 570 BCE. He then\nemigrated to the Greek city of Croton in southern Italy ca. 530 BCE;\nit is in Croton that he first seems to have attracted a large number\nof followers to his way of life. There are a variety of stories about\nhis death, but the most reliable evidence (Aristoxenus and\nDicaearchus) suggests that violence directed against Pythagoras and\nhis followers in Croton ca. 510 BCE, perhaps because of the exclusive\nnature of the Pythagorean way of life, led him to flee to another\nGreek city in southern Italy, Metapontum, where he died around 490 BCE\n(Porphyry,\nVP 54\u20137; Iamblichus, VP 248 ff.; On the chronology,\nsee Minar 1942, 133\u20135). There is little else about his life of which\nwe can be confident.\n\n\nThe evidence suggests that Pythagoras did not write any books. No\nsource contemporaneous with Pythagoras or in the first two hundred\nyears after his death, including Plato, Aristotle and their immediate\nsuccessors in the Academy and Lyceum, quotes from a work by Pythagoras\nor gives any indication that any works written by him were in\nexistence. Several later sources explicitly assert that Pythagoras\nwrote nothing (e.g., Lucian [Slip of the Tongue, 5],\nJosephus, Plutarch and Posidonius in DK 14A18; see Burkert 1972,\n218\u20139). Diogenes Laertius tried to dispute this tradition by\nquoting Heraclitus\u2019 assertion that \u201cPythagoras, the son of\nMnesarchus, practiced inquiry most of all men and, by selecting these\nthings which have been written up, made for himself a wisdom, a\npolymathy, an evil conspiracy\u201d (Fr.  129). This fragment shows\nonly that Pythagoras read the writings of others, however, and says\nnothing about him writing something of his own. The wisdom and evil\nconspiracy that Pythagoras constructs from these writings need not\nhave been in writing, and Heraclitus\u2019 description of it as an\n\u201cevil conspiracy\u201d rather suggests that it was not (For the\ntranslation and interpretation of Fr. 129, see Huffman 2008b). In the\nlater tradition several books came to be ascribed to Pythagoras, but\nsuch evidence as exists for these books indicates that they were\nforged in Pythagoras\u2019 name and belong with the large number of\npseudo-Pythagorean treatises forged in the name of early Pythagoreans\nsuch as Philolaus and Archytas. In the third century BCE a group of\nthree books were circulating in Pythagoras\u2019 name, On\nEducation, On Statesmanship, and On Nature\n(Diogenes Laertius, VIII.  6). A letter from Plato to Dion asking him\nto purchase these three books from Philolaus was forged in order to\n\u201cauthenticate\u201d them (Burkert 1972a,\n223\u2013225). Heraclides Lembus in the second century BCE gives a\nlist of six books ascribed to Pythagoras (Diogenes Laertius, VIII. 7;\nThesleff 1965, 155\u2013186 provides a complete collection of the\nspurious writings assigned to Pythagoras). The second of these is\na Sacred Discourse, which some have wanted to trace back to\nPythagoras himself. The idea that Pythagoras wrote such a Sacred\nDiscourse seems to arise from a misreading of the early evidence.\nHerodotus says that the Pythagoreans agreed with the Egyptians in not\nallowing the dead to be buried in wool and then asserts that there is\na sacred discourse about this (II. 81). Herodotus\u2019 focus here is the\nEgyptians and not the Pythagoreans, who are introduced as a Greek\nparallel, so that the Sacred Discourse to which he refers is\nEgyptian and not Pythagorean, as similar passages elsewhere in Book II\nof Herodotus show (e.g., II. 62; see Burkert 1972a, 219).Various lines\nof hexameter verse were already circulating in Pythagoras\u2019 name in the\nthird century BCE and were later combined into a compilation known as\nthe Golden Verses, which marks the culmination of the\ntradition of a Sacred Discourse assgined to Pythagoras\n(Burkert 1972a, 219, Thesleff 1965, 158\u2013163; and most recently\nThom 1995, although his dating of the compilation before 300 BCE is\nquestionable). The lack of any viable written text which could be\nreasonably ascribed to Pythagoras is shown most clearly by the\ntendency of later authors to quote either Empedocles or Plato, when\nthey needed to quote \u201cPythagoras\u201d (e.g., Sextus Empiricus,\nM. IX. 126\u201330; Nicomachus, Introduction to\nArithmetic I. 2). For an interesting but ultimately unconvincing\nattempt to argue that the historical Pythagoras did write books, see\nRiedweg 2005, 42\u201343 and the response by Huffman 2008a, 205\u2013207.\n",
