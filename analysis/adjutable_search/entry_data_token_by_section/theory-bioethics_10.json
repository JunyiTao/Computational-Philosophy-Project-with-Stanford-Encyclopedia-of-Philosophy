For starters, there is the\nquestion of which moral theory should prevail. Even if one has no\nproblem choosing a moral theory in the first place, one is bound to\nhave difficulty in successfully defending that choice of theory\nagainst its alternatives (Magelssen, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde\n2016: 27). The intractability of the debates between utilitarians and\ndeontologists, say, should give anyone pause when staking out her\npositions on bioethical matters with the guidance of her preferred\nmoral theory. This is one thing for the academic bioethicist. But it\nis quite another for the clinical ethicist (for instance) to attempt\nto settle the moral matter at hand through recourse to (say)\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative. Not only is she likely to be\nsurrounded by non-philosophers (where recourse to the intricacies of\nsuch high flying moral theory is liable to fall flat), but we must ask\nwhy the public to whom she might be accountable should be subject to\nher preference for Kantianism. The same would hold true for the\nbioethicist working in the public policy arena.\n\nSecond, that challenge aside, there are disagreements within the ranks\nof any given theory. Consider rule versus act utilitarianism, for\ninstance, or disagreement amongst Rawlsians. Third, some cite tensions\nbetween some versions of high theory and democracy. Publicity, many\nhold, ought to be a fundamental norm governing policy making in a\ndemocratic society (Rawls 1971). Requiring such publicity would\npreclude justifications that no one outside an elite class of\nphilosophers can understand. One need not be a theory sceptic, then,\nin order to demote the place of high theory within bioethics; one need\nonly recognize the tension between doing bioethics in a democracy, and\nrarefied moral theory (Bertram 1997; London 2001).\n\nFourth, and this is focused on the usefulness or lack thereof of high\nmoral theory within the clinical ethics context, using theories in the\nprescribed way may be very demanding for the clinical ethicist without\nhigh level philosophical training. Furthermore, the comprehensiveness\nof the justifications promised by high moral theory may be unnecessary\nwithin that context (Magelssen,, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde 2016:\n27). Fifth, and reminiscent of Caplan\u2019s problems with the\napplied model of applied ethics earlier discussed, it is doubtful that\nany high-level philosophical theory can generate straightforward\nanswers to complicated applied problems. Norman Daniels, whose work on\njustice and access to health care was inspired by Rawls\u2019 theory\nof justice, came to admit that philosophical theory is insufficiently\nfine-grained for actual policy making, and that it needs to be\ncomplemented by justly structured political deliberation (Daniels\n1996: 144\u2013175; 2007: ch. 4). The general thought here is that\nhigh philosophical theory is ill-equipped to deal with practical\ndecision making on the concrete level (Gutmann & Thompson 1998).\nAfter all, one\u2019s preferred moral theory could well, for\ninstance, endorse several possible policy options, leaving decision\nmakers wanting for further guidance.\n\nIn sum, bioethics as conceived of as an appeal to high moral theory\nhas been found to have significant limitations, despite its initial\npromise. We now to what appears to be a more promising approach.\n",
