    "main_text": "Determinism and Freedom\n6. Determinism and Freedom\n\nMead\u2019s account of the \u201cMe\u201d and the generalized other\nhas often led commentators to assume that he is a determinist. It is\ncertainly the case that if one were to emphasize Mead\u2019s concern\nwith social systems and the social development of the self, one might\nbe led to conclude that Mead is a theorist of the processes of\nsocialization. And the latter, nested as they are within social\nsystems, are beyond the control of individuals. However, when one\nconsiders the role of the \u201cI\u201d and novelty in his thinking,\nit becomes more difficult to view him as a determinist. But his\nemphasis on novelty only seems to counter determinism with\nspontaneity. This counter to determinism in itself doesn\u2019t\nsupply a notion of autonomy\u2014self-governance and\nself-determination\u2014which is often viewed as crucial to the\nmodern Western notion of the subject. However, Mead was a firm booster\nof the scientific method, which he viewed as an activity that was at\nits heart democratic. For him, science is tied to the manner in which\nhuman beings have managed from pre-recorded times to solve problems\nand transform their worlds. We have just learned to be more methodical\nabout the ways in which we solve problems in modern science. If one\nconsiders his discussions of science and problem solving behavior,\nwhich entail anticipatory experience, the reflexivity of\nconsciousness, the sharing of perspectives and their objective\nreality, and the creativity of the \u201cI,\u201d then one begins to\nsee how Mead thought that our biological endowments coupled with our\nsocial skills could assist us in shaping our own futures, as well aid\nus in making moral decisions. He did not work out the details of this\nprocess, especially with regard to moral autonomy and the\n\u201cI\u2019s\u201d role in\n it.[3]\n There is, however, little doubt that he thought autonomy possible,\nbut the condition for its possibility depends on the nature of the\nself\u2019s genesis and the type of society in which it develops.\n",
