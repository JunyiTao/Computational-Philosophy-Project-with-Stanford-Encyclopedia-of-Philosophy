The ultimate question: is reality directed?\n\nAs emphasized throughout, process philosophy is a complex and highly\ndiversified field that is difficult to describe in more than general\nand disjunctive terms. In conclusion this section will highlight a\ntopic on which contemporary process philosophers are fundamentally\ndivided, to the extent that one group believes that the entire issue\nis ill-conceived.\n\nAs Rescher (1996, ch. 5) points out, processists fall into two\nprincipal camps. On the one side is the teleological (and often\ntheological) wing that sees nature\u2019s processuality as a matter\nof teleological directedness towards a positive destination. On the\nother side is the naturalistic (and generally secularist) wing that\nsees nature\u2019s processuality as a matter of an inner dynamicity\nwithout any directness or at least without any directedness towards a\nspecifiable destination. Both agree in according a central role to\ninherent dynamicity in nature. But the one (naturalistic) wing sees\nthis in terms of randomness that leads in arbitrary ways away from the\nsettled formulations of an established past, while the other\n(teleological) wing sees this in terms of a goal-directed\npurposiveness preestablished by some value-geared directive force.\n\nThe division between secular and theological process philosophy has\nits roots in the early phase of contemporary process thought in late\n19th and the first half of the 20th century, and centers on two views\nof evolutions. For secular, atheological processists evolution\ntypifies the creative workings of a self-sustaining nature that\nfulfills the vision of a certain positivist program, dispensing\naltogether with a God function to explain any of the events in or\nappertaining to the\n universe.[26]\n For theological processists like Teilhard de Chardin, however,\nevolution exhibits God\u2019s handwriting in the book of nature.\n\nPresent-day processists, who in the main no longer take Darwinian\nevolution as a concept or phenomenon that demands a commitment for or\nagainst theism, are wont to point to possible areas of agreement (see\nRescher ibid.). First, present-day processists point out that both\nsecular and theological protagonists of process thought can see\nevolution not only as a crucial instrument for understanding the role\nof intelligence in the world\u2019s scheme of things but also as a\nkey aspect of the world\u2019s natural development. In addition, both\nsecular and theological processists can agree that the evolutionary\nprocess provides process philosophy with one of its main models for\nhow large scale collective processes can inhere in and result from the\noperation of numerous small-scale individual processes, thus\naccounting for innovation and creativity also on a macro-level scale.\nSecond, present-day processists draw attention to the fact that early\nprocess thinkers were divided in their assessment of the phenomenon of\nevolution, since they failed to draw a division within the phenomenon\nof evolution itself. Undoubtedly, human intelligence is based on\nteleologically blind natural selection operating with random mutations\nto produce the neurophysiological capacities of the human brain.\nCultural evolution, on the other hand, does not share these features\nand could well appear as in some sense directed. For example, one\nmight argue that cultural evolution is generally Teilhardian, in that\nit is governed by a rationality-geared selection among purposefully\ndevised mutational variations. Cognitive evolution involves both\nbiological and cultural components, superimposing non-random rational\ndecision-making on biological selection. Our cognitive capacities and\nfaculties are part of the natural endowment we owe to biological\nevolution. But our cognitive methods, procedures, standards, and\ntechniques are socio-culturally developed resources that evolve\nthrough rationality-geared decision making in the process of cultural\ntransmission through successive generations. Our cognitive hardware\n(mechanisms and capacities) develops through Darwinian natural\nselection, but our cognitive software (the methods and procedures by\nwhich we transact our cognitive business) develops in a Teilhardian\nprocess of rationality-geared decision-making that involves purposeful\nintelligence-guided variation and selection. In the eyes of\npresent-day processists\u2014at least those that no longer pursue\nspeculative process thought\u2014it is for scientific research to\ndecide whether, and to what extent, the relationship between\nbiological and cognitive evolution can be understood on the analogy\nthat \u2018biology produces the instrument and culture writes the\nmusic,\u2019 with the instrument constraining the playable music, and\nnot vice versa (cf. Rescher 1996 ch. 5 and Rescher 2006 ch.\n10).\n\nThere is a middle ground between strict theological teleology on the\none hand, and, on the other hand, the naturalistic view that there is\nno final end that all processes are ultimately directed towards.\nAccording to this third alternative, a \u2018soft\u2019 version of\nthe teleological position, process is progress. For, so goes this line\nof reasoning, one can draw a lesson from evolutionary theory about\ncollective progress despite contingency and mortality at the scale of\nthe individual organism. In the small \u2013 i.e., item by item\n\u2013 nature\u2019s processes are self-canceling: what arises in\nthe course of time perishes in the course of time. But nevertheless,\nso the argument goes, (i) the overall course of processual change\ntends to the development of ever richer, more complex and\nsophisticated conditions of occurrence. Moreover, Darwinian\nevolutionism suggests (ii) that\n\n\n\u2026 the arrangements which do succeed in establishing and\nperpetuating themselves will as a general tendency manage to have done\nso because they represent actual improvements in one way or another.\n\u2026 Accordingly, fruitfulness in the long run compensates for\ntransiency and mortality at a smaller scale of occurrence. (Rescher\n1996: 102)\n\n\nThese two central premises for soft teleology are quite substantive,\nhowever. Premise (i) presupposes that (iii) there is a general and\ncomprehensive measure of simplicity or complexity that could be\napplied to natural and cultural processes in order to claim an overall\ntendency of development towards increased complexity; in particular,\nsuch a measure of complexity should make it possible to offset\ndecreases of complexity with respect to one parameter by increases in\ncomplexity relative to another parameter. Premise (ii) presupposes\nthat (iv) species survival can be taken as an indication of some\naspect that meaningfully can be connected to the axiology of progress.\nWhether the optimism of the soft teleological position is justified\nthus ultimately depends on the tenability of claims (iii) and\n (iv).[27]\n The fact that the premises for soft teleology have direct\nimplications for our current debate about transhumanism endows the old\nquestion of the directionality of reality with unexpected practical\nrelevance for the regulation of artificial intelligence and\nrobotics.\n",
