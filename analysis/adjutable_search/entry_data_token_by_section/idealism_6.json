    "main_text": "Nietzsche (and a glimpse beyond)\n7. Nietzsche (and a glimpse beyond)\n\nIt may seem far-fetched to think of Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844\u20131900) as an idealist. After all, he presented himself as\nan almost fanatical anti-idealist throughout his life. In many of his\npublished and unpublished writings as well as in his letters he\nexpresses over and again his dislike and his disdain for what he calls\n\u201cidealism\u201d. A telling summary of his position concerning\nidealism is to be found in his letter to Malvida von Meysenburg (20\nOctober 1888):\n\n\nand I treat idealism as untruthfulness that has become an instinct, a\nnot-wanting-to-see reality at any price: every sentence of my writings\ncontains contempt for idealism. (Nietzsche, eKGWB\nBVN-1888, 1135)\n\n\n\nThis harsh assessment is by no means easy to understand given his\nknown sympathies with a perspectival approach to objects of cognition,\nhis insistence that falsification or tampering\n(Verf\u00e4lschung) is at the basis of most of our cognitive\njudgments, and his claims as to the dependence of knowledge on needs.\nConsiderations like these suggest that in spite of his protests,\nidealistic modes of thinking are not alien to Nietzsche. At least some\nof his beliefs are compatible with what has been called here\nepistemological arguments for idealism although Nietzsche himself\nwould have taken these beliefs to express a form of realism. However,\nbefore searching for and elaborating on possible idealistic tendencies\nin his own thoughts, we should find out what \u201cidealism\u201d\nmeant for Nietzsche and why he was so hostile to it.\n\nIdealism, for Nietzsche, seems to be a particularly unappealing form\nof metaphysics, in other words of philosophy as it has been practiced\nthroughout history from the era of the ancient Greeks up to his own\ntime (because of his contempt for Kant\u2019s postulates of pure\npractical reason, Nietzsche gave little credence to Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical critique of traditional metaphysics). Philosophy in this\ntraditional shape he took to be a somewhat enigmatic endeavor to\npursue the mutually excluding tasks of (culture-forming) art and\nreligion on the one hand and of (cognition-focused) science on the\nother (see Nachgelassene Fragmente: Notebook 19, [47], [62], [218]; KSA\n7. 434). It is doomed to failure because of two fundamental\nshortcomings. The first is that it gives a privileged status to truth\nin declaring truth to be the ultimate goal at which it aims. This\npreoccupation with truth is based on the implicit assumption that\ntruth has some overriding value. This assumption has never been\njustified, not even addressed by any philosopher. Nietzsche writes in\nthe Genealogy of Morals (1887: Section 24):\n\n\nTurn to the most ancient and most modern philosophies: all of them\nlack a consciousness of the extent to which the will to truth itself\nneeds a justification, here is a gap in every philosophy\u2014where\ndoes it come from? Because the ascetic ideal has so far been\nlord over all philosophy, because truth was set as being, as\ngod, as the highest authority itself, because truth was not\nallowed to be a problem. Do you understand this\n\u201callowed to be\u201d?\u2014From the very moment that faith in\nthe God of the ascetic ideal is denied, there is a new problem as\nwell: that of the value of truth.\u2014The will to\ntruth needs a critique\u2014let us hereby define our own\ntask\u2014the value of truth is tentatively to be called into\nquestion. (KSA 5. 401; Third Essay)\n\n\nHowever, it is not the problem of the value of truth but the second\nshortcoming that, in Nietzsche\u2019s eyes, leads directly to\nmetaphysics. It is the tendency of philosophers to deny the obvious,\nto neglect surfaces in favor of what is allegedly behind them, out of\nhabitual weakness and anxiety to prefer the stable and immutable over\nand against change and becoming. This critical sentiment Nietzsche\nexpresses quite often at different places in many of his published and\nunpublished writings. A nice example is the following note:\n\n\nOn the psychology of metaphysics. This world is\napparent\u2014consequently there is a true world. This world is\nconditioned\u2014consequently there is an unconditioned world. This\nworld is full of contradiction\u2014consequently there is a world\nfree from contradiction. This world is becoming\u2014consequently\nthere is an existing [seiende] world. All false inferences\n(blind trust in reason: if A is, there must be its opposing concept\nB). It is suffering that inspires these inferences: at bottom there\nare wishes that such a world might be; similarly hatred of a world\nthat causes suffering expresses itself through the imagination of\nanother world, one full of value: the ressentiment of the\nmetaphysicians against the actual world is here creative. (Notebook 8\n[2]; reprinted in KSA 12. 327)\n\n\nThis tendency to \u201cfalsify\u201d (verf\u00e4lschen) or\nto \u201cre-evaluate/reframe\u201d (umdeuten) reality out\nof resentment is, according to Nietzsche, especially well documented\nin the idealistic tradition in metaphysics, as is shown\nparadigmatically in Plato\u2019s idealism. It was Plato who invented\nthe idea of another world that is much more real, much more true than\nthe ever changing, always unstable world in which we live; he invented\nthe fiction of the supreme reality of an imperishable and everlasting\nideal world inhabited by archetypal ideas and immutable forms, a\n\u201cworld in itself\u201d in comparison to which the\n\u201cLebenswelt\u201d of everyday experience is just a\npale shadow. Yet Nietzsche seems undecided how to evaluate the real\nmotives that led Plato to his idealism. Sometimes he wants to\ndistinguish Plato from other idealists by crediting him with some\nobscure positive reason for endorsing idealism. In section 372 of\nThe Gay Science, entitled precisely \u201cWhy we are not\nidealists\u201d, he writes:\n\n\nIn sum: all philosophical idealism until now was something like an\nillness, except where, as in the case of Plato, it was the caution of\nan overabundant and dangerous health, the fear of overpowerful senses,\nthe shrewdness of a shrewd Socratic. (KSA 3. 623)\n\n\nHowever, there are other passages where Nietzsche is not in such a\ncharitable mood and where he presents the ultimate reasons for\nPlato\u2019s strong leanings towards idealism as rooted in weakness\nand resentment just as with all the other idealists in the history of\nphilosophy (e.g., Ecce Homo 3; reprinted in KSA 6.\n311). His ultimate verdict on metaphysics in all its ancient and\nmodern forms is nicely expressed in the following note:\n\n\nOn the psychology of metaphysics. The influence of fearfulness. What\nhas been most feared, the cause of the most powerful suffering (the\nlust for domination, sexual lust, etc.) has been treated by humans\nmost hostile and eliminated from the \u201ctrue\u201d world. Thus\nthey have step by step wiped out the affects\u2014claimed God to be\nthe opposite of the evil, i.e., reality to consist in the negation of\ndesires and affects (which is to say precisely in nothingness).\nLikewise they hate the irrational, the arbitrary, the accidental (as\nthe cause of countless physical suffering). Consequently they negate\nthis element in that-which-is-in-itself, they conceive it as absolute\n\u201crationality\u201d and \u201cpurposiveness\u201d. In the same\nway they fear change, transitoriness: therein is expressed an\noppressed soul, full of mistrust and bad experience (The case of\nSpinoza: an inverted sort of person would count this change as\ncharming). A playful being overladen with power would call precisely\nthe affects, unreason and change good in an eudaimonistic sense,\ntogether with their consequences, with danger, contrast, dissolution,\netc.. (KSA 13. 536)\n\n\nHowever, this thoroughly critical assessment of all forms of idealisms\nas abominable expressions of intellectual weakness and vindictiveness\nseems to be at odds with another of Nietzsche\u2019s cherished\nbeliefs, according to which we have to take reality to be not only\ndependent on but ultimately constituted by the respective perspectives\non or the respective ways of interpreting what we encounter. This\nNietzschean view can give rise to the impression that in the end he\nmight have been closer to endorsing some form of epistemologically\nmotivated idealism. This leads to the topics of perspectivism and\ninterpretation (Auslegung) in Nietzsche.\n\nAlthough the details are far from clear, the general tendency of his\nperspectivism is expressed quite well in aphorism 374 from The Gay\nScience:\n\n\nHow far the perspectival character of existence extends, indeed\nwhether it has any other character; whether an existence without\ninterpretation, without \u201csense\u201d, does not become\n\u201cnon-sense\u201d; whether, on the other hand, all existence is\nnot essentially an interpreting existence\u2014that cannot\nbe decided, as would be fair, even by the most studious and scrupulous\nanalysis and self-examination of the intellect; for in the course of\nthis analysis, the human intellect cannot avoid seeing itself under\nits perspectival forms, and solely in these.\u2026Rather,\nthe world has once again become infinite to us: insofar as we cannot\nreject the possibility that it includes infinite\ninterpretations. (KSA 3. 626)\n\n\nThis view, according to which, further, the world each of us is\nexperiencing is the product of an interpretation forced on us by some\nunconscious overriding drive (Trieb) that is the formative\nmark of the individual character of each of us, might be seen as\nendorsing a version of idealism if, as it is here, idealism is\nunderstood as the claim that what appears to be known as it is\nindependent of the mind is in the end inescapably marked by the\ncreative, formative, constructive activities of human mind, whether\nindividual or collective. However, it is far from clear whether\nNietzsche wants us to think of this process of interpretation which\nleads to a specific perspective as a mind-dependent activity.\nSometimes it seems as if he is favoring a quasi-Humean view according\nto which the intellect operates in the service of some anonymous\naffective and emotional drives in such a way that it just provides a\nset of necessary means to consciously realize what drives force us to\ndo. The following note, for example, points in this direction:\n\n\nAgainst positivism, which would stand by the position \u201cThere are\nonly facts\u201d, I would say: no, there are precisely no facts, only\ninterpretations. We can establish no fact \u201cin itself\u201d: it\nis perhaps nonsense to want such a thing. You say \u201cEverything is\nsubjective\u201d: but that is already an interpretation, the\n\u201csubject\u201d is not anything given, but something invented\nand added, something stuck behind\u2026To the extent that the word\n\u201cknowledge\u201d [Erkenntnis] has any sense, the world\nis knowable: but it is interpretable differently, it has no sense\nbehind it, but innumerable senses, \u201cperspectivism\u201d. It is\nour needs that interpret the world: our drives and their to and fro.\nEvery drive is a kind of domination, every one has its perspective,\nwhich it would force on all other drives as a norm. (Notebook 7 [60].\nKSA 12. 315)\n\n\nIn other passages Nietzsche seems to be more in line with a by and\nlarge Kantian view according to which the intellect provides some\nrules of transformation of what is given by the senses as individual\nand discrete data into more general representations. Thus we find him\nclaiming in section 354 of The Gay Science:\n\n\nThis is what I understand to be true phenomenalism and\nperspectivism: that due to the nature of animal\nconsciousness, the world of which we can become conscious is\nmerely a surface- and sign-world, a world turned into generalities and\nthereby debased to its lowest common denominator,\u2014that\neverything that enters consciousness thereby becomes superficial,\nthin, relatively stupid, general, a sign, a mark of the herd, that all\nbecoming-conscious involves a vast and fundamental corruption,\nfalsification, superficialization, and generalization. (KSA\n3. 593)\n\n\nBe this as it may, at least as far as epistemological idealism is\nconcerned it is by no means obvious that either his explicit criticism\nof idealism or his remarks on the ways we make up epistemic worlds\nprevent Nietzsche from coming close to an idealist position himself.\nThis is so because in epistemology his main enemy does not seem to be\nidealism but all forms of realism.\n\nAlthough his epistemology does not explicitly imply any ontological\nclaims, one could be tempted to see Nietzsche as toying with some\nontologically idealistic fantasies. His speculations concerning the\nwill to power as the ultimate dynamic foundation of all reality fall\ninto this category. For example,\n\n\nPerspectivism is only a complex form of specificity[.] My idea is,\nthat every specific body strives to become lord over all of space and\nto expand its force (\u2014its will to power) and to repel everything\nthat resists its own expansion. But it perpetually collides with the\nequal efforts of other bodies, and ends by making an arrangement\n(\u201cunifying\u201d) with those that are closely enough related to\nit:\u2014thus they conspire together to power. And the process goes\non\u2026. (Notebook 14 [186]. KSA 13. 373 f.)\n\n\nThis idea of conspiring forces as the supreme world-constituting\nentities can look like an allusion to Kant\u2019s physics of\nattraction and repulsion, but also to a version of ontological\nidealism like those of Fichte and Schelling because it too invites us\nto conceive of dynamic processes as ontologically prior to (physical\nor mental) objects and events. Thus, in the end there are no real\nobstacles to thinking of Nietzsche as an idealist on ontological as\nwell as epistemological grounds, although the speculations that lead\nhim in the former direction may be separable from the latter.\n\nHowever, even after the heyday of German idealism that ended with\nHegel\u2019s death, it is not just the work of Schopenhauer and\nNietzsche that show traces of idealistic thinking in the German\nspeaking world. Although it goes beyond the scope of this article,\nsome hints about the fate of idealism in Germany might be appropriate.\nInterest especially in metaphysical versions of idealism waned in\nGermany in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first\ndecades of the twentieth (although it remained lively in other parts\nof Europe, e.g., in Italy, in the person of Benedetto Croce), but\nengagement with idealist positions and points of view did not entirely\nvanish. The decline of interest in idealism during this period had to\ndo primarily with a certain aversion against what was taken to have\nbeen an excessive and extravagant usurpation of all fields of\nintellectual discourse by the classical German philosophers under the\npretext of idealism. This line of criticism was voiced most forcefully\nby influential natural scientists like Hermann von Helmholtz.\nMarginalization of idealism in these years also was an effect of the\nrise of Neo-Kantianism, which at least partly came into being both in\nits Marburg-school (Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, Ernst Cassirer) and in\nits Southwest(Heidelberg)-school (Wilhelm Windelband, Heinrich\nRickert, Emil Lask) version as a reaction against the German\nidealists. Although insofar as Neo-Kantianism was a reaction mainly to\nabsolute idealism it could not entirely reject epistemological\narguments of the kind that had traditionally led to idealism,\nespecially in its Kantian variety. Hence idealistic tendencies can be\nfound in Neo-Kantianism too, and Martin Heidegger\u2019s later\nversion of realism can be interpreted as a response to the idealism in\nNeo-Kantianism.\n\nDespite these critical attitudes towards idealism, which contributed\nto its decline as a major philosophical position in the German\nintellectual milieu before the first World War, idealistic claims\nbased on metaphysical and/or epistemological arguments can still be\nfound in the works of some of the (at least at that time) better known\nphilosophers. In particular, the writings of Friedrich Adolf\nTrendelenburg (1802\u20131872) and Rudolf Hermann Lotze\n(1817\u20131881) are documents of a lasting influence of idealistic\nfigures and practices of thought, as was highlighted in detail by\nBeiser (2013). Trendelenburg\u2019s interpretation of his central\nconcept of motion (Bewegung) and Lotze\u2019s vindication of\nhis theory of value (Wert) reveal quite tellingly their\nefforts to preserve essential idealistic features of both\nHegel\u2019s metaphysics (Trendelenburg) and Kant\u2019s\nepistemology (Lotze). It also has to be kept in mind that during this\nperiod there were still active right (old) and left (new) Hegelians\nwho were either critically or apologetically committed to a broadly\nHegelian or idealistic framework in philosophy. There were also those\naround who sympathized with certain aspects of Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy. All these voices had some impact on philosophical\ndiscussions mainly about religion (e.g., Immanuel Hermann Fichte,\nChristian Hermann Weisse) and politics (e.g., Bruno Bauer, Ludwig\nFeuerbach, David Friedrich Strauss). A similar observation can be made\nwith respect to Karl Marx and the Marxists: although they were\noutspoken opponents of an idealism in Hegel\u2019s sense, their\nanti-idealism did not stop them from entertaining idealistic notions\nof the development of history or the unavoidability of social\nprogress, with eventually profound consequences for twentieth-century\nhistory. In spite of all this, it is fair to say that idealism fell\nout of fashion in the German speaking world, and has stayed that\nway.\n",
