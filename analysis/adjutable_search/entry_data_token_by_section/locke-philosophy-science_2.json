    "main_text": "Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy: Scientia and human knowledge || Historical roots of scientia\n2.1 Historical roots of scientia\n\nThe conception of genuine scientific knowledge that Locke inherits and\nto some extent retains, scientia, has its roots in Aristotle,\nspecifically in the beginning of Book I, \u00a72 of the Posterior\n Analytics.[1]\n For Aristotle, scientific knowledge can have only necessary truths as\nits objects and requires a knowledge of causes. Accordingly,\nscientific knowledge of a fact requires knowing its necessity by\nknowing its necessary relations to its causes. Although there are\nmanifold causes, the main one at issue here is the formal\ncause\u2014the nature or essence\u2014as Aristotle indicates\n elsewhere.[2]\n\nWe suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a\nthing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the\nsophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact\ndepends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and, further, that\nthe fact could not be other than it is\u2026.The proper object of\nunqualified scientific knowledge is something which cannot be other\nthan it is (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, I.2).\n\n\nThe knower\u2019s epistemic stance toward a necessary truth and its\nrelation to causes is one of certainty. The certain fact is\ndemonstrable via a syllogism in which the premises are self-evident,\nrequiring no demonstration themselves.\n\nWe do know by demonstration. By demonstration I mean a syllogism\nproductive of scientific knowledge, a syllogism\u2026.The premisses\nmust be primary and indemonstrable; otherwise they will require\ndemonstration in order to be known, since to have knowledge, if it be\nnot accidental knowledge, of things which are demonstrable, means\nprecisely to have a demonstration of them. The premisses must be the\ncauses of the conclusion, better known than it, and prior to it; its\ncauses, since we possess scientific knowledge of a thing only when we\nknow its cause; prior, in order to be causes; antecedently known, this\nantecedent knowledge being not our mere understanding of the meaning,\nbut knowledge of the fact as well (Aristotle, Posterior\nAnalytics, I.2).\n\n\nThe stipulation that the premises of a scientific demonstration must\nbe indemonstrable, that is, self-evident, leads to a prima\nfacie difficulty. This conception of scientific knowledge is\nintended to encompass not only conceptual propositions, but also\npropositions about the real natures or essences of substances, which\nare propositions about the world. As with any other demonstration, a\ndemonstration in natural philosophy must have premises that are\nself-evident, since otherwise a regress would ensue. Propositions\nabout the world are experience-based, however, and therefore, it is\nnot clear how a demonstration\u2019s premises could be\nself-evident.\n\nIt would be overstating matters to say that this problem appears only\nfrom a contemporary perspective; there was some recognition of it in\nthe ancient and medieval\n periods.[3]\n Still, before the advent of the experimental science, the problem was\nnot strongly felt because experience was understood in a different\nway. For one thing, the notion of an experiment\u2014an artificially\nconstructed, single event or series of events designed to test for a\npredicted outcome\u2014did not exist. Moreover, among the scholastic\nAristotelians, a single, naturally occurring event could not by itself\nbe regarded as revealing of natural processes; such an event could be\na \u201cmonster,\u201d that is, an event that conflicts with nature\nrather than having been produced by\n it.[4]\n Events as generally experienced, however, were regarded as being\nrevealing of nature and consequently, they could provide the universal\ntruths needed as premises in the\n syllogism.[5]\n How was the gap between events as usually experienced\u2014which\nstill amounts to a limited sample of evidence\u2014and the universal\nclaim derived from them bridged? It is only from the modern and\ncontemporary perspectives that such a gap exists to be bridged. For\nAristotle and medieval thinkers, human faculties are so constituted as\nto be able to apprehend nature, that is, to discern the essences of\n substances.[6]\n In short, then, because the internal essences that form the content\nof natural philosophy are real, and because our faculties are\nconstituted to apprehend those real essences, natural philosophy can\nbe a science; it is a domain in which certain, demonstrative knowledge\ncan be had, despite its dependence upon experience.\n\nThe exemplars of scientific knowledge, to be sure, are conceptual\ndisciplines, not only geometry, but also rational theology, the latter\nbeing the quintessential science for the\n medievals.[7]\n Yet for the most part, natural philosophy stands side by side with\nconceptual disciplines, even into the modern period. Bacon, though\nassociated with induction, accepts the demonstrative conception of\nscientific knowledge, and so does Galileo, who uses experiments to\nreveal fundamental principles (though also using them in other\n ways).[8]\n As empirical methods are refined and more widely applied, however,\nthe belief that natural philosophy can stand under the umbrella of\nscientia comes under increasing\n pressure.[9]\n Some thinkers resist the pressure, most notably Descartes, who\nderives his laws of nature by an a priori reflection upon God\u2019s\nnature, and, placing his confidence in these rationalist methods,\ndenies that his third law of nature is undermined when observations of\ncolliding bodies conflict with\n it.[10]\n Yet for the experimentalists themselves, including Locke\u2019s\nmentor, Boyle, observations and experiments are the primary route to\nknowledge. (It should be noted, however, that most advocates of\nexperimentalism did not consider speculation wholly illegitimate,\ninstead insisting that it be delayed until considerable experimental\nand observational evidence had been amassed; see Anstey (2011, pp.\n4,5).) It is this approach that puts natural philosophy on the path to\nHume\u2019s problem of induction and most influences\n Locke.[11]\n",
