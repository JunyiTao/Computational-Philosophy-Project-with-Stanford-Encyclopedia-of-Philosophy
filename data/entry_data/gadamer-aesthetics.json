    "preamble": "\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer (1900\u20132002) does not provide an account of\nthe aesthetic in any customary sense. His approach to art runs, in\nmany ways, against conventional philosophical expectations. Aesthetic\nqualities are not debated in the manner of the analytic tradition of\nmodern philosophy, nor does he concern himself overtly with the\nproblems of aesthetic pleasure. Gadamer\u2019s approach to aesthetic\nexperience stands squarely in the phenomenological tradition. He is\nprimarily concerned with the place of art in our experience of the\nworld. Furthermore, his approach to aesthetic theory is one of those\nrare intellectual achievements which is simultaneously deconstructive\nand constructive. He dismantles elements of the grand tradition of\nPlatonic, Kantian, and Hegelian aesthetics and yet offers a\nhermeneutical and phenomenological reconstruction of many of the\ncentral insights of that tradition to demonstrate its continuing\nrelevance to our contemporary experience of art. Gadamer is primarily\nconcerned with the cognitive dimension of such experience, with what\nartworks address and what they put at issue. This makes for a flexible\nphilosophical approach capable of ranging freely over a number of art\nforms and styles, discussing both the singularity of works and their\nbroader significance. The approach is clearly hermeneutical in that it\nendeavors to reacquaint us with those received meanings and\npreoccupations which underlie our experience of art. Openly influenced\nby Martin Heidegger, the later essays on language and poetry in\nparticular, Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics is far from traditional. His\nkey claims are:\n\nAesthetics is not the study of specific types of subjective\npleasures derived from art. It is a study of what objectively informs\nour subjective awareness of art.\nHermeneutical aesthetics seeks to break through the pleasurable\ndistractions of aesthetic consciousness in order to disclose the\ncultural and linguistic realities that manifest themselves within\nit.\nHermeneutical aesthetics presupposes phenomenological involvement\nwith the subject matters of art rather than disinterested\ndetachment.\nHermeneutical aesthetics regards aesthetic appearance not as a\ndistraction from the real but as the vehicle through which real\nsubject matters reveal themselves. It overturns the notion that\nartworks are at one remove from reality.\nHermeneutical aesthetics is dialogical in character. It recognises\nthat practitioner and theoretician share in bringing a subject matter\nto light and plays down any theory/practice division in the arts.\nInterpretation is a means to a work\u2019s realization.\nHermeneutical aesthetics is not a theory of art per se,\nmore a set of practical contemplative notes for enhancing one\u2019s\nencounter with art. The end of hermeneutical aesthetics is not to\narrive at a concept of art but to deepen our experience of art. In\nhermeneutical aesthetics, theory is deployed to deepen contemplation\nof artworks rather than to categorize their nature.\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics is deeply respectful of art\u2019s\nability to disrupt and challenge customary expectations. It attributes\nan ethical significance to art as being able to reveal the limitations\nof fixed cultural expectancy and to open the spectator towards the\nother and the different.\n\n\nIn this entry, we discuss the leading arguments which inform these\ncontentions.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Art as Interlocutor\n\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics fosters an attentiveness towards the\nmystery of the given and its unexpected folds of meaningfulness.\nGadamer\u2019s arguments are varied, ushering the reader towards an\naesthetic attentiveness rather than making iconoclastic declarations\nabout what the aesthetic is. They embrace close readings of the poets\nRilke and Celan as well as broad strategic manoeuvres which defend the\ncognitive status of aesthetic and hermeneutical judgements.\nHermeneutics (the art and discipline of interpretation), of which\nGadamer is one of the twentieth century\u2019s most formidable\nexponents, is deeply involved in philosophical disputes over the\nlegitimacy of claims to understanding in the visual and literary arts.\nIt does not oppose \u201cscientific\u201d modes of knowledge but\nresists their cultural privileging. For Gadamer aesthetics stands on\nexperientially accumulative modes of learning (Bildung) which\norientate and ground sound judgement in the arts. Conversation and its\nunpredictable turns is, appropriately, a central thread within\nhermeneutical aesthetics. A late exchange between Carsten Dutt and\nGadamer (Dutt 1993, 61\u201367) offers a gentle point of entry into\nhow philosophical hermeneutics approaches art and aesthetic\nexperience.\n\nGadamer insists that a picture or image that is worthy of being called\na work of art, has the power to affect us immediately. (GW 8, 374).\nArt addresses us. The claim that a work of art \u201csays something\nto someone\u201d (Palmer 2001, 70) alludes to the surprise, shock\nand, sometimes, dismay at being directly affected by what is in a work\nand of being forced to reflect on its claim so that it becomes more\nunderstandable to both oneself and others. Gadamer argues that\n\u201cthe experience of art is an experience of meaning, and as such\nthis experience is something that is brought about by\nunderstanding\u201d (Palmer 2001, 70). To this extent, then,\n\u201caesthetics is absorbed into hermeneutics\u201d (Palmer 2001,\n76). This distances Gadamer from more conventional justifications of\nthe aesthetic as offering a special kind of pleasure. The essay\n\u201cThe Play of Art\u201d\u00a0suggests that \u201cthe mere\nonlooker who indulges in aesthetic or cultural enjoyment from a safe\ndistance, whether in the theatre, the concert hall, or the seclusion\nof solitary reading, simply does not exist\u201d (RB 129\u2013130).\nA person who takes himself to be such an onlooker, misunderstands\nhimself. \u201cAesthetic self-understanding is indulging in escapism\nif it regards the encounter with the work of art as nothing but\nenchantment in the sense of liberation from the pressures of reality\nthrough the enjoyment of a spurious freedom\u201d (RB 130). These\nremarks divorce Gadamer\u2019s thinking from Dilthey\u2019s\nErlebnis-\u00c4sthetik in which artworks are proclaimed the\nsite of intense but momentary experience enjoyed for their own sake\nindependent of their cognitive content. The hedonistic personalisation\nof aesthetic response has two alienating consequences. On the one\nhand, the judgement that aesthetic experience is purely subjective\nsevers the individual from communal networks of meaning capable of\nilluminating personal experience from the perspective of what is\nsocially shared. On the other, attempts to render subjective\nexperience academically legitimate by presenting it as a social\nproduct further estrange the individual from his experience, by\ntranslating it into third-person terms he or she may not endorse or\nrecognise: individual experiences of beauty can suddenly become\nembodiments of class prejudice. In contrast to Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911), Gadamer defends an\nErfahrung-\u00c4sthetik, which claims that like significant\nlife-experiences, our relationships with artworks are deep and\nongoing: we revisit them,\u00a0and, in doing so, understanding is\ncontinually renegotiated. Gadamer speaks of the\n\u201cinterminability\u201d of such experience (die\nUnabschliessbarkeit aller Erfahrung, Palmer 2001, 66). It is\nforever open because of its cognitive movement. The cumulative nature\nof such experience is an instance of Bildung (formation and\nlearning through experience) and is, as such, a living process of\nbecoming (Werden).\n\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics is, in many respects, strictly anti-Kantian\nand yet is influenced by Kant\u2019s insights. Regarding its\nanti-Kantian aspects, it abjures phenomenalist disinterestedness for\nthe sake of phenomenological involvement. It is also anti-idealist. It\nrefuses the idea that in aesthetic experience we perceive \u201ca\npure integration of meaning.\u201d His aesthetics is consequently\nanti-representationalist. There is in the artwork something which\nGadamer describes as its resistance to integration, to being reduced\nto a concept (Palmer 2001, 25). He contends that Hegel\u2019s\ndefinition of the beautiful as the \u201csensuous appearing of the\nIdea\u201d presumes that aesthetic experience is able to reach beyond\nthe specific type of appearance to its underlying idea. In this model,\naesthetic experience becomes the expectation of a semantic fulfilment.\nOnce the idea behind the appearance is grasped, \u201cthe whole of\nits meaning would have been understood once and for all and thus\n\u2018brought in to our possession so to speak\u2019\u201d (Palmer\n2001, 71). The work of art becomes a carrier of meaning to be\nabandoned once the lead story has been grasped. But, Gadamer argues,\n\u201cour understanding of artworks is manifestly not of this type.\nEveryone knows this from his or her own encounters with art, from\nconcerts, visits to museums, and from his or her reading\u201d\n(Palmer 2001, 71). This denial of idealist aesthetics is at the basis\nof his claim that an artwork is essentially enigmatic.\n\nGadamer\u2019s opposition to aesthetic idealism is supported by the\nclaim that art \u201ccannot be satisfactorily translated in terms of\nconceptual knowledge\u201d (RB 69). A work does not simply refer to a\nmeaning which is independent of itself. Its meaning is not to be\ngrasped in such a way that that it can be simply transferred to\nanother idiom. Indeed, because it invites many interpretations, an\nartwork acquires an ideality of possible meanings which cannot be\nobviated by any possible realisation (RB 146). The work has,\ntherefore, an autonomy which cannot be substituted by anything else\nor, to put it another way, the work is always in excess of its\nreadings, its meanings are always more than its interpretations. This\nis congruent with Gadamer\u2019s theses that Being exceeds knowing\nand, similarly, that linguistic Being transcends linguistic\nconsciousness.\n\nAn important consequence arises from this, namely, Gadamer conceives\nart as presentational (darstellen) rather than\nrepresentational (vorstellen). In the essay \u201cWord and\nPicture\u201d (1992), he claims that he tries \u201cto undermine the\nidea that the picture is a mere copy\u201d (GW 8, 374). As a work\ndoes not represent anything other than itself, the meanings it carries\ncan only come to the fore in its self-presentation. Yet the emergent\nmeaning is never given in its entirety nor obviated by any\nrealization. This is consistent with the eventual nature of\nart. \u201cWhen a work of art truly takes hold of us, it is not an\nobject that stands opposite us which we look at in hope of seeing\nthrough it to an intended conceptual meaning \u2026 The work is an\nEreigniss\u2014an event that \u2018appropriates us\u2019\nto itself. It jolts us, it knocks us over and sets up a world of its\nown, into which we are drawn\u201d (Palmer 2001, 71). What is\nrevealed, however, remains but an aspect of the work, which when it\nappears, drives others into the background. Disclosure and hiddenness\nare not contraries in Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics, but mutually\ndependent: the disclosed reveals the presence of the undisclosed in\nthe disclosed. \u201cIt is in the sheer being there\n(Da-sein) of the work of art that our understanding\nexperiences the depths and the unfathomability of its meaning\u201d\n(Palmer 2001, 72). The claim that a work\u2019s meaning can never be\ncompletely fulfilled is supported by a linguistic analogy concerning\nthe speculative. Art has a language in that its signs and symbols\nfunction like semantic units. Gadamer comments on the living\nvirtuality of meaning contained in each word, as an inner dimension of\nmultiplication. Accordingly, language is not the representation\n(mimesis) of a set of pre-given meanings but a \u201ccoming\nto language\u201d of a constant reserve of meanings (Palmer 2001,\n67). The finitude of linguistic expression is such that no utterance\ncan be complete. Nothing comes forth in one meaning that is simply\noffered us (PH 103). \u201cThe only thing that constitutes language\n\u2026 is that one word leads to another, each word is, so to speak,\nsummoned, and on its side holds open the further progress of\nspeaking\u201d (Palmer 2001, 67). No meaning can be completely\nrevealed. Because we can re-visit artworks repeatedly, the meaning\ndisclosed initially can be expanded or changed. The partial nature of\nany given meaning-disclosure enhances rather than diminishes\nthe possibility of meaning within a work. \u201cThe work of art\nconsists in its being open in a limitless way to ever new integrations\nof meaning\u201d (PH 98) and furthermore, \u201cthe inexhaustibility\nthat distinguishes the language of art from all translation into\nconcepts rests on an excess of meaning\u201d (PH 102).\n\nGadamer\u2019s conversation on aesthetics paints its bolder themes:\nart is interrogative by nature, artworks work through a\ndisclosure of meaning, disclosures of meaning establish art\u2019s\ncognitive status, the cognitive content of art is partly intelligible\nand partly enigmatic, and artworks are always open to\nre-interpretation. These are, however, not free-standing arguments.\nGadamer\u2019s position is hermeneutical not because of an underlying\nthesis which goes unremarked but because it is informed by a\nconstellation of various arguments which shape the central position.\nTo the broader arguments we now turn.\n2. The \u201cSubstance\u201d of Aesthetic Subjectivity\n\nGadamer\u2019s determination to reveal the cognitive content of\naesthetic experience requires him to expose the ontological grounding\nof subjectivity. To approach artworks solely on the basis of\nsubjective responses to them or, to read them only in terms of an\nartist\u2019s intentionality, is, for Gadamer, always to miss the\npoint. Hermeneutically speaking, the philosophical focus should be on\nwhat shapes subjectivity and guides its expectations. This initiates a\nspeculative refiguring of aesthetic subjectivity. In Truth and\nMethod he writes,\n\nAll self-knowledge arises from what is historically pre-given, what\nwith Hegel we call \u201csubstance,\u201d because it underlies all\nsubjective intentions and actions, and hence both prescribes and\nlimits every possibility for understanding any tradition whatsoever in\nits historical alterity. This almost defines the aim of philosophical\nhermeneutics: its task is to retrace the path of Hegel\u2019s\nphenomenology of mind until we discover in all that is subjective the\nsubstantiality that determines it. (TM 302)\n\n\nIn his essay \u201cImage and Gesture\u201d\u00a0Gadamer elucidates\nsubstance as follows:\n\n\u201cSubstance\u201d is understood as something that supports us,\nalthough it does not emerge into the light of reflective\nconsciousness, it is something that can never be fully articulated,\nalthough it is absolutely necessary for the existence of all clarity,\nconsciousness, expression and communication. (RB 78)\n\n\nUncovering the ontological foundations of aesthetic experience does\nnot undermine the primacy Gadamer gives to art\u2019s immediate\naddress. The aim is to demonstrate the cognitive legitimacy of\nsubjective experience by revealing how aesthetic experience is both\ninvolved in something larger than itself and, indeed, reflects\n(speculum) that larger actuality within itself. The ability\nof aesthetic experience to express trans-individual phenomenological\nstructures explains what is meant by substance and his speculative\nattitude towards it. Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics is properly concerned\nwith experiencing what underlies its more abstract concepts.\nThis is not a matter of naming or describing the reality which\nmanifests itself in aesthetic experience but of trying to say\nsomething about the experience an individual has of it.\nGadamer\u2019s reflections commence with the immediacy of art\u2019s\nclaim, its contemporaneous nature, and then explore what influences\nthe experience of that claim. The aim is seemingly paradoxical: to\nunderstand that which shapes, lies beyond, but only\n\u201cshows\u201d itself in aesthetic experience.\n3. The Contemporaneous and Art Experience\n\nOf all things that speak to us, it is the artwork that does so most\ndirectly (PH 95). The phenomenological immediacy of art which\ninitiates Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic inquiry into aesthetic\nexperience may not seem a promising starting point from a hermeneutic\nperspective. It declares an unconventional hermeneutical approach to\nart: \u201cif we define the task of hermeneutics as the bridging of\npersonal or historical distance between minds, then the experience of\nart would seem to fall entirely outside its [hermeneutics\u2019]\nprovenance\u201d (PH 95/97). However, Gadamer does not define\nhermeneutics this way. It is not the reconstruction of artistic\nintention which forms the object of his inquiry but the question of\nwhat informs the immediacy of an artwork\u2019s claim. The artwork is\nan object of hermeneutical investigation not because of any provenance\nin psychological events but because of the fact that it says\nsomething to us (PH 98). Hermeneutic involvement is required because\nthe meaning transmitted can never be fully complete and unambiguous.\nIt demands interpretive involvement. Hermeneutics is required wherever\nthere is a restricted transposition of thought. The historical\nfinitude of meaning and the fact that no meaning can be given\ncompletely necessitates hermeneutical involvement in our experience of\nan artwork. The task of interpretation is to probe the possible\nmeanings held within the experience of a work, and by drawing on them,\nto bring that experience to greater completeness.\n\nIt should be noted that Gadamer\u2019s talk of integrating the alien\ninto what is understood as meaningful is not to be grasped as\nsubsumption within the same. Assimilation is not the equivalent of\ntranslating the alien into a stable set of meanings which do not\nchange as a consequence of that subsumption. Integration implies a\nreciprocity: the integrated changes its character as well as\nthe character of the whole within which integration occurs.\nFurthermore, whatever is given in subjective consciousness as\ncontemporaneous has dimensions of meaning that transcend what that\nconsciousness initially grasps. Gadamer is concerned to probe the\nontic dimensions of aesthetic experience. The thesis that experience\nof the contemporaneousness of art involves us in more than what we are\npresently aware of (i.e., the \u201csubstance\u201d of underlying\nand on-going trans-individual linguistic and cultural practices) is\nsupported by the three arguments from analogy concerning the character\nof play, the festival, and the symbol.\n4. Play\n\nGadamer\u2019s discussion of the relation between art and play should\nnot be equated with any argument that art is a trivial game or\npastime. He follows the precedent of Schiller\u2019s Letters on\nAesthetic Education, which contend that artworks are dramatic in\nthat they put something into play. The underlying motif is\nthat aesthetic consciousness is far from self-contained but is rather\ndrawn into the play of something much larger than what is evident to\nsubjective consciousness. The analogy with drama and, indeed, sporting\nevents, implies that art is eventual, an occasion that consciousness\nsurrenders to and participates in. Spectatorial participation (like\nmuch art research) demands immersion in that which cannot be fully\nanticipated or controlled by individual consciousness. The game and\nthe artwork are both forms of self-movement which require that the\nspectator play along with what they bring into being (RB 23). Gadamer\nasserts the \u201cprimacy of the play\u201d over consciousness:\n\u201cthe players are merely the way the play comes into\npresentation\u201d (TM 92, 98). Participation takes the individual\nplayers out of themselves. The individual subject is that upon which\nsuccess, satisfaction,\u00a0or loss is imposed from within the game.\nBy analogy, the work of art is also \u201cthe playing of it.\u201d\nAn autonomous event comes into being, something comes to stand in its\nown right which \u201cchanges all that stand before it\u201d (RB\n25). Like the ancient theoros, the spectator not only\nparticipates in the event which is the artwork\u00a0but is potentially\ntransformed by it (RB 24).\n\nThe game analogy also serves to undermine approaches to art which are\nexclusively intentional, material, and conventional. First: the\nsubjectivity of an artist cannot be an appropriate interpretive\nstarting point. Grasping what transpires in a player\u2019s\nconsciousness does not reveal the nature of the game being played.\nReconstructing the conscious life of an artist, pace\nDilthey\u2019s hermeneutics of nacherleben (re-living), may\nreveal interesting aspects of an artist\u2019s intentions, but it\ndoes not uncover what informs that subjectivity. Second: as with the\ngame, art is not to be understood by reference to its tools and\nequipment alone. Art, no doubt,\u00a0requires materials and an\nappreciation of how a specific tool might be used. Yet neither game\nnor art is constituted by its equipment. Third: comprehending a game\nor an artwork requires an appreciation of the appropriate rules or\nconventions. What constitutes fair or foul play depends upon a set of\npre-understood principles just as what is esteemed excellent in art\nrequires normative expectancies of appraisal. Yet art\u2019s vitality\nclearly does not reside merely in the following of conventions.\n\nThe overall argument is not that a game or an artwork cannot be\nreduced to intention, material, or convention but rather that each of\nthese elements comes into their own when taken up within the\nplaying of the game or in the practice which is art.\nIt is the playing that draws spectator, player, intention, equipment,\nand convention into the one event. This promotes an interactive view\nof art as a communicative event. It lends a dialogical dimension to\nart. An artwork involves more than one voice as, indeed, the word\ninter-pretation implies. Furthermore, the conception of art\nas an event requires a different ontological structure to those\nstandard accounts of aesthetic experience grounded in subjectivity\nalone. An artwork is not an object completely independent of the\nspectator yet somehow given over to the spectator for his or her\npersonal enjoyment. To the contrary, the game analogy suggests that\nthe act of spectatorship contributes to enhancing the being of the\nartwork by bringing what is at play within it to fuller realization.\nThe spectator just as much as the artist plays a crucial role in\ndeveloping the subject-matters that art activates. The aesthetic\nspectator is swept up by her experience of art, absorbed in its play,\nand potentially transformed by that which spectatorship helps\nconstitute. Though Gadamer\u2019s argument distances itself from\ntraditional subject-object paradigms, it does retain certain features\nof Kant\u2019s aesthetics. In other words, Gadamer\u2019s engagement\nwith Kantian aesthetics is a complicated matter. In Truth and\nMethod, Gadamer\u2019s tone vis-a-vis Kant\u2019s claims in the\nCritique of Judgment is at times polemical; however, his\nreading of Kant is not simply dismissive and critical but also\ninvolves creatively reworking many of Kant\u2019s insights. For\nexample, whereas Kant attributes a non-purposive rationality to the\naesthetic attitude, Gadamer attributes it to the playful process of\nart practice itself. Both art and the game share a to-and-fro movement\nnot tied to any specific goal other than to fulfil themselves for\ntheir own sake (TM 103): no one knows how a game will end and no one\nknows to what end an artwork works (Lawn 2006, 91). However, what is\nclear is that it is what occurs when the artwork or the game is\nin-play that matters. Often contrary to their own willing and doing,\nthe spectator is taken over by a substantial and consequential event\nthat transcends the boundaries of everyday consciousness and which has\nno purpose other than to bring something forth.\n\nPerhaps the most important difference between Kant\u2019s aesthetics\nand Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutical aesthetics is the latter\u2019s\nclaim that art communicates truth. In the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant argues that aesthetic ideas elude conceptual\ndetermination and linguistic capture. Such claims resonate with\nGadamer\u2019s view of art, as he contends that an artwork\u2019s\nmeaning cannot be conceptually exhaused. In other words, the artwork\nalways has an excess of meaning. However, unlike Kant, Gadamer affirms\nthat in our expeience of art, we are confronted with truths that have\nthe potential to foster greater self- and world-understanding. In\nshort, Gadamer maintains precisely what Kant denies \u2013 namely,\nGadamer claims that art is not separated from truth and\nknowledge but rather our experience of art as event discloses truth.\nAs Daniel L. Tate observes, Gadamer parts ways with Kant by insisting\nthat \u201cthe experience of art attests to a truth that\ncannot be exhaustively presented in terms of definitive\nknowledge\u201d (Tate 2009, 292). Another key difference between\nGadamer\u2019s and Kant\u2019s accounts is Gadamer\u2019s\nthematization of the spectator\u2019s active role. Gadamer\nstresses the active role of the spectator in his 1980 essay\n\u201cIntuition and Vividness\u201d (in RB, GW8) which can be\nunderstood as a further development of his reflections on spectatorial\nengagement in Truth and Method. In \u201cIntuition and\nVividness,\u201d written twenty years after the publication of\nTruth and Method, Gadamer reworks Kantian insights regarding\nthe formative or productive role of the imagination into his own\naccount of the spectator\u2019s creative and active\nparticipation in the artwork\u2019s coming to presence. For instance,\nhe claims that when the spectator lingers with an artwork, her\nimagination synthesizes the intuitions in which the presentation of a\nmeaningful whole emerges as a formed image. While this formed image is\nbrought into relation with the understanding and incites thought,\nneither it nor the entire formative process is determined by given\nconcepts; rather, as Tate points out, the formed image that comes to\nstand is originally constructed by the imagination (Tate\n2009, 292). The formed image enables engaged spectators to make\nconnections and draw conclusions that exceed their present experience.\nAs a result, art has the ability to present us with future, unrealized\npossibilities. Gadamer\u2019s creative reworking of Kantian\nimagination and aesthetic ideas underscores both the creative and\nformative abilities of the imagination vis-a-vis our experience of art\nand, importantly, the power of art\u2019s truths \u2013\n\u201ctruths that disclose the finitude of our being and our need for\nothers. In the dynamic, participatory event that art is, we are\ninvited \u2013 even provoked \u2013 to imagine ourselves, others,\nand our present world otherwise, which\u00a0is to imagine (and perhaps\neven hope for) a different (and better) future\u201d (Nielsen 2023,\n38).\n5. The Festival\n\nConventional accounts of aesthetic experience stress its intense and\nindividuating nature (Erlebnis). Yet despite its intimacy,\nGadamer emphasizes that within experience (Erfahrung) one is\nalways participating, perhaps unwittingly, in something beyond\noneself. Aesthetic involvement is in some respects, therefore, a\ncommunal activity. The analogy between aesthetic experience and the\nfestival or festive celebration is telling.\n\nWork is something that separates and divides us. For all the\ncooperation necessitated by joint enterprise and the division of labor\nin our productive activity, we are still divided as individuals as far\nas our day to day purposes are concerned. Festive celebration, on the\nother hand, is clearly distinguished by the fact that here we are not\nprimarily separated but rather gathered together. (RB 40)\n\n\nGadamer\u2019s thinking here betrays a further Kantian inflection.\nThe Kantian conception of aesthetic pleasure, as a variety of\nexperience which arises only where the egotistical interests that\nconstitute the commerce of everyday life are not in play, suggests the\npossibility of a community forming around shared non-hostile\npleasures. Gadamer\u2019s account of aesthetic experience is not\nconcerned with a putative kingdom-to-come but with rediscovering and\nforging the communality that we are. Despite this difference,\naesthetic experience establishes for both thinkers a meditative space\nin and through which something can be occasioned. The underlying point\nremains. Whereas for Kant\u00a0it is a change in the disposition of\nsubjective consciousness (i.e., its adoption of an aesthetic\nattitude) that initiates a better disposition towards the community,\nfor Gadamer it is the participation in a trans-subjective\nevent that effects a change in subjective dispositions towards\nthe community.\n\nWhen Gadamer argues that \u201cthe mystery of festive celebration\nlies in this suspension of time,\u201d he refers to how festivity\nsuspends work-time (RB 59). This initiates that festival\u00a0or\n\u201cfullfilled\u201d time in which another order of events emerges (RB 42). It\nis in such time that an artwork \u201ccomes to stand\u201d\nirrespective of whether it is a painting, drama, or symphony. The\nfestive \u201crepresents a genuine creation: something drawn from\nwithin ourselves takes shape before our eyes in a form that we\nrecognise and experience as a more profound presentation of our own\nreality\u201d (RB 60). This distances Gadamer from the view that\naesthetic experience is a solitary subject\u2019s personal response\nto an artwork. In the festive\u2014an analogy for the communal\ndimensions of aesthetic experience\u2014the individual subject comes\nto stand differently in its relationship to others. Just as the\nartwork comes to stand in the festival, so too does the artwork bring\nits spectators to stand as a community: \u201cin the festive the\ncommunal spirit that supports us all and transcends each of us\nindividually\u201d\u00a0discloses the real power of both the festive\nand the work of art (RB 63).\u00a0The festival occasions individuals\nsurpassing their everyday view of themselves as potentially hostile\ncompetitors and coming to see themselves as a community formed around\na shared interest in what the artwork brings forth. This is an analogy\nfor something more fundamental.\n\nInstrumentalist conceptions of language persuade us that the spoken\nand written word are but communicative tools, but for Gadamer\nparticipation in language acknowledges that an individual is located\nwithin a substantive horizon of meanings which transcends subjective\nconsciousness. Pragmatic concerns encourage the forgetting of such\ninterconnectedness but when such individualism is suspended by the\nfestival or, indeed, by the adoption of a hermeneutically-attuned\naesthetic attitude, the re-discovery of oneself as belonging to an\nextensive community of shared meanings and involvements becomes\npossible. The artwork\u2019s communicative capacity awakens the\nrealization that in as much as I understand myself as being addressed,\nI must acknowledge that I already belong to something larger than\nmyself. The artwork festivises: it reveals our personal\nindebtedness to past and future communities of meaning. The thesis\nthat we belong to a hermeneutic collective which is the effective\nunderpinning of art\u2019s ability to communicate is further\nelaborated in Gadamer\u2019s discussion of the symbol.\n6. The Symbol\n\nA discussion of the symbol forms the third aspect of Gadamer\u2019s\ncase that aesthetic experience involves an ex-stasis of the\naesthetic subject. It provides a further analogue for the speculative\ndimension of aesthetic experience. The word \u201csymbol\u201d is a\nGreek term for a token of remembrance (tessera hospitalis)\nthat could be broken in two so that should a descendent of a former\nguest enter his house, the co-joined pieces would kindle into an act\nof recognition. (RB 31). The symbol connotes (explicitly) what we\nrecognise implicitly (RB 31). It is associated with the fragmentary\nand a promise of completeness which \u201cin turn alludes to beauty\nand the potentially whole and holy order of things\u201d (RB 32). The\nsymbol is associated, then, with notions of repetition and the hope\nfor an abundance of meaning. Its connection with the speculative is\nbest appreciated by reference to the sign.\n\nIf the sign\u2019s proper function is to refer to its referent, it is\nself-cancelling. The road sign that is so attractive that it distracts\nfrom the danger it refers to and causes a new one by prompting drivers\nto pull up and admire it, does not function properly. The symbol,\nhowever, does not refer to something outside itself. It presents its\nown meaning. The material symbol is, indeed, the place where that\nmeaning becomes present. Yet the symbolically delivered meaning is\nnever given completely. Its meaning is indeterminate. References to\nthe symbol as fragmentary nevertheless anticipate the possibility of\nwholeness. The speculative dimension of such reasoning resides in the\npremise that every stated meaning involves bringing forth\nmore than is actually spoken. Resonance and depth depends\nupon animating the statement\u2019s hermeneutic Hintergrund,\nlighting up unstated meanings or revealing anticipated ones. The\n\u201cspeculative\u201d capacity of an image or word concerns its\nability to sound out or insinuate the unstated nexus of meanings which\nsustain a given expression but which are not directly given in it. The\nspeculative power of an image or phrase has something in common with\nthe sublime: it illuminates in the spoken or visual image a penumbra\nof unstated meanings whose presence can be sensed but never fully\ngrasped or conceptualised. Hence, an artwork can always mean more\n\u2013 that is, insinuate a transcendent dimension of meaning, which\nthough never exhausted by the symbols that carry it, do not exist\napart from the symbols that sustain it. The symbol is resonant with\nthe suggestion of meaning because it constantly invokes what is not\nimmediately given. This not-given does not exist apart from the given\nbut is inherent within it. Hence, the hermeneutical sublime, the\nexcess of meaning, the promise of meaning more and meaning something\ndifferent which is made apparent by the symbol, is held within, is\nimmanent in the given.\n7. Presentation, Representation and Appearance\n\nGadamer\u2019s account of the symbol establishes that artworks are\npresentational rather than representational. Presentations occasion\nthe meanings they invoke and do not represent a meaning independent of\nthemselves. The argument effects a profound and significant change in\nthe meaning of aesthetic appearance. The representational view of art\nrelegates art to a secondary status: the artwork brings to mind\nsomething other than the artwork, an original state of affairs, a\nspecific meaning or reality. Art\u2019s objective co-relative is,\naccordingly, positioned outside the work so that the work becomes the\nmere appearance of something else. The presentational account of art\nis consistent with Gadamer\u2019s phenomenological orientation. If\nthe meaning invoked by a work is not independent of the work that\nsummons it, the work is the occasion of the coming-into-appearance of\nthat meaning. Appearing becomes synonymous with original creation.\nAesthetic appearance is not secondary to reality or truth but is the\nmedium through which the work\u2019s truth shows/presents itself.\nEven as presentation, appearance does retain a certain negativity,\nthough in Gadamer\u2019s hands it has a positive quality. Appearance\nalways hints at a semblance of something incomplete or not yet fully\nrealized. Gadamer\u2019s ontology openly reinforces if not requires\nsuch negativity. The claim that each artwork has its own temporality\nimplies that each will never reveal itself completely. The claim that\nthe reception of all art is contemporaneous dictates that what appears\nto us as meaningful is not necessarily what appeared to a previous\ngeneration as meaningful. Like the symbol, appearance is always\npartial. However, appearance, when considered aesthetically, has the\ncadence of the symbolic: it alludes to something beyond itself but\nwhich nevertheless inheres within it as the yet-to-be-revealed.\n\nSuch arguments support Gadamer\u2019s conception of the artwork as\nthat which stands-in-itself. That which comes to stand is intelligible\nas the presentation of a certain meaning, but because of the\nindeterminacy of that meaning it retains something of the enigmatic.\nThis eminent quality\u2014a genuine work can never be measured\nagainst the original way it was shown (RB 146)\u2014Gadamer also\nrefers to as its hermeneutic identity. The truth of an artwork is not\nits simple manifestation of meaning but rather the unfathomableness\nand depth of its meaning (PH 226). Its truth embraces a tension\nbetween revelation (what appears) and what is concealed (what has yet\nto be shown). The artwork does not simply offer \u201ca recognizable\nsurface contour\u201d but has an inner depth of self-sufficiency\nwhich Gadamer calls after Heidegger a\n\u201cstanding-in-itself.\u201d In short, the mark of a substantial\nwork is that it veils possibilities of meaning. Such resistance is a\nstimulus to further interpretation. Substantive works, like\nsignificant symbols, have an opaque aspect.\n\nThe symbol and its reticence about revealing the withheld aspects of\nits meaning do not connote something utterly alien to us. The\nyet-to-be revealed is a dimension of meaning overlooked, forgotten, or\nnot perceived within what has already been shown or grasped. In other\nwords, the power of the symbol resides in its ability to reveal that,\nunbeknown to ourselves, we are in communion with something much larger\nthan ourselves \u2013 that is, horizons of meaning which implicitly\nsustain reflection and which can, when made explicit, bring us to\nthink quite differently of ourselves. The mystery of the symbol is its\npromise of transcendence: an effective and affecting symbol reveals\nthat we belong to a hermeneutic community always larger than we\nenvisage. The analogy of the festival, once again, is telling. In the\nfestival, individuated work roles are renounced as we rediscover\ncommunal ties. Gadamer\u2019s arguments about play, festival, and\nsymbol serve, then, as the basis for his claim that aesthetic\nexperience, our experience of art, is a demonstrable instance of how\nsubjectivity is informed by a substantiality that transcends an\nindividual consciousness.\n8. The Issue in Question\n\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics involve a variety of interlocking\narguments, one of the most significant of which concerns\ndie\u00a0Sache selbst. The term is difficult to\ntranslate, but it refers, loosely speaking, to a work\u2019s\nsubject-matter, to what it addresses or to what issue has been placed\nin question. Philosophical usage of the word evokes phenomenological\nnotions of intentionality: what a work is directed at or points\ntoward. The Sache is not a determinate concept but an area of\nsignificant meaningfulness, a constellation of concerns which orbit\nthe affective, conative, and cognitive complexities of subject-matters\nsuch as grief or love. The Sache underpins Gadamer\u2019s\nclaim that aesthetic experience has a significant cognitive content.\nSubject-matters may transcend an individual work in that no one work\ncan exhaust their significance, but as ideas, Sachen are not\nindependent of the body of works that exemplify them. If they were\nontologically distinct, the idealism Gadamer rejects would be forced\non him, and he would be compelled to argue that art is\nrepresentational, refers to a concept beyond itself and, indeed,\ndisappears into that concept once evoked. Hence, art, in this way of\nunderstanding, becomes philosophy once more. If, however, art is\npresentation, as Gadamer insists, a work\u2019s meaning is not\nindependent of it. Art does not, therefore, copy and thereby represent\na subject-matter, but configures a visual or literary space in which a\nsubject-matter can be summoned. Gadamer counters an ancient line of\nargument that regards art as secondary to, inferior to, and a\ncorrupter of, the real. Contrary to the Platonic tradition, his\nargument implies that art adds to the reality of its\nsubject-matters. Gadamer\u2019s evaluation of the aesthetic contrasts\nvividly with Kant\u2019s in this respect. Kant considers aesthetic\nexperience to be indifferent to whether or not its object is real (cf.\nTM 89). A work\u2019s credibility does not depend on its relationship\nto an original object or co-relative. Whether what is represented\nexists or not is inconsequential. What matters is the aesthetic merit\nof the work, not the strength of its likeness. Should the artwork be\nharmed, the being of the correlative is unaffected. Gadamer\u2019s\npresentational aesthetics is, by contrast, in this regard profoundly\nanti-Platonic and anti-Kantian: for Gadamer a work\u2019s\ndisappearance diminishes the reality of that which presents itself\nthrough it.\n\nAlthough subject-matters transcend the individual works which embody\nthem, they do not exist apart from their historical embodiments.\nMoreover, unlike Platonic forms, subject-matters do not transcend\nhistory but mutate and develop ever new permutations. Any diminishment\nof art diminishes the historical effectiveness of a given\nsubject-matter. Were John Donne\u2019s love poems all lost, our\nunderstanding of the exquisite joys and pains of human love would be\nirreparably diminished. A semi-Platonic argument about\nmimesis reinforces a discernibly non-Platonic argument\nconcerning the historically fluid character of subject-matters. The\nargument that artworks direct us to a subject-matter irrespective of\nwhether they be realist or abstract constructions, suggests a moment\nof return and repetition. An issue, question, or subject-matter is\nrecognized.\n\nWhere something is recognized it has liberated itself from the\nuniqueness and contingency of the circumstances in which it was\nencountered. It is a matter\u00a0neither of there and then, nor of\nhere and now but it is encountered as the very self-same. Thereby it\nbegins to rise to its permanent essence and is detached from anything\nlike a chance encounter. (RB 120)\n\n\nThis passage strengthens the presentational approach to art, but its\nreference to essences requires clarification.\n\nIt is part of the process of recognition that we see things in terms\nof what is permanent and essential unencumbered by the contingent\ncircumstances in which they were seen before and are seen again. What\nimitation reveals is the real essence of the thing. (RB 99)\n\n\nIt is not suggested that we see repeatedly the same essence\nin a work of art. Were this to be suggested, works would become dull\nand uninformative and make no new contribution to a genre.\nGadamer\u2019s insistence is that works should speak directly to and,\nindeed, transform our self-understanding. Such transformative power\nimplies recognising in a work what was previously understood of a\nsubject-matter, but transformed, as if seen for the first time. The\nlife of a subject-matter is one of change and development.\nGadamer\u2019s mimesis argument claims that through repeated\nre-working and re-interpretation a subject-matter not only accrues\nmore aspects, but also, in so doing, they allow that subject-matter to\nbecome more fully what it is. \u201cA work of art belongs so closely\nto what it is related to that it enriches the being of that as if\nthrough a new event of being\u201d (TM 147). The \u201cjoy of\nrecognition is rather the joy of knowing more than is already\nfamiliar.\u201d Artworks allow subject-matters to become more what\nthey are. In conclusion, Gadamer\u2019s phenomenological aesthetics\neffectively destroys the Platonic separation of art and reality.\nArtworks are the sites in which the trans-individual both present and\ntransform themselves. Whereas, as we have seen, for Kant the\ndestruction of an artwork has absolutely no bearing upon the\nobjectivities it represents, we can now understand why Gadamer is\ncommitted to the opposing view that the destruction of an artwork\ndiminishes the reality of the subject-matters that come forth through\nit.\n9. Art and Language\n\nThe strategic centrality of language in Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics is\nbeyond doubt. The ability of artworks to bring things to mind and to\nhint at unseen meanings is reason to claim that in its speculative\ncapacities, art functions essentially like a language. Yet he\nacknowledges that linguistic means of expression are inadequate to the\ntask of conveying what occurs within an experience of art.\n\nLanguage often seems ill-suited to express what we feel. In the face\nof the overwhelming presence of works of art, the task of expressing\nin words what they say to us seems like an infinite and hopeless\nundertaking \u2026 One says this, and then one hesitates (TM 401).\n\n\nTwo claims underwrite this skepticism: words do not readily capture\nthe sheer complexity of aesthetic experience, and the finitude of\nlanguage itself prevents it from capturing the totality of such\nexperience. In other words, the experience of art always just eludes\ntheoretical containment. These are not difficulties with language\nper se, but rather reflect the limited capacity of the human\nmind to grasp the totality of its involvements. Yet in Gadamer\u2019s\nthought these negative aspects incentivize further hermeneutic\ninvolvement in aesthetic experience. The incompleteness of any\ninterpretation of an artwork opens us to the possibility that there is\nalways something more or something else that can be said. The temporal\nnature of experience and its interpretation prevent closure or, in\nother words, both are by nature always open to further ways of\nthinking and speaking about art. The argument reinforces the claim\nthat art and its interpretation extend the being of the\nsubject-matters addressed and, furthermore, that aesthetic experience\nitself has a temporal continuity which is linked to its cumulative\ncharacter as a mode of Bildung.\n\nThe issue about the relationship between art and language is not one\nof linguistic capture but of finding the appropriate words to open the\ncontent of aesthetic experience. What is meant by the notion that an\nartwork addresses us with a meaning? Although an agent of the\nlinguistic turn of the twentieth century, Gadamer\u2019s reflections\non language run counter to many semiotic theories. According to\nWeinsheimer, \u201cthe dualism of signifier and signified has no\nphenomenological basis\u201d for Gadamer \u201csince in speaking we\nhave no awareness of the world as being distinct from the word\u201d\n(Weinsheimer 1993, 162). Gadamer speaks of the perfection of the word\nas being the disappearance of any gap between sense and utterance.\nPoetry would be the \u201cparadigm case\u201d of an artwork with a\nclear and immediate presentation of meaning. Yet this is seemingly\ninconsistent with the notion of a work that\n\u201cstands-in-itself.\u201d If aspects of its meaning are\nwithheld, sense and utterance are once again separated. The word, it\nwould appear, signifies something beyond itself after all. There is,\nin other words, a tension between Gadamer wanting to hold that the\nwork of art and the world that comes forth within it are indivisible\nand saying that the world which a work invokes is larger than the work\nitself. The poetic word, insofar as it is poetic, stands-in-itself;\nand yet as word it invokes something beyond itself. Gadamer\u2019s\nspeculative account of meaning collapses, it would seem, into a\nreferential account of signs. Speculatively charged words refer to\nother signs or patterns of meaning beyond themselves. This suggests\nthat words are self-negating signs: when they function as they should,\nthey disappear into what it is referred to. To conclude that words\noperate as representational signs seems quite contrary to the account\nof art functioning in the manner of a symbol. Closer inspection\nsuggests that Gadamer\u2019s account of the speculative account of\nmeaning is presentational after all. Let us restate the question.\n\nIf the artwork is an autonomous entity that stands-in-itself and does\nnot refer to anything outside itself, what of art\u2019s speculative\ncapacity to refer to other complexes beyond its immediate horizon? The\ntheological notion of a host can dissolve the inconsistency. On the\none hand, for an artwork to have a speculative capacity, it must\ninvoke perimeters of meaning which transcend its own immediate\ncircumstance. Without this, an artwork cannot connect us with\nframeworks of otherness. Yet this argument threatens to turn\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics into an idealism referring specifically to\nthe idea which the artwork was invoking. Art would once again\nbe subordinated to a vehicle of philosophy. On the other hand, there\nis something within the constitution of an artwork that makes it\nresist theoretical reduction. Its invocation of an excess of meaning\nresists conceptual capture. This brings us to the crux of the matter.\nDoes the excess of meaning which a work can speculatively invoke exist\napart from the work that summons them? The speculative dimensions of\nart suggest that an artwork is indeed a host for that which lies\nbeyond it and yet, at the same time, the transcendent dimensions of\nmeaning (its excess of meaning), remain immanent within the work that\ninvokes them. The presence of that which transcends the work only\nmanifests itself through the work that hosts it. To\nput it another way, it is in the work that the transcendent\u00a0set\nof meanings achieves its presence. The full resonance of a\nsubject-matter, which of course extends well beyond any one work, is\nnevertheless only discernible in the works that host them. Indeed,\nsubject-matters do not exist apart from the works that manifest their\npresence. Ontologically speaking they inhere within the work. The work\nis the occasion in which these dimensions of meaning appear, and they\ncommand the attention of the viewer so long as the work holds them in\nplay. In other words, with regard to the tension between\nrepresentation and presentation in Gadamer\u2019s position, the\nspeculative charge of artworks does indeed suggest that they function\nas representational signs always referring beyond the given meaning.\nYet this is another way of saying that, ontologically speaking,\nartworks function as symbols. Considered as a referential sign, what\nthe artwork refers to is not a world independent of the sign but\nanother set of signs. However, such other configurations of meaning\nmay mean more than the signs that invoke them, but they are inherent\nwithin those very signs. In other words, the very signs which refer\nspeculatively to other dimensions of meaning also function\nsymbolically in that the other horizons of meaning invoked are\nimmanent within the work\u2019s autonomy. As a symbolic host, the\nartwork holds that which refers beyond itself within itself.\n10. Tradition\n\nArt seems to solve the riddle of the temporal core of truth (Adorno).\nA work that proves itself a \u201cclassic\u201d through the ages and\nremains constant in its effect remains binding, no matter how the\ninterpretations and the criteria of evaluation change in the course of\ntime. (Habermas quoted by Krajewski 2004, 20)\n\n\nWhat binds us to a tradition, according to Gadamer, is not a misplaced\nconservatism but the questions a canon or body of work asks of us.\nHowever, the question of tradition is one of the most controversial\nwithin Gadamer\u2019s philosophy. It arises because of the way\nGadamer establishes individual and collective learning on the\nacquisition of accrued experiences (Bildung) and practices,\nrather than upon any methodological norm. His argument exposes the\nEnlightenment prejudice against prejudice. The liberating and\nuniversalizing aspects of reason tend to marginalize and chastise both\nthe culturally different and the historically particular as divisive\nand irrational. Gadamer contends, however, that such an unqualified\nhypostasization of reason and its methods has the unfortunate\nconsequence of condemning as methodologically groundless the very\nvaluations that ordinary linguistic and experiential practices are\nbased on. Gadamer is not unsympathetic to Nietzsche, who rejects the\nclaim that humanity is shaped by external necessity. Our existence\nwithin the world and our place within it is, metaphysically speaking,\nutterly contingent. If there is no metaphysical necessity that governs\nhuman practices, why should we even ask for a methodological\ngrounding, when language has neither required nor functioned with such\na license? Like Wilhelm Dilthey before him, Gadamer insists that\nnothing justifies and gives meaning to life other than life itself.\nThis is not the invocation of nihilism, for life does not occur in a\nvacuum. Creatures such as humans, which have no pre-determined\nessence, only survive by both remembering what has worked well within\na practice and by constantly testing it against contemporary needs and\ncircumstances. There is a constant tension between acquired experience\nand the need to stabilize its lessons and the need to question and\nthereby destabilize the tried and the tested. All expressive practices\ndepend upon an inheritance of insight and valuation. They are\ndependent upon accrued learning and experience. Such observations\nagitate Gadamer\u2019s critics, who see in the unreflective\nacceptance of the given an irresponsibly conservative privileging of\nthe received, and a wilful blindness to possible repressive or\nexclusionary practices within inherited modes of operation. In\nresponse to such scepticism, it must be acknowledged that inherited\npractices can, logically speaking, have negative entailments. However,\na commitment to tradition, is neither a commitment to remaining the\nsame, nor is it indicative of a willful refusal to confront the\nnegative entailments within what is transmitted historically.\nTraditions which are incapable of changing risk becoming outmoded.\nTraditions are not founded upon core and fixed identities. As vibrant\nreligious and artistic traditions demonstrate, those which are in\nconstant debate over aim and direction often prove engaging and\ninfluential. Traditions capable of subjecting their self-understanding\nto critique constitute continuities of conflict. The importance of\nreceived understanding for Gadamer is not its historical provenance\nbut how it opens us towards and engages us with issues in a community\nof debate. The Cartesian project of subjecting all beliefs to\nsceptical examination until they can be methodologically affirmed is,\nin Gadamer\u2019s view, nihilistic. The project is implausible since\nthe range and depth of pre-understanding is so extensive as to be\nuntheorisable. To condemn pre-understanding as unjustifiable because\nit cannot be methodologically grounded is highly dangerous as it\ndevalues those very insights upon which our initial world-orientation\ndepends. It is not that these insights are instrinsically valuable but\nthat they are essential staging posts in the journeys of understanding\nthey enable. It is the continuous debate and dialogue over practice\nthat enables participants to move on, widen, and transform acquired\nexperience. Movement and development is intrinsic to the German word\nfor tradition: \u00dcberlieferung has the active connotation\nof both transmitting and handing something on. What a tradition\ntransmits from age to age are questions, problems, and issues. The\nimportance of canonic works is not that they are peerless exemplars of\nan idiom or style but rather that they raise issues and difficulties\nin an exemplary way. Traditions can check their self-understanding\nagainst their own historical projections. A commitment to tradition is\nnot a commitment to an academic antiquarianism. It is, essentially, a\ncommitment to a field of debate. Tradition is presented as a resource\nand a provocation for thinking and creativity: whereas sameness is the\ncurrency of a conservative conception of tradition, instability,\nquestions, and the challenge of otherness are the drivers of\nGadamer\u2019s more dialogical concept of tradition.\n\nIt has been argued against Gadamer that his revaluation of tradition\ndoes not really bring its content to a point of critical reflection.\nHe acknowledges that like any other temporal phenomenon, not all of\nits vistas can be adequately thematized or articulated. This does not\nmean, however, that tradition is beyond critical appraisal. Traditions\ncan, as Pannenberg argues, check their normative assumptions against\ntheir self-projections. Other critics suggest that Gadamer\u2019s\napproach to tradition and aesthetics is overtly Classical in its\npreoccupation with forms that maintain a continuity through time\nrather than radically alter themselves. It does not allow for those\nradical intrusions or revolutionary interjections which alter the\nperceptual paradigm of an age. The counter-objection is not only that\nthe charge overlooks Gadamer\u2019s embrace of Heidegger\u2019s\nquite radical phenomenological reworking of the Classical\ntradition\u00a0but also the fact that for one paradigm to replace\nanother, there must be a certain relation between them. One must\naddress an absence, fullfil an unseen possibility or a lack within the\nother. Cubism, for example, implies a visual orientation quite\ndifferent from realism, but both idioms belong to a common tradition\nin that they strive to show us something of the real. Without a degree\nof continuity with tradition, any radical emergence would have no\nbearing upon the received and thereby lack the ability to call into\nquestion received notions and understanding. It is, however, precisely\nthe challenge of the different and the other which is the driver of\nGadamer\u2019s dialogical conception of tradition. It is a conception\nwhich is in part modernistic: tradition is presented as being in\nconstant debate with itself. Its renewal demands change and\ntransformation. Furthermore, a virtue of this dialogical conception of\ntradition is that it is not culturally specific. Because its main\nfocus is on the subject-matters which different cultural practices\naddress, it offers a model of cognitive engagement that can operate\nbetween distinct traditions rather than in just any one.\n11. Paradox of the In-between\n\nThere is a creative tension at play within Gadamer\u2019s aesthetic\nthinking. On the one hand, Gadamer stalwartly defends the autonomy of\nthe artwork and, on the other, despite his resistance to any\nsubsumption of art within philosophy, he insists that aesthetics\nshould be absorbed within hermeneutics, which has\u00a0for the most\npart been understood as a theoretical enterprise. This tension\nreplicates aspects of the so-called hermeneutic circle.\nSchleiermacher, for example, argues that it is only possible to grasp\nan individual\u2019s personal utterances if one can understand the\ngeneral structure of the language which that individual operates\nwithin. Conversely, general structures are only intelligible in terms\nof particular exemplifying utterances. Wilhelm Dilthey operates within\na similar part-whole structure\u2013\u2013namely, an\nindividual\u2019s personal experiences will mean little to the reader\nunless they can be contextualised within a historical context. A\nmovement between part and whole also takes place in Gadamer\u2019s\nthinking. The artwork is initially presented in its singularity. But\nthen, the particular is illuminated by being brought under a\nsubject-matter. To engage with artworks discursively is to bring\ngeneralizations about a work to bear, placing it in a wider context of\nassociations. The movement to the wider level of generalization also\nreturns the spectator to the particular, since generalization enables\nan understanding of what is singular about a work by locating it\nwithin a broader background. This double hermeneutic movement is\nhighly characteristic of Gadamer\u2019s aesthetic. It recognises that\nthe cognitive dimension of aesthetic experience is, like all\nlinguistic experience, both centrifugal and centripetal in nature.\nWhen a work addresses us its impact is centrifugal: it upsets and\ntransforms what we customarily recognise. It awakens us to the\nhermeneutical sublime, to what lies beyond but nevertheless shapes our\nnormal range of understanding. Thus, Gadamer can argue\nthat\u00a0\u201csomething is a poetic structure when everything\npre-structured is taken up into a new, unique form \u2026 as if it\nwere being said for the first time to us in particular\u201d (GW 8,\n62). Yet this estranging moment initiates a centripetal return, a\nhomecoming. \u201cThe poem and the art of language generally as a\nheard or written text is always \u2026 something like a recognition\nin every single word\u201d (GW 8, 62). Yet the question remains: is\nthe passage from the immediacy of the given artwork to theoretical\ncontemplations about its subject matter not an instance of moving from\nthe particular givenness of a work to a more abstract level of\nreflection about its subject-matter? Does not the contemplative\nmovement away from the work betray its particularity and suggest that\nthe sense of a work lies beyond it in its concept? Were Gadamer to\nhave fallen into this impasse, an idealist and\nrepresentationalist account of art would be forced upon him. The\nvehemence of his resistance to these stances suggests that something\nother than a simple shift from the particular immediacy of a work to a\ntheoretical contemplation of its content must be at play.\n\nThe accusation of inconsistency requires the assumption that the\naesthetic experience of a work, on the one hand, and its\ncontemplation, on the other, are separable. However, it is in\nGadamer\u2019s mind part of an intense experience that it impels us\ntowards seeking to bring it into words. Experience endeavours to bring\nitself into words. These words will by virtue of their semantic\nassociations place the experience in a wider context (the centrifugal)\nand at the same time these words will, because of their poetic\ncapacity for singularity, make the experience clearer and more\ndistinct.\n\nExperience is not wordless to begin with, subsequently becoming an\nobject of reflection by being named, by being subsumed under the\nuniversality of the word. Rather experience itself seeks and finds\nwords that express it. We seek the right word\u2014i.e., the word\nthat really belongs to the thing (or experience) so that in it the\nthing comes into language. (TM 417)\n\n\nThis suggests that Gadamer is not applying a hermeneutic method to\naesthetic experience but seeking to expose the hermeneutical movement\nfrom part to whole within aesthetic experience. In other\nwords, the claim that aesthetics should be taken up within\nhermeneutics is not an attempt to reduce aesthetics to another idiom.\nIt announces an endeavor to articulate the hermeneutic dynamic of\naesthetic experience itself. Let us briefly recapitulate the\nargument.\n\nThe tension in Gadamer\u2019s position arises from (1) asserting\nart\u2019s autonomy and (2) demanding that aesthetics be subsumed\nwithin hermeneutics. Undoubtedly, the weight of argument is on the\nlatter. He systematically criticizes Kantian aesthetics for its\nnarrow-minded concentration on the subjectivity of momentary pleasures\nand offers in its place a substantial reconstruction of the cognitive\ncontent of art\u2019s address. In other words, Gadamer switches the\nstatus of autonomy from the sensible irreducibility of a work to its\nhermeneutic autonomy. This entails the argument that a work which\nchallenges our outlook does so because it is enigmatic by nature: it\ngives rise to difficulties of meaning and interpretation which cannot\nbe explained away by a more fundamental level of understanding. The\nautonomous work that stands in itself is a work that both\npresents a meaning and at the same time holds\nsomething back. It is in other words always pointing beyond\nitself but within itself. This substantiates Gadamer\u2019s\nclaim that the hermeneutical constitution of an autonomous work\nresists theoretical reduction. In the essay \u201cWord and\nPicture,\u201d he expresses sympathy with Schleiermacher\u2019s\nremark, \u201cI hate all theory that does not grow out of\npractice\u201d (GW 8, 374). However, as has been argued, the\ntranscendent dimensions of meaning which a work speculatively invokes\nare not outside the work but immanent within it. In other words, we do\nnot need a special hermeneutic method to access the withheld but just\na deeper, more attentive contemplative acquaintance. When Gadamer\nspeaks of being attentive to what an artwork says, of discerning its\nenigmatic quality, and of becoming aware of its speculative\nresonances, he is indeed speaking in a hermeneutical idiom, but this\nis most clearly not a case of Gadamer submitting aesthetic experience\nto an externally derived theory. To the contrary, Gadamer is trying to\ndraw out the hermeneutical dynamics of aesthetic experience itself.\nThus the tension between the immediacy of experience and reflection\nupon the content of that experience is not a tension between\nexperience, on the one hand, and theory on the other. It is a tension\nwithin aesthetic experience between what an artwork invokes of its\nsubject-matter and how what is invoked changes the character of that\nwhich invokes it. What hermeneutical reflection reveals of aesthetic\nexperience is nothing extraneous to such experience but a further\ndisclosure of what is held within it. To conclude, if aesthetic\nexperience is hermeneutical in that artworks speculatively illuminate\nmeanings beyond what is immediately disclosed, hermeneutical\nexperience should equally be taken up by aesthetics in that\nsubject-matters only manifest their presence in the singular and\nparticular.\n",
