    "main_text": "Mechanism and Synthesis || Confirmation of Reaction Mechanisms\n5.2 Confirmation of Reaction Mechanisms\n\nChemists typically do not engage in philosophical discussions about\ntheir work. Yet, when discussing the confirmation of reaction\nmechanisms, it is not uncommon to see mention of philosophical issues\nsurrounding confirmation. So why does the study of reaction mechanisms\nmake chemists more philosophically reflective?\n\nFor one thing, almost all studies aimed at elucidating reaction\nmechanisms rely on indirect techniques. Ideally, elucidating a\nreaction mechanism would be like doing experiments in biomechanics.\nSlow motion video could give direct information about the movement of\nparts and how these movements give rise to the motion of the whole.\nBut we have nothing like a video camera for chemical reactions.\nInstead, after an experimental determination of the reaction products\nand possible isolation of stable intermediate species, chemists rely\non measurements of reaction rates in differing conditions,\nspectroscopy, and isotopic labeling, among other techniques. These\ntechniques help eliminate candidate reaction mechanisms, but do not\nthemselves directly suggest new ones. This emphasis on eliminating\npossibilities has led some chemists to endorse a Popperian,\nfalsificationist analysis of reaction mechanism elucidation (e.g.,\nCarpenter 1984).\n\nAlthough some chemists have been attracted to a falsificationist\nanalysis, a better analysis of reaction mechanism elucidation is the\naccount of confirmation known as eliminative induction. This\naccount shares falsification\u2019s emphasis on trying to reject\nhypotheses, but argues that the hypotheses not rejected receive some\ndegree of confirmation. So in the case of reaction mechanisms, we\nmight see eliminative induction as a processes whereby chemists:\n\nEnumerate reasonable candidates for the reaction mechanism.\nConsider the experimental consequences of these mechanisms,\ndrawing up lists of reaction conditions under which the mechanism\ncould be tested.\nDevise experiments which differentially evaluate at least two\nhypotheses for a given set of background conditions.\nPerform these experiments, rejecting reaction mechanisms\nhypotheses that are shown to be inconsistent with the experimental\nresults.\n\n\nIn following this procedure, chemists do more than simply falsify:\nthey add confirmatory power to the mechanisms that haven\u2019t been\neliminated. Indeed, in discussing similar issues, biochemist John\nPlatt (1964) argued that good scientific inference is strong\ninference, whereby the goal in an experiment is to eliminate one\nor more hypotheses. Several contemporary philosophers have endorsed\nthe role of eliminative induction in science (e.g., Bird 2010, Dorling\n1995, Kitcher 1993, Norton 1995). It is easy to see how it can be\nmodeled in Bayesian and other quantitative frameworks for\nconfirmation. Specifically, as particular candidate reaction\nmechanisms are eliminated, the probability that one of the remaining\nmechanisms is correct goes up (see Earman 1992 for details).\n\nOne difficulty with eliminative induction is the source of the\nrelevant alternative hypotheses, in this case reaction mechanisms.\nThere is no algorithmic procedure for generating these mechanisms, and\nthere is always the possibility that the correct mechanism has not\nbeen considered at all. This is a genuine problem, and we believe that\nit is the very issue that motivates chemists to turn towards\nfalsification when thinking about mechanisms; all they can do is\nevaluate the plausible mechanisms that they have thought of. However,\nwe see eliminative induction as a more plausible reflection of the\nepistemic situation of mechanistic chemists. This problem is not\nuncertainty about mechanisms compatible with\nexperiments\u2014chemists have evidence that weighs in favor of\nthose. Rather, the problem is with unconceived alternatives. Structure\noffers one way to delineate such mechanistic possibilities: Hoffmann\n(1997, Chapter 29) provides a beautiful example of explicitly\neliminative reasoning in his discussion of how H. Okabe and J. R.\nMcNesby used isotopic labelling to eliminate two out of three possible\nmechanisms for the photolysis of ethane to ethylene. But this is an\nissue in all parts of science, not just mechanistic chemistry, and\neliminative induction has always played a role in chemists\u2019 reasoning\nabout structure. How did van \u2019t Hoff argue for the tetrahedral\ncarbon atom? He argued first that it was possible to account for the\nobserved number and variety of the isomers of certain organic\nsubstances only by taking into account the arrangement of atoms in\nspace. He then defended a tetrahedral geometry for the carbon atom by\nrejecting a square planar arrangement: if carbon\u2019s geometry were\nsquare planar, there would be more isomers of substituted methane than\nare observed. Thus, for instance, disubstituted methane (of the form\nCH2X2) should have two separable isomers if it\nis square planar, whereas only one can be found. Assuming a\ntetrahedral arrangement, in contrast, would be in accord with the\nobserved number of isomers (Brock 1992).\n",
