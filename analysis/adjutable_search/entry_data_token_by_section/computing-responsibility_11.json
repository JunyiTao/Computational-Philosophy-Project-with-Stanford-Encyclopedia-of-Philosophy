    "main_text": "Rethinking the concept of moral responsibility || Responsibility as practice\n4. Conclusion\n\nComputer technologies have challenged conventional conceptions of\nmoral responsibility and have raised questions about how to distribute\nresponsibility appropriately. Can human beings still be held\nresponsible for the behavior of complex computer technologies that\nthey have limited control over or understanding of? Are human beings\nthe only agents that can be held morally responsible or can the\nconcept of moral agent be extended to include artificial computational\nentities? In response to such questions philosophers have reexamined\nthe concepts of moral agency and moral responsibility. Although there\nis no clear consensus on what these concepts should entail in an\nincreasingly digital society, what is clear from the discussions is\nthat any reflection on these concepts will need to address how these\ntechnologies affect human action and where responsibility for action\nbegins and ends.\n",
