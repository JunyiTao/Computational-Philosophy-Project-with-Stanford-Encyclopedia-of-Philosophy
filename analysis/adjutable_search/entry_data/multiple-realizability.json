    "preamble": "\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, the multiple realizability thesis contends\nthat a single mental kind (property, state, event) can be realized by\nmany distinct physical kinds. A common example is pain. Many\nphilosophers have asserted that a wide variety of physical properties,\nstates, or events, sharing no features in common at that level of\ndescription, can all realize the same pain. This thesis served as a\npremise in the most influential argument against early theories that\nidentified mental states with brain states (psychoneural, or\nmind-brain identity theories). It also served in early arguments for\nfunctionalism. Nonreductive physicalists later adopted this premise\nand these arguments (usually without alteration) to challenge all\nvarieties of psychophysical reductionism. The argument was even used\nto challenge the functionalism it initially was offered to support.\nReductionists (and other critics) quickly offered a number of\nresponses, initially attacking either the anti-reductionist or\nanti-identity conclusion from the multiple realizability premise, or\nadvocating accounts of the reduction relation that accommodated\nmultiple realizability. More recently it has become fashionable to\nattack the multiple realizability premise itself. Most recently the\nfirst book-length treatment of multiple realizability and its\nphilosophical import has appeared.\n\nThis entry proceeds mostly chronologically, to indicate the historical\ndevelopment of the topic. Its principle focus is on philosophy of mind\nand cognitive science, but it also indicates the more recent shift in\nemphasis to concerns in the metaphysics of science more generally. It\nis worth mentioning at the outset that multiple realizability has been\nclaimed in physics (e.g., Batterman 2000), biochemistry (Tahko\nforthcoming) and synthetic biology (Koskinen 2019a,b). After more than\nfifty years of detailed philosophical discussion there still seems to\nbe no end in sight for novel ideas about this persistent concern.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Multiple Realizability Arguments\n1.1 What is Multiple Realizability?\n\nThe multiple realizability contention about the mental is that a given\npsychological kind (like pain) can be realized by many distinct\nphysical kinds: by different brain states in earthly biological\npain-bearers, by electronic states in properly programmed digital\ncomputers, by green slime states in imagined extraterrestrials, and so\non. Correctly characterizing the realization relation remains a\ncontentious matter in analytic metaphysics (Gillett 2003; Polger 2004)\nand this issue quickly reaches detailed technical depths. But whatever\nthe correct account of realization turns out to be, about whatever\nkinds turn out to be related by realization, the multiple\nrealizability contention about the mental holds that a given\npsychological kind (like pain) can stand in that relationship to many\ndistinct physical kinds. Further discussion of this issue with\nnumerous references will arise in\n section 3\n below.\n1.2 Initial Multiple Realizability Arguments Against \u201cReductive\u201d Mind-Brain Identity Theories\n\nHilary Putnam introduced multiple realizability into the philosophy of\nmind. Challenging the \u201cbrain state theorists\u201d, who held\nthat every mental kind is identical to some yet-to-be-discovered\nneural kind, Putnam (1967) notes the wide variety of terrestrial\ncreatures seemingly capable of experiencing pain. Humans, other\nprimates, other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and even\nmollusks (e.g., octopi) seem reasonable candidates. But then, for the\n\u201cbrain state theory\u201d to be true, there must be some\n\u201cphysical-chemical kind\u201d common to this wide variety of\npain-bearing species, and correlated exactly with each occurrence of\nthe mental kind. (This is a necessary condition of the hypothesized\ntype-identity.) Biological considerations speak intuitively against\nthis requirement. Neuroanatomy differs across terrestrial\nbrain-bearing creatures, especially at systems and circuit levels;\nfunction, especially sensory functions, are increasingly\n\u201ccorticalized\u201d as cortical mass increases across species.\nConvergent evolution generates similar phylogenic traits in organisms\nnot closely related due to their having to adapt to similar\nenvironments or ecological niches. Such realizers of the same function\nwill highly likely be distinct \u201cphysical-chemical\u201d\nkinds.\n\nIn addition, Putnam (1967) points out that early mind-brain identity\ntheorists insisted that these identities, while contingent, hold by\nvirtue of natural (scientific) law. So then any physically possible\npain-bearer must also be capable of possessing that physical-chemical\nkind. This point marks the introduction of the crucial distinction\nbetween multiple realization and multiple\nrealizability into the discussion, as well as the well-known\nphilosophers\u2019 imagined metaphysical possibilities. Silicon-based\nandroids, artificially intelligent electronic robots, and Martians\nwith green slime pulsating within their bodies all seem to be possible\npain realizers. But they lack \u201cbrain states\u201d comparable to\nours at any level of physical description. Further still, these\nmind-brain identity theories were supposed to be completely general.\nEvery mental kind was held to be identical to some neural\nkind. So the critic needs to find only one mental kind, shared across\nthese structure-types yet realized differently at the\nphysical-chemical level. Putnam (1967) acknowledges that the early\nidentity theories were being offered an empirical hypothesis. But this\nconsequence was \u201ccertainly ambitious\u201d, and almost\ncertainly false.\n\nOne quick word on this distinction between multiple\nrealizability and realization, for it marks a point\nwhere treatment of this topic in metaphysics and cognitive science\ndiverged. Metaphysicians, many of whom came quickly to reject the\ncontingent identity claims of the early mind-brain identity theorists\nin favor of the necessity of identity claims, focused on multiple\nrealizability, since the possibility of distinct physical\nrealizers of the same psychological kind was sufficient to block any\nsuch identity between realized kind and any one of its possible\nrealizers. Philosophers who took their cue from the cognitive and\nbrain sciences focused on proposed instances of multiple\nrealization, of actual instances of the relation among\nexisting cognizers. The emphasis in this entry will be on the latter\nissue, although some discussion of the metaphysical issues will arise\nin\n section 2\n and\n section 3\n below. \n\nStated in canonical form, Putnam\u2019s original multiple\nrealizability argument draws an anti-identity theory conclusion from\ntwo premises:\n\n(the multiple realizability contention) (At least) some mental\nkinds are multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds.\nIf a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical\nkinds, then it cannot be identical to any one (of those) specific\nphysical kind.\n(the anti-identity thesis conclusion) (At least) some mental kinds\nare not identical to any one specific physical kind.\n\n\nIn this simple form, this argument is deductively valid.\n\nJerry Fodor (1974) extended Putnam\u2019s initial argument by arguing\nthat reductionism imposes too strong a constraint on acceptable\ntheories in special sciences like psychology and economics. According\nto Fodor, reductionism is the conjunction of \u201ctoken\nphysicalism\u201d with the claim that there are natural kind\npredicates in an ideally completed physics corresponding to each\nnatural kind term in any ideally completed special science. He\ncharacterizes \u201ctoken physicalism\u201d as the claim that all\nevents that science talks about are physical events. Token physicalism\nis a logically weaker thesis than reductionism or type-type\nphysicalism. To illustrate why, consider the following string of\nnumerals:\n\n1 1 2\n\nThis string contains two types of numerals (1 and 2), but three tokens\nof the two types (two tokens of the numeral type 1 and one token of\nthe numeral type 2). Mental states are similarly ambiguous. When you\nand I both entertain the belief that Fodor advocated a Language of\nThought, one type of mental state is entertained, but two tokens of\nthat type occur (your belief state and my belief state). Type-type\nphysicalism insists that each mental state type is identical to some\nphysical state type, i.e., some specific brain state type on the\nmind-brain identity theory. This view runs afoul of multiple\nrealizability. But token physicalism only insists that each token\noccurrence of each type of mental state is identical to some token\noccurrence of some physical state type\u2014not necessarily a token\noccurrence of the same physical state type on each occasion, e.g.,\nwhen you and I, with our brains differentiated by our separate life\nhistories, entertain the same belief about Fodor\u2019s favorite\nphilosophy of mind.\n\nFodor gave reductionists the best-known account of reduction at that\ntime, the one at work in Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam\u2019s\n(1958; Fodor subtitles his 1974 as \u201cThe Disunity of Science as a\nWorking Hypothesis\u201d) and culminating in Ernest Nagel\u2019s\n(1961) \u201cderivability\u201d account of intertheoretic reduction.\nAccording to Fodor, this \u201cclassic\u201d account\n\u201cconnects\u201d disparate elements of the reduced and reducing\ntheories\u2019 vocabularies by way of \u201cbridge laws\u201d (not\nNagel\u2019s term!) and claims a reduction when the laws of the\nreduced theory are derived from the laws of the reducing theory plus\nthe bridge laws. According to Fodor (1974), if reductionism is to\nestablish physicalism, these cross-theoretic bridge laws must assert\n(contingent) identities of reduced and reducing kinds. But given\nmultiple realizability, the only way this can obtain is if the\nphysical science constituent of a psychophysical bridge law is a\ndisjunction of all the terms denoting possible physical realizations\nof the mental kind. Given the extent and variety of actual (not to say\npossible) physical realizations, Fodor insists that it is\noverwhelmingly likely that the disjunctive component will not be a\nkind-predicate of any specific physical science. It is also\noverwhelmingly likely that the disjunctive component will not appear\nin any genuine law of some specific physical science. Multiple\nrealizability thus demonstrates that the additional requirement\nimposed by reductionism, beyond that of token physicalism, is\nempirically untenable. (For a recent argument that multiple\nrealization is consistent with Oppenheim and Putnam\u2019s unity of\nscience via reductions, see Shapiro 2018)\n1.3 Early Multiple Realizability Arguments for Functionalism\n\nThe multiple realizability premise was also part of early arguments\nfor functionalism. Functionalism in the philosophy of mind\nindividuates mental states in terms of their causes and effects. Pain,\nfor example, is caused by tissue damage or trauma to bodily regions,\nand in turn causes specific beliefs (e.g., that one is in pain),\ndesires (e.g., that one relieves the pain), and behaviors such as\ncrying out, nursing the damaged area, and seeking out pain relieving\ndrugs. Any internal state that mediates a similar pattern of causes\nand effects is of the mental type pain, regardless of the specific\nphysical mechanisms that realize that pattern of causes and effects in\nany given case. Ned Block and Jerry Fodor (1972) note that the\nmultiple realizability of mental types on physical types shows that\nany physicalist type-identity hypothesis will fail to be sufficiently\nabstract. Functionalism, on the other hand, seems to be at the correct\nlevel of abstraction up from explanations of behavior based on\nphysical mechanisms. In particular, it seems sufficiently abstract to\nhandle multiple realizability. Block and Fodor (1972) also note that\nmultiple realizability at the level of physical description is a\ncommon characteristic of ordinary functional kinds, like mousetraps\nand valve lifters. So it appears to be a reasonable empirical\nhypothesis that characterizing mental kinds as functional kinds is at\nthe correct level of abstraction.\n\nSome contemporary nonreductive physicalists deny that mental kinds are\ncorrectly identified with functional kinds. A popular criticism of\nthis sort hinges on issues about individualism in psychology. But\nPutnam later used multiple realizability itself to argue against\nfunctionalism, arguing that mental kinds are both\n\u201ccompositionally\u201d and \u201ccomputationally\u201d\nplastic. The first point is his familiar contention of the multiple\nrealizability of the mental on the physical. The second contends that\nthe same mental kind can be a property of systems that are not in the\nsame computational state (see Putnam 1988 for details). In this\nargument, multiple realizability strikes back against the very theory\nof mind it initially was used to defend. \n1.4 The Multiple Realizability Argument from Psychological Explanations\n\nPsychologist Zenon Pylyshyn (1984) appeals to multiple realizability\nto ground a methodological criticism of reductionism about psychology.\nHe describes a pedestrian (in the U.S., say), having just witnessed an\nautomobile accident, rushing into a nearby phone booth and dialing a 9\nand a 1.  (For readers unfamiliar with phone booths, suppose instead\nthat he pulls out his cell phone and punches those numbers.) What will\nthis person do next? With very high probability, he will dial (push)\nanother 1. Why? Because in the U.S., 911 is the universal emergency\nnumber and there is a systematic generalization holding between the\nevent he witnessed, his background knowledge, resulting intentions,\nand that subsequent action (all intentionally described).\n\nWe won\u2019t discover that generalization, however, if we focus on\nthe person\u2019s neurophysiology and resulting muscular\ncontractions. That level of explanation logically is too weak, for it\ncannot tell us that the prior sequence of neural events and muscular\ncontractions will lead to the subsequent action of dialing another 1.\nA physiological explanation for any given instance will only link one\nway of learning the emergency phone number to one way of coming to\nknow that an emergency occurred to one sequence of neural events and\nresulting muscular contractions producing the behavior\n(nonintentionally described). However, the number of physical events\nconstituting each of these cognitive classes\u2014the learning, the\ncoming to know, and the action of dialing\u2014is potentially\nunlimited, with the constituents of each class often unrelated to each\nother at the physiological level of description. (This is\nPylyshyn\u2019s appeal to multiple realizability.) So if there is a\ngeneralization at the higher level of description available for\ncapturing\u2014and in the example sketched above, surely there\nis\u2014an exclusively reductionist approach to psychological\nexplanation will miss it. Thus because of multiple realizability,\nreductionism violates a tenet of scientific methodology: seek to\ncapture all capturable generalizations. Such methodological arguments\ndid not end with Pylyshyn\u2019s. Fodor (1975: Chapter 5) and Terence\nHorgan (1993) raise related methodological caveats about reductionism\nbased on multiple realizability. Bickle (1998: Chapter 4) responds\ndirectly to these.\n1.5 Appeals to Multiple Realizability in a Token System Over Time\n\nAnti-reductionists quickly came to stress the more radical form of\nmultiple realizability mentioned in\n section 1.1\n above, in a token system over times. As far back as the late 1970s,\nNed Block (1978) insisted that the narrowing of psychological kinds\nrequired to render them identifiable with specific physical (i.e.,\nneural) kinds due to the more radical type of multiple realizability\nwould render psychology incapable of capturing most all\ngeneralizations across realizers. Ronald Endicott (1993) gives\nBlock\u2019s point empirical backing by noting detailed facts about\nplasticity in individual human brains. The capacity for distinct\nneural structures and processes to subserve a given psychological\nfunction owing to trauma, damage, changing task demands, development,\nand other factors is extensive. These facts count further against any\nproposed reduction of, or identities between psychological and\nphysical kinds. Horgan (1993) clearly appeals to this radical sense of\nmultiple realizability when he writes:\n\n\nMultiple realizability might well begin at home. For all we now know\n(and I emphasize that we really do not now know), the\nintentional mental states we attribute to one another might turn out\nto be radically multiply realizable at the neurobiological level of\ndescription, even in humans; indeed, even in\nindividual humans; indeed, even in an individual human\ngiven the structure of his central nervous system at a single\nmoment of his life. (1993: 308; author\u2019s emphases)\n\n\nThis radical sense of multiple realizability was widely adopted among\nnonreductive physicalists, whose solution to the mind-body problem\nprobably remains the most popular position in Anglo-American\nphilosophy of mind. Putnam\u2019s original multiple realizability\nargument against the mind-brain identity (see\n \u00a71.2\n above) remains central to this view, with the second premise now\nreplaced with:\n\n(2\u2032)\n If some mental kinds are multiply realizable in this radical\nsingle-token-system-over-time sense, then psychology cannot be reduced\nto any physical science;\n\n\nand Putnam\u2019s original conclusion replaced with:\n\n(3\u2032)\n Psychology cannot be reduced to any physical science.\n\n2. Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years\n2.1 One-Way Bridge Principles in Nagel Reductions\n\nRobert Richardson (1979) argues that Fodor\u2019s multiple\nrealizability challenge to reductionism (see\n \u00a71.2\n above) rests on a misunderstanding of Ernest Nagel\u2019s\n\u201cclassic\u201d account of intertheoretic reduction. Although\nNagel\u2019s (1961) detailed examples of historical cases of\nintertheoretic reduction in science all involve biconditional\ncross-theory \u201cconditions of connectivity\u201d (what Fodor and\nothers called \u201cbridge laws\u201d), one-way conditional\nconnections expressing sufficient conditions at the reducing level are\nall that his \u201cprinciple of derivability\u201d requires.\nRichardson cites passages from Nagel (1961) indicating that Nagel\nhimself saw the force of this point. Multiple realizability only\nchallenges necessity (and nondisjunctive) reducing conditions, and so\nis not a challenge to a projected, distinctively Nagelian reduction of\npsychology to some physical science. However, this response seems not\nto dispose of the original argument\u2019s force against mind-brain\nidentity theory.\n2.2 Domain-Specific Identities and Reductions\n\nDavid Lewis (1969) argues that the inconsistency between the identity\ntheorist\u2019s thesis and multiple realizability evaporates when we\nnotice a tacit relativity of the former to contexts. A common sense\nexample illustrates his point. The following three claims appear\nlogically inconsistent:\n\n(1)\n There is only one winning lottery number.\n(2) \n The winning lottery number is 03.\n(3) \n The winning lottery number is 61.\n\n\nThese three similar claims likewise seem inconsistent:\n\n(1\u2032)\n (the identity theorist\u2019s thesis) There is only one\nphysical-chemical realization of pain.\n(2\u2032) \n The physical-chemical realization of pain is C-fiber firing.\n(3\u2032) \n The physical-chemical realization of pain is \u2026 (something\nelse entirely).\n\n\n(2\u2032) and (3\u2032) reflect the multiple realizability\ncontention. But there is no mystery in how to reconcile (1)\u2013(3).\nAppend \u201cper week\u201d to (1), \u201cthis week\u201d to (2),\nand \u201clast week\u201d to (3). Similarly, append \u201cper\nnervous system-type\u201d to (1\u2032), \u201cin human nervous\nsystems\u201d to (2\u2032), and \u201cin mollusk nervous\nsystems\u201d to (3\u2032). Inconsistencies evaporate. Lewis\u2019s\npoint is that identity claims are always specific to a domain. One\nmight wonder whether Lewis\u2019s point generalizes to capture the\nscience fiction examples Putnam hinted at in passing (see\n \u00a71.2\n above). Lewis was certainly aware of Putnam\u2019s (1967)\nargument\u2019s reach (Lewis offers this argument as part of a review\nof the book in which Putnam\u2019s piece first appeared). So we can\nassume Lewis thought domain-specific reductions generalize to\nthese metaphysically possible cases as well. (See Lewis\u2019s own\nelaboration of this argument in his 1983.)\n\nMany reductionist philosophers subsequently elaborated on\nLewis\u2019s point with the help of scientific examples. Patricia\nChurchland (1986: Chapter 7), Clifford Hooker (1981), Berent En\u00e7\n(1983), and other philosophers of science have described historical\nintertheoretic reductions where a given reduced concept is multiply\nrealized at the reducing level. A common example is the concept of\ntemperature from classical equilibrium thermodynamics. Temperature in\na gas is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy. Temperature in a\nsolid, however, is identical to mean maximal molecular kinetic energy,\nsince the molecules of a solid are bound in lattice structures and\nhence restricted to a range of vibratory motions. Temperature in a\nplasma is something else entirely, since the molecular constituents of\na plasma have been ripped apart. Even a vacuum can have a\n(\u201cblackbody\u201d) temperature, though it contains no molecular\nconstituents. \u201cTemperature\u201d of classical thermodynamics is\nthus multiply realized microphysically in a variety of distinct\nphysical states. Yet this is a \u201ctextbook\u201d intertheoretic\nreduction in the history of science. It is just that the reduction,\nand the subsequent ontological identifications across theories, are\nspecific to the domain of physical state.\n\nLewis\u2019s original response also underlies Jaegwon Kim\u2019s\n(1989, 1992) appeals to structure-specific \u201clocal\nreductions\u201d. Kim agrees that multiple realizability rules out a\ngeneral reduction of (structure-independent) psychology to some\nphysical science. But it permits, and even sanctions, a local\nreduction of psychology to a theory of the physical mechanisms of\ngiven structure-types. (Kim admits that the relevant structure-types\nhere will probably be narrower than biological species.) Local\nreductions involve \u201cstructure-specific bridge laws\u201d where\nthe mental-physical biconditional occurs as the consequent of a\nconditional whose antecedent denotes a specific structure-type (e.g.,\n\u201cif X is a member of structure type S, then\nX is in mental state M if and only if X is in\nphysical state P\u201d). Conditionals whose antecedents denote\ndifferent structure types will typically have biconditionals as\nconsequents whose mental term-constituents are co-referential but\nwhose physical term-constituents denote different physical events.\nMultiple realizability forces this much revision to the bridge laws of\nclassical reductionism. But according to Kim, domain-specific local\nreductions are the rule rather than the exception in science\ngenerally, and are sufficient for any reasonable scientific or\nphilosophical purpose.\n2.3 Appeals to Neuroscience\u2019s Successes\n\nJaegwon Kim (1992) suggests, and John Bickle (1998: Chapter 4)\nemphasizes that guiding methodological principles in contemporary\nneuroscience assume continuity of underlying neural mechanisms across\nthe nervous systems of different species. This assumption informs many\nneuroscience experimental techniques and conclusions drawn from\nexperimental results. Continuity is assumed both within and across\nspecies. If radical multiple realizability of the sort championed by\nanti-reductionist philosophers actually obtained among existent\nspecies, contemporary neuroscientific experimental techniques and\npractices built upon this continuity assumption should bear little\nscientific fruit. Why experiment on the macaque visual system to\ninvestigate human visual processing, if we can\u2019t safely assume\nsome fairly strong continuity across these species? Why should\npositron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) reveal common areas of high metabolic activity during\npsychological task performance, both across and within individual\nhumans\u2014now down to less than a millimeter of spatial resolution\nin fMRI\u2014if multiple realizability were as prevalent or\nwidespread as many nonreductive philosophers assume? (see\n \u00a71.5\n above). Standard neuroscientific experimental procedures, and even\nclinical diagnostic tools widely used by practicing neurologists and\nneuropsychologists, would seem hopelessly na\u00efve in the face of common\nphilosophical assertions about the extent of multiple realizability.\nBut these procedures and tools do work, and are not hopelessly\nna\u00efve.\n\nSo Kim and Bickle draw the modus tollens conclusion, and insist that\nthese neuroscientific successes are evidence that psychological kinds\nare not as widely or as radically multiply realized in brains as many\nfunctionalists and nonreductive physicalists assume. It turns out that\neven celebrated neural plasticity is systematic within and across\nnervous systems. It has a regular progression following damage to a\nprincipal structure; there are underlying neural mechanisms that\nsubserve it, evolutionarily conserved across species. Furthermore, the\nnewly realized function following brain damage is typically seriously\ndegraded compared to initial performance. Persons can still talk,\nmanipulate spatial representations, or move their extremities, but\ntheir performances are typically qualitatively and quantitatively\nworse than normals. This fact gives rise to tricky questions about\nindividuation of psychological function. Are these alternative neural\nstructures realizing the same psychological function, the\nsame mental kind, as before, as the philosophical uses of\nmultiple realizability require? (This last response has been further\ndeveloped more recently; see\n \u00a72.4\n and\n \u00a73.1\n below.)\n\nWilliam Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale (1999) provide extensive\nempirical details about hypothesized or assumed brain type-identities\nacross species in neuroscientific practice. Their explicit target is a\nmethodological consequence sometimes drawn from the multiple\nrealizability premise: if psychological states are multiply realized\nacross biological species, then neuroscience will be of little use\ntoward understanding cognition. But as details of the neuroscience of\nvision demonstrate, neuroscientists have successfully used\nunderstanding of the brain to decompose visual function. The\nneuroscientific goal has been to\n\n\nshow how functional considerations get built into developing the\nstructural taxonomy and how that taxonomy in turn can be a heuristic\nguide in developing information-processing models. This project has\nnot been impaired by multiple realization of psychological states;\nrather, it relies on the assumption that there is a common realization\nof mechanisms for processing visual information across species. (1999:\n201)\n\n\nIt is difficult to argue against contemporary neuroscience\u2019s\nempirical successes. So even if one accepts multiple realizability in\nits original type-type form advocated by Putnam (see\n \u00a71.2\n above), Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s argument cautions against drawing\nstrong consequences from it about psychology\u2019s\nmethodological autonomy from neuroscience.\n2.4 Challenging the Individuation of Mental Kinds\n\nOver the past two decades philosophers have been more willing than\npreviously to challenge the truth of the multiple realizability\npremise itself (see\n \u00a73.2\n below.) One approach of this kind challenges the way proponents of\nmultiple realizability individuate mental kinds.\n\nAn early version of this argument is from Nick Zangwill (1992), who\nconcludes that multiple realizability across biological species has\n\u201cnever been proven\u201d. The multiple realizability contention\nassumes a type-identity of mental kinds across species. According to\nZangwill this assumption is problematic, given that the obvious\nsensory and motor differences across species by themselves yield\ndifferent cause-and-effect patterns at all but the grossest level of\ndescription. If successful, Zangwill\u2019s challenge undercuts the\nmultiple realizability argument by denying that the same mental kinds\nobtain across species, to be realized by different physical\nmechanisms.\n\nLawrence Shapiro (2000) also contends that philosophers are too quick\nto claim that a single given kind is multiply realized. Some\nproperties of the realizers are relevant to the purposes, activities,\nor capacities that define a given functional kind, but other\nproperties are not. Consider corkscrews. That functional kind can be\n\u201cmultiply realized\u201d in two tokens that differ only in\ntheir color. That physical difference does not make them genuinely\ndifferent realizations of corkscrew, however, because that one makes\nno relevant difference, that is, no difference to their performances\nas corkscrews. Similarly for two corkscrews that differ only in that\none is made of aluminum and the other of steel. Although that\ncompositional difference might matter for some functional kinds, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter for corkscrews. As Shapiro notes, \n\n\nsteel and aluminum are not different realizations of a\nwaiter\u2019s corkscrew because, relative to the properties that make\nthem suitable for removing corks, they are identical. (2000: 644) \n\n\nEstablishing relevant multiple realizability requires pointing to\nproperty differences in the realizers that make for a functional\ndifference for that kind of thing.\n\nShapiro then points out that this requirement sets up a dilemma for\nproponents of multiple realizability. Consider what appears to be a\ngenuine case of multiple realizability, that is, two objects that\n\u201cdo the same thing\u201d but in very different ways. Either the\nrealizing kinds genuinely differ in their causally relevant properties\nor they do not. If they do not, then we don\u2019t really have a case\nof multiple realizability (like the corkscrews that differ only in\ncolor or metal composition). If they do so differ, then they genuinely\nare different kinds. But then functionally they are not the same kind,\nand again we don\u2019t have an instance of multiple\nrealizability\u2014of a single functional kind with distinct\nrealizations.\n\nThe usual justification for grouping distinct realizers under a single\nfunctional kind is that such a classification reveals interesting\nsimilarities, of the sort we expect to be captured by laws or\ngeneralizations of some higher level science. But according to\nShapiro, when the realizing kinds differ significantly in their\ncausally relevant properties for the function at issue, any shared\nlaws or generalizations are \u201cnumbingly dull\u201d (2000: 649),\ne.g., all realizers of mouse traps can be used to catch mice, or both\ncamera eyes and compound eyes have the function of enabling the\norganism to see. Shapiro remarks: \n\n\nIf [functional kinds] share many causally relevant properties, then\nthey are not distinct realizations \u2026 If they have no or only\nfew causally relevant properties in common, then there are no or just\na few laws that are true of both of them. (2000: 649) \n\n\nThe first horn acknowledges a single functional kind but denies that\nit is multiply realized. The second horn undercuts the principal\nreason for grouping genuinely different physical kinds under a single\nfunctional kind. Shapiro concludes that taken together these two horns\nblunt any claim of multiple realizations of the same\nfunctional type. His argument has been central to more recent disputes\nas concerns about multiple realization shifted to the metaphysics of\nscience (see\n \u00a73).\n\nShapiro\u2019s dilemma is in the spirit of an earlier \u201ccausal\npowers\u201d argument from Jaegwon Kim (1992) Kim insists that\nscientific kinds are individuated by their causal powers, and the\ncausal powers of each instance of some realized kind are identical to\nthose of its realizer. From these principles it follows that instances\nof a mental kind with different physical realizations are distinct\nkinds because of the distinct causal powers of their realizers. A\nstructure-independent mental kind is not a causal kind, and hence is\ndisqualified as proper scientific kinds. Multiple realizability yields\nthe failure of structure-independent mental kinds to meet a standard\nof what makes something a scientific kind.\n\nMark Couch (2004) presses a related dilemma. Defending a claimed\nmultiple realization involves two steps. Proponents must show\n\n that the physical states (of the realizers) are type distinct,\nand \n that the functional properties are type identical. \n\n\nChallenges to claimed multiple realizations can attack either step,\nand most importantly, the step challenged can differ from case to\ncase. Successfully challenging either step blocks any multiple\nrealizability argument appealing to that kind. As we saw in the\nprevious section, Bechtel and Mundale (1999) describe cases in which\ncognitive neuroscientists treat the physical realizers (brain states)\nas type-identical across species, thus attacking step (i). In other\ncases\u2014Couch\u2019s example is primate versus octopus\neyes\u2014one can appeal to easily-found differences in functional\nproperties, attacking step (ii). The two types of eyes have different\nvisual pigments in their photoreceptors, different retinas, and\ndifferent ways of focusing light. These physical differences lead to\nstraightforward input-output (functional) differences: in the optic\nstimuli the two eyes respond to, in reaction times, and more. Their\nfunctions may be similar, but similarity isn\u2019t identity and the\nmultiple realization argument since Putnam\u2019s original version\n(see\n \u00a71.2\n above) requires identity at the realized functional kinds.\nCross-species functional similarities are often quite superficial,\nespecially across species from widely differing taxa (a point stressed\nby both Couch and Shapiro). In actual scientific practice, discovered\nphysical (neural) differences typically incline psychologists to\nsearch for functional differences. Couch\u2019s point is that the\nindividuation of psychological states, like the individuation of brain\nstates, is an empirical issue; Shapiro and Couch both suggest that\nclaims about multiple realizability often rely heavily on\n\u201cfolk\u201d psychological intuitions about individuating mental\nkinds.\n\nBechtel and Mundale (1999) note that proponents of multiple\nrealizability often appeal to different amounts of\n\u201cgranularity\u201d in how they individuate mental versus\nneurobiological kinds. Proponents often analyze psychological states\nat a coarse-grained level, in which only the loosest input-output\nsimilarities across species are deemed sufficient for mental kind\nidentities. Yet they insist on very fine-grained individuation for\nbrain states, in which small differences across species are sufficient\nfor neural type-differences. But psychological ascriptions admit of\nfiner grains and neural ascriptions admit of coarser grains. Bechtel\nand Mundale insist that when a common grain is chosen for both,\nmental-neural type-identities holding across species are found.\n\nThese responses quickly attracted critical counters. Carl Gillett\n(2003) argues that Fodor and other proponents of multiple\nrealizability assume a \u201cDimensioned\u201d view of realization\nthat allows realizer/realized properties to be instantiated in the\ndistinct individuals that bear part-whole relations to one\nanother. Shapiro instead assumes a \u201cFlat\u201d view of\nrealization, which demands that realizer/realized properties be\ninstantiated in the same individual. Gillett argues that\nShapiro\u2019s arguments fail under the Dimensioned view of\nrealization, and that he never defends the Flat view over the\nDimensioned view. Gillett concludes that failing to directly address\nthe nature of the realization relation more generally vitiates\nShapiro\u2019s critique, leaving it as simply begging the question\nagainst Fodor\u2019s and others original defenses of the multiple\nrealization premise. These more general accounts later emerged to\ndominate more recent discussions (see\n \u00a73\n below). \n2.5 Reduction and Identity Theory Reconceived\n\nThe more radical type of multiple realizability seems to force\nincreasingly narrower domains for reductions to be relativized; at the\nextreme, to individuals at times. This much \u201clocal\nreduction\u201d seems inconsistent with the assumed generality of\nscience. To avoid this problem, some philosophers of science have\nsuggested significant changes to the \u201cclassical\u201d\n(Nagelian) account of (intertheoretic) reduction to enable the account\nto handle multiple realizability of reduced kinds, a feature of a\nnumber of \u201ctextbook\u201d cases of scientific reductions.\n\nFollowing suggestions by Clifford Hooker (1981) and Berent En\u00e7\n(1983), John Bickle (1998: Chapter 4) argues that even the radical\ntype of multiple realizability (in the same token system over time\nsense) is a feature of some widely-accepted historical scientific\nreductions. For example, it occurs in the reduction of classical\nequilibrium thermodynamics to statistical mechanics and microphysics.\nFor any token aggregate of gas molecules, there is an indefinite\nnumber of realizations of a given temperature: a given mean\nmolecular kinetic energy. Microphysically, the most fine-grained\ntheoretical specification of a gas is its microcanonical ensemble, in\nwhich the momentum and location (and thus the kinetic energy) of each\nmolecule is specified. Indefinitely many distinct microcanonical\nensembles of a token volume of gas molecules can yield the same\nmean molecular kinetic energy. Thus at the lowest level of\nmicrophysical description, a given temperature is vastly multiply\nrealizable in the same token system over times. Nevertheless, the case\nof temperature is a textbook case of scientific reduction. So even\nthis radical type of token-token multiple realizability is no barrier\nin principle to reducibility. An actual case in science exemplifies\nit.\n\nTo accommodate multiple realizability, Hooker (1981: Part III)\nsupplements his general theory of reduction with an account of\n\u201ctoken-to-token\u201d reductions. He notes explicitly that this\nsupplement builds the possibility of handling multiple realizability\ndirectly into his revised definition of the reduction relation. Let\nS be the predicate, \u201csatisfies functional theory\nF\u201d, T be the class of systems to which the token\nsystem in question belongs, S\u2032 be an appropriate\npredicate in some lower level theory of T-system causal mechanisms,\nand T* be the class of systems to which S\u2032\napplies. Then, according to Hooker, \n\n\nsystems of type S of class T are contingently\ntoken/token identical with systems of type S\u2032 in class\nT* =df every instance (token) of a type\nS system externally classified as in class T is\ncontingently identical with some instance (token) of a type\nS\u2032 system externally classified as in class\nT*. (1981: 504) \n\n\nBy \u201cexternally classified\u201d, Hooker refers to the sort of\ncross-classification that holds across different\ndeterminable/determinate hierarchies. To address some self-assessed\nshortcomings of Hooker\u2019s own formulation of his general account\nof reduction, Bickle (1998) reformulates Hooker\u2019s insights,\nincluding his token-token reduction supplement, within a\nset-theoretically characterized \u201csemantic\u201d account of\ntheory structure and relations. Bickle\u2019s account draws directly\non formal work from \u201cstructuralist\u201d philosophy of science.\nMore recently Klein (2013) advocated for a semantic \u201csets of\nmodels\u201d account of theory structure as a strategy for\naccommodating multiple realized reduced kinds.\n\nOther reconceptions of both reduction and the mind-brain identity\ntheory have been proposed explicitly to handle multiple realizability.\nElliott Sober (1999) insists that a reductionist thesis actually\nfollows from the multiple realizability premise. He begins by\nattacking Putnam\u2019s (1967) \u201cobjective\u201d account of\nsuperior explanation, namely that one explanation is superior to\nanother if the former is more general. According to Putnam, superior\nexplanations \u201cbring out the relevant laws\u201d. But Sober\nreminds us that explanatory generalizations at lower levels bring out\nmore details. Science \u201caims for depth as well as breadth\u201d\nand there is no \u201cobjective rule\u201d concerning which endeavor\nis \u201cbetter\u201d (1999: 550). Both reductionists and\nanti-reductionists err in privileging one aim at the expense of the\nother. Sober then notes that multiple realizability\npresupposes some form of asymmetric determination: the lower level\nphysical properties that are present at a given time determine the\nhigher level properties that are present. But this assumption commits\nits proponents to the causal completeness of physics, the thesis that\nphysical effects have only physical causes (a doctrine that Sober\nsketches toward the end of his 1999). If one is also concerned with\ncausal explanation\u2014that is, if one holds that individual\noccurrences are explained by citing their causes\u2014then the causal\ncompleteness of physics in turn commits multiple realizability\nproponents to physics\u2019 possessing an important kind of\nexplanatory completeness that all other sciences lack. This is\n\u201creductionism of a sort\u201d (Sober 1999: 562).\n\nWilliam Bechtel and Robert McCauley (1999) develop a version of\n\u201cheuristic\u201d mind-brain identity theory (HIT) and defend it\nexplicitly against multiple realizability. HIT insists that identity\nclaims in science typically are hypotheses adopted in the course of\nempirical investigations, which serve to guide subsequent research.\nThey are not conclusions reached after empirical research has been\nconducted. Concerning the multiple realizability of psychological on\nbrain (physical) states, cognitive neuroscience\u2019s heuristic\nidentity claims assert type-commonalities in comparative studies\nacross species, not type-differences. Bechtel and McCauley illustrate\ntheir hypothesis with case studies: Brodmann\u2019s early twentieth\ncentury work mapping the brain into functionally relevant areas;\nFerrier\u2019s late-nineteenth century work employing electrical\nstimulation to cortex; and more recent detailed maps of visual\nprocessing regions in the primate brain. All of these landmark\nfunctional anatomical studies used multiple species. As Bechtel and\nMcCauley remind us,\n\n\nwhen they consider theories of mind-brain relations, philosophers seem\nto forget that the overwhelming majority of studies have been on\nnon-human brains. \u2026 Although the ultimate objective is to\nunderstand the structure and function of the human brain,\nneuroscientists depend upon indirect, comparative procedures to apply\nthe information from studies with non-human animals to the study of\nthe human brain. (1999: 70\u201371)\n\n\nHeuristic psychoneural type-identity claims across species are key\ncomponents of these standard neuroscientific procedures.\n\nWhen reduction or identity theory gets reconceived in ways built to\naccommodate multiple realizability, are reductionists/identity\ntheorists and proponents of multiple realizability then simply talking\npast one another? Perhaps not. It is worth reminding ourselves that\nmany nonreductive physicalists have employed multiple realizability to\nargue against all forms of psychophysical reductionism. If\nbetter general accounts of scientific reduction or identity theory\nmake room for multiple realizability, these demonstrations count\nagainst this broader challenge. And if \u201cnonreductive\u201d\nphysicalists were to reformulate their position to oppose only a\nspecific brand of psychophysical reductionism or identity theory, that\nwould weaken their position significantly, perhaps to the point of\nshowing that it targets a straw person, but also making it compatible\nwith forms of \u201creductive\u201d physicalism. In fact, this\nreconception move on the part of reductionists and identity theorists\ntraces back to Fodor\u2019s (1974) essay. While Fodor\u2019s\narguments there explicitly targeted a reductionism built on the\nclassical Nagelian account, he suggests in footnote 2 that \n\n\nwhat I shall be attacking is what many people have in mind when they\nrefer to the unity of science, and I suspect (though I shan\u2019t\ntry to prove it) that many of the liberalized versions of reductionism\nsuffer from the same basic defect as what I shall take to be the\nclassical form of the doctrine. \n\n\nThe problem was, even back then, new work on (intertheoretic)\nreduction in the philosophy of science was attempting explicitly to\nmake room for multiple realizability of reduced on reducing kinds.\nFodor\u2019s \u201cshan\u2019t trying to prove\u201d the\ngenerality of his attack against even the earliest of those\nreconceptions begged explicitly one of the questions they were\naddressing.\n2.7 Lower Level Reductive Unity?\n\nIn searching for reductive unity underlying the variety of cognitive\nsystems, Paul Churchland (1982) once recommended descending\n\u201cbelow\u201d neurobiology and even biochemistry, to the level\nof nonequilibrium thermodynamics. He insisted that finding reductive\nunity there was more than a bare logical possibility because of some\nparallels between biological processes, whose multiply realized kinds\nfind reductive unity there, and cognitive activity, especially\nlearning.\n\nConcerning Pylyshyn\u2019s (1984) attack on reductionist methodology\n(see\n \u00a71.5\n above), Patricia Churchland (1986: Chapter 9) suggests that\nfunctional theories are constructed in lower level sciences. New\nlevels of theory thus get inserted between those describing the\nstructure of the lower level kinds and those of purely functional\nkinds: between, for example, the physiology of individual neurons and\ncognitive psychology. We might find a common neurofunctional property\nfor a given type of psychological state across a wide variety of\ndistinct brains (or even the same brain over time). And if the scope\nof the macro-theory doesn\u2019t extend beyond that of its\nmicrofunctional counterpart, then reduction will be achieved despite\nvast multiple realizability at the microstructural level.\nNeurocomputational approaches that have blossomed since the early\n1990s give real empirical credence to Churchland\u2019s\nsuggestion.\n\nBickle (2003) claims that if we leave our neuroscientific\nunderstanding at the systems level, psychoneural multiple\nrealizability seems obvious. Neural systems differ significantly\nacross species. But neuroscience does not stop its inquiries at the\nsystems level. As it moves further down, into cellular physiology and\nincreasingly into the molecular biology of nervous tissue, identities\nof mechanisms across species have been found. Many molecular\nmechanisms of neural conductance, transmission, and plasticity are the\nsame, from invertebrates through mammals. This matters for psychology\nbecause mechanisms of cognition and consciousness are increasingly\nbeing found at these levels. Bickle\u2019s key example is memory\nconsolidation, the conversion of labile, easily disrupted short-term\nmemories into more durable, stable long-term form. Work with fruit\nflies, sea slugs, and mice has revealed the role of the cyclic\nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP\nresponsive-element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway in key\nforms of experience-driven synaptic plasticity. Across these very\ndistinct taxa, this molecular intracellular signaling pathways has\nbeen implicated experimentally in memory consolidation. By altering a\nsingle protein in this cascade (using biotechnology and molecular\ngenetics), experimenters have built mutant organisms whose short-term\nmemory remains intact (as does their sensory, motor, and motivational\ncapacities), but which cannot consolidate these short-term memories\ninto long-term form. Bickle quotes with approval statements like the\nfollowing, from insect biologists Josh Dubnau and Tom Tully:\n\n\nIn all systems studied, the cAMP signaling cascade has been identified\nas one of the major biochemical pathways involved in modulating both\nneuronal and behavioral plasticity. \u2026 More recently,\nelucidation of the role of CREB-mediated transcription in\nlong-term memory in flies, LTP and long-term memory in vertebrates,\nand long-term facilitation in A. californica [a sea slug]\nsuggest that CREB may constitute a universally conserved molecular\nswitch for long term memory. (1998: 438)\n\n\nMemory consolidation is just one psychological phenomenon, and so its\n\u201cruthless\u201d reduction to molecular events doesn\u2019t\nestablish a general claim about unitary mechanisms across widely\ndivergent taxa for other shared cognitive kinds. For that argument,\nBickle turns to principles of molecular evolution. The first principle\nholds that evolution at the molecular level\u2014changes to the amino\nacid sequence of a given protein\u2014is much slower in functionally\nimportant (\u201cconstrained\u201d) domains than in functionally\nless important ones. The second principle is that molecular evolution\nis much slower in all domains of \u201chousekeeping\u201d proteins,\nespecially in ones that participate in cell-metabolic processes in\nmany tissue types. These two principles imply that these molecules,\ntheir domains, and the intracellular processes they participate in\nwill remain constant across existing biological species that share the\ncommon ancestor that first possessed them. (This is what Dubnau and\nTully refer to above as a \u201cuniversally conserved\u201d\nmolecular switch.) In the end, any psychological kind that affects an\norganism\u2019s behavior must engage the cell-metabolic machinery in\nindividual neurons. In the brain, causally speaking, that\u2019s\nwhere the rubber meets the road. But that\u2019s the machinery\nconserved across existing biological species\u2014changes to it,\nespecially its functionally constrained domains, have (almost)\ninevitably been detrimental to an organism\u2019s survival. So we\nshould expect that the molecular mechanisms for any causally\nefficacious cognitive kind be \u201cuniversally conserved\u201d. The\ndiscovery of these shared mechanisms of memory consolidation is not\nsome isolated case, but follows from the core principles of molecular\nevolution. As \u201cmolecular and cellular cognition\u201d proceeds,\nwe should expect more examples of unitary realizers\u2014ruthless\nreductions\u2014across species for shared psychological kinds\n3. The Shifting Status of Multiple Realizability Early in the New Millennium\n\nOver the first decade of the twenty-first century, nonreductive\nphysicalism retained its status as the most popular position in\nAnglo-American philosophy of mind. Its proponents continued to appeal\nto the standard multiple realizability arguments (see\n \u00a71\n above) to challenge all versions of psychophysical reductionism and\nidentity theory. However, the challenges to multiple realizability and\nthe arguments using it, scouted in\n section 2\n above, began to attract wider notice. New versions of type-identity\ntheory and reductive physicalism began to be formulated more widely\n(Gozzano and Hill, 2012). The nonidentity of mental content properties\nwith any physical properties no longer seemed to be the\n\u201cpractically received wisdom\u201d, as Ernest LePore and Barry\nLoewer (1989) called it thirty years ago, although it has clearly\nremained an entrenched view.\n\nSome of these arguments continued lines introduced in\n section 2\n above. But they warrant separate treatment, not just to keep my\npresentation historically accurate, but also because more general\nconsiderations from the metaphysics of science increasingly came to\nmotivate specifics of the new discussions, although some of these more\ngeneral features had been scouted previously in works focused on\nphilosophy of mind (see especially William Lycan 1987).\n3.1 The Empire Strikes Back\n\nExpectedly, proponents of multiple realizability quickly responded to\nthe myriad challenges outlined in\n section 2\n above. Carl Gillett and Ken Aizawa were perhaps the most vocal\ndefenders of multiple realizability against a number of them. Gillett\n(2003) develops a precise framework for understanding compositionality\nrelations in science generally, and uses this framework to define\nproperty realization and multiple realization, and to distinguish\nfurther \u201cflat\u201d from \u201cdimensioned\u201d realization.\nRecall from\n section 2.4\n above that \u201cflat\u201d realization involves both realized and\nrealizing properties inhering in a single object.\n\u201cDimensioned\u201d realization involves realized and realizing\nproperties inhering in distinct individuals that stand in a\ncompositional relationship to one another. For Gillett (2002, 2003),\nthis distinction is important for two reasons. First, scientific\nexplanations employ dimensioned realizations, because inter-level\nmechanistic explanations relate distinct individuals. Second, Fodor\nand other proponents of the standard multiple realizability arguments\nwere assuming a dimensioned account, while the arguments of Shapiro\nand other recent critics (see\n \u00a72\n above) challenge the existence of multiple realizability only by\nassuming a flat realization. According to Gillett, no recent proponent\nof multiple realizability has assumed or defended flat realization as\nthe correct account involved in any of the scientific cases at\nissue.\n\nExplicitly applying Gillett\u2019s precise framework for realization\nand related notions, Ken Aizawa and Gillett defend the existence of\nmultiple realization in a variety of sciences (2009a). They also argue\nfor the \u201cmassive multiple realization\u201d of properties at\nevery level of organization, from the structure and function of\nproteins in neurons to those of human cognition to those of social\ninteractions (2009b). Their detailed scientific example in the latter\nessay is visual processing. They contend that neuroscientists, unlike\nphilosophers, are unfazed by massive multiple realization. Multiple\nrealization has been so contentious in philosophy of mind, they\ninsist, because philosophers tacitly assume flawed or scientifically\nunfounded accounts of realization, like the flat view. According to\nAizawa and Gillett (2009b), philosophers uncritically accept a\nnarrative that links multiple realization to the strict methodological\nautonomy of psychology from neuroscience. They also contend that the\nempirical details of vision research show that a co-evolutionary\nresearch methodology is not just consistent with, but explicitly\nmotivated by massive multiple realization. So this uncritically\naccepted philosophical narrative not only blinds philosophers to facts\nthat scientists recognize as unproblematic; it is also empirically\nfalse.\n\nSoon afterwards, Aizawa and Gillett (2011) distinguish two strategies\nscientists might adopt to deal with putative cases of multiple\nrealization. One strategy is simply to take multiple realization at\nface value and live with multiply realized kinds. The other is to\nsplit the higher-level multiply realized kind into a variety of\nsub-kinds, one for each of its distinct lower level realizers, and\nthen eliminate the original higher-level kind, at least for the\npurposes of further scientific investigation. Do scientists always\nfavor the second strategy, as recent philosophical critics of multiple\nrealizability would seem to recommend? With its well-known\ndistinctions between different types or systems, memory research would\nseem to be a clear instance of using such an\n\u201celiminate-and-split\u201d strategy. Yet, Aizawa and Gillett\nargue, such an assessment oversimplifies the actual scientific details\nin even this much-discussed case. Here too they sense an important\ngeneral methodological lesson: psychology took account of neuroscience\ndiscoveries, so even when taking multiple realization at face value\nscientists do not advocate strict methodological autonomy. But the\nactual details of how psychology takes neuroscientific discoveries\ninto account depends both on the nature of the psychological kinds in\nquestion and the needs of theorizing specific to psychology.\n\nAizawa has also replied to a number of the challenges to the standard\nmultiple realizability argument scouted in\n section 2\n above. After separating three distinct arguments in Bechtel and\nMundale (1999;\n \u00a72.3\n above), Aizawa (2009) sets his critical sights on their Central\nArgument, which argues against multiple realization from the existence\nand continued success of brain mapping studies. He argues that Bechtel\nand Mundale misrepresent the actual nature of these studies, and more\ngenerally of the methods employed in functional localization studies.\nWorking with exactly the scientific examples Bechtel and Mundale\ndiscuss (mostly from the functional neuroanatomy of vision), Aizawa\nargues that claims about psychological functions do not play the\nspecific role in these studies that Bechtel and Mundale insist. So the\nsuccess of these studies does not imply the falsity of multiple\nrealization. Later in that paper Aizawa challenges two of Bechtel and\nMundale\u2019s key assertions. He denies that if psychological\nproperties were multiply realized, then functional taxonomy of the\nbrain would have to be carried out independently of psychological\nfunction. And he denies that multiple realization rules out\ncomparisons of brains across different species. Hence all the premises\nof Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s Central Argument are false. Aizawa\n(2007) criticizes Bickle\u2019s (2003) argument that a unitary\nrealization of memory consolidation across species has been found at\nthe level of molecular mechanisms, despite widespread neural\ndifferences in these brains at higher levels of neuroscientific\ndescription\n (\u00a72.3\n above). According to Aizawa, the protein components of these\nevolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms, and the NNA sequences\ncoding for them, are themselves multiply realized across species.\nAizawa (2013) presented numerous scientific examples of multiple\nrealization by \u201ccompensatory differences\u201d. In such cases,\nchanges to one or more properties that jointly realize a realized\nproperty G are compensated for by changes in others of the\njointly realizing properties. Although his overall goal in this paper\nis to bring this form of multiple realization to wider recognition and\nstudy by philosophers of science, he uses the broader\n\u201cGillett-Aizawa framework\u201d to argue that highly specific\ndeterminate properties, not just generic determinable properties, are\nmultiply realized in this specific fashion. Such multiply realized\ndeterminate properties are indeed exactly similar across distinct\nrealizations, and so answer the dilemma posed by Shapiro and others\n (\u00a72.4\n above).\n\nCarrie Figdor (2010) challenges criticisms of multiple realization\nthat appeal to neuroscience, citing explicitly the works discussed in\n section 2.3\n and\n section 2.7\n above. She undertakes to demonstrate not only the empirical\nplausibility of mind-brain multiple realization, but also to clarify\nthe terms of the empirically-focused debate. Her scientific focus is\non \u201clocalizationism\u201d, especially the \u201cbrain mapping\nprojects\u201d using state-of-the-art functional neuroimaging (2010:\n420). Concerning the terms of the empirically-focused debate, Figdor\nargues that none of the multiple realization hypotheses common to the\nphilosophical literature is appropriate to this scientific endeavor.\nInstead she appeals to \u201cdegeneracy\u201d, a concept from\ngeneral biology meaning \u201cthe ability of elements that are\nstructurally different to perform the same function or yield the same\noutput\u201d, a characteristic of complexity ranging from the genetic\ncode to immune systems to populations (e.g., Edelman and Gally 2001).\nThis is the notion, Figdor claims, that has been co-opted by cognitive\nneuroscientists to mean \n\n\nfor a given cognitive function F, there is more than one\nnonisomorphic (nonidentical) structural element that can subserve\nF, either within an individual at a time, across individuals,\nor within an individual across times. (2010: 428) \n\n\nA major reason for cognitive neuroscientist co-opting degeneracy in\nthis fashion is the frequency of anomalous results in functional\nneuroimaging studies that show activations of brain areas that differ\nacross subjects, or even in a single subject across performances of\nthe same experimental task,. Figdor discusses numerous examples from\nrecent cognitive neuroscience, and carefully separates cases of\ndegeneracy that count as multiple realizations from others that do\nnot. She concludes that her \u201csketch of degeneracy in cognitive\nneuroscience suffices to show that [multiple realizability] is a\nviable empirical hypothesis (2010: 237). And she concludes by\naddressing specifically Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s (1999) empirical\narguments challenging multiple realizability from functional imaging\nstudies (see\n \u00a72.3\n above). Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s claim that neuroscience has been\nuseful for psychology is true, Figdor asserts, but does not challenge\na degeneracy-based empirical case for multiple realizability. And\nBechtel and Mundale\u2019s stronger claim, that neuroscientists\nimplicitly assume the falsity of multiple realization as reflected in\ntheir accepted practices, is itself shown to be false by the use of\ndegeneracy in cognitive neuroscience.\n3.2 New Attacks on Multiple Realizability\n\nCritics of multiple realizability and the standard arguments it has\nfigured into also extended their reach early in the twenty-first\ncentury. Lawrence Shapiro (2008) raises some methodological\ndifficulties involved in testing whether a given psychological kind\nactually is multiply realized. (For a related argument see Thomas\nPolger 2009.) Shapiro reminds us of the crucial role that auxiliary\nassumptions play in hypothesis testing generally (within a broadly\nhypothetico-deductive model), and considers a collection of explicit\nauxiliary assumptions that might be implicitly used to establish a\nmultiple realization hypothesis. He presents a recent ferret\nbrain-rewiring experiment as a scientific example, in which axonal\ninputs from the primary visual tract were redirected in ferret embryos\nto project to primary auditory cortex (see Sharma, Angelucci, &\nSur 2000 for the scientific details). An auxiliary hypothesis\nrequiring multiply realized higher-level (in this case, psychological)\nkinds to be \u201cexactly similar\u201d\u2014identical\u2014across\ndistinct realizers won\u2019t help the proponent of the standard\nmultiple realizability argument with this purported case. It is easy\nto measure better visual performance in the normally-wired control\nferrets compared to the re-wired experimental animals. While the\nexperimentally re-wired animals have some visual function, it is\ndiminished significantly compared to controls. \u201cExact\nsimilarity\u201d (identity) of visual function is thus not present\nacross these groups. On the other hand, one might argue for the\nmultiple realizability premise in this ferret re-wiring case using an\nauxiliary hypothesis that only requires similarity in multiply\nrealized higher level properties, yet still requires that differences\nacross the realizers should not be limited only to the differences\nthat cause differences in the realized (in this case, visual)\nproperties. Shapiro speculates that this auxiliary assumption seems\nbest to capture the sense of multiple realization stressed by\nproponents of the standard argument. But if we adopt it, again the\nferret re-wiring case seems not to provide an empirical instance of\nmultiple realization. Shapiro remarks: \u201cthe differences in\nferret brains explain nothing more than differences in ferret visual\nproperties\u201d (2008: 523). Shapiro also argues that his detailed\ndiscussion of hypothesis testing difficulties for any multiple\nrealization hypothesis reveals a flaw in Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s\n(1999) influential criticism (discussed in\n \u00a72.3\n above). Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s examples, drawn from the\ncomparative functional neuroanatomy of vision, only compared\nhomologous brain structures. But these only have differences that make\na difference in their visual properties, nothing else. Instead of\nthese examples, Shapiro insists, \u201cone should be looking at\ndifferent brains that reveal similar visual properties despite their\ndifferences\u201d (2008: 524)\u2014exactly the kinds of evidence\nthat Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s emphasis on homologies doesn\u2019t\nconsider.\n\nShapiro and Polger (2012) build upon Shapiro\u2019s account of the\ncomplexity of actually testing for scientifically-justified multiple\nrealization. They insist that these actual details render the\nsignificance of multiple realization far more dubious than\nphilosophers of mind typically suppose. They introduce explicit\ncriteria to capture the common assumption that multiple realization\nrequires not merely differences between realizing kinds, but\n\u201cdifferently the same\u201d: the features of entities A\nand B that lead them to be classified differently by the\nrealizing science S2 \u201cmust be among those that\nlead them to be commonly classified\u201d by the realized science\nS1 (2012: 282, criterion iii). This explicit\ncriterion rules out the popular assertion that camera eyes versus\ncompound eyes, with different photoreceptive chemicals in their\nretinal cones, is a genuine (empirical) instance of multiple\nrealization. Considered coarsely, such eyes are doing the same thing\nin the same way, so they\u2019re not \u201cdifferently the\nsame\u201d. Considered finely, the two kinds of eyes are sensitive to\ndifferent ranges and peaks of spectral stimulation, so they\u2019re\n\u201cdifferently different, not differently the same\u201d (2012:\n283\u2013284).\n\nShapiro and Polger\u2019s final explicit criterion captures the\n\u201cdifferently the same\u201d intuition in terms of quantitative\ndifferences. The relevant variation between entities A and\nB in realizing science S2 \u201cmust be\ngreater than\u201d the individual differences between A and\nB recognized by the realized science S1\n(2012: 282, criterion iv). The variation recognized by the realizing\nscience must not merely map onto individual differences between\nA and B recognized by the realized science. The demands\nin actually establishing multiple realization are thus quite strict.\nNot any old variation will do. According to Shapiro and Polger, these\nstrict demands show both that multiple realization in the sense\nrequired to fund the standard argument is \u201ca relatively rare\nphenomenon\u201d\u2014despite the vast variability everywhere in the\nworld\u2014and that a \u201crelatively modest\u201d mind-brain\nidentity theory has little to worry from it (2012: 284).\n\nSimilar in some ways to Couch\u2019s arguments (discussed in\n \u00a72.4\n above), Colin Klein raises a challenge to the scientific\ncontributions made by multiply realized kinds. Noting the variety of\nthings that materials science classifies as \u201cbrittle,\u201d\nKlein (2008) notes that few to none of the many scientific discoveries\nabout realization-restricted brittle things\u2014for example, about\nbrittle steel\u2014generalize to other realization-restricted\ntypes\u2014such as brittle glass. Klein insists that generalizations\nabout genuine scientific kinds should be projectable across instances\nof those kinds, so this requirement seems not to be met by a\nsignificant class of multiple realized kinds, namely, the\nrealization-restricted ones. Applying this point to psychological\nkinds, instead of supporting a scientifically-backed nonreductive\nphysicalism, it appears rather that special sciences should abandon\nmultiply realized kinds. Klein notes that proponents of\nscientifically-based multiple realizability can find terms in special\nsciences that figure in legitimate explanations, and so appear to\nrefer to projectable multiply realize kinds. But close investigation\nof some paradigmatic examples reveals these to be idealizations of\nactual kinds. Special-science kind-terms are thus typically ambiguous.\nSometimes a given term refers to an actual but realization-restricted\nkind. Other times it refers to features of explanatory but non-actual\nidealized models. (Klein 2008 illustrates this ambiguity with his\ndetailed example from materials science.) Neither suffices to provide\na kind of actual multiple realization that the standard argument\nrequires. However, he insists that his argument isn\u2019t entirely\nnegative for non-reductive physicalism. Idealizations can function in\nexplanations that are autonomous in an important sense from lower\nlevel sciences. And furthermore, Klein argues, Jaegwon Kim\u2019s\n(1992) assumption that\nall explanatory work in science must appeal to realization-restricted\nkinds and properties (discussed in\n \u00a72\n above), is simply incorrect. Still, Klein insists, there appear to be\nno actual and projectable\u2014hence genuinely\nscientific\u2014multiple realized kinds.\n\nBickle (2010) questions whether the \u201csecond-wave\u201d of\ncriticisms of the standard argument, those that challenge the multiple\nrealization premise itself (discussed in\n \u00a72.4\n and this section above), give aid and comfort to psychoneural\nreductionists. Since psychoneural reductionism was one of the explicit\ntargets of the standard multiple realization argument, one might\nplausibly assume that they do. Yet none of those who offer these\n\u201csecond-wave\u201d challenges (Shapiro, Polger, Couch) identify\nthemselves as \u201creductionists\u201d (with the possible exception\nof Shapiro, and more recently Bechtel 2009, although his response to\nthe multiple realization argument figures nowhere in his plumb for\n\u201cmechanistic reduction\u201d). Some of these\n\u201csecond-wave\u201d critics, such as Polger 2004, are explicitly\nanti-reductionist. (Though Polger 2004 is also explicitly\nanti-anti-reduction. He argues that multiple realization has little if\nanything to do with reduction.) This fact alone should give a\npsychoneural reductionist pause. Second, the direction that the\nsecond-wave debates have developed, starting with Gillett\u2019s\n(2003) criticisms\u2014deeply into the nature of the realization\nrelation, and so deeply into the metaphysics of science rather than\ninto science itself\u2014should prompt the psychoneural reductionist\nwith a metascientific bent to simply tell the second-wavers, thanks\nfor nothing! Does that leave psychoneural reductionism back on its\nheels, in light of the standard multiple realization argument? Not at\nall, Bickle (2010) insists. For the \u201cfirst-wave\u201d\nactual-scientific-history challenge to the first premise of the\nstandard argument, and the initial critical discussions (see\n \u00a72.1,\n \u00a72.2, and\n \u00a72.5\n above) turns out never to have been rejoined by anti-reductionists.\nWhy not? Bickle speculates that metaphysics was the culprit.\nNon-reductive physicalists seem to have assumed that by rejoining\narguments of metaphysicans like Kim (1992), they thereby dismissed the\nentire first-wave of challenges. Many of the challenges discussed in\n section 2\n above shows that this is not the case. There are numerous examples of\nmultiply realized kinds that are components of scientific theories\nwidely acknowledged to having been reduced to other theories. So\nmultiple realization alone is no barrier to actual scientific\nreduction. The detailed scientific cases that illuminate many of those\n\u201cfirst-wave\u201d challenge to the standard multiple\nrealizability argument remain unanswered to this day.\n\nSo well into the second decade of the new millennium, a renewed\ncritical interest in multiple realizability continued to generate new\ndiscussions and arguments on both sides, pro and can. The assumption,\nunfortunately still too common in philosophy of mind, that multiple\nrealizability \u201cseals the deal\u201d against reductive\nphysicalism and mind-brain identity theory, was mistaken back in the\n1970s and 1980s (see\n \u00a72\n above), and grew even more discredited by the full scope of published\nliterature on the topic that has followed since. But equally\nunfortunately, the literature on multiple realizability had taken off\nin numerous varied directions, and following out any one of these\nleads one quickly into detailed complicated and technical discussions,\nin both philosophy and science, and often at quite a distance from\nthose who follow out arguments in other directions. And the fate of\none of the most influential arguments in late-twentieth century\nAnglo-American philosophy hangs in the balance, in all of these\ndebates. By the second decade of the new millennium, concerns about\nmultiple realizability arguments had grown beyond their philosophy of\nmind origins, into more general questions about relationships\nobtaining between sciences addressing higher and lower levels of the\nworld\u2019s organization. What the issue needed now was a single\nwork that captured both the full scope of writings on this topic, and\nwith a focus unifying all of these diverging literatures. Fortunately,\nsuch a work appeared, and it and its critical reception is the focus\non the next section.\n4. The Multiple Realization Book and Its Initial Critical Reception\n\nThomas Polger\u2019s and Lawrence Shapiro\u2019s The Multiple\nRealization Book (2016) provided what the increasingly\nfragmenting literature on multiple realizability needed. It is the\nfirst book-length treatment of the topic, including many of the\nbroader arguments the topic had become part of. The book pulls\ntogether much of the history of work on the topic, plus the more\nrecent work by both proponents and opponents, and usefully organizes\nall of this around numerous key themes that had come to frame the\nmyriad debates. Polger\u2019s and Shapiro\u2019s goal is not simply\nto review or clarify the various positions, however. They have a\nposition to push. They end up developing and defending a mind-brain\nidentity theory that explicitly recognizes a sense of the autonomy of\npsychology from neuroscience. And as one might expect, critics of\ntheir view quickly responded. The unifying focus that this book\noffers, and its initial critical reception, make a detailed discussion\nof it a useful focus for where the broader issues about multiple\nrealizability stand now, at the end of the second decade of the\ntwentieth century.\n\nPolger and Shapiro begin by focusing on the key contention that\nfunctionalists and \u201crealization physicalists\u201d have\nemphasized to support their views over identity theories. That thesis\nis \u201cGenerality\u201d, namely that \n\n\npsychological states are general rather than species-bound, such that\na range of creatures may possess the same psychological state. (2016:\n15) \n\n\nAnd the key premise offered in support of this contention, going back\nto Putnam\u2019s work (presented in\n \u00a71\n above) is multiple realizability. This contention sets the agenda for\nthe book: Polger and Shapiro will argue that there is not the sort of\nwidespread multiple realization of mental states and processes that\nwould be needed to support functionalism or realization physicalism\nover identity theory. Importantly, Polger and Shapiro do not deny that\ncases of multiple realization exist. Rather, they insist that the\ndebate between functionalists and mind-brain identity theorists should\nbe guided primarily by the question, \n\n\ndoes the best overall model of psychological and neuroscientific\nprocesses make substantial and important use of identities? (2016: 34)\n\n\n\nTheir goal is to defend an affirmative answer.\n\nPolger and Shapiro\u2019s book confirms that multiple realization has\nof late come to be fought in the metaphysics of science literature. In\nkeeping, they begin by offering an account of the ontological\nrealization relation. And following the lead of their (Shapiro &\nPolger 2012) paper (discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n above) they use this account to scout the types of evidence and\nconcerns relevant to deciding between realization physicalisms and\nidentity theories. They restrict the scope of their arguments to\nactual proposed cases of realization, eschewing at least initially\nconcern with philosophers\u2019 imagined cases; they are solely\nconcerned at the outset with multiple realization as an empirical\nhypothesis. They are also careful to point out that multiple\nrealization is logically narrower than mere variation. Working\ndirectly with Putnam\u2019s (1967) discussion, Polger and Shapiro\narticulate the \u201cBasic Recipe\u201d for finding occurrences of\nmultiple realization: \u201cMultiple realization occurs if and only\nif two (or more) systems perform the same function in different\nways\u201d (2016: 45). While this characterization requires further\nrefinement, even it is enough to rule out some kinds of\n\u201csameness\u201d that are not evidence for multiple realization,\ni.e., sameness of behavioral output. Two systems exhibiting the same\nbehavior in the same circumstances, Polger and Shapiro insist, does\nnot establish sameness of underlying psychological function generating\nthat behavior. \n\nFurther refinements introduce \u201crelevance\u201d into Polger and\nShapiro\u2019s account. The very function shared by the two kinds\nthat classifies them as the same in the realized science must be what\nis realized by different mechanisms that classify them as different in\nthe realizing science. Further, the relevant differences in the\nrealizers contribute to the sameness of function; the kinds are\n\u201cnot just differently different, they are differently the\nsame\u201d (2016: 75). Polger and Shapiro show that simple (camera)\nand compound eyes meet their fully revised \u201cOfficial\nRecipe\u201d for genuinely multiply realized kinds. They write: \n\n\nMultiple realization requires a special pattern of variation:\nrelevantly the same function performed in relevantly different ways,\nwhere the differences contribute to the sameness in function and not\njust to the differences in function. (2016: 77) \n\n\nArmed with their Official Recipe, Polger and Shapiro next seek to\ndismiss the evidence commonly put forward by proponents of multiple\nrealization as arguments for functionalism or realization-physicalism\nover mind-brain identity theory. They first consider \u201cdirect\nevidence\u201d, empirical cases presented as genuine instances of\nmultiple realization of the mental on the physical. One type is\n\u201ccortical functional plasticity\u201d, in both\n\u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d varieties. A\n\u201ccommon\u201d kind is cortical reorganization, where neurons in\na specific cortical region take on a new function following damage to\nnerves or axons providing their normal input. A more\n\u201cradical\u201d variety is exemplified by the well-known work in\ndeveloping ferrets, in which retinal projections were redirected to\nthe medial, rather than the lateral geniculate nucleus in the\nthalamus, and hence retinal input was projected to auditory, rather\nthan visual cortex (see the discussion of Shapiro 2008 in\n \u00a73.2\n above). Polger and Shapiro argue that both of these varieties fail to\nmeet at least one condition of their Official Recipe, so neither\ncounts as a genuine instance of mental-to-physical multiple\nrealization. The \u201ccommon\u201d case involves change in\nfunction\u2014in the specific example, neuronal activity in the\nreorganized region of primate somatosensory cortex now represents\nstimulation to a different region of the monkey\u2019s hand. In the\n\u201cradical\u201d ferret rewiring case, the visual capacities of\nthe experimental ferrets\u2019 auditory cortex, compared to those of\nintact control ferrets, differ significantly, e.g., the experimental\nferrets show significantly deficient performances on visual\ndiscrimination tasks compared with controls\u2019 performances.\n\nA second kind of direct evidence that Polger and Shapiro consider is\nkind splitting in scientific practice. Again, their Official Recipe\nfigures into their response. They reformulate Aizawa and\nGillett\u2019s (2011) key example, the variations in cone opsins in\nhuman color vision (see discussion in\n \u00a73.1\n above) into Official Recipe format, and deny that it is a case of\ngenuine multiple realization. The cited differences among the opsins\nare not distinct from individual differences among those possessing\nhuman trichromatic color vision, violating one condition of the\nOfficial Recipe.\n\nPolger and Shapiro then extend their discussion of evidence to\nconsider two \u201cindirect\u201d kinds for mental-to-physical\nmultiple realizability. This evidence seeks to show that, in\nlight of various observations, the multiple realizability\nhypothesis is more likely to be true than the mind-brain identity\nhypothesis. They begin by offering a canonical form for indirect\nevidence arguments, which compares the likelihood of multiple\nrealizability versus the unlikelihood of mind-brain identities in\nlight of the evidence. They then recast Block and Fodor\u2019s (1972)\nappeal to neural plasticity (see discussion in\n \u00a71.3\n above), an appeal to evolutionary convergence of psychological states\nand processes, and an appeal to the \u201cconceptual\npossibility\u201d of artificial minds into this canonical form, and\nargue that all three arguments fail. Finally they consider an appeal\nto the prevalence of the \u201ccomputational theory of mind\u201d\nwithin current cognitive science and psychology as an indirect\nargument for multiple realizability. In agreement with some recent\nmechanists (e.g., Kaplan and Craver 2011), Polger and Shapiro insist\nthat many \u201ccomputational explanations\u201d are better\nunderstood \u201cas precise descriptions of the task or behavior to\nbe explained\u201d rather than as explanations (2016: 154). And while\nthey admit that the \u201crepresentationalist\u201d variety of\ncomputationalism (of which Fodor\u2019s 1975 Language of Thought is a\nparadigmatic example) does rule out the possibility of mind-brain\nidentities, they point out that this kind of computationalism is\n\u201cnot the only game in town\u201d anymore (2016: 158). Numerous\nviable competing alternatives to it exist\u2014Polger and Shapiro\nmention connectionism, strong and \u201cruthless\u201d reductionism,\nand mechanism explicitly in this context\u2014and all those make room\nfor mind-brain identities.\n\nPolger and Shapiro wrap up the book by absolving their identity\ntheory, which rests on their treatment of multiple realizability, of\nsome mistaken charges. They argue that their account is not\nontologically eliminativist about psychological kinds, because none of\ntheir three types of arguments against multiple\nrealization\u2014\u201cunificationist\u201d arguments which find\nrelevant commonalities in the realizing kinds, \u201cheuristic,\nabstraction, and idealization\u201d arguments that characterize\npractices in contemporary cognitive science, and their plump for\ntaxonomic \u201ckind splitting\u201d\u2014leads to any kind of\ntroubling eliminativist conclusion. And by adopting James\nWoodward\u2019s (2003) \u201cinterventionist\ndifference-making\u201d account of causal explanation, Polger and\nShapiro deflect the charge that their identity theory undermines the\nlegitimacy of psychological explanations, and thus rules out any\nautonomy for psychology vis-\u00e0-vis neuroscience. Such a charge, they\ninsist, rests on an overly stringent and misguided understanding of\nscientific explanation. Identity theorists can be and should be\npluralists about scientific explanation. Neuroscientists can appeal to\nneural causes, psychologists and cognitive scientists to mental\ncauses. Since both can cite causal invariances at their respective\nlevels, both offer genuine explanations. Despite the mind-brain\nidentities, psychology remains a methodologically autonomous science.\n(Their defense of psychology\u2019s autonomy resembles\nWoodward\u2019s recent more general defense of a general kind of\nexplanatory autonomy, see Woodward forthcoming.)\n\nWe have dwelled in some detail on Polger and Shapiro\u2019s (2016)\nbook because of its scope and the unifying focus it offers for\nphilosophical discussions of multiple realization, both historical and\nrecent. Similarly, initial criticisms of the book ranged from ones\nsquarely in philosophy of mind, to others aimed at more broadly\nmetaphysics of science considerations. Not surprisingly, given that\nthe book defends a version of mind-brain identity theory, which has\nbeen considered indefensible, or at best fringe, for some time, it met\nwith rapid criticism from philosophers of mind. Ronald Endicott (2017)\ntakes Polger and Shapiro to task for offering few (if any) examples of\nexplicit mind-brain identities. Endicott\u2019s criticism is fair\nenough, in one sense. Polger and Shapiro nowhere attempt to catalogue\nor discuss specific identity claims. Neither, of course, did U.T.\nPlace or J.J.C. Smart in their seminal works first defending the view;\nbut those works were published sixty or more years ago, and\nneuroscience has progressed rapidly over that time. Polger and Shapiro\ndo criticize numerous claims to have found multiple realization of\nmind on brain, so perhaps those discussions can serve implicitly as\nmind-brain identity claims. But circa 2016, one reasonably could have\nhoped for some examples of specific mind-brain identities, and a\ndefense of the evidence that supports them.\n\nUmut Baysan (2018) raises two challenges. His first is squarely within\nphilosophy of mind. He contends that Polger and Shapiro change\n\u201cthe rules of the game\u201d over which functionalists/realization physicalists and identity theorists are disputing. Polger\nand Shapiro saddle the former with defending a general hypothesis,\ni.e., all psychological kinds are functional kinds or realized kinds;\nwhile identity theorists seek only to defend a far weaker existential\nclaim, i.e., that there are some instances of mind-brain identities.\nSecond, and more generally, Baysan takes Polger and Shapiro to task\nfor limiting their concern to the empirical hypothesis, multiple\nrealization, and refusing to speak to concerns about metaphysically\npossible realizers of mental kinds, or multiple realizability. Baysan\ninsists that some philosophers are still concerned with the latter,\nand a work that purports to be a book-length treatment of the general\ntopic will leave these philosophers justifiably disappointed. On the\nfirst point, Baysan is right that Polger and Shapiro do seek to\nreorient this fifty-year-old debate, and they characterize\nfunctionalism and realization physicalism as quite general hypotheses.\nBut Baysan\u2019s account of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s weakened\nidentity theory seems to miss the point of their explicit\nreformulation of the multiple realization problem, into first and\nforemost the question, \n\n\ndoes the best overall model of psychological and neuroscientific\nprocesses make substantial and important use of identities? (Polger\nand Shapiro 2016: 34) \n\n\nThat reformulated focus requires a much stronger defense than does\nBaysan\u2019s existential hypothesis interpretation of their identity\ntheory. By it Polger and Shapiro are committed to arguing that\nidentity theory provides \u201cthe best overall model\u201d of\npsychology\u2019s relationship to neuroscience. (Whether they succeed\nin making this argument is a separate issue.) And as far as a need to\ndiscuss metaphysical possibilities, and hence multiple realizability\nin the sense that some philosophers understand it, that depends on who\none takes one\u2019s audience to be. If one is concerned strictly\nabout multiple realization as a part of the philosophy of the special\nsciences\u2014as some discussants of multiple realization\nare\u2014metaphysical possibilities and realizations of the mental in\n\u201cmetaphysically possible worlds\u201d can strike one as\nphilosophical jibber-jabber, the kind of discussions that give\nphilosophy a bad name within broader twenty-first-century intellectual\ncontexts. Curiously, however, Polger and Shapiro seem not to want to\ntake that extreme a position. They locate their work squarely in the\nmetaphysics of science, not strictly in philosophy of science\nor metascience. Does that leave them open to the charge of needing to\nconsider at least some metaphysical possibilities, and so some kinds\nof multiple realizability? We will turn to this problem later\nin this section, in light of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s replies to\nother criticisms.\n\nDanny Booth (2018) is sympathetic to Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\nbroader project, and to their conclusion about the importance of\nmind-brain identities in contemporary cognitive science. But he\nworries about their deference to scientists concerning how mental\nkinds are individuated, and thus identified across distinct physical\nrealizations, as their Official Recipe for multiple realization\nproposes. He points out that many scientists view questions about\nmental kind individuation as \u201cphilosophical\u201d, and so punt\nthis concern back to philosophers. Scientists also sometimes\nindividuate mental kinds on quite narrow grounds; Booth here cites\nJacqueline Sullivan\u2019s recent discussions of the difficulty of\nidentifying mental kinds across neuroscience labs that employ\ndifferent protocols (see discussion of Sullivan\u2019s work in the\n\u201cPhilosophy of Neuroscience\u201d entry, this encyclopedia).\nSometimes they do so purely on behavioral grounds which operationalize\nmental kinds for laboratory experimentation. The latter approach flies\ndirectly in the face of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s explicit rejection\nof mental kind identity in their Official Recipe for multiple\nrealization. Booth also worries about Polger and Shapiro\u2019s more\ngeneral appeal to an interventionist account of causation to salvage\n\u201cactual\u201d autonomy for psychology. Nothing stops\nfunctionalists or realization physicalists from adopting a similar\napproach to saving psychology\u2019s autonomy, and in fact many avail\nthemselves of this approach. Booth worries that \n\n\nthis leaves very little that distinguishes Modest Identity Theory from\nmore traditional versions of functionalism. (2018: 440) \n\n\nThat Polger and Shapiro\u2019s view shares more points in common with\ntraditional functionalism than with traditionally\n\u201creductionist\u201d versions of identity theory leaves Booth\nwondering whether Polger and Shapiro\u2019s account itself faces some\nof the same challenges they direct at functionalism. \n\nMark Couch (2018) worries about Polger and Shapiro\u2019s general\ncharacterization of multiple realization in terms of the taxonomies\noffered by different sciences, as opposed to more typical accounts in\nterms of properties or kinds in the world. About this shift, Couch\nfirst points out that scientists in any given field aren\u2019t\nalways in agreement about how to taxonomize the phenomena they\naddress. So appealing to \u201cscientists\u2019 taxonomies\u201d\nmight not be sufficient, and philosophers might be forced back to\nconsidering \u201cindependently existing kinds\u201d (2018: 421).\nPolger and Shapiro\u2019s refocused account also might not address\nwhat has interested philosophers about multiple realization, namely,\nconcerns about metaphysical relations holding between independently\nexisting properties and kinds; independent, that is, of any taxonomic\npractices. This leads Couch to worry about Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\naccount of \u201crelevant differences\u201d in their \u201cOfficial\nRecipe\u201d, especially their account of how we decide when this\ncondition has been met. He senses an internal tension lurking here. On\nthe one hand, \n\n\nthe sciences that deal with the putative realizers tell us which\ndifferences in them amount to different ways of producing their\neffects and which do not. (Polger and Shapiro 2016: 62) \n\n\nBut this \u201cofficial view\u201d seems at odds with a second\n\u201cunofficial\u201d way Polger and Shapiro cash \u201crelevant\ndifferences\u201d: \u201ca matter of whether a property has an\nexplanatory role with respect to a function\u201d (Couch 2018: 424).\nThis \u201cunofficial\u201d understanding, Couch insists, sees\nrelevance as an explanatory relation between properties or kinds in\nnature, and thus not merely a matter of what scientists \u201ctell\nus\u201d. These two readings of \u201crelevant differences\u201d\nstrike Couch as making it unclear how the Official Recipe will apply\nto Polger\u2019s and Shapiro\u2019s own examples of multiple\nrealized kinds.\n\nIn contrast with Booth and Couch, who challenges Polger and Shapiro\nfor deferring too much to scientists and their taxonomies, Mazviita\nChirimuuta chides them for not paying enough attention to actual\n\u201cfunctional thinking\u201d in the life sciences, and thus\nrelying too heavily on \u201ctoy examples\u201d like corkscrews.\nChirimuuta agrees with Polger and Shapiro that the old\nphilosophers\u2019 notion of multiple realization,\n\u201cMR1.0\u201d, needs replacing, but suggests looking directly\ninto three areas of the life sciences for its replacement,\n\u201cMR2.0\u201d. One area is evolutionary approaches, where\nChirimuuta mentions explicitly Ernst Mayr\u2019s proximate/ultimate\nexplanation distinction, the latter referring to the evolutionary\nfunction or \u201cpurpose\u201d of a behavior, and so serves as a\n\u201cnecessary, non-replaceable completement\u201d of the former\n(2018: 407). The second area is reverse engineering, which posits a\nfunction in the nervous system and then works back to see how the\nphysical components perform it. The third area is the study of\nrobustness in biological systems, whereby the function of a system is\nmaintained despite alterations in lower-level mechanisms. Chirimuuta\nnotes that Criterion IV (the \u201cdifferently the same\u201d\ncondition mentioned above) of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\n\u201cOfficial Recipe\u201d for genuine multiple realization would\nprobably preclude many cases of biological robustness, in the same\nfashion Polger and Shapiro used it to rule out the\n\u201cradical\u201d ferret rewiring example (discussed above). But\nfor Chirimuuta, this consequence suggests that Polger and\nShapiro\u2019s \u201cOfficial Recipe\u201d may be \u201cmissing\nsomething interesting about the organization of living systems\u201d\n(2018: 408); and so may not be sensitive enough to real scientific\npractice. She notes that for all their talk about relying on\nscientists\u2019 judgments and taxonomies, Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\nfavorite \u201ctoy example\u201d, the corkscrew, comes up a lot when\nthe conditions on genuine multiple realization are being articulated\nand defended. Her point is that a closer look at some real sciences\nthat engage in functional thinking, at the point when Polger and\nShapiro are developing and defending their basic analysis of multiple\nrealization, might have generated a different account of what multiple\nrealization is (\u201cMR2.0\u201d). As opposed to what Polger and\nShapiro actually do with real scientific examples, namely bring them\nup to debunk claims about successful multiple realization based on\ntheir already existing detailed analysis. Such an approach seemingly\nwould have produced an account tied much more closely to actual\nscientific practice.\n\nIn their (2018) Polger and Shapiro respond to these criticisms. They\nbegin by clarifying what they call a common misconception of their\nview (and not just among these critics), that they don\u2019t take\nseriously multiple realizability. They claim they do, but\nthey insist that even these metaphysical concerns \u201care not\nimmune from evidential demands\u201d (2018: 448). The best evidence\nfor multiple realizability would be widespread instances of\nmultiple realization; but this, as they argued extensively in\ntheir (2016), is exactly what is lacking. Other kinds of evidence for\nmultiple realizability include equipotentiality, evolutionary\nconvergence, and computational explanations in the relevant sciences,\nbut Polger and Shapiro insist that they have argued in their book that\nthese kinds of evidence are lacking, too.\n\nThey then take up the two criticisms, one from both Booth and Couch,\nthe other from Chirimuuta, which pull in opposite directions\nconcerning their dependence on science. Booth and Couch both insisted\nthat Polger and Shapiro rely too heavily on taxonomies postulated by\nscientists to characterize genuine instances of multiple realization.\nPolger and Shapiro take both Booth\u2019s and Couch\u2019s worry to\nbe that their approach thereby shackles their account to \u201cthe\nwhim of scientists\u201d (2018: 449). They remind us that by\n\u201ctaxonomy\u201d they refer to \u201cwhatever a particular\nscience views as belonging within its domain\u201d (2018: 449). The\nsciences themselves provide those; the best evidence we can have for\nany science\u2019s \u201contological commitments\u201d are\n\u201cthe taxonomic representations and models that it uses\u201d\n(2018: 450). Both Polger and Shapiro, and their multiple realization\nproponents, are assuming that the relevant sciences track real\ndistinctions in the world. Polger and Shapiro agree that sciences can\nand do mischaracterize these, but \u201cthat problem has to do with\nthe fallibility of evidence and not with our account of multiple\nrealization\u201d (2018: 450). Polger and Shapiro also admit that\ntheir reference to the notion of taxonomies has not always been clear;\nbut nevertheless appealing to scientific taxonomies as a form of\nevidence for multiple realization is useful. Their focus on scientific\ntaxonomies is thus not incompatible with more traditional\nphilosophical discussions about multiple realization.\n\nThey then turn to Chirimuuta\u2019s contrary criticism, that in\ndeveloping their account of multiple realization they ignore\n\u201cfunctional thinking\u201d in real biology and neuroscience.\nThey begin by focusing on one of Chirimuuta\u2019s claims, that \n\n\nfunctional classifications capture regularities not apparent when\ndescription is restricted to more fine-grained vocabulary (be it\nphysical, chemical, or neuroanatomical), \n\n\nwith these classifications thus averting us to the \u201climitations\nof purely reductive research agendas in biology and\nneuroscience\u201d (Chirimuuta 2018: 409). If Chirimuuta is here\nadvocating pluralism about scientific explanation, Polger and Shapiro\nare in full agreement; they are avowed methodological pluralists. But\nif Chirimuuta is here advocating some kind of \u201cEssential\nAutonomy Thesis\u201d, that higher-level regularities are\n\u201csomehow invisible\u201d to would-be reducing explanations, or\n\u201ccan only be captured in the proprietary vocabulary of a special\nscience\u201d, then Chirimuuta\u2019s MR2.0 sounds suspiciously like\nMR1.0, with the latter being a view she herself insists needs to be\nrejected. They then insist that Chirimuuta\u2019s own discussion of\nthe role of functional thinking in biology and neuroscience stresses\nits methodological importance. Again, Polger and Shapiro have\nno complaint about that. Their critical focus is on an inference from\nthis pluralist methodology and the ability to model a system in this\nfashion to the conclusion that the system is ipso facto\nmultiply realizable\u201d (2018: 454\u2013455). Being a fellow\nrejecter of MR1.0 and its accompanying Essential Autonomy Thesis,\nPolger and Shapiro insist that Chirimuuta should also reject any such\ninference.\n\nIn closing this section, it should be clear that the extension of\nphilosophical discussions about multiple realization, which began with\nthe \u201csecond-wave\u201d of criticisms around the year 2000,\ncontinues apace. The specific philosophical arena in which these\ndiscussions take place continues to expand, from the topic\u2019s\norigins in mid-twentieth century philosophy of mind through its\nturn-of-the millennium path into the philosophy of the cognitive\nsciences and neuroscience, and lately more squarely in the general\nmetaphysics of science. These shifts can make the details of the\nevolving discussions difficult to track. Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\n(2016) book, and the critical scrutiny across all of these fields that\nit spurred, provides a useful framework for organizing these many\ndirections, despite what one judges about its skepticism about the\nextent of multiple realization and its defense of a mind-brain\nidentity theory. The literature over the last twenty years should put\nto rest the still-too-prominent view in the philosophy of mind that\nmultiple realization spells doom for reductive materialism and\nmind-brain identity theory once and for all, as well as the\nstill-too-prominent view in some quarters in philosophy of science\nthat multiple realization, or at least its anti-reductionist\nconsequences, has been vanquished for good. Both views look uninformed\nand badly outdated in light of the detailed history of multiple\nrealization, a history which now spans more than a half-century of\nAnglo-American philosophy.\n",
