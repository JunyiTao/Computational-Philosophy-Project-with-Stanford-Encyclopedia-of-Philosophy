    "main_text": "Skepticism\n2. Skepticism\nWith an eye to the alleged power of inference to prove the\nexistence of God or personal survival, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka\nmaterialist school recognizes perception as a knowledge source but not\ninference nor any other candidate. Inference depends upon\ngeneralizations which outstrip perceptual evidence, everything F as a\nG. No one can know that, C\u0101rv\u0101ka claims. Testimony is also no\ngood since it presupposes that a speaker would tell the truth and\nthus is subject to the same criticism of lack of evidence. And so on\nthrough the other candidates (M\u0101dhava,\nSarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e43graha). The\nstandard response is pragmatic. We could not act as we do if we could\nnot rely on inference (etc.) albeit inference does depend on\ngeneralization that (often, not invariably) outstrips experience. The\nskeptic himself relies on such generalizations when he opens his mouth\nto voice his skepticism, by using words with repeatable meanings\n(Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, inference\nchapter, Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i).\nThe C\u0101rv\u0101ka argument identifying the problem of induction\nis turned by both Buddhist and Ny\u0101ya philosophers into an argument\nfor fallibilism about inference. What we take to be the result of a\ngenuine inference may turn out to hinge on a fallacy, a\nhetv-\u0101bh\u0101sa, an apparent but misleading \u201creason\u201d or\nsign (see the section below on inference). But to accept that sometimes\nwe reason in ways that mimic but fail to instantiate right forms is not\nto be a skeptic. Indeed, the very concept of a fallacy\n(hetv-\u0101bh\u0101sa) presupposes that of the veritable\nreason or sign (hetu), a veritable prover making us have new\nknowledge.\n\nA different kind of skepticism is broader in scope, not restricted to\ninference or other candidate sources. It appears both in Buddhism and\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta, but let us rehearse only the Buddhist version. By\ndiscerning absurdities that arise in viewing anything as having an\nindependent existence, one realizes, as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says, that\neverything is ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va, \u201cwithout a\nreality of its own.\u201d Applying this to oneself, one comes to see the\ntruth of the Buddha\u2019s teaching of an\u0101tman, \u201cno-self,\u201d\nwhich is viewed as a decisive step toward the summum bonum of\nenlightenment and perfection\n(praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101). In\nparticular, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna identifies a problem of a justification\nregress in the pram\u0101\u1e47a program\n(Vigraha-vyav\u0101rtin\u012b, v. 33), which assumes\nthat process and result can be separated, along with various conundra\nor paradoxes concerning relations (such as the so-called Bradley\nproblem). The Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra argues that the\nN\u0101g\u0101rjunian type of skepticism is self-defeating (4.2.26\u201336),\nbut many of the problems identified by the Buddhist (and his\nintellectual inheritors such as\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a) occupy the\nreflections of philosophers for centuries, Buddhist as well as\nNy\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 among Vedic schools in particular.\n\n",
