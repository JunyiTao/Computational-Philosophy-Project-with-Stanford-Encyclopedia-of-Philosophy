Although this\nobjection is often voiced by critics of public reason, the existing\nliterature provides relatively little in the way of detailed\ncase-by-case analysis of the plausibility of the charge (exceptions\ninclude J. Williams 2015; J. Williams 2017, Other Internet Resources;\nGreenawalt 1988). In particular, the charge of incompleteness seems\nmost plausible when we consider certain \u201cproblems of\nextension\u201d, that is, topics where it is unclear whether public\nreason can be extended to provide reasonable answers (Rawls 1996,\n244\u2013246). Some examples of these problems include: What\nprinciples should regulate our treatment of future generations? What\nprinciples should regulate our treatment of animals and nature? What\nprinciples should apply to decisions about the provision of health\ncare? For each of these questions, there is a plausible prima\nfacie case that our deliberations must be informed by\nconsiderations that go beyond the limits of public reason and appeal\nto controversial claims about the moral status of animals, or future\npersons, or particular claims about what constitutes human\nflourishing. But whether this is indeed the case with regard to these\nissues, among others, is something that awaits more sustained\nanalysis.\n",
