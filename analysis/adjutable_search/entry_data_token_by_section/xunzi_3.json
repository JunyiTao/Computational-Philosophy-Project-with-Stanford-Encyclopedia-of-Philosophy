The Source of the Rituals: Heaven (tian \u5929) and the Way (dao \u9053)\n\nXunzi places so much emphasis on the role of the rituals in moral\nself-cultivation that one might ask how the sages managed to perfect\nthemselves when they did not have such a model themselves. A glimpse\nof the answer was already afforded by Xunzi\u2019s insistence that\nthe rituals surpass any arbitrary code of conduct because they accord\nwith fundamental human tendencies. But elsewhere the question is\naddressed more fully. The rituals, it turns out, are the equivalent of\nhelpful signposts. Just as those who ford rivers \u201cmark\u201d\n(biao \u8868) treacherous spots, the sages \u201cmarked\nthe Way\u201d (biao dao \u8868\u9053) by means of\nrituals, so that people would no longer stumble (Xunzi\n17.11).\n\nThe Way that Xunzi invokes in this simile is sometimes called\n\u201cconstancy\u201d (chang \u5e38). Heaven\u2019s\nprocesses (tianxing \u5929\u884c) do not change from one\nepoch to the\n next;[7]\n thus one must learn how to respond to them with \u201cthe right\norder\u201d (zhi \u6cbb), whereafter it would be either\nignorant or hypocritical to blame Heaven for one\u2019s misfortune.\nWhen a ruler governs a state well, there are bound to be good results;\nwhen a ruler governs a state badly, there are bound to be bad results.\nDisasters can have no long-term consequences because a well governed\nstate will prosper even in the face of disasters, and a poorly\ngoverned state will be vanquished even if it avoids disasters\naltogether. (Xunzi\u2019s opinion of foreseeable natural disasters\nsuch as hurricanes would undoubtedly have been that they strike\nall states, but a well governed state will be prepared for\nsuch an event, whereas a poorly governed state will be in no position\nto respond to the crisis.) Consequently, Heaven plays a sure but\nindirect role in determining our fortune or misfortune. Heaven never\nintercedes directly in human affairs, but human affairs are certain to\nsucceed or fail according to a timeless pattern that Heaven determined\nbefore human beings existed. \u201cThe revolutions of the sun, moon,\nand stars, and the cyclical calendar\u2014these were the same under\nYu \u79b9 and Jie \u6840\u201d (Xunzi 17.4), he notes,\nreferring to a paradigmatic sage king and tyrant, respectively. The\nsame is true of the regular and predictable sequence of the\nseasons\u2014a particularly significant example, as we shall see.\n\nNext, Xunzi makes a crucial distinction between knowing Heaven\n(zhi tian \u77e5\u5929) and knowing the Way (zhi\ndao \u77e5\u9053). The former is impossible, and therefore a\nwaste of time to attempt, but the latter is open to all who try. To\ncite a modern parallel, it is not difficult to understand how\nthe force of gravity works by carefully observing its effects in the\nphenomenal world, but to understand why gravity works is a\ndifferent matter altogether. Xunzi would say that one should constrain\none\u2019s inquiries to learning how gravity works, and then think\nabout how to apply this irresistible force of nature to improve the\nlives of humankind (Fraser 2016: 297\u2013300). His attitude was not\nscientific in our sense. Speaking of \u201cthose who are enlightened\nabout the distinction between Heaven and human beings\u201d, he\nsays:\n\nTheir aspiration with respect to Heaven is no more than to observe the\nphenomena that can be taken as regular periods (e.g., the progression\nof the seasons or stars). Their aspiration with respect to Earth is no\nmore than to observe the matters that yield (sc. crops). Their\naspiration with respect to the four seasons is no more than to observe\nthe data that can be made to serve [humanity]. Their aspiration with\nrespect to yin \u9670 and yang \u967d is no more\nthan to observe their harmonious [interactions] that can bring about\norder. (Xunzi 17.3b)\n\n\nThus rituals are not merely received practices or convenient social\ninstitutions; they are practicable forms in which the sages aimed to\nencapsulate the fundamental patterns of the universe. No human being,\nnot even a sage, can know Heaven, but we can know Heaven\u2019s Way,\nwhich is the surest path to a flourishing and blessed life. Because\nhuman beings have limited knowledge and abilities, it is difficult for\nus to attain this deep understanding, and therefore the sages handed\ndown the rituals to help us follow in their footsteps.\n",
