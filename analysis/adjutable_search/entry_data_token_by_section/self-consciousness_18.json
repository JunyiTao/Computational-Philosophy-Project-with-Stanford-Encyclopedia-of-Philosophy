    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Infants and Non-Human Animals\n5. Self-Consciousness in Infants and Non-Human Animals\n\nAt what age can human infants be credited with self-consciousness? Is\nself-consciousness present beyond homo sapiens? Some\ntheorists, for example Berm\u00fadez (1998), claim that various\nforms of perceptual experience constitute a non-conceptual form of\nself-consciousness (see\n \u00a73).\n Others, for example Rosenthal (2005), claim that phenomenal\nconsciousness entails self-consciousness. If either view is correct\nthen self-consciousness, of some kind, can plausibly be attributed to\ncreatures other than adult humans. But when it comes to more\nsophisticated forms of self-awareness, matters are less clear. What is\nrequired is some empirical criterion for judging a creature\nself-conscious even if, as with infants and non-human animals, they\nare unable to provide evidence via their use of the\nfirst-person pronoun. Such evidence, if available, may reasonably be\nthought to shed light on both the phylogenetic and ontogenetic\ndevelopment of self-consciousness (Ferrari & Sternberg 1998;\nTerrace & Metcalfe 2005; see the entries on\n animal consciousness\n and\n animal cognition).\n",
