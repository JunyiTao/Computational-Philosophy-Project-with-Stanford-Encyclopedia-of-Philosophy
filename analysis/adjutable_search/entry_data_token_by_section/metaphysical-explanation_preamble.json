    "main_text": "\n\nExplanation comes in many forms.\n Scientific explanations\ntypically concern the\nnatural world, and typically proceed by citing causes of natural\nphenomena or subsuming them under empirical laws in some illuminating\nway.\n Mathematical explanations\ntypically concern the world\nof quantity and abstract structure, and typically proceed by proving a\ntheorem in some illuminating way. The present entry focuses on a\nfamily of explanations widely thought to be in some sense\ndistinctively metaphysical in character. Consider the\nfollowing non-exhaustive list of putative examples, which ought to be\nrecognizable to any metaphysician:\n\n(1)\nSocrates the philosopher, and this bust of him in our seminar\nroom, are both snub nosed because they share the property being\nsnub-nosed.\n(2)\nSocrates\u2019s cloak has a color because it is green.\n(3)\nSocrates is the very individual he is at least in part because he\nhas Sophroniscus as a father.\n(4)\nSocrates is just because his soul is well-ordered.\n\n\nStatements like (1)\u2013(4) at least purport to express\nexplanations on their surface: \u201cbecause\u201d is a\ncommon explanatory idiom, and any of a number of others could have\nbeen used instead (e.g., \u201cin virtue of\u201d, \u201caccounts\nfor\u201d, \u201cis the reason why\u201d, \u201cmakes it the case\nthat\u201d, or simply \u201cexplains\u201d). Moreover, statements\nlike (1)\u2013(4) are metaphysical at least in the sense\nthat they are commonly put forward and assessed in metaphysics, and\nproceed by citing distinctions of importance to metaphysics in some\nilluminating way. These include distinctions of\n property-instance,\n determinable-determinate,\n essence-accident,\n and\n analysans-analysandum\nthat appear to be at play in the examples above; others might include\n part-whole\n (e.g., \u201cThe vase is fragile because of its crystalline\nmicrostructure\u201d) and\n member-set\n (e.g., \u201cThe set {Socrates} exists because Socrates\nexists\u201d), among potentially others still.\n\n\nInterest in metaphysical explanation has witnessed a recent spike, yet\nthe topic is not a recent metaphysical innovation. Indeed, it is front\nand center in the very first sentence of the field\u2019s\nfoundational text, when Aristotle tells us that \u201cAll human\nbeings by nature desire to know\u201d (Metaphysics I.1,\n980a21; see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).\n For Aristotle, this desire is not fully satisfied until one\nunderstands the basic explanatory factors responsible for the broad\nstructure of reality (see Lear 1988: chs. 1 and 6). Set aside whether\nAristotle\u2019s claim about human nature is correct. Even if it is\nnot, a wealth of philosophical questions about the nature, varieties,\nand scope of metaphysical explanation emerge. Are these\n\u201cexplanatory factors\u201d of one type or many, and what are\nthey? What is it about \u201cthe broad structure of reality\u201d\nthat they explain? What type of understanding is gained by grasping\nthese explanatory factors? And even if human beings by nature desire\nmetaphysical explanations, to what extent (if any) can this natural\ndesire actually be satisfied?\n\nHistorical interest in metaphysical explanation was not\nAristotle\u2019s alone. Philosophers as diverse as Plato,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna), William of Ockham,\nSpinoza, Leibniz, Bolzano, Duhem, and Husserl (see Mulligan 2004 and\nalso\n related entries\n below), among many others, explicitly grappled with questions such as\nthose above, although some in a more skeptical vein than others.\nMoreover, countless other philosophers both inside metaphysics and out\nclearly presuppose that the notion is in good standing when discussing\nthe various types of metaphysical explanation that we discuss below.\nOur goal in the present entry, however, is not to provide a full\naccounting of how the concept has developed over time\u2014here, we\nfocus on framing the main questions and disputes that emerge when one\nattempts to state what metaphysical explanation is, exactly, and how\nit is supposed to work (if at all).\n\nOur first order of business is to clarify in what sense metaphysical\nexplanation is a form of non-causal explanation\n (\u00a71),\n and survey some putative varieties of metaphysical explanation\n (\u00a72).\n Afterwards, we survey three central, connected choice-points about\nhow to think about metaphysical explanation at the most abstract\nlevel. How are metaphysical explanations related to notions of\nnon-causal relationships such as property-instance, part-whole,\nessence-accident, derivative-ground, role-realizer, and others of\ncentral metaphysical importance that metaphysical explanations are\nsaid to derive their explanatory power from\n (\u00a73)?\n To what extent is metaphysical explanation a unified phenomenon\n (\u00a74)?\n And to what extent is it an objective, mind-independent phenomenon\n (\u00a75)?\n Next, we survey a recent research program that attempts to extend one\nof the four main models of scientific\nexplanation\u2014causal-mechanistic, nomological, unificationist, and\npragmatic\u2014to metaphysical explanation\n (\u00a76).\n We conclude by surveying some questions about the scope of\nmetaphysical explanation\n (\u00a77).\n\nA clarificatory comment: for stylistic reasons, we will continue to\nshift back-and-forth between speaking of explanations as\ntruths of a certain kind that can be discovered and argued\nover, versus speaking of them as activities by which those\ntruths are communicated or understood. That distinction, as well as\nwhether explanations are in fact something else (e.g.,\ntheories in a model-theoretic sense), will rise to the\nforefront later, but for now, we will speak loosely.\n",
