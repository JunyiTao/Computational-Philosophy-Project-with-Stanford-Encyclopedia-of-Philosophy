    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Acquaintance Accounts\n3.1 Acquaintance Accounts\n\nThe idea that we know our mental states through acquaintance\nwith them is usually associated with Russell (1917), but such accounts\ntrace their lineage at least to Descartes (see the entry on\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description).\n According to these accounts, our awareness of our mental states is\nsometimes peculiarly direct in both an epistemic sense and a\nmetaphysical sense. It is epistemically direct in that I need not rely\non awareness of something else in order to be aware of my mental\nstate. It is metaphysically direct in that no event or process\nmediates between my awareness and the mental state itself. By\ncontrast, my awareness of last night\u2019s rain is epistemically\nindirect in that I achieve it only through being aware of something\nelse (such as the wet pavement). This awareness is metaphysically\nindirect in that various factors, including the wet pavement and\nperhaps my visual experience thereof, mediate between my awareness of\nthe rain and the rain itself.\n\nAcquaintance accounts hold special appeal for epistemic\nfoundationalists, who claim that all of our knowledge rests on a\nfoundation of beliefs that are justified, but not justified by other\nbeliefs.\n\nThe claim that introspective access is both epistemically and\nmetaphysically direct is most plausible for sensations like pain. This\nis because how a sensation appears\u2014how it seems to the\nsubject\u2014and how it actually is (its nature) are,\naccording to many philosophers, one and the same. That is,\n\u201cthere is no appearance/reality distinction in the case of\nsensations\u201d (Hill 1991: 127; compare Kripke 1980:\n152\u20133).\n\nLimiting acquaintance accounts to self-knowledge of\nsensations\u2014or, more strictly, to self-knowledge of mental states\nindividuated by phenomenology\u2014does not entirely fix their scope,\nas philosophers disagree as to which kinds of mental states are\nindividuated by phenomenology. Recently, the idea that\nthoughts have a distinctive phenomenology has received\nrenewed attention (see the entry on\n consciousness and intentionality).\n Pitt (2004) uses the fact that we seem able to know what we\u2019re\nthinking in a direct, highly secure way\u2014one that is best\nexplained by an acquaintance model of introspection\u2014to argue\nthat thoughts have distinctive phenomenological properties with which\nwe are acquainted. Some philosophers also argue that conscious\nattitudes, such as judgments, have distinctive phenomenologies.\n\nThe purported epistemic and metaphysical directness of introspection\ndoes not imply that we are either infallible or omniscient about our\nown states, since it is an open question whether all of our states are\nintrospectible. But if introspection involves epistemically and\nmetaphysically direct access to one\u2019s phenomenal states, then\nits proper use may allow the relevant self-attributions to achieve a\nhigh degree of certainty. And some philosophers have drawn on the\nconcept of acquaintance to argue that at least some mental states,\nsuch as intense sensations, may be \u201cluminous\u201d: that is, that being in\na state of that kind may ensure that one can know that one is\n(Weatherson 2004; Duncan 2018). These arguments are responses to\nWilliamson\u2019s (2000) \u201canti-luminosity\u201d argument, which seeks to\nestablish that no mental states are luminous.\n\nThe idea that we know (even some of) our sensations by acquaintance\nremains highly controversial. The idea that we know our beliefs or\nother attitudes by acquaintance is even more controversial. As James\n(1884) observed, self-knowledge requires more than even direct contact\nwith a mental state: it requires that one properly conceptualize the\nstate, classifying it as e.g. pain or coldness. The\ngreatest challenge for acquaintance accounts is to explain how this\nconceptualization occurs. In particular, they must show that awareness\nof a mental state that is direct and immediate can also be an\nepistemically substantial grasp of the state as a state of a\ncertain kind.\n\nOne approach to this challenge draws on the phenomenon of\ndemonstrative reference (Gertler 2001; Chalmers 2003). Demonstrative\nreference often involves literal pointing: by pointing to my desk, I\ncan demonstratively refer to it as \u201cthat (desk)\u201d. When it\ncomes to experiences, we don\u2019t pick them out by pointing but,\ninstead, by attending to them. As Sosa aptly observes,\n\u201cSelective attention is the index finger of the mind\u201d\n(2003: 279). By attending to how an experience feels (or appears), one\ncan use this appearance\u2014e.g., the itchiness of an itch\u2014to\nrefer to the feature demonstratively, as \u201cthis\nquality\u201d. One can then register the presence of the itch by\nthinking \u201cI\u2019m now experiencing this\nquality\u201d Since reference is secured by attending to the\nitchiness, one grasps the feature in question, as itchiness.\nChalmers refers to this grasp of phenomenal features as a\n\u201cdirect phenomenal concept\u201d.\n\n\nThe clearest cases of direct phenomenal concepts arise when a subject\nattends to the quality of an experience, and forms a concept wholly\nbased on the attention to the quality, \u201ctaking up\u201d the\nquality into the concept. (Chalmers 2003: 235)\n\n\nOne worry about acquaintance accounts stems from the observation that\nwe sometimes err about our experiences. However, most acquaintance\ntheorists will concede that we can be wrong about our own phenomenal\nstates. The theory implies only that, under certain conditions, an\nexperience\u2019s phenomenal reality\u2014the \u201cquality\u201d in\nChalmers\u2019 terms\u2014constitutes how it appears to the\nthinker\u2014the \u201cconcept\u201d of that quality (see also Horgan and\nKriegel 2007; Gertler 2012). When those conditions are met, we are\naware of the experience in a way that could not occur in the absence\nof that experience, and so our self-ascription of the experience will\nbe true.\n\nSome critics charge that acquaintance accounts construe introspective\nbeliefs as too close to their objects to qualify as genuine knowledge\n(Wittgenstein 1953; Stalnaker 2008). In effect, this objection denies\nthat direct introspective attention to an instance of a phenomenal\nquality can provide an epistemically substantial grasp of that\nquality.\n",
