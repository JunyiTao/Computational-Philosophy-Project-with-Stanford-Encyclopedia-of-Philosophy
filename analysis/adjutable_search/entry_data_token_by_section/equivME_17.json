    "main_text": "Experimental Verification of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry, we have presented the physics of mass-energy\nequivalence as widely understood by both physicists and philosophers.\nWe have also canvassed a variety of philosophical interpretations of\nmass-energy equivalence. Along the way, we have presented the merits\nand demerits of each interpretation. We have also presented a brief\nhistory of derivations of mass-energy equivalence to emphasize that\nthe equivalence of mass and energy is a direct result to changes to\nthe structure of spacetime imposed by special relativity. Finally, we\nhave briefly and rather selectively discussed the empirical\nconfirmation of mass-energy equivalence.\n",
