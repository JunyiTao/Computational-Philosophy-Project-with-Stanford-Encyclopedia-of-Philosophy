    "main_text": "Linguistics || Decompositional Approaches\n4.3 Decompositional Approaches\n\nThe basic idea of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage approach\n(henceforth, NSM; Wierzbicka 1972, 1996; Goddard & Wierzbicka\n2002) is that word meaning is best described through the combination\nof a small set of elementary conceptual particles, known as\nsemantic primes. Semantic primes are primitive (i.e., not\ndecomposable into further conceptual parts), innate (i.e., not\nlearned), and universal (i.e., explicitly lexicalized in all natural\nlanguages, whether in the form of a word, a morpheme, a phraseme, and\nso forth). According to NSM, the meaning of any word in any natural\nlanguage can be defined by appropriately combining these fundamental\nconceptual particles. Wierzbicka (1996) proposed a catalogue of about\n60 semantic primes, designed to analyze word meanings within so-called\nreductive paraphrases. For example, the reductive paraphrase for\n\u2018top\u2019 is a part of\nsomething; this part is above all the other parts of this\nsomething. NSM has produced interesting applications in\ncomparative linguistics (Peeters 2006), language teaching (Goddard\n& Wierzbicka 2007), and lexical typology (Goddard 2012). However,\nthe approach has been criticized on various grounds. First, it has\nbeen argued that the method followed by NSM in the identification of\nsemantic primes is insufficiently clear (e.g., Matthewson 2003).\nSecond, some have observed that reductive paraphrases are too vague to\nbe considered adequate representations of word meanings, since they\nfail to account for fine-grained differences between semantically\nneighboring words. For example, the reductive paraphrase provided by\nWierzbicka for \u2018sad\u2019 (i.e., x feels\nsomething; sometimes a person\nthinks something like this: something bad happened; if i didn\u2019t\nknow that it happened i would say: i don\u2019t want it to happen; i\ndon\u2019t say this now because i know: i can\u2019t do anything;\nbecause of this, this person feels something bad; x\nfeels something like\nthis) seems to apply equally well to \u2018unhappy\u2019,\n\u2018distressed\u2019, \u2018frustrated\u2019,\n\u2018upset\u2019, and \u2018annoyed\u2019 (e.g., Aitchison 2012).\nThird, there is no consensus on what items should ultimately feature\nin the list of semantic primes available to reductive paraphrases: the\ncontent of the list is debated and varies considerably between\nversions of NSM. Fourth, some purported semantic primes appear to fail\nto comply with the universality requirement and are not explicitly\nlexicalized in all known languages (Bohnemeyer 2003; Von Fintel &\nMatthewson 2008). See Goddard (1998) for some replies and Riemer\n(2006) for further objections.\n\nFor NSM, word meanings can be exhaustively represented with a\nmetalanguage appealing exclusively to the combination of primitive\nlinguistic particles. Conceptual Semantics (Jackendoff 1983, 1990,\n2002) proposes a more open-ended approach. According to Conceptual\nSemantics, word meanings are essentially an interface phenomenon\nbetween a specialized body of linguistic knowledge (e.g.,\nmorphosyntactic knowledge) and core non-linguistic cognition. Word\nmeanings are thus modeled as hybrid semantic representations combining\nlinguistic features (e.g., syntactic tags) and conceptual elements\ngrounded in perceptual knowledge and motor schemas. For example, here\nis the semantic representation of \u2018drink\u2019 according to\nJackendoff.\n\n\\[\\left[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{drink} \\\\\n&\\mathrm{V} \\\\\n&\\underline{\\phantom{xxxi}}\\langle \\text{NP}_j \\rangle \\\\\n&[_{\\text{Event}} \\text{CAUSE} ([_{\\text{Thing}}\\quad]_i, \n     [_{\\text{Event}} \\text{GO} ([_{\\text{Thing}} \\text{LIQUID}]_j, \\\\\n&\\quad [_{\\text{Path}} \\text{TO} ([_{\\text{Place}} \\text{IN}\n           ([_{\\text{Thing}} \\text{MOUTH OF} ([_{\\text{Thing}}\\quad]_i)])])])])]\n\\end{align*}\n\\right]\\]\n\n\nSyntactic tags represent the grammatical properties of the word under\nanalysis, while the items in subscript are picked from a core set of\nperceptually grounded primitives (e.g., event,\nstate, thing, path, place, property,\namount) which are assumed to be innate, cross-modal and\nuniversal categories of the human mind. The decompositional machinery\nof Conceptual Semantics has a number of attractive features. Most\nnotably, its representations take into account grammatical class and\nword-level syntax, which are plausibly an integral aspect of our\nknowledge of the meaning of words. However, some of its claims about\nthe interplay between language and conceptual structure appear more\nproblematic. To begin with, it has been observed that speakers tend to\nuse causative predicates (e.g., \u2018drink\u2019) and the\nparaphrases expressing their decompositional structure (e.g.,\n\u201ccause a liquid to go into someone or something\u2019s\nmouth\u201d) in different and sometimes non-interchangeable ways\n(e.g., Wolff 2003), which raises concerns about the hypothesis that\ndecompositional analyses \u00e0 la Jackendoff may be regarded as faithful\nrepresentations of word meanings. In addition, Conceptual Semantics is\nsomewhat unclear as to what exact method should be followed in the\nidentification of the motor-perceptual primitives that can feed\ndescriptions of word meanings (Pulman 2005). Finally, the restriction\nplaced by Conceptual Semantics on the type of conceptual material that\ncan inform definitions of word meaning (low-level primitives grounded\nin perceptual knowledge and motor schemas) appears to affect the\nexplanatory power of the framework. For example, how can one account\nfor the difference in meaning between \u2018jog\u2019 and\n\u2018run\u2019 without ut taking into account higher-level,\narguably non-perceptual knowledge about the social characteristics of\njogging, which typically implies a certain leisure setting, the\nintention to contribute to physical wellbeing, and so on? See Taylor\n(1996), Deane (1996).\n\nThe neat dividing line drawn between word meanings and general world\nknowledge by Conceptual Semantics does not tell us much about the\ndynamic interaction of the two in language use. The Two-Level\nSemantics of Bierwisch (1983a,b) and Lang (Bierwisch & Lang 1989;\nLang 1993) aims to provide such a dynamic account. Two-Level Semantics\nviews word meaning as the result of the interaction between two\nsystems: semantic form (SF) and conceptual structure\n(CS). SF is a formalized representation of the basic features of a\nword. It contains grammatical information that specifies, e.g., the\nadmissible syntactic distribution of the word, plus a set of variables\nand semantic parameters whose value is determined by the interaction\nwith CS. By contrast, CS consists of language-independent systems of\nknowledge (including general world knowledge) that mediate between\nlanguage and the world (Lang & Maienborn 2011). According to\nTwo-Level Semantics, for example, polysemous words can express\nvariable meanings by virtue of having a stable underspecified SF which\ncan be flexibly manipulated by CS. By way of example, consider the\nword \u2018university\u2019, which can be read as referring either\nto an institution (as in \u201cthe university selected John\u2019s\napplication\u201d) or to a building (as in \u201cthe university is\nlocated on the North side of the river\u201d). Simplifying a bit,\nTwo-Level Semantics explains the dynamics governing the selection of\nthese readings as follows.\n\nBecause \u2018university\u2019 belongs to the category of words\ndenoting objects primarily characterized by their purpose, the general\nlexical entry for \u2018university\u2019 is \\(\\lambda x\n[\\textrm{purpose} [x w]]\\).\n Based on our knowledge that the primary\npurpose of universities is to provide advanced education, the SF of\n\u2018university\u2019 is specified as \\(\\lambda x [\\textrm{purpose}\n[x w] \\mathbin{\\&} \\textit{advanced study and teaching}\n[w]]\\).\n The alternative readings of\n\u2018university\u2019 are a function of the two ways CS can set the\nvalue of the variable x in its SF, such ways being \\(\\lambda x\n[\\textrm{institution} [x] \\mathbin{\\&} \\textrm{purpose} [x w]]\\)\nand \\(\\lambda x [\\textrm{building} [x] \\mathbin{\\&}\n\\textrm{purpose} [x w]]\\).\n\n\nTwo-Level Semantics shares Jackendoff\u2019s and Wierzbicka\u2019s\ncommitment to a descriptive paradigm that anchors word meaning to a\nstable decompositional template, all the while avoiding the immediate\ncomplications arising from a restrictive characterization of the type\nof conceptual factors that can modulate such stable decompositional\ntemplates in contexts. But there are, once again, a few significant\nissues. A first problem is definitional accuracy: defining the SF of\n\u2018university\u2019 as \\(\\lambda x [\\textrm{purpose} [x w]\n\\mathbin{\\&} \\textit{advanced study and teaching} [w]]\\) seems too\nloose to reflect the subtle differences in meaning among\n\u2018university\u2019 and related terms designating institutions\nfor higher education, such as \u2018college\u2019 or\n\u2018academy\u2019. Furthermore, the apparatus of Two-Level\nSemantics relies heavily on lambda expressions, which, as some\ncommentators have noted (e.g., Taylor 1994, 1995), appears ill-suited\nto represent the complex forms of world knowledge we often rely on to\nfix the meaning of highly polysemous words. See also Wunderlich (1991,\n1993).\n\nThe Generative Lexicon theory (GL; Pustejovsky 1995) takes a different\napproach. Instead of explaining the contextual flexibility of word\nmeaning by appealing to rich conceptual operations applied on\nsemantically thin lexical entries, this approach postulates lexical\nentries rich in conceptual information and knowledge of worldly facts.\nAccording to classical GL, the informational resources encoded in the\nlexical entry for a typical word w consist of the following\nfour levels.\n\nA lexical typing structure, specifying the semantic type\nof w within the type system of the language;\nAn argument structure, representing the number and nature\nof the arguments supported by w;\nAn event structure, defining the event type denoted by\nw (e.g., state, process, transition);\n A qualia structure, specifying the predicative force of\nw.\n\n\nIn particular, qualia structure specifies the conceptual relations\nthat speakers associate to the real-world referents of a word and\nimpact on the way the word is used in the language (Pustejovsky 1998).\nFor example, our knowledge that bread is something that is brought\nabout through baking is considered a Quale of the word\n\u2018bread\u2019, and this knowledge is responsible for our\nunderstanding that, e.g., \u201cfresh bread\u201d means \u201cbread\nwhich has been baked recently\u201d. GL distinguishes four types of\nqualia:\n\nconstitutive: the relation between an\nobject x and its constituent parts;\nformal: the basic ontological category of\nx;\ntelic: the purpose and the function of\nx;\nagentive: the factors involved in the\norigin of x.\n\n\nTake together, these qualia form the \u201cqualia structure\u201d of\na word. For example, the qualia structure of the noun\n\u2018sandwich\u2019 will feature information about the composition\nof sandwiches, their nature of physical artifacts, their being\nintended to be eaten, and our knowledge about the operations typically\ninvolved in the preparation of sandwiches. The notation is as\nfollows.\n\nsandwich(x)\n\nconst = {bread, \u2026}\n\nform = physobj(x)\n\ntel = eat(P, g, x)\n\nagent = artifact(x)\n\nQualia structure is the primary explanatory device by which GL\naccounts for polysemy. The sentence \u201cMary finished the\nsandwich\u201d receives the default interpretation \u201cMary\nfinished eating the sandwich\u201d because the argument\nstructure of \u2018finish\u2019 requires an action as direct object,\nand the qualia structure of \u2018sandwich\u2019 allows the\ngeneration of the appropriate sense via type coercion (Pustejovsky\n2006). GL is an ongoing research program (Pustejovsky et al. 2012)\nthat has led to significant applications in computational linguistics\n(e.g., Pustejovsky & Jezek 2008; Pustejovsky & Rumshisky\n2008). But like the theories mentioned so far, it has been subject to\ncriticisms. A first general criticism is that the decompositional\nassumptions underlying GL are unwarranted and should be replaced by an\natomist view of word meaning (Fodor & Lepore 1998; see Pustejovsky\n1998 for a reply). A second criticism is that GL\u2019s focus on\nvariations in word meaning which depend on sentential context and\nqualia structure is too narrow, since since contextual variations in\nword meaning often depend on more complex factors, such as the ability\nto keep track of coherence relations in a discourse (e.g., Asher &\nLascarides 1995; Lascarides & Copestake 1998; Kehler 2002; Asher\n2011). Finally, the empirical adequacy of the framework has been\ncalled into question. It has been argued that the formal apparatus of\nGL leads to incorrect predictions, that qualia structure sometimes\novergenerates or undergenerates interpretations, and that the rich\nlexical entries postulated by GL are psychologically implausible\n(e.g., Jayez 2001; Blutner 2002).\n",
