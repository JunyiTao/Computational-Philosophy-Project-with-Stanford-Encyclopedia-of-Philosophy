    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions about Genetics || Are Genes the Target of Natural Selection?\n2.4 Are Genes the Target of Natural Selection?\n\nOn Darwin\u2019s original formulation, natural selection acted on\nindividual organisms (entries:\n Darwinism;\n natural selection). As a population of organisms struggled to survive in\nsome particular environment, some of the organisms had traits that\nmade them slightly fitter in that environment, and this meant they\nwere more likely to survive and reproduce; the offspring of those\norganisms in turn inherited the traits of their parents, and so the\ncharacter of the population changed over time, eventually forming a\nnew or different species if the process went on long enough (entries:\n evolution;\n fitness). For example, in an environment that is growing\nincreasingly cold, animals with thicker fur might have an advantage\nover the animals with less fur because of their ability to tolerate\nthe temperature; these thicker-furred animals would be more likely to\nsurvive in that cold environment and also more likely to reproduce\noffspring that inherit their parents\u2019 thicker coats. Eventually,\nthe entire population of those animals may display this thicker fur\n(entry:\n adaptationism).\n\nEven Darwin recognized, however, that nature presented some cases that\ndid not fit this picture. In particular, seemingly altruistic\nbehaviors in the animal kingdom posed a puzzle (Wilson 2015). Take\nsocial mammals like ground squirrels that whistle alarm calls to\nnotify other members of the group of a nearby threat. On the original\nDarwinian formulation of natural selection, alarm calling should not\narise because it is not beneficial to the ground squirrels that\ndisplay the behavior. A ground squirrel that is more prone to\nnotifying its counterparts of a looming threat is presumably also more\nlikely to get killed by that threat, and so the proneness to warn\nshouldn\u2019t get propagated in the population if all the altruistic\nground squirrels are dying by very virtue of their altruistic behavior\n(entry:\n biological altruism).\n\nW. D. Hamilton proposed kin selection as a resolution to the altruism\npuzzle (Hamilton 1964). If the population of ground squirrels above\nwere related, then the genes associated with alarm calling could\npropagate in the group even if the altruistic ground squirrels were\nkilled more often because their kin who shared the genes survived. G.\nC. Williams and Richard Dawkins subsequently generalized\nHamilton\u2019s observation, arguing that all of natural selection\ncould be understood as operating at the genetic level (Williams 1966;\nDawkins 1976). On this \u201cgene\u2019s-eye view of\nevolution\u201d, natural selection targets genes (the\n\u201creplicators\u201d in Dawkins\u2019 language), while organisms\nare the \u201cvehicles\u201d (or \u201cinteractors\u201d) that\ncarry around the genes and interact with the environment (entry:\n replication and reproduction).\n\nThe gene\u2019s-eye formulation of natural selection sparked an\nexplosion of philosophical attention to evolutionary biology (which\nhappened to roughly coincide with the attention to the relationship\nbetween classic and molecular genetics discussed in\n section 2.1).\n This \u201clevels\u201d or \u201cunits of selection\u201d debate\nrevolved around a number of questions (Keller 1999; Okasha 2006;\nentry:\n units and levels of selection).\n For example, at what level does natural selection act? Genes,\nindividuals, groups, entire species (entry:\n biological notion of individual)?\n Group selectionists argued altruistic behavior could arise if one\ngroup was fitter than another group because it had more altruistic\nmembers in that group (Sober and Wilson 1998). Stephen Jay Gould made\nthe case for selection acting on entire species when, for example,\necological specialists were more common than generalists (Gould 2002).\nOther philosophers questioned the entire replicator/interactor\ndistinction; Developmental Systems Theorists advocated instead for\nseeing the developmental system as a whole (genes and the environment)\nas the evolving unit (Oyama, Griffiths, and Gray eds. 2001; see the\nentries on\n developmental biology;\n evolution and development;\n phylogenetic inference).\n",
