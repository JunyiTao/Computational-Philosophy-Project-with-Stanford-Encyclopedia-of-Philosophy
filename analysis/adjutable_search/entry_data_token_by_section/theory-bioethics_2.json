What is Bioethics? || The Pursuits of Bioethics\n1.2 The Pursuits of Bioethics\n\nTurning now to what counts as bioethics, the label does not indicate a\nunitary pursuit, what with bioethics\u2019 academic, policy-oriented,\nand clinical instantiations (McMillan 2018: 11\u201316; Battin 2013:\n2). When it comes to bioethics as an academic or scholarly pursuit,\nthe practical constraints of clinical decision making, and the\ntimelines imposed by commissions, are non-existent, freeing the\nbioethicist of the need to reach closure on a decision or to resolve a\ncomplex issue. As it has been put, for the academic bioethicist and\nher students, it does not matter if you end the seminar more confused\nthan when you started it. It is within this academic domain that the\nrelationship between bioethics and moral theory will be most explicit,\nthe role of moral theory most intently debated, and moral theory\nprobably most welcome.\n\nLooking at policy-oriented bioethics, here the bioethicist assists in\nthe development of policies affecting large numbers of people on\nissues of bioethical relevance (such as the rationing of kidney\ndialysis services, or the availability of medical assistance in\ndying). There are challenges upfront with the bioethicist\u2019s\ninvoking moral theory of any sort in tackling policy challenges as a\nmember of a national commission, say, or as a member of her regional\nhealth authority\u2019s ethics committee, or as a member of any other\nsort of policy-oriented working group. For starters, there is the fact\nthat she is likely to be in the vast minority as a group member with\nphilosophical training. But that aside, there is the further challenge\nof the unlikelihood of agreement amongst working group members on\nwhich moral theory should rule the day or govern the decision at\n stake.[4]\n There is the third category of clinical ethics, a pursuit taking\nplace as health care is practiced on the ground. As we will see in\nmore detail shortly, the relevance of moral theory to clinical ethics\nturns heavily on the operative conception of clinical ethics. In\nparticular, it relies upon our conception of the goals of the clinical\nethics consultation (the main activity of clinical bioethics), and\nupon our conception of the role of the clinical ethics consultant.\n\nWhat constitutes what we call applied ethics is just as fraught a\nquestion as the one of the relationship between theory and bioethics,\nand it implicates our take on that relationship. We now turn to that\nquestion.\n",
