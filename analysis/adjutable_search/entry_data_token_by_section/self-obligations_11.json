She gives examples\nwhat of this duty might entail: securing information about one\u2019s\nbank account and genome, not constantly broadcasting one\u2019s\nlocation and beliefs, not aiming \u201csexy pictures\u201d of\noneself \u201cat minors or the general public\u201d (2013, 850).\nAllen then draws implications for reform: we should not just judge\ncompanies and governments by how much they invade our\nprivacy, but also by how well they help us protect ourselves\nfrom invasive third parties (2013, 851).\n\nOn this basis, Allen advocates paternalistic privacy laws in certain\ncases, foreshadowing Schofield\u2019s case for liberal paternalism\n(2018, 2021, chaps. 5 & 6). If Allen and Schofield are right,\nobligations to oneself are not just relevant to how we treat\nourselves, but to how we should treat each other (see also Kanygina\n2020), and how we ought to live together in civil and political\nsociety.\n",
