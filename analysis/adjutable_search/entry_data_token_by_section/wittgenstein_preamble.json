    "main_text": "\n\nConsidered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century,\nLudwig Wittgenstein played a central, if controversial, role in\nmid-20th-century analytic philosophy. He continues to influence, and\nincur debate in, current philosophical thought in topics as diverse as\nlogic and language, perception and intention, ethics and religion,\naesthetics and culture, and even political thought. Furthermore, a\ncentral factor in investigating Wittgenstein\u2019s works is the\nmultifarious nature of the project of interpreting them; this leads to\nuntold difficulties in the ascertainment of his philosophical\nsubstance and method.\n\nOriginally, there were two commonly recognized stages of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought\u2014the early and the later\u2014both\nof which were taken to be pivotal in their respective periods. In this\northodox two-stage interpretation, it is commonly acknowledged that\nthe early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus. By showing the application of modern logic\nto metaphysics, via language, he provided new insights into the\nrelations between world, thought, and language and thereby into the\nnature of philosophy. It is the later Wittgenstein, mostly recognized\nin the Philosophical Investigations, who took the more\nrevolutionary step in critiquing all of traditional philosophy\nincluding its climax in his own early work. The nature of his new\nphilosophy is heralded as anti-systematic through and through, yet\nstill conducive to genuine philosophical understanding of traditional\nproblems. In more recent scholarship, this division has been\nquestioned: some interpreters have claimed a certain unity between all\nstages of his thought, while others talk of a more nuanced division,\nadding stages such as the middle Wittgenstein and the post-later\nWittgenstein.\n",
