    "main_text": "Subject Matter and Methodology\n1. Subject Matter and Methodology\n\nThere is a very narrow conception of the sorts of mental states and\nevents that could be the subject matter of phenomenological inquiry,\nnamely, \u201cfeeling\u201d mental states and events, including, as\nparadigm cases, types of physical and psychological pain. Because this\nis not how the subject matter is understood by those working on moral\nphenomenology, we put this narrow sense aside.\n\nAccording to a much broader conception of its subject matter,\nphenomenology as a field of inquiry is focused on the experiential\naspects of all types of experience that are accessible to first-person\ninquiry, including, for example, all forms of sensory experience,\nemotional experience, and so on. According to the tradition associated\nwith analytic philosophy of mind, the type of first-person inquiry in\nquestion is introspection (see the entry on\n introspection).\n Moral phenomenology, done in this tradition, then, focuses on the\nexperiential aspects of various types of moral experience\nthat are accessible to introspection. As a field of inquiry, its\ncentral aim is to accurately describe those aspects of moral\nexperience that may be investigated by the use of introspection. As\nsuch, it is largely an empirically grounded inquiry into the\nexperiential aspects of types of moral experience.\n\nAccording to the tradition derived from Husserl,\n Phenomenology[1]\n is focused on essential structures of the intentionality\u2014the\ndirectedness to an object\u2014proper to various kinds of experience.\nMoral phenomenology, understood in this sense, (1) focuses on what is\nessential to the first-personal, intentional directedness of moral\nexperiences, (2) aims to articulate the essences of types of moral\nexperience, and (3) employs a distinctive a priori\nmethodology.\n\nThese two conceptions of moral phenomenology as fields of inquiry\ndiffer somewhat in their aims and methodology, although they share a\ncommon subject matter. Let us begin with what they share in\ncommon.\n",
