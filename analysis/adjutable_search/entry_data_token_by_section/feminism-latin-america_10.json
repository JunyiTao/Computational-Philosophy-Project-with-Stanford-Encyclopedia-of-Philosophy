    "main_text": "Latin American Feminist Philosophy\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe history of Latin American and Caribbean feminist ideas is\nextensive. However, it is one that remains underappreciated in North\nAmerican and European academic spaces. The omission of Latin American\nfeminisms is further compounded by the fact that most of its primary\nresources remain untranslated from Spanish, making the travel of ideas\ndifficult. For some, the linguistic inaccessibility might not be\nproblematic as it signals the need for epistemic centers to\naccommodate across difference, and for others, it merely highlights\nthe ample amount of work that remains to be done. Either way, the\nLatin American feminist tradition is one that methodologically reminds\nits readers that theory is always grounded in practice. Thus, placing\nthe ideas of women and their push for social transformation at the\ncenterfold of philosophical and theoretical activity demands\ncontextualization. For philosophical practices more specifically,\nLatin American feminisms remind us that women have been thinking much\nlonger than they have been credited for and philosophers need to\nmerely start asking: What were they thinking about?\n",
