Emotions and Self-regarding Attitudes\n\nThe accounts of autonomy surveyed so far offer necessary and\nsufficient conditions of autonomy that are, broadly speaking,\nrationalistic. On Friedman\u2019s procedural and content-neutral\napproach, an agent\u2019s preference is autonomous if and only if\ncertain processes of critical reflection have been followed. On\nMeyers\u2019s competency account, an agent is autonomous when the\nauthentic self emerges as a result of the exercise of the cognitive\nskills of self-discovery, self-definition, and self-direction. On\nBenson\u2019s normative competence account, an agent must have the\nintellectual capacity to discern applicable norms in order to count as\nautonomous. Although these accounts are nuanced and recognize the role\nof emotion in critical reflection, none explicitly treat emotions as\nnecessary conditions of autonomy.\n\nThis section sketches a family of approaches that argue that the\nreasoning processes and the intellectual competencies described above\nare not sufficient for autonomy (even assuming that they are\nnecessary) (Govier 1993; Benson 1994). These approaches propose that\ncertain emotional states and attitudes to oneself are further\nnecessary conditions; autonomy is undermined when these emotional\nstates are damaged. There is a close connection between the\nundermining of such states and oppression. The indirect effects of\noppression include the harms of shame and loss of self-esteem (Cudd\n2006, 176\u20138; compare Benson 1994, 657\u20139), which in turn\ncan lead to self-doubt, and the loss of self-confidence and\nself-trust.\n\nBoth Trudy Govier (1993) and Carolyn McLeod (2002) argue that\nself-trust is a necessary condition of autonomy. Govier claims that\n\u201c[p]rocedural autonomy has as its necessary condition a reliance\non one\u2019s own critical reflection and judgment, and that reliance\nis possible only if one has, and can maintain against criticism, a\nsense of one\u2019s own basic competence and worth\u201d (1993,\n103\u20134). Govier proposes that other self-regarding attitudes,\nsuch as self-respect and self-esteem, are integral components of\nself-trust. She looks at the experiences of rape and incest victims to\nillustrate the ways in which self-trust can be eroded. Women who are\nthe victims of rape or incest \u201ctended to blame themselves,\nde-value themselves, and to have a diminished sense of their own\ncompetence and judgment after the sexual assaults\u2026\u201d\n(Govier 1993, 101). Govier concludes that lack of self-trust and a\ndiminished sense of one\u2019s own competence undermine the\nreflection required for autonomy.\n\nCarolyn McLeod focuses on medical contexts to elaborate how self-trust\nis necessary for autonomy. Consider Anna, who suffered a miscarriage\nat six weeks gestation and afterwards felt considerable emotional\nturmoil (McLeod 2002, 53). McLeod analyzes Anna\u2019s sense of\nincompetence to articulate her emotions as in part a result of\nothers\u2019 lack of sympathy for her grief and corresponding failure\nto reinforce her feelings: \u201c[O]ften women and their partners are\npressured not to grieve after miscarriage because people tend not to\nview the fetus\u2019s death as an event that warrants grief\u201d\n(McLeod 2002, 53). Comments such as \u201cit was a blessing in\ndisguise\u201d or \u201cit could have been worse; you could have\nlost a baby\u201d fail to \u201cgive uptake to [women\u2019s]\nfeelings\u201d (McLeod 2002, 55). The attitudes of others affect\nagents\u2019 sense of competence, self-worth, and self-trust. When\nthese self-regarding attitudes are diminished, so is an agent\u2019s\nautonomy.\n\nFor McLeod, self-trust is an \u201cattitude of optimism about our own\ncompetence and moral integrity\u201d (McLeod 2002, 6). McLeod\u2019s\naccount differs from Govier\u2019s in that her conception of\nself-trust is explicitly moral: in \u201cacting\nautonomously, we strive to meet moral responsibilities to the\nself\u201d (McLeod 2002, 122). Being autonomous requires treating\noneself well in a moral sense (McLeod 2002, pp. 121\u2013126). Thus\nalthough Govier\u2019s notion of self-trust seems to be compatible\nwith value-neutral procedural accounts of autonomy, McLeod\u2019s is\nnot. Rather, McLeod\u2019s account is \u201c\u2018weakly\nsubstantive\u201d because she claims that certain moral attitudes to\noneself\u2014for example, attitudes affirming one\u2019s own moral\nworth\u2014are necessary to acting autonomously. Moreover, on\nMcLeod\u2019s account, the self-trust necessary for autonomy is\n(epistemically) \u201cjustified self-trust\u201d: for instance,\nself-trust or self-distrust is not justified if agents overestimate or\nunderestimate their competence in certain contexts (McLeod 2002, 104).\nHence, for McLeod, there are epistemic as well as moral constraints on\nautonomy.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s examples illustrate the ways in which interpersonal\nconditions affect agents\u2019 abilities for self-trust and hence\ntheir autonomy. Benson (1994) develops a similar line of thought. He\ndescribes a case of a woman with a certain personality type (Benson\n1994, 555\u20137): she is excitable, imaginative, and passionate, and\nis \u201cprone to emotional outbursts in public\u201d (Benson 1994,\n556). The woman\u2019s husband, whom the woman trusts, is a\nphysician, and his response is to \u201cmedicalize\u201d his\nwife\u2019s personality type as psychologically unstable and\n\u201chysterical\u201d. The husband treats his wife as if she were\ncrazy. As Benson describes it, the woman\u2019s response is\nhelplessness and disorientation leading to lost self-worth. The\nhusband\u2019s and the establishment\u2019s attitude to the woman\nradically affect her self-conception; it becomes destabilized and her\nself-confidence is eroded. Moreover, the woman does not resist the\nprocess through which she loses her self-worth because \u201cshe\narrives at her sense of incompetence and estrangement\u2026on the\nbasis of reasons that are valued by a scientific establishment which\nis socially validated and which she trusts\u201d (Benson 1994, 657).\nBenson argues that although the woman\u2019s critical reasoning\nfaculties are intact, she nevertheless lacks autonomy because of a\ndiminished sense of self-worth.\n\nGovier, McLeod, and Benson introduce new tools for thinking about the\nhard cases described in \u00a72. Agents in oppressive circumstances\nmay have excellent skills of critical reflection, yet in these\ncircumstances they are subject to others\u2019 attitudes according to\nwhich they are suited only for subservient roles, that they are of\ninferior worth, that they are not capable of being full participants\nin society or in a decision-making process, and so forth. These\nattitudes have the effect of eroding their self-trust,\nself-confidence, and sense of self-worth. For example, although the\nreasoning skills of the Deferential Wife may be intact\u2014she may\nhave reflected on her wish to always cater to her husband, and\nendorsed it\u2014she may nevertheless have a diminished sense of\nself-worth as a result of the subtle effects of gender oppression. If\nshe does not treat herself as worthy of being the \u201cauthor of her\nown conduct\u201d, she will lack autonomy (Benson 1994, 659).\n\nGovier\u2019s position is causally relational: interpersonal\nconditions affect the emotions, which in turn affect the capacities\nfor critical reflection required for autonomy. However, McLeod\u2019s\nand Benson\u2019s positions are constitutively relational because the\nself-regarding attitudes necessary for autonomy are themselves\nunderstood as constitutively relational. We saw that McLeod adopts a\nmoral notion of justified self-trust as necessary for\nautonomy, which makes hers a weak substantive position. Her position\nis also constitutively relational because agents can be wrong to trust\nthemselves, for example, when they overestimate their own competence.\nHence features of the world\u2014facts about the agent\u2019s\ncompetence\u2014are necessary for justified self-trust that in turn\nis necessary for autonomy. Benson claims that although what is\nrequired for a sense of self-worth will be different in different\nagents, nevertheless there is a common feature: \u201cthe sense of\nworthiness to act that is necessary for free agency involves regarding\noneself as being competent to answer for one\u2019s conduct in the\nlight of normative demands that, from one\u2019s point of view,\nothers might appropriately apply to one\u2019s actions\u201d (Benson\n1994, 660). The definition of self-worth required for autonomy on\nBenson\u2019s analysis employs interpersonal relations and hence his\naccount is constitutively relational.\n",
