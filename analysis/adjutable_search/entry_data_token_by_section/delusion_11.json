    "main_text": "Delusions and the Continuity Thesis || Are delusions beliefs?\n4.2 Are delusions beliefs?\n\nAccording to the doxastic conception of delusions (dominant among\npsychologists and psychiatrists), delusions are belief states \u2013 it\nis an important diagnostic features of delusions that they can lead to\naction and that they can be reported with conviction, and thus that\nthey behave as typical beliefs. (See the entry on\n belief.)\n But there is an increasingly influential view in philosophy warning\nthat the doxastic characterization of delusions would lead to an\noversimplification of the phenomenon. Although some of the alternative\naccounts of delusions (e.g., experiential, phenomenological, and\nmetarepresentational) are critical towards standard doxastic\nconceptions, they do not necessarily deny that the phenomenon of\ndelusions involves the formation of beliefs. Rather, the central idea\nseems to be that, even if we report false or irrational beliefs when\nwe experience delusions, paying attention only to our first-order\ncognitive states and to the doxastic dimension of our mental life can\nlead to a partial and incorrect view of the phenomenon of delusions\n(see also Radden 2010).\n\nSome authors emphasize the experiential and\nphenomenological character of delusions over the doxastic one\n(e.g., Sass 1994; Gold and Hohwy 2000; Feyaerts et al. 2021), and\nothers conceive of delusions not as mere representations of our\nexperienced reality, but as attitudes towards representations (e.g.,\nCurrie 2000; Currie and Jureidini 2001; Stephens and Graham 2006).\nGallagher 2009 argues that an explanation of the delusion as a mere\ncognitive error would be inadequate, and introduces the terminology of\ndelusional realities, modes of experience which involve\nshifts in familiarity and sense of reality and encompass cognition,\nbodily changes, affect, social and environmental factors.\n\nMost of the authors who deny belief status to delusions have a\nnegative and a positive thesis. The positive thesis is an alternative\naccount of what delusions are. For instance, one might argue that\ndelusions are acts of imagination mistakenly taken by a person to have\nbelief status (Currie and Ravenscroft 2002) or empty speech acts with\nno intentional import (Berrios 1991). The negative thesis is an\naccount of why delusions are not beliefs. Beliefs have certain\ncharacteristics, that is, they are formed and revised on the basis of\nevidence, they are consistent with other beliefs, they are action\nguiding in the relevant circumstances. If delusions do not share these\ncharacteristics, then they are not beliefs.\n\nLet us list some of the arguments for the negative thesis:\n\nBeliefs are integrated with other beliefs. If delusions are not\nintegrated with our beliefs, then they are not\nbeliefs.\nBeliefs are responsive to evidence. If delusions are not\nresponsive to evidence, then they are not beliefs.\nBeliefs guide action. If delusions do not guide action, then they\nare not beliefs.\n\n\nThese arguments are central to the debate about the doxastic nature of\ndelusions (Bortolotti 2009). For instance, Currie and Jureidini 2001\n(p. 161) argue that delusions are more plausibly imaginings than\nbeliefs, because delusions \u2018fail, sometimes spectacularly, to be\nintegrated with what the subject really does believe\u2019, whereas\nthere is no requirement that imaginings are consistent with beliefs. Berrios 1991 argues that delusions cannot be beliefs for us,\nbecause we do not regard them as the most probable explanations for our unusual experience. Berrios reaches the\nextraordinary conclusions that delusions are not even intentional\nstates, but utterances without meaning, \u201cempty speech\nacts\u201d.\n\nAssessing arguments in (1) to (3) requires assessing empirical and\nconceptual claims. Let\u2019s consider (1), the \u2018bad\nintegration\u2019 objection to the belief status of delusions. In\norder to see whether the conclusion is convincing, an empirical claim\nabout delusions needs to be examined first: Do delusions really fail\nto integrate with our beliefs? Then, a conceptual claim needs\nassessing, the claim that not being integrated with our beliefs\nprevents delusions from being beliefs themselves. In many cases, the\nalleged \u2018fault\u2019 of delusions is exaggerated (e.g.,\ndelusions sometimes integrate well with our beliefs), but it would be plausible to claim that delusions exhibit that feature (bad integration)\nto a higher degree than nondelusional beliefs.\n\nThe most common versions of anti-doxastic arguments seem to rely on an\nidealization of belief states, and impose constraints on\ndelusions that not even typical beliefs would meet. The assumption\nseems to be that beliefs are essentially rational, and that delusions\nare not beliefs because they are not rational. But the abundant\npsychological evidence on familiar irrationality tells us that\nnondelusional beliefs are often irrational in exactly the same way as\ndelusions can be, although to a lesser degree. It is sufficient to\nthink about hypocrisy, about prejudiced and superstitious beliefs, and\nabout the many biases that affect belief updating in normal cognition\nto realize that the same kinds of irrationality that we find in\ndelusions are also common in many nondelusional beliefs (e.g., Nisbett\nand Ross 1980; more recently Bentall 2018). A general worry is that\nthe very notion of belief is not theoretically useful if the criteria\nfor what counts as a belief become too loose.\n\nIndependent of any given answer to the question whether delusions are\nbeliefs, two conceptions of delusions divide the philosophical scene.\nOne highlights the discontinuity between delusions and beliefs, and\nbetween neurotypical and neurodivergent cognition, with various\nconsequences for what counts as pathological, but also for the\navailability of therapeutic options, such as cognitive behavioral\ntherapy, for conditions characterised by delusions. The other view\ninsists that there is continuity between delusions and beliefs, and\nattempts to gather data both suggesting that people with delusions\nreason in much the same way as people without, and that delusion-like\nideas are widespread in the nonclinical population. Some studies have\ngathered a vast amount of empirical data about the temporal variations\nin delusions in context of psychopathologies, and the\npresence of delusion-like beliefs in the nonclinical population (e.g.,\nBentall 2003).\n",
