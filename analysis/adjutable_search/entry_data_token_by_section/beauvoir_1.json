    "main_text": "Beauvoir the Philosopher\n2. Beauvoir the Philosopher\n\nBeauvoir was not considered a philosopher at the time of her death.\nSome have found Beauvoir\u2019s exclusion from the domain of\nphilosophy more than a matter of taking Beauvoir at her word. They\nattribute it to an exclusively systematic view of philosophy which,\napathetic to the philosophical methodology of the metaphysical novel,\nignored the ways that Beauvoir embedded existential-phenomenological\narguments in her literary works. Between those who did not challenge\nBeauvoir\u2019s self-portrait, those who did not accept her\nunderstanding of the relationship between literature and philosophy,\nand those who missed the unique signature of her philosophical essays,\nBeauvoir the philosopher remained a lady-in-waiting.\n\nSome have argued that the belated admission of Beauvoir into the ranks\nof philosophers is a matter of sexism on two counts. The first\nconcerns the fact that Beauvoir was a woman. Her philosophical\nwritings were read as echoes of Sartre rather than explored as\noriginal contributions because it was only \u201cnatural\u201d to\nthink of a woman as a disciple of her male companion. The second\nconcerns the fact that she wrote about women. The Second Sex,\nrecognized as one of the hundred most important works of the twentieth\ncentury, would not be counted as philosophy because it dealt with the\noppression of women, hardly a burning philosophical issue (so it was\nsaid). But, decades of scholarship on Beauvoir by feminist scholars\nhas proven that she deserves recognition as a philosopher in her own\nright.\n\nSuch recognition was not without its challenges, especially the one\nposed by Beauvoir. Her philosophical voice, she insisted, was merely\nan elaboration of Sartre\u2019s. Those denials coupled with the fact\nof her life-long relationship with him positioned her in the public\nand philosophical eye as Sartre\u2019s alter ego. Decoupling Beauvoir\nfrom Sartre became the first priority of those interested in\nestablishing her independent philosophical credentials. Sometimes the\nissue concerned Sartre\u2019s originality: Were the ideas of his\nBeing and Nothingness (1943) stolen from Beauvoir\u2019s\nShe Came to Stay (1943)? Sometimes they concerned matters of\ninfluence: What happened in their discussions and critiques of each\nother\u2019s work? Eventually these arguments abated and scholars\nturned from exclusive attention to the matter of Sartre\u2019s\ninfluence to the more fruitful question of influence in the broader\nsense. They began to trace the ways that she, like her\nexistential-phenomenological contemporaries, took up and reconfigured\ntheir philosophical heritage, identifying her philosophical\noriginality and unique contributions to existentialism and\nphenomenology. Studying her diaries and memoirs expose her\nphilosophical influences even more explicitly: Descartes and Kant were\nfamiliar figures in her philosophical vocabulary; her reading of Hegel\nwas influenced by the interpretations of Koj\u00e8ve; she was\nintroduced to Husserl and Heidegger by her teacher Baruzi; she drew on\nBergson before she had studied Hegel or Marx; if she had rewritten\nVolume I of The Second Sex, she would develop a more Marxist,\nless Hegelian account of the Other; and after meeting Jean Walh at a\ndinner party in 1939, Beauvoir became immersed in a study of\nKierkegaard which moved her away from Hegelianism and toward an\nexistentialist ethics of freedom.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s tenuous recognition as a philosopher also has much to\ndo with her critique of and challenge to its methods. She detailed her\nphenomenological and existential critique of the philosophical status\nquo in her 1946 essay \u201cLiterature and the Metaphysical\nEssay\u201d, and her 1965 and 1966 essays \u201cQue Peut la\nLitt\u00e9rature?\u201d and \u201cMon Exp\u00e9rience\nd\u2019\u00e9crivain\u201d. This critique, influenced by both\nHusserl and Heidegger, focused on the significance of lived experience\nand on the ways that literature unveils situated truths in the world.\nBeauvoir, Albert Camus and Sartre turned to the language of the novel\nand the theater. They looked to Husserl to theorize their turn to\nthese discourses by insisting on grounding their theoretical analyses\nin the concrete particulars of lived experience. They looked to\nHeidegger to challenge the privileged position of abstract discourses.\nFor Beauvoir, however, the turn to literature carried ethical and\npolitical as well as philosophical implications. Literature is a way\nto overcome existential separation between self and other, to engage\nand be undone by other truths. It allowed her to explore the limits of\nthe appeal (the activity of calling on others to take up one\u2019s\npolitical projects); to portray the temptations of violence; to enact\nher existential ethics of freedom, responsibility, joy and generosity;\nand to examine the intimacies and complexities of relationships with\nothers. She found in literature a way to reveal the contingency of the\nworld, along with its multiple, interwoven meanings, in ways that\ntraditional philosophical forms could not. Further, many of her works\nare shaped by rigorous interdisciplinary research, which allowed\nBeauvoir to think in the concrete, rather than in the abstract mode of\ntraditional philosophy.\n\nIn writing The Second Sex, Beauvoir undertook a challenge to\nthe patriarchal status quo. This challenge was a dramatic event that\ninspired controversy and social upheaval. At its publication, the book\nwas regarded more as an affront to sexual decency than a political\nindictment of patriarchy or a phenomenological investigation of\n\u201cwoman\u201d. It was the women who came to be known as\nsecond-wave feminists who understood what Beauvoir\u2019s first\nreaders missed. It was not sexual decency that was being attacked but\npatriarchal indecency that was on trial. The Second Sex\nexpressed their sense of injustice, focused their demands for social,\npolitical, and personal change and alerted them to the connections\nbetween private practices and public policies. No longer considered\nsexually scandalous, its analysis of patriarchy and women\u2019s\noppression, and its proposed antidotes to women\u2019s domination are\nstill debated.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s work has suffered in translation further obscuring\nher status as a philosopher and her political ideas in particular. The\nfirst English translation of The Second Sex, done by H.M.\nParshley, a zoologist with no background in philosophy, is perhaps\nmost well known for its controversial translation, which omits around\nfifteen percent of the original text, inaccurately translating the\ncentral philosophical concepts, and depoliticizing Beauvoir\u2019s\nfeminism. In 1953, when America Day by Day was published for\nan American audience, it also suffered from serious omissions, many of\nwhich focused on her account of race relations in the U.S. The English\ntranslations of several of Beauvoir\u2019s novels are also subtly\nemptied of her political commentary.\n\nNonetheless, Beauvoir\u2019s oeuvre challenged the borders separating\nphilosophy and literature and disrupted the boundaries between the\npersonal, the political, and the philosophical. Since her death, her\nstatus as an original philosopher has been secured, in large part due\nto feminist scholars who resisted the patriarchal constraints of the\ndiscipline of philosophy and reconsidered Beauvoir\u2019s own framing\nof her life and work. She would have appreciated the fact that her\ncurrent philosophical status reflects our changed understanding of the\ndomain of philosophy and the changed situation of women, for it\nconfirms her idea of situated freedom\u2014that our capacity for\nagency and whether or not we are identified as agents, is constrained,\nthough never determined, by our situation. She would also have\nappreciated the fact that while her works were instrumental in\neffecting these changes, their lasting effect is a tribute to the ways\nthat others have taken up her philosophical and feminist legacies; for\none of her crucial contributions to our ethical and political\nvocabularies is the concept of the appeal\u2014that the success of\nour projects depends on the extent to which they are adopted by\nothers.\n",
