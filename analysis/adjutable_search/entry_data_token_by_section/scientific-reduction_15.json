    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of mind || Functional reduction\n3.4 Functional reduction\n\nFunctionalism about properties of a given sort is the view that such\nproperties are functional in nature. For example: Functionalism about\nthe mental is the view that mental properties are\nfunctional. Intuitively, a functional property is a property whose\nnature, essence or significance is fully captured by a description of\nthe role it plays within a system. Versions of functionalism can be\ndistinguished with respect to the sort of role they attribute to\nfunctional properties and the sorts of resources required to specify\nthose roles. The relevant roles might be specified solely in terms of\ncausal input-output relations. Alternatively, they can be conceived of\nin terms of relationally defined computational states (computational\nfunctionalism), or in terms of goal-directed interactions\n(teleological functionalism) (cf. Block forthcoming; Lycan 1987; Van\nGulick 1980; Sober 1990).\n\n\u2018Functional reduction\u2019 signifies a family of models which\nare concerned with the reduction of such causal, computational, or\ngoal-related properties. These models describe reduction as consisting\nof a relation between a functional property P and a\nstructural or substrate property P* that plays the role\ndetermined by the functional property P, or at least does in\na restricted class of systems or contexts. This general description\nleaves the question of the exact relation between P and\nP* open, nor does it say anything about the specific\nepistemic status of functional reduction. On this issue different\nmodels of functional reduction disagree.\n\nSome functionalists assume that the functional property P and\nthe property that plays the P-role, P*, are\nidentical. On this view (also called \u2018filler-\u2019,\n\u2018realizer\u2019 or\n\u2018occupant-functionalism\u2019) a specification of the\nrelevant role\u2014typically obtained by a logical construction (the\nso called \u201cRamsey sentence\u201d) from the theory containing a\npredicate that signifies this property\u2014merely serves as a\ndescription to pick out the property that plays the functional role in\nthe actual world. That is, \u2018P\u2019 refers to the\nunderlying property that actually plays the role, namely P*.\nOthers (so called \u2018role-functionalists\u2019) assume that the\nfunctional property P is a \u201chigher order\u201d\nproperty; it is simply the property of playing the relevant role and\nis not to be identified with any given underlying property P*\nthat does so. On this view, P* merely realizes P; it\nis not identical with P. Given its denial of property identity,\nthis latter view seems less apt to a reductionist interpretation.\nHowever, there may be means by which the higher-order properties might\nbe logically constructed from lower-order ones that count as reductive\n(Putnam 1970).\n\nMoreover, there is disagreement about how we arrive at a functional\ndefinition of a property. Some tend to assume that this is a more or\nless a priori affair. Others tend to think that it is an empirical\nmatter.\n\nThus functional reduction is primarily concerned with the connection\nbetween reduction and the metaphysics of specific properties, namely,\nfunctional ones. That is: prima facie, it is compatible (if\ncompatible at all, cf. Block forthcoming) with various\ndefinitions of reduction. It can be incorporated within a Nagelian\nframework (Esfeld and Sachse 2007), and it matches New-Wave\nreductionist ideas. Occupant-functionalism can be regarded as being\ncompatible even with classical type-identity theory. Thus, models of\nfunctional reduction do not give sui-generis models of reduction;\nrather, they can be regarded as yielding detailed theories about how\nfunctional properties behave with respect to reduction. In short, the\nquestion addressed under the heading of \u2018functional\nreduction\u2019 is this: How do functional properties fit into a\nreductionist perspective?\n\nIf the following three are true: mental properties are functional in\nnature, occupant-functionalism is correct, and the role of mental\nproperties is played by physiological properties, then mental\nproperties reduce in a straightforward sense to physiological\nproperties. Alternatively, it has been suggested that even if\nidentification of the functional property with its realizer is not\nalways possible, a reduction of such properties can still be achieved,\neither by way of local reductions (Kim 1993), by way of the reduction\nto disjunctive kinds (Clapp 2001; Walter 2006), or by way of the\nreduction of functional sub-types (Esfeld and Sachse 2007).\n\nOthers have argued that functionalism best suits non-reductive\nphysicalism in the following sense: It maintains the\nnaturalist\u2019s intuition that there is unity among the underlying\nproperty-realizers which are all ultimately physical; hence, token\nidentity theory is true. Nevertheless, it opens the possibility to\naccommodate the threat of multiple realizability in a particular way:\nFunctional kinds can be multiply realized, and, hence, they can be\nregarded as being distinct from the lower-level physical properties.\nMoreover, if a pragmatic dimension is incorporated in the conception\nof functionalism, functionalism seems to contradict reductionist\ninterpretations; it may be impossible as a matter of practice to\nspecify the relevant roles using only the resources of the lower-level\ntheories (cf. Van Gulick 2010).\n\nThus, differing models of functionalism and functional reduction might\nbe used to either justify or criticize various forms of\nreductionism.\n",
