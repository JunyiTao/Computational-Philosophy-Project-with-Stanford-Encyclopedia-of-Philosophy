    "main_text": "Contemporary Approaches and Debates || Radical Feminism\n2.2 Radical Feminism\n\nWhile feminist liberalism continues to flourish, the historical\ndevelopments and emerging debates described in the previous sections\nhave eclipsed or deeply transformed Jaggar\u2019s other three\ncategories of radical, Marxist, and socialist feminism (Jaggar 1983).\nThe \u201cgrand narratives\u201d that underlay the latter two have\nbecome less credible (Snyder 2008). Among theorists, radical feminism\nhas always been somewhat of a niche approach, likely because its\nstance is rather exacting. As the name \u201cradical\u201d suggests,\nradical feminists share the belief that existing structures and\ninstitutions need to be overhauled\u2014rather than\nreformed, as liberalism would have it\u2014in order to get\nat the \u201croot\u201d of women\u2019s oppression.\n\nThose who work in radical feminism continue to take issue with many of\nthe central tenets of liberal feminism, especially its focus on the\nindividual and the supposedly free choices that individuals can make.\nWhere the liberal sees the potential for freedom, the radical feminist\nsees structures of domination that are bigger than any individual. The\nidea that domination and oppression affect social groups in ways that\nare structural and systemic, though they may be\nexperienced differently by members of different social groups, is a\nmajor contribution of feminist political philosophy (Frye 1983; Young\n1990). Radical feminists remain committed to getting at the root of\nmale domination by understanding the source of power differentials,\nwhich some radical feminists, including Catharine MacKinnon, trace\nback to sexuality and the notion that heterosexual intercourse enacts\nmale domination over women.\n\n\nWomen and men are divided by gender, made into the sexes as we know\nthem, by the requirements of its dominant form, heterosexuality, which\ninstitutionalizes male sexual dominance and female sexual submission.\nIf this is true, sexuality is the linchpin of gender inequality.\n(MacKinnon 1989: 113)\n\n\nPatriarchy itself, according to this view, dominates women by\npositioning them as objects of men\u2019s desire (Welch 2015).\nRadical feminists of the 1980s tended to see power as running one-way,\nfrom those with power over those who are being oppressed. As Amy Allen\nputs it,\n\n\nUnlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social resource\nthat ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist phenomenologists,\nwho understand domination in terms of a tension between transcendence\nand immanence, radical feminists tend to understand power in terms of\ndyadic relations of dominance/subordination, often understood on\nanalogy with the relationship between master and slave. (2005:\n\u00a73.2)\n\n\nRadical feminists of the 1970s and 1980s sought to reject the\nprevailing order in various ways, sometimes advocating separatism\n(Daly 1973 [1985], 1978 [1990]), the technologization of procreation\n(and thus freeing women from their oppressive role in biological\nreproduction; Firestone 1970), or, as MacKinnon would have it,\nrejecting normative sexuality as rooted in male domination (MacKinnon\n1989). As Nancy Hirschmann notes, many radical feminists take biology\nas a \u201cfundamental starting point\u201d for theorizing\n(Hirschmann 2007: 146). This approach is generally recognized to be\nretrograde.\n\nA new generation of radical feminist theorists are renewing the\ntradition, showing how it has respected concerns such as\nintersectionality (Whisnant 2016) and shares some of the commitments\nof the postmodern feminists discussed below, e.g., skepticism about\nany fixed gender identity or gender binaries and a more fluid and\nperformative approach to sexuality and politics (Snyder 2008), as well\nas the ways that power and privilege continue to hold women back\n(Chambers 2017b: 656).\n",
