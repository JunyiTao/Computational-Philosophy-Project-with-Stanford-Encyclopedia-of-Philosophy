    "main_text": "Characteristics of personalist thought || Human beings, animals, and nature\n6.1 Human beings, animals, and nature\n\n\nPersonalists have generally insisted on the falsity of Darwin\u2019s claim\nthat man\u2019s difference from other terrestrial beings is one of degree\nand not of kind. Human exceptionalism has defined most personalist\nthought. Obviously, such exceptionalism is not exclusive to\npersonalism, but represents, rather, a standard assumption of\nclassical philosophical anthropology. In 1625, for instance, Grotius\nwrote: \u201cMan is, to be sure, an animal, but an animal of a\nsuperior kind, much farther removed from all other animals than the\ndifferent kinds of animals are from one another\u201d (De iure\nbelli ac pacis, Prolegomena, 11).\n\n\nAccording to a typical personalist conception, the fundamental\nclassification of all beings is the distinction between persons and\nnon-persons. For many personalists, what makes man\n\u201cunlike\u201d other animals is different from what makes a\nbaboon different from a giraffe, or even from what makes a baboon\ndifferent from a rock. Thus, in the words of Jacques Maritain:\n\u201cWhenever we say that man is a person, we mean that he is more\nthan a mere parcel of matter, more than an individual element in\nnature, such as is an atom, a blade of grass, a fly or an\nelephant\u2026Man is an animal and an individual, but unlike other\nanimals or individuals.\u201d Or as William Stern wrote, in his\nintroduction to Person und Sache (vol. 2): \u201cDespite any\nsimilarities by which persons are identified as members of humankind,\na particular race or gender, etc., despite any broad or narrow\nregularities which are involved in any personal events, a primal\nuniqueness always remains, through which every person is a world of\nits own with regard to other persons.\u201d\n\n\nHere personalists react not only to the main forms of idealism, the\nmaterialism, and the determinism of the nineteenth century, but even\nto the objectivism of Aristotle. Following his methodology for\ndefining a species in terms of its proximate genus and specific\ndifference, Aristotle had defined man as a rational animal (ho\nanthropos zoon noetikon) (Aristotle, Hist. Anim. I, 1:\n488a7; Nichomachean Ethics I, 5: 1097b11; VIII, 12: 1162a16;\nIX, 9: 1169b18; Politics, I, 2: 1253a3). Personalists, while\naccepting this definition, as far as it goes, see such a construction\nas an unacceptable reduction of the human person to the objective\nworld. This objective, cosmological view of man as an animal with the\ndistinguishing feature of reason \u2013 by which man is primarily an\nobject alongside other objects in the world to which he physically\nbelongs \u2013 would be only partly valid, and insufficient. In an\neffort to interpret the subjectivity that is proper to the person,\npersonalism expresses a belief in both the non-material dimension and\nthe primordial uniqueness of the human being, and thus in the basic\nirreducibility of the human being to the natural world.\n\n\nMany personalists see human beings as dealing with all other realities\nas objects (something related intentionally to a subject), but affirm\na substantive difference between the human person and all other\nobjects.  The person alone is \u201csomebody\u201d rather than\nmerely \u201csomething\u201d, and this sets him apart from every\nother entity in the visible world. No precise and general position\nspecific to personalists with regard to the nature of animals can be\ndiscerned.  But the sharp distinction between \u201csomebody\u201d\nand \u201csomething,\u201d in particular as applied to such other\nsentient beings, reflects both the influence on personalism of the\nJudaeo-Christian tradition and at least some of the general impact or\nspirit of distinctly modern, Cartesian rationalism, which latter is of\ncourse not unaffected by inherited Christian dualisms. Only the human\nbeing is typically conceived by personalism as simultaneously object\nand subject, while at the same time this is held to be true for all\npersons, irrespective of age, intelligence, qualities, etc. For\npersonalists, personal subjectivity assures that the human being\u2019s\nproper essence cannot be reduced to and exhaustively explained by the\nproximate genus and specific difference. Subjectivity becomes, then, a\nkind of synonym for the irreducible in the human being.\n\n\nBut the broader, realist personalism does posit, in the classical and\nscholastic tradition, the essential difference between man and all\nother objects on man\u2019s ability to reason (and its corollary of\nlanguage), which differentiates a person from the whole world of\nobjective entities. Since it is precisely his intellectual and\nspiritual nature that makes subjectivity possible, one can say that in\nthe subjectivity of the human person is also something objective. Yet\nthese personalists insist on the clear separation between non-personal\nbeings and this subjectivity of the person which is derivative of his\nrational nature in a broader or higher sense.  Regardless of how, more\nprecisely, animals are to be understood, the person differs from even\nthe most advanced among them by a specific kind of inner self, an\ninner life, which, ideally, revolves around his pursuit of truth and\ngoodness, and generates person-specific theoretical and moral\nquestions and concerns.\n\n\nOther strains of personalism, such as that represented by the\ndialogical philosophy of Martin Buber, pay less attention to the\ndifference between persons and non-persons and underscore instead the\nway one relates to all of reality. Buber separates the way of dealing\nwith other realities into two, which he terms \u201cI-Thou\u201d and\n\u201cI-It\u201d relationships, the first reflecting a fundamental\nopenness to the reality of the other and the latter reflecting an\nobjectivization and subordination of the other to oneself. According to\nBuber, we engage others either as an It, forming an\nI-It primary word, or as a Thou, forming the\nI-Thou primary word. Yet whereas some personalists would\nassert that such an I-Thou relationship is the only\nappropriate way of dealing with persons, and the I-It\nrelationship the only appropriate way of dealing with things,\nBuber presents the I-Thou relationship as the ideal for the\nhuman person\u2019s dealing with all reality, personal and\nnon-personal alike. And though this I-Thou relation will\ntake on different characteristics according to the sphere in which the\nrelation arises (nature, men, spiritual beings), for Buber the\nfundamental difference lies within the human person himself and in the\nattitude with which he engages reality.\n\n\nSome personalists have come to take a critical view of the starkly\nformulated human exceptionalism, and to go further than Buber in not\njust reconsidering the attitude of the human being, but also the rigid\ndualism involved in the view of everything that is not human (and\ndivine) persons as just soulless, impersonal \u201cobjects\u201d. The\nCzech philosopher Erazim Koh\u00e1k is an example of an in important\nrespects personalist thinker who has tried to rethink both our attitude\nto and our understanding of nature in this respect. The various effort\nto overcome the impersonal objectification of nature and other\nlife-forms, and to conceive of a more thoroughgoingly personal\nuniverse, partly resemble the positions of some of the early idealistic\npersonalists in the nineteenth century. Just like these personalists\nhad sometimes incorporated the accumulated and interrelated insights of\nself-consciousness, subjectivity, interiority,\nindividuality/singularity, will, imagination, and historicity in a way\nwhich the still in some respects often somewhat one-sidedly generalist\nThomistic currents of personalism had not, they also came closer to a\nview of nature that rectifies the overly rigid dualisms of a created\nworld at such distance from its creator as to be almost independent,\nand man as almost equally sharply separated from the rest of creation.\nThe human form of life is clearly exceptional in that it allows a\nmuch higher degree of development of personality in every respect, but\nto regard as a corollary of this insight the position that plants and\neven animals are mere impersonal objects, without consciousness and\ntheir own kind of subjectivity, seems to be regarded as increasingly\nproblematic among personalists.\n\n\nA not unimportant part of personalism\u2019s human\nexceptionalism reflects these cleavages of a world in which the\npresence of the divine is no longer sensed and perceived in nature. The\nmodern desacralized world, as articulated\nby Cartesianism but prepared by Ockham and even in some respects by\nAquinas, is also in reality in important respects an impersonalized\nworld. While guarding against the new impersonalism and moral ambiguity\nof the romantic pantheists, the early personalists of the nineteenth\ncentury at least perceived clearly the problems with the stark dualisms\nof much Christian theology as well as of modern rationalism, the\nEnlightenment, and scientism.\n",
