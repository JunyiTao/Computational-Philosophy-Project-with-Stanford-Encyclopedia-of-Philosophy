    "main_text": "The Limits of Cognitive Success || Responses to the Closure Argument\n6.2 Responses to the Closure Argument\n\nNext, we will examine various responses to the\n BKCA\n argument. According to the first, we can see that\n (C2)\n is false if we distinguish between relevant and irrelevant\nalternatives. An alternative to a proposition p is any\nproposition that is incompatible with p. Your having hands and\nyour being a BIV are alternatives: if the former is true, the latter\nis false, and vice versa. According to the thought that\nmotivates the second premise of the BIV argument, you know that you\nhave hands only if you can discriminate between your actually having\nhands and the alternative of being a (handless) BIV. But, by\nhypothesis, you can\u2019t discriminate between these. That\u2019s\nwhy you don\u2019t know that you have hands. In response to such\nreasoning, a relevant alternatives theorist would say that your\ninability to discriminate between these two is not an obstacle to your\nknowing that you have hands, and that\u2019s because your being a BIV\nis not a relevant alternative to your having hands.\nWhat would be a relevant alternative? This, for example: your arms\nending in stumps rather than hands, or your having hooks instead of\nhands, or your having prosthetic hands. But these alternatives\ndon\u2019t prevent you from knowing that you have hands\u2014not\nbecause they are irrelevant, but rather because you can discriminate\nbetween these alternatives and your having hands. The relevant\nalternative theorist holds, therefore, that you do know that you have\nhands: you know it because you can discriminate it from relevant\nalternatives, like your having stumps rather than hands.\n\nThus, according to Relevant Alternatives theorists, you know that you\nhave hands even though you don\u2019t know that you are not a BIV.\nThere are two chief problems for this approach. The first is that\ndenouncing the BIV alternative as irrelevant is ad hoc unless\nit is supplemented with a principled account of what makes one\nalternative relevant and another irrelevant. The second is that\npremise 2 is highly plausible. To deny it is to allow that the\nfollowing conjunction can be true:\n\n\nAbominable Conjunction\n\nI know that I have hands but I do not know that I am not a (handless)\nBIV.\n\n\nMany epistemologists would agree that this conjunction is indeed\nabominable because it blatantly violates the basic and extremely\nplausible intuition that you can\u2019t know you have hands without\nknowing that you are not a\n BIV.[62]\n\nNext, let us consider a response to BKCA according to which it\u2019s\nnot the second but the first premise that must be rejected. G. E.\nMoore has pointed out that an argument succeeds only to the extent\nthat its premises are more plausible than the conclusion. So if we\nencounter an argument whose conclusion we find much more implausible\nthan the denial of the premises, then we can turn the argument on its\nhead. According to this approach, we can respond to the BIV argument\nas follows:\n\n\nCounter BIV\n\n(~C3) I know that I have hands.\n(C2) If I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not a BIV, then I\ndon\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(~C1) I know that I am not a BIV.\n\n\n\nUnless we are skeptics or opponents of closure, we would have to\nconcede that this argument is sound. It is valid, and its premises are\ntrue. Yet few philosophers would agree that Counter BIV amounts to a\nsatisfying response to the BIV argument. It fails to explain\nhow one can know that one is not a BIV. The observation that\nthe premises of the BIV argument are less plausible than the denial of\nits conclusion doesn\u2019t help us understand how such knowledge is\npossible. That\u2019s why the Moorean response, unsupplemented with\nan account of how one can know that one is not a BIV, is widely\nthought to be an unsuccessful rebuttal of\n BKCA.[63]\n\nWe have looked at two responses to BKCA. The relevant alternatives\nresponse implausibly denies the second premise. The Moorean response\ndenies the first premise without explaining how we could possibly have\nthe knowledge that the first premise claims we don\u2019t have.\nAnother prominent response, contextualism, avoids both of these\nobjections. According to the contextualist, the precise contribution\nthat the verb \u201cto know\u201d makes to the truth-conditions of\nthe sentences in which it occurs varies from one context to another:\nin contexts in which the BIV hypothesis is under discussion, an agent\ncounts as \u201cknowing\u201d a fact only if she can satisfy some\nextremely high (typically unachievable) epistemic feat, and this is\nwhy (1) is true. But in contexts in which the BIV hypothesis is not\nunder discussion, an agent can count as \u201cknowing\u201d a fact\neven if her epistemic position vis-\u00e0-vis that fact is much more\nmodest, and this is why (3), taken in isolation, appears false.\n\nThe contextualist literature has grown vastly over the past two\ndecades: different contextualists have different accounts of how\nfeatures of context affect the meaning of some occurrence of the verb\n\u201cto know\u201d, and each proposal has encountered specific\nchallenges concerning the semantic mechanisms that it posits, and the\nextent to which it explains the whole range of facts about which\nepistemic claims are plausible under which\n conditions.[64]\n",
