    "main_text": "The Causal Mechanical Model || The Basic Idea\n4.1 The Basic Idea\n\nIn more recent work (especially, Salmon 1984) Salmon abandoned the\nattempt to characterize explanation or causal relationships in purely\nstatistical terms. Instead, he developed a new account which he called\nthe Causal Mechanical (CM) model of explanation\u2014an\naccount which is similar in both content and spirit to so-called\ncausal process theories of causation of the sort\ndefended by philosophers like Philip Dowe (2000). We may think of the\nCM model as an attempt to capture the \u201csomething\nmore\u201d involved in causal and explanatory relationships over and\nabove facts about statistical relevance, again while attempting to\nremain within a broadly Humean framework.\n\nThe CM model employs several central ideas. A causal\nprocess is a physical process, like the movement of a baseball\nthrough space, that is characterized by the ability to transmit a\nmark in a continuous way. (\u201cContinuous\u201d\ngenerally, although perhaps not always, means \u201cspatio-temporally\ncontinuous\u201d.) Intuitively, a mark is some local modification to\nthe structure of a process\u2014for example, a scuff on the surface\nof a baseball or a dent an automobile fender. A process is capable of\ntransmitting a mark if, once the mark is introduced at one\nspatio-temporal location, it will persist to other spatio-temporal\nlocations even in the absence of any further interaction. In this\nsense the baseball will transmit the scuff mark from one location to\nanother. Similarly, a moving automobile is a causal process because a\nmark in the form of a dent in a fender will be transmitted by this\nprocess from one spatio-temporal location to another. Causal processes\ncontrast with pseudo-processes which lack the ability to\ntransmit marks. An example is the shadow of a moving physical object.\nThe intuitive idea is that, if we try to mark the shadow by modifying\nits shape at one point (for example, by altering a light source or\nintroducing a second occluding object), this modification will not\npersist unless we continually intervene to maintain it as the shadow\noccupies successive spatio-temporal positions. In other words, the\nmodification will not be transmitted by the structure of the shadow\nitself, as it would in the case of a genuine causal process.\n\nWe should note for future reference that, as characterized by Salmon,\nthe ability to transmit a mark is clearly a counterfactual notion, in\nseveral senses. To begin with, a process may be a causal process even\nif it does not in fact transmit any mark, as long as it is true that\nif it were appropriately marked, it would transmit the mark.\nMoreover, the notion of marking itself involves a counterfactual\ncontrast\u2014a contrast between how a process behaves when marked\nand how it would behave if left unmarked. Although Salmon, like\nHempel, has always been suspicious of counterfactuals, his view at the\ntime that he first introduced the CM model was that the\ncounterfactuals involved in the characterization of mark transmission\nwere relatively unproblematic, in part because they seemed\nexperimentally testable in a fairly direct way. Nonetheless the\nreliance of the CM model, as originally formulated, on\ncounterfactuals shows that it does not completely satisfy the Humean\nstrictures described above. In subsequent work, described in\n Section 4.4\n below, Salmon attempted to construct a version of the CM\nmodel that completely avoids reliance on counterfactuals.\n\nThe other major element in Salmon\u2019s model is the notion of a\ncausal interaction. A causal interaction involves a\nspatio-temporal intersection between two causal processes which\nmodifies the structure of both\u2014each process comes to have\nfeatures it would not have had in the absence of the interaction. A\ncollision between two cars that dents both is a paradigmatic causal\ninteraction.\n\nAccording to the CM model, an explanation of some event\nE will trace the causal processes and interactions leading up\nto E (Salmon calls this the etiological aspect of the\nexplanation), or at least some portion of these, as well as describing\nthe processes and interactions that make up the event itself (the\nconstitutive aspect of explanation). In this way, the\nexplanation shows how E \u201cfit[s] into a causal\nnexus\u201d(1984: 9). For example, when two billiard balls collide\n(event E), the trajectory of each of the balls is a causal\nprocess (as shown by the fact that if the balls were scratched, such\nmarks would persist) and their collision is a causal interaction.\nExplaining E will involve both tracing these trajectories and\nnoting that E involves an interaction.\n",
