    "main_text": "Polemics: Real and Nominal Essences vs. Scholastic Substantial Forms\n2. Polemics: Real and Nominal Essences vs. Scholastic Substantial Forms\n\nNatural philosophy (as contrasted with metaphysics and mathematics) in\nthe Aristotelian tradition is the science of physical substances in\nthe sublunary world. The aim of natural philosophy is knowledge of\ncauses, and for the Aristotelian tradition, this includes knowledge\nof essences. Locke\u2019s above definition of real and\nnominal essences is given as a critical response to the Aristotelian\ninfluenced Scholasticism of the late medieval and early renaissance\nnatural philosophy. Locke\u2019s distinction between real and nominal\nessences appears to be in reference to the Aristotelian distinction\nbetween real and nominal definitions. A real definition, according to\nthe Aristotelian tradition, is one that accords with the natural\nhierarchy and identifies the essence of the species or genus being\nstudied, e.g., \u2018man is the rational animal\u2019\n(reason being the essence of the species, animal\nbeing the genus). A nominal definition, by contrast, is a\npseudo-definition that identifies the members of the species or genus,\nbut fails to capture the essence, e.g., \u2018man is the featherless\nbiped\u2019. A science of nature, for Aristotle and the Scholastics,\nconsists of real definitions and not mere nominal ones. While Locke\nagrees that a science requires knowledge of essences, and thus of\nspecies, he differs from the Aristotelians by arguing that there are\nno real definitions of substances, but there are of moral and\nmathematical concepts (see Ayers 1996, Locke, vol. II, pp.\n18\u201330). This account of real essences, then, is crafted to\nbe capacious enough to accommodate both the Aristotelian and\ncorpuscularian versions on offer. \n\nAccording to the Scholastic way of understanding the term\n\u2018essence\u2019, it refers to what makes a thing what it is:\n\n\nConcerning the real Essences of corporeal Substances, (to mention\nthose only,) there are, if I mistake not, two Opinions. The one is of\nthose, who using the Word Essence, for they know not what,\nsuppose a certain number of those Essences, according to which, all\nnatural things are made, and wherein they do exactly every one of them\npartake, and so become of this or that Species.\n(III.iii.17)\n\n\nThe Scholastic concept of essence, or what is more properly called a\n\u2018substantial form\u2019, is of an imperceptible, immaterial\nessence that imposes order onto the matter that it is joined with and\nmakes it a member of a natural species or genus, imbuing it with all\nof its relevant characteristics, i.e., its essential properties.\nEssential properties are those features that tell us to what species\nor genus an object belongs, e.g., being warm blooded is an essential\nproperty of mammals, being rational is an essential property of\nhumans, being yellowish and heavy are essential properties of gold.\nEach of these essential properties is caused by the substantial form\nthat is conjoined with the matter of the substance to make it what it\nis.\n\nIn this way, then, the substantial form of any object in the\nScholastic theory plays two roles: it (a) tells us to what species the\nsubstance belongs; and (b) it causes the observable qualities and\nproperties of the substance. For example, according to the Scholastic\ntheory, a lump of gold is an instance of gold because its\nmatter possesses the substantial form of gold which causes all of the\nproperties of gold, e.g., malleability, yellowish color, heaviness,\netc..\n\nBy contrast, however, Locke does not think of the essence of a\nphysical object as an immaterial substantial form, nor does he think\nthat a single entity can play both roles of determining the species or\ngenus membership of a substance and be the unobservable\nunderlying cause of the qualities of the substance. Instead, Locke\ndivides up the concept of essence into two different concepts playing\ntwo distinct roles. First, he defines the real essence of physical\nobjects as the internal constitution of the substance that is the\ncause of the observable qualities of the object. He then argues that\nthis internal constitution is not what answers the \u2018what is\nit?\u2019 question because the species membership of physical beings\nis only determined by their outward appearance, i.e., by their nominal\nessences. Second, he defines the nominal essence as that collection of\nobservable qualities that are included in the definition of the\nspecies or genus. This process has three stages; we create an abstract\nidea based on similarities among objects, we then give a name to that\nabstract idea, and finally we classify objects that fit our abstract\nidea into the same species or genus. So, for Locke, the real essence\nplays role (b), that is, the causal and explanatory role of being the\nphysical cause of the properties and qualities of each substance; but\nonly the nominal essence plays role (a), that is, the nominal essence\nalone determines its species or genus membership. The chart below\nillustrates this division of labor:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n(a) Determines Species/Genus\n\nMembership\n(b) Causes/Explains Observable\n\nQualities \n\nScholastics\nSubstantial Form\nSubstantial Form \n\nLocke\nNominal Essence\nReal Essence  \n\n\nOne of Locke\u2019s main purposes in making this distinction is to\ndeploy it in his criticisms of the Scholastic account of (a), the\nspecies of natural substances. However, when criticizing the\nScholastic account of (b), the explanation of the qualities of bodies,\nLocke typically refrains from invoking the concept of \u2018real\nessence\u2019 and instead talks about the primary, secondary and\ntertiary qualities of bodies (see, for example II.viii.10\u201326).\nSo, at a minimum, it seems that Locke invoked this distinction between\nreal and nominal essences in order to prove a negative point: real\nessences are not relevant to role (a).\n\nAs noted above, according to the Scholastics, species and genera are\ncreated by nature; every natural substance is a combination of matter\nand substantial form. The substantial form of any substance is its\nspecies essence, which is an immaterial entity that makes the object\nwhat it is, makes it a member of a particular species and genus and\ncauses its characteristic properties. So, for the Scholastics, all\nnatural substances belong to a determinate species by nature,\nindependently of any human naming activities. On this view then, if we\nknow what qualities a substance possesses, and we know that all\nqualities are produced by a substantial form, then it is a simple\nmatter to determine its species simply by noting the qualities the\nsubstance exhibits. For example, if what makes a particular object a\npiece of gold is the possession of the substantial form of gold, then\nwhatever exhibits the properties of gold has the substantial form of\ngold, and so we know the species to which it belongs is gold.\nCreating a taxonomy for the Scholastics is attempting to discover how\nnature has already classified substances into species and genera by\nlooking for similarities among their persistent qualities (qualities\nthat tend to remain even when the circumstances or conditions of the\nobject change) that reveal the deeper similarity of sharing\nsubstantial forms.\n\nBy distinguishing between real and nominal essences, Locke can deploy\nthese new concepts in a sustained critique of the Scholastic theory of\nspecies. Locke offers three main arguments against the Scholastic\nview.\n\nFirst, he deploys the corpuscularian hypothesis against the\nScholastics to argue that \u2018borderline cases\u2019 create a\nserious challenge to their doctrine of substantial forms, but which\nare allowed for, and even explained by, corpuscularian principles. By\nhis lights, if we assume that nature produces substances by imposing a\nsubstantial form (what Locke mockingly calls \u2018moulds and\nforms\u2019), or species essence onto them, then the existence of\nentities that either fit into more than one species, or do not fit\ninto any single species, shows us at least that not all beings are\nproduced according to natural moulds and forms:\n\n\n[The opinion] which supposes these Essences, as a certain\nnumber of Forms or Molds, wherein all natural Things, that exist, are\ncast, and do equally partake, has, I imagine, very much perplexed the\nKnowledge of natural Things. The frequent Productions of Monsters, in\nall the Species of Animals, and of Changelings, and other strange\nIssues of humane Birth, carry with them difficulties, not possible to\nconsist with this Hypothesis: Since it is as impossible, that\ntwo Things, partaking exactly of the same real Essence,\nshould have different Properties, as that two Figures partaking in the\nsame real Essence of a Circle, should have different\nProperties. (III.iii.17)\n\n\nIf nature made species or genera by giving all members of the same\nkind the same form or mould (or, he seems to suggest above, real\nessence), then there would be no way to explain generative variation\nin nature (he reiterates this kind of argument in III.vi.15\u201317)\nor the differences between samples of the same species of chemicals or\nminerals. On the other hand, if nature makes real essences, which are\nmaterial structures that cause the observable qualities of each\nsubstance, then these kinds of variations can be explained by\nvariations among the physical structures of the bodies (see Jolley\n1999, pp. 144\u201350).\n\nSecondly, as we saw above, Locke adduces the semantic point that our\ngeneral terms (and their corresponding ideas), being human constructs\nvia the process of abstraction, constitute the (nominal)\nessences of things, not some immaterial substantial form:\n\u201cWhereby it is evident, that the Essences of the\nsorts, or (if the Latin word pleases better) Species\nof Things, are nothing else but these abstract Ideas\u201d\n(III.iii.12). Abstract ideas are formed when we take a set of objects\nand mentally strip away enough particular ideas to reveal what\nproperties they all have in common. The resulting ideas are purely\nmental constructions; the putative substantial forms of the objects\nare irrelevant to this process. Therefore, essences and species are\nhuman constructs, not the products of nature, i.e., they are purely\nnominal.\n\nLocke\u2019s third argument rests on the Scholastic\u2019s\nassumption that nature produces many things alike. The natural\nproduction of physically similar entities, however, is a double-edged\nsword. Nature not only produces similarities among objects, but it\nproduces far too many similarities. That is, among the vast array of\nsimilar qualities that objects share we must select those few which we\ntake to be important enough to constitute the meaning of the general\nterm and thereby constitute the species or genus. This selection\nprocess is not something that nature can do, only we can decide which\nqualities are important enough to count as part of the definition of a\nspecies or genus.\n\nLocke has a further argument up his sleeve: generality does not exist\nin nature. For the Aristotelian tradition, perception occurs when the\nmind receives the form (i.e., sensible species) without the\nmatter of the substance. So, the human mind has access\nto forms (which are general) through\nperception. However, in the lead up to III.iii.15, Locke\nstresses that generality occurs only in words and ideas, not in nature\n(III.iii.1, 10, 13), and that we do not perceive substantial\nforms (II.xxiii.3; II.xxxi.6). Nominal essences provide the only\nuniversality we possess in natural philosophy (III.iii.9, 10, 11).\n\nBy introducing the distinction between real and nominal essences and\nthereby dividing their roles, Locke has provided himself with a number\nof resources to criticize the Scholastic theory of species. There are,\nhowever, reasons to worry about the viability of these criticisms.\nAfter all, these arguments seem to beg the question against the\nAristotelian tradition. The existence of substantial forms need not\nentail the existence of hard-edged natural kinds, and so Locke's\n'moulds and forms' metaphor does not damage the Aristotelian\nposition. In the borderline cases argument, the Aristotelian tradition\ncan appeal to their matter/form distinction and remind Locke that even\nthough the form guides the changes in material substances, not all\nmatter is suitable for all changes. That is, a form is\nteleological and is what guides the matter as it\nachieves its final cause, but not all matter is suitable to\nachieve that end. For example, wood might be highly suitable to\nconstruct a ship, but stone would not be. The matter, if\nsuitable, may indeed achieve the end of the formal cause, however,\nwhen the matter is not suitable it can result in\nmonsters and deformities. With regard to abstract ideas, i.e., nominal\nessences, being the foundation of species, the Aristotelian tradition\ncan surely reject the claim that the form plays no role in the\nformation of our abstract ideas. So long as our abstract ideas must be\nanswerable to what exists in nature, and so long as nature presents us\nwith the effects of the substantial form, what we have\navailable to include in our nominal essences will be very\nmuch rooted in the substantial form. This same argument can be applied\nto the third criticism as well; substantial forms guide our\nselection of nominally essential properties because they carve nature\nat its joints and help some appear more natural than others. Finally,\nthe claim that generality does not exist in nature\nis question-begging: if there are substantial forms, then there\nis generality in nature.\n\nIt is likely that Locke was aware of the limits of these criticisms,\nafter all, he was both educated with and taught Scholastic texts.\nNevertheless, as Jolley argues (1999, 146), Locke could reply\nby arguing that the properties of bodies are\ncausally dependent on their essences, just as all the properties\nof every triangle flow from the essences of the triangles,\nbut then why do mathematical and geometrical essences\nproduce hard-edged kinds while the essences of material bodies do\nnot? More to the point, if substantial forms are causal and\nexplanatory posits in Aristotelian scientia, and they are\nheld to be knowable via perception, but the evidence\nfrom perception yields a host of borderline cases, then it\nis plausible to conclude that either substantial forms are not doing\ntheir job or there are no such forms. However, this reply will\nnot cut much ice with the Aristotelians, who have yet to be shown\nwhy their appeal to the weakness of matter is insufficient to explain\ngenerative variation.\n\nPerhaps a more powerful interpretation of Locke's arguments would be\nto see them as an empirical challenge to (rather than as a refutation\nof) the idea that nature comes pre-structured by substantial forms. In\nreference to borderline cases, Locke could be arguing that, without\nassuming that there are substantial forms, nature does not give us\nconvincing evidence of such order. The semantic argument can be seen\nas a similar empirical challenge: there is no evidence that nature is\nnarrowly constraining the creation of our nominal essences (we have\nbroad latitude in their creation), but if there were substantial forms\nwe should expect much less latitude. It is this challenge that seems\nto undergird Locke's third argument: even though nature provides us\nwith the qualities we ultimately include in our nominal essences, it\nis up to us to determine what goes into each nominal essence, and\nthere is no place for a substantial form to be involved in that\nprocess. Although this might be a stretch, even Locke's fourth\ncriticism may still function as an empirical challenge. Perception is\na highly contentious subject that seems beyond our ability to explain,\neven by appeal to the existence of substantial forms. So, without\nevidence that there are such forms, there is no reason to take nature\nto be the locus of generality. Whether these replies would be\neffective, or even whether these are what Locke had in mind, it is\nclear that Locke was convinced that substantial forms are not a viable\ncomponent of natural philosophy.\n",
