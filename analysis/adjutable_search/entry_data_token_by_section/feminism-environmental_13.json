    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Socioeconomic Perspectives\n3.5 Socioeconomic Perspectives\nAccording to Marxist-informed \u201cmaterialist\necofeminism\u201d, socioeconomic conditions are central to the\ninterconnected dominations of women and nature (see Rosemary Hennessy\nand Chrys Ingraham 1997; Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva 1993; Ariel\nSalleh 1997). Mellor argues that while both men and women mediate\nbetween culture and nature, they do not do so equally. She argues\nagainst \u201ccapitalist patriarchy\u201d by drawing on the Marxist\nnotions of the means of production, which includes the raw\nmaterials, land and energy resources, and the forces of\nproduction, which includes the factories, machinery, technology, and\naccumulated skills of the workers. Mellor argues that the system of\npredominantly male ownership of the means and forces\nof production results in a male-biased allocation and distribution of\na society's economic resources that systematically disadvantages women\neconomically and exploits nature (Mellor 1997, 2000, 2005).\nSocioeconomic conditions are also central to Vandana Shiva's\naccount of Western development as \u201csystematic\nunderdevelopment\u201d or \u201cmaldevelopment\u201d (1988). Shiva\nargues that this maldevelopment began with European colonization\nthroughout Asia and Africa; it resulted in the creation of cash-based\neconomies that were modeled after Europe.  The colonizers replaced\nnative food crops and forests with such monoculture crops as\nsunflowers, eucalyptus, and teak, which were cash crops created\nprimarily for export. In addition, the colonizers introduced a\ngendered division of labor, where men were employed in cash-based\neconomic relationships with the colonizers and women were responsible\nfor all the household duties associated with (non-money based)\nsubsistence economies. By destroying subsistence economies,\nmaldevelopment projects created material poverty where, before, there had been\nnone. According to Shiva, it thereby contributed to the very real\n\u201cfeminization of poverty\u201d, subordination of women, and\ndegradation of nature.\n",
