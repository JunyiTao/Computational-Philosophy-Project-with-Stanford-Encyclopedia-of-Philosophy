The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of\nvalues\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the\nnormative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify\nthis distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical\nmethod. \n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is\nphilosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative\ndistinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of\ncognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments\nrelate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge\nabout an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do\nnot expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the\n\u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a\n\u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b:\n29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and\nsubjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband\nargues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even\nif they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a\nnormative demand: they ought to be accepted universally\naccording to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be\nthat the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried\nout by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a\nnon-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is\ndisagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal\nand necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be\nrecognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that\nwhich is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the\nvalidity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives.\nCritical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of\nnecessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this\nsystem and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid\njudgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are\nclosely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments\nwith a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they\nraise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be\naccepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to\ndifferent cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the\npoints of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to\nexplain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea\nthat there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the\nconception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal\nconsciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially,\nrepresented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical\nconsciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a\nrule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible\ncombinations of representations that might or might not be formed by\nempirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that\naccords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to\nbe formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is\nwhat he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought\nis related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible\ncombinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those\njudgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One\nmight say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system\nof absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the\nextent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of\nvalues, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for\nempirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically\nsituated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a\n\u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal\nconsciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d\nas a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the\nmethods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order\nscience that reflects on the methods and results of the various\nempirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue\nof which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d\n(1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out\nby means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the\nfactual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or\ngenetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the\ndifferences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and\n\u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one\nhand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d\nmethod of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating\nconsequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two\ndisciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical\nquestions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He\ndoes not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of\nthe \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the\ngenetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual\npsychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that\nexplain the actual acceptance and development of values in an\nindividual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual\nacceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper\ncannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary\nseparates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted\nvalues from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as\nnormative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic\nmethod to philosophical questions has three components. First, he\nargues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions\nabout normativity and validity, because there is too much variety\nregarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The\nempirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced\nby all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have\nbeen accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture.\nBut insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the\nvalues in question are universal and necessary. \n\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of\nall individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026\nthe \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115) \n\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical\nmeans that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the\naxioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism.\nThe argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be\nreconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and\ncultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the\nnaturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead\nto the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical\nmethod with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic\nmethod of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion\nfor distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that\nit has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle\ngleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it\nmust treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all\nequally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary\nconsequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s\ncardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all\nbeliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all\nequally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method\ndoes not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it\nalso forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An\nempirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries\nand tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and\nvalidity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d,\n\u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys\nthe basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains\nthat philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms,\nor values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot\nbe proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth,\nbeauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed.\nHence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological\nstructure:\n\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to\nwhich they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if\nthinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the\npurpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in\na manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the\nempirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological\nmethod of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal\nconsciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in\nphilosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts\nabout individual psychology and culture can provide the starting\npoints for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the\nphilosophical method as a method of reflection\n[Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware\nof its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines\nexisting claims to validity in light of teleological considerations,\nand in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life\nthat are necessary conditions for the realization of universal\nappraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological\nconsiderations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within\nitself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and\nthe \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of\nnormal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881:\n139).\n",
