    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\n4. The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\n\nAt Hamburg Cassirer found a tremendous resource for the next stage in\nhis philosophical development \u2013 the Library of the Cultural\nSciences founded by Aby Warburg. Warburg was an eminent art historian\nwith a particular interest in ancient cult, ritual, myth, and magic as\nsources of archetypal forms of emotional expression later manifested\nin Renaissance art, and the Library therefore contained abundant\nmaterials both on artistic and cultural history and on ancient myth\nand ritual. Cassirer\u2019s earliest works on the philosophy of\nsymbolic forms appeared as studies and lectures of the Warburg Library\nin the years 1922\u20131925, and the three-volume Philosophy of\nSymbolic Forms itself appeared, as noted above, in 1923, 1925,\nand 1929 respectively. Just as the genetic conception of knowledge is\nprimarily oriented towards the \u201cfact of science\u201d and,\naccordingly, takes the historical development of scientific knowledge\nas its ultimate given datum, the philosophy of symbolic forms is\noriented towards the much more general \u201cfact of culture\u201d\nand thus takes the history of human culture as a whole as its ultimate\ngiven datum. The conception of human beings as most fundamentally\n\u201csymbolic animals,\u201d interposing systems of signs or\nsystems of expression between themselves and the world, then becomes\nthe guiding philosophical motif for elucidating the corresponding\nconditions of possibility for the \u201cfact of culture\u201d in all\nof its richness and diversity.\n\nCharacteristic of the philosophy of symbolic forms is a concern for\nthe more \u201cprimitive\u201d forms of world-presentation\nunderlying the \u201chigher\u201d and more sophisticated cultural\nforms \u2013 a concern for the ordinary perceptual awareness of the\nworld expressed primarily in natural language, and, above all, for the\nmythical view of the world lying at the most primitive level of all.\nFor Cassirer, these more primitive manifestations of \u201csymbolic\nmeaning\u201d now have an independent status and foundational role\nthat is quite incompatible with both Marburg neo-Kantianism and\nKant\u2019s original philosophical conception. In particular, they\nlie at a deeper, autonomous level of spiritual life which then gives\nrise to the more sophisticated forms by a dialectical developmental\nprocess. From mythical thought, religion and art develop; from natural\nlanguage, theoretical science develops. It is precisely here that\nCassirer appeals to \u201cromantic\u201d philosophical tendencies\nlying outside the Kantian and neo-Kantian tradition, deploys an\nhistorical dialectic self-consciously derived from Hegel, and comes to\nterms with the contemporary Lebensphilosophie of Wilhelm\nDilthey, Henri Bergson, Max Scheler, and Georg Simmel \u2013 as well\nas with the closely related philosophy of Martin Heidegger.\n\nThe most basic and primitive type of symbolic meaning is\nexpressive meaning, the product of what Cassirer calls the\nexpressive function (Ausdrucksfunktion) of thought, which is\nconcerned with the experience of events in the world around us as\ncharged with affective and emotional significance, as desirable or\nhateful, comforting or threatening. It is this type of meaning that\nunderlies mythical consciousness, for Cassirer, and which explains its\nmost distinctive feature, namely, its total disregard for the\ndistinction between appearance and reality. Since the mythical world\ndoes not consist of stable and enduring substances that manifest\nthemselves from various points of view and on various occasions, but\nrather in a fleeting complex of events bound together by their\naffective and emotional \u201cphysiognomic\u201d characters, it also\nexemplifies its own particular type of causality whereby each part\nliterally contains the whole of which it is a part and can thereby\nexert all the causal efficacy of the whole. Similarly, there is no\nessential difference in efficacy between the living and the dead,\nbetween waking experiences and dreams, between the name of an object\nand the object itself, and so on. The fundamental Kantian\n\u201ccategories\u201d of space, time, substance (or object), and\ncausality thereby take on a distinctive configuration representing the\nformal a priori structure, as it were, of mythical thought.\n\nWhat Cassirer calls representative symbolic meaning, a\nproduct of the representative function (Darstellungsfunktion)\nof thought, then has the task of precipitating out of the original\nmythical flux of \u201cphysiognomic\u201d characters a world of\nstable and enduring substances, distinguishable and reidentifiable as\nsuch. Working together with the fundamentally pragmatic orientation\ntowards the world exhibited in the technical and instrumental use of\ntools and artifacts, it is in natural language, according to Cassirer,\nthat the representative function of thought is then most clearly\nvisible. For it is primarily through the medium of natural language\nthat we construct the \u201cintuitive world\u201d of ordinary sense\nperception on the basis of what Cassirer calls intuitive space and\nintuitive time. The demonstrative particles (later articles) and\ntenses of natural language specify the locations of perceived objects\nin relation to the changing spatio-temporal position of the speaker\n(relative to a \u201chere-and-now\u201d), and a unified\nspatio-temporal order thus arises in which each designated object has\na determinate relation to the speaker, his/her point of view, and\nhis/her potential range of pragmatic activities. We are now able to\ndistinguish the enduring thing-substance, on the one side, from its\nvariable manifestations from different points of view and on different\noccasions, on the other, and we thereby arrive at a new fundamental\ndistinction between appearance and reality. This distinction is then\nexpressed in its most developed form, for Cassirer, in the linguistic\nnotion of propositional truth and thus in the propositional copula.\nHere the Kantian \u201ccategories\u201d of space, time, substance,\nand causality take on a distinctively intuitive or\n\u201cpresentational\u201d configuration.\n\nThe distinction between appearance and reality, as expressed in the\npropositional copula, then leads dialectically to a new task of\nthought, the task of theoretical science, of systematic inquiry into\nthe realm of truths. Here we encounter the third and final function of\nsymbolic meaning, the significative function\n(Bedeutungsfunktion), which is exhibited most clearly,\naccording to Cassirer, in the \u201cpure category of relation.\u201d\nFor it is precisely here, in the scientific view of the world, that\nthe pure relational concepts characteristic of modern mathematics,\nlogic, and mathematical physics are finally freed from the bounds of\nsensible intuition. For example, mathematical space and time arise\nfrom intuitive space and time when we abstract from all demonstrative\nrelation to a \u201chere-and-now\u201d and consider instead the\nsingle system of relations in which all possible\n\u201chere-and-now\u201d-points are embedded; the mathematical\nsystem of the natural numbers arises when we abstract from all\nconcrete applications of counting and consider instead the single\npotentially infinite progression wherein all possible applications of\ncounting are comprehended; and so on. The eventual result is the world\nof modern mathematical physics described in Cassirer\u2019s earlier\nscientific works \u2013 a pure system of formal relations where, in\nparticular, the intuitive concept of substantial thing has finally\nbeen replaced by the relational-functional concept of universal law.\nSo it is here, and only here, that the generalized and purified form\nof (neo-)Kantianism distinctive of the Marburg School gives an\naccurate characterization of human thought. This characterization is\nnow seen as a one-sided abstraction from a much more comprehensive\ndialectical process which can no longer be adequately understood\nwithout paying equal attention to its more concrete and intuitive\nsymbolic manifestations; and it is in precisely this way, in the end,\nthat the Marburg \u201cfact of science\u201d is now firmly embedded\nwithin the much more general \u201cfact of culture\u201d as a\nwhole.\n",
