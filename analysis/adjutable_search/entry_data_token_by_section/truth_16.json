Many modern anti-realists see the theory of truth as\nthe key to formulating and defending their views. With Dummett (e.g.,\n1959; 1976; 1991), we might expect the characteristic mark of\nanti-realism to be the rejection of bivalence.\n\nIndeed, many contemporary forms of anti-realism may be formulated as\ntheories of truth, and they do typically deny bivalence. Anti-realism\ncomes in many forms, but let us take as an example a (somewhat crude)\nform of verificationism. Such a theory holds that a claim is correct\njust insofar as it is in principle verifiable, i.e., there is\na verification procedure we could in principle carry out which would\nyield the answer that the claim in question was verified.\n\nSo understood, verificationism is a theory of truth. The claim is not\nthat verification is the most important epistemic notion, but that\ntruth just is verifiability. As with the kind of realism we\nconsidered in section 4.1, this view expresses its metaphysical\ncommitments in its explanation of the nature of truth. Truth is not,\nto this view, a fully objective matter, independent of us or our\nthoughts. Instead, truth is constrained by our abilities to verify,\nand is thus constrained by our epistemic situation. Truth is to a\nsignificant degree an epistemic matter, which is typical of many\nanti-realist positions.\n\nAs Dummett says, the verificationist notion of truth does not appear\nto support bivalence. Any statement that reaches beyond what we can in\nprinciple verify or refute (verify its negation) will be a\ncounter-example to bivalence. Take, for instance, the claim that there\nis some substance, say uranium, present in some region of the universe\ntoo distant to be inspected by us within the expected lifespan of the\nuniverse. Insofar as this really would be in principle unverifiable,\nwe have no reason to maintain it is true or false according to the\nverificationist theory of truth.\n\nVerificationism of this sort is one of a family of anti-realist views.\nAnother example is the view that identifies truth with warranted\nassertibility. Assertibility, as well as verifiability, has been\nimportant in Dummett\u2019s work. (See also works of McDowell, e.g.,\n1976 and Wright, e.g., 1976; 1982; 1992.)\n\nAnti-realism of the Dummettian sort is not a descendant of the\ncoherence theory of truth per se. But in some ways, as\nDummett himself has noted, it might be construed as a descendant\n\u2013 perhaps very distant \u2013 of idealism. If idealism is the\nmost drastic form of rejection of the independence of mind and world,\nDummettian anti-realism is a more modest form, which sees epistemology\nimprinted in the world, rather than the wholesale embedding of world\ninto mind. At the same time, the idea of truth as warranted\nassertibility or verifiability reiterates a theme from the pragmatist\nviews of truth we surveyed in section 1.3.\n\nAnti-realist theories of truth, like the realist ones we discussed in\nsection 4.1, can generally make use of the Tarskian apparatus.\nConvention T, in particular, does not discriminate between realist and\nanti-realist notions of truth. Likewise, the base clauses of a\nTarskian recursive theory are given as disquotation principles, which\nare neutral between realist and anti-realist understandings of notions\nlike reference. As we saw with the correspondence theory, giving a\nfull account of the nature of truth will generally require more than\nthe Tarskian apparatus itself. How an anti-realist is to explain the\nbasic concepts that go into a Tarskian theory is a delicate matter. As\nDummett and Wright have investigated in great detail, it appears that\nthe background logic in which the theory is developed will have to be\nnon-classical.\n\nFor more on anti-realism and truth, see Shieh (2018) and the papers in\nGreenough and Lynch (2006) and the entry on\n realism.\n",
