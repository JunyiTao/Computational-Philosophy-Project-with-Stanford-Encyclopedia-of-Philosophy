It is formed by nine letters, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K,\nthat using the figures, will be organized to form propositions and\narguments, formulate and solve questions. Each letter has six terms\nassociated with it:\n\n\n\nLetter\nstands for\n\n\nB.\ngoodness\ndifference\nwhether?\nGod\njustice\navarice \n\nC.\ngreatness\nconcordance\nwhat?\nangels\nprudence\ngluttony \n\nD.\nduration\ncontrariety\nof what?\nheaven\nfortitude\nlust \n\nE.\npower\nbeginning\nwhy?\nman\ntemperance\nconceit \n\nF.\nwisdom\nmiddle\nhow much?\nimagination\nfaith\nsloth (acedia) \n\nG.\nwill\nend\nwhat quality?\nsenses\nhope\nenvy \n\nH.\nvirtue\nmajority\nwhen?\nvegetation\ncharity\nwrath \n\nI.\ntruth\nequality\nwhere?\nelements\npatience\nlies \n\nK.\nglory\nminority\nhow and with what?\ninstruments\ncompassion\ninconstancy  \n\n\nThe first of these terms refers to positive attributes that are\napplicable to all the scale of beings. The second corresponds to the\ndefinition of a relationship between entities (it is a reformulation\nof the former\n Figure T).\n The third term corresponds to the Rules and the Questions, and it\nconstitutes the most important tool for research within this model,\nfor they will be used to formulate problems and their solutions. The\nlast three terms correspond to (a) the subjects addressed by the\nArs, (b) virtues, and (c) vices. The figures will be used to\nvisually represent the relationships between the different terms in a\nsimilar way to the previous formulation of the Ars. They are\n54 principles in total, which constitute the basis of the whole system\nand whose relationships are established through the figures.\n5.6.1 First Figure\n\nThe\n First Figure\n is formed by a sole circle of nine elements, whose letters correspond\nto the terms of the first meaning of the alphabet.\n\n\n\nFirst Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n5.6.2 The Second Figure\n\nThe\n Second Figure\n is formed by three concentric circles connected by three triangles,\nsimilarly to the way\n Figure T\n was shown in the first version of the Art. In this case, only one of\nthe triangles was lost. In the edges of the triangles the terms of the\nsecond meaning of the alphabet are found, each one of them unfolded in\nthree species. Thus, for example: the first triangle deals with\ndifference, concordance, and contrariety (B, C, D). Each one of these\nconcepts has three species: sense and sense, sense and intellect,\nintellect and intellect. The second triangle, beginning, middle, end\n(E, F, G) has different species in each one of the edges. The species\nof beginning are cause, quantity, and time. In Ars brevis\n2-II, Llull explains the following\n\n\ncause means the efficient, material, formal and final causes. Quantity\nand time signify the other predicates and whatever can be reduced to\nthem.\n\n\nBonner (2007) has argued that in this section Llull introduces the\nAristotelian causes and categories, which entails the adoption of the\nterminology and concepts of this logic into his system. The middle\nhas, at the same time, three species that will be formed by the middle\nbetween subject and predicate (e.g., Man is an animal\u2014the\nphysical life), the middle between agent and patient (Love, in the\nrelationship between loved and lover), and the middle between extremes\n(e.g., between two points). The edges of the last minor triangle,\nminor, equal, major (H, I, K) share the same three species: accident\nand accident, substance and accident, substance and substance.\n\n\n\nSecond Figure.

Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n5.6.3 The Third and Fourth Figure\n\nThe\n Third\n and\n Fourth\n Figure of the new formulation of the Art have a similar function. The\nthird is a square in which the binary combinations are represented,\nwhereas the fourth is a representation of the ternary combinations\ninside the Art. The latter is formed by three concentric circles, and\nLlull explains that it must be rotated to form the different\ncombinations. That is, if the starting point of an initial combination\nis BCB, the one that will follow is CCB, building the first nine\nternary combinations accordingly. The circles are, therefore, rotated\nto the next alignment, which is BDB, and the process continues.\n\n\n\nThird Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998.

Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\n\nUnlike the two first figures, whose letters refer to the terms of the\nfirst and second signification given in the alphabet, in the Third and\nFourth Figures the letters can be substituted by any of the six\nmeanings presented in the alphabet. For example, the combination BC\ncan mean \u201cgoodness is great\u201d\u2014the terms are taken\nfrom the first meaning of the alphabet\u2014but it can also mean\n\u201cdifference is great\u201d, when the first term is taken from\nthe second meaning, and the second term is taken from the first\nmeaning. Likewise, its sense can be \u201cgoodness is\nconcordant\u201d, when the first term is taken from the first\nmeaning, and the second term is taken from the second meaning. Some\nauthors use capital letters when the first sense is used and lowercase\nletters when the second sense is used to facilitate the understanding\nand use of the Art. Thus, the given examples could be expressed as BC,\nbC, Bc.\n\nLlull introduces a table, originated from the\n Fourth Figure,\n in which all the combinations of this figure are found.\n\n\n\nTable of the Fourth Figure (fragment).\nArs brevis XVIII Century. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital\nversion Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain.\nMinisterio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\nIn this table, the letter T is introduced with a syntactic function to\nstate what terms are taken from the first meaning and which are taken\nfrom the second. The rule is that the letters found before letter T\nuse the first of the meanings of the alphabet, and the ones found\nafter, the second.\n5.7 Practicing the Ars\n\nBoth in Ars generalis ultima and Ars brevis, Llull\nexplains the operation of the Ars in two sections called\n\u201cEvacuating the\n Third Figure\u201d\n and \u201cMultiplying the\n Fourth Figure\u201d.\n\nLlull uses the term \u201cevacuate\u201d to illustrate how all the\nsenses of each one of the combinations are extracted, using the\nintellect as agent. The evacuation starts \u201cby making statements,\nthen we interchange subjects with predicates, and then put\nquestions\u201d (The Ars generalis ultima 6\u20131.\nTranslation Yanis Dambergs) That is, statements are formed using a\nterm from the first meaning of the alphabet (e.g., B, C: goodness is\ngreat); then another one is formed by using the first and second\nmeaning of the alphabet (e.g., b, B: difference is good), and then the\nsubject and the predicate are inverted (e.g., B, b: goodness is\ndifferent). There are 12 meanings in total for each combination of\nletters. The example for BC is:\n\n\n\n\nB\nC\ngoodness is great\n \nb\nB\ndifference is good \n\nB\nb\ngoodness is different\n \nb\nC\ndifference is great \n\nB\nc\ngoodness is concordant\n \nb\nc\ndifference is concordant \n\nC\nB\ngreatness is good\n \nc\nB\nconcordance is good \n\nC\nb\ngreatness is different\n \nc\nC\nconcordance is great \n\nC\nc\ngreatness is concordant\n \nc\nb\nconcordance is different  \n\n\n\nAfterwards, the corresponding questions to the third meaning of the\nletters according to the alphabet are introduced. In the case of B and\nC, it would be whether and what. Thus, based on the affirmations, the\nexample would be: \u201cGoodness is great\u201d, \u201cWhether\ngoodness is great?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is great goodness?\u201d\nThis process is applied to the 12 affirmations, thus obtaining a total\nof 36 possible meanings for the combination BC. This procedure must be\nfollowed with all the combinations found in the\n Third Figure.\n5.7.1 The Definitions and the Rules\n\nThe definitions and rules offered by Llull as part of the Ars\nmust be used to complete the evacuation and make sense of all 36\npossible combinations. There are 18 definitions: nine of them\ncorrespond to the first meaning of the alphabet, and the other nine,\nto the second meaning. The first five, for example, state that:\n\n\n\n\nB.\nGoodness is that whereby good does good. \n\nC.\nGreatness is that through which goodness, duration etc. are\ngreat. \n\nD.\nDuration is that through which goodness, greatness etc. are\nlasting. \n\nE.\nPower is that through which goodness, greatness etc. can exist\nand act. \n\nF.\nWisdom is a property by which the wise understand. \n\n\n\n\nBonner (2007) has noted that a distinctive feature of the definitions\nproposed by Llull is that they do not follow the Aristotelian model.\nOn the contrary, they define the subject based on his activity, which\nallows the application of the definition of greatness, for example, to\nany of the beings in the ladder and not exclusively to God. That is\nprecisely what he would do to complete the evacuation of the\n Third Figure,\n as will be explained later.\n\nThe rules correspond to the third of the meanings given to the\nalphabet. Each one of these questions has, at the same time, species\nthat will be useful to establish the type of answer that is sought or\nthe nature of the question that wishes to be formulated. For example,\nthe first, \u201cWhether?\u201d, has three species, namely doubt,\naffirmation, and negation. The second, \u201cWhat?\u201d, has four\nspecies: the first defines the subject, the second defines the\ncorrelatives, the third asks what a certain thing is in another thing\n(e.g., \u201cWhat is the intellect in other things?\u201d), and the\nfourth asks what a certain thing does or has in another thing (e.g.,\n\u201cWhat does the intellect have in other things?\u201d).\n\nTo finalize the evacuation of the\n third figure,\n the intellect has to build the meanings with these tools, following\nthe guide offered by the definitions and the rules. For example, in\nthe case of the first combination BC, \u201cgoodness is great\u201d,\nfollowing rule C, the question is formulated as \u201cIs goodness\ngreat?\u201d Its evacuation would follow the application of the first\nspecies of Rule C, to define the predicate: \u201cGreatness is a\nbeing on account of which goodness is great.\u201d Then, the second\nspecies of Rule C, by which the subject is defined by its correlative,\nwould be: \u201cGoodness is great because it has its essential\nbonifier, bonifiable, and bonifying\u201d. Consequently, following\nthe fourth species in Rule C (What does goodness have in greatness?),\ngoodness would have in greatness its \u201cnatural repose\u201d.\nFinally, the third species of Rule C (What is goodness in\ngreatness?),\n\n\nit is in difference and concordance by definition as it differentiates\nand merges its coessential correlatives within its genus and essence\nfrom which great moral goodness arises. (The Ars generalis\nultima 6\u20131. Translation Yanis Dambergs)\n\n5.7.2 Multiplication of the Fourth Figure\n\nFor the\n fourth figure,\n Llull follows a similar procedure to the one found in the\n third figure.\n First, ternary combinations can be made based on the initial\ncombination. For example, based on B C D, B C E would follow, then B C\nF, and so on. Consequently, for each triple combination of letters,\nfor example, B C D, it is possible to formulate 20 questions based on\nthe first, the second, and the third meaning of the alphabet to obtain\nthe form of a question. There are 20 questions in total for each\ncolumn in the table. For example:\n\n\n\n\nB\nC\nD\nWhether goodness is so great that it is eternal? \n\nB\nC\nb\nWhether there is some goodness so great that it contains within\nitself different things coessential with itself? \n\nC\nD\nb\nWhat is great difference of eternity? \n\nC\nD\nc\nWhat is great and eternal concordance? \n\nD\nb\nc\nOf what does the difference of concordance and eternity\nconsist? \n\nD\nb\nd\nOf what does the difference of eternity and contrariety\nconsist?  \n\n\n\nThe way to solve these questions follows the same procedure as in the\ncase of the\n third figure,\n combining definitions and rules, according to the involved letters,\ntheir meaning in the alphabet, and the species of the rules used in\neach one of them.\n5.7.3 Combination of the Principles, the Rules, the Subjects, the Virtues, and the Vices\n\nIn the ternary form of the Ars, Llull extensively uses the\ncombining structure. Thus, the principles of the\nArs\u2014the first and the second meaning of the\nalphabet\u2014are combined among themselves and the rules to obtain\nan exhaustive relationship of all that can be affirmed from the\ncombination of the principles and the rules. This is a fundamental\ntool for the user of the Ars, for it is following this\n\u201cmixture\u201d, as designated by Llull, of the principles, that\nthe identification of the appropriate principle to solve the questions\nwill be easier. The same combining procedure must be applied to the\nnine subjects or beings with which Llull has formed a hierarchy of\nreality\u2014the fourth meaning of the alphabet: God, Angel, Heaven,\nMan, imaginative, sensitive, vegetative, elementative, instrumentality\nor artifice. Each one of these must be combined with the principles\nand the rules to exhaustively obtain what can be said of each one, in\norder to answer concrete questions. This procedure is also applied to\nthe fifth and sixth meaning of the alphabet, that is, the virtues and\nvices.\n5.7.4 Questions and Use of the Ars\n\nBoth Ars Generalis Ultima and Ars Brevis conclude\nwith a sequence of questions that can be formulated, and it is\nnormally illustrated how they are answered using the combining\nmechanisms of the Ars. However, these are not the only\nquestions that the Ars can answer. Llull himself explains in\nboth texts that, above all, the Ars is an instrument to solve\nproblems and develop arguments. Consequently, the majority of the\nresolved questions show the exemplary character of the use of the\nArs. In the section dedicated to the teaching of the\nArs, Llull notes two things. The first highlights the\nintention of creating an instrument to reason without appealing to\nauthority. He writes in Ars Generalis Ultima 13\u20132:\n\n\nSecond, he shall clearly explain the text to the students through\nreasoning, without any appeal to authority, and the students shall\nread through the text, and put any questions they have about it to the\nteacher. (Translation Yanis Dambergs)\n\n\nBut the ultimate sense of the teaching and use of the Art is\nillustrated in this recommendation in the Ars generalis\nultima 13\u20133:\n\n\nThe teacher shall propose questions to the students and solve them by\nproviding reasons according to the process of this art, for without\nreasoning, the artist cannot make it work. Here we should note that\nthe art has three friends, namely intellectual subtlety, skill in\nreasoning, and good intentions, for without these, no one can learn\nit. (Translation Yanis Dambergs)\n",
