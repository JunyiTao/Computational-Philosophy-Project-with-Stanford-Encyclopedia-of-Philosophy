    "main_text": "Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth || Discussion\n1.3 Discussion\n\nThe means-ends analysis of the Riddle of Induction illustrates a\nnumber of philosophically important points that holds for\nlearning-theoretic analysis in general.\n\nEqual Treatment of All Hypotheses. As in the previous example,\nnothing in this argument hinges on arguments to the effect that\ncertain possibilities are not to be taken seriously a priori. In\nparticular, nothing in the argument says that generalizations with\ngrue predicates are ill-formed, unlawlike, or in some other way a\npriori inferior to \u201call emeralds are green\u201d. \nLanguage Invariance. The analysis does not depend on the\nvocabulary in which the evidence and generalizations are framed. For\nease of exposition, I have mostly used the green-blue reference frame.\nHowever, grue-bleen speakers would agree that the aim of reliably\nsettling on a correct generalization requires the natural projection\nrule rather than the gruesome one, even if they would want to express\nthe conjectures of the natural rule in their grue-bleen language\nrather than the blue-green language that we have used so far.\n\nDependence on Context. Though the analysis does not depend on\nlanguage, it does depend on assumptions about what the possible\nobservation sequences are. The example as described above seems to\ncomprise the possibilities that correspond to the colour predicates\nGoodman himself discussed. But means-ends analysis applies just as\nmuch to other sets of possible predicates. Schulte [1999] and Chart\n[2000] discuss a number of other versions of the Riddle of Induction,\nin some of which means-ends analysis favours projecting that all\nemeralds are grue on a sample of all green emeralds. \n\n",
