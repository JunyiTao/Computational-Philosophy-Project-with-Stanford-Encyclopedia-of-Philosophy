    "main_text": "Piety: Welcoming What Happens as Part of the Whole || Providence or Atoms?\n4.1 Providence or Atoms?\n\n\nNine times in the Meditations, Marcus lays out the\nalternatives: providence, nature, reason, on the one hand, or atoms,\non the other (iv.3, vi.24, vii.32, vii.50, viii.17, ix.28, xi.39, x.6,\nxi.18). (On these passages, see Cooper 2004.[5]) Although he does not\nexplain, the reference is clear enough: either the world and what\nhappens is the design of a providential God, as believed by the Stoics\n(and Platonists), or the outcome of atoms colliding randomly in the\nvoid, as believed by the Epicureans. What is not obvious is why Marcus\nis laying out these alternatives. Is it because his grasp of Stoic\nphysics is so tenuous that he must be open to the possibility that\nEpicurean physics is true (Rist 1982, 43, Annas 2004, 116)? Marcus\ndoes at one point express despair about his own grasp of physics\n(vii.67). Or is his point that whether one\u2019s physics is Epicurean or\nStoic, one must live as the Stoics enjoin (Annas, 108\u2013114,\nHadot, 148), that is to say, rationally, with a single purpose, rising\nabove conventional goods and evils (ix.28)?  Does the convergence of\nEpicureans and Stoics on such ethical points, in view of the two\nschools\u2019 very different physical opinions, strengthen his confidence\nin the ethics (Annas, 109)?\n\n\nIn one passage of the Meditations, Marcus gives the\n\u2018providence or atoms\u2019 alternatives when he is clearly\ninterested in the convergence of ethical opinion among all the\nwise\u2014not only Stoics and Epicureans, for he also cites\nDemocritus, Plato and Antisthenes\u2014on the insignificance of\nmatters which ordinary people value most (life and death, pain,\nreputation) and the far greater importance of virtue (vii.32\nff.). In this context, Marcus puts Epicurus\u2019 view that at\ndeath our soul-atoms are dispersed and we cease to exist on all fours\nwith the Stoic view that Nature either extinguishes or transforms us at\ndeath. Here Marcus also quotes Epicurus on pain with\napproval: pain is either bearable (if long-lasting) or short (if\nintense). His point seems to be that whatever one\u2019s\nparticular philosophical allegiance, allegiance to philosophy involves\nrising above pain, death, and reputation\u2014and also, it turns out,\ninvolves not grumbling: for if the way things are is due to\nprovidence, then they could not be better and one is wrong to grumble,\nbut if the way things are is due to chance, then it is pointless to\ngrumble (viii.17, ix.39).\n\n\nStill, Marcus is not really open to the possibility of Epicurean\nphysics. He asserts repeatedly, after laying out the\n\u2018providence or atoms\u2019 options, that the world is in fact\ngoverned by an intelligent nature of which he is a functional part,\nlike a citizen of a state (iv.3, x.6). So we should not make too\nmuch of Marcus\u2019 diffidence about his mastery of physics (vii.67),\nfor he may only mean that his own technical grasp of Stoic physics is\ninadequate, rather than that he lacks confidence in its superiority\nover Epicurean physics. Elsewhere he insists that he has a\nsufficient conception (ennoia) of a life according to nature\nso as to live it (i.9, 17).\n\n\nWe also see Marcus\u2019 reliance on Stoic physics in his\ninnovative derivation of the Stoic doctrine of the indifference of\neverything except virtue and vice from providence.  Since wealth,\nreputation, and health are distributed among the virtuous and the\nvicious indiscriminately, he reasons, they cannot be good, for that\nwould be contrary to providence (ii.11).  This does not mean Marcus is\ngenerally grounding ethics in physics,\n however.[6]\n According to the\nStoics, the beliefs of anyone other than a wise and fully virtuous\nperson are weak and unstable (since not anchored in an understanding\nof the whole), and so we should expect a non-wise Stoic like Marcus to\nseek out all kinds of reasons to shore up his ethical beliefs. Marcus\ncan consistently regard these \u2018back-up\u2019 arguments for a\nmoment of weakness as weaker and less plausible than the Stoic\narguments and at the same time as important to have at hand\u2014as,\nif you\u2019re trying to quit smoking, you might hang on to \u2018it gives\nyou wrinkles\u2019 for the moments in which \u2018it gives you\ncancer\u2019 isn\u2019t doing the trick.\n\n\nFinally, Marcus uses \u2018providence or atoms\u2019 in the\nMeditations to drive out an impious attitude:\n\n\nAre you discontented with the part you have been assigned in the\nwhole? Recall the alternatives: providence or atoms, and\nhow many are the demonstrations, that the cosmos is a city.\n(iv.3.2)\n\n\nTo understand what the thought, \u2018providence or atoms\u2019,\nis doing here we have to connect it with the discontent that is the\ntopic of the passage. Marcus is admonishing himself for his\ndiscontent with things as they stand, saying to himself, \u2018if you\nare finding fault with things as they are, then you must think that\nthey are not due to providence. But if they\u2019re not due to\nprovidence, then they\u2019re the result of random\ncauses.\u2019 In this passage, \u2018atoms\u2019 functions as\nthe implicit commitment of one who finds fault with things as they\nare. The reasoning works to raise the stakes for someone who is\ngrumbling at the way things are. It brings out that there is a\ncontradiction between believing, as a Stoic must, that the world is\nprovidentially run, and being discontented with anything that\nhappens. Once the contradiction is brought out, it becomes clear\nwhich of the two alternatives a Stoic must plump for, and what follows\nabout the attitudes he must consequently adopt towards the world and\nevery part of it. Sometimes Marcus spells out these steps:\n\u2018But look at the evidence in favour of providence\u2014the whole\ncosmos is organised like a city, that is to say, each part is so\norganized as to serve the good of the whole\u2019. For example,\nat iv.27, Marcus appears to be starting to consider the twin\npossibilities that the world is a cosmos or a chaotic mixture\n(kuke\u00f4n, referring perhaps to Heraclitus fr. 125), but\nthen he immediately asserts that it is a cosmos. Often, however,\nMarcus does not have to spell this out. In any event, what\n\u2018atoms\u2019 stands for, in this context, is impiety. So\nMarcus is telling his grumbling self: your grumbling is evidence\nof impiety, evidence of your being like an Epicurean\u2014except that\nactual Epicureans are more philosophical and do not grumble about an\nirrational cosmos bringing them bad luck, but rather, try themselves to\nlive rationally.\n\n\nThis last use of \u2018providence or atoms\u2019 shows that since\nMarcus is writing to effect certain psychological attitudes in\nhimself, we have to look to context to determine what the desired\nattitude is, and then determine how the things he tells himself are\nsupposed to effect the attitude. Perhaps bringing about the desired attitude calls\nfor making hyperbolic statements in order to correct for some natural\ntendency he thinks he has. If we do not keep this in mind as we read\nMarcus, we will only find contradictions, tensions, and ambivalences\nand we will conclude that Marcus is an eclectic and imprecise\nthinker.\n\n",
