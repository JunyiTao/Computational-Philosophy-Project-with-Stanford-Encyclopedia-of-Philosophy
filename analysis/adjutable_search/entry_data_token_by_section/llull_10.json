    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Order, Participation, Influence\n3.2 Order, Participation, Influence\n\nDuring his process of formation, Ramon Llull develops a metaphysics of\nsimilarity, under the probable influence of Saint Bonaventure. This\nmetaphysics dominates his first texts and his first versions of the\nArs. It is based on the idea that creation has a\nrepresentative function: it is a mirror (Mayer 2016) or a net of\n\u201ctraces\u201d (Rubio 2008b: 325) in which divine perfection is\nreflected.\n\nIn Llull\u2019s metaphysics, the existence of things is explained\nbased on the \u201csimilarity\u201d that their nature shares with\nother beings, and the way in which this resemblance\n\u201cparticipates\u201d in the nature of other superior beings like\nPrinciples or Dignities. The \u201csimilarity\u201d expresses a\nrelationship of correspondence among beings, which is also designated\n\u201csignification\u201d by Llull, as it is a relationship by which\nGod is manifest in creation. \u201cIn the perfection of the created\ngoodness\u201d\u2014wrote Llull in Libre dels proverbis de\nRamon LXXXI\u2014\u201cthe perfection of the uncreated goodness\nis signified\u201d.\n\nSignification does not only describe the relationship between creation\nand divinity. In addition, it describes the relationship among the\ndifferent degrees of existence. Llull shares the theory\u2014commonly\nused in Christian, Jewish, and Arab cultures\u2014of a ladder of\nbeings. It is organized based on the existence of an order\u2014a\nstructure that organizes things according to a purpose\u2014which\nresults in a hierarchy defined by similarity or difference in each\ndegree of being ascending or descending in the ladder. In\nLlull\u2019s metaphysics, these degrees are as follows: (1)\nElementative, which corresponds to the four elements; (2) Vegetative,\nwhich encompasses beings capable of nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction; (3) Sensitive, which includes beings who are able to\nhave sensory perception; (4) Imaginative, which includes beings who\nare capable of internally reproducing what they have perceived; (5)\nMan, as a rational being, and at the same time, participant of both\nthe spiritual and the material field; (6) Heaven, which includes the\ncelestial spheres; (7) Angels, pure spirits without a body; and\nfinally (8) God, the highest step of the ladder.\n\nAll beings, except God, are dependent, for the ultimate signification\nof creation is given by the divinity, who expresses itself through\ncreation. An important feature of this organization of creation is\nthat, according to Llull, regardless of the step in the ladder in\nwhich a being is found, it is possible to ascend or descend through it\ndue to the similarity that interconnects all the steps. This network\nof significations given by the similarities\u2014as shown in the case\nof the principles\u2014shows a ladder of knowledge through which both\nascent and descent are possible, through sensory data to the\nintellectual understanding of spiritual reality, and inversely.\n\nOne of the innovations introduced by Llull in the ladder of beings is\nthe category he calls instrumentality or artifice, which is introduced\nafter he begins the reformulation of the Ars in 1290. It\nencompasses instrumental or artificial beings, which are a result of\nthe instrumental or artificial power or faculty of man. Within the\nladder, they would be found below the Elementative step.\n",
