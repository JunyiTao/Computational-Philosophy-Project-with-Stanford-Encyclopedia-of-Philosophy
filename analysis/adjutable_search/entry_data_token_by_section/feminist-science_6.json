Feminist Philosophy of Science\n\nAs noted in\n section 2,\n feminist philosophies of science came of age during the 1980s and\n90s, the period of the \u201cscience wars\u201d. The\ninterdisciplinary analysis of science during this period included an\nexploration of the ways that society shaped the context of research.\nCritics interpreted this shift in interests as opening the door to\nrelativism and undermining the presumed objectivity of\nscience\u2014an objectivity thought to be guaranteed by scientific\nmethod understood as value-free. Much early feminist philosophy of\nscience and epistemology was centered on defending the idea that\nscience informed by feminist analysis would be better science and so\nnot antithetical to the aims of science (such as the pursuit of truth)\nin the ways that critics feared. The concern of feminist philosophy of\nscience and epistemology with objectivity reflects this.\n\nSandra Harding (1986) characterized three approaches to feminist\nphilosophy of science: feminist empiricism, feminist postmodernism,\nand feminist standpoint theory. Much of the subsequent work took this\ntripartite distinction among feminist approaches as a starting point\n(see\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n In part, because of work on science and values in both feminist\nphilosophy of science and philosophy of science more broadly, the\nearly forms of feminist empiricism described in\n section 2.1\n have evolved into an empiricism that acknowledges that values may\nplay a role in science. This is reflected in a convergence of the two\ndominant Anglo-American feminist approaches of the late twentieth and\nearly twenty-first centuries\u2014feminist empiricism and feminist\nstandpoint theory. Kristen Intemann suggests that the resulting views\nmight be labelled \u201cfeminist standpoint empiricism\u201d\n(Intemann 2010).\n\nThe following is an account of some of the ways in which feminist\nphilosophers have responded to the challenge of acknowledging that\nsocial, political, and cultural values can play a positive role in\nscientific knowledge production.\n",
