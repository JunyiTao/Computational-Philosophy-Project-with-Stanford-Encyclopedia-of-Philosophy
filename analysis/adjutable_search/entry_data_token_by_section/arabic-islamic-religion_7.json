God and the universe: creation and conservation/maintenance of the universe\n\nA question closely related to the existence of God is that of\nGod\u2019s relation to other existents, that is, the universe. There\nare two distinct but related aspects to this question. The first is\nwhether God is the cause of the universe\u2019s existence, for there\nhave been thinkers, like Aristotle, who believe both that God (or at\nleast a first unmoved mover) exists and is related to the cosmos,\nwhile denying that God is the cause of the universe\u2019s very\nexistence. The question here is whether God is a creator. The second\naspect to the question of God\u2019s relation to the universe assumes\nthat God is a creator and further asks, \u201cWhat is God\u2019s\nimmediate and present causal relation to the universe?\u201d Some\nthinkers, like deists, maintain that God creates the universe and then\nproverbially steps back and lets the world continue on its own like a\nwell-made clock. Others, in contrast, hold that at every moment that\nthe world exists, it is causally and ontologically dependent upon\nGod\u2019s conserving power and should God remove his proverbial\nhand, the cosmos would slip into nothingness and oblivion. Muslim\nphilosophers and theologians alike had decided views on both of these\nissues.\n",
