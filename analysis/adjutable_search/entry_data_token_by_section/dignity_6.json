    "main_text": "Formulating Dignity || Are distinctiveness and fragility defining properties of dignity?\n2.3 Are distinctiveness and fragility defining properties of dignity?\n\nIt is possible to take an even wider view on the defining criteria of\ndignity. For example, consider Etinson (2020), who represents another\ncase of conscientious second-order theorizing. Etinson argues that a\ncomplete theory of dignity should explain not only what\n\u201cgrounds\u201d dignity\u2014\u201cthat is, how and why one\ncomes to possess or lose it\u201d\u2014but also its\n\u201cproper\u201d method\u2014that is, \u201chow inquiry into all\nof this should proceed and be understood\u201d (2020: 356). The\nlatter demand is akin to calling for an articulation of the defining\nproperties of dignity, in the sense that we have been discussing.\nHowever, Etinson adds an important substantive claim about this\nmethod: He agrees that dignity is partly distinguished by something\nlike a distinctive \u201cnormative function\u201d, but sharpens this\nclaim by suggesting that to explain this function, we should focus\nspecifically on the conditions of dignity\u2019s violation. This\nrefinement is important for two broad reasons.\n\nFirst, over its long history, inquiry into human dignity has often\nbeen conjoined with considerations of what it means to harm dignity:\nWhat constitutes disrespect of dignity? Can we lose it? Can it be\ndestroyed? And so on. Call this, the question of dignity\u2019s\n\u201cfragility\u201d. Sometimes, this question is taken up within a\ndirect examination of dignity (see, e.g., Kaplan 1999 or Dussel\n2003). At other times, the motivation is pragmatic. For example, in\nhis reflection on legal appeals to dignity, Schacter (1983)\nwrites:\n\n\nWhen [dignity] has been invoked in concrete situations, it has been\ngenerally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized\neven if the abstract term cannot be defined. \u201cI know it when I\nsee it even if I cannot tell you what it is\u201d. (1983: 849)\n\n\nAnd in some cases, these reflections go the other way around; that is,\nfrom an analysis of a specific kind of dehumanizing harm\n(slavery, torture, rape, genocide; alienation, humiliation,\nembarrassment) to dignity, or one of its close cognates like\n\u201chumanity\u201d (see especially, Neuh\u00e4user 2011; Morawa\n2013; Haslam 2014; Frick 2021; Mikkola\n 2021).[5]\n\nBut whatever the context, it is crucial to distinguish between\nfirst-order encounters with dignity\u2019s fragility, and\nsecond-order efforts that try to draw a connection between a negative\nmethodology centered on the question of fragility and the positive\neffort to articulate the defining properties of dignity. It is the\nlatter claim that Etinson makes, illustrated in the following incisive\npoint:\n\n\nNot all moral wrongs convincingly register as violations of human\ndignity\u2026And this suggests that dignity is normatively\nspecial\u2014that its violation represents a particular type of\nwrong. (2020: 357)\n\n\nEssentially, Etinson is arguing that (1) we should add to the defining\nproperties of dignity, that the value or status \u201cdignity\u201d\npicks out is in some sense \u201cnormatively distinctive\u201d; and\n(2) in order to articulate (positively) what makes it distinctive, we\nmust investigate (negatively) what it means to harm it. Thus, for\nEtinson, dignity does not simply have the normative function to\n\u201cset off\u201d the special status of humans in our practical\ndeliberations; it sets off humans in a special way. And this\n\u201cway\u201d can only be understood through a consideration of\ndignity\u2019s fragility.\n\nThe second reason for underlining this kind of negative methodology\ncomes from Killmister (2020), who also makes second-order claims about\nthe proper method for theorizing dignity. On her view, all the primary\nsenses of dignity in the general schema can be harmed in some way or\nother. Each can be injured, lowered, embarrassed, humiliated,\nthreatened, frustrated, even destroyed. Correspondingly, it is a\ncriterion of any satisfactory theory, that it explains the nature and\nconditions of dignity\u2019s fragility in all its primary\nsenses\n (categories 1\u20134\n in the general schema).\n\nThe emphasis on \u201call\u201d is important. Killmister\u2019s\ntheory stands out for being an attempt to use the criterion of\nfragility to offer a unified theory of dignity. And this raises a\nquestion beyond whether fragility is a defining property of dignity.\nNamely, for any given theory of dignity, does it purport to theorize\ndignity in general, or human dignity in particular? Most\nliterature bearing the term \u201cdignity\u201d in its title will\nsay at some point that it is really or mostly about human dignity. But\nif so, then are such theories in some sense incomplete? Must a\ncomplete theory of human dignity\n (category 4\n in the general schema) reconcile itself with the other primary senses\nof the term\n (categories 1\u20133),\n as Killmister implores?\n\nThe next section attempts to offer some footholds for answering these\nnew questions. But there is one more point to make here, because it is\npertinent to second-order questions about how to formulate dignity.\nPart of what motivates Killmister\u2019s effort at a unified theory\nis an attending argument that theories of dignity should fit with\neveryday ways of speaking about dignity. And everyday talk of dignity,\nshe argues, often refers to the other primary senses of dignity in the\ngeneral schema. Moreover, she claims that all these ways of talking\nare connected by the fragility criterion, as well as some of the other\ndefining criteria we have discussed, especially (A) the idea of a\nnormative function and (B) an essential connection to respect.\nFinally, she treats this \u201cfit\u201d between her account of the\ndefining properties of dignity and everyday talk about dignity as\nimportant evidence for the correctness of her own criteria. Nor is she\nalone in staking evidentiary value on fitness to everyday language.\nFor example, Bird (2013) and Etinson (2020) make similar\n arguments.[6]\n Do we agree? Surely, a good theory of dignity will not run roughshod\nover everyday usage. Still, exactly how beholden should a theory\nbe?\n",
