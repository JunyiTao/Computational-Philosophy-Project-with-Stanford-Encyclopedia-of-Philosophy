    "main_text": "The Science of Human Action and Social Reform || The Scope and Limits of Chance\n3.2 The Scope and Limits of Chance\n\nIn \u201cSociology Hesitant\u201d (ca. 1905), perhaps his most\ntheoretically rich contribution to the philosophy of the human\nsciences, Du Bois takes issue with Comte\u2019s and Spencer\u2019s\ncollectivist\n holism[29]\u2014the\n thesis that society is a concrete whole (for Du Bois, a\n\u201cmystical whole\u201d) formed of discrete units\u2014and he\nagain defends the view that society comprises the \u201cdeeds of\nmen,\u201d as well as the \u201claw, rule, and rythm\u201d [sic]\ngoverning those deeds (ca. 1905, 274). For Du Bois, sociology is the\nscience of human action, not the science of society as such, or the\nscience of society as a whole.\n\nWhy, Du Bois asks, did Comte \u201chesitate so strangely\u201d\nbefore the prospect of treating human action as the proper object of\nsociological inquiry? The answer, Du Bois claims, is the \u201cGreat\nAssumption\u2026that in the deeds of men there lies along with\nrhythm and rule\u2026something incalculable\u201d\u2014an\nassumption in light of which the prospect of launching a science that\n\u201cwould discover and formulate the exact laws of human\naction\u2026seemed to be and was preposterous\u201d (ca. 1905,\n274). Comte wavered before what Du Bois calls \u201cParadox:\u201d\non one hand, \u201cThe evident rhythm of human action;\u201d on the\nother, \u201cThe evident incalculability of human action\u201d (ca.\n1905, 275). Where Comte wavers, however, Du Bois sallies forth,\nwriting \u201c[w]hy not\u2026flatly face the Paradox? frankly state\nthe Hypothesis of Law and the Assumption of Chance and seek to\ndetermine by study and measurement the limits of each\u201d (ca.\n1905, 276).\n\nHuman conduct is subject to the \u201cprimary\u201d rhythms of\nphysical law, as well as to the \u201csecondary\u201d rhythms of\nsocial regularities; social regularities exhibit \u201cnearly\u201d\nthe same uniformity as physical law, and they are also \u201cliable\nto stoppage and change\u201d (ca. 1905, 278). Aspiring to unite the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften\u2014\u201cthe science of man and\nphysical science\u201d\u2014Du Bois characterizes sociology as\n\u201cassuming the data of physics and studying within these that\nrealm where determinate force is acted on by human wills, by\nindeterminate force\u201d (ca. 1905, 277\u2013278).\n\nPhysical laws and social regularities alike limit the scope of chance,\nwhich is to say that they limit the scope of\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d force, or \u201cundetermined\u201d\nchoice, or, as Du Bois likewise puts the point, of \u201cfree\u201d\nand \u201cinexplicable\u201d will (ca. 1905, 276\u2013278). In\npresupposing chance, sociology presupposes free will.\nSociology\u2019s attempt to measure chance and free will is its\nattempt to measure the degree to which physical and social\nregularities limit and constrain the range of choice and action that\nis \u201cundetermined by and independent of actions gone\nbefore\u201d(ca. 1905, 278).\n\nSome forty years after Du Bois wrote \u201cSociology Hesitant,\u201d\nhe appears to allude to the earlier, then unpublished essay; indeed,\nhe reflects at length on the argument of the essay, suggesting that it\nmarked the beginning of a shift in his \u201cwhole attitude towards\nthe social sciences\u201d (1944, 56):\n\n\nThen, too, for what Law was I searching? In accord with what\nunchangeable scientific law was the world of interracial discord\naround me working? I fell back upon my Royce and James and deserted\nSchmoller and Weber. I saw the action of physical law in the actions\nof men; but I saw more than that: I saw rhythms and tendencies;\ncoincidence and probabilities; and I saw that, which for want of\nanother word, I must in accord with strict tenets of Science, call\nChance. I went forward to build a sociology, which I conceived as the\nattempt to measure the element of Chance in human conduct. This was\nthe Jamesian pragmatism, applied not simply to ethics, but to all\nhuman action, beyond what seemed to me, increasingly, the distinct\nlimits of physical law.\n\nMy work assumed from now on a certain tingling challenge of risk; what\nthe \u201cCaptain of Industry\u201d of that day was experiencing in\n\u201ckick,\u201d from money changing, railway consolidation and\ncorporation floating, I was, in what appeared to me on a large scale,\nessaying in the relations of men of daily life (1944,\n 57\u201358).[30]\n\n\nDu Bois\u2019s references to Weber, Schmoller, Royce, James, and\nJamesian pragmatism tie his earlier critique of Comte to an engagement\nwith what James dubbed \u201cthe dilemma of determinism\u201d\n(James, 1884). Weber was methodologically agnostic with regard to the\ndispute between metaphysical determinists and indeterminists, arguing\nthat neither position entailed consequences bearing on the research\npractices of the historical and cultural sciences, and taking\nSchmoller to task for his profession of faith in metaphysical\ndeterminism (see Weber, 1905a, 197\u2013196, 278; Ringer, 1997,\n57\u201358, 91). Thus, Du Bois breaks with both his German teachers\nin insisting that chance\u2014again, incalculable actions (and\nchoices) undetermined by and independent of actions gone\nbefore\u2014exists in the world and in explicitly endorsing\n\u201cthe assumption of chance\u201d as a principle of sociological\n method.[31]\n Du Bois\u2019s contention that the individual is free to the extent\nthat her choices escape explanation in terms of physical and social\nlaws and regularities echoes Royce\u2019s argument that, because\n\u201cthe individual as such is never the mere result of law,\u201d\nno causal explanation can \u201cpredetermine\u201d what she\n\u201cuniquely wills\u201d (Royce, 1899, 467\u2013468). Du Bois\nmisleads, however, when he retrospectively suggests that the argument\nof \u201cSociology Hesitant\u201d aligned him with James.\n\nTo be sure, Du Bois\u2019s language and analysis owe a debt\nto James\u2019s \u201cThe Dilemma of Determinism\u201d (1884) and,\nin particular, to James\u2019s conceptualization of the will\u2019s\nindependence (its ability to choose courses of action not fixed\n\u201cby parts of the universe already laid down\u201d (1884, 150))\nin terms of the concept of chance\u2014a debt Du Bois acknowledges\nwhen he describes his view as \u201cJamesian pragmatism.\u201d James\nexplains the ethical implications of his indeterminism when he takes\nissue with Schopenhauer, \u201cwho enforces his determinism by the\nargument that with a given fixed character only one reaction is\npossible under given circumstances\u201d (1879, 13). Schopenhauer\nforgets, James argues, that \u201cin these critical ethical moments,\nwhat consciously seems to be in question is the very\ncomplexion of the character\u201d (1879, 13). As a sociologist, Du\nBois\u2019s purports to have applied Jamesian pragmatism beyond the\nsphere of ethics, to \u201call human action,\u201d but it is\nprecisely here that he breaks with James; for notwithstanding his\ndefense of indeterminism, James is skeptical of the possibility of\nmeasuring the degree to which the will is free (James, 1890, 572). In\naddition, James insists that the science of psychology must\nmethodologically reject the assumption of chance. Psychology\n\u201cabstracts from free-will without necessarily denying its\nexistence\u201d (James, 1892,\n 457).[32]\n\nDu Bois was no less interested in determining (again, \u201cby study\nand measurement\u201d) the limits of law than he was in determining\nthe limits of chance. Law, he believed, marked the limit of chance,\nand chance, he believed, marked the limit of law. Knowledge of social\nlaws and regularities can contribute to social reform by enabling the\nsocial reformer causally to explain social problems and rationally to\nchart plans to solve those problems. Knowledge of the element of\nchance\u2014or, more exactly, of the scope and limits of chance in\norganized, modern social life\u2014can contribute to social reform by\nenabling the reformer to gauge the extent to which implementing his\nideas would entail experimenting with (\u201cessaying\u201d) plans\nof action that, due to the play of chance, carry a significant risk of\nfailure\u2014plans that he could not confidently endorse, despite his\nknowledge of the social laws and regularities shaping modern social\nlife. Just as knowledge of the scope and limits of chance could\nprovide the \u201cCaptain of Industry\u201d who speculates in\ncurrency and trades in floated, corporate stock a reason to modify his\ninvestment decisions, so too could it provide the reformer a reason to\nmodify his plans of action and similarly to meet the \u201ctingling\nchallenge of\n risk.\u201d[33]\n",
