    "main_text": "Introduction || Empiricism\n1.2 Empiricism\n\nEmpiricists also endorse the Intuition/Deduction thesis, but in a more\nrestricted sense than the rationalists: this thesis applies only to\nrelations of the contents of our minds, not also about empirical\nfacts, learned from the external world.  By contrast, empiricists\nreject the Innate Knowledge and Innate Concept theses. Insofar as we\nhave knowledge in a subject, our knowledge is gained, not\nonly triggered, by our experiences, be they sensorial or\nreflective. Experience is, thus, our only source of ideas. Moreover,\nthey reject the corresponding version of the Superiority of Reason\nthesis. Since reason alone does not give us any knowledge, it\ncertainly does not give us superior knowledge.  Empiricists need not\nreject the Indispensability of Reason thesis, but most of them do.\n\nThe main characteristic of empiricism, however, is that it endorses a\nversion of the following claim for some subject area:\n\nThe Empiricism Thesis: We have no source of knowledge in S or\nfor the concepts we use in S other than experience.\n\n\nTo be clear, the Empiricism thesis does not entail that we have\nempirical knowledge. It entails that knowledge can only be gained,\nif at all, by experience. Empiricists may assert, as some do\nfor some subjects, that the rationalists are correct to claim that\nexperience cannot give us knowledge. The conclusion they draw from\nthis rationalist lesson is that we do not know at all. This is,\nindeed, Hume's position with regard to causation, which, he argues, is\nnot actually known, but only presupposed to be holding true, in virtue\nof a particular habit of our minds.\n\nWe have stated the basic claims of rationalism and empiricism so that\neach is relative to a particular subject area. Rationalism and\nempiricism, so relativized, need not conflict. We can be rationalists\nin mathematics or a particular area of mathematics and empiricists in\nall or some of the physical sciences. Rationalism and empiricism only\nconflict when formulated to cover the same subject. Then the debate,\nRationalism vs. Empiricism, is joined. The fact that philosophers can\nbe both rationalists and empiricists has implications for the\nclassification schemes often employed in the history of philosophy,\nespecially the one traditionally used to describe the Early Modern\nPeriod of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries leading up to Kant.\nIt is standard practice to group the philosophers of this period as\neither rationalists or empiricists and to suggest that those under one\nheading share a common agenda in opposition to those under the other.\nThus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are the Continental Rationalists\nin opposition to Locke, Hume, and Reid, the British Empiricists. Such\ngeneral classification schemes should only be adopted with great\ncaution. The views of the individual philosophers are a lot more\nsubtle and complex than the simple-minded classification suggests.\n(See Loeb (1981) and Kenny (1986) for important discussions of this\npoint.) Locke rejects rationalism in the form of any version of the\nInnate Knowledge or Innate Concept theses, but he nonetheless adopts\nthe Intuition/Deduction thesis with regard to our knowledge of\nGod\u2019s existence, in addition to our knowledge of mathematics and\nmorality. Descartes and Locke have remarkably similar views on the\nnature of our ideas, even though Descartes takes many to be innate,\nwhile Locke ties them all to experience. The rationalist/empiricist\nclassification also encourages us to expect the philosophers on each\nside of the divide to have common research programs in areas beyond\nepistemology. Thus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are mistakenly seen\nas applying a reason-centered epistemology to a common metaphysical\nagenda, with each trying to improve on the efforts of the one before,\nwhile Locke, Hume, and Reid are mistakenly seen as gradually rejecting\nthose metaphysical claims, with each consciously trying to improve on\nthe efforts of his predecessors. It is also important to note that the\nrationalist/empiricist distinction is not exhaustive of the possible\nsources of knowledge. One might claim, for example, that we can gain\nknowledge in a particular area by a form of Divine revelation or\ninsight that is a product of neither reason nor sense experience. In\nshort, when used carelessly, the labels \u2018rationalist\u2019 and\n\u2018empiricist,\u2019 as well as the slogan that is the title of\nthis essay, \u2018Rationalism vs. Empiricism,\u2019 can impede\nrather than advance our understanding.\n\nAn important wrinkle for using this classification scheme in the\nhistory of philosophy is that it leaves out discussions of\nphilosophical figures who did not focus their efforts on understanding\nwhether innate knowledge is possible or even fruitful to have.\nPhilosophy in the early modern period, in particular, is a lot richer\nthan this artificial, simplifying distinction makes it sound. There is\nno clear way of grouping Hobbes with either camp, let alone Elizabeth\nof Bohemia, Anne Conway, George Berkeley, \u00c9milie du\nCh\u00e2telet, or Mary Shepherd. This distinction, initially applied\nby Kant, is responsible for giving us a very restrictive philosophical\ncanon, which does not take into account developments in the philosophy\nof emotions, philosophy of education, and even disputes in areas of\nphilosophy considered more mainstream, like ethics and aesthetics.\n\nUnless restricted to debates regarding the possibility of innate\nknowledge, this distinction is best left unused. The most interesting\nform of the debate occurs when we take the relevant subject to be\ntruths about the external world, the world beyond our own minds. A\nfull-fledged rationalist with regard to our knowledge of the external\nworld holds that some external world truths are and must be innate and\nthat this knowledge is superior to any that sense experience could\never provide. The full-fledged empiricist about our knowledge of the\nexternal world replies that, when it comes to the nature of the world\nbeyond our own minds, experience is our sole source of information.\nReason might inform us of the relations among our ideas, but those\nideas themselves can only be gained, and any truths about the external\nreality they represent can only be known, on the basis of experience.\nThis debate concerning our knowledge of the external world will\ngenerally be our main focus in what follows.\n\nHistorically, the rationalist/empiricist dispute in epistemology has\nextended into the area of metaphysics, where philosophers are\nconcerned with the basic nature of reality, including the existence of\nGod and such aspects of our nature as free-will and the relation\nbetween the mind and body. Several rationalists (e.g., Descartes,\nMeditations) have presented metaphysical theories, which they\nhave claimed to know by intuition and/or deduction alone. Empiricists\n(e.g., Hume, Treatise) have rejected the theories as either\nspeculation, beyond what we can learn from experience, or nonsensical\nattempts to describe aspects of the world beyond the concepts\nexperience can provide. The debate raises the issue of metaphysics as\nan area of knowledge. Kant puts the driving assumption clearly:\n\nThe very concept of metaphysics ensures that the sources of\nmetaphysics can\u2019t be empirical. If something could be known\nthrough the senses, that would automatically show that it\ndoesn\u2019t belong to metaphysics; that\u2019s an upshot of the\nmeaning of the word \u2018metaphysics.\u2019 Its basic principles\ncan never be taken from experience, nor can its basic concepts; for it\nis not to be physical but metaphysical knowledge, so it must be beyond\nexperience. (Prolegomena, Preamble, I, p. 7)\n\n\nThe possibility then of metaphysics so understood, as an area of human\nknowledge, hinges on how we resolve the rationalist/empiricist debate.\nThe debate also extends into ethics. Some moral objectivists (e.g.,\nRoss 1930 and Huemer 2005) take us to know some fundamental objective\nmoral truths by intuition, while some moral skeptics, who reject such\nknowledge (e.g., Mackie 1977), find the appeal to a faculty of moral\nintuition utterly implausible. More recently, the\nrationalist/empiricist debate has extended to discussions (e.g.,\nBealer 1999 and Alexander & Weinberg 2007) of the very nature of\nphilosophical inquiry: to what extent are philosophical questions to\nbe answered by appeals to reason or experience?\n",
