    "main_text": "Theories of Experience || Naive Realist Disjunctivism\n3.4 Naive Realist Disjunctivism\n3.4.1 Naive Realism in Outline\n\nConsider the veridical experiences involved in cases where you\ngenuinely perceive objects as they actually are. At Level 1, naive\nrealists hold that such experiences are, at least in part, direct\npresentations of ordinary objects. At Level 2, the naive realist holds\nthat things appear a certain way to you because you are directly\npresented with aspects of the world, and \u2013 in the case we are\nfocusing on \u2013 things appear white to you, because you are\ndirectly presented with some white snow. The character of your\nexperience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness manifesting\nitself in experience.\n\nNaive realists thus assign an important explanatory role to the world\nitself in explaining the character of veridical experiences. But this\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they are committed to the idea that such\ncharacter is fully explained or exhausted by the presented\nworld. Naive realists admit that even holding fixed presented aspects\nof the world there can be variation in the character of experience.\nThis is worked out in different (but compatible) ways by different\ntheorists. One approach is to note how variations in the\nperceiver can make for variations in the character of\nexperience (Logue (2012a)). Another is to highlight a\nthird-relatum (of the relation of presentation) which\nencapsulates various conditions of perception such as one\u2019s\nspatiotemporal perspective and the operative perceptual modality,\nwhere variation in such conditions can make for variation in\nphenomenal character (Campbell (2009), Brewer (2011)). Finally, some\nsuggest that there can be variation in the way or\nmanner in which one is related to perceived objects which\nmakes a difference to phenomenal character (Soteriou (2013), Campbell\n(2014), French and Phillips (2020)). For further discussion see French\n(2018).\n\nFor the naive realist, insofar as experience and experiential\ncharacter is constituted by a direct perceptual relation to aspects of\nthe world, it is not constituted by the representation of such aspects\nof the world. This is why many naive realists describe the relation at\nthe heart of their view as a non-representational relation.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that experiences must lack intentional\ncontent, but it means that (a) insofar as appeal is made to\npresentation to explain character, no appeal is made to intentional\ncontent for that purpose, and (b) what is fundamental to experience is\nsomething which itself cannot be explained in terms of representing\nthe world: a primitive relation of presentation. (For further\ndiscussion of naive realism as a non-representational view, see the\narticles in Part Three of Brogaard (2014)).\n\nThe other theories we have considered all endorse the Common\nKind Claim. We\u2019ve noted that naive realism applies to\nthe veridical experiences involved in genuine perception, but does it\napply more widely? Though naive realists may extend their approach to\nillusions, they typically deny that it applies to hallucinations and\nso reject the Common Kind Claim. Naive realists who\ndeny the Common Kind Claim are\ndisjunctivists. We call such a position naive realist\ndisjunctivism. Let\u2019s explore these ideas now.\n3.4.2 Naive Realism and the Problem of Perception\n\nThere are various different naive realist approaches to illusion (see\ne.g., Fish (2009: Chapter 6), Brewer (2008, 2011: Chapter 5), Kalderon\n(2011), Genone (2014), French and Phillips (2020)). When it comes to\nthe argument from illusion, the naive realist (like the\nintentionalist) rejects the Phenomenal Principle. So\nhow does naive realism differ from intentionalism about illusions? In\ntwo respects: first, naive realists can maintain that illusory\nexperiences are fundamentally direct presentations of the\nworld. Second, the naive realist can explain the character of such\nillusory experiences without appeal to intentional content, but\ninstead by appealing to the direct presentation of ordinary objects.\nConsider, for example, the approach developed by Brewer:\n\n\nvisually relevant similarities are those that ground and explain the\nways that the particular physical objects that we are acquainted with\nin perception look. That is to say, visually relevant similarities are\nsimilarities by the lights of visual processing of various kinds...\nvery crudely, visually relevant similarities are identities in such\nthings as the way in which light is reflected and transmitted from the\nobjects in question, and the way in which the stimuli are handled by\nthe visual system, given its evolutionary history and our shared\ntraining during development (2011: 103)... in a case of visual\nillusion in which a mind-independent physical object, o, looks F,\nalthough o is not actually F, o is the direct object of visual\nperception from a spatiotemporal point of view and in circumstances of\nperception relative to which o has visually relevant similarities with\nparadigm exemplars of F although it is not actually an instance of F\n(2011: 105).\n\n\nSo though o may not itself be F, it can exist in certain conditions,\nC, such that it has visually relevant similarities to paradigm F\nthings and in that sense it will objectively look F, or look like an F\nthing\u2014that is, it will itself have a property, a look or an\nappearance, independently of anyone actually seeing it (see also\nMartin (2010), Kalderon (2011), Antony (2011), and Genone (2014) on\nobjective looks). If o is then seen in C, o itself will look F to\nyou in perception. Brewer spells this all out in more detail,\nand with various examples. One is seeing a white piece of chalk as\nred. The chalk is seen in abnormal illumination conditions such that\nthe white piece of chalk itself looks like a paradigm red piece of\nchalk\u2014it has \u201cvisually relevant similarities with a\nparadigm piece of chalk, of just that size and shape\u201d (2011:\n106). Given that it is seen in those conditions, it looks red to you,\neven though it is not in fact red. Here, then, we have an account of\nillusions in which we appeal to objects and the ways those objects\nare, not the ways they are represented to be, in explaining\ncharacter.\n\nWhat about the argument from hallucination? The naive realist thinks\nthat at least veridical experiences are direct presentations of\nordinary objects. They thus reject the conclusion (C) of the argument.\nBut typically, naive realists accept (A). They therefore block the\nargument by rejecting the spreading step (B), understood in terms of\nthe Common Kind Claim applied to veridical and\nhallucinatory experiences.\n\nSuch a naive realist reasons as follows: suppose that when you see a\nsnow-covered churchyard for what it is, you have an experience which\nis in its nature a relation between you and ordinary objects. But a\nsubjectively indistinguishable hallucinatory experience does not have\nsuch a nature. For such a hallucination could occur in the absence of\nany relevant worldly items (e.g., in the lab of a scientist\nmanipulating your brain, in a world with no white things). Instead of\ntaking (B) and these facts about hallucination to ground the rejection\nof naive realism, the naive realist instead rejects (B): even though\nthe hallucination as of a snow-covered churchyard is subjectively\nindistinguishable from a veridical experience of such a scene, it is\nnot of the same fundamental kind. (For a more nuanced formulation of\nthe naive realist reasoning here, see Martin (2004), (2006). Raleigh\n(2014) and Ali (2018) advocate a na\u00efve realist position which\nkeeps the Common Kind Claim but rejects (A) and hence\nthe understanding of hallucinations we are operating with here. See\nalso Masrour (2020) who argues that it is an open question whether\nhallucinations are possible.).\n\nIn blocking the argument from hallucination in this way the naive\nrealist endorses disjunctivism. This theory was first\nproposed by Hinton (1973) and was later developed by P.F. Snowdon\n(1979, 1990), John McDowell (1982, 1987) and M.G.F. Martin (2002,\n2004, 2006). Disjunctivism is not best construed as it is by one of\nits proponents, as the view \u201cthat there is nothing literally in\ncommon\u201d in veridical perception and hallucination, \u201cno\nidentical quality\u201d (Putnam (1999: 152)). For both the veridical\nperception of an F and a subjectively indistinguishable hallucination\nof an F are experiences which are subjectively indistinguishable from\na veridical perception of an F. What disjunctivists deny is that what\nmakes it true that these two experiences are describable in\nthis way is the presence of the same fundamental kind of mental state.\nDisjunctivists reject what J.M. Hinton calls \u201cthe doctrine of\nthe \u2018experience\u2019 as the common element in a given\nperception\u201d and an indistinguishable hallucination (Hinton\n(1973: 71)). The most fundamental common description of both states,\nthen, is a merely disjunctive one: the experience is either a genuine\nperception of an F or a mere hallucination as of an F. Hence the\ntheory\u2019s name.\n3.4.3 The Development of Naive Realist Disjunctivism\n\nThe disjunctivist rejects the Common Kind Claim.\nUnderlying this is a rejection of what Martin (2004, 2006) calls the\n\u201ccommon kind assumption\u201d, namely:\n\n(CKA) whatever fundamental kind of mental event\noccurs when you veridically perceive, the very same kind of event\ncould occur were you undergoing a subjectively indistinguishable\nhallucination.\n\n\nBut is the disjunctivist\u2019s rejection of (CKA)\nplausible? The disjunctivist can note how the fact that a\nhallucination is subjectively indistinguishable from a veridical\nexperience does not entail that they are of the same\nfundamental kind, even if it does suggest this. \n\nHowever, some argue that even if such an appeal to subjective\nindistinguishability is not enough to establish\n(CKA), it is nonetheless well supported by a\ncausal argument (Robinson (1985)). We can suppose that when\nyou see the snow-covered churchyard for what it is, there is some\nproximal cause of this experience: the experience is preceded by a\ncertain sort of brain state B. But now we can imagine a situation in\nwhich we bring about B thus producing an experience in you, yet where\nB is not brought about through any interaction between you and a\nsnow-covered churchyard\u2014e.g., in laboratory conditions. In this\nscenario you have an hallucinatory experience as of a snow-covered\nchurchyard. It is plausible to suppose that these experiences are of\nthe very same kind given that they have the same proximal cause.\n\nThe point here is that (CKA) looks like a plausible\nprinciple for causally matching veridical and hallucinatory\nexperiences \u2013 veridical and hallucinatory experiences with the\nsame proximal cause. This way of motivating (CKA)\nappeals to a same-cause, same-effect principle:\n\nCausal Principle 1: an event e1 is of the same kind as an event e2\nif event e1 is produced by the same kind of proximate causal condition\nas e2 (Nudds 2009: 336).\n\n\nIs this the end of the road for the naive realist disjunctivist, then?\nNot quite, since as Martin argues, the naive realist should reject\nthis principle:\n\n\nOn [the naive realist] conception of experience, when one is\nveridically perceiving the objects of perception are constituents of\nthe experiential episode. The given event could not have occurred\nwithout these entities existing and being constituents of it; in turn,\none could not have had such a kind of event without there being\nrelevant candidate objects of perception to be apprehended. So, even\nif those objects are implicated in the causes of the experience, they\nalso figure non-causally as essential constituents of it... Mere\npresence of a candidate object will not be sufficient for the\nperceiving of it, that is true, but its absence is sufficient for the\nnon-occurrence of such an event. The connection here is [one] of a\nconstitutive or essential condition of a kind of event. (2004:\n56\u201357).\n\n\nMartin\u2019s point is that the naive realist may well admit the\npossibility of veridical experiences and causally matching\nhallucinations, but they will resist the idea that sameness of\nproximal cause implies sameness of the kind of experience involved.\nThis is because there are non-causal constitutive conditions\nfor the occurrence of the veridical experience which are not satisfied\nin the hallucinatory case.\n\nHowever, Martin suggests that the arguer from hallucination can\ndevelop their case against naive realism further. This development\ninvolves an argument with two stages. First, a modified causal\nargument: the reverse causal argument, and second the\nscreening-off problem. \n\nThe modified causal argument involves a modified causal principle:\n\nCausal Principle 2: an event e1 is of the same kind K as an event\ne2 if event e1 is produced by the same kind of proximate causal\ncondition as e2 in circumstances that do not differ in any non-causal\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of an event of kind K (Nudds\n2009: 337).\n\n\n(Martin\u2019s own modified causal principle is more complicated than\nthis in allowing for indeterministic causation. We gloss over this\nimportant complication here). Take N to be the fundamental kind which\ncharacterizes a veridical experience of a snow-covered churchyard,\naccording to the naive realist. Does Causal Principle 2 allow us to\nsay that N is present in the causally matching hallucinatory case, as\n(CKA) predicts? No. For the hallucination is produced\nin circumstances that differ in non-causal conditions necessary for\nthe occurrence of N given how the naive realist understands\nN: in the circumstances in which the hallucination occurs there\nis no appropriate object of perception, but the presence of such an\nobject is necessary for the occurrence of N.\n\nSo how does Causal Principle 2 help the arguer from hallucination? We\nhave to run an argument in \u201cthe reverse direction, from what\nmust be true of cases of causally matching hallucinations, to what\nmust thereby be true of the veridical perceptions they match\u201d\n(Martin 2006: 368). That is, take a hallucination as of a snow-covered\nchurchyard h, and suppose that h is of some fundamental kind H. Now we\ncan apply Causal Principle 2 to show that H is present in a causally\nmatching veridical experience of a snow-covered churchyard,\nv. For now v is produced by the same kind of proximal cause in\ncircumstances where there is no difference in the non-causal\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of an event of kind H. This is\nbecause all that is necessary for an occurrence of H is some brain\ncondition, which is present in the circumstances in which v is brought\nabout. This reverse causal argument does not show that v is not of\nfundamental kind N. What it does show, however, is that whatever\nfundamental kind is present in a hallucinatory case will also be\npresent in a causally matching veridical case. So even if v is\nfundamentally N it is also H. That is, we have the Reverse Common Kind\nAssumption:\n\n(RCKA) Whatever fundamental kind of event occurs\nwhen you hallucinate, the very same kind of event also occurs in a\ncausally matching veridical experience.\n\n\nBut now we run into the screening-off problem. There is\nsomething it is like for you to have an hallucinatory experience as of\na snow-covered churchyard, and the experience seems to relate you to a\nsnow-covered churchyard. This fact about the hallucinatory experience\nis grounded in its being of kind H. But now if an experience of that\nkind is present in the veridical case, it is difficult to see how what\nthe naive realist says is fundamental to that case, N, is doing\nanything by way of explaining what it is like for a subject to have\nthe experience. The presence of H in the veridical case seems to make\nN explanatorily redundant, or \u201cscreen off\u201d N\u2019s\nexplanatory role, contra the ambitions of naive realism. (For more\ndetailed expositions of this two-stage argument see Martin (2004),\nByrne and Logue, (2008), Hellie (2013) and Soteriou (2014: Chapter\n6)).\n\nThe most widely discussed naive realist response to this argument is\nthat of Martin (2004, 2006). Though there are now a range of different\nnaive realist responses available, some of which integrate critical\ndiscussion of Martin\u2019s own approach (see Allen (2015), Logue\n(2012b, 2013), Fish (2009: Chapter 4), Hellie (2013), Moran (2019),\nSethi (2020)).\n\nMartin argues that the screening-off stage of the argument is only\nproblematic if we accept a positive, non-derivative account of\ncausally matching hallucinations. On such an account, hallucinations\nhave a positive nature which doesn\u2019t derive from that of\nveridical perception: a nature that can be specified independently of\nany reference to veridical perception. For instance, hallucinations\nare direct presentations of sense-data, or representations of ordinary\nobjects. Instead, Martin suggests, the disjunctivist should conceive\nof causally matching hallucinations in a purely negative epistemic\nway: such a hallucination as of an F is a state of mind which is not\nintrospectively knowably not a veridical perception of an F. What\nmakes it the case that your hallucinatory experience is as of a\nsnow-covered churchyard, with a certain sort of phenomenal character,\nis just that it is an occurrence which cannot be discriminated, by\nintrospection alone, from a veridical perception of a snow-covered\nchurchyard. The particular subjective perspective that a hallucinator\nhas in a causally matching hallucination as of a snow-covered\nchurchyard is explained just by the obtaining of this negative\nepistemic condition, not by anything more positive such as a relation\nto a white sense-datum or the representation of white snow (c.f.,\nDancy (1995: 425)). On such a view, causally matching hallucinations\nare derivative: specifying their nature requires essential reference\nto the basic case of veridical perception.\n\nIf we accept Martin\u2019s account of causally matching\nhallucinations, then we can see how H can be present in both the\nhallucinatory and the veridical case: since trivially a veridical\nexperience of a snow-covered churchyard is indiscriminable from a\nveridical experience of a snow-covered churchyard. But what about\nscreening off? Does H have a nature which means that the presence of H\nin the veridical case threatens the explanatory power of N? It\ndoesn\u2019t, Martin argues, since H\u2019s explanatory force is\nderivative or dependent: it is parasitic on that of N. As Martin notes\nwith his own example:\n\n\nBut if that is so [if H screens off the explanatory role of N], then\nthe property of being a veridical perception of a tree [i.e. N] never\nhas an explanatory role, since it is never instantiated without the\nproperty of being indiscriminable from such a perception being\ninstantiated as well. But if the property of being a veridical\nperception lacks any explanatory role, then we can no longer show that\nbeing indiscriminable from a veridical perception has the explanatory\nproperties which would screen off the property of being a veridical\nperception (2004: 69).\n\n\nHere, then, is a summary of this complex dialectic: the argument\nfrom hallucination seems to disprove naive realism, but the naive\nrealist appeals to disjunctivism in response. However, the\ncausal argument puts pressure on disjunctivism, by supporting\nthe common kind assumption. In response, the naive realist\nrejects the key principle of this argument (Causal Principle 1). But\nthen a two-stage argument consisting of the reverse causal\nargument and the screening-off problem attempts to show\nthat: (1) the fundamental kind of experience present in hallucination\nis also present in causally matching veridical experience, and (2)\nthis undermines the naive realist idea that the character of veridical\nexperience is shaped by the directly presented world. In response,\nMartin accepts a form of naive realism which embraces disjunctivism\n(in the form of the claim that causally matching veridical and\nhallucinatory experiences are fundamentally different). But which also\naccepts (as per the reverse causal argument) that there is a common\nelement across the cases, for the hallucinatory kind is present in\nveridical cases too. But since he conceives of this common element in\na derivative, and purely negative epistemic way, he blocks the\nargument at the second stage, rejecting screening off.\n\nNaturally, then, much subsequent critical discussion has focused on\nMartin\u2019s negative epistemic conception of hallucination. Further\ndiscussion and development of Martin\u2019s approach is to be found\nin Nudds (2009, 2013) and Soteriou (2014: Chapter 6). For criticism of\nMartin\u2019s approach see Hawthorne and Kovakovich (2006), Farkas\n(2006), Sturgeon (2008), Siegel (2004, 2008), and Robinson (2013). See\nBurge (2005) for a general and polemical attack on disjunctivism. For\nmore on disjunctivism, see Haddock and Macpherson (eds.) (2008), Byrne\nand Logue (eds.) (2009), Macpherson and Platchias (eds.) (2013) and\nthe entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.\n3.4.4 Naive Realist Disjunctivism and Our Ordinary Conception of Perceptual Experience\n\nAccording to naive realist disjunctivists, at least veridical\nexperiences are directly of ordinary objects (Ordinary\nObjects), and are direct presentations of their objects\n(Presentation). Naive realist disjunctivists thus\nmaintain Direct Realist Presentation, and hence\nDirect Realism for at least veridical experiences\n\u2013 indeed they maintain Direct Realism without\nthe need for any appeal to a causal theory of direct perception.\nFurther, naive realist disjunctivists hold that the phenomenal\ncharacter of such experiences is determined, at least in part, by the\ndirect presentation of ordinary objects (Direct Realist\nCharacter). The only aspect of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience which naive realist disjunctivists reject\noutright is the Common Kind Claim.\n4. Conclusion\n\nSense-datum theorists and adverbialists depart substantially from our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience. Advocates of each view\nwill argue, in their different ways, that this is a consequence of\nresponding adequately to the Problem of Perception. \n\nIntentionalists and naive realist disjunctivists disagree, and argue,\nin different ways, that we can respond to the Problem of Perception\nwithout departing substantially from our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience: by maintaining Direct Realism\nin some form, and maintaining or at least being sensitive to many of\nthe specific phenomenological components of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience.\n\n\nWhilst the debate between sense-datum theorists and adverbialists (and\nbetween these and other theories) is not as prominent as it once was,\nthe debate between intentionalists and naive realist disjunctivists is\na significant ongoing debate in the philosophy of perception: a legacy\nof the Problem of Perception that is arguably \u201cthe greatest\nchasm\u201d in the philosophy of perception (Crane (2006)). The\nquestion, now, is not so much whether to be a direct realist,\nbut how to be one.",
