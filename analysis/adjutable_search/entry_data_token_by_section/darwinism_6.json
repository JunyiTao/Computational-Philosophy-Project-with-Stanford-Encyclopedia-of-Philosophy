    "main_text": "The Five Core Philosophical Problems Today || Selection, Adaptation and Teleology\n3.3 Selection, Adaptation and Teleology\n\n  Moreover, because Darwin was very fond of describing natural\nselection as a process that worked for the good of each species,\nDarwin\u2019s followers seemed to have diametrically opposed views as to\nwhether his theory eliminated final causes from natural science or\nbreathed new life into them. In either case, there was also serious\ndisagreement on whether this was a good thing or a bad\n thing.[8]\n\n2.3.4 Nominalism and Essentialism\n\n  There is a fundamental philosophical problem with the idea that a\nspecies can undergo a series of changes that will cause it to become\none or more other species.  To illustrate it, look carefully at the\nfirst question that Charles Lyell wishes to address in the second\nvolume of the Principles of Geology:\n\n \u2026first, whether species have a real and permanent existence in nature;\nor whether they are capable, as some naturalists pretend, of being\nindefinitely modified in the course of a long series of generations.\n(Lyell 1831, II. 1)\n\n\nLyell pretty clearly assumes that to allow for evolution is to deny\nthe reality of species. For a species to be \u2018real\u2019, it\nmust have \u2018permanent existence in nature\u2019, or as he puts\nit elsewhere , \u201c\u2026fixed limits beyond which the descendants from\ncommon parents can never deviate from a certain type\u2026\u201d. (Lyell\n1831, II. 23) To accept evolutionary change, on this view, you must\nbecome comfortable with a variety of nominalism about species. And\nDarwin seems to have become\n so.[9]\n\n\n\nHence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to\nthe systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step\ntowards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in\nworks on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any\ndegree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly\nmarked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading\nto sub-species, and to species. (Darwin 1859, 52)\n\n\nPermanence, as applied to species, is for Darwin a relative concept, and there are no fixed\nlimits to variability within a species. Given enough time the\nindividual differences found in all populations can give rise to more permanent and\nstable varieties, these to sub-species, and these to populations that\nsystematists will want to class as distinct species.  Moreover, he\nconcludes the Origin with very strong words on this topic,\nwords bound to alarm his philosophical readers:\n\nSystematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but\nthey will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this\nor that form be in essence a species. \u2026In short, we will have to treat\nspecies in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who\nadmit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for\nconvenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at\nleast be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and\nundiscoverable essence of the term species. (Darwin 1859, 485)\n\n\nLyell, Herschel, Whewell, Sedgwick and many of Darwin\u2019s contemporaries\ncertainly would not find this a cheering prospect, since they were\nunrepentant essentialists about\n species.[10]\n Members of a species possess a \u2018type\u2019 established in the\noriginal parents, and this type provides \u2018fixed limits\u2019 to\nvariability.  Lyell clearly feels this is an empirically verifiable\nfact\u2014most of chapters 2\u20134 of Principles Vol. II is\ndevoted to presenting the evidence that such \u2018fixed\nlimits\u2019 exist; and after the Origin\u2019s publication this\nevidence was canvassed again in Fleeming Jenkin\u2019s review.  If this is\nso, then species extinction is easy to account for\u2014there are\nfixed limits to a species\u2019 ability to track environmental\nchange.  But a naturalistic account of species origination is more\ndifficult, since there will need to be, in sexually reproducing\nspecies, a natural production of a new pair of parents with a new\ntype. On the other hand, to adopt the sort of nominalism that Darwin seems to be advocating in the above quotations has undesirable consequences as well. How\nare we to formulate objective principles of classification?  What sort\nof a science of animals and plants will be possible if there are no\nfixed laws relating their natures to their characteristics and\nbehaviors?  A good deal of chapter 2 of Darwin\u2019s Origin is\ndevoted to convincing the reader that current best practice among\nbotanists and zoologists accepts a natural world organized as he is\ninsisting rather than as his opponents claim:\n\nIt must be admitted that many forms, considered by highly competent\njudges as varieties, have so perfectly the character of species that\nthey are ranked by other highly competent judges as good and true\nspecies.  (Darwin 1859, 49)\n\n\nFrom a Darwinian perspective, this is a predictable consequence of the\nfact that the organisms we today wish to classify as species are merely the most\nrecent stage of a slow, gradual evolutionary process. Organisms within\na genus have common ancestors, perhaps relatively recent common\nancestors; some naturalists may see ten species with a few varieties\nin each; others may rank some of the varieties as species and divide the\nsame genus into twenty species. Both classifications may be done with the\nutmost objectivity and care by skilled observers. As systematists like\nto say, some of us are \u2018lumpers\u2019, some of us are\n\u2018splitters\u2019. Reality is neither.\n2.3.5 Tempo and Mode of Evolutionary Change\n\n  The question of nominalism versus realism regarding species points toward a final\naspect of Darwin\u2019s theory with which many of those otherwise\nsympathetic to him disagreed, his gradualism. For apart from the\nquestion of whether his views entailed \u2018nominalism\u2019 about\nnatural kinds, they do seem to reflect a belief that the evolutionary\nprocess must be a slow and gradual one. It is perhaps here that we see\nthe most lasting impact of Darwin\u2019s careful study of Charles Lyell\u2019s\nPrinciples of Geology while on H.M.S. Beagle. I stress slow\nand gradual, for it is clear that one could have a slow\nbut non-gradual evolutionary process (perhaps the long periods of\nevolutionary stasis punctuated by geologically rapid periods of\nspeciation postulated by Eldridge and Gould\u2019s \u2018punctuated\nequilibrium model\u2019 is such); and one could have a rapid but\ngradual one (for example the process George Gaylord Simpson\nlabeled \u2018adaptive radiation\u2019, where a population migrates\nto a location with a variety of unexploited niches, and rapidly\nevolves to exploit them). Darwin stresses over and over again that he\nconceives of natural selection \u2018adding up infinitely small\nvariations\u2019, and that he imagines the process of speciation to\ntake place over a very long period of time.\n\n\nOne of the strongest arguments for insisting that\n\u2018Darwinism\u2019 as it is used today is isomorphic to Darwin\u2019s\nDarwinism, as Gayon puts it, is that each of these questions is still\nhotly debated, and has been throughout the theory\u2019s history.  With all\nof the amazing changes that have been wrought by the genetic,\nbiochemical, and molecular revolutions, with the development of\nmathematical models of population genetics and ecology, of\nsophisticated techniques for both field and laboratory investigation\nof evolutionary processes, and of cladistic analysis in systematics,\nit nevertheless remains true that one can find evolutionary biologists\nwho adhere to Darwin\u2019s Darwinism, and are recognized as doing so by\nboth themselves and their critics.  In the next section of this\narticle, I will develop a portrait of contemporary Darwinism around\neach of these contested features. \n\n\nBy the same token, however, Darwinism has evolved.  As one example of\nthis truth, think for a moment of contemporary debates about the\nnature of selection. The problems people had with natural selection in\nthe 19th century continue to be problematic, but there are\na variety of problems that were either not discussed, or discussed\nvery differently, in the 19th century. Can, and does,\nnatural selection work at levels other than the level of Darwin\u2019s\nfocus, individual organisms; is there a non-vacuous way to formulate\nthe theory abstractly; how are we to understand the relationships\nbetween the concepts of fitness, selection and adaptation?  How strong\nare the constraints on the selection process, and what sorts of\nconstraints are there?  Are there other motors of evolutionary change\nbesides selection, and if so, how important are they?  In particular,\nhow important is \u2018drift\u2019, and how are we to differentiate\nit from selection?\n3. The Five Core Philosophical Problems Today\n\nTheories need both essences and histories.\nStephen Jay Gould (2002, 1)\n\n\n\nSo reads the heading of the very first section of the first chapter of\nGould\u2019s monumental The Structure of Evolutionary\nTheory. Opening with a subtle reading of an exchange of letters\nin 1863 between paleontologist Hugh Falconer and Charles Darwin, Gould\neventually explains what he has in mind by this section heading:\n\n In short, \u201cThe structure of evolutionary theory\u201d combines enough\nstability for coherence with enough change to keep any keen mind in a\nperpetual mode of search and challenge.  (Gould 2002, 6)\n\n\nGould, of course, was both an unabashed admirer of Charles Darwin and\none of the most outspoken critics of the \u2018neo-Darwinian\nsynthesis\u2019.  I will be using both his account of \u2018the\nEssence of Darwinism\u2019 in Part I of this magnum opus and his\narguments for a \u2018Revised and Expanded Evolutionary Theory\u2019\nin its Part II as touchstones and targets.\n\n\nIn the preceding section of this essay, I organized my discussion of\nthe problems that Darwin\u2019s allies had with Darwin\u2019s Darwinism\naround five issues: [i] the role of chance as a factor in evolutionary\ntheory and the theory\u2019s apparently probabilistic nature; [ii] the\nnature of selection; [iii] the question of whether\nselection/adaptation explanations are teleological; [iv] the\nontological status of species and the epistemological status of\nspecies concepts; and [v] the implications of Darwin\u2019s insistence on\nthe slow and gradual nature of evolutionary change. I claimed that one\nvery good reason for continuing to characterize one dominant approach\nto evolutionary biology, that represented by the so-called\n\u2018Neo-Darwinian Synthesis\u2019, as \u2018Darwinism\u2019 is\nthat its proponents side with Darwin on these issues (and on many less\nfundamental ones besides). That in itself is remarkable, but it is the\nmore so because the Darwinian position on each of these issues is\nunder as much pressure from non-Darwinian evolutionary biologists\ntoday as it was in the wake of the Origin. It is not\nsurprising, given the situation as I have just characterized it, that historians and\nphilosophers of biology have made significant contributions to the\ndiscussion, especially in pointing out the underlying philosophical issues\n and conceptual confusions and ambiguities that stand\nin the way of resolving the issues at hand, and their historical origins.\n\n\nIt is my conviction that a full understanding of the underlying\nphilosophical disagreements on these questions will only come from a\npatient historical study of how the \u2018Synthesis\u2019 positions\non these various issues, and those of their critics, arose. That I\ncannot do here. Rather, in what follows I will simply be presupposing\ncertain answers to these questions of historical origins.  The list of\nreferences at the end of this essay includes a number of excellent\npieces of work on this subject for those who share my convictions\nabout its importance.\n3.1 The Roles of Chance in Evolutionary Theory\n\n\nThe evolutionary process, as Darwin understood it, involves the\ngeneration of variation and a process producing a\ndifferential perpetuation of variation.  One simple way to\nthink about Darwinism in relation to a logical space of alternatives,\nthen, is by means of the following variation grid:\n\nVariations\n\nGeneration Perpetuation\nFitness\u00a0Biased\nLamarckAsa Gray DarwinAsa Gray\nNot\u00a0Fitness\u00a0Based\nDarwinNeutralism LamarckNeutralism\n\n\n\nThe above grid might lead you to conclude that both non-fitness\nbiased generation of variation and non-fitness\nbiased perpetuation of variation would be properly labeled\n\u2018chance.\u2019 By seeing why that would be a misleading\nconclusion to draw, we get to the heart of the problem of the concept\nof \u2018chance\u2019 in contemporary Darwinism. \n\n\nLet us begin with the language Darwin uses when he first sketches his\ntheory at the beginning of the fourth chapter of the\nOrigin:\n\n Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations\nuseful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful\nin some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life,\nshould sometimes occur in the course of thousands of\ngenerations?  If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many\nmore individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals\nhaving any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the\nbest chance of surviving and of procreating their kind?  (Darwin\n1859, 80\u201381)\n\n\nUnlike Darwin\u2019s contemporaries, the founders of the synthesis of\nMendelian genetics and Darwinian selection theory, Sewall Wright,\nRonald Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane, were entirely comfortable with a\nselection theory formulated in such terms. On this issue, contemporary\nDarwinism agrees whole-heartedly with Charles Darwin.  Note one clear\nstatement of the Principle of Natural Selection from the\nphilosophical literature:\n\n If a is better adapted than b to their mutual\nenvironment E, then (probably) a will have greater\nreproductive success than b in E.  (Brandon1990,\n11).\n\n\nThe theory trades pervasively in probabilities. To take a simple case:\nif there are three possible combinations of alleles at a given locus\nin a population, we can characterize the outcome of a reproductive\ncycle as \u2018chance\u2019 if each of the three possible\ncombinations occurs at a frequency determined strictly by the laws of\nprobability. In any given case of reproduction, we would say, which\ngenotype emerged is a matter of chance.  Given the fact that\nevolutionary biologists, especially in so far as they take their cues\nfrom population genetics, deal with large populations conceived as\n\u2018gene pools\u2019, and think of evolution as long run changes\nin the frequencies of different combinations of genes from generation\nto generation, it is clear that, in this sense, chance permeates\ncontemporary Darwinism.  The models of population biology provide a\nmeans of assigning probabilities to various outcomes, given\ninformation about population size, rates of mutation and migration\n(themselves given as averages and estimates). That is, as Darwin\nnotes, being relatively better adapted increases an organism\u2019s\n\u2018chances\u2019, i.e. increases its probability, of leaving\nviable offspring.  It does not guarantee it.  Since natural selection\nis a stochastic process, Darwinians from Darwin to the present rightly\ncharacterize it in terms of influencing the \u2018chances\u2019 of a\ngiven outcome, given variables such as selection pressure, population\nsize or mutation rates.\n\n\nConceptual confusion arises, however, from the fact that\n\u2018chance\u2019 and \u2018randomness\u2019 are often\ncontrasted, not with \u2018deterministic\u2019 outcomes but with\n\u2018selected\u2019 outcomes. For example, when John Beatty\ndescribes \u2018random drift\u2019 as \u2018changes in frequencies\nof variations due to chance\u2019 in the following passage, he\npresumably has something like a contrast with changes in frequencies\ndue to selection in mind.\n\n In Darwin\u2019s scheme of things, recall, chance events and natural\nselection were consecutive rather than alternative stages of the\nevolutionary process. There was no question as to which was more\nimportant at a particular stage. But now that we have the concept of\nrandom drift taking over where random variation leaves off, we are\nfaced with just such a question. That is, given chance variations, are\nfurther changes in the frequencies of those variations more a matter\nof chance or more a matter of natural selection?  (Beatty 1984,\n196)\n\n\nNotice that in the above quote we first get a substitution of\n\u2018random\u2019 for \u2018chance\u2019 in the phrases\n\u2018random variation\u2019 and \u2018chance variation\u2019, and\nthen at least the suggestion that the concept of \u2018random\ndrift\u2019 can be characterized as \u2018changes in frequencies of\nvariations due to chance\u2019, where the contrast class consists of similar\nchanges due to natural selection. \n\n\nWith respect to the generation of variation, chapter 5 of\nOn the Origin of Species opens with the following\napology:\n\n I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations\u2014so common\nand multiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser\ndegree in those in a state of nature\u2014had been due to\nchance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it\nserves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each\nparticular variation. (Darwin 1859, 131)\n\n\nHere Darwin is noting that, though to speak of \u2018chance\nvariations\u2019 may seem to be citing chance as the cause of the\nvariations, in fact it is simply acknowledging that they \u2018appear\nto have no assignable cause\u2019.  But it is important to keep\nhistorical context in mind here. Whether Darwin himself ever flirted\nwith the idea of \u2018directed\u2019 variation or not, he was\nacutely aware of two views from which his needed to be\ndistinguished, very different from each other, but both holding to the\nview that variations arose for a\n purpose.[11]\n The most widely shared alternative was that found in natural\ntheology. To quote the Reverend William Paley\u2019s Natural\nTheology, regarding a beautiful instance of adaptation: \u201cA\nconformation so happy was not the gift of chance\u201d.  Likewise,\namong Darwin\u2019s followers, the American botanist Asa Gray, in an essay\nentitled \u2018Natural Selection and Natural Theology\u2019, uses\nthe same contrast to advise Darwin against the notion of\n\u2018chance variation\u2019: \u201c\u2026we should advise\nMr. Darwin to assume, in the philosophy of his hypothesis, that\nvariation has been led along certain beneficial lines.\u201d\n\n\nGray is here insisting that, since Darwin admits that using the term\n\u2018chance\u2019 merely signals ignorance of the true cause, and\nsince the pervasive adaptations in nature suggest design, Darwin\nshould avoid the suggestion that variations are due to chance in\nthe sense of \u2018absence of\n design\u2019.[12]\n\n\n\nDarwin, in fact never refers to \u2018chance variations\u2019 in the\nOrigin, though occasionally he will note that if a beneficial\nvariation \u2018chances [i.e. happens] to appear\u2019, it will be\nfavored by selection (see pp. 37, 82) What Darwin has in mind,\nhowever, is clear from his concluding remarks in his chapter on\nLaws of Variation:\n\n Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring\nfrom their parents\u2014and a cause of each must exist\u2014it is\nthe steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such\ndifferences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all\nthe more important modifications of structure\u2026\u201c (Darwin 1859,\n170)\n\n Whatever the cause of the generation of a variation may be,\nthe role of selection is to accumulate those already present\nvariations that happen to be beneficial. As Beatty put it, the\ngeneration of variations and their selection are\n\u2018consecutive\u2019 processes.  But to call the generation of\nvariation a \u2018chance\u2019 process is to use\n\u2018chance\u2019 in this second sense, meaning not by design, not\nfor some end.\n\n\nApart from those urging Darwin to give up chance in favor of design,\nhe had pressure to abandon chance from another direction, the\nevolutionary philosophy of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck\u2019s is a\nmaterialistic argument against the variation in nature being\na matter of chance. On the Lamarckian view, variations arise in an\norganism as a direct response to environmental stress or demand,\ngiving rise to a stimulus, which in turn elicits a physiological\nresponse, which finally can be passed on via reproduction to\noffspring.  Variations are not chance or random, since they are an\nappropriate response to an environmental stress.  Here\n\u2018chance\u2019 signals a lack of relation or connection to\nadaptive needs, an idea akin to, but ontologically quite distinct\nfrom, the contrast between \u2018chance\u2019 and\n\u2018design\u2019. \n\n\nThe concept of \u2018random variation\u2019 is today often used as a\nsynonym for \u2018chance variation\u2019 in precisely this latter\nsense. Here are two examples of this notion of chance or randomness as used by\ncontemporary Darwinians.\n\n \u2026mutation is a random process with respect to the adaptive\nneeds of the species.  Therefore, mutation alone, uncontrolled by\nnatural selection, would result in the breakdown and eventual\nextinction of life, not in adaptive or progressive\nevolution. (Dobzhansky 1970, 65) \n\n\nThus the production of variations may be a \u2018chance\u2019\nprocess in that there are a number of possible outcomes with\nassignable probabilities, but it is also a\n\u2018chance\u2019 process in the sense that the probability\nassignments are not biased by \u2018adaptive needs\u2019 or\n\u2018fitness\u2019.\n\n\nMy second example is intended to take us back to problems with our\nfirst sense of \u2018random\u2019 and \u2018chance\u2019. Here,\na champion of the neutral theory of molecular evolution\ncharacterizes his position:\n\n \u2026the great majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular\n(DNA) level do not result from Darwinian natural selection acting on\nadvantageous mutants but, rather, from random fixation of selectively\nneutral or very nearly neutral mutants through random genetic drift,\nwhich is caused by random sampling of gametes in finite\npopulations. (Kimura 1992, 225)\n\n\nHere, it will be noticed, the focus is not on the generation\nof variations but on the perpetuation of variations.  The\ncontrast is between a random sampling of gametes that leads to the\nfixation of selectively neutral alleles and natural selection favoring\nadvantageous variations.  That is, the contrast between\n\u2018chance\u2019 and \u2018fitness biased\u2019 processes is now\nbeing used to distinguish different means of perpetuating certain\nvariations. We are contrasting two sampling processes. Drift\nsamples without concern for adaptation; selection samples\ndiscriminately on the basis of differences in fitness. Both samplings\nare \u2018probabilistic\u2019, of course, but that in no way\nobviates the above contrast.\n\n\nHowever, as Beatty has pointed out, it was quite common until fairly\nrecently to characterize natural selection in such a way as to make it\nalmost indistinguishable from random drift (cf. Lennox 1992, Lennox\nand Wilson 1994).  Numerous accounts of fitness characterized the\nfitness of a genotype as defined by its relative contribution to the\ngene pool of future generations\u2014the genotype contributing the\nlarger percentage being the fitter.  But of course that could easily\nbe the result of a \u2018random\u2019\u2014non-fitness biased\u2014sampling process; which organisms would be declared\n\u2018fitter\u2019 by this method might have nothing to do with\nnatural selection. In order to provide a proper characterization of\nthe role of chance in evolutionary change, then, it is critical to\nprovide a more robust and sophisticated account of fitness. (For \nfurther information, see the entry on\n   fitness.) \n This, in turn, requires that we discuss the conceptual network that\nincludes the notions of adaptation and natural selection, to which we\nwill turn shortly.  \n\n\nFor now, let us assume that there is a way of characterizing fitness\nsuch that there is a substantial empirical question of what role\nindiscriminate sampling of genotypes (or phenotypes) plays in\nevolutionary change.  This issue was first placed squarely before\nevolutionary biologists by Sewall Wright in the early 1930s. As Wright\npointed out, genes that are neutral with respect to fitness can, due\nto the stochastic nature of any process of sampling from a population,\nincrease their representation from one generation to the next. The\nlikelihood of this happening goes up as effective population size goes\ndown. Since Wright imagined that a quite typical scenario in\nevolutionary change was for species to be broken up into relatively\nsmall, relatively isolated, populations (or \u2018demes\u2019), with\nsignificantly more breeding within than between demes, the likelihood\nthat such \u2018neutral genotypes\u2019 could become fixed at\nrelatively high levels was significant. Though he gradually toned down\nthis aspect of his work, a significant school of mathematical\npopulation geneticists in the 1960s and 70s took these ideas and ran\nwith them, developing a \u2018Neutralist\u2019 approach to\nevolutionary change.  This is the position characterized by Kimura\n(one of its most eloquent defenders) in the passage quoted\nabove. Whether or not such a process plays a significant role in\nevolution is not a philosophical issue, but it is highly relevant to\nwhether evolutionary biology should be seen as predominantly\nDarwinian. For if any view is central to Darwinism, it is that the\nevolutionary process is predominantly guided by the fitness-biasing\nforce of natural selection, acting on variations that arise by chance.\nIt is to natural selection and related concepts that we now turn.\n3.2 The Nature, Power and Scope of Selection\n\n The greatest number of females will, of course, fall to the share of\nthe most vigorous males; and the strongest individuals of both sexes,\nby driving away the weakest, will enjoy the best food, and the most\nfavourable situations, for themselves and for their offspring. A\nsevere winter, or a scarcity of food, by destroying the weak and the\nunhealthy, has had all the good effects of the most skilful\nselection.\n\n\nThe words of Charles Darwin?  No; these are the words of John\nSebright, penned in The Art of Improving the Breeds of Domestic\nAnimals in 1809, the year of Charles Darwin\u2019s birth and fifty\nyears before On the Origin of Species was published. Darwin\nrefers to this passage in Notebook C of his Species\n Notebooks.[13]\n  It will be noticed that Sebright is not discussing domestic\nselection, but is quite clearly saying that processes leading to\ndifferential survival and reproduction in nature will have \u2018all\nthe good effects of the most skilful selection\u2019. Darwin, then,\ndid not need to read Malthus to see what is here so plainly and\nclearly stated\u2014namely, that the struggle for survival in nature\nwill have the same \u2018selective\u2019 effects as the actions of\nthe domestic breeder of plants and animals.  \n\n\nAs this passage, and the argument of the Origin, shows,\n\u2018natural selection\u2019 began life as the product of\nanalogical reasoning.  Sebright sees clearly that the natural\nprocesses he is describing will have the same effects as the\nbreeder\u2019s selection, but he is not about to describe those processes\nas selection processes. Darwin took that step, and Darwinism has\nfollowed.  \n\n\nDarwin himself consistently refers to natural selection as a power\nof preserving advantageous, and eliminating harmful,\nvariations. As noted in the last section, whether a particular\nvariation is advantageous or harmful is, in once sense of that term, a\nmatter of chance; and whether an advantageous variation is actually\npreserved by selection is, in another sense of the term, also a matter\nof chance. For Darwinism, selection is the force or power that biases\nsurvival and reproduction in favor of advantageous variations, or to\nlook ahead to the next section, of adaptations. It is this that\ndistinguishes selection from drift.\n\n\n In a recent monograph entitled Natural Selection: Domains, Levels\nand Challenges in the Oxford Series in Ecology and\nEvolution, George C. Williams has vigorously defended\nDarwinian selection theory against a variety of challenges\nthat have emerged over the last few decades. Those challenges can be\nplaced into two broad categories: [i] proposed limitations on\nnatural selection as an evolutionary force; and [ii]\nexpansions of the scope of natural selection to include new\n\u2018targets\u2019 and \u2018levels\u2019. It will be noted that\nin neither case is it obvious that the theory itself requires\nmodification in the face of such challenges\u2014in principle these\nmight be nothing more than challenges to the theory\u2019s range of\napplication.  However, if it turned out that most\nevolutionary change could be explained without recourse to natural\nselection, this would be grounds for arguing that evolutionary biology\nwas no longer Darwinian. And if it turned out that the theory of\nnatural selection could only be integrated with our new\nunderstanding of the processes of inheritance and development by a\nwholesale modification of its foundations, it might be best to see the\nnew theory as a modified descendent of Darwinism, rather than\nDarwinism itself. Theories may need essences, as Gould claims; but if\nwhat is fundamental to the theory has changed, then so has its\nessence. To borrow a phrase from Paul Griffiths, perhaps it is not\nthat theories need histories and essences\u2014perhaps what\nthey need are historical essences.\n\n\nAlfred Russell Wallace regularly urged Darwin to jettison the term\n\u2018selection\u2019 as misleadingly anthropomorphic, and\nsubstitute Herbert Spencer\u2019s \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019.\nDarwin went half way\u2014in later editions he added \u2018or\nSurvival of the Fittest\u2019 to \u2018Natural Selection\u2019 in\nthe title of chapter 4. As the theory developed in the\nmid-20th century, the expression \u2018survival of the\nfittest\u2019 was gradually eliminated from any serious\npresentation of Darwinian selection theory. On the other hand, the\nconcept of \u2018fitness\u2019 has played a prominent, and\nproblematic, role. In the mathematical models used in\npopulation genetics, \u2018fitness\u2019 refers either\nto the abilities of the different genotypes in a population to leave\ndescendants, or to the measures of those abilities, represented by the\nvariable W. Here is a rather standard textbook\npresentation of the relevant concepts:\n\n In the neo-Darwinian approach to natural selection that incorporates\nconsideration of genetics, fitness is attributed to particular\ngenotypes.  The genotype that leaves the most descendants is ascribed\nthe fitness value W=1, and all other genotypes have\nfitnesses, relative to this, that are less than 1.  \u2026 Fitness\nmeasures the relative evolutionary advantage of one genotype over\nanother, but it is often important also to measure the relative\npenalties incurred by different genotypes subject to natural\nselection. This relative penalty is the corollary of fitness and is\nreferred to by the term selection coefficient. It is given\nthe symbol s and is simply calculated by subtracting the\nfitness from 1, so that: s = 1 \u2212 W. (Skelton\n1993 164) \n\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that the concept of fitness plays dual\nroles that are instructively conflated in this quotation. For when\nfitnesses are viewed as measures of differential abilities of organisms\nwith different genotypes to leave different numbers of offspring, the\nlanguage of fitness encourages us to suppose that\n\u2018fitness\u2019 refers to the relative selective advantages of\ngenotypes.  On the other hand, if \u2018fitness\u2019 simply refers\nto the measure of reproductive success, it is a quantitative\nrepresentation of small scale evolutionary change in a population, and\nleaves entirely open the question of the causes of the\nchange.  But then the assumed connections among the concepts of\nfitness, adaptation and natural selection are severed.\n\u2018Selection coefficients\u2019 may have nothing to do with\nselection; what W represents may have nothing to do with\nselective advantage.\n\n\nThere is, however, a way of formulating the theory in its modern guise\nwhich maintains an essentially Darwinian character.  Since there are a\nnumber of confirmed ways in which natural populations can evolve in\nthe absence of natural selection, and since balancing selection,\ni.e. countervailing selection forces, may prevent a population from\nevolving in its presence, it is clear that establishing, by measuring\ndifferent reproductive rates among its members, that the genetic\nmake-up of a population has changed does not establish that natural\nselection was the source of that change; nor does the fact that no\nchange has been measured establish that natural selection is not\noperative.  Population genetics and its associated models should be\ntreated as the \u2018kinematics\u2019, not the\n\u2018dynamics\u2019 of evolutionary processes. That is, it is a way\nof establishing that a population either is or is not in equilibrium,\nand it provides sophisticated tools for measuring rates of change in a\npopulation across generations. Moreover, like the kinematics of any\nphysical theory, if it establishes cross-generational change, it also\ntells us that there are causes to be found\u2014the detailed contours\nof those measures may even provide suggestions as to where to look for\nthose causes. What it cannot do on its own is provide\nknowledge of the forces at work.  To use language introduced by\nElliott Sober, fitness, unlike natural selection, is causally\ninert. (For further information, see the entry on\n  population genetics.) \n\n\nThat means that, as valuable as population genetics is, it should not\nbe equated with the theory of natural selection. Too often in both\nbiological presentations of the theory and philosophical discussions\nof it, this is forgotten.  For example:\n\n  Most people are familiar with the basic theory of natural selection.\nOrganisms vary in a heritable fashion. Some variants leave more\noffspring than others; their characteristics, therefore, are\nrepresented at a greater frequency in the next generation.  (Wilson\n1984, 273)\n\n\nThis is a presentation of \u2018the basic theory of natural\nselection\u2019 that makes no reference to natural selection at all!\n\n\n\nNatural selection, if it is to resemble the Darwinian concept that\nbears that name, must be reserved for reference to an interaction\nbetween a variable, heritable feature of an organic system and the\nenvironment of that system. That interaction may or may not\nchange the proportions of those features across generations, and those\nproportions may change for reasons other than those interactions. But\na plausible natural selection hypothesis must posit some such\ninteraction. On this issue I\nwill give the last word to Stephen Jay Gould:\n\n \u2026when we consider natural selection as a causal process, we\ncan only wonder why so many people confused a need for measuring the\nresults of natural selection by counting the differential increase of\nsome hereditary attribute (bookkeeping) with the mechanism that\nproduces relative reproductive success (causality).\u201d (Gould 2003,\n619)\n The concept of natural selection has to this point been presented\nbroadly because of the other two critical questions surrounding\nthe contemporary Darwinian concept of natural selection that I\nmentioned earlier\u2014questions having to do with possible limiting\nconstraints on natural selection and about the sorts of objects that\ncan be viewed as appropriate organismic/environmental\n\u2018interactors\u2019 in the selection process.\n\nIf we suppose that for Darwin natural selection was almost exclusively\nthought of as an interaction between individual organisms and their\norganic and inorganic environments, then we can see two challenges to\nDarwinism today with respect to levels of selection.  There\nare those, such as G. C. Williams and Richard Dawkins, who argue that\nselection is always and only of genes. Here is a clear statement:\n\n These complications [those introduced by organism/environment\ninteractions] are best handled by regarding individual [organismic]\nselection, not as a level of selection in addition to that of the\ngene, but as the primary mechanism of selection at the genic level.\n(Williams 1993, 16)\n\n\nDawkins\u2019 preferred mode for making the same point is to refer to\norganisms\u2014or interactors--as the vehicles of their\ngenes, in fact vehicles constructed by the genome for its own\nperpetuation. \n\n\nThe original impulse for this approach, especially clear in\nWilliams\u2019 classic Adaptation and Natural Selection\n(1966) was philosophical\u2014it was to use a sort of Ockham\u2019s razor\nstrategy against Group Selection hypotheses, showing that alleged\ngroup selection effects could be explained by explanations operating\nat the level of the genome.  Throughout that book selection is always\nsaid to be of individual alleles, regardless of the role environments\nat various levels may play in the process. \n\n\nThis view has been extensively challenged by philosophers of biology\non both methodological and conceptual grounds, though there are, among\nphilosophers, enthusiastic supporters (cf. Dennett 1995). In all the\ngive and take, it is seldom noticed that defenders of this view claim\nto be carrying the Darwinian flag (Gayon 1998 and Gould 2003 are\nexceptions). Yet it is certainly not a position that Darwin\nwould recognize--and not merely because he lacked a coherent theory of\nthe units of inheritance. It is not a Darwinian view because for\nDarwin it was differences in the abilities of organisms at various\nstages of development to respond to the challenges of life that had\ncausal primacy in the explanation of evolutionary change. Among\nevolutionary biologists from the \u2018neo-Darwinian synthesis\u2019\non, it is those who stress the role of organisms in populations\ninteracting differentially to ever-variable ecological conditions in\ncausing changes in the gene pools of those populations who are the\ncard-carrying Darwinians. \n\n\n Darwinism also has challenges from the opposite direction.  In the\n1970s a number of biologists working in the fields of paleontology and\nsystematics challenged the Neo-Darwinian dogma that you could account\nfor \u2018macro-evolution\u2019 by means of long term extrapolation\nfrom micro-evolution.  Gould, in particular, opens Part II of The\nStructure of Evolutionary Theory (Towards a Revised and\nExpanded Evolutionary Theory), with a chapter entitled\n\u2018Species as Individuals in the Hierarchical Theory of\nSelection\u2019.  That chapter title combines two conceptually\ndistinct theses: first, the thesis defended by Michael Ghiselin\n(Ghiselin 1997) and championed and refined by David Hull (Hull 2001),\nthat species are, in a robust sense of the term,\n\u2018individuals\u2019; and second, that there may well be\nselection among groups of organisms, qua groups. Gould\u2019s\ntitle exemplifies one approach to group selection\u2014the unit of\nselection is always the individual, but there are individuals other\nthan individual organisms that are subject to selection.  A very\ndifferent result emerges if one assumes that groups of organisms such\nas demes, kin-groups, or species, though not individuals, are\nnevertheless subject to selection. Adding to the conceptual\ncomplexity, some researchers propose that the term \u2018group\nselection\u2019 be restricted to the process whereby group-level\ntraits provide advantages to one group over another, in which case\nthere are strict conditions delimiting cases of group\nselection. Others define group selection primarily in terms of group\nlevel effects. Thus a debate analogous to that earlier\ndiscussed regarding the definitions of \u2018fitness\u2019 emerges\nhere\u2014by group selection do we mean a distinct type of causal\nprocess that needs to be conceptually distinguished from selection at\nthe level of individual organism or gene, or do we merely mean a tendency\nwithin certain populations for some well defined groups to displace\nothers over time?  (For further discussion, see Sterelny and Griffiths\n1999, 151\u2013179; Hull 2001, 49\u201390; and see the entry on:\n levels and units of selection.)\n3.3 Selection, Adaptation and Teleology\n\n Early in the Introduction to On the Origin of Species,\nDarwin observes that the conclusion that each species had descended\nfrom others \u201ceven if well founded, would be unsatisfactory,\nuntil it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this\nworld have been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure\nand co-adaptation which most justly excites our admiration\u201d\n(Darwin 1859, 3). One might say this was the central promise of\nDarwinism\u2014to account for both phylogenic continuity and\nadaptive differentiation by means of the same principles; or as Darwin\nputs it, to integrate in one theory the supposed opposition between\nUnity of Type and Conditions of Existence.\n\n\nBut it is here that even the most sympathetic of Darwin\u2019s theistic\nsupporters were forced to qualify their support for the theory of\ndescent with modification by means of natural selection.  In Darwin\u2019s\nday the reactions of Asa Gray and John Herschel are perhaps the most\ninteresting in this respect.  Both men saw in Darwin\u2019s theory a way to\naccount for \u2018that mystery of mysteries,\u2019 the regular\nappearance of new species by means of natural, or as they might say,\n\u2018intermediate\u2019 causes.  However both instinctively\nrecoiled from the irreducible and central role of \u2018chance\u2019\nin the theory.  They did not, but easily could have, said \u2018God\ndoes not play dice with the universe.\u2019 But as Darwin stated\nrepeatedly, if gently, to Gray\u2014if God ordained that variations\nshould be along beneficial lines, natural selection would be\nredundant. Moreover, the evidence from the study of variation in\ndomestic and natural populations put the lie to any claim that God\ndirects all or most variation along beneficial lines. Darwinian\nselection theory is a two-step process\u2014the production of\nvariation unrelated to the adaptive requirements of the organism, and\ndifferential perpetuation of those variations that serve adaptive\nneeds. Again, a theory of evolution that could not be so described\nwould not be a Darwinian theory.\n\n\nThe nature of \u2018selection explanations\u2019 is a topic to which\nmuch philosophical attention has been devoted in recent years. Here I\nwant to focus on only one important question\u2014to what extent is\nthe teleological appearance of such explanations simply that, an\nappearance masking a causal process in which goals play no role?\n\n\nThe appearance of teleology is certainly present in Darwinian\nexplanations, and has been since Darwin spoke of natural selection\nworking solely for the good of each being. The appearance of\nteleology stems from the ease with which both evolutionary biology and\ncommon sense take it for granted that animals and plants have the\nadaptations they do because of some benefit or advantage to\nthe organism provided by those adaptations. \n\n\nThis is a hotly contested question, and I will here simply sketch a\ncase that selective explanations of adaptations are robustly\nteleological. The interested reader may want to refer to the\nliterature on this question referred to in the discussion and listed\nin the list of readings provided at the end of this entry. A question\nI think not worth discussing is whether the word\n\u2018teleology\u2019 should be replaced by\n\u2018teleonomy\u2019. Etymologically, they come to the same thing;\nand the philosophical arguments given in favor of the change all rest\non an historically doubtful assumption\u2014that philosophical\ndefenses of teleology have always been either theistic or\nvitalistic. The serious philosophical issue can be put simply and\ndirectly: in selection explanations of adaptations, are the functions\nserved by adaptations a central and irreducible feature of the explanans in such\nexplanations?  If the answer is yes, the explanations are\n teleological.[14]\n\n\nA good place to begin is with a simple, yet realistic, example. In\nresearch carried out over many years and combining painstaking field\nwork and laboratory experimentation, John Endler was able to\ndemonstrate that the color patterns of males in the guppy populations\nhe was studying in rivers feeding into the southern Caribbean were a\nconsequence of a balance between mate selection and predator\nselection. To take one startling example, he was able to test and\nconfirm a hypothesis that a group of males, with a color pattern that\nmatched that of the pebbles on the bottoms of the streams and ponds\nthey populated except for bright red spots, have that pattern because\na common predator in those populations, a prawn, is color blind for\nred. Red spots did not put their possessors at a selective\ndisadvantage, and were attractors for mates (Endler 1983,\n173\u2013190). We may refer to this pattern of coloration as a\ncomplex adaptation that serves the functions of predator avoidance and\nmate attraction.  But what role do those functions play in explaining\nwhy it is that the males in this population have the coloration they\ndo?\n\n\nThis color pattern is an adaptation, as that term is used in\nDarwinism, only if it is a production of natural selection (Williams\n1966 261; Brandon 1985; Burian 1983). In order for it to be a product\nof natural selection, there must be an array of color variation\navailable in the genetic/developmental resources of the species wider\nthan this particular pattern but including this pattern. Which factors\nare critical, then, in producing differential survival and\nreproduction of guppies with this particular pattern?  The answer\nwould seem to be the value-consequences this pattern has compared to\nothers available in promoting viability and reproduction.  In popular\nparlance (and the parlance favored by Darwin), this color pattern is\ngood for the male guppies that have it, and for their male\noffspring, and that is why they have it (Binswanger 1990; Brandon\n1985; Lennox 2002). This answer strengthens the \u2018selected\neffects\u2019 or \u2018consequence etiology\u2019 accounts of\nselection explanations by stressing that selection ranges\nover value differences.  The reason for one among a number of\ncolor patterns having a higher fitness value has to do with\nthe value of that pattern relative to the survival and\nreproductive success of its possessors. \n\n\nSelection explanations are, then, a particular kind of teleological\nexplanation, an explanation in which that for the sake of\nwhich a trait is possessed, its valuable consequence,\naccounts for the trait\u2019s differential perpetuation and maintenance in\nthe population.\n",
