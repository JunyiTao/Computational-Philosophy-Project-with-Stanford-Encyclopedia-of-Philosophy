    "main_text": "Superluminal signaling\n7. Superluminal signaling\n\n\nWhether or not the non-locality predicted by quantum theories may be\nclassified as action at a distance or superluminal causation, the\nquestion arises as to whether this non-locality could be exploited to\nallow superluminal (i.e., faster-than-light) signaling of information.\nThis question is of particular importance for those who interpret\nrelativity as prohibiting any such superluminal signaling. (We shall\nreturn to discuss this interpretation in section 10.)\n\n\nSuperluminal signaling would require that the state of nearby\ncontrollable physical objects (say, a keyboard in my computer)\nsuperluminally influence distant observable physical phenomena (e.g. a\npattern on a computer screen light years away). The influence may be\ndeterministic or indeterministic, but in any case it should cause a\ndetectable change in the statistics of some distant physical\nquantities.\n\n\nIt is commonly agreed that in quantum phenomena, superluminal\nsignaling is impossible in practice. Moreover, many believe that such\nsignaling is excluded in principle by the so-called \u2018no-signaling\ntheorem\u2019 (for proofs of this theorem, see Eberhard 1978,\nGhirardi, Rimini and Weber 1980, Jordan 1983, Shimony 1984, Redhead\n1987, pp. 113-116 and 118). It is thus frequently claimed with respect\nto EPR/B experiments that there is no such thing as a Bell telephone,\nnamely a telephone that could exploit the violation of the Bell\ninequalities for superluminal signaling of\n information.[31]\n\n\nThe no-signaling theorem demonstrates that orthodox quantum\nmechanics excludes any possibility of superluminal signaling in the\nEPR/B experiment. According to this theory, no controllable physical\nfactor in the L-wing, such as the setting of the L-measurement\napparatus, can take advantage of the entanglement between the systems\nin the L- and the R-wing to influence the statistics of the measurement\noutcomes (or any other observable) in the R-wing. As we have seen in\nsection 5.1.1, the orthodox theory is at best incomplete. Thus, the\nfact that it excludes superluminal signaling does not imply that other\nquantum theories or interpretations of the orthodox theory also exclude\nsuch signaling. Yet, if the orthodox theory is empirically adequate, as\nthe consensus has it, its statistical predictions obtain, and\naccordingly superluminal signaling will be excluded as a matter of\nfact; for if this theory is empirically adequate, any quantum theory\nwill have to reproduce its statistics, including the exclusion of any\nactual superluminal signaling.\n\n\nBut the no-signaling theorem does not demonstrate that superluminal\nsignaling would be impossible if orthodox quantum mechanics were not\nempirically adequate. Furthermore, this theorem does not show that\nsuperluminal signaling is in principle impossible in the quantum realm\nas depicted by other theories, which actually reproduce the\nstatistics of orthodox quantum mechanics but do not prohibit in theory\nthe violation of this statistics. In sections 7.2-7.3, we shall\nconsider the in-principle possibility of superluminal signaling in\ncertain collapse and no-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics.\nBut, first, we need to consider the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor superluminal signaling.\n",
