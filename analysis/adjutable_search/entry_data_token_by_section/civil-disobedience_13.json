Far from undermining the\nrule of law or destabilizing society, civil disobedience could\nstrengthen the social and legal order. Civil disobedience can have a\njustice-enhancing value: it can serve \u201cto inhibit departures\nfrom justice and to correct them when they occur\u201d (Rawls 1999,\n336). Equally, it can have a legitimacy-enhancing function, with some\nthinkers conceiving of civil disobedience as \u2018the guardian of\nlegitimacy\u2019 (Habermas 1985, 103). Both ideas deem the practice\nof civil disobedience to be a valuable component of the public\npolitical culture of a near-just constitutional democratic society.\nHabermas even took the state\u2019s treatment of civil disobedience\nas a \u2018litmus test\u2019 for the maturity of the political\nculture of a constitutional democracy: \u201cEvery constitutional\ndemocracy that is sure of itself considers civil disobedience as a\nnormalized \u2013 because necessary \u2013 component of its\npolitical culture\u201d (Habermas 1985, 99).\n\nWhile Habermas\u2019s account resembles Rawls\u2019s liberal\napproach in many ways, its distinctive deliberative strand has also\ninfluenced democracy-based accounts, which defend the justification\nand role of civil disobedience on the basis of its contribution to\ndemocracy. Deliberative democrats (Markovits 2005; Smith 2013, ch.\n1\u20133), republican democrats (Arendt 1972), and radical democrats\n(Celikates 2014, 2016) focus on the potential of civil disobedience to\nenhance democratic legitimacy and to constitute in itself a form of\ndemocratic empowerment. Agents engaged in civil disobedience can\nenhance democratic legitimacy in a number of ways, including by\nputting a heretofore-neglected issue on the political agenda and\nraising awareness about its stakes; contributing to and informing\ndemocratic deliberation; highlighting the outsize influence of\npowerful players and the exclusionary effects of certain processes of\npublic deliberation, and working to make the latter more inclusive.\nCivil disobedience does not only aim to invigorate democratic\nsovereignty, but also can constitute a form of democratic empowerment\nin itself \u2013 an exercise of political agency that is especially\nmeaningful for marginalized groups. Through civil disobedience,\nindividuals discover and realize their power. They work together and\nforge bonds of solidarity. They engage in democratic politics.\nTheorists\u2019 examples to illustrate democratic civil disobedience\ninclude: the Occupy Movement, pro-democracy movements around the\nworld, anti-globalization and anti-austerity protests, climate justice\nactivism, and Campesino movements for land redistribution and agrarian\nreform. Many activists further enact within their movement the norms\nand values that guide their struggles, for instance through radical\ninclusion, direct democratic decision-making, aspiration to consensus,\nand leaderless organizational structures. Some theorists insist on the\nneed to align the means of protest with its aims, by deploying only\npersuasive, non-violent forms of protest that reflect democratic\nideals (Habermas 1997, 383\u20134; M. Cooke 2016), while others\ncontend that civil disobedience can be confrontational and coercive\nwithout betraying its democratic aims (Smith 2021; Fung 2005,\n409).\n\nA third approach to the value of civil disobedience, besides the\nliberal and democratic lenses, comes from the political realist\nperspective. Robert Jubb (2019) critiques Rawlsian accounts of civil\ndisobedience for the binary theory of political authority they rest\non: they take the whole political order to be either legitimate or\nillegitimate, and thereby ignore or deny the possibility that a regime\nmay be authoritative in virtue of having a democratic mandate, yet\nfail to protect everyone\u2019s basic liberties or to treat all its\nmembers as equals, for example. Jubb proposes instead to\n\u201cdisaggregate\u201d political authority, that is, to\ndistinguish between the different forms of authority which a political\norder may possess or lack, in order to make sense of the conditions\nunder which different forms of protest and resistance may be\nappropriate. Other realists criticize both liberal and deliberative\ndemocratic perspectives for their deductive, top-down approach to\nmoral analysis, their quest for rational consensus, and their\nassumption that people can be persuaded by rational arguments alone\n(Sabl 2001, 2021; Mantena 2012). Realist accounts of civil\ndisobedience stress instead \u201cthe ubiquity of moral disagreement\nand the permanence of political conflict\u201d (Sabl 2021, 153).\nAndrew Sabl, for instance, envisions civil disobedience as a properly\n\u2018political technology\u2019 (2021, 165), situated between\nsubmission and revolution, through which agents seek to effect change\nin the basic allocation of burdens and benefits by raising costs for\nadversaries, but without undermining the state\u2019s basic functions\nsuch as its provision of public goods.\n\nFor her part, Mantena debunks the common understanding of Gandhi and\nKing as committed in principle and absolutely to non-violence, showing\nthat their endorsement of non-violence reflected concerns of political\nefficacy. They considered political violence to be\n\u201cfutile\u201d, that is, ineffective for social change and\nlikely to bring about \u201cdangerous and perverse consequences in\npolitics\u201d (Mantena 2018, 84). In Gandhi\u2019s view, violence\nwould cultivate the wrong kind of independence for India and breed the\nwrong kind of polity, amounting to a mere change of personnel in a\nviolent state and generating unstable conditions. Mantena identifies\n\u201cthree faces of nonviolent action\u201d, which we can reframe\nas realists\u2019 account of the triple value of civil disobedience:\n1) morally, civil disobedience is the right means by which oppressed\npeople can regain dignity and self-respect; 2) strategically, it is a\nnecessary means to just and stable political results and future\ndemocratic concord; and 3) tactically, the dramatization of civil\ndisobedients\u2019 discipline works effectively to persuade\nopponents. Recent social scientific research has corroborated the\neffectiveness of non-violence in campaigns of civil resistance, which\nseek to topple dictatorships or colonial powers (Chenoweth and Stephan\n2011; Schock 2015).\n\nMany democratic theorists incorporate political realism in their\napproach as they strive to think about and \u201clearn from the\nstreets\u201d (Celikates 2014), in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach\ndesigned to understand particular contemporary protest movements. This\napproach constitutes a stark departure from \u201ctop-down\u201d\nliberal approaches like Rawls\u2019s and Dworkin\u2019s that require\nagents justify their disobedient protest before engaging in it. As\nAlexander Livingston puts it, many democratic and critical theorists\ntoday seek to draw \u201ctheoretical insights from protest movements\nthemselves around the globe rather than legislating moral guidelines\nfor activist praxis from the sidelines\u201d (\u00c7\u0131dam et al\n2020, 540). Guy Aitchison sees this as a central feature of the\n\u2018new civil disobedience debate\u2019, in which scholars seek to\nrespond to \u2018a new era of political protest and unrest\u2019\ncharacterized by \u201cthe proliferation and intensification of\noppositional political action by groups challenging economic\ninequality, racist policing, immigration enforcement, austerity, war,\nclimate change, financial oligarchy, privatization, and corporate\ndomination of cyberspace\u201d (Aitchison 2018b, 5, 7\u20138)\n\u2013 which theorists tend to be in broad sympathy with. Such\nbottom-up approach also diverges from David Lefkowitz\u2019s and\nKimberley Brownlee\u2019s defenses of a moral right to civil\ndisobedience that applies impartially to all acts of civil\ndisobedience, justified or not (see 4.2).\n",
