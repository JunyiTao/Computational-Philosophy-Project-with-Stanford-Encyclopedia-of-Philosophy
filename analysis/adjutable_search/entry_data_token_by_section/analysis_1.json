    "main_text": "General Introduction || Characterizations of Analysis\n1.1 Characterizations of Analysis\n\n\nIf asked what \u2018analysis\u2019 means, most people today \nimmediately think of breaking something down into its components; and\nthis is how analysis tends to be officially characterized. In the \nConcise Oxford Dictionary, for example, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 is defined as the \u201cresolution into \nsimpler elements by analysing (opp. synthesis)\u201d, the \nonly other uses mentioned being the mathematical and the \npsychological \n [Quotation].\n And in the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 is defined as \u201cthe process of breaking a\nconcept down into more simple parts, so that its logical structure is\ndisplayed\u201d \n [Quotation].\n The restriction to concepts and the reference to displaying \n\u2018logical structure\u2019 are important qualifications, but the\ncore conception remains that of breaking something down.\n\n\nThis conception may be called the decompositional conception\nof analysis (see \n Section 4).\n But it is not the only conception, and indeed is arguably neither the\ndominant conception in the pre-modern period nor the conception that \nis characteristic of at least one major strand in \n\u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy. In ancient Greek thought, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 referred primarily to the process of working \nback to first principles by means of which something could then be \ndemonstrated. This conception may be called the regressive \nconception of analysis (see \n Section 2).\n In the work of Frege and Russell, on the other hand, before the \nprocess of decomposition could take place, the statements to be \nanalyzed had first to be translated into their \u2018correct\u2019 \nlogical form (see \n Section 6).\n This suggests that analysis also involves a transformative \nor interpretive dimension. This too, however, has its roots \nin earlier thought (see especially the supplementary sections on \n Ancient Greek Geometry\n and \n Medieval Philosophy).\n \n\n\nThese three conceptions should not be seen as competing. In actual \npractices of analysis, which are invariably richer than the accounts \nthat are offered of them, all three conceptions are typically \nreflected, though to differing degrees and in differing forms. To \nanalyze something, we may first have to interpret it in some way, \ntranslating an initial statement, say, into the privileged language \nof logic, mathematics or science, before articulating the relevant \nelements and structures, and all in the service of identifying \nfundamental principles by means of which to explain it. The \ncomplexities that this schematic description suggests can only be \nappreciated by considering particular types of analysis.\n\n\nUnderstanding conceptions of analysis is not simply a matter of \nattending to the use of the word \u2018analysis\u2019 and its \ncognates\u2014or obvious equivalents in languages other than \nEnglish, such as \u2018analusis\u2019 in Greek or \n\u2018Analyse\u2019 in German. Socratic definition is \narguably a form of conceptual analysis, yet the term \n\u2018analusis\u2019 does not occur anywhere in \nPlato's dialogues (see \n Section 2\n below). Nor, indeed, do we find it in Euclid's \nElements, which is the classic text for understanding \nancient Greek geometry: Euclid presupposed what came to be known as \nthe method of analysis in presenting his proofs \n\u2018synthetically\u2019. In Latin, \n\u2018resolutio\u2019 was used to render the Greek word \n\u2018analusis\u2019, and although \n\u2018resolution\u2019 has a different range of meanings, it is \noften used synonymously with \u2018analysis\u2019 (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Renaissance Philosophy).\n In Aristotelian syllogistic theory, and especially from the time of \nDescartes, forms of analysis have also involved \n\u2018reduction\u2019; and in early analytic philosophy it was \n\u2018reduction\u2019 that was seen as the goal of philosophical \nanalysis (see especially the supplementary section on \n The Cambridge School of Analysis).\n \n\n\nFurther details of characterizations of analysis that have been \noffered in the history of philosophy, including all the classic \npassages and remarks (to which occurrences of \n \u2018[Quotation]\u2019\n throughout this entry refer), can be found in the supplementary \ndocument on\nDefinitions and Descriptions of Analysis.\n\n\nA list of key reference works, monographs and collections can be \nfound in the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a71.\n",
