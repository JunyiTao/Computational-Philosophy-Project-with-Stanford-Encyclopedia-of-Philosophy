    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of science || Reduction and causation\n2.9 Reduction and causation\n\nMechanistic explanation is non-causal, and so is reductive\nexplanation. However, sometimes, reductionist models are phrased in\ncausal terminology. En\u00e7 (1976) is a case in point. He describes\nreductive explanation and reductive dependence as causal. The\ndescription he gives of this relation, however, does not fit the usual\nuse of the term \u2018causation\u2019. En\u00e7 describes it as a\n\u2018generative\u2019 relation that may hold between an object\na and an object b even if a=b. Hence,\ndespite the fact that he uses the term \u2018causation\u2019, he\nshould not be interpreted as stating that literally, reductive\nexplanation is causal explanation. This has been overlooked by\nSchaffner (1993) who reflects upon En\u00e7\u2019s description,\ncriticizing him for assuming that reduction is causation.\n",
