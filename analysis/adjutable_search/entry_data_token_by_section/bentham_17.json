    "main_text": "Administration, Government, Constitutional Law || Public Opinion Tribunal\n9.3 Public Opinion Tribunal\n\nBased on his earlier enunciation of \u201cthe motto of the good\ncitizen\u201din A Fragment on\nGovernment\u2014\u201cTo obey punctually, to\ncensure freely\u201d (1776 [1977, 399])\u2014in the\nConstitutional Code Bentham conceived the POT as a\n\u201cfictitious tribunal\u201d or public court of opinion,\nargument, and debate. \u201cAble rulers lead it\u201d, he advised,\n\u201cprudent rulers use or follow it; foolish rulers disregard\nit\u201d. The POT would scrutinize the actions of elected\nrepresentatives, public and judicial officials, prosecuting charges\nwhere they are found remiss in their responsibilities, censoring\nmisrule and imposing penalties when applicable. Penalties would\ngenerally take the form of the \u201cmoral sanction\u201d\u2014the\nbroadcasting of the shame and disgrace of bad conduct and the\nimputation of the reputation of the person responsible (1830 [1983b,\n35\u201339]; 1989, 283). In these terms, the POT would be the leading\nsecurity against the misuse and abuse of power (1989, 125). Operating\non a continuing basis, and therefore not constrained as a check in the\nsame limited way as periodic elections, it would act as \u201cthe\nonly force \u2026 [by] which \u2026 government when operating in a\nsinister direction can experience any the least impediment to its\ncourse\u201d (1990, 121).\n\nVital to the functioning of the POT is the dissemination of\ninformation. In the first instance this would require the\nestablishment of a public archive of government actions and activities\ncontaining records of law, policy, legislative debate, and statistics,\nwhich the government would be constitutionally required to make\navailable to the public by a freedom of information provision in the\nconstitutional code to ensure transparency. Secondly, it would require\nan unshackled press to ensure widespread publicity and the freedom to\ncriticize unimpeded by censorship or gagging orders. Here Bentham drew\nupon his essay On the Liberty of the Press, and Public\nDiscussion (1821) to point out the dangers of laws designed to\nlimit these liberties. The liberty of the press is an indispensable\ncheck on arbitrary government, and therefore \u201cnecessary to the\nmaintenance of good government\u201d (1838\u201343, II, 277, 279).\nPublicity is vital in this process, since \u201cthe greater the\nnumber of the members of the whole community to whom the existence of\nan act of oppression has been made known, the greater is the number of\nthose by whom \u2026 not only may obedience be withholden, but\nresistance opposed\u201d (1990, 30).\n\nBentham did not consider that the effectiveness of the POT as a check\non misrule could be undermined by secret government methods to limit\nthe flow of information, nor did it occur to him that a press\ndominated by the views of one class or by special interests could\nsubvert the veracity of the information it disseminated. He pinned his\nfaith on transparency and publicity (Postema 2014, 49). Ideally, the\npublic would be adequately informed, and the POT would be constituted\nby those among the public who were both knowledgeable and concerned\nabout the issues before it. Its judgements could change as new\nevidence came to light or as new arguments were enunciated, and it\ncould be fragmented or unified in its view in proportion to the\nvariety of individual opinions expressed.\n",
