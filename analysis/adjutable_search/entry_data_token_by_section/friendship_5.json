    "main_text": "Value and Justification of Friendship || Individual Value\n2.1 Individual Value\n\nOne way to construe the question of the value of friendship is in\nterms of the individual considering whether\u00a0to be (or continue to\nbe) engaged in a friendship: why should I invest considerable time,\nenergy, and resources in a friend rather than in myself? What makes\nfriendship worthwhile for me, and so how ought I to evaluate whether\nparticular friendships I have are good friendships or not?\n\nOne sort of answer is that friendship is instrumentally good. Thus,\nTelfer (1970\u201371) claims that friendship is \u201clife\nenhancing\u201d in that it makes us \u201cfeel more\nalive\u201d\u2014it enhances our activities by intensifying our\nabsorption in them and hence the pleasure we get out of them\n(239\u201340). Moreover, she claims, friendship is pleasant in itself\nas well as useful to the friends. Annis (1987) adds that it helps\npromote self-esteem, which is good both instrumentally and for its own\nsake.\n\nYet friendship is not merely instrumentally valuable, as is hinted at\nby Annis\u2019 claim that \u201cour lives would be significantly\nless full given the universal demise of friendship\u201d (1987, 351).\nCooper (1977b), interpreting Aristotle, provides two arguments for why\nthis might be so. First, Cooper\u2019s Aristotle claims, living well\nrequires that one know the goodness of one\u2019s own life; however,\ngiven the perpetual possibility of self-deception, one is able\naccurately to evaluate one\u2019s own life only through friendship,\nin which one\u2019s friend acts as a kind of mirror of one\u2019s\nself. Hence, a flourishing life is possible only through the epistemic\naccess friendship provides. Second,\u00a0Cooper\u2019s Aristotle\nclaims that the sort of shared activity characteristic of friendship\nis essential to one\u2019s being able to engage in the sort of\nactivities characteristic of living well \u201ccontinuously\u201d\nand \u201cwith pleasure and interest\u201d (310). Such activities\ninclude moral and intellectual activities, activities in which it is\noften difficult to sustain interest without being tempted to act\notherwise. Friendship, and the shared values and shared activities it\nessentially involves, is needed to reinforce our intellectual and\npractical understanding of such activities as worthwhile in spite of\ntheir difficulty and the ever present possibility that our interest in\npursuing them will flag. Consequently, Cooper concludes, the shared\nactivity of friendship is partly constitutive of human flourishing.\nSimilarly, Biss (2019) argues along Kantian lines that friendship and\nthe sort of trust friendship involves, are a central and necessary\npart of the pursuit of moral self-perfection.\n\nSo far these are attempts to understand the value of friendship to the\nindividual in terms of the way friendship contributes, instrumentally\nor constitutively, to something else that is valuable to the\nindividual. Yet one might also think that friendship is valuable for\nits own sake. Schoeman (1985), partly in response to the individualism\nof other accounts of the value of friendship, claims that in\nfriendship the friends \u201cbecome a unique community with a being\nand value of its own\u201d (280): the intimacy of friendship results\nin \u201ca way of being and acting in virtue of being united with\nanother\u201d (281). Although this claim has intuitive appeal,\nSchoeman does not clearly explain what the value of that \u201cunique\ncommunity\u201d is or why it should have that value. Indeed, we ought\nto expect that fleshing out this claim would involve a substantive\nproposal concerning the nature of that community and how it can have a\nseparate (federated?\u2014cf. Friedman 1998) existence and value.\nOnce again, the literature on shared intention and plural subjecthood\nis relevant here; see, for example, Gilbert 1989, 1996, 2000; Tuomela\n1984, 1995; Searle 1990; and Bratman 1999.\n\nA question closely related to this question of the value of friendship\nis that of what justifies my being friends with this person rather\nthan with someone else or no one at all. To a certain extent, answers\nto the question of the value of friendship might seem to provide\nanswers to the question of the justification of friendship. After all,\nif the value of friendship in general lies in the way it contributes\n(either instrumentally or constitutively) to a flourishing life for\nme, then it might seem that I can justify particular friendships in\nlight of the extent to which they contribute to my flourishing.\nNonetheless, this seems unacceptable because it suggests\u2014what is\nsurely false\u2014that friends are\n fungible.\n (To be fungible is to be replaceable by a relevantly similar\nobject without any loss of value.) That is, if my friend has certain\nproperties (including, perhaps, relational properties) in virtue of\nwhich I am justified in having her as my friend (because it is in\nvirtue of those properties that she contributes to my flourishing),\nthen on this view I would be equally justified in being friends with\nanyone else having relevantly similar properties, and so I would have\nno reason not to replace my current friend with someone else of this\nsort. Indeed, it might even be that I ought to \u201ctrade up\u201d\nwhen someone other than my current friend exhibits the relevant\nfriendship-justifying properties to a greater degree than my friend\ndoes. This is surely objectionable as an understanding of\nfriendship.\n\nIn solving this problem of fungibility, philosophers have typically\nfocused on features of the historical relationship of friendship (cf.\nBrink 1999, quoted above). One approach might be found in\nSherman\u2019s 1987 union account of friendship discussed above (this\ntype of view might be suggested by the account of the value of\nfriendship in Schoeman 1985). If my friend and I form a kind of union\nin virtue of our having a shared conception of how to live that is\nforged and maintained through a particular history of interaction and\nsharing of our lives, and if my sense of my values and identity\ntherefore depends on these being most fundamentally our values and\nidentity, then it is simply not possible to substitute another person\nfor my friend without loss. For this other person could not possibly\nshare the relevant properties of my friend, namely her\nhistorical relationship with me. However, the price of this solution\nto the problem of fungibility, as it arises both for friendship and\nfor love, is the worry about autonomy raised towards the end of\nSection 1.2 above.\n\nAn alternative solution is to understand these historical, relational\nproperties of my friend to be more directly relevant to the\njustification of our friendship. Thus, Whiting (1991) distinguishes\nthe reasons we have for initiating a friendship (which are, she\nthinks, impersonal in a way that allows for fungibility) from the\nreasons we have for sustaining a friendship; the latter, she suggests,\nare to be found in the history of concern we have for each other.\nHowever, it is unclear how the historical-relational properties can\nprovide any additional justification for friendship beyond that\nprovided by thinking about the value of friendship in general, which\ndoes not solve the fungibility problem. For the mere fact that this is\nmy friend does not seem to justify my continued friendship:\nwhen we imagine that my friend is going through a rough time so that\nhe loses those virtues justifying my initial friendship with him, why\nshouldn\u2019t I just dump him and strike up a new friendship with\nsomeone who has those virtues? It is not clear how the appeal to\nhistorical properties of my friend or our friendship can provide an\nanswer.\n\nIn part the trouble here arises from tacit preconceptions concerning\nthe nature of justification. If we attempt to justify continued\nfriendship in terms of the friend\u2019s being this particular\nperson, with a particular historical relationship to me, then it seems\nlike we are appealing to merely idiosyncratic and subjective\nproperties, which might explain but cannot justify that friendship.\nThis seems to imply that justification in general requires the appeal\nto the friend\u2019s being a type of person, having general,\nobjective properties that others might share; this leads to the\nproblem of fungibility. Solving the problem, it might therefore seem,\nrequires somehow overcoming this preconception concerning\njustification\u2014a task which no one has attempted in the\nliterature on friendship.\n\n(For further discussion of this problem of fungibility as it arises in\nthe context of love, as well as discussion of a related problem\nconcerning whether the object (rather than the grounds) of love is a\nparticular person or a type of person, see Section 6 of the entry on\n love.)\n",
