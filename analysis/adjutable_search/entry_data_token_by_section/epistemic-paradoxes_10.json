    "main_text": "Anti-expertise || Moore\u2019s problem\n5.3 Moore\u2019s problem\n\nChurch\u2019s referee report was composed in 1945. The timing and\nstructure of his argument for unknowables suggests that Church may\nhave been inspired by G. E. Moore\u2019s (1942, 543) sentence:\n\n(M)\nI went to the pictures last Tuesday, but I don\u2019t believe that I did.\n\n\n\nMoore\u2019s problem is to explain what is odd about declarative\nutterances such as (M). This explanation needs to encompass both\nreadings of (M): \u2018\\(p \\amp B{\\sim}p\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(p\n\\amp{\\sim}Bp\\)\u2019. (This scope ambiguity is exploited by a popular\njoke: Ren\u00e9 Descartes sits in a bar, having a drink. The\nbartender asks him if he would care for another. \u201cI think\nnot,\u201d he says, and disappears. The joke is commonly criticized\nas fallacious. But it is not given Descartes\u2019 belief that he is\nessentially a thinking being.)\n\nThe common explanation of Moore\u2019s absurdity is that the speaker\nhas managed to contradict himself without uttering a contradiction. So\nthe sentence is odd because it is a counterexample to the\ngeneralization that anyone who contradicts himself utters a\ncontradiction.\n\nThere is no problem with third person counterparts of (M). Anyone else\ncan say about Moore, with no paradox, \u2018G. E. Moore went to the\npictures last Tuesday but he does not believe it\u2019. (M) can also\nbe embedded unparadoxically in conditionals: \u2018If I went to the\npictures last Tuesday but I do not believe it, then I am suffering\nfrom a worrisome lapse of memory\u2019. The past tense is fine:\n\u2018I went to the picture shows last Tuesday but I did not believe\nit\u2019. The future tense, \u2018I went to the picture shows last\nTuesday but I will not believe it\u2019, is a bit more of a stretch\n(Bovens 1995). We tend to picture our future selves as better\ninformed. Later selves are, as it were, experts to whom earlier selves\nshould defer. When an earlier self foresees that his later self\nbelieves \\(p\\), then the prediction is a reason to\nbelieve \\(p\\). Bas van Fraassen (1984, 244) dubs this\n\u201cthe principle of reflection\u201d: I ought to believe a\nproposition given that I will believe it at some future time.\n\nRobert Binkley (1968) anticipates van Fraassen by applying the\nreflection principle to the surprise test paradox. The student can\nforesee that he will not believe the announcement if no test is given\nby Thursday. The conjunction of the history of testless days\nand the announcement will imply the Moorean sentence:\n\n(A\u2032)\n The test is on Friday but you do not believe it.\n\n\nSince the less evident member of the conjunction is the announcement,\nthe student will choose not to believe the announcement. At the\nbeginning of the week, the student foresees that his future self may\nnot believe the announcement. So the student on Sunday will not\nbelieve the announcement when it is first uttered.\n\nBinkley illuminates this reasoning with doxastic logic (\u2018doxa\u2019 is\nGreek for belief). The inference rules for this logic of belief can be\nunderstood as idealizing the student into an ideal reasoner. In\ngeneral terms, an ideal reasoner is someone who infers what he ought\nand refrains from inferring any more than he ought. Since there is no\nconstraint on his premises, we may disagree with the ideal reasoner.\nBut if we agree with the ideal reasoner\u2019s premises, we appear\nbound to agree with his conclusion. Binkley specifies some\nrequirements to give teeth to the student\u2019s status as an ideal\nreasoner: the student is perfectly consistent, believes all the\nlogical consequences of his beliefs, and does not forget. Binkley\nfurther assumes that the ideal reasoner is aware that he is an ideal\nreasoner. According to Binkley, this ensures that if the ideal\nreasoner believes p, then he believes that he will believe \\(p\\)\nthereafter.\n\nBinkley\u2019s account of the student\u2019s hypothetical epistemic\nstate on Thursday is compelling. But his argument for spreading the\nincredulity from the future to the past is open to three\nchallenges.\n\nThe first objection is that it delivers the wrong result. The student\n\\(is\\) informed by the teacher\u2019s announcement, so Binkley ought\nnot to use a model in which the announcement is as absurd as the\nconjunction \u2018I went to the pictures last Tuesday but I do not\nbelieve it\u2019.\n\nSecond, the future mental state envisaged by Binkley is only\nhypothetical: \\(If\\) no test is given by Thursday, the student will\nfind the announcement incredible. At the beginning of the week, the\nstudent does not know (or believe) that the teacher will wait that\nlong. The principle of reflection \u2018Defer to the opinions of my future\nself \u2019 does not imply that I should defer to the opinions of my\nhypothetical future self. For my hypothetical future self is\nresponding to propositions that need not be actually true.\n\nThird, the principle of reflection may need more qualifications than\nBinkley anticipates. Binkley realizes that an ordinary agent foresees\nthat he will forget details. That is why we write reminders for our\nown benefit. An ordinary agent foresees periods of impaired judgment.\nThat is why we limit how much money we bring to the bar.\n\nBinkley stipulates that the students do not forget. He needs to add\nthat the students know that they will not forget. For the mere threat\nof a memory lapse sometimes suffices to undermine knowledge. Consider\nProfessor Anesthesiology\u2019s scheme for surprise tests: \u201cA\nsurprise test will be given either Wednesday or Friday with the help\nof an amnesia drug. If the test occurs on Wednesday, then the drug\nwill be administered five minutes after Wednesday\u2019s class. The\ndrug will instantly erase memory of the test and the students will\nfill in the gap by confabulation.\u201d You have just completed\nWednesday\u2019s class and so temporarily know that the test will be\non Friday. Ten minutes after the class, you lose this knowledge. No\ndrug was administered and there is nothing wrong with your memory. You\nare correctly remembering that no test was given on Wednesday.\nHowever, you do not know your memory is accurate because you also know\nthat if the test was given Wednesday then you would have a\npseudo-memory indistinguishable from your present memory. Despite not\ngaining any new evidence, you change your mind about the test\noccurring on Wednesday and lose your knowledge that the test is on\nFriday. (The change of belief is not crucial; you would still lack\nforeknowledge of the test even if you dogmatically persisted\nin believing that the test will be on Friday.)\n\nIf the students know that they will not forget and know there will be\nno undermining by outside evidence, then we may be inclined to agree\nwith Binkley\u2019s summary that his idealized student never loses\nthe knowledge he accumulates. As we shall see, however, this overlooks\nother ways in which rational agents may lose knowledge.\n",
