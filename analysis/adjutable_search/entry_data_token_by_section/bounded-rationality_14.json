    "main_text": "The Emergence of Ecological Rationality || Cultural Adaptation\n3.4 Cultural Adaptation\n\nSo far we have considered theories and models which emphasize an\nindividual organism and its surrounding environment, which is\ntypically understood to be either the physical environment or, if\nsocial, modeled as if it were the physical environment. And we\nconsidered whether some features commonly understood to be behavioral\nconstraints ought to be instead classified as environmental\naffordances.\n\nYet people and their responses to the world are also part of each\nperson\u2019s environment. Boyd and Richardson argue that human\nsocieties ought to be viewed as an adaptive environment, which in turn\nhas consequences for how individual behavior is evaluated. Human\nsocieties contain a large reservoir of information that is preserved\nthrough generations and expanded upon, despite limited, imperfect\nlearning by the members of human societies. Imitation, which\nis a common strategy in humans, including pre-verbal infants (Gergely,\nBekkering, & Kir\u00e1ly 2002), is central to cultural\ntransmission (Boyd & Richerson 2005) and the emergence of social\nnorms (Bicchieri & Muldoon 2014). In our environment, only a few\nindividuals with an interest in improving on the folk lore are\nnecessary to nudge the culture to be adaptive. The main advantage that\nhuman societies have over other groups of social animals, this\nargument runs, is that cultural adaptation is much faster than genetic\nadaptation (Bowles & Gintis 2011). On this view, human psychology\nevolved to facilitate speedy adaptation. Natural selection did not\nequip our large-brained ancestors with rigid behavior, but instead\nselected for brains that allowed then to modify their behavior\nadaptively in response to their environment (Barkow, Cosmides, &\nTooby 1992).\n\nBut if human psychology evolved to facility fast social learning, it\ncomes at the cost of human credulity. To have speedy adaptation\nthrough imitation of social norms and human behavior, the risk is the\nadoption of maladaptive norms or stupid behavior.\n",
