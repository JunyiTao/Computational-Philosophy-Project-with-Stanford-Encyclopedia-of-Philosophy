As\nwe saw above, notational consequentializers accept two controversial\nassumptions: the first two premises of their assimilation argument. We\nalready considered their defense of the first premise in\n section 4.2.\n And now it\u2019s time to see how they defend the second premise:\nthe assumption that if an act-consequentialist theory and a\nnon-consequentialist theory are necessarily co-extensive in their\ndeontic verdicts, then they are equivalent in the strong sense of\nbeing mere notational variants of each other.\n\nBefore we get to this defense, though, it\u2019s important to get\nclear on what the assumption is. It\u2019s that just as we can refer\nto the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a pot of boiling\nwater at one atmosphere of pressure using either the metric expression\n\u201c100 degrees Celsius\u201d or some equivalent non-metric\nexpression such as \u201c212 degrees Fahrenheit\u201d, we can refer\nto what makes an act one that ought to be performed using either the\nconsequentialist expression \u201chas an outcome that outranks every\navailable alternative\u201d or some putatively equivalent\nnon-consequentialist expression such as \u201cis necessary to show\nthe proper respect for humanity\u201d. The thought, then, is that\nwhat matters is only what Dreier calls the \u201cactive\ningredients\u201d, not the expressions that we use to label them.\nAnd, in the case of what makes a pot of water boiling, the active\ningredient is the average kinetic energy of the water\u2019s\nmolecules, whereas, in the case of what makes an act one that ought to\nbe performed, it is, according to Dreier, the features of its outcome\n(which includes the act itself) that contribute to its deontic\nstatus\u2014see Dreier 2011: 114.\n\nNow, one way of defending this underlying thought is to claim, as A.\nC. Ewing did, that \u201cthe good\u201d just means \u201cwhat ought\nto be brought into existence, other things being equal\u201d (1939:\n8). But, on this view, a non-consequentialist who claims that it can\nbe wrong to bring into existence what\u2019s best is just misusing\nthe word \u201cbest\u201d. And this may seem too quick.\n\nDreier is less quick. He claims only that insofar as we have some\npre-theoretical notion of a good outcome,\n\n\nits specific content is too weak and thin for it to come apart from\nthe notion of what we are to choose. (Dreier 2011: 115)\n\n\nThus,\n\n\nDreier\u2019s idea (following Foot) is that we don\u2019t have a\nconcept of goodness (applied to outcomes) that is independent of\nthoughts about what we ought to do. (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1482)\n\n\nFor, as Dreier sees it, the notion of an act whose outcome outranks\nevery available alternative cannot come apart from the notion of an\nact that ought to be performed.\n\nOne reason to doubt this, however, is that whereas some theories hold\nthat whether an agent ought to perform an act just depends on whether\nits outcome outranks every available alternative, other\ntheories hold that it depends instead on whether the outcome of\nthe best option in which the agent performs it outranks every\navailable alternative. Thus, an act whose outcome outranks every\navailable alternative needn\u2019t be one that ought to be performed,\ncontrary to Dreier\u2019s assertions. To illustrate, consider the\nfollowing example from Frank Jackson:\n\n\nWonderful things will happen if I raise both my arms at some given\ntime t. OK things will happen if I raise neither arm at\nt, and also if I raise my right arm but not my left arm at\nt. Dreadful things will happen if I raise my left arm but not\nmy right arm at t. If I raise my left arm at t, I\nwill not raise my right arm at t. I am completely free to\nraise or not to raise either of my arms at t. Let\u2019s\nsuppose that all the foregoing is known for certain by me at the time\nin question. (2014: 645)\n\n\nAccording to some theorists, I ought not to raise my left arm at\nt, because the outcome of my raising my left arm at\nt is outranked by that of an available alternative: that of\nmy raising neither arm at t. These theorists include both\nomnists and actualists\u2014see Portmore 2019 and\nTimmerman & Cohen 2019 [2020], respectively. Given that I will not\nraise my right arm at t if I raise my left arm at t,\ndreadful things will happen if I raise my left arm at t. But\nOK things will happen if I instead either raise neither arm at\nt or raise only my right arm at t. So, these\ntheorists hold that I should not raise my left arm at t.\n\nBut other theorists hold that I ought to raise my left arm at\nt, because although its outcome is outranked by that of\nrefraining from raising my left arm at t, the outcome of the\nbest option in which I raise my left arm at t\u2014that is,\nthe option in which I raise both my arms at t\u2014outranks\nevery available alternative. These theorists include both\nmaximalists and possibilists\u2014see Portmore 2019\nand Timmerman & Cohen 2019 [2020], respectively. After all,\nwonderful things will happen if I raise both my arms at t.\nAnd I have no option where something better than wonderful things\nwould happen. So, I ought to raise both my arms at t. And\nsince this entails raising my left arm at t, I ought to raise\nmy left arm at t.\n\nThis suggests, contrary to Dreier\u2019s assertions, that the notion\nof an act whose outcome outranks every available alternative can come\napart from the notion of an act that ought to be performed. For these\ntwo types of theorists agree that the outcome of my raising my left\narm at t (the outcome in which dreadful things happen) is\noutranked by that of my raising neither arm at t (the outcome\nin which OK things happen). And they agree that the outcome of my\nraising both my arms at t (the outcome in which wonderful\nthings happen) outranks those of every available alternative. But\ndespite their agreeing on how all the outcomes rank, they disagree on\nwhether I ought to perform the option of raising my left arm at\nt. In other words, the two theories agree on how to rank all\nthe available outcomes but disagree on whether the act whose outcome\noutranks every available alternative must always be the one that ought\nto be performed\u2014see Nair 2020. Thus, the two theories disagree\non what the active ingredients are and not just on how to label them.\nFor whereas omnists (and actualists) hold that the active ingredient\nin making an act one that ought to be performed is that its\noutcome outranks every available alternative (as Dreier\nassertions entail), maximalists (and possibilists) hold that it is\ninstead that the outcome of the best option in which the agent\nperforms it outranks every available alternative. Of course,\nDreier could try to argue that these two types of theories are somehow\nequivalent, but, as Shyam Nair points out, doing so would involve\nuncharitably insisting that one of them accepts a very implausible\nclaim about how to rank outcomes\u2014see his 2020. Unfortunately,\nNair\u2019s argument is too long and complex to summarize here. But\nthe reader should at least have a sense of this objection and how it\nmight be rebutted.\n",
