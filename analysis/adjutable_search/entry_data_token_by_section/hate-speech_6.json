Pornography, Hate Speech, and Silencing\n\nThat hate speech and pornography are discussed so frequently together\nin philosophy might, at first glance, seem surprising. But given the\noverlap made in the arguments made by anti-porn feminist about\npornography and anti-racist theorists about racist hate speech, the\ntwo are now intimately linked\u2014for better or for worse. (One\nimportant fact that led to this development is, of course, the ruling\nthat pornography is protected by the US first amendment as speech [see\nMiller v. California (1973)].) According to anti-porn\nfeminists, much of what is said of racist hate speech and the harms\nthat befall its targets also applies, with the appropriate changes, to\npornography and women\u2014including, it\u2019s worth emphasizing,\nwomen of color.\n\nMany of the important initial moves in this literature were crafted by\nfeminist legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin.\nOne of MacKinnon\u2019s most significant claims that has received\nsustained philosophical attention is the idea that (degrading and\nmisogynist) pornography silences women. With some\nmodifications, a similar claim may be applied to hate speech, namely,\nthat hate speech silences its targets. However, as the\nliterature has focused on the case of pornography and women,\nit\u2019s worth examining these arguments in detail first.\n\nThis silencing argument begins with MacKinnon\u2019s observation that\nthere are \u201cwords that set conditions\u201d for other speech\nacts\u2019 successes or failures (1993, 63\u201368; see also Hornsby\nand Langton, 1998, 27). That is, there are some speech acts that fix\nthe possibility of other speech acts. In other words, they make it\npossible for some persons to perform some speech acts, and make it\nimpossible for others. This is most evident in formal settings, like a\nlegislature, where the formal rules determine who may speak when, and\nin what manner. Pornography, the argument continues, does just this.\nIt sets rules of behavior that, in effect, inhibit the speech of\nwomen. The result of which is that the speech acts of\npornography\u2014performed by those who produce and distribute\nit\u2014create a climate that undermines women\u2019s capacity to\nperform certain speech acts of their own. The speech of some\n(pornographers), therefore, curtails the speech of others (women).\n\nIn an influential account of the phenomena of silencing, Langton\n(1993) deploys speech act theory to examine the case of sexual\nrefusal. According to the silencing argument, pornography depicts\nwomen as not (genuinely) refusing sexual advances with utterances of\n\u2018no.\u2019 Indeed, according to the myths perpetuated by\npornography (among other social influences), a woman\u2019s\n\u2018no\u2019 is not a refusal, but rather part of an elaborate\nsexual script. As a result, when a woman says \u2018no\u2019 in a\nnon-pornographic context, intending to refuse a man\u2019s sexual\nadvances, she may find herself unable to be heard\u2014that is, her\nwords won\u2019t have the force and effect she intends, and her\nhearer will not take her to be refusing. She may find herself silenced\nin this particularly horrendous way, unable to use the standard\nmethods of refusing another\u2019s sexual advances. The claim is that\nthis occurs as a result of pornography silencing women\u2019s\nrefusals in the context of sex. It renders their words powerless.\n\nIn making this argument, Langton relies on the distinction between\nlocutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts, and,\ncorrespondingly, locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary\nsilencing. A couple examples will explain these distinctions\nquickly:\n\nWhen X says, \u2018Shoot him!\u2019 they are, we can see\nquite quickly, both saying something: \u2018shoot him!\u2019 and at\nthe same time doing something: ordering the hearer to fire.\nIn Austinian terms, we can say that X performs the\nlocutionary act of making an utterance with a certain\nmeaning, and at the same time is performing an illocutionary\nact of ordering the hearer to fire. In addition to these two things,\nthe speaker is also, with their words, bringing about a number of\neffects, which Austin termed the \u2018perlocutionary\nact.\u2019 In this case, leading to some unfortunate soul to be shot.\n(Adapted from Langton, 1993, 295, and Austin, 1962, 101)\n\n\nTo be clear, these three acts\u2014locutionary, illocutionary, and\nperlocutionary\u2014all occur as part of a single utterance and serve\nto bring out different aspects of any speech act. Austin (and many\nafter him) paid particular attention to the illocutionary act of an\nutterance, as this, he said, corresponds to the force of an\nutterance. That is, what someone is doing with their words.\n\nWith this in mind, we can see that there are, in fact, many ways one\ncould silence someone. You could literally gag or threaten someone to\nprevent them from speaking at all, which would achieve a type of\nlocutionary silencing. Alternatively, you could let them say what they\nwish, recognize what act they are performing, but prevent them\nachieving their goals, and in doing so achieve a type of\nperlocutionary silencing. Finally, a third alternative occurs when one\nspeaks and is prevented not only from achieving their intended\neffects, but also is prevented from performing the very action they\nintend to perform (Langton, 1993, 315). It is this third\nalternative\u2014illocutionary silencing\u2014that is said to occur\nwhen a man fails to even recognize a woman\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 as\na refusal, owing at least partially to the influence of\npornography.\n\nThe specific mechanics of silencing\u2014along with the underlying\ntheory that best explains the phenomena\u2014is subject to much\ndispute in the literature, and numerous accounts with different\nessential features have been offered (see Langton (1993); Langton and\nWest (1999); Hornsby (1994); Hornsby and Langton (1998); Maitra\n(2009); McGowan (2004, 2009, 2014); Mikolla (2011; 2019), among\nothers).\n\nLaura Caponetto (2021) distinguishes four different types of\nsilencing, demonstrating the breadth of the concept. First, there is\nessential silencing, which consists in the hearer\u2019s\nfailure to recognize the illocutionary point of a speech act. Second,\nthere is authority silencing, where a hearer fails to\nacknowledge a speaker\u2019s authority in a relevant domain. Third,\nthere is sincerity silencing, when the speaker\u2019s\nutterance is inaccurately taken as insincere. Fourth and finally,\nthere is seriousness silencing, which consists in the\nhearer\u2019s failure to acknowledge the speaker\u2019s words as\nappropriately serious. Given these fine-grained ways of understanding\nsilencing, a broad, comprehensive definition of silencing may be put\nas follows:\n\nIllocutionary Silencing\n\nA speaker S putting forth a speech act A addressed\nto a hearer H is illocutionarily silenced iff (i) H\nfails to recognize the obtaining of some conditions for\nA\u2019s success; (ii) S\u2019s attempt at\nA-ing meets the conditions that H fails to\nrecognize; (iii) normal input and output conditions are met; (iv) the\nrecognition failure on H\u2019s part is systematic.\n(Caponetto, 2021)\n\n\nIn nearly all discussions of silencing, one common piece of contention\nconcerns the notion of \u2018uptake.\u2019 On different\nunderstanding of what uptake consists in\u2014ranging from the\nhearer\u2019s recognition of a speaker\u2019s intent, or the type of\nspeech act being performed, up to the material consequences of a\nspeech act\u2014we are led to different conclusions about whether a\nspeaker was silenced or not. Disagreement about the conditions of\nuptake poses difficulty, therefore, for many accounts of silencing.\nDrawing on these difficulties, Samia Hesni (2018) has argued that the\nstandard account of silencing needs significant retooling, in part\nbecause the necessary distinction between illocutionary silencing and\nperlocutionary silencing cannot hold, as it relies on a\nproblematic\u2014and arguably conceptually untenable\u2014notion of\nuptake (Hesni, 2018, 957). In an attempt to avoid these difficulties,\nwe might prefer an account of silencing that uses a Gricean, rather\nthan Austinian or Searlian framework, bypassing the need to fully\ndifferentiate the illocutionary from the perlocutionary (see Maitra,\n2009).\n\nWhile much of this literature is explicitly focused on\npornography\u2019s potential to silence women in the realm of sexual\nrefusal, the notion that racist hate speech may similarly play a\nsilencing function has also been put forward. For example, in a\nclassic paper on the topic, Lawrence wrote that:\n\nRacist speech \u2026 distorts the marketplace of ideas by muting or\ndevaluing the speech of Blacks and other despised minorities.\nRegardless of intrinsic value, their words and ideas become less\nsaleable in the marketplace of ideas. An idea that would be embraced\nby large numbers of individuals if it were offered by a white\nindividual will be rejected or given less credence if its author\nbelongs to a group demeaned and stigmatized by racist beliefs.\n(Lawrence, 1993, 78\u201379)\n\n\nUsing the above framework, we might therefore say that racist hate\nspeech can itself constitute words that set conditions for the success\nof other speech acts, and in doing so undermines the speech of its\ntargets\u2014and in some cases, effectively silencing them. That is,\nracist hate speech may, in cultivating an environment hostile to the\nvoices (and lives) of many, can lead to both locutionary and\nillocutionary silencing in a way that threatens their freedom of\nexpression. And as is noted above in the section on the harms of hate\nspeech, one long-term consequence of racist hate speech may be the\ntarget\u2019s partial withdrawal from certain aspects of public life,\nincluding public discourse (West, 2012, 237). One further harmful\neffect of hate speech, then, is its targets\u2019 silence.\n\nAnother way in which racist hate speech might silence is more\nimmediate. Returning to the distinction between propagandistic hate\nspeech on the one hand, and assaultive hate speech on the other, where\nthe latter consists in hate speech uttered directly to its target, we\nmay note that hate speech often serves as a type of attack. So,\ndespite the common refrain of \u2018more speech\u2019 offered as\nadvice, conceiving hate speech as a personal attack demonstrates how\nit, in fact, threatens the speech rights of its targets. As Lawrence\nputs it: \u201cThe visceral emotional response to personal attack\nprecludes speech\u201d (1993, 68). He goes on:\n\nAttack produces an instinctive, defensive psychological reaction.\nFear, rage, shock, and flight all interfere with any reasoned\nresponse. Words like \u2018nigger,\u2019 \u2018kike,\u2019 and\n\u2018faggot\u2019 produce physical symptoms that temporarily\ndisable the victim, and perpetrators often use these words with the\nintention of producing this effect. (ibid.)\n\n\nSo, in both cultivating an environment in which the speech of\nmarginalized groups is systematically devalued, or in serving as an\nimmediate threat, hate speech can be said to silence its targets.\n\nAs is the case with pornography and silencing, the details of the\nmechanisms that sustain this type of silencing, along with what\nparticular type of silencing racist hate speech results in, are\nsubject to dispute. But, just like in the pornography debate, the\nplausibility of the silencing argument lies partly in how it reframes\nthe overall question surrounding regulation. Rather than simply being\na source of harm that merely infringes on the equality rights of its\ntargets, if hate speech silences then it also infringes on the speech\nrights of its targets (West, 2012). As a result, it is not simply a\nquestion of balancing the speech rights of hate speakers against the\nwellbeing of their targets, but of competing claims to (substantive,\nand not just formal) freedom of expression. And given the importance\nthat most liberal democracies place on freedom of expression, the\nchallenge presented from hate speech is of central importance. For\nthis reason, the silencing question is one of the most disputed\naspects of hate speech and has generated great attention.\n",
