Arguments for Coherence Theories of Truth\n\n\nTwo principal lines of argument have led philosophers to adopt a\ncoherence theory of truth. Early advocates of coherence theories were\npersuaded by reflection on metaphysical questions. More recently,\nepistemological and semantic considerations have been the basis for\ncoherence theories. \n2.1 The Metaphysical Route to Coherentism\n\n\nEarly versions of the coherence theory were associated with\nidealism. Walker (1989) attributes coherentism to Spinoza, Kant, Fichte\nand Hegel. Certainly a coherence theory was adopted by a number of\nBritish Idealists in the last years of the nineteenth century and the\nfirst decades of the twentieth. See, for example, Bradley\n(1914).\n\n\nIdealists are led to a coherence theory of truth by their\nmetaphysical position. Advocates of the correspondence theory believe\nthat a belief is (at least most of the time) ontologically distinct\nfrom the objective conditions which make the belief true. Idealists do\nnot believe that there is an ontological distinction between beliefs\nand what makes beliefs true. From the idealists\u2019 perspective, reality\nis something like a collection of beliefs. Consequently, a belief\ncannot be true because it corresponds to something which is not a\nbelief. Instead, the truth of a belief can only consist in its\ncoherence with other beliefs. A coherence theory of truth which results\nfrom idealism usually leads to the view that truth comes in degrees. A\nbelief is true to the degree that it coheres with other beliefs.\n\n\nSince idealists do not recognize an ontological distinction between\nbeliefs and what makes them true, distinguishing between versions of\nthe coherence theory of truth adopted by idealists and an identity\ntheory of truth can be difficult. The article on Bradley in this\nEncyclopedia (Candlish 2006) argues that Bradley had an identity\ntheory, not a coherence theory.\n\n\nIn recent years metaphysical arguments for coherentism have found\nfew advocates. This is due to the fact that idealism is not widely\nheld.\n2.2 Epistemological Routes to Coherentism\n\n\nBlanshard (1939, ch. XXVI) argues that a coherence theory of\njustification leads to a coherence theory of truth. His argument runs\nas follows. Someone might hold that coherence with a set of beliefs is\nthe test of truth but that truth consists in correspondence to\nobjective facts. If, however, truth consists in correspondence to\nobjective facts, coherence with a set of beliefs will not be a test of\ntruth. This is the case since there is no guarantee that a perfectly\ncoherent set of beliefs matches objective reality. Since coherence with\na set of beliefs is a test of truth, truth cannot consist in\ncorrespondence.\n\n\nBlanshard\u2019s argument has been criticised by, for example, Rescher\n(1973). Blanshard\u2019s argument depends on the claim that coherence with a\nset of beliefs is the test of truth. Understood in one sense, this\nclaim is plausible enough. Blanshard, however, has to understand this\nclaim in a very strong sense: coherence with a set of beliefs is an\ninfallible test of truth. If coherence with a set of beliefs is simply\na good but fallible test of truth, as Rescher suggests, the argument\nfails. The \u201cfalling apart\u201d of truth and justification to which\nBlanshard refers is to be expected if truth is only a fallible test of\ntruth.\n\n\nAnother epistemological argument for coherentism is based on the\nview that we cannot \u201cget outside\u201d our set of beliefs and compare\npropositions to objective facts. A version of this argument was\nadvanced by some logical positivists including Hempel (1935) and\nNeurath (1983). This argument, like Blanshard\u2019s, depends on a coherence\ntheory of justification. The argument infers from such a theory that we\ncan only know that a proposition coheres with a set of beliefs. We can\nnever know that a proposition corresponds to reality.\n\n\nThis argument is subject to at least two criticisms. For a start, it\ndepends on a coherence theory of justification, and is vulnerable to\nany objections to this theory. More importantly, a coherence theory of\ntruth does not follow from the premisses. We cannot infer from the fact\nthat a proposition cannot be known to correspond to reality that it\ndoes not correspond to reality. Even if correspondence theorists admit\nthat we can only know which propositions cohere with our beliefs, they\ncan still hold that truth consists in correspondence. If correspondence\ntheorists adopt this position, they accept that there may be truths\nwhich cannot be known. Alternatively, they can argue, as does Davidson\n(1986), that the coherence of a proposition with a set of beliefs is a\ngood indication that the proposition corresponds to objective facts and\nthat we can know that propositions correspond.\n\n\nCoherence theorists need to argue that propositions cannot\ncorrespond to objective facts, not merely that they cannot be known to\ncorrespond. In order to do this, the foregoing argument for coherentism\nmust be supplemented. One way to supplement the argument would be to\nargue as follows. As noted above, the correspondence and coherence\ntheories have differing views about the nature of truth conditions. One\nway to decide which account of truth conditions is correct is to pay\nattention to the process by which propositions are assigned truth\nconditions. Coherence theorists can argue that the truth conditions of\na proposition are the conditions under which speakers make a practice\nof asserting it. Coherentists can then maintain that speakers can only\nmake a practice of asserting a proposition under conditions the\nspeakers are able to recognise as justifying the proposition. Now the\n(supposed) inability of speakers to \u201cget outside\u201d of their beliefs is\nsignificant. Coherentists can argue that the only conditions speakers\ncan recognise as justifying a proposition are the conditions under\nwhich it coheres with their beliefs. When the speakers make a practice\nof asserting the proposition under these conditions, they become the\nproposition\u2019s truth conditions. For an argument of this sort see Young\n(1995).\n",
