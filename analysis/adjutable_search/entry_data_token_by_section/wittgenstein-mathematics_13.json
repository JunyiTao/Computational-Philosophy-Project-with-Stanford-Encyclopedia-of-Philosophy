    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries || Extra-Mathematical Application as a Necessary Condition of Mathematical Meaningfulness\n3.5 Extra-Mathematical Application as a Necessary Condition of Mathematical Meaningfulness\n\nThe principal and most significant change from the middle to later\nwritings on mathematics is Wittgenstein\u2019s (re-)introduction of\nan extra-mathematical application criterion, which is used to\ndistinguish mere \u201csign-games\u201d from mathematical\nlanguage-games. \u201c[I]t is essential to mathematics that its signs\nare also employed in mufti\u201d, Wittgenstein states, for\n\n\n\n[i]t is the use outside mathematics, and so the meaning\n[Bedeutung] of the signs, that makes the\nsign-game into mathematics. (i.e., a mathematical\n\u201clanguage-game\u201d; RFM V, \u00a72, 1942;\nLFM 140\u2013141, 169\u201370) \n\n\nAs Wittgenstein says at (RFM V, \u00a741, 1943), \n\n\n[c]oncepts which occur in \u2018necessary\u2019 propositions\nmust also occur and have a meaning\n[Bedeutung] in non-necessary ones. (italics\nadded) \n\n\nIf two proofs prove the same proposition, says Wittgenstein, this\nmeans that \u201cboth demonstrate it as a suitable instrument for the\nsame purpose\u201d, which \u201cis an allusion to something\noutside mathematics\u201d (RFM VII, \u00a710, 1941;\nitalics added).\n\nAs we have seen, this criterion was present in the Tractatus\n(6.211), but noticeably absent in the middle period. The reason for\nthis absence is probably that the intermediate Wittgenstein wanted to\nstress that in mathematics everything is syntax and nothing is\nmeaning. Hence, in his criticisms of Hilbert\u2019s\n\u2018contentual\u2019 mathematics (Hilbert 1925) and\nBrouwer\u2019s reliance upon intuition to determine the meaningful\ncontent of (especially undecidable) mathematical propositions,\nWittgenstein couched his finitistic constructivism in strong\nformalism, emphasizing that a mathematical calculus does not need an\nextra-mathematical application (PR \u00a7109; WVC\n105).\n\nThere seem to be two reasons why the later Wittgenstein reintroduces\nextra-mathematical application as a necessary condition of a\nmathematical language-game. First, the later Wittgenstein has\nan even greater interest in the use of natural and formal\nlanguages in diverse \u201cforms of life\u201d (PI\n\u00a723), which prompts him to emphasize that, in many cases, a\nmathematical \u2018proposition\u2019 functions as if it were an\nempirical proposition \u201chardened into a rule\u201d (RFM\nVI, \u00a723) and that mathematics plays diverse applied roles in many\nforms of human activity (e.g., science, technology, predictions).\nSecond, the extra-mathematical application criterion relieves the\ntension between Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate critique of set\ntheory and his strong formalism according to which \u201cone calculus\nis as good as another\u201d (PG 334). By demarcating\nmathematical language-games from non-mathematical sign-games,\nWittgenstein can now claim that, \u201cfor the time being\u201d, set\ntheory is merely a formal sign-game. \n\n\nThese considerations may lead us to say that \\(2^{\\aleph_0} \\gt\n\\aleph_0\\).\n\nThat is to say: we can make the considerations lead us to\nthat.\n\nOr: we can say this and give this as our reason.\n\nBut if we do say it\u2014what are we to do next? In what practice is\nthis proposition anchored? It is for the time being a piece of\nmathematical architecture which hangs in the air, and looks as if it\nwere, let us say, an architrave, but not supported by anything and\nsupporting nothing. (RFM II, \u00a735)\n\n\nIt is not that Wittgenstein\u2019s later criticisms of set theory\nchange, it is, rather, that once we see that set theory has no\nextra-mathematical application, we will focus on its calculations,\nproofs, and prose and \u201csubject the interest of the\ncalculations to a test\u201d (RFM II, \u00a762). By\nmeans of Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201cimmensely\nimportant\u201d \u2018investigation\u2019 (LFM 103), we\nwill find, Wittgenstein expects, that set theory is uninteresting\n(e.g., that the non-enumerability of \u201cthe reals\u201d is\nuninteresting and useless) and that our entire interest in it lies in\nthe \u2018charm\u2019 of the mistaken prose interpretation of its\nproofs (LFM 16). More importantly, though there is \u201ca\nsolid core to all [its] glistening concept-formations\u201d\n(RFM V, \u00a716), once we see it as \u201cas a mistake of\nideas\u201d, we will see that propositions such as\n\u201c\\(2^{\\aleph_0} \\gt \\aleph_0\\)\u201d are not anchored in an\nextra-mathematical practice, that \u201cCantor\u2019s\nparadise\u201d \u201cis not a paradise\u201d, and we will\nthen leave \u201cof [our] own accord\u201d (LFM\n103).\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that the later Wittgenstein still\nmaintains that the operations within a mathematical calculus are\npurely formal, syntactical operations governed by rules of syntax\n(i.e., the solid core of formalism).\n\n\nIt is of course clear that the mathematician, in so far as he really\nis \u2018playing a game\u2019\u2026[is] acting in\naccordance with certain rules. (RFM V, \u00a71)\n\nTo say mathematics is a game is supposed to mean: in proving, we need\nnever appeal to the meaning [Bedeutung] of the\nsigns, that is to their extra-mathematical application. (RFM\nV, \u00a74)\n\n\nWhere, during the middle period, Wittgenstein speaks of\n\u201carithmetic [as] a kind of geometry\u201d at (PR\n\u00a7109 & \u00a7111), the later Wittgenstein similarly speaks of\n\u201cthe geometry of proofs\u201d (RFM I, App. III,\n\u00a714), the \u201cgeometrical cogency\u201d of proofs\n(RFM III, \u00a743), and a \u201cgeometrical\napplication\u201d according to which the \u201ctransformation of\nsigns\u201d in accordance with \u201ctransformation-rules\u201d\n(RFM VI, \u00a72, 1941) shows that \u201cwhen mathematics is\ndivested of all content, it would remain that certain signs can be\nconstructed from others according to certain rules\u201d\n(RFM III, \u00a738). Hence, the question whether a\nconcatenation of signs is a proposition of a given\nmathematical calculus (i.e., a calculus with an\nextra-mathematical application) is still an internal, syntactical\nquestion, which we can answer with knowledge of the proofs and\ndecision procedures of the calculus.\n",
