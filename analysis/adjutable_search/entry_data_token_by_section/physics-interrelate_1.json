Physicist\u2019s Sense of Reduction\n\n\nPhilosophical theories of reduction would have it that, say, quantum\nmechanics reduces classical mechanics through the derivation of the\nlaws of classical physics from those of quantum physics. Most\nphysicists would, on the other hand, speak of quantum mechanics\nreducing to classical mechanics in some kind of correspondence limit\n(e.g., the limit as Planck\u2019s constant \\((h/2\\pi)\\) goes to zero).\nThus, the second type of intertheoretic reduction noted by Nickles fits\nthe following schema:\n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\\({\\bf Schema\\ R}\\)}\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0} T_f = T_c\n\\]\n\n\n\nHere \\(T_f\\) is the typically newer, more\nfine theory, \\(T_c\\) is the typically older,\ncoarser theory, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a fundamental parameter appearing in\n\\(T_f\\) .\n\n\nOne must take the equality here with a small grain of salt. In those\nsituations where Schema R can be said to hold, it is\nlikely not the case that every equation or formula from\n\\(T_f\\) will yield a corresponding equation of\n\\(T_c\\) .\n\n\nEven given this caveat, the equality in Schema R\ncan hold only if the limit is \u201cregular.\u201d In such circumstances, it can\nbe argued that it is appropriate to call the limiting relation a\n\u201creduction.\u201d If the limit in Schema R is singular,\nhowever, the schema fails and it is best to talk simply about\nintertheoretic relations.\n\n\nOne should understand the difference between regular and singular\nlimiting relations as follows. If the solutions of the relevant\nformulae or equations of the theory \\(T_f\\) are\nsuch that for small values of \\(\\varepsilon\\) they smoothly approach\nthe solutions of the corresponding formulas in\n\\(T_c\\), then Schema R will\nhold. For these cases we can say that the \u201climiting behavior\u201d as\n\\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\) equals the \u201cbehavior in the limit\u201d where\n\\(\\varepsilon = 0\\). On the other hand, if the behavior in the\nlimit is of a fundamentally different character than the\nnearby solutions one obtains as \\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\), then the schema will\nfail.\n\n\nA nice example illustrating this distinction is the following:\nConsider the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + x - 9\\varepsilon = 0\\). Think of \\(\\varepsilon\\) as a small expansion or\nperturbation parameter. The equation has two roots for any value of\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) as \\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\). In a well-defined sense, the solutions\nto this quadratic equation as \\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\) smoothly approach\nsolutions to the \u201cunperturbed\u201d \\((\\varepsilon = 0)\\) equation\n\\(x^2 + x = 0\\); namely, \\(x = 0, -1\\). On the other hand, the equation\n\\(x^2\\varepsilon + x - 9 = 0\\) has two\nroots for any value of \\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\) but has for its\n\u201cunperturbed\u201d solution only one root; namely, \\(x = 9\\). The\nequation suffers a reduction in order when \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\). Thus, the\ncharacter of the behavior in the limit \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\) differs\nfundamentally from the character of its limiting behavior. Not all\nsingular limits result from reductions in order of the equations.\nNevertheless, these latter singular cases are much more prevalent than\nthe former.\n\n\nA paradigm case where a limiting reduction of the form\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) rather straightforwardly holds is that of classical\nNewtonian particle mechanics (NM) and the special theory of relativity\n(SR). In the limit where \\((v/c)^2\\rightarrow 0\\), SR\nreduces to NM. Nickles says \u201cepitomizing [the intertheoretic reduction\nof SR to NM] is the reduction of the Einsteinian formula for\nmomentum,\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{m_0 v}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(m_0\\) is the rest mass, to the classical formula\n\\(p = m_0 v\\) in the limit as\n\\(v\\rightarrow 0\\).\u201d[3]\n (Nickles 1973, 182) \n\n\nThis is a regular limit\u2014there are no singularities or\n\u201cblowups\u201d as the asymptotic limit is approached. As noted one way of\nthinking about this is that the exact solutions for small but nonzero\nvalues of \\(|\\varepsilon\\)| \u201csmoothly [approach] the unperturbed or\nzeroth-order solution [\\(\\varepsilon\\) set identically equal to zero] as\n\\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\).\u201d In the case where the limit is singular\n\u201cthe exact solution for \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\) is fundamentally different in\ncharacter from the \u2018neighboring\u2019 solutions obtained in\nthe limit \\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\).\u201d (Bender and Orszag 1978, 324)\n\n\nIn the current context, one can express the regular nature of the\nlimiting relation in the following way. The fundamental expression\nappearing in the Lorentz transformations of SR, can be expanded in a\nTaylor series as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1\\rightarrow(v/c)^2}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(v/c)^2 - \n  \\frac{1}{8}(v/c)^4 - \\frac{1}{16}(v/c)^6 - \\cdots\n\\]\n\n\n\nand so the limit is analytic. This means that (at least some)\nquantities or expressions of SR can be written as Newtonian or\nclassical quantities plus an expansion of corrections in powers of\n\\((v/c)^2\\). So one may think of this\nrelationship between SR and NM as a regular perturbation\nproblem.\n\n\nExamples like this have led some investigators to think of limiting\nrelations as forming a kind of new rule of inference which would allow\none to more closely connect the physicists\u2019 sense of reduction with\nthat of the philosophers\u2019. Fritz Rohrlich, for example, has argued that\nNM reduces (in the philosophers\u2019 sense) to SR because the\nmathematical framework of SR reduces (in the physicists\u2019\nsense) to the mathematical framework of NM. The idea is that\nthe mathematical framework of NM is \u201crigorously derived\u201d from that of\nSR in a \u201cderivation which involves limiting procedures.\u201d (Rohrlich\n1988, 303) Roughly speaking, for Rohrlich a \u201ccoarser\u201d theory is\nreducible to a \u201cfiner\u201d theory in the philosophers\u2019 sense of being\nrigorously deduced from the latter just in case the mathematical\nframework of the finer theory reduces in the physicists\u2019 sense to the\nmathematical framework of the coarser theory. In such cases, we will\nhave a systematic explication of the idea of \u201cstrong analogy\u201d to which\nSchaffner appeals in his model of philosophical reduction. The\ncorrected theory \\(T'^*\\) in this context is the perturbed\nNewtonian theory as expressed in the Taylor expansion given above. The\n\u201cstrong analogy\u201d between Newtonian theory \\(T'\\) and the\ncorrected \\(T'^*\\) is expressed by the existence of the\nregular Taylor series expansion.\n\n\nAs noted the trouble with maintaining that this relationship between\nthe philosophical and \u201cphysical\u201d models of reduction holds generally is\nthat far more often than not the limiting relations between the\ntheories are singular and not regular. In such situations,\nSchema R fails to hold. Paradigm cases here include\nthe relationships between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics,\nthe ray theory of light and the wave theory, and thermodynamics and\nstatistical mechanics of systems in critical states.\n",
