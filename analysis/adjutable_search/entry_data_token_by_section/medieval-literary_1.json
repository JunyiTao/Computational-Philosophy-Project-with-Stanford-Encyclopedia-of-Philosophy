    "main_text": "Literary Forms || Allegory and Allegoresis\n2.1 Allegory and Allegoresis\n\nThe models for allegorical writings and allegorizing of traditional\ntexts (allegoresis) come to the Middle Ages through\nNeoplatonic sources and, for Jewish and Arabic thinkers, from\ntraditions of biblical commentary and the Qur\u2019an itself (Shatz\n2003; Ivry 2000). As Ivry puts it, the Qur\u2019an effects \u201ca\nsignificant change in the Biblical legacy, treating individual persons\nand events as universal types and symbols. This approach turns the\nQur\u2019anic presentations of Biblical stories into allegories, the\npersons involved into emblems of virtue or vice\u201d (Ivry 2000,\n155). Jewish philosophers themselves read the Hebrew bible and\nrabbinic literature philosophically, interpreting its stories as\nhaving another, esoteric meaning behind the literal one. The Jewish\nphilosopher Philo is the most important figure in the development of\nthis kind of philosophical allegorization, though his influence is\naccepted to be greater on Christian than Jewish thinkers, most\nsignificantly on Augustine. Nonetheless, Jewish philosophers regularly\nallegorize scripture and are also influenced by allegorical readings\ngiven in rabbinic and midrashic literature (Shatz 2003). Neoplatonic\nwriters developed allegorical readings of both Plato and classical\nliterature, finding in these diverse texts figures of the spiritual\njourney from this world to the next. They also composed their own\nallegories on similar themes.\n\nThe underlying presupposition of allegory is that things can come to\nstand for something else. For the Neoplatonists this possibility is\nbased on the relationship of material things to the One from which\nthey have emanated. Because things come from the One, they are\nfragmentary reflections of the fullness of that goodness. The\nallegorical interpretation of whole texts rather than particular\nepisodes or images dates from the 3rd century. It is based on the idea\nthat the text as a whole reflects the \u201cNeoplatonic ideology of\n\u2018organic\u2019 order\u201d in which any part of the\ncomposition or cosmos is a symbol of the One, from which everything\nproceeds (Whitman 2000, 36). Aristotle has a role to play as well: his\ndistinction between demonstrative, dialectical, and rhetorical\nreasoning is used to interpret the Qur\u2019an and to justify\ndifferent types of writing for different audiences. Moreover,\nAristotle\u2019s Poetics is used by Avicenna to justify\nwriting in the form of stories (Whitman 2000, 47\u20138). For those\nwithin the religious traditions of Judaism, Islam, or Christianity,\nallegory is based on the inspired character of scripture into which\nGod has inserted many layers of meaning. Though Islamic philosophers\nhad an independent religious tradition of allegorical literature from\nwhich they could draw, the allegories from medieval Islamic thinkers\ntend to concern the same Neoplatonic themes of the ascent of the soul\nand the Neoplatonic structure of the cosmos, allegorizing the stages\nof emanation from and return to the One. The most common form of\nIslamic philosophical allegory is on the theme of the heavenly ascent\nor journey, a philosophical rather than prophetic rewriting of the\nspiritual journey of the prophet Mohammed. Avicenna wrote two\nallegories of this type, Ris\u00e2lat at-tair (Treatise\nof the Bird) and Hayy ibn Yaqz\u00e2n. (Heath 1992, has\nalso translated from Persian an allegory of Avicenna\u2019s,\nMi\u2019r\u00e2j N\u00e2ma, The Book of the Prophet\nMuhammad\u2019s Ascent to Heaven.) In the Treatise of the\nBird, a group of birds fly on a long journey in search of truth\nover nine mountain ranges, each a dangerous and a tempting resting\nplace; in the second, the narrator, consulting Hayy, a sage, makes a\ncosmic journey from west to east, ending in a vision of God (Avicenna\n1980). Ibn Tufayl\u2019s Hayy ibn Yaqz\u00e2n takes its\nname from Avicenna\u2019s allegory and claims to reveal in it the\nsecrets of Avicenna\u2019s \u201cOriental philosophy\u201d\n(Avicenna 1980; Ibn Tufayl 2009). Ibn Tufayl\u2019s version may have\nbeen one of the models for Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson\nCrusoe. This story of a boy abandoned on an island and raised by\na gazelle recounts the boy\u2019s survival and progress in\nunderstanding from what is necessary for survival, to a grasp of the\nlaws of the universe, culminating in a mystical experience. The\nboy\u2019s progress symbolizes the path and powers of unaided human\nreason, able to advance from complete ignorance to union with the\ndivine.\n\nIn the Latin West, philosophical allegory flourished in the 12th\ncentury. Authors like Bernard Silvestris, Thierry of Chartres, William\nof Conches, and Alan of Lille took up allegoresis and allegory as a\nway of assimilating works and ideas from classical antiquity,\nespecially the creation myth and cosmology of Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus. One of the most important, Bernard\nSilvestris\u2019s Cosmographia, is an allegorical account of\nthe origins of the world, both narrative and structural. Bernard tells\nthe story of Natura asking Noys to bring some order to prime matter.\nBook I traces the creation of the material world, and book II, the\ncreation of man (Bernard Silvestris 1973). Bernard\u2019s main source\nfor this myth of creation is Plato\u2019s Timaeus but his\nmyth making is combined with philosophical and scientific speculation.\nLike Alan of Lille\u2019s allegories, De Planctu Naturae and\nAnticlaudianus, Bernard\u2019s work is both allegorical and\nencyclopedic, two forms which were also combined in an important\nclassical model for these works, Martianus Capella\u2019s The\nMarriage of Mercury and Philology. What is remarkable about these\nworks is the combination of allegory with science and philosophy.\nThese writers do not think of the mythic and the scientific as\nopposing discourses. Rather, the creation of new myths is associated\nwith the work of creation, linking the work of God as artifex with\nthat of the composer of allegory. Science and allegory are also linked\nby the activity of de-allegorization, the process of extracting the\nabstract and philosophical message hidden in the allegory. According\nto Brian Stock, until the middle of the 12th century, it was taken as\na given that allegories contained hidden philosophical information\n(Stock 1972, 31).\n\nThe controversial and difficult question is why these medieval\nthinkers chose the allegorical form, and whether the text can be\nunderstood without its allegorical form. Avicenna tells us that what\nhe purports to do by allegory is to convey one message to the\n\u201cmany\u201d in sensible imagery they can understand, while\nconveying a different message to the philosophically minded few (Heath\n1992, 150\u2013153). Neoplatonic and Christian writers, although\nciting the importance of not \u2018casting one\u2019s pearls before\nswine\u2019, also cite the need to provide access through the senses\nto a non-sensible reality and the need to use obvious metaphors so\nthat their language will not be taken for a literally true\nrepresentation of the divine. In the secondary literature, the most\ncommon interpretation of the reason for the allegorical form is that\nthe allegory is an heuristic device that makes the difficult and\nabstract message easier to understand. On this view, the allegorical\nform can be stripped away without changing the meaning of the text.\nOthers have argued that for some writers, the allegorical form is\nchosen because the mystical message or account of spiritual union with\nthe good exceeds what can be expressed in the literal language of\nlogic and argument (Sweeney 2006, 38\u201361, 157\u2013175). Some\nhave argued, further, that the indirection of Maimonides\u2019\nGuide, for example, is based both on the inability to\nrepresent the divine nature but also, failing that, designed to\ntransform the reader making his/her way to God (Whitman 2000, 51;\nHarvey 1988, 69\u201371). On this view, the allegorical form is an\nessential aspect of the text and, hence, cannot be excised without\ndetriment to the author\u2019s meaning. Lastly, some argue that the\nmotive for allegory is esoteric. On this view, most famously\npropounded by Leo Strauss and his followers, writers fearing\npersecution and misinterpretation decided to \u201chide\u201d their\ntrue views behind the fa\u00e7ade of allegory, in order to protect\nboth themselves and their message.
