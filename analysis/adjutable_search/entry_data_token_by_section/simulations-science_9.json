    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Computer Simulations || Novel features of EOCS\n4.1 Novel features of EOCS\n\n\nWinsberg (2001) argued that, unlike the epistemological issues that\ntake center stage in traditional confirmation theory, an adequate EOCS\nmust meet three conditions. In particular it must take account of\nthe fact that the knowledge produced by computer simulations is the\nresult of inferences that are downward, motley, and\nautonomous.\n\nDownward. EOCS must reflect the fact that in a large\nnumber of cases, accepted scientific theories are the starting point\nfor the construction of computer simulation models and play an\nimportant role in the justification of inferences from simulation\nresults to conclusions about real-world target systems. The\nword \u201cdownward\u201d was meant to signal the fact that, unlike\nmost scientific inferences that have traditionally interested\nphilosophers, which move up from observation instances to\ntheories, here we have inferences that are drawn (in part) from\nhigh theory, down to particular features of phenomena.\n\nMotley. EOCS must take into account that simulation results\nnevertheless typically depend not just on theory but on many other\nmodel ingredients and resources as well, including parameterizations\n(discussed above), numerical solution methods, mathematical tricks,\napproximations and idealizations, outright fictions, ad hoc\nassumptions, function libraries, compilers and computer hardware, and\nperhaps most importantly, the blood, sweat, and tears of much trial and\nerror.\n\nAutonomous. EOCS must take into account the autonomy\nof the knowledge produced by simulation in the sense that the knowledge\nproduced by simulation cannot be sanctioned entirely by comparison with\nobservation. Simulations are usually employed to study phenomena where\ndata are sparse. In these circumstances, simulations are meant to\nreplace experiments and observations as sources of data about the world\nbecause the relevant experiments or observations are out of reach,\nfor principled, practical, or ethical reasons.\n\n\n\nParker (2013) has made the point that the usefulness of\nthese conditions is somewhat compromised by the fact that it is overly\nfocused on simulation in the physical sciences, and other disciplines\nwhere simulation is theory-driven and equation-based. This seems\ncorrect. In the social and behavioral sciences, and other\ndisciplines where agent-based simulation (see 2.2) are more the\nnorm, and where models are built in the absence of established and\nquantitative theories, EOCS probably ought to be characterized in other\nterms.\n\n\nFor instance, some social scientists who use agent-based simulation\npursue a methodology in which social phenomena (for example an\nobserved pattern like segregation) are explained, or accounted for, by\ngenerating similar looking phenomena in their simulations (Epstein and\nAxtell 1996; Epstein 1999). But this raises its own sorts of\nepistemological questions. What exactly has been accomplished, what\nkind of knowledge has been acquired, when an observed social\nphenomenon is more or less reproduced by an agent-based simulation?\nDoes this count as an explanation of the phenomenon?  A possible\nexplanation? (see e.g., Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff 2007).  Giuseppe Primiero\n(2019) argues that there is a whole domain of \u201cartificial\nsciences\u201d built around agent-based and multi-agent system based\nsimulations, and that it requires its own epistemology--one where\nvalidation cannot be defined by comparison with an existing real-world\nsystem, but must be defined vis a vis an intended system.\n\n\nIt is also fair to say, as Parker does (2013), that the\nconditions outlined above pay insufficient attention to the various and\ndiffering purposes for which simulations are used (as discussed in\n2.4). If we are using a simulation to make detailed\nquantitative predictions about the future behavior of a target system,\nthe epistemology of such inferences might require more stringent\nstandards than those that are involved when the inferences being made\nare about the general, qualitative behavior of a whole class of\nsystems. Indeed, it is also fair to say that much more work could\nbe done in classifying the kinds of purposes to which computer\nsimulations are put and the constraints those purposes place on the\nstructure of their epistemology.\n\n\nFrigg and Reiss (2009) argued that none of these three conditions\nare new to computer simulation. They argued that ordinary\n\u2018paper and pencil\u2019 modeling incorporate these\nfeatures. Indeed, they argued that computer simulation could not\npossibly raise new epistemological issues because the epistemological\nissues could be cleanly divided into the question of the\nappropriateness of the model underlying the simulation, which is an\nissue that is identical to the epistemological issues that arise in\nordinary modeling, and the question of the correctness of the solution\nto the model equations delivered by the simulation, which is a\nmathematical question, and not one related to the epistemology of\nscience. On the first point, Winsberg (2009b) replied that\nit was the simultaneous confluence of all three features that was new\nto simulation. We will return to the second point in section\n4.3\n",
