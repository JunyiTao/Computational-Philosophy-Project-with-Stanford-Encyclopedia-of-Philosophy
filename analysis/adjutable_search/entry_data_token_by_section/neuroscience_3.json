    "main_text": "Consciousness Explained?\n4. Consciousness Explained?\n\nConsciousness re-emerged over the past three decades as a topic of\nresearch focus in philosophy of mind, and in the cognitive and brain\nsciences. Instead of ignoring it, many physicalists sought to explain\nit (Dennett 1991). Here we focus exclusively on ways that\nneuroscientific discoveries have impacted philosophical debates about\nthe nature of consciousness and its relation to physical mechanisms.\n(See links to other entries in this encyclopedia below in\n Related Entries\n for broader discussions about consciousness and physicalism.)\n\nThomas Nagel (1974) argued famously that conscious experience is\nsubjective, and thus permanently recalcitrant to objective scientific\nunderstanding. He invited us to ponder \u201cwhat it is like to be a\nbat\u201d and urged the intuitive judgment that no amount of\nphysical-scientific knowledge, including neuroscientific, supplies a\ncomplete answer. Nagel\u2019s intuition pump has generated extensive\nphilosophical discussion. At least two well-known replies made direct\nappeal to neurophysiology. John Biro (1991) suggested that part of the\nintuition pumped by Nagel, that bat experience is substantially\ndifferent from human experience, presupposes systematic relations\nbetween physiology and phenomenology. Kathleen Akins (1993a) delved\ndeeper into existing knowledge of bat physiology and reports much that\nis pertinent to Nagel\u2019s question. She argued that many of the\nquestions about bat subjective experience that we still consider open\nhinge on questions that remain unanswered about neuroscientific\ndetails. One example of the latter is the function of various cortical\nactivity profiles in the active bat.\n\nDavid Chalmers (1996) famously argued that any possible brain-process\naccount of consciousness will leave open an \u201cexplanatory\ngap\u201d between the brain process and properties of the conscious\n experience.[10]\n This is because no brain-process theory can answer the\n\u201chard\u201d question: Why should that particular brain process\ngive rise to that particular conscious experience? We can always\nimagine (\u201cconceive of\u201d) a universe populated by creatures\nhaving those brain processes but completely lacking conscious\nexperience. A theory of consciousness requires an explanation of how\nand why some brain process causes a conscious experience, replete with\nall the features we experience. The fact that the hard question\nremains unanswered shows that we will probably never get a complete\nexplanation of consciousness at the level of neural mechanism. Paul\nand Patricia Churchland (1997) offered the following diagnosis and\nreply. Chalmers offers a conceptual argument, based on our\nability to imagine creatures possessing active brains like ours but\nwholly lacking in conscious experiences. But the more one learns about\nhow the brain produces conscious experience\u2014and such a\nliterature has emerged (for some early work, see Gazzaniga\n1995)\u2014the harder it becomes to imagine a universe consisting of\ncreatures with brain processes like ours but lacking consciousness.\nThis is not just bare assertion. The Churchlands appeal to some\nneurobiological detail. For example, Paul Churchland (1995) develops a\nneuroscientific account of consciousness based on recurrent\nconnections between thalamic nuclei, particularly between\n\u201cdiffusely projecting\u201d nuclei like the intralaminar nuclei\nand the\n cortex.[11]\n Churchland argues that thalamocortical recurrency accounts for the\nselective features of consciousness, for the effects of short-term\nmemory on conscious experience, for vivid dreaming during REM\n(rapid-eye movement) sleep, and other \u201ccore\u201d features of\nconscious experience. In other words, the Churchlands are claiming\nthat when one learns about activity patterns in these recurrent\ncircuits, one can no longer \u201cimagine\u201d or \u201cconceive\nof\u201d this activity occurring without these core features of\nconscious experience occurring. (Other than just mouthing the\nexpression, \u201cI am now imagining activity in these circuits\nwithout selective attention/the effects of short-term memory/vivid\ndreaming/\u2026\u201d).\n\nA second focus of skeptical arguments about a complete neuroscientific\nexplanation of consciousness is on sensory qualia: the\nintrospectable qualitative aspects of sensory experience, the features\nby which subjects discern similarities and differences among their\nexperiences. The colors of visual sensations are a philosopher\u2019s\nfavorite example. One famous puzzle about color qualia is the alleged\nconceivability of spectral inversions. Many philosophers claim that it\nis conceptually possible (if perhaps physically impossible) for two\nhumans not to differ neurophysiologically, while the color that fire\nengines and tomatoes appear to have to one subject is the color that\ngrass and frogs appear to have to the other (and vice versa). A large\namount of neuroscientifically-informed philosophy has addressed this\nquestion. (C.L. Hardin 1988 and Austen Clark 1993 are noteworthy\nexamples.) A related area where neurophilosophical considerations have\nemerged concerns the metaphysics of colors themselves (rather than\ncolor experiences). A longstanding philosophical dispute is whether\ncolors are objective properties existing external to perceivers or\nrather identifiable as or dependent upon minds or nervous systems.\nSome neuroscientific work on this problem begins with characteristics\nof color experiences: for example, that color similarity judgments\nproduce color orderings that align on a circle (Clark 1993). With this\nresource, one can seek mappings of phenomenology onto environmental or\nphysiological regularities. Identifying colors with particular\nfrequencies of electromagnetic radiation does not preserve the\nstructure of the hue circle, whereas identifying colors with activity\nin opponent processing neurons does. Such a tidbit is not decisive for\nthe color objectivist-subjectivist debate, but it does convey the type\nof neurophilosophical work being done on traditional metaphysical\nissues beyond the philosophy of mind. (For more details on these\nissues, see the\n entry on color\n in this Encyclopedia.)\n\nWe saw in the discussion of Hardcastle (1997) two sections above that\nneurophilosophers have entered disputes about the nature and\nmethodological import of pain experiences. Two decades earlier, Dan\nDennett (1978) took up the question of whether it is possible to build\na computer that feels pain. He compares and notes tension between\nneurophysiological discoveries and common sense intuitions about pain\nexperience. He suspects that the incommensurability between scientific\nand common sense views is due to incoherence in the latter. His\nattitude is wait-and-see. But foreshadowing Churchland\u2019s reply\nto Chalmers, Dennett favors scientific investigations over\nconceivability-based philosophical arguments.\n\nNeurological deficits have attracted philosophers interested in\nconsciousness. For nearly fifty years philosophers have debated\nimplications for the unity of the self of the Nobel Prize-winning\nexperiments with commissurotomy patients who, for clinical reasons,\nhad their corpus callosum surgically ablated (Nagel\n 1971).[12]\n The corpus callosum is the huge bundle of axons connecting neurons\nacross the left and right mammalian cerebral hemispheres. In carefully\ncontrolled experiments, commissurotomy patients seemingly display two\ndissociable \u201cseats\u201d of consciousness. Elizabeth Schechter\n(2018) has recently greatly updated philosophical treatment of the\nscientific details of these \u201csplit-brain\u201d patients,\nincluding their own experiential reports, and has traced implications\nfor our understanding of the self. \n\nIn chapter 5 of her (1986) book, Patricia Churchland extended both the\nrange and philosophical implications of neurological deficits. One\ndeficit she discusses in detail is blindsight. Some patients with\nlesions to primary visual cortex report being unable to see items in\nregions of their visual fields, yet perform far better than chance in\nforced guess trials about stimuli in those regions. A variety of\nscientific and philosophical interpretations have been offered. Ned\nBlock (1995) worried that many of these interpretations conflate\ndistinct notions of consciousness. He labels these notions\n\u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d (\u201cP-consciousness\u201d)\nand \u201caccess consciousness\u201d\n(\u201cA-consciousness\u201d). The former is the \u201cwhat it is\nlike\u201d-ness of conscious experiences. The latter is the\navailability of representational content to self-initiated action and\nspeech. Block argued that P-consciousness is not always\nrepresentational, whereas A-consciousness is. Dennett (1991, 1995) and\nTye (1993) are skeptical of non-representational analyses of\nconsciousness in general. They provide accounts of blindsight that do\nnot depend on Block\u2019s distinction.\n\nWe break off our brief overview of neurophilosophical work on\nconsciousness here. Many other topics are worth neurophilosophical\npursuit. We mentioned commissurotomy and the unity of consciousness\nand the self, which continues to generate discussion. Qualia beyond\nthose of color and pain experiences quickly attracted\nneurophilosophical attention (Akins 1993a,b, 1996; Austen Clark 1993),\nas did self-consciousness (Berm\u00fadez 1998).\n",
