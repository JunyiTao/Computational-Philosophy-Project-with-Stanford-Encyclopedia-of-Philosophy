The Discipline of Phenomenology\n\n\nThe discipline of phenomenology is defined by its domain of study,\nits methods, and its main results.\n\n\nPhenomenology studies structures of conscious experience as\nexperienced from the first-person point of view, along with relevant\nconditions of experience. The central structure of an experience is its\nintentionality, the way it is directed through its content or meaning\ntoward a certain object in the world.\n\n\nWe all experience various types of experience including perception,\nimagination, thought, emotion, desire, volition, and action. Thus, the\ndomain of phenomenology is the range of experiences including these\ntypes (among others). Experience includes not only relatively passive\nexperience as in vision or hearing, but also active experience as in\nwalking or hammering a nail or kicking a ball. (The range will be\nspecific to each species of being that enjoys consciousness; our focus\nis on our own, human, experience. Not all conscious beings will, or\nwill be able to, practice phenomenology, as we do.)\n\n\nConscious experiences have a unique feature: we experience\nthem, we live through them or perform them. Other things in the world\nwe may observe and engage. But we do not experience them, in the sense\nof living through or performing them. This experiential or first-person\nfeature\u2014that of being experienced\u2014is an essential part\nof the nature or structure of conscious experience: as we say, \u201cI see /\nthink / desire / do \u2026\u201d This feature is both a phenomenological\nand an ontological feature of each experience: it is part of what it is\nfor the experience to be experienced (phenomenological) and part of\nwhat it is for the experience to be (ontological).\n\n\nHow shall we study conscious experience? We reflect on various types\nof experiences just as we experience them. That is to say, we proceed\nfrom the first-person point of view. However, we do not normally\ncharacterize an experience at the time we are performing it. In many\ncases we do not have that capability: a state of intense anger or fear,\nfor example, consumes all of one\u2019s psychic focus at the time. Rather,\nwe acquire a background of having lived through a given type of\nexperience, and we look to our familiarity with that type of\nexperience: hearing a song, seeing a sunset, thinking about love,\nintending to jump a hurdle. The practice of phenomenology assumes such\nfamiliarity with the type of experiences to be characterized.\nImportantly, also, it is types of experience that phenomenology\npursues, rather than a particular fleeting experience\u2014unless\nits type is what interests us.\n\n\nClassical phenomenologists practiced some three distinguishable\nmethods. (1) We describe a type of experience just as we find it in our\nown (past) experience. Thus, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty spoke of pure\ndescription of lived experience. (2) We interpret a type of experience\nby relating it to relevant features of context. In this vein, Heidegger\nand his followers spoke of hermeneutics, the art of interpretation in\ncontext, especially social and linguistic context. (3) We analyze the\nform of a type of experience. In the end, all the classical\nphenomenologists practiced analysis of experience, factoring out\nnotable features for further elaboration.\n\n\nThese traditional methods have been ramified in recent decades,\nexpanding the methods available to phenomenology. Thus: (4) In a\nlogico-semantic model of phenomenology, we specify the truth conditions\nfor a type of thinking (say, where I think that dogs chase cats) or the\nsatisfaction conditions for a type of intention (say, where I intend or\nwill to jump that hurdle). (5) In the experimental paradigm of\ncognitive neuroscience, we design empirical experiments that tend to\nconfirm or refute aspects of experience (say, where a brain scan shows\nelectrochemical activity in a specific region of the brain thought to\nsubserve a type of vision or emotion or motor control). This style of\n\u201cneurophenomenology\u201d assumes that conscious experience is grounded in\nneural activity in embodied action in appropriate \nsurroundings\u2014mixing pure phenomenology with biological and physical science in a way\nthat was not wholly congenial to traditional phenomenologists.\n\n\nWhat makes an experience conscious is a certain awareness one has of\nthe experience while living through or performing it. This form of\ninner awareness has been a topic of considerable debate, centuries\nafter the issue arose with Locke\u2019s notion of self-consciousness on the\nheels of Descartes\u2019 sense of consciousness (conscience,\nco-knowledge). Does this awareness-of-experience consist in a kind of\ninner observation of the experience, as if one were doing two things at\nonce? (Brentano argued no.) Is it a higher-order perception of one\u2019s\nmind\u2019s operation, or is it a higher-order thought about one\u2019s mental\nactivity? (Recent theorists have proposed both.) Or is it a different\nform of inherent structure? (Sartre took this line, drawing on Brentano\nand Husserl.) These issues are beyond the scope of this article, but\nnotice that these results of phenomenological analysis shape the\ncharacterization of the domain of study and the methodology appropriate\nto the domain. For awareness-of-experience is a defining trait of\nconscious experience, the trait that gives experience a first-person,\nlived character. It is that lived character of experience that allows a\nfirst-person perspective on the object of study, namely, experience,\nand that perspective is characteristic of the methodology of\nphenomenology.\n\n\nConscious experience is the starting point of phenomenology, but\nexperience shades off into less overtly conscious phenomena. As Husserl\nand others stressed, we are only vaguely aware of things in the margin\nor periphery of attention, and we are only implicitly aware of the\nwider horizon of things in the world around us. Moreover, as Heidegger\nstressed, in practical activities like walking along, or hammering a\nnail, or speaking our native tongue, we are not explicitly conscious of\nour habitual patterns of action. Furthermore, as psychoanalysts have\nstressed, much of our intentional mental activity is not conscious at\nall, but may become conscious in the process of therapy or\ninterrogation, as we come to realize how we feel or think about\nsomething. We should allow, then, that the domain of \nphenomenology\u2014our own experience\u2014spreads out from conscious\nexperience into semi-conscious and even unconscious mental activity,\nalong with relevant background conditions implicitly invoked in our\nexperience. (These issues are subject to debate; the point here is to\nopen the door to the question of where to draw the boundary of the\ndomain of phenomenology.)\n\n\nTo begin an elementary exercise in phenomenology, consider some\ntypical experiences one might have in everyday life, characterized in\nthe first person:\n\nI see that fishing boat off the coast as dusk descends over the\nPacific.\nI hear that helicopter whirring overhead as it approaches the\nhospital.\nI am thinking that phenomenology differs from psychology.\nI wish that warm rain from Mexico were falling like last week.\nI imagine a fearsome creature like that in my nightmare.\nI intend to finish my writing by noon.\nI walk carefully around the broken glass on the sidewalk.\nI stroke a backhand cross-court with that certain underspin.\nI am searching for the words to make my point in conversation.\n\n\n\nHere are rudimentary characterizations of some familiar types of\nexperience. Each sentence is a simple form of phenomenological\ndescription, articulating in everyday English the structure of the type\nof experience so described. The subject term \u201cI\u201d indicates the\nfirst-person structure of the experience: the intentionality proceeds\nfrom the subject. The verb indicates the type of intentional activity\ndescribed: perception, thought, imagination, etc. Of central importance\nis the way that objects of awareness are presented or intended in our\nexperiences, especially, the way we see or conceive or think about\nobjects. The direct-object expression (\u201cthat fishing boat off the\ncoast\u201d) articulates the mode of presentation of the object in the\nexperience: the content or meaning of the experience, the core of what\nHusserl called noema. In effect, the object-phrase expresses the noema\nof the act described, that is, to the extent that language has\nappropriate expressive power. The overall form of the given sentence\narticulates the basic form of intentionality in the experience:\nsubject-act-content-object.\n\n\nRich phenomenological description or interpretation, as in Husserl,\nMerleau-Ponty et al., will far outrun such simple\nphenomenological descriptions as above. But such simple descriptions\nbring out the basic form of intentionality. As we interpret the\nphenomenological description further, we may assess the relevance of\nthe context of experience. And we may turn to wider conditions of the\npossibility of that type of experience. In this way, in the practice of\nphenomenology, we classify, describe, interpret, and analyze structures\nof experiences in ways that answer to our own experience.\n\n\nIn such interpretive-descriptive analyses of experience, we\nimmediately observe that we are analyzing familiar forms of\nconsciousness, conscious experience of or about this or that.\nIntentionality is thus the salient structure of our experience, and\nmuch of phenomenology proceeds as the study of different aspects of\nintentionality. Thus, we explore structures of the stream of\nconsciousness, the enduring self, the embodied self, and bodily action.\nFurthermore, as we reflect on how these phenomena work, we turn to the\nanalysis of relevant conditions that enable our experiences to occur as\nthey do, and to represent or intend as they do. Phenomenology then\nleads into analyses of conditions of the possibility of intentionality,\nconditions involving motor skills and habits, background social\npractices, and often language, with its special place in human\naffairs.\n",
