    "main_text": "Relations between Scientific Disciplines: From Theory Reduction to Mechanism Integration || Theory Reduction\n5.1 Theory Reduction\nAccording to Nagel (1961), reduction is a species of covering-law\nexplanation: one theory is reduced to another when it is possible to\nidentify the theoretical terms of the first with those of the second\nand to literally derive the first from the second. On the assumption\nthat scientific disciplines and theories correspond to one another,\nreduction serves as a model of interdisciplinary integration as well.\nMechanist\u2019s objections to the covering-law model of constitutive\nexplanation (i.e., micro-reduction) are discussed above\n(see Section 3.1); here the focus is rather\non how distinct disciplines of science are integrated.\nOn the Nagel view, reduction is an interlevel relationship. It is\nalso a relationship between theories. Theories about phenomena at a\nhigher level (e.g., gases, lightning, and life) are reduced to (i.e.,\nderived from) theories about phenomena at lower levels (e.g.,\nmolecules, electrons, and physiological systems). Finally, the\nrelationship is formally specified and has little to do with either\nthe content of the theories or the material structures those theories\ndescribe. From the mechanistic perspective, each of these features of\nthe Nagel model is problematic.\n",
