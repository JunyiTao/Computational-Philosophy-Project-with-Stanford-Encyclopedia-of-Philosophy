    "main_text": "Western Han (202 BCE\u20139 CE) || Political Thought: Lu Jia and Jia Yi\n2.1 Political Thought: Lu Jia and Jia Yi\n\nPolitical philosophy was central to the Han Dynasty from its very\nbeginning. In the Han Shu (Book of the Han), we read that the\nfirst Han emperor, Gaozu (formerly Liu Bang, 256\u2013195 BCE),\ncommissioned a number of scholars to construct texts on subjects\nvaluable for the operation of empire. Lu Jia (d. 170 BCE), one of\nGaozu\u2019s ministers, wrote the Xinyu (\u201cNew\nDiscussions\u201d), the earliest extant treatise on political\nphilosophy and practical government of the Han period. The\norganization of the text follows a pattern that would become common in\npolitical texts throughout the period and into later Chinese history.\nIt begins with theoretical foundations discussing the connection of\npolitical concerns to broader metaphysical concerns, then expands on\nthis to show how the practical application of political ideas\nfollows.\n\nThe first chapter of the Xinyu discusses the foundation of\nthe political project (and the human project more generally) in\nnature, or \u201cheaven\u201d (tian \u5929), borrowing a\nwell-known and contentious concept from earlier Chinese philosophical\ndiscourse. The dao \u9053 (way) of proper action and\ngovernance here is associated with understanding the patterns\n(li \u7406) of heaven and earth. Lu Jia offers a\n\u201crealist\u201d conception of political and ethical principles\n(which early Chinese thinkers see as continuous for the most part).\nThese principles are based in the mind-independent world, rather than\ndependent on human construction. Of course, the distinction between\nmind and world is not heavily stressed in early China. Although early\nChinese philosophers did draw a distinction between mind and body\n(Slingerland 2019; McLeod 2021), we do not find the strong distinction\nbetween mind-dependence and independence that ground conceptions of\nantirealism and realism in contemporary Western philosophical\ndiscourse. The construction of dao (as political and ethical\nprinciples) is dependent on the nature of the world, including facts\nabout patterns (li) as they exist within and determine human\nactivity. Both \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d, that is,\nare responsible for the dao. This is expressed in the\nXinyu as a matter of the ancient sages\u2019 expression of\nwhat they discern in the cosmos/heaven (tian). Lu Jia gives\nus a succinct explanation of this:\n\n\nIn order to determine the Way (dao) of human beings, the\nfirst sage looked up to observe Heaven\u2019s pattern, looked down to\nexamine the configuration of the ground, and then delineated the\nhexagrams Qian and Kun. The people began to become aware, understood\nthe affection between father and son, right conduct between ruler and\nminister, separation between men and women, and proper order of senior\nand junior. Thereupon the numerous offices were established and the\nKingly Way was born. (Xinyu 1.6, Goldin and Sabattini [trans]\n2020: 23)\n\n\nAfter this initial establishment of the Way based on understanding the\npatterns inherent in the world and human nature, more conventional\nnorms still proved necessary. All of the particular manifestations of\nculture were then created by various sages, including the well-known\nConfucian concepts li \u79ae (ritual) and yi\n\u7fa9 (appropriateness). The first stage of construction of the Way\nrequired the coordination of the sage and the patterns of the\nworld\u2014the sage had to make known and usable these patterns.\nAfter this, a more \u201cantirealist\u201d conception was\noffered\u2014more conventional moral and political norms still had to\nbe created from this more basic and abstract conception of the Way.\nThe sages thus established ritual (li \u79ae) and\nappropriateness (yi \u7fa9). Through the sages\u2019\nconstruction of institutions and social systems, as well as their\nmoral and political instruction, they helped people to follow the\nWay.\n\nLu Jia did not treat ethics and politics as distinct from one another\nor from human culture (wen \u6587) more generally. The\nhuman dao includes elements we might distinguish as\npolitical, ethical, aesthetic, etc. Thus, music and dress are\ndiscussed in terms of \u201cproper\u201d and \u201cimproper\u201d,\nalongside considerations of respect for elders and superiors, and\nother principles that we would consider political and ethical. Neglect\nof one of them would inevitably lead to decay in the others.\n\nFollowing the example or direction of the sage is continually\nnecessary because of the human tendency to diverge from the\ndao, according to Lu Jia (Xinyu 1). Seemingly\ninfluenced by the Xunzi and legalist texts such as\nHanfeizi and Shangjunshu, Lu Jia held that having\nthe right structure between ruler and ministers was key to maintaining\norder of the state and moral action. Most importantly, the ministers\nwho serve under a ruler must be morally upright. The ideal ruler,\nfollowing earlier Daoist and Confucian ideas, should be\n\u201cnon-active\u201d (wu wei \u7121\u70ba), employing\nthe right people with the proper motivations and abilities, to ensure\nthe commitment of the rest of society to moral activity. The ministers\nwork in this way as exemplars and influences on those below in\nsociety.\n\nJia Yi (200\u2013168 BCE) was a Han official who served as tutor to a\nnumber of vassal kings associated with the Han\u2014first to the\nruler of the distant southern region of Changsha, and later to the\nruler of the region of Liang (more on this system of government below\nin discussion of the Huainanzi). His political thought is\npresented in the text Xinshu (\u201cNew Writings\u201d).\nDespite debates as to whether the Xinshu was written by Jia\nor later authors in his name, we can take it as representative of an\nimportant strain of Han political thought (Sanft 2005: 6).\n\nThe most famous section of the Xinshu is Jia Yi\u2019s\ncriticism of the Qin, the first imperial dynasty of China which\nunified the \u201cWarring States\u201d in 221 BCE. Jia\u2019s\ncriticism stresses the Qin state\u2019s failure to treat the people\n(min \u6c11) with sufficient consideration. The Qin\u2019s\nharsh treatment of people led to the loss of the obedience required to\nmaintain order in a state. Jia Yi stressed that successful rule was\nonly possible with the consent and obedience of the people\u2014a\nposition referred to as \u201ctaking the people as root\u201d\n(min ben \u6c11\u672c). Jia wrote about the Qin\nrulers:\n\n\n[They] made penalties many and punishments severe. The officers\u2019\nhandling of cases was harsh to an extreme. Rewards and punishments\nwere not appropriate and taxation lacked proper measure. (translated\nin Sanft 2016: 54)\n\n\nTo ensure successful rule, a ruler must govern with\n\u201chumanenness\u201d (ren \u4ec1), a concern for the\nwellbeing of the people that was a major topic of discussion in\nPre-Han Confucian texts. Unlike these earlier Confucians, however, Jia\nYi\u2019s interest in humaneness was mainly with its practical\nbenefits for ensuring the stability of the ruler\u2019s position.\nEarlier Confucians were more concerned with the issue of moral\ndevelopment and the role of humaneness in the development of the\nperson. Jia Yi\u2019s concern with humaneness was about political\nexpediency. Lacking humaneness, as he claims the Qin rulers did, will\ninevitably lead to the collapse of one\u2019s rule. Securing the\ncooperation and support of the people is necessary to maintain a\nstate, and thus the good ruler must attend to this. (Sanft 2005:\n35\u20136) While concern for the people is necessary, Jia does not\ntake the assent of the people to being governed as the ground or\njustification for the ruler\u2019s authority. This authority,\naccording to Jia, is independent of the people. The \u201cpeople as\nroot\u201d position developed in the Xinshu is fully based\nin pragmatic considerations of rulership. In this way, Jia Yi links\nthe ideas developed in early Confucian texts with the pragmatic\n\u201camoralism\u201d of Legalists like Han Feizi who argued for the\nappropriateness of political strategies on the basis of their success\nin maintaining the power of the ruler, rather than on the basis of\nmoral considerations. Jia\u2019s political thought thus represents a\nnew trend in the Han period, one that forms the basis for the ideology\nof what Dingxin Zhao calls \u201cthe Confucian-Legalist state\u201d\n(Zhao 2015). The origins of the political philosophy that would guide\nChinese dynasties through much of the rest of Chinese history are\nfound in the Han.\n",
