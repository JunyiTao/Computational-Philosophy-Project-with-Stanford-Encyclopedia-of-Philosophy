    "main_text": "Movable and Mover\n15. Movable and Mover\n\nBook VII begins with the statement \u201cWhatever is moving must be\nmoved by something\u201d (Phys. 241b24), and Averroes\ncomments on it: \u201cIn this treatise [Aristotle] searched whether\nevery movable has a mover\u201d, and he points out that Aristotle has\nin mind those movables in which the mover is not clearly distinguished\nfrom the movable, \u201cas in the four elements\u201d (ut\nin, LC Schmieja7 1:20\u20132:1; absque, \u201cexcept\nfor\u201d, LC 306B\n T1).[15]\n\nLater, in Book VIII, Averroes considers that Book VII did not deal\nwith motion because of \u2018leaning\u2019 in particular, and that\nBook VIII finishes the task. In this book he classifies essential\nmotions in two kinds: violent and natural, and he divides the latter\nin \u2018motion because of the soul\u2019 and \u2018motion because\nof leaning\u2019 (declinatio: Arabic mail), which\nincludes gravity and levity, that is, the motion of the elements to\ntheir natural place (LC 366D TC28). Since natural motion of the four\nelements seems to happen by itself, Aristotle put forward several\narguments to prove that they are not moved by themselves\n(Phys. VIII, 255a1\u2013b30) but the chapter ends\nacknowledging that \u201c[the element] possesses a principle of\nmotion in itself, although not of setting in motion nor of acting but\nof being affected\u201d.\n\nAverroes examines the sentence and interprets it in a sense that he\nconsiders to be Aristotelian. The simple element has two movers, an\nessential and an accidental one (LC 370B TC32). What moves essentially\nis\n\n\nthat which is external, that is, the generating [cause;\ngenerans : mukawwin] and the generating\n[cause] is that which gives its form and all the accidents resultant\nfrom the form\u2014one of which is the local motion\u2014to the\ngenerated simple body. (LC 370G\n TC32)[16]\n\n\nGenerating acts upon matter and in this manner, Averroes places the\nprinciple of motion in it, because matter is \u201cthat in which the\ntrue potentiality for motion is, that is, the potentiality for\nreceiving motion\u201d (LC 370H). The issue was of import in Arabic\nand Jewish natural philosophy (MC Wolfson 669\u2013675), while the\nLatin thinkers were most interested in the question how the four\nelements remain in the mixture, a question that Averroes also wanted\nto answer (Maier 1952: 28\u201331).\n\nAverroes discusses two points related to the mentioned issue of how\nthe four elements are moved. First, Galen maintained that the\narguments brought to support the thesis \u201cWhatever is moving must\nbe moved by something\u201d are false. Second, other commentators\nconsidered Book VII redundant, because VIII deals with the same\nsubject in a more comprehensive way (LC 306C; LC Schmieja7\n2:1\u20134), and actually, Book VII pleads that there is a first\nmover which is not moved by anything else. Averroes\u2019 discussion\ngoes as follows:\n\n1) To prove that \u201cWhatever is moving must be moved by\nsomething\u201d, Aristotle chose a body \u201cA_B which is moving\nper se, and not by virtue of some part\u201d\n(241b37\u201338). Averroes carefully distinguishes movable\nessentially, per se or accidentally, per accidens\nand movable as a whole or by virtue of some part (LC 306F; LC\nSchmieja7 2:19\u20133:1). He gives us an instance of that which moves\nby itself but not as a whole:\n\n\nThus the first essentially movable (primum motum) in animals\nis the heart which does not move as a whole, because one part of it\nmoves itself, and moves the whole. (LC 306F; LC Schmieja7\n3:1\u20133)\n\n\nThe whole does not move itself, only one part moves essentially, but\nthe whole here is a composite the parts of which are continuous.\n\nAristotle argued that if a body moves as a whole, primarily and\nessentially, it need not stop moving because something else has\nstopped moving. And if something is at rest because something else has\nstopped moving, that thing must be moved by something (Phys.\nVII.1, 241b44 [Ross 1936: 419).\n\nFor Averroes, Galen and others misinterpreted Aristotle. They\nidentified that which is only contrary to that which moves\naccidentally with that which moves essentially (LC 307H; LC Schmieja7\n6:3\u20136). Indeed that which moves essentially (and as a whole) is\nopposed to that which is moved by virtue of one part of it. In\nGalen\u2019s view, if one part of a movable would come to rest, the\nwhole should not. In the case of the heart of the animals, Galen\ncontested the doctrine that it is the first movable because when the\nheart is removed, the animal is still capable of walking two steps.\nGalen claimed that the head is the source of motion, but Averroes\nobjects \u201cI saw a ram walking after the head was cut off\u201d\n(LC 309C TC4; LC Schmieja7 11:21\u201322). But there are primary\nmovables that fulfill these conditions and it is worth quoting\nAverroes\u2019 words:\n\n\nThere must be here first movables because natural bodies do not divide\ninfinitely into that for which they are natural bodies, e.g., because\nthe first movable in fire is the minimal part that is capable of being\nfire in actuality. (LC 307I TC2; LC Schmieja7, 6:10\u201313)\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s arguments were not very satisfying and the question\nwhich are the bodies moving per se and as a whole was not\nanswered. Galen considered that the arguments were flawed, but\nAverroes would never accept that Aristotle was wrong and made an\ninterpretation, that we cannot guess whatever the Master would agree\nupon.\n\nRuth Glasner has shown evidence that Averroes borrowed the notion of\nminimal parts from Alexander; she stresses the import of the new\ndoctrine that \u201cbridges the gap between the two opposing systems,\nthe Aristotelian and the atomistic\u201d (Glasner 2009:\n146\u2013159). Whether the smallest part actually exists or it is the\nlimit of divisibility is something that Averroes does not answer. The\ncontext, however, hints at the second direction.\n\nTherefore, Averroes sees the Book VII essential in order to prove that\n\u201cWhatever is moving must be moved by something\u201d and the\nLatin medieval philosophers will make of the statement Omne quod\nmovetur necesse est ab aliquo moveri a basic principle of\nmedieval physics.\n\n2) At the beginning, Averroes complained that some commentators\nconsidered Book VII superfluous, and in LC 312C TC9 (LC Schmieja7\n20:15\u201318), he refers to Themistius as the main one. The final\narguments of Phys. VII.1 establish the impossibility of an\nendless succession of movables and movers and, by reductio ad\nabsurdum, the necessity of a first mover. Consider the\nfollowing version of Is\u1e25\u0101q\u2019s passage 243a3\u20134\n(textus alter): \u201cThe first mover is not such because it is\nthat for the sake of which [motion happens] but because it is that\nfrom which the source of motion is\u201d (LC 311H;\n\u1e6cab\u012b\u02bba [1964: 746: 3\u20136]). However M.\nScot translates the passage differently: \u201cThe first movable is not\nsuch because it is that for the sake of which [motion happens] but\nbecause it is that from which the source of motion is\u201d (LC 311K; LC\nSchmieja7 18:18\u201320). Averroes\u2019s copy of the\nPhysics was wrong and he hesitates: \u201cMaybe there is an\nerror by the copyist, who should have placed the term\n\u2018mover\u2019 instead of this term \u2018movable\u2019\u201d\n(LC 312 AB; LC Schmieja7 20:3\u20134 [more precise to my view]).\n\nIn spite of the hesitation caused by the wrong term, Averroes\ninterpreted that Aristotle distinguished here between a mover setting\nin motion as a final cause or as an efficient cause (quasi\nagens), and that Book VIII would clarify the matter concerning\nthe first mover. He was even more certain in asserting that Book VIII\nwould inquire about first motion, whether it is eternal or generated,\nand he rejected Themistius\u2019 view that Book VII was superfluous\nfor this reason.\n",
