Normality Theories\n\nThe reconstructions of exclusive cp-laws in terms of strict\ncompletions do not imply anything about the probability with\nwhich undisturbed antecedent-events will produce the consequent (cf.\nPietroski and Rey 1995, p. 84; Schiffer 1991, p. 8). According to\nproponents of normality theories this seems to be counterintuitive,\nbecause cp-laws should be asserted only if the situation without\n(non-negligible) disturbing factors is a normal or at least a\nrather probable situation. Examples of correct exclusive cp-laws which\nviolate this normality condition are, for example: \u201cexclusively\ncp, no tire blows out\u201d, \u201cexclusively cp, there are no\nclouds in the sky\u201d, etc. Several authors have therefore\ndeveloped so-called normality accounts of cp-laws, including\nSilverberg (1996), Earman and Roberts (1999, 463), Spohn (2002), Spohn\n(2012, chapter 13), and Schurz (2001b, 2002), who argues that the\nnormality interpretation is the preferred interpretation of exclusive\ncp-laws in the life sciences, from biology upwards to the\nsocial sciences.\n\nNormality theories can be understood as an alternative to the\n(definite and/or indefinite) exclusive interpretation of non-strict\nlaws. The general idea of normality theories is that \u201ccp, all\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s\u201d means that normally \\(A\\)s\nare \\(B\\)s. They can also be combined with a comparative\ninterpretation into normic-comparative law-statements such as\n\u201cnormally an increase of \\(X\\) leads to an increase of\n\\(Y\\) when other \\(X\\)-independent variables are held\nconstant\u201d. However, the normality accounts differ in their\nexplication of the notion of \u201cnormally\u201d. One possibility\n(suggested by Schurz 2001b, 2002, see section 8.1) is to explicate the\nnormality condition in terms of a high probability of the consequent\npredicate, given the antecedent predicate, where the underlying\nconditional probabilities are objective statistical probabilities\nbased on the dispositions of evolutionary systems. Another possibility\n(suggested by Spohn 2012, see section 8.2) is to explicate the\nnormality conditions in terms of degrees of belief and ranking\nfunctions over possible worlds.\n\nLargely independently of Schurz\u2019s and Spohn\u2019s specific\napproaches but in agreement with the general idea of the normality\napproach, H\u00fcttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko (2014),\nReutlinger (2014), Roberts (2014) and Strevens (2014) have recently\nexplored a statistical approach to cp-laws, according to which cp-law\nstatements are statistical claims.\n8.1. Normic laws and evolution\n\nSchurz (2001b; 2002, \u00a75) analyses cp-laws in non-physical\nsciences as normic laws of the form \u201c\\(A\\)s are\nnormally \\(B\\)s\u201d. Here are some examples (4* and 6* are the\nnormic reconstructions of 4 and 6 above):\n\n(4*) Birds normally can fly.\n\n\n(6*) People\u2019s actions are normally goal-oriented\n\n\n(15) Governments normally try to keep the economy of their country\nintact.\n\n\n(16) Turning the ignition key normally turns on the engine of my car.\n\n\nAccording to the statistical consequence thesis, normic laws\nimply numerically unspecified statistical generalizations of the form\n\u201cMost \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s\u201d, by which they can be\nempirically tested. The statistical consequence thesis has been\nchallenged by cognitive scientists (e.g., McCarthy 1986) and by\nphilosophers of biology (e.g., Millikan 1984). Schurz (2001b) defends\nthe statistical consequence thesis by the following argument which is\nbased on the generalized theory of evolution that does not only apply\nto biological evolution but also to cultural evolution (cf. Mesoudi\net al. 2006 for an excellent overview on generalized\nevolution theory; see Str\u00f6\u00dfner 2015 for a recent\ndiscussion).\n\nThe common domain of the life sciences (which, according to Schurz,\ninclude biology, psychology as well as the social sciences and the\nhumanities) are evolutionary systems or their products. Evolutionary\nsystems are systems whose self-regulatory properties have been\ngradually selected according to their contribution to reproductive\nsuccess. The temporal persistence of self-regulatory systems is\ngoverned by a certain range of prototypical norm states, in\nwhich these systems constantly have to be in order to stay alive. They\nmanage this with the help of regulatory mechanisms which\ncompensate for disturbing influences of the environment.\nAlthough the self-regulatory capacities of evolutionary systems are\nthe product of a long adaptation history, they are not perfect.\nDysfunctions may occur, whence their normic behavior may have various\nexceptions. Yet, it must be the case that these systems are\nin their prototypical norm states in the high statistical\nmajority of cases and times, since otherwise, they would not have\nsurvived in evolution.\n\nIn this way, the evolution-theoretic foundation of normic laws does\nnot only explain why normic laws are the typical form of the laws of\nlife sciences. It also explains why normic laws are not strict but\nnevertheless are associated with high conditional statistical\nprobabilities, at least for most cases and times in evolution.\n\nAccording to Schurz (2002), the difference between idealization\nconditions in physics and normality conditions in evolutionary\nsciences can be explained as follows: In physics, one traditionally\nthinks of complexity as a source of\ndisorder\u2014regularities are obtained by abstracting\naway from complexities. In evolutionary systems, by contrast,\ncomplexity is usually a source of\norder\u2014complexity which has been selected by\nevolution to stabilize normic behavior. As Wachbroit (1994, 587f.)\nputs it, ideal planets are theoretical abstractions: mass points under\nthe influence of a centripetal force and \u2018nothing else\u2019.\nThey do not literally exist. In contrast, normal birds really\ndo exist because they are what has been selected through\nevolution. When speaking of a normal bird, we do not abstract from its\nadmirable complexity, but we rely on it as the cause of its\nnormal behavior. This does not mean that abstract laws of physics\n(e.g., the laws of aerodynamics) play no role in the explanation of\nfunctional behaviors of evolutionary systems (e.g., that birds can\nfly). However, even when we explain a bird\u2019s flying ability in\nterms of the laws of aerodynamics, we still have to assume a\n\u2018normal\u2019 bird which possesses the typical capabilities of\nbirds that have been selected through evolution. The idealization\nprocedures needed for planets would not make good sense for birds:\nthere are no disturbing parameters which, when going to zero, turn a\nreal bird into an ideal bird which can necessarily fly and which is\napproximated by the real bird.\n8.2. Normal conditions approach\n\nAnother way to understand \u201cceteris paribus\u201d as\nreferring to normal conditions is introduced by Wolfgang Spohn (1997,\nsection 5; 2002, section 4; 2012, chapter 13.2; 2014). Spohn takes the\nconnection between ceteris paribus qualifications and\nnormality to be straightforward: \u201cceteris\nparibus\u201d means other things being normal. Let us\ncall this the Normal Condition Approach. The basic idea of\nthe Normal Conditions Approach is that a cp-law \\(L\\) holds when\nnormal conditions obtain. Spohn characterizes normal conditions as\n\u201cexactly those conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain\n[\u2026] in the small space-time region inhabited by us\u201d\n(Spohn 1997, 278). Translated in probabilistic terms, the expression\n\u201cconditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain\u201d means\nthat the occurrence of some conditions is highly\nprobable.\n\nFor Spohn, a condition is \u201cnormal\u201d if it is (i) expected\nor (ii) at least not ruled out to obtain by a rational, epistemic\nagent (for formal definitions of normal and exceptional conditions cf.\nSpohn 2002, section 4, and Spohn 2012, chapter 13.4). He illustrates\nhis Normal Conditions Approach with Hooke\u2019s Law:\n\nHooke\u2019s law, for instance, about the proportionality of the\nforce applied to a spring and its extension. It needs qualifications\nin many ways, as was clear from the outset, even though the\nqualifications could be neither fully nor precisely specified. One\nmust not overstretch the spring, the material the spring is made of\nmust be elastic and homogeneous, its shape regular, the thermal\ndistribution uniform, etc. Physicists have cleared up most of the\nconditions\u2014all of them?\u2014under which Hooke\u2019s law\nholds and provided deeper explanation in terms of the intermolecular\nforces within a molecular lattice. After all, our sophisticated\ntechnology of spring balances that is (or was) used in each lab and\neach deli-shop depends on it. (Spohn 2012, 305)\n\n\nSpohn concludes that Hooke\u2019s law holds under normal conditions\nand draws an analogy to other law statements in the special\nsciences:\n\nHooke\u2019s law holds under normal conditions, i.e., for diligently\nmanufactured springs handled with the usual care. The rules of thumb\nof folk psychology normally apply; this is why they are such\ntremendously useful common knowledge. Likewise, the laws of scientific\npsychology and of economics at best hold under the conditions\nexplicitly specified, along with further unspecified normal\nconditions. (Spohn 2012, 307)\n\n\nSpohn\u2019s Normal Conditions approach differs from Schurz\u2019s\nNormic Laws approach in at least two respects.\n\n\n\nAccording to Spohn (and contrary to Schurz\u2019s theory which refers\nto objective probabilities), the fact that normal conditions obtain is\nconceived epistemically and, more specifically, doxastically. An\nepistemic agent forms beliefs about the normality of conditions, i.e.,\nsomeone strongly believes that some condition obtains (cf. Spohn 2002,\n385).\n\nSpohn describes \u201cthe epistemic functioning\u201d of beliefs\n(doxastic states) about normality by modeling degrees of belief in\nterms of ranking functions (originally developed in Spohn 1988 under\nthe label \u201cordinal conditional functions\u201d; cf. also Spohn\n2012 and the SEP-entry \u2018Formal Representations of Belief\u2019,\nsection 3.3) \n\n\nNormality in Spohn\u2019s theory is explicated in terms of background\nconditions, not in terms of probabilistic relations between the\nantecedent predicate and the consequent predicate. If someone believes\nthat the law \\(f(X)=Y\\) holds, then she believes that\nthis functional relation holds under normal conditions \\(N\\), which\nmeans in terms of Spohn\u2019s ranking functions that the law\n\\(f(X)=Y\\) is believed with rank zero, i.e., it is\ntrue in all normal worlds of a ranked world model. Such a ranked world\nmodel consists of a set of possible worlds together with a ranking\nfunction which attaches to each world a natural number \\(0, 1, \\ldots ,n\\) specifying its rank. Worlds with rank 0 are the most normal\nworlds, worlds with rank 1 contain exceptions from normal conditions\n(1st degree exceptions), worlds with rank 2 exceptions from those\nexceptions (2nd degree exceptions), etc.\n\nSpohn (2014) is the most recent and in-depth elaboration of his normal\nconditions based \u201cepistemic account\u201d of ceteris\nparibus laws and conditions.  \n\n\nSince the normal conditions \u201c\\(N\\)\u201d express the\nproposition that the given situation or world is normal, it would seem\nthat the ranking-of-worlds account entails the possibility of a strict\ncompletion by adding the normality condition \\(N\\) to the\nantecedent: \u201cif \\(N\\), then \\(Y = f(X)\\)\u201d. Indeed, it follows from the truth condition\nfor the assertion \u201cnormally (or cp) \\(L\\)\u201d in a ranked\nworld model (where \\(L\\) is e.g., \\(Y = f(X))\\)\nthat there exists a proposition \\(N\\)\u2014namely the set of all\nworlds with rank 0\u2014such that \u201cnormally \\(L\\)\u201d is\ntrue in the given ranked model iff the material implication\n\\(N\\rightarrow L\\) is true in all worlds of this model. This does\nneither imply, however, that (a) the completing proposition \\(N\\)\ncan be linguistically expressed, nor (b) that it can be expressed in a\nnon-trivial way, in the sense that \\(N\\) does not already imply\n\\(L\\) on logical reasons alone. Since one can only speak of a\nstrict completion of \u201cnormally \\(L\\)\u201d if (a) and (b)\nhold, it follows that the ranking-of-worlds account does in fact not\nentail the possibility of a strict completion. This result is\nadequate, because as we have argued above, in most cases (especially\nin all non-deterministic situations) a strict completion is\nimpossible. Thus, it has to be kept in mind that speaking of\n\u201cnormality conditions\u201d does not imply that these\n\u201cnormality conditions\u201d can be expressed by any\n(non-trivial) proposition. For example, there is not any non-trivial\nproposition \\(N\\) which could turn the conditional \u201cnormally\na Cs\\(^{137}\\) atom decays after 60 years\u201d into a strict\nimplication of the form \u201cif \\(N\\), then a Cs\\(^{137}\\)\natom decays after 60 years\u201d. Also note that the ranked-worlds\naccounts and the conditional probability accounts are equivalent as a\nsemantics for logical axiomatizations of conditional reasoning (see\nsection 8.3).\n8.3. Ceteris paribus laws and non-monotonic reasoning\n\nReasoning from exclusive or normic cp-laws has an important logical\nfeature: the inferences are in contrast to deductively valid arguments\nnot monotonic. An inference is monotonic iff adding arbitrary\nnew premises to a valid argument preserves its validity. But the\ninference from an exclusive cp-law of the form \u201cexclusively cp,\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s\u201d and a singular statement\n\\(A(d)\\) (for \u201c\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)\u201d) to a\nconclusion \\(B(d)\\) is no longer correct if \\(d\\) is\nknown to instantiate a disturbing factor \\(D\\) which blocks the\nnomic connection between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For instance, the\nexclusive cp-law may state that if something is a bird (\\(A\\)), then it\nnormally can fly (\\(B\\)), and \\(D\\) may assert that the given\nbird-instance has broken wings.\n\nAssume the exclusive cp-law is formulated with the help of a\nnon-strict conditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\). Drawing correct\ninferences from non-strict conditionals requires non-classical rules\nof valid inferences: The non-monotonicity of Default Modus\nPonens means formally that although the inference from\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and \\(A(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is\ncorrect (i.e., \\(A\\rightarrow B, A(d) \\dproves B(d)\\) holds, where \u2018\\(\\dproves\\)\u2019 stands for\n\u2018non-monotonically correct inference\u2019), the inference from\nthe extended premise set \\(A\\rightarrow B,\nH\\rightarrow \\neg B, A(d)\\), and\n\\(H(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is incorrect (i.e.,\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\), A\\((d), H(d) \\dproves B(d))\\). These non-monotonic effects are reflected in\nnon-classical rules for inferences from conditionals to conditionals.\nFor example, take the inference from \u201cIf \\(A\\), then\n\\(B\\)\u201d to \u201cIf \\(A\\wedge D\\), then\n\\(B\\)\u201d (monotonicity \\(M)\\) or from \u201cIf \\(A\\),\nthen \\(B\\)\u201d and \u201cIf \\(B\\), then \\(D\\)\u201d to\n\u201cIf \\(A\\), then \\(D\\)\u201d (Cut \\(C)\\). Both\ninferences are valid for strict (logical or material) conditionals,\nbut they are not generally correct for non-strict conditionals. Only\nthe more cautious inferences from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\wedge D\\rightarrow B\\)\n(cautious monotonicity CM) or from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\wedge B\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\rightarrow D\\)\n(Cautious Cut CC) are correct for non-strict conditionals.\n\nTwo prominent semantic criteria for the truth of a non-strict\nconditional and the correctness of inference from non-strict\nconditionals have been suggested in the literature.\n\nThe high-probability-semantics understands normic laws in\nthe sense of high conditional probability assertions (as in section\n8.1). This semantics considers a non-strict conditional\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\) as true in a probability model if the\nuncertainty of the conditional, which is defined as 1 minus the\nconditional probability, is sufficiently low. An inference of a\nconclusion conditional from a set of premise conditionals is regarded\nas valid in this semantics iff the uncertainty of the conclusion\nconditional is not greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the\npremises. High probabilistic semantics goes back to Adams (1975) and\nhas been extended in Schurz (1998, 2005). \nThe second semantics, the normality-semantics,\ncorresponds to the normal-condition account (see section 8.2). This\nsemantics considers a conditional \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) as true in a\nranked-world-model iff all lowest-rank \\(A\\)-worlds are\n\\(B\\)-worlds. An inference is considered as valid in this semantics\niff all ranked-worlds-models which verify all premise conditionals\nverify the conclusion conditional. \n\n\nRemarkably, both semantics lead to the same conditional logics. Both\nsemantics possess the system \\(P\\) (\u201cpreferential\nentailment\u201d) as a correct and complete axiomatization of\ninferences among pure conditionals, and the system \\(R\\)\n(\u201crational entailment\u201d) for inferences among\ntruth-function combinations of conditionals (for more details cf.\nKraus et al. 1990, Hawthorne 1996, Adams 1975, Schurz 1998,\n2004, 2005, Leitgeb 2004, and the SEP-entry on non-monotonic\nlogic).\n9. Prima Facie Reasons and Ceteris Paribus Conditions in Ethics and Epistemology\n\nThe use of \u201ccp\u201d is not restricted to philosophy of\nscience. It is used in other areas of theoretical and practical\nphilosophy as well.\n\nFor instance, prima facie reasons are reasons under the\nconstraint of exclusive cp-conditions. They play an important role in\nethics and epistemology.\n\nIn ethics, a prima facie norm is an obligation (e.g.,\n\u201cprima facie, you should not hurt anybody\u201d) which\nholds as long as exceptional circumstances (e.g., defending your own\nlife) are absent (cf. Ross 1930 and the SEP-entry on moral reasoning).\nDancy (2004, 17, 35f) uses the expression \u201cpro\ntanto\u201d instead of \u201cprima facie\u201d, which\nis standardly used in the current debate. Pietroski (1993) has\npromoted the ceteris paribus understanding of moral\nobligations as a solution to paradoxes of moral obligations.\nEspecially for the solution of moral dilemmas, the cp-reading of moral\nobligations has proven to be helpful, because although two conflicting\ncp-obligations may block each other, they do not produce a strict\nconsistency in the sense of deductive logic (see Horty 1994).\n\nIn epistemology, a prima facie reason for a belief is a\nreason which justifies this belief in the absence of defeaters, i.e.,\nof exceptional information to the contrary. Prima facie\nreasons have been suggested in epistemology as a means of providing\nweak and defeasible a priori justifications for\nepistemologically fundamental beliefs such as the belief in the\nexistence of an external reality, for which a strict and non-circular\na priori-justification seems to be impossible. Nevertheless,\nthe inference from visual appearances to reality counts as defeasibly\njustified as long as there do not exist serious defeaters, i.e.,\nreasons for serious doubt (cf. Williams 1996, 2001, and the SEP-entry\non a priori-justification and knowledge). An example is the\ndefeasible inference from visual appearances to beliefs concerning\nexternal reality. My awareness of my visual appearance of a tree in\nfront of me is a prima facie reason for my belief that there\nreally is a tree in front of me, provided that information about\nexceptional circumstances is absent, for example the information that\nI am under the influence of drugs which cause hallucinations (cf.\nPollock 1986, Moser 2002). One may object that a similar kind of\npossible exception to the inference from visual appearances to reality\nis constituted by the possibility of a Cartesian demon who infuses\nhumans with illusionary perceptions, which is one of the major\nskeptical counterarguments to the inference from appearances to\nreality. In response to this objection, several epistemologists have\nargued that these kinds of exceptions are not serious exceptions, and\ntherefore, the inference from appearances to reality is defeasibly\nvalid.\n\nFinally, applications of cp-clauses can also be found in the form of\npresumptions in philosophy of language. Here it is assumed that\nunderstanding linguistic expressions requires defeasible assumptions\nor \u201cpresumptions\u201d, for example presumptions concerning the\nrationality of the speaker (cf. Quine 1960; Davidson 1973, Scholz\n2016, 148\u2013159).\n10. Ceteris Paribus Laws: Metaphysics, Language, and Science \n\nIn the current literature, a number of novel trends and innovative\napproaches to cp-laws have emerged that cannot easily be subsumed\nunder the already existing accounts. For this reason they deserve\nspecial mention. We believe there are at least four clearly\ndiscernable novel tendencies in the current work on cp-laws:\n\n\n\nA reconnection to metaphysics: One of the most salient trends\nin the current literature is that the discussion of cp-laws\n(re)connects philosophy of science to analytic metaphysics in at least\nthree respects: (i) current accounts of cp-laws make use of David\nLewis\u2019s (1973) best system account of laws; moreover, (ii) the\ninterpretation of objective probabilities and (iii) the metaphysics of\ndispositions are brought into play for making progress in\nunderstanding cp-law statements. \n\nThe most vivid sign of this reconnection consists in the fact that\nseveral authors have recently defended a friendly amendment of David\nLewis\u2019s best system account of laws of nature. While\nLewis\u2019s (1973, 73) original version primarily focuses on\nfundamental laws, the amended versions are intended to capture also\nnon-fundamental laws of the special sciences. Schrenk (2007a, 2014),\nCallender and Cohen (2009, 2010), and Frisch (2014a) defend a\nso-called \u201cbetter best system\u201d account of special science\nlaws. Unterhuber (2014) develops a version of the \u201cbetter best\nsystem\u201d account utilizing generics. Jaag and Loew (forthcoming)\nargue for a pragmatic version of the best systems account that\ncaptures also central insights of the \u201cbetter best system\u201d\ntheory. On their view, the universality of laws is not an end in\nitself. If a generalization\u2019s invariance is, e.g., limited to\nour cosmic epoch only, this limited invariance arguably would be\nenough to make it useful for us and thus a law according to this\naccount. Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and Reutlinger (2014) provide\na critical discussion of \u201cbetter best system\u201d accounts.\nBraddon-Mitchell (2001) and Wheeler (2018) present versions of a best\nsystems account deploying the idea of algorithmic compression from\ndata science. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2009) advocate a\n\u201cstatistical mechanical\u201d version of the best systems\napproach to special science laws which is, unlike the \u201cbetter\nbest system\u201d account, committed to a particular\nBoltzmann-inspired interpretation of statistical mechanics (including\nassumptions about the early history of the universe). Weslake (2014)\nand Frisch (2014b) provide critical responses, while Fenton-Glynn\n(2016) constructively uses examples by Albert and Loewer for an\nanalysis of cp-laws. Finally, Albert and Loewer\u2019s account also\nconnects the debate on cp-laws with the on-going discussion on whether\ncausation has a place in fundamental physics or whether causation is\nan \u2018emergent\u2019 phenomenon captured by the cp-law statements\nof the special sciences (Price and Corry 2007 and Frisch 2014b are\nrepresentative of the opposing views in the debate on causation in\nphysics).\n\nAlso other metaphysical issues besides Lewis\u2019s account of\nlawhood influence the recent literature on cp-laws. The metaphysics of\nprobabilities and disposition stand out in this respect. Taking up\nresults from Earman and Roberts (1999) and Schurz (2002), several\nauthors including H\u00fcttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko\n(2014), Roberts (2014), Reutlinger (2014), and Strevens (2014) discuss\nthe prospects of a statistical approach to cp-laws (or a\n\u201csoftness\u201d approach, to use Strevens\u2019s term),\naccording to which cp-laws are statistical claims. (Notice that the\nnormality account presented in section 8 above is but a special case\nof the broader statistical approach to cp-laws).\n\nA third metaphysical trend concerns the metaphysics of dispositions:\nAs we have explained in section 7 above, H\u00fcttemann (2014) and\nPemberton and Cartwright (2014) argue in favor of a dispositionalist\naccount of cp-laws and provide responses to standard objections to the\ndispositionalist view (for instance, to objections voiced by Earman\nand Roberts 1999). \n\n\nDrawing on linguistics and philosophy of language: Several\nrecent approaches to cp-laws explicitly draw on research in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language. Taking into account linguistic\nwork on generics, Nickel (2010, 2014) argues that our understanding of\ncp-law statements is improved if one takes them to be generics and\nuses the formal semantics for generics to shed light on the meaning of\ncp-law statements (for approaches to cp-laws deploying generics, see\nalso Unterhuber and Schurz 2013; Unterhuber 2014; and Claveau und\nGirard 2019). Roberts (2014) makes contact with philosophy of language\nin analyzing cp-laws as vague and indexical statements about\nfrequencies. Ward (2007), Karbasizadeh (2008) and Nickel (2014)\nexplore the link between cp-laws and different accounts of natural\nkind terms. \n\n\nSensitivity to the sciences: Several philosophers have made\nan effort to draw attention to the fact that an adequate discussion of\nlaws has to be sensitive to the differences between distinct\nscientific disciplines. Their motivation is to provide a theory of\nlaws that fits generalizations (and models) in the life sciences, the\nsocial sciences and, more generally, the sciences of complex systems\n(for instance, see Mitchell 1997, 2002a,b; 2008, 2009; Sober 1997;\nSteel 2007; and Reiss 2008). In particular, Mitchell (2000), Strevens\n(2003, 2008), Craver (2007), H\u00fcttemann (2007), Wimsatt (2007),\nTobin (2005), Woodward (2010) and Reutlinger (2011, 2013) distinguish\nvarious dimensions of characterizing how generalizations in these\nscientific disciplines may be non-universal or allow for exceptions.\nThese dimensions include stability, robustness, specificity, and\nhistorical contingency (see Reutlinger and Unterhuber 2014b for an\noverview). In a similar vein, Schurz (2014) introduces a novel\ndistinction between ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Fenton-Glynn (2016) holds that some higher-level\nlaws about the macro-behavior of complex systems (his central example\nis the second law of thermodynamics) are \u201cminutis\nrectis\u201d laws and should be distinguished from cp-laws,\nbecause their non-universal character stems from a probability\ndistribution over initial micro-conditions (see Strevens 2003 for\nfurther examples). Finally, motivated by examples from population\necology, earth science, and statistical mechanics, Strevens (2008) and\nWeisberg (2013) argue for a new interpretation of laws and models\ninvolving idealized assumptions, the minimalist account of\nidealizations. Strevens (2012, 2014) proposes treating cp-laws and\nidealized laws separately. What seems to emerge from this literature\nis that the ceteris paribus character of generalizations is\nmulti-faceted. There is a number of ways in which a generalization can\nbe non-universal: due to idealizations, by expressing statistical\nregularities and probability distributions over initial conditions, by\ndrawing on the notion of normality, by being sensitive to changes in\ninitial and background conditions, and so on (see Reutlinger and\nUnterhuber 2014b for a more detailed analysis). \n\n\nUsing scientific concepts and methods: recent philosophical\nattempts of capturing cp-laws increasingly involve importing key\nconcepts from the sciences and using these concepts for developing a\ngeneral theory of cp-laws. Inspired by classical mechanics, Maudlin\n(2007) and H\u00fcttemann (2014) analyze cp-conditions in terms of\ndefault or inertial behavior. Both authors capture a violation of\ncp-conditions as a deviation from inertial behavior, where deviating\nfrom inertial behavior is itself a process governed by laws of\ndeviation (Maudlin) or laws of interaction and composition\n(H\u00fcttemann). Other philosophers are influenced by the life\nsciences such as Nickel (2014), Pemberton and Cartwright (2014), and\nStrevens (2012, 2014) who rely on the concept of a mechanism in order\nto explicate the content of cp-conditions more generally. Kowalenko\n(2014) argues that cp-laws are best understood by drawing on methods\nfrom statistics, such as multivariate regression analysis (for a\ndiscussion of similar statistical approaches see H\u00fcttemann and\nReutlinger 2013, Reutlinger 2014, Roberts 2014, and Strevens 2014).\nSchurz (2014) uses causal Bayesian networks as a formal framework for\na causal reconstruction of ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Finally, Jhun (2018) argues that focusing on the\nequilibrium methodology used in thermodynamics as well as in economic\nreasoning facilitates a new understanding of the explanatory role of\ncp-laws in terms of efficient performance.  \n\n11. Conclusion\n\nWhere are the debates about cp-laws leading? What are the important\nchallenges to be met in future research? There are at least four main\nareas of productive future research:\n\n The debate on cp-laws since the 1980s has not particularly\nfocused on detailed case studies of laws in different scientific\ndisciplines. But this just seems to be what a satisfying theory of\ncp-laws requires. A possible result of detailed case studies might\nwell be that generalizations reveal quite different features in\ndifferent disciplines. In other words, the explication of cp-laws in,\nfor instance, physics, biology and economics might differ\nsignificantly. If so, this result also raises interesting\nmethodological questions for philosophers of science, such as\n\u201cWhat degree of unification (with respect to laws in different\nscientific disciplines) do we require in order to approve of a theory\nof cp-laws?\u201d. \n What is the connection between cp-laws and theories of (causal)\nexplanation, various theories of causation and mechanisms? When\napplied to the special sciences, many theories of (causal) explanation\n(cf. Woodward 2003, EG1, EG2), causation (cf.\nHausman 1998; Pearl 2000; Hitchcock 2001; Woodward 2003) and\nmechanisms (Machamer, Darden and Craver 2000; Glennan 2002; Craver\n2007) seem to presuppose generalizations. Interestingly, these\ngeneralizations tend to be classified as non-strict. Consequently,\nthese generalizations are in the domain of the debate on cp-laws.\nThese theories of explanation, causation and mechanisms are important\ntest cases for the adequacy of theories of cp-laws. \n What metaphysical claims do the various theories of cp-laws\ncommit us to? Do exclusive cp-laws commit us to assume that the\nfundamental laws of nature are deterministic? Or are they compatible\nwith a probabilistic metaphysics? Furthermore, do cp-laws commit us to\na dispositionalist metaphysics? Or are they compatible with a Humean\nontology? Is structural realism an adequate metaphysics for cp-laws in\ngeneral (see Wright 2017 for discussion) and in particular for the\nlaws of the special sciences? \n What role do cp-laws play in formal philosophy? For example, it\nis important to answer the following questions: How are the logical\nprinciples of non-monotonic reasoning connected to cp-laws? How do\ncp-laws relate to Bayesian probabilities, and to the rules of Bayesian\nupdating of these probabilities? \n\n\nThese areas of research are, of course, not a complete list of future\nresearch topics. Nevertheless, it seems to us that these questions are\ninteresting enough to stimulate productive further research on\nceteris paribus laws.\n12. Suggested Reading\n\nThe critical article by Earman and Roberts (1999) provides an\nexcellent introduction to the contemporary debate, because it\nreconstructs the most important theories of cp-laws and also points\nout the problems of these approaches. The volumes by Earman et\nal. (2002) and Reutlinger and Unterhuber (2014) contain a\nrepresentative collection of contemporary essays on the problem of\ncp-laws.\n\nPersky (1990), Blaug (1996) and Kaufer (1997) are accessible surveys\nof the history of cp-clauses and cp-laws. Notice that these articles\nfocus on economics and the social sciences. For a systematic\ndiscussion of laws in the social sciences, the debate between Kincaid\n(2004) and Roberts (2004) on whether there are laws in the social\nsciences is very instructive.\n\nThe important distinctions between (a) comparative and exclusive and\n(b) indefinite and definite cp-laws are established and argued for in\nSchurz (2002).\n\nThe dilemma of triviality or falsity is discussed in Lange (1993),\nwhich is also a helpful survey of the debate until 1993.\n\nConcerning completer accounts, Fodor (1991), Hausman (1992: chapter 8)\nand Pietroski and Rey (1995) are central papers. These accounts are\ncriticized by Earman and Roberts (1999), Schurz (2001a) and Woodward\n(2002). A more recent defense of completer accounts is Strevens\n(2012).\n\nConcerning stability accounts, Marc Lange develops his version in\nbook-length (see his 2000 and 2009a, although the focus of the latter\nis not on cp-laws). Lange (2002) is a very accessible paper on his\nview of cp-laws. Invariance accounts are best introduced in two joint\npapers by James Woodward and Christopher Hitchcock (see their EG1, EG2) and in Woodward\u2019s book Making Things Happen (2003:\nchapter 6). Hall (2007) provides an insightful discussion of Woodward\n& Hitchcock\u2019s invariance account. \n\nFor dispositionalist approaches to cp-laws, Cartwright (1989) is a\nmodern classic (cf. her recent 2002, and Elgin and Sober 2002 for a\ncritique). Smith (2002), Mumford (2004), Bird (2005, 2007) and\nH\u00fcttemann (2007, 2014) develop different more recent\ndispositional accounts of cp-laws.\n\nConcerning normality approaches, Schurz (2001b, 2002) argues for a\nnormic laws approach. Spohn (2002) and Spohn (2012, chapter 13) are\ngood introductions to the normal conditions approach. See also Glymour\n(2002) for a formal approach to cp-laws.\n\nHumean better best system accounts of cp-laws are presented in Cohen\nand Callender (2009, 2010), Schrenk (2007a, 2014), and Unterhuber\n(2014). Wheeler (2018: chapter 3.2) gives an accessible brief\nexposition of various versions; and Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and\nReutlinger (2014) provide a critical discussion. \n\nThere are also various approaches in the current debate that cannot\neasily be classified: Mitchell (1997, 2002a, b; 2008, 2009), Sober\n1997, Steel (2007, chapter 6) and Reiss (2008) attempt to explicate a\ntheory of laws that fits scientific practice in biology, the social\nsciences and generalization describing complex systems. Further,\nMitchell (2000), Craver (2007), Tobin (2005) and Reutlinger (2011)\ndistinguish various dimensions of the non-universality of (cp-)laws in\norder to argue for an explication of laws in the special sciences.\nKarbasizadeh (2008) links the debates on cp-laws and natural kinds.\nLadyman and Ross (2007, chapters 4 and 5), Kincaid (2008), Ross\n(2008), and Ladyman (2008) argue for ontic structural realism as a\nmetaphysics of generalizations in the social sciences (and for the\nspecial sciences in general). Finally, Maudlin (2007, chapter 5)\nadvocates an explication of laws in the special sciences that is based\non the notion of quasi-Newtonian laws.",
