    "main_text": "Inexactness, ceteris paribus clauses, tendencies, \u201cunrealistic assumptions\u201d and models || Friedman and the defense of \u201cunrealistic assumptions\u201d\n3.2 Friedman and the defense of \u201cunrealistic assumptions\u201d\n\nAlthough some contemporary philosophers have argued that Mill\u2019s\nmethod a priori is largely defensible (Bhaskar 1975,\nCartwright 1989, and Hausman 1992), by the middle of the Twentieth\nCentury Mill\u2019s views appeared to many economists out of step\nwith their understanding of contemporary philosophy of science.\nWithout studying Mill\u2019s text carefully, it was easy for\neconomists to misunderstand his terminology and to regard his method\na priori as opposed to empiricism. Others took seriously\nMill\u2019s view that the basic principles of economics should be\nempirically established and found evidence to cast doubt on some of\nthe basic principles, particularly the view that firms attempt to\nmaximize profits (Hall and Hitch 1938, Lester 1946, 1947).\nMethodologists who were well-informed about contemporary developments\nin philosophy of science, such as Terence Hutchison (1938), denounced\n\u201cpure theory\u201d in economics as unscientific.\n\nPhilosophically reflective economists proposed several ways to replace\nthe old-fashioned Millian view with a more up-to-date methodology that\nwould continue to justify much of current practice (see particularly\nMachlup 1955, 1960 and Koopmans 1957). By far the most influential of\nthese efforts was Milton Friedman\u2019s 1953 essay, \u201cThe\nMethodology of Positive Economics.\u201d This essay has had an\nenormous influence, far more than any other work on methodology.\n\nFriedman begins his essay by distinguishing in a conventional way\nbetween positive and normative economics and conjecturing that policy\ndisputes are typically really disputes about the consequences of\nalternatives and can thus be resolved by progress in positive\neconomics. Turning to positive economics, Friedman asserts (without\nargument) that correct prediction concerning phenomena not yet\nobserved is the ultimate goal of all positive sciences. He\nholds a practical view of science and finds the value of science in\npredictions that will guide policy.\n\nSince it is difficult and often impossible to carry out experiments\nand since the uncontrolled phenomena economists observe are difficult\nto interpret (owing to the same causal complexity that bothered Mill),\nit is hard to judge whether a particular theory is a good basis for\npredictions or not. Tendencies are not universal laws. A claim such as\n\u201cfirms attempt to maximize profits\u201d will be\n\u201cunrealistic\u201d in the sense that it is not a true universal\ngeneralization. Although not in these terms, Friedman objects to\ncriticisms of tendencies that in effect complain that they are merely\ntendencies, rather than universal laws. If his criticism stopped\nthere, it would be sensible, although it would avoid the problems of\nunderstanding and appraising claims about tendencies.\n\nBut Friedman draws a much more radical conclusion. In his terminology,\nthe mistake economists make who criticize claims such as \u201cfirms\nattempt to maximize profits\u201d lies in the attempt to test\ntheories by the \u201crealism\u201d of their\n\u201cassumptions\u201d rather than by the accuracy of their\npredictions. He maintains that the realism of a theory\u2019s\nassumptions is irrelevant to its predictive value. It does not matter\nwhether the assumption that firms maximize profits is realistic.\nTheories should be appraised exclusively in terms of the accuracy of\ntheir predictions. What matters is exclusively whether the theory of\nthe firm makes correct and significant predictions.\n\nAs critics have pointed out (and almost all commentators have been\ncritical), Friedman refers to several different things as\n\u201cassumptions\u201d of a theory and means several different\nthings by speaking of assumptions as \u201cunrealistic\u201d\n(Brunner 1969). Since Friedman aims his criticism to those who\ninvestigate empirically whether firms in fact attempt to maximize\nprofits, he must take \u201cassumptions\u201d to include central\neconomic generalizations, such as \u201cFirms attempt to maximize\nprofits,\u201d and by \u201cunrealistic,\u201d he must mean, among\nother things, \u201cfalse.\u201d In arguing that it is a mistake to\nappraise theories in terms of the realism of assumptions, Friedman is\narguing at least that it is a mistake to appraise theories by\ninvestigating whether their central generalizations are true or\nfalse.\n\nIt would seem that this interpretation would render Friedman\u2019s\nviews inconsistent, because in testing whether firms attempt to\nmaximize profits, one is checking whether predictions of theory\nconcerning the behavior of firms are true or false. An\n\u201cassumption\u201d such as \u201cfirms maximize profits\u201d\nis itself a prediction. But there is a further wrinkle. Friedman is\nnot concerned with every prediction of economic theories. In\nFriedman\u2019s view, \u201ctheory is to be judged by its predictive\npower exclusively for the class of phenomena which it is intended\nto explain\u201d (1953, p. 8 [italics added]). Economists are\ninterested in only some of the implications of economic theories.\nOther predictions, such as those concerning the results of surveys of\nmanagers, are irrelevant to policy. What matters is whether economic\ntheories are successful at predicting the phenomena that economists\nare interested in. In other words, Friedman believes that economic\ntheories should be appraised in terms of their predictions concerning\nprices and quantities exchanged on markets. In his view, what matters\nis \u201cnarrow predictive success\u201d (Hausman 2008a), not\noverall predictive adequacy.\n\nSo Friedman permits economists to ignore the disquieting findings of\nsurveys, or the fact that people do not always prefer larger bundles\nof commodities to smaller bundles of commodities. Nor do economists\nneed to be concerned about whether there is a tendency to prefer more\ncommodities to fewer. They need not be troubled that some of their\nmodels suppose extravagantly that all agents know the prices of all\npresent and future commodities in all markets. All that matters is\nwhether the predictions concerning market phenomena turn out to be\ncorrect. And since anomalous market outcomes could be due to any\nnumber of uncontrolled causal factors, while experiments are difficult\nto carry out, it turns out that economists need not worry about ever\nencountering evidence that would strongly disconfirm fundamental\ntheory. Detailed models may be confirmed or disconfirmed, but\nfundamental theory is safe. In this way one can understand how\nFriedman\u2019s methodology, which appears to justify the eclectic\nand pragmatic view that economists should use any model that appears\nto \u201cwork\u201d regardless of how absurd or unreasonable its\nassumptions might appear, has been deployed in service of a rigid\ntheoretical orthodoxy. For other discussions of Friedman\u2019s\nessay, see Bear and Orr 1969, Boland 1979, Hammond 1992, Hirsch and de\nMarchi 1990, M\u00e4ki 1990a, Melitz 1963, Rotwein 1959, and Samuelson\n1963.\n\nOver the last two decades there has been a surge of experimentation in\neconomics, and Friedman\u2019s methodological views probably do not\ncommand the same near unanimity that they used to. But they are still\nenormously influential, and they still serve as a way of avoiding\nawkward questions concerning simplifications, idealizations, and\nabstraction in economics rather than responding to them.\n",
