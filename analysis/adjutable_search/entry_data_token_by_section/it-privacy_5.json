    "main_text": "The impact of information technology on privacy || Developments in information technology\n2.1 Developments in information technology\n\n\u201cInformation technology\u201d refers to automated systems for\nstoring, processing, and distributing information. Typically, this\ninvolves the use of computers and communication networks. The amount\nof information that can be stored or processed in an information\nsystem depends on the technology used. The capacity of the technology\nhas increased rapidly over the past decades, in accordance with\nMoore\u2019s law. This holds for storage capacity, processing capacity, and\ncommunication bandwidth. We are now capable of storing and processing\ndata on the exabyte level. For illustration, to store 100 exabytes of\ndata on 720 MB CD-ROM discs would require a stack of them that would\nalmost reach the moon.\n\nThese developments have fundamentally changed our practices of\ninformation provisioning. The rapid changes have increased the need\nfor careful consideration of the desirability of effects. Some even\nspeak of a digital revolution as a technological leap similar to the\nindustrial revolution, or a digital revolution as a revolution in\nunderstanding human nature and the world, similar to the revolutions\nof Copernicus, Darwin and Freud (Floridi 2008). In both the technical\nand the epistemic sense, emphasis has been put on connectivity and\ninteraction. Physical space has become less important, information is\nubiquitous, and social relations have adapted as well.\n\nAs we have described privacy in terms of moral reasons for imposing\nconstraints on access to and/or use of personal information, the\nincreased connectivity imposed by information technology poses many\nquestions. In a descriptive sense, access has increased, which, in a\nnormative sense, requires consideration of the desirability of this\ndevelopment, and evaluation of the potential for regulation by\ntechnology (Lessig 1999), institutions, and/or law.\n\nAs connectivity increases access to information, it also increases the\npossibility for agents to act based on the new sources of\ninformation. When these sources contain personal information, risks of\nharm, inequality, discrimination, and loss of autonomy easily emerge.\nFor example, your enemies may have less difficulty finding out where\nyou are, users may be tempted to give up privacy for perceived\nbenefits in online environments, and employers may use online\ninformation to avoid hiring certain groups of people. Furthermore,\nsystems rather than users may decide which information is displayed,\nthus confronting users only with news that matches their profiles.\n\nAlthough the technology operates on a device level, information\ntechnology consists of a complex system of socio-technical practices,\nand its context of use forms the basis for discussing its role in\nchanging possibilities for accessing information, and thereby\nimpacting privacy. We will discuss some specific developments and\ntheir impact in the following sections.\n",
