    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Self-determination theories\n4. Future Directions\n\nThe recent surge of interest in territorial justice and territorial\nrights may be attributed to the fact that it has become clear that the\ndifferent elements of the bundle of territorial rights are connected\nto a wide range of increasingly important and pressing debates, such\nas resource justice, migration and secession. Some of the most\ninteresting work on migration justice takes into account the issue of\nrights over territory (Ochoa Espejo 2016; Song 2018). The interest in\nresource justice may be connected to the obvious fact that there are\nmany different claims for common pool resources and some of these are\nbeing increasingly degraded. This makes more pressing the question of\nwho has entitlement to control resources and what are the terms under\nwhich individuals or groups should interact with such places\n(Armstrong 2017; Nine 2014, 2019; Banai 2016). Armstrong (2017, 2018),\nhas focused on resource justice and on the special case of the oceans\nwhich is a particularly significant common pool resource. Some of this\ninterest is connected to technological innovations which make possible\nharvesting resources in the seabed, or potentially in space. \n\nAnother area of recent interest has been the implications of occupancy\nrights, which are discussed in self-determination theories, and has\nrecently been deployed in relation to indigenous land rights (Colburn\n2019), gentrification (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018), wrongful\nexpulsion from land (Moore 2013), and people who inhabit islands which\nare doomed to sink with the effect of climate change (Blomfield 2019;\nKolers 2012a; Nine 2019). If these theorists are correct to theorize a\nmoral relationship between people and place, then, the loss suffered\nby people who are displaced by climate change cannot be redressed\nfully simply by allowing them to migrate to another place: they have\nlost their home and community, and the place that they are attached\nto. \n\nThere is also a burgeoning literature on territorial rights that\nquestion the fixity of current theories, and give greater attention to\nthe overlapping and fluid nature of human\u2019s relations to the\nnatural world and its implications for governance, resources, and\ndiverse claims (see Mancilla forthcoming; Nine forthcoming). This is\nanother instance of the way in which focus on territory and\nterritorial justice has implications for a wide set of literatures in\nquite different areas, and potentially gives rise to a host of related\narguments on diverse topics.\n",
