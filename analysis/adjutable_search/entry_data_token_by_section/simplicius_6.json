    "main_text": "The Harmony of Plato and Aristotle and Christian Threads\n7. Simplicius\u2019 Legacy\n\nIn the Middle Ages and after, Simplicius was read by a wide range of\nauthors, but to date no systematic study of his legacy has been\npublished. This final section presents only a limited selection of\nevidence for his legacy. In the Latin West, the Dominican friar\nWilliam of Moerbeke (1215\u20131286) translated some of\nSimplicius\u2019 commentaries into Latin. This made them accessible\nto readers such as Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, and\nmany others. Moerbeke finished translating the Commentary on the\nCategories in 1266 (Chase 2008: 12\u201317 and 20\u201324). He\nalso translated a small part of the Commentary on the De\nCaelo, the so-called fragmentum Toletanum, followed by a\nfull translation of the commentary in 1271 (see Bossier 1987). In\naddition, there is a partial translation by Robert Grosseteste that is\nolder then the one by Moerbeke, but it is difficult to determine who\nactually made use of it.\n\nRegarding Moerbeke\u2019s influence on Thomas, the latter seems to\nhave followed Simplicius in the way he conceives the history of\nphilosophy and, more specifically, the relation between Plato and\nAristotle (see Hankey 2002):\n\n\nThe diversity of these two positions stems from this, that some, in\norder to seek the truth about the nature of things, have proceeded\nfrom intelligible reasons, and this was the particular characteristic\nof the Platonists. Some, however, have proceeded from sensible things,\nand this was the particular characteristic of the philosophy of\nAristotle, as Simplicius says in his commentary Upon the\nCategories. (Thomas Aquinas, De Spiritualibus creaturis\n3.40.275\u2013282, as quoted in Hankey 2002: n. 46)\n\n\nMoreover, Thomas must have considered Simplicius a rich source of\ninformation about ancient philosophers and their doctrines and\nespecially about the Peripatetic tradition. Bossier (1987) and others\nhave suggested that Thomas might have used material from the\npreviously mentioned fragmentum Toletanum in his\nCommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (XII 8, on\nconcentric spheres and their different movers). There is no evidence\nof an early Latin translation of the other commentaries, with the\npossible exception of a small part of the Commentary on the\nPhysics, which also goes back to Robert Grosseteste (Mansion\n1956: 94).\n\nThe Arabic tradition is another important source of information about\nSimplicius (for a concise summary, see Goulet & Coda 2016:\n384\u2013394; see also Vallat 2014a and 2014b and G\u00e4tje 1982).\nAs in the Latin tradition, the Commentaries on the\nCategories and the De anima seem to have primarily\nbeen read by scholars (in both Arabic and Syriac). However, there also\nappears to be some evidence for a lost Commentary on the First\nBook of Euclid (Goulet & Coda 2016: 390\u2013394; I. Hadot\n2014, 39\u201353; R. Rashed 2005). Before Simplicius, Proclus had\nalready commented on Euclid. Proclus\u2019 commentary still exists,\nand so there is a question regarding Simplicius\u2019 motivation for\nwriting a second commentary, and it may be that Simplicius\u2019\ncommentary was simply an augmented and revised version of\nProclus\u2019 commentary. Philosophers in the Arabic tradition, like\nthose in the Latin tradition, also used Simplicius to defend the\nharmony of Plato and Aristotle.\n\nThe Byzantine tradition is primarily relevant for the textual\ntransmission of Simplicius\u2019 works. From the little that is\nknown, Byzantine scholars seem to have had a special interest in the\nCommentary on the Physics. One of the most important\nmanuscripts conserving this commentary (Mosquensis Muz. 3649), not\nused by Hermann Diels in his CAG edition, was copied by the Byzantine\nprincess Theodora Palaiologina Rhaulaina (ca. 1240\u20131300; see\nHarlfinger 1987). Simplicius\u2019 Commentary on the Physics\nwas used by Michael Psellus, Nicophorus Blemmydes (in his\nIsagogical Epitome; Golitsis 2007), Georgios Pachymeres (in\nhis own Commentary on the Physics, traditionally attributed\nto Psellus; Golitsis 2008b), Georgios Gemistius-Plethon, Georgios\nScholarius, and Theodorus of Gaza. Since there was a lively debate\namong Byzantine philosophers on the relation between Plato and\nAristotle, it is very likely that Simplicius had an impact in this\nrespect.\n\nInterest in the Commentary on the De anima can also be traced\nin the Renaissance, for instance, the attention paid to\n(Pseudo-?)Simplicius\u2019 reading of De anima III 5 as\nregarding the human intellect only, and also his explanation of the\nkey notion of entelecheia and his relation to Averroes\u2019\npsychology (Nardi 1951; Salatowsky 2006; Blackwell 2011). Moreover,\nRenaissance philosophers, like scholars in Byzantium and the Latin\nWest, thought much about the relation between Plato and Aristotle,\nwith some sharing Simplicius\u2019 preference for harmony or\nconcordism and others opposing it. Thus, for example, Thomas\nAquinas\u2019 view on the harmony of Plato and Aristotle was partly\ninspired by passages from Simplicius (in William of Moerbeke\u2019s\nLatin translation). Other than in the Middle Ages, we also find a\ngrowing interest in his Commentary on Epictetus\u2019\nHandbook from the fifteenth century onwards, especially among\nHumanists (P. Hadot 1987). Last, but not least, in his Lectures on\nthe History of Philosophy, G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831) calls\nSimplicius \u201cthe most learned and acute of the Greek commentators\non Aristotle\u201d (\u201cder gelehrteste und scharfsinnigste\nder griechischen Kommentatoren des Aristoteles\u201d) and\nasserts that \u201cwe owe him much\u201d (\u201cwir verdanken\nihm Verdienstliches\u201d).\n\nAlthough much more could be said here about Simplicius\u2019 legacy,\nsuffice it to say the following. As mentioned in the introduction, his\nCommentary on the Physics was the basis for Diels\u2019\nfundamental studies on the Greek doxographers (Doxographi\ngraeci) and the fragments of the Presocratic philosophers\n(Fragmente der Vorsokratiker). The reconstruction of the\nPeripatetic tradition also depends to a large extent on Simplicius\n(Falcon 2017 and Baltussen 2016). This is especially obvious in \nthe work of Alexander of Aphrodisias, where substantial parts of lost\ncommentaries can be retrieved from Simplicius\u2019 works (M. Rashed\n2011), but also in the case of less well-known figures such as Boethos\nof Sidon (Chiaradonna & Rashed forthcoming). Compared to Hermann\nDiels and others, we now have a much better grasp of how Simplicius\nhandled his sources and how he portrayed the historical development of\nGreek philosophy up to his time. Several recent studies have also\nprovided a clearer profile of Simplicius\u2019 own philosophical\nagenda. Nevertheless, considerable parts of his commentaries are still\nrelatively unexplored, and it now seems to be a good time for\ncontemporary scholars to rediscover the Neoplatonist as an inspiring\nlate-ancient colleague in the joint venture of coming to terms with\nAristotle.\n",
