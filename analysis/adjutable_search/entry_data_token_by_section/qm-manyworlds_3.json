Correspondence Between the Formalism and Our Experience\n\nWe should not expect to have a detailed and complete explanation of\nour experience in terms of the wave function of \\(10^{33}\\) particles\nthat we and our immediate environment are made of. We just have to be\nable to draw a basic picture which is free of paradoxes. There are\nmany attempts to provide an explanation of what we see based on the\nMWI or its variants in Lockwood 1989, Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990,\nAlbert 1992, Saunders 1993, Penrose 1994, Chalmers 1996, Deutsch 1996,\nJoos et al. 2003, Schlosshauer 2007, Wallace 2012, Cunningham\n2014, Vaidman 2016a, Zurek 2018, Vaidman 2019, and Tappenden 2019a. A\nsketch of the connection between the wave function of the Universe and\nour experience follows.\n",
