    "main_text": "\n\nAnton Marty (October 18, 1847\u2013October 1, 1914) was a philosopher\nof language, psychologist, and ontologist. He was born in Schwyz,\nSwitzerland in a very large family and baptized as a Catholic with the\nfull name of \u2018Martin Anton Maurus Marty\u2019. His oldest\nbrother went into the priesthood and became a missionary to the Sioux\nin North America. Though Marty himself was ordained, he left the\npriesthood shortly after Brentano had done so (in 1873, a few years\nafter the declaration of papal infallibility) and pursued an academic\ncareer instead. He died in Prague, at that time a city that belonged\nwithin the Austro-Hungarian Empire and where he had been professor at\nthe German-speaking division of the Ferdinand Charles University for\nmost of his academic career.\n\nMarty\u2019s philosophical work is distinct especially as an\napplication of Brentano\u2019s descriptive psychology to the study of\nlanguage in opposition to many of the prominent currents in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language during his time. These were in\nmany cases much more historical rather than psychological in\ncharacter, but also often based on psychological theories wherein\nintentionality was not fully or hardly at all thematized as it was in\nBrentanian psychology. Marty\u2019s philosophy of language is\naccordingly outstanding as a reflection on linguistic phenomena as\nessentially intentional.\n",
