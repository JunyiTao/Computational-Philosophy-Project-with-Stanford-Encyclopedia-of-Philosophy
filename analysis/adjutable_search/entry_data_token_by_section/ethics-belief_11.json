Clifford's Principle itself is articulated as a synchronic\nnorm, but in the later portions of the \u201cEthics of Belief,\u201d\nhe is more concerned to articulate diachronic principles regarding\nevidence-collection and evidence-assessment. It is from these portions\nof his discussion that we get \u201cClifford's Other\nPrinciple.\u201d\n\nMany early ethicists of belief modeled their accounts on deontological\nethical theories that tend to formulate principles synchronically.\nRecently, however, virtue epistemologists have emphasized what they\ntake to be the diachronic character of our fundamental doxastic\nobligations, and suggest that synchronic principles requiring\nsufficient evidence for a belief at a time are plausibly viewed as\nunderwritten by more fundamental diachronic principles enjoining the\ncultivation of virtuous intellectual character (Zagzebski 1996,\nRoberts and Wood 2007, Sosa 2007, Audi 2008b).\n",
