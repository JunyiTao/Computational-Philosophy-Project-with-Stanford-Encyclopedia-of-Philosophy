    "main_text": "Biography || Biographical Introduction\n1.1 Biographical Introduction\n\nHabermas was born in June 1929 and brought up in provincial\nNorth-Rhine Westphalia, to conservative, educated middle-class\nparents, who had been neither critical nor strongly supportive of the\nNazi regime. In 1944 he was called up to man the defences on the\nwestern front. A little over a year later he was shaken to his core by\nwhat he learnt of the Nazi atrocities from the Nuremberg Trials, and\nnews coverage of the Holocaust. Thus, although still in his teens, he\nexperienced 1945 as a turning point that would shape his political and\ncultural outlook. As he put it frankly in an interview in 1979:\n\n\nI am myself a product of \u201creeducation\u201d \u2026 By this I\nmean that \u2026 we learnt that the bourgeois constitutional state\nin its French, or American, or English form is an historical\nachievement. (1992a: interview 3, 79)\n\n\nTwo moments exemplify Habermas\u2019s complex position in-between the\ngenerations of 1945 and 1968. In 1953, when Habermas was a student at\nG\u00f6ttingen University, he published a critical essay in the\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung concerning Heidegger\u2019s\nremark about \u201cthe inner truth and greatness of the Nazi\nmovement\u201d that Heidegger had written in his lectures on\nmetaphysics in 1935, and then failed to retract or alter in 1953 when\nrepublishing those lectures. (1971c [1977]) In 1968, at the height of\nthe student protests in Germany, Habermas, who had been critical of\nthe policing that had resulted in the killing of Benno Ohnesorg at a\nstudent demonstration the year before, directly criticized the\nstudents for acting out revolutionary fantasies, and for provoking the\nauthorities into violence. He used the phrase \u201cleft-wing\nfascism\u201d, a term he later admitted was too harsh\n(M\u00fcller-Doohm 2016: 141). Instead, he urged them to put the\nlatitude granted to them by liberal democratic institutions to work in\nthe service of a \u201cradical reformism\u201d (Specter 2010:\n111\u2013115).\n\nHabermas studied German philosophy and literature at Bonn, and wrote\nhis doctoral dissertation on \u201cThe Absolute and History: the\nAmbivalence of Schelling\u2019s Thought\u201d. He came to Frankfurt\nin 1956, where he was Theodor Adorno\u2019s Assistent at the\nInstitute for Social Research for three years. In 1959 he left for\nMarburg, having effectively been shouldered out by Max Horkheimer, who\nconsidered him a dangerous Marxist, and who tried to have him\ndismissed (M\u00fcller-Doohm 2016: 84\u201386; Habermas 1992a:\ninterview 8, 218). In Marburg, he wrote his habilitation dissertation,\nThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, under\nWolfgang Abendroth, one of the few Marxist academic philosophers in\nthe post-war Federal Republic. Habermas, though often deemed a member\nof the Frankfurt School, was, in reality, at the institute for a very\nbrief period. Whilst there, he recalls, \u201cCritical Theory, at\nFrankfurt School\u2014there was no such thing \u2026 no coherent\ndoctrine\u201d (Habermas 1992a: interview 4, 98). So it is misleading\nto say that he was or became a \u201cmember\u201d of the Frankfurt\nSchool. In truth, he arrived there as an outsider, and while there,\nbriefly, ploughed his own furrow.\n\nHabermas returned to Frankfurt, after a short period at the University\nof Heidelberg, where he succeeded Horkheimer, with whom he soon\nreconciled, as Professor of Philosophy and Sociology. He declined to\nbecome director of the institute. In Frankfurt, Habermas spent the\nlatter half of the 1960s teaching in febrile and tumultuous political\ncircumstances not conducive to research. In 1971 he became director of\nthe Max Planck Institute for the Study of Living Conditions in the\nScientific and Technical World in Starnberg, Bavaria, where he\nconducted the research which led to his magnum opus, the two-volume\nTheory of Communicative Action. The year his magnum opus was\npublished, 1981, Habermas resigned from the Max Planck Institute under\nunhappy circumstances, and again returned to Frankfurt. There he would\nremain, but for various visiting professorships in the US, until his\nretirement in 1994. Landmark publications during these years include\nmany essays on moral philosophy, and Between Facts and Norms\nin 1992, Habermas\u2019s major work in political and legal\nphilosophy. Throughout his life Habermas has enthusiastically played\nthe role of the public intellectual, taking part in disputes about\npositivism in the social sciences, the historical uniqueness of the\nHolocaust, German reunification, genetic engineering, and secularism\nand religion. He is the recipient of numerous honorary doctorates and\nprizes, including the Adorno Prize of the city of Frankfurt and the\nKyoto Prize of the Inamori Foundation (M\u00fcller-Doohm 2016:\n340).\n",
