    "main_text": "Human Evolution and the Descent of Man || The Genesis of Darwin\u2019s Descent\n4.1 The Genesis of Darwin\u2019s Descent\n\nDarwin had retained his own conclusions on human evolution quietly in\nthe background while the defense of his general theory was conducted\nby advocates as diverse as Thomas Henry Huxley (1825\u201395) in\nEngland, Asa Gray (1810\u201388) in the United States, and Ernst\nHaeckel (1834\u20131919) in Germany. Darwin\u2019s own position on\nthe \u201chuman question\u201d remained unclear, and his rhetorical\nsituating of the Origin within a tradition of divine creation\nby secondary law, captured in the frontispiece quotations from William\nWhewell and Francis Bacon, retained in all editions, in some degree\nallowed many before 1871 to see Darwin as more open to religious views\nthan those of some of his popularizers.\n\nIt was in February of 1867 that Darwin decided to remove material from\nhis massive manuscript of the Variation of Plants and Animals\nUnder Domestication and create a \u201cvery small volume,\n\u2018an essay on the origin of mankind\u2019\u201d (Darwin to\nHooker, 8 February 1867 and CD to Turner, 11 February 1867, Burkhardt\net al. 2006 15: 74, 80). At this time he also sent to several\ncorrespondents a questionnaire asking for information on human\nemotional expression. This expanded into a major enterprise in which\nhe became deeply engaged with the issue of the implications of his\ntheory for ethics, writing to Asa Gray that \u201cthe difficulties of\nthe Moral sense has [sic] caused me much labor\u201d (CD to Gray, 15 March\n1870, Burkhardt et al. 2010 18: 68). This was expanded into a two volume\nwork by the time it was sent to the printer in June of 1870. By this\ndate he had also pulled out a separate section from the\nVariation manuscript that was to become the Expression of\nthe Emotions in Man and the Animals,published in 1872.\n4.2. Reception of the Descent\n\nThe dual publication of the Descent of Man, and Selection in\nRelation to Sex (1871) and the Expression of the\nEmotions (1872) created a watershed in the public reception of\nDarwin\u2019s views (Radick 2013). Although Darwin had first worked\nout many of his views on human evolution in the early \u201cM\u201d\nand \u201cN\u201d Notebooks of 1838\u201340, public knowledge of\nDarwin\u2019s own conclusions on human evolution rested on the one\nvague sentence on the issue in the Origin itself. The\nDescent, however, made public his more radical conclusions,\nand seemed to many of his readers, even those previously sympathetic\nto the Origin, to throw Darwin\u2019s weight behind\nmaterialist and anti-religious forces spearheaded by such individuals\nas German physiologist Friederich Ludwig B\u00fcchner\n(1824\u20131899), Dutch physiologist Jacob Moleschott\n(1822\u201393), English socialist and Darwin popularizer Edward\nAveling (1849\u201398), and German zoologist Ernst Haeckel. Although\nthe question of human evolution had already been dealt with in part by\nThomas Huxley in the Man\u2019s Place in Nature of 1863, by\nCharles Lyell in the same year in his Geological Evidences of the\nAntiquity of Man, by Alfred Russel Wallace in articles in 1864\nand 1870 (Wallace 1864, 1870 and online), and by Haeckel in\nhis Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte of 1868, these\nauthors had either not dealt with the full range of questions\npresented by the inclusion of human beings in the evolutionary process\n(Huxley), or they had emphasized the moral and mental discontinuity\nbetween humans and animals (Lyell, Wallace). Only Haeckel had drawn\nout a more general reductive conception of humanity from evolutionary\ntheory and he had not ventured into the specific issues of ethics,\nsocial organization, the origins of human races, and the relation of\nhuman mental properties to those of animals, all of which are dealt\nwith in the Descent. Darwin\u2019s two-volume treatise\npresented, as one commentator has put it, \u201ca closer resemblance\nto Darwin\u2019s early naturalistic vision than anything else he ever\npublished\u201d (Durant 1985: 294).\n\nDarwin\u2019s extension of his theory to a range of questions\ntraditionally discussed within philosophy, theology, and social and\npolitical theory, hardened the opposition of many religiously-based\ncommunities to evolutionary theory, although here again, distinctions\nmust be made between different communities (Elleg\u00e5rd 1958: chp.\n14). Such opposition was not simply based upon the denial of the\nliteral scriptural account of the origins of humankind, an issue that\nplayed out differently within the main religious communions (Haught\n2013; Finnegan 2013; Swetlitz 2013; Artigas, Glick, & Martinez\n2006; Moore 1979). The more fundamental opposition was due to the\ndenial of distinctions, other than those of degree, between\nfundamental human properties and those of animals. Furthermore, the\napparent denial of some kind of divine guidance in the processes\nbehind human evolution and the non-teleological character of\nDarwin\u2019s final formulations of the natural selection theory in\nthe fifth and sixth editions of the Origin, hardened this\nopposition. His adoption from Herbert Spencer of designator\n\u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d as a synonym for \u201cnatural\nselection\u201d in the fifth edition added to this growing\nopposition. As a consequence, the favorable readings that many\ninfluential religious thinkers\u2014John Henry Newman\n(1801\u20131890) is a good example\u2014had given to the original\nOrigin, disappeared. The rhetoric of the Descent,\nwith its conclusion that \u201cman is descended from a hairy\nquadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears\u201d (1871: vol.\n2: 389), presented to the public a different Darwin than many had\nassociated with the author of the Journal of Researches and\nthe early editions of the Origin.\n\nMost striking in comparing the Origin to the Descent\nwas the strong emphasis on the workings of the secondary process of\nsexual selection in the animal kingdom (E. Richards 2017;\nR.A. Richards 2013). Sexual selection\u2014the selection of females\nby males or vice versa for breeding purposes\u2014had given a general\nstatement of this principle in chapter four of the Origin,\nbut this played a minor role in the original argument, and its\nimportance was denied by contemporaries like A. R. Wallace. Darwin now\ndeveloped this secondary form of selection in extensive detail as a\nfactor in evolution that could even work against ordinary natural\nselection. Sexual selection could now be marshaled to explain both\nsexual dimorphism and also those character and properties of\norganisms\u2014elaborate feeding organs, bright colors on fish and\nbirds, and seemingly maladaptive structures such as the great horn on\nthe Rhinoceros beetle\u2014, that might appear to be anomalous\noutcomes of ordinary natural selection working to the optimal survival\nof organisms in nature. In a dramatic extension of this principle to\nhuman beings, the combination of natural and sexual selection is used\nto explain the origins of the human beings from simian ancestors. It\nalso explains the sexual dimorphism displayed by human beings, and is\nthe main factor accounting for the origin of human races.\n4.3 The Ethical Theory of the Descent of Man\n\nThe many dimensions of \u201csocial\u201d Darwinism that were\naffected by the Descent demand separate articles, as does the\nseparate impact of the Expression of the Emotions, a treatise\nthat in many respects is different in tone and content from the\nDescent. It is also the case that many of the social\nimplications of evolutionary theory were due more to the influence of\nHerbert Spencer than to Darwin\u2019s own writings, and for this\nreason what has been termed \u201csocial Darwinism\u201d may have\ndeveloped independently of Darwin (Bowler 2013b). In this closing\nsubsection the author will focus exclusively on one important aspect\nof this broader social impact of the Descent, the Darwinian\ntreatment of ethics. This will be examined within its specific\nVictorian context, rather than in light of more recent discussions of\naltruism within contemporary sociobiology that may owe some filiation\nwith these Darwinian discussion (see entries on\n morality and evolutionary biology\n and\n biological altruism).\n\nAs can be seen from the letter to Asa Gray of March 1870 (Burkhardt et\nal. 2010 18: 68) , Darwin was\nparticularly exercised by the issue of ethics in preparing the\nDescent. His published treatment focused the long chapter\nthree of the Descent on the issue of the \u201cmoral\nsense\u201d. In approaching ethics \u201cexclusively from the side\nof natural history\u201d (Descent 1871: vol 1: 71), he\noffered some innovations that do not easily map on to standard ethical\npositions formulated around the familiar categories of Utilitarianism\nand the Kantian heritage of Deontology. The closest connections might\nbe drawn with certain aspects of contemporary virtue ethics and some\naspects of Natural Law theory, although there are many specific\ndifferences that prevent assimilation to these traditions as well\n(Sloan 1999). His closest historical affinities are with the Scottish\nmoral sense tradition of Adam Smith, David Hume, and particularly as\nthis was developed in the writings of Darwin\u2019s distant relative,\nSir James Macintosh (1765\u20131832) (R.J. Richards\n1987, 1999, 2003,\n.\n\nTraditional moral sense theory linked ethical behavior to an innate\nproperty or instinct that was considered universal in human beings,\neven though it required education and cultivation to reach its highest\nexpression (see\n moral sentimentalism\n in this encyclopedia). This inherent property, or \u201cmoral\nsense\u201d, presumably explained such phenomena as ethical\nconscience, and it also accounted for altruistic actions that could\nnot be reduced to a hedonic seeking of pleasure and avoiding pain. It\nalso did not involve the rational calculation of advantage by the\nindividual prior to action.\n\nDarwin\u2019s reinterpretation of the moral sense tradition within\nhis evolutionary framework, however, implied important\ntransformations. The moral sense, for Darwin, was derived by\nbiological descent from animal instinct, and particularly from the\nsocial instincts developed by natural selection. From this\nperspective, Darwin could then argue for a genuine\n\u201chomology\u201d of ethical foundations holding between humans\nand animals, with the precursors of human ethical behavior found in\nthe behavior of other animals, particularly those with social\norganization. Natural and sexual selection then shaped these ethical\ninstincts in ways that favored group survival rather than immediate\nindividual benefit (Descent 1871: vol. 1: 98). Human ethical\nbehavior is therefore grounded in a natural property, and ethical\naction can occur without moral calculus or rational deliberation.\nBecause he considered ethical action to be grounded on a biologically\ninnate property, Darwin criticized John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nUtilitarian theory because it relied on acquired habits rather than\nsomething present in humans from the beginning (1871: vol. 1: 71n5).\nThe innate moral sense is his explanation for self-sacrifice and other\naltruistic acts that cannot be attributed to individual self-survival\n(1871: vol. 1: 86). Humans can be \n\n\nimpelled by the same instinctive motive, which made the heroic little\nAmerican monkey\u2026attack the great and dreaded baboon, to save\nhis keeper. (Descent 1871: vol. 1: 87)\n\n\nWhen moral conflict occurs, this is generally attributed to a conflict\nof instincts, with the stronger of two conflicting instincts favored\nby natural selection insofar as it favors group benefit\n(Descent 1871: vol. 1: 84). In human beings the \u201cmore\nenduring Social Instincts\u201d thus come to override the less\npersistent \u201cindividual\u201d instincts (1871: vol. 1: 87).\n\nThe adequacy of evolutionary ethical naturalism as a foundation for\nethical realism has been a point of contention for Darwin\u2019s\ncontemporaries and successors since the publication of the\nDescent. For some moral philosophers, Darwin had simply\nreduced ethics to a property subject to the relativizing tendencies of\nnatural selection (Farber 1994: chp. 5). It was, in the view of\nDarwin\u2019s philosophical critics, to reduce ethics to biology and\nin doing so, to offer no way to distinguish ethical goods from\nsurvival advantages. Not even for some strong supporters of Darwinism,\nsuch as Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace, was Darwin\u2019s\naccount adequate (Farber 1994: chp. 4). Much of subsequent moral\nphilosophy was to be grounded upon the canonical acceptance of the\n\u201cis-ought\u201d distinction,  which developed from this critique of\n\u201cevolutionary\u201d ethical theory. Receiving its most\ninfluential expression in G. E. Moore \u2019s (1873\u20131958)\nPrincipia Ethica (1903)\u2014itself an attack on\nSpencer\u2019s version of evolutionary ethics\u2014, the debate over\nthe adequacy of evolutionary ethics has continued (Hauser 2006; Katz\n(ed.) 2000; Maienschein & Ruse (eds.) 1999).\n5. Summary and Conclusion\n\nThe historiography adopted in this article rejects a simple linear\nstory of the development of Darwinian theory as a history of\nincreasingly true theories leading to a present consensus. Instead it\nfavors a more complicated \u201ccompeting research programs\u201d\nanalysis (Lakatos 1970), programs which through historical competition\nhave resulted in more adequate accounts of the relation of living\nbeings to historical time and naturalistic processes, but which show\nrepeated historical competition with one another .\n\nMore general philosophical issues associated with evolutionary\ntheory\u2014those surrounding natural teleology, ethics, the relation\nof evolutionary naturalism to the claims of religious traditions, the\nimplications for the relation of human beings to the rest of the\norganic world\u2014continue as issues of scholarly inquiry. If\ncontemporary neo-selectionist evolutionary theory displays continuity\nwith select features of the theories of Darwin, alternative\ninterpretations, such as the current movement known as evolutionary\ndevelopmental theory or \u201cevo-devo\u201d, mark a return to\npresumably discarded traditions of the nineteenth and twentieth\ncentury that considered it essential to link evolution with embryonic\ndevelopment and with the effects of external conditions on inheritance\n(Gilbert 2015; Newman 2015; Laubichler & Maienschein 2013, [eds]\n2007; Gissis & Jablonka [eds] 2011; Pigliucci & M\u00fcller\n[eds] 2010; Amundson 2005; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff 1996). Such\ndevelopments suggest that there are still substantial theoretical\nissues at stake that may alter the future understanding of\nevolutionary theory in important ways (Sloan, McKenny, & Eggleson\n[eds] 2015).",
