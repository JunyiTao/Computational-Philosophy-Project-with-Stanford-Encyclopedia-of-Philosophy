    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness\n5. Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness\n\nThere is a diversity of contemporary theories of nonexistent objects,\nwhere \u201ctheory of nonexistent objects\u201d is meant to include\nany theory that attempts to make sense of (alleged) talk about\nnonexistent objects and/or (seeming) intentional directedness to\nnonexistent objects. Some of them, like the de-ontologization strategy\nand fictionalism, take a reductionist route. The de-ontologization\nstrategy claims that there can be true sentences about nonexistent\nobjects, although there are no nonexistent objects. Fictionalism\nclaims that talk about nonexistent objects is not to be taken\nliterally but as a sort of \u201cpretense\u201d. The other worlds\nstrategy makes use of the assumption of merely possible (and even\nimpossible) worlds. Other contemporary theories of nonexistent\nobjects, however, are closer to Meinong\u2019s original theory but\nhave amended MOT\\(^o\\) in such a way as to avoid at least some\nof the abovementioned paradoxes. Those are often called\n\u201cneo-Meinongian theories\u201d. Usually, they adopt either the\nnuclear-extranuclear strategy or the dual copula strategy in order to\nfree Meinongian object theory from inconsistencies and\ncounterintuitive consequences.\n",
