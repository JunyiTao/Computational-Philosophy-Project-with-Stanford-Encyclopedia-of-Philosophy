Clarke, Gillies, Illari,\nRusso, & Williamson 2014). For example, green tea contains\nepigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which seems to be effective at\nkilling cancer cells in petri dishes and in mice (Eisenstein 2019).\nEBM supporters would be inclined to look down on inferences that green\ntea is therefore a wise anti-cancer home health behavior, until there\nis at least epidemiological evidence that green tea drinkers genuinely\ndo have better cancer outcomes. Even then, EBM supporters would want\nto know if the anti-cancer effects are due to EGCG, some combination\nof multiple components of green tea, or perhaps just the relaxing\nsocial act of having a hot beverage. Biomedicine has always valued the\nsort of research that investigates EGCG in petri dishes, in mice, or\nother models used on the laboratory bench, but the dispute is over how\nreliable one takes that research to be for guiding real medical\ndecisions (ought physicians tell patients to drink green tea?).\n\nThe problem of how highly to value bench science is distinct from the\ngeneral objection to hierarchies of evidence (Bluhm 2005). Even if\nevidence isn\u2019t treated as inherently rankable in value, one key\nphilosophical objection is that much of the biomedical research world\nis treated by EBM as less important than clinical patient experiments,\nor meta-analyses of such experimental data. Solomon explains that this\nposition is in tension with a simultaneous trend in biomedicine, an\nincreased concern with translational medicine (an effort to improve\nthe process of moving candidate treatments from (the laboratory) bench\nto (the patient\u2019s) bedside (Solomon 2011). This effort to better\nmanage the biomedical research enterprise has brought with it, \n\n\na restoration of the recognition that clinical research requires an\nengagement with basic theory (e.g., physiological, genetic,\nbiochemical) and a range of empirical techniques such as bedside\nobservation, laboratory and animal studies. (Solomon 2011: 451) \n\n\nIn an openly conciliatory move, the \u201cEBM+\u201d group of\nphilosophers and clinicians (see\n Other Internet Sources),\n offers a defense of the view that mainstream EBM has erred by\nessentially relegating mechanistic evidence, such as EGCG having\nanti-cancer chemical properties, to a subsidiary role (B. Clarke et\nal. 2014).\n",
