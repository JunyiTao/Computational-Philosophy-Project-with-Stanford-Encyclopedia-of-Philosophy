    "main_text": "Solving Dynamic Choice Problems || Plans and Resoluteness\n2.4 Plans and Resoluteness\n\nThe three strategies discussed so far suggest that, to cope with\ndynamic choice problems, one must either mess with one\u2019s\nrationality or else somehow change the payoffs associated with the\noptions one will face. Some philosophers\u2014including, for example,\nMichael Bratman (1999; 2006), David Gauthier (1986; 1994), and Edward\nMcClennen (1990; 1997)\u2014have, however, suggested that the\nrational agent will not need to resort to such gimmicks as often as\none might think\u2014a good thing, since making the necessary\narrangements can require a heavy investment of time, energy, and/or\nmoney. The key to their arguments is the idea that adopting plans can\naffect what it is rational for one to do even when the plans do not\naffect the payoffs associated with the options one will face;\nrelatedly, their arguments incorporate the idea that rationality at\nleast sometimes calls for resolutely sticking to a plan even if the\nplan disallows an action that would fit as well or better with\none\u2019s preferences than the action required by the plan. (For\nsome interesting discussion relating resoluteness, one\u2019s current\noptions, and the options one will face, see Portmore 2019.) For\nBratman, Gauthier, and McClennen, being resolute is not simply useful\nin coping with dynamic choice problems. Rather, it figures as part of\na conception of rationality that resolves the theoretical puzzles\nconcerning rationality and choice over time posed by various dynamic\nchoice problems. In particular, it figures as part of a conception of\nrationality whose dictates provide intuitively sensible guidance not\nonly in simple situations but also in challenging dynamic choice\nsituations. (Significantly, in some of his more recent work, Bratman\n(2014; 2018) distances himself from the idea that rational\nresoluteness involves acting contrary to one\u2019s current\npreferences by suggesting that when rationality calls for sticking to\na plan even if this is not called for by one\u2019s current\npreferences, there may be \u201crational pressure\u201d to change\none\u2019s current preferences.)\n\nWe are, as Michael Bratman (1983; 1987) stresses, planning creatures.\nOur reasoning is structured by our plans, which enable us to achieve\ncomplex personal and social goals. To benefit from planning, one must\ntake plans seriously. For Bratman, this involves, among other things,\n(i) recognizing a general rational pressure favoring sticking to\none\u2019s plan so long as there is no problem with the plan (Bratman\n2006, section 8), and (ii) \u201ctaking seriously how one will see\nmatters at the conclusion of one\u2019s plan, or at appropriate\nstages along the way, in the case of plans or policies that are\nongoing\u201d (1999, 86). In accordance with these proposed\nrequirements, Bratman (1999) concludes that rationality at least\nsometimes calls for sticking to a plan even if this is not called for\nby one\u2019s current preferences. Moreover, although this conception\nof rationality requires that one sometimes resist one\u2019s current\npreferences, it is taken to prompt more sensible choices in\nchallenging dynamic choice situations than do conceptions of\nrationality whose dictates do not take plans seriously.\n\nThe significance of the first requirement is easy to see. If there is\na general rational pressure favoring sticking to one\u2019s plan so\nlong as there is no problem with it, then a rational agent that takes\nplans seriously will not get into the sort of trouble Broome imagines\nAbraham might get into. When faced with incommensurable alternatives,\nthe rational agent who takes plans seriously will adopt a plan and\nthen stick to it even if his preferences are consistent with pursuing\nan alternative course of action.\n\nWhat about the significance of the second requirement? For Bratman, if\none is concerned about how one will see matters at the conclusion of\none\u2019s plan or at appropriate stages along the way, then one\nwill, other things equal, avoid adjusting one\u2019s plan in ways\nthat one will regret in the future. So Bratman\u2019s planning\nconception of rationality includes a \u201cno-regret\ncondition.\u201d And, according to Bratman, given this condition, his\nconception of rationality gives intuitively plausible guidance in\ncases of temptation like the case of the self-torturer or the\nretirement contribution case. In particular, it implies that, in such\ncases, the rational planner will adopt a plan and refrain from\nadjusting it. For in both sorts of cases, if the simple fact that\none\u2019s preferences favor adjusting one\u2019s plan leads one to\nadjust it, one is bound to end up, via repeated adjustments of\none\u2019s plan, in the situation one finds unacceptable. One is thus\nbound to experience future regret. And, while Bratman allows that\nregret can sometimes be misguided\u2014which is why he does not\npresent avoiding regret as an exceptionless imperative\u2014there are\nnot, for Bratman, any special considerations that would make regret\nmisguided if one gave into temptation in cases like the case of the\nself-torturer or the retirement contribution case.\n\nBased on their own reasoning concerning rational resoluteness,\nGauthier (1994) and McClennen (1990; 1997) argue that rational\nresoluteness can help an agent do well in autonomous benefit cases\nlike the toxin case. They maintain that being rational is not a matter\nof always choosing the action that best serves one\u2019s concerns.\nRather it is a matter of acting in accordance with the deliberative\nprocedure that best serves one\u2019s concerns. Now it might seem as\nthough the deliberative procedure that best serves one\u2019s\nconcerns must be the deliberative procedure that calls for always\nchoosing the action that best serves one\u2019s concerns. But\nautonomous benefit cases like the toxin case suggest that this is not\nquite right. For, the deliberative procedure that calls for always\nchoosing the action that best serves one\u2019s concerns does not\nserve one\u2019s concerns well in autonomous benefit cases. More\nspecifically, someone who reasons in accordance with this deliberative\nprocedure does worse in autonomous benefit cases than someone who is\nwilling to resolutely stick to a prior plan that he did well to adopt.\nAccordingly, Gauthier and McClennen deny that the best deliberative\nprocedure requires one to always choose the action that best serves\none\u2019s concerns; in their view, the best deliberative procedure\nrequires some resoluteness. Relatedly, they see drinking the toxin in\naccordance with a prior plan to drink the toxin as rational, indeed as\nrationally required, given that one did well to adopt the plan; so\nrationality helps one benefit, rather than hindering one from\nbenefiting, in autonomous benefit cases like the toxin case.\n\nNote that, while there is widespread agreement that a plausible\nconception of rationality will imply that the self-torturer should\nresist the temptation to keep advancing one more setting, there is no\nwidespread agreement that a plausible conception of rationality will\nimply that it is rational to drink the toxin. For those who find the\nidea that it is rational to drink the toxin completely\ncounter-intuitive, its emergence figures as a problematic, rather than\nwelcome, implication of Gauthier\u2019s and McClennen\u2019s views\nconcerning rational resoluteness.\n\nIf Bratman and/or Gauthier and McClennen are on the right\ntrack\u2014and this is, of course, a big if\u2014then (some form of)\nresoluteness may often be the key to keeping oneself out of potential\ndynamic choice traps. It may also be the key to resolving various\npuzzles concerning rationality and dynamic choice.\n\nIn an interesting critique of planning solutions to cases of\ntemptation, Tenenbaum and Raffman (2012) challenge the purported\ncentrality of resoluteness. They suggest that, in cases of temptation,\ninstrumental rationality may not require planning and resoluteness,\nbut simply exercising \u201csufficiently many\u201d\n\u201cpermissions\u201d to do something other than what \u201cwould\nbe best at a given moment\u201d when this is required by a\n\u201crationally innocent\u201d goal or project. For instance,\n\u201csuppose you take a break from writing an important memo and\nstart surfing the web. Surely surfing for one additional second will\nnot prevent you from completing the memo, but if you surf for long\nenough you won\u2019t have time to finish it\u201d (110).\nInstrumental rationality requires that you stop surfing at an\nacceptable point. But this need not involve stopping at a point\ndetermined by a prior plan. Whether or not you have a plan to stop at\ntime t, and whether or not you resolutely adhere to such a plan need\nnot be of crucial importance. What matters is that, ultimately, you\nstop in good time by exercising, at one or more points, the rational\npermission to do something other than what would be best at that\nmoment with an eye to achieving the rationally innocent goal of\ncompleting the important memo. Tenenbaum (forthcoming) develops a\ntheory of instrumental rationality that illuminates and accommodates\nthe need to exercise rational permissions of the sort just\ndescribed.\n",
