    "main_text": "Definitions of Disability || Philosophical discussion of Official Definitions of Disability\n2.1 Philosophical discussion of Official Definitions of Disability\n\nThus, two familiar features are shared by most official definitions of\ndisability, such as those in the World Health Organization (1980,\n2001), the Disability Discrimination Act (UK), and the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (United States): (i) a physical or mental\ncharacteristic labeled or perceived as an impairment or dysfunction\nand (ii) some personal or social limitation associated with that\nimpairment. Impairments are generally seen as traits of the\nindividual that he or she cannot readily alter. Just what makes a\ncondition a trait or attribute of an individual is obscure and\ndebatable, but there seems to be agreement on clear cases. Thus,\npoverty is not seen as an impairment, however disabling it may be, nor\nis tasteless clothing, even if it is a manifestation of impaired\nfashion-sense rather than scarce income. On the other hand, diseases\nare generally classified as impairments, even though they are often\nneither permanent nor static conditions. Diseases that are especially\ntransient, however, such as the flu and the measles, do not normally\ncount as impairments.\n\nAs in early philosophical debates about competing models, the most\ncontroversial issue in defining disability is the relationship between\nthese two features. At one extreme are definitions that imply, or are\nread to imply, that biological impairments are the sole causes of\nlimitation. The definitions in the World Health Organization\u2019s\n1980 International Classification of Impairment, Disability, and\nHandicap, and the Disability Discrimination Act (UK) have been\ninterpreted this way. At the other extreme are definitions that\nrestrict the limitations faced by disabled people (as such) solely to\n\u201ccontemporary social organization\u201d, such as the definition\ngiven by the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation\n(UPIAS 1976). In between are definitions which assert that individual\nimpairment and the social environment are jointly sufficient\ncauses of limitation. Perhaps the best-known example is the\nWHO\u2019s International Classification of Functioning, Disability\nand Health (World Health Organization 2001, referred to as ICF), which\nemphasizes that disability is a \u201cdynamic interaction between\nhealth conditions and environmental and personal factors\u201d.\n\nThrough much of the first two decades of this century, philosophers\nwere largely content with this definitional approach to disability as\na relationship or interaction, disagreeing primarily on the\ncomparative contribution of the two elements and the policy relevance\nof their contributions. As noted in the last section, dissenters\nmainly focused on the characterization of one or both elements, as,\ne.g., on the first as social vs. biological, rather than on the\n\u201canatomy\u201d itself. More recently, however, there has been\nsome movement away from reliance on these two-part approaches to\ndefining disability (e.g., Barnes 2016, and much of the literature\nresponding). One reason may be that in most settings, we do not think\nof or refer to disabilities as relationships or interactions, but as\nindividual somatic or psychic traits, states or conditions (including\nabsences and deficiencies). These commonsense referents are hard to\nfind in, for example, the multifactorial charts by which the ICF\nillustrates its definition of disability as a complex interaction of\nhealth conditions with environmental, social, and personal\nfactors.\n\nSome might argue that ordinary usage is ideological, shaped by false\nfailure to be conscious of the insights of social and interactionist\nmodels. But defining \u201cdisability\u201d in rough conformity to\nordinary usage hardly implies that its referents are selected by\nbiomedical criteria, let alone that the traits selected cause the\ndisadvantages faced by their bearers or dictate the appropriate social\nresponse to those disadvantages. Rather, this view on what\n\u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cpeople with disabilities\u201d\nrefer to is compatible with a wide variety of positions on how those\nreferents are picked out: e.g., by biomedical criteria; by the rules\nof a civil-rights movement; by the assumptions of the dominant\nideology about bodily dysfunction; or by the demands of justice. The\nextent to which what counts as a disability, or a person with a\ndisability, varies with context will depend on the account adopted; on\nbiomedical accounts, the extension of \u201cdisability\u201d will be\nas stable as human biology; on other accounts, it will change with\nchanging social norms, economic needs, or political developments.\nFurther, on some accounts, the referents will have common features,\nidentifiable by inspection; on others, what they have in common can\nonly be understood in terms of an ideology or a theory of justice.\n\nAfter discussing several types of accounts, we will address the claim,\ninspired by the diversity of traits and conditions they pick out, that\n\u201cdisability\u201d has no core meaning, and that it may be\nfutile and distracting to search for one.\n",
