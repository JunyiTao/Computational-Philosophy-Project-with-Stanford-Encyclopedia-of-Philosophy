    "main_text": "The Problem of Idealization\n6. The Problem of Idealization\n\nA worry about Bayesian epistemology is that the two core Bayesian\nnorms are so demanding that they can be followed only by highly\nidealized agents\u2014being logically omniscient, with\nprecise credences that always fit together\nperfectly. This is the problem of idealization, which was\npresented in the tutorial\n section 1.9.\n This section surveys three reply strategies for Bayesians, which\nmight complement each other. As will become clear below, the work on\nthis problem is quite interdisciplinary, with contributions from\nepistemologists as well as scientists and other philosophers.\n",
