    "main_text": "The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam || Existence (wuj\u016bd) and Essence (m\u0101hiyyah)\n2.7 Existence (wuj\u016bd) and Essence (m\u0101hiyyah)\nKhayyam offers a series of arguments for the thesis that \u201cexistence is a \u2018considerational\u2019 attribute\u201d (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 106; The Light of the Intellect, Nadvi (ed.) 1933 [2010, 347\u20139]). In section seventeen of On Existence, entitled \u201cExistence is an added meaning (ma\u2018n\u0101) to the intelligible essence,\u201d he writes, \u201cAnd it is as if [the soul/intellect] encounters existence in all things, by way of accidents, and there is no doubt that existence is a meaning added to the intelligible essence\u201d (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 111). By \u201cby way of accidents\u201d Khayyam should mean as a form of accident, and \u201caccident\u201d should be used here in the sense of predicable, not one of the nine Aristotelian categories of accidents. The \u201cadditionality\u201d should also mean \u201cbeing additional in intellectu,\u201d not in re. By relying on reductio ad absurdum, he concludes that if existence were to be an existential attribute, it would have to exist prior to itself, which is impossible. Khayyam states \u201cessence (\u1e0f\u0101t) was non-existent and then became existent.\u201d He goes on to argue that \u201cessence does not need existence [before coming to existence] or a relation to existence because the essence prior to existing was non-existing (ma\u201bd\u016bm), thus how can something need something else prior to its existence?\u201d (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 110). Towards the end of this treatise he uses the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation to explain the origin of essences and states: \u201cTherefore, it became clear that all essences (\u1e0faw\u0101t) and quiddities (m\u0101hiyy\u0101t) emanate from the essence of the First Exalted Origin, in an orderly fashion, may glory be upon Him\u201d (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 118).\nIn Aminrazavi and Van Brummelen (2017) earlier edition of this entry, as well as in Nasr (The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher) and Aminrazavi 2007, 168\u201371), it is suggested that \u201cClearly Khayyam supports the principality of essence\u201d (i.e., the second view) among the following three views:\n\nThe existence of an existent is the same as its essence. This view is attributed to Abu\u2019l-H\u0323asan Ash\u2018ar\u012b, Abu\u2019l-H\u0323asan Bas\u0323r\u012b, and some of the other Ash\u2018arite theologians.\nCommonly known as the principality of essence (as\u0323\u0101lat al-m\u0101hiyyah), this view maintains that essence is primary and existence is added to it. Many philosophers such as Ab\u016b H\u0101shim Jub\u0101\u2019\u012b and later Suhraward\u012b and M\u012br D\u0101m\u0101d came to advocate this view.\nCommonly known as the principality of existence (as\u0323\u0101lat al-wuj\u016bd), this view maintains that existence is primary and essence is then added (Aminrazavi 2007, 168).\n\nNasr (The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher) who prefers the same reading, that is \u201cKhayyam asserts that for each existent, it is the quiddity that is principal while wujud is a conceptual (i\u2018tibari) quality,\u201d immediately qualifies his view by adding that \u201cthe distinction between the principality of wujud (asalat al-wujud) and the principality of mahiyyah (asalat al-mahiyyah) goes back to the School of Isfahan and especially Mulla Sadra,\u201d and Khayyam \u201cdoes not use the term asalat al-mahiyyah as was done by Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101.\u201d We find Nasr\u2019s comment on the notion of \u201cprincipality\u201d important and take it to indicate that there may be room to argue that not only the term \u201cprincipality of quiddity\u201d but also the corresponding concept is absent from Khayyam\u2019s philosophical treatises. What one finds in Khayyam\u2019s work is a series of arguments for the thesis that existence is a considerational (or \u201csecondary\u201d as translated by Aminrazavi) attribute. If one further grants the conditional claim that if existence is a considerational attribute, then quiddity is principal (in the sense at stake in the debate over the principality of existence vs. the principality of quiddity in the post Isfahan school). Thus, one might derive the conclusion that Khayyam supports the principality of quiddity. The latter conditional presumption, however, is in need of a sound argument, and as far we can see, no such argument has yet been provided.\nAminrazavi and Van Brummelen (2017) then explain that \u201ca more careful reading reveals an interesting twist: namely, that Khayyam\u2019s understanding of how essences came to be casts doubt on his belief in the principality of essence\u201d (Note: we have translated al-m\u0101hiyyah as \u201cquiddity,\u201d not \u201cessence\u201d). This comment may strengthen our hypothesis that Khayyam does not support the principality of quiddity in the first place, at least in the sense rejected by Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 and his followers. Perhaps Khayyam does not offer an argument against it either (if he does not work with the notion of principality in question). Aminrazavi and Van Brummelen (2017) then continue: \u201cTowards the end of the Ris\u0101lah fi\u2019l-wuj\u016bd he uses the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation to explain the origin of essences [...] Khayyam replaces essence with existence here and the question is whether he equates them and thereby deviates from his teacher Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. [...] It appears that Khayyam equates existence and essence as having emanated from God in an orderly fashion, but there is no explanation of how essence becomes primary and existence secondary. In fact, if existence did not exist how could essences come to be?\u201d After discussing all these \u201cproblems,\u201d they conclude: \u201cAlthough the distinction between the principality of wuj\u016bd (as\u0323\u0101lat al-wuj\u016bd) and the principality of m\u0101hiyyah (as\u0323\u0101lat al-m\u0101hiyyah) can be found among early Muslim philosophers, the subject matter became particularly significant in later Islamic philosophy, especially through the School of Is\u0323fah\u0101n and the work of its most outstanding figure, Mull\u0101 S\u0323adr\u0101. This is important for our discussion since Umar Khayyam may simply have presented the arguments for and against the priority and posterity of essence and existence without attaching much significance to their philosophical consequences, as was the case in later Islamic philosophy\u201d (Aminrazavi and Van Brummelen 2017).\nThe above concerns and the ensuing questions are based on the assumption that Khayyam supports the principality of quiddity, which in turn stems from casting a post Is\u0323fah\u0101n school conceptual framework on Khayyam\u2019s philosophy. This latter interpretational strategy, however, requires proper doctrinal and textual justification. In the absence of such evidence, Khayyam\u2019s view that existence is a considerational attribute does not seem to imply the principality of quiddity and hence may not be subject to the above criticisms.\nIn The Light of the Intellect, Khayyam offers three reasons why existence is not added to essence in re. A summary of his reasons goes as follows:\n\nExistence cannot be added to essence in re; otherwise an infinite regress will follow, which is untenable.\nExistence is not added to essence in re; otherwise essence should have existed prior to its existence, and this is absurd.\nWith regard to the Necessary Existence, existence clearly is not added to essence in re, for dualism would follow.\n\nSome have also read The Light of the Intellect as providing an argument for the principality of essence (or quiddity); we believe such readings face problems similar to the ones discussed above. This treatise reconfirms the view that Khayyam believes that existence, oneness, and many other key metaphysical and scientific attributes (e.g., color), are considerational, not existential, attributes.\nKhayyam\u2019s philosophical works are the least studied aspects of his thought, and were not even available in published form until a few years ago. They permit a fresh look at overall Khayyamian thought and prove indispensable to an understanding of his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t. In his philosophical works, Khayyam writes as a Muslim philosopher and treats a variety of traditional philosophical problems in a careful manner; but in his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, our Muslim philosopher morphs into an agnostic Epicurean, or so it seems. A detailed study of Khayyam\u2019s philosophical works reveals several explanations for this dichotomy, the most likely of which is the conflict between pure and practical reasoning. Whereas such questions as theodicy, the existence of God, soul and the possibility of life after death may be argued for philosophically, such arguments hardly seem relevant to the human condition, given our daily share of suffering.\nIt is in light of the distinction between \u201cis\u201d and \u201cought,\u201d the \u201cideal\u201d and the \u201cactual,\u201d that discrepancies between Khayyam\u2019s Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t and his philosophical views should be understood. Khayyam\u2019s Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t are the works of a sober philosopher and not those of a hedonistic poet. Whereas Khayyam the philosopher-mathematician justifies theism based on the existing order in the universe, Khayyam the poet, for whom suffering in the world remains insoluble, does not talk about theism, or any type of eschatological doctrine, as a solution to the problem of the meaning of human existence.\n",
