    "main_text": "The Legal Validity and Justification of Legal Rights\n1. The Legal Validity and Justification of Legal Rights\n\nLegal rights are creatures of the law. As such, their legal\nvalidity\u2014that is, a right\u2019s status as\nlegal\u2014typically flows from other legal norms or from a source of\nlaw (MacCormick 1977: 189 & 206; Sumner 1987: 68\u201370; Raz\n1994: 263\u2013268). \n\nBroadly speaking, there are two primary legal mechanisms for the\ncreation (or detraction) of (valid) legal rights. One is \u201cacts\nof law\u201d, that is legal rules or judicial decisions directly\nbestowing rights. A second mechanism involves the legal recognition of\ncertain actions intended to create certain legal rights as in fact\nconstitutive of those rights, be those actions unilateral (typical of\ngifts, forfeiture, consent, appointment, last will and testament) or\nagreements (typical of contracts) (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n333\u2013341; Paton 1972: 319\u2013320 & 433\u2013485). \n\nThese legal mechanisms can create rights explicitly (Raz 1994: 268).\nFor example, according to the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution: \n\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search and seizure,\nshall not be violated\u2026. (emphasis added) \n\n\nLegal rights are also created implicitly (Raz 1994: 268). For\ninstance, by establishing legal relations exhibiting the forms and\nfunctions of a right, a legal rule can thereby vest a legal right\nwithout explicitly mentioning the term \u201cright\u201d (MacCormick\n1977: 191\u201392). Take for example the First Amendment of\nthe U.S. Constitution, widely recognized as establishing\nlegal rights to freedom of religion and speech\u2014even though the\namendment only mentions \u201cfree exercise\u201d and\n\u201cfreedom\u201d, not \u201cright\u201d.\n\nMoreover, in holding certain conduct to be wrongful to X and/or\nin granting X a corresponding right to a remedy, legal rules\ncan arguably grant X a legal right against such conduct. For\nexample, the American common law tort of battery involves an\nintentional, unlawful, and harmful or offensive contact with the\nperson of another, never mentioning a \u201cright against\nbattery\u201d. Yet, in laying down a rule against battery and in\nrecognizing battery as wrongful, the law thereby arguably grants a\nlegal right against it (Goldberg & Zipursky 2020: 92\u201398).\nMoreover, following the logic of \u201cwhere there\u2019s a remedy,\nthere\u2019s a right\u201d (ubi remedium ibi\njus)\u2014law\u2019s granting victims of battery remedial\nrights (or rights of action) against the persons who battered them, is\nat least suggestive that law also grants a legal right against\nbattery\u2014a right that, if violated, is what legally justifies the\nremedy (Raz 1994: 266\u2013267). \n\nLegal justification is a matter of legal normativity, not validity.\nTypically, justification involves a legal norm grounding\u2014as a\nmatter of law\u2014other legal norms. (Raz 1970: 175\u2013183;\nMacCormick 1977: 189; Raz 1994: 258\u2013263; Wellman 1995:\n24\u201329). For instance, given that Joseph is a person, that\n\u201cJoseph holds a legal right in his good name\u201d is justified\nby the more general rule \u201cevery person has a right in his/her\ngood name\u201d. Now, whether or not Joseph\u2019s right in his good\nname is legally valid turns on whether, for example, the\ncourts or legislature recognize it. Yet, whether or not the courts or\nlegislator are correct\u2014as a matter of law\u2014in recognizing\nJoseph\u2019s right is a question of legal justification, such as\nwhether the right is entailed by another more general legal norm or\nprinciple, or whether it passes constitutional muster. Therefore, as\ndemonstrated in judicial errors of law, it is possible for rights to\nbe valid yet not justified, as well as justified yet invalid (see\ngenerally Hart 1961: 141\u2013147). \n\nLegal rights can justify other legal rights (Raz 1994: 268\u2013269;\nWellman 1995: 25\u201329). For instance, courts may find that one\nright derives from another (Raz 1986: 168\u2013170). Such derivation\ncan flow from the content of the justifying core right, such\nthat the derivative right falls within the scope of the more general\nright from which it derives. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court held\nthat the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent to the more\ngeneral constitutionally protected liberty of the person\n(Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 [2015]). \n\nRights can also justify other rights when the successful exercise and\nimplementation of the latter is dependent on the former (Wellman 1995:\n26\u201327). The stronger the dependency, the stronger the\njustification (Nickel 2007: 87\u201388). Consider, for example, the\nU.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Griswold v. Connecticut\n(1965) that:\n\n\nThe right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right\nto utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to\nreceive, the right to read \u2026 and freedom of inquiry, freedom of\nthought, and freedom to teach \u2026 Without those peripheral\nrights, the specific rights would be less secure. (482\u2013483) \n\n\nNotice that this conception of legal validity and justification flows\nfrom the tradition of\n legal positivism\n in general jurisprudence. That said, the elucidation that follows of\nthe concept of \u201clegal rights\u201d is mostly compatible with\nother jurisprudential traditions as well.\n",
