Fung Yu-lan's \u201cWhy China Has No Science\u201d\n\nIn a paper titled \u201cWhy China Has No Science,\u201d published\nin 1922, Fung Yu-lan [Feng Youlan] \u99ae\u53cb\u862d\n(1895\u20131990), then a student of John Dewey, argued that: \u201cwhat\nkeeps China back is that she has no science,\u201d but that:\n\u201cChina has no science, because according to her own standard of\nvalue she does not need any.\u201d(1922, 237 and 238). To make\nthis argument, he introduces what he calls two tendencies in Chinese\nphilosophy, which he calls \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cart\u201d\nor \u201chuman,\u201d referring to the products of human\nartifice. On his account, the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BCE)\ndeveloped two philosophies, Daoism and Mohism respectively, which\nfollowed these two tendencies to extreme, and a third, Confucianism,\nwhich he represents as a compromise between them. On Fung's\nexplanation, the Daoists considered nature perfect while the Mohists\nsought to improve on it (1922, 238\u201339). They valued utility above all\nelse, and Fung considers them \u201cscientific\u201d in spirit,\nincluding their interest in logic and definition. Mohism, as he\nputs it, stood for art as over against nature (1922, 244\u201350). He\ndoes not explain how his \u201cConfucianism\u201d is a compromise\nbetween these two extremes, all the more so since he distinguishes the\n\u201cnature\u201d oriented Confucianism of Mencius (372\u2013289 BCE)\nfrom the \u201cart\u201d-oriented Confucianism of Xunzi (313-238\nBCE), who aspired to conquer nature instead of returning to it:\n\u201cIt is better to treat nature as a thing and regulate it than to\nconsider it very great and always think of it. It is better to control\nnature and use it than to follow and admire it.\u201d This, Fung\nremarks, is nearly the same as the Baconian conception of power\n(1922, 256, quoting from an unspecified passage in the\n\u201cDiscourse on Heaven\u201d (Tian lun) chapter of the\nXunzi. For a study of this chapter see Machle 1993).\n\nFung goes on to argue that, after the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE) the\n\u201cart\u201d or scientific tendency within Chinese philosophy all\nbut disappeared. Buddhism, like Daoism, was an extreme\n\u201cnature\u201d philosophy, and the interactions of Daoism,\nBuddhism and Confucianism did not produce interest in the understanding\nof the natural world. In the tenth century CE the Song Neo-Confucians\ncombined Daoist, Confucian and Buddhist teachings into a new philosophy\nthat has persisted to the present. According to the \u201cGreat\nLearning\u201d (Da xue), the ancients who wished to enlighten\ntheir bright virtue \u201cinvestigated things\u201d:\n\nWishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the\nutmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the\ninvestigation of things (zhi zhi zai ge wu\n\u81f4\u77e5\u5728\u683c\u7269). Things being investigated,\nknowledge became complete (Da xue, 412).\n\nBut Neo-Confucian philosophers disagreed about what\n\u201cthings\u201d to investigate. Some took\n\u201cthings\u201d as external, but did not pursue the investigation\nof the empirical world. The other, prevailing view took\n\u201cthings\u201d to refer to the mind. Fung points out that\nthe Song dynasty (960\u20131279) corresponded to the period of the\ndevelopment of modern science in Europe, but Europeans developed\ntechniques for understanding and controlling matter, while the Chinese\nNeo-Confucians developed techniques for understanding and controlling\nmind (1922, 256\u201358).\n\nThe point of this discussion of Fung's study is his argument that,\never since the disappearance of the \u201cnature\u201d tendency,\nChinese philosophy has devoted itself to the cultivation of the mind\n(xin \u5fc3), at the expense of any interest in, or need\nfor, science, or any inquiry into nature. (Because the meaning of\nxin \u2013 \u201cmind,\u201d or more properly\n\u201cheart-mind\u201d \u2013 is much broader than the English term\nmind, cultivating it refers to a much broader kind of cognitive,\nintellectual, physical and spiritual cultivation than the phrase\n\u201ccultivation of the mind\u201d suggests.) By contrast, he\nargues, the ancestors of modern European philosophy had two\n\u201cuses\u201d for science: according to Descartes, it provided\ncertainty; according to Bacon, it offered power. But, Fung\nargues, China did not discover the scientific method because Chinese\nthought started from the mind, and did not require proof or logical or\nempirical demonstration. Instead, Chinese philosophers preferred\nthe certainty of perception, and thus: \u201cwould not, and did not\ntranslate their concrete vision into the form of science. In one word\nChina has no science, because of all philosophies the Chinese\nphilosophy is the most human and the most practical\u201d (1922,\n260). Fung concludes: \u201cit is because of the fact that the\nChinese ideal prefers enjoyment to power that China has no need of\nscience, even though science, according to Bacon, is for power. The\nChinese philosophers, as I said just now, had no need of scientific\ncertainty, because it was themselves that they wished to know; so in\nthe same way they had no need of the power of science, because it was\nthemselves that they wished to conquer\u201d (1922, 261).\n\nIn summary, although Fung Yu-lan's account of Warring States\nphilosophy is open to question, he gives a compelling version of a type\nof claim for philosophical reasons why science did not develop in\nChina. I now turn to the opposite argument that science did\ndevelop \u2013 and flourish \u2013 in both early China and the Song\n\u201cNeo-Confucian\u201d period.\n",
