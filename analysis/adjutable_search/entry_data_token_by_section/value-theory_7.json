    "main_text": "Relation to the Deontic\n3. Relation to the Deontic\n\nOne of the biggest and most important questions about value is the\nmatter of its relation to the deontic \u2014 to categories like\nright, reason, rational, just, and\nought. According to teleological views, of which\nclassical consequentialism and universalizable egoism are classic\nexamples, deontic categories are posterior to and to be explained in\nterms of evaluative categories like good and good for.\nThe contrasting view, according to which deontic categories are prior\nto, and explain, the evaluative categories, is one which, as Aristotle\nsays, has no name. But its most important genus is that of\n\u201cfitting attitude\u201d accounts, and Scanlon\u2019s [1998]\n\u201cbuck-passing\u201d theory is another closely related\ncontemporary example.\n",
