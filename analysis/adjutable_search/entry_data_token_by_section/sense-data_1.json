    "main_text": "Historical\n2. Historical\n\nThe philosophical practice of separating what is immediately given to\nvision by way of sense impression from further psychological or\nlogical acts of perception stems from\n antiquity.[3]\n In the optical tradition (where \u201coptics\u201d covered the\ncomplete science of vision, from physics and physiology to\npsychology), the medieval Islamic philosopher Ibn al-Haytham (ca.\n1030) distinguished what is found in \u201cpure sensation\u201d, the\nimmediate result of stimulating the sense organs, from what depends on\nrecognition, judgment, and reason (Optics, II.3.25). Arguably\n(Hatfield 2020: 200), he included light, color, and visual direction\n(a correlate of shape) among the things immediately sensed. The\noptical tradition as promulgated in the medieval European Latin West\nprovided a framework for the theories of vision of Descartes and\nBerkeley (Hatfield & Epstein 1979: 371). The distinction between\n(a) a core of sensation and (b) perception of objects in the world as\nthe result of further psychological processes provided the predominant\nframework for theorizing about the senses into the twentieth\n century.[4]\n The proximate background for the arguments about sense data just\nafter 1900 was set by engagement with early modern philosophy and\nnineteenth-century British philosophy.\n",
