    "main_text": "Social Construction || Construction and Constitution\n2.3 Construction and Constitution\n\nThere is yet a further sense in which something might be a social\nconstruction. So far we\u2019ve been focusing on social causation: to\nsay that something is socially constructed is to say that it is caused\nto be a certain way, and the causal process involves social factors,\ne.g., social forces were largely responsible for my coming to have the\nidea of a husband, and social forces were largely responsible for\nthere being husbands. But often when theorists argue that something is\na social construction the point is not about causation. Rather, the\npoint is to distinguish social kinds from physical kinds. In the case\nof gender, the point is that gender is not a classification scheme\nbased simply on anatomical or biological differences, but marks social\ndifferences between individuals. Gender, as opposed to sex, is not\nabout testicles and ovaries, the penis and the uterus, but about a\nsystem of social categories (see, e.g., Haslanger 1993, 2000b; also\nWittig 1992; Delphy 1984; MacKinnon 1989).\n\nConsider, for example, the category of landlords. To be a landlord one\nmust be located within a broad system of social and economic relations\nwhich includes tenants, private property, and the like. It might be\nthat all and only landlords have a mole behind their left ear. But\neven if this were the case, having this physical mark is not what it\nis to be a landlord. Similarly, one might want to draw a distinction\nbetween sex and gender, sex being an anatomical distinction based on\nlocally salient sexual/reproductive differences (see \u00c1sta\nSveinsd\u00f3ttir 2011 for an alternative conception), and gender\nbeing a distinction between the social/political positions of those\nwith bodies marked as of different sexes. One could allow that the\ncategories of sex and gender interact (so concerns with distinctions\nbetween bodies will influence social divisions and vice versa); but\neven to be clear how they interact, we should differentiate them. With\nthis distinction between sex and gender in hand, it is possible that\nsome males are women and some females are men. Because, on this\nconception, one is a female by virtue of some (variable) set of\nanatomical features, and one is a woman by virtue of one\u2019s\nposition within a social and economic system, the sex/gender\ndistinction gives us some (at least preliminary) resources for\nincluding trans* people within our conceptual framework (see further\nBettcher 2014).\n\nIn considering this form of social construction, or we might call it\nsocial constitution, it is important to note that social kinds cannot\nbe equated with things that have social causes. Sociobiologists claim\nthat some social phenomena have biological causes; some feminists\nclaim that anatomical phenomena have social causes, e.g., the gap in\naverage height and strength differences between men and women in a\nparticular context depends on, among other things, gender norms in\nthat context concerning food and\n exercise.[5]\n As Ruth Hubbard explains,\n\n\n\u2026we live in dynamic interaction with our environment. Sex\ndifferences are socially constructed because being raised as a girl or\na boy produces biological as well as social differences. Society\ndefines the sex-appropriate behavior to which each of us learns to\nconform, and our behavior affects our bones, muscles, sense organs,\nnerves, brain, lungs, circulation, everything. In this way society\nconstructs us as biologically, as well as socially, gendered people.\n(Hubbard 1990: 138) \n\n\nIt is also significant that not all social kinds are obviously social.\nSometimes it is assumed that the conditions for membership in a kind\nconcern only or primarily biological or physical facts. Pointing out\nthat this is wrong can have important consequences. For example, the\nidea that whether or not a person is white is not simply a matter of\ntheir physical features, but concerns their position in a social\nmatrix, has been politically significant, and to many surprising. How\nshould we construe the constructionist project of arguing that a\nparticular kind is a social kind? What could be interesting or radical\nabout such a project?\n\nSuppose Sally says \u201cI am a white woman\u201d. What does this\nmean? Suppose we pose these questions to someone who is not a\nphilosopher, someone not familiar with the academic social\nconstructionist literature. A likely response will involve mention of\nher physical features: reproductive organs, skin color, etc. The\ngender and race constructionists will reject this response and will\nargue that what makes the claim apt concerns the social relations in\nwhich she stands. On this construal, the important social\nconstructionist import in Beauvoir\u2019s claim that \u201cone is\nnot born but rather becomes a woman\u201d, (Beauvoir 1949) is not\nthat one is caused to be feminine by social forces; rather, the\nimportant insight was that being a woman is not an anatomical matter\nbut a social matter.\n\nBecause being a woman is a social matter, if we allow that social\nphenomena are highly variable across time, cultures, groups, then this\nalso allows us to recognize that the specific details of it is to be a\nwoman will differ depending on one\u2019s race, ethnicity, class,\netc. Sally\u2019s being a woman occurs in a context in which she is\nalso white and privileged; her actual social position will therefore\nbe affected by multiple factors simultaneously. She learned the norms\nof WASP womanhood, not Black womanhood. And even if she rejected many\nof those norms, she benefits from the fact that they are broadly\naccepted.\n\nThe social constructionist\u2019s goal is often to challenge the\nappearance of inevitability of the category in question; as things are\narranged now, there are men and women, and people of different races.\nBut if social conditions changed substantially, there would be no men\nand women, and no people of different races. It would be possible,\nthen, to do away with the conceptual frameworks that we currently use.\nBut an important first step is to make the category visible as a\nsocial as opposed to physical category. This sometimes requires a\nrather radical change in our thinking.\n\nIt is worth keeping in mind, also, that constitutive social\nconstructionist projects offer a metaphysics of the category in\nquestion, i.e., an answer to the question what the nature of the\ncategory is. Causal constructionist projects do not do that, but\nrather cast light on the ways in which social practices are implicated\nas the causes or effects of phenomena (\u00c1sta Sveinsd\u00f3ttir\n2015).\n\nConsiderable amount of recent work has focused on the metaphysics of\nsocial kinds and social properties more generally (Frye 2011; Mikkola\n2006, 2011; Stoljar 2011; \u00c1sta Sveinsd\u00f3ttir 2011; Witt\n2011a,c). There has also been a lot of attention given to accounts of\ngender. We turn to that now.\n",
