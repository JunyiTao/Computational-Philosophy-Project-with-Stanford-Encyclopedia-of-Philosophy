    "main_text": "Maximizing Rationality\n5. Maximizing Rationality\n\n\nHumean proponents of structural approaches to practical reason have\nattempted to accommodate the rational criticism of individual ends,\nwithout departing from the spirit of\nZweckrationalit\u00e4t, by expanding their view to encompass\nthe totality of an agent\u2019s ends. Thus, even if there are no\nreasons or values that are ultimately independent of an agent\u2019s\ngiven ends, the possibility remains that we could criticize particular\nintrinsic desires by reference to others in an agent\u2019s\nsubjective motivational set. An agent\u2019s desire for leisure, for\ninstance, might be subordinated insofar as its satisfaction would\nfrustrate the realization of other goals that are subjectively more\nimportant to the agent, such as professional success. Practical\nreason, it might be suggested, is a holistic enterprise, properly\nconcerned not merely with identifying means to the realization of\nindividual ends, but with the coordinated achievement of the totality\nof an agent\u2019s ends.\n\n\nMany philosophers take this holistic approach to be the most promising\nway of thinking about the tasks of practical reason. It defines an\nimportant and difficult problem for practical reason to address,\nwithout departing from the metaphysically modest assumption that there\nis no court of appeal for the rational criticism of an agent\u2019s ends\nthat is independent of those ends themselves. The holistic approach\nfinds its most sophisticated and influential expression in the\nmaximizing conception of practical rationality. According to the\nmaximizing conception, the fundamental task of practical reason is to\ndetermine which course of action would optimally advance the agent\u2019s\ncomplete set of ends. Thus it is widely accepted that the rational\naction for a given agent to take is the one whose subjective expected\nutility\u2014reflecting both the utility of possible outcomes, from\nthe agent\u2019s point of view, and the agent\u2019s beliefs about the\nprobability of those outcomes\u2014is the highest. \n\n\nThe maximizing conception of practical rationality has been\ninfluentially developed in decision theory and in the theory of\nrational choice (as studied, for instance, in modern economics). These\ndisciplines articulate with mathematical precision the basic idea that\npractical rationality is a matter of consistency in action: people act\nrationally to the extent they do what is likely to bring about the\nbest state of affairs, given both their preferences over the outcomes\nthat may be brought about through their agency and their beliefs about\nthe probability of those outcomes. Proponents of these theories\nsometimes claim for them the additional advantage of empirical\nadequacy, arguing that they are flexible enough to accommodate the\nfull range of behaviors that human agents engage in, both within the\nmarketplace and outside of it.  Especially if one operates with the\nnotion of \u2018revealed preferences\u2019\u2014preferences, that\nis, that are ascribed to agents solely on the basis of actual\nbehavior\u2014then virtually anything an agent might choose to do\ncould be interpreted as an attempt to maximize expected\nutility. Decision theory, on the resulting interpretation of it,\nbecomes an all-encompassing framework for understanding free human\nbehavior, according to which all agents who act freely are striving to\nproduce outcomes that would be optimal, relative to their current\npreferences and beliefs.\n\n\nIf decision theory is interpreted in this way, however, then its\nrelevance to the understanding of practical reason may appear\ncorrespondingly tenuous (compare Pettit and Smith 1997). The\nmaximization of subjective utility is supposed to represent a\nnormative ideal, one by appeal to which we can assess critically the\ndeliberations of agents. In this guise, the attraction of the\nmaximizing model lies in the idea that there can be rational\nrequirements on action, stemming from the totality of an agent\u2019s\npreferences and beliefs, even if we do not assume that there are\nindependent, substantive standards for the critical assessment of\nindividual ends. But this normative interpretation of maximizing\nrationality is tenable only if it is at least conceivable that\nindividual agents might sometimes fail to satisfy its\nrequirements\u2014an\u2018ought\u2019that it is not so much as\npossible to flout is not really an \u2018ought\u2019 at all (Lavin\n2004). Thus the axioms of decision theory include constraints on an\nagent\u2019s overall preferences (such as completeness and transitivity)\nthat might be violated even by agents who are striving to satisfy\ntheir currently strongest desires. Such agents will be criticizable by\nthe lights of decision theory insofar there is no consistent utility\nfunction that can be ascribed to them on the basis of their actual\nchoices and behavior. The normative credentials of decision theory\nrest, then, on the plausibility of the axioms that are taken to define\nan individual utility function\u2014axioms that may not be quite as\ninnocent or uncontroversial as they appear (compare Mandler 2001).\n\n\nFurther questions arise about the plausibility of the normative\nrequirement to maximize expected utility. Doubts have been expressed,\nfor instance, in regard to the assumption that it is necessarily\nirrational to fail to select that action that would be optimal,\nrelative to one\u2019s preferences and beliefs.  Perfectly rational\nagents often appear to be content with states of affairs that are\n\u2018good enough\u2019, from the perspective of their aims and\ndesires, even when they know that alternatives are available that\npromise a higher return; they \u2018satisfice\u2019, rather than\nseeking to maximize the value of the outcomes achievable through their\nactions (Slote 1989). They also treat their past intentions and plans\nas defeasibly fixed constraints on deliberation, rather than\nattempting to maximize subjective utility anew in every situation they\nconfront (Bratman 1987). Finally, they can adopt different attitudes\ntoward risk, attaching greater importance to avoiding bad outcomes\nthan to maximizing expected utility, as classically conceived (Buchak\n2013). Defenders of the maximizing model contend that it is flexible\nenough to accommodate alleged counterexamples of these kinds (Pettit\n1984). If not, however, there may be grounds for doubting that it\nrepresents a basic norm or practical reason.\n\n\nA different issue about maximizing rationality concerns the set of\ndesires or aims that is taken as fixed for purposes of applying the\nrequirement of maximization. We may distinguish two basic\napproaches. The first and perhaps most common of these takes the\nsubjective utility of alternative actions to be determined by the\nagent\u2019s preferences at the time of deliberation. According to this\ninterpretation of the maximization model, we are rational to the\nextent we do that which best promotes the totality of our present\naims. A second and quite different interpretation results if we expand\nthe set of desires that determine the subjective utilities of outcomes\nto include the totality of the agent\u2019s preferences over\ntime. According to this model, rational agents aim to maximize the\nsatisfaction of all of their anticipated desires, accepting\nfrustration of present preferences for the sake of greater\nsatisfaction at later times. This interpretation of the maximizing\nmodel gives expression to the common idea that a certain prudential\nregard for one\u2019s own future well-being is a requirement of practical\nreason (Nagel 1978, chaps 5\u20138). But if we take it to be a\ncomprehensive account of rationality in action, the prudential\ninterpretation can also appear to be an unstable compromise: if\npractical reason demands of us impartiality as between our present and\nfuture desires, should it not equally demand impartial consideration\nof the desires of other agents who may be affected by what we do? Why\nshould we take the distinction between persons to be significant for\nthe theory of practical reason, once we have denied such significance\nto the distinction between different times in the life of a single\nagent (Parfit 1984; compare section 5 below)?\n\n\nHowever we define the class of desires that is subject to the\nrequirement of maximization, we do not need to take those desires\nexactly as they are given. Many proponents of the maximizing approach\nsuggest that an agent\u2019s actual desires should be laundered somewhat\nbefore the demand to maximize is applied. For instance, if my desire\nfor X is contingent on a false factual belief about the nature\nof X, then it is not obvious that practical reason requires\nthat the desire be taken into account in determining what it is\nrational for me to do. A popular form of laundering would rule out\ndesires of this kind, by subjecting to the requirement of maximization\nonly those desires that would survive if the agent were factually\nwell-informed about the objects of desire and the circumstances of\naction, and deliberating in a calm and focused frame of mind. Indeed,\nonce we are in the business of laundering desires we can go still\nfurther, excluding from consideration desires that are substantively\nobjectionable, even if they would survive the filter of corrected\nfactual belief. To move into this territory, however, would clearly be\nto abandon the Humean framework of the original maximizing approach,\nassuming resources for the rational criticism of ends that are\nindependent of the agent\u2019s actual dispositions. \n\n Some philosophers respond to the cases that invite desire-laundering\nby distinguishing between subjective and objective dimensions of\npractical reason. Our corrected desires, such philosophers maintain,\nare relevant to determining what it would be objectively rational for\nus to do, or what we objectively have reason to do. But we are often\nnot in a position to grasp that our factual beliefs are false. When\nthis is the case, we can hardly be faulted for failing to do what we\nobjectively have most reason to do. In situations of this kind, it may\nbe subjectively rational for us to strive to satisfy our actual\ndesires, even if some of those desires would not survive correction of\nour mistaken but blameless factual beliefs. \n",
