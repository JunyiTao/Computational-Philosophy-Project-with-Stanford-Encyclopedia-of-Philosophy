Recognition and Emancipation\n\n\nStruggles for recognition are supposed to effect moral progress toward ever more\njust or fulfilling relations of recognition. Sometimes such struggles are fought by violent\nmeans, which raises challenging questions of when such revolutions might be justifiable (Iser 2017, Bazargan 2018) and who can be targeted. But much more frequently, such struggles proceed in non-violent forms. Just think of the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King in the US or the Indian liberation movement under Mahatma\nGandhi. Therefore, some authors,\nespecially those interested in social criticism, have proposed to use\nrecognition as a new paradigm for Critical Theory (Honneth 1992, see\nalso Iser 2008, Deranty 2009, Zurn 2015). Such a \u201ccritical theory of\nrecognition\u201d is supposed to evaluate whether societies provide\ntheir citizens with the necessary \u201cprimary good\u201d of social\nrecognition.\n\n\nBecause some theories of recognition are not only concerned with\nquestions of justice but also with a formal theory of the good life\ndesigned to illuminate the social conditions of individual flourishing\n(or negatively, of social pathologies) this has sparked the critique\nthat such approaches are too \u201csectarian\u201d (Fraser 2003a, 30;\nsimilar Zurn 2000, 121): Any reference to the telos of a good\nlife (or the specific idea of individuality or authenticity) proves to\nbe a non-starter (or just eurocentric). In reply, proponents of such a\nbroader account of social philosophy have insisted that the emphasis on\na society that recognizes as many features of individuals as possible,\nhereby promoting their autonomy, does not prescribe how to live. It\nonly spells out the intersubjective conditions which provide everybody\nwith the chance to live the life they want to lead (be it autonomously\nchosen or not), namely in a social environment where this life is\neither adequately recognized or at least not looked upon derogatively\n(Honneth 2003a, 177).\n\n\nSome authors have emphasized that speaking of recognition as a vital\nhuman need cannot mean that every struggle for recognition is (equally)\njustified (Alexander/Pia Lara 1996). We still require criteria to\ndistinguish between legitimate and illegitimate struggles. Certainly,\nthose who fight for more recognition think that they deserve it. But\nobviously their belief can be false if the claims are unjustified or\nexaggerated. As all instances of legitimate criticism remind us:\nNeither every negative description of a person(\u2019s self-image) nor\nevery challenge of her current status position\u2014as hurtful as\nsuch \u201cchallenges\u201d might be for the affected person\u2014is necessarily a form of misrecognition. Quite to the contrary, only by\nbeing subject to well-meaning criticism can we improve ourselves.\n\n\nTherefore, those who defend a primarily normative account of\nrecognition (and humiliation) distance themselves from what they\nperceive as the problems of overly psychological approaches. On the one\nhand, they claim, due to adapted preferences persons might not even\n(emotionally) register when they are in fact treated disrespectfully.\nOn the other hand, persons might feel slighted because they hold\nutterly unreasonable views in the first place, e.g., if Nazis think\nthat they ought to be treated as super-humans or if a mediocre painter\nexpects others to view him as a genius (Margalit 1996, 9; Fraser 2003a,\n37\u201342; Iser 2008, 216\u2013221).\n\n\nBut how do we come by the normative criteria of adequate\nrecognition? Whereas Kantian contractualists ask themselves which\nstandards are acceptable to all (in a hypothetical choice situation),\nmost theorists of recognition follow a more Hegelian route. They argue\nthat the social practices of recognition in which subjects live already\nprovide them with all the normative resources needed to criticize and\ntranscend these practices. Thus, Hegelian theories of recognition in\nall their variations choose an interpretative or\u2014perhaps more\nadequately\u2014reconstructive path: Because we are socialized into\na specific recognition order we also internalize (via the exchange with\nand through the \u201cview\u201d of others) a given space of\n(historical) reasons that shapes our practical identity and our\nnormative expectations springing from this identity. This is also\nsupposed to explain the close connection between the normative and the\npsychological dimension of recognition: On account of our\nintersubjectively acquired identity we have a psychological need to be\nrecognized as having the normative status we deem to deserve.\nConsequently, because it is a normatively structured need to the\ndisappointment of which we usually react with indignation, its\nappropriateness can always be questioned by reference to the reasons\navailable to us (Iser 2008, 173).\n\n\nOne way to make progress then is to criticize problematic ways of\nthinking of and relating to others\u2019 characteristics by pointing\nto already established principles of recognition. This would, for\nexample, entail arguing for women\u2019s rights on the basis of the\nidea of equal dignity of all \u201cmen\u201d or for higher wages for\nworkers by reference to already established notions of desert. Thus,\nit is always possible to bring to bear aspects which were disregarded\nup to now by referring to the \u201csurplus validity\u201d of an\nalready established abstract principle of recognition (Honneth 2003a,\n186).  According to this view, moral progress takes place by way of a\nlaborious sorting out of reasons that are shown to be implausible.\nHowever, this still leaves open the question of how radical such a\ncritique can be, i.e., whether it can only proceed in a\ncontext-dependent and piecemeal way or whether the very logic of\nrecognition provides us with more abstract criteria of progress, such\nas egalitarian inclusion and the recognition of ever more aspects of\nindividuals that fosters their autonomy (Honneth 2003a,\n184\u2013185).\n\n\nSometimes such critical reflections on one\u2019s society are\ntriggered by emotional impulses. Thus, the psychoanalytic tradition\nrefers to suppressed, but unconsciously still effective drives or\nexperiences. These approaches always search, albeit in a speculative\nmanner, for a motive people may have to transcend the given recognition\norder. These drives or experiences may be described, following Freud,\nas libidinous energies or rather as the positively connotated\nrecollection of a state of infant omnipotence (Whitebook 1996). In\nrecent times, object relations theory has been used to highlight the\ntraumatically experienced end of an original symbiosis (between a baby\nand her primary care-giver) which we supposedly strive to regain\nthroughout our entire life (Benjamin 1988).\n\n\nBut regardless of the way subjects reach the conviction that they\nmust claim recognition for new, so far neglected or\u2014even worse\u2014demeaned aspects of their identity, the following question must\nbe asked: From where do they gain the mental strength to at least\ntemporarily withstand the disrespect or indifference of (at least many\nof) their surrounding others? The assumption that without recognition\nby all others it is inevitable that we suffer psychological breakdown\nis much too strong. In spite of disrespect, the capacity for\nagency which is necessary for resistance may spring from three\nmotivational sources. First, the oppressed subjects can, under certain\ncircumstances, still draw upon the assurance that they acquired in a\n(more or less) happy childhood. Secondly, social movements of\nresistance often create enough motivational energy by recognizing each\nother within these movements, e.g., within the civil rights movement.\nAs a consequence, the disrespect shown by the rest of society at least\nweighs less heavily. Finally, the idea that members of a better society\nin the future, though merely imagined, would one day grant the desired\nrecognition, might function as a third source of the mental strength\nneeded to endure (Mead 1934, 199).\n",
