    "main_text": "Accounts of Concrete Computation || The Syntactic Account\n2.4 The Syntactic Account\n\nAs we saw, the semantic account needs to specify which representations\nare relevant to computation. One view is that the relevant\nrepresentations are language-like, that is, they have the kind of\nsyntactic structure exhibited by sentences in a language. Computation,\nthen, is the manipulation of language-like representations in a way\nthat is sensitive to their syntactic structure and preserves their\nsemantic properties (Fodor 1975).\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, however, using the notion of\nrepresentation in an account of computation involves some\ndifficulties. If computation could be accounted for without appealing\nto representation, those difficulties would be avoided. One way to do\nso is to maintain that computation simply is the manipulation of\nlanguage-like structures via the manipulation of their syntactic\nproperties, leaving semantics by the wayside. The structures being\nmanipulated are assumed to be language-like only in that they have\nsyntactic properties\u2014they need not have any semantics. In this\nsyntactic account of computation, the notion of representation is not\nused at all.\n\nThe semantic account attempts to solve the problem of implementation\nby imposing a semantic restriction on acceptable mappings between\nphysical and computational states; only physical states that count as\n(the right sort of) representations may be mapped onto computational\nstates. In contrast, the syntactic account may be seen as replacing\nthis semantic restriction: only physical states that qualify as\nsyntactic may be mapped onto computational states, thereby qualifying\nas computational states. If a state lacks syntactic structure, it is\nnot computational.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is what counts as a syntactic state. An\nimportant account of syntax in the physical world is due to Stephen\nStich (1983, 150\u2013157). Although Stich does not use the term\n\u201ccomputation,\u201d his account of syntax is aimed at grounding\na syntactic account of mental states and processes. Stich\u2019s syntactic\ntheory of mind is, in turn, his interpretation of the computational\ntheories proposed by cognitive scientists\u2014in competition with\nFodor\u2019s semantic interpretation. Since Stich\u2019s account of syntax is\nultimately aimed at grounding computational theories of cognition,\nStich\u2019s account of syntax also provides an (implicit) syntactic\naccount of computation.\n\nAccording to Stich, roughly speaking, a physical system contains\nsyntactically structured objects when two conditions are satisfied.\nFirst, there is a mapping between the behaviorally relevant physical\nstates of the system and a class of syntactic types, which are\nspecified by a grammar that defines how complex syntactic types can be\nformed out of (finitely many) primitive syntactic types. Second, the\nbehavior of the system is explained by a theory whose generalizations\nare formulated in terms of formal relations between the syntactic\ntypes that map onto the physical states of the system.\n\nThe syntactic account of computation is not very popular. A common\nobjection is that it seems difficult to give an account of primitive\nsyntactic types that does not presuppose a prior semantic\nindividuation of the types (Crane 1990, Jacquette 1991, Bontly 1998).\nIn fact, it is common to make sense of syntax by construing it as a\nway to combine symbols, that is, semantically interpreted\nconstituents. If syntax is construed in this way, it presupposes\nsemantics. If so, the syntactic account of computation collapses into\nthe semantic account.\n\nAnother objection is that language-like syntactic structure is not\nnecessary for computation as it is understood in computer science and\ncomputability theory. Although computing systems surely can manipulate\nlanguage-like structures, they don\u2019t have to. They can also manipulate\nsimple sequences of letters, without losing their identity as\ncomputers. (Computability theorists call any set of words from a\nfinite alphabet a language, but that broad notion of language should\nnot be confused with the narrower notion\u2014inspired by grammars in\nlogic and linguistics\u2014that Stich employs in his syntactic\naccount of computation.)\n",
