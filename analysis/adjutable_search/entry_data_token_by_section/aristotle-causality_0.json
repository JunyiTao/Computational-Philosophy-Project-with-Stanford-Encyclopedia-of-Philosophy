    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAristotle was not the first thinker to engage in a causal\ninvestigation of the world around us. Quite the opposite: from the\nvery beginning, and independently of Aristotle, the investigation of\nthe natural world consisted in the search for the relevant causes of a\nvariety of natural phenomena. From the Phaedo, for example,\nwe learn that the so-called \u201cinquiry into nature\u201d\nconsisted in a search for \u201cthe causes of each thing; why each\nthing comes into existence, why it goes out of existence, why it\nexists\u201d (96 a 6\u201310). In this tradition of investigation,\nthe search for causes was a search for answers to the question\n\u201cwhy?\u201d.\n\nBoth in the Physics and in the Metaphysics Aristotle\nplaces himself in direct continuity with this tradition. At the\nbeginning of the Metaphysics, Aristotle offers a concise\nreview of the results reached by his predecessors (Metaph. I\n3\u20137). From this review we learn that all his predecessors were\nengaged in an investigation that eventuated in knowledge of one or\nmore of the following causes: material, formal, efficient, and final\ncause.\n\nHowever, Aristotle makes it very clear that all his predecessors (no\none excluded) merely touched upon these causes (Metaph. I 7,\n988 a 22\u201323). He equates them to boxers who lack boxing\ntechnique: while sometimes they can throw a nice punch, any punch that lands is only a lucky one (Metaph. I 4, 985 a 10\u201319). In other\nwords, even when his predecessors had valuable insights into\ncausality, they spoke without having proper knowledge. His view is\nthat they spoke about causes without making the relevant distinctions\nand without conveying clarity (they spoke amudr\u00f4s kai outhen\nsaph\u00f4s, Metaph I 4, 985 a 13).\n\nBy Aristotle\u2019s lights, all his predecessors engaged in their\ncausal investigation without a firm grasp of causality. They lacked a\ncomplete understanding of the range of possible causes and their\nsystematic interrelations. Put differently, their use of\ncausality was not supported by an adequate theory of\ncausality. According to Aristotle, this explains why their\ninvestigation, even when it resulted in important insights, was never\nentirely successful.\n\nThis insistence on the doctrine of the four causes as an indispensable\ntool for a successful investigation of the world around us explains\nwhy Aristotle provides his reader with a general account of the four\ncauses. This account is found, in almost the same words, in\nPhysics II 3 and Metaphysics V 2.\n",
