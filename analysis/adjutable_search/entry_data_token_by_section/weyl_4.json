Given the idealism that always animated Weyl\u2019s thought, \nthis is not surprising, since Brouwer assigned the thinking subject a\ncentral position in the creation of the mathematical \n world[18].\n \n\n\nIn his early thinking Brouwer had held that that the continuum is \npresented to intuition as a whole, and that it is impossible to \nconstruct all its points as individuals. But later he radically \ntransformed the concept of \u201cpoint\u201d, endowing points with \nsufficient fluidity to enable them to serve as generators of a \n\u201ctrue\u201d continuum. This fluidity was achieved by admitting\nas \u201cpoints\u201d, not only fully defined discrete numbers such\nas 1/9, \\(e\\), and the like\u2014which have, so to speak, \nalready achieved \u201cbeing\u201d\u2014but also \n\u201cnumbers\u201d which are in a perpetual state of \n\u201cbecoming\u201d in that the entries in their decimal (or \ndyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice by a subject\noperating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The resulting \nchoice sequences cannot be conceived as finished, completed objects: \nat any moment only an initial segment is known. Thus Brouwer obtained\nthe mathematical continuum in a manner compatible with his belief in \nthe primordial intuition of time\u2014that is, as an unfinished, in \nfact unfinishable entity in a perpetual state of growth, a \n\u201cmedium of free development\u201d. In Brouwer\u2019s vision, the \nmathematical continuum is indeed \u201cconstructed\u201d, not, \nhowever, by initially shattering, as did Cantor and Dedekind, an \nintuitive continuum into isolated points, but rather by assembling it\nfrom a complex of continually changing overlapping parts.\n\n\nBrouwer\u2019s impact looms large in Weyl\u2019s 1921 paper, On the New \nFoundational Crisis of Mathematics. Here Weyl identifies two distinct\nviews of the continuum: \u201catomistic\u201d or \n\u201cdiscrete\u201d; and \u201ccontinuous\u201d. In the first of\nthese the continuum is composed of individual real numbers which are \nwell-defined and can be sharply distinguished. Weyl describes his \nearlier attempt at reconstructing analysis in Das Kontinuum as \natomistic in this sense:\n\nExistential questions concerning real numbers only become\nmeaningful if we analyze the concept of real number in this\nextensionally determining and delimiting manner. Through this\nconceptual restriction, an ensemble of individual points is, so to\nspeak, picked out from the fluid paste of the continuum. The continuum\nis broken up into isolated elements, and the flowing-into-each other of\nits parts is replaced by certain conceptual relations between these\nelements, based on the \u201clarger-smaller\u201d relationship. This\nis why I speak of the atomistic conception of the\ncontinuum. (Weyl 1921, 91)\n\n\nBy this time Weyl had repudiated atomistic theories of the continuum,\nincluding that of Das \n Kontinuum.[19]\n While intuitive considerations, together with Brouwer\u2019s influence, \nmust certainly have fuelled Weyl\u2019s rejection of such theories, it \nalso had a logical basis. For Weyl had come to regard as meaningless \nthe formal procedure\u2014employed in Das Kontinuum\u2014of \nnegating universal and existential statements concerning real numbers\nconceived as developing sequences or as sets of rationals. This had \nthe effect of undermining the whole basis on which his theory had \nbeen erected, and at the same time rendered impossible the very \nformulation of a \u201claw of excluded middle\u201d for such \nstatements. Thus Weyl found himself espousing a \n position[20]\n considerably more radical than that of Brouwer, for whom negations of\nquantified statements had a perfectly clear constructive meaning, \nunder which the law of excluded middle is simply not generally \naffirmable.\n\n\nOf existential statements Weyl says:\nAn existential statement\u2014e.g., \u201cthere is an\neven number\u201d\u2014is not a judgement in the proper sense at\nall, which asserts a state of affairs; existential states of affairs\nare the empty invention of logicians. (Weyl [1921], 97)\n\n\nWeyl termed such pseudostatements \u201cjudgment abstracts\u201d, \nlikening them, with typical literary flair, to \u201ca piece of \npaper which announces the presence of a treasure, without divulging \nits location.\u201d Universal statements, although possessing \ngreater substance than existential ones, are still mere intimations \nof judgments, \u201cjudgment instructions\u201d, for which Weyl \nprovides the following metaphorical description:\nIf knowledge be compared to a fruit and the realization of\nthat knowledge to the consumption of the fruit, then a universal\nstatement is to be compared to a hard shell filled with fruit. It is,\nobviously, of some value, however, not as a shell by itself, but only\nfor its content of fruit. It is of no use to me as long as I do not\nopen it and actually take out a fruit and eat it. (Ibid.,\n98)\n\n\nAbove and beyond the claims of logic, Weyl welcomed Brouwer\u2019s \nconstruction of the continuum by means of sequences generated by free\nacts of choice, thus identifying it as a \u201cmedium of free \nBecoming\u201d which \u201cdoes not dissolve into a set of real \nnumbers as finished entities\u201d. Weyl felt that Brouwer, through \nhis doctrine of \n Intuitionism[21],\n had come closer than anyone else to bridging that \u201cunbridgeable\nchasm\u201d between the intuitive and mathematical continua. In \nparticular, he found compelling the fact that the Brouwerian \ncontinuum is not the union of two disjoint nonempty parts\u2014that \nit is, in a word, indecomposable. \u201cA genuine continuum,\u201d \nWeyl says, \u201ccannot be divided into separate \n fragments.\u201d[22]\n In later publications he expresses this more colourfully by quoting \nAnaxagoras to the effect that a continuum \u201cdefies the chopping \noff of its parts with a hatchet.\u201d\n\n\nWeyl also agreed with Brouwer that all functions everywhere defined \non a continuum are continuous, but here certain subtle differences of\nviewpoint emerge. Weyl contends that what mathematicians had taken to\nbe discontinuous functions actually consist of several continuous \nfunctions defined on separated continua. In Weyl\u2019s view, for example, \nthe \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d function defined by \n\\(f(x) = 0\\) for \\(x \\lt 0\\) and \n\\(f(x) = 1\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\) in fact consists of \nthe two functions with constant values and 1 respectively \ndefined on the separated continua \\(\\{x: x \\lt 0\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{x: x \\ge 0\\}\\). (The union of these two continua \nfails to be the whole of the real continuum because of the failure of\nthe law of excluded middle: it is not the case that, for be any real \nnumber \\(x\\), either \\(x \\lt 0\\) or \\(x \\ge 0\\).) \nBrouwer, on the other hand, had not dismissed the possibility that \ndiscontinuous functions could be defined on proper parts of a \ncontinuum, and still seems to have been searching for an appropriate \nway of formulating this \n idea.[23]\n In particular, at that time Brouwer would probably have been inclined\nto regard the above function \\(f\\) as a genuinely discontinuous \nfunction defined on a proper part of the real continuum. For Weyl, it\nseems to have been a self-evident fact that all functions defined on \na continuum are continuous, but this is because Weyl confines \nattention to functions which turn out to be continuous by definition.\nBrouwer\u2019s concept of function is less restrictive than Weyl\u2019s and it \nis by no means immediately evident that such functions must always be\ncontinuous. \n\n\nWeyl defined real functions as mappings correlating each interval in \nthe choice sequence determining the argument with an interval in the \nchoice sequence determining the value \u201cinterval by \ninterval\u201d as it were, the idea being that approximations to the\ninput of the function should lead effectively to corresponding \napproximations to the input. Such functions are continuous by \ndefinition. Brouwer, in contrast, considers real functions as \ncorrelating choice sequences with choice sequences, and the \ncontinuity of these is by no means obvious. The fact that Weyl \nrefused to grant (free) choice sequences\u2014whose identity is in \nno way predetermined\u2014sufficient individuality to admit them as \narguments of functions betokens a commitment to the conception of the\ncontinuum as a \u201cmedium of free Becoming\u201d even deeper, \nperhaps, than that of Brouwer.\n\n\nThere thus being only minor differences between Weyl\u2019s and Brouwer\u2019s \naccounts of the continuum, Weyl accordingly abandoned his earlier \nattempt at the reconstruction of analysis, and joined Brouwer. He \nexplains:\n\nI tried to find solid ground in the impending state of dissolution of\nthe State of analysis (which is in preparation, although still only\nrecognized by few)without forsaking the order on which it is founded,\nby carrying out its fundamental principle purely and honestly. And I\nbelieve I was successful\u2014as far as this is possible. For\nthis order is itself untenable, as I have now convinced\nmyself, and Brouwer\u2014that is the revolution!\u2026 It would\nhave been wonderful had the old dispute led to the conclusion that the\natomistic conception as well as the continuous one can be carried\nthrough. Instead the latter triumphs for good over the former. It is\nBrouwer to whom we owe the new solution of the continuum\nproblem. History has destroyed again from within the provisional\nsolution of Galilei and the founders of the differential and the\nintegral calculus. (Weyl 1921, 98\u201399)\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s initial enthusiasm for intuitionism seems later to have waned.\nThis may have been due to a growing belief on his part that the \nmathematical sacrifices demanded by adherence to intuitionistic \ndoctrine (e.g., the abandonment of the least upper bound principle, \nand other important results of classical analysis) would prove to be \nintolerable to practicing mathematicians. Witness this passage from \nPhilosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science:\n\n\nMathematics with Brouwer gains its highest intuitive clarity. He\nsucceeds in developing the beginnings of analysis in a natural manner,\nall the time preserving the contact with intuition much more closely\nthan had been done before. It cannot be denied, however, that in\nadvancing to higher and more general theories the inapplicability of\nthe simple laws of classical logic eventually results in an almost\nunbearable awkwardness. And the mathematician watches with pain the\ngreater part of his towering edifice which he believed to be built of\nconcrete blocks dissolve into mist before his eyes. (Weyl [1949],\n54)\n\n\nNevertheless, it is likely that Weyl remained convinced to the end of\nhis days that intuitionism, despite its technical \n\u201cawkwardness\u201d, came closest, of all mathematical \napproaches, to capturing the essence of the continuum.\n",
