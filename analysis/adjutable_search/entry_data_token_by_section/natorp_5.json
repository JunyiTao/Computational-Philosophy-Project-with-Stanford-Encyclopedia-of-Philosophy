History of Philosophy\n\nWe finally turn to the Marburg thesis that philosophy, as philosophy\nof science, must also be the philosophical history of science. For\nscience, as a fieri (a doing) evolves over time;\nhence the activity of its basic functions and the regulated mutation\nof its laws can only be observed through time. Yet this historical\ntracing of the progress of science must be philosophically informed,\nthat is, grounded in the transcendentally isolated system of basic\nfunctions. As mentioned above, Natorp holds that the entire value of\nthe transcendental method is normative: having laid bare the\ncategorial functions in their purity, science can be judged as to its\nrigor, i.e., its submission to rational legislation. The Marburgers,\nwith this criterion in hand, enthusiastically apply it in praise and\nblame.\n\nA historiographical commonplace of neo-Kantianism has it that the\nlabor of grounding the sciences was divided between the Marburg and\nSouthwest Schools, the former attending to the natural sciences, the\nlatter to the human sciences or Geisteswissenschaften (cf.\nOesterreich 1923: 417). Recent scholarship has complicated this\npicture, reminding us of Rickert\u2019s contributions to philosophy\nof natural science (cf., e.g., Rickert 1902; 1899), and noting that\nthe Marburg School, too, has a theory of history (esp. Edel 1994; Laks\n1994; Lembeck 1994). Already Cohen argues that the disciplinary\ndivision between systematic philosophy and the history of philosophy\nis artificial and harmful; he insists that \u201cthe study of\nphilosophy requires the connection of the systematic and historical\ninterest\u201d (Cohen 1902: 440).\n\nStill, the common view, if one-sided, is not wrong, for the Marburg\ntheory of history has a very different starting-point than does the\nSouthwest School. Unlike Rickert and Windelband, Cohen and Natorp do\nnot begin their theory of history from the \u201cfact\u201d of\nhistorical science, in the way they begin their theory of natural\nscience from the \u201cfact\u201d of mathematical physics. When they\nspeak of history, they mean, on the one hand, the history of\nscience, and on the other, the history of philosophy,\nproperly construed, namely as the critique of science. Only\nsecondarily are they interested in political, economic, or social\nhistory, and only insofar as it advances their primary\n project.[33]\n\n\nThe Marburg conception of genuine philosophy as in the first\nplace a transcendental logic of natural science (cf. Cohen 1902:\n445) therefore restricts history to a history of \u201cscientific\n idealism\u201d.[34]\n In rejecting the view that scientific progress is better understood\nexclusively from a \u201csystematic\u201d perspective,\n\u201cdetache[d] \u2026 from its historical bonds\u201d, (Cohen\n1902: 439) Cohen remarks that the \u201cvery value and security of\nscience is rooted in its own history, connected, as it were, with the\ngeneral history of mind [Geist]\u201d (Cohen 1916: 310).\nThis sounds odd since we have heard again and again that science is\nrooted in its method, but now are told it is rooted in its\nhistory. Perhaps the paradox is only seeming, for there is an intimate\nconnection between the Marburg School\u2019s notion of hypothesis as\nthe active posit of mind, on the one hand, and its notion of science\nas essentially historical, on the other. Their conception of the logic\nof science as the dynamic Gang of categorial hypotheses\nimplies that science can only be grasped developmentally, i.e.,\nhistorically.\n\nThe Marburg view of that history differs in two important respects\nfrom Hegel\u2019s, with which it might otherwise seem to have much in\ncommon: first, it is not based upon a sequence of conceptual\ncontradiction and resolution; second, the history of science\u2019s\ndevelopment is relativistic, that is, in principle incapable of\nachieving an \u201cabsolute\u201d resolution (Natorp 1912c: 211,\nff.). Let me focus on the first of these differences. For Hegel,\nhistory is the linear evolution of Geist\u2019s\nself-knowledge through time; the further to the right you go, the more\nadvanced the stage of (self-)consciousness. These stages\u2014the\n\u201cphenomena\u201d\u2014of Geist are inseparable from,\nindeed just are their cultural manifestations. Cohen and Natorp, too,\ntake genuine history to be the history of rational self-consciousness,\nbut for them this simply means reason\u2019s transcendental,\nreflective consciousness of the basis of science, that is, method.\nThis principle of lawfulness is in itself unchanging, eternal,\natemporal; it is not expressed \u201cin\u201d phenomena, but instead\nmakes possible and generates phenomena as such; and indeed (as we saw\nabove) generates time itself as a condition of the possibilty of\nphenomena. Because its object\u2014this rational insight into\nreason\u2019s own principle\u2014is essentially detached from time,\nhistory for the Marburg School is not conceived with respect to time.\nOf course science develops in time, and may be tracked diachronically\nalong a time-line, yet its innermost core is the self-same atemporal\nidea, around which science circles, its progression\nrepresented by ever wider, but concentric\n orbits.[35]\n Thus the history of science is itself ideal, in the sense of\nfocusing solely upon those moments of reflective illumination when\nscience becomes self-conscious\u2014through philosophy\u2014of its\nrational foundation or transcendental nucleus. Cohen writes: \u201cIn\nthe history of every science the history of scientific reason in\ngeneral always fulfills itself concentrically\u201d (Cohen 1916:\n310). He considers the fact that each of these moments of\nself-consciousness must occur in concrete circumstances and have a\nunique point on a real time-line to be as obvious as it is\n irrelevant.[36]\n\n\nThe transcendental nucleus is method, and method is the meaning of\nidealism; hence, idealism is born when reason becomes self-conscious\nof its thinking as methodical and\n scientific.[37]\n Since this birth has a historical locus, Cohen argues,\n\u201cidealism\u2019s historical origin \u2026 conditions idealism\nthrough its connection with the methodological foundation of science\nno less than its material origin in methodology\u201d (Cohen 1916:\n 309).[38]\n Put another way, idealism connects with its methodological foundation\nby connecting with its historical origin (cf. Cohen 1902:\n450). It follows that idealism has two related historical tasks: the\nprimary task is to open and maintain a direct avenue to its origin.\nThis involves the secondary task of retracing previous scientific\nconnections to that same primal idealism, which alone can serve as the\ncriterion of the \u201crelatedness [Verwandtheit] of\ndifferent phases of science\u201d (cf. Cohen 1916: 310). The history\nof idealism is therefore not of its evolution (as is the history of\nscience) but of its rebirths.\n\nThe history of science is a history of often contradictory or\nincommensurable theories, each of which is represented in\nCohen\u2019s image as a ring. Nonetheless, as scientific, the variety\nof theories all express the same central, unitary activity of reason:\npositing hypotheses. Because of this constant unity of scientific\nreason, a \u201ccontinuous connection of reason and the fundamental\nforces [Grundkr\u00e4fte] of its history is required\u201d\n(Cohen 1916: 310). By \u201cfundamental forces\u201d Cohen just\nmeans Greek\n antiquity,[39]\n specifically Plato:\n\nPlato is the founder of the system of philosophy \u2026 because he\nfounded logic [in the Marburg sense], and thereby the system of\nphilosophy. He is generally to be understood as the founder of\nidealism. But the word, \u201cidealism\u201d, in the whole history\nof culture, in which it has against the odds remained the guiding\nwatchword, has only emerged at certain illuminating turning-points\nfrom an unclear and imprecise meaning. (Cohen 1902: 446)\n\n\nHistory\u2019s \u201cilluminating turning-points\u201d, where\nidealism\u2019s meaning manifests itself clearly and distinctly, are\nthe moments when the generative principle of scientific knowledge\nshines forth\u2014i.e., when a critical, reflective perspective upon\nmethod is achieved\u2014drawing the mind from its hyperbolic forays\nback into the regular orbit of reason, when we realize that we cannot\nsimply be guided by the things as they appear to us. They are moments\nof reason\u2019s recollection, rebirth, and self-renewal (Cohen 1916:\n309).\n\nHence the Marburgers consider it of the utmost significance that their\nheroes\u2014especially Galileo, Leibniz, and Kant\u2014explicitly\nlink their conceptions of science back to Plato. As Cohen and Natorp\nselect and interpret their idealistic predecessors, they see\nillustrated in them the crucial immanent role of historical\nreflection in science, by which it ascends to transcendental\nself-reflection upon its methodological foundation (cf. Cohen 1902:\n450). As Cohen puts it, \u201chistory is \u2026 a sign\n[Wahrzeichen] of the inner life and growth of all problems of\nscientific reason as they emerge out of the root of their\nmethodology\u201d (Cohen 1916: 310); and that root is, historically,\nPlato: \u201cIdealism is the Idealism of the Platonic Idea\u201d\n(Cohen 1916:\n 305).[40]\n For Cohen and Natorp, \u201cPlato\u201d signifies the organizing\nprinciple of science as a historically unfolding, living enterprise.\nTo stop reading Plato is to subtract science from its rational core,\nand deprive it\u2014not of its method, which it will always have\nqua science\u2014but of self-transparency of its own\npure foundation and legitimacy.\n\nAlthough history, according to Cohen, \u201cdiscloses the origin of\nidealism from the start\u201d, we must rely no less upon our methodic\nunderstanding of idealism in order \u201cto recognize this idealism\ncorrectly wherever it appears\u201d (Cohen 1916: 305). This statement\nconfirms the hermeneutic inseparability of system and history: each\nsupports the other. By \u201csystematically\u201d determining\nidealism as the method of science, we enable idealism to recognize\nitself in its historical manifestations; these manifestations, in\nturn, furnish the \u201cfact\u201d of science to be systematically\ndetermined. This reciprocity of history and theory informs the\nfollowing passage, in which Cohen links Plato with the Marburg\nprogram.\n\nThe concept of idealism must be determined logically. This\ndetermination is the profoundest task and the highest content of\nlogic. Plato found this determination by establishing logic\u2019s\nconnection to science, and thus grounding logic. The determination\nlies in the concept of the Idea [i.e., Platonic form], the\nmisunderstanding of which led necessarily to the indeterminacy of the\nnotion of idealism itself. What does \u201cIdea\u201d\nsignify? (Cohen 1902: 447)\n\n\nIn other words, to succeed in the methodic or \u201clogical\u201d\ndetermination of idealism, we can do no better than ask the historical\nquestion of how Plato \u201chits upon this determination\u201d.\n\nThis is precisely the task Natorp sets himself in Platos\nIdeenlehre [Plato\u2019s Doctrine of Ideas]. True to\nthe Marburg view that idealism can only be understood by retracing its\ndevelopment, Natorp simultaneously reconstructs the idealistic meaning\nof the dialogues and the \u201clogical\u201d order in which they\nmust have been\n composed.[41]\n He takes a double-pronged approach by arguing, on the one hand, that\nthe Platonic ideai (forms or ideas) are in fact correctly\nunderstood to have a \u201ccritical\u201d sense; and, on the other\nhand, by explaining why this critical intent of Plato (and by\nextension of all other critical idealists) was misconstrued not only\nby Aristotle and virtually the whole tradition, but even, at times, by\nPlato himself. That mistaken reading consists in taking the ideas to\nbe substances, i.e., really existent things, which however have a\npurely noetic, or rather, noumenal character; whose appearances (the\n\u201cparticulars\u201d) may be sensible, but which in themselves\nexist \u201cseparately\u201d, open only to a quasi-mystical vision.\nKant himself of course understood Plato in just this way, chastising\nhim for flying beyond the limits of reason on the wings of\nintellectual intuition. \n\nNatorp by contrast argues\u2014over the course of 500\npages\u2014that while Plato may for various reasons talk in a way\nthat encourages such a reading, his most mature, sober, and\nself-critical dialogues support a categorial interpretation\nof the forms as \u201chypotheses\u201d in the special sense\ndiscussed in\n Section 3.\n Thus, the problems of how the ideas could exist apart from the world\nof real particulars, and whether pure reason has a special intuitive\nfaculty capable of bridging the gulf, evaporate, once we recognize the\nimmanent operation of the ideai as the categorial\n hypotheses[42]\n that are the conditions of possibility of thinking in general, and of\nscience in particular. Thus Natorp interprets the supreme form, the\nform of the Good, as the \u201claw of lawfulness\u201d, (see\n Section 3)\n i.e., the unifying source of both theoretical and practical reason,\nwhile the five \u201cgreat kinds\u201d of the Sophist are\nseen as mutually implicative logical Grundbegriffe or\n\u201croot-categories\u201d of all predicative thinking. These\nideai are no more separately existent, according to Natorp,\nthan are Kant\u2019s categories: they are not transcendent so much as\nthey are transcendental. It has been the incapacity of all\n(Aristotelian) realists or \u201cdogmatists\u201d to grasp this\ndistinction that has led to the chronic misunderstandings of Plato and\nall other \u201ccriticists\u201d. \n\nThe Marburg \u201ctheory\u201d of history to which Natorp\nsubscribes, and in light of which he writes Platos\nIdeenlehre, is this: Plato\u2019s moment of insight into the\ntruth of transcendental idealism (\u00e0 la Cohen), is followed by\nmillennia of dark irrelevance, punctuated by shining rings of\nrecollection, epitomized by Galileo, Newton, and Kant. This picture of\nMarburg Philosophiegeschichtsphilosophie (cf. Lembeck 1994:\n1\u20132) will strike many as surreal; still, it only seems right to\nnote the following. Though we must understand the Marburg conception\nof history to grasp their motivation for reading and re-reading Plato,\nwe need not accept that conception in order to appreciate either\nNatorp\u2019s genetic logic of science or his reading of Plato. As\nLembeck puts it in the introduction to his Platon in\nMarburg:\n\nIt is not a matter of proving that Plato\u2019s philosophy is not\ntranscendental idealism; that is so obvious as to be taken for\ngranted. It is however something entirely else to show why Cohen and\nNatorp believe that Plato, at least in principle, laid the groundwork\nfor this idealism. (Lembeck 1994: 5)\n\n\nFortunately for them, we can betray their id\u00e9e fixe of\nPlato as the living heart of transcendental idealism without, as they\nwould think, destroying or dismissing their work. Indeed, one can\nperhaps better appreciate the value of Natorp\u2019s reading of Plato\nif one does not think of it as support for Marburg idealism\nas such, but simply as an ingenious attempt to make sense of the\nrelation of ideal form and empirical particular, an attempt that\nmerely employs the logic of categorial functions as a hypothetical\nspringboard. \n",
