    "main_text": "Psychology || The Science of the Soul\n5.1 The Science of the Soul\n\nIn his question commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De anima I,\nBrito asks about the subject matter of the science of the soul (for\nBrito\u2019s psychology, see De Boer 2012, 2013). With respect to\nthis question, earlier scholars usually take one of two main opposing\npositions: the subject matter of psychology is either simply the soul,\nor it is the body that has a soul, i.e., the animate body. Brito opts\nfor the second position: the subject matter of the science of the soul\nis the animate body, with an emphasis on its being animated. Two\narguments are given to support his position: the science of the soul\nstudies the operations and features specifically related to the\nanimate body\u2019s having a soul (growth, nutrition, sensation, and\nunderstanding). Hence, its subject matter ought to be the possessor of\nthose operations and features\u2014the animate body. Accordingly,\nthis science does not study the soul, that which makes the animate\nbody animate, without any consideration of its relation to the body;\nrather, it studies the entire composite of body and soul, and more\nspecifically, the body that has a soul (QDA-2012-I: 276).\nTherefore, the science of the soul approaches the soul not as an\nentity totally detached from the body it animates, but rather as the\ncause of the set of operations and features that separate living\nbodies from inanimate ones.\n",
