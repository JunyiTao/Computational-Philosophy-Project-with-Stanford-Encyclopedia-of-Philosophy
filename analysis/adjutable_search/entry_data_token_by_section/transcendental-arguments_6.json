Transcendental Arguments in Philosophy of Psychology and Perception\n\nIn addition to ethics, transcendental arguments are also widely use in\nother areas of philosophy. There are certain prominent examples in\nphilosophy of psychology and perception. For the former, one idea is\nthat the possibility of intentional action requires or presupposes the\nsubject\u2019s sensation-based bodily awareness (O\u2019Shaughnessy\n1980, 1989, 1995; Berm\u00fadez 1995). This general idea has been\ncashed out in different ways. One such instance begins with the fact\nthat we do perceive and act upon the world, and proceeds with the\ninference that the possibility of guiding actions via our\nperceptions of the world requires or presupposes spatial awareness of\nour bodily positions. Although here the starting point concerns\nperception in general, it is standard to think of these inferences\nfrom some examples of vision: our visual experiences of worldly\nobjects enable us to act upon those objects only if the subjects are\ncapable of mapping the information that they give about the spatial\nrelations between our bodies and the objects in question. Another\ninstance begins with the fact that we do experiences ourselves as\nperforming bodily-directed intentional actions. This can be motivated\nby considering simple examples such as scratching one\u2019s head. To\ndo this, it is not enough to locate the spot on one\u2019s head where\none wishes to scratch. It is also needed to be able to locate that\nspot relative to the rest of one\u2019s body. That is, the\npossibility of the above experiences requires or presupposes certain\nkind of representational awareness of one\u2019s body. Some might\neven go further to hold that one needs to be aware of that spot as\npart of one\u2019s body. Why is this so? The idea is that one\nnormally scratches the spot with one\u2019s hand, and in moving the\nhand to the location of the spot, it seems necessary to holistically\nrepresent one\u2019s body, otherwise one would not be able to direct\none\u2019s hand to the spot smoothly.\n\nOne distinctive feature of these arguments is that they seem to make\nempirical claims about the world, so the status of such arguments can\nbecome a matter of dispute. It is often thought that transcendental\narguments, or at least the conditionals involved, have to be a\npriori (Berm\u00fadez 1995; Schwenkler 2012), but if they can\nbe tested through cases in real life, specifically clinical cases from\nneuropsychology, it is then become unclear whether such conditionals\nare indeed a priori. Ian Waterman\u2019s case might be the\nmost discussed one in this context. He unfortunately lost all\nfunctions on the large myelinated sensory fibers below the neck, and\nas a result he almost had no sensation below the neck (Cole 1991). At\nthe beginning of such a condition, he could barely move without\nfalling on the ground, but after appropriate training, he became able\nto retrieve some capacities for walking and other actions through the\nhelp of sight. Now why is this relevant? Recall that the first\ntranscendental conditional introduced in this section has it that the\npossibility of guiding actions via our perceptions of the\nworld requires or presupposes spatial awareness of our bodily\npositions. After training, Waterman could guide his actions\nvia his visual experiences of the environment, but this does\nnot seem to require or presuppose the relevant kind of spatial\nawareness of our bodily positions. If so, then the conditional is\nfalsified. As for the second transcendental conditional above, it\nstates that the possibility of experiencing ourselves as performing\nbody-directed intentional actions requires or presupposes certain kind\nof representational awareness of one\u2019s body. Now the partly\nrecovered Waterman could experience himself as performing\nbody-directed intentional actions, but this does not seem to require\nor presuppose the relevant kind of representational awareness of\none\u2019s body, since he is now relying on his sight, not his body\nimage or schema. In this way, cases from neuropsychology might bear on\ntranscendental conditionals.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t this make the relevant conditionals a\nposteriori? After all, they can be falsified by empirical facts\nin the actual world. For those who insist that such conditionals are\na priori, they might argue that since those conditionals are\na priori necessary truths, they are true of all possible\nworlds, including the actual world; no wonder empirical cases in the\nactual world can be relevant. This involves very complicated issues:\ntrue logical and mathematical statements are supposed to be true of\nall possible worlds, including the actual world, but they cannot be\nrefuted by empirical cases in the actual world. This links back to\nconsiderations about modal metaphysics (see \u00a75 above), and about\nphilosophy of language and epistemology too. Note that this issue is\nconnected to another important issue concerning naturalisation\n(Berm\u00fadez 1995): to bring transcendental conditionals to bear\non actual cases is supposed to be a virtue, because it fits the\ncurrent Zeitgeist, but given the empirical bearings, how can\nsuch conditionals be a priori? It is not clear that the\nliterature has engaged with this issue sufficiently. In a way, a\npriori statements bear on the empirical world: e.g., \u2018any\nsister is a sibling\u2019 bears on all sisters; however, this a\npriori statement cannot be refuted by empirical investigations of\nthese individuals in the empirical world.\n\nPhilosophy of perception is another area that is filled with\ntranscendental arguments, even though the users sometimes do not label\nthem as such. For example, consider the view that the possibility of\nintentionality requires or presupposes that perceptual experiences\nhave representational contents (McDowell 2008, against Travis, 2004,\n2018; the \u2018content view\u2019 as it is sometimes called). The\nsub-arguments for such conditionals can be very complicated. It might\nrely on the idea that rational relations must be between contentful\nepisodes, otherwise one might commit the notorious \u2018myth of the\ngiven\u2019 (Sellars 1956). Such pictures can demand an even stronger\nconditional, that the possibility of intentionality requires or\npresupposes that perceptual experiences\u2019 representational\ncontents are all conceptual (McDowell 1996). Relatedly, it is also\nproposed that the possibility of intentionality requires or\npresupposes the \u2018disjunctive conception of perceptual\nevidence\u2019 (McDowell 1982, 1995, 2008). If the force of\ntranscendental arguments is in doubt, then many arguments in\nphilosophy of perception would be problematic. (For more on McDowell,\nsee Cheng 2021b). To be sure, there can always be disagreements about\nwhether these arguments are transcendental at all. To settle this, one\nneeds to check whether these arguments fit the six characteristics\nlisted in section 2. However, one difficulty is that it is unclear\nwhether we should take them as individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient. Another difficulty is that other practitioners would\npresumably disagree with some of the characteristics listed above.\nHere we regard the above examples as transcendental arguments\nprimarily because they fit the schema offered at the beginning of this\nentry, but the relations between these arguments and the\ncharacteristics listed in section 2 are of course complicated and\ncontroversial.\n\nIn addition to the above examples, there are some notable recent\ndevelopments in this area. One prominent theory in this area is\nna\u00efve realism, the view that the phenomenal characters of\nperceptual experiences are partially constituted by their objects\n(Campbell 2002; Martin 2006). As such, it is not obviously\ntranscendental in any sense. However, there is a recent twist that\nbuilds the transcendental element into the theory: according to this\nnew version, na\u00efve realism is an integral part of the\ntranscendental project of explaining how it is possible that\nperceptual experiences have the distinctive characters that they do.\nThat is, na\u00efve realism is not only the best explanation of the\nrelevant phenomenal characters; it is the only viable\nexplanation for why certain perceptual experiences have the kind of\nphenomenal characters they do (Allen 2017, 2020). Another recent\nexample concerns the relation between perceptual experiences and\nimaginative reflection on the phenomenal characters of such\nexperiences (Gomes 2017): more specifically, imaginative\nreflection \u2018draws on the knowledge we possess of the\nphenomenal character of our perceptual experience and exploits various\nof our imaginative and reflective capacities to provide us with\nsupport for modal claims about whether certain non-actual types of\nperceptual experience could support various forms of thought\u2019\n(p. 140). In this context, it is crucial to emphasise that\ntranscendental arguments can at best reveal properties that perceptual\nexperiences must have, or must lack, given the modal\nforce of such arguments. For example, one might think that visual\nexperiences must have a field-like structure, as visual objects need\nto be placed within an overarching space. This specific claim, to be\nsure, has proven to be highly contested (Campbell 2007; Schwenkler\n2012; French 2018; Cheng 2019).\n",
