    "main_text": "\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita || Life and works\n8.1 Life and works\n\nWhile it is difficult to find much reliable information about the\nlives of most Indian philosophers, quite a bit is known about the\nlife, especially the later life, of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\ndetails of whose life were recorded by Tibetans when he went to Tibet\nin about 763 and became the first abbot of Bsam-yas monastery. He was\nreportedly born into the royal family of what is now Bengal and spent\nhis adult life in various Buddhist monastic universities. It is clear\nfrom his writings that he had studied all branches of Indian\nphilosophy extensively. He seems to have been a direct disciple of\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, and his own disciple, Kamala\u015b\u012bla,\nwas also an influential thinker. Together \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nand Kamala\u015b\u012bla, both of whom spent many years in Tibet, set\nthe tone for Buddhist scholasticism in the eighth century, and their\ninfluence is felt in Tibetan Buddhism to this day. When\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita died in 788, he was succeeded by\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, who lived until 795.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s magnum opus is a composition\nentitled Tattva-sa\u1e43graha (Summary of reality), which\ncontains 3645 verses. The work was provided with a prose commentary by\nKamala\u015b\u012bla called\nTattva-sa\u1e43graha-pa\u00f1jik\u0101. A modern edition\nof the verse work and its commentary together runs to more than 1100\npages. Aside from its contribution to the development of Madhyamaka\nthought, the work is also a valuable source of information about the\nstate of Indian philosophy in the eighth century. The work is divided\ninto twenty-six chapters, the topics of which are as follows:\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya doctrine of primodial matter\n(prak\u1e5bti) as the source of the physical world\nVarious doctrines of God as the source of the world\nThe doctrine of inherent natures (svabh\u0101va) as the\nsource of the world\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s doctrine of Brahman-as-language as the\nsource of the world\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga doctrine of human spirit\n(puru\u1e63a)\nExamination of the doctrines of the self (\u0101tman) in\nthe Ny\u0101ya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, S\u0101\u1e43khya,\nDigambara Jaina, Advaita and Buddhist personalist\n(pudgalav\u0101din) schools\nThe doctrine of the permanence of things\nVarious doctrines of karma and its ripening\nA critical examination of substance\nA critical examination of quality\nA critical examination of action\nA critical examination of universals\nA critical examination of particularity\nA critical examination of inherence (the relation between\nuniversals and particulars and between substances and qualities)\nAn examination of words and their meanings\nAn examination of sense perception\nAn examination of inference\nAn examination of other means of acquiring knowledge\nA critical examination of Jaina epistemology\nAn examination of time\nA critical examination of materialism\nOn the external world (that is, the world external to\nconsciousness)\nA critical examination of revelation as a source of knowledge\nExamination of the idea that some propositions are\nself-validating\nExamination of the notion of supernormal powers\n\n\nIn addition to Tattvasa\u1e43graha,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita wrote commentaries on\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s V\u0101dany\u0101ya (Methods of\ndebate) and J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s\nSatyadvayavibha\u1e45ga. His most original contribution to\nthe development of Madhyamaka philosophy is a verse treatise called\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra (Ornament of Centrism),\nwhich contains ninety-seven stanzas, to which he also provided a prose\ncommentary.\n8.2 Contributions\n\nBy the time \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was active, the philosophy of\nthe Yogac\u0101ra school had become so influential that it could not\neasily be dismissed. Whereas earlier M\u0101dhyamikas wrote\nrefutations of the Yog\u0101cara doctrine, which they presented as a\nkind of subjective idealism, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita embraced it.\nLike Bh\u0101vaviveka and J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita adopted much of the terminology and the\nlogic and epistemology of Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti and their\nlater followers. But whereas Bh\u0101vaviveka had refrained from\nfollowing Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s lead into\nYogac\u0101ra, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita endorsed a kind of\nsubjective idealism, albeit as a stage that prepared one for the\nMadhyamaka doctrine of the emptiness of all phenomena. Toward the end\nof Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra, in verses 92\u201393,\nhe writes that by embracing the doctrine of mind only, one stops\ntaking external objects as real; then by embracing Madhyamaka, one\nrealizes that no objects at all have substance; then, taking the reins\nof reasoning, one rides the chariot of both systems as a single great\nvehicle (mah\u0101y\u0101na). The largest part of this\ntreatise\u2014where the reins of reasoning are taken up\u2014is\ndevoted to an extended version of the \u201cneither one nor\nmany\u201d argument that had been presented by\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha.\n\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra begins with the observation\nthat if a phenomenon has an essential nature, then either that nature\nis simple or complex, that is, it is either a single thing or many\nthings; there is no third possibility. This leads to discussions of\ndoctrines by several schools of Indian philosophy, both Buddhist and\nnon-Buddhist. Each of the schools examined posits at least one entity\nthat is completely uniform in nature and therefore has no internal\ndifferentiations. Several schools posit a uniform entity that is said\nto be the single source of all multiplicity. Drawing on arguments by\nearlier Buddhist thinkers such as Dharmak\u012brti,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that if there were a uniform,\npermanent and unobstructed singularity, then everything it supposedly\ncauses would have to exist all the time. A cause is something in the\npresence of which an effect arises and in the absence of which the\neffect does not arise. But if a cause is permanent, then it is never\nabsent, so none of its putative effects can ever be absent. In a\ntheory that posits a single permanent cause of all things, there is no\nsatisfactory account of all the changes that are experienced in daily\nlife, nor is there any satisfactory account of temporal sequences or\nthe fact that things exist in some places but not in others. This\nargument is applied to discredit the S\u0101\u1e43khya doctrine of\nprimordial matter, the Ny\u0101ya doctrine of God, and the\nVed\u0101ntin doctrine of Brahman. It is also applied to the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine that all things arise from consciousness.\nAfter arguing against the main candidates for singularity nominated by\nthe various schools, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita turns his attention\nto multiplicity. The very idea of multiplicity, he notes, only makes\nsense if one is talking about a collection of singularities. Given,\nhowever, that there are no singularities, there cannot be any\ncollection of them. This being the case, no inherent nature of any\nentity can be either singular or multiple; if an entity has neither a\nsingular nor a multiple inherent nature, it has no inherent nature at\nall. In other words, all phenomena are empty of inherent natures.",
