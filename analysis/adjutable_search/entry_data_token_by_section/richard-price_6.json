    "main_text": "Theology || A priori Arguments for God\u2019s existence\n3.1 A priori Arguments for God\u2019s existence\n\nPrice appended to the Review a \u201cDissertation on the\nBeing and Attributes of the Deity\u201d, in which he largely follows\nSamuel Clarke\u2019s a priori arguments to show that there\nmust be a first cause that is perfect in every respect. He begins with\na version of the well-known argument from contingency, which proceeds\nfrom things that exist contingently to something that exists\nnon-contingently, i.e., necessarily. Price accepts the argument but\nholds that previous writers have not properly explained the nature of\nthe necessity of God\u2019s existence. The necessity in question is\nnot what he terms \u201crelative\u201d or\n\u201cconsequential\u201d necessity, as when we say there must be a\ncause of every effect. Rather,\n\n\nthe impossibility of not existing implied in the necessity of\nGod\u2019s existence is \u2026 an impossibility appearing\nimmediately, and carrying its own evidence with it; an\nimpossibility in the nature of the thing itself. (R 287)\n\n\nPrice then goes on, in short order, to deduce several conclusions.\nFirst, that the \u201cnecessity of God\u2019s existence\nimplies that it is necessary \u2026 to the very conception\nof all other existence\u201d (R 288). What can be conceived without a\ndivine ground can be conceived as existing alone. Such beings\n\n\nmight be conceived to exist without him, which is the same as\nconceiving him not to exist, and consequently, with the\npossibility of his non-existence. (R 288)\n\n\nWhat exists necessarily can have no limits or imperfections. For what\nis limited could have had different limits, and so the limited has\nonly contingent existence. Finally, and for our purposes most\nimportantly, a necessary being does not possess its properties, as\nother things do, by participation in those properties as\nsomething distinct from it. Suppose, for example, God were to be\nomnipresent by existing in every part of space, then we could\nconceive of infinite space without him. But if space were\ndistinct from him we would need an explanation of why he existed in\nall of it, rather than in some part, or in none. The same, Price says,\nis true of God\u2019s relation to all his attributes, which he must\npossess\n\n\nin a manner peculiar to himself. He is intelligent, not by the\napprehension of truth, but by being truth. (R\n290)\n\n\nAnd so on, for all his other attributes.\n\n\nThere can be numberless beings who are powerful, wise and benevolent;\nbut there can be but one being of whose nature, power, wisdom\nand benevolence in necessary union and forming one idea, are the\nessential attributes. (R 295)\n\n\nPrice did not publish this piece for some time, and remained\nconcerned that the \u201cparticular imperfection\nof language\u201d rendered him \u201cincapable of stating [his view]\nwith sufficient correctness and clearness\u201d (R 286). \nIt is indeed rather puzzling. His view is clearly influenced by\nthe neo-Platonism which, presumably, he gets from Cudworth.\nNecessary truths depend on the Forms, on their self-identity. The\nForms constitute a purely intelligible realm, and other things are\nintelligible only in so far as they participate in the Forms. Since\nthe Forms are purely intelligible beings their mode of being, the manner in which they exist is by being\nthought. That which thinks the Forms, namely God, is that in which\nthey are. They cannot exist independently, because their very being is\nto be a part of his nature. And it is his own nature governs his\nwill.\n\nBe that as it may, Price\u2019s account of God\u2019s nature enables\nhim to deal with a standard objection to those who reject the Divine\nCommand Theory of morality. If we conceive of morality as a set of\ntruths that are outside God\u2019s control, are we not demeaning\nGod\u2019s sovereignty, by supposing that there is something both\nexternal to him and co-eternal with him? Price\u2019s answer is that\nGod\u2019s rectitude consists, not in obeying some principles that he\ndid not create, cannot change, and must accept, but in following his\nown nature.\n",
