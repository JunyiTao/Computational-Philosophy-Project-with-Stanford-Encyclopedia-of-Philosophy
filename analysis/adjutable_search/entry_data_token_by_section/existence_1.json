    "main_text": "Meinongianism\n2. Meinongianism\n\nIn part on the basis of the above discussed problems, many\nphilosophers reject descriptivism and accept that ordinary proper\nnames are devices of direct reference, that there are true genuinely\nsingular negative existentials, and so that there are nonexistent\nobjects. \u2018Ronald McDonald\u2019 seems like a referring term,\nopen to existential generalization, in the sense that a sentence like\n\u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019 entails \u2018There is\nsomething that does not exist\u2019, and \u2018exists\u2019 seems\nlike a predicate that applies or fails to apply to the designation of\nsubject-place terms, on a par with a predicate like\n\u2018sits\u2019. The Meinongian embraces these appearances and\nconcludes that reality includes referents for empty names and those\nreferents do not exist. The Meinongian trades logical and semantic\nsimplicity for metaphysical abundance.\n\nMeinongianism is the thesis that there are objects that do not exist\nand so included in the most unrestricted domain of quantification and\ndiscourse are nonexistent entities. One immediate challenge for the\nMeinongian is to offer individuating conditions for nonexistents. The\nmost straightforward comprehension principle is the naive principle\nthat, for any condition on objects, there is a unique object\nsatisfying exactly that condition. For our purposes, we can conceive\nof a condition as determining a set of properties; crudely, the\nproperties expressed by the predicates composing the condition. In\nthat case, condition C is the same condition as\nC\u2032 when they determine the same set of properties. It\nfollows that corresponding to any set of properties, there is exactly\none object with exactly those properties. The naive comprehension\nprinciple faces several problems. In what remains of this section, we\nshall present these problems and distinguish different versions of\nMeinongianism in terms of the devices employed to develop a restricted\ncomprehension principle for objects that avoids those problems. (All\nof these problems are developed in Russell\u2019s discussion of Meinong,\nsee [Russell 1905a, 1907]. For a discussion of the debate between\nRussell and Meinong, see [Smith 1985].)\n\nThe first is the problem of incomplete objects. Conditions need not be\ntotal; that is, we do not require that the set of properties a\ncondition determines is such that, for every property, either it or\nits complement is a member of that set. So, by the naive comprehension\nprinciple, the condition of being a singer defines an object with\nexactly that property\u2014being a singer\u2014and no other\nproperties. A set with other properties as well is a distinct set of\nproperties and so corresponds to a different condition and hence a\ndifferent object. Some find incomplete objects problematic in\nthemselves, as they are counterexamples to bivalence: Our singer, for\nexample, has neither the property of wearing a dress nor the property\nof not wearing a dress. But they also lead to more general threats of\nparadox. Our singer is an object with exactly one property: That of\nbeing a singer. This is its sole defining characteristic. So having a\nexactly one property is also a property of our singer and that\nproperty is distinct from the property of being a singer, which our\nsinger also has. So, the singer has two properties. Contradiction. One\nsimple solution is to restrict the comprehension principle to total\nconditions. The resulting proposal, however, leads to a questionable\napplication of Meinongian metaphysics to problems of fictional truth,\nas many want to claim that there is simply no fact of the matter as to\nwhether or not Sherlock Holmes has a mole on his left shoulder, as\nthat is left underdetermined by the Holmes stories and there are no\ndeeper grounds for either predication.  The promise of employing\nnonexistent objects in explaining apparent truths about fiction is one\nof the theory\u2019s main virtues.  Relatedly, this solution\nundermines a primary motivation for Meinongianism\u2014namely, the\nidea that there is a subject of predication corresponding to any\nobject of thought, as we certainly do not think only of complete\nobjects. So, the simple solution is too simple and the Meinongian is\nbetter to find another, more complex solution to the problems of\nincompleteness.\n\nThe second is the problem of contradiction. A naive comprehension\nprinciple generates objects that violate the principle of\nnoncontradiction. Consider the condition of being taller than\neverything. By the naive comprehension principle, this condition\ndetermines an object and so there is an object that has exactly the\nproperty of being taller than everything. But then it is taller than\nitself, which is a contradiction given the irreflexivity of the taller\nthan relation. The irreflexivity of the taller than relation is\nnonlogical. But not so with the identity relation, as = is typically\ntaken to be a logical predicate. It is a logical truth that everything\nis self-identical; i.e., the sentence \u2200x x=x is true\nunder every interpretation. But consider the property of being\nself-distinct. By the naive comprehension principle this condition\ndetermines an object and that object is self-distinct. But then that\nobject does not satisfy the condition x=x. So our logically\ntrue sentence has a counterinstance. Contradiction.\n\nA third problem, one of Russell\u2019s objections to Meinongianism\n(see [Russell 1905a, 1907]), turns on the fact that existence is, on\nMeinongianism, a property and hence figures into the base of the naive\ncomprehension principle. So, consider the condition of being winged,\nbeing a horse, and existing. By the naive comprehension principle,\nthere is an object with exactly these features. But then this object\nexists, as existing is one of its characterizing features.\nIntuitively, however, there is no existent winged horse. An existent\nobject cannot so easily be thought into being. Indeed, for every\nintuitively nonexistent object that motivates\nMeinongianism\u2014Zeus, Pegasus, Santa Clause, and Ronald\nMcDonald\u2014there is, by the naive abstraction principle, an object\njust like it but with the additional property of existing. But then\nthere is an existing Zeus, an existing Pegasus, etc.. This is\noverpopulation not of being but of existence as well.\n\nThe naive comprehension principle, then, must be rejected and a\nrestricted principle connecting sets of properties with objects be put\nin its place.  The principle should generate enough objects to serve\nthe Meinongian purpose of ensuring a corresponding object for every\nthought while avoiding the problems discussed above. We can\ndistinguish two strategies, both suggested by Meinong\u2019s student\nErnst Mally [Mally 1912]. The first distinguishes two kinds of\nproperties, what, following Terence Parsons [Parsons 1978, 1980], we\nshall call nuclear and extra-nuclear properties. While the distinction\nremains ultimately unclear, the key idea is that nuclear properties\nare part of a thing\u2019s nature, broadly construed, and\nextra-nuclear properties are external to a thing\u2019s nature; more\nprecisely, nuclear properties, but not extra-nuclear properties, are\npart of the characterization of what the object is. The comprehension\nprinciple is then restricted to conditions involving only nuclear\npredicates.  Problematic properties, like existing, etc., are deemed\nextra-nuclear and beyond the scope of the comprehension principle, not\ndetermining the objects that there are. Nuclear, not extra-nuclear,\nproperties individuate objects. The second Meinongian camp\ndistinguishes two modes of predication: What Mally called determining\nand satisfying, Hector-Neri Casta\u00f1eda [Casta\u00f1eda 1974,\n1975,1978, 1980, 1986, 1989, 1990] called internal and external\npredication, William Rapaport [Rapaport 1978] called constituency and\nexemplification, Kit Fine [Fine 1982] called implicit and explicit,\nand Edward Zalta [Zalta 1983, 1988] called encoding and\nexemplifying. There is, on this view, a single class of properties\nthat the comprehension principle ranges over, but the principle\ndetermines the properties encoded not exemplified (to follow\nZalta\u2019s terminology) by the object characterized. For every\ncondition, there is a unique object that encodes just those\nproperties. An object may or may not exemplify the properties it\nencodes. Sherlock Holmes encodes the properties of being a detective\nand living at 221B Baker Street, etc., but he does not exemplify those\nproperties. He exemplifies (but does not encode) the properties of\nbeing a fictional character and being the hero of Arthur Conan\nDoyle\u2019s Holmes stories. The properties an object exemplify are\nnot, on this view, a matter of mere stipulation.\n\nHow do these distinctions solve the problems raised above for the\nnaive comprehension principle? Let us begin with Parsons\u2019s view.\nParsons focuses on the problems of contradiction and of the existent\nwinged horse. Following Russell\u2019s discussion of Meinong, in\n[Russell 1905a, 1907], Parsons considers the threat of contradiction\ngenerated by impossible objects like the round square. Meinong claimed\nthat there is a round square, but that, complained Russell, leads to\nviolations of the principle of noncontradiction, as that entity is\nthen both round and not round, in light of the fact that it is square,\nwhich entails that it is not round. Parsons\u2019s response (see\n[Parsons 1980], 38\u201342) seems to be to deny that being square\nentails not being round, in which case it is simply false that the\nround square is not round. He thinks that that implication holds only\nfor \u201creal\u201d objects. He claims that there are\ncounterexamples to the claim that all square objects are not round;\nafter all, the round square is a square object that is round! This\nsolution, however, does not seem to solve the more general threat of\ncontradiction, as discussed above. Indeed, Parsons himself recognizes\nthe limited success of his response (see [Parsons, 1980, 42n8]). He\nallows that being non-squared is a nuclear property. But then his\ncomprehension principle entails that there is an object corresponding\nto the condition of being a non-squared square, where that object\ninstantiates the incompatible properties of being a square and being a\nnon-square. The threat of contradiction has not been silenced.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to Parsons\u2019s response to the existence problem.\nThe naive comprehension principle faced the problem of generating an\nexistent winged horse. Because existence is an extra-nuclear property,\nhowever, Parsons\u2019s version of the comprehension principle, which\ncorrelates sets of only nuclear properties to objects, avoids this\nproblem. The condition of being an existent winged horse is not\ncomposed solely of nuclear properties and so Parsons\u2019s principle\ndoes not correlate it to an object. Parsons\u2019s distinction\nbetween nuclear and extra-nuclear properties similarly promises to\nsolve the problem of incomplete objects. Recall our singer from above.\nThat object does not have exactly one property; instead, it has\nexactly one nuclear property. As having exactly one nuclear property\nis itself an extra-nuclear property, much as being a complete object\nis on Parsons\u2019s view, the threat of contradiction is\navoided.\u00a0\n\nThe distinction between nuclear and extra-nuclear properties remains\nunclear. Parsons introduced the distinction with lists of nuclear\npredicates (\u2018is blue\u2019, \u2018is tall\u2019,\n\u2018kicked Socrates\u2019, \u2018is a mountain\u2019) and\nextra-nuclear predicates (\u2018exists\u2019, \u2018is thought\nabout by Meinong\u2019, \u2018is complete\u2019). He then tells us\nthat the extra-nuclear are those that do not stand for properties of\nindividuals ([Parsons 1980, 24]). And, of course, it is nuclear and\nnot extra-nuclear properties by which objects are individuated.\nParsons\u2019s individuation principle for objects is the following:\n\u201c(1) No two objects (real or unreal) have exactly the\nsame nuclear properties; and (2) For any set of nuclear properties,\nsome object has all the properties in that set and no other nuclear\nproperties\u201d ([Parsons 1980, 19]). But it is not clear what\nstatus individual identity properties\u2014properties like\nbeing identical to A, where A is an\nindividual substance like, say, Parsons himself\u2014have with\nrespect to this distinction. He sometimes claims that they are\nextra-nuclear properties ([Parsons 1980, 28]). In that case, however,\nParsons is committed to the problematic thesis of the identity of\nindiscernibles and so the impossibility of two primitively distinct\nbut qualitatively identical objects. (For further discussion, see the\nentry on\n the identity of indiscernibles.)\nMany contemporary philosophers agree that objects are not individuated\nqualitatively, their identity and diversity being primitive. Max\nBlack\u2019s two qualitatively indiscernible spheres are primitively\ndistinct, in virtue of which one has the property of being that very\nthing and the other lacking that property (see [Black 1953]). For\nParsons to accept this, he needs to include individual identity\nproperties among the nuclear properties. Furthermore, it is hard to\nsee why identity properties are not properties of\nindividuals. Suppose, then, that we count individual identity\nproperties like being identical to A as nuclear properties,\nthose properties entering the range of Parsons\u2019s restricted\ncomprehension principle. Then the nuclear negations of those\nproperties are also nuclear. But then we can take the set of all\nobjects, construct the individual identity property for each,\nconstruct the nuclear negation of each of those properties, and then\nconstruct a condition from those properties that, by Parsons\u2019s\ncomprehension principle, corresponds to an object.  Then there is an\nobject that is distinct from every object that there is, which is a\ncontradiction. It is unclear, then, that the distinction between\nnuclear and extra-nuclear properties and the restriction of the\ncomprehension principle to nuclear properties solves the problems\nfacing the naive comprehension principle. (For further discussion of\nParsons\u2019s view, see [Fine 1982, 1984] and [Zalta 1992].)\n\nEarlier we distinguished between two versions of sophisticated\nMeinongianism.  The first, based on the distinction between nuclear\nand extra-nuclear properties, was found lacking. We turn now to the\nsecond, based on the distinction between encoding and exemplifying a\nproperty, focusing on Zalta\u2019s version of the view, which is the\nmost fully developed in the literature. Whereas Parsons distinguished\ndifferent kinds of properties, restricting the comprehension principle\nto only nuclear properties in the hope of thereby avoiding the\nproblems plaguing the naive comprehension principle, Zalta\ndistinguishes two different modes of having a property for the same\neffect. Exemplifying a property is the familiar way in which an\nindividual has a property; it is roughly what most metaphysicians have\nin mind when the speak of instantiating a property. Obama exemplifies\nhumanity, my chair exemplifies being comfortable, and the fig tree in\nmy backyard exemplifies needing water. What the comprehension\nprinciple does is say not what properties object exemplify, in this\nsense, but rather what properties they encode. So, for any\ncondition C on properties, there is an object that encodes\nexactly those properties, which leaves open whether or not those\nobjects also exemplify those properties.\n\nHow does this distinction solve the problems facing Meinongianism\npresented earlier in this section? By the comprehension principle, the\ncondition of being a singer determines an object with exactly that\nproperty. But the comprehension principle does not imply that that\nobject exemplifies the property of being a singer but rather that it\nencodes that property. Exemplifying the property of being a singer\nrequires exemplifying other properties like having a spatial location,\nhaving a voice box, etc., all properties our singer neither encodes\nnor exemplifies. But the object can encode the property of being a\nsinger without encoding these further properties. The singer does\nexemplify some properties, such as the property of being abstract. The\nsinger encodes the property of being a singer, does not\nencode the property of being abstract, and exemplifies\nmultiple properties, including the property of being abstract, being\nthe topic of this paragraph, and not being a singer. This is not\ncontradictory given the fundamental difference between encoding and\nexemplifying.  More generally, Zalta\u2019s comprehension principle\ncorrelates sets of properties with objects that encode, not\n(necessarily) exemplify, those properties. Insofar as the set of\nproperties characterizing an object are not complete, the resulting\nobject will be incomplete with respect to the properties it\nencodes. But it need not be incomplete with respect to the properties\nit exemplifies. While our singer encodes neither the property of\nwearing blue shoes nor the property of not wearing blue shoes, we can\nsay that it exemplifies the property of not wearing blue\nshoes. Bi-valence is saved, at least with respect to\nexemplification.\n\nRestricting the comprehension principle to the properties encoded and\nrejecting an easy transfer between properties encoded and properties\nexemplified also promises to avoid the other threats of contradiction\npresented above. Recall the logically impossible condition of being\nself-distinct. The principle of noncontradiction concerns the\nproperties objects exemplify, not the properties objects encode\n(assuming our Meinongian is going to account for impossible\nobjects). Because an object can encode inconsistent properties without\nexemplifying them, impossible objects do not violate the principle of\nnoncontradiction. Finally, Russell\u2019s worry that a Meinongian\ncomprehension principle generates existent winged horses can be\nanswered. There is an object correlated to the condition of being an\nexistent winged horse, but that object encodes and does not exemplify\nthe property of existing. Being existent can characterize an object\nwithout that object exemplifying existence. So we do not need to worry\nabout an overpopulation of existent beings, as existent beings\nexemplify existence, which the existent winged horse does\nnot.\u00a0\n\nA view based on the distinction between encoding and exemplifying\navoids the standard objections to Meinongianism while promising to\ndeliver that view\u2019s many benefits. The semantics and logic is\nstraightforward and simple and surface forms of the natural language\nsentences of interest in this article match their deep logical forms.\nBut the ontological costs are evident. There is semantic and logical\nsimplicity at a metaphysical price.
