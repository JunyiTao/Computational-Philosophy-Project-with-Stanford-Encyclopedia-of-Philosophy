    "main_text": "The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument || Successive Addition Cannot Form an Actual Infinite\n7.3 Successive Addition Cannot Form an Actual Infinite\n\nCraig\u2019s second argument addresses this very point.\n\nThe temporal series of events is a collection formed\nby successive addition.\nA collection formed by successive synthesis is not an\nactual infinite.\nTherefore, the temporal series of events cannot be an\nactual infinite (Craig 1979: 103; Craig and Sinclair 2009, 117).\n\n\nThe collection of historical events is formed by successively adding\nevents, one following another. The events are not temporally\nsimultaneous but occur over a period of time as the series continues\nto acquire new members. Even if an actual infinite were possible, it\ncould not be realized by successive addition; in adding to the series,\nno matter how much adding is done, even to infinity, the series\nremains finite and only potentially infinite. One can neither count to\nnor traverse the infinite (Craig and Sinclair 2009: 118).\n\nIt might be objected that this sounds very much like Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes that prohibit Achilles or anyone from either beginning to\ncross an area or succeeding in doing so. However, notes Craig,\nsignificant disanalogies disallow this conclusion. For one,\nZeno\u2019s argument rests on progressively-narrowing, unequal\ndistances that sum to a finite distance, whereas in traversing the\npast the equal distances continue to the infinity of the future.\nSecond, Zeno\u2019s distances are potential because of divisibility,\nwhereas the distances from the past are actual distances or times to\nbe traversed.\n\nMorriston argues that premise 10 presupposes what is to be shown,\nnamely, that there is a beginning point. He asks, \n\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t there have been an infinite series of years in\nwhich there was no first year? It\u2019s true that in such a series\nwe never \u201carrive\u201d at infinity, but surely that is only\nbecause infinity is, so to speak, \u201calways already there\u201d.\nAt every point in such a series, infinitely many years have\nalready passed by.... Each event in a beginningless series\nterminating in the present could have been \u201cadded\u201d to the\ninfinitely many prior events. (2003: 290) \n\n\nThus, we don\u2019t need a starting point to form an actual infinite\nby successive addition. Infinity is already present in the series.\n Craig responds that we cannot just add \u201carriving at the\npresent\u201d to an already existing infinite.\n\n\n\nBefore the present event could occur, the event immediately before it\nwould have to occur; and before that event could occur, the event\nimmediately before it would have to occur; and so on ad\ninfinitum. One gets driven back into the past, making it\nimpossible for any event to occur. Thus, if the series of events were\nbeginningless, the present could not have occurred, which is absurd.\n(Craig and Sinclair 209: 118) \n\n\nIn other words, Why this moment rather than another? \n\nMorriston replies that that is just the way it is; \u201cthe past\njust is the series of events that have already\nhappened\u201d. To require a reason for the series of past events\narriving at now is to appeal to the principle of sufficient reason,\nwhich he deems both suspect and inappropriate for Craig to invoke\n(Morriston 2003: 293). \n\nTo defend his position, Craig presents Bertrand Russell\u2019s\nexample of Tristram Shandy, who writes his autobiography. It takes him\na year to write about one day of his life, so that as his life\nprogresses so does his autobiography in which he gets progressively\nfarther behind. Russell concludes that \n\n\nif (Shandy) had lived forever, and had not wearied of his task, then,\neven if his life had continued as eventfully as it began, no part of\nhis biography would have remained unwritten. ([1903] 1937: 358) \n\n\nHowever, Oderberg (2002: 310) claims, Russell seems to have\nfallaciously moved from (1) For every day, there is a year such that,\nby the end of that year, Shandy has recorded that day, which is true,\nto (2) There is a year such that, for every day, by the end of that\nyear Shandy has recorded that day. (2) is needed for Russell\u2019s\nconclusion but fails to follow from (1). Shandy\u2019s writing never\ncatches up with his life; indeed, the longer he lives, even if for\ninfinity, his writing would never catch up to his life but\nprogressively would get farther behind. Indeed, if he has been living\nand writing from infinity, his autobiography is infinitely behind his\nlife. Contrary to Russell, there will be days\u2014an infinite\nnumber\u2014about which he will be unable to write. As can be\nimagined, this example has been greatly contested, modified, and has\ngenerated a literature of its own. For samples, see Eells (1988),\nOderberg (2002), and Oppy (2003). Waters (2013) reformulates the\nparadox, attempting to avoid problems with earlier formulations.\n\nFinally, it is objected that Craig\u2019s argument presupposes an\n\\(A\\) view of time, where time flows from past to present to future\nand not all events tenselessly coexist. It seems that Craig\u2019s\nargument cannot be sustained if time is understood in the \\(B\\) sense,\nwhere all members of the series tenselessly coexist, being equally\nreal (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1994). On a \\(B\\) view of time there is no\nbeginning, and it would seem that on this view the argument would\ncollapse.\n",
