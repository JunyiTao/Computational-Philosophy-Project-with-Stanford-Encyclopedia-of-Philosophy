    "main_text": "Philosophy of mathematics || Logic and foundations: intuition and predicativity\n3.1 Logic and foundations: intuition and predicativity\n\nConcerning logic and foundations of mathematics,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s position is governed by two theses:\n\nLogical inferences alone are epistemically inadequate to express\nthe essential structure of a genuine mathematical reasoning in view of\nits understandability (see Poincar\u00e9 1908: 159; 1913b:\n452).\nAs a consequence of the logical antinomies, one should avoid any\nimpredicative concept formation.\n\n\nHistorically, both theses are directed broadly against the founders of\nmodern logic and set theory such as Cantor, Peano, Frege, Russell,\nZermelo, and Hilbert. On closer inspection, the historical situation\nis more complicated. With respect to Georg Cantor, for example, we\nmust distinguish his work as a logical-set theoretical method useful\nin treating mathematical problems especially in the theory of\nfunctions on the one hand, and on the other hand, set theory as a tool\nfor foundations or for considerations on infinite cardinality. Through\nG\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, Poincar\u00e9 was familiar with\nCantor\u2019s work of the first type and uses it in his theory of\nFuchsian functions in 1882 (Poincar\u00e9 1882: 1167), even having\npersonal contact with Cantor (see Gray 1991: 22; Cantor 1991: 188; and\nD\u00e9caillot 2008: 281). However, Poincar\u00e9 rejected the\nlater foundational work of Cantor, saying that\n\n\nThere is no actual infinity, the Cantorians have forgotten that, and\nthey have fallen into contradiction. It is true that Cantorism\nrendered services, but that was when it was applied to a real problem\nwhose terms were clearly defined, and we could walk safely.\nLogisticians as Cantorians have forgotten. (Poincar\u00e9 1908:\n212\u2013213; 1913b: 484)\n\n\nWhile it has been stressed by all commentators that\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s concerns with the foundations of mathematics\nare very different from those of the logicians, there is no unanimity\non the focus of the dispute. Emile Boutroux and Warren Goldfarb claim\nthat Poincar\u00e9 is condemning the \u201clogical\u201d point of\nview for not providing psychological conviction (Boutroux 1914;\nGoldfarb 1985), while Detlefsen and Heinzmann argue for a difference\nat the epistemological level rather than a psychological one\n(Detlefsen 1992, 1993; Heinzmann 1995). In a famous response to\nRussell, Poincar\u00e9 refuses to consider logic or epistemology\nindependently from psychology (Poincar\u00e9 1909: 482). It would be\nfalse, however, to believe that he thus conflates logic and\npsychology. Indeed, Poincar\u00e9 does not use the term psychology\nin the modern sense, but rather in all situations where he wants to\nemphasize the dimension of understanding, in particular its historical\nelements, which he contrasts with the mere correct logical exposition\nof the result. It is therefore not surprising that, according to\nPoincar\u00e9, mathematics requires intuition, interpreted as an\nelement of understanding, not only in the context of discovery, but\nequally in the context of justification. As we have already seen, in\narithmetic pure intuition is necessary to justify the complete (or\nmathematical) induction principle. It should also be noted that the\nterm \u201cintuition\u201d is quite ambiguous, a fact that is well\nknown and explicitly discussed by Poincar\u00e9 himself. In The\nValue of Science, he distinguished three kinds of intuition: an\nappeal to sense and to imagination, generalization by induction, and\nintuition of pure number\u2014whence comes the axiom of induction in\nmathematics. The first two kinds cannot give us certainty, but, he\nsays, \u201cwho would seriously doubt the third, who would doubt\narithmetic?\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 33; 1913b: 216).\n\nFrom 1905, Poincar\u00e9 therefore opposed the logicist thesis that\nclaims to be able to prove all mathematical truths without recourse to\nintuition, once the principles of logic are admitted. Poincar\u00e9\nsuspected that the logicians were actually making an equivocal use of\nthe term logic and that they no longer sought the former kind, but\nrather a \u201cnew logic\u201d containing principles of synthetic\nproof or formations of non-logical concept. He was evidently right\ngiven that not only is the modern logic of predicates richer than the\ntraditional (syllogistic) logic, but in order to carry out the\nlogicist project, one is even led to expand logic again by certain\nset-theoretic postulates of existence.\n\nAs Detlefsen points out, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s most interesting\nargument does not concern the status of the basic laws of the logical\nsystems, but rather the \u201cplace of logical inference in\nmathematical proof\u201d (Detlefsen 1992: 349). According to\nPoincar\u00e9, today\u2019s admitted validity of a logical, i.e.,\ntopic-neutral, inference from a proposition \\(p\\) to a\nproposition \\(q\\) (in Tarski\u2019s conception: every\nmodel of \\(p\\) is a model of \\(q)\\) is not enough to\nsustain epistemic growth of mathematical knowledge, which\nrequires rather that \u201c\\(p\\) be seen\nmathematically to imply \\(q\\) (i.e., that \\(p\\)\nand \\(q\\) be seen as united by a\ncommon mathematical structure)\u201d (Detlefsen 1993: 272).\nPoincar\u00e9 insists on the non-invariance of mathematical\nreasoning with respect to its content and advances, so to speak, a\nlocal conception of reasoning (for example, the mathematical induction\nprinciple for arithmetical reasoning). According to this view, a gap\nin a proof is no longer a logical gap, but a gap in the mathematical\nunderstanding (Detlefsen 1992: 360, 366). If\n\u201cformalization\u201d and a universal calculus are, then, no\nlonger the criterion of mathematical rigor, how shall rigor be\nmaintained? Poincar\u00e9\u2019s response mentions in particular\nthe condensing of the content of the premises to the content of the\nconclusion by means of intuition. Rigor is obtained by combining Ernst\nMach\u2019s principle of the economy of thought with the concept of\nharmony, that is, thanks to \u201cthe fortunate inventions of\nlanguage\u201d that introduce an order-structure, the complexity of a\ndomain of objects is made more harmonious by the introduction of an\ninvariance (see Poincar\u00e9 1908: 23\u201330; 1913b:\n371\u2013375). Thus, in mathematical reasoning, rigor is placed in\nthe context of a \u201cmathematical architecture\u201d whose\nsimplest expression is found in mathematical induction.\n\nRegarding the antinomies discovered at the turn of the century\u2014\nsuch as Richard\u2019s or Russell\u2019s paradoxes\u2014they are,\naccording to Poincar\u00e9, the consequence of an abusive use of\nintuition with respect to abstract entities that arises from the\nadoption of conceptual realism (Platonism). In a definition of the\nform \\(\\exists y \\forall x ((x \\in y) \\leftrightarrow D[x])\\), the\nexistence of the set \\(y\\) is intuitively postulated\nwithout any restriction for the predicate \\(D[x]\\). For an\nanti-Platonist like Poincar\u00e9 was from 1906 on, intuition is not\na mode for representing an object, but rather concerns our capacity to\nfollow a rule. We see this quite clearly in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\ndiscussion of mathematical induction.\n\nWe know that Poincar\u00e9 hoped to avoid the known antinomies by\nlimiting himself to predicative definitions (see Heinzmann 1985). It\nwas Russell who introduced the terms \u201cpredicative\u201d and\n\u201cnon-predicative\u201d to highlight the difference between two\nkinds of propositional functions, those that determine and those that\ndo not determine a class. He called the first\n\u201cpredicative\u201d and the second\n\u201cnon-predicative.\u201d Poincar\u00e9 attributed the mistake\nof non-predicative definitions to a vicious circle: a definition is\n\u201cnon-predicative\u201d if the definiens contains or\nrelates to a totality of which the definiendum is a part. He\nformulated a principle to avoid circularity, which leads directly to\nRussell\u2019s famous vicious circle principle:\n\n\nI recognize further this element of truth in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nobjection to totality, that whatever in any way concerns all\nof any or some (undetermined) of the members of a\nclass must not be itself one of the members of a class. (Russell 1973\n[1906]: 198)\n\n\nRussell succeeded in developing a theory that respects his principle,\nthe ramified type theory. In Poincar\u00e9, we find nothing that is\ncomparable, for he believed that the principle guarded against the\ndefinitional mistakes that he denounced. He did not seriously take up\nthe question and only formulated successively different variants of\nthe principle when he learned from Ernst Zermelo that the proof,\nproposed by Argand and Cauchy, of the fundamental theorem of algebra\nmakes an appeal precisely to the rejected, non-predicative\ndefinitions. Hence, only when the measures taken against the logical\nantinomies affected \u201creal mathematics\u201d did he try to\nmodify the principle. The discussion between Poincar\u00e9, Russell,\nPeano, and Zermelo on the measures to take lasted for six years. The\ndifficulty consisted in the obligation to formulate a principle that\nis neither too restrictive for the important results in analysis, nor\ntoo liberal with respect to the formations of concept to be excluded\nby reason of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophical position. The\nabsence of a truly convincing solution shows that the analysis of the\nconcept of predicativity with the help of informal methods appeared to\nhave reached its limits.\n\nIn 1912, the year of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s death, Luitzen Egbertus\nJan Brouwer in his inaugural lecture at Amsterdam characterized two\nopposing orientations in mathematics: intuitionism (in large part\nFrench) and formalism (in large part German). The two orientations\nwere represented by the greatest mathematicians of the antagonistic\nFranco-German pairing: Henri Poincar\u00e9 and David Hilbert\n(Brouwer 1912: 124\u2013125). According to the historians, the\nmodernists are thos eat the beginning of the 20th century who\nsupported an algebraization of the contents up to and including the\nlanguage of signs, while the conservative tendency finds the\njustification of mathematical knowledge before language, that is, in\nthe intellect. The polemics of the period persist today, even though\nits political metaphor (conservatism/modernism) has been reversed.\nSince the death of Bourbaki, it is fashionable to emphasize the\nintuitive aspects of mathematics. Yet, it is remarkable that Brouwer\nhimself criticizes Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conflation of \u201cthe\nlanguage of mathematics [and] the true mathematical\nconstruction\u201d (Brouwer 1907: 176). Brouwer is quite right to\nemphasize that Poincar\u00e9 does not separate language and\nmathematics. Poincar\u00e9 ascribes to language\u2014but not to\nlogic\u2014an essential role in mathematical reasoning. In this\nsense, we may say that Poincar\u00e9 is, with respect to Brouwer, a\nsemi-intuitionist who is located squarely between the two fronts of\nthe dispute. For him, mathematical reasoning possesses and must\nconserve an intuitive content that defies the formal contents. In\nsummary, the similarities and differences between Poincar\u00e9 and\nBrouwer can be shown as follows:\n\nPoincar\u00e9 and Brouwer share the conviction that intuition is\na guarantee of the certainty inherent in mathematics.\nThey share the conviction that complete induction is the\n\u201cmathematical reasoning par excellence.\u201d\nIn contrast with Poincar\u00e9, Brouwer considers intuition as\nthe unique basis of mathematical construction.\nTheir positions differ with respect to the relation that binds\nintuition and language.\nThe involvement of paradoxes is attributed by Brouwer to the\napplication of logical laws to a linguistic structure that can never\nbe transformed into proper mathematics. According to Brouwer,\nformalism is useless; according to Poincar\u00e9, the Platonistic\nphilosophy that \u2028accompanies it must be corrected.\nPoincar\u00e9 rejects an actual infinity; Brouwer accepts it\nprovided that it can be confined to an intuitive construction.\n\n",
