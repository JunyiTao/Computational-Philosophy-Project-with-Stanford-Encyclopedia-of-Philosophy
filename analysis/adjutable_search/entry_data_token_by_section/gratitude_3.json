    "main_text": "The Elements of the Grateful Response || Cognitive Elements\n3.1 Cognitive Elements\n\nAs a response to beneficence, gratitude seems to include certain\njudgments or beliefs\u2014at the very least, the\nbelief that an act of beneficence has occurred (Berger 1975: 302;\nWalker 1980\u20131981: 51; Manela 2019). In the absence of such\njudgments, we would be hard pressed to call a beneficiary grateful. A\nbeneficiary who failed to judge that an act of beneficence had been\nperformed would be unlikely to have the feelings or exhibit the\nbehaviors a grateful person ought to have and do (see sections\n 3.2,\n 3.3, and\n 3.4\n below). Such feelings and behaviors, after all, do not arise ex\nnihilo in normal people, so without a sufficient reason, we would\nexpect them not to arise.\n\nThe precise content of grateful beliefs may vary, depending on the\nnature of the act of beneficence in response to which they are called\nfor. They may, for instance, include the belief, on Y\u2019s\npart, that benefactor R is especially brave, or especially\nthoughtful, or especially self-sacrificing. They may include the\nbelief, on Y\u2019s part, that R cares a great deal\nabout Y (Berger 1975), and perhaps, relatedly, that\nY is worthy of being cared about to such an extent\n(Shaw 2013, Manela 2019). Some have argued that all instances of\ngratitude have a certain cognitive element in common: a belief in or\nan awareness of one\u2019s dependence on others\u2014the sort of\nawareness typically associated with humility (McAleer 2012; Roberts\n2014). These philosophers argue that humility is an essential part of\ngratitude, and that being humble is always part of being grateful.\nManela (2016a) argues that this generalization may be overstated.\nHumility-related beliefs may be a part of a grateful\nbeneficiary\u2019s response to a benefit that he desperately needed\nand could not provide for himself. But if R benefits\nY by doing something that Y was perfectly capable of\ndoing for himself (and something Y himself has done for\nothers in the past), then Y could be grateful to R\nwithout, in that instance, being aware of any dependence he might have\non others.\n\nThough the content of grateful beliefs may vary, a beneficiary must\nform more than just the belief that something good has happened to\nhim, if he is to qualify as grateful to R. If a\nbenevolent stranger saves my life at great risk to herself, and I\nconsequently form no beliefs about her as an agent (e.g., that she is\na benevolent or brave person, or that she cares about me), then I fail\nto be grateful to her\u2014though I may be grateful\nthat she saved me if I form the belief that something good\nhas happened to me. The difference in the content of the beliefs\ncalled for in response to benefit from an agent, on the one hand, and\nbenefit more generally, on the other, is yet another way in which\nprepositional gratitude is distinguished from propositional\n\u201cgratitude\u201d, or appreciation (see\n section 1).\n\nGratitude calls not only for the formation of certain beliefs, but for\ntheir persistence as well. A beneficiary who forgets an act\nof beneficence (or, at least, forgets too quickly) seems to fall short\nof what gratitude calls for (Aquinas II\u2013II, q. 104, art. 1;\nSeneca On Benefits: II.10.4; III.5.2). In fact, according to\nSeneca, a beneficiary who forgets a benefit is \u201cthe worst and\nmost ungrateful\u201d of beneficiaries\u2014perhaps because merely\nremembering a benefit is the easiest part of being grateful (Seneca\nOn Benefits: III.5.2).\n",
