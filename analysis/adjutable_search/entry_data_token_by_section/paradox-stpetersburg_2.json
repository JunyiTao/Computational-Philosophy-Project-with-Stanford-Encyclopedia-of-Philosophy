    "main_text": "Unrealistic Assumptions?\n3. Unrealistic Assumptions?\n\nSome authors claim that the St. Petersburg game should be dismissed\nbecause it rests on assumptions that can never be fulfilled. For\ninstance, Jeffrey (1983: 154) argues that \u201canyone who offers to\nlet the agent play the St. Petersburg gamble is a liar, for he is\npretending to have an indefinitely large bank\u201d. Similar\nobjections were raised in the eighteenth century by Buffon and\nFontaine (see Dutka 1988).\n\nHowever, it is not clear why Jeffrey\u2019s point about real-world\nconstraints would be relevant. What is wrong with evaluating a highly\nidealized game we have little reason to believe we will ever get to\nplay? H\u00e1jek and Smithson (2012) point out that the St\nPetersburg paradox is contagious in the following sense: As\nlong as you assign some nonzero probability to the hypothesis that the\nbank\u2019s promise is credible, the expected utility will be\ninfinite no matter how low your credence in the hypothesis is. Any\nnonzero probability times infinity equals infinity, so any option in\nwhich you get to play the St. Petersburg game with a nonzero\nprobability has infinite expected utility.\n\nIt is also worth keeping in mind that the St. Petersburg game may not\nbe as unrealistic as Jeffrey claims. The fact that the bank does not\nhave an indefinite amount of money (or other assets) available\nbefore the coin is flipped should not be a problem. All that\nmatters is that the bank can make a credible promise to the\nplayer that the correct amount will be made available within a\nreasonable period of time after the flipping has been completed. How\nmuch money the bank has in the vault when the player plays the game is\nirrelevant. This is important because, as noted in section 2, the\namount the player actually wins will always be finite. We can thus\nimagine that the game works as follows: We first flip the coin, and\nonce we know what finite amount the bank owes the player, the CEO will\nsee to it that the bank raises enough money.\n\nIf this does not convince the player, we can imagine that the central\nbank issues a blank check in which the player gets to fill in the\ncorrect amount once the coin has been flipped. Because the check is\nissued by the central bank it cannot bounce. New money is\nautomatically created as checks issued by the central bank are\nintroduced in the economy. Jeffrey dismisses this version of the St.\nPetersburg game with the following argument:\n\n\n[Imagine that] Treasury department delivers to the winner a crisp new\nbillion billion dollar bill. Due to the resulting inflation, the\nmarginal desirabilities of such high payoffs would presumably be low\nenough to make the prospect of playing the game have finite expected\n[utility]. (Jeffrey 1983: 155)\n\n\nJeffrey is probably right that \u201ca crisp new billion billion\ndollar bill\u201d would trigger some inflation, but this seems to be\nsomething we could take into account as we construct the game. All\nthat matters is that the utilities in the payoff scheme are\nlinear.\n\nReaders who feel unconvinced by this argument may wish to imagine a\nversion of the St. Petersburg game in which the player is hooked up to\nNozick\u2019s Experience Machine (see section 2.3 in the entry on\n hedonism).\n By construction, this machine can produce any pleasurable experience\nthe agent wishes. So once the coin has been flipped n times,\nthe Experience Machine will generate a pleasurable experience worth\n\\(2^n\\) units of utility on the player\u2019s personal utility scale.\nAumann (1977) notes without explicitly mention the Experience Machine\nthat:\n\n\nThe payoffs need not be expressible in terms of a fixed finite number\nof commodities, or in terms of commodities at all [\u2026] the\nlottery ticket [\u2026] might be some kind of open-ended activity --\none that could lead to sensations that he has not heretofore\nexperienced. Examples might be religious, aesthetic, or emotional\nexperiences, like entering a monastery, climbing a mountain, or\nengaging in research with possibly spectacular results. (Aumann 1977:\n444)\n\n\nA possible example of the type of experience that Aumann has in mind\ncould be the number of days spent in Heaven. It is not clear why time\nspent in Heaven must have diminishing marginal utility. \n\nAnother type of practical worry concerns the temporal dimension of the\nSt. Petersburg game. Brito (1975) claims that the coin flipping may\nsimply take too long time. If each flip takes n seconds, we\nmust make sure it would be possible to flip it sufficiently\nmany times before the player dies. Obviously, if there exists an upper\nlimit to how many times the coin can be flipped the expected utility\nwould be finite too.\n\nA straightforward response to this worry is to imagine that the\nflipping took place yesterday and was recorded on video. The first\nflip occurred at 11 p.m. sharp, the second flip \\(\\frac{60}{2}\\)\nminutes later, the third \\(\\frac{60}{4}\\) minutes after the second,\nand so on. The video has not yet been made available to anyone, but as\nsoon as the player has paid the fee for playing the game the video\nwill be placed in the public domain. Note that the coin could in\nprinciple have been flipped infinitely many times within a single\nhour. (This is an example of a \u201csupertask\u201d; see the entry\non\n supertasks.)\n\nIt is true that this random experiment requires the coin to be flipped\nfaster and faster. At some point we would have to spin the coin faster\nthan the speed of light. This is not logically impossible\nalthough this assumption violates a contingent law of nature. If you\nfind this problematic, we can instead imagine that someone throws a\ndart on the real line between 0 and 1. The probability that the dart\nhits the first half of the interval, \\(\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right),\\)\nis \\(\\frac{1}{2}.\\) And the probability that the dart hits the next\nquarter, \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right),\\) is\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), and so on. If \u201ccoin flips\u201d are generated\nin this manner the random experiment will be over in no time at all.\nTo steer clear of the worry that no real-world dart is infinitely\nsharp we can define the point at which the dart hits the real line as\nfollows: Let a be the area of the dart. The point at which the\ndart hits the interval [0,1] is defined such that half of the area of\na is to the right of some vertical line through a and\nthe other half to the left the vertical line. The point at which the\nvertical line crosses the interval [0,1] is the outcome of the random\nexperiment.\n\nIn the contemporary literature on the St. Petersburg paradox practical\nworries are often ignored, either because it is possible to imagine\nscenarios in which they do not arise, or because highly idealized\ndecision problems with unbounded utilities and infinite state spaces\nare deemed to be interesting in their own right.\n",
