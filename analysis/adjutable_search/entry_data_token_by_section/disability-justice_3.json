Disability in Contemporary Theories of Justice\n\nThe resurgence of philosophical interest in justice is often dated to\nthe publication of John Rawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice in\n1971. Although that was only two years before the passage of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, embodying a social model of disability\n(see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience),\n it was well before the academic reconceptualization of disability as\na social phenomenon. For the 25 years after A Theory of\nJustice, many justice theorists tacitly accepted the medical\nmodel (e.g., Dworkin 1981a,b; Daniels 1985). They treated disability\nas a physical or mental limitation of the individual, the principal\ncause of disability-related disadvantage. Disability thus posed a\nproblem for justice theories based on mutual advantage, hypothetical\nagreement, or material or social equality. People with disabilities\ndid not appear to offer reciprocal advantages; they complicated the\ntask of reaching a hypothetical agreement on the basic structure of\nsociety; and they made the goal of equality seem impossibly\ndemanding.\n\nBy the late 1990s, some mainstream political philosophers were\nbecoming acquainted with social models of disability, and some\ndisability theorists were gaining a hearing among political\nphilosophers. Some philosophers sought to modify distributive theories\nof justice to take account of the social and environmental character\nof disability; others cited the failure of those theories to take\nappropriate account of disability as one reason to reject exclusively\ndistributive approaches.\n\nBefore describing these developments, it is useful to distinguish two\ntypes of distributive theories. Modern social contract theories,\nnotably Rawls\u2019 (1971), seek to determine the fair terms of\nsocial cooperation to which individuals (generally with limited\nknowledge of their own situations) would agree; they argue that\ncertain distributive principles would be among those terms\n(Rawls\u2019 \u201cdifference principle\u201d may be the most\nfamiliar). Rawlsian theories are procedural in one sense: they regard\nany distribution as just if and only if it is consistent with the\ndistributive principles that would be chosen by those individuals.\nDisability-oriented criticism of these theories has focused on their\nassumptions about the individuals who are eligible to make a\nhypothetical contract or participate in the cooperative scheme it\nestablishes. Critics have argued for the eligibility of people with\ndisabilities or their representatives to participate in the\ncontract-making processes and resulting cooperative scheme more than\nabout the validity of the principles or rules yielded by that process\n(Richardson 2006; Silvers and Francis 2005; Stark 2007). The second\ntype of theory is primarily interested in outcomes; in the kind of end\nstate a just society should strive for: either equality on some\noutcome metric or the reduction of certain kinds of inequality. Here,\ndisability-informed criticism has favored outcome metrics that take\naccount of the social contribution to disability-related disadvantage,\nand standards for just distributions that are oriented toward\ndisrespectful inequalities (Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2006a; Wolff\n2009b).\n",
