From early on, the difficulties of developing a\nsystematic and general definition of privacy have been recognized. We\nstart with the most influential definition (at least since the\ntwentieth century): the definition of the concept given by Justices\nWarren and Brandeis (see\n \u00a71.2).\n Their conception of (the right to) privacy means rather generally the\n\u201cright to be left alone\u201d. Warren and Brandeis (1890: 214;\nfor the history of Warren and Brandeis\u2019 interest in privacy see\nProsser (1960)) also refer to \u201cthe dignity [\u2026] of the\nindividual\u201d in discussing the right to privacy, in that respect\nfor privacy is seen as acknowledging the dignity of persons, and their\nrespective personalities. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the\naim of their article was not to explicitly define privacy,\nbut rather to answer the question of \u201cwhether our law will\nrecognize and protect the right to privacy\u201d (1890: 196;\n\u201cour law\u201d refers to the US legal framework). This general\ndefinition of the concept of privacy, made in terms of respect for\npersonality, dignity, and \u201cbeing left alone\u201d, prepared the\nfield not only for detailed legal discussions, but also for efforts to\ndefine the term from a philosophical perspective.\n\nBoth of the semantic models mentioned above play a role in the\nfollowing definitions. From early on, the difficulties of developing a\nsystematic and general definition of privacy have been recognized. We\nstart with the most influential definition (at least since the\ntwentieth century): the definition of the concept given by Justices\nWarren and Brandeis (see\n \u00a71.2).\n Warren and Brandeis famously summarized this right to privacy as the\nright \u201cto be let alone\u201d (1890: 214; for the history of\nWarren and Brandeis\u2019 interest in privacy see Prosser 1960). They\nunderscore that\n\n\nthe intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing\ncivilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and\nman, under the defining influence of culture, has become more\nsensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more\nessential to the individual; but modern enterprises and invention\nhave, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain\nand distress, far greater than could be inflicted by mere bodily\ninjury. (Warren & Brandeis 1890: 196)\n\n\nAs the foundation of their conception of the right to privacy, Warren\nand Brandeis refer to \u201cthe dignity [\u2026] of the\nindividual\u201d or, as pointed out by Sax in his discussion of\nWarren and Brandeis,\n\n\nthe idea of the \u201cinviolate personality\u201d (Warren &\nBrandeis 1890: 205), or, put differently, \u201cthe more general\nright to the immunity of the person,\u2014the right to one\u2019s\npersonality\u201d (Warren & Brandeis 1890: 207). It is ultimately\nup to the individual to decide how she wants to be, think, and act.\n(Sax 2018: 149)\n\n\nIt should be mentioned that the aim of their article was not to\nexplicitly define privacy, but rather to answer the question\nof \u201cwhether our law will recognize and protect the right to\nprivacy\u201d (Warren & Brandeis 1890: 196; \u201cour law\u201d\nrefers to the US legal framework). This general definition of the\nconcept of privacy, made in terms of respect for personality, dignity,\nand \u201cbeing left alone\u201d, nevertheless prepared the field\nnot only for detailed legal discussions, but also for efforts to\ndefine the term from a philosophical perspective.\n\nThere have been various ways in which understanding the differences in\ndetermination of the meaning of privacy have been categorized. The two\nmost prominent are reductionism and coherentism, as\nhas been mentioned above. Reductionists are generally critical of the\neffort to carve out a special category of harms or interests best\nreferred to as unique privacy harms or interests. Coherentists,\nmeanwhile, defend the coherent fundamental value of privacy interests.\nIn contrast, Ferdinand Schoeman introduced a somewhat different\nterminology. According to Schoeman, a number of authors believe that\n\u201cthere is something common to most of the privacy claims\u201d\n(1984b: 5). Schoeman refers to this approach as the \u201ccoherence\nthesis\u201d. Positions which\n\n\ndeny both the coherence thesis and the distinctiveness thesis argue\nthat in each category of privacy claims there are diverse values at\nstake of the sort common to many other social issues and that these\nvalues exhaust privacy claims. [\u2026] The thrust of this complex\nposition is that we could do quite well if we eliminated all talk of\nprivacy and simply defended our concerns in terms of standard moral\nand legal categories. (Schoeman 1984b: 5)\n\n\nThese latter theorists are referred to as reductionists.\nJudith Thomson puts into question the idea that privacy is a distinct\nconcept altogether, insofar as she finds that there is no clear idea\nof what the right to privacy is. Instead, she suggests that\n\u201cthe right to privacy is itself a cluster of rights\u201d\n(1975: 306), such as the right to property or the right over the\nperson (see\n \u00a72.1).\n As has been mentioned in earlier sections, Thomson\u2019s\nreductionist view was dismissed by Thomas Scanlon. For Scanlon, realms\nof privacy are always \u201cconventionally defined\u201d,\nirreducible, and obtain in their own right; that is, they cannot be\nmarked out by means of other rights or claims. \u201cOur zone of\nprivacy,\u201d writes Scanlon,\n\n\ncould be defined in many different ways; what matters most is that\nsome system of limits to observation should be generally\nunderstood and observed. (1975: 317\u2013318)\n\n\nThe fact that such limits exist\u2014however varied they may turn out\nto be\u2014is for Scanlon an indication of the irreducibility of\nprivacy.\n\nNonetheless, the diversity of possible definitions and\ncharacterizations, as well as the many possible fields of application,\nhave continued to pose a challenge. While Scanlon\u2019s reply to\nThomson can be read as an attempt to find common ground for different\naspects of privacy (Scanlon 1975), Judith DeCew (1997) proposes to\nsystematize the concept of privacy by putting forward a \u201ccluster\naccount\u201d that highlights connections between the different\ninterests covered by the concept, without reducing privacy to these\ndifferent interests:\n\n\nI argue that privacy is best understood as a cluster concept covering\nmultiple privacy interests, including those enhancing control over\ninformation and our need for independence as well as those enhancing\nour ability to be self-expressible and to form social relationships.\n(DeCew 1997: 73)\n\n\nThere are other authors who have questioned the possibility of\ndeveloping a general, comprehensive definition of privacy. One of the\nmost innovative recent approaches to the meaning (and value) of\nprivacy is that of Helen Nissenbaum. She takes note of \u201cthe\nconceptual quagmire to claim a definition\u2014its\ndefinition\u2014of privacy\u201d (2010: 3) and proposes a different\napproach that renounces to the attempt of providing a single, unifying\ndefinition. For Nissenbaum, the right to privacy is best understood as\na \u201cright to appropriate flow of personal\ninformation\u201d (2010: 127). Generally, the appropriate flow of\npersonal information is governed by context-relative information\nnorms. These are characterized by four parameters, which are the\nspecific contexts, the actors, the information types, and\n(importantly) the transmission principles (see Nissenbaum 2010:\n140\u2013141). A transmission principle is a \u201cconstraint on the\nflow of information from party to party in a context.\u201d\n(Nissenbaum 2010: 145) What counts as being private information\ndepends on the different norms imposed on the flow of information\ngoverning different social contexts, such as the contexts of\neducation, religion, security, or politics (the \u201ccontextual\nintegrity\u201d of various contexts; Nissenbaum 2010: 127\u2013231).\nThe adequate transmission principle can, depending on the\ninformational norm, in some contexts (for instance intimate relations)\nbe understood as the control of access of the persons involved. In\nthat sense, Nissenbaum is not strictly arguing against Control-Access\napproaches, although she argues for their limited use in the general\nframework of informational privacy. Note that Nissenbaum writes about\ninformational privacy and does not discuss other dimensions of the\nconcept.\n\nFinally, one of the most widely discussed privacy theorists is Daniel\nSolove (2004, 2008, 2011). Solove famously observed that privacy is a\n\u201cconcept in disarray\u201d (2008: 1) and argues that it is\nfutile to look for a unified definition. Instead, he appeals to\nWittgenstein\u2019s idea of \u201cfamily resemblances\u201d, and\nproposes understanding privacy as consisting of \u201cmany different\nyet related things\u201d (2008: 9).\n\nIt can be concluded from the discussion presented here that in the\nprivacy literature, no clear definition has been made that everyone\ncan agree on. Neither is there a clear scope for privacy: in\nthe US, the conceptual and philosophical discussions regarding the\nmeaning and definition of \u201cprivacy\u201d are mostly framed in\nterms of legal discussions of privacy in the context of US\nconstitutional law. Following this reasoning, a number of theorists\ndefend the view that privacy has broad scope, inclusive of\nthe multiple varieties of privacy issue described by the US Supreme\nCourt, even though there is no simple definition of privacy see\nSchoemann (1992), Parent (1983), Henkin (1974), Thomson (1975),\nGavison (1980) and Bork (1990).\n",
