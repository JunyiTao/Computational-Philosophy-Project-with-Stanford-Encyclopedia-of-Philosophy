    "main_text": "The Book of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People\n9. The Book of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People\n\nSusman\u2019s response to the murder of millions of Jews and the\nannihilation of German and most of European Jewry belongs to the\nearliest attempts to comprehend the abyss of the catastrophe often, at\nleast since the 1980s, referred to as the Holocaust or Shoah. The\nBook of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People, published first\nin 1946 and in a second edition in 1948, with a preface addressing the\nfoundation of the State of Israel, is a meditation on the disastrous\nattempt at the extermination of the Jewish people. This catastrophic\nevent posed a radical challenge to the question of how to respond to\nthe project of philosophy. Along with the responses of Horkheimer,\nAdorno, Buber (whose Eclipse of God, published 1952 is a\nreply, as it were, to, Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of Reason,\npublished in 1947 and both intially given as lectures at Columbia\nUniversity), Levinas, and Sartre, Susman\u2019s intervention marks a\ndecisive turn in rethinking philosophy. As Susman notes in the\nconcluding pages of her book, the problem of the Shoah is not just a\nconcern for the Jews but is deeply connected to the problem of\nhumanity:\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of man, there is no solution to the Jewish problem\njust as there is no solution to the human problem; the Jewish problem\nis inseparably linked to the human problem, it is the problem of being\nhuman itself as it is posed in its ultimate depth. (1946 [1948:\n216])\n\n\nWorking through the \u201cJewish problem\u201d was not merely the\nresponsibility of the theologians, Susman\u2019s recourse to the Book\nof Job suggests, but was equally the task of philosophy, whose\nsoundness could only be proven by the way it lived up to the task of\nfacing its most radical challenge. Though Susman\u2019s reading of\nthe historical situation humanity faced in the wake of Auschwitz has\nrecourse to the biblical Book of Job, the study is in fact a\nmetaphysical meditation. While it is true that Susman does not shy\naway from the discourse of religion, the book\u2019s argument remains\nstaunchly non-theological. Susman actually follows the biblical text\nin its resolute criticism of all theological discourse. In her essay\non Kafka from 1929, Susman had already treated Job\u2019s as the\nparadigmatic experience for exploring the Jewish dimension of\nKafka\u2019s world. In this essay, she noted that\n\n\nJudaism\u2019s entire destiny of suffering in exile is prefigured in\nthe destiny of Job who God has surrendered in his suffering to the\nTempter. (\u201cThe Problem of Job in Kafka\u201d 35; GK 352; RPE\n58)\n\n\nCarefully navigating the exigencies of theology and philosophy, Susman\nrelies on the genre of the ancient wisdom literature instantiated by\nthe Book of Job to set her argument, an argument that grounds reason\nin the task of addressing the experience of suffering and loss of\nmeaning, making the realization of this task the linchpin of\nthought\u2019s veracity. The distinction between philosophy and\nJewish philosophy (with its attendant subordination of \u201cJewish\nPhilosophy\u201d, or articulation of the latter as a derivative\nsubdiscipline with no epistemological standing) is thus rejected as\nthe book\u2019s act of mourning the six million innocent victims of\nthe Shoah brings the metaphysical tensions such a distinction obscures\ninto the open. Operating between modern philosophy\u2019s turning a\nblind eye on the question of God and theology\u2019s no less\nproblematic appropriation of the name of God, Susman follows the Book\nof Job in its fundamental redefinition of the hermeneutic situation\nthrough a reversal of Job\u2019s perspective. Job\u2019s relentless\nquestioning of God does not lead to an answer; it eventually leads,\ninstead, to a change on the part of our understanding of God, who,\nassuming, in the eyes of Job, the role of querier, comes to pose the\nquestions Job is unable to answer. God reveals himself only by turning\nthe hermeneutic situation around and into a dialogical situation that\nthwarts discursive certainty and shows itself to be irreducible to the\nlanguage which deploys philosophical or theological concepts. That is,\nGod is revealed in a dialogical experience whose truth is realized in\nthe moment of the human recognition of the limit of understanding.\nMeaning itself is the result of this dialogical relationship, which\nsuggests our response to the latter is the ultimate task of human\nexistence.\n\nIf it is no longer possible to define God, then this is true for\nJewish people and non-Jewish people alike. The closure of this\npossibility corresponds, for Susman, to a closure of the possibility\nof defining humanity itself:\n\n\n[W]e have lost not just the image of the Jewish human being but also\nthe image of the human being in general; the name human being is today\nno less legible than the name of God. (1946 [1948: 151])\n\n\nThese losses and the unspeakable atrocities experienced during the\nShoah are entwined, and only an \u201cunlimited, indelible\nmourning\u201d, Susman tells us, can be the answer to what happened\nin the ovens of the concentration camps (1946 [1948: 208]). Susman\nwas, in fact, one of the earliest thinkers to formulate the injunction\nto never forget the atrocities committed by the German people. This\ninjunction to reset philosophy anew is later repeated by Adorno and\nFackenheim. Susman formulates it the following way:\n\n\nNothing of all that has been experienced by Jewish people on German\nterritory, from German hands, or guided by them must be forgotten;\nthis is the stern legacy of the victims to the survivors. (1946 [1948:\n208])\n\n\nRather than yielding a fixation on the past that would lead only to a\nform of victimization, Job\u2019s experience points the way to a\ntransformative turn, a change in comprehension ultimately irreducible\nto religiosity. At the bottom of this change of mind is a new reliance\non one\u2019s own understanding of reason, the result of the\ndialogical encounter with the unfathomable from which hope arises as a\nmessianic promise. It can arise precisely because messianic hope is\nnot bound to the past; it is dependent, instead, on the way we work\nthrough it. Job is not given any explanation for his suffering by God;\nit remains inexplicable, but he learns to recognize that the\nunfathomable only determines him through how he responds to it. He\nacknowledges that\n\n\nhis part is not to grasp and understand [das Begreifen] but\nto live out of the unfathomable [aus dem Unbegreiflichen].\n(1946 [1948: 178])\n\n\nThe challenge of the survivors of the Shoah is thus not only never to\nforget but to create new life in the face of this past. The messianic\nis not a speculative end of history but the vantage point here and now\nthat opens history up at any given point if we are prepared to reject\nthe conceptual blinkers of theological and teleological thinking. This\nis what gives the messianic its empowering force. The argument here\nhas a remarkable affinity with ideas articulated in Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s \u201cOn the Concept of History\u201d, a text\nwhich, though written in 1939/1940, reached its first readers initially\nhectographed in 1942 in a limited edition, and did not appear until\n1950 in print in German.\n",
