    "main_text": "The Nature and Purpose of Society\n7. The Nature and Purpose of Society\n\n\nIt is clear that Rosmini\u2019s view of rights in human society depends\nto a great extent on his views about the nature of society as such. In\nfact, his earliest work as a philosopher (1818\u20131826) was almost totally\ntaken up with a study of society, and was only abandoned when he saw\nthat his ideas would lack a solid foundation unless the problem of\nknowledge had first been confronted. Eventually (1837), he published\nhis ideas on society in The Philosophy of Politics in which he\ndeals with the principle according to which societies stand or fall,\nand the end to which societies are directed. . However, despite the\nuniversality of the principles examined in this work, their application\nis restricted to civil society. According to Rosmini, the first rule\nand criterion for governing any society whatsoever is this: That which\nconstitutes the existence or substance of a society is to be preserved\nand strengthened even at the cost of neglect to accidental refinement.\nThis is also the first rule of politics. It follows that the greatest\nerrors of government are those by which the government of a society,\nbecause of its excessive concern for the society\u2019s accidental progress,\nloses sight of that which constitutes the substance of the society. The\nsteps taken towards decline, that is, towards the substitution of\nessential matters by accidental, can be considered on four levels: the\nperiods of founders of societies and basic legislation; of genuine\ndevelopment; of external splendour; of frivolity. Beginning from the\nfirst stage, when attention is inevitably fixed on the nature itself of\na society, there is a gradual diminution of interest in underlying\nsocietal values until weakness, manifested in attention to frivolities\nand inability to concentrate on weightier matters, undermines the\nsociety\u2019s inner cohesion and its ability to withstand external inimical\npressures. This would explain the profound truth lying behind\nMachiavelli\u2019s observation: \u2018If a sect or republic is to survive\nfor any length of time, it must return frequently to its\nbeginning\u2019 (quoted in PP, vol. 1, 41)\n\n\nFor Rosmini, every society is simply the union of two or more people\nundertaken with the intention of obtaining a common advantage.\n\u2018All the persons in this union [forming a society] together have\nthe role of end, and the advantage expected from the association is\napplied equally to all (PP, vol. 2, 39). In other words, there\nmust be in every society a moral element, an element of justice, which\naffects the behaviour of the members towards one another, even if\ncollectively (as in Plato\u2019s case of a band of robbers) they are unjust\ntowards non-members. Hence the excellence of what Rosmini calls\n\u2018the social bond\u2019; where it is present and actuated, there is\nno injustice; injustice begins in its absence. In other words, the\nnature of society requires that those who form it, enjoy within it the\npersonal dignity of end. There is, therefore, a moral element inherent\nin every society. Using some persons, some members, as means, even for\nthe apparent good of the whole, is repugnant to the very nature of\nsociety. In a coherent universal society, such as that described by\nCicero\u2014\u2018This entire world is to be considered simply as a city\ncommon to both gods and human beings\u2019 (quoted in PP, vol.\n2, 49)\u2014there will inevitably be a tendency to maximum justice. This\nmeans, however, that no one in any society can make one person\nsubservient to another. All that is pertinent only to nature can be\nused as means; all that which is proper to person, or to which persons\nhave extended themselves so that some thing or things have become\nproper to them, must be respected as end. Here again, though, a\ndistinction must be made between that is proper to a member of a\nsociety as a person, and the modality of that which is proper. In\ncertain cases, the government of a society may change the modality of\nwhat is proper if this is for the common good. A piece of land required\nfor a road may, for instance, be substituted with an adequate sum of\nmoney. But those things which have no modality, such as innocent life,\ncannot be violated under the pretext of common good. It is clear that\nthese principles must direct the government of every society.\n\n\nRosmini also deals with the nature of the good which is the aim or\nend of society. For him, this good is human good which \u2018resides in\nvirtue and the eudemonological appurtenances of virtue, and in general\nin every good in so far as it is connected with virtue.\u2019 He\nconcludes, therefore, that every society, in so far as it is contrary\nto virtue, is illegitimate because its aim is contrary to the essence\nof society. At the same time, every law of society is invalid if, or in\nso far as, it prevents members from achieving virtue. \u2018Without\nvirtue there is no human good, the end for which society is\nestablished\u2019 (PP, vol. 2, 189). But while anti-virtue is\nessentially detrimental to the good of any society, virtue of itself is\nnot the only element forming the good in question. Contentment of\nspirit, that is, of the whole person, as distinct from passing pleasure\nconfined to parts of human nature, is also included in every society\u2019s\nessential aim. Anything, therefore, opposed to contentment is\ninevitably detrimental to society, whatever favour it may have found in\npublic opinion. Rosmini finds support for this affirmation in Hamilton,\nwhom he quotes approvingly (PP, vol. 2, 195).\nWhen occasions present themselves in which the interests of\nthe people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of\nthe persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those\ninterests to withstand the temporary delusion in order to give them\ntime and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.\n\n\nPublic opinion, it would seem, is not an infallible criterion of\npublic good.\n",
