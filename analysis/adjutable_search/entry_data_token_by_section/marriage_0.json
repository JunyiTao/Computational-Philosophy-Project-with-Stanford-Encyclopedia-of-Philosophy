    "main_text": "Defining Marriage\n1. Defining Marriage\n\n\u2018Marriage\u2019 can refer to a legal contract and civil status,\na religious rite, and a social practice, all of which vary by legal\njurisdiction, religious doctrine, and culture. History shows\nconsiderable variation in marital practices: polygyny has been widely\npracticed, some societies have approved of extra-marital sex and,\narguably, recognized same-sex marriages, and religious or civil\nofficiation has not always been the norm (Boswell 1994; Mohr 2005, 62;\nCoontz 2006). More fundamentally, while the contemporary Western ideal\nof marriage involves a relationship of love, friendship, or\ncompanionship, marriage historically functioned primarily as an\neconomic and political unit used to create kinship bonds, control\ninheritance, and share resources and labor. Indeed, some ancients and\nmedievals discouraged \u2018excessive\u2019 love in marriage. The\nWestern \u2018love revolution\u2019 in marriage dates popularly to\nthe 18th century (Coontz 2006, Part 3). The understanding\nof marriage as grounded in individual choice and romantic love\nreflects historically and culturally situated beliefs and practices.\nMost notably, the aspect of consent or voluntary entry - often taken\nto be crucial to marriage (Cott 2000) - is challenged where practices\nof forced or child marriage are prevalent (Narayan 1997; Bhandary\n2018). Arranged marriage, which is compatible with the consent of the\nspouses, prioritizes caregiving and economic aspects of the\ninstitution over romantic love (Bhandary 2018).\n\nThe global variety of marriage practices and law is difficult to\nencapsulate: notable variations in law include recognition of same-sex\nmarriage, polygamy, and \u2018common-law\u2019 marriage,\nrestrictions on marriages between members of the same family or of\ndifferent social castes, the existence of civil marriage, practices of\narranged, forced, or child marriage, and women\u2019s rights within\nmarriage (see Moses 2018 for an entry into the literature on these\ndifferences), as well as cultural and religious practices of temporary\nmarriage (Shrage 2013, Nolan 2016) or polyamorous marriage (Brake\n2018). Religious, cultural, and philosophical traditions also shape\nideals of marriage. For instance, Xiaorong Li writes that\n\u201cConfucian ideals of family, society, and women\u2019s\nrole\u201d influence expectations of marriage in China (Li 1995,\n413). However, scholarship on such differences must be careful to\navoid misrepresentation (see for example discussion of misleading\nWestern accounts of \u2018sati\u2019 and dowry-murder in India in\nNarayan 1997).\n\nEthical and political questions regarding marriage are sometimes\nanswered by appeal to the definition of marriage. But the historical\nand cultural variation in marital practices has prompted some\nphilosophers to argue that marriage is a \u2018family\nresemblance\u2019 concept, with no essential purpose or structure\n(Wasserstrom 1974; see also the interesting discussion of whether the\nmany different practices identified by anthropologists as marriage\nshould be counted as marriages in Nolan, forthcoming). If marriage has\nno essential features, then one cannot appeal to definition to justify\nparticular legal or moral obligations. For instance, if monogamy is\nnot an essential feature of marriage, then one cannot appeal to the\ndefinition of marriage to justify a requirement that legal marriage be\nmonogamous. To a certain extent, the point that actual legal or social\ndefinitions cannot settle the question of what features marriage\nshould have is just. First, past applications of a term need not yield\nnecessary and sufficient criteria for applying it:\n\u2018marriage\u2019 (like \u2018citizen\u2019) may be extended to\nnew cases without thereby changing its meaning (Mercier 2001). Second,\nappeal to definition may be uninformative: for example, legal\ndefinitions are sometimes circular, defining marriage in terms of\nspouses and spouses in terms of marriage (Mohr 2005, 57). Third,\nappeal to an existing definition in the context of debate over what\nthe law of marriage, or its moral obligations, should be risks begging\nthe question: in debate over same-sex marriage, for example, appeal to\nthe current legal definition begs the normative question of what the\nlaw should be. However, this point also tells against the argument for\nthe family resemblance view of marriage, as the variation of marital\nforms in practice does not preclude the existence of a normatively\nideal form. Thus, philosophers who defend an essentialist definition\nof marriage offer normative definitions, which appeal to fundamental\nethical or political principles. Defining marriage must depend on,\nrather than precede, ethical and political inquiry.\n",
