    "main_text": "Variants of dependence logic || Propositional Dependence Logic\n4.6 Propositional Dependence Logic\n\nThe dependence and independence atoms considered so far express\nrelationships between the possible values of variables in a\nset of assignments. However, the same notions of dependence and\nindependence can be equally naturally be applied to proposition\nthemselves, as it happens in natural language expression such as for\ninstance \u201cWhether he will or will not pass the course depends\nonly on the content of his final exam\u201d.\n\nPropositional Dependence Logic consider such atoms within the context\nof propositional logic. Propositional dependence logic teams are sets\nof valuations \\(v\\) from propositional atoms \\(p_1 \\ldots\np_n\\) to \\(\\{T, F\\}\\). Its semantic rules \u2013 and their\njustifications \u2013 mirror very closely the ones of first order\nteam semantics, and the rule for dependence atoms is\n\n\nPTS-dep:\n\n\\(X \\models \\eqord(p_1 \\ldots p_n, q)\\) if and only if any two\nvaluations \\(v_1, v_2 \\in X\\) which agree on the values of \\(p_1\n\\ldots p_n\\) also agree on the value of \\(q\\).\n\n\nMany of the variants and generalizations of first order dependence\nlogic can be lowered to the propositional level without any\ndifficulty: thus, for example, it is possible to study the properties\nof propositional inclusion logic, propositional team logic,\npropositional intuitionistic dependence logic and so on.\n\nWhereas (first order) dependence logic is strictly more expressive\nthan first order logic, propositional dependence logic is not more\nexpressive than propositional logic, as it follows immediately from\nthe fact that all propositional functions are expressible in\npropositional logic. There exists, however, a close relation between\nthe teams of propositional dependence logic and the information\nstates of inquisitive logic (Groenendijk 2009; Ciardelli\n& Roelofsen 2011), a semantic framework for the study of the\nnotion of meaning and information exchange: in particular, the\nimplication of inquisitive logic is exactly the same as the one of\npropositional intuitionistic dependence logic.\n\nAxiomatizations for propositional dependence logic and many of its\nextensions can be found in (Yang & V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2016);\nand the analysis of the computational complexity of this formalism\n(and of related propositional logics based on Team Semantics) can be\nfound in (Virtema 2017; Hannula et al. 2018).\n",
