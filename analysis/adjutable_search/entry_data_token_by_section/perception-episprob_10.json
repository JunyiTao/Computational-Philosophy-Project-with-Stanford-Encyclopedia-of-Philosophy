    "main_text": "Epistemological Solutions || World-involving Approaches\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe epistemological problems of perception have traditionally centered\non the threat of skepticism, in particular, on the \u201cveil of\nperception\u201d implicated by a well-known metaphysics of\nperception, which threatens to lead to skepticism. Although much of\nthe history of philosophy has involved attempts to find metaphysical\nsolutions to this problem, recent decades have seen a proliferation of\ndedicatedly epistemological theories, offering more direct responses\nto these concerns. Even if we have a metaphysics in place, we will\nstill need to make difficult decisions about the epistemology. Various\nevidential, etiological, and direct world-involvement theories have\nbeen proposed, including combinations of these. Each of these three\nadmits of internalist as well as externalist variants. The result is\nan active and ongoing area of research in epistemology.\n",
