    "main_text": "Models of metaphysical explanation || Metaphysical Explanation as nomological explanation\n6.2 Metaphysical Explanation as nomological explanation\n\nSome have argued that metaphysical explanation ought to be understood\nas a species of the kind deductive-nomological explanation. On this\nview (see Hempel & Oppenheim 1948 and Hempel 1965) (scientific)\nexplanations are sound deductive arguments, featuring the following\ningredients (see\n scientific explanation, \u00a72):\n\nAn initial condition: An event of type F\nobtains.\nA law statement: For all events, if an event of type\nF obtains, then an event of type G obtains.\nA conclusion: An event of type G obtains.\n\n\nThis way of understanding the nature of (scientific) explanation does\nnot mention causation and is compatible with a Humean understanding of\nlaws of nature, for example one that takes laws of nature to be truths\nthat belong to any deductive system that best balances simplicity and\nfit with the facts. In this sense, understanding explanation in\ndeductive-nomological terms can easily be combined with an antirealism\nabout such explanations, if the notions of best balance, simplicity,\nand/or fit with the facts are understood partly in terms of how we\nthink or communicate (see\n \u00a75).\n Or the account can be understood as realist in nature, if, for\nexample, one\u2019s preferred account of the nature of laws of nature\nis in turn realist (those proposed by Armstrong 1983, Dretske 1977,\nand Tooley 1977 being one example).\n\nMost of those who have argued that metaphysical explanation is\ndeductive-nomological have tended to defend a comparatively\n\u201cheavyweight\u201d account of the (metaphysical) laws that\nmetaphysical explanations involve, and so have opted for a realist\nseparatist version of the account. Laws, on this view, are understood\nas something more or other than the Humean regularities they entail,\nand in at least some cases involve or reduce to facts about an\nunderlying \u201cconstruction\u201d relation or essence (e.g.,\nGlazier 2016; Kment 2014; Wilsch 2015). For more on the nature of\n\u201claws of metaphysics\u201d, see, e.g., Sider (2011: sect. 12.4)\nand Rosen (2006; 2017). For a comparatively speaking less heavyweight\naccount of the nature of the laws that feature in metaphysical\nexplanation\u2014one according to which such laws are nothing but\n\u201ccounterfactual-supporting general principles\u201d and\ntherefore \u201cinclusive\u201d in the sense of being neither\nnecessarily fundamental nor necessarily exceptionless\u2014see\nSchaffer (2017). See also Woodward and Hitchcock (2003).\n\nAdopting a more heavyweight account of the nature of metaphysical\nlaws, and hence of metaphysical explanation, may come with a\nmetaphysical cost\u2014for instance, if one takes them to be\nontologically basic entities, or if one takes the distinction between\nlaws and non-laws to be a primitive one. According to proponents of\nsuch an account, this is a price worth paying. One important reason\nwhy the traditional deductive-nomological account of (scientific)\nexplanation has few proponents today was that the symmetry of\ndeductive entailment in certain cases seemed to interfere with our\nintuitions about the asymmetry of explanation (e.g., Lehrer 1974, who\ngets the example from Bromberger\u2019s (1966) famous flagpole/shadow\nexample, see also the entry\n scientific explanation \u00a72.5).\n If the laws that explanation invokes involve or even reduce to\nsomething which has direction (from more to less fundamental) already\nbuilt in, this problem is entirely avoided. Of course, if the account\nis to be able to also cover metaphysical explanation in the sense of\nessentialist explanation (see\n \u00a72\n above), the fact that the laws have direction already built in could\nbe considered a flaw rather than an advantage.\n\nFinally, if metaphysical explanation is deductive-nomological (or\n\u201ccovering law\u201d), it seems that there is no room for\nexplanations of rare or one-off phenomena in terms of the mechanisms\nthat ground (or cause) them, even in cases where, had a similar\nmechanism occurred, it need not have given rise to a similar\nphenomenon (e.g., Taylor 2016). According to Trogdon (2018; see also\nAnscombe 1971), it seems likely that some explanations are\none-off in this sense, from which it would seem to follow that, even\nif some or most metaphysical explanations turn out to be deductive\nnomological, this cannot be true of all of them. For an argument\nagainst this conclusion\u2014on the grounds that laws of metaphysics\ncan be indeterministic and that (like indeterministic laws of nature)\nthey can hence help explain rare events\u2014see Wasserman\n(2017).\n",
