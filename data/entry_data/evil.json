The first is\nconcerned with some preliminary distinctions; the second, with the\nchoice between deductive versions of the argument from evil, and\nevidential versions; the third, with alternative evidential\nformulations of the argument from evil; the fourth, with the\ndistinction between three very different types of responses to the\nargument from evil: attempted total refutations, defenses, and\ntheodicies. The fifth section then focuses upon attempted total\nrefutations, while the sixth is concerned with defenses, and the\nseventh with some traditional theodicies. The possibility of more\nmodest variants on defenses and theodicies, based on the idea of\nglobal properties, is then considered in section eight.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Some Important Distinctions\n1.1 Relevant Concepts of God\n\nThe term \u201cGod\u201d is used with a wide variety of different\nmeanings.  These tend to fall, however, into two main groups. On the\none hand, there are metaphysical interpretations of the term: God is\na prime mover, or a first cause, or a necessary being that has its\nnecessity of itself, or the ground of being, or a being whose essence\nis identical with its existence. Or God is not one being among other\nbeings\u2014even a supremely great being\u2014but, instead, being\nitself. Or God is an ultimate reality to which no concepts truly\napply.\n\nOn the other hand, there are interpretations that connect the term\n\u201cGod\u201d in a clear and relatively straightforward way with\nreligious attitudes, such as those of worship, and with very important\nhuman desires, such as the desires that good will triumph, that\njustice be done, and that the world not be one where death marks the\nend of the individual\u2019s existence.\n\nWhat properties must something have if it is to be an appropriate\nobject of worship, and if it is to provide reason for thinking that\nthere is a reasonable chance that the fundamental human desires just\nmentioned will be fulfilled? A natural answer is that God must be a\nperson who, at the very least, is very powerful, very knowledgeable,\nand morally very good. But if such a being exists, then it seems\ninitially puzzling why various evils exist. For many of the very\nundesirable states of affairs that the world contains are such as\ncould be eliminated, or prevented, by a being who was only moderately\npowerful, while, given that humans are aware of such evils, a being\nonly as knowledgeable as humans would be aware of their\nexistence. Finally, even a moderately good human being, given the\npower to do so, would eliminate those evils.  Why, then, do such\nundesirable states of affairs exist, if there is a being who is very\npowerful, very knowledgeable, and very good?\n\nWhat one has here, however, is not just a puzzle, since the question\ncan, of course, be recast as an argument for the non-existence of\nGod.  Thus if, for simplicity, we focus on a conception of God as\nall-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good, one very concise way\nof formulating such an argument is as follows:\n\nIf God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally\nperfect.\nIf God is omnipotent, then God has the power to eliminate all\nevil.\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows when evil exists.\nIf God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate\nall evil.\nEvil exists.\nIf evil exists and God exists, then either God doesn\u2019t have the\npower to eliminate all evil, or doesn\u2019t know when evil exists, or\ndoesn\u2019t have the desire to eliminate all evil.\nTherefore, God doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nThat this argument is valid is perhaps most easily seen by a\nreductio argument, in which one assumes that the \nconclusion\u2014(7)\u2014is false, and then shows that the denial of (7),\nalong with premises (1) through (6), leads to a contradiction.  Thus\nif, contrary to (7), God exists, it follows from (1) that God is\nomnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect.  This, together with (2),\n(3), and (4) then entails that God has the power to eliminate all\nevil, that God knows when evil exists, and that God has the desire to\neliminate all evil.  But when (5) is conjoined with the reductio\nassumption that God exists, it then follows via modus ponens from (6)\nthat either God doesn\u2019t have the power to eliminate all evil, or\ndoesn\u2019t know when evil exists, or doesn\u2019t have the desire to eliminate\nall evil.  Thus we have a contradiction, and so premises (1) through\n(6) do validly imply (7).\n\nWhether the argument is sound is, of course, a further question, for\nit may be that one or more of the premises is false.  The point here,\nhowever, is simply that when one conceives of God as unlimited with\nrespect to power, knowledge, and moral goodness, the existence of\nevil quickly gives rise to potentially serious arguments against the\nexistence of God.\n\nIs the situation different if one shifts to a deity who is not\nomnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect?  The answer depends on\nthe details.  Thus, if one considers a deity who is omniscient and\nmorally perfect, but not omnipotent, then evil presumably would not\npose a problem if such a deity were conceived of as too remote from\nEarth to prevent the evils we find here.  But given a deity who falls\nconsiderably short of omnipotence, omniscience, and moral perfection,\nbut who could intervene in our world to prevent many evils, and who\nknows of those evils, it would seem that an argument rather similar\nto the above could be formulated by focusing not on the mere\nexistence of evil, but upon the existence of evils that such a deity\ncould have prevented.\n\nBut what if God, rather than being characterized in terms of\nknowledge, power, and goodness, is defined in some more metaphysical\nway\u2014for example, as the ground of being, or as being itself?  The\nanswer will depend on whether, having defined God in such purely\nmetaphysical terms, one can go on to argue that such an entity will\nalso possess at least very great power, knowledge, and moral\ngoodness.  If so, evil is once again a problem.\n\nBy contrast, if God is conceived of in a purely metaphysical way,\nand if no connection can be forged between the relevant metaphysical\nproperties and the possession of significant power, knowledge, and\ngoodness, then the problem of evil is irrelevant.  But when that is\nthe case, it would seem that God thereby ceases to be a being who is\neither an appropriate object of religious attitudes, or a ground for\nbelieving that fundamental human hopes are not in vain.\n1.2 Incompatibility Formulations versus Inductive Formulations\n\n\nThe argument from evil focuses upon the fact that the world appears\nto contain states of affairs that are bad, or undesirable, or that\nshould have been prevented by any being that could have done so, and\nit asks how the existence of such states of affairs is to be squared\nwith the existence of God.  But the argument can be formulated in two\nvery different ways.  First, it can be formulated as a purely\ndeductive argument that attempts to show that there are certain facts\nabout the evil in the world that are logically incompatible with the\nexistence of God.  One especially ambitious form of this first sort\nof argument attempts to establish the very strong claim that it is\nlogically impossible for it to be the case both that there is any\nevil at all, and that God exists.  The argument set out in the\npreceding section is just such an argument.\n\nAlternatively, rather than being formulated as a deductive argument\nfor the very strong claim that it is logically impossible for both\nGod and evil to exist, (or for God and certain types, or instances,\nor a certain amount of evil to exist), the argument from evil can\ninstead be formulated as an evidential (or inductive/probabilistic)\nargument for the more modest claim that there are evils that actually\nexist in the world that make it unlikely\u2014or perhaps very \nunlikely\u2014that God exists.\n\nThe choice between incompatibility formulations and evidential\nformulations is discussed below, in section 2.\n1.3 Abstract Versus Concrete Formulations\n\n\nAny version of the argument from evil claims that there is some fact\nconcerning the evil in the world such that the existence of \nGod\u2014understood as at least a very powerful, very knowledgeable, and\nmorally very good person, and, ideally, as an omnipotent, omniscient,\nand morally perfect person\u2014is either logically precluded, or\nrendered unlikely, by that fact.  But versions of the argument often\ndiffer quite significantly with respect to what the relevant fact is.\nSometimes, as in premise (5) in the argument set out above, the\nappeal is to the mere existence of any evil whatever.  Sometimes, on\nthe other hand, it is to the existence of a certain amount of evil.\nAnd sometimes it is to the existence of evils of a certain specified\nsort.\n\nTo formulate the argument from evil in terms of the mere existence\nof any evil at all is to abstract to the greatest extent possible\nfrom detailed information about the evils that are found in the\nworld, and so one is assuming, in effect, that such information\ncannot be crucial for the argument.  But is it clear that this is\nright?  For might one not feel that while the world would be better\noff without the vast majority of evils, this is not so for absolutely\nall evils?  Thus some would argue, for example, that the frustration\nthat one experiences in trying to solve a difficult problem is\noutweighed by the satisfaction of arriving at a solution, and\ntherefore that the world is a better place because it contains such\nevils.  Alternatively, it has been argued that the world is a better\nplace if people develop desirable traits of character\u2014such as\npatience, and courage\u2014by struggling against obstacles, including\nsuffering.  But if either of these things is the case, then the\nprevention of all evil might well make the world a worse place.\n\nIt seems possible, then, that there might be evils that are\nlogically necessary for goods that outweigh them, and this possibility\nprovides a reason, accordingly, for questioning one of the premises\nin the argument set out earlier\u2014namely, premise (4), where it is\nclaimed that if God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to\neliminate all evil.\n\nBut there is also another reason why that claim is problematic,\nwhich arises out of a particular conception of free will\u2014namely, a\nlibertarian conception.  According to this view of free will, and in\ncontrast with what are known as compatibilist approaches, free will\nis incompatible with determinism, and so it is impossible even for an\nomnipotent being to make it the case that someone freely chooses to\ndo what is right.\n\nMany people claim, however, that the world is a better place if it\ncontains individuals who possess libertarian free will, rather than\nindividuals who are free only in a sense that is compatible with\none\u2019s actions being completely determined. If this claim can be made\nplausible, one can argue, first, that God would have a good reason\nfor creating a world with individuals who possessed libertarian free\nwill, but secondly, that if he did choose to create such a world,\neven he could not ensure that no one would ever choose to do\nsomething morally wrong.  The good of libertarian free will requires,\nin short, the possibility of moral evil.\n\nNeither of these lines of argument is immune from challenge.  As\nregards the former, one can argue that the examples that are\ntypically advanced of cases where some evil is logically necessary\nfor a greater good that outweighs the evil are not really, upon close\nexamination, convincing, while, as regards the latter, there is a\nserious problem of making sense of libertarian free will, for\nalthough there is no difficulty about the idea of actions that are\nnot causally determined, libertarian free will requires more than the\nmere absence of determinism, and the difficulty arises when one\nattempts to say what that something more is.\n\nBut although these challenges are important, and may very well turn\nout to be right, it is fair to say, first, that it has not yet been\nestablished that there is no coherent conception of libertarian free\nwill, and, secondly, that it is, at least, very doubtful that one can\nestablish that there cannot be cases where some evil is logically\nnecessary for a greater good that outweighs it without appealing to\nsome substantive, and probably controversial, moral theory.\n\nThe upshot is that the idea that either the actuality of certain\nundesirable states of affairs, or at least the possibility, may be\nlogically necessary for goods that outweigh them, is not without some\ninitial plausibility, and if some such claim can be sustained, it\nwill follow immediately that the mere existence of evil cannot be\nincompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and\nmorally perfect being.\n\nHow does this bear upon evidential formulations of the argument from\nevil?  The answer would seem to be that if there can be evils that are\nlogically necessary for goods that outweigh them, then it is hard to\nsee how the mere existence of evil\u2014in the absence of further\ninformation\u2014can provide much in the way of evidence against\nthe existence of God.\n\nWhat if one shifts to a slightly less abstract formulation of the\nargument from evil that is based upon the premise that the world\ncontains a certain amount of evil, or upon the premise that the world\ncontains at least some natural evil?  Then one is including marginally\nmore information.  But one is still assuming, in effect, that most of\nthe detailed information about the evils found in the world is\ncompletely irrelevant to the argument from evil, and a little\nreflection brings out how very implausible this assumption is.  So,\nfor example, consider a world that contains a billion units of natural\nevil.  Is this a good starting point for an argument from evil? The\nanswer is that, if either a deontological approach to ethics is\ncorrect, or a form of consequentialism that takes the distribution of\ngoods and evils into account, rather than, say, simply the total\namount of goods and evils, whether this fact is an impressive reason\nfor questioning the existence of God surely depends on further details\nabout the world. If those billion units are uniformly distributed over\ntrillions of people whose lives are otherwise extremely satisfying and\necstatically happy, it is not easy to see a serious problem of evil.\nBut if, on the other hand, the billion units of natural evil fell upon\na single innocent person, and produced a life that was, throughout,\none of extraordinarily intense pain, then surely there would be a very\nserious problem of evil.\n\nDetails concerning such things as how suffering and other evils are\ndistributed over individuals, and the nature of those who undergo the\nevils, are, then, of crucial importance.  Thus it is relevant, for\nexample, that many innocent children suffer agonizing deaths.  It is\nrelevant that animals suffer, and that they did so before there were\nany persons to observe their suffering, and to feel sympathy for\nthem.  It is also relevant that, on the one hand, the suffering that\npeople undergo apparently bears no relation to the moral quality of\ntheir lives, and, on the other, that it bears a very clear relation\nto the wealth and medical knowledge of the societies in which they\nlive.\n\nThe prospects for a successful abstract version of the argument from\nevil would seem, therefore, rather problematic.  It is conceivable,\nof course, that the correct moral principles entail that there cannot\nbe any evils whose actuality or possibility makes for a better world.\nBut to attempt to set out a version of the argument from evil that\nrequires a defense of that thesis is certainly to swim upstream.  A\nmuch more promising approach, surely, is to focus, instead, simply\nupon those evils that are thought, by the vast majority of people, to\npose at least a prima facie problem for the rationality of belief in\nan omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person.\n\nGiven that the preceding observations are rather obvious ones, one\nmight have expected that discussions of the argument from evil would\nhave centered mainly upon concrete formulations of the\nargument. Rather surprisingly, that has not been so. Indeed, some\nauthors seem to focus almost exclusively upon very abstract versions\nof the argument.\n\nOne of the more striking illustrations of this phenomenon is\nprovided by Alvin Plantinga\u2019s discussions of the problem of evil. In\nGod and Other Minds, in The Nature of Necessity,\nand in God, Freedom, and Evil, for example, Plantinga,\nstarting out from an examination of John L. Mackie\u2019s essay \u201cEvil\nand Omnipotence\u201d (1955), in which Mackie had defended an\nincompatibility version of the argument from evil, focuses mainly on\nthe question of whether the existence of God is compatible with the\nexistence of evil, although there are also short discussions of\nwhether the existence of God is compatible with the existence of a\ngiven quantity of evil, and of whether the existence of a certain\namount of evil renders the existence of God unlikely.  (The latter\ntopic is then the total focus of attention in his long article,\n\u201cThe Probabilistic Argument from Evil\u201d.)\n\nThat Plantinga initially focused upon abstract formulations of the\nargument from evil was not, perhaps, surprising, given that a number\nof writers\u2014including Mackie, H. J. McCloskey (1960), and\nH. D. Aiken (1957\u201358)\u2014had defended incompatibility versions of\nthe argument from evil, and it is natural to formulate such arguments\nin an abstract way, since although one may wish to distinguish, for\nexample, between natural evils and moral evils, reference to concrete\ncases of evil would not seem to add anything.  But once one shifts to\nprobabilistic formulations of the argument from evil, the situation is\nvery different: details about concrete cases of evil may be\nevidentially crucial.\n\nThe problem, then, is that Plantinga not only started out by focusing\non very abstract versions of the argument from evil, but also\nmaintained this focus throughout.  The explanation of this may lie in\nthe fact that Plantinga seems to have believed that if it can be shown\nthat the existence of God is neither incompatible with, nor rendered\nimprobable by, either (1) the mere existence of evil, or (2) the\nexistence of a specified amount of evil, then no philosophical problem\nremains. People may find, of course, that they are still troubled by\nthe existence of specific evils, but this, Plantinga seems to be\nbelieve, is a religious problem, and what is called for, he suggests,\nis not philosophical argument, but \u201cpastoral\ncare\u201d (1974a,\n63\u20134).[1]\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s view here, however, is very implausible. For not only can\nthe argument from evil be formulated in terms of specific evils, but\nthat is the natural way to do so, given that it is only certain types\nof evils that are generally viewed as raising a serious problem with\nrespect to the rationality of belief in God. To concentrate\nexclusively on abstract versions of the argument from evil is\ntherefore to ignore the most plausible and challenging versions of the\nargument.\n1.4 Axiological Versus Deontological Formulations\n\nConsider, now, the following formulation of the argument from evil,\nwhich, in contrast to the abstract version of the argument from evil\nset out in section 1.1, focuses on quite concrete types of evil: \n\nThere exist states of affairs in which animals die agonizing\ndeaths in forest fires, or where children undergo lingering suffering\nand eventual death due to cancer, and that (a) are intrinsically bad\nor undesirable, and (b) are such that any omnipotent person has the\npower to prevent them without thereby either allowing an equal or\ngreater evil, or preventing an equal or greater good.\nFor any state of affairs (that is actual), the existence of that\nstate of affairs is not prevented by anyone.\nFor any state of affairs, and any person, if the state of affairs\nis intrinsically bad, and the person has the power to prevent that\nstate of affairs without thereby either allowing an equal or greater\nevil, or preventing an equal or greater good, but does not do so,\nthen that person is not both omniscient and morally perfect.\n\n\nTherefore, from (1), (2), and (3):\n\nThere is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect\nperson.\nIf God exists, then he is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally\nperfect person.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\nGod does not exist.\n\n \nAs it stands, this argument is deductively\nvalid.[2]\n(Here is a \nproof.)\nHowever it is likely to be challenged in various ways. In\nparticular, one vulnerable point is the claim, made in the last part\nof statement (1), that an omnipotent and omniscient person could have\nprevented those states of affairs without thereby either allowing an\nequal or greater evil, or preventing an equal or greater good, and\nwhen this is challenged, an inductive step will presumably be\nintroduced, one that moves from what we know about the undesirable\nstates of affairs in question to a conclusion about the overall value\nof those states of affairs, all things considered\u2014including things\nthat may well lie outside our ken. \n\nBut the above argument is subject to a very different sort of\ncriticism, one that is connected with a feature of the above argument\nwhich seems to me important, but which is not often commented \nupon\u2014the fact, namely, that the above argument is formulated in terms of\naxiological concepts, that is, in terms of the goodness or\nbadness, the desirability or undesirability, of states of\naffairs. The criticism that arises from this feature centers on\nstatement (3), which asserts that an omniscient and morally perfect\nbeing would prevent the existence of any states of affairs that are\nintrinsically bad or undesirable, and whose prevention he could\nachieve without either allowing an equal or greater evil, or\npreventing an equal or greater good. For one can ask how this claim\nis to be justified.  One answer that might be offered would be that\nsome form of consequentialism is true\u2014such as, for example, the\nview that an action that fails to maximize the balance of good states\nof affairs over bad states of affairs is morally wrong. But the\ndifficulty then is that any such assumption is likely to be a deeply\ncontroversial assumption that many theists would certainly\nreject.\n\nThe problem, in short, is that any axiological formulation of the\nargument from evil, as it stands, is incomplete in a crucial respect,\nsince it fails to make explicit how a failure to bring about\ngood states of affairs, or a failure to prevent bad states of affairs,\nentails that one is acting in a morally wrong way. Moreover, the\nnatural way of removing this incompleteness is by appealing to what\nare in fact controversial ethical claims, such as the claim that the\nright action is the one that maximizes expected value. The result, in\nturn, is that discussions may very well become sidetracked on issues\nthat are, in fact, not really crucial\u2014such as, for example, the\nquestion of whether God would be morally blameworthy if he failed to\ncreate the best world that he could.\n\nThe alternative to an axiological formulation is a deontological\nformulation.  Here the idea is that rather than employing concepts\nthat focus upon the value or disvalue of states of affairs, one\ninstead uses concepts that focus upon the rightness and wrongness of\nactions, and upon the properties\u2014rightmaking properties and\nwrongmaking properties\u2014that determine whether an action is one\nthat ought to be performed, or ought not to be performed, other\nthings being equal. When the argument is thus formulated, there is no\nproblematic bridge that needs to be introduced connecting the\ngoodness and badness of states of affairs with the rightness and\nwrongness of actions.\n2. The Choice between Incompatibility Formulations and Evidential Formulations\n\nHow is the argument from evil best formulated?  As an\nincompatibility argument, or as an evidential argument?  In section\n1.1, an incompatibility formulation of a very abstract sort was set\nout, which appealed to the mere fact that the world contains at least\nsome evil.  That formulation involved the following crucial\npremise:\n\nIf God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate\nall evil.\n\n \nThe problem with that premise, as we saw, is that it can be argued\nthat some evils are such that their actuality, or at least their\npossibility, is logically necessary for goods that outweigh them, in\nwhich case it is not true that a perfectly good being would want to\neliminate such evils.\n \nIn section 1.4, a much more concrete version of an incompatibility\nargument was set out, which, rather than appealing to the mere\nexistence of some evil or other, appealed to specific types of \nevil\u2014in particular, situations where animals die agonizing deaths in\nforest fires, or where children undergo lingering suffering and\neventual death due to cancer.  The thrust of the argument was then\nthat, first of all, an omniscient and omnipotent person could have\nprevented the existence of such evils without thereby either allowing\nequal or greater evils, or preventing equal or greater goods, and,\nsecondly, that any omniscient and morally perfect person will prevent\nthe existence of such evils if that can be done without either\nallowing equal or greater evils, or preventing equal or greater\ngoods.\n \nThe second of these claims avoids the objections that can be\ndirected against the stronger claim that was involved in the argument\nset out in section 1.1\u2014that is, the claim that if God is morally\nperfect, then God has the desire to eliminate all evil.  But the\nshift to the more modest claim requires that one move from the very\nmodest claim that evil exists to the stronger claim that there are\ncertain evils that an omniscient and omnipotent person could have\nprevented the existence of such evils without thereby either allowing\nequal or greater evils, or preventing equal or greater goods, and the\nquestion arises as to how that claim can be supported.  In\nparticular, can it be established by means of a purely deductive\nargument?\n \nConsider, in particular, the relevant premise in the more concrete\nversion of the argument from evil set out in section 1.4, namely:\n\nThere exist states of affairs in which animals die agonizing\ndeaths in forest fires, or where children undergo lingering suffering\nand eventual death due to cancer, and that (a) are intrinsically bad\nor undesirable, and (b) are such that any omnipotent person has the\npower to prevent them without thereby either allowing an equal or\ngreater evil, or preventing an equal or greater good.\n\n \nHow would one go about establishing via a purely deductive argument\nthat a deer\u2019s suffering a slow and painful death because of a forest\nfire, or a child\u2019s undergo lingering suffering and eventual death due\nto cancer, is not logically necessary either to achieve a greater\ngood or to avoid a greater evil?  If one had knowledge of the\ntotality of morally relevant properties, then it might well be\npossible to show both that there are no greater evils that can be\navoided only at the cost of the evil in question, and that there are\nno greater goods that are possible only given that evil.  Do we have\nsuch knowledge?  Some moral theorists would claim that we do, and\nthat it is possible to set out a complete and correct moral theory.\nBut this is certainly a highly controversial metaethical claim, and,\nas a consequence, the prospects for establishing a premise such as\n(1) via a deductive argument do not appear promising, at least given the\npresent state of moral theory.\n\nBut if one cannot establish (1) via a deductive argument from one\u2019s\nmoral theory, cannot it be argued that that will lead to skepticism\nabout whether one can know what human actions are morally right and\nmorally wrong? This is a serious question, and it may well be that\nsuch knowledge is ruled out. But as will become clear when we\nconsider evidential versions of the argument from evil, it may well be\nthat one can have justified beliefs about the rightness and\nwrongness of actions.\n \nIf a premise such as (1) cannot, at least at present, be established\ndeductively, then the only possibility, it would seem, is to offer\nsome sort of inductive argument in support of the relevant premise.\nBut if this is right, then it is surely best to get that crucial\ninductive step out into the open, and thus to formulate the argument\nfrom evil not as a deductive argument for the very strong claim that\nit is logically impossible for both God and evil to exist, (or for\nGod and certain types, or instances, of evil to exist), but as an\nevidential (inductive/probabilistic) argument for the more modest\nclaim that there are evils that actually exist in the world that make\nit unlikely that God exists.\n3. Inductive Versions of the Argument from Evil\n3.1 Arguments\n\nIf the argument from evil is given an evidential formulation, what\nform should that take? There appear to be four main possibilities that\nhave been suggested in recent discussions. The first, which might be\ncalled the direct inductive approach, involves the idea that\none can show that theism is unlikely to be true without comparing\ntheism with any alternative hypothesis, other than the mere denial of\ntheism.  At the heart of this first approach, which was set out by\nWilliam Rowe, is the idea that one sound type of inductive inference\nis what might be referred to as instantial generalization, where this\nis a matter of projecting a generalization that has been found to hold\nin all cases that have been so far examined to all cases whatever.\nThe second, which can be labeled the indirect inductive\napproach, argues instead that theism can be shown to be unlikely to be\ntrue by establishing that there is some alternative\nhypothesis\u2014other than the mere negation of theism\u2014that is\nlogically incompatible with theism, and more probable than\ntheism. This approach, which was originally used by David Hume in one\nof his arguments in his Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and which has been set out and defended in a detailed\nway by Paul Draper, can be viewed as involving an inference to the\nbest explanation, a type of inductive inference that was discovered by\nC. S. Pierce, and which is now very widely accepted.\nThe third approach, which has been advanced by William Rowe,\ninvolves what might be referred to as a Bayesian approach,\nand it differs from the first two approaches in that it does not\ninvolve either instantial generalization or inference to the best\nexplanation, or, indeed, any sort of inductive inference. The idea,\ninstead, is to start out from premises that are themselves substantive\nprobabilistic claims, and then to show that it follows deductively\nfrom those premises, via axioms of probability theory, that it is\nunlikely that God exists.\nThe fourth and final approach, which has been set out by Michael\nTooley, involves the idea of bringing a substantive theory of\ninductive logic, or logical probability, to bear upon the argument\nfrom evil, and then to argue that when this is done, one can derive a\nformula giving the probability that God does not exist relative to\ninformation about the number of apparent evils to be found in the\nworld.\nThese four approaches will be set out and considered in the sections that follow.\n\n3.2 Direct Inductive Versions of the Evidential Argument from Evil\n3.2.1 A Concrete, Deontological, and Direct Inductive Formulation\n\nThe basic idea behind a direct inductive formulation of the argument\nfrom evil is that the argument involves a crucial inductive step that\ntakes the form of an inductive projection or generalization in which\none moves from a premise concerning the known moral properties of some\nstate of affairs to a conclusion about the likely overall moral worth\nof that state of affairs, given all its moral properties, both known\nand unknown.\n\nSuch a direct inductive argument might, for example, take the following\nform:\n\nThere are events in our world \u2014 such as an animal\u2019s dying an\nagonizing death in a forest fire, and a child\u2019s undergo lingering\nsuffering and eventual death due to cancer \u2014 such that the\nactions of allowing those events, when one could prevent them, both\n(a) have very serious, known wrongmaking characteristics, and (b) have\nno rightmaking characteristics of which we are aware that are\nsufficient to balance out the known wrongmaking properties.\n\n\nTherefore it is likely that:\n\nFor any such action, the totality of the wrongmaking\nproperties, both known and unknown, outweighs the\ntotality of the rightmaking properties, both known and\nunknown.\nAny action whose wrongmaking properties outweigh its rightmaking\nproperties is morally wrong.\n\n\nTherefore, from (2) and (3) :\n\nSuch actions are morally wrong.\nFor any action whatever, an omnipotent and omniscient being is\ncapable of not performing that action.\n\n\nTherefore, from (4) and (5):\n\nIf there is an omnipotent and omniscient being, then that being\nperforms some morally wrong actions.\nA being that performs morally wrong actions is not morally perfect.\n\n\nTherefore, from (6) and (7):\n\nIf there is an omnipotent and omniscient being, that being is not\nmorally perfect.\nGod is by definition an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally\nperfect person.\n\n\nTherefore, from (8) and (9):\n\n God does not exist.\n\n\nWhen the argument from evil is formulated in this way, it involves\nfive premises, set out at steps (1), (3), (5), (7) and (9). Statement\n(1) involves both empirical claims, and moral claims, but the\nempirical claims are surely true, and, setting aside the question of\nthe existence of objective rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, the\nmoral claims are surely also very plausible. The other four premises,\nset out at steps (3), (5), (7) and (9), are plausibly viewed as\nanalytic truths.\n\nAs regards the logic of the argument, all of the steps in the\nargument, other than the inference from (1) to (2), are deductive, and\nare either clearly valid as they stand, or could be made so by trivial\nexpansions of the argument at the relevant points. The upshot,\naccordingly, is that the above argument appears to stand or fall with\nthe defensibility of the inductive inference from (1) to (2). The\ncrucial questions, accordingly, are, first, exactly what the form of\nthat inductive inference is, and, secondly, whether it is sound.\n\n3.2.2 A Natural Account of the Logic of the Inductive Step\n\nA familiar and very common sort of inductive inference involves\nmoving from information to the effect that all observed things of a\ncertain type have a certain property to the conclusion that absolutely\nall things of the type in question have the relevant property. Could\nthe inductive step in the evidential argument from evil perhaps be of\nthat form?\n\nOne philosopher who has suggested that this is the case is William\nRowe, in his 1991 article, \u201cRuminations about Evil\u201d. Let us consider,\nthen, whether that view can be sustained.\n\nIn that article, Rowe formulates the premise of the crucial inference\nas follows:\n\n(P) No good state of affairs that we know of is such that an\nomnipotent, omniscient being\u2019s obtaining it would morally justify\nthat being\u2019s permitting E1 or E2. (1991, 72)\n\n\n\n(Here \u201cE1\u201d refers to a case of a fawn who dies in\nlingering and terrible fashion as a result of a forest fire, and\n\u201cE2\u201d to the case of a young girl who is brutally\nraped, beaten, and murdered.)\n\nCommenting on P, Rowe emphasizes that what proposition\nP says is not simply that we cannot see how various goods\nwould justify an omnipotent, omniscient being\u2019s permitting\nE1 or E2, but rather,\n\nThe good states of affairs I know of, when I reflect on them, meet\none or both of the following conditions: either an omnipotent being\ncould obtain them without having to permit either\nE1 or E2, or obtaining them wouldn\u2019t morally justify that being in permitting\nE1 or E2. (1991, 72)\n\n\nRowe then goes on to say that:\n\u2026 if this is so, I have reason to\nconclude that:\n\n \n(Q) No good state of affairs is such that an omnipotent,\nomniscient being\u2019s obtaining it would morally justify that\nbeing\u2019s permitting E1 or E2.\n \n(1991, 72)\n\n\nRowe uses the letter \u2018J\u2019 \u201cto stand for the property\na good has just in case obtaining that good would justify an\nomnipotent, omniscient being in permitting E1 or\nE2\u201d (1991, 73). When this is done, the above\ninference can be compactly represented as follows:\n\n(P)\n\nNo good that we know of has J.\n    \n\n\nTherefore, probably:\n\n(Q)\n\nNo good has J.\n    \n\n\nRowe next refers to Plantinga\u2019s criticism of this inference, and\nhe argues that Plantinga\u2019s criticism now amounts to the claim\nthat\n\nwe are justified in inferring Q (No good has J)\nfrom P (No good we know of has J) only if we have a\ngood reason to think that if there were a good that has\nJ it would be a good that we are acquainted with and could\nsee to have J. For the question can be raised: How can we\nhave confidence in this inference unless we have a good reason to\nthink that were a good to have J it would likely be a good\nwithin our ken?  (1991, 73)\n\n\nRowe\u2019s response is then as follows:\n\nMy answer is that we are justified in making this inference in the\nsame way we are justified in making the many inferences we constantly\nmake from the known to the unknown. All of us are constantly inferring\nfrom the \\(A\\)s we know of to the \\(A\\)s we\ndon\u2019t know of. If we observe many \\(A\\)s and note that\nall of them are \\(B\\)s we are justified in believing that\nthe As we haven\u2019t observed are also\n\\(B\\)s. Of course, these inferences may be defeated. We may\nfind some independent reason to think that if an \\(A\\) were a\n\\(B\\) it would likely not be among the \\(A\\)s we have\nobserved.  But to claim that we cannot be justified in making such\ninferences unless we already know, or have good reason to believe,\nthat were an \\(A\\) not to be a \\(B\\) it would likely be\namong the As we\u2019ve observed is simply to encourage\nradical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general. (1991,\n73)\n\n\nFinally, Rowe points out that:\n\n\u2026 in considering the inference from\nP to Q it is very important to distinguish two\ncriticisms:\n\n\nOne is entitled to infer Q from P only if she\nhas a good reason to think that if some good had J it would\nbe a good that she knows of.\nOne is entitled to infer Q from P only if she\nhas no reason to think that if some good had J it would\nlikely not be a good that she knows of.\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s criticism is of type (A). For the reason given, it is\nnot a cogent criticism. But a criticism of type (B) is entirely proper\nto advance against any inductive inference of the sort we are\nconsidering.  (1991, 73\u20134)\n\n\nIn view of the last point, Rowe concludes that \u201cone important route\nfor the theist to explore is whether there is some reason to think\nthat were a good to have J it either would not be a good\nwithin our ken or would be such that although we apprehend this good\nwe are incapable of determining that it has J,\u201d (1991, 74).\n3.2.3 An Evaluation of this Account of the Inductive Step\n\nFirst, Rowe is right that a criticism of type (A) does involve\n\u201cradical skepticism of inductive reasoning in\ngeneral\u201d. But, secondly, having granted that point, how\nsatisfactory is Rowe\u2019s account of the reasoning involved?  To answer\nthat question, what one needs to notice is that Rowe\u2019s claim that\n\u201cif we observe many \\(A\\)s and note that all of them are\n\\(B\\)s we are justified in believing that the \\(A\\)s we\nhaven\u2019t observed are also \\(B\\)s\u201d is somewhat ambiguous,\nsince while the claim that \u201cwe are justified in believing that\nthe \\(A\\)s we haven\u2019t observed are also \\(B\\)s\u201d might\nnaturally be interpreted as saying\n\nWe are justified in believing that all the\n\\(A\\)s that we haven\u2019t observed are also\n\\(B\\)s\n\n\nit is possible to construe it as making, instead, the following,\nmuch weaker claim\n\nWe are justified in believing of each of the\n\\(A\\)s that we haven\u2019t observed that that \\(A\\)\nis also a \\(B\\).\n\n\nLet us consider, then, the relevance of this distinction. On the one\nhand, Rowe is certainly right that any criticism that claims that one\nis not justified in inferring (2) unless one has additional\ninformation to the effect that unobserved \\(A\\)s are not likely\nto differ from observed \\(A\\)s with respect to the possession of\nproperty \\(B\\) entails inductive skepticism.  But, by contrast,\nit is not true that this is so if one rejects, instead, the inference\nto (1). For one might reject the latter inference on the ground that\nwhile, given any particular \\(A\\), it is likely that that\n\\(A\\) is a \\(B\\), it is not likely that all \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s. (Compare the situation with a very long conjunction: given any\nparticular conjunct, it may be likely that that conjunct is true,\nwhile being very unlikely that every conjunct, and hence the\nconjunction as a whole, is true.)\n\nThis is important, moreover, because it is (1) that Rowe needs, since\nthe conclusion that he is drawing does not concern simply the\nnext morally relevant property that someone might consider:\nconclusion Q asserts, rather, that all further\nmorally relevant properties will lack property J. Such a\nconclusion about all further cases is much stronger than a conclusion\nabout the next case, and one might well think that in some\ncircumstances a conclusion of the latter sort is justified, but that a\nconclusion of the former sort is not.\n\nOne way of supporting the latter claim is by introducing the idea of\nlogical probability, where logical probability is a measure of the\nextent to which one proposition supports another (Carnap, 1962,\n19\u201351, esp. 43\u20137), and then arguing (Tooley, 1977,\n690\u20133, and 1987, 129\u201337) that when one is dealing with an\naccidental generalization, the probability that the\nregularity in question will obtain gets closer and closer to zero,\nwithout limit, as the number of potential instances gets larger and\nlarger, and that this is so regardless of how large one\u2019s\nevidence base is. Is it impossible, then, to justify universal\ngeneralizations?  The answer is that if laws are more than mere\nregularities\u2014and, in particular, if they are second-order\nrelations between universals\u2014then the obtaining of a law, and\nthus of the corresponding regularity, may have a very high probability\nupon even quite a small body of evidence. So universal generalizations\ncan be justified, if they obtain in virtue of underlying, governing\nlaws of nature.\n\nThe question then becomes whether Q expresses a law\u2014or\na consequence of a law. If\u2014as seems plausible\u2014it does not,\nthen, although it is true that one in justified in holding, of any\ngiven, not yet observed morally relevant property, that it is unlikely\nto have property J, it may not be the case that it is\nprobable that no goodmaking (or rightmaking) property has property\nJ. It may, on the contrary, be probable that there\nis some morally relevant property that does have property\nJ.\n\nThis objection could be overcome if one could argue that it is\nunlikely that there are many unknown goodmaking properties. For if the\nnumber is small, then the probability of Q may still be high\neven if Q does not express a law, or a consequence of a\nlaw. Moreover, I am inclined to think that it may well be possible to\nargue that it is unlikely that there are many unknown, morally\nrelevant properties. But I also think that it is very likely that any\nattempt to establish this conclusion would involve some very\ncontroversial metaethical claims. As a consequence, I think that one\nis justified in concluding that such a line of argument is not\nespecially promising.\n3.3 Indirect Inductive Versions of the Evidential Argument from Evil\n\nIn his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Hume contended\nthat it was not possible to arrive at the conclusion that the world\nhad a perfectly good cause\u2014or a perfectly evil \none\u2014starting out simply from a world that consists of a mixture of good\nand bad states of affairs:\n\nThere may four hypotheses be framed concerning the first\ncauses of the universe: that they are endowed with perfect\ngoodness, that they are endowed with perfect malice,\nthat they are opposite and have both goodness and malice,\nthat they have neither goodness nor malice. Mixed phenomena\ncan never prove the two former unmixed principles.  And the\nuniformity and steadiness of general laws seems to oppose the third.\nThe fourth, therefore, seems by far the most probable. (1779, Part\nXI, 212)\n\n\nBut if this is right, and the hypothesis that the first cause (or\ncauses) of the universe is neither good nor evil is more probable than\nthe hypothesis that the first cause is perfectly good, then the\nprobability of the latter must be less than one half.\n\nHume advanced, then, an evidential argument from evil that has a\ndistinctly different logical form from that involved in direct\ninductive arguments, for the idea is to point to some proposition that\nis logically incompatible with theism, and then to argue that,\ngiven facts about undesirable states of affairs to be found in the\nworld, that hypothesis is more probable than theism, and, therefore,\nthat theism is more likely to be false than to be\ntrue.[3]:\n\nMore than two centuries later, Paul Draper, inspired by Hume, set out\nand defended this type of indirect inductive argument in a very\ndetailed way. In doing so, Draper focused upon two alternative\nhypotheses, the first of which he referred to as \u201cthe Hypothesis of\nIndifference,\u201d and which was as follows (1989,\n13)[4]:\n\n(HI)\n\nneither the nature nor the condition of sentient\nbeings on earth is the result of benevolent or malevolent actions\nperformed by nonhuman persons.\n    \n\n\nDraper then focused upon three sets of propositions about occurrences\nof pleasure and pain, dealing, respectively, with (a) the experience\nof pleasure and pain, by moral agents, which is known to be\nbiologically useful, (b) the experience of pleasure and pain, by\nsentient beings that are not moral agents, which is known to be\nbiologically useful, and (c) the experience of pleasure and pain, by\nsentient beings, which is not known to be biologically useful, and\nDraper then argued that, where \u2018O\u2019 expresses the\nconjunction of all those propositions, and \u2018T\u2019\nexpresses the proposition that God exists, the probability that\nO is the case given HI is greater than the\nprobability of O given T. It then follows, provided\nthat the initial probability of T is no greater than that of\nHI, that T is more likely to be false than to be\ntrue.\n\nTo set out Draper\u2019s argument in a little more detail, let us use\n\u2018\\(\\Pr(P \\mid Q)\\) \u2019 to stand\nfor either the logical probability, or, as Draper (1996, 27) himself\ndoes, the epistemic probability, that \\(P\\) is true, given that \\(Q\\) is true,\nand then use the following instance of what is known as Bayes\u2019\nTheorem\n\n\\[\n\\tag{1}\n\\Pr(H \\mid E) = \\frac{\\Pr(H) \\Pr(E \\mid H)}{\\Pr(H)\\Pr(E \\mid H) + \\Pr(J)\\Pr(E \\mid J)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis instance of Bayes\u2019 Theorem deals with the simple case where one\nhas two hypotheses H and J that are mutually exclusive and jointly\nexhaustive, and where one is interested\nin \\(\\Pr(H \\mid E)\\), that is, the\nprobability that H is true given evidence E. What this instance of\nBayes\u2019 Theorem does is provide one with a way of calculating that\nprobability, provided that one knows, first of\nall, \\(\\Pr(H)\\)\nand \\(\\Pr(J)\\)\u2014that is, the a priori\nlogical probabilities of \\(H\\) and \\(J\\)\u2014and also,\nsecond, \\(\\Pr(E \\mid H)\\)\nand \\(\\Pr(E \\mid J)\\)\u2014that is, the\nlogical probability of \\(E\\) given, respectively, only \\(H\\) and only \\(J\\). \nBy substitution in (1), we have:\n\n\n\\[\n\\tag{2}\n\\Pr(HI \\mid O) = \\frac{\\Pr(HI)\\Pr(O \\mid HI)}{\\Pr(HI)\\Pr(O \\mid HI) + \\Pr(T)\\Pr(O \\mid T)}\n\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, by interchanging \u2018HI\u2019 and \u2018T\u2019, we also have:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{3}\n\\Pr(T \\mid O) = \\frac{\\Pr(T)\\Pr(O \\mid T)}{\\Pr(T)\\Pr(O \\mid T) + \\Pr(HI)\\Pr(O \\mid HI)}\n\\]\n\nIf we then divide (2) by (3) we arrive at the following very useful equation:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{4}\n\\frac{\\Pr(HI \\mid O)}{\\Pr(T \\mid O)} = \\frac{\\Pr(HI)\\Pr(O \\mid HI)}{\\Pr(T)\\Pr(O \\mid T)}\n\\]\n\n\nSo far, this is simply a matter of probability theory. But now Draper\nintroduces two substantive claims.  The first is that the a priori\nprobability of the hypothesis of indifference is not less than the a\npriori probability of theism, so that we have\n\n\\[\n\\tag{5}\n\\Pr(HI) \\ge \\Pr(T)\n\\]\n\n\nDraper\u2019s second substantive claim is that the conjunction of\npropositions about pleasure and pain to which Draper refers, and which\nis represented by \u2018\\(O\\)\u2019 is more likely to be true if the hypothesis of\nindifference is true than if theism is true. So we have\n\n\\[\n\\tag{6}\n\\Pr(O \\mid HI) \\gt \\Pr(O \\mid T)\n\\]\n\n\n\nBut provided that \\(\\Pr(T)\\) and \\(\\Pr(O \\mid T)\\) are not equal to zero\u2014which is surely very reasonable\u2014(5) and (6) can be rewritten as \n\n\\[\n\\tag{7}\n\\frac{\\Pr(HI)}{\\Pr(T)} \\ge 1\n\\]\n\n\nand\n\n\n\\[\n\\tag{8}\n\\frac{\\Pr(O \\mid HI)}{\\Pr(O \\mid T)} \\gt 1\n\\]\n\n\nIt then follows, by multiplying (7) and (8), that\n\n\\[\n\\tag{9}\n\\frac{\\Pr(HI)\\Pr(O \\mid HI)}{\\Pr(T)\\Pr(O \\mid T)} \\gt 1\n\\]\n\n\nThis, together with (4), then entails:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{10}\n\\frac{\\Pr(HI \\mid O)}{\\Pr(T \\mid O)} \\gt 1\n\\]\n\n Finally, Draper assumes (as a substantive premise) that the\nhypothesis of indifference is logically incompatible with theism:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{11}\nHI \\text{ entails } \\negt T\n\\]\n\n\nIt then follows from (10) and (11) that\n\n\\[\n\\tag{12}\n\\Pr(\\negt T \\mid O) \\gt \\Pr(T \\mid O)\n\\]\n\n\nSo we have the result that, given the facts about pleasure and pain\nsummarized by \u2018\\(O\\)\u2019, theism is more likely to be false than to be\ntrue.\n\nThere are various points at which one might respond to this\nargument. First, it might be argued that the assumption that the\nhypothesis of indifference is logically incompatible with theism is\nnot obviously true. For might it not be logically possible that there\nwas an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being who created a\nneutral environment in which evolution could take place in a chancy\nway, and who afterwards did not intervene in any way?  But, if so,\nthen while \\(T\\) would be true, \\(HI\\) might also be\ntrue\u2014as it would be if there were no other nonhuman persons.\nSo, at the very least, it is not clear that \\(HI\\) entails\n\\(\\negt T\\).\n\nSecondly, it might also be argued that the substantive premise\nintroduced at (5)\u2014that is, \\(\\Pr(HI) \\ge \\Pr(T)\\)\u2014 is\nopen to\nquestion. Draper supports it by arguing that whereas the hypothesis\nof theism involves some ontological commitment, the Hypothesis of\nIndifference does not. But, on the other hand, the latter involves a\ncompletely universal generalization about the absence of any action\nupon the earth by any nonhuman persons, of either a benevolent or\nmalevolent sort, and it is far from clear why the prior probability\nof this being so should be greater than the prior probability of\ntheism.\n\nBoth of these objections can be avoided, however, by simply shifting\nfrom \\(HI\\) to a different alternative hypothesis that Draper also\nmentions, namely, \u201cThe Indifferent Deity Hypothesis\u201d:\n\nThere exists an omnipotent and omniscient person who created the\nUniverse and who has no intrinsic concern about the pain or pleasure\nof other beings. (1989, 26)\n\n\nThirdly, it can be objected that the argument does not really move far\nbeyond two of its three crucial assumptions\u2014the assumptions set\nout, namely, at steps (5) and (11), to the effect that\n\\(\\Pr(HI) \\ge \\Pr(T)\\),\nand \\(HI\\) entails \\(\\negt T\\).  For given those assumptions,\nit follows immediately that \\(\\Pr(T) \\le 0.5\\),\nand so the rest of the argument merely moves from that conclusion to\nthe conclusion that \\(\\Pr(T) \\lt 0.5\\).\n\nOne response to this objection is that the move from\n\\(\\Pr(T) \\le 0.5\\) to\n\\(\\Pr(T) \\lt 0.5\\) is not insignificant, since it\nis a move from a situation in which acceptance of theism may not be\nirrational to one where it is certainly is.  Nevertheless, the\nobjection does bring out an important point, namely, that the argument\nas it stands says nothing at all about how much below 0.5 the\nprobability of theism is.\n \nFourthly, objections can be directed at the arguments that Draper\noffers in support of a third substantive premise\u2014namely, that\nintroduced at (6).  Some of the objections directed against this\npremise are less than impressive\u2014and some seem very implausible\nindeed, as in the case, for example, of Peter van Inwagen, who has to\nappeal to quite an extraordinary claim about the conditions that one\nmust satisfy in order to claim that a world is logically possible:\n\nOne should start by describing in some detail the laws of nature\nthat govern that world. (Physicists\u2019 actual formulations of quantum\nfield theories and the general theory of relativity provide the\nstandard of required \u201cdetail.\u201d) One should then go on to\ndescribe the boundary conditions under which those laws operate; the\ntopology of the world\u2019s space-time, its relativistic mass, the number\nof particle families, and so on.  Then one should tell in convincing\ndetail the story of cosmic evolution in that world: the story of the\ndevelopment of large objects like galaxies and of stars and of small\nobjects like carbon atoms. Finally, one should tell the story of the\nevolution of life. (1991, 146)\n\nSuch objections tend to suggest that any flaws in Draper\u2019s\nargument in support of the crucial premise are less than obvious.\nNevertheless, given that the argument that Draper offers in support\nof the premise at (6) involves a number of detailed considerations,\nvery careful scrutiny of those arguments would be needed before one\ncould conclude that the premise is justified.\n\nFinally, rather than attacking the argument itself, one might\ninstead argue that, while it is sound, the conclusion is not really a\nsignificant one.  For what matters is not whether there is some\nevidence relative to which it is unlikely that theism is true.  What\nmatters is whether theism is improbable relative to our total\nevidence.  But, then, suppose that we introduce some different\nobservations\u2014\\(O^*\\)\u2014such that it seems plausible that\n\\(O^*\\) is more likely to be the case if theism is true that if\nthe Hypothesis of Indifference is true.  For example, \\(O^*\\)\nmight be some proposition about the occurrences of experiences that\nseem to be experiences of a loving deity.  The question then is\nwhether the appropriate revision of the first substantive premise is\nplausible.  That is, do we have good reason for thinking that the\nfollowing statement is true:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{\\(6^\\&\\)}\n\\Pr(O \\amp O^* \\mid HI) \\gt \\Pr(O \\amp O^* \\mid T) \\, ?\n\\]\n\n\nAt the very least, it would seem that \\((6^{\\&})\\) is much more\nproblematic than \\((6)\\).  But if that is right, then the above,\nDraper-style argument, even if all of its premises are true, is not\nas significant as it may initially appear, since if \\((6^{\\&})\\)\nis not true, the conclusion that theism is more likely to be false\nthan to be true can be undercut by introducing additional evidence of\na pro-theist sort.\n\nA Draper-style argument is one type of indirect inductive argument\nfrom evil.  It is important to notice, however, that in formulating an\nindirect inductive argument from evil, one need not proceed along the\nroute that Draper chooses.  This is clear if one focuses upon Hume\u2019s\nformulation, and then thinks in terms of the idea of an inference to\nthe best explanation of the \u201cmixed phenomena\u201d that one\nfinds.  If one explains the fact that the world contains an impressive\nmixture of desirable and undesirable states of affairs by the\nhypothesis that the creator of the world was an omnipotent,\nomniscient, and indifferent deity, then nothing more needs to be\nadded.  By contrast, if one wants to explain the mixed state of the\nworld by the hypothesis that the creator of the world was an\nomnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect deity, one needs to\npostulate the existence of additional, morally significant properties\nthat lie beyond our ken, and ones, moreover, that are so distributed\nthat the mixed appearance does not correspond to what is really the\ncase.  A theistic explanation is, accordingly, less simple than an\nindifferent deity explanation, and therefore, provided that one can\nargue that the a priori probability of the latter hypothesis\nis not less than that of the former, one can appeal to the greater\nsimplicity of the latter in order to conclude that it has a higher\nposterior probability than the theistic hypothesis.  It then follows,\ngiven that the two hypotheses are logically incompatible, that the\nprobability of the theistic hypothesis must be less than one half.\n3.4 William Rowe\u2019s Bayesian-Style Probabilistic Versions of the Evidential Argument from Evil\n\n\nWe have just considered the Bayesian-style argument offered by Paul\nDraper. Let us now turn to another.\n\n\nIn his 1996 paper, \u201cThe Evidential Argument from Evil: A Second\nLook\u201d, Rowe set aside the problem of attempting to find a\nsatisfactory account of the inductive step involved in direct,\ninductive formulations of the argument from evil in favor of a very\ndifferent, Bayesian formulation of the argument from evil. The latter\nargument has been vigorously criticized by Plantinga (1998), but Rowe\n(1998) has remained confident that the new argument is sound.\n3.4.1 A Summary of Rowe\u2019s Bayesian Argument\n\nRowe\u2019s new argument can be summarized as follows.  First, its\nformulation involves only three propositions, one of which is\nproposition \\(k\\), which expresses, roughly, the totality of our\nbackground knowledge, while the other two propositions are as\nfollows:\n\n\\((P)\\)\n\nNo good that we know of justifies an omnipotent,\nomniscient, perfectly good being in permitting \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\);\n    \n\\((G)\\)\n\nThere is an omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being.\n    \n\n\nSecondly, the object of the argument as a whole is to start out from\nsome probabilistic assumptions, and then to move deductively, using\nonly axioms of probability theory, to the following two conclusions:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{C1} & \\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt \\Pr(G \\mid k) \\\\\n\\tag{C2} & \\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt 0.5 \\,.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe first conclusion, then, is that the probability that God exists\nis lower given the combination of \\(P\\) together with our background\nknowledge than it is given our background knowledge alone. Thus\n\\(P\\) disconfirms \\(G\\) in the sense of lowering the\nprobability of \\(G\\). The second conclusion is that \\(P\\)\ndisconfirms \\(G\\) in a different sense\u2014namely, it, together\nwith our background knowledge, makes it more likely than not that\n\\(G\\) is false.\n\nThirdly, in order to establish the first conclusion, Rowe needs only\nthe following three assumptions:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} & \\Pr(P \\mid \\negt G \\amp k) = 1 \\\\\n\\tag{2} &       \\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k) \\gt 0 \\\\\n\\tag{3} &      \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) \\lt 1\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nFourthly, all three assumptions, interpreted as Rowe does, are surely\neminently reasonable.  As regards (1), it follows from the fact that\nfor any two propositions \\(q\\) and \\(r\\), if \\(q\\)\nentails \\(r\\) then \\(\\Pr(r \\mid q) = 1\\), together with the fact \nthat Rowe interprets \\(P\\) in such a\nway that \\(\\negt G\\) entails \\(P\\), since he interprets\n\\(P\\) as saying that it is not the case that there is an\nomnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being together with some\nknown good that justifies that being in allowing\n\\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\).\nAs regards (2), it certainly seems plausible, assuming that the\nexistence of God is not logically necessary, that there is at least\nsome non-zero probability that God does not exist, given our\nbackground knowledge. But one can derive (2), provided that one is\nwilling to accept the (not uncontroversial) principle that only\nnecessarily false propositions have a probability equal to zero. (This\nprinciple is very plausible if one accepts the idea of\ninfinitesimals. If one does not, one may hold that some contingent\npropositions have a probability equal to zero.) Given this assumption,\nthe reasoning is then that \\(\\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k)\\) can be equal to\nzero only if the conjunction \\(\\negt G \\amp k\\) is necessarily false,\nwhich can be case only if either \\(G\\) is a necessary truth, or else\n\\(k\\) entails \\(G\\), neither of which is the case.\nSimilarly, (3) also seems plausible, and here too one can derive\n(3) provided that one is willing to accept the principle that only\nnecessarily false propositions have a probability equal to zero. Here\nthe reasoning will be that \\(\\Pr (P\\mid G \\amp k)\\) can be equal to one\nonly if the conjunction \\(\\negt P \\amp G \\amp k\\) is necessarily\nfalse, which can be case only if either \\(\\negt P\\) is necessarily\nfalse, or the conjunction \\(G \\amp k\\) entails \\(P\\), neither of which\nis the case.\n\nSecondly, if the existence of God is neither a\nlogically necessary truth nor entailed by our background knowledge,\nand if the existence of God together with our background knowledge\ndoes not logically entail that no good that we know of justifies an\nomnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being in permitting\n\\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\), then one can\nsupport (2) and (3) by appealing to the very plausible principle that\nthe probability of \\(r\\) given \\(q\\) is equal to one if and\nonly if \\(q\\) entails \\(r\\).\n\nFinally, to establish the second conclusion\u2014that is, that\nrelative to our background knowledge together with proposition\n\\(P\\) it is more likely than not that God does not\nexist\u2014Rowe needs only one additional assumption:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{4}\n\\Pr(G \\mid k) \\le 0.5\n\\]\n\n\nGiven assumptions (1), (2), and (3), how does the argument for the first conclusion go?  In outline, one first uses (1), (2), and (3) to prove that\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\Pr(P \\mid k) \\gt \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)\n\\\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt then follows very quickly that\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\Pr(G \\mid k) \\gt \\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k)\n\\\n\\]\n\n\n\nAssumption (4) then allows one to conclude that\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k)\\lt 0.5\\\n\\\n\\]\n\n\nHere are the details.\n\n\nThe key starting point is with the following theorem of probability theory (Compare Draper, 1996, 268):\n\n\\[\n\\tag{5}\n\\Pr(P \\mid k) = [\\Pr(\\negt G\\mid k)\\times \\Pr(P \\mid \\negt G \\amp k)] + [\\Pr(G\\mid k)\\times \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)]\n\\]\n\n\nSubstituting into (5) using assumption (1) then gives one:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{6}\n\\Pr(P \\mid k) = [\\Pr(\\negt G\\mid k) \\times 1] + [\\Pr(G\\mid k)\\times \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)]\n\\]\n\n\n\nNext, it is a truth of probability theory that\n\n\\[\n\\tag{7}\n\\Pr(G \\mid k) = [1 - \\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k)]\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing (7) to substitute into (6) one has\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{8}\n  &\\Pr(P \\mid k) \\\\\n\\notag\n  &= \\Pr(\\negt G\\mid k) + [[1 - \\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k)]\\times \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \\\\\n\\notag \n  &= \\Pr(\\negt G\\mid k) + \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) - [\\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k)\\times \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nSubtracting \\(\\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)\\) from each side of (8) then gives one:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{9}\n &\\Pr(P \\mid k) - \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) \\\\\n\\notag\n &= \\Pr(\\negt G\\mid k) - [\\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k)\\times \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \\\\\n\\notag\n &= \\Pr(\\negt G\\mid k)\\times [1 - \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nBut then in view of assumption (2) we have that \\(\\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k)\n\\gt 0\\), while in view of assumption (3) we have that \\(\\Pr(P \\mid G\n\\amp k) \\lt 1\\), and thus that \\([1 - \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \\gt 0\\), \nso that it then follows from (9) that\n\n\\[\n\\tag{10}\n\\Pr(P \\mid k) -\\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) \\gt 0.\n\\\n\\]\n\n\n\nSo one has\n\n\\[\n\\tag{11}\n\\Pr(P \\mid k) \\gt \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)\n\\\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe next stage involve showing that it follows from (11) that\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt \\Pr(G \\mid k) \n\\\n\\]\n\n\nThis is done as follows.\nFirst, it follows from the definition of conditional probability one has\n\n\\[\n\\tag{12}\n\\Pr(P \\amp G\\amp k) = \\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k)] \\times \\Pr(P\\mid k)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\tag{13}\n\\Pr(P \\amp G\\amp k) = \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \\times \\Pr(G\\mid k)\n\\]\n\n\nSo we have\n\n\\[\n\\tag{14}\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k)] \\times \\Pr(P\\mid k) = \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)] \\times \\Pr(G\\mid k)\n\\]\n\n\nDividing both sides of (13) by \\(\\Pr(G \\mid k) \\times\n\\Pr(P \\mid k)\\) then gives one:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{15}\n\\frac{\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k)}{\\Pr(G \\mid k)} = \\frac{\\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k)}{\\Pr(P \\mid k)} \n\\]\n\n\n\nIt then follows from (15) together with (11) that\n\n\\[\n\\tag{16}\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt \\Pr(G \\mid k)  \n\\]\n\n\nFinally, it then follows from (16) together with (4) that\n\n\\[\n\\tag{17}\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt 0.5  \n\\]\n\n\n3.4.2 The Flaw in the Argument\n\nGiven the plausibility of assumptions (1), (2), and (3), together\nwith the impeccable logic, the prospects of faulting Rowe\u2019s\nargument for his first conclusion may not seem at all promising. Nor\ndoes the situation seem significantly different in the case of\nRowe\u2019s second conclusion, since assumption (4) also seems very\nplausible, in view of the fact that the property of being an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being belongs to a family of properties, including the property of being an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly evil being, and the property of being an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly morally indifferent being, and, on the face of it, neither of the latter properties seems less likely to be instantiated in the actual world than the property of being an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being.\n\nIn fact, however, Rowe\u2019s argument is unsound. The reason is\nconnected with the point that while inductive arguments can fail, just\nas deductive arguments can, either because their logic is faulty, or\ntheir premises false, inductive arguments can also fail in a way that\ndeductive arguments cannot, in that they may violate a\nprinciple\u2014namely, the Total Evidence Requirement\u2014which I\nshall be setting out below, and Rowe\u2019s argument is defective in\nprecisely that way.\n\nA good way of approaching the objection that I have in mind is by\nconsidering the following, preliminary objection to Rowe\u2019s argument\nfor the conclusion that\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt 0.5 \\, .\n\\]\n\n\nThe objection is based on upon the observation that Rowe\u2019s argument\ninvolves, as we saw above, only the following four premises:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} & \\Pr(P \\mid \\negt G \\amp k) = 1   \\\\\n\\tag{2} & \\Pr(\\negt G \\mid k) \\gt 0 \\\\\n\\tag{3} & \\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) \\lt 1 \\\\\n\\tag{4} & \\Pr(G \\mid k) \\le 0.5\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nNotice now, first, that the proposition \\(P\\) enters only into\nthe first and the third of these premises, and secondly, that the\ntruth of both of these premises is easily secured.  Thus, for the\nfirst premise to be true, all that is needed is that \\(\\negt G\\)\nentails \\(P\\), while for the third premise to be true, all that\nis needed, according to most systems of inductive logic, is that\n\\(P\\) is not entailed by \\(G \\amp k\\), since\naccording to most systems of inductive logic,\n\\(\\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) \\lt 1\\) is\nonly false if \\(P\\) is entailed by \\(G \\amp k\\).\n\nGiven assumptions (1), (2), and (3), how does the argument for the first conclusion go?  In outline, one first uses (1), (2), and (3) to prove that\n\\(\\Pr(P \\mid G \\amp k) \\lt 1\\)\n\n \nConsider, now, what happens if, for example, Rowe\u2019s \\(P\\)\nis replaced by:\n\nEither God does not exist, or there is a pen in my pocket.\n\n\nStatements (1) and (3) will both be true given that replacement,\nwhile statements (2) and (4) are unaffected, and one will be able to\nderive the same conclusions as in Rowe\u2019s Bayesian argument.  But\nif this is so, then the theist can surely claim, it would seem, that\nthe fact that Rowe\u2019s \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 refers to evil in the world\nturns out to play no crucial role in Rowe\u2019s new argument!\n\nThis objection, however, is open to the following reply.  The reason\nthat I am justified in believing the proposition that either God does\nnot exist or there is a pen in my pocket is that I am justified in\nbelieving that there is a pen in my pocket.  The proposition that\neither God does not exist or there is a pen in my pocket therefore\ndoes not represent the total evidence that I have.  But the argument in question\ncannot be set out in terms of the proposition that, we can suppose, does in this case represent\none\u2019s total evidence\u2014namely, the proposition that there is a\npen in my pocket\u2014since that proposition is not entailed\nby \\(\\negt G\\).\n\nThe conclusion, in short, is that the above parody of Rowe\u2019s\nargument doesn\u2019t work, since the parody violates the following\nrequirement:\n\nThe Total Evidence Requirement: \nFor any proposition that is not non-inferentially justified, the\nprobability that one should assign to that proposition\u2019s being true is\nthe probability that the proposition has relative to one\u2019s total\nevidence.\n\n\nBut this response to the above objection to the argument for the\nconclusion that\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\Pr(G \\mid P \\amp k) \\lt 0.5\n\\]\n\n\nnow makes it clear that there a decisive objection to the\nargument as a whole. For notice that if \\(P\\)\u2014the statement\nthat\n\nNo good we know of justifies an omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly\ngood being in permitting \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\)\n\n\n\u2014is interpreted in such a way that \\(\\negt G\\) entails\n\\(P\\), it is then logically equivalent to the following\ndisjunctive statement:\n\n\\[\n\\notag\n\\negt G \\text{ or } P^*\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(P^*\\) is the proposition that Rowe sets out in footnote 8\nof his article, namely:\n\nNo good we know of would justify God, (if he\nexists) in permitting \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) (1996, 283)\n\n\nOnce this is noticed, it is clear that Rowe\u2019s argument is open\nto precisely the same response as that used against the objection to\nthe parody argument just considered, since the justification that one\ncan offer for \\(\\negt G\\) or \\(P^*\\) is in fact just a\njustification of the second disjunct\u2014that is, \\(P^*\\). This\nmeans that in appealing to \\(P\\) (i.e., to \\((\\negt G)\\) or\n\\(P^*\\)) one is not making use of one\u2019s total\nevidence. So Rowe\u2019s argument, if it is to be sound, must instead\nbe formulated in terms of \\(P^*\\).\n\nBut while \\(\\negt G\\) entails \\(P\\), it does not entail\n\\(P^*\\). So the result of replacing \u2018P\u2019 by\n\u2018P*\u2019 in statement (1)\u2014that is\n\n\\[\n\\tag{\\(1^*\\)}\n\\Pr(P^* \\mid \\negt G \\amp k) = 1\n\\]\n\n\n\u2014will not be true, and so an argument of the form that Rowe offers\nwill not go through. Rowe\u2019s Bayesian argument is, therefore, unsound.\n3.5 Inductive Logic and the Evidential Argument from Evil\n\nIn section 3.2.1, a concrete, deontological, and direct inductive\nformulation of the argument from evil was set out.  All of the steps\nin that argument were deductive, except for the following crucial\ninference:\n\nThere are events in our world \u2014 such as an animal\u2019s dying an agonizing death in a forest fire, and a child\u2019s undergo lingering suffering and eventual death due to cancer \u2014 such that the actions of allowing those events, when one could prevent them, both (a) have very serious, known wrongmaking characteristics, and (b) have no rightmaking characteristics of which we are aware that are sufficient to balance out the known wrongmaking properties.\n\n\nTherefore it is likely that:\n\nFor any such action, the totality of the wrongmaking properties, both known and unknown, outweighs the totality of the rightmaking properties, both known and unknown.\n\n\nThe question, accordingly, is whether this inductive step is\ncorrect.\nEssentially, there are three ways in which one might attempt to\ndefend this inference. One is by treating it as a case of instantial\ngeneralization. But as we saw in effect in section 3.2.3, when we\nconsidered a formulation of the evidential argument from evil advanced\nby William Rowe, it appears that the inductive step in the argument\nfrom evil cannot be defended by appealing to instantial\ngeneralization.\nA second approach is to view that inductive step as a matter of\ninference to the best explanation, and this is a more promising\npossibility.  That approach would lead to an argument of the general\nform advanced by David Hume and Paul Draper, considered in\nsection.\nThere is, however, a third possibility, which is the focus of the\npresent section.  Underlying this approach are two general ideas: the\nfirst is that both induction via instantial generalization and\ninference to the best explanation (abduction, the method of\nhypothesis, hypothetico-deductive method) stand in need of\njustification; the second idea is that at the heart of such a\njustification will be the defense of an account of logical\nprobability.\nThe fundamental idea, accordingly, is that the way to determine\nwhether the inductive step that lies at the heart of the evidential\nargument from evil is sound is by bringing serious inductive\nlogic\u2014understood as a theory of logical probability\u2014to\nbear upon the question.\nWhat is the appropriate theory of logical probability?  Tooley\n(2008 and 2012) employs a Carnapian theory in which the basic\nequiprobability assumption is formulated in terms of what are called\n\u2018structure descriptions\u2019, and the fundamental postulate is that all\nstructure descriptions are equally likely. But if one holds, as Tooley\n(1977 and 1987) does, that governing laws are logically possible, then\nit is clear that the fundamental equiprobability assumption needs to\nbe formulated in terms of governing laws of nature. At present,\nhowever, no detailed formulation of such an approach to logical\nprobability is available.\n3.5.1 An Illustration of the General Underlying Idea\n To establish that the inductive step in the version of the\nevidential argument from evil set out above is sound requires a rather\ntechnical argument in inductive logic.  But one can gain an intuitive\nunderstanding of the underlying idea in the following way.  Suppose\nthat there is a rightmaking property of which we have no knowledge.\nIf an action of allowing a child to be brutally killed possessed that\nproperty, then it might not be wrong to allow that action, depending\nupon the weightiness of that unknown rightmaking property.  But the\nexistence of unknown rightmaking properties is no more likely, a\npriori, than of unknown wrongmaking properties.  So let us suppose,\nthen, for this illustration, that there are two morally significant\nproperties of which we humans have no knowledge\u2014a rightmaking\nproperty \\(R\\), and a wrongmaking property \\(W\\).  Let us\nsuppose, further, that these two properties are equally weighty,\nsince, a priori, there is no reason for supposing that one is more\nsignificant than the other.  Finally, let \\(A\\) be an action of\nknowingly allowing a child to be brutally killed, and let us suppose\nthat the unknown morally significant rightmaking property \\(R\\)\nis weightier than the wrongmaking property of knowingly allowing a\nchild to be brutally killed.  One can then see that there are the\nfollowing four possibilities:\n\n Action \\(A\\) has both unknown properties, \\(R\\) and\n\\(W\\).  In this case, those two unknown properties cancel one\nanother out, and action \\(A\\) will be morally wrong, all things\nconsidered.\n Action \\(A\\) has the unknown rightmaking property\n\\(R\\), but not the unknown wrongmaking property \\(W\\).  In\nthis case, action \\(A\\) may be morally permissible, all things\nconsidered, on the assumption that property \\(R\\) is\nsufficiently strong to outweigh the known wrongmaking property of\nallowing a child to be brutally killed.\n Action \\(A\\) has the unknown wrongmaking property\n\\(W\\), but not the unknown rightmaking property \\(R\\).  In\nthis case, action \\(A\\) is even more wrong, all things\nconsidered, than it initially appeared to be.\n Action \\(A\\) does not have either of the unknown, morally\nsignificant properties, \\(R\\) and \\(W\\).  In this case\naction \\(A\\) is morally wrong to precisely the degree that it\ninitially appeared to be.\n\n\nThe upshot is that in this simplified example, at least three of the\nfour possibilities that we have considered are such that action\n\\(A\\) turns out to be morally wrong, all things considered.\nThe intuitive idea, then, is that if one has an action that, given\nonly its known rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, is an action\nthat it would be morally wrong to perform, then it is more likely than\nnot it is also an action that it would be morally wrong to perform,\ngiven the totality of its morally significant properties, both\nknown and unknown.\nBut what underlies this intuitive idea? The answer is a certain\nvery fundamental and very plausible equiprobability principle, to the\neffect that if one has a family of mutually exclusive properties, and\nif \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are any two members of that family, then\nthe a priori probability that something has property\n\\(P\\) is equal to the a priori probability that that\nthing has property \\(Q\\). For then given that principle, one can\nconsider the family of second order properties that contains the\nsecond-order property of being a rightmaking property and the\nsecond-order property of being a wrongmaking property, and then the\nequiprobability principle in question entails that the a\npriori probability that a given property \\(P\\) has the\nsecond-order property of being a rightmaking property is equal to the\na priori probability that property \\(P\\) has the\nsecond-order property of being a wrongmaking property. Similarly, if\none considers instead the family of properties that contains, for\nexample, the second-order property of being a rightmaking property of\nweight \\(W\\) and the second-order property of being a wrongmaking\nproperty of weight \\(W\\), the a priori probability that\na given property \\(P\\) has the first of those second-order\nproperties is equal to the a priori probability that property\n\\(P\\) has the second of those properties.\nThe upshot is that given an action that would be morally wrong if\njudged only by its known morally significant properties, every\npossibility of a combination of unknown rightmaking and wrongmaking\nproperties that would make that action morally right all things\nconsidered would be precisely counterbalanced by a combination of\nunknown rightmaking and wrongmaking properties that would make that\naction morally even more wrong, all things considered.  But, in\naddition, there can be combinations of unknown rightmaking and\nwrongmaking properties that would move an action in the\ndirection of being morally right all things considered, but not\nsufficiently far to make it morally right all things\nconsidered. Finally, there is the possibility that the action has no\nunknown morally significant properties.\n Consequently, if an action is one that it would be morally wrong\nto perform, if judged only by its known morally significant\nproperties, then it is more likely than not that it is one that it is\nmorally wrong to perform given the totality of its morally significant\nproperties, both known and unknown.\nThen, the probability that, judged in the light of all rightmaking\nand wrongmaking properties, known and unknown, it would not be morally\nwrong to allow the event in question must be less than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe upshot is that the probabilistic inference that is involved in the\nmove from statement (1) to statement (2) in the argument set out above\nin section 3.2.1 is inductively sound.\n\n3.5.2 The Formal Result\nHow is the formal calculation carried out? The answer is somewhat\ncomplicated, and there are slightly different ways of doing it, as in\n(Tooley 2008 and 2012b), with the method used in the latter case being\nperhaps slightly more perspicuous, but with both methods generating\nthe same result. The key in both cases, moreover, is to make\nassumptions that increase the probability that an action that is\nmorally wrong as judged only by its known rightmaking and wrongmaking\nproperties is morally right relative to the totality of its morally\nsignificant properties, both known and unknown. In the absence of\nthose \u2018probability-increasing\u2019 assumptions, it is not at\nall clear how the calculation could be carried out.\nIn the case where one focuses only upon a single action whose known\nwrongmaking properties outweigh its known rightmaking properties, the\nresult is as one would expect, namely, that the probability that the\naction in question is not morally wrong relative to the totality of\nits morally significant properties, both known and unknown, must be\nless than one half.\nBut what is the general result? Suppose, for example, that there\nare \\(n\\) events, each of which is such that, judged simply by\nknown rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, it would be morally\nwrong to allow that event. What is the probability that none\nof those \\(n\\) events is such that it would be morally wrong to\nallow that event, judged in the light of all rightmaking and\nwrongmaking properties, both known and unknown?\nThe answer is arrived at by proving the following theorem dealing\nwith the case where there are precisely \\(k\\) unknown morally\nsignificant properties:\nIf there are \\(k\\) unknown morally significant properties,\nthen given \\(n\\) events, each of which is such that, judged\nsimply by known rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, it would be\nmorally wrong to allow that event, the probability that none of those\nevents is such that it is morally wrong to allow that event, judged in\nthe light of all rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, known and\nunknown, must be less than \n\\[\n\\notag\n\\left( \\dfrac{k}{k+1} \\right) \\left( \\dfrac{1}{n+1} \\right) \\,.\n\\]\n\nAs one can see, this upper bound on the probability that it is not\nmorally wrong to allow any of the \\(n\\) events increases as \\(k\\),\nthe number of unknown morally significant properties, increases, and\nas \\(k\\) increases without limit, it will tend to the limit of\n\\(\\frac{1}{n+1}\\).\nOne therefore has the following theorem:\nGiven \\(k\\) events, each of which is such that,\njudged simply by known rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, it\nwould be morally wrong to allow that event, the probability that none\nof those events is such that it is morally wrong to allow that event,\njudged in the light of all rightmaking and wrongmaking properties,\nboth known and unknown, must be less than \\(\\frac{1}{n+1}\\).\n\n3.5.3 The Argument from Evil: A Quantitative Result\nThis approach arguably has two advantages over alternative accounts\nof the inductive step that lies at the heart of the argument from\nevil. One is that in bringing in an equiprobability principle, one is\napproaching the issue at a more fundamental level than any approach\nthat appeals either to instantial generalization or inference to the\nbest explanation. The other is that this approach generates a result that enables\none not just to conclude that it is more likely than not that God does\nnot exist, but also to assign an upper bound to the probability that\nGod exists.\nThe upper bound, moreover, is surely very low indeed, for of the\nbillions of people and sentient non-persons who have existed, the\nproportion who have had the good fortune never to have suffered in\nways such that the known wrongmaking properties of allowing such\nsuffering outweighed the known rightmaking properties must be small.\nAccordingly, \\(n\\) must be extremely large, and thus the\nprobability that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally\nperfect person must be very low indeed.\n4. Responses to the Argument from Evil: Refutations, Theodicies, and Defenses\n\nGiven an evidential formulation of the evidential argument from evil,\nwhat sorts of responses are possible? A natural way of dividing up\npossible responses is into what may be referred to as total\nrefutations, theodicies, and defenses. So let us begin by considering\nwhat is involved in these three different, general types of\nresponses.\n\nThis threefold classification can be arrived at by the following line\nof thought. An advocate of the argument from evil is claiming, in the\nfirst place, that there are facts about the evils in the world that\nmake it prima facie unreasonable to believe in the existence\nof God, and, in the second place, that the situation is not altered\nwhen those facts are conjoined with all the other things that one is\njustified in believing, both inferentially and non-inferentially, so\nthat belief in the existence of God is also unreasonable relative\nto the total evidence available, together with all relevant basis\nstates. In responding to the argument from evil, then, one might\nchallenge either of these claims. That is to say, one might grant, at\nleast for the sake of argument, that there are facts about evil that,\nother things being equal, render belief in God unreasonable, but then\nargue that when those considerations are embedded within one\u2019s total\nepistemic situation, belief in the existence of God can be seen to be\nreasonable, all things considered. Alternatively, one might defend the\nmore radical thesis that there are no facts about evil in the world\nthat make it even prima facie unreasonable to believe in the\nexistence of God.\n\n \nIf the latter thesis is correct, the argument from evil does not even\nget started.  Such responses to the argument from evil are naturally\nclassified, therefore, as attempted, total refutations of\nthe argument.\n\nThe proposition that relevant facts about evil do not make it even\nprima facie unreasonable to believe in the existence of God\nprobably strikes most philosophers, of course, as rather implausible.\nWe shall see, however, that a number of philosophical theists have\nattempted to defend this type of response to the argument from\nevil.\n\nThe alternative course is to grant that there are facts about\nintrinsically undesirable states of the world that make it prima\nfacie unreasonable to believe that God exists, but then to argue\nthat belief in the existence of God is not unreasonable, all things\nconsidered.  This response may take, however, two slightly different\nforms.  One possibility is the offering of a complete\ntheodicy.  As I shall use that term, this involves the\nthesis that, for every actual evil found in the world, one can\ndescribe some state of affairs that it is reasonable to believe\nexists, and which is such that, if it exists, will provide an\nomnipotent and omniscient being with a morally sufficient reason for\nallowing the evil in question.  \n\nIt should be noted here that the term \u201ctheodicy\u201d is\nsometimes used in a stronger sense, according to which a person who\noffers a theodicy is attempting to show not only that such morally\nsufficient reasons exist, but that the reasons cited are in fact\nGod\u2019s reasons.  Alvin Plantinga (1974a, 10; 1985a, 35) and\nRobert Adams (1985, 242) use the term in that way, but, as has been\npointed out by a number of writers, including Richard Swinburne\n(1988, 298), and William Hasker (1988, 5), that is to saddle the\ntheodicist with an unnecessarily ambitious program.\n\nThe other possibility is that of offering a defense.  But what is a\ndefense?  In the context of abstract, incompatibility versions of the\nargument from evil, this term is generally used to refer to attempts\nto show that there is no logical incompatibility between the\nexistence of evil and the existence of God.  Such attempts involve\nsetting out a story that entails the existence of both God and evil,\nand that is logically consistent.  But as soon as one focuses upon\nevidential formulations of the argument from evil, a different\ninterpretation is needed if the term is to remain a useful one, since\nthe production of a logically consistent story that involves the\nexistence of both God and evil will do nothing to show that evil does\nnot render the existence of God unlikely, or even very unlikely.\n\nSo what more is required beyond a logically consistent story of a\ncertain sort? One answer that is suggested by some discussions is\nthat the story needs to be one that is true for all we know.  Thus\nPeter van Inwagen, throughout his book The Problem of Evil,\nfrequently claims that various propositions are \u201ctrue for all\nwe know,\u201d and in the \u201cDetailed Contents\u201d section at\nthe beginning of his book, he offers the following characterization\nof the idea of a defense:\n\nThe idea of a \u201cdefense\u201d is introduced: that is, the idea of\na story that contains both God and all the evils that actually exist,\na story that is put forward not as true but as \u201ctrue for all anyone\nknows\u201d. (2006, xii)\n\nIt seems very unlikely, however, that its merely being the case that\none does not know that the story is false can suffice, since it may\nvery well be the case that, though one does not know that p\nis false, one does have very strong evidence that it is.  But if one\nhas strong evidence that a story is false, it is hard to see how the\nstory on its own could possibly counter an evidential argument from\nevil.\n It seems, accordingly, that some claim about the probability of\nthe story\u2019s being true is needed.  One possibility, suggested by some\ndiscussions, is that one might claim that rather than the story\u2019s\nbeing a remote possibility that has only a minuscule chance of being\ntrue, the story represents \u201ca real possibility\u201d, and so\nhas a substantial chance of being true. Thus, while Peter van Inwagen\nusually talks about his stories\u2019 being true for all anyone knows, he\nalso introduces the distinction between remote possibilities, and real\npossibilities (2006, Lecture 4, esp. pp. 66\u201371).\n\nIt is also hard to see, however, how this can be sufficient either.\nSuppose, for example, that one tells a story about God and the\nHolocaust, which is such that if it were true, an omnipotent being\nwould have been morally justified in not preventing the Holocaust.\nSuppose, further, that one claims that there is a twenty percent\nchance that the story is true.  A twenty percent chance is certainly\na real possibility, but how would that twenty percent chance\nundermine a version of the argument from evil whose conclusion was\nthat the probability that an omnipotent being would be justified in\nallowing the Holocaust was very low?\n\nGiven the apparent failure of the previous two suggestions, a natural\nconclusion is that the story that is involved in a defense must be\none that is likely to be true.  But if this is right, how does a\ndefense differ from a theodicy?  The answer is that while a theodicy\nmust specify reasons that would suffice to justify an omnipotent and\nomniscient being in allowing all of the evils found in the world, a\ndefense need merely show that it is likely that there are reasons\nwhich would justify an omnipotent and omniscient being in not\npreventing the evils that one finds in the world, even if one does\nnot know what those reasons are.  A defense differs from a theodicy,\nthen, in that a defense attempts to show only that some\nGod-justifying reasons probably exist; it does not attempt to specify\nwhat they are.\n\nThere is, however, one final possibility that needs to be considered.\nThis is the idea that what is needed in a defense is not a story that\ncan be shown to be likely to be true, but, rather, a story that, for\nall we know, is not unlikely.  The thought here is that, even if\nthere is some probability that the story has relative to our\nevidential base, we may not be able to determine what that\nprobability is, or even any reasonably delimited range in which that\nprobability falls.  If so, it cannot be shown that the story is likely\nto be true, but neither can it be shown that the story is unlikely to\nbe true.\n\nThe question that immediately arises is whether a proposition that\nwould undercut an inductive argument from evil if one knew it were true can\nundercut the argument if one is unable to assign any probability to the\nproposition\u2019s being true, and if so, how.  One thought might be that\nif one can assign no probability to a proposition, one should treat\nit as equally likely to be true as to be false.  But propositions\nvary dramatically in logical form: some are such as might naturally\nbe viewed as atomic, others are sweeping generalizations, others are\ncomplex conjunctions, and so on.  If one treated any proposition to\nwhich one could not assign a probability as equally likely to be true\nas to be false, the result would be an incoherent assignment of\nprobabilities.  On the other hand, if one adopts this idea only in\nthe case of atomic propositions, then given that stories that are\nadvanced in defenses and theodicies are typically quite complex,\nthose stories will wind up getting assigned low probabilities, and it\nis then unclear how they could undercut an inductive argument from\nevil.  \n5. Attempted Total Refutations\n\nThere are at least three main ways in which one might attempt to show\nthat the argument from evil does not succeed in establishing that\nevil is even prima facie evidence against the existence of\nGod, let alone that the existence of God is improbable relative to\nour total evidence. The first appeals to human epistemological\nlimitations; the second, to the claim that there is no best of all\npossible worlds; and the third, to the ontological argument.\n5.1 Human Epistemological Limitations\n\nThe most popular attempt at a total refutation of the argument from\nevil claims that, because of human cognitive limitations, there is no\nsound inductive argument that can enable one to move from the premise\nthat there are states of affairs that, taking into account only what\nwe know, it would be morally very wrong for an omnipotent and\nomniscient person to allow to exist, to the conclusion that there are\nstates of affairs such that it is likely that, all things considered,\nit would be morally very wrong for an omnipotent and omniscient\nperson to allow those states of affairs to exist.\n\nThe appeal to human cognitive limitations does raise a very important\nissue, and we have seen that one very natural account of the logical\nform of the inductive step in the case of a direct inductive argument\nis not satisfactory. But, as we have seen in sections 3.3 and 3.4,\nthere are other accounts of the type of reasoning involved in the\ncrucial inductive step in evidential forms of the argument from\nevil. First of all, the appeal to human cognitive limitations does\nnot itself show that there is anything wrong either with the\nreasoning that Draper offers in support of the crucial premise in his\nindirect inductive version of the argument from evil, or with the\ninference to the best explanation type of reasoning employed in the\nupdated version of Hume\u2019s indirect inductive formulation of the\nargument from evil. Secondly, the appeal to human cognitive\nlimitations provides no reason at all for rejecting the version of\nthe argument from evil that appeals to fundamental equiprobability\nprinciples of inductive logic, principles that arguably must obtain\nif any sort of induction is ever justified.\n\nShort of embracing compete inductive skepticism, then, it would seem\nthat an appeal to human cognitive limitations cannot provide an\nanswer to evidential versions of the argument from evil.\n5.2 The \u2018No Best of All Possible Worlds\u2019 Response\n\nA second way of attempting to show that the argument from evil does\nnot even get started is by appealing to the proposition that there is\nno best of all possible worlds. Here the basic idea is that if for\nevery possible world, however good, there is a better one,\nthen the fact that this world could be improved upon does not give\none any reason for concluding that, if there is an omnipotent and\nomniscient being, that being cannot be morally perfect.\n This response to the argument from evil has been around for quite\na while.  In recent years, however, it has been strongly advocated by\nGeorge Schlesinger (1964, 1977), and, more recently, by Peter Forrest\n(1981)\u2014though Forrest, curiously, describes the defense as one\nthat has been \u201cneglected\u201d, and refers neither to\nSchlesinger\u2019s well-known discussions, nor to the very strong\nobjections that have been directed against this response to the\nargument from evil.\n\nThe natural response to this attempt to refute the argument from evil\nwas set out very clearly some years ago by Nicholas La Para (1965)\nand Haig Khatchadourian (1966) among others, and it has been\ndeveloped in an especially forceful and detailed way in an article by\nKeith Chrzan (1987).  The basic thrust of this response is that the\nargument from evil, when properly formulated in a\ndeontological fashion, does not turn upon the claim that\nthis world could be improved upon, or upon the claim that it is not\nthe best of all possible worlds: it turns instead upon the claim that\nthere are good reasons for holding that the world contains evils,\nincluding instances of suffering, that it would be morally wrong, all\nthings considered, for an omnipotent and omniscient being to allow.\nAs a consequence, the proposition that there might be better and\nbetter worlds without limit is simply irrelevant to the argument from\nevil, properly formulated.\n If one accepts a deontological approach to ethics, this response\nseems decisive.  Many contemporary philosophers, however, are\nconsequentialists, and so one needs to consider how the \u2018no best\nof all possible worlds\u2019 response looks if one adopts a\nconsequentialist approach.\n Initially, it might seem that by combining the \u2018no best of\nall possible worlds\u2019 response with consequentialism, one can construct\na successful, total refutation.  For assume that the following things\nare true:\n\n An action is, by definition, objectively morally right if and only if it is,\namong the actions that one could have performed, at least one of the actions that\nproduces at least as much value as every alternative action;\n An action is objectively morally wrong if and only if it is not objectively morally\nright;\n One is morally blameworthy only if one performs some objectively wrong action when one could instead have performed an objectively right action;\n If one is an omnipotent and omniscient being, then for any action\nwhatever, there is always some other action that produces greater\nvalue.\n\n\nThen it follows that it is impossible for an omnipotent and\nomniscient being to perform a morally wrong action, and therefore\nthat the failure of such a being to prevent various evils in this\nworld cannot be morally wrong.\n\nConsider an omnipotent and omniscient being that creates a world with\nzillions of innocent persons, all of whom endure extraordinarily\nintense suffering forever.  If (1), (2), and (3) are right, then such\na being does not do anything morally wrong.  But this conclusion,\nsurely, is unacceptable, and so if a given version of\nconsequentialism entails this conclusion, then that form of\nconsequentialism must be rejected.\n Can consequentialism avoid this conclusion?  Can it be formulated\nin such a way that it entails the conclusion that allowing very great,\nundeserved suffering is morally very different, and much more serious,\nthan merely refraining from creating as many happy individuals as\npossible, or merely refraining from creating individuals who are not\nas ecstatically happy as they might be?  If it cannot, then it would\nseem that the correct conclusion to draw is that consequentialism is unsound.\nOn the other hand, if consequentialism can be so formulated that this\ndistinction is captured, then an appeal to consequentialism, thus\nformulated in a sound way, will not enable one to avoid the crucial objection to the\n\u2018no best of all possible worlds\u2019 response to the argument\nfrom evil.\n5.3 The Appeal to the Ontological Argument\n\nA final way in which one could attempt to show that facts about evil\ncannot constitute even prima facie evidence against the\nexistence of God is by appealing to the ontological\nargument. Relatively few philosophers have held, of course, that the\nontological argument is sound. But there have certainly been notable\nexceptions\u2014such as Anselm and Descartes, and, in the last\ncentury, Charles Hartshorne (1962), Norman Malcolm (1960), and Alvin\nPlantinga (1974a, 1974b)\n\nIf the ontological argument were sound, it would provide a rather\ndecisive refutation of the argument from evil. For in showing not\nmerely that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect\nbeing, but also that it is necessary that such a being exists, it would\nentail that the proposition that God does not exist must have\nprobability zero on any body of evidence whatever.\n The only question, accordingly, is whether the ontological\nargument is sound. The vast majority of present-day philosophers\nbelieve that it is not, and one way of arguing for that view is by\nappealing to strengthened Gaunilo-type objections\u2014where the idea\nbehind a strengthened Gaunilo-type objection is that, rather than\nmerely paralleling the ontological argument, as Gaunilo did in responding to\nAnselm, in order to show that there is an overpopulation problem for\nreality in the form of perfect islands, perfect unicorns, and so on,\none can instead construct versions that lead to mutually incompatible\nconclusions, such as the conclusion that there is a perfect solvent,\ntogether with the conclusion that there is a perfectly insoluble\nsubstance (Tooley, 1981). But if the logical form of the ontological\nargument is such that arguments of precisely the same form generate\ncontradictions, then the ontological argument must be unsound.\n A more satisfying response to the ontological argument would, of\ncourse, show not merely that the ontological argument is unsound, but\nalso precisely why it is unsound. Such a response, however, requires a\nsatisfactory account of the truth conditions of modal\nstatements\u2014something that lies outside the scope of this\narticle\n6. Attempted Defenses\n\nIn this section, we shall consider three attempts to show that it is\nreasonable to believe that every evil is such that an omnipotent and\nomniscient person would have a morally sufficient reason for not\npreventing its existence, even if one is not able to say, in every\ncase, what that morally sufficient reason might be.\n6.1 The Appeal to Positive Evidence for the Existence of God\n\nIf a given, concrete formulation of the argument from evil appeals to\ncases of intrinsically undesirable states of affairs that give rise\nonly to evidential considerations, rather than to an incompatibility\nconclusion, then, although the existence of God may be improbable\nrelative to that evidence, it may not be improbable relative to one\u2019s\ntotal evidence.  Theists, however, have often contended that there\nare a variety of arguments that, even if they do not prove that God\nexists, provide positive evidence.  May not this positive evidence\noutweigh, then, the negative evidence of apparently unjustified\nevils?\n\nStarting out from this line of thought, a number of philosophers have\ngone on to claim that in order to be justified in asserting that\nthere are evils in the world that establish that it is unlikely that\nGod exists, one would first have to examine all of the\ntraditional arguments for the existence of God, and show that none of\nthem is sound. Alvin Plantinga, for example, says that in order for\nthe atheologian to show that the existence of God is improbable\nrelative to one\u2019s total evidence, \u201che would be obliged to\nconsider all the sorts of reasons natural theologians have invoked\nin favor of theistic belief\u2014the traditional\ncosmological, teleological and ontological arguments, for\nexample.\u201d (1979, 3) And in a similar vein, Bruce Reichenbach\nremarks:\n\nWith respect to the atheologian\u2019s inductive argument from evil,\nthe theist might reasonably contend that the atheologian\u2019s\nexclusion of the theistic arguments or proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence advanced by the natural theologian has skewed the\nresults. (1980, 224)\n\n\nNow it is certainly true that if one is defending a version of the\nargument from evil that supports only a probabilistic conclusion, one\nneeds to consider what sorts of positive reasons might be\noffered in support of the existence of God. But Plantinga and\nReichenbach are advancing a rather stronger claim here, for they are\nsaying that one needs to look at all of the traditional theistic\narguments, such as the cosmological and the teleological.  They are\nclaiming, in short, that if one of those arguments turned out to be\ndefensible, then it might well serve to undercut the argument from\nevil.\n\nBut this view seems mistaken. Consider the cosmological argument.  In\nsome versions, the conclusion is that there is an unmoved mover.  In\nothers, that there is a first cause. In others, that there is a\nnecessary being, having its necessity of itself. None of these\nconclusions involves any claims about the moral character of the\nentity in question, let alone the claim that it is a morally perfect\nperson.  But in the absence of such a claim, how could such\narguments, even if they turned out to be sound, serve to undercut the\nargument from evil?\n\nThe situation is not essentially different in the case of the\nargument from order, or in the case of the fine-tuning argument. For\nwhile those arguments, if they were sound, would provide grounds for\ndrawing some tentative conclusion concerning the moral character of\nthe designer or creator of the universe, the conclusion in question\nwould not be one that could be used to overthrow the argument from\nevil.  For given the mixture of good and evil that one finds in the\nworld, the argument from order can hardly provide support even for\nthe existence of a designer or creator who is very good, let alone\none who is morally perfect.  So it is very hard to see how any\nteleological argument, any more than any cosmological, could overturn\nthe argument from evil.\n\nA similar conclusion can be defended with respect to other arguments,\nsuch as those that appeal to purported miracles, or religious\nexperiences.  For while in the case of religious experiences it might\nbe argued that personal contact with a being may provide additional\nevidence concerning the person\u2019s character, it is clear that the\nprimary evidence concerning a person\u2019s character must\nconsist of information concerning what the person does and does not\ndo. So, contrary to the claim advanced by Robert Adams (1985, 245),\neven if there were veridical religious experiences, they would not\nprovide one with a satisfactory defense against the argument from\nevil.\n\nA good way of underlining the basic point here is by setting out an\nalternative formulation of the argument from evil in which it is\ngranted, for the sake of argument, that there is an omnipotent and\nomniscient person.  The result of doing this is that the conclusion at which one initially arrives is not that there is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person, but rather that, although there is an omnipotent and omniscient person, that person is not morally perfect, from which it then follows that that there is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person.\n\nWhen the argument from evil is reformulated in that way, it becomes\nclear that the vast majority of considerations that have been offered\nas reasons for believing in God can be of little assistance to the\nperson who is trying to resist the argument from evil. For most of\nthem provide, at best, very tenuous grounds for any\nconclusion concerning the moral character of any omnipotent and\nomniscient being who may happen to exist, and almost none of them\nprovides any support for the hypothesis that there is an omnipotent\nand omniscient being who is also morally perfect.\n\nThe ontological argument is, of course, a notable exception, and,\nconsequently, the advocate of the argument from evil certainly needs\nto be able to show that it is unsound. But almost all of the other\nstandard arguments are simply not to the point.\n6.2 Belief in the Existence of God as Non-Inferentially Justified\n\n\nWhat if, rather than holding that there is positive evidence that\nlends support to the existence of God, one holds instead that the\nbelief that God exists is non-inferentially justified? The claim in\nquestion is an interesting one, and a thorough evaluation of it would\ninvolve consideration of some deep issues in epistemology.\nFortunately, it does not seem to make any real difference in the present\ncontext whether or not the claim is true.\n\nThe reason emerges if one considers the epistemology of perception.\nSome philosophers hold that some beliefs about physical objects are\nnon-inferentially justified, while others hold that this is never so,\nand that justified beliefs about physical states of affairs are\nalways justified via an inference to the best explanation that starts\nout from beliefs about one\u2019s experiences.  But direct realists as\nmuch as indirect realists admit that there can be cases where a\nperson would be justified in believing that a certain physical state\nof affairs obtained were it not for the fact that he has good\nevidence that he is hallucinating, or else subject to perceptual\nillusion.  Moreover, given evidence of the relevant sort, it makes no\ndifference whether direct realism is true, or indirect realism: the\nbelief in question is undermined to precisely the same extent in\neither case.\n\nThe situation is the same in the case of religious experience.  If,\nas was argued in the previous section, the primary evidence\nconcerning a person\u2019s character consists of what the person does or\nfails to do in various circumstances, and if, as a consequence,\nconclusions concerning the character of a deity based upon religious\nexperience can be undercut by the argument from evil, then nothing is\nchanged if one holds that the having of religious experiences, rather\nthan providing one with evidence for the existence of God, makes it\nthe case that one is non-inferentially justified in believing in the\nexistence of God. The non-inferential justification is merely a\nprima facie justification, and one that is undercut by\nevidence bearing upon a person\u2019s character that deals with what the\nperson does and does not do.\n6.3 Induction Based on Partial Success\n Swinburne (1988, 297\u20138) argued in support of the conclusion that\ntheism does need a theodicy. In doing so, however, he noted one minor\nqualification\u2014namely, that if one could show, for a sufficiently\nimpressive range of evils that initially seemed problematic, that it\nwas likely that an omnipotent and omniscient person would be morally\njustified in not having prevented them, then one might very well be\njustified in believing that the same would be true of other evils,\neven if one could not specify, in those other cases, what the morally\nsufficient reason for allowing them might be.\n What Swinburne says here is surely very reasonable, and I can see\nno objection in principle to a defense of this sort. The problem with\nit is that no theodicy that has ever been proposed has been successful\nin the relevant way\u2014that is, there is no impressive range of\nundesirable states of affairs where people initially think that the\nwrongmaking properties of allowing such states of affairs to exist\ngreatly outweigh any rightmaking properties associated with doing so,\nbut where, confronted with some proposed theodicy, people come to\nbelieve that it would be morally permissible to allow such states of\naffairs to exist. Indeed, it is hard to find any such cases, let alone\nan impressive range.\n7. Theodicies\n What are the prospects for a complete, or nearly complete\ntheodicy?  Some philosophers, such as Swinburne, are optimistic, and\nbelieve that \u201cthe required theodicy can be provided\u201d\n(1988, 311). Others, including many theists, are much less\nhopeful. Plantinga, for example remarks:\n\n\u2026 we cannot see why our world, with all its ills, would\nbe better than others we think we can imagine, or what, in\nany detail, is God\u2019s reason for permitting a given specific and\nappalling evil.  Not only can we not see this, we can\u2019t think of\nany very good possibilities.  And here I must say that most attempts\nto explain why God permits evil\u2014theodicies, as\nwe may call them\u2014strike me as tepid, shallow and ultimately\nfrivolous. (1985a, 35)\n\n\nWhat types of theodicies that have been proposed? An exhaustive\nsurvey is not possible here, but among the most important are\ntheodicies that appeal, first, to the value of acquiring desirable\ntraits of character in the face of suffering; secondly, to the value\nof libertarian free will; thirdly, to the value of the freedom to\ninflict horrendous evils upon others; and fourthly, to the value of a\nworld that is governed by natural laws.\n7.1 A Soul-Making Theodicy\n\nOne very important type of theodicy, championed especially by John\nHick, involves the idea that the evils that the world contains can be\nseen to be justified if one views the world as designed by God to be an\nenvironment in which people, through their free choices, can undergo\nspiritual growth that will ultimately fit them for communion with\nGod:\n\nThe value-judgement that is implicitly being invoked here is that one\nwho has attained to goodness by meeting and eventually mastering\ntemptation, and thus by rightly making responsibly choices in concrete\nsituations, is good in a richer and more valuable sense than would be\none created ab initio in a state either of innocence or of virtue. In\nthe former case, which is that of the actual moral achievements of\nmankind, the individual\u2019s goodness has within it the strength of\ntemptations overcome, a stability based upon an accumulation of right\nchoices, and a positive and responsible character that comes from the\ninvestment of costly personal effort. (1977, 255\u20136)\n\n\nHick\u2019s basic suggestion, then, is that soul-making is a great good,\nthat God would therefore be justified in designing a world with that\npurpose in mind, that our world is very well designed in that regard,\nand thus that, if one views evil as a problem, it is because one\nmistakenly thinks that the world ought, instead, to be a hedonistic\nparadise.\n Is this theodicy satisfactory? There are a number of reasons for\nholding that it is not. First, what about the horrendous suffering\nthat people undergo, either at the hands of others\u2014as in the\nHolocaust\u2014or because of terminal illnesses such as cancer? One\nwriter\u2014Eleonore Stump\u2014has suggested that the terrible\nsuffering that many people undergo at the ends of their lives, in\ncases where it cannot be alleviated, is to be viewed as suffering that\nhas been ordained by God for the spiritual health of the individual in\nquestion (1993b, 349). But given that it does not seem to be true\nthat terrible terminal illnesses more commonly fall upon those in bad\nspiritual health than upon those of good character, let alone that\nthey fall only upon the former, this \u2018spiritual\nchemotherapy\u2019 view seems quite hopeless. More generally, there\nseems to be no reason at all why a world must contain horrendous\nsuffering if it is to provide a good environment for the development\nof character in response to challenges and temptations.\n\nSecondly, and is illustrated by the weakness of Hick\u2019s own discussion (1977, 309\u201317), a soul-making theodicy provides no justification for the existence of any animal pain, let alone for a world where\npredation is not only present but a major feature of non-human animal\nlife, and has been so for millions of years. The world could perfectly well have contained only human persons, or only human persons plus herbivores.\n\nThirdly, the soul-making theodicy also provides no account of the suffering that young, innocent children endure, either because of terrible diseases, or at the hands of adults. For here, as in the case of animals, there is no soul-making purpose that is served.\n\nFinally, if one\u2019s purpose were to create a world that would be a good\nplace for soul-making, would our earth count as a job well done?  It\nis very hard to see that it would. Some people die young, before they\nhave had any chance at all to master temptations, to respond to\nchallenges, and to develop morally. Others endure suffering so great\nthat it is virtually impossible for them to develop those moral\ntraits that involve relationships with others. Still others enjoy\nlives of ease and luxury where there is virtually nothing that\nchallenges them to undergo moral growth.\n7.2 Free Will\n\nA second important approach to theodicy involves the following ideas:\nfirst, that libertarian free will is of great value; secondly, that\nbecause it is part of the definition of libertarian free will that an\naction that is free in that sense cannot be caused by anything\noutside of the agent, not even God can cause a person to freely do\nwhat is right; and thirdly, that because of the great value of\nlibertarian free will, it is better that God create a world in which\nagents possess libertarian free will, even though they may misuse it,\nand do what is wrong, than that God create a world where agents lack\nlibertarian free will.\n\nOne problem with an appeal to libertarian free will is that no\nsatisfactory account of the concept of libertarian free will is yet\navailable.  Thus, while the requirement that, in order to be free in\nthe libertarian sense, an action not have any cause that lies outside\nthe agent is unproblematic, this is obviously not a sufficient\ncondition, since this condition would be satisfied if the behavior in\nquestion were caused by random events within the agent. So one needs\nto add that the agent is, in some sense, the cause of the action. But\nhow is the causation in question to be understood? Present accounts\nof the metaphysics of causation typically treat causes as states of\naffairs. If, however, one adopts such an approach, then it seems that\nall that one has when an action is freely done, in the libertarian\nsense, is that there is some uncaused mental state of the agent that\ncausally gives rise to the relevant behavior, and why freedom, thus\nunderstood, should be thought valuable, is far from clear.\n The alternative is to shift from event-causation to what is\nreferred to as \u2018agent-causation\u2019. But then the question is\nwhether there is any satisfactory account of causation where causation\nis not a relation between states of affairs. Some philosophers, such\nas Timothy O\u2019Connor (1995, 1996, 2000a, 2000b, and 2002) and Randolph\nClarke (1993, 1996, and 2003) have claimed that such an account can be\ngiven, but their suggestions have not been widely accepted. \n\nBut even if the difficulty concerning the nature of libertarian free\nwill is set aside, there are still very strong objections to the\nfree-will approach. First, and most important, the fact that\nlibertarian free will is valuable does not entail that one should\nnever intervene in the exercise of libertarian free will. Indeed,\nvery few people think that one should not intervene to prevent\nsomeone from committing rape or murder. On the contrary, almost\neveryone would hold that a failure to prevent heinously evil actions\nwhen one can do so would be seriously wrong.\n\nSecondly, the proposition that libertarian free will is valuable does\nnot entail that it is a good thing for people to have the power to\ninflict great harm upon others. So individuals could, for example,\nhave libertarian free will, but not have the power to torture and\nmurder others.\n\nThirdly, many evils are caused by natural processes, such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes, and other weather conditions, and by a wide\nvariety of diseases.  Such evils certainly do not appear to result\nfrom morally wrong actions.  If that is right, then an appeal to free\nwill provides no answer to an argument from evil that focuses upon\nsuch evils.\n Some writers, such as C. S. Lewis and Alvin Plantinga, have\nsuggested that such evils may ultimately be due to the immoral actions\nof supernatural beings (Lewis, 1957, 122\u20133; Plantinga, 1974a, 58). If\nthat were so, then the first two objections mentioned above would\napply: one would have many more cases where individuals were being\ngiven the power\u2014much greater than the power that any human\nhas\u2014to inflict great harm on others, and then were being allowed\nby God to use that power to perform horrendously evil actions leading\nto enormous suffering and many deaths. In addition, however, it can\nplausibly be argued that, though it is possible that earthquakes,\nhurricanes, cancer, and the predation of animals are all caused by\nmalevolent supernatural beings, the probability that this is so is\nextremely low.\n7.3 The Freedom to Do Great Evil\n The fact that agents could be free in a libertarian sense even if\nthey did not have the power to inflict great harm upon others has led\nat least one philosopher\u2014namely, Richard Swinburne\u2014to\nargue that, while free will is valuable, precisely how valuable it is\ndepends upon the range of actions open to one. Swinburne\u2019s idea is\nthat if the possible actions that are open to one vary enormously in\nmoral worth, then libertarian free will is very valuable indeed,\nwhereas if the variation in the moral status of what one can do is\nvery limited, then libertarian free will adds much less to the world:\none has what has been characterized as a \u2018toy world\u2019, where one has\nvery little responsibility for the well-being of others.\nThis variant on the appeal to libertarian free will is also open to\na number of objections. First, as with free will theodicies in\ngeneral, this line of thought provides no justification for the\nexistence of occurrences that not only appear, upon cursory\ninspection, to be natural evils, uncaused by any agents, but where, in\naddition, the very closest scientific examination supports the\nconclusion that there are no grounds for postulating anything beyond\npurely physical events as the causes of the occurrences in\nquestion.\nSecondly, if what matters is simply the existence of alternative\nactions that differ greatly in moral value, this can be the case even in a\nworld where one lacks the power to inflict great harm on others, since\nthere can be actions that, rather than inflicting great suffering on\nothers, would instead benefit others enormously, and which one could\neither perform or intentionally refrain from performing.\nThirdly, what exactly is the underlying line of thought here? In\nthe case of human actions, Swinburne surely holds that one should\nprevent someone from doing something that would be morally horrendous,\nif one can do so. Is the idea, then, that while occasional prevention\nof such evils does not significantly reduce the extent of the moral\nresponsibility of others, if one\u2019s power were to increase, a point\nwould be reached where one should sometimes refrain from preventing\npeople from performing morally horrendous actions? But why should this\nbe so? One answer might be that if one intervened too frequently,\npeople would come to believe that they did not have the ability to\nperform such actions. But, in the first place, it is not clear why\nthat would be undesirable. People could still, for example, be\nthoroughly evil, for they could still very much wish that they had the power to\nperform such terrible actions, and be disposed to perform such actions\nif they ever came to have the power. In the second place, prevention\nof deeply evil actions could take quite different forms. People could,\nfor example, be given a conscience that led them, when they had\ndecided to cause great injury to others, and were about to do so, to\nfeel that what they were about to do was too terrible a thing, so that\nthey would not carry through on the action. In such a world, people\ncould surely still feel that they themselves were capable of\nperforming heinously evil actions, and they would contemplate\nperforming such actions, but in the end their sense of the great\nwrongness of the actions would triumph over their selfish reasons for\nwanting to perform the actions in question.\n\n7.4 The Need for Natural Laws\nA final important theodicy involves the following ideas: first, it\nis important that events in the world take place in a regular way,\nsince otherwise effective action would be impossible; secondly, events\nwill exhibit regular patterns only if they are governed by natural\nlaws; thirdly, if events are governed by natural laws, the operation\nof those laws will give rise to events that harm individuals; so,\nfourthly, God\u2019s allowing natural evils is justified because the\nexistence of natural evils is entailed by natural laws, and a world\nwithout natural laws would be a much worse world.\nThis type of theodicy is also exposed to serious objections. First\nof all, the occasional occurrence of miraculous intervention,\nincluding events that clearly appeared contrary to natural laws, would\nnot render effective human action impossible, since humans would see\nthat such miraculous occurrences were extremely rare.\nSecondly, and relatedly, consider a world where the laws of\nphysics, rather than being laws that admit of no exceptions, are\ninstead probabilistic laws. Effective human action would still be\npossible in such a world, provided that the relevant probabilities\nwere sufficiently high. But if so, then effective human action would\nbe no less possible in a world with non-statistical laws where there\nwere occasional miraculous interventions.\nThirdly, many of the greatest evils could have been prevented by\nmiraculous interventions that would not have been detected. Consider,\nfor example, interventions to prevent natural disasters such as\nvolcanic eruptions, or earthquakes, including the earthquake in China\nin 1556 that killed around 800,000 people, or tsunamis, such as the\none in 2004 that hit 12 Asian countries, and killed over 200,000\npeople. Or consider the interventions that would be needed to prevent\npandemics, such as the Black Death in the Middle Ages, which is\nestimated to have killed between 75 million and 200 million people, or\nthe 1918 flu pandemic, which killed between 50 million and 100 million\npeople.  Similarly, consider great moral evils, such as the\nHolocaust. A small intervention by an omnipotent, omniscient, and\nperfectly good being could have allowed one of the many failed attempts\nto assassinate Hitler to succeed, or a small mental nudge could have\nresulted in Hitler\u2019s realizing the error in his virulent\nanti-Semitism.\nFourthly, what natural evils a world contains depends not just on\nthe laws, but also on the initial, or boundary conditions. Thus, for\nexample, an omnipotent being could create ex nihilo a world\nwhich had the same laws of nature as our world, and which contained\nhuman beings, but which was devoid of non-human carnivores. Or the\nworld could be such that there was unlimited room for populations to\nexpand, and ample natural resources to support such populations.\nFifthly, many evils depend upon precisely what laws the world\ncontains. An omnipotent being could, for example, easily create a\nworld with the same laws of physics as our world, but with slightly\ndifferent laws linking neurophysiological states with qualities of\nexperiences, so that extremely intense pains either did not arise, or\ncould be turned off by the sufferer when they served no purpose. Or\nadditional physical laws of a rather specialized sort could be\nintroduced that would either cause very harmful viruses to\nself-destruct, or prevent a virus such as the avian flu virus from\nevolving into an air-born form that has the capacity to kill hundreds\nof million people.\nFinally, this theodicy provides no account of moral evil. If other\ntheodicies could provide a justification for God\u2019s allowing moral\nevil, then, of course, moral evil would not be a problem. But, as we\nhave seen, no satisfactory justification appears to be available.\n\n7.5 Religious Theodicies\nThe four types of theodicies considered so far all appeal to\nbeliefs and evaluative claims that the theodicist thinks should be\nacceptable, upon careful reflection, to anyone, including those who\nare not religious.  But if one thinks that one\u2019s religious beliefs are\nones that it is reasonable to accept, what is wrong with a theodicy\nthat appeals to some of one\u2019s religious beliefs? Of course, if the\nreligious beliefs to which one appeals, taken together, entail the\nexistence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person,\nsuch a theodicy would be question-begging. But one can choose a subset\nthat, even if it entails the existence of a very powerful and\nknowledgeable creator\u2014or even an omnipotent and omniscient\none\u2014does not entail the existence of God.\nThere are many religions, and even within a given religion, very\nsignificant differences in the religious beliefs of people, and very\ndifferent beliefs to which one might appeal, so there are many\ndifferent religious theodicies that can be constructed. Here I shall\nfocus only on one general type. I think, however, that it will\nillustrate the kinds of objections that arise.\nThe religious theodicy in question is as follows. First, human\nbeings, rather than having arisen through a process of natural\nevolution, were brought into existence by the creator of the\nuniverse. He placed the first two human beings in a perfect world,\nfree of suffering and death. Those human beings, however, freely chose\nto disobey a command of the creator, and the result was the Fall of\nmankind, which meant not only that the first two humans became subject\nto suffering and death, but that all of their descendants did so as\nwell.  The creator, however, lovingly engaged, several generations\nlater, in a rescue operation, in which he, in the person of his son,\nbecame incarnated as a human being, and by undergoing a sacrificial\ndeath, made it possible for the creator to forgive every human who\naccepted this sacrifice, and who would then enjoy eternal beatitude living in the\npresence of the creator.\nThis type of religious theodicy has been advanced by a number of\nChristians, with a variant of it being found, for example, in Peter\nvan Inwagen\u2019s book, The Problem of Evil (2006, 85ff.). It is\nnot, of course, a full theodicy, since it does not account for the\nsuffering of non-human animals, at least before the Fall. So let us\nfocus on it simply as offering an account of God\u2019s justification for\nallowing human suffering.  Thus viewed, how successful is it?\nTo be successful, a theodicy must appeal only to beliefs that it is\nreasonable to accept. Do the beliefs involved in the above story\nqualify? It would seem not. First of all, among the crucial beliefs\nis the belief that human beings, rather than coming into being via a\nnatural process of evolution, were specially created. In setting out\nthe story, I have not specified how that was done.  Traditionally\nChristians believed, either that Adam and Eve were created ex\nnihilo, as the story of creation in Genesis 1 seems to say, or\nelse, as the creation story in Genesis 2 says, that Adam was created\nout of the dust of the earth, and then Eve was formed, sometime later,\nout of one of Adam\u2019s ribs.\nThere are very good reasons for rejecting both of these accounts,\nsince the evidence that humans are descended from earlier primates is\nextremely strong indeed. Especially impressive is the evidence\nprovided by DNA studies, described by Daniel J. Fairbanks his book\nRelics of Eden, and which includes such as things as the\nevidence that human chromosome number two resulted by fusion from two\nprimate chromosomes, together with facts about (1) transposable\nelements, including retroelements, (2) pseudogenes, and (3)\nmitochondrial DNA.\nIn the light of such evidence, it is not surprising that many\nChristian philosophers have accepted the hypothesis of common descent,\nand have adopted some form of theistic evolution, in which the creator\nintervened at some point to transform some earlier primates into\nmembers of a new species, Homo sapiens. But while this version of\nspecial creation is an improvement, given the very close relations\nbetween human and chimpanzee DNA, and the fact that known mechanisms\nof chromosome rearrangement render the transition from some non-human\nspecies to Homo sapiens not at all improbable, the postulation of\ndivine intervention at that particular point does not seem\nplausible.\nIt would be a different matter, of course, if humans had immaterial\nminds, but there is very strong empirical evidence against that view,\nincluding such things as the effects of a blow to the head and brain\ndamage of different sorts, the effects of diseases such as\nAlzheimer\u2019s, the decline of mental capacities with aging, the\nrelations between the mental development of children and the growth of\nneural circuitry, the inheritance of personality traits, the different\ncorrelations in the case of identical twins versus fraternal twins\nwith regard to such traits as intelligence, the effects of\npsychotropic drugs, such as Prozac, and so on (Tooley, 2012,\n42\u20134).\nSecondly, the story postulates not just a special creation, but\nalso a special creation in which humans, initially, were not subject\nto suffering or death. Given, among other things, that that period was\na very short one, one cannot offer positive historical evidence again\nthe existence of such a short period that involved only two\nhumans. But the belief is surely a remarkable one that can be viewed\nas likely only if it is supported by evidence. The evidence that can\nbe offered, however, consists entirely of the creation story in\nGenesis, so that question is, how reliable is such evidence? To answer\nthat question, one can see what other stories one finds in\nGenesis. One striking story is that of Noah\u2014who apparently lived\naround 4500 years ago\u2014according to which there was a worldwide\nflood that killed all animals on Earth, except for those that were on\nthe ark. But there are excellent reasons for believing that such a\nstory is very unlikely to be true, both in the light of the number of\nanimal species that currently exist, and in the light of the\nevidence\u2014attempts by authors such as Whitcomb and Morris in\ntheir book The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its\nScientific Implications (1966) to argue otherwise\nnotwithstanding\u2014that there has not been any world-wide flood in\nthe past 5000 years.\nIn addition, those who view Genesis as a source of important truths\ndo so because it is part of the Bible.  So one can also ask about the\nreliability of the Bible when it testifies to remarkable events. In\nmany cases, of course, there is no way of checking whether those remarkable events actually took place, but when there is, one finds that there is good reason to believe that the event in\nquestion did not take place. Thus, for example, there is the story of\nthe sun\u2019s standing still for about a day during Joshua\u2019s battle at\nJericho, the story of the slaughter of all of the Egyptian first-born\nchildren, and the story of the graves being opened and the dead\nwalking around the city at the time of Jesus\u2019s death (Matthew 27:\n52\u201353). One would surely expect non-Biblical records of such events if\nthey had really taken place, but there are none.\nFinally, the religious theodicy that we are considering also\ninvolves a number of very problematic moral claims. First, we are\nasked to believe that there is nothing morally problematic about a\nmorally good deity making it the case that if one of the first two\nhumans disobeys some command, all of the many billions of descendants\nof that human will, as a consequence, be subject to suffering and\ndeath to which they would not otherwise be exposed. Secondly, we are\nalso asked to believe that a morally good deity is unable to forgive\npeople their misdeeds unless he becomes incarnate in the form of his\nson and suffers a sacrificial death. Thirdly, while, according to this story,\nthose who accept the sacrifice made on their behalf have all their\ntears wiped away and enjoy eternal happiness in the presence of God,\nthose who do not accept the sacrifice fare considerably less well, and\nsuffer eternal torment in hell. So we are being asked to believe that\nsuch eternal punishment is not morally problematic.\nIn short, the religious theodicy that we have been considering in\nthis section is very implausible, not only on scientific and\nhistorical grounds, but on moral grounds as well. The question,\naccordingly, is whether there is some religious theodicy that is not\nexposed to scientific, or historical, or moral objections.\n8. More Modest Variants on Defenses and Theodicies\n In section 1.3, it was argued that concrete formulations of the\nargument from evil, which focus upon specific evils, or else upon\nnarrowly defined types of evils, are superior to abstract formulations\nof the argument from evil, which start out from very general\nstatements concerning evil\u2014such as that there is evil in the\nworld, or that there are natural evils, or that there is an enormous\namount of evil, and so on.  Consider, then, an evidential argument\nfrom evil that focuses upon Rowe\u2019s famous case of Sue\u2014a young\ngirl who was brutally beaten, raped, and murdered.  Confronted with\nsuch a case, it is natural to think that a satisfactory response will\ninvolve arguing that it is plausible that the terrible occurrence in\nquestion itself has some hidden property that makes it the case that\nallowing it to happen is not morally wrong all things considered.\n But as Peter van Inwagen has argued\u2014most recently in The\nProblem of Evil\u2014there is a very different possibility, and one\nthat he thinks is much more promising.  The basic idea is as follows.\nFirst of all, one begins by focusing upon abstract formulations of the\nargument from evil, and one attempts to put forward a story that makes\nit plausible that the existence of, say, a great amount of horrendous\nsuffering in the world, is actually desirable because there is some\ngreat good that outweighs that suffering, and that can only be\nachieved if that amount of suffering is present, or some greater evil\nthat can only be avoided if that amount of suffering is present. (This\nstory might either be a theodicy-style story that specifies the great\ngood in question, or a defense-style story, which does not do so.)\nSecondly, if that story provides a satisfactory answer to an abstract\nversion of the argument from evil that focuses upon the existence of\nhorrendous suffering, one can then turn to concrete versions of the\nargument from evil, and there the idea will be that God had good\nreason to allow a certain amount of horrendous suffering, and the\nterrible case of Sue is simply one of the cases that he allowed.  It\nis not that Sue\u2019s suffering itself had some property that made its\noccurrence good all things considered.  God could very well have prevented it, and had he done so, he would have eliminated an\noccurrence that was bad in itself, all things considered.  But had he\ndone so, he would have had to have allowed some other horrendous evil\nthat, as things stand, he prevented, and the reason that he would have\nhad to do that would be to ensure that the global property of there\nbeing a certain amount of horrendous evil in the world was\ninstantiated\u2014something that was necessary to achieve a greater\ngood, or to avoid a greater evil.\n In short, defenses and theodicies that are based upon this idea,\nrather than appealing to the idea that apparent evils are not evils in\nthemselves, all things considered, once all local properties\u2014all\nproperties that those events themselves have\u2014are taken into\naccount, appeal, instead, to the idea that there are global properties\nwhose instantiation is important, and that can only be instantiated if\nthere are events that are evil in themselves.\nDoes this shift from local properties to global properties help? It\nwould seem that it cannot.  Consider against the case of Sue. An\nadvocate of the evidential argument from evil claims that no matter\nhow carefully one examines the case, and thinks about it, considering,\nas one does, all of the rightmaking and wrongmaking properties of\nwhich one has any knowledge, the conclusion is that the wrongmaking\nproperties of allowing what happened to Sue clearly outweigh any\nrightmaking properties of allowing that event.  The advocate of a\nglobal property approach then suggests the possibility that there is\nsome global rightmaking property that involves the world\u2019s having a\ncertain amount of evil, or a certain amount of a certain kind of evil,\nand that if someone had intervened to prevent the rape and murder of\nSue, this would have changed the world from one that did have the\ndesired amount of evil, or evil of the type in question, to one that\ndoes not, and that when this property is taken into account, it turns\nout that it would have been wrong to prevent Sue\u2019s being raped and\nmurdered\u2014unless one was going to allow some compensating evil\nelsewhere.\nBut what exactly is the global wrongmaking property in question?\nDoes one know, or even have any reason at all for believing, that\nbringing it about that the amount of evil of kind \\(K\\) is less than some\nspecific amount \\(T\\) is a wrongmaking property of actions?  The answer,\nsurely, is that no one has knowledge of any such wrongmaking\nproperty. Moreover, anyone who claimed to have such knowledge would\nalso have to claim also to know that if an omnipotent and omniscient\nbeing had prevented the rape and murder of Sue, without also allowing\nsome other, compensating evil action, that would have caused the\namount of evil of type \\(K\\) to dip below level \\(T\\).\nOne need not, of course, advance a principle involving some\nspecific value of \\(T\\). One could, instead, make the existential claim\nthat there is some level \\(T\\) such that, first, it is a wrongmaking\nproperty of an action to cause the amount of evil of type \\(K\\) to dip\nbelow level \\(T\\), and, second, that if an omnipotent and omniscient being\nhad intervened to prevent the rape and murder of Sue, that would, in\nthe absence of some compensating action, have caused the amount of\nevil of type \\(K\\) to dip below level \\(T\\). But surely no one knows, or even\nhas any reason for believing, that this is the case.\nThe situation as regards an appeal to global properties is, in\nshort, as follows.  An advocate of the argument from evil points to\nvarious events, such as the rape and murder of Sue, and claims that no\nmatter how carefully one considers the case, one\u2019s conclusion is that\nthe known wrongmaking properties of not preventing that occurrence\noutweigh any rightmaking properties that not preventing the occurrence\nis known to have had.  In response, the possibility of a relevant,\nmorally significant global property is introduced.  But this is a mere\npossibility, since there is no relevant morally significant global\nproperty of which one has knowledge, let alone which one has good\nreason to believe is present in the case in question.  So the\npossibility of a relevant global property is simply that: a mere\npossibility, and as such it gets dealt with in the way that all\nunknown morally significant properties, both rightmaking and\nwrongmaking, and both local and global, are dealt with in, for example,\nthe logical probability version of the evidential argument from evil\nset out above in section 3.5.\n",
