    "main_text": "The Subjugation of Women || Historical origins\n3.2 Historical origins\n\nPoulain\u2019s finely tuned analysis of the psychological aspects of\noppression is combined with a robust analysis of the historical origin\nof the prejudiced opinion that women are inferior to men. He explains\nthat we need to trace the prejudiced opinion about women \u201cback\nto its origin\u201d and that would\n\n\ninvolve evaluating what was done in earlier times by reference to\ncurrent practices, and judging ancient customs by comparison with\nthose that we see developing in our own day. If we had followed that\nrule, we would not have fallen into so many mistakes in innumerable\njudgments. And, in respect of the current condition of women, we would\nhave recognized that they were dominated only by the law of the\nstrongest, and that it was not because of a lack of natural capacity\nor merit on their part that they failed to share the advantages that\ngive men a superior position in society. (T1en 126; TTfr\n63\u201364)\n\n\nAccording to Poulain, the law of the stronger (la Loi du plus\nfort) is in several respects arbitrary. He emphasizes that with\nthe exception for the dependence of children upon their parents,\ndependence \u201cis a purely physical or civil relation\u201d and it\nshould be \u201cconsidered only as an effect of change, violence, or\ncustom\u201d (T1en 153; TTfr 95). As argued by Stuurman, Poulain can\nhave been influenced by Thomas Hobbes\u2019 views about the\nartificial nature of political power (Stuurman 2004: 177\u2013178).\nInequality is not natural and neither is the male sex oppressive by\nnature. Poulain explicitly rejects the idea that men, when they\nusurped power over women, were \u201cdriven by some hidden\ninstinct\u2014that is, by a general command of the author of\nnature\u2014to act in this way\u201d (T1en 126; TTfr 63). God has\nnot made men oppressive. From the arbitrary nature of the power\nrelation between the sexes follows also that \u201cwomen might have\n[favored their sex] had they been in a similar situation\u201d (T1en\n152; TTfr 95). Neither sex is by its nature oppressive or\nsubmissive.\n\nPoulain does not deny that men are, on an average, physically stronger\nthan women or that \u201cthe interruptions of pregnancy and its\nafter-effects reduced the strength of women for periods of time\u201d\nand made them dependent on \u201ctheir husbands\u2019\nassistance\u201d (T1en 127; TTfr 65). This was not a problem, though,\nas long as \u201cfamilies consisted of just a mother, a father, and a\nfew small children\u201d but it became problematic when families\nexpanded into larger units, when household chores became more\ndiversified and all family members submitted to the rule of the father\n(T1en 127\u2013128; TTfr 65).\n\nPoulain is committed to the idea of an original golden age, preceding\nthe present diversified society, and he emphasizes the idea of\noriginal liberty in particular in his third treatise De\nl\u2019excellence des hommes, where he also describes the\nprocess through which natural liberty was lost. He explains that\nwhen\n\n\nsome men took advantage of their strength and their leisure to try to\nsubjugate others, the golden age of liberty gave way to an iron age of\nservitude. Self-interest and wealth were so bound together through\ndomination that it became impossible not to have to depend on others.\nThis combination increased in proportion to the distance from the\nstate of innocence and peace, giving rise to greed, ambition, vanity,\nextravagance, idleness, pride, cruelty, tyranny, deceit, schisms,\nwars, chance, worries\u2014in short, all the infirmities of mind and\nbody that afflict us. (TTen 313; TTfr 392)\n\n\nLike Jean-Jacques Rousseau after him, Poulain connects the origins of\ninequality to wealth and the dependence on others that follows from an\nincreasing division of labor. This historical process does not only\ngive raise to unequal material conditions, it is also the origin of\nnegative emotions such as greed, pride and cruelty. The tyranny of men\nover women has the same historical origin. In De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 Poulain describes how the original\nvoluntary dependence between husband and wife becomes subjugation when\nwars forced women \u201cto accept as husbands unknown strangers who\nconsidered them merely as the most beautiful part of their\nbooty\u201d (T1en 128; TTfr 66). The commodification of women is\nthus, according to Poulain, an integral part of the historical\norigin of inequality.\n\nPoulain\u2019s understanding of the difference between the original\nharmony of mother, father and a few children and the oppression of\nwomen in developed societies is further illuminated by his remarks on\nthe difference between marriage and political society. In De\nl\u2019excellence he compares political society and the\n\u201csociety of marriage [which] is composed only of two persons, of\nwhom one, therefore, cannot use authority and coercion towards the\nother\u201d (TTen 280; TTfr 313). Poulain argues that marriage does\nnot require a hierarchical division of power because it is \u201cnot\nfounded on fear, but on love\u201d (ibid.). Marriage can thus be\nbased directly on the natural equality of wife and husband, without\neither of them usurping power over the other, whereas a society of\nthree or more people, where one is \u201cable to join forces with\nanother to force the third to abide\u201d, requires submission to\nlaws and sovereigns, otherwise people will \u201cbe constantly at\nwar\u201d (ibid). In order to avoid war and tyranny established\nthrough war, political society requires sovereign power, but like\nHobbes, Poulain emphasizes that the right to command \n\n\ndoes not belong naturally to any one person more than to another,\nsince it consists in the voluntary submission of those who give it to\nthe one who is vested with it. (ibid.) \n\n\nBoth marriage and political rule must thus acknowledge that human\nbeings are naturally equal, even if political society cannot be based\non natural equality in the same direct manner as marriage\ncan\u2014and was, according to Poulain, during the golden age of\nliberty, before the arbitrary subjugation of women.\n",
