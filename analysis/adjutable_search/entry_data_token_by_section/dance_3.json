    "main_text": "Dance as Agency and Intentional Action\n2. Dance as Agency and Intentional Action\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this entry, dance philosophers\nvary in terms of where within dance practice and performance they\nwould like to focus their attention. Many philosophers who focus on\ndance as agency and intentional action are looking at the expert\naction involved in dance as art, although some consider agency and\nintentionality in social or other forms of dance. It is also the case\nthat when considering dance as a form of expert action (akin to\nsports, say) that often technical and athletic prowess as well as\nartistic skills like expressivity or grace are the focus on analysis\n(see, e.g., Montero 2016). Among these are philosophers of art who are\ninterested in questions of dance work identity, for purposes of\nhistorical identification and reconstruction among others. These, like\nMcFee (2018), treat dance-relevant actions as part of what is needed\nto create and instantiate a dance work of art (dancework) with the\nfocus being on the structure created by these actions. (For more on\nMcFee\u2019s account of dance and action see McFee 2011b, 2018 and forthcoming.)\n\nAnother traditional way, besides those mentioned in\n Section 1,\n that dance philosophers in analytic aesthetics have considered the\nquestion \u201cwhat is dance?\u201d is to characterize dance as a\nparticularly expressive form of art, or one that involves\n\u201caction\u201d in a particular way. Dance historian Selma Jean\nCohen (1962) has held that expressiveness is present in all dance, for\nexample, causing Monroe C. Beardsley (1982) to posit that\nexpressiveness might be a necessary if not sufficient condition for\ndance as art. Borrowing from action theory, Beardsley says that one\nbodily action can, under the right circumstances, be sortally\ngenerated into another kind of action. Thus, the act of running, can,\nunder the right circumstances, be expressive and part of the art of\ndance accordingly. We can also infer here that other conditions of\ndance as art might also apply (being on a stage in a theater, being\noffered for appreciation as a dance, conducted in ways that are part\nof a dance vocabulary, etc.). In making this claim, Beardsley rejects\nHaig Khatchadourian\u2019s view (1978) that dance movements are not\nactions, crediting Van Camp\u2019s Philosophical Problems of\nDance Criticism (1981) for helping him to critique Khatchadourian\nin this way. (See Meskin 1999 for more on dances as action sequences\nrather than mere movements; See Carroll and Banes 1982 for a critique\nof Beardsley\u2019s theory of dance as expressive action.)\n\nSusanne K. Langer (1953b) holds that dance is an art that is in\nessence a symbol-making endeavor but she does not call this activity\n\u201caction.\u201d For Langer dance\u2019s products are symbols\nbut these are a sort of coalescence and transforming of real\nactivities into a virtual (\u201cartistic\u201d) form. For Langer,\ndance\u2019s special symbol or \u201cprimary illusion\u201d is what\nshe calls \u201cvirtual power\u201d or gesture rather than virtual\ntime (the symbol for music), virtual space (the symbol for the plastic\narts) or the illusion of life (the symbol for poetry, when it is in\nwords and for drama when it is presented in the mode of action). Thus,\nher view departs from Beardsley\u2019s here significantly. Instead,\nit seems more in line with that of Graham McFee (2018), who holds that\ndance is \u201cembodied meaning.\u201d McFee is presumably following\nArthur C. Danto\u2019s 1981 account of art in The Transfiguration\nof the Commonplace here but since Danto was Langer\u2019s\nstudent she may have been the ultimate genesis of this idea. (For\nMcFee\u2019s view of dance as action see\n Section 2\n of this entry.)\n\nAnna Pakes\u2019 view of dance as action is in line with that of\nBeardsley and Van Camp, against Khatchadourian and Langer. She (2013)\nagrees that action is a necessary feature of dance. Both Aaron Meskin\n(1999) and Pakes suggest that it is the embodiment of dance in a\nphysical, intentional event that makes dances better construed as\naction-structures than as eternal types. It is for this reason (among\nothers) that they find dance to be ill-suited for analysis under a\nPlatonic ontology of art in which the structure of the work of art is\ndiscovered rather than created. Sondra Horton Fraleigh (1996) can be\nplaced on Pakes and Meskin\u2019s side here, since she holds that\ndance is necessarily expressive and transitive action.\n\nThere are other contemporary dance philosophers, some working within\nthe analytic tradition and some not, who treat the minded agency and\naction involved in either choreography, performing dance, or both, as\nprimary areas of dance interest as well. Often these are connected to\nnormative, epistemic and ontological commitments about what dance is\nand why it matters (David Davies (2004), for example, treats all art,\nincluding dance art, as performance). Many of these philosophers (such\nas Bresnahan 2014a, 2017a, and 2019b; Merritt 2015; and Montero 2016)\nuse both traditional philosophy, in the forms of analytic philosophy\nand phenomenological philosophy, and insights from research in the\ncognitive sciences as aids in their analysis. (For more on dance\nphilosophy and its connections to cognitive science see\n Section 4.\n See also\n Section 3.3 for a discussion of dance\nas expertise.)\n\nThere is also a great deal of literature on agency and intentional\naction in dance philosophy, which focuses on the thinking and embodied\nactivities that take place in the studio or on the stage or other\nperformance contexts as well as literature on the agency and\nactivities of audience members or appreciators who are not also\ndancers and dance-makers. (For more dance philosophy literature on\ndance agency and intentional action see D. Carr 1987; J. Carr 2013;\nBunker, Pakes and Rowell 2013; Noland 2009; and Sheets-Johnstone 1981,\n1999, 2011, and 2012.)\n",
