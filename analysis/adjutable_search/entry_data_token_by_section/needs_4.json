Skepticism about Needs and Common Response Strategies\n\n\nMany kinds of concerns have been raised about needs playing an\nimportant role in moral and political philosophy. We might divide\nthese into two main categories. The first category focuses on whether\nor not we can identify clear criteria for determining needs,\nin particular those needs that are capable of playing such a role.  In\nthe second category the common theme is the inadequacy of need as a\nguide to our moral or political obligations. In the first part of this\nsection we canvass some of these common concerns and in section 2.3\nreview some common response strategies.\n",
