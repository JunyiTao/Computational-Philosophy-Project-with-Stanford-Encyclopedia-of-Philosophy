Theory of the Historical World\n\n\nIt is clear that Nishida proposed his various topoi not as static\ncontexts terminating in an ultimate genus, but rather as a dynamic\nprocess of contextualization or world-formation. This always implied\nthe temporality of the \u201cself-aware\u201d world, and not merely\ntime as a dimension of the physical world.  Nevertheless, Nishida did\nnot explicitly take account of the historical nature of the world\nuntil the early 1930s, after his critics, in particular his younger\ncolleague, Tanabe Hajime, and his former students, Miki Kiyoshi and Tosaka Jun, turned his\nattention to the historical dimension of reality and human action. The\ncritics suggested that Nishida ignored the world determined by\nindividual human action by replacing individual human subjectivity\nwith trans-individual experience or consciousness and eventually\nshifting human agency to the world as a universal. In response,\nNishida began to articulate the world as a dialectical universal. The\nbasic idea is that the world is a place of mediation between acting\nindividuals. It is not a transcendent topos that one-sidedly\ndetermines individuals but a topos that arises with them through their\ncreative interactions. There are two sides of this idea to consider:\nthe world and the interacting individuals.\n\n\nWe conceptualize the formation of the world as history, but must think\nof history in terms of the logic of place and not simply as a temporal\nprocess. At any moment the world in process mirrors the indeterminacy or openness\nof absolute nothingness and contains the conditions for novelty and\nfuture possibilities; however it also encompasses everything that has\nalready been determined. In Nishida\u2019s words, the historical world\nproceeds \u201cfrom the created to the creating.\u201d And it so\nproceeds not in a linear fashion, as if viewed from some point outside\nthe world, but rather \u201cin\u201d every moment or, conversely,\nout of an \u201ceternal now\u201d or \u201cabsolute present\u201d\nthat describes the topos of its continual creation. This present in\nits absolute presence is the place where history can happen precisely\nbecause it enfolds the past, though is not entirely determined by the\npast, and it holds the future as infinite possibility. It is eternal or\nabsolute in the sense that it contains infinite time by negating\n(fixed) time (NKZ VIII, 76ff.). Viewed in terms of the absolute\npresent\u2014the ever-present juncture between a determined past and\nan open future\u2014the world appears as a \u201ccontinuity of\ndiscontinuities.\u201d\n\n\nSimilarly, we conceptualize the historical world sometimes as produced\nout of nature by human work and activity, sometimes as producing the\nindividuals who interact in it, but we should think of it primarily as\nthe mediating place of interactive creation. Individuals create their\nidentities through their interactions in the world, and that world is\ncontinually created with them.  (Nishida\u2019s idea of a mediating place\nfinds a distant analogue in Einstein\u2019s theory of gravitational space,\nwhere space is not independent of the physical objects in it but\nrather is shaped by them). The historical world forms itself through\nthe actions of embodied individuals who mutually form each other. Adapting a phenomenological perspective, Nishida argues that the historical world as the most concrete topos of our reality must be the starting point for understanding the more abstract world of life and even more abstract natural world.\n\n\nGradually Nishida came to recognize the importance of embodiment for\nhuman interaction and communication, and introduced the notion of the\nexpressive or historical body. The body is not primarily a physical\nobject and product of the natural world, but a historical subject and\nco-creator of the world. Insofar as the many historical bodies of the\none world differ from each another, they too form a\n\u201cdiscontinuous continuity.\u201d Nishida was fond of calling\nthis type of totality, which holds together differences without sublating\nthem into a higher unity, a \u201cself-identity of contradictories.\u201d\n\n\nTwo parts of Nishida\u2019s theory deserve further explication: his novel\nconception of enactive intuition and his explanation of the relations\nbetween self & other and one & many.\n",
