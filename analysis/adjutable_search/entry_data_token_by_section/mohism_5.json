    "main_text": "Political Theory\n6. Political Theory\n\n\nMohist political thought begins with a distinctive, fascinating\nstate of nature account of the origin and justification of the state.\nUnlike Hobbes\u2019s well-known scenario, the Mohist myth depicts violent\nsocial disorder as resulting not from individuals\u2019 untrammeled pursuit\nof self-interest in conditions of scarcity, but from disagreement about\nvalues. People\u2019s primary motivation is not self-interest, but their\ndiverse, individual conceptions of yi (morality,\nrighteousness).[11]\n Individuals all tend to do what they think\nis right; the problem is that everyone disagrees about what that is.\nSince for the Mohists yi is inherently social and shared, each\nperson condemns values different from her own as morally wrong. The\nplurality of moral standards thus leads to contention, belligerence,\nand wasted resources. For simplicity, we will quote mainly from the\nfirst of the three versions of the theory, which describes the state of\nprimal anarchy in this way:\nOur Master Mozi stated, In antiquity, when people first\narose, before there were penal codes and government, probably the\nsaying was, \u201cPeople have different norms of righteousness\n(yi).\u201d Hence for one person, one norm; for two people, two\nnorms; for ten people, ten norms\u2014the more people, the more too\nthe things they called \u2018righteous\u2019. Hence people deemed\ntheir norm right and by it deemed others\u2019 norms wrong, so in\ninteracting they deemed each other\u2014wrong. Thus, inside the\nfamily, fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers became resentful\nand scattered, unable to remain together with each other\npeacefully. The people of the world all injured each other with water,\nfire, and poison. It reached the point that, having surplus strength,\nthey couldn\u2019t use it to labor for each other; letting surplus\nresources rot, they didn\u2019t share them with each other; and concealing\ngood dao (ways), they didn\u2019t teach them to each other. The\ndisorder (luan) in the world was like that among the birds\nand beasts.  (Book 11, \u201cIdentifying Upward\u201d)\n\n\nThe root of this chaos, as the Mohists see it, is the absence of\npolitical leaders who will unify moral standards and thus put an end to\ncontention and animosity. The solution is to install a wise, virtuous\nsovereign who will establish unified moral norms and thus bring order\n(zhi, pronounced \u201cjr\u201d) to society.\nIt was understood that the people lacked government\nleaders to unify the world\u2019s norms of righteousness, and so the world\nwas in disorder. Thus the most worthy, sagely, and intelligent person\nin the world was chosen, established as the Son of Heaven, and\ncommissioned to work to unify the world\u2019s norms of righteousness\n(yi). (Book 12, \u201cIdentifying\nUpward\u201d)\n\n\nThe texts do not explain how the ruler is selected, nor, given their\ndifferences, how people manage to agree on who qualifies as the most\nworthy candidate. No social contract is envisioned. Instead, the\nsovereign\u2019s legitimacy seems to rest on an implicit, utilitarian\nconsensus that social order is a paramount value, one that can be\nachieved only by establishing centralized political leadership that\nwill impose unified moral standards. The texts pass over the question\nof how, given this shared commitment to utilitarian social order, the\npeople developed such diverse conceptions of morality in the first\nplace.\n\n\nFor the Mohists, then, the purpose of government is to achieve a\nstable social order by promulgating a unified conception of morality.\nThe central task of the state is moral education, training everyone to\nreliably conform to the same moral standards in judgment and action.\nThis is the basis for such other aims as national defense, public\nsecurity, economic management, and social welfare. The responsibility\nof the state for moral education is a distinctive theme of classical\nChinese thought, prominent in both Mohism and Confucianism and much\ncriticized in Daoist texts.\n\n\nTo assist him in unifying the world\u2019s morality, the sovereign, or\n\u201cSon of Heaven,\u201d appoints three dukes, who help him to divide the world\ninto myriad states and appoint a lord for each. These lords in\nturn appoint other officials down to the level of the district,\nvillage, or clan head, until a complete hierarchical political system\nis established. Then the work of unifying moral standards begins. The\nmain technique adopted for this task is model\n emulation.[12]\n People are ordered to \u201cidentify upward\u201d with the moral judgments\narticulated by their political superiors and not to ally together\nbelow. This moral guidance is reinforced by social and behavioral\nincentives. Those who conform and do good are praised, rewarded, and\npromoted; those who do not are censured and punished. For the Mohists,\nrewards and punishments are justified instrumentally, by their role in\nencouraging good behavior and discouraging bad.\n\n\n\nOnce the government leaders were in place, the Son of Heaven issued a\ngovernment policy to the people of the world, stating, \u201cHearing\nof good and bad, in all cases report it to your superiors. What\nsuperiors deem right (shi), all must deem right; what\nsuperiors deem wrong (fei), all must deem wrong. If superiors\ncommit errors, admonish them; if subordinates do good, recommend\nthem. Identify upward and don\u2019t align together below. This is what\nsuperiors will reward and subordinates will praise.\u201d \n \u201cOr, if you hear of good and bad but don\u2019t report it to\nsuperiors; are unable to deem right what superiors deem right; are\nunable to deem wrong what superiors deem wrong; don\u2019t admonish\nsuperiors when they commit errors; don\u2019t recommend subordinates when\nthey do good; align together below and don\u2019t identify upward, this is\nwhat superiors will punish and the people will denounce.\u201d (Book\n11, \u201cIdentifying Upward\u201d)\n\n\n\nOfficials on each level of the political hierarchy repeat a variant\nof these instructions to their subordinates, urging them to model\nthemselves on the good example set by the judgments, speech, and\nconduct of the leader on the next level up. Moral wisdom and a virtuous\ncharacter are thus crucial qualifications for political leadership.\nThus the village head was the most benevolent man in the\nvillage. The village head issued a government policy to the people of\nthe village, stating, \u201cHearing of good and bad, you must report\nit to the district head. What the district head deems right\n(shi), all must deem right; what the district head deems\nwrong (fei), all must deem wrong. Eliminate your bad\nstatements and learn the good statements of the district head;\neliminate your bad conduct and learn the good conduct of the district\nhead. Then how could the district be in disorder?! Examine what put\nthe district in order (zhi): it\u2019s just that the district head\nwas able to unify the district\u2019s norms of righteousness (yi),\nand hence the district was in order.\u201d (Book 11,\n\u201cIdentifying Upward\u201d)\n\n\nThe village head leads his village to emulate the district head, who\nin turn leads his district to emulate the lord of the state. The lords\nof states lead their people to emulate the Son of Heaven, who brings\norder to all under heaven. The Son of Heaven is still fallible,\nhowever, and so cannot be the highest moral paragon. Above him is\nHeaven (Tian), to which the people must ultimately conform. In\nthe Mohist myth, politics is not distinct from ethics and religion, and\nunlike in Hobbes, the sovereign\u2019s power is not absolute, for he must\nanswer to independent moral standards.\nIf the people of the world all identify upward with the\nSon of Heaven but don\u2019t identify upward with Heaven, then disasters\nstill will not go away. Now if in the heavens whirlwinds and bitter\nrain come again and again, this is how Heaven punishes the people for\nnot identifying upward with Heaven.  (Book 11, \u201cIdentifying\nUpward\u201d)\n\n\nA distinctive feature of the theory is that, as might be expected\nfrom the practical orientation of Mohist thought, moral education is\nregarded as akin to teaching a practical skill, such as how to speak a\nlanguage. It is accomplished primarily by emulating the judgments and\nconduct of moral exemplars, specifically how they distinguish right\n(shi) from not (fei) and act accordingly. The basic\nsource of moral guidance is thus practical training in social norms,\nwhich people are expected to master and extend to new cases. As in\nlanguage learning, social superiors teach chiefly not by dictating\nrules or instructions, but by setting an example to be emulated and\nthen praising or correcting the learner\u2019s performance. Of course,\nsometimes they will set forth explicit fa (models, rules), as\nwhen the Son of Heaven issues the original order for everyone to\nidentify upward. But moral education is not seen primarily as a matter\nof inculcating knowledge of rules, theoretical knowledge of the good,\nnor the reflective habit of testing the maxims on which one acts\nagainst the moral law. It is seen mainly as a kind of skill training.\nThe outcome of such training will be virtues, reliable dispositions to\ndistinguish right from not correctly in speech and action. As we saw\nearlier, such dispositions constitute the Mohists\u2019 basic conception of\nknowledge.\nCritical Assessment\n\n\nAspects of the Mohist political system are plausible and\npsychologically insightful. Consensus in moral judgments is indeed\nlikely to yield social order, and moral education is probably a more\neffective device for ensuring compliance with ethical standards than\nlaws and punishments alone. Most people probably are motivated to do\nwhat they think is right, and moral education may be an effective tool\nfor channeling their good intentions. Model emulation is indeed a\npowerful educational process, as any parent knows, and many of our\nvalues and judgments are in fact learned by following the example of\nadmired role models. Social coherence, peer pressure, and the approval\nof superiors are important motivational factors even for critical,\nreflective adults. The system might succeed in achieving a high degree\nof social order and stability, which would benefit everyone in society.\nThe Mohists\u2019 state of nature myth thus provides at least a prima\nfacie instrumental justification of their vision of the state.\n\n\nYet the system\u2019s authoritarian bent raises serious worries. The\nsuccess of the system depends heavily on the moral character of the\nrulers. What if their judgment is wrong or misinformed? How can they\nbe prevented from abusing their power by imposing pernicious,\nself-serving norms? The Mohists have several answers, of varying\npersuasiveness. The first is their version of the traditional Chinese\ndoctrine that the sovereign rules by the mandate of Heaven (tian\nming). Heaven will punish a corrupt ruler by causing him to be\noverthrown. Second, the sovereign and other leaders do not create the\nstandards of right and wrong, but only exemplify, teach, and enforce\nthem. Independent moral standards are provided by Mohist ethical\ntheory, to which subordinates can appeal if their leaders are mistaken\nor corrupt. These independent criteria are explicitly incorporated\ninto the third version of the political theory (Book 13), which\nspecifies that people are to promote \u201ccare and benefit\u201d to\nthe clan, state, and world, instead of merely conforming to their\nsuperiors\u2019 judgments of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cnot.\u201d\nThird, the Mohists hold that facts about moral psychology prevent\nmalicious abuse of the system, for it will collapse in the hands of a\ncorrupt ruler. People must see that leaders govern fairly and in the\ninterest of society as a whole, or they will resist the system and\n\u201cally below\u201d against their superiors. The unified moral\nnorms will disintegrate, rewards and punishments will lose their\neffectiveness, and disorder will ensue. Since this outcome is\nantithetical to everyone\u2019s interests, including the ruler\u2019s, even a\nself-interested leader has a motive to govern virtuously.\n\n\nA further worry is that the Mohist political system implements a\nkind of command morality, in which subordinates do nothing but\nmindlessly follow their leaders, who decide for them what is right and\nwrong. This concern seems unfounded, however, for the sovereign\u2019s\noriginal edict makes subordinates responsible for criticizing their\nsuperiors if they err. Clearly, those on the lower levels of the social\nhierarchy are expected to have the capacity to exercise independent\njudgment. The Mohists do tend toward a form of social, behavioral\npsychology and do not say enough about individual moral deliberation.\nBut the aim of their system is education, not passive obedience. Their\nnotion of a unified morality is two-sided. In one respect, subordinates\nmust conform to their superiors, who lead and educate them, but in\nanother, those above must conform to those below, for the system works\nonly if the people genuinely approve of their leaders\u2019 decisions.\n\n\nA third worry, to contemporary eyes probably the most serious, is that\nthe Mohists\u2019 notion of a unified morality and their conception of\nsocial order (zhi) are disturbingly totalitarian. The Mohists\nare probably right to hold that social stability requires consensus on\nat least a minimal set of moral norms \u2014 one that rules out murder and\ntheft, for instance \u2014 and that a strong government is needed to\nenforce such norms. The Mohist movement originated during an era of\nturmoil and violence, and it is possible that their conception of a\nunified morality is intended to comprise only the minimal moral\nstandards needed to preserve social harmony. But the scope of the\nnorms they envision seems much broader than this. Indeed, it\nseems to cover all value judgments whatsoever \u2014 all distinctions\nbetween \u201cright\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d (shi and fei). To the\nMohists, one suspects, even a moderate degree of diversity in how we\ndraw such distinctions counts as social, moral, and even intellectual\n\u201cdisorder\u201d (luan). The natural objection, for contemporary\nliberal readers, is that social order doesn\u2019t require total consensus\non values. It can be achieved through agreement on a limited, norms of justice, which leaves individuals free to determine other\nvalues for themselves. The Mohist system unduly restricts individual\nliberty, the objection would run, and in fact the Mohists\u2019 own moral\nideal of inclusive care and reciprocal benefit among everyone might\nbest be satisfied by a political system that ensures extensive\nindividual liberty.\n\n\nThese concerns underscore the nearly complete absence of individualism\nin Mohist thought. The Mohists presuppose a kind of communitarian\nsystem in which the fundamental concern is the interests of society as\na whole, specifically social order (zhi), economic wealth,\nand a large population. What is right for the individual is determined\nby whatever dao (way) is right for society. The salient level\nof moral choice is that of the society; individuals who desire to do\nwhat is right are expected to take for granted that they should\nconform to the dao that is best for society. The\nindividualist stance of the selfish, rational egoist does not occur to\nthe Mohists as an alternative to be addressed or refuted. Nor do they\nsee room for a distinction between public and private morality,\nbetween values that everyone must share in order to maintain a stable\nsociety and values about which individuals can disagree without\ndisrupting social harmony.\n\n\nThe Mohists devote little or no attention to the rights, liberty, or\nequality of individuals, nor even to the question of what the most\nfulfilling kind of individual life is. They simply assume that the\nbest life is one of adherence to yi (morality, duty) and thus\nof promoting overall utility. The paradigmatic individual \u2014 the\nbenevolent person (ren ren) \u2014 is one who devotes himself to\n\u201cpromoting the benefit of and eliminating harm to the world.\u201d\nLegitimate individual interests are identified through the\nindividual\u2019s role in the social project. The Mohists, like the\nConfucians, see individuals as largely constituted by the\nhierarchical, relational social roles they occupy, such as ruler or\nsubject, father or son, elder or younger brother, male or female,\nelder or youth, or member of a family or community. It is primarily as\noccupants of such roles that individuals have ethical norms to follow\nand interests to pursue.\n\n\nThis communitarian focus is a major point of contrast with Western\nsocial contract theories and utilitarian political\ntheory. Utilitarians and social contract theorists (excepting perhaps\nRousseau) typically treat individuals\u2019 interests as primary and\nconstruct social good out of individual good. The state is justified\nbecause it promotes individuals\u2019 rights and interests better than any\nalternative. For the Mohists, by contrast, the state is instrumentally\njustified because social order (zhi) is an intrinsic good,\nsought by all, and government by a hierarchy of moral leaders is\nneeded to achieve it.\n\n\nIndeed, as we might expect from their communitarianism, the Mohists\u2019\nconception of zhi (order) contains the seeds of an argument\nthat the state is intrinsically justified as well. The Mohists most\noften use zhi in a narrow sense, to refer to harmonious\nfamily and social relations. But some Mohist texts \u2014 mainly the\ntriad devoted to the doctrine of \u201cHeaven\u2019s intent\u201d \u2014 use\nzhi in a broader sense, in which it is identified with\nyi (righteousness, morality) and zheng (good governance), which\nin turn is taken to require a hierarchical political system\nadministered by the noble and wise. The texts thus imply that the\nMohist political system is not merely an instrument for producing\nutility, but is itself a component of the goods that constitute moral\nright and thus is intrinsically justified. Of course, even if we allow\nthe Mohists to identify \u201cmorality\u201d with\n\u201corder\u201d and \u201corder\u201d with their preferred form\nof political organization in this way, their line of argument\njustifies at most only the existence of the state, not the state\u2019s\npromulgation of a totalitarian, all-encompassing norms of conduct. \n\n\nMohist political theory probably strongly influenced later Warring\nStates political thinkers, such as the Confucian Xunzi and his two most\nfamous students, the realpolitik theorist Han Fei and the statesman Li\nSi, political architect of China\u2019s first empire. Yet this strand of\nauthoritarian political thought did not lack critics. The Mohist\nconception of social order (zhi), along with those of Xunzi\nand Han Fei, epitomize views that are attacked sharply in ancient\nDaoist texts such as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi. By\ncontrast, some parts of the Zhuangzi imply a relatively\nliberal political stance, on which individuals would probably be\nallowed the maximum amount of liberty compatible with avoiding social\nconflict.\nPromoting the Worthy\n\n\nAs we have seen, the theory of \u201cconforming upward\u201d argues\nfor a centralized state with a hierarchical, tightly organized\nbureaucracy.  The other prominent Mohist political doctrine,\n\u201cpromoting the worthy,\u201d contends that to ensure the\nsuccess of the state in securing wealth, a large population, and\nsocial order, appointments to the bureaucracy must be based on ethical\nmerit and professional ability. Talented commoners should be\nconsidered for office as well as those from elite backgrounds\n(particularly kinsmen of the ruler). This doctrine is partly a\nresponse to new administrative challenges arising from population\ngrowth, economic expansion, and interstate military rivalry, which\ncalled for a move beyond the traditional feudal system and the\ndevelopment of a more specialized, professional cohort of government\nofficials. It is also a reaction against nepotism and incompetence and\nan appeal for greater equality of opportunity for those of non-elite\norigin, such as the Mohists themselves.\n\n\nAbove all, however, the doctrine is an important complement to the Mohist moral education\nand incentive system, an integral part of the implementation of the unified moral norms the Mohists see as crucial to social order and political legitimacy. For the system to work, it must be perceived as applying consistent, unified norms to promote and reward the worthy while offering a fair opportunity for advancement to all. Otherwise, those below will may be unable to identify with the system and thus may see no\nreason to emulate their superiors or cooperate with the state. \nConsistent with their communitarian orientation, the Mohists\u2019 defense\nof equality of opportunity does not rest on the individualist view\nthat, other things being equal, people intrinsically deserve to be\ntreated similarly. The argument is rather that the utility of the\nstate and society is promoted by employing the most qualified\ncandidates, without regard for their social background, both because of their competence and because the state must be publicly perceived as enforcing unified, consistent standards. \n",
