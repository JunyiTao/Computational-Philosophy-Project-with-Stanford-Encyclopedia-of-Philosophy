    "main_text": "A Period of Transition\n4. A Period of Transition\n\nCohen\u2019s 1883 The Principle of the Infinitesimal Method and\nits History and the second, 1885 edition of Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Experience reveal the considerable extent to which he\nmodified and deepened his epistemology and philosophy of science over\nthe course of the 1870s and early 1880s. In one move that marks his\nincreasing clarity about his own views, he abandons the term\n\u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d [Erkenntnistheorie] as\nirredeemably psychologistic, since it was too closely associated with\npsychologically-oriented projects such as Helmholtz\u2019s. Instead,\nhe proposes to call the project of his theoretical philosophy\n\u201ccritique of knowledge\u201d [Erkenntniskritik].\n\nBeyond merely terminological changes, in The Principle of the\nInfinitesimal Method and the second edition of Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Experience, Cohen offers a better developed and more\nclearly articulated account of the substance of his epistemological\nview. He calls the view \u201ccritical idealism.\u201d The view is a\nform of idealism, because Cohen still maintains that a priori laws\ncontained within scientific theories make it possible for those\ntheories to represent objects. But the idealism is\n\u201ccritical\u201d because it is Kantian \u2013 that is, for\nCohen, because it is committed above all to the transcendental method\n(Cohen 1883, 6ff).\n\nCohen\u2019s increased clarity about critical idealism emerged in\npart from work on the history of philosophy he did in the 1870s and\nearly 1880s. He presents his view of that history in both The\nPrinciple of the Infinitesimal Method and a long introduction he\nadded to the second edition of Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience. As Cohen sees it, Plato and Leibniz play roles in the\ndevelopment of critical idealism that are second only to Kant\u2019s.\nLike Kant, both sought to understand mathematics as paradigms of\nknowledge in general. Further, as Cohen argued in his 1878 essay\n\u201cPlato\u2019s Doctrine of Ideas and Mathematics,\u201d Plato\nanticipated Kant in maintaining that the objects of our thought are\nexplained by appeal to \u201cideas\u201d (which Cohen, employing his\ncharacteristic form of philosophical charity, identified with Kantian\na priori laws) (Edel 1988, Ch. 4). In contrast with this\nPlatonic-rationalist antecedent to critical idealism, Cohen argues,\nstands an Aristotelian-empiricist tradition. Members of this\nuncritical tradition believe, in one way or another, that we must\nexplain the objects of our thought by appeal to objects that exist\nindependently of the mind.\n\nAt the same time, Cohen\u2019s willingness to reject certain Kantian\ndoctrines reveals the extent to which his critical idealism was a\ncommitment only to what he took to be Kant\u2019s philosophical\nmethod. For example, in one of the many sections he added to the\nsecond edition of Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience, Cohen\nargues that the proper way to understand the notion of the\nthing-in-itself is not (as Kant seems to suggest) as an object that\nexists independently of the subject\u2019s representations, somehow\naffecting the subject and thereby giving rise to her sensations.\nRather, Cohen argues that we must think of the thing-in-itself as the\ntotality of all experience, taken as an object of thought (Cohen 1885,\n503ff). Since it is the totality of all experience, rather than merely\nthe experience we happen to have at our particular point in the\nhistory of science, the thing-in-itself is the ideal that science and\ncritical philosophy aim at (see Stang 2018).\n\nThe Principle of the Infinitesimal Method is perhaps most\nsignificant for how it presents a detailed illustration of what the\ncritique of knowledge done according to the transcendental method\nlooks like. The book is a philosophically critical history of the\ndevelopment of calculus. In it, Cohen aims to establish the validity\nof calculus\u2019 foundational concepts \u2013 concepts such as\nlimit and infinitesimal \u2013 in the face of\nphilosophical objections against them. He also aims to establish a\nconnection between the concept of infinitesimals and natural\nscience\u2019s capacity to represent reality. In fact, these two aims\nare connected. For Cohen, the concept of an infinitesimal magnitude is\nvalid for use in calculus, because it is a necessary condition of the\npossibility of natural science\u2019s representation of real objects.\n(See Edel 2010, Richardson 2006, Giovanelli 2011, Giovanelli 2016, and\nEdgar forthcoming).\n\nCohen sees this connection between infinitesimals and reality in the\nsection of the Critique of Pure Reason that Kant called the\nAnticipations of Perception. In the Anticipations, Kant introduces the\nidea of magnitudes that can vary continuously from a finite magnitude\nto zero. He calls these continuously variable magnitudes intensive\nmagnitudes. Kant argues that there is an important connection\nbetween continuously variable magnitudes, sensation, and reality.\nWhile Cohen thinks Kant\u2019s concern with sensation is a mistake,\nhe thinks the connection between continuously variable magnitudes\n\u2013 that is, infinitesimals \u2013 and reality is exactly right.\nThe connection is this. For Cohen, mathematical natural science can\nrepresent real objects only if it represents them as having unique\nidentity conditions. Those identity conditions are defined by unique\nlocations in space and time. But, Cohen insists, the mathematical\nunits that natural science uses to represent space and time must\nthemselves be defined by appeal to infinitesimal magnitudes.\n\nThat final claim \u2013 that the mathematical units of space and time\nmust be defined by appeal to infinitesimals \u2013 follows for Cohen\nfrom the principle of continuity. This is the Leibnizian principle\nthat Cohen glosses as \u201cthere are no jumps in\nconsciousness\u201d (Cohen 1883, \u00a742), which for him means that\nmathematical and scientific theories must represent objects as\ncontinuous. Recent commentators have emphasized that, for Cohen, the\nprinciple of continuity is a requirement of reason, and thus an\nexpression of his methodological rationalism (see Damb\u00f6ck 2017,\n4.4.1 and Edgar forthcoming). At the same time, that the principle of\ncontinuity serves this function for mathematical natural science is,\nfor Cohen, a fact of science revealed by his historical investigation\nof the development of calculus.\n",
