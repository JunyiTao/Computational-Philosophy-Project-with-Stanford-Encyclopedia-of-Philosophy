    "main_text": "The Relation Between Scientific Practice, History of Science, and Philosophy of Science\n5. The Relation Between Scientific Practice, History of Science, and Philosophy of Science\n\nAn issue of interest to philosophers of science today is the relation\nbetween knowledge of the actual practice and history of science and\ndeveloping a philosophy of science. Whewell is interesting to examine\nin relation to this issue because he claimed to be inferring his\nphilosophy of science from his study of the history and practice of\nscience. His large-scale History of the Inductive Sciences\n(first edition published 1837) was a survey of science from ancient to\nmodern times. He insisted upon completing this work before writing his\nPhilosophy of the Inductive Sciences, founded upon their\nhistory. Moreover, Whewell sent proof-sheets of the\nHistory to his many scientist-friends to ensure the accuracy\nof his accounts. Besides knowing about the history of science, Whewell\nhad first-hand knowledge of scientific practice: he was actively\ninvolved in science in several important ways. In 1825 he traveled to\nBerlin and Vienna to study mineralogy and crystallography with Mohs\nand other acknowledged masters of the field. He published numerous\npapers in the field, as well as a monograph, and is still credited\nwith making important contributions to giving a mathematical\nfoundation to crystallography. He also made contributions to the\nscience of tidal research, pushing for a large-scale world-wide\nproject of tidal observations; he won a Royal Society gold medal for\nthis accomplishment. (For more on Whewell\u2019s contributions to\nscience, see Becher 1986; Ruse 1991; Ducheyne 2010a; Snyder 2011;\nHonenberger 2018). Whewell acted as a terminological consultant for\nFaraday and other scientists, who wrote to him asking for new words.\nWhewell only provided terminology when he believed he was fully\nknowledgeable about the science involved. In his section on the\n\u201cLanguage of Science\u201d in the Philosophy, Whewell\nmakes this position clear (see 1858b, p. 293). Another interesting\naspect of his intercourse with scientists becomes clear in reading his\ncorrespondence with them: namely, that Whewell constantly pushed\nFaraday, Forbes, Lubbock and others to perform certain experiments,\nmake specific observations, and to try to connect their findings in\nways of interest to Whewell. In all these ways, Whewell indicated that\nhe had a deep understanding of the activity of science.\n\nSo how is this knowledge of science and its history important for his\nwork on the philosophy of science? Some commentators have claimed that\nWhewell developed an a priori philosophy of science and then\nshaped his History to conform to his own view (Stoll 1929;\nStrong 1955). It is true that he started out, from his undergraduate\ndays, with the project of reforming the inductive philosophy of Bacon;\nindeed this early inductivism led him to the view that learning about\nscientific method must be inductive (i.e., that it requires the study\nof the history of science). Yet it is clear that he believed his study\nof the history of science and his own work in science were needed in\norder to flesh out the details of his inductive position. Thus, as in\nhis epistemology, both a priori and empirical elements\ncombined in the development of his scientific methodology. Ultimately,\nWhewell criticized Mill\u2019s view of induction developed in the\nSystem of Logic not because Mill had not inferred it from a\nstudy of the history of science, but rather on the grounds that Mill\nhad not been able to find a large number of appropriate examples\nillustrating the use of his \u201cMethods of Experimental\nInquiry.\u201d As Whewell noted, Bacon too had been unable to show\nthat his inductive method had been exemplified throughout the history\nof science. Thus it appears that what was important to Whewell was not\nwhether a philosophy of science had been, in fact, inferred from a\nstudy of the history of science, but rather, whether a philosophy of\nscience was inferable from it. That is, regardless of how a\nphilosopher came to invent her theory, she must be able to show it to\nbe exemplified in the actual scientific practice used throughout\nhistory. Whewell believed that he was able to do this for his\ndiscoverers\u2019 induction.\n",
