In particular it is not possible to mention all those who have\ncontributed to its rapid development. With this word of caution out of\nthe way, we will look at some of the main historical threads. \n\n\nCategories, functors, natural transformations, limits and colimits\nappeared almost out of nowhere in a paper by Eilenberg &\nMac\u2009Lane (1945) entitled \u201cGeneral Theory of Natural\nEquivalences.\u201d We say \u201calmost,\u201d because their earlier paper (1942)\ncontains specific functors and natural transformations at work,\nlimited to groups. A desire to clarify and abstract their 1942 results\nled Eilenberg & Mac\u2009Lane to devise category theory. The\ncentral notion at the time, as their title indicates, was that of\nnatural transformation. In order to give a general definition of the\nlatter, they defined functor, borrowing the term from Carnap, and in\norder to define functor, they borrowed the word \u2018category\u2019\nfrom the philosophy of Aristotle, Kant, and C. S. Peirce, but\nredefining it mathematically.\n\n\nAfter their 1945 paper, it was not clear that the concepts of category\ntheory would amount to more than a convenient language; this indeed\nwas the status quo for about fifteen years. Category theory was\nemployed in this manner by Eilenberg & Steenrod (1952), in an\ninfluential book on the foundations of algebraic topology, and by\nCartan & Eilenberg (1956), in a ground breaking book on\nhomological algebra. (Curiously, although Eilenberg & Steenrod\ndefined categories, Cartan & Eilenberg simply assumed them!) These\nbooks allowed new generations of mathematicians to learn algebraic\ntopology and homological algebra directly in the categorical language,\nand to master the method of diagrams. Indeed, without the method of\ndiagram chasing, many results in these two books seem inconceivable,\nor at the very least would have required a considerably more intricate\npresentation.\n\n\nThe situation changed radically with Grothendieck\u2019s (1957) landmark\npaper entitled \u201cSur quelques points d\u2019alg\u00e8bre homologique\u201d, in\nwhich the author employed categories intrinsically to define and\nconstruct more general theories which he (Grothendieck 1957) then\napplied to specific fields, e.g., to algebraic geometry. Kan (1958)\nshowed that adjoint functors subsume the important concepts of limits\nand colimits and could capture fundamental concepts in other areas (in\nhis case, homotopy theory).\n\n\nAt this point, category theory became more than a convenient\nlanguage, by virtue of two developments.\n\nEmploying the axiomatic method and the language of categories,\nGrothendieck (1957) defined in an abstract fashion types of\ncategories, e.g., additive and Abelian categories, showed how to\nperform various constructions in these categories, and proved various\nresults about them. (It should be pointed out that Mac Lane in his\n1950 paper had made a previous attempt which introduced certain key\nideas, for instance using arrows to define certain fundamental\nconcepts and that Buchsbaum had essentially introduced the notion of an\nabelian category independently under the name of \u201cexact\ncategory\u201d in 1955.) In a nutshell, Grothendieck showed how to\ndevelop part of homological algebra in an abstract setting of this\nsort. From then on, a specific category of structures, e.g., a\ncategory of sheaves over a topological space \\(X\\), could be seen as a\ntoken of an abstract category of a certain type, e.g., an Abelian\ncategory. One could therefore immediately see how the methods of,\ne.g., homological algebra could be applied to, for instance, algebraic\ngeometry. Furthermore, it made sense to look for other types of\nabstract categories, ones that would encapsulate the fundamental and\nformal aspects of various mathematical fields in the same way that\nAbelian categories encapsulated fundamental aspects of homological\nalgebra.\nThanks in large part to the efforts of Freyd and Lawvere, category\ntheorists gradually came to see the pervasiveness of the concept of\nadjoint functors. Not only does the existence of adjoints to given\nfunctors permit definitions of abstract categories (and presumably\nthose which are defined by such means have a privileged status) but as\nwe mentioned earlier, many important theorems and even theories in\nvarious fields can be seen as equivalent to the existence of specific\nfunctors between particular categories. By the early 1970s, the\nconcept of adjoint functors was seen as central to category\ntheory.\n\n\n\nWith these developments, category theory became an autonomous field of\nresearch, and pure category theory could be developed. And indeed, it\ndid grow rapidly as a discipline, but also in its applications, mainly\nin its source contexts, namely algebraic topology and homological\nalgebra, but also in algebraic geometry and, after the appearance of\nLawvere\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, in universal algebra. This thesis also\nconstitutes a landmark in this history of the field, for in it Lawvere\nproposed the category of categories as a foundation for category\ntheory, set theory and, thus, the whole of mathematics, as well as\nusing categories for the study of the logical aspects of\nmathematics.\n\n\nOver the course of the 1960s, Lawvere outlined the basic framework\nfor an entirely original approach to logic and the foundations of\nmathematics. He achieved the following:\n\nAxiomatized the category of sets (Lawvere 1964) and of categories\n(Lawvere 1966);\nGave a categorical description of theories that was independent of\nsyntactical choices and sketched how completeness theorems for logical\nsystems could be obtained by categorical methods (Lawvere 1967);\nCharacterized Cartesian closed categories and showed their\nconnections to logical systems and various logical paradoxes (Lawvere\n1969);\nShowed that the quantifiers and the comprehension schemes could be\ncaptured as adjoint functors to given elementary operations (Lawvere\n1966, 1969, 1970, 1971);\nArgued that adjoint functors should generally play a major\nfoundational role through the notion of \u201ccategorical doctrines\u201d\n(Lawvere 1969).\n\n\n Meanwhile, Lambek (1968, 1969, 1972) described categories in terms of\ndeductive systems and employed categorical methods for\nproof-theoretical purposes. \n\n\nAll this work culminated in another notion, thanks to Grothendieck and\nhis school: that of a topos. Even though toposes appeared in\nthe 1960s, in the context of algebraic geometry, again from the mind\nof Grothendieck, it was certainly Lawvere and Tierney\u2019s (1972)\nelementary axiomatization of a topos which gave impetus to its\nattaining foundational status. Very roughly, an elementary topos is a\ncategory possessing a logical structure sufficiently rich to develop\nmost of \u201cordinary mathematics\u201d, that is, most of what is\ntaught to mathematics undergraduates. As such, an elementary topos can\nbe thought of as a categorical theory of sets. But it is also a\ngeneralized topological space, thus providing a direct connection\nbetween logic and geometry. (For more on the history of categorical\nlogic, see Marquis & Reyes 2012, Bell 2005.) \n\n\nThe 1970s saw the development and application of the topos concept in\nmany different directions. The very first applications outside\nalgebraic geometry were in set theory, where various independence\nresults were recast in terms of topos (Tierney 1972, Bunge 1974, but\nalso Blass & Scedrov 1989, Blass & Scedrov 1992, Freyd 1980,\nMac\u2009Lane & Moerdijk 1992, Scedrov 1984). Connections with\nintuitionistic and, more generally constructive mathematics were noted\nearly on, and toposes are still used to investigate models of various\naspects of intuitionism and constructivism (Lambek & Scott 1986,\nMac\u2009Lane & Moerdijk 1992, Van der Hoeven & Moerdijk\n1984a, 1984b, 1984c, Moerdijk 1984, Moerdijk 1995a, Moerdijk 1998,\nMoerdijk & Palmgren 1997, Moerdijk & Palmgren 2002, Palmgren\n2012, Palmgren 2018. For more on the history of topos theory, see McLarty 1992 and Bell 2012).\n\n\nMore recently, topos theory has been employed to investigate various\nforms of constructive mathematics or set theory (Joyal & Moerdijk\n1995, Taylor 1996, Awodey 2008), recursiveness, and models of\nhigher-order type theories generally. The introduction of the\nso-called \u201ceffective topos\u201d and the search for axioms for\nsynthetic domain theory are worth mentioning (Hyland 1982, Hyland\n1988, 1991, Hyland et al. 1990, McLarty 1992, Jacobs\n1999, Van Oosten 2008, Van Oosten 2002 and the references\ntherein). Lawvere\u2019s early motivation was to provide a new foundation\nfor differential geometry, a lively research area which is now called\n\u201csynthetic differential geometry\u201d (Lawvere 2000, 2002,\nKock 2006, Bell 1988, 1995, 1998, 2001, Moerdijk & Reyes\n1991). This is only the tip of the iceberg; toposes could prove to be\nfor the 21st century what Lie groups were to the 20th century.\n\n\nFrom the 1980s to the present, category theory has found new\napplications. In theoretical computer science, category theory is now\nfirmly rooted, and contributes, among other things, to the development\nof new logical systems and to the semantics of programming. (Pitts\n2000, Plotkin 2000, Scott 2000, and the references therein). Its\napplications to mathematics are becoming more diverse, even touching\non theoretical physics, which employs higher-dimensional category\ntheory \u2014 which is to category theory what higher-dimensional\ngeometry is to plane geometry \u2014 to study the so-called \u201cquantum\ngroups\u201d and quantum field theory (Majid 1995, Baez & Dolan 2001 and other\npublications by these authors).\n",
