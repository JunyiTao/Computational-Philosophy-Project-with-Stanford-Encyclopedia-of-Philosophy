    "main_text": "Donor Anonymity\n2. Donor Anonymity\n\nThere is general agreement that it is permissible for donor-conceived\nindividuals to have information about and contact with their genetic\nprogenitors. However, gamete donation arrangements in which there is\nan expectation that donors remain anonymous are more contentious. \n\nAdvocates of children\u2019s rights to access identifying information\nabout their donors generally appeal to harms that might arise in the\nabsence of such information, and/or a purported fundamental right to\ninformation about one\u2019s genetic origins (Ravitsky 2010, 2012;\nVelleman 2005, 2008; McGee, Brakeman, and Gurmankin 2001; Blyth and\nFarrand 2004). Possible harms considered include psychological\ndistress, damaged familial relationships, reduced self-knowledge, and\nincomplete or incorrect medical records. Those who favour permitting\nanonymous donation argue that it is a mistake to place a great deal of\nimportance on genetic origins, and question both the severity of the\nharms caused by anonymous donation and whether the existence of such\nharms constitutes a decisive argument against donor-anonymity\n(Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014; Haslanger 2009).\n\nThe philosophical debate takes place within a background of changing\nlegal norms governing donor anonymity (Clark 2011; Frith 2001;\nBernstein 2010). While maintaining donor anonymity was once common\npractice (and is mandatory in certain jurisdictions, such as France)\nthere has been a strong trend towards enshrining in law\ndonor-conceived children\u2019s rights to access identifying\ninformation about their donor, at least once they reach the age of\nmajority (Clark 2011; Frith 2001; Bernstein 2010; Brunet and Kunstmann\n2013). \n",
