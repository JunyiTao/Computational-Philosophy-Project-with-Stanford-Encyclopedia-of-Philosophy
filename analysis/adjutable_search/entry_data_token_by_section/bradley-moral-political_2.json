    "main_text": "The Content of Volitional Choices\n3. The Content of Volitional Choices\n\n\nThe next task is to show what provides the moral content for\npractical deliberations and choices about how to act. Most\nimportantly, we want to know what specific types of actions or goals\nwill allow us to realize ourselves. Here Bradley turns to historical\nethical theories to determine whether they can supply what is\nwanted. Bradley examines teleological hedonism and deontological\ntheories and finds both unacceptable. Deontological theories fail\nbecause they place no constraints on what can be willed by a moral\nagent and so no specific end is indicated and none barred.\nDeontology is one-sided and abstract: it has focused on the\nuniversal aspect of the will and disregarded the other, equally\nimportant particular element. What is in fact missing is any\nadequate psychological account of desire which explains how we are\nmotivated to do specific things, to make specific choices. By\ncontrast, ethical hedonism makes the opposite mistake of focusing on\nthe particular to the detriment of the universal side. Classical\nUtilitarianism, for example, sees particular pleasant states as the\ngoal of action but cannot present any of these as having any intrinsic\nvalue, for they are only means to the maximization of pleasure and\ncould be replaced by any other means that were more, or equally,\neffective. Moreover\u2014and this is an objection raised by all the\nBritish Idealists against hedonism\u2014since pleasant states perish\nthere is no sense in which a number of them can be enjoyed together as\nfelt states rather than merely remembered. So, a sum of pleasures\nor a maximum of pleasures cannot be the end moral agents are to aim\nfor.\n\n\nThere is another reason the British Idealists believed that pleasure\ncould not be the end of moral action. Henry Sidgwick correctly\nexpressed this objection: \u201cIt is said \u2026 by Mr. Green\nthat \u2018pleasure as feeling, in distinction from its conditions\nwhich are not feelings, cannot be conceived\u2019; and, therefore, of\ncourse, cannot be taken as an end of rational action\u201d\n(Hedonism and the Ultimate Good, p.36). The debate Green\nis weighing in on concerns what can and cannot be the intentional\nobjects of desires. Sidgwick claims that Green\u2019s argument\ntrades on an ambiguous use of \u2018conceive\u2019. We might\nnot be able to \u201cform the notion of an angle without the notion of\nthe sides containing it,\u201d says Sidgwick, but we can see\nthat an angle is greater than or equal to another \u201cwithout any\ncomparison of the containing sides\u201d (loc. cit.).\nThis misses the point. It is not that I have to compare sides in\norder to ascertain the size of an angle, but rather that our\nconception of an angle entails the notion of a space\ncontained, as it were, between two lines that meet at a point and we\ncannot \u2018think\u2019 of a \u2018mere angle\u2019 in the sense\nof an unbounded spatial quantity. Applied to pleasures, the issue\nis whether there are naked pleasures, as it were, and whether one can\nattach any meaning to the idea of a pleasure detached from the activity\nor whatever it is that is the pleasant experience. Bradley made a\nsimilar point in Ethical Studies: pleasure and pain are\nfeelings which \u201care as they are felt to be, but they\ntell us nothing. In a word they have no content: they are states\nof us, but they have nothing for us (Ethical Studies, p.\n94). If we cannot characterize pleasures\u2014because they\nhave no meaning or content in and of themselves\u2014then we cannot\nidentify with them and so they could not be the objects aimed at in\nrational choice, as Green had said.\n\n\nMill had in effect rejected this view by accepting that pleasures\ndisplay qualitative differences. Bradley recognizes that we\ntalk as though they do, using expressions which appear to\nentail that pleasures and pains have immediately given felt qualities\nbut he offers an explanation of why this is. He starts with the\nobservation that while it is uncertain whether all sensations are\n\u201dcoloured by pain and pleasure\u201c it is certain that\n\u201dwithout sensation we never have pleasure or pain\u201c\n(Collected Essays, p. 244). Just as sensations never occur\napart from some psychic context, which may make a significant\ndifference to the sensation, neither do pleasures and pains\n\u201dexist apart from sensation\u201c (Collected Essays,\np.  245). He goes on to assert that \u201dpains and pleasures have no\nqualities of their own,\u201c it being \u201dthe quality of the\nsensations, or arrangements of sensations, which we place to their\ncredit. The kinds of pains which have been urged in disproof of the\nabove, the feelings that shoot or that burn or gnaw, are each due to\nthe special sort of sensations, together with the rhythm of intensity\nin the pain\u201c (loc cit). If this is true, it offers a reason why\nwe might mistake a quantitative for a qualitative difference, namely,\nthat we mistake variations in sensory intensities and\nintensity-patterns over time, with which pleasure is attached or\nattendant, for qualitative differences in the pleasures\nthemselves. Given that further features of the overall experience are\nsaid to be attributable to the powers of the sensations,\nthese\u2014rather than the pains and pleasures\u2014appear to be the\ncausal agents. If this interpretation is correct, pains and pleasures\nare epiphenomena. For present purposes the importance of this is that\nit bolsters the Idealists\u2019 argument that pleasure cannot be the end of\nrational action, leave alone the ultimate end of moral action. It also\nexplains the so-called Paradox of Hedonism.\n\nBoth of these views\u2014hedonism and deontology\u2014approach morality from\nthe perspective of the individual person. This individual is\ntreated as a fully formed moral agent independent of any social\nrelations. Each is able to decide what is morally required by\nconsulting a formal principle in their mind (e.g., the Kantian\ncategorical imperative) or their own feeling states. In\nresponding to individualism, which he thinks ultimately rests on a\nfalse theory of human nature, Bradley\u2019s worry as far as morality\nis concerned is that it reflects a kind of egoistic antagonism to other\npeople that makes morality impossible: if the self we are\n\u201dto realize is an atom, a unit which repels other units, and can\nhave nothing in itself but what is exclusively its, its\nfeelings, its pleasure and pain\u2014then it is certain that it can stand\nto others, with their pleasures and pains, only in external relation;\nand since it is the end, the others must be the means, and nothing but\nthe means. On such a basis morality is impossible\n\u00c9\u201c (Ethical Studies, p, 115). It is\nimpossible because, since morality requires being an organic whole,\nsocial relations that are external defeat that goal. The sort of\nconfrontational individualism in which each asserts his or her will\nagainst the wills of others generates the intolerable situation that\ncontract theories take to be the motivation for creating the social\ncontract, which in its turn becomes another form of external constraint\non individuals that prevents the community from becoming anything other\nthan a mere collection of egoistic, atomic individuals.\n\n\nIn opposition to individualism Bradley endorses the thesis of\nholism. Debates pitting individualism and holism against each\nother usually focus either on questions about explanations or on\nquestions about the essential nature of social creatures such as human\nbeings. Methodological individualism takes a position on the\nfirst of these, claiming that the explanation of the behavior of\ncollective or corporate entities requires reduction to the beliefs,\naims, and desires of individuals making up that collective. There\nhas recently been some interesting literature on this debate, expressed\nin terms of whether corporations and other groups can be said to have a\nperspective (a set of beliefs and values) such that it would be\nappropriate to say that the collective itself has beliefs, desires, and\nso on, thereby exhibiting a form of collective intentionality\n(we-intentionality) that is not reducible to the intentional mental\nstates of its members (e.g., French and Wettstein\u2019s Shared\nIntentions and Collective Responsibility). Bradley at times\ntalks of society and the state in ways which suggest he would accept\nthe position of the proponents of collective intentionality, and\nperhaps he must commit to it if the argument for metaphysical holism,\nwhich is his main concern, goes through.\n\n\nThe metaphysical thesis claims that individuals are what they are\nbecause of their social relations. To the extent that Bradley\noffers anything in the way of argument for this position he tends to\nlean rather heavily on empirical evidence which shows us that people\nborn at different times and places, and born into this or that cultural\nor religious or ethnic group, will tend to inherit the practices and\nattitudes of those by whom they are raised. He does think of\nchildren as born with certain natural needs and desires and with\ncertain aptitudes and latent possibilities; but these need nurturing\nand some of these tendencies need to be \u201dcivilized\u201c, the\neffect being: \u201dThese \u2018civilized tendencies\u2019, if\nwe may use the phrase, are part of the essence of the\nchild: he would only partly (if at all) be himself without\nthem; he owes them to his ancestors, and his ancestors owe them to\nsociety\u201c (Ethical Studies, p. 170). Against the\nindividualist who objects that there was, nevertheless, a point at\nwhich there were no societies but only individuals, he elicits the aid\nof Darwin in support of the view that humans have always been\nsocial, having evolved from social animals. But Bradley has a\nmore interesting argument for holism which enters on language.\nThe language a community speaks has to be truly public, with understood\nand accepted meanings for its central terms, on pain of ending with\nnobody ever understanding what anyone else is talking about. The\nlanguage also has, embedded in it as it were, the values and beliefs of\nthe community that speaks it. In passing on its language to the\nchildren a society is passing on its values, its understanding of its\ninstitutions and so on. As Bradley says, for each child, learning\nto speak the language \u201dcarries into his mind the ideas and\nsentiments of the race \u00c9 and stamps them in indelibly\u201c\nThis child also observes and comes to participate in the practices of\nthe society: he \u201dgrows up in an atmosphere of example and\ngeneral custom\u201c (Ethical Studies, p.\n172).\n\nHolism has ramifications for the theory of self-realization, because if\none\u2019s social relations are constitutive of what one is then the\nself is only realized when it recognizes and endorses the duties it has\nas a member of a community\u2014a family, a state, and so on. At\nthis point the self\u2019s perspective shifts from the subjective\nfeelings and goals of the individual to the idea of moral\nobligations that are objective, in that they hold for all in the\ncommunity, and also objective in that one has them no matter what\npersonal desires one might have. Of course, with the recognition that\none is a member of the community the situation will not be construed as\n\u201dthem\u201c forcing \u201dme\u2019 to behave a certain way;\nbut will give rise to genuine collective intentionality, to viewing\nthings in terms of what we believe and value.\n\nOne key thing that happens at this stage is that the idea of realizing\nthe self is now given specific content. Earlier we saw the moral\nagent, the moral self, in terms of the formal structure of volitional\naction, but here we see a self that has specific content attached to\nits realization or perfecting of itself, for the communal morality\nindicates what is expected of someone if they wish to be regarded as a\nvirtuous member of that moral community. Moreover, society offers\nthe homogeneity and specificity that moral development demands:\nsocial life not only provides a greater degree of homogeneity, in that\nit removes the dualism of oneself and others, but it provides an\nexpansion of the self through the greater diversity (specificity) found\nin living with others, since that communal life expands one\u2019s\nexperience beyond what is available to her as a mere, isolated,\nindividual. Again, we have movement in the direction of being an\ninfinite whole because relations previously thought to be external to\nthe individual\u2014and thereby limiting factors\u2014are now seen as\ninternal to the self.\n\n\nIn passing, it is interesting to consider why Bradley approves of\nfollowing the feelings of the phronimos\u2014the person of\npractical wisdom\u2014when he has no faith in the judgments of Mill\u2019s\ncompetent judges who are said to be able to rank pleasures and no\nconfidence in Mill\u2019s Moral Almanac (Utilitarianism, Chapter\n2). The difference is that Mill\u2019s experts are simply reporting their\nown personal feelings\u2014which are not authoritative, for anyone\nelse could disagree and there is no test available to determine who is\nright\u2014and the Moral Almanac is merely a collection of\nthese sorts of experiences; while, by contrast, the phronimos\nhas, through long experience within his society, come to identify with\nthe values of that society and so his judgments and choices reflect\nthese values. The social norms have become such a part of who he is\nthat he need not think about what to do but has an intuitive\n\u201cfeel\u201d for what morality demands (Ethical\nStudies, p. 196). If this is correct, it seems then that\nthe phronimos no longer feels any conflict between the\nparticular self he is and the self he ought to be as a member of\nsociety. Bradley noted Goethe\u2019s directive to \u201cBe a\nwhole or join a whole,\u201d which he amended to, \u201cYou\ncan not be a whole, unless you join a whole\u201d\n(Ethical Studies, p.79). This is what the\nphronimos has done, thereby transforming his external\nrelations to others in society into the internal relations\ncharacteristic of parts of an organic unity. (Whether this means that\nthe phronimos is therefore not able to be an inspiration\nor a spur to initiating social change, or is unable himself to rise to\nthe level of Ideal Morality, is a question Bradley does not\naddress. But it should be the case, for the phronimos no\nlonger retains the degree of residual individuality which is required\nby the next level of morality, Ideal Morality.)\n\nBradley has two reservations about the morality of the community.\nFirst, there are some ways of realizing or perfecting oneself that\nappear to have nothing to do with morality proper or with society,\nwhich raises a question about the limits of morality, about whether the\ndemands of self-realization go beyond the moral obligation to perfect\noneself as a member of society. Does the artist have an\nobligation to perfect her talents? If so, is this a moral\nobligation? Bradley notes that it seems reasonable to say that we\nwill not realize ourselves if we fail to develop our talents and\nabilities and he even feels some temptation to call this a moral\nobligation\u2014or at least an obligation of some sort\u2014while at the same\ntime admitting that there are spheres of activity that are or should be\nfree of obligation, where we are left to our own devices.\nIn saying this he is admitting that individualism is not totally wrong,\nfor even members of a community remain individuals pursuing their own\nseparate plans and projects, albeit within the framework of the\ncommunity\u2019s social and political institutions and its normative\nunderstandings and commitments. The second reservation is that the\nreflective individual may come to feel that her society is wrong in\nsome respect or is in what Bradley calls a \u201crotten\u201d\ncondition. While it may not be clear what \u2018rotten\u2019\nwould mean or how one would determine whether a society was in this\ncondition or not, it is clear that change can be urged if we discover a\ncontradiction in the moral views of our society. For example, if\nthe constitution claimed all are equal before the law yet specific laws\ndenied benefits or access to the institutions of the state to some\ngroup, then we would have a contradiction. Denying same sex\npartners the opportunity to marry and enjoy whatever rights and social\nbenefits that go along with that status may be relevant contemporary\nexample. Given this possibility, there has to be some scope for\nrevising social rules and political institutions, which means one would\nbe opposing society\u2019s moral values and in doing this, more or\nless opposing oneself in that one\u2019s moral perspective has been\ninherited from members of that society, from the ancestors. In this\ncase the opposition between the subjective self and the superior moral\nself identified with the community breaks out again, which then becomes\nthe impetus to a change in moral values.\n\n\nThis illuminates Bradley\u2019s remark that social morality is both\nabsolute and relative. The morality of one\u2019s society has a\nprima facie claim on individual members and so is absolute in\nthe sense that no one is free simply to go her own way; yet the social\nmorality may change for the same reasons the perspective of an\nindividual might change\u2014for example, because of the discovery of new\nfacts or with the revelation of a contradiction which forces a\nre-thinking of present values\u2014and so they are only relative.\nThus, while the individual has a prima facie obligation to be\nas good as his society he also has the obligation to be reflective\nabout social morality and to determine whether it requires\nmodification.\n",
