    "main_text": "Buddhist Context of Geluk Philosophy\n5. Geluk Education\n\nFollowing Tsongkhapa\u2019s lead, the Geluk tradition came to\nestablish large monastic institutions that set the standard for\nscholastic education in Tibet. The curriculum at Geluk monastic\ninstitutions involves five primary topics: metaphysics\n(abhidharma), epistemology (pram\u0101\u1e47a),\nnegative dialectics (madhyamaka), path structure\n(Abhisamay\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra), and ethics\n(vinaya). Buddhist metaphysics instills the contours of a\nBuddhist view, including causality, impermanence, and an\nevent-metaphysics that ties these two together. The path structure\nalso plays a central role in traditional Buddhist philosophy: it\nprovides the philosophy with a telos, a narrative arch toward\nliberation and complete enlightenment. Ethics, too, is integral to\nthis path and to Buddhist philosophy in general, yet some of the most\ndistinctive and interesting features of Geluk philosophy are found in\nits epistemology, and in particular, negative dialectics.\n\nGeluk monks who train in philosophy study epistemology early in their\ncareers, and debate is a primary means by which this tradition is\ninternalized and enacted. Buddhist epistemology, as codified in\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Commentary on Epistemology\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika), lays out a systematic\npresentation of the means of knowledge and the rules for valid\ninference. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s epistemology can be said to be\nantirealist or conceptualist, in that he denies that language directly\nrelates to the contents of perception, which are ineffable\nparticulars. Yet to account for the relationship between real\nparticulars and unreal universals, the Geluk tradition develops what\nhas been dubbed a \u201csemi-realist\u201d position, whereby it\nasserts that there are universals that are real entities in contrast\nto the antirealism that denies that universals are entities (Dreyfus\n1997, 173). Here again we see a collapse of duality; this time, the\nconcept-percept duality that underwrites Dharmak\u012brtian\nepistemology.\n\nStraddling the delicate line between a realist view that affirms the\nreality of universals and an antirealist one that denies the reality\nof concepts, a Geluk account of epistemology holds that universals are\nreal, but that they do not exists separately from their particular\ninstances. For instance, the universal \u201ccow\u201d and the\nparticular instances of cow are held to be not utterly distinct, as\nantirealists would have it, nor are they held to be the same, as a\nstrict realist would claim, but are rather said to be\n\u201cextensionally identical but intensionally distinct\u201d\n(Dreyfus 1997, 174\u201378). In the epistemological context,\narticulating this relationship is an attempt to account for the\nefficacy of concepts without giving universals an autonomous existence\napart from their instances. Given that the Geluk tradition claims that\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s epistemological project represents an\ninferior philosophical position, it is arguably studied for didactic\npurposes, whereas the nominalism of what Geluk thinkers consider their\nown tradition\u2014the view of the Consequence School of the Middle\nWay\u2014is the hallmark of their philosophy.\n",
