In\nsemi-revision, the input information is either rejected or fully\naccepted. In selective revision, it is possible for only a part of the\ninput information to be accepted. An operation \\(\\circ\\) of selective\nrevision can be constructed from a standard revision operation \\(*\\)\nand a transformation function \\(f\\) from and to sentences:\n\n\\[\nK \\circ p = K * f(p)\n\\]\n\n\nIn the intended cases, \\(f(p)\\) does not contain any information that\nis not contained in \\(p\\). This is ensured if \\(f(p)\\) is a logical\nconsequence of \\(p\\). By adding further conditions on \\(f\\), various\nadditional properties can be obtained for the operation of selective\nrevision.\n",
