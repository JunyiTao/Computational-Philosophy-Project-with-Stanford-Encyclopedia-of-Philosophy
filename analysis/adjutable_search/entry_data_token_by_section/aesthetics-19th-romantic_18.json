First, the holistic and\nunifying character of poetry is suitable not only for the reformed\nscientific methodology that fuses together reason, imagination and\nfeeling, but also for unraveling analogies and unities that are\nusually hidden from the bare eye, for example, the unity between kinds\nof matter and self-conscious human beings as different stages in the\norganization of the same life force.\n\nSecond, natural beauties and artworks inspire an interest in natural\norganization and life by their analogy with organisms, or as the\nromantics often put it, by being themselves organic in nature. \n\n\nThe transcendental poetry of the future could be called organic. When\nit is invented it will be seen that all true poets up to now made\npoetry organically without knowing it. (Novalis,\nLogological Fragments: I, #38). \n\n\nArtworks and natural beauties are analogous to organisms in various\nrespects.\n\nTo begin with, the analogy concerns their structure or unity. Both\nhave holistic unities, where the parts and the whole are reciprocally\ninterdependent. Artworks and natural beauties are so structured since\n(1) their beauty as a whole depends on the existence and the exact\norganization of their parts (for, if, say, any of the specific shapes,\nhues, or composition of a painting were to change, the painting as a\nwhole may not be beautiful any longer), and (2) their parts are\nrecognized as what they are (as beauty-making parts, or parts of a\nbeautiful object) only in light of the whole (so that, for\nexample, a mere shade of white may be beautiful only in light of the\nbeauty of the painting to which it contributes as a whole, but not\nnecessarily beautiful on its own, or when it figures in any other\nobject). \u201cIn poetry\u201d, then, just as in organisms,\n\u201cevery whole can be a part and every part really a whole\u201d\n(F. Schlegel, CF: #14).\n\nKant claimed that the main difference between the holistic unity of\norganisms and the holistic unities of artworks and natural beauties is\nthe difference between a causal or existential unity and what he\ncalled a formal unity. In organic life, the reciprocal interdependence\nbetween parts and wholes is causal and existential in the sense that\nit is life-sustaining. Kant thought that in aesthetics, the reciprocal\ninterdependence is formal, rather than causal or existential, in the\nsense that it does not explain the existence of the objects\nat stake, but their beauty. While, for example, a painting might\ncontinue to exist as a painting even if some of its parts changed\n(say, if its composition, shapes, or hues changed), the beauty of this\npainting is unlikely to survive such a change. In this case, it is the\nbeauty of the whole painting that depends on its parts, and\nit is the beauty of the parts, rather than their existence,\nthat depends on the beauty of the whole: for were the painting as a\nwhole not beautiful, its parts would not be recognized as what they\nare, namely, beauty-making parts. \n\nThe romantics seemed to diverge from Kant on that matter. For them,\ngreat poetry is materially and not merely formally organic:\n\n\nThe innate impulse of this work [Wilhelm Meister], so\norganized and organizing down to its finest detail to form a whole. No\nbreak is accidental or insignificant;\u2026everything is at the same\ntime both means and end. (F. Schlegel, WM: 273\u201374)\n\n\nThis means that the romantics took the work of art to be analogous to\norganisms in yet a stronger sense\u2014not only in terms of its\nholistic unity, but also in terms of its life\u2014its\nself-organization and self-judgment. Recall the sui\ngeneris character of artworks (discussed in\n \u00a73.2):\n each work constitutes the norms according to which alone it could be\nproperly judged. In romantic terms, every work has its own\nself-judgment. Seen as such, the artwork is not a mere\nartifact, but a quasi-organism in the sense that it organizes\nand regulates itself. And like other organic products of nature, the\nwork too has, as it were, a life of its own, even though it is not\nself-organizing in the strict sense: \n\n\nJust as a child is only a thing which wants to become a human being,\nso a poem is only a product of nature which wants to become a work of\nart. (F. Schlegel, CF: #21) \n\n\nIt is the holistic unity and life in the aesthetic domain that draws\nour attention to organisms and inspires us to seek the organic\nstructure of nature as a whole.\n\nThird, following Kant, the romantics believed that the beauty of\nnature reveals the purposiveness without a purpose of nature as a\nwhole. It inspires and guides us in seeing nature as purposively\norganized\u2014organized as if according to a specific\npurpose\u2014even though we cannot attribute this purposive structure\nto any will, creator, or any end-governed activity:\n\n\nThat which reminds us of nature and thus stimulates a feeling for the\ninfinite abundance of life is beautiful. Nature is organic, and\ntherefore, the highest beauty is forever vegetative; and the same is\ntrue for morality and love. (F. Schlegel, Ideas: #86)\n\n\nWhile this view is to be found in the third Critique, the\nromantics went a few steps further than Kant: first, they considered\npurposiveness, teleological structure and life real features of\nnature, rather than regulative principles for approaching nature.\nSecond, they took these features to indicate that nature is different\nfrom self-conscious, creative human beings only in degree, but not in\nkind: like human beings, nature is end-governed. It is beauty, above\nall, that inspires this realization. As Novalis puts it,\n\u201cThrough beauty, nature transforms itself into a human\nbeing\u201d (Heinrich von Ofterdingen, NS 1), the same being\nthat governs itself by creatively and self-consciously setting ends.\nThe more we properly attend to beauty and art the more capable we\nwould be of seeing nature and humanity as different aspects of a\nsingle, unified phenomenon: \n\n\nActually criticism\u2026that doctrine which in the study of\nnature directs our attention to ourselves\u2026and in the study of\nourselves directs it to the outside world, to outer observations and\nexperiments\u2014is\u2026the most fruitful of all\nindications. It allows us to sense nature, or the outside\nworld, like a human being. (Novalis, General Draft:\n#42).\n\n\nAesthetics is central for the romantic \u201cscientific\nrevolution\u201d for yet another reason that concerns its capacity to\n\u201cenchant\u201d nature. \u201cEnchanting\u201d stands here for\nthe process of rendering nature magical, or mysterious, and thus\ninspiring reverence and awe (see Stone 2005). While bringing out\nnature\u2019s organic structure is decisive for rebutting modern\nalienation, enchantment is required primarily for challenging two\nother consequences of modern science: the threat of a detached and\nunresponsive treatment of nature and what the romantics regarded as a\nthreat of secularization. Not only did modern science portray nature\nas a brute domain of mechanism, and thus devoid of any awe-inspiring\npower, but it also rendered it completely transparent to the human\nmind, and thus lacking in the kind of mystery and magic that may\ninspire awe in a secular world. Changing our attitude towards nature\nand inspiring awe for it requires that we recover a sense of mystery\nand magic in nature, and, indeed, in everything ordinary, in\neverything that we have come to take for granted. This\nprocess\u2014of recovering a sense of mystery and magic in nature and\nthe ordinary\u2014is so central in romanticism that it takes on the\nmovement\u2019s name:\n\n\nRomanticizing is nothing other than a qualitative raising into higher\npower\u2026. By giving a higher meaning to the ordinary, a\nmysterious appearance to the ordinary, the dignity of the unacquainted\nto that of which we are acquainted, the mere appearance of infinity to\nfinite, I romanticize them. (Novalis, Logological Fragments:\n#66)\n\n\nPoetry is most suitable for the business of romanticizing by virtue of\ntwo of its main features: (a) its \u201cdefamiliarizing\u201d power,\nand, (b) its \u201cironic\u201d ability to point to the limits of\nour knowledge, and thus to what must remain mysterious\u2014beyond\nour cognitive capacities.\n\nFirst, by virtue of its power to subtly describe even the most\nconcrete of details and to bring to life even what, independently of\nit, attracts no attention, poetry has a special capacity for\ndefamiliarization\u2014a power that was first noticed by the\nromantics in their account of \u201cromanticizing\u201d, but dubbed\n\u201cdefamiliarization\u201d only later, by 20th century\nliterary theorists. By its non-ordinary use of language, attention to\ndetails and evoking power, poetry brings out in vivid colors what we\nare usually blind to, even if it is, literally, the closest and most\nfamiliar to us. Poetry has the power to make the most familiar new,\nrefreshing, and thus, other than familiar\u2014different and even\nmysterious.\n\nLike Novalis, Wordsworth is one of the first proponents of\nromanticizing in this sense. He instructs: while romantic poetry\nshould start with the most familiar and contingent\u2014\u201cthe\nincidents and situations from common life\u201d\u2014it should also\nstrive to elevate them by \n\n\nthrow[ing] over them a certain coloring of the imagination, whereby\nordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual way; and\nfurther and above all [poetry should aim] to make these incidents and\nsituations interesting by tracing in them\u2026the primary laws of\nour nature. (Preface to the Lyrical Ballads.) \n\n\nWordsworth calls on poets to write in the language of \u201clow and\nrustic life\u201d. But it is exactly the poetic use of this language\nthat allows the \u201cpassions\u201d of those whose language it\nis\u2014ordinary people\u2014to be \u201cincorporated with the\nbeautiful and permanent forms of Nature\u201d (ibid.). And it is\nthrough this process of romanticizing that nature appears again as\ngreat and awe-inspiring, \u201cThe great Nature that exists in\nwords/Of might Poets\u201d (Wordsworth, The Prelude (1805),\nBook V, lines 618\u201319).\n\nSecond, romantic poetry is essentially ironic insofar as it brings our\nfinitude, particularly the limits of our knowledge, to consciousness\n(see\n \u00a72.2).\n While romantic irony is the basis for a way of life that is centered\non humility, it also paves the way for awe and reverence for it\nsuggests that there is much beyond our comprehension, much that\nremains mysterious, incomprehensible, greater than our capacities and\npossibly infinite rather than finite like us. There is much around us\nthat merits awe.\n\nWordsworth\u2019s description of nature is possibly the most powerful\nportrayal of the awe-inspiring character of nature as it is revealed\nby the poetic imagination:\n\n\nA sense sublime\n\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\n\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\n\nAnd the round ocean, and the living air,\n\nAnd the blue sky, in the mind of man,\n\nA motion and a spirit, that impels,\n\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\n\nAnd rolls through all things.\n\n\u2026\n\nI, so long\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither came,\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather say\n\nWith warmer love, oh! With far deeper zeal\n\nOf holier love.\n\n(Wordsworth, \u201cLines Written a Few Miles above Tintern\nAbbey\u201d (1798), lines 96\u2013103 and 154\u201357, in LB)\n\n\nThrough the romantic lens, then, nature becomes alive and a locus of\nSpirit. Rather than an alien force, nature speaks to us as we speak to\nit and to each other. \n\n\nNature is a temple where living columns\n\nSometimes let confused words come out;\n\nMan walks through these forests of symbols\n\nWhich observe him with a familiar gaze.\n\n(La Nature est un temple o\u00f9 de vivants piliers\n\nLaissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles\n\nL'homme y passe \u00e0 travers des for\u00eats de symbols\n\nQui l'observent avec des regards familiers) \n\n(Baudelaire,\nCorrespondences, 1861 [2000]) \n\n\nThis is liberating and re-enchanting, but it also puts certain demands\non us, for example, the demands to love nature as we love other human\nbeings:\n\n\nOh, most magnificent and noble Nature!\n\nHave I not worshipped thee with such a love\n\nAs never mortal man before displayed?\n\nAdored thee in thy majesty of visible creation,\n\nAnd searched into thy hidden and mysterious ways\n\nAs Poet, as Philosopher, as Sage?\n\n(unknown date, Humphry Davy [1778\u20131829], Fragmentary\nRemains, 14)\n\n\nAs eccentric as the romantic call to poeticize nature and science may\ninitially seem, it is arguably of relevance today. The organic and\nre-enchanted conception of nature did not only anticipate some\ncurrents in the modern ecological movement, but it also contains\nresources for further developments in contemporary environmental\nphilosophy and philosophy of science.\n",
