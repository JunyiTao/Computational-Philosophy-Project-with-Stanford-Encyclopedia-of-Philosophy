    "main_text": "The Vienna Years: 1891\u20131895 || \u2018The Presented\u2019\n2.2 \u2018The Presented\u2019\n\nThe aim of Content and Object is to distinguish \u201cthe\npresented, in one sense, where it means the content, from the\npresented in the other sense, where it is used to designate the\nobject\u201d (Twardowski 1894, 4). Its main thesis is that in every\nmental act a content (Inhalt) and an object (Gegenstand)\nmust be distinguished. This distinction enables Twardowski to clarify\nthat \n\nTwardowski's Thesis:\n\nEvery mental phenomenon has a content and an object, and it is\ndirected towards its object, not towards its content.\n\n\nOn the basis of the distinction between content and object, Twardowski\nis in turn able to clarify Brentano's notion of \u2018object immanent\n(immanentes Objekt) in a presentation\u2019 by identifying it\nwith the notion of content, and to clarify Brentano's notion of\n\u2018object of a presentation\u2019 by identifying it with the\nnotion of object.\n\nThe distinction between the content and the object of a presentation\nrests on a psychological or epistemic difference which is, roughly\nspeaking, the mental counterpart of Frege's distinction between sense\nand reference. The object of a presentation, says Twardowski using\nZimmermann's terminology, is that which is presented in a\npresentation; the content is that through which the object is\npresented. An important argument Twardowski gives in favor of this\ndistinction\u2014and which strengthens the analogy with Frege's\ndistinction\u2014is that we can present the same object in two\ndifferent ways by having two presentations with the same object but\nwith different content. Twardowski calls such presentations\ninterchangeable presentations (Wechselvorstellungen).\nThe presentation of the Roman Juvavum and the presentation of the\nbirthplace of Mozart have the same object, Salzburg; however, their\ncontent differs. To offer a rough analogy, think of an arrow pointing\nat an object: the object is what the arrow is pointing at, the content\nis what in the arrow makes it the arrow it is, that is, its being\ndirected to that object and not to another. The act is just the\n\u2018being directed towards\u2019 of the arrow. Interchangeable\npresentations are like two arrows pointing at the same object.\n\nTwardowski thinks of the difference between act, content, and object\nin the following way. An act of presentation is a mental event which\ntakes place in our mind at a certain time. The content is literally\ninside the mind, and exists dependently on the act, as long as the act\ndoes. The object is instead independent of the mental act (1894, 1, 4;\n\u00a77, 36), and, generally speaking, not inside one's mind, although\nin some special cases the object of a presentation might be a mental\nitem. This special case is the case in which the content of some\npresentation plays the role of the object of another presentation.\nThis is not infrequent, because any time we discuss the content of a\npresentation, describing its characteristics and its relations to\nother things, we are presenting it. And for this to be possible, the\ncontent must play the role of object in the presentation(s) we are\nhaving (what we would call second-order presentations). To use the\narrow metaphor once again, second-order presentations, then, are like\nan arrow directed towards another arrow. \n\nThe way in which Twardowski relates mind and language makes the\ndistinction between content and object fairly easy to understand.\nNames are the linguistic counterpart of presentations. By\n\u2018names\u2019 Twardowski means the categorematic terms of\ntraditional logic (\u2018Barack Obama,\u2019 \u2018The President of\nthe United States,\u2019 \u2018black,\u2019\n\u2018man,\u2019\u2018he\u2019). A name has three functions:\nfirst, a name makes known that in the mind of the person using the\nname an act of presentation is taking place; secondly, a name means\nsomething; thirdly, it names an object. Twardowski takes the meaning\nof a name to be the content of the presentation that, as the name\nmakes known, is taking place in the speaker (\u00a73), that is,\nTwardowski takes meaning to be something mental and individual. This\nholds, mutatis mutandis, also for judgments. In this sense, in\nContent and Object the semantic sphere is dependent on the\nmental sphere. This trait qualifies Twardowski's position as\npsychologistic (see\n Psychologism:\n PA3). Although his position on meaning underwent a development,\nTwardowski never adhered to a platonistic conception of meaning like\nBolzano or Frege did.\n\nIf all this is intuitive, why are the object and the content of a\npresentation conflated? Twardowski maintains that the reason why\ncontent and object are often identified comes, among others, from a\nlinguistic ambiguity: both the content and the object are said to be\n\u2018presented\u2019 in a presentation (\u00a74). Twardowski offers\nan analysis of the ambiguity of the term \u2018presented\u2019 by\nappealing to the linguistic distinction between modifying and\nattributive (or determining) adjectives, and he illustrates it\nwith an analogy between the act of presenting an object and the act of\npainting a landscape. When a painter paints a landscape, she also\npaints a painting: so we can say that the painting and the landscape\nare both painted. But in this situation \u2018painted\nlandscape\u2019 can have two very different meanings. In the first\nmeaning of \u2018painted\u2019, a painted landscape is a landscape;\nin the second meaning of \u2018painted\u2019 a painted landscape is\nnot a landscape, but a painting (like in Magritte's La trahison des\nimages (1928\u20139): it is a painted pipe we are looking at, not\na pipe). In the first case, \u2018painted\u2019 is used in an\nattributive sense (the landscape is a portion of nature that happens\nto be painted by a painter in a painting); in the second case\n\u2018painted\u2019 is used in a modifying sense (that in which,\nlooking at the painting in a museum, someone may say: this is a\nlandscape!). The painted landscape in the modifying sense is a\npainting, and thus identical with the painting painted in the\nattributive sense. Analogously, in an act of presentation, the object\ncan be, like the painted landscape, said to be \u2018presented\u2019\nin two senses. The object presented in the modifying sense is\nidentical with the content presented in the attributive sense: it is\ndependent on the act of presentation, and it is what we mean by\n\u2018the object immanent in the act\u2019; the object presented in\nthe attributive sense is the object of the presentation, what happens\nto be presented in a presentation, and what is independent of the act\nof presentation.\n",
