    "main_text": "Modern Forms of Civic Education || Liberation Pedagogy\n5. Cosmopolitan Education\n\nCosmopolitanism is an emerging and, because of globalization, an\nincreasingly important topic for civic educators. In an earlier\niteration, cosmopolitan education was multicultural education.\nAccording to both, good persons need to be aware of the perspectives\nof others and the effects their decisions have on others. While\nmulticultural good citizens needed to think about the perspectives and\nplight of those living on the margins of their societies and about\nthose whose good lives deviated from their own, good citizens in\ncosmopolitanism need to think, or begin to think, of themselves as\n\u201cglobal citizens\u201d with obligations that extend across\nnational boundaries. Should and must civic education incorporate a\nglobal awareness and foster a cosmopolitan sensibility?\n\nMartha Nussbaum, for one, thinks so. Nussbaum argues that our first\nobligation must be to all persons, regardless of race, creed, class,\nor border. She does not mean that we ought to forsake our commitments\nto our family, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens. She means that\nwe ought to do nothing in our other communities or in our lives that\nwe know to be immoral from the perspective of Kant\u2019s community\nof all humanity (1996, 7). We should \u201cwork to make all human\nbeings part of our community of dialogue and concern\u201d (Ibid, 9).\nCivic education should reflect that (Ibid, 11).\n\nPhilosopher Eamonn Callan, however, thinks otherwise. Callan wants to\navoid a civic education, and the pursuit of justice that underlies it,\n\u201cthat gives pride of place to a cosmopolitan sensibility at the\ncost of particularistic affiliations\u201d (1999, p. 197). In\nCallan\u2019s view our civic education should be constructed ideally\naround the concept of \u201cliberal patriotism.\u201d Although\nliberal patriotism is an \u201cidentification with a particular,\nhistorically located project of political self-rule\u201d\u2014that\nis, American liberal democracy\u2014it nevertheless also\n\u201centails a sense of responsibility to outsiders and insiders\nalike\u2026.\u201d (Ibid, 198).\n\nOf course, the danger here is that a liberal patriot may well feel a\nsense of obligation or responsibility only when her country\nis committing the injustice. Callan points out that it is\n\u201cprecisely the thought that \u2018we Americans\u2019 have done\nthese terrible things that gave impetus [during the Vietnam war] to\ntheir horror and rage\u201d (Idem). This thought is to be contrasted\nwith our feelings and sense of responsibility when, as Callan\nsuggests, Soviet tanks rolled through Prague. Because, according to\nCallan, our politico-moral identity was not implicated in the Soviet\naction, we somehow do not have to have a similar sense of horror and\nrage. Perhaps we do not have to, but should we? Nussbaum\u2019s point\nis that we certainly should.\n\nWhat, therefore, should civic education look like? Callan provides two\nexamples: Should we \u201ccultivate a civic identity in which\npatriotic affinities are muted or disappear altogether and a\ncosmopolitan ideal of \u2018world citizenship\u2019 is\nbrought\u201d to the forefront? Or should we cultivate a kind of\npatriotism \u201cin which identification with a particular project of\ndemocratic self-rule is yet attuned to the claims of justice that both\ncivic outsiders and insiders\u201d will make (1999, 198). It appears\nthat Nussbaum would favor the first, while Callan favors the\nsecond.\n\nPerhaps these two are not the only options. In her metaphor of\nconcentric identity circles Nussbaum argues that we ought to try to\nbring the outer circles of our relationships, the circle of all\nhumanity, closer to the center, to our selves and to our loved ones\n(1996, 9). By doing so, we do not push out of our identities those\nparticular relationships of significance to us. Instead, we need to\ntake into consideration the effects that our moral and political\ndecisions have on all of humanity. If our civic education helps us\nextend our sympathies, as Hume proposed, and if we could do so without\npaying the price of muting or eliminating our local and national\naffinities, then would Nussbaum and Callan agree on such a civic\neducation?\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider that patriotism itself seems to have\nits own version of concentric circles. For example, Theodore Roosevelt\nwarned against \u201cthat overexaltation of the little community at\nthe expense of the great nation.\u201d Here is a nod toward\nRoosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Nationalism\u201d as opposed to what he\ncalled \u201cthe patriotism of the\n village.\u201d[16]\n If we move from the village to the nation, then can\u2019t we move\nfrom the nation to the world? As Alexander Pope wrote in \u201cAn\nEssay on Man\u201d: \u201cGod loves from Whole to Parts; but human\nsoul/Must rise from Individual to the Whole/\u2026Friend, parent,\nneighbor first it will embrace/His country next, and next all human\nrace.\u201d\n\nIs it ever too early to begin educating children about the cultures,\ncustoms, values, ideas, and beliefs of people from around the world?\nWill this undercut our commitment and even devotion to our own family,\nneighborhood, region, and nation? No civic education must consist\nexclusively either of love of one\u2019s community and a patriotic\naffiliation with one\u2019s country or of preparation for world\ncitizenship\u2014a term that implies, at the least, a world state.\nThere ought to be a composite that will work here.\n\nIf the purpose of civic education is to generate in the young those\nvalues that underscore successful participation in our liberal\ndemocracies, then the task facing educators, whether in elementary\nschool, secondary school, or post-secondary school, might be far\neasier than we imagine. There seems to be a direct correlation between\nyears in school and an increase in tolerance of difference (Nie et\nal., 1996). An increase of tolerance can lead to an increase of\nrespect for those holding divergent views. Such increases could\ncertainly help engender a cosmopolitan sensibility. But does the\nnumber of years in school correlate with a willingness to participate\nin the first place? For example, the number of Americans going to\ncollege has increased dramatically over the past 50 years, yet voting\nin elections and political participation in general are still woefully\nlow.\n\nPerhaps public schools should not teach any virtue that is unrelated\nto the attainment of academic skills, which to some is the paramount,\nif not the sole, purpose of schooling. But shouldn\u2019t all\nstudents learn not just the skills but also the predispositions\nrequired to participate in the \u201cconscious social\nreproduction\u201d of our democracies, as Gutmann argues? If our\ndemocracies are important and robust, then do our citizens need such\npredispositions to see the value of participation? And if we say that\nour democracies are not robust enough, then shouldn\u2019t our\nstudents be striving to reinvigorate, or invigorate, our democratic\nsystems? Will they need infusions of patriotism to do that? If\ntolerance and respect are democratic virtues, then do we fail our\nstudents when we do not tolerate or respect their desires as good\npersons to eschew civic participation even though this violates what\nwe think of as the duties of good citizens?\n\nAs stated earlier, civic education in a democracy must prepare\ncitizens to participate in and thereby perpetuate the system; at the\nsame time, it must prepare them to challenge what they see as\ninequities and injustices within that system. Yet a civic education\nthat encourages students to challenge the nature and scope of our\ndemocracies runs the risk of turning off our students and turning them\naway from participation. But if that civic education has offered more\nthan simply critique, if its basis is critical thinking, which\ninvolves developing a tolerance of, if not an appreciation for,\ndifference and divergence, as well as a willingness and even eagerness\nfor political action, then galvanized citizens can make our systems\nmore robust. Greater demands on our citizens, like higher expectations\nof our students, often lead to stronger performances. As Mill reminds\nus, \u201cif circumstances allow the amount of public duty assigned\nhim to be considerable, it makes him an educated man\u201d (Ibid,\n233).\n",
