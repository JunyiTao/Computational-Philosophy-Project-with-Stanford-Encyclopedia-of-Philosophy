The Place of Political Philosophy within Kant\u2019s Philosophical System\n\nKant\u2019s political philosophy is a branch of practical philosophy,\none-half of one of the broadest divisions in Kant\u2019s thought\nbetween practical and theoretical philosophy. Political philosophy is\nalso to be distinguished within practical philosophy from both\nempirically-based elements and from virtue proper. The separation from\nvirtue is treated later in this section. Regarding the empirical\nelements, it is worth mentioning that practical philosophy, as a set\nof rules governing free behavior of rational beings, covers all human\naction in both its pure and applied (empirical, or\n\u201cimpure\u201d) aspects. Pure practical philosophy, the rational\nelements of practical philosophy in abstraction from anything\nempirical, is called by Kant \u201cmetaphysics of morals\u201d\n(4:388). Kant so emphasized the priority of the pure aspect of\npolitical philosophy that he wrote part of his essay \u201cOn the\nCommon Saying: That May be Correct in Theory, but it is of No Use in\nPractice\u201d in opposition to the view he associates with Hobbes\nthat the politician need not be concerned with abstract right but only\nwith pragmatic governance (8:289\u2013306). Yet Kant also included\nthe more pragmatic, impure, empirical study of human behavior as part\nof practical philosophy. For ethics in general, Kant called the\nempirical study of human beings as agents within particular cultures\nand with particular natural capacities \u201canthropology\u201d.\nSome of Kant\u2019s social philosophy fits into this rubric (see\nsection 10). While Kant always based his claims about right on a\npriori principle, he was applying the a priori principles to actually\nexisting beings, so he did at times include empirical claims in his\nanalysis. Some of these empirical claims are quite general and\nuncontroversial (e.g. that there are a plurality of human beings\nliving on the limited surface of a sphere) while others are more\nspecific to Kant\u2019s own time, place, and individual biases (e.g. his\nviews on women).\n\nPolitical philosophy is not only a branch of Kant\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, it strongly depends upon Kant\u2019s core practical\nphilosophy for its basis. Kant\u2019s practical philosophy and the\ncategorical imperative that governs it were intended to form the\nground not only for what is thought today to be ethics proper but also\nfor everything that broadly speaking had to do with deliberative human\nbehavior. He defined practical philosophy as that concerned with\n\u201crules of behavior in regard to free choice\u201d, as opposed\nto theoretical philosophy that concerned \u201cthe rule of\nknowledge\u201d (Kant 27: 243). Practical philosophy provided rules\nto govern human deliberative action. The Groundwork for the\nMetaphysics of Morals provided Kant\u2019s main arguments that\nthe categorical imperative is the supreme rule for human deliberative\naction. In its Preface, he notes that the Groundwork is to be\na preparatory book for a future Metaphysics of Morals. Twelve\nyears later he published that Metaphysics of Morals in two\nparts, the \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d and the \u201cDoctrine of\nVirtue\u201d. Both are equally parts of Kant\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, and both thus have the categorical imperative as their\nhighest principle.\n\nThe book Metaphysics of Morals has two distinct parts: the\n\u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d and the \u201cDoctrine of\nVirtue\u201d. Kant sought to separate political rights and duties\nfrom what we might call morals in the narrow sense. He limits right by\nstating three conditions (6:230) that have to be met for something to\nbe enforceable as right: first, right concerns only actions that have\ninfluence on other persons, directly or indirectly, meaning duties to\nthe self are excluded; second, right does not concern the wish but\nonly the choice of others, meaning that not mere desires but only\ndecisions which bring about actions are at stake; and third, right\ndoes not concern the matter of the other\u2019s act but only the\nform, meaning no particular desires or ends are assumed on the part of\nthe agents. As an example of the latter he considers trade, which for\nright must have the form of being freely agreed by both parties but\ncan have any matter or purpose the agents want. These criteria appear\nto be less rigid than Kant ultimately intends, for the term\n\u201cinfluence\u201d is vague enough that it might include\nfar-reaching minor effects. They would also include under right\nactions even those imperfect duties that \u201cinfluence\u201d\nothers by improving their lot, such as beneficent acts of charity.\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s \u201charm principle\u201d does not face\nthis problem since it specifies that the influence to be subject to\nlaw is always negative. While Kant must include consideration of\nbeneficent action as part of right, he does not conclude that\nbeneficent actions are required by right but only that most are\npermitted by right and others violate right. His focus on free\nindividual choice entails that any beneficent action that interferes\nwith or usurps the recipient\u2019s free choice is wrong (for\nexample, improving the recipient\u2019s property without permission\nas opposed to merely donating money to a fund made available to the\nrecipient at the recipient\u2019s discretion). Kant summarizes these\nconditions with a definition of the concept of right as \u201cthe sum of\nthe conditions under which the choice of one can be united with the\nchoice of another in accordance with a universal law of freedom\u201d\n(6:230).\n\nIn addition to these three conditions for right, Kant also offers\ndirect contrasts between right and virtue. He thinks both relate to\nfreedom but in different ways: right concerns outer freedom and virtue\nconcerns inner freedom (being master of one\u2019s own passions)\n(6:406\u201307). Right concerns acts themselves independent of the\nmotive an agent may have for performing them, virtue concerns the\nproper motive for dutiful actions (6:218\u2013221). In another\nformulation (6:380\u201381) he says that right concerns universality\nas a formal condition of freedom while virtue concerns a necessary end\nbeyond the mere formality of universality, thus appearing to tie the\ndistinction to the first two formulas of the categorical imperative in\nthe Groundwork. In yet another he says that right concerns\nnarrow duties and virtue wide duties (6:390). In the Feyerabend\nlectures, Kant notes that right is the subset of morally correct\nactions that are also coercible (27:1327). These various alternative\nformulations of the distinction would exclude imperfect duties not\nbecause imperfect duties do not \u201cinfluence\u201d others (they\ndo) but because, as imperfect, they cannot be coerced in particular\ninstances, since imperfect duties always allow for the moderating role\nof an individual\u2019s inclinations. While these various\nformulations of the distinction appear to be quite different, they can\nin general be summarized by saying that right concerns outer action\ncorresponding to perfect duty that affects others regardless of the\nindividual\u2019s internal motivations or goals.\n2. Freedom as the Basis of the State\n\n\u201cThere is only one innate right,\u201d says Kant,\n\u201cFreedom (independence from being constrained by another\u2019s\nchoice), insofar as it can coexist with the freedom of every other in\naccordance with a universal law\u201d (6:237). Kant rejects any other\nbasis for the state, in particular arguing that the welfare of\ncitizens cannot be the basis of state power. He argues that a state\ncannot legitimately impose any particular conception of happiness upon\nits citizens (8:290\u201391). To do so would be for the ruler to\ntreat citizens as children, assuming that they are unable to\nunderstand what is truly useful or harmful to themselves.\n\nThis claim must be understood in light of Kant\u2019s more general\nclaim that moral law cannot be based upon happiness or any other given\nempirical good. In the Groundwork Kant contrasts an ethics of\nautonomy, in which the will (Wille, or practical reason\nitself) is the basis of its own law, from the ethics of heteronomy, in\nwhich something independent of the will, such as happiness, is the\nbasis of moral law (4:440\u201341). In the Critique of Practical\nReason he argues that happiness (the agreeableness of life when\nthings go in accordance with one\u2019s wishes and desires), although\nuniversally sought by human beings, is not specific enough to entail\nany particular universal desires in human beings. Further, even were\nthere any universal desires among human beings, those desires would,\nas empirical, be merely contingent and thus unworthy of being the\nbasis of any pure moral law (5:25\u201326). No particular conception\nof happiness can be the basis of the pure principle of the state, and\nthe general conception of happiness is too vague to serve as the basis\nof a law. Hence, a \u201cuniversal principle of right\u201d cannot\nbe based upon happiness but only on something truly universal, such as\nfreedom. The \u201cuniversal principle of right\u201d Kant offers is\nthus \u201cAny action is right if it can coexist with\neveryone\u2019s freedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on\nits maxim the freedom of choice of each can coexist with\neveryone\u2019s freedom in accordance with a universal law\u201d\n(6:230).\n\nThis explains why happiness is not universal, but not why freedom is\nuniversal. By \u201cfreedom\u201d in political philosophy, Kant is\nnot referring to the transcendental conception of freedom usually\nassociated with the problem of the freedom of the will amid\ndeterminism in accordance with laws of nature, a solution to which is\nprovided in the Third Antinomy of the Critique of Pure\nReason. Rather, freedom in political philosophy is defined, as in\nthe claim above about the only innate right, as \u201cindependence\nfrom being constrained by another\u2019s choice\u201d. His concern\nin political philosophy is not with laws of nature\ndetermining a human being\u2019s choice but by other human\nbeings determining a human being\u2019s choice, hence the kind\nof freedom Kant is concerned with in political philosophy is\nindividual freedom of action. Still, the universality of political\nfreedom is linked to transcendental freedom. Kant assumes that a human\nbeing\u2019s use of choice (at least when it is properly guided by\nreason) is free in the transcendental sense. Since every human being\ndoes enjoy transcendental freedom by virtue of being rational, freedom\nof choice is a universal human attribute. And this freedom of choice\nis to be respected and promoted, even when this choice is not\nexercised in rational or virtuous activity. Presumably respecting\nfreedom of choice involves allowing it to be effective in determining\nactions; this is why Kant calls political freedom, or\n\u201cindependence from being constrained by another\u2019s\nchoice\u201d, the only innate right. One might still object that this\nfreedom of choice is incapable of being the basis of a pure principle\nof right for the same reason that happiness was incapable of being its\nbasis, namely, that it is too vague in itself and that when specified\nby the particular decisions individuals make with their free choice,\nit loses its universality. Kant holds that this problem does not arise\nfor freedom, since freedom of choice can be understood both in terms\nof its content (the particular decisions individuals make) and its\nform (the free, unconstrained nature of choice of any possible\nparticular end) (6:230). Freedom is universal in the proper sense\nbecause, unlike happiness, it can be understood in such a way that it\nis susceptible to specification without losing its universality. Right\nwill be based on the form of free choice.\n\nThe very existence of a state might seem to some as a limitation of\nfreedom, since a state possesses power to control the external freedom\nof individual citizens through force. This is the basic claim of\nanarchism. Kant holds in contrast that there is no innate right to\nunlimited freedom but only an innate right to freedom \u201cinsofar as it\ncan coexist with the freedom of every other in accordance with\nuniversal law\u201d (6:237). Rightful freedom for each individual is\nlimited, and the state is not an impediment to freedom but is the\nmeans for freedom. State action that is a hindrance to freedom can,\nwhen properly directed, support and maintain rightful freedom if the\nstate action is aimed at hindering actions that themselves would\nhinder the rightful freedom of others and thus be wrongful uses of\nfreedom. Given a subject\u2019s action that would limit the freedom\nof another subject, the state may hinder the first subject to defend\nthe second by \u201chindering a hindrance to freedom\u201d. Such\nstate coercion is compatible with the maximal freedom demanded in the\nprinciple of right because it does not reduce overall freedom but\ninstead provides the necessary background conditions needed to secure\nrightful freedom. The amount of freedom lost by the first subject\nthrough direct state coercion is equal to the amount gained by the\nsecond subject through lifting the hindrance to actions. State action\nsustains the maximal amount of freedom consistent with identical\nfreedom for all without reducing it.\n\nFreedom is not the only basis for principles underlying the state. In\n\u201cTheory and Practice\u201d Kant makes freedom the first of\nthree principles (8:290):\n\nThe freedom of every member of the state as a human being.\nThe equality of each with every other as a subject.\nThe independence of every member of a commonwealth as a\ncitizen.\n\n\nFreedom as discussed in \u201cTheory and Practice\u201d stresses the\nautonomous right of all individuals to conceive of happiness in their\nown way. Interference with another\u2019s freedom is understood as\ncoercing the other to be happy as the former sees fit. The direct link\nto action comes when pursuing that autonomously chosen conception of\nhappiness. Each may pursue happiness as they see fit provided that\ntheir pursuit does not infringe upon others\u2019 similar\npursuits.\n\nEquality is not substantive but formal. Each member of the state is\nequal to every other member of the state before the law. Each has\nequal coercive right, that is, the right to invoke the power of the\nstate to enforce the laws on one\u2019s behalf. (Kant exempts the\nhead of state from this equality, since the head of state cannot be\ncoerced by anyone else). This formal equality is perfectly compatible\nwith the inequality of members of the state in income, physical power,\nmental ability, possessions, etc. Further, this equality supports an\nequality of opportunity: every office or rank in the political\nstructure must be open to all subjects without regard for any\nhereditary or similar restrictions.\n\nIndependence concerns citizens as subject to laws they give\nthemselves, i.e. as co-legislators of the laws. This self-governance\ncan be understood as the application in political philosophy of the\nidea of autonomy of the will in the Groundwork. While this\nprinciple appears to require universal democratic decision making for\nparticular laws, Kant uses empirically-based reasoning to argue that\nthis full citizenship does not extend to all. Kant excludes women and\nchildren, simply claiming that their exclusion is natural, as well as\nanyone who is not \u201cone\u2019s own master\u201d, i.e. lacks economic\nself-sufficiency. These individuals who are dependent upon others in\nlife have what Kant calls \u201cpassive\u201d citizenship in the Doctrine of\nRight. Hence decision making is not universal. While Kant thereby\ndenies women and others full citizenship in the ability to take part\nin legislation, he stresses that he is not denying them the rights\nentailed by freedom and equality as \u201cpassive\u201d members of\nthe state. In the Doctrine of Right he also adds that the\npolitical system must allow anyone in the passive condition to work\ntheir way up to independence and an active condition. With this\nrestriction in mind, particular laws are to be determined by a\nmajority of the citizens with voting rights, as will be discussed in\nsection 4.\n3. Social Contract\n\nKant provides two distinct discussions of social contract. One\nconcerns property and will be treated in more detail in section 5\nbelow. The second discussion of social contract comes in the essay\n\u201cTheory and Practice\u201d in the context of an a priori\nrestriction on the legitimate policies the sovereign may pursue. There\nis also a briefer statement in the Doctrine of Right\n(6:315\u201316). The sovereign must recognize the \u201coriginal\ncontract\u201d as an idea of reason that forces the sovereign to\n\u201cgive his laws in such a way that they could have arisen from\nthe united will of a whole people and to regard each subject, insofar\nas he wants to be a citizen, as if he has joined in voting for such a\nwill\u201d (8:297). This original contract, Kant stresses, is not a\nhistorical event but only an idea of reason, that is, is a concept\ngenerated by reason itself with no possible empirical reference that\nis used by reason to guide empirical thought or action. Any rights and\nduties stemming from an original contract do so not because of any\nparticular historical provenance, but because of the rightful\nrelations embodied in the original contract. No empirical act, as a\nhistorical act would be, could be the foundation of any rightful\nduties or rights. The idea of an original contract limits the\nsovereign as legislator. No law may be promulgated that \u201ca whole\npeople could not possibly give its consent to\u201d (8:297). The\nconsent at issue, however, is also not an empirical consent based upon\nany actual act. The set of actual particular desires of citizens is\nnot the basis of determining whether they could possibly consent to a\nlaw. Rather, the kind of possibility at issue appears to be one of\nrational possible unanimity based upon fair distributions of burdens\nand rights in abstraction from empirical facts or desires.\nKant\u2019s two examples both exemplify this consideration of\npossible rational unanimity. His first example is a law that would\nprovide hereditary privileges to members of a certain class of\nsubjects. This law would be unjust because it would be irrational for\nthose who would not be members of this class to agree to accept fewer\nprivileges than members of the class. One might say that no possible\nempirical information could cause all individuals to agree to this\nlaw. Kant\u2019s second example concerns a war tax. If the tax is\nadministered fairly, it would not be unjust. Kant adds that even if\nthe actual citizens opposed the war, the war tax would be just because\nit is possible that the war is being waged for legitimate reasons that\nthe state but not the citizens know about. Here possible empirical\ninformation might cause all citizens to approve the law. In both these\nexamples, the conception of \u201cpossible consent\u201d abstracts\nfrom actual desires individual citizens have. The possible consent is\nnot based upon a hypothetical vote given actual preferences but is\nbased on a rational conception of agreement given any possible\nempirical information.\n\nKant\u2019s view is similar to the social contract theory of Hobbes\nin a few important respects. The social contract is not a historical\ndocument and does not involve a historical act. In fact it can be\ndangerous to the stability of the state to even search history for\nsuch empirical justification of state power (6:318). The current state\nmust be understood, regardless of its origin, to embody the social\ncontact. The social contract is a rational justification for state\npower, not a result of actual deal-making among individuals or between\nthem and a government. The social contract is not voluntary; rather,\nindividuals may be forced into the civil condition against their\nconsent (6:256). Social contract is not based on any actual consent\nsuch as a voluntary choice to form a civil society along with others.\nSince the social contract reflects reason, each human being as a\nrational being already contains the basis for rational agreement to\nthe state. Are individuals then coerced to recognize their subjection\nto state power against their will? Since Kant defines\n\u201cwill\u201d as \u201cpractical reason itself\u201d\n(Groundwork, 4:412), the answer for him is \u201cno.\u201d\nIf one defines \u201cwill\u201d as arbitrary choice, then the answer\nis \u201cyes.\u201d Kant holds that individuals can be coerced to\nleave the state of nature and enter a civil condition (6:307), but\nsince the state of nature, like the social contract, is merely an idea\nof reason, this authorization for coercion means that now individuals\nare rightfully subject to the coercive power of the state regardless\nof any explicit consent on their part. This dichotomy between\nagreement based on one\u2019s empirical will and agreement based on one\u2019s\npure practical reason also arises with regard to Kant\u2019s theory\nof punishment (section 7). A substantial difference between Kant on\nthe one hand and Hobbes and Locke on the other hand is that the latter\nbase their arguments on the individual benefit for each party to the\ncontract, whereas Kant bases his argument on Right itself, understood\nas freedom for all persons in general, not just for the individual\nbenefit that the parties to the contract obtain in their own\nparticular freedom. To this extent Kant is influenced more by\nRousseau\u2019s idea of the General Will.\n4. Republics, Enlightenment, and Democracy\n\nKant was a central figure in the philosophy of the Enlightenment. One\nof his popular essays, \u201cAn Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment?\u201d discusses Enlightenment in terms of the use of\nan individual\u2019s own reason (8:35f). To be Enlightened is to\nemerge from one\u2019s self-incurred minority (juvenile) status to a\nmature ability to think for oneself. In another essay, \u201cWhat\nDoes it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thought?\u201d Kant defines\nEnlightenment as \u201cthe maxim of always thinking for\noneself\u201d (8:146). \u201cWhat is Enlightenment\u201d\ndistinguishes between the public and private uses of reason. The\nprivate use of reason is, for government officials, the use of reason\nthey must utilize in their official positions. For example, a member\nof the clergy (who in Kant\u2019s Prussia were funded by the state)\nis required to espouse the official doctrine in sermons and teachings.\nThe public use of reason is the use an individual makes of reason as a\nscholar reaching the public world of readers. For example, the same\nmember of the clergy could, as a scholar, present perceived\nshortcomings in that very same doctrine. Similarly, military officers\ncould, using public reason, question the value or appropriateness of\nthe orders they receive, but in their functions as military officers,\nusing private reason, they are obliged to obey the same orders. Kant\nintends the debates using public reason to cover legislation and acts\nof the state as well. Since the sovereign might err, and individual\ncitizens have the right to attempt to correct the error under the\nassumption that the sovereign does not intend to err: \u201ca citizen\nmust have, with the approval of the ruler himself, the authorization\nto make known publicly his opinions about what it is in the\nruler\u2019s arrangements that seems to him to be a wrong against the\ncommonwealth,\u201d writes Kant in \u201cTheory and Practice\u201d.\nThis freedom of the pen is \u201cthe sole palladium\u201d of the\nrights of the people, for without this means the people would have no\nway to make any claims to rights at all (8:304).\n\nOne might expect from this emphasis that Kant would insist that the\nproper political system is one that not only allows individuals to\nthink for themselves about political issues, but also contains a\nmechanism such as voting to translate those well reasoned opinions\ninto government policy. One would be wrong. Kant does not stress\nself-government. In his discussion in \u201cPerpetual Peace\u201d of\nthe traditional division of the types of government Kant classifies\ngovernments in two dimensions (8:352). The first is the \u201cform of\nsovereignty\u201d, concerning who rules, and here Kant identifies the\ntraditional three forms: either rule by one person, rule by a small\ngroup of people, or rule by all people. The second is the \u201cform\nof government\u201d concerning how those people rule, and here Kant\noffers a variation on the traditional good/bad dichotomy: either\nrepublican or despotic. By \u201crepublican,\u201d Kant means\n\u201cseparation of the executive power (the government) from the\nlegislative power\u201d. Despotism is their unity such that the same\nruler both gives and enforces laws, in essence making an individual\nprivate will into the public will. Republics require representation in\norder to ensure that the executive power only enforces the public will\nby insisting that the executive enforce only laws that representatives\nof the people, not the executive itself, make. But a republic is\ncompatible with a single individual acting as legislator provided that\nothers act as executives; for example, a monarch would issue laws in\nthe name of the people\u2019s will but the monarch\u2019s ministers\nwould enforce those laws. Kant\u2019s claim that such a government is\nrepublican (see also 27:1384) showcases his view that a republican\ngovernment need not require actual participation of the people in\nmaking the laws, even through elected representatives, as long as the\nlaws are promulgated with the whole united will of the people in mind.\nKant does, nonetheless, think that an elected representative\nlegislator is the best form of a republic (8:353). Whether elected or\nunelected, the moral person who holds legislative power is\nrepresentative of the people united as a whole, and is thus\nsovereign.\n\nWhen Kant discusses voting for representatives, he adheres to many\nprevailing prejudices of the time (8:295). The right to vote requires\n\u201cbeing one\u2019s own master\u201d and hence having property\nor some skill that can support one independently. The reason given for\nthis, that those who must acquire something from another to make a\nliving alienate what belongs to them, is so vague that Kant himself\nadmits in a footnote \u201cIt is, I admit, somewhat difficult to\ndetermine what is required in order to be able to claim the rank of a\nhuman being who is his own master.\u201d Kant also leaves women out\nof the voting populations for what he calls \u201cnatural\u201d\nreasons which are left unspecified. Individuals who are not given the\nright to vote are deemed \u201cpassive\u201d citizens of the state who\nnonetheless enjoy all other rights identified with freedom and\nequality (6:315). Kant insists that in line with this freedom and\nequality, all passive citizens of the state could work their way up to\nthe full status of \u201cactive\u201d citizen.\n\nKant\u2019s state, then, does not require that actual decisions are\nmade by the people at large, even through elected representatives. He\nholds that a single individual or small group can themselves\nadequately represent the people at large simply by adopting the point\nof view of the people. Insistence on a representative system (8:353)\nis not insistence on an elected representative system.\nNonetheless it is clear that Kant holds that such an elective\nrepresentative system is ideal. Republican constitutions, he claims,\nare prone to avoid war because, when the consent of the people is\nneeded, they will consider the costs they must endure in a war\n(fighting, taxes, destruction of property, etc), whereas a\nnon-republican ruler may be insulated from such concerns. In the\n\u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d he also notes that a republican system\nnot only represents the people but does so \u201cby all the citizens\nunited and acting through their delegates\u201d (6:342).\n5. Property and Contract Right\n\nThe main text of the \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d begins with a\ndiscussion of property, showing the importance of this right for the\nimplementation of the innate right to freedom. Property is defined as\nthat \u201cwith which I am so connected that another\u2019s use of\nit without my consent would wrong me\u201d (6:245). In one sense, if\nI am holding an object such as an apple, and another snatches it from\nmy hand, I have been wronged because in taking the object from my\nphysical possession, the other harms me because my body is affected.\nKant calls this \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201csensible\u201d\npossession. It is not a sufficient sense of possession to count as\nrightful possession of an object. Rightful possession must be\npossession of an object so that another\u2019s use of the object\nwithout my consent harms me even when I am not physically affected and\nnot currently using the object. If someone plucks an apple from my\ntree, no matter where I am and no matter whether I am even aware of\nthe loss I am prevented from using that apple. Kant calls this\n\u201cintelligible possession\u201d.\n\nHis proof that there must be this intelligible possession and not\nmerely physical possession turns on the application of human choice\n(6:246). An object of choice is one that some human has the capacity\nto use as means for various ends or purposes. Rightful possession\nwould be the right to make use of such an object. Suppose that for\nsome particular object, no one is allowed to have rightful possession.\nThis would mean that a usable object would be beyond possible use. But\nputting an object beyond rightful use when humans have the capacity to\nuse it would \u201cannihilate\u201d the object in a practical\nrespect, treat it as nothing. Kant claims that this is problematic\nbecause in a practical respect an object is considered merely as an\nobject of possible choice. This consideration of the mere form alone,\nthe object simply as an object of choice, cannot contain any\nprohibition of use for an object, for any such prohibition would be\nfreedom limiting itself for no reason. Thus in a practical respect an\nobject cannot be treated as nothing, and so the object must be\nconsidered as at least potentially in rightful possession of some\nhuman being or other. So all objects within human capacity for use\nmust be subject to rightful or intelligible possession.\n\nKant calls this postulate that all objects must be treated as\npotential property of someone a \u201cpermissive law of practical reason\u201d\n(6:247). It authorizes individuals to act to obtain objects as\nproperty, thus declaring a right to particular objects that goes\nbeyond the innate right to freedom. The particular distribution of\nprivate property is a result of these particular acts of individuals.\nThis act of an individual does not alone create the property right in\nthose objects because such a one-sided declaration would violate the\nuniversality of external right, since if one human being is to have\nintelligible possession of a particular object, all other human beings\nmust refrain from using that object, and thus one individual is\nunilaterally limiting the freedom of others. Kant recognizes that any\nunilateral declaration by one person that an object belongs to that\nperson alone would infringe on the freedom of others. The only way\nthat intelligible possession is possible without violating the\nprinciple of right is if there is an agreement that puts all under an\nobligation to recognize each other\u2019s intelligible possessions.\nEach person must acknowledge an obligation to refrain from using\nobjects that belong to others. The individual act of declaring a\nparticular object as property is rightful only when it harmonizes with\nother similar individual acts of other persons regarding other\nobjects. Since no individual will can rightfully make and enforce such\na law obligating everyone to respect others\u2019 property, this\nmutual obligation is possible only in accordance with a\n\u201ccollective general (common) and powerful will\u201d, in other\nwords, only in a civil condition. The state itself obligates all\ncitizens to respect the property of other citizens. The state\nfunctions as an objective, disinterested institution that resolves\ndisputes about individual property and enforces compliance with those\ndeterminations. Without a state to enforce these property rights, they\nare impossible.\n\nThis creation of a civil condition is Kant\u2019s first manner of\ndiscussing a social contract mentioned in section 3. Prior to a civil\ncondition the only manner in which human beings can control things is\nthrough empirical possession, actual occupation and use of land and\nobjects. In order to gain full property rights to land and objects,\nindividuals must all agree to respect the property rights of others in\na social contract. They are in fact required, as a duty, to enter into\na social condition in order to defend their own and everyone\u2019s\nproperty rights. Only in such a society can persons exercise their\nfreedom, that is their pursuit of ends, by legitimately using objects\nfor their own purposes without regard for others. Hence a social\ncontract is the rational justification of the state because state\npower is necessary for each individual to be guaranteed access to some\nproperty in order to realize their freedom. While the discussion in\n\u201cTheory and Practice\u201d of a social contract as an idea of\nreason constrains the sovereign in promulgating laws, it does not\nexplain why the state is necessary in the first place. The discussion\nin \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d of property as the basis of a\nsocial contract explains why individuals are in fact rationally\nrequired to enter into a social contract.\n\nA puzzle arises here with regard to property. If individuals are not\nable to have any intelligible property prior to the existence of a\nstate, yet the state\u2019s role is to enforce property rights, where\ndoes the original assignment of property to individuals occur? John\nLocke had famously avoided this problem in his theory of property by\nmaking property a product of a single individual\u2019s activity. By\n\u201cmixing\u201d one\u2019s labor with an object in the commons,\none comes to have property in the object. Kant objects to\nLocke\u2019s theory of property on the grounds that it makes property\na relation between a person and a thing rather than between the wills\nof several persons (6:268\u201369). Since property is a relation of\nwills that can occur only in a civil condition under a common\nsovereign power, Kant suggests that prior to this civil condition\nproperty can be acquired only in anticipation of and in conformity\nwith a civil condition. Provisional property is initial physical\nappropriation of objects with the intention of making them rightful\nproperty in a state (6:264, 267).\n\nProperty is of three types for Kant (6:247\u201348, 260). First is\nthe right to a thing, to corporeal objects in space. Examples of these\nthings include land, animals, and tools. The second is the right\nagainst a person, the right to coerce that person to perform an\naction. This is contract right. The third is the \u201cright to a\nperson akin to a right to a thing\u201d, the most controversial of\nKant\u2019s categories in which he includes spouses, children, and\nservants. Of these three types, the first has already been discussed\nin relation to acquisition. The second of these, contract right,\ninvolves the possession by one person of the \u201cdeed\u201d of\nanother (6:274). One person is able to control the choice of another\nin order to apply the other\u2019s causal powers to some end. At\nfirst glance this contract right appears to violate the second formula\nof the categorical imperative which states that persons are to be\ntreated always as ends and never merely as means. A contract appears\nto be a case in which an individual is used merely as a means. A\nhomeowner, for example, hires a repair specialist specifically as a\nmeans for repairing a house. Kant turns the tables on this problem by\nshowing that a contract is \u201cthe united choice of two\npersons\u201d and thus treats both parties to the contract as ends.\nFor example, he notes that the repair specialist who is contracted to\nwork on a house has agreed to the exchange in order to obtain a\npersonal end, namely, money (27:1319). Each party to the contract is\nboth means for the other and an end.\n\nThe third category, the right to a person akin to a thing, is\nKant\u2019s own fusion of the traditional categories of property and\ncontract. Kant argues that some contracts or rightful obligations such\nas the parent-child relation allow one party to the contract to\ncontrol not only the choice of the other, but also to possess some\npower over the body of the other, such as the power to insist that the\nother remain in the household. Kant sees the spousal relation, the\nparent-child relation, and the master-servant relation as the three\ntypes of this rightful relation. In the case of children Kant\nconsiders not only the parent\u2019s duty to nurture the child along with a\nright to control the child but also the status of an adult child\nremaining in the household, similar to the status of a servant.\nRegarding servants Kant gives the head of the household a right to\ncontrol them while under contract without allowing any lifelong\ncontrol, which would amount to slavery as a complete denial of the\nservant\u2019s freedom. His discussion of marriage, which focuses on this\nlegal relation in abstraction from empirical considerations such as\nlove, treats marriage as reciprocal access to the other\u2019s sexual\norgans. While each partner in the marriage is using the other as a\nmeans for enjoyment and thus as a thing, the marriage contract\u2019s\nreciprocity \u201crestores\u201d their personality as ends in\nthemselves (6:278). Kant describes this legal relation as equal in\nthese powers of possession and in the communal property. Both men and\nwomen must have reciprocal relations of this kind; for example, a\nman\u2019s use of a prostitute as a thing violates her dignity as an\nend in herself. Despite this equality at the level of a priori right,\nKant holds that men have a natural superiority in their capacity to\npromote the couple\u2019s common interest, and that laws codifying\nhusbands\u2019s rule over wives are not unjust. Certainly\nKant\u2019s personal sexism plays a part in his views on marriage, as\nit did in his exclusion of women from voting. Some of Kant\u2019s own\ncontemporaries objected to his views on women, and an early review of\nthe \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d rejecting Kant\u2019s novel\ncategory of property to persons akin to things prompted him to respond\nin an Appendix to the book\u2019s second edition (6:356\u2013372, esp\n6:357\u2013361).\n6. Rebellion and Revolution\n\nThe very idea of a right to rebel against the government is\nincoherent, Kant argued, because the embodiment of all right is the\nactually existing state. By this he did not mean that any actually\nexisting state is always completely just, or that merely by virtue of\nhaving power, the state could determine what justice is. He meant that\na rightful condition, the opposite of the state of nature, is possible\nonly when there is some means for individuals to be governed by the\n\u201cgeneral legislative will\u201d (6:320). Any state embodies the\ngeneral legislative will better than no state. While such reasoning\nseems pragmatic, it is not. It is instead based upon the claims above\nthat a rightful condition requires the centralizing of coercive power\nin a state as the only means of bringing about reciprocal coercion,\nobligation, and objective settlement of disputes. Kant also argues\nthat a right to rebel would require that a people be authorized to\nresist the state. This kind of authorization for action, however, is\nan exercise of sovereign power, and any people who claimed such a\nright would be claiming that it (the people) rather than the state\nembodies sovereign power. It would thus \u201cmake the people, as\nsubject, by one and the same judgment sovereign over him to whom it is\nsubject\u201d (6:320). This is a contradiction. The nature of\nsovereignty is such that sovereign power cannot be shared. Were it\nshared between the state and the people, then when a dispute arose\nbetween them, who would judge whether the state or the people are\ncorrect? There being no higher sovereign power to make such a\njudgment, all other means for resolving the dispute fall outside of\nrightful relations. This role of judgment relates to the judgment that\nKant discusses with regard to the social contract. Under the idea of a\nsocial contract, the sovereign legislator may not make a law that the\npeople could not make for itself because it possesses irrational,\nnon-universal form. The state, not the people, is the judge of when a\nlaw is rational (8:297). People who argue for a right to revolution,\nKant claims, misunderstand the nature of a social contract. They claim\nthat the social contract must have been an actual historical\noccurrence from which the people could withdraw (8:301\u201302). But\nsince the social contact is only an idea of reason which sets moral\nlimits to the sovereign\u2019s legislative acts, and the\nsovereign\u2019s judgment alone determines how these limits are to be\ninterpreted, there is no independent contractual agreement to which\nthe people could refer in its complaints. Citizens are still allowed\nto voice their grievances through their use of public reason, but they\ncan do nothing more than attempt to persuade the sovereign to adopt or\nrepeal decisions.\n\nWhile the people cannot rebel against the state, Kant does not insist\nthat citizens always obey the state. He allows at least for passive\ncivil disobedience. This comes in two forms: in a republican\nrepresentative system such as England\u2019s, there can be \u201ca\nnegative resistance, that is, a refusal of the people (in parliament)\nto accede to every demand the government puts forth as necessary for\nadministering the state\u201d (6:322). In the context of this\ndiscussion it is clear that Kant is referring to the use of the power\nof the legislature to refuse funding, and therefore approval, of\nactions of the executive. He clarifies that the legislature is not\nallowed to dictate any positive action to the executive, its\nlegitimate resistance is only negative. A second form of acceptable\nresistance applies to individuals. Kant mentions that citizens are\nobligated to obey the sovereign \u201cin whatever does not conflict\nwith inner morality\u201d (6:371). He does not elaborate on the term\n\u201cinner morality\u201d.\n\nNor does Kant always reject the actions of revolutionaries. If a\nrevolution is successful, citizens have as much obligation to obey the\nnew regime as they had to obey the old one (6:323). Since the new\nregime is in fact a state authority, it now possesses the right to\nrule. Further, in his theory of history, Kant argues that progress in\nthe long run will come about in part through violent and unjust\nactions such as wars. Kant even takes it as a sign of progress that\nspectators of the French Revolution had greeted it with \u201ca\nwishful participation that borders closely on enthusiasm\u201d\n(7:85). Kant is not pointing to the revolution itself as a sign of\nprogress but to the reaction of people such as himself to news of the\nrevolution. The spectators endorse the revolution not because it is\nlegitimate but because it is aimed at the creation of a civil\nconstitution. Revolution, then, is wrong but still contributes to\nprogress.\n\nIn fact, Kant did believe that the French Revolution was legitimate,\nat least in its earliest stages, and a look at his argument\nilluminates some of his complex terminology. The French king possessed\nsovereignty until he convened the Estates General as representative of\nthe people, at which time sovereignty \u201cpassed to the\npeople\u201d even though the king had intended for the assembly to\nresolve specific problems and then return the reins of power to him\n(6:341\u20132). Further, the king could not have any power to\nrestrain the actions of the assembly as a condition for it being given\nthe sovereign power, for there can be no restrictions on this\nsovereign power. This understanding of sovereignty shows the\ndifference between a rebellion against authority and peaceful transfer\nof sovereign power such as an election. In an election, sovereignty is\npassed back to the people, so there is nothing wrong with the people\nreplacing the entire government. Without an election (or similar\nmethod of designating the return of sovereignty to the people), any\naction aimed at replacing the government is wrong.\n7. Punishment\n\nKant was long considered to be an exemplar of the retributivist theory\nof punishment. While he does claim that the only proper justification\nof punishment is guilt for a crime, he does not limit the usefulness\nof punishment to retributivist matters. Punishment can have as its\njustification only the guilt of the criminal. All other uses of\npunishment, such as rehabilitation (the alleged good of the criminal)\nor deterrence (alleged good to society) uses the criminal merely as a\nmeans (6:331). Once this guilt is determined, however, Kant does not\ndeny that something useful can be drawn from the punishment. In the\nFeyerabend lectures on Natural Right, Kant is clear that the sovereign\n\u201cmust punish in order to obtain security\u201d, and even while\nusing the law of retribution, \u201cin such a way the best security\nis obtained\u201d (27:1390\u201391). The state is authorized to use\nits coercive force to defend freedom against limitations to freedom;\nmore particularly, since right does not entail that citizens must\nlimit their own freedom but only that \u201cfreedom is limited\u201d\nby conditions of right, it is right for another, i.e. the state, to\nactively limit citizens\u2019 freedom in accord with right (6:231).\nThe state is authorized to use force to defend property rights\n(6:256). Kant\u2019s view, then, is that punishment of a particular\nindividual may serve deterrent functions even when the punishment may\nnot be based solely on deterrence as its justification.\n\nRetributivist theory holds not only that criminal guilt is required\nfor punishment, but that the appropriate type and amount of punishment\nis also determined by the crime itself. Traditionally this is the\nheart of the ancient injunction \u201can eye for an eye\u201d. Kant\nsupports this measurement for punishment because all other\nmeasurements bring into consideration elements besides strict justice\n(6:332), such as the psychological states of others that would measure\nthe effectiveness of various possible punishments on deterrence. As a\nprinciple, retribution grounds but does not specify the exact\npunishment. Kant recognizes that \u201clike for like\u201d is not\nalways possible to the letter, but believes that justice requires that\nit be used as the principle for specific judgments of punishment.\n\nThe retributivist theory of punishment leads to Kant\u2019s\ninsistence on capital punishment. He argues that the only punishment\npossibly equivalent to death, the amount of inflicted harm, is death.\nDeath is qualitatively different from any kind of life, so no\nsubstitute could be found that would equal death. Kant rejects the\nargument against capital punishment offered earlier in his century by\nthe Italian reformer, the Marchese Cesare Beccaria, who argued that in\na social contract no one would willingly give to the state power over\none\u2019s own life, for the preservation of that life is the\nfundamental reason one enters a social contract at all. Kant objects\nto Beccaria\u2019s claim by distinguishing between the source of a\nsocial contract in \u201cpure reason in me\u201d as opposed to the\nsource of the crime, myself as capable of criminal acts. The latter\nperson wills the crime but not the punishments, but the former person\nwills in the abstract that anyone who is convicted of a capital crime\nwill be punished by death. Hence one and the same individual both\ncommits the crime and endorses the punishment of death. This solution\nmirrors the claim that individuals can be coerced to join a civil\ncondition: reason dictates that entering the civil condition is\nmandatory even if one\u2019s particular arbitrary choice might be to\nremain outside it (see section 3).\n8. International Relations and History\n\nIn the \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d Kant complains that the German\nword used to describe international right,\n\u201cV\u00f6lkerrecht\u201d, is misleading, for it means literally\nthe right of nations or peoples. He suggests that it would better be\ncalled \u201cStaatenrecht\u201d, the right of states. Nonetheless\nKant still uses the phrase \u201cright of nations\u201d and also\ndiscusses a \u201cleague of nations\u201d, although it is clear that\nhe is referring not to nations as peoples but to states as\norganizations. Kant is also inconsistent in his use of other terms,\nsuch as \u201cfederation\u201d. For the sake of clarity, this entry\nwill maintain consistent terminology for the discussion of concepts\nin international right, even where that requires departures from\nKant\u2019s own usage.\n\nGiven the lack of international institutions, Kant says, states must\nbe considered to be in a state of nature relative to one another. Like\nindividuals in the state of nature, then, they must be considered to\nbe in a state of war with each other. Like individuals, the states are\nobligated to leave this state of nature to form some type of union\nunder a social contract. Before the creation of some such union (see\nnext paragraph), states do have a right to go to war against other\nstates if another state threatens it or actively aggresses against it\n(6:346). But any declaration of war ought to be confirmed by the\npeople \u201cas colegislating members of a state\u201d (6:345).\nRulers who wage war without such consent are using their subjects as\nproperty, as mere means, rather than treating them as ends in\nthemselves. This claim is one of Kant\u2019s strongest statements\nthat actual voting by citizens is required: citizens \u201cmust\ntherefore give their free assent, through their representatives, not\nonly to waging war in general but also to each particular declaration\nof war\u201d (6:345\u201346). Once war has been declared, states are\nobligated to conduct the war under principles that leave open the\npossibility of an eventual league of states. Actions that undermine\nfuture trust between states, such as the use of assassination, are\nprohibited.\n\nStates are obligated to leave this state of nature among states and\nenter into a union of states. He considers several models of this\nworldwide political institution. The first is a single universal state\nin which the entirety of humanity is ruled directly by the single\nstate or is subject to a single monarch. He rejects this model for\nfailing to fulfill the function of the international institution by in\neffect dissolving the separateness of states rather than providing a\nmeans for peaceful relations among states. The second model is a\nleague of states in which states voluntarily submit themselves to an\norganization for resolving international disputes. The league would\nnot have coercive power to enforce its decisions, and states would be\nfree to leave the league if they chose. He sometimes refers to this\nmodel as a \u201cfederation\u201d, although he notes that it cannot\nbe an indissoluble union based upon a constitution, as in the\nfederalist structure of the United States (6:351), so it is best to\nrefer to this model as a \u201cleague\u201d. The third model is a\nstate of states or a world republic of states in which each state\njoins a federation of states with coercive power. In this model, a\nstate\u2019s relation to the international federation is closely\nanalogous to an individual person\u2019s relation to a state. Only\nthese second and third models receive Kant\u2019s approval. He offers\ndifferent reasons for supporting each of the two models.\n\nKant holds out the third model as the ideal form for the correct\ninternational institution. He calls the world republic an\n\u201cidea\u201d (8:357), a term that Kant uses for concepts created\nby the faculty of reason that cannot be met in experience but that can\nserve as models or goals for actual human behavior (the social\ncontract is another idea of reason in political philosophy). The ideal\ninternational union is a federation of states that has coercive power\nover member states but whose decisions arise from debate and\ndiscussion among those member states. Kant is unclear regarding\nwhether that coercive force is to be realized by joint action of\nmember states, sanctioned by the federation, against a non-compliant\nmember or by a distinct international force controlled by the\nfederation itself. The precise status of states\u2019 membership is\nalso not clearly stated: he generally says that states have a right to\nwithdraw from the federation, although he often states that the\nfederation is indissoluble and even indicates in the \u201cDoctrine\nof Right\u201d that states may go to war to \u201cestablish a\ncondition more closely approaching a rightful condition\u201d\n(6:344), implying that states can be coerced into membership. Kant\nrecognizes that actual states will balk at this international\nfederation since rulers will object to such a surrender of their\nsovereign power. Kant thus argues that the second model, a league of\nstates in which each state opts to negotiate with other nations\ninstead of waging war, must be adopted as a \u201cnegative\nsurrogate\u201d (8:357). In a league of states, individual nations\nare allowed to leave at will and the league itself has no coercive\npowers over members. States voluntarily agree to settle disputes in a\nway that avoids war and encourages further peaceful relations. Leagues\nof states need not extend worldwide but should expand over time in\norder to approximate a worldwide union of all states.\n\nIn the essay \u201cToward Perpetual Peace\u201d, Kant offers a set\nof six \u201cpreliminary articles\u201d which aim to reduce the\nlikelihood of war, but cannot by themselves establish permanent peace\n(8:343\u201347). These are a ban on making temporary peace treaties\nwhile still planning for future wars, the prohibition of annexation of\none state by another, the abolition of standing armies, the refusal to\ntake on national debts for external affairs, a ban on interference by\none state in the internal affairs of another, and a set of limits on\nthe conduct of war that disallows acts that would breed mistrust and\nmake peace impossible. These six articles are negative laws that\nprohibit states from engaging in certain kinds of conduct. They are\nnot sufficient by themselves to prevent states from lapsing back into\ntheir old habits of warring on one another. To institute an\ninternational order that can genuinely bring about perpetual peace,\nKant offers three \u201cdefinitive articles\u201d. The first of\nthese is that every state shall have a republican civil constitution\n(8:348, discussed in section 4 above). In a republican constitution,\nthe people who decide whether there will be a war are the same people\nwho would pay the price for the war, both in monetary terms (taxes and\nother financial burdens) and in flesh and blood. Republican states\nwill therefore be very hesitant to go to war and will readily accept\nnegotiations rather than resort to war. This consideration is\nKant\u2019s most important contribution to the debate about securing\npeace. He believes that when states are ruled in accordance with the\nwishes of the people, their self-interest will provide a consistent\nbasis for pacific relations among states. The second definitive\narticle is that each state shall participate in a union of states\n(8:354, discussed in the previous paragraph). The third definitive\narticle advocates a cosmopolitan right of universal hospitality\n(8:357, discussed in section 9 below).\n\nKant\u2019s view of historical progress is tied to his view of\ninternational relations. He actually presents several versions of his\nargument for the progress of humanity toward the ideal condition in\nwhich states, each governed by a republican civil constitution and\nthus each providing maximal consistent freedom for its citizens, all\ncooperate in a republican federation of states. In his essay\n\u201cIdea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of\nView\u201d (8:15\u201331), he takes the basis of his claims for\nhistorical progress to be the culmination of the human ability to\nreason, which, as a natural property of human beings, must be worked\nout to perfection in the species. He argues that incessant wars will\neventually lead rulers to recognize the benefits of peaceful\nnegotiation. They will gradually increase the freedoms of their\ncitizens, because freer citizens are economically more productive and\nhence make the state stronger in its international dealings.\nImportantly in this essay he relies on the self-interest of presumably\nunelected rulers as a significant force in the movement toward\ninternational peace. In \u201cToward Perpetual Peace\u201d Kant\nsuggests that some particular state may, through \u201cgood\nfortune\u201d, become a republic and then act as a focal point for\nother states to join in peaceful relations, and that gradually such\ncooperation can spread to all states (8:356). These positions\ncertainly reveal that Kant considered world peace impossible without\nboth individual republican states and an international federation\namong them.\n9. Cosmopolitan Right\n\nRelations among the states of the world, covered above, are not\nexhaustive of possible political relations outside one domestic state.\nIndividuals can relate to states of which they are not members and to\nother individuals who are members of other states. In this they are\nconsidered \u201ccitizens of a universal state of human beings\u201d\nwith corresponding \u201crights of citizens of the world\u201d\n(8:349, footnote). The rights individuals have as citizens of the\nworld form the basis of cosmopolitan right. Based on these lofty\nsounding pronouncements, some writers inspired by Kant discuss\ncosmopolitan right as if it were equivalent to general human rights\nand as if it formed the foundation for worldwide progress. But general\nhuman rights in Kant would have to be found in the innate right to\nfreedom, not specifically in cosmopolitan right, and progress toward\npeace is driven more by republicanism and the behavior of states as\ndiscussed in the previous section. Kant\u2019s particular discussion\nof cosmopolitan right is restricted to the right of hospitality. Since\nall peoples share a limited amount of living space due to the\nspherical shape of the earth, the totality of which they must be\nunderstood to have originally shared in common, they must be\nunderstood to have a right to possible interaction with one another.\nThis cosmopolitan right is limited to a right to offer to engage in\ncommerce, not a right to actual commerce itself, which must always be\nvoluntary trade. A citizen of one state may try to establish links\nwith other peoples; no state is allowed to deny foreign citizens a\nright to travel in its land. And in an emergency such as a shipwreck,\nstates must provide non-citizens with temporary shelter; this\nprovision is sometimes understood as a basis for a state duty to\naccept refugees.\n\nColonial rule and settlement is another matter entirely. In his\npublished writings in the 1790s, Kant is strongly critical of the\nEuropean colonization of other lands already inhabited by other\npeoples. Settlement in these cases is allowed only by uncoerced\ninformed contract. Even land that appears empty might be used by\nshepherds or hunters and cannot be appropriated without their consent\n(6:354). These positions represent a change in Kant\u2019s thought,\nfor he had previously indicated acceptance if not endorsement of the\nEuropean colonial practices of his time and the racial hierarchy\nbehind them. Kant himself produced a theory of human racial\nclassifications and origins and thought that non-Europeans were\ninferior in various ways. Kant thought that the course of world\nprogress involved the spread of European culture and law throughout\nthe world to what he considered to be less advanced cultures and\ninferior races. By the mid-1790s, however, Kant appears to have given\nup beliefs about racial inferiority and no longer discusses it in his\nlectures. He publicly criticized European colonial practices as\nviolations of the rights of indigenous peoples who are capable of\ngoverning themselves (8:358\u201360).\n\nCosmopolitan right is an important component of perpetual peace.\nInteraction among the peoples of the world, Kant notes, has increased\nin recent times. Now \u201ca violation of right on one place of the\nearth is felt in all\u201d as peoples depend upon one another and\nknow about one another more and more (8:360). Violations of\ncosmopolitan right would make more difficult the trust and cooperation\nnecessary for perpetual peace among states. And for Kant, perpetual\npeace is the \u201chighest political good\u201d (6:355).\n10. Social Philosophy\n\n\u201cSocial philosophy,\u201d can be taken to mean the relationship\nof persons to institutions, and to each other via these institutions,\nthat are not part of the state. Family is a clear example of a social\ninstitution that transcends the individual but has at least some\nelements that are not controlled by the state. Other examples would be\neconomic institutions such as businesses and markets, religious\ninstitutions, social clubs and private associations created to advance\ninterests or for mere enjoyment, educational and university\ninstitutions, and social systems and classifications such as race and\ngender. It is worth noting a few particulars, if only as examples of\nthe range of this topic. Kant favored right-governed free markets that\nallowed people to choose and pursue their ends, but advocated the duty\nof citizens to support those in society who could not support\nthemselves, and even gave the state the power to arrange for this help\n(6:326). He offered a biological explanation of race in several essays\nand also, certainly into his \u201cCritical\u201d period, held that\nother races were inferior to Europeans, although he did late in his\ncareer insist that non-European peoples possessed full political\nrights. He supported a reform movement in education based on the\nprinciples presented by Rousseau in \u201cEmile\u201d. I will not\nprovide detailed treatment of Kant\u2019s views on these particular\nmatters (some of which are scant) but only focus on the nature of\nsocial philosophy for Kant.\n\nKant had no comprehensive social philosophy. One might be tempted to\nclaim that, in line with natural law theorists, Kant discusses natural\nrights related to some social institutions. One might read the first\nhalf of the \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d as a social philosophy,\nsince this half on \u201cPrivate Right\u201d discusses the rights of\nindividuals relative to one another, in contrast to the second half on\n\u201cPublic Right\u201d that discusses the rights of individuals\nrelative to the state. Kant even offers an explanation of this\ndifference by claiming that the opposite of state of nature is not a\nsocial but the civil condition, that is, a state (6:306). The state of\nnature can include voluntary societies (Kant mentions domestic\nrelations in general) where there is no a priori obligation for\nindividuals to enter them. This approach to Kant, however, is subject\nto some doubt, since he explicitly links all forms of property to the\nobligation to enter the civil condition (see section 5 above), and his\ndiscussion of marriage and family comes in the form of property\nrelations akin to contract relations. It is thus not obvious how\nKant\u2019s explanations of these social institutions, which presuppose\nproperty relations, could apply to social philosophy independent of\nthe state. Thus even if some form of family or household or\nproperty-like institutions could exist outside the civil condition,\nKant does not discuss them.\n\nAnother approach to the issue of social philosophy in Kant is to view\nit in terms of moral philosophy properly speaking, that is, the\nobligations human beings have to act under the proper maxims, as\ndiscussed in the \u201cDoctrine of Virtue\u201d (see section 1\nabove). In the \u201cDoctrine of Virtue\u201d Kant talks about the\nobligation to develop friendships and to participate in social\nintercourse (6:469\u201374). In the Religion within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason Kant discusses the development of an\n\u201cethical commonwealth\u201d in which human beings strengthen\none another\u2019s moral resolve through their participation in the\nmoral community of a church. He also holds that educational\ninstitutions, the subject of his book On Pedagogy, should be\ndesigned to provide for the development of morality in human beings,\nwho lack a natural disposition for the moral good. In these cases\nKant\u2019s social philosophy is treated as an arm of his theory of\nvirtue, not as a freestanding topic in its own right.\n\nA third approach to social philosophy comes through Kant\u2019s\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. Kant had\nenvisioned anthropology as an empirical application of ethics, akin to\nempirical physics as a application of pure metaphysical principles of\nnature. Knowledge of the general characteristics of human being as\nwell as particular characteristics of genders, races, nationalities,\netc, can aid in determining one\u2019s precise duties toward\nparticular individuals. Further, this knowledge can aid moral agents\nin their own task of motivating themselves to morality. These promises\nof anthropology in its practical application are unfulfilled, however,\nin the details of Kant\u2019s text. He does little critical\nassessment of social prejudices or practices to screen out stereotypes\ndetrimental to moral development. His own personal views, considered\nsexist and racist universally today and even out of step with some of\nhis more progressive colleagues, pervade his direct discussions of\nthese social institutions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<p>\nKant\u2019s original German and Latin writings are collected in\n<em>Kants Gesammelte Schriften</em>, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1900\u2013.\nMost translations provide the pagination to this edition in the\nmargins, often using volume and page number.
