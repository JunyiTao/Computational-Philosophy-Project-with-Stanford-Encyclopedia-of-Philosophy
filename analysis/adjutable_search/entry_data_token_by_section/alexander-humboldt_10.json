Like the landscape painter, the\nphysiognomist is interested in the overall impression that a landscape\nmakes\u2014in those aspects, which give the landscape its unique\ncharacter. Furthermore, in contrast to a botanist, who aims to\ncategorize, distinguish, and separate plants, the physiognomist, like\nthe landscape painter, binds them together. This means that the\nphysiognomist\u2019s aims is not to focus on separating trees or\ndistinguishing species, but rather seeing trees in relation to one\nanother, seeing them as members of a forest, and seeing\nthe forest in them.\n\nTo give his audience a concrete sense of what he means, Humboldt\nconsiders the diverging ways that a painter and a botanist treat leafy\nhardwoods. While the botanist distinguishes different hardwoods (oak,\nbeech, walnut), the landscape painter allows them, as Humboldt puts\nit, \u201cto run one into the other\u201d, portraying them as\nmembers of a forest (DA 5: 184; VN: 162). This is because the painter\nis interested in capturing the overall impression that hardwoods make\non the viewer\u2014an impression that is connected to the fact that\ndifferent hardwoods grow in relation to one another and together form\na distinctive forest.\n\nJust as a willow on the mountainside looks different to a willow by\nthe river, so also an oak (a hardwood) growing in a forest of\nhardwoods looks different from a solitary oak on a hill. The crown of\na solitary oak spreads out in all directions, eventually achieving a\ndome shape. By contrast, the forest oak develops a small crown, and\nits growth is patterned on the growth of the other trees in the\nforest. An oak in a hardwood forest is an expression not only of the\nindividual tree or the genus oak, but also of the forest itself. The\nforest is not \u201coutside\u201d the individual oak tree, but\nliterally inscribed in it its very form.\n\nThe same, Humboldt maintains, holds for the forest. The kind\nof forest it is\u2014whether it is cool and humid, or temperate and\ndry, whether its soil is nutrient rich or poor, and how much rain it\nreceives\u2014depends on its particular trees. The forest\nenvironment, in other words, is realized in and maintained through the\nactivities of its trees. The forest is an expression of its trees as\nmuch as the trees are an expression of the forest.\n\nBy working with form, expression, and gesture, the landscape painter\ncaptures this relationship, and thereby presents trees and forest,\norganism and environment, as interdependent realities\u2014as beings\nthat emerge with and through one another. Thus, by invoking the\nlandscape painter, Humboldt\u2019s goal was to introduce a new\napproach to the study of nature\u2014one that regards nature as an\nongoing and dynamic collaboration between beings that are internally\ndependent on one another.\n\nIt was this ecological insight, and this way of observing nature, that\nunderpinned Humboldt\u2019s research at Lake Valencia. For what he\nsaw there was that the climate cannot exist without the trees, and the\ntrees cannot exist without this climate. This means that the one does\nnot pre-exist the other, because both\u2014tree and\nclimate\u2014mutually influence and determine one another.\n",
