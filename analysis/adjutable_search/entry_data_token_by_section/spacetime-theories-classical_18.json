According to this reading, Newton\u2019s point is that\nhis mechanics \u2013 unlike Descartes\u2019 [special\ncharacter:mdash] could explain why the surface of the\nrotating water is curved, that his explanation involves a privileged\nsense of rotation, and that absent an alternative hypothesis about its\nrelative nature, we should accept absolute space. But our discussion\nof Newton\u2019s argument showed that it simply does not have an\n\u2018abductive[special character:rsquo], \u2018best\nexplanation\u2019 form, but shows deductively, from Cartesian\npremises, that rotation is neither proper nor ordinary motion.\n\nThat is not to say that Newton had no understanding of how such\neffects would be explained in his mechanics. For instance, in\nCorollaries V and VI to the Definitions of the Principles he\nstates in general terms the conditions under which different states of\nmotion are not \u2013 and so by implication are \u2013\ndiscernible according to his laws of mechanics. Nor is it to say that\nNewton\u2019s contemporaries weren\u2019t seriously concerned with\nexplaining inertial effects. Leibniz, for instance, analyzed a\nrotating body (in the Specimen). In short, parts of a\nrotating system collide with the surrounding matter and are\ncontinuously deflected, into a series of linear motions that form a\ncurved path. (Though the system as Leibniz envisions it \u2013\ncomprised of a plenum of elastic particles of matter \u2013 is far\ntoo complex for him to offer any quantitative model based on this\nqualitative picture. So he had no serious alternative explanation of\ninertial effects.)\n",
