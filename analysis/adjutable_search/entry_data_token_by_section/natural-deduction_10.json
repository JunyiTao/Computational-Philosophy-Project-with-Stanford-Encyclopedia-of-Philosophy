    "main_text": "Normalization || Proofs of Normalization\n5.2 Proofs of Normalization\n\nIt is clear from Gentzen (1934) that he was aware of the normalization\ntheorem, but he did not publish a proof, or even a precise\nformulation, of it. The reason would seem to be that he despaired of\nproving an analogous result for the system of natural deduction for\nclassical logic, and so developed his sequent calculus systems. For\nthese he was able to prove a result for both the classical\nand intuitionistic variants (his Hauptsatz) which is\nanalogous to the normalization theorem, and useful for some of the\nsame applications. A proof of the normalization theorem was finally\npublished by Prawitz (1965), but it turns out that Gentzen himself had\nwritten out a detailed proof in 1933, which is very similar to that\ngiven by Prawitz. Jan von Plato discovered Gentzen\u2019s manuscript\nand published it (von Plato 2008). (Gentzen\u2019s presentation of\nthe proof is very clear, and evidences a strong visual imagination: it\nis a pleasure to read.)\n",
