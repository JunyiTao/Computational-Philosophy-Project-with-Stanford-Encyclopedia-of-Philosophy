    "main_text": "\n\n\nIsaac Newton (1642\u20131727) is best known for having invented the\ncalculus in the mid to late 1660s (most of a decade before Leibniz did\nso independently, and ultimately more influentially) and for having\nformulated the theory of universal gravity \u2014 the latter in his\nPrincipia, the single most important work in the\ntransformation of early modern natural philosophy into modern physical\nscience. Yet he also made major discoveries in optics beginning in the\nmid-1660s and reaching across four decades; and during the course of\nhis 60 years of intense intellectual activity he put no less effort\ninto chemical and alchemical research and into theology and biblical\nstudies than he put into mathematics and physics. He became a dominant\nfigure in Britain almost immediately following publication of his\nPrincipia in 1687, with the consequence that\n\u201cNewtonianism\u201d of one form or another had become firmly\nrooted there within the first decade of the eighteenth century. His\ninfluence on the continent, however, was delayed by the strong\nopposition to his theory of gravity expressed by such leading figures\nas Christiaan Huygens and Leibniz, both of whom saw the theory as\ninvoking an occult power of action at a distance in the absence of\nNewton's having proposed a contact mechanism by means of which forces\nof gravity could act. As the promise of the theory of gravity became\nincreasingly substantiated, starting in the late 1730s but especially\nduring the 1740s and 1750s, Newton became an equally dominant figure\non the continent, and \u201cNewtonianism,\u201d though perhaps in\nmore guarded forms, flourished there as well. What physics textbooks\nnow refer to as \u201cNewtonian mechanics\u201d and \u201cNewtonian\nscience\u201d consists mostly of results achieved on the continent\nbetween 1740 and 1800.\n",
