An essential difference with earlier efforts\n(discussed below and elsewhere, e.g. in Zach 1999), is that G\u00f6del\ndefines meticulously all the relevant basic concepts.\n\nA \u201clogical expression\u201d in G\u00f6del\u2019s terminology\nis a well-formed first order formula without identity. An expression\nis \u201crefutable\u201d if its negation is provable,\n\u201cvalid\u201d if it is true in every interpretation and\n\u201csatisfiable\u201d if it is true in some interpretation. The\nCompleteness Theorem is stated as follows:\n\nTheorem 1.\n\nEvery valid logical expression is provable. Equivalently, every\nlogical expression is either satisfiable or refutable.\n\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof calculus is that of Hilbert and\nAckermann\u2019s text. An expression is in normal form if all the\nquantifiers occur at the beginning. The degree of an expression or\nformula is the number of alternating blocks of quantifiers at the\nbeginning of the formula, assumed to begin with universal quantifiers.\nG\u00f6del shows that if the completeness theorem holds for formulas\nof degree k it must hold for formulas of degree k +\n1. Thus the question of completeness reduces to formulas of degree 1.\nThat is, it is to be shown that any normal formula (Q)\u03c6\nof degree 1 is either satisfiable or refutable, where\n\u201c(Q)\u201d stands for a (non-empty) block of universal\nquantifiers followed by a (possibly empty) block of existential\nones.\n\nG\u00f6del defines a book-keeping device, a well-ordering of all\ntuples of variables arising from a need to satisfy \u03c6 as dictated\nby (Q). For example, if (Q)\u03c6 is\n\u2200x0\u2203x1\u03c8(x0,\nx1), we list the quantifier-free formulas\n\u03c8(xn,\nxn+1). (Or more precisely, finite\nconjunctions of these in increasing length. See below.) Then in any\ndomain consisting of the values of the different\nxn, in which each\n\u03c8(xn, xn+1) is\ntrue, the sentence (Q)\u03c6 is clearly true. A crucial lemma\nclaims the provability, for each k, of the formula\n(Q)\u03c6 \u2192\n(Qk)\u03c6k, where the\nquantifier free formula \u03c6k asserts the truth\nof \u03c8 for all tuples up to the kth tuple of variables arising from\n(Q), and\n(Qk)\u03c6k is the\nexistential closure of \u03c6k. (See the example\nbelow where the definition of the \u03c6k\u2032s\nis given.) This lemma is the main step missing from the various\nearlier attempts at the proof due to L\u00f6wenheim and Skolem, and,\nin the context of the completeness theorem for first order logic,\nrenders the connection between syntax and semantics completely\nexplicit.\n\nLet us consider an example of how a particular formula would be found\nto be either satisfiable or its negation provable, following\nG\u00f6del\u2019s method: Consider \u03c6 =\n\u2200x0\u2203x1\u03c8(x0,\nx1), where \u03c8(x0,\nx1) is quantifier-free. We show that this is\neither refutable or satisfiable. We make the following\ndefinitions:\n\n\n\n\n\u03c60 is the expression\n\u03c8(x0, x1) \n\n\u03c61 is the expression\n\u03c8(x0, x1) \u2227\n\u03c8(x1, x2) \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u03c6n is the expression\n\u03c8(x0, x1) \u2227\n\u2026\u2227 \u03c8(xn,\nxn+1).  \n\n\n\nThe crucial lemma, referred to above, shows that from \u03c6 we can\nderive for each n,\n\u2203x0\u2026\u2203xn+1\u03c6n.\n\n\nCase 1: For some n,\n\u03c6n is not satisfiable. Then, G\u00f6del\nargued, using the already known completeness theorem for propositional\n logic,[7]\n that \u00ac\u03c6n is provable, and hence so is\n\u2200x0,\u2026,\nxn+1\u00ac\u03c6n. Thus\n\u00ac\u2203x0\u2026\u2203xn+1\u03c6n\nis provable and therefore the \u00ac\u03c6 is provable, i.e., \u03c6 is\nrefutable in the Hilbert-Ackermann system. (Some partial results about\npropositional logic in addition to those already mentioned include the\nsemantic completeness of the propositional calculus due to Post\n(1921), as well as a more general completeness theorem for the same\ndue to Bernays in 1918; the latter appears in Bernays\u2019\nunpublished Habilitationsschrift of 1918; see also Bernays\n1926.)\n\nCase 2: Each \u03c6n is\nsatisfiable. There are only finitely many possible models with\nuniverse {x0,\u2026, xn+1}.\nG\u00f6del orders them as a tree by defining a model M to be\nbelow a model M\u2032 if M is a submodel of\nM\u2032. In this way we obtain a tree which is finitely\nbranching but infinite. By K\u00f6nig\u2019s Lemma there is an\ninfinite branch B. (In the proof, G\u00f6del explicitly\nconstructs the branch given by K\u00f6nig\u2019s Lemma rather than\nciting it by name.) The union of the models on B forms a\nmodel M with universe {x0,\nx1,\u2026}. Since M satisfies each\n\u03c6n, the original formula \u03c6 holds in\nM. So \u03c6 is satisfiable and we are done.\n\n\nNote that the model, in the satisfiability case of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nproof, is always countable. Thus this proof of the Completeness\nTheorem gives also the L\u00f6weheim-Skolem Theorem (see below).\nG\u00f6del extends the result to countably many formulas and to the\ncase of first order logic with identity. He also proves the\nindependence of the axioms.\n\nIn 1930 G\u00f6del published the paper based on his thesis (G\u00f6del\n1930) notable also for the inclusion of the compactness theorem, which\nis only implicitly stated in the thesis. The theorem as stated by\nG\u00f6del in G\u00f6del 1930 is as follows: a countably infinite set\nof quantificational formulas is satisfiable if and only if every\nfinite subset of those formulas is satisfiable. G\u00f6del uses\ncompactness to derive a generalization of the completeness\ntheorem.\n\nThe Compactness Theorem was extended to the case of uncountable\nvocabularies by Maltsev in 1936 (see Mal\u2019cev 1971), from which\nthe Upward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem immediately follows. The\nCompactness Theorem would become one of the main tools in the then\nfledgling subject of model theory.\n2.1.3 An Important Consequence of the Completeness Theorem\n\nA theory is said to be categorical if it has only one model up to\nisomorphism; it is \u03bb-categorical if it has only one model of\ncardinality \u03bb, up to isomorphism. One of the main consequences\nof the completeness theorem is that categoricity fails for Peano\narithmetic and for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\n\nIn detail, regarding the first order Peano axioms (henceforth\nPA), the existence of non-standard models of them actually\nfollows from completeness together with compactness. One constructs\nthese models, which contain infinitely large integers, as follows: add\na new constant symbol c to the language of arithmetic. Extend\nPA to a new theory PA* by adding to it the infinite\ncollection of axioms: {c > 0, c >\n1, \u2026}, where, e.g., 3 is S(S(S(0))). PA*\nis finitely consistent (i.e., every finite subset of PA* is\nconsistent) hence consistent, hence by the Completeness Theorem it has\na model.\n\nThis simple fact about models of Peano arithmetic was not pointed out\nby G\u00f6del in any of the publications connected with the\nCompleteness Theorem from that time, and it seems not to have been\nnoticed by the general logic community until much later.\nSkolem\u2019s definable ultrapower construction from 1933 (see Skolem\n1933) gives a direct construction of a non-standard model of True\nArithmetic (which extends Peano arithmetic, being the set of\narithmetic sentences true in the natural numbers). But Skolem never\nmentions the fact that the existence of such models follows from the\ncompleteness and compactness theorems. G\u00f6del in his review\n(1934c) of Skolem\u2019s paper also does not mention this fact,\nrather observing that the failure of categoricity for arithmetic\nfollows from the incompleteness theorem.\n\nAs for set theory, the failure of categoricity was already taken note\nof by Skolem in 1923, because it follows from the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem (which Skolem arrived at that year; see\nSkolem 1923, based on L\u00f6wenheim 1915 and Skolem 1920): any first\norder theory in a countable language that has a model has a countable\nmodel.\n\nSkolem\u2019s observation that categoricity fails for set theory\nbecause it has countable models is now known as the Skolem\n paradox.[8]The\n observation is strongly emphasized in Skolem\u2019s paper, which is\naccordingly entitled \u2018An Observation on the Axiomatic\nFoundations of Set Theory\u2019 As he wrote in the conclusion of it,\nhe had not pointed out the relativity in set theory already in 1915\nbecause:\n\n\n\u2026 first, I have in the meantime been occupied with other\nproblems; second, I believed that it was so clear that axiomatization\nin terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of\nmathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very\nmuch concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise\nthat so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory\nprovide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it seemed to\nme that the time had come to publish a critique. (English translation\ntaken from van Heijenoort 1967, p. 300.)\n\n\nAs an aside, in the proof of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem,\nspecifically that part of the theorem in which one constructs a model\nfor a satisfiable sentence, L\u00f6wenheim and Skolem\u2019s tree\nconstruction was more or less the same as appears in\nG\u00f6del\u2019s thesis. In a 1967 letter to Hao Wang, G\u00f6del\ntakes note of the fact that his completeness proof had almost been\nobtained by Skolem in 1923. Though van Heijenoort and Dreben (Dreben\nand van Heijenoort 1986) remark that \u201cThroughout much of the\n1920s it was not semantic completeness but the decision problem for\nquantificational validity, a problem originating from the work of\nSchr\u00f6der and L\u00f6wenheim, that was the dominant concern in\nstudying quantification theory\u201d (examples of such results would\ninclude the decision procedure for the first order monadic predicate\ncalculus due to Behmann, (Behmann 1922)), according to G\u00f6del, the\nreasons that Skolem did not obtain the complete proof are different\nand philosophically important, having to do with the then dominant\nbias against semantics and against infinitary methods:\n\nThe Completeness Theorem, mathematically, is indeed an almost trivial\nconsequence of Skolem 1923. However, the fact is that, at that time,\nnobody (including Skolem himself) drew this conclusion neither from\nSkolem 1923 nor, as I did, from similar considerations of his own\n\u2026This blindness (or prejudice, or whatever you may call it) of\nlogicians is indeed surprising. But I think the explanation is not\nhard to find. It lies in the widespread lack, at that time, of the\nrequired epistemological attitude toward metamathematics and toward\nnon-finitary reasoning. (G\u00f6del 2003b).\n\n\nThe matter of Skolem\u2019s contribution to the Completeness Theorem\nhas been extensively discussed in van Atten and Kennedy 2009, as well\nas in van Atten 2005.\n2.2 The Incompleteness Theorems\n\nG\u00f6del mentioned the possibility of the unsolvability of a\nquestion about the reals already in his 1929 thesis, in arguing\nagainst the formalist principle of Hilbert\u2019s, that consistency\nis a criterion for existence. In fact, giving a finitary proof of the\nconsistency of analysis was a key desideratum of what was then known\nas the Hilbert program, along with proving its completeness.\nAccordingly it was G\u00f6del\u2019s turn to these questions,\nespecially the first, which led him to the two incompleteness\ntheorems. (For a discussion of the Hilbert Program the reader is\nreferred to the standard references: Sieg 1990, 1988, 1999; Mancosu\n1998, Zach 2003, Tait 1981 and Tait 2002.)\n\nThe First Incompleteness Theorem provides a counterexample to\ncompleteness by exhibiting an arithmetic statement which is neither\nprovable nor refutable in Peano arithmetic, though true in the\nstandard model. The Second Incompleteness Theorem shows that the\nconsistency of arithmetic cannot be proved in arithmetic itself. Thus\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems demonstrated the infeasibility of the\nHilbert program, if it is to be characterized by those particular\ndesiderata, consistency and completeness.\n\nAs an aside, von Neumann understood the two theorems this way, even\nbefore G\u00f6del did. In fact von Neumann went much further in taking\nthe view that they showed the infeasibility of classical mathematics\naltogether. As he wrote to Carnap in June of 1931:\n\nThus today I am of the opinion that 1. G\u00f6del has shown the\nunrealizability of Hilbert\u2019s program. 2. There is no more reason\nto reject intuitionism (if one disregards the aesthetic issue, which\nin practice will also for me be the decisive factor). Therefore I\nconsider the state of the foundational discussion in K\u00f6nigsberg\nto be outdated, for G\u00f6del\u2019s fundamental discoveries have\nbrought the question to a completely different\n level.[9]\n\n\nAnd the previous fall von Neumann had written to G\u00f6del in even\nstronger terms:\n\nThus, I think that your result has solved negatively the foundational\nquestion: there is no rigorous justification for classical\nmathematics. (G\u00f6del 2003b, p. 339)\n\n\nIt would take G\u00f6del himself a few years to see that those aspects\nof the Hilbert Program had been decisively refuted by his results\n(Mancosu 2004).\n2.2.1 The First Incompleteness Theorem\n\nIn his Logical Journey (Wang 1996) Hao Wang published the\nfull text of material G\u00f6del had written (at Wang\u2019s request)\nabout his discovery of the incompleteness theorems. This material had\nformed the basis of Wang\u2019s \u201cSome Facts about Kurt\nG\u00f6del,\u201d and was read and approved by G\u00f6del:\n\nIn the summer of 1930 I began to study the consistency problem of\nclassical analysis. It is mysterious why Hilbert wanted to prove\ndirectly the consistency of analysis by finitary methods. I saw two\ndistinguishable problems: to prove the consistency of number theory by\nfinitary number theory and to prove the consistency of analysis by\nnumber theory \u2026 Since the domain of finitary number theory was\nnot well-defined, I began by tackling the second half\u2026 I\nrepresented real numbers by predicates in number theory\u2026 and\nfound that I had to use the concept of truth (for number theory) to\nverify the axioms of analysis. By an enumeration of symbols, sentences\nand proofs within the given system, I quickly discovered that the\nconcept of arithmetic truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. If it\nwere possible to define truth in the system itself, we would have\nsomething like the liar paradox, showing the system to be\ninconsistent\u2026 Note that this argument can be formalized to show\nthe existence of undecidable propositions without giving any\nindividual instances. (If there were no undecidable propositions, all\n(and only) true propositions would be provable within the system. But\nthen we would have a contradiction.)\u2026 In contrast to truth,\nprovability in a given formal system is an explicit combinatorial\nproperty of certain sentences of the system, which is formally\nspecifiable by suitable elementary means\u2026\n\n\nWe see that G\u00f6del first tried to reduce the consistency problem\nfor analysis to that of arithmetic. This seemed to require a truth\ndefinition for arithmetic, which in turn led to paradoxes, such as the\nLiar paradox (\u201cThis sentence is false\u201d) and Berry\u2019s\nparadox (\u201cThe least number not defined by an expression\nconsisting of just fourteen English words\u201d). G\u00f6del then\nnoticed that such paradoxes would not necessarily arise if truth were\nreplaced by provability. But this means that arithmetic truth and\narithmetic provability are not co-extensive \u2014 whence the First\nIncompleteness Theorem.\n\nThis account of G\u00f6del\u2019s discovery was told to Hao Wang very\nmuch after the fact; but in G\u00f6del\u2019s contemporary\ncorrespondence with Bernays and Zermelo, essentially the same\ndescription of his path to the theorems is given. (See G\u00f6del\n2003a and G\u00f6del 2003b respectively.) From those accounts we see\nthat the undefinability of truth in arithmetic, a result credited to\nTarski, was likely obtained in some form by G\u00f6del by 1931. But he\nneither publicized nor published the result; the biases logicians had\nexpressed at the time concerning the notion of truth, biases which\ncame vehemently to the fore when Tarski announced his results on the\nundefinability of truth in formal systems 1935, may have served as a\ndeterrent to G\u00f6del\u2019s publication of that theorem.\n2.2.2 The proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem\n\nWe now describe the proof of the two theorems, formulating\nG\u00f6del\u2019s results in Peano arithmetic. G\u00f6del himself\nused a system related to that defined in Principia Mathematica, but\ncontaining Peano arithmetic. In our presentation of the First and\nSecond Incompleteness Theorems we refer to Peano arithmetic as\nP, following G\u00f6del\u2019s notation.\n\nBefore proceeding to the details of the formal proof, we define the\nnotion of \u03c9-consistency used by G\u00f6del in the First\nIncompleteness Theorem: P is \u03c9-consistent if\nP \u22a2 \u00ac\u03c6(n) for all n\nimplies P \u22ac \u2203x\u03c6(x).\nNaturally this implies consistency and follows from the assumption\nthat the natural numbers satisfy the axioms of Peano arithmetic.\n\nOne of the main technical tools used in the proof is G\u00f6del\nnumbering, a mechanism which assigns natural numbers to terms and\nformulas of our formal theory P. There are different ways of\ndoing this. The most common is based on the unique representation of\nnatural numbers as products of powers of primes. Each symbol\ns of number theory is assigned a positive natural number\n#(s) in a fixed but arbitrary way, e.g.\n\n\n\n\n#(0) = 1\n#(=) = 5\n#(\u00ac) = 9 \n\n#(1) = 2\n#(\u2009(\u2009) = 6\n#(\u2200) = 10 \n\n#(+) = 3\n#(\u2009)\u2009) = 7\n#(vi) = 11 + i\n\n\n#(\u00d7) = 4\n#(\u2227) = 8\n\u00a0  \n\n\n\nThe natural number corresponding to a sequence w = <\nw0,\u2026, wk >\nof symbols is\n\n\u2308w\u2309 =\n2#(w0) \u00b7\n3#(w1) \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7\npk#(wk),\n\n\nwhere pk is the k+1st prime. It\nis called its G\u00f6del number and denoted by\n\u2308w\u2309. In this way we can\nassign G\u00f6del numbers to formulas, sequences of formulas (once a\nmethod for distinguishing when one formula ends and another begins has\nbeen adopted), and most notably, proofs.\n\nAn essential point here is that when a formula is construed as a\nnatural number, then the numeral corresponding to that natural number\ncan occur as the argument of a formula, thus enabling the syntax to\n\u201crefer\u201d to itself, so to speak (i.e., when a numeral is\nsubstituted into a formula the G\u00f6del number of which the numeral\nrepresents). This will eventually allow G\u00f6del to formalize the\nLiar paradox (with \u201cprovability\u201d in place of\n\u201ctruth\u201d) by substituting into the formula which says,\n\u2018the formula, whose code is x, is unprovable,\u2019\nits own natural number code (or more precisely the corresponding\nnumeral).\n\nAnother concept required to carry out the formalization is the concept\nof numeralwise expressibility of number theoretic predicates. A\nnumber-theoretic formula \u03c6(n1, \u2026,\nnk) is numeralwise expressible in\nP if for each tuple of natural numbers\n(n1, \u2026,\nnk):\n\n\n\n\nN \u22a8\n\u03c6(n1, \u2026,\nnk)\n\u21d2\nP \u22a2\n\u03c6(n1, \u2026,\nnk) \n\nN \u22a8\n\u00ac\u03c6(n1, \u2026,\nnk)\n\u21d2\nP \u22a2\n\u00ac\u03c6(n1, \u2026,\nnk)  \n\n\n\nwhere n is the formal term which denotes the natural\nnumber n. (In P, this is\nS(S(\u2026S(0)\u2026), where n\nis the number of iterations of the successor function applied to the\nconstant symbol 0.) One of the principal goals is to numeralwise\nexpress the predicate\n\nPrf(x, y): \u2018the sequence with G\u00f6del\nnumber x is a proof of the sentence with G\u00f6del number\ny.\u2019\n\n\nReaching this goal involves defining forty-five relations, each\ndefined in terms of the preceding ones. These relations are all\nprimitive\n recursive.[10]\n Relations needed are, among others, those which assert of a natural\nnumber that it codes a sequence, or a formula, or an axiom, or that it\nis the code, denoted by\nSb(ru1\u2026unZ(x1)\u2026Z(xn)),\nof a formula obtained from a formula with code r by\nsubstituting for its free variable ui the\nxi th numeral for i = 1,\n\u2026, n. The forty-fifth primitive recursive relation\ndefined is Prf(x, y), and the forty-sixth is\n\nProv(y): \u2018the sentence with G\u00f6del number\ny is provable in P\u2019\n\n\nwhich without being primitive recursive, is however obtained from\nPrf(x, y) by existentially quantifying x.\n(Prov(y) satisfies only the \u2018positive\u2019 part of\nnumeralwise expressibility, and not the negative part; but the\nnegative part is not needed.)\n\nIn Theorem V of his paper, G\u00f6del proves that any number theoretic\npredicate which is primitive recursive is numeralwise expressible in\nP. Thus since Prf(x, y) and substitution\nare primitive recursive, these are decided by P when closed\nterms are substituted for the free variables x and\ny. This is the heart of the matter as we will see. Another\nkey point about numeralwise expressibility is that although we\ninformally interpret, for example,\nProv(Sb(ru1\u2026unZ(x1)\u2026Z(xn))),\nby: \u2018the formula with G\u00f6del number r is provable\nif the G\u00f6del number for the xi th numeral is\nsubstituted in place of the i th variable,\u2019 neither the\nformal statement within the theory P nor anything we prove\nabout it appeals to such meanings. On the contrary\nProv(Sb(ru1\u2026unZ(x1)\u2026Z(xn))),\nis a meaningless string of logical and arithmetical symbols. As\nG\u00f6del puts it in his introduction to his theorem V, \u2018The\nfact that can be formulated vaguely by saying that every recursive\nrelation is definable in the system P (if the usual meaning\nis given to the formulas of this system) is expressed in precise\nlanguage, without reference to any interpretation of the\nformulas of P, by the following Theorem (V) (G\u00f6del 1986,\np. 171, italics G\u00f6del\u2019s).\n\nG\u00f6del in his incompleteness theorems uses a method given in what\nis called nowadays G\u00f6del\u2019s Fixed Point Theorem. Although\nG\u00f6del constructs a fixed point in the course of proving the\nincompleteness theorem, he does not state the fixed point theorem\nexplicitly. The fixed point theorem is as follows:\n\n\nTheorem 2 (G\u00f6del\u2019s Fixed Point Theorem)\n\nIf \u03c6(v0) is a formula of number theory, then\nthere is a sentence \u03c8 such that P \u22a2 \u03c8 \u2194\n\u03c6(\u2308\u03c8\u2309), where\n\u2308\u03c8\u2309 is the formal term\ncorresponding to the natural number code of\n\u2308\u03c8\u2309.\n\nProof: Let \u03c3(x,y,z) be a\nformula that numeralwise expresses the number theoretic predicate\n\u2018y is the G\u00f6del number of the formula obtained by\nreplacing the variable v0 in the formula whose\nG\u00f6del number is x by the term z\u2019.\nLet \u03b8(v0) be the formula\n\u2203v1(\u03c6(v1) \u2227\n\u03c3(v0, v1,\nv0)).

The\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem as G\u00f6del stated it is as\nfollows:\n\n\nTheorem 3 (G\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness\nTheorem)\n\nIf P is \u03c9-consistent, then there is a sentence which is\nneither provable nor refutable from P.\n\nProof: By judicious coding of syntax referred to above, write\na formula\n Prf(x,y)[11]\n of number theory, representable in P, so that\n\nn codes a proof of \u03c6 \u21d2 P \u22a2\nPrf(n,\n\u2308\u03c6\u2309).\n\n\nand\n\nn does not code a proof of \u03c6 \u21d2 P\n\u22a2 \u00acPrf(n,\n\u2308\u03c6\u2309).\n\n\nLet Prov(y) denote the formula \u2203x\n Prf(x,y)[12].\n By Theorem 2 there is a sentence \u03c6 with the property\n\nP \u22a2 (\u03c6 \u2194\n\u00acProv(\u2308\u03c6\u2309)).\n\n\nThus \u03c6 says \u2018I am not provable.\u2019 We now observe, if\nP \u22a2 \u03c6, then by (1) there is n such that\nP \u22a2 Prf(n,\n\u2308\u03c6\u2309), hence P\n\u22a2 Prov(\u2308\u03c6\u2309), hence,\nby (3) P \u22a2 \u00ac\u03c6, so P is inconsistent.\nThus\n\nP \u22ac \u03c6\n\n\nFurthermore, by (4) and (2), we have P \u22a2\n\u00acPrf(n,\n\u2308\u03c6\u2309) for all natural\nnumbers n. By \u03c9-consistency P \u22ac\n\u2203x Prf(x,\n\u2308\u03c6\u2309). Thus (3) gives\nP \u22ac \u00ac\u03c6. We have shown that if P is\n\u03c9-consistent, then \u03c6 is independent of P.\n\n\nOn concluding the proof of the first theorem, G\u00f6del remarks,\n\u201cwe can readily see that the proof just given is constructive;\nthat is \u2026 proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable\nmanner\u2026\u201d (G\u00f6del 1986, p. 177). This is because, as\nhe points out, all the existential statements are based on his theorem\nV (giving the numeralwise expressibility of primitive recursive\nrelations), which is intuitionistically unobjectionable.\n2.2.3 The Second Incompleteness Theorem\n\nThe Second Incompleteness Theorem establishes the unprovability, in\nnumber theory, of the consistency of number theory. First we have to\nwrite down a number-theoretic formula that expresses the consistency\nof the axioms. This is surprisingly simple. We just let\nCon(P) be the sentence \u00acProv(\u23080 =\n1\u2309).\n\n\nTheorem 4 (G\u00f6del\u2019s Second Incompleteness\nTheorem) If P is consistent, then Con(P) is not\nprovable from P.\n\nProof: Let \u03c6 be as in (3). The reasoning used to infer\n\u2018if P \u22a2 \u03c6, then P \u22a2 0 \u2260\n1\u2018 does not go beyond elementary number theory, and can\ntherefore, albeit with a lot of effort (see below), be formalized in\nP. This yields: P \u22a2\n(Prov(\u2308\u03c6\u2309) \u2192\n\u00acCon(P)), and thus by (3), P \u22a2\n(Con(P) \u2192 \u03c6). Since P \u22ac \u03c6, we\nmust have P \u22ac Con(P).\n\n\nThe above proof (sketch) of the Second Incompleteness Theorem is\ndeceptively simple as it avoids the formalization. A rigorous proof\nwould have to establish the proof of \u2018if P \u22a2\n\u03c6, then P \u22a2 0 \u2260 1\u2019 in P.\n\nIt is noteworthy that \u03c9-consistency is not needed in the proof\nof G\u00f6del\u2019s Second Incompleteness Theorem. Also note that\nneither is \u00acCon(P) provable, by the consistency of\nP and the fact, now known as L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem, that\nP \u22a2\nProv(\u2308\u03c6\u2309) implies\nP \u22a2 \u03c6.\n\nThe assumption of \u03c9-consistency in the First Incompleteness\nTheorem was eliminated by Rosser in 1936, and replaced by the weaker\nnotion of consistency. Rosser\u2019s generalization involves applying\nthe fixed point theorem to the formula R(x):\n\u2018for all z: either z is not the G\u00f6del\nnumber of a proof of the formula with G\u00f6del number x or\nthere is a proof shorter than z of the negation of (the\nformula with G\u00f6del number) x\u2019 (see Rosser\n1936).\n\nWith regard to the Second Incompleteness Theorem, the argument relies\nin part on formalizing the proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem\nas we saw. This step is omitted in G\u00f6del 1931. He planned to\ninclude the step in what would have been a second part II (see\nfootnote 48a of G\u00f6del 1931). But instead of writing it he turned\nto the continuum\n problem.[13]\n (Part II was to elaborate on other points too: the \u2018true reason\nfor incompleteness,\u2019 and the applicability of the two theorems\nto other systems.) He perhaps did not feel compelled to attend to what\nlooked like an exercise in formalization, relying instead on the\ninformal argument to convince (in which it succeeded). However this\nstep turned out to be somewhat non-trivial. As Kleene puts it in his\nintroduction to G\u00f6del 1931, of the informal presentation,\n\u201cCertainly the idea of the argument for Theorem XI (consistency)\nwas very convincing; but it turned out that the execution of the\ndetails required somewhat more work and care than had been\nanticipated.\u201d (See pp. 126\u2013141 of G\u00f6del 1986.)\nEventually a complete proof of the Second Theorem was given by Hilbert\nand Bernays in some seventy pages in their Hilbert and Bernays 1939. A\nmuch more compact treatment of the theorem was given by L\u00f6b in\nhis L\u00f6b 1956, and subsequently Feferman, in his 1960\n\u201cArithmetization of Metamathematics in a General Setting\u201d\n(Feferman 1960/1961), gave a succinct and completely general treatment\nof both the First and Second Theorems. But see the supplementary\ndocument:\n\nDid the Incompleteness Theorems Refute Hilbert\u2019s Program?\n\n\nFor more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems.\n2.3 Speed-up Theorems\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s 1936 \u2018Speed-up\u2019 theorem, published in\nan abstract \u201cOn the length of proofs\u201d, G\u00f6del 1936\nsays that while some sentences of arithmetic are true but unprovable,\nthere are other sentences which are provable, but even the shortest\nproof is longer than any bound given in advance as a recursive\nfunction of the sentence. More exactly:\n\n\nTheorem 5.\n\nGiven any recursive function f there are provable sentences\n\u03c6 of arithmetic such that the shortest proof is greater than\nf(\u2308\u03c6\u2309) in length.\n\n\nThe proof we will outline is sensitive to the particular concept we\nuse for the length of a proof. Another possibility, and the one that\nG\u00f6del has in mind, is the number of formulas in the proof. Buss\n(see below) proves the theorem in either case, so both cases are\nresolved.\n\nProof: Let f be total recursive function. By\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Fixed Point theorem there is a formula\n\u03c6(n) stating \u2018\u03c6(n) has no proof in PA\nshorter than f(n)\u2019. This is tenable if the\nlength is measured by number of symbols, because we only need to\nsearch through finitely many proofs shorter than\nf(n). Note that \u03c6(n) is true for all\nn, for if \u03c6(n) were false, then there would be a\nshort proof of \u03c6(n), and hence by soundness\n\u03c6(n) would be true, a contradiction: \u03c6(n)\nwould both true and false. This can be formalized in PA and thus we\nget the result that for each n the sentence \u03c6(n)\nis provable in PA. Since \u03c6(n) is true for all n,\nit cannot have a proof in PA which is shorter than\nf(n).\n\n\nThe Speed-up Theorem is the result of contemplating and elaborating\nthe proof of the incompleteness theorem. It applies the fixed-point\ntechnique to the concept of unprovability by a short proof, as opposed\nto the original idea of applying the fixed-point theorem to mere\nunprovability. The proof has very much the same flavor as the proof of\nthe incompleteness theorem. Interestingly, it dates from the same year\nas the construction, due to Rosser, that eliminates the use of\n\u03c9-consistency in the first Incompleteness Theorem; like the\nSpeed-up Theorem of G\u00f6del, Rosser\u2019s construction exploits\nthe issue of short and long proofs. G\u00f6del never submitted a proof\nfor the Speed-up Theorem. Over the years several related proofs were\npublished, but the first full proof of G\u00f6del\u2019s original\nresult was given only in 1994 by Sam Buss in his \u2018On\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems on lengths of proofs I: Number of lines\nand speedups for arithmetic.\u2019 (Buss 1994). Buss also gives a\nsecond proof of the theorem which avoids self-reference, following a\ntechnique due to Statman. G\u00f6del measures the length of proofs by\nthe number of formulas; but there are also other possibilities, such\nas the number of symbols in the proof. The case of the Speed-up\nTheorem where the length of proof is measured by the number of symbols\nwas proved by Mostowski in 1952 (Mostowski 1982). For proofs of\nsimilar results see Ehrenfeucht and Mycieleski 1971, and Parikh 1971.\nThough both measures may be equally natural candidates for measuring\nthe length of a proof, proving the theorem for length measured by the\nnumber of symbols avoids a technical complication introduced by the\nother measure: there are only finitely many proofs with a given number\nof symbols, whereas there are infinitely many proofs with a given\nnumber of formulas.\n\nG\u00f6del states the Speed-up Theorem differently from the above. Let\nSn be the system of logic of the n-th\norder, the variables of the first level being thought of as ranging\nover natural numbers. In this setting, variables of the second level\nrange over sets of natural numbers and so on. G\u00f6del\u2019s\nformulation is:\n\n\nTheorem 6.\n\nLet n be a natural number > 0. If f is a\ncomputable function, then there are infinitely many formulas\nA, provable in Sn, such that if\nk is the length of the shortest proof of A in\nSn and l is the length of the\nshortest proof of A in Sn+1,\nthen k > f(l).\n\nProof sketch: The idea is the following: Let\n\u03c6(x) be a formula, like above, for which\n\u03c6(m) does not have a short proof in\nSn for any m. Suppose we have a\nhigher type system Sn+1 in which we can\nprove \u2200x\u03c6(x). This proof is of constant\nlength. Thus each \u03c6(m) is derivable from this universal\nstatement by one application of the logical rule\n\u2200x\u03c6(x) \u2192 \u03c6(t). Thus\n\u03c6(m) has in that system for all m a short\nproof.\n\n\nWhat kind of stronger system can we have in which\n\u2200x\u03c6(x) is provable? We may consider\nsecond order logic in which we can define a predicate\nN(x) for the set of natural numbers and furthermore\ncan prove of a new predicate symbol Tr(x) that it\nsatisfies the inductive clauses of the truth definition of first order\nformulas of arithmetic, relativized to N. Then the stronger\nsystem can prove that provable first order sentences of arithmetic\nsatisfy the predicate Tr . By the above argument, we can\nprove in the stronger system that \u2200x\u03c6(x)\nsatisfies Tr. Then by adding a few lines we can prove each\n\u03c6(n) satisfies Tr. Because of the nature of\n\u03c6(n), this implies the stronger system has a (short)\nproof of \u03c6(n). An alternative system is Peano\u2019s\naxioms PA in an extended language where we have a new predicate symbol\nTr and axioms stating that the predicate Tr codes\nthe satisfaction relation for all sentences of the vocabulary not\ncontaining Tr.\n2.4 G\u00f6del\u2019s Work in Set theory\n2.4.1 The consistency of the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof of the consistency of the continuum\nhypothesis with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is a tour de\nforce and arguably the greatest achievement of his mathematical life.\nThis is because aside from the arithmetization, virtually all of the\ntechnical machinery used in the proof had to be invented ab\ninitio.\n\nThe Continuum Hypothesis (henceforth CH) was formulated by\nGeorg Cantor, and was the first problem on Hilbert\u2019s list of\ntwenty-three unsolved problems as given in his famous address to the\nInternational Mathematical Congress in Paris in 1900. The problem as\nstated by Hilbert is as follows: Let A be an infinite set of\nreal numbers. Then A is either countable, or has cardinality\n2\u21350, i.e., A is in one-to-one\ncorrespondence either with the set of natural numbers or with the set\nof all real numbers (otherwise known as the continuum). Another way to\nstate the continuum hypothesis is that (the first uncountably infinite\ncardinal) \u21351 =\n2\u21350.\n\nAs early as 1922 Skolem speculated that the CH was\nindependent of the axioms for set theory given by Zermelo in 1908.\nNevertheless Hilbert published a (false) proof of the CH in\nHilbert 1926. In 1937 G\u00f6del proved its consistency with the\naxioms of ZF set theory. (Henceforth we use the standard\nabbreviations for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, ZF, and\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice, ZFC.)\nThe consistency of the negation of the CH was shown by Paul\nCohen in 1961 (see Cohen 1963) and hence together with\nG\u00f6del\u2019s result one infers that the CH is\nindependent of ZF (and ZFC).\n\nCohen invented an important new technique called forcing in the course\nof proving his result; this technique is at present the main method\nused to construct models of set theory. Forcing led to a revival of\nformalism among set theorists, the plurality of models being an\nindication of the \u201cessential variability in set theory,\u201d\n(Dehornoy 2004) and away from the notion that there is an intended\nmodel of set theory\u2014a perspective G\u00f6del advocated since at\nleast 1947, if not\n earlier.[14]\n Recently there have been signs that the CH may again be\ncoming to be regarded as a problem to be solved mathematically (with\nthe help of course of some new evident axioms extending ZF). (See for\nexample Woodin 2001a, 2002, 2001b, and Foreman 1998.) If any of the\nproposed solutions gain acceptance, this would confirm\nG\u00f6del\u2019s view that the CH would eventually be\ndecided by finding an evident extension of the ZF axioms for set\ntheory. The program associated with this view is called\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s Large Cardinal Program.\u201d\n2.4.2 G\u00f6del\u2019s Proof of the Consistency of the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice with the Axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory\n\nThe continuum problem is shown to be consistent with ZF by finding an\nenumeration of the reals which is indexed by the countable ordinals, a\nstrategy which had been recognized as a promising one already by\n Hilbert.[15]\n The problem, and the intuition behind the proof, is to build a\n\u201csmall\u201d model, one in which the absolute minimum number of\nreals is allowed, while at the same time the model is large enough to\nbe closed under all the operations the ZF axioms assert to\nexist.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s is a relative consistency proof, obtained by\nconstructing a so-called \u201cinner model\u201d for ZF\ntogether with the CH. An inner model is a subcollection\nM of the collection V of all sets (see below) which\nsatisfies the axioms of ZF when only sets in M are\nconsidered. G\u00f6del\u2019s inner model is called the inner\nmodel of constructible sets (see below) and is denoted by\nL. Whatever is true in an inner model is consistent with\nZF for the same reason that any theory with a model is\nconsistent. An artifact of the construction is that the Axiom of\nChoice (henceforth AC) is satisfied in G\u00f6del\u2019s\ninner model and hence the consistency of the AC with\nZF was established by G\u00f6del. Later on it was shown by\nSierpinski that the AC is actually a consequence of the\nGeneralized Continuum Hypothesis or the GCH, which states\nthat for each \u03ba, 2\u03ba = \u03ba+ (see\nSierpinski 1947).\n\nG\u00f6del published two versions of these theorems, in 1939 and in\n1940, entitled \u201cConsistency Proof for the Generalized Continuum\nHypothesis,\u201d and \u201cThe Consistency of the Axiom of Choice\nand of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis with the Axioms of Set\nTheory,\u201d respectively. Though completely definitive, the 1939\nversion is lacking in a great many details, most notably the arguments\nshowing that if L is built inside L itself, the same\nL results; that is to say, the so-called absoluteness\narguments are missing. Also missing are the details of the proofs that\nthe ZF axioms hold in L. Unlike the case of the\nSecond Incompleteness Theorem, however, G\u00f6del subsequently gave a\ncompletely detailed proof of the two theorems in the 1940 monograph.\n(The 1940 proof differs substantially from the first version. For\ndetails about the two proofs and the difference between them the\nreader is referred to Solovay 1990 and Kanamori 2006.)\n\nWe now sketch the proof of the consistency of CH and of\nAC with ZFC, using modern terminology. Some\npreliminary concepts before sketching the proof: We first define the\nstratified set theoretic universe, denoted V. (V is\nalso known as the cumulative hierarchy.) It is obtained by iteration\nof the power set operation (\u2118) beginning with the null set:\n\n\n\n\nV0\n=\n\u2205, \n\nV\u03b1+1\n=\n\u2118(V\u03b1), \n\nV\u03b3\n=\n\u222a\u03b2<\u03b3\nV\u03b2,  \n\n\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are any ordinals, \u03b3 is a limit ordinal and\n\u2118(x) denotes the power set of x. Finally\n\n\n\n\nV\n=\n\u222a\u03b1\u2208Ord\nV\u03b1,  \n\n\n\nwhere Ord denotes the class of all ordinals.\n\nThe constructible hierarchy L is likewise defined by\nrecursion on ordinals. But whereas the full power set operation is\niterated to obtain the cumulative hierarchy, the levels of the\nconstructible hierarchy are defined strictly predicatively, that is by\nincluding at the next level only those sets which are first order\ndefinable using parameters from the previous level. More exactly, let\nDef(A) denote the set of all subsets of A\ndefinable in the structure < A, \u2208 > by first order\nformulas with parameters in A. (For more on definability see\nthe entry on\n model theory\n in this encyclopedia.)\n\nWith this notation the constructible hierarchy is defined by induction\nover the ordinals as follows:\n\n\n\n\nL0\n=\n\u2205, \n\nL\u03b1+1\n=\nDef(L\u03b1),\n\n\nL\u03b3\n=\n\u222a\u03b1<\u03b3\nL\u03b1, \n\nL\n=\n\u222a\u03b1\u2208Ord\nL\u03b1,  \n\n\n\nA set x is said to be constructible if x\n\u2208 L. The axiom which states that all sets are\nconstructible is denoted V = L and is called the\nAxiom of Constructibility. Note that L is a proper class and\nnot a set; although as we will see, each L\u03b1 \nis a set, and the predicate \u201cx is constructible\u201d\nis actually a definable term of the language.\n\nOur next task is to show that L is a model of ZF. A\nset or a class is transitive if elements of it are also\nsubsets. By a meticulous transfinite induction, L\u03b1\n can be shown to be transitive for each \u03b1; and therefore\nso is L itself. This fact, together with the observation that\nsome elementary closure properties hold in L\n[16]\n is enough to show that L is a model of ZF. (Indeed,\nas it turns out, L is the minimal transitive model of the\nZF axioms containing all the ordinals, and is therefore in\nthis sense canonical.)\n\nIn detail, proving that the ZF axioms, apart from the\ncomprehension axiom, are true in L, amounts to showing that,\nroughly speaking, any set with a property P that a\nZF axiom asserts to exist, can be seen to exist in L\nby considering the relativization PL of the\nproperty P to L. (A property P is\nrelativized to an inner model M by replacing every quantifier\n\u2203x\u03c6 by \u2203x(x \u2208\nM \u2227 \u03c6) and every quantifier \u2200x\u03c6\nby \u2200x(x \u2208 M\u2192 \u03c6).) As\nfor the comprehension axiom, verifying it requires showing that the\nset asserted to exist is constructed at a particular successor level\nL\u03b1 + 1. Proving this requires an important\nprinciple of set theory which in modern terminology is called the Levy\n(or ZF) Reflection Principle. This principle says that any\nstatement in the language of ZF which is true in V\nis already true on some level of any continuously increasing hierarchy\nsuch as L. (For the history of this principle, see Kanamori\n2006.) The Levy Reflection Principle gives the level \u03b1 at which\nthe elements of the set are all constructed. G\u00f6del did not\nactually have the Levy Reflection Principle but used the argument\nbehind the proof of the principle.\n\nOnce it is established that L is a model of ZF, one\ncan now prove that both the CH and the AC hold in\nL. To this end, one first shows that the definition of\nL is absolute for L, where absoluteness is\ndefined as follows: given a class M, a predicate\nP(x) is said to be absolute for M if and\nonly if for all x \u2208 M, P(x)\n\u2194 PM(x).\n\nProving that the predicate \u201cx is constructible\u201d\nis absolute requires formalizing the notion of definability, which in\nturn requires formalizing the notion of satisfaction. This is because\nthe predicate \u201cx is constructible\u201d says of a set,\nthat for some ordinal \u03b1, and for some formula \u03c6 with\nparameters in L\u03b1, x = {y\n\u2208 L\u03b1  | L\u03b1\n\u22a8 \u03c6(y)}. This part of the proof is tedious but\nunproblematic.\n\nOnce the absoluteness of L is established, it follows that\nZF satisfies the axiom of constructibility if it is\nrelativized to L; that is, ZF \u22a2\n(V=L)L. In particular, the axiom V = L is\nconsistent if ZF is.\n\nWe now give the idea of the proof of CH and AC in\nZF + V = L. (For a detailed exposition of\nthe proof, the reader is referred to the standard sources. See for\nexample Devlin\u2019s chapter on constructibility in Barwise 1977;\nsee also Kunen 1983, and Jech 2003.)\n\nAs concerns the CH, the idea behind the proof of it in\nL is simply the following: G\u00f6del showed that assuming\nV = L, every real number occurs on some countable\nlevel of the L-hierarchy. Since every countable level is\nitself countable (after all, there are only countably many possible\ndefining formulas), and there are \u03c91 countable\nlevels, there must be only \u03c91 real numbers.\n\nThe difficulty here, if not of the whole proof altogether, lies in\nshowing that every real is constructed already on a countable level of\nthe L-hierarchy. To show this G\u00f6del argued as follows:\nSuppose A is a real number thought of as a set of natural\nnumbers. By a combination of the Levy Reflection principle and the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem there is a countable submodel <\nM, \u2208 > of < L, \u2208 > satisfying a\nsufficiently large finite part of the ZF axioms +\nV = L, such that A belongs to M.\nBy a simple procedure < M, \u2208 > can be converted\ninto a transitive model < N, \u2208 >. This procedure,\nused by G\u00f6del already in 1937, was explicitly isolated by\nMostowski (Mostowski 1949). The resulting model is referred to as the\nMostowski Collapse.\n\nLet us pause to discuss this important technique. Suppose <\nM, E> is a well-founded model of the axiom of\nextensionality. It is a consequence of the well-foundedness of the\nbinary predicate E on M, and of the principle of\ntransfinite recursion, that the equation \u03c0(x) =\n{\u03c0(y)\u2009|\u2009y \u2208 M \u2227\nyEx} defines a unique function on M. The range\nN of \u03c0 is transitive, for if \u03c0(a) \u2208\nN and y \u2208 \u03c0(a), then y =\n\u03c0(b) for some b \u2208 M with\nbEa, whence \u03c0(b) \u2208 N. The fact that\n\u03c0 is an isomorphism between < M, E> and\n< N, \u2208 > can be proved by transfinite induction on\nelements on M, based again on the well-foundedness of\nE. The well-foundedness of < M, E> is\nin practice often the consequence of < M, E>\nbeing a submodel of some < V\u03b1, \u03b5\n>.\n\nWe now return to the proof of the CH in L. We used\nthe Mostowski Collapse to construct the transitive set N. As\nit turns out, the real number A is still an element of <\nN, \u2208 > . By basic properties of L, <\nN, \u2208 > must be < L\u03b1 ,\n\u2208 > for some \u03b1 . Since N is countable, \u03b1\nis countable too. (It can be shown that |L\u03b1|\n= |\u03b1| + \u21350.) Thus A is constructible\non a countable level, which was to have been shown.\n\nAs for the AC, G\u00f6del exhibits a definable well-ordering,\nthat is, a formula of set theory which defines, in L, a\nwell-ordering of all of L. The formula is tedious to write\ndown but the idea is a simple one: A set x precedes a set\ny in the well-ordering if and only if either x\noccurs in the L-hierarchy on an earlier level\nL\u03b1  than y, or else they occur on\nthe same level but x is defined by a shorter formula than\ny, or else they are defined by the same formula but the\nparameters in the definition of x occur in L earlier\nthan the parameters of y. This well-ordering of L\nshows that the AC holds in L.\n\nThis concludes the proof of the consistency of AC and the\nCH in L.\n\nWe note that G\u00f6del proved more in his 1939 and 1940 than what was\nshown here, namely he proved the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis in\nL and hence that its consistency with ZF.\n2.4.3 Consequences of Consistency\n\nAs noted above, it was suggested already in the 1920s that the\nCH might be independent of ZF or ZFC. After\nfirst conjecturing that the Axiom of Constructibility might be\n\u201cabsolutely consistent,\u201d meaning not falsifiable by any\nfurther extension of models of ZF + V =\n L,[17]\n in his 1947 \u201cWhat is Cantor\u2019s Continuum\nHypothesis?\u201d G\u00f6del conjectured that the CH would\nbe shown to be independent. The main consequence of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nresult, then, as far as the problem of proving the independence of the\nCH is concerned, was that it pointed mathematicians in the\ndirection of adding non-constructible sets to a model of set theory in\norder to establish the consistency of the negation of the CH.\nIn 1961 Dana Scott proved that the failure of the Axiom of\nConstructibility follows from the existence of a measurable cardinal,\ncontrary to a conjecture G\u00f6del had made in 1940. (See Scott 1961.\nA cardinal \u03ba is said to be measurable if there is a\nnon-principal \u03ba-complete ultrafilter in the power-set Boolean\nalgebra of \u03ba.) In 1963, as noted, Paul Cohen proved the\nconsistency of the negation of the CH by adding\nnon-constructible sets to an inner model.\n\nWhat other open questions of set theory could be solved by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s method? G\u00f6del himself noted some consequences.\nThey are related to so called projective sets of real numbers and\nfinite sequences of real numbers. The simplest projective sets are the\nclosed sets, also called \u03a010-sets. A set is\n\u03a31n+1 if it is the projection of\na \u03a01n-subset of the real plane. A\nset is \u03941n+1 if it and its\ncomplement are \u03a31n+1. G\u00f6del\nobserved that there is both a non-Lebesgue measurable\n\u039412-set and an uncountable\n\u03a011-set without a perfect subset in\nL. (A set of reals is perfect if it is closed, non-empty, and\nhas no isolated points. Such sets have the size of the continuum.)\nG\u00f6del gave a sketch of the proof in the 1951 second printing of\nG\u00f6del 1940.\n\nIt has turned out subsequently that the axiom V = L\ngives a virtually complete extension of ZFC. This means that,\napart from sentences arising from G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems, essentially all set-theoretical questions can be decided by\nmeans of the axioms V = L. This is not to imply that\nsuch results are in any way trivial. Indeed, it has turned out that\nL is quite a complicated structure, despite its relatively\nsimple description. As for settling open set-theoretical questions in\nL, the main step was the emergence of Jensen\u2019s fine\nstructure theory of L (Jensen 1972). Recalling that the\nsuccessor step L\u03b1 +1 in the definition of\nthe constructible hierarchy adds to L all subsets of\nL\u03b1  definable by first order formulas \u03c6\nover (L\u03b1, \u2208), fine structure theory,\nroughly speaking, ramifies the step from L\u03b1 \nto L\u03b1+1 into smaller steps according to the\ncomplexity of the defining formula \u03c6. Jensen established by means\nof his fine structure a strengthening, denoted by \u25ca, of\nCH, that he used to construct a Souslin tree in L,\nand a combinatorial principle \u25a1 that he used to show that the\nSouslin Hypothesis is consistent with CH.\n2.4.4 G\u00f6del\u2019s view of the Axiom of Constructibility\n\nIf he did not think this way from the outset, G\u00f6del soon came to\nadopt the view that the Axiom of Constructibility was implausible. As\nhe remarked at the end of his 1947 \u201cWhat is Cantor\u2019s\nContinuum Hypothesis?\u201d\n\n\u2026it is very suspicious that, as against the numerous plausible\npropositions which imply the negation of the continuum hypothesis, not\none plausible proposition is known which would imply the continuum\nhypothesis. (G\u00f6del 1990, p. 186)\n\n\nG\u00f6del was compelled to this view of L by the\n Leibnizian[18]\n idea that, rather than the universe being \u201csmall,\u201d that\nis, one with the minimum number of sets, it is more natural to think\nof the set theoretic universe as being as large as\n possible.[19]This\n idea would be reflected in his interest in maximality principles,\ni.e., principles which are meant to capture the intuitive idea that\nthe universe of set theory is maximal in the sense that nothing can be\nadded; and in his conviction that maximality principles would\neventually settle statements like the CH. As G\u00f6del put\nit in a letter to Ulam in the late 1950s, about a maximality principle\nof von Neumann:\n\nThe great interest which this axiom has lies in the fact that it is a\nmaximality principle, somewhat similar to Hilbert\u2019s axiom of\ncompleteness in geometry. For, roughly speaking, it says that any set\nwhich does not, in a certain well defined way, imply an inconsistency\nexists. Its being a maximum principle also explains the fact that this\naxiom implies the axiom of choice. I believe that the basic problems\nof set theory, such as Cantor\u2019s continuum problem, will be\nsolved satisfactorily only with the help of stronger axioms of this\nkind, which in a sense are opposite or complimentary to the\nconstructivistic interpretation of mathematics. (Ulam 1958, as quoted\nin G\u00f6del 1990, p. 168; original emphasis. Note that this is\ndifferent from the very similar passage G\u00f6del 2003b, p.295.)\n\n\nTwenty years earlier, in 1938, G\u00f6del had written seemingly\ndifferently about the Axiom of Constructibility:\n\nThe proposition A (i.e., V = L) added as a\nnew axiom seems to give a natural completion of the axioms of set\ntheory, in so far as it determines the vague notion of an arbitrary\ninfinite set in a definite way. (G\u00f6del 1986, p.27)\n\n\nG\u00f6del may have meant by \u201cnatural completion\u201d here\n\u201cthe correct completion,\u201d or he may have meant to say no\nmore than that the Axiom of Constructibility determines the notion of\nset in a definite way. In any case he used the term\n\u201cnatural\u201d differently in a conversation with Wang on\nconstructibility in 1972 (Wang 1996, p. 144):\n\nG\u00f6del talked more about the relation between axioms of infinity\nand the constructible universe\u2026(he observed that) preliminary\nconcepts such as that of constructible sets are necessary to arrive at\nthe natural concept, such as that of set.\n\n\nThis is reminiscent of a remark of Hugh Woodin, that studying forcing\nleads to a better understanding of V \u2014 the general\nprinciple being that studying the models of a theory is not only\nuseful to understand the theory itself, but useful to obtain a better\npicture of V (Woodin 1988).\n\nFor more on G\u00f6del\u2019s program and on G\u00f6del\u2019s\nprogram relative to the CH the reader is referred e.g., to\nSteel forthcoming and Feferman et al. 2000. For more on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s result, its history , and its significance the\nreader is referred to Floyd/Kanamori 2006 and Kennedy 2006.\n2.5 G\u00f6del\u2019s Work in Intuitionistic Logic and Arithmetic\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s interest in intuitionism was deep and long-lasting.\nAlthough he himself did not subscribe to that view, he made a number\nof important contributions to intuitionistic logic. Perhaps the\nimportance he placed on the concept of evidence (see below) led to his\nclose consideration of it.\n\nWe discuss G\u00f6del\u2019s results on intuitionistic logic in their\nchronological order.\n2.5.1 Intuitionistic Propositional Logic is not Finitely-Valued\n\nBoth many-valued logic, introduced by \u0141ukasiewicz in the twenties\n(\u0141ukasiewicz 1970) and intuitionistic logic, formalized by\nHeyting in 1930, fail to satisfy the law of excluded middle. It was\ntherefore natural to ask whether intuitionistic logic can be presented\nas a many-valued logic, and indeed a number of logicians in the 1920s\nhad suggested just that. In his 1932 G\u00f6del gave a simple argument\nwhich shows that intuitionistic propositional logic cannot be thought\nof as a finitely-valued logic. Precisely, G\u00f6del proved two\ntheorems:\n\nTheorem 7.\n\nThere is no realization with finitely many elements (truth values) for\nwhich the formulas provable in H, and only those, are\nsatisfied (that is, yield designated values for an arbitrary\nassignment).\n\n\n(H is intuitionistic propositional logic, after\nHeyting.)\n\nTheorem 8.\n\nInfinitely many systems lie between H and the system\nA of the ordinary propositional calculus, that is,\nthere is a monotonically decreasing sequence of systems all of which\ninclude H as a subset and are included in\nA as subsets.\n\n\nIn his proof he considered for each natural number n > 0\nthe sentence\n\nFn = \u22281\n\u2264 i < j \u2264 n\npi \u2261\npj.\n\n\nHe observed that in an n-valued logic the sentences\nFm, for m > n,\nshould be derivable. However, G\u00f6del showed,\nFn is not derivable from Heyting\u2019s\naxioms for any n.\n\nSubsequently Ja\u015bkowski (Ja\u015bkowski 1936) showed that\nintuitionistic propositional logic can be given a many-valued\nsemantics in terms of infinitely many truth-values. For further\ndiscussion of many-valued logics, see for example the entry on\n many-valued logic\n in this encyclopedia as well as van Stigt\u2019s article on\nintuitionistic logic in Mancosu 1998.\n2.5.2 Classical Arithmetic is Interpretable in Heyting Arithmetic\n\nWe now consider G\u00f6del 1933e, in which G\u00f6del showed, in\neffect, that intuitionistic or Heyting arithmetic is only apparently\nweaker than classical first-order arithmetic. This is because the\nlatter can be interpreted within the former by means of a simple\ntranslation, and thus to be convinced of the consistency of classical\narithmetic, it is enough to be convinced of the consistency of Heyting\narithmetic. Heyting arithmetic is defined to be the same as classical\narithmetic, except that the underlying predicate logic is given by\nintuitionistic axioms and rules of inference (see below).\n\nThis result extends the same assertion for the propositional case. Let\nH denote the intuitionistic propositional logic, and\nA denote its classical counterpart (as above).\nInductively define:\n\n\n\n\nA\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00ac\u00acA (A atomic) \n\n(\u00acA)\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00acA\u2032 \n\n(A \u2192 B)\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00ac(A\u2032 \u2227\n\u00acB\u2032) \n\n(A \u2228 B)\u2032\n\u2261\n\u00ac(\u00acA\u2032 \u2227\n\u00acB\u2032) \n\n(A \u2227 B)\u2032\n\u2261\nA\u2032 \u2227 B\u2032\n \n\n\n\nThen,\n\nTheorem 9.\n\nLet F be a propositional formula. Then H\n\u22a2 F if and only if A \u22a2\nF\u2032,\n\n\nThe theorem follows easily from the result of Glivenko (1929) that\n\u00acF follows from H if and only if\n\u00acF follows from A, for any propositional\nformula F.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s so-called double negation interpretation extends\nTheorem 9 to a reduction of classical first order logic to\nintuitionistic predicate logic. The translation in this case can be\ntaken to map A\u2032 to A for atomic A.\nMoreover, we let \u2200xA(x)\u2032 =\n\u2200xA\u2032(x) :\n\nTheorem 10.\n\nSuppose A is a first order formula. If A is provable\nin classical first order logic, then A\u2032 is provable in\nintuitionistic first order logic.\n\n\nThe above result had been obtained independently by Gentzen (with\nBernays), but upon hearing of G\u00f6del\u2019s result Gentzen\nwithdrew his paper from publication. It had also been anticipated by\nKolmogorov in his 1925 \u201cOn the Principle of the Excluded\nMiddle,\u201d (English translation van Heijenoort 1967) but that\npaper was largely unknown to logicians who were outside of\nKolmogorov\u2019s circle.\n\nBernays has written (see Bernays\u2019 entry on David Hilbert in\nEdwards 1967) that this result of G\u00f6del\u2019s drew the\nattention of the Hilbert school to two observations: first, that\nintuitionistic logic goes beyond finitism, and secondly, that finitist\nsystems may not be the only acceptable ones from the foundational\npoint of view.\n\nThe following theorem for the case of arithmetic follows from Theorem\n10:\n\nTheorem 11.\n\nSuppose A is a first order formula of arithmetic. If\nA is provable in classical Peano arithmetic, then\nA\u2032 is provable in intuitionistic first order\narithmetic.\n\n\nFor a list of the axioms and rules of intuitionistic first order logic\nsee G\u00f6del 1958, reprinted with detailed introductory note by A.S.\nTroelstra in G\u00f6del 1990. See also Troelstra 1973, and\nTroelstra\u2019s \u201cAspects of constructive mathematics\u201d in\nBarwise 1977. For a detailed proof of the above theorem the reader is\nreferred also to the latter.\n2.5.3 Intuitionistic Propositional Logic is Interpretable in S4\n\nThis result of G\u00f6del\u2019s (G\u00f6del 1933f), which marks the\nbeginning of provability logic, makes exact the difference between the\nconcept of \u201cprovability in a specified formal system\u201d and\nthat of \u201cprovability by any correct means.\u201d\n\nG\u00f6del had already noted this difference in the introduction to\nhis 1929 thesis. The context was the following: G\u00f6del entertains\nthere the possibility that his proof of the Completeness Theorem might\nbe circular, since the law of excluded middle was used to prove it.\nThis is because while the Completeness Theorem asserts \u2018a kind\nof decidability,\u2019 namely every quantificational formula is\neither provable or a counterexample to it can be given, \u2018the\nprinciple of the excluded middle seems to express nothing other than\nthe decidability of every problem\u2019:\n\n\u2026 what is affirmed (by the law of excluded middle) is the\nsolvability not at all through specified means but only through all\nmeans that are in any way imaginable \u2026\n [20]\n\n\nG\u00f6del considers intuitionistic propositional logic (henceforth\nIPL); he also considers a second system, classical propositional logic\nenriched by an operator \u201cB\u201d, where the intended meaning of\n\u201cB\u201d is \u201cprovable.\u201d The axiom system now known\nas S4 (for a list of these axioms see for example the\nentry on\n modal logic\n in this encyclopedia) is added to the standard axioms for classical\npropositional logic together with a new rule of proof: from\nA, BA may be inferred. Let us call this second\nsystem G. G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem states that\nIPL is interpretable in G via the following\ntranslation:\n\n\n\n\n\u00acp\n\u2261\n~Bp \n\np \u2283 q\n\u2261\nBp \u2192 Bq \n\np \u2228 q\n\u2261\nBp \u2228 Bq \n\np \u2227 q\n\u2261\nBp \u2227 Bq  \n\n\n\nThat is,\n\nTheorem 12.\n\nLet A be a formula of IPL, and let A\u2032\nbe its translation. Then IPL \u22a2 A implies\nG \u22a2 A\u2032.\n\n\nG\u00f6del conjectures that the converse implication must be true, and\nindeed this was shown in McKinsey and Tarski 1948.\n\nThe difference between the two notions of provability: \u201cprovable\nin a given formal system S\u201d and provability by any\ncorrect means \u2014 manifests itself as a consequence of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Second Incompleteness Theorem, as follows. Let\nS contain Peano arithmetic, and let the operator B be\ninterpreted as \u201cprovable in S\u201d. If the axioms of\nS4 were valid for this interpretations of B,\nthen from B(0 \u2260 1) \u2192 (0 \u2260 1), the sentence\n\u00acB(0 \u2260 1) would be provable, contradicting the Second\nIncompleteness Theorem.\n\nFor further discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, its antecedents\nand its extensions, as well as its philosophical significance, the\nreader is referred to A.S Troelstra\u2019s introduction to\n1933f.\n2.5.4 Heyting Arithmetic is Interpretable into Computable Functionals of Finite Type.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s so-called Dialectica intepretation (G\u00f6del\n1958) delivers a relative consistency proof and justification for\nHeyting arithmetic by means of a concrete interpretation involving a\nsystem T of computable functionals of finite type. Taken\ntogether with his 1933e, which reduces classical first order\narithmetic to Heyting arithmetic, a justification in these terms is\nalso obtained for classical first order arithmetic.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s inductive definition of the notion \u201cfunction\nof finite type\u201d is as follows: (G\u00f6del 1990, p. 245).\n\nThe functionals of type 0 are the natural numbers.\nIf t0,\u2026,\ntk are types and we have already defined\nwhat functionals of types\nt0,\u2026,tk are,\nthen (t0,\u2026,\ntk) is a type and a functional of that\ntype assigns to every k-tuple of functionals of respective\ntypes t1,\u2026,\ntk, a functional of type\nt0.\n\n\nG\u00f6del considers the quantifier free theory of these functionals\nof finite type, denoted by T. T has the following\nfeatures: the language of T contains variables of each type,\nconstants for distinguished types, and a ternary predicate\n=\u03c3 for equality for type \u03c3. Equality between\nterms of the same type is decidable. The non-logical axioms and rules\nfor T include the classical arithmetic axioms for 0 and\nsuccessor, and the induction rule:\n\n(F(0) \u2227 (F(x0) \u2192\nF(S(x0)))) \u2192\nF(x0)\n\n\nfor quantifier-free formulas F(x0). As\nG\u00f6del remarks (G\u00f6del 1990, p. 247), the axioms for\nT are essentially those of primitive recursive arithmetic,\nexcept that the variables can be of any finite type.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s translation associates with every formula\nF(x) of the language of Peano arithmetic a\nformula F\u2032(x) =\n\u2203y\u2200zA(y,\nz, x) of the language of the theory\nT, where A is quantifier free and the (boldface)\nbound variables are finite sequences of variables thought to range\nover functionals of a finite type determined by the type of the\nvariable. Intuitively, y is a concrete analogue of\nthe abstract notion of a construction constituting the meaning of\nF.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem is as follows:\n\nTheorem 13.\n\nSuppose F\u2032 =\n\u2203y\u2200zA(y,\nz, x). If F is provable in\nintuitionistic first order arithmetic, then there are computable\nfunctionals Q of finite type such that\nA(Q(x), z,\nx) is provable in T.\n\n\nThe proof is by induction on the structure of the proof of F\nin intuitionistic first order arithmetic. (For a treatment of the\nproof in detail, the reader is referred to Troelstra 1986.)\n\nThe importance of the theorem for foundations cannot be\n overstated.[21]\n A discussion of its generalizations, of ensuing work on functional\ninterpretations stimulated by the theorem due to Kreisel, Tait,\nHoward, Feferman and others; its foundational and philosophical\nsignificance; and finally its relation particularly to the earlier,\ninformal, proof interpretation, so-called, given by\nHeyting-Kolmogorov, will not be attempted here. Accordingly the reader\nis referred to the large literature on the subject, e.g., the\nabovementioned Troelstra 1986, Tait 1967, Feferman 1993 and Avigad\n& Feferman 1998. For interesting recent developments, e.g., in the\narea of relating G\u00f6del\u2019s Dialectica interpretation and\nKreisel\u2019s modified realizability, see Oliva 2006. See also van\nOosten 2008.\n\nA remark concerning the philosophical context in which G\u00f6del\npresented his translation, namely finitism. The question addressed in\nthe introduction to the paper is what abstract notions must\nbe added to finitary mathematics in order to obtain a consistency\nproof for arithmetic. Equivalently: what does the finitary view\npresuppose, which must be given up in the light of the Second\nIncompleteness Theorem, if the consistency proof is to be\nobtained:\n\nIn any case Bernays\u2019 remark teaches us to distinguish two\ncomponents of the finitary attitude; namely, first, the constructive\nelement, which consists in our being allowed to speak of mathematical\nobjects only insofar as we can exhibit them or actually produce them\nby means of a construction; second, the specifically finitistic\nelement, which makes the further demand that the objects about which\nwe make statements, with which the constructions are carried out and\nwhich we obtain by means of these constructions, are\n\u2018intuitive\u2019, that is, are in the last analysis\nspatiotemporal arrangements of elements whose characteristics other\nthan their identity or nonidentity are irrelevant.\u2026 It is the\nsecond requirement that must be dropped. This fact has hitherto been\ntaken into account by our adjoining to finitary mathematics parts of\nintuitionistic logic and the theory of ordinals. In what follows we\nshall show that, for the consistency proof of number theory, we can\nuse, instead, the notion of computable function of finite type on the\nnatural numbers and certain rather elementary principles of\nconstruction for such functions. (G\u00f6del 1990, p.245).\n\n\nAside from its technical contribution, then, G\u00f6del\u2019s\n1958/72 is one of G\u00f6del\u2019s most important philosophical\nworks; notable for its analysis of the nature of finitary mathematics,\nas well as its analysis of the notions of \u201cintuitive,\u201d as\nin \u201cintuitive knowledge,\u201d and that of abstract versus\nconcrete evidence.\n\nIn the next section, we turn to G\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical\nviews. But interested readers may wish to read a brief discussion\nabout G\u00f6del\u2019s Nachlass, important source of philosophical\nmaterial by G\u00f6del:\n\nSupplement Document: G\u00f6del\u2019s Documents\n\n3. G\u00f6del\u2019s Philosophical Views\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical views can be broadly characterized by\ntwo points of focus, or, in modern parlance, commitments. These are:\nrealism, namely the belief that mathematics is a descriptive science\nin the way that the empirical sciences are. The second commitment is\nto a form of Leibnizian rationalism in philosophy; and in fact\nG\u00f6del\u2019s principal philosophical influences, in this regard\nparticularly but also many others, were Leibniz, Kant and Husserl.\n(For further discussion of how these philosophers influenced\nG\u00f6del, see van Atten and Kennedy 2003.)\n\nThe terms \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s realism\u201d and\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism\u201d must be prefaced with a\ndisclaimer: there is no single view one could associate with each of\nthese terms. G\u00f6del\u2019s realism underwent a complex\ndevelopment over time, in both the nature of its ontological claims as\nwell as in G\u00f6del\u2019s level of commitment to those claims.\nSimilarly G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism underwent a complex\ndevelopment over time, from a tentative version of it at the\nbeginning, to what was adjudged to be a fairly strong version of it in\nthe 1950s. Around 1959 and for some time afterward G\u00f6del fused\nhis rationalistic program of developing exact philosophy with the\nphenomenological method as developed by Husserl.\n\nWe examine these two strains of G\u00f6del\u2019s thinking below:\n3.1 G\u00f6del\u2019s Rationalism\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism has its roots in the Leibnizian thought\nthat the world, not that which we immanently experience but that which\nitself gives rise to immanent experience, is perfect and beautiful,\nand therefore rational and ordered. G\u00f6del\u2019s justification\nof this belief rests partly on an inductive generalization from the\nperfection and beauty of mathematics:\n\nRationalism is connected with Platonism because it is directed to the\nconceptual aspect rather than toward the (real) world. One uses\ninductive evidence\u2026Mathematics has a form of\nperfection\u2026We may expect that the conceptual world is perfect,\nand, furthermore, that objective reality is beautiful, good, and\nperfect. (Wang 1996, 9.4.18)\n\n\nOur total reality and total experience are beautiful and\nmeaningful\u2014this is also a Leibnizian thought. We should judge\nreality by the little which we truly know of it. Since that part which\nconceptually we know fully turns out to be so beautiful, the real\nworld of which we know so little should also be beautiful.\n(9.4.20)\n\n\nAlthough the roots of G\u00f6del\u2019s belief in rationalism are\nmetaphysical in nature, his long-standing aspirations in that domain\nhad always been practical ones. Namely, to develop exact methods in\nphilosophy; to transform it into an exact science, or strenge\nWissenschaft, to use Husserl\u2019s term.\n\nWhat this means in practice is taking the strictest view possible of\nwhat constitutes the dialectical grounds for the acceptance\nof an assertion; put another way, a level of rigor is aspired to in\nphilosophical arguments approaching that which is found in\nmathematical proofs. A formulation of the view\u2014one which is\nsomewhat phenomenologically colored (see below)\u2014can be found in\na document in the G\u00f6del Nachlass. This is a fourteen item list\nG\u00f6del drew up in about 1960, entitled \u201cMy Philosophical\nViewpoint.\u201d Two items on the list are relevant here:\n\nThere are systematic methods for the solution of all problems\n(also art, etc.).\n\n\nThere is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals\nwith concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most\nhighly fruitful for science.\n\n\n(The list was transcribed by Cheryl Dawson and was published in\nWang 1996, p. 316.)\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s earlier conception of rationalism refers to\nmathematical rigor and includes the concept of having a genuine proof,\nand is therefore in some sense a more radical one than that to which\nhe would later subscribe. One can see it at work at the end of the\nGibbs lecture, after a sequence of arguments in favor of realism are\ngiven:\n\nOf course I do not claim that the foregoing considerations amount to a\nreal proof of this view about the nature of mathematics. The most I\ncould assert would be to have disproved the nominalistic view, which\nconsiders mathematics to consist solely in syntactical conventions and\ntheir consequences. Moreover, I have adduced some strong arguments\nagainst the more general view that mathematics is our own creation.\nThere are, however, other alternatives to Platonism, in particular\npsychologism and Aristotelian realism. In order to establish Platonic\nrealism, these theories would have to be disproved one after the\nother, and then it would have to be shown that they exhaust all\npossibilities. I am not in a position to do this now; however I would\nlike to give some indications along these lines. (G\u00f6del 1995, p.\n321\u20132).\n\n\n(For a penetrating analysis of this passage see Tait 2001.) Such an\nanalysis must be based on conceptual analysis:\n\nI am under the impression that after sufficient clarification of the\nconcepts in question it will be possible to conduct these discussions\nwith mathematical rigour and that the result will then be\u2026that\nthe Platonistic view is the only one tenable. (G\u00f6del 1995, p.\n322).\n\n\nAlong with the methodological component, as can be seen from the items\non G\u00f6del\u2019s list, there was also an \u201coptimistic\u201d\ncomponent to G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism: once the appropriate\nmethods have been developed, philosophical problems such as, for\nexample, those in ethics (e.g., item 9 on the list is: \u201cFormal\nrights comprise a real science.\u201d) can be decisively solved. As\nfor mathematical assertions, such as the Continuum Hypothesis in set\ntheory, once conceptual analysis has been carried out in the right\nway, that is, once the basic concepts, such as that of\n\u201cset,\u201d have been completely clarified, the Continuum\nHypothesis should be able to be decided.\n\nAlthough at the time of the Gibbs lecture the analogy in\nG\u00f6del\u2019s mind between philosophical and mathematical\nreasoning may have been a very close one, G\u00f6del\u2019s view at\nother periods was that the envisaged methods will not be mathematical\nin nature. What was wanted was a general, informal science of\nconceptual analysis.\n\nPhilosophy is more general than science. Already the theory of\nconcepts is more general than mathematics\u2026True philosophy is\nprecise but not specialized.\n\n\nPerhaps the reason why no progress is made in mathematics (and there\nare so many unsolved problems), is that one confines oneself to the\next[ensional]\u2014thence also the feeling of disappointment in the\ncase of many theories, e.g., propositional logic and formalisation\naltogether. (Wang 1996, 9.3.20,\n 9.3.21)[22]\n\n\n(See notebook Max IV, p. 198 (G\u00f6del Nachla\u00df, Firestone\nLibrary, Princeton, item 030090). Transcription Cheryl Dawson;\ntranslation from the German ours; amendment ours. G\u00f6del\u2019s\ndating of Max IV indicates that it is from May 1941 to April 1942. See\nalso G\u00f6del\u2019s letter to Bernays, G\u00f6del 2003a, p.\n283.)\n\nAn important source for understanding G\u00f6del\u2019s advance\ntoward a general theory of concepts are G\u00f6del\u2019s remarks on\nconceptual analysis published by Hao Wang in Logical Journey.\nIn remark 8.6.10 for example, G\u00f6del expresses the belief that\nextensionality fails for concepts, contrary to what he said in his\n1944 \u201cRussell\u2019s Mathematical Logic,\u201d a remark which\nhe now wishes to retract:\n\nI do not (no longer) believe that generally sameness of range is\nsufficient to exclude the distinctness of two concepts.\n\n\nIn some of G\u00f6del\u2019s later discussions another component of\nconceptual analysis emerges, namely the project of finding the\nso-called primitive terms or concepts, and their relations. These are\nroughly terms or concepts which comprise a theoretical \u201cstarting\npoint,\u201d on the basis of their meaning being completely definite\nand clear. For example, the concept of \u201cthe application of a\nconcept to another concept\u201d is a primitive term, along with\n\u201cforce\u201d. (Wang 1996, 9.1.29).\n\nHe spoke to Wang about the general project in 1972:\n\nPhenomenology is not the only approach. Another approach is to find a\nlist of the main categories (e.g., causation, substance, action) and\ntheir interrelations, which, however, are to be arrived at\nphenomenologically. The task must be done in the right manner. (Wang\n1996, 5.3.7).\n\n\nG\u00f6del spoke with Sue Toledo between 1972 and 1975 about the\nproject of finding primitive terms, as well as other aspects of\nphenomenology. See Toledo 2011. We discuss G\u00f6del\u2019s\ninvolvement with phenomenology further in the supplementary document\n G\u00f6del\u2019s Turn to Phenomenology.\n\nThe judgement levied upon G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism by\ncontemporary philosophers was a harsh one. (See for example G\u00f6del\n1995, pp. 303\u20134). Nevertheless G\u00f6del himself remained\noptimistic. As he commented to Wang:\n\nIt is not appropriate to say that philosophy as rigorous science is\nnot realizable in the foreseeable future. Time is not the main factor;\nit can happen anytime when the right idea appears. (Wang 1996,\n4.3.14).\n\n\nG\u00f6del concluded his 1944 on a similarly optimistic note.\n3.2 G\u00f6del\u2019s Realism\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s realist views were formulated mostly in the context\nof the foundations of mathematics and set theory.\n\nWe referred above the list \u201cWhat I believe,\u201d thought to\nhave been written in 1960 or thereabouts. Out of 14 items, only two\nrefer to realism, remarks 10 and 12:\n\nMaterialism is false.\n\n\nConcepts have an objective existence.\n\n\nG\u00f6del published his views on realism for the first time in his\n1944. The following is one of his most quoted passages on the\nsubject:\n\n\nClasses and concepts may, however, also be conceived as real objects,\nnamely classes as \u201cpluralities of things,\u201d or as\nstructures consisting of a plurality of things and concepts as the\nproperties and relations of things existing independently of our\ndefinitions and constructions.\n\nIt seems to me that the assumption of such objects is quite as\nlegitimate as the assumption of physical bodies and there is quite as\nmuch reason to believe in their existence. They are in the same sense\nnecessary to obtain a satisfactory system of mathematics as physical\nbodies are necessary for a satisfactory theory of our sense\nperceptions and in both cases it is impossible to interpret the\npropositions one wants to assert about these entities as propositions\nabout the \u201cdata,\u201d i.e., in the latter case the actually\noccurring sense perceptions.\n\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s reference to the impossibility of interpreting\nempirical laws, or more precisely, instantiations of them\u2014the\nstatements \u201cone wants to assert,\u201d\u2014as statements\nabout sense perceptions, is likely an endorsement of the (then)\ncontemporary critique of phenomenalism. The critique was based on the\nobservation that sense data are so inextricably bound up with the\nconditions under which they are experienced, that no correspondence\nbetween statements about those and the statements \u201cwe want to\nassert\u201d can be given (see Chisholm 1948 for example). More\ngenerally G\u00f6del was against verificationism, namely the idea that\nthe meaning of a statement is its mode of verification.\n\nThe analogical point in the first part of the passage was amplified by\nG\u00f6del in the draft manuscript \u201cIs Mathematics a Syntax of\nLanguage?\u201d:\n\nIt is arbitrary to consider \u201cThis is red\u201d an immediate\ndatum, but not so to consider the proposition expressing modus ponens\nor complete induction (or perhaps some simpler propositions from which\nthe latter follows). (G\u00f6del 1995, p. 359)\n\n\nSome writers have interpreted G\u00f6del in this and similar passages\npragmatically, attributing to him the view that because empirical\nstatements are paradigmatic of successful reference, reference in the\ncase of abstract concepts should be modelled causally. (See Maddy\n1990.) Interpreting reference to abstract objects this way,\nit is argued, addresses the main difficulty associated with realism,\nthe problem how we can come to have knowledge of abstract objects.\nOthers have argued that G\u00f6del had no paradigm case in mind; that\nfor him both the empirical and the abstract case are either equally\nproblematic, or equally unproblematic. (See Tait 1986.) The latter\nview is referred to as epistemological parity in van Atten and Kennedy\n2003. (See also Kennedy and van Atten 2004.)\n\nIn his 1947 \u201cWhat is Cantor\u2019s Continuum Problem?\u201d,\nG\u00f6del expounds the view that in the case of meaningful\npropositions of mathematics, there is always a fact of the matter to\nbe decided in a yes or no fashion. This is a direct consequence of\nrealism, for if there exists a domain of mathematical objects or\nconcepts, then any meaningful proposition concerning them must be\neither true or\n false.[23]\n The Continuum Hypothesis is G\u00f6del\u2019s example of a\nmeaningful question. The concept \u201chow many\u201d leads\n\u201cunambiguously\u201d to a definite meaning of the hypothesis,\nand therefore it should be decidable\u2014at least in principle. Most\nstrikingly G\u00f6del does not leave the matter there but goes on to\noffer a practical strategy for determining the value of the continuum,\nas well as the truth value of other axioms extending ZFC.\nSpecifically, he offers two criteria for their decidability: the first\ninvolves conceptual analysis and is associated with G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrationalistic program. (See the above section on G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrationalism.) Secondly one must keep an eye on the so-called success\nof the axiom, as a check or indicator of which direction to look to\nfor the solution of its truth. For example, G\u00f6del notes in the\npaper that none of the consequences of the Axiom of Constructibility\nare very plausible. It is, then, likely false. See Maddy 2011 and\nKoellner 2014 for discussion of intrinsic vs extrinsic justifications\nfor new axioms of set theory.\n\nFor further discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical views see\nthe supplementary documents:\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Turn to Phenomenology\n\n\nand\n\nA Philosophical Argument About the Content of Mathematics\n",
