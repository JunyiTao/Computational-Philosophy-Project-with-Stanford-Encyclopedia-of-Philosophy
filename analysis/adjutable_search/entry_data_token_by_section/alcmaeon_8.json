    "main_text": "Epistemology and Psychology || The Immortality of the Soul\n2.5 The Immortality of the Soul\n\nAlcmaeon developed the first argument for the immortality of the soul,\nbut the testimonia concerning it differ slightly from one another, and\nit appears to have been taken over and developed by Plato, so that it\nis very hard to determine exactly how to reconstruct Alcmaeon\u2019s\nown argument. Barnes (1982, 116\u2013120) and Hankinson (1998,\n30\u20133) provide the most insightful analysis. Alcmaeon appears to\nhave started from the assumption that the soul is always in motion. At\none extreme we might suppose that Alcmaeon only developed the simple\nargument from analogy, which Aristotle assigns to him (De An.\n405a29). The soul is like the heavenly bodies, which Alcmaeon regarded\nas divine and immortal (DK, A1, A12), in being always in motion, so it\nis also like them in being immortal. This is clearly fallacious, since\nit assumes that things that are alike in one respect will be alike in\nall others. The version in the doxographical tradition is more\nsophisticated (DK, A12). Alcmaeon thought that the soul moved itself\nin continual motion and was therefore immortal and like to the divine.\nThe similarity to the divine is not part of the inference here but\nsimply an illustrative comparison. However, Mansfeld has recently\npointed out that the doxographical report in Aetius is just a\nparaphrase of Aristotle\u2019s earlier report with the significant\naddition that the soul is self-moving. Examination of the context in\nAetius shows that the self-motion of the soul, which is attested\nindependently for Plato and Xenocrates, was projected back on\nPythagoras and Thales, who are very unlikely to have held such a view.\nThis context and Aristotle\u2019s failure to assign self-motion to\nAlcmaeon makes it likely that the same projection occurred in the case\nof Alcmaeon, who thus is likely to have assigned continual motion but\nnot self motion to the soul (Mansfeld 2014b, see also Laks 2018). The\ncore of the simpler argument is the necessary truth that what is\nalways in motion must be immortal. This is the assumption from which\nPlato starts his argument for the immortality of the soul\nat Phaedrus 245c, but how much of Plato\u2019s analysis of\nwhat is always in motion can be assigned to Alcmaeon? Plato makes no\nmention of Alcmaeon in the passage. There are still serious questions\nfor Alcmaeon, even on the more sophisticated version of the\nargument. We might well recognize that things with souls, i.e. things\nthat are alive, are able to move themselves, and conclude that it is\nsouls that bring this motion about. We might also conclude that the\nsoul, as what moves something else, must be in motion itself (the\nsynonymy principle of causation).  But why did Alcmaeon suppose that\nthe soul must be always in motion?  (Hankinson [1998, 32] provides two\npossible answers and discusses the difficulties with them.) Horn\nargues that there is no obvious meaning to the idea that the human\nsoul is in continual motion so that Alcmaeon must be talking about a\nworld soul, which has the continual motion of the heavens (2005,\n157\u20138). However, Mansfeld rightly argues that Aristotle\u2019s\nreport on Alcmaeon\u2019s view of the soul is clearly about the human\nsoul; since the soul being discussed is said to be similar to the\nheavenly motions it has to be distinct from them (2014a). Finally,\nwhat sort of motion is being ascribed to souls? The natural assumption\nmight be that the soul\u2019s motion is thinking, but, at this early\npoint in Greek thought, Alcmaeon was more likely to have thought that,\nif the soul is going to cause motion in space, it too must be in\nlocomotion. Plato describes the soul as composed of two circles with\ncontrary motions, which imitate the contrary motions of the fixed\nstars and the planets, so that the soul becomes a sort of orrery in\nthe head (Timaeus 44d). It has been suggested that this image\nis borrowed from Alcmaeon (Barnes 1982, 118; Skemp 1942, 36 ff.).\n\nIn Fragment 2, Alcmaeon is reported to have said that:\n\nHuman beings perish because they are not able to join their beginning\nto their end.\n\n\nAt first sight, this assertion might appear to conflict with\nAlcmaeon\u2019s belief that the soul is immortal. It seems likely,\nhowever, that Alcmaeon distinguished between human beings as\nindividual bodies, which do perish, and as souls, which do not (Barnes\n1982, 115). There is no evidence about what Alcmaeon thought happened\nto the soul, when the body perished, however. Did he believe in\nreincarnation as the Pythagoreans did? No ancient source associates\nAlcmaeon with reincarnation and his sharp distinction between animals\nand human beings may suggest that he did not believe in it (Guthrie\n1962: 354). He might have thought that the soul joined other divine\nbeings in the heavens. The point of Fragment 2 may be that, whereas\nthe heavenly bodies do join their beginnings to their ends in circular\nmotion, humans are not able to join their end in old age to their\nbeginning in childhood, i.e. human life does not have a cyclical\nstructure. We might even suppose that the soul tries to impose such a\nstructure on the body from its own circular motion but ultimately\nfails (Guthrie 1962, 353). It has been rather speculatively suggested\nthat, since Alcmaeon explains sleep and waking by the blood retreating\ninto the inner vessels and then expanding again into the outer vessels\n(see 3.2 below), it may be that this \u201ccircular motion\u201d of\nthe blood that fails in death (Kouloumentas 2018b).\n",
