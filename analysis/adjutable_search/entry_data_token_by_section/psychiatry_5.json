    "main_text": "Explanation || Levels of Explanation\n3.1 Levels of Explanation\n\n\nI begin with a picture that is familiar to philosophers of psychology,\nMarr\u2019s (1982, 24\u20135) distinction between three levels of\nexplanation in cognitive science. The highest specifies the\ncomputational task accomplished by the system of interest. It tells us\nwhat the goal of the system is, specified in terms of what it\ncomputes.  The middle level describes the actual representations and\nalgorithms that carry out the goal. The lowest level tells us how\nbrain tissue or other material substrate, such as the parts of a\nmachine, can implement the algorithm. Note that the\nlevels of description are different perspectives on the same\nmental process - Marr thinks of vision as the construction of a 3D representation from a 2D input, and the three levels are three different ways to understand that construction. Other cognitive phenomena can also be understood in these three ways. \n\n\nMarr sought to understand psychological capacities in the abstract\nwithout worrying about biology: although he certainly assumed that\ncapacities could be realised in a physical set up, he thought that the\ndetails of the particular set up would not make a difference to the way\nthe psychology was understood. But as the sciences of the mind have\nbecome more interested in the brain we are learning that this idea may\nneed to be amended. Cognitive neuroscience is learning to look for\nphysical structures in the brain that carry out information-processing\njobs, or what Glymour (1992) calls \u201ccognitive parts\u201d. Our\nunderstanding of biological realization feeds back into and constrains\nour understanding of the abstract processes of cognition (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993). Rather than relating abstract psychological\ncapacities to each other, higher level descriptions of the mind/brain\nin cognitive neuroscience relate capacities understood as functional\ndescriptions of fairly coarse-grained brain areas, not purely abstract\ncomputational task specifications. Theories of the normal system\nspecify the nature and interrelation of cognitive parts. Armed with\nthese assumptions about cognitive parts, psychiatrists can see a\ndisorder as a breakdown in normal functioning within and between\ncognitive parts. Marr\u2019s first level might seems to be useful as a\nsource of background theory for doing psychiatry, because it asks\n\u201cwhat is it for?\u201d and much of psychiatry is about finding\nout psychological systems fail to do what they are for.\n\n\nHowever, we still face the question of how psychological deficits\nare related to other levels of explanation, and here Marr\u2019s\npicture comes under real stress. Marr\u2019s three levels are\ndifferent representations of the same process. But in psychiatry\ndifferent levels typically represent distinct causal processes. For\nexample, the causes of many mental illnesses include a mix of genes and\nenvironmental factors, as in Meehl\u2019s example, cited above, of\ngenetics and bereavement conspiring to cause depression. The genes and\nenvironmental effects are different kinds of processes, not different\nlevels of one process. If we were dealing with one process,\ndescribable in different ways, then we could anticipate a reductive\naccount, in which higher-level variables are mapped on to lower-level\nones. But even though it is hard enough to imagine a molecular or\nneurological reduction of a psychological construct like humiliation\n(which, we saw above, is depressogenic), it is even harder to imagine a\nreductive analysis of socio-cultural factors like unemployment or\nchildhood sexual abuse. They have brain effects, but the brain effects\nvary across classes of individuals in ways that depend on other\nenvironmental and genetic contexts (see Kendler and Prescott 2006 for a\ncomprehensive review.)\n\n\nSchaffner (1993, 1994) suggests this structure is the norm\nthroughout biology, and sees it as relating causes and effects at\ndifferent levels of explanation. Appealing to levels of explanation is\nunobjectionable if it just involves a reminder that we need to relate\nvariables of many sorts. But it is not clear that we have any\nprincipled grounds for sorting phenomena into levels. Marr did, because\nhe imagined levels as descriptions of the same process (the\nconstruction of a 3D image from 2D retinal impacts) couched in the\nvocabularies of different sciences. But when we move outside the skull\nand begin introducing environmental factors and other kinds of cause,\nthe Marrian picture looks less plausible.\n\n\nAnother way in which levels talk has featured in recent philosophy\nof psychiatry is as a constraint on permissible kinds of explanation.\nChris Frith (1992, 26) for example, imagines what we would say if we\nfound a strong correlation between a spike in dopamine levels and\ndelusions of thought insertion (in which, for example, one has the\nexperience of another person\u2019s thoughts in one\u2019s own mind).\nHe argues that such a correlation is \u201csimply not\nadmissible\u201d as an explanation because we would remain in the dark\nabout why a sudden upsurge in dopamine causes thought insertion rather\nthan something else. To show why thought insertion comes about, Frith\nthinks, we need a cognitive story which shows us how it is caused by\nfailures of normal subpersonal processing.\n\n\nFrith\u2019s idea is that a causal explanation of a psychotic\nphenomenon, or some other mental symptom, must cite properly cognitive\nvariables to be explanatory. That is, explanations should relate\nvariables from the same level. The relationship between dopamine\nand thought is just opaque to reason, and we want variables that are\nrelated in ways that are transparent to reason. There is a constraint\nhere; the idea that explanations of psychological phenomena should\nrelate cause and effect in ways that we find intelligible. Campbell\n(2008) in attacking this picture, notes that talk of levels of\nexplanation is often wheeled in at this point, as it is by Frith, to\nsupply relations that are transparent to reason in the right way. The\nidea is that only processes at a level let us grasp explananda at that\nlevel. Explanantia at a different level are not intelligible in the\nright way, so although lower-level processes may realise the higher\nones they cannot explain them. This amounts to a constraint on\nacceptable explanation. Should we accept it?\n\nThe debate here quickly gets into technical arguments about the\nconcept of causation. Campbell argues against Frith in favour of the\nHumean idea that we simply cannot tell in advance of inquiry what\ncausal relations obtain in nature. Anything can cause anything and it\nis just as unwarranted to suppose that the relevant explanatory\nvariables for psychotic or affective phenomena must be cognitive as it\nis to adopt a simple reductionism and insist on their being\nbiological. Decades of research have revealed that mental illness is\ncaused by, and causes in turn, many different physical, psychological\nand social factors. We simply have to take our causal relations where\nwe find them, including interlevel ones. Craver and Bechtel (2007,\n554) on the other hand, argue that it stretches the concept of\ncausation to breaking point to admit interlevel causes: they say that\n\u201cto accept interlevel relationships as causal violates many of\nthe central ideas associated with the concept of\ncausation\u201d. Craver and Bechtel argue from the perspective of\nmechanistic explanation. Mechanisms explain effects in terms of\ninterlocking parts, and the relation across levels, they affirm, is\none of constitution, not causation; causation can only be\nintra-level. Interlevel causation, on this view, amounts to something\ncausing itself, because different levels are different ways of talking\nabout the same thing. However, talk of levels in psychiatry often\ninvolves relating different parts of the world, as in Meehl\u2019s example:\ngenetics and bereavement may be seen as requiring different levels,\nbut they are not different ways of describing the same process. Causal\nmodels must interrelate phenomena of very different types.\n\nIn part because of these issues, that levels in psychiatry are not\nMarrian, Campbell (2006) argues for an interventionist approach to\ncausation. This is the view that when we say X is a cause\nof Y we are saying that intervening on X is a way of\nintervening on Y (Woodward and Hitchcock 2003, Woodward 2003,\nPearl 2000): manipulating one variable makes a difference to\nanother. This is not a reductive analysis of causation, since it makes\nuse of causal ideas\u2014it just states that questions about\nwhether X causes Y are questions about what would\nhappen to Y if there were an intervention\non X. Kendler and Campbell (2009) have argued that an\ninterventionist model provides a rigorous way of articulating the idea\nthat any combination of variables might characterize the causes of a\ndisorder, whilst at the same time providing a clear test of what\nvariables are actually involved, thus avoiding a simple-minded holism\nthat just says that lots of things are relevant. They further note\n(2009, 997) that interventionism \u201cpermits the clear separation\nof causal effects from the mechanistic instantiations of those\neffects\u201d, thus directly confuting the approach favored by\nBechtel and Craver.\n\n\nAppealing to levels of explanation in psychiatry, then, might just\nbe a reminder that we need to relate variables of many sorts in\nexplaining the causes of disorder. But it may also be connected with\nparticular perspectives on reduction, explanation and causation. We\nwon\u2019t go into these debates here; rather, we will move on to\ndiscuss a further problem. As well as great diversity in causal\nfactors, psychiatry also confronts the problem of diverse symptoms;\nmany mental illnesses take a different form in different people.\nAlthough two people might both be diagnosed with major depression, they\nneed share few symptoms. Both are very likely to feel miserable and\nlose interest in activities they normally enjoy. However, one might\nlose weight, sleep less and becomes physically agitated while the other\nsleeps more and becomes lethargic and tormented by feelings of guilt\nand thought of suicide. The philosophical problem arises from the\nconfrontation between the great variation in clinical reality and the\nneed to simplify in order to render that reality scientifically\ntractable. In summary form, the problem is; what are we trying to\nexplain when we explain a mental illness? Is it a diverse set of\nreal-world phenomena, or some simplified representation of those\nphenomena?\n",
