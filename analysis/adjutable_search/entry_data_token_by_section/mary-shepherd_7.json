    "main_text": "Mind, body, and self || Minds and bodies\n4.1 Minds and bodies\n\nMind is the capacity for sensation in general, that is, the capacity\nfor thought and feeling. We ourselves are individual minds (EPEU\n[2020: 14, 24]). Many of Shepherd\u2019s predecessors hold that the\npotentiality of causal capacities is ultimately grounded in substances\nin which the capacities inhere. Shepherd rarely uses the term\n\u201csubstance\u201d (but see EPEU [2020: 388]; ERCE [2000: 162)\nbut she ascribes a substance-like property to minds. This is the\nupshot of two arguments based on the idea that the mind is a dual\ncapacity, for both particular sensations, which continuously vanish\nand are followed by others, and for sensation as such, which is\nresumed after periods of dreamless sleep. The argument comes down to\nthis: there would be no reason for the existence of sensation unless\nthere were a continuous being that is specifically \u201cindifferent\nto sensations [and] capable of being excited when interfered with by\nqualities fitted to produce it.\u2014Such a being is the subject of\nsuccessive sensations,\u2014such is the capacity for\nsensation,\u2014such is the mind\u201d (EPEU [2020: 375\u20136;\nalso 56\u20137]). A mind endures\u2014it is one subject of different\nsuccessive states each dependent for existence on it. But unlike a\ntraditional substance, its successive states are effects rather than\npowers; it is a dispositional rather than categorical entity; and a\nmind is external to each of its states and can exist with no states at\nall. \u201cThus the pronoun I is ever abstract and stands\nfor a BEING exterior to, and independent of all the changes of which\nit is conscious.\u201d (EPEU [2020: 57]). This seems to show Shepherd\nhas no use for traditional substances (see LoLordo (forthcoming); but\nBoyle 2020: 101, note 19; 104) finds that minds inhere in natures in\nthe substance theoretical sense.).\n\nThe conclusion that a mind is the continually existing subject of\nsuccessive states proves its eternality. It seems the \u201cmysterious\neternal power of feeling\u201d is inherited by each individual member\nof a species: \u201cas a continuous existence it must be an eternal\npower in nature and as immortal for the future as it must have been\nwithout beginning in the past\u201d (EPEU [2020: 377]). This is\nmotivated by an implicit appeal to CP: \u201cthere would be no\nreason\u201d, i.e. cause, for sensations if there were no continuing\nsubject matter ready to be interfered with by other suitable objects\n(EPEU [2020: 375\u20136]), partly quoted in the previous paragraph;\n[2020: 56\u20137]). More generally, it is a principle of\nShepherd\u2019s metaphysics that capacities for being are eternal\n(EPEU [2020: 389\u2013390]). Matter and time are eternal capacities\n(EPEU [2020: 127, 389\u2013390]). The consequences of this principle for\nthe causal structure of the universe have not, to my knowledge, been\ndiscussed in the literature. Shepherd uses the principle in stating\nher argument for the existence of God (EPEU [2020: 389\u2013392; also\n190\u2013191]). This argument, which includes a version of the teleological\nargument used to show there must be an eternal entity with mental\npowers, purports to show that God is the continuously existing subject\nof all changes (Loscano (2019) offers an account). The details of the\ndependence relation between the infinite subject of all changes and\nthe objects that begin and cease to exist in nature are of\nconsiderable interest. LoLordo (forthcoming) brings out similarities\nto Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics; Garrett (forthcoming) considers it in\nconnection with the question whether Shepherd is able to reconcile her\ndenial of idealism with the causality of God, but finds the texts\ninconclusive.\n\nShepherd argues that minds are not material beings on the evidence\nthat bodies in general do not feel in circumstances in which\nindividual minds do, e.g. a rock does not feel pain when it breaks.\nAccording to Shepherd: \u201cthe definition of matter is the\ncapacity of exhibiting upon a sentient nature, the sense of solid\nEXTENSION in general\u201d, and \u201cthat of mind, a capacity\nfitted to be excited to any sensation in particular\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: 242]). To be clear, solid extension is a sensation; its name is\ngiven also to the unknown powers of external objects that partly cause\nit (Shepherd (1832); EPEU [2020, 697]). Accordingly, matter is also\ndefined as the capacity for unperceived motion (EPEU [2020: 14\u201316]).\nOn Shepherd\u2019s theory, mind and matter do not have mutually\nincompatible absolute essences, as Descartes maintains; their absolute\n\u201creal essences\u201d are unknown (EPEU [2020: 242\u2013244]).\nNor is mind-body causal interaction a problem. If a mind and organized\nmatter form a union, each capacity realizes the other; a human being\nhas powers to feel, think, move and resist motion just as other kinds\nof objects are defined by a number of different powers (EPEU [2020:\n310\u2013311]). Within a human being, Shepherd explains, a conscious\nsensation of forming a plan and deciding to carry it out is united\nwith all the powers that co-exist with it, so the bodily part of the\nhuman being starts a motion which is guided by the conscious decision;\nthe cause of this motion must satisfy CSP, but the efficient cause of\nan effect is always unknown on her theory (EPEU [2020:\n403\u2013405]). See LoLordo (forthcoming) for further comparison of\nthis theory and mind-body substance dualism.)\n",
