    "main_text": "Twentieth Century || Music, Language, and Culture: Wittgenstein\n2.2 Music, Language, and Culture: Wittgenstein\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951), possibly the most influential\nphilosopher of the twentieth century, was a musically talented\nindividual. He played the clarinet and had extensive knowledge of the\nGerman classical repertoire.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophical development is normally divided\ninto two periods. The earlier one revolves around his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (1921), in which Wittgenstein claims that\nlanguage is only meaningful when it describes contingent states of\naffairs. The propositions of logic, philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics\nare thus strictly speaking meaningless, in that they are normative or\notherwise non-factual. In these early works, Wittgenstein is\npredictably almost entirely silent about art. Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlate philosophical views found expression in the posthumously\npublished Philosophical Investigations (1953), as well as\nother writings. In these works, Wittgenstein conceives of linguistic\nmeaning as dependent on the way words are used within particular\nsituations or activities\u2014this he terms a\n\u201clanguage-game\u201d (Sprachspiel). Language-games are\ncountless and defy systematization, because they depend on the\nconstantly changing practices that constitute our form of life\n(Lebensform).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s late philosophy contains significant, if\ncharacteristically unsystematic, treatments of aesthetic issues, in\nwhich music figures prominently. In an interesting reversal of the\nusual strategy, Wittgenstein sometimes uses analogies with music to\nshed light on the workings of language. The most famous instance of\nthis is the remark:\n\n\nUnderstanding a sentence is much more akin to understanding a theme in\nmusic than one may think. What I mean is that understanding a sentence\nlies nearer than one thinks to what is ordinarily called understanding\na musical theme. (Philosophical Investigations,\n\u00a7527)\n\n\nHere Wittgenstein is using an analogy between language and music in\nthe attempt to move away from a conception of linguistic understanding\nas an inner process (see Lewis 1977 and Worth 1997). In both language\nand music, as in art more generally, understanding is manifested in\nour ability to act in appropriate ways. For example, a criterion for\nthe understanding of genre pictures could be the ability to describe\nor mime the actions that occur in them (Philosophical\nGrammar, III, 37). In the musical case, an obvious reaction that\nevinces understanding is the ability to competently describe or\nperform the music. More interestingly, Wittgenstein holds that the\nunderstanding of music is also manifested in our capacity to draw\nappropriate comparisons between music and extra-musical reality,\nparticularly the linguistic domain\u2014a musical phrase may be\ndescribed as a question, or remind us of the intonation we use when we\nutter a certain sentence (Philosophical Investigations,\n\u00a7527; Zettel, \u00a7175; for discussion, see Budd 2008,\n263\u201367).\n\nThe role of extra-musical references in the understanding of music\nraises the issue of whether Wittgenstein should be considered a\nformalist (see Ahonen 2005, and Szabados 2006; 2014). A decidedly\nformalist element in Wittgenstein\u2019s aesthetics is his separation\nof the understanding and appreciation of music from the effect it has\non us\u2014the move is similar to Hanslick\u2019s (see\n \u00a71.6;\n on Wittgenstein and Hanslick, see Szabados 2014, 39\u201357;\n94\u201397). Aesthetic value in general, and music\u2019s value more\nspecifically, is not reducible to an object\u2019s effect\n(Lectures on Aesthetics, IV, 2). Thus, an artwork is not\nvaluable because it conveys this or that emotion, but because it\nconveys itself (Wittgenstein 1977 [1998: 67]).\n\nHowever, the late Wittgenstein\u2019s view of musical understanding\ndoes not seem fully compatible with a formalist view (see Szabados\n2014: chapter 4). This is partly suggested by his comments on the\nappropriateness of extra-musical comparisons. A musical theme,\nWittgenstein observes,\n\n\nmakes an impression on me which is connected with things in its\nsurroundings\u2014e.g. with our language and its intonations; and\nhence with the whole field of our language-games. (Zettel,\n\u00a7135)\n\n\nMuch like the understanding and mastery of language presupposes its\ncompetent use in countless situations and activities, the\nunderstanding of music depends on our ability to use it and describe\nit appropriately in ways that are ultimately determined by our form of\nlife (see Hagberg 2017).\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that Wittgenstein\u2019s main\ncontribution to the philosophy of music is probably something he\nalmost never relates to music. This is the concept of aspect\nperception, exemplified by Joseph Jastrow\u2019s famous duck-rabbit\nambiguous figure, but also replicable in the auditory\ndomain\u2014e.g., hearing the metronome\u2019s ticking as groupings\nof two or three. Contemporary philosophers of music have appealed in\nvarious ways to aspect perception, to shed light on issues that range\nfrom musical understanding to the phenomenology of musical\nexpressiveness (see for instance Kivy 1989 and Arbo 2009; Guter 2020\nobserves that Wittgenstein\u2019s interest in aspect perception was\nlikely spurred by empirical studies on musical rhythm he made as a\nstudent).\n",
