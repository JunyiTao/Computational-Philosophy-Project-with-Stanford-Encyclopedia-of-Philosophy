    "main_text": "Why Think There is Grounding? || Arguments from theoretical utility\n3.1 Arguments from theoretical utility\n\nThat grounding figures in ordinary and philosophical thinking (and\nperhaps other domains as well) and that many grounding claims are\nfairly easy to evaluate (e.g., [Beijing exists] grounds\n[{Beijing} exists]) gives us defeasible reason to\nthink that there is grounding (deRosset 2020). What else can be said\non behalf of grounding? Proponents of grounding tend to think that\nit\u2019s a justified posit on the basis of its theoretical utility.\nIn this section we set out three theoretical utility arguments for\ngrounding that involve unity, explanation, and the direction of\npriority.\n\nThe unity argument says that grounding is a justified posit\nbecause of its unifying role (Audi 2012a; Rosen 2010; Schaffer 2009).\nOn one way of casting the argument, it has three premises. First,\nthere is substantial unity among the metaphysical relations (relations\nfamiliar from metaphysics such as functional realization and set\nformation that resist analysis in purely modal terms). Second, where\nthere is substantial unity, plausibly there is a unifier, something\nthat explains why the relations in question resemble one another in\nthe manner they do. Third, if there is a unifier for the metaphysical\nrelations, the best candidate is grounding.\n\nThe explanation argument says that grounding is a justified\nposit because of its explanatory role (Audi 2012a; Dasgupta 2014a;\nFine 2012a; Litland 2017; Schaffer 2016a). Recalling the distinction\nbetween unionism and separatism (see\n \u00a71.1),\n the argument proceeds differently depending on which view is in play\n(Kovacs 2017). Given separatism (grounding is\ndeterminationG), one way to cast the explanation\nargument is as follows: there is a form of explanation\u2014what we\ncan call ontic explanation\u2014such that explanations of\nthis form are backed by worldly relations; and, among the ontic\nexplanations are ones such that the best candidate for the relation\nthat plays the backing role is determinationG.\nGiven unionism (grounding is explanationG), one\nway to cast the argument is as follows: there is a form of\nexplanation, what we can call metaphysical explanation, such\nthat the connections in metaphysical explanations are best expressed\nin terms of explanationG.\n\nThe priority argument says that grounding is a justified\nposit because of its direction-fixing role\u2014it fixes the\ndirection of priority between facts, where one fact is prior to\nanother only if the former is more fundamental than the latter. (See\n \u00a74.3\n for further discussion of fundamentality; J. Wilson (2014) initially\nproposes the priority argument but rejects it\u2014more on this\nbelow.) Let a priority case be one in which some fact is\nprior to another and entities these facts concern are yoked by\nmetaphysical relations. One way to cast the priority argument is as\nfollows: there are priority cases in which the direction of\nmetaphysical relations doesn\u2019t determine which fact is prior to\nthe other; and the best candidate for that which fixes the direction\nof priority in such cases is grounding.\n\nWe can cast arguments for grounding in terms of theoretical roles in\naddition to those specified by the unity, explanation, and priority\narguments as well. Some, for example, claim that the thesis of\nphysicalism (roughly, the view that the world is ultimately\nphysical in nature) is usefully formulated in terms of grounding\n(Block 2015; Dasgupta 2014a; Schaffer 2017b). With respect to\nphysicalism about the mental in particular (roughly, the view\nthat mental phenomena are nothing over and above physical phenomena),\na simple grounding-theoretic formulation of the view is this: the\nmental facts are grounded by (non-mental) physical facts (perhaps\ntogether with other non-mental facts such as indexical and totality\nfacts). It\u2019s by now a familiar idea that purely modal\nformulations of physicalism are inadequate, as there are coherent\nversions of dualism that such formulations don\u2019t rule out\n(Horgan 1993, 2006). Hence, one point in favor of appealing to\ngrounding in this context is that grounding isn\u2019t a purely modal\nnotion. And Block (2015) argues that even physicalism formulated in\nterms of a priori entailment faces the same problem, pointing to a\nparticular grounding formulation of physicalism as the way to resolve\nthe issue.\n\nAs for further potential theoretical applications, some have proposed\ngrounding-theoretic accounts of:\n\nthe nature of properties (Audi 2016; Carmichael 2016);\nthe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic\nproperties\u2014roughly, properties that something has just in virtue\nof how that thing is (e.g., being made of tin) vs. properties\nsomething has because of how it's related to wholly distinct\nthings (e.g., being next to a tin cup) (Rosen 2010; Witmer et al\n2005);\nwhat it is for an object (e.g., Socrates) in contrast to a word\n(e.g., \u2018Socrates\u2019) to have a definition (Rosen 2015);\nwhat it is for one claim to reduce to another (Fine 2001)\nwhat it is for the world to be stratified into levels (Rabin 2018;\nSchaffer 2012);\nhow moral facts (e.g., facts about what we\u2019re morally\nobligated to do) are related to natural facts (e.g., facts concerning\nwhat maximizes utility) (Rosen 2017);\nthe special explanatory gap between the experiential and physical\ntruths (Rabin 2019; Trogdon forthcoming);\nwhat it is for the existence of certain entities to depend on the\nexistence of others (Schnieder 2020);\nwhat it is for truths to be such that things in the world make\nthem true (Correia 2014; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005; Schnieder 2006);\nwhat it is for one theory to be more parsimonious than another\n(Schaffer 2013);\nthe nature of free will and moral responsibility (Sartorio\n2013);\nwhat it is for something (e.g., gender) to be a social\nconstruction (Griffith 2018; Schaffer 2017a);\nthe historically important view that everything has an explanation\n(Amijee 2020a; Dasgupta 2016; K. McDaniel 2019; Schnieder &\nSteinberg 2015);\nhow multiple objects can exist at the same place and time (Saenz\n2015);\nthe view that only present things exist (Baron 2014);\nthe relation between being F (e.g., being blue)\nand having the property F-ness (e.g., having\nblueness) (Dixon 2018);\nhow mental events (e.g., pain) can cause physical events (e.g.,\nwincing) given that such physical events have physical causes (e.g.,\nC-fiber firing) (Clark & Wildman 2018; Kroedel & Schulz 2016);\nStenwall 2021; Tiehen 2015).\n\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list\u2014there is something of a\ncottage industry of developing grounding-theoretic accounts of items\nof philosophical interest.\n",
