    "main_text": "Motion || Motion and the Categories\n3.3 Motion and the Categories\n3.3.1 The Genus and Species of Motion\n\nAvicenna dedicates two chapters of the Physics of The\nCure (2.2 & 2.3) to motion\u2019s relation to the\ncategories: one to motion\u2019s genus and the other to the species\nof motion. As for the first issue, Avicenna attempts to identify to\nwhich category motion generically belongs inasmuch as the categories\nsupposedly provided the most generic ways that (material) things might\nexist. While in the end he concedes that given the canonical ten\ncategories, motion seems most aptly to fall under passion (Gk.\npaskhein; Ar. infi\u02bf\u0101l), he is also\nuncertain whether Aristotle\u2019s ten categories are truly\nexhaustive and at least suggests that motion might be sui\ngeneris (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.2 [8]; Hasnawi 2004; and McGinnis\n2006a).\n\nAs for the species of motion (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.3), Aristotle and the\ntradition up to Avicenna had recognized only three specific kinds of\nmotion. These include motion with respect to the categories of\nquantity, quality and place. Motion with respect to quantity involves\naugmentation and diminution, while motion with respect to quality\nincludes such changes as alterations in color, temperature and the\nlike. Finally, on the traditional categorization, there is change of\nplace, that is, locomotion, which for a number of reasons was believed\nto be the most significant or even primary species of motion. Avicenna\naccepts all three kinds of motion identified by the tradition. He\nadditionally adds to these three, motion with respect to the category\nof position, that is, the rotation of an object that remains in the\nsame place, like a spinning orb. The reason for his addition is\nobvious on consideration; for clearly an orb spinning in place is not\nchanging its quantity or quality and by supposition it is remaining in\nthe same place, yet clearly it is moving. Thus what kind of change is\nit undergoing? Only the relative position of its parts, claims\nAvicenna, is changing, and thus he concludes rotating objects must be\nchanging with respect to the category of position.\n3.3.2 An Analysis of Positional Motion\n\nThe introduction of positional motion, however, brings with it a new\nchallenge. According to Avicenna, motion always involves a\nterminus a quo, that is, a \u201cfrom which,\u201d\n(m\u0101 minhu) and a terminus ad quem, that is, a\n\u201cto which\u201d (m\u0101 ilayhi) (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1\n[12 & 20\u201322]). His reason for insisting on this point is\nthat motion, as noted, is the actuality of potential as potential,\nwhere the initial state of potentiality corresponds with the\nterminus a quo and the final state of actuality corresponds\nwith the terminus ad quem. The difficulty is that there need\nbe no starting and ending point for rotation, particularly if, as\nAvicenna believes, the rotation of the heavens has neither beginning\nnor end. Avicenna\u2019s response to this challenge involves a\nsophisticated analysis of the various ways of understanding actuality\nand potentiality (including an appeal to the first and second\nactuality already noted but also introducing a notion of remote and\nproximate potentiality). Without going into the details, the general\nintuition of his response is simple enough (for a detailed account see\nMcGinnis 2006b). As a matter of supposition, one can posit within the\ncontinuous rotational motion of, say, a celestial sphere some point,\nfor example, the sun\u2019s position when it is directly overhead. In\npositing that point, one by supposition indicates an initial\nterminus a quo of the motion, but that same point also\nindicates a terminus ad quem for that motion (although the\ntwo termini are in a sense also different since there is a difference\nin time between the two instances of being at that point). Thus, for\nexample in our case, a complete sidereal day is actualized when the\nsun moves from a position directly overhead\u2014the terminus a\nquo\u2014and then returns to that position\u2014the\nterminus ad quem. Of course, nothing about this analysis\nrequires that the rotation must cease once this sort of terminus\nad quem, which is a proximate potency, has been actualized.\nIndeed it can be posited as a new terminus a quo for a new\nrotation. In short, rotational motion still has a terminus a\nquo and a terminus ad quem corresponding with a\npotentiality and actuality, even though such motion need have no\nabsolute beginning or ending point.\n\nAn added benefit of Avicenna\u2019s introduction of this new species\nof motion is that it provides him an easy answer to what has been\ncalled \u201cla grande question\u201d of ancient celestial physics\n(Hasnawi 1984). As a bit of background to the problem, Aristotle\ndefined a thing\u2019s \u201cwhere,\u201d or place, with the\noutermost containing limit of the surrounding body (Aristotle,\nPhysics, 4.4, 212a20) and Avicenna followed Aristotle\nfaithfully on this point (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.9 [1\u20133]; Lammer\n2018, \u00a7\u00a75.1\u20132). Thus, only a body that has a body\noutside of it and containing it can have a place. Consequently the\noutermost celestial sphere \u201cbeyond\u201d which there is\nabsolutely nothing, by definition cannot have a place. The problem,\nthen, is this: We observe the outermost celestial sphere apparently\nmaking a complete rotation once approximately every twenty-four hours,\nbut what specific sort of motion is the outermost celestial sphere\nundergoing? Aristotle and the earlier tradition had identified only\nthree species of motion: motion with respect to quantity, quality and\nplace. Clearly the motion of the heavens is neither a change in\nquantity nor a change in quality, but it is also not a change of\nplace, since, as we have seen, the outermost celestial sphere has no\nplace. Avicenna\u2019s introduction of positional motion provides an\nobvious solution: the outermost celestial sphere is moving with\nrespect to the category of position. Moreover, Avicenna\u2019s\nsolution is not ad hoc, since he has integrated his account of\npositional motion into his general analysis of motion and\nmotion\u2019s relation to the categories.\n4. Conditions for Motion\n\nAgain physics is the study of bodies insofar as they are subject to\nmotion. We have just seen Avicenna\u2019s account of motion and\nbefore that considered his views about bodies and magnitude more\ngenerally. A discussion of Avicenna\u2019s treatment of certain\nnecessary conditions associated with motion and moving bodies is now\nin order. These necessary conditions are, one, how to identify the\nplace of a body and, two, the time required for motion.\n4.1 Place and Void\n\nAn account of place is particularly significant given that motion with\nrespect to place was frequently viewed as the primary species of\nmotion (although Avicenna would rank positional motion along side\nlocal motion, if not above it). The reason for giving priority to\nplace or position is that change in quantity involves the increase or\ndecrease of the place that a body occupies; and change in\nquality involves a body\u2019s coming into proximity with some cause\nthat brings about the alteration, where \u201ccoming into\nproximity\u201d refers to a change of place either in the\nbody or in the cause (Avicenna, [Ph], 4.9).\n\nAs noted when discussing positional motion, Avicenna follows the\nAristotelian tradition and identifies the technical definition of\nplace (Gk. topos, Ar. mak\u0101n) with \u201cthe\nsurface that is the extremity of the containing body\u201d (Avicenna,\n[Ph], 2.9 [1]). The general structure of his argumentation for this\nthesis involves showing that all other candidates for what place might\nbe are wanting in some way. To this end, Avicenna provides us with, as\nit were, the logical space for an account of place (Avicenna, [Ph],\n2.6 [2]). Place can be either intrinsic or extrinsic to body, that is,\nessential or accidental to it. If place is intrinsic to a body, then\nit is either (1) the matter or (2) the form of the body, whereas if it\nis extrinsic, then the place is either (3) what the body exactly\nencompasses, that is, an interval (bu\u02bfd) or (4) what\nexactly encompasses the body, that is, the surface that is the\nextremity of the containing\n body.[10]\n Avicenna quickly eliminates (1) and (2). That is because a body can\nchange with respect to place, that is, depart from one place to\nanother, whereas a body cannot depart from either its matter or form\nwithout undergoing generation and corruption. Hence only (3) and (4)\nare truly live options. Account (4) is just the Aristotelian one,\nwhich Avicenna himself prefers. As for (3), namely that a body\u2019s\nplace is the interval it occupies, Avicenna believes that it\nultimately stands or falls with whether a void\n(khal\u0101\u02be), an empty interval, is possible. Avicenna\ndedicates a long chapter (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.8) to showing that a void\nis impossible. If his argument there is successful, then (4), namely,\nplace is the innermost limit of the containing body, remains the only\nviable definition of place.\n\nAristotle before Avicenna had also dedicated a long section of his\nPhysics (4.6\u20139) to a refutation of the void.\nAristotle\u2019s arguments might all best be described as physical\nones inasmuch as they all appeal to physical concerns associated with\nthe void. More specifically, Aristotle\u2019s arguments attempt to\nshow that motion would be impossible on the assumption of a void.\nAvicenna reproduces many of Aristotle\u2019s physical arguments,\noften giving them his own unique twist. Additionally, however,\nAvicenna develops what might be called a conceptual critique of the\nnotion of void. In this critique, Avicenna attempts to show that the\nvery idea of a void is conceptually vacuous or a vain intelligible.\nThe criticism begins with a logical/physical principle: Anything that\nactually exists within the natural order can be defined in terms of a\ngenus and difference. (The general idea is that the things that make\nup the physical world must be of some kind or species if they exist at\nall, and it is the genus and difference that identify the kind or\nspecies.) He then adds one further qualification: Inasmuch as these\nactual existents positively make up the world around us, their genus\nand difference must refer to positive (as opposed to negative)\nnotions; a species properly understood answers the question\n\u201cwhat is it?\u201d and a genus or difference given in\nnegative terms simply would not tell us what something is,\nbut what it is not. (For a discussion of Avicenna\u2019s\ntheory of genus and difference and how it relates to his criticism of\nthe void see McGinnis 2007b.)\n\nWith these preliminaries in place, Avicenna\u2019s conceptual\ncritique begins (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.8 [1\u20134]; also see McGinnis\n2007a, 2007b; and Lammer 2018, \u00a75.3). He first asks whether the\nvoid actually exists or is absolutely nothing. If one says that the\nvoid is absolutely nothing, Avicenna happily agrees; for if it is\nabsolutely nothing, then it does not actually exist. Those who affirm\nthat the void actually exists, then, cannot simply say that it is\nnothing, but must provide some positive features about it. Avicenna\nnext notes that void space is frequently described as being of either\na greater or lesser extent, for the void space between two cities on\nEarth, for example, is less than the void space between the Earth and\nthe heavens. This property of being more or less is none other than\nthat of quantity. Thus if a void should exist, it would possess some\nquantity either essentially or accidentally. If quantity belongs to\nvoid accidentally, and every accident must belong to a substance, then\nvoid is joined to a substance possessing quantity. The quantity in\nquestion is necessarily three-dimensional, but as noted when\ndiscussing continuity, three-dimensionality follows upon the form of\ncorporeality. The form of corporeality, however, causes the existence\nof a body. Thus void would belong to a body as an accidental feature\nof it, a seeming contradiction.\n\nIn contrast, if the quantity is not accidental to the void but is\nessential to it, then void would be a species of quantity. Avicenna\nnow challenges the defenders of void to provide some positive\ndifference that would make up void\u2019s species. It cannot be that\nvoid is a material quantity, since again a material quantity is body.\nIf one claims that void is immaterial quantity, Avicenna demands some\nnon-negative difference, for while there are immaterial substances,\nlike angels, one can provide a positive characterization of them as\nintellectual substances. Avicenna offers a number of\nsuggestions, but finds every attempt wanting or ultimately telling us\nwhat void is not rather than what it is. Since no definition of void\ncan be given in terms of a positive genus and difference, Avicenna\nconcludes that our idea of void is nothing but empty imaginings.\n\nAgain, place had to be either (1) the matter or (2) the form of the\nbody, or either (3) what the body exactly encompasses or (4) what\nexactly encompasses the body (i.e., the surface that is the innermost\nextremity of the containing body). As noted (1) and (2) are\nnon-starters, and as just argued, (3) involves a conceptual confusion.\nConsequently, Avicenna concludes place must be the innermost surface\nof the surrounding body.\n4.2 Time and the Age of the Universe\n\nAmong the conditions associated with motion, time (Gk.\nchronos, Ar. zam\u0101n) is at least as important as\nthat of place and void, for it is a necessary concomitant of motion.\n(A number of studies on various aspects of Avicenna\u2019s temporal\ntheory exist and include Shayegan 1986; McGinnis 1999; Mayer 2007; and\nLammer 2018, ch. 6.) In order to appreciate time\u2019s relation to\nmotion, there is a more basic question that must be answered first:\nDoes time exist? An affirmative answer will seem obvious to many, but\nAristotle at Physics, 4.10 had offered a series of\nobjections, four in all, that cast doubt on the reality of time.\nMoreover, in his own positive account of what time is, Aristotle does\nnot address all of the objections or even provide a general proof that\ntime must exist in light of the objections. One may then criticize\nAristotle\u2019s account of time in light of his own theory of\nscience: Aristotle has proceeded to a theory of what time is\nbefore providing us with a proof that time\n is.[11]\n\nAfter presenting the objections to and opinions about time, Avicenna\nbegins his own account of time (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.10\u201313) by\nfilling this lacuna in Aristotle\u2019s presentation.\nAvicenna\u2019s general strategy is to take as empirically obvious\ncertain facts about motion and then show that these facts cannot be\nexplained unless there is associated with motion a certain magnitude,\nwhich we commonly identify with time. Only having shown that time\nexists does Avicenna then provide a scientifically adequate\nexplanation of what time essentially is.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s\n proof that time exists assumes these initial facts about moving\nbodies:\n\nIf two moving bodies, which have the same speed, start and stop on\nthe same mark (say a blast of a horn), then they traverse the same\ndistance;\nIf two moving bodies, which again have the same speed, both stop\non the same mark, but start on two different marks, the body that\nstarted on the second mark traverses less distance than the body that\nstarted on the first mark;\nIf two moving bodies, which now have different speeds, start and\nstop on the same mark, then the slower moving body traverses less\ndistance than the faster moving body.\n\n\nOn the basis of these facts, Avicenna observes that associated with\nmoving bodies there is a certain possibility or capacity\n(imk\u0101n) to traverse some spatial magnitude. Moreover,\nthis capacity corresponds with the starting and stopping of the motion\n(that is, a kinematic magnitude). When the body is moving slower, a\ngreater amount of this possibility is required to cover the same\nspatial magnitude as that of a faster moving body. Given this\npossibility\u2019s relation and correspondence with both spatial and\nkinematic magnitudes, Avicenna concludes that this capacity must be\nsome magnitude that stands in some relation to the distance and speed.\nThis magnitude is neither the magnitude of the body, whether the\nbody\u2019s bulk or weight, nor the magnitude of the motion, whether\nthe speed or motivity, nor the magnitude of the distance traversed.\nInstead, this magnitude\u2014again, the possibility belonging to a\nmoving body to cover more or less distance at a fixed\nspeed\u2014concludes Avicenna, is what we call time\n(zam\u0101n).\n\nWhile identifying time with a certain possibility to traverse some\nspatial magnitude, provides one with a criterion for recognizing time,\nit does not provide a proper scientific definition of what time\nessentially is, that is, a definition in terms of genus and\ndifference. Thus, having shown that time exists, Avicenna next turns\nto defining time and showing what time essentially is. In general,\nAvicenna follows Aristotle and defines time as a \u201cnumber of\nmotion when it is differentiated into prior and posterior parts\u201d\n(cf. Aristotle, Physics 4.1, 219b1\u20132). Time\u2019s\ngenus, then, is a certain number, that is, some measurable aspect or\nmagnitude, belonging to motion. Its difference is having essentially\nprior and posterior elements. Here is it important to note that for\nAvicenna, priority and posterity (taqaddum and\nta\u02beakhkhur) are generic notions, with a number of\ndifferent species, like priority in eminence or location or time. For\nAvicenna, the prior and posterior in Aristotle\u2019s definition\nrefers to what is prior and posterior in the distance traversed as\ndetermined by the directedness of the motion over that distance. Thus,\nthe charges of some, particularly Galen, that Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of time is circular, since it appeals to purportedly\ntemporal notions of before and after, is avoided. (See Lammer 2018,\nch. 6.2).\n\nIn all three of Avicenna\u2019s philosophical\nencyclopedias\u2014The Cure, The Salvation and Pointers\nand Reminders\u2014he notes that, more precisely, time is a\nmagnitude of circular motion with respect to the prior and\nposterior. His insistence on circular motion rather than just motion\nin general is that only circular motion can potentially have neither\nbeginning nor end. In other words, only circular motion can be\ninfinitely extended into the past and future.\n\nWhile Avicenna has any number of arguments for the eternity of time\nand the world, his proof for the existence of time in terms of a\npossibility to traverse greater or lesser spatial magnitudes at a\nfixed velocity provides the basis for one of his central physical\narguments for that thesis. The argument, which is a reductio ad\nabsurdum has one assume that God created time, and so motion and\nmoving bodies, at some first moment, x, in the finite past,\nfor example, 10,000 years ago. Prior to x nothing but God\nexisted, not even time. (Here let years be measured in solar rotations\nas measured by the apparent motion of our sun. Also allow that the\npresent moment marks the completion of the 10,000 solar rotations, so\nthat right now is the second terminal point for this motion.) Avicenna\nnext observes that it is certainly possible that God could have made a\ntime, and so motion and moving bodies, 20,000 solar rotations in\nduration, where this possible duration again reaches to the present\nmoment as its second terminal point. In this second scenario, 10,000\nyears of the full 20,000 year duration would exactly correspond with\nthe 10,000 years in the first scenario, namely, the period extending\nfrom the present moment back to x. The remaining duration of\nthis possible 20,000-year motion would correspond with the possibility\nfor 10,000 solar rotations, which now would terminate at x\nrather than beginning at x. (We can intuitively say that this\nremaining possibility is prior to or earlier than x, although\nAvicenna is careful not to beg any questions.) Now to say that there\nis a possibility for 10,000 solar rotations (prior to x) is\njust to say that (prior to x) there exist a possibility for a\nsun (or other body) to traverse a certain distance (that is, number of\nrotations) at a fixed speed. From Avicenna\u2019s earlier proof for\nthe existence of time, however, recall that the possibility for a\nmoving body to traverse a given distance at a fixed speed refers to\ntime. Consequently, since this possibility exists, time must exist.\nYet in order for time to exist, as Avicenna argued, motion and moving\nbodies must exist. Therefore, concludes Avicenna, when nothing but God\nexisted, time, motion and a moving body also would have necessarily\nexisted, a blatant contradiction. It is the assumption that time is\nfinite, claims Avicenna, that gives rise to the contradiction. Since\nthis same argument applies to any finite duration of time, during\nwhich one may suppose the world to exist, Avicenna concludes that\ntime, and so motion and moving bodies, must have existed infinitely\ninto the past. (For the same reason mutatis mutandis time,\nand so motion and moving bodies, also must exist infinitely into the\nfuture.)\n\nWhile I have only scratched the surface of the riches of\nAvicenna\u2019s natural philosophy, the above discussions provide a\nnumber of the most basic points of his thought.",
