    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time I || Past Hypothesis\n2.1 Past Hypothesis\n\nWithout proclaiming the laws of nature time asymmetric, there is no\nway to eliminate as impossible transitions\n (2)\n in favor of\n (1).\n Nevertheless, appealing to temporally asymmetric boundary conditions\nallows us to describe a world wherein\n (1)\n but not\n (2)\n occur. A cosmological hypothesis claiming that in the very distant\npast entropy was much lower will work. Boltzmann, as well as many of\nthis century\u2019s greatest scientists, e.g., Einstein, Richard\nFeynman, and Erwin Schroedinger, saw that this hypothesis is necessary\ngiven our (mostly) time asymmetric laws. (Boltzmann, however,\nexplained this low-entropy condition by treating the observable\nuniverse as a natural statistical fluctuation away from equilibrium in\na vastly larger universe.) Earlier states do not have higher entropy\nthan present states because we make the cosmological posit that the\nuniverse began in an extremely tiny section of its available phase\nspace. Albert (2000) calls this the \u201cPast Hypothesis\u201d and\nargues that it solves both this problem of the direction of time and\nalso the one to be discussed below. Note that classical mechanics is\nalso compatible with a \u201cFuture Hypothesis\u201d: the claim that\nentropy is very low in the distant future. The restriction to\n\u201cdistant\u201d is needed, for if the near future were of\nlow-entropy, we would not expect the thermodynamic behavior that we\nsee\u2014see Cocke 1967, Price 1996, and Schulman 1997 for discussion\nof two-time boundary conditions.\n\nThe Past Hypothesis offers an elegant solution to the problem of the\ndirection of time. However, there are some concerns.\n\nFirst, some find it incredible that (e.g.) gases everywhere for all\ntime should expand through their available volumes due to special\ninitial conditions. The common cause of these events is viewed as\nitself monstrously unlikely. Expressing this feeling, R. Penrose\n(1989) estimates that the probability, given the standard measure on\nphase space, of the universe starting in the requisite state is\nastronomically small. In response, one may hold that the Past\nHypothesis is lawlike. If so, then the probability for this state, if\nsuch exists, is one! Even if one doesn\u2019t go down this path, one\nmay have other problems with claiming that the initial condition of\nthe universe needs further explanation. See Callender 2004a,b for such\na view and Price 1996, 2004 for the contrary position.\n\nSecond, another persistent line of criticism might be labeled the\n\u201csubsystem\u201d worry. It\u2019s consistent with the Past\nHypothesis, after all, that none of the subsystems on Earth ever\ndisplay thermodynamically asymmetric behavior. How exactly does the\nglobal entropy increase of the universe imply local\nentropy increase among the subsystems (which, after all, is what\ncauses us to posit the Second Law in the first place)? See Winsberg\n2004 for this objection and Callender 2011a, Frisch 2010, and North\n2011 for discussion.\n\nThird, what exactly does the Past Hypothesis say in the context of our\nbest and most recent physics? While not denying that temporally\nasymmetric boundary conditions are needed to solve the problem, Earman\n(2006) is very critical of the Past Hypothesis, concluding that it\nisn\u2019t even coherent enough to be false. The main problem Earman\nsees is that we cannot state the Past Hypothesis in the language of\ngeneral relativity. Callender (2010, 2011b) and Wallace (2010) discuss\nthe related question of stating the Past Hypothesis when\nself-gravitation is included. One may also consider the question in\nthe context of quantum theory (see Wallace 2013).\n",
