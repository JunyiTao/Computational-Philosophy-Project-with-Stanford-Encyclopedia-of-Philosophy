    "main_text": "Types of Modal Fictionalism || Strong vs. Timid\n1.2 Strong vs. Timid\n\nThis next distinction concerns the role the modal fiction is to play\nin the theory. Is the fiction of possible worlds intended to provide\nan explanation of the applicability modal vocabulary, or not? The view\nthat the truth of modal claims depends on, or is to be explained by,\nthe contents of the fiction of possible worlds is often called\n\u201cstrong modal fictionalism\u201d, following Rosen\u2019s\ndescription of such a view (Rosen 1990, p. 354, Nolan 1997a). The view\nthat modal truth does not depend on the contents of the modal fiction\n(and usually, that what the contents of the modal fiction are depends\non the modal truth), on the other hand, is known as \u201ctimid modal\nfictionalism\u201d, again following Rosen (Rosen 1990, p. 354).\n\nBoth the view put forward by Armstrong 1989 and the primary view\ndiscussed (but not endorsed) by Rosen 1990 seem to have been\nfictionalisms of the \u2018strong\u2019 kind (see Nolan 1997a, p.\n263). \u2018Timid\u2019 fictionalism about possible worlds is also\nmentioned by Rosen 1990, and has been endorsed in passing by Field\n(1989, p. 41, 86). Sider 2002 is also on the \u2018timid\u2019 side,\nnot seeking an analysis at least of basic de dicto necessity. A modal\nfictionalist theory which sees the fiction of possible worlds as\nproviding the resources for an analysis of modal statements would of\ncourse do important theoretical work: since the analysis of claims\ninvolving modal operators is among the most controversial and\ndifficult issues in metaphysics. The downside is that strong modal\nfictionalism seems to face serious objections: see section 4. \n\nApart from any objections that might be leveled at strong modal\nfictionalism, the advocate of this variety of modal fictionalism faces\nthe challenge of stating the contents of the modal fiction without\nrelying on modal notions in a way that would make the explanation of\nthose modal notions circular. Since the fiction explains the truth of\nmodal claims, explaining the content of the modal fiction by reference\nto modal claims would be circular (e.g., by stipulating that all of\nthe propositions which are necessary hold in all worlds, or that\nobjects have in all worlds in which they exist the properties which\nthey in fact have essentially). Stating, in non-modal terms, general\nprinciples about possible worlds that would enable one to determine,\nwhen presented with a proposition, whether it holds at all worlds, at\nsome but not others, or none, is a difficult and controversial matter.\nPlausibly, a strong modal fictionalist will owe us such a non-modal\nspecification of the contents of the modal fiction, if our\nunderstanding of the contents of the modal fiction is to allow us a\nuseful method of assessing the truth of modal claims. Furthermore the\nstrong modal fictionalist seems committed to there being a\nfact of the matter about the content of the modal fiction which is not\nitself to be explained or analysed in terms of further modal facts of\nthe matter. \n\nOne particularly pressing instance of this difficulty (noted e.g., by\nRosen 1990, p. 344) is the problem of how to understand the\n\u201caccording to the fiction of possible worlds\u2026\u201d\noperator. Natural initial glosses, as Rosen points out, include: \n\nIf PW were true, then P would be true; If we suppose PW,\nP follows; It would be impossible for PW to be true without\nP being true as well. (Rosen 1990, p. 344)\n\n\nThe problem is that these seem modal. Rosen offers several possible\nresponses the fictionalist could make to this problem. He could admit\nthat his theory does indeed contain a modal primitive, but claim\nnevertheless that it is some sort of advance in analysis, reducing all\nmodal primitives to one. (Though as Rosen says, \u201cAccording to\nthe fiction of possible worlds\u201d seems like a very odd\nprimitive.) Or he could instead attempt to spell out the prefix in a\nnon-modal way. This has not to date been attempted by many avowed\nmodal fictionalists, but is one of the many tasks facing a modal\nfictionalist who sees the invocation of the fiction as the method for\nanalysing or explaining modality.\n\nIf the modal fictionalist were only timid, on the other hand, then the\nfictionalist biconditional could be used to generate a great deal of\nthe content of the modal fiction: whether or not the fiction claims\nthat a given proposition is true in all possible worlds (or all\naccessible worlds) depends on whether that proposition is indeed\nnecessarily true; whether or not a proposition is true at some world\n(or some accessible world) depends on whether it is possibly true; and\nso on. Furthermore, an analysis of truth in fiction in terms of some\nmodal notion (whether a counterfactual conditional, strict\nimplication, or whatever) would not make the account circular, since\nanalysing modal discourse would be no part of the purpose of the\nfictional machinery. One recent worked-out modal fictionalist approach\nwhich explicitly analyses the relevant \u201caccording to the modal\nfiction\u201d operator in terms of modal operators is Divers 1999b.\nAmong other benefits, Divers argues that this sort of definition\nenables one to prove a \u201cmodal safety result\u201d: that when we\nhave two modal claims A and B, and we have the\npossible-worlds-analogues of the two modal claims (call them\nA* and B* respectively), \u201cNecessarily, if\nB* is a consequence of A* then B is a\nconsequence of A\u201d (Divers 1999b, p. 330). Such a safety\nresult would be welcome, for it would provide the guarantee we needed\nthat \u201cdetouring\u201d in our reasoning through claims like\nA* and B* would not lead us astray when trying to\ndetermine whether B followed from A. \n\nA drawback of timid modal fictionalism is that it leaves the important\nissue of a theory of modality to one side. Without some other positive\nstory, even if it were primitivism about modality, it might seem that\nit would be difficult to motivate timid fictionalism over agnosticism\nabout the status of possible worlds. In this context, the agnostic\noption would be to accept that the story of possible worlds is at\nleast a useful fiction, but for all we know it may be that some theory\nthat explains possibility in terms of possible worlds is true as well.\nMany of the leading candidates for the analysis of modal claims are\nthose that explain the truth of modal claims in terms of the literal\nexistence and nature of possible worlds, so without a positive\nalternative story, it might seem premature to reject this style of\nexplanation of modality. However, the project of endorsing\nfictionalism about possible worlds and possible objects without\nendorsing the further claim that this fiction provides the material to\nexplain or analyse our modal notions, while in some ways less\nphilosophically interesting than its strong cousin, is proportionally\nless open to serious objections. \n",
