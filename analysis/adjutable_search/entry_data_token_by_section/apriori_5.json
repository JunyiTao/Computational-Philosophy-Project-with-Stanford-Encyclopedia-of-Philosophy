Start\nwith contrasting examples like the fifteen above and construct a\ntheory that explains the difference. Timothy Williamson objects to\nthis approach on the grounds that it may result \u201cin a\ndistinction of no special significance like a taxonomy of plants and\nanimals based on color\u201d or the classification of plants into\nbushes and non-bushes (2013: 291 and 309). Ultimately, that is what he\nargues: the difference between a priori and a\nposteriori knowledge is insignificant.\n\nWilliamson imagines that through perceptual experiences and relevant\nfeedback a person has acquired the ability to reliably judge distances\nin terms of inches, and separately, by the same means, to judge them\nin terms of centimeters. But she has not yet realized that there is a\nrelationship between distance in inches and distance in centimeters.\nThen one day she uses her perceptual capacity to judge distances in\ninches and centimeters \u201coffline\u201d by forming side-by-side\nvisual images of marks nine inches apart and nineteen centimeters\napart and sees that D is true: If two marks had been nine\ninches apart, they would have been at least nineteen centimeters\napart. She has never measured how far apart the front and back\nlegs of an ant are, but in a similar way she uses her imagination and\nsees that A is true: If two marks had been nine inches\napart, they would have been further apart than the front and back legs\nof an ant.\n\nIn both cases, experience is the basis of a capacity to make judgments\nin imagination and what goes on in imagination is what provides the\njustification for those judgments.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s argument against the significance of the\ndistinction between a priori and a posteriori\njustification rests on comparing how D and A (and other\nsimilar pairs of propositions like 4a and 4b in the examples above)\nare justified. He contends that they are both justified by relevant\nmanipulations in imagination. But on traditional accounts of\njustification, D would be a paradigm case of some proposition\nthat can only be a priori justified and A a paradigm\ncase of some proposition that can only be a posteriori\njustified. Williamson seems happy to concede that there is some sort\nof difference (2013: 294\u2013295, 296\u2013297) between these two\ntypes of justification but to deny that it is a significant difference\ngiven the way that each type relies on manipulations in imagination.\nHe might grant that the difference is like the difference between\nseeing something through a microscope or telescope as opposed to\nseeing something with the naked eye. There is a difference, but it is\nnot a significant difference since these three types of seeing all\nrely on visual perceptions.\n\nDefenders of a significant distinction between a priori and\na posteriori justification could grant that there is no\nsignificant difference insofar as imagination plays the role in\njustification that Williamson proposes. And sometimes it does play\nthat role in a priori justification as Elijah Chudnoff\nillustrates with many examples involving geometric propositions and\naccompanying figures (2011a: 636\u201338; 2013a: 370\u2013372).\nHowever, there are other ways to justify propositions a\npriori. Some seemingly a priori propositions\ncan be justified by reflection. One example that Chudnoff often\nappeals to involves the proposition: if \\(a\\lt 1\\), then \\(2 -2a \\gt\n0\\). To justify that proposition, you might first let \\(a = 1\\) and\nsee that \\(2 - 2a = 0\\). You might then reflect that when\n\u201ca\u201d is a number less than one but greater than or\nequal to zero, \\((2 - 2a)\\) is greater than zero. Finally, you might\nreflect that if \u201ca\u201d is a negative number, \\((-2a)\\)\nwill be a positive number, so \\((2 - 2a)\\) will be a number larger\nthan 2, and so greater than zero. So by reflection on a few relevant\ncases, we can come to see a priori that if \\(a\\lt 1\\), then\n\\((2 - 2a) \\gt 0\\). This way is much different than the way we might\ncome via imagination to see A = If two marks had been nine\ninches apart, they would have been further apart than the front and\nback legs of an ant.\n\nIn the case of proposition D, we might learn that one inch\nequals 2.54 centimeters, do the math and see that nine inches equals\n22.86 centimeters, and thereby see that nine inches is greater than\nnineteen centimeters. There are other ways to be a priori\njustified in believing some proposition is true than by what\nWilliamson calls the method of simulation. And those ways of\njustifying a proposition a priori are significantly different\nfrom a posteriori ways of justifying a proposition.\n\nIn a forthcoming essay in a book in which Williamson and Paul\nBoghossian debate the a priori (forthcomingb), Boghossian\ndefends three different ways (none of which involve the method of\nsimulation) by which we might be a priori justified in\nbelieving a proposition: two ways in which our understanding might be\nthe source of a priori justification, and a third way that\nappeals to rational intuitions that do not have a distinctive\nphenomenology and, according to Boghossian, are not the product of our\nunderstanding concepts.\n\nIn many essays and a book, Elijah Chudnoff argues that intuitions have\nwhat he calls a \u201cpresentational phenomenology\u201d that\nparallels that of perception. For him, intuitions are intellectual\nperceptions that sometimes reveal abstract reality in the way that\nsensory perceptions sometimes reveal concrete reality. So on his view,\na priori justification is similar to, but significantly\ndifferent from, a posteriori justification. For Chudnoff,\nintuitions can be evoked through imagination, reflection, and even\nreasoning from premises to a conclusion, but it is their nature, not\ntheir source, that is the basis of their ability to provide\njustification. His argument parallels an argument that says\nperceptions justify because they are the mental states they are, not\nbecause of their source. That is why they can provide justification in\na demon world or the Matrix, even though their source is a demon or\nsuper computers and not real objects.\n\nLike Boghossian and Chudnoff, and unlike Williamson, Albert Casullo\nthinks that there is a significant difference between a\npriori and a posteriori justification based on the\ndifference between support by nonexperiential and\nexperiential evidence. He also thinks that there is something\nlike justification (namely, positive epistemic status) that does not\nrest on evidence at all (2012c: 318\u2013326). For Casullo and\nothers, positive epistemic status can stem from what you are entitled\nto accept given certain ends or projects. This sort of view will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.5\n below.\n",
