    "main_text": "\n\nA verb is transitive if and only if it usually occurs with a direct\nobject, and in such occurrences it is said to occur\ntransitively. Thus \u2018ate\u2019 occurs transitively in\n\u2018I ate the meat and left the vegetables\u2019, but not in\n\u2018I ate then left\u2019 (perhaps it is not the same verb\n\u2018left\u2019 in these two examples, but it seems to be the same\n\u2018ate\u2019). A verb is intensional if the verb phrase\n(VP) it forms with its complement is anomalous in at least one of\nthree ways: (i) substituting one expression for another that is\ncoreferential with it in the complement of the verb can change the\ntruth-value of the sentence in which the VP occurs \u2013 for\ninstance, you might admire Mark Twain but not Samuel Clemens, not\nrealizing that your pesky neighbor Sam is the famous writer\n(in this case substitution of the coreferential \u2018Samuel\nClemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 in the VP \u2018admire\nMark Twain\u2019 will turn a true sentence, \u2018you admire Mark\nTwain\u2019 into a false one, \u2018you admire Samuel\nClemens\u2019); (ii) the VP admits of a special\n\u201cunspecific\u201d reading if it contains a quantifier, or a\ncertain type of quantifier (Quine\u2019s example (1956:185) is famous: he\nobserves that if we paraphrase \u2018I want a sloop\u2019 as\n\u2018there is a (specific) sloop such that I want it\u2019, this\nwill give the wrong idea if all I want is \u2018mere relief from\nslooplessness\u2019, a sloop but no specific one; for more examples,\nsee section 1); and (iii) the normal existential commitments of names\nand existential quantifiers in the complement are suspended even when\nthe embedding sentence is negation-free (again, see section 1).\n\nIntensional phenomena are puzzling, and worth studying, because (a) it\nseems that the only way to account for language-speakers\u2019 capacities\nto produce and understand sentences of their native languages which\nthey have never encountered before is to posit\n compositional structure\n in language and an interpretive capacity in speakers that exploits\nit. But (b) the simplest ideas about what such structure is like\ncannot accommodate intensionality. So we want to know what the\nsmallest complication is which allows for the intensional.\nInvestigation of intensional verbs has focussed mainly on verbs used\nto make\n propositional attitude reports.\n These verbs take clauses rather than direct objects as their\ncomplements. However, as we will see below, intensional transitive\nverbs (henceforth ITVs) do not merely duplicate the problems raised by\npropositional attitude verbs, but introduce special difficulties of\ntheir own.\n",
