    "main_text": "Conceptual Matters || Obligation and Duty\n2.1 Obligation and Duty\n\nAs the previous sentence suggests, obligations are also duties. That\nis true, at any rate, when the obligation in question is political\nobligation. To be sure, some philosophers claim to have uncovered\ndifferences between obligations and duties, the most important of\nwhich is that obligations must be voluntarily undertaken or incurred,\nbut duties need not be (e.g., Brandt 1964; Hart 1958). The obligation\nto keep a promise or fulfill a contract, for example, arises only when\none has done something that generates the obligation \u2013 made a\npromise or signed a contract \u2013 but the duties of charity and\ntruth telling supposedly fall on us regardless of what, if anything,\nwe voluntarily commit to do. John Rawls relies on this distinction\nwhen he argues that most citizens of a reasonably just political\nsociety have no general obligation to obey its laws, even though they\ndo have a \u201cnatural duty\u201d to support just institutions\n\u2013 a duty he thinks has the general effect of requiring them to\nobey (Rawls 1999, p. 97). For the most part, however, the alleged\ndistinction between obligation and duty has played no significant role\nin the debates over the supposed moral responsibility to obey the law.\nTo invoke the distinction here would run counter to the tendency in\nboth ordinary language and contemporary philosophical discussion to\nuse the terms interchangeably, as when we speak of the\n\u201cduty\u201d to keep a promise or an \u201cobligation\u201d to\ntell the truth. This essay will proceed, then, like almost everything\nwritten on either side of the question, on the understanding that a\npolitical obligation, if it exists, is a moral duty to obey the law\n(but note the elaboration of this point in \u00a72.3).\n",
