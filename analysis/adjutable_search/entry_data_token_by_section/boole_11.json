    "main_text": "The Laws of Thought (1854)\n4. The Laws of Thought (1854)\n\nThe logic portion of \nBoole\u2019s second logic book, An Investigation \nof The Laws of Thought\non which are founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and\nProbabilities, published in 1854, \nwould \nbe devoted to trying to clarify and\ncorrect what was said in MAL, and providing more\nsubstantial applications, the main one being his considerable work in\nprobability theory.\n At the end of Chapter I Boole mentioned the theoretical\npossibility of using probability theory, enhanced by his algebra of\nlogic, to uncover fundamental laws governing society by analyzing large\nquantities of social data by large numbers of (human) computers. \n\n\n\nBoole used lower case Latin letters at the end of the alphabet, like \\(x,y,z\\), to represent classes. The universe was a class, denoted by 1; and there was\na class described as \u201cNothing\u201d, \ndenoted by 0,\nwhich we call the empty class. The operation of\nmultiplication was defined to be what we call intersection, and this led\nto his first law, \\(xy = yx\\), and then to the\nidempotent law \\(x^2 = x\\). Addition was introduced as\naggregation when the classes were disjoint. He stated the commutative\nlaw for addition, \\(x + y = y + x\\), and the distributive law \\(z(x +\ny) = zx + zy\\). Then followed \\(x - y = - y + x\\) and \\(z(x - y) = zx\n- zy\\). The associative laws for addition and multiplication were\nconspicuously absent. \n\n\nThe idempotent law \\(x^2 = x\\) was different from Boole\u2019s \nlaws for the common algebra\u2014it only applied to the\nindividual class symbols, not in general to compound terms that one\ncould build from these symbols.  For example, one does not have \n\\((x + y)^2 = x + y\\) in Boole\u2019s system, otherwise \n by ordinary\nalgebra with idempotent class symbols, this would imply \\(2xy = 0\\),\nand then \\(xy = 0\\), which would force \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to represent\ndisjoint classes. But it is not the case that every pair of classes is\ndisjoint. \n\n\nIt was this equational argument, that \\((x + y)^2 = x + y\\) implies \\(xy = 0\\), that  led Boole to view addition \\(x + y\\) as a partial operation, only defined \nwhen \\(xy = 0\\), that is, when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are disjoint classes. \nThe only place where he wrote down this argument was in his unpublished\nnotes\u2014see \nBoole: Selected Manuscripts \u2026, 1997,\nedited by Ivor Grattan-Guiness and G\u00e9rard Bornet, pp. 91,92.\nA similar equational argument, that \\((x - y)^2 = x - y\\) implies \\(y = xy\\), led \nto \\(x - y\\) being only defined when \\(y = xy\\), that is, when \\(y = x \\cap y\\), \nwhich is the same as \\(y \\subseteq x\\).\n\nIt was not until p. 66 of LT that Boole clearly informed the reader that \naddition, which had been introduced on p. 33, was a partial operation on \nclasses: \n\nThe expression \\(x+y\\) seems indeed uninterpretable, \nunless it is assumed that\nthe things represented by \\(x\\) and the things represented by \\(y\\) are entirely\nseparate; that they embrace no individuals in common.\n\n\nA similar statement about subtraction being a partial operation did not appear\nuntil p. 93:\n\nThe latter function presupposes, as a condition of its interpretation,\nthat the class represented by \\(y\\) is wholly contained in the class represented \nby \\(x\\).\n\n\nHere the \u201clatter function\u201d means\n\\(x-y\\). The dispersion of relevant facts about a topic, such as definitions of\nthe fundamental operations of addition and subtraction, is not helpful to the \nreader. \n\nAnother example of the need for caution when working with partial algebras is \nhow important it was that Boole chose the fundamental operation minus to be \nbinary subtraction, and not the unary operation of additive inverse that is \nstandard in ring theory. Note that the standard operations union, symmetric\ndifference, intersection \nand complement of the Boolean algebra of classes are definable in Boole\u2019s partial-algebra by totally defined terms\u2014he used these to be able to express propositions about classes by equations:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx \\cup y &:= x + (1-x)y \\\\\nx \\triangle y &:= x(1-y) + (1-x)y \\\\\nx \\cap y &:= xy \\\\\nx' &:= 1-x.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSubtraction was needed to find a totally defined term, namely \\(1-x\\), \nthat expresses the complement of \\(x\\). The term \\(1+(-x)\\), like \\(-x\\),\n is only defined for \\(x=0\\) in Boole\u2019s \npartial-algebra. \n\nThe same three equations define the Boolean algebra of classes in the standard\nBoolean ring of classes where addition is symmetric difference, except in this \ncase subtraction is a derived operation, namely \\(1-x\\) is defined to be\n \\(1 + (-x)\\), the unary minus \nbeing a fundamental operation in the Boolean ring, indeed in any ring.\n\n\nOne might expect that Boole was building toward claiming an axiomatic\nfoundation for his algebra of logic that, as he had (erroneously)\nclaimed in MAL,\njustified using all the processes of common algebra.\nIndeed he did discuss the rules of inference, that adding or\nsubtracting equals from equals gives equals, and multiplying equals by\nequals gives equals. But then the development of an axiomatic\napproach came to an abrupt halt. There was no discussion as to whether\nthe stated axioms (which he called laws) and rules of inference (which he\ncalled axioms) were sufficient for  his algebra of\nlogic. (They were not.) Instead he simply and briefly, with\nremarkably little fanfare, presented a radically new foundation for\nhis algebra of logic (LT pp. 37,38):\n\nLet us conceive then of an algebra in which the \nsymbols \\(x, y, z\\), \n&c. admit indifferently of the values 0 and 1, and of \nthese values alone. The laws, the axioms, and the processes, of such an Algebra \nwill be identical in their whole extent with the laws, the axioms, and the processes \nof an Algebra of Logic. Difference of interpretation will alone divide them. \nUpon this principle the method of the following work is established.\n\n\nNote that this algebra restricted the values of the variables to 0 and 1,\nbut placed no such restriction on the values of terms. There was no assertion\nthat this was to be a two-element algebra. Burris and Sankappanavar (2013) \nviewed the quote as saying that this algebra was just the ordinary \nalgebra of numbers modified by restricting the variables to the values 0 and 1 \nto determine the validity of an argument. They called this \nBoole\u2019s Rule of 0 and 1, \nand said he used this Rule to justify three of his main theorems \n(Expansion, Reduction, Elimination). These main theorems \nalong with the Solution Theorem yielded Boole\u2019s\nGeneral Method for discovering the strongest possible consequences of\npropositional premises under certain desired constraints (such as\neliminating some of the variables). Further comments on this \nRule are below in Section 5.2. \n\n\nIn Chapter V he defended the use of uninterpretables in his\nwork; as part of his justification for the use of uninterpretable\nsteps in symbolic algebra he pointed to the well known use of\n\\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) to obtain trigonometric identities. \nUnfortunately his Principles of Symbolical\nReasoning do not, in general, apply to partial algebras, that is,\nwhere some of the operations are only partially defined, such as\naddition and subtraction in Boole\u2019s algebra. \nNonetheless it turns out one can prove \nthat they do apply to his algebra of logic. In succeeding chapters he\ngave the Expansion Theorem, the new full-strength Elimination Theorem,\nan improved Reduction Theorem, and the Solution Theorem where formal division \nand formal expansion were used to solve an\nequation.\n\n\nBoole turned to the topic of the interpretability of a\nlogical function in Chapter VI Section 13. \nHe had already stated in MAL that every equation is\ninterpretable (by showing an equation was equivalent to a collection of\nconstituent equations). However algebraic terms need not be interpretable, e.g.,\n\\(1+1\\) is not interpretable. Some terms are partially interpretable,\nand equivalent terms can have distinct domains of interpretability.\n  In Chapter VI \nSection 13, he\ncomes to the conclusion that the condition for a polynomial \\(p\\) to be\nequivalent to a (totally) interpretable function is that it\nsatisfy \\(p^2 = p\\), in which case it is equivalent to a sum of\ndistinct constituents, namely those belonging to the non-vanishing\nmodulii of \\(p\\). A polynomial is idempotent if and only if\nall of its modulii are idempotent, that is, they are in \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\),\nin which case the expansion of the polynomial is a sum of distinct\nconstituents (or it is 0).\n\nBoole\u2019s Chapter XI Of Secondary Propositions is parallel to the treatment\nin MAL except that he changed from using the cases\nwhen \\(X\\) is true to the times when \\(X\\) is\ntrue. In Chapter XIII Boole selected arguments\nof Clarke and Spinoza, on the nature of an eternal being, to put under\nthe magnifying glass of his algebra of logic, starting with the\ncomment (LT, p. 185):\n\n2. The chief practical difficulty of this inquiry will\nconsist, not in the application of the method to the premises once\ndetermined, but in ascertaining what the premises\nare.\nOne conclusion was (LT, p. 216):\n\n19. It is not possible, I think, to rise from the\nperusal of the arguments of Clarke and Spinoza without a deep\nconviction of the futility of all endeavours to establish, entirely a\npriori, the existence of an Infinite Being, His attributes, and His\nrelation to the universe.\n\n\nIn the final chapter on logic, Chapter XV, Boole presented his\nanalysis of the conversions and syllogisms of Aristotelian logic. \n\nHe now considered this ancient logic to be a weak, fragmented attempt at a\nlogical system. \n\nThis neglected chapter is quite interesting\nbecause it is the only chapter where he analyzed particular\npropositions, making essential use of additional letters like\n\\(v\\) to encode some. \n\nThis is also the chapter where he stated (incompletely) the rules for working\nwith some.\n\n\nBoole noted in Chapter XV of LT that when a premise about \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nis expressed as an equation involving \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(v\\), the symbol \\(v\\) expressed some, but\nonly in the context in which it appeared in the premise. For example,\nAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\) has the \nexpression \\(x = vy\\), which implies \\(vx = vy\\). \nThis could be interpreted as Some \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\). \nA consequence of \\(vx = vy\\) is \\(v(1-x) = v(1-y)\\). \nHowever it was not permitted to read\nthis as Some not-\\(X\\) is not-\\(Y\\) since\n\\(v\\) did not appear with \\(1-x\\) or\n\\(1-y\\) in the premise. \n\n\n\nIn Chapter XV Boole gave the reader a brief summary of traditional\nAristotelian categorical logic, and analyzed some simple examples\nusing ad hoc techniques with his algebra of logic. Then he launched\ninto proving a comprehensive result by applying his General Method to\nthe pair of equations:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n vx &= v'y \\\\\n wz &= w'y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis was the case of like middle terms.\nHe permitted some of the parameters \\(v, v', w, w'\\) to be replaced by 1,\nbut not both \\(v, v'\\) and not both \\(w, w'\\) can be replaced by 1.\nOne could also replace \\(y\\) by \\(1-y\\) in both equations, and independently \nreplace \\(x\\) by \\(1-x\\) and \\(z\\) by \\(1-z\\).\nThe premises of many categorical syllogisms can be expressed in\nthis form. His goal was to eliminate \\(y\\) and find expressions for\n\\(x, 1-x\\) and \\(vx\\) in terms of \\(z, v, v', w, w'\\). \n\nBoole omitted writing out the reduction of the pair of equations to a single\nequation, as well as the elimination of the middle term \\(y\\) from this \nequation and the details of applying the Solution Theorem to obtain the\ndesired expressions for \\(x, 1-x\\) and \\(vx\\), \nthree equations involving large algebraic expressions. \n\nHis summary of the interpretation of this rather complicated algebraic \nanalysis was simply that in the case of like middle terms with at least one\nmiddle term universal, equate the extremes. For example the premises\nAll \\(y\\) is \\(x\\) and Some \\(z\\) is \\(y\\) are expressed by the \npair of equations \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n vx &= y \\\\\n wz &= w'y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus the conclusion equation is \\(vx = wz\\), which has the interpretation\nSome \\(x\\) is \\(z\\). \n\nThen he noted that the remaining categorical syllogisms are such that \ntheir premises can be put in the form:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nvx &= v'y \\\\\nwz &= w'(1-y).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis is the case of unlike middle terms.\nThis led to another triple of large equations, again with details of the\nderivation omitted, but briefly summarized by Boole in two recipes.\n\nFirst, in the case of unlike middle terms with at least one universal\nextreme, change the quantity and quality of that extreme and equate it to \nthe other extreme. For example the premises\nAll \\(x\\) is not-\\(y\\) and Some \\(z\\) is \\(y\\) gives the \npair of equations \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n x &= v'(1-y) \\\\\n wz &= w'y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus the conclusion equation is \\(v(1-x) = wz\\), which has the interpretation\nSome not-\\(x\\) is \\(z\\). \n\nSecondly, in the case of unlike middle terms, both of which are universal,\nchange the quantity and quality of one extreme and equate it to \nthe other extreme. For example the premises\nAll not-\\(y\\) is \\(x\\) and All \\(y\\) is \\(z\\) gives the \npair of equations \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n vx &= (1-y) \\\\\n wz &= y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus one conclusion equation is \\(1-x = wz\\), which has the interpretation \nAll not-\\(x\\) is \\(z\\).\nThe other is \\(vx = 1-z\\), which has the interpretation\nAll not-\\(z\\) is \\(x\\). Each of these two propositions is just the\nconversion by negation of the other.\n \n\nBoole noted (LT p. 237) that: \n\nThe process of investigation by which they are deduced will probably\nappear to be of needless complexity; and it is certain that they might\nhave been obtained with greater facility, and without the aid of any\nsymbolical instrument whatever.\n\n",
