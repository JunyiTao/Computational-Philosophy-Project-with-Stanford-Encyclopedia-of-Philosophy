    "main_text": "Critical Thinking and Argument Pedagogy\n7. Feminism, the Discipline of Philosophy, and Argumentation Scholarship\n\nIn conclusion, as we see especially in the discussions of fallacies\nand argument pedagogy as well as in the dominance of the Adversary\nMethod, feminist philosophical work on argumentation reveals a need\nfor philosophers to attend to argumentation scholarship. Outdated or\nunscholarly conceptions of how different modes and styles of arguing\nserve the advancement of knowledge can undermine the value of\nphilosophical reasoning and specifically how philosophers respond to\nfeminist philosophy. Yet, the work by interdisciplinary argumentation\nscholars and feminist philosophers to explore these tensions receives\nlittle uptake in the discipline of philosophy.\n\nAmong the feminist topics in argumentation scholarship that remain in\nneed of philosophical attention are: the range and complexity of\nvalues that arguing can serve, including social justice, social\nbonding, dispute resolution, and knowledge; and more thorough\nrepresentations of arguing practices that account for how discursive\nnorms code power and privilege, such as through politeness and\ntestimonial authority. Feminist research on these topics will be\nimportant for scholarship on argumentation and also for the discipline\nof philosophy, given the centrality of arguing to its practice.\nInterdisciplinary vantage points on argumentation provide resources\nuseful for feminist purposes and promise a broader perspective that\nmight unify different feminist concerns; at the same time, other\ndisciplines can face their own challenges from a feminist perspective,\nas rhetorical studies does for taking persuasion to provide the only\npurpose for arguing.\n\nFeminist concerns about argumentation pull in different directions and\ncreate a great deal of room for further research. Feminists regularly\noppose practices and theories central to the discipline of philosophy\nand some such form of opposition is intrinsic to feminist work. Yet\nfeminists criticize overemphasis on the opposition that occurs in the\ndefault adoption of adversarial styles of reasoning in philosophy and\nin the assumption that arguers must oppose each other or that they\nmust have contrary beliefs. Appeals to politeness do not provide the\neasy resolution to these concerns that some argumentation theorists\noften presume. In addition, although some of the worst tendencies in\nargumentation scholarship may be passed on generation to generation in\ncritical thinking classes taught by philosophers, these classes have\npotential to create progress toward social justice. Let us note that,\noverall, feminist perspectives on argumentation challenge broad social\nand epistemological norms as well as attend to the ways the norms play\nout in the culture of critical thinking, academic philosophy, and\nother accepted standards for shared reasoning.\n",
