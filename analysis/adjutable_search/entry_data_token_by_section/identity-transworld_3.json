Is \u2018the problem of transworld identity\u2019 a pseudo-problem?\n\nIn the discussion of transworld identity in the 1960s and 1970s (when\nthe issue came to prominence as a result of developments in modal\nlogic), it was debated whether the notion of transworld identity is\ngenuinely problematic, or whether, on the contrary, the alleged\n\u2018problem of transworld identity\u2019 is merely a\npseudo-problem. (See Loux 1979, Introduction, Section III; Plantinga\n1973 and 1974, Ch. 6; Kripke 1980 (cf. Kripke 1972); Kaplan 1967/1979;\nKaplan 1975; Chisholm 1967; for further discussion see, for example,\nDivers 2002, Ch. 16; Hughes 2004, Ch. 3; van Inwagen 1985; Lewis 1986,\nCh. 4.)\n\nIt is difficult to pin down the alleged problem that is supposed to be\nat the heart of this dispute. In particular, although the main\nproponents of the view that the alleged problem is a pseudo-problem\nclearly intended to attack (inter alia) Lewis\u2019s version\nof modal realism, they did not attempt to rebut the thesis (discussed\nin Section 1.2 above) that if one is a Lewisian realist about\npossible worlds, then one should find transworld identity problematic.\nMatters are complicated by the fact that proponents of the view that\nthe alleged problem of transworld identity is a pseudo-problem were to\nsome extent responding to hypothetical arguments, rather than\narguments presented in print by opponents (see Plantinga 1974, 93).\nHowever, one central issue was whether the claim that an individual\nexists in more than one possible world (and hence that there are cases\nof transworld identity) needs to be backed by the provision of\ncriteria of transworld identity, and, if so, why.\n\nThe term \u2018criterion of identity\u2019 is ambiguous. In an\nepistemological sense, a criterion of identity is a way of telling\nwhether an identity statement is true, or a way of recognizing whether\nan individual A is identical with an individual B.\nHowever, the notion of a criterion of identity also has a metaphysical\ninterpretation, according to which it is a set of (non-trivial)\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of an identity\nstatement. Although a criterion of identity in the second\n(metaphysical) sense might supply us with a criterion of identity in\nthe first (epistemological) sense, it seems that something could be a\ncriterion of identity in the second sense even if it is unsuited to\nplay the role of a criterion of identity in the first sense.\n\nThe most influential arguments against the view that there is\na genuine problem of transworld identity (or \u2018problem of\ntransworld identification\u2019, to use Kripke\u2019s preferred\nterminology) are probably those presented by Plantinga (1973, 1974)\nand Kripke (1980). Plantinga and Kripke appear to have, as their\ntarget, an alleged problem of transworld identity that rests on one of\nthree assumptions. The first assumption is that we must possess\ncriteria of transworld identity in order to ascertain, on the basis of\ntheir properties in other possible worlds, the identities of (perhaps\nradically disguised) individuals in those worlds. The second\nassumption is that we must possess criteria of transworld identity if\nour references to individuals in other possible worlds are not to miss\ntheir mark. The third assumption is that we must possess criteria of\ntransworld identity in order to understand transworld identity claims.\nAnyone who makes one of these assumptions is likely to think that\nthere is a problem of transworld identity\u2014a problem concerning\nour entitlement to make claims that imply that an individual exists in\nmore than one possible world. For it does not seem that we possess\ncriteria of transworld identity that could fulfil any of these three\nroles. However, Plantinga and Kripke provide reasons for thinking that\nnone of these three assumptions survives scrutiny. If so, and if these\nassumptions exhaust the grounds for supposing that there is a problem\nof transworld identity, the alleged problem may be dismissed as a\npseudo-problem.\n\nThe three assumptions may be illustrated, using our examples of George\nEliot and Bertrand Russell, as follows. (The examples are alternated\nsimply for the sake of a little variety.)\n\n(1)\nThe \u2018epistemological\u2019 assumption: We must possess a\ncriterion of transworld identity for George Eliot in order to be able\nto tell, on the basis of knowledge of the properties that an\nindividual has in some other possible world, whether that individual\nis identical with Eliot.\n(2)\nThe \u2018security of reference\u2019 assumption: We must\npossess a criterion of transworld identity for Bertrand Russell in\norder to know that, when we say such things as \u2018There is a\npossible world in which Russell is a playwright\u2019, we are talking\nabout Russell rather than someone else.\n(3)\nThe \u2018intelligibility\u2019 assumption: We must possess a\ncriterion of transworld identity for George Eliot in order to\nunderstand the claim that there is a possible world in which she is a\nscientist.\n\n",
