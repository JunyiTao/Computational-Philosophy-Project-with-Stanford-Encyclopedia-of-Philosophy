Depending on the particular stance and the\naspect of information to be stressed, these structures may stand for\ninformational states, structured syntactic representations, pieces of\ninformation understood as commodities, or global structures made up\nfrom local interrelated informational states or stages. Under which\nconditions can two informational structures be considered to be\ninformationally equivalent?\n\nAddressing this question brings out the need to have it clear at which\nlevel of granularity one is testing for equivalence. The\nclassical extensional notion of logical equivalence is a coarse, in\nthat informationally different claims such as 2 is even and 2\nis prime cannot be distinguished, as their extensions will\ncoincide. Equivalence given by identity at the level of\nrepresentations (say syntactic equality) is, on the contrary, too\nfine-grained in some cases: to a bilingual speaker, the information\nthat the shop is closed would be equally conveyed by a sign saying\n\u201cClosed\u201d as by a sign saying\n\u201cGeschlossen\u201d, even if the two words are\ndifferent.\n\nAn intermediate notion of equivalence that has proved central to the\nrange, correlational, and code views on information is the relation of\nbisimulation between structures. A bisimulation relation between two\ngraphs \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) (where both the arrows and nodes of the graphs\nare labelled) is a binary relation \\(R\\) between the nodes of the\ngraphs with the property that whenever a node \\(g\\) of \\(G\\) is\nrelated to a node \\(h\\) of \\(H\\), then:\n\n\\(g\\) and \\(h\\) have the same labels, and\nFor every relation label \\(L\\) and every L-child \\(g'\\) of \\(g\\),\nthere must be a L-child \\(h'\\) of \\(h\\) such that \\(h\\) and \\(h'\\) are\nrelated by \\(R\\). The analogous condition must hold for every\n\\(L\\)-child of \\(h\\).\n\n\nA simple example would be the relation between the following two\ngraphs (empty set of labels) that relates the point \\(x\\) with \\(a\\)\nand the point \\(y\\) with the points \\(b, c, d\\). \n\\[\\genfrac{}{}{0}{1}{x \\longrightarrow y}{\\phantom{x \\longrightarrow}\\circlearrowright} \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad \\genfrac{}{}{0}{1}{a \\longrightarrow b \\longrightarrow c \\longrightarrow d}{\\phantom{a \\longrightarrow b \\longrightarrow c \\longrightarrow} \\circlearrowright} \\]\n\n\nBisimulation is naturally a central notion for the\ninformation-as-range perspective because the Kripke models of\n section 1\n are precisely labelled graphs. It is a classical result of modal\nlogic that if two states of two models are related by a bisimulation,\nthen the states will satisfy exactly the same modal formulas, and in\naddition a first order property of states is definable in the basic\nmodal language if and only if the property is preserved under\nbisimulation.\n\nAs for the correlational stance, in situation theory bisimulation\nturns out to be the right notion in determining whether two infons\nthat might look structurally different are actually the same as pieces\nof information. For example, one possible analysis of Liar-like claims\nleads to infons that are nested in themselves, such as\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\llangle \\text{True}, \\text{what} : \\sigma , 0\\rrangle. \\]\n\n\nOne can naturally depict the structure of \\(\\sigma\\) as a labelled\ngraph, which will be bisimilar to the graph associated with the\napparently different infon \n\\[ \\psi = \\llangle \\text{True}, \\text{what} : \\llangle \\text{True}, \\text{what} : \\psi , 0\\rrangle , 0\\rrangle. \\]\n\n\nThe notion of bisimulation appeared independently in computer science,\nso it so no surprise that it also features in matters related to the\ninformation-as-code approach, with its focus on representation and\ncomputation. In particular, several versions of bisimulation have been\napplied to classes of automata to determine when two of them are\nbehaviourally equivalent, and data encodings such as \n\\[ L =\\langle 0, L\\rangle \\text{ and } L = \\langle 0, \\langle 0, L\\rangle \\rangle, \\]\n\n\nboth of which represent the same object (an infinite list of zeroes),\ncan be identified as such by noticing that the graphs that depict the\nstructure of these two expressions are bisimilar. See Aczel (1988),\nBarwise and Moss (1996), and Moss (2009) for more information about\nbisimulation an circularity, connections with modal logic, data\nstructures, and coalgebras.\n\nBut there is much more to be said about informational equivalence and\nthe right level of granularity. To reiterate, the themes highlighted\nby the various stances on information (partiality, aboutness,\nencoding, range, dynamics, agency) pose many challenges. For another\nexample: \u20183 is prime\u2019, and \u2018the sum of the angles of\na triangle is 180 degrees\u2019 are logically equivalent in the\nstandard sense, as they are both mathematical truths. But they should\nnot be always taken to be informationally equivalent in general.\nFirst, they are about different topics. Second, an agent might know\nthat 3 is prime, and yet not know that 180 is the sum of the angles of\na triangle, due to its having only partial knowledge about triangles.\nThird, even if the agent had enough current knowledge to eventually\ninfer that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, the\ninference might be hard for this agent, so being told that the sum of\nthe angle is 180 would be informative in a way that being told that 3\nis prime would not.\n\nInformation, just as content, meaning, knowledge, belief, and many\nagent attitudes (seeing that, suspecting that\u2026) exhibit\nhyperintensional properties. There is an active line of research that\nstudies how formal systems can capture these phenomena (see the entry\non\n hyperintensionality).\n Here, we just note that the formal approaches to hyperintensionality\nmost closely related to this entry follow some of these\nstrategies:\n\nExtending possible-world semantics by allowing impossible worlds\nand adding a notion of topics. Given a formula, one does not consider\nonly its truth conditions (the range of words that make it true) but a\npair , so formulas with the same truth conditions may be told apart by\nvirtue of being associated to different topics. See Yablo (2014), Jago\n(2015), Berto and Jago (2019).\nDefining models based on states (not worlds) that can be partial\nand/or inconsistent with respect to the information they validate. The\nmodels give a relation of \u201cparthood\u201d between states, and a\nbinary fusion operation on states. The truth conditions of a formula\nis a pair \\(\\langle \\textit{truthmakers}, \\textit{falsifiers}\n\\rangle\\) of subsets of states that make a formula true and false,\nrespectively. There is also a formal way to define the topic of a\nformula. As before, topics give a way to differentiate formulas with\nthe same truth conditions. The partiality of states and the definition\nof truth conditions allow for another way to make differences, because\ntwo formulas may have the same set of verifiers but a different set of\nfalsifiers. This approach is close in spirit to the situation theory\ntradition. See Fine (2017) and Fine and Jago (2020).\nUsing relevant logics to take advantage of the particularities of\nits semantics (see Mares 2004).\n From the formal point of view, approaches (1), (2), (3) are\ncloser to the formal systems used in the information-as-range,\ninformation-as-correlation, and information-as-code stances,\nrespectively. Most of the work has been on hyperintensionality in\ngeneral, not specifically about information. However, see Berto and\nHawke (2021) for a semantics for an operator of knowability relative\nto information, where the construction \\(K_\\phi \\psi\\) is understood\nas saying that \\(\\psi\\) is knowable on the basis of information\n\\(\\psi\\), and Berto and Jago (2019) for a discussion on the use\nof impossibilities to treat issues such as informative sentences and\ninferences. In section 4.2 we already referred to Mares (2004) and the\ninformational interpretation of relevant logic. Jago (2020), on the\nother hand, presents a truthmaker semantics for relevant logic. There\nare also some proposals of more general frameworks for\nhyperintensionality for which (1) and (2) above can be seen as\nparticular cases or applications (see Sedlar 2021 and Leitbeg 2018),\nand van Benthem (2019) exemplifies how truthmaker semantics may be\ntranslated into a modal information logic. The more general point (van\nBenthem 2019) illustrates is that there are, roughly speaking, two\nnatural and complementary styles of logical systems one can use to\nanalyse a new notion. Some systems are more explicit, in that they\nextend an existing system (e.g. modal logic) with laws for new\nvocabulary that is directly related to the new notion one wants to\nanalyze, without changing the previously existing logical notions. In\ncontrast, a more implicit way of dealing with a new notion is to use a\nnonstandard reasoning system, so making changes on what the allowed\nreasoning patterns are, rather than adding new vocabulary. The use of\none or other style, as well as the existence or not of translations\nbetween them, may help shed light on what philosophical claims may or\nmay not be made about the notion one is studying. An example of a\nrelevant question, in our context, is to what extent\nhyperintensionality may or may not be captured by the explicit style\nof classical modal informational logics.\n\n",
