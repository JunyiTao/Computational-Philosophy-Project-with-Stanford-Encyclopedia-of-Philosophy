    "main_text": "Arguments and Examples || Arguments from sameness\n2.4 Arguments from sameness\n\nThere is also a tradition\u2014a bit less frequent in the\nliterature\u2014of cases involving cognitive similarity that\nare purportedly best captured by a distinctive category of\nself-locating belief. (Though see Perry 2019\u2019s discussion of\nwhat he calls \u201cType A\u201d cases.) A prominent example:\n\n\nHume and Heimson\n\nLet us imagine David Hume, alone in his study, on a particular\nafternoon in 1775, thinking to himself, \u201cI wrote the\nTreatise\u201d. Can anyone else apprehend the thought he\napprehended by thinking this? First note that what he thinks is true.\nSo no one could apprehend the same thought, unless they apprehended a\ntrue thought. Now suppose Heimson is a bit crazy and thinks himself to\nbe David Hume. Alone in his study, he says to himself, \u201cI wrote\nthe Treatise\u201d. However much his inner life may, at that\nmoment, resemble Hume\u2019s on that afternoon in 1775, the fact\nremains: Hume was right, Heimson is wrong. Heimson cannot think the\nvery thought to himself that Hume thought to himself, by using the\nvery same sentence. (Perry 1977: 17)\n\n\nLet us step back from some of the particular commitments in\nPerry\u2019s presentation of the case to extract an argument that\nboth Perry and Lewis could endorse: There\u2019s something\ntheoretically and explanatorily important that Hume and Heimson have\nin common. But it\u2019s not a state of believing P\nfor any traditional proposition P. (If it was, either both\nwould be correct in their belief or neither would.) To capture this\ndoxastic similarity, we need resources beyond those provided by the\nSimple Picture. We need states of distinctively self-locating\nbelief.\n\nThe Hume/Heimson case is a bit odd, since Heimson\u2019s belief is a\nbit odd. But more mundane examples are ubiquitous. One occurs a bit\nlater in Perry 1977: there is something doxastically in common to all\nof the (well-informed) residents of Kennebunkport\u2014they\u2019re\nall in a doxastic state that leads them to sincerely assert \u201cI\nam in Kennebunkport\u201d, and to engage in Kennebunkport-appropriate\nbehavior. Similarly, there\u2019s something doxastically in common to\neveryone disposed to sincerely assert, \u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore\nLake before me\u201d (Perry 1979) or \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d (Kaplan 1989).\n\nThese doxastic similarities are not a matter of all the group\nmembers\u2019 being in a common state of the type, believing\nP for some traditional proposition P.\n(There\u2019s no traditional proposition that all and only those\ndisposed to sincerely assert, e.g., \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d\nbelieve, believing which generates\u2014given otherwise typical\nbeliefs and desires\u2014corresponding behavioral dispositions.)\n\nNotice also that these problems are not just problems about belief.\nIt\u2019s awkward for the Simple Picture of belief that Hume and\nHeimson seem to have a common belief, but Hume\u2019s belief is\ncorrect while Heimson\u2019s is incorrect. Whatever\u2019s in common\nto Hume and Heimson, it\u2019s not standing in the belief relation to\na common traditional proposition. Since Hume and Heimson are\nworldmates, any traditional proposition that one of them would be\ncorrect to believe, the other would be as well. It\u2019s similarly\nawkward for a Simple Picture about desire that Hume and Heimson could\nequally well both want to be Hume (or to have written the\nTreatise), and if they did, Hume\u2019s desire would be\nsatisfied and Heimson\u2019s would not. This means, because Hume and\nHeimson are worldmates, that their conative similarity can\u2019t be\na matter of both standing in the desire relation to a common\ntraditional proposition. And once we\u2019ve seen this trick,\nit\u2019s easy to generate parallel examples for other propositional\nattitudes, and it\u2019s easy to generate examples in which the\nattitudes in question aren\u2019t as odd as Heimson\u2019s.\n\nMoreover, once we\u2019ve seen the trick of generating non-doxastic\nsimilarity cases, it\u2019s straightforward to generate non-doxastic\ndifference cases as well. A wants to lead and B\nwants to follow. That\u2019s a difference in preference, that gives\nrise to systematic differences in behavior. But it\u2019s not a\ndifference in traditional propositions desired. Very clearly,\nit\u2019s not a difference in the possible worlds A and\nB favor\u2014both favor the worlds in which A leads\nand B follows. And it\u2019s not clear how the extra\nstructure of traditional propositions that aren\u2019t sets of worlds\n(e.g., Russellian propositions) could help draw the distinction.\n(Lewis discusses a similar case in \u201cDispositional Theories of\nValue\u201d, 1989: 119.)\n\nThis points to another advantage of sameness and difference\narguments\u2014over ignorance arguments\u2014as the primary\nargumentative basis for recognizing self-locating belief: sameness and\ndifference arguments are easily generalized to other propositional\nattitudes, while ignorance arguments are belief-specific.\n",
