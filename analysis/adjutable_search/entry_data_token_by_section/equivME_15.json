    "main_text": "History of Derivations of Mass-Energy Equivalence || Purely Dynamical Derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n3.2 Purely Dynamical Derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n\nPurely dynamical derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) typically proceed by\nanalyzing an inelastic collision from the point of view of two\ninertial frames in a state of relative motion (the centre-of-mass\nframe, and an inertial frame moving with a relative velocity \\(v)\\).\nOne of the first papers to appear following this approach is\nPerrin\u2019s (1932). According to Rindler and Penrose (1965),\nPerrin\u2019s derivation was based largely on Langevin\u2019s\n\u201celegant\u201d lectures, which were delivered at the\nColl\u00e8ge de France in Zurich around 1922. Einstein himself gave\na purely dynamical derivation (Einstein, 1935), though he nowhere\nmentions either Langevin or Perrin. The most comprehensive derivation\nof this sort was given by Ehlers, Rindler and Penrose (1965). More\nrecently, a purely dynamical version of Einstein\u2019s original\n(1905b) thought experiment, where the particles that are emitted are\nnot photons, has been given by Mermin and Feigenbaum (1990) and Mermin\n(2005).\n\nDerivations in this group are distinctive because they demonstrate\nthat mass-energy equivalence is a consequence of the changes to the\nstructure of spacetime brought about by special relativity. The\nrelationship between mass and energy is independent of Maxwell\u2019s\ntheory or any other theory that describes a specific physical\ninteraction. We can get a glimpse of this by noting that to derive\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) by analyzing a collision, one must first define the\nfour-momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\), the \u201cspace-part\u201d of which is\nrelativistic momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}_{\\rel}\\), and relativistic kinetic\nenergy \\(T_{\\rel}\\), since one cannot use the old Newtonian notions of\nmomentum and kinetic energy. \n\nIn Einstein\u2019s own purely dynamical derivation (1935), more than\nhalf of the paper is devoted to finding the mathematical expressions\nthat define \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\). This much work is required\nto arrive at these expressions for two reasons. First, the changes to\nthe structure of spacetime must be incorporated into the definitions\nof the relativistic quantities. Second, \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\)\nmust be defined so that they reduce to their Newtonian counterparts in\nthe appropriate limit. This last requirement ensures, in effect, that\nspecial relativity will inherit the empirical success of Newtonian\nphysics. Once the definitions of \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\) are\nobtained, one derives mass-energy equivalence in a straight-forward\nway by analyzing a collision. (For a more detailed discussion of\nEinstein\u2019s (1935), see Fernflores, 2018.)\n\nAt a very general level, purely dynamical derivations of\nEinstein\u2019s equation and derivations that appeal to\nMaxwell\u2019s theory really follow the same approach. In both styles\nof derivations, although it may not seem like it at first glance, we\nare dealing with one of the most basic dynamical interactions: a\ncollision. So, for example, we can construe the physical configuration\nof Einstein\u2019s original 1905 derivation (Einstein 1905b) as a\ncollision in which the total number of objects is not conserved. This\nis even easier to do if one adopts a \u201cparticle\u201d\ndescription of light. In both the purely dynamical derivations and the\nderivations that appeal to an interaction with electromagnetic\nradiation, one then examines the collision in question and shows that\nin order for dynamical principles to be satisfied, the relationship\namong the masses and energies of the objects involved in the\ncollisions must satsify Einstein\u2019s equation. \n\nThe main difference between the two approaches to deriving\nEinstein\u2019s equation is that in derivations that consider a\ncollision with light, one must use the dynamical properties of light,\nwhich are not themselves described by special relativity. For example,\nas we have seen, in Einstein\u2019s 1946 derivation (see\n Section 1.5),\n we must appeal to the expression for the momentum of a burst of\nlight. \n",
