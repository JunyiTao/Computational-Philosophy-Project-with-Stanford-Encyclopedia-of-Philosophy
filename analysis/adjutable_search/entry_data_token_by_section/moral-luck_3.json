    "main_text": "Responding to the Problem: Three Approaches\n4. Responding to the Problem: Three Approaches\n\nThere are three general approaches to responding to the problem of\nmoral luck: (i) to deny that there is moral luck despite appearances,\n(ii) to accept the existence of moral luck while rejecting or\nrestricting the Control Principle, or (iii) to argue that it is simply\nincoherent to accept or deny the existence of some type(s) of moral\nluck, so that with respect to at least the relevant types of moral\nluck, the problem of moral luck does not arise.\n\nSome who respond to the problem of moral luck take a single approach\nto all kinds of luck. But many take a mixed approach; that is, they\nembrace one approach for one kind of luck and another approach for\nanother kind of luck, or address only a certain type(s) of luck, while\nremaining silent about the other types. Is taking a mixed approach\nlegitimate? After all, it seems that if the Control Principle is true,\nthen there is no moral luck, and if it is false, then there can be any\ntype of moral luck. But, alas, matters are not necessarily so simple.\nIt is possible at least in theory to offer a principled reason for\nqualifying the Control Principle so that it applies only to certain\nsorts of factors and not others. At the same time, as we will see,\nproviding just such a principled way of distinguishing certain kinds\nof luck from others turns out to be a formidable task.\n",
