    "main_text": "Basic Sign Structure || The Object\n1.2 The Object\n\nJust as with the sign, not every characteristic of the object is\nrelevant to signification: only certain features of an object enable a\nsign to signify it. For Peirce, the relationship between the object of\na sign and the sign that represents it is one of determination: the\nobject determines the sign. Peirce\u2019s notion of determination is by no\nmeans clear and it is open to interpretation, but for our purposes, it\nis perhaps best understood as the placing of constraints or\nconditions on successful signification by the object, rather than the\nobject causing or generating the sign. The idea is\nthat the object imposes certain parameters that a sign must fall\nwithin if it is to represent that object. However, only certain\ncharacteristics of an object are relevant to this process of\ndetermination. To see this in terms of an example, consider again the\ncase of the molehill.\n\nThe sign is the molehill, and the object of this sign is the mole. The\nmole determines the sign, in as much as, if the molehill is to succeed\nas a sign for the mole it must show the physical presence of the mole.\nIf it fails to do this, it fails to be a sign of that object. Other\nsigns for this object, apart from the molehill, might include the\npresence of mole droppings, or a particular pattern of ground\nsubsidence on my lawns, but all such signs are constrained by the need\nto show the physical presence of the mole. Clearly, not everything\nabout the mole is relevant to this constraining process: the mole\nmight be a conventional black color or an albino, it might be male or\nfemale, it might be young or old. None of these features, however, are\nessential to the constraints placed upon the sign. Rather, the causal\nconnection between it and the mole is the characteristic that it\nimposes upon its sign, and it is this connection that the sign must\nrepresent if it is to succeed in signifying the mole.\n",
