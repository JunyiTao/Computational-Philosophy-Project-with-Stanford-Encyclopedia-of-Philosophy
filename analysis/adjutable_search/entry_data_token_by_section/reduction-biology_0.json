    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nReduction (reductionism) encompasses several, related philosophical\nthemes. At least three types can be distinguished: ontological,\nmethodological, and epistemic (Sarkar 1992, cf. Nagel 1998). Even\nthough arguments for and against reductionism often include a\ncombination of positions related to all three, these distinctions are\nsignificant because no straightforward entailment relations obtain\nbetween the different types of reduction (although tacit commitments\nabout these relations are prevalent).\n\n(i) Ontological reduction is the idea that each\nparticular biological system (e.g., an organism) is constituted by\nnothing but molecules and their interactions. In metaphysics this idea\nis often called\n physicalism\n (or materialism) and it assumes in a biological context that (a)\nbiological properties\n supervene\n on physical properties (i.e., no difference in a biological property\nwithout a difference in some underlying physical property), and (b)\neach particular biological process (or token) is\nmetaphysically identical to some particular physico-chemical process.\nThis latter tenet is sometimes called token-token reduction, in\ncontrast to the stronger tenet that each type of biological process is\nidentical to a type of physico-chemical process. Ontological reduction\nin this weaker sense is a default stance nowadays among philosophers\nand biologists though the philosophical details remain controversial\n(e.g., are there genuinely\n emergent properties?)\n Different conceptions of physicalism may yield different implications\nfor ontological reduction in biology (Dowell 2006). The denial of\nphysicalism by vitalism, the view that biological systems are governed\nby forces that are not physico-chemical, is largely of historical\ninterest. (Vitalism also admits of various conceptions, especially\nwith respect to how non-physico-chemical forces are understood; see\n Section 2.)\n Some authors have argued vigorously for the significance of\nmetaphysical concepts in discussions of reductionism in biology\n(Rosenberg 1978, 1985, 1994, 2006).\n\n(ii) Methodological reduction is the idea that\nbiological systems are most fruitfully investigated at the lowest\npossible level, and that experimental studies should be aimed at\nuncovering molecular and biochemical causes (Andersen 2017). A common\nexample of this type of strategy is the decomposition of a complex\nsystem into parts (Bechtel and Richardson 1993); a biologist might\ninvestigate the cellular parts of an organism in order to comprehend\nits behavior, or investigate the biochemical components of a cell to\nunderstand its features. Although methodological reductionism is often\nmotivated by a presumption of ontological reduction, this procedural\nrecommendation does not follow directly from it. In fact, unlike\ntoken-token reduction, methodological reductionism can be quite\ncontroversial. It has been argued that exclusively reductionist\nresearch strategies exhibit systematic biases that overlook relevant\nbiological features, and that for certain questions a more fruitful\nmethodology consists in integrating the discovery of molecular causes\nwith the investigation of higher level features (Wimsatt 1980,\n 2007).[1]\n\n(iii) Epistemic reduction is the idea that the\nknowledge about one scientific domain (typically about higher level\nprocesses) can be reduced to another body of scientific knowledge\n(typically concerning a lower or more fundamental level). While an\nendorsement of some form of epistemic reduction can be motivated by\nontological reduction in combination with methodological reductionism\n(e.g., the past success of reductionist research in biology), the\npossibility of epistemic reduction does not follow directly from their\nconjunction. Indeed, debates about reduction in the\n philosophy of biology\n have centered on this third type of reduction as the most\ncontroversial issue (see\n Section 4),\n and therefore our discussion will focus primarily on issues related\nto epistemic reduction. Prior to evaluating any reduction of one body\nof knowledge to another, a conception of those bodies of knowledge and\nwhat it would mean for them to be\n \u201creduced\u201d must be explicated.\n A number of different models of reduction have been proposed. Thus,\nthe debate about reduction in biology has not only revolved around\nwhether epistemic reduction is possible, but also which notions of\nepistemic reduction are operative in actual scientific reasoning. Two\nbasic categories can be distinguished: (a) models of theory\nreduction maintain that one theory can be logically deduced from\nanother theory\n (Section 3.1);\n and, (b) models of explanatory reduction focus on whether\nhigher level features can be explained by lower level features\n (Section 3.2).\n\nThe philosophical study of reduction links up with several key issues\nin the philosophy of science. As reduction involves relating (broadly\nspeaking) one \u201cbody of scientific knowledge\u201d to another,\nit presupposes an account of the relevant epistemic units to be\nrelated (e.g.,\n theories,\n laws,\n models,\n mechanisms,\n concepts,\n or disciplines)\u2014how should these be understood? Since the\nreduction of one theory to another usually presumes that somehow the\nreducing theory explains the principles of the reduced\ntheory, reduction is also related to the issue of\n scientific explanation.\n For example, if a more fundamental theory fully reduces another\ntheory or even reduces several theories,\n unification\n (of some sort) results. The situation where a historically earlier\ntheory is reduced to a later theory is an intuitive case in which\n scientific progress\n might occur. Arguments against the existence of this type of\nhistorical reduction have maintained that terms occurring in both the\nprecursor and descendant theory have different meanings\n (\u201cincommensurability\u201d).\n This indicates that questions about reduction also connect to the\nmeaning of scientific terms and conceptual change. Therefore, accounts\nof reduction often involve commitments made about other notions and\ntheir adequacy depends in many cases on these related philosophical\ncommitments. This has led some philosophers to pursue an account of\nreduction in biology that is as uncommitted as possible regarding the\nprecise construal of general notions such as \u201claw\u201d and\n\u201cexplanation\u201d (Sarkar 1998, cf. Brigandt 2013a), or to\nspecifically highlight how a particular package of general notions\ntravels together and skews our perspective on the shape of epistemic\nreduction in scientific practice (Godfrey-Smith 2008).\n\nIn philosophy of biology, reduction involves questions about how\ndifferent biological disciplines and theories are related, and how\nbiology is connected to physics and chemistry (e.g., is biology\nautonomous, possessing its own theoretical principles, explanations,\nand methods?). Over the past four decades, discussion has concentrated\nprimarily on the question of whether classical genetics can\nbe reduced to\n molecular genetics\n and biochemistry. This discussion was motivated by the increasing\nsignificance of\n molecular biology\n within the life sciences (Morange 2020), and revolved around specific\naccounts of reduction in science, such as Nagel\u2019s (1961) model.\nA less central concern has been whether evolutionary biology and\necology are autonomous disciplines or reducible to molecular\nbiology (Beatty 1990, Brandon 1996, Dupr\u00e9 1993, Rosenberg\n2006). For example, a notable issue in evolutionary contexts is the\nrelationship between functional explanation\n (\u201cteleology\u201d)\n and causal-mechanistic explanation (Wouters 2005). The\n levels of selection\n debate includes questions about whether all evolutionary explanations\ncan be cast in terms of genes and whether selection operates primarily\nor exclusively on the genetic level (\u00c5gren 2021, Okasha 2006).\nThe main debate about reduction in genetics has lost some intensity as\nmany philosophers developed a skeptical consensus regarding the\npossibility of substantive theory reduction (but see Waters 1990).\nThis decline has been accompanied by increasing attention to models of\nexplanatory reduction (e.g., Kaiser 2015, Sarkar 1998, Weber 2005)\nacross a wider variety of domains in biology (e.g., development,\necology, evolution, cell biology, and neuroscience). For example, the\nquestion of whether developmental biology can be reduced to\ndevelopmental genetics and molecular biology has become salient due to\nrecent progress in developmental genetics and growing philosophical\ninterest in\n developmental biology\n (Love 2008b, Robert 2004, Rosenberg 1997, 2006, Weber 2022). Less\nattention has been given to the question of whether biology can be\nreduced to physics (but see Rosenberg 2006). This has been an issue of\nconcern to many biologists (e.g., Mayr 2004), both with respect to\nmethodology (e.g., the adequacy of analyzing a system by dissecting it\ninto component parts) and whether modes of explanation from physical\nscience are inherently inappropriate for biological science (Love and\nH\u00fcttemann 2011).\n\nDebates about reduction in biology have often been framed in terms of\n\u201creductionism\u201d vs. \u201canti-reductionism\u201d (or,\nmore archaically, \u201cmechanism\u201d versus\n\u201corganicism\u201d or \u201cvitalism\u201d). However, since\ndifferent models of reduction have been put forward, whether one takes\na reductionist or anti-reductionist stance about a particular\nbiological subdiscipline (e.g., classical genetics) depends on the\nnotion of \u201creduction\u201d being utilized (Wimsatt 1976b, Hull\n1979). Furthermore, this framing has tended to create a false\ndichotomy between two extreme positions: reductionism as the idea that\nmolecular biology can in principle fully explain all\nbiological facts\u2014making higher level biological theories\ndispensable\u2014and anti-reductionism as the idea that higher level\nbiological fields possess explanatory principles of their own and are\nfully autonomous in the sense of not benefiting from\nmolecular biology. A variety of middle (and orthogonal) ground exists\nbetween these extremes and has motivated the efforts seen in\nalternative research programs in philosophy of science that address\nquestions about the nature and status of interdisciplinarity, such as\nhow data, standards, or explanations are integrated across biological\nfields (see\n Section 5).\n Given that references to \u201creduction\u201d in different areas\nof biology pick out a variety of commitments in different contexts,\nwhich makes pronouncements of both the success and failure of\n\u201creduction\u201d legitimate, the traditional assumption that\nthere is a unique and global notion in need of explication is\nproblematic (H\u00fcttemann and Love\n 2011).[2]\n",
