    "main_text": "Quantum Chaos\n6. Quantum Chaos\n\nQuantum chaos, or quantum chaology as it is better called, is the\nstudy of the relationship between chaos in the macroscopic or\nclassical domain and the quantum domain. The implications of chaos in\nclassical physics for quantum systems have received some intensely\nfocused study, with questions raised about the actual existence of\nchaos in the quantum domain and the viability of the correspondence\nprinciple between classical and quantum mechanics to name the most\nprovocative.\n\n\nBefore looking at these questions, there is the thorny problem of\ndefining quantum chaos. The difficulties in establishing an agreed\ndefinition of quantum chaos are actually more challenging than for\nclassical chaos (\u00a71). Recall that there\nwere several subtleties involved in attempting to arrive at a\nconsensus definition of classical chaos. One important proposal for a\nnecessary condition is the presence of some form of stretching and\nfolding mechanism associated with a nonlinearity in the\nsystem. However, since Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is linear, quantum\nmechanics is a linear theory. This means that quantum states starting\nout initially close remain just as close (in Hilbert space norm)\nthroughout their evolution. So in contrast to chaos in classical\nphysics, there is no separation (exponential or otherwise) between\nquantum states under Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. The best candidates\nfor a necessary condition for chaos appear to be missing from the\nquantum domain.\n\n\nInstead researchers study the quantization of classical chaotic\nsystems and these studies are known as quantum chaology: \u201cthe\nstudy of semiclassical, but nonclassical, phenomena characteristic of\nsystems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaos\u201d (Berry 1989,\np. 335). It turns out that there are a number of remarkable behaviors\nexhibited by such quantized systems that are interesting in their own\nright. It is these behaviors that raise questions about what form\nchaotic dynamics might take in the quantum domain (if any) and the\nvalidity of the correspondence principle. Moreover, these studies\nreveal further evidence that the relationship between the quantum and\nclassical domains are subtle indeed.\n\n\nResearchers in quantum chaology have focused on universal\nstatistical properties that are independent of the quantum systems\nunder investigation. Furthermore, studies focus on so-called simple\nquantum systems (i.e., those that can be described by a finite number\nof parameters or finite amount of information). The kinds of\nstatistical properties studied in such systems include the statistics\nof energy levels and semi-classical structures of wave\nfunctions. These statistical properties are relevant for quantum state\ntransitions, ionization and other quantum phenomena found in atomic\nand nuclear physics, solid state physics of mesoscopic systems and even\nquantum information. Some typical systems studied are quantum\nbilliards (particles restricted to two-dimensional motions), the\nquantum kicked rotor, a single periodically driven spin and coupled\nspins. Often, iterated maps are used in investigating quantum chaos\njust as in classical chaos (\u00a71.2.5\nabove).\n\n\nBilliards are a particularly well-studied family of models. Think of a\nperfectly flat billiard table and assume that the billiard balls\nbounce off the edges of the table elastically. Such a model table at\nthe macroscopic scale of our experience where the balls and edges are\ncharacterized by classical mechanics is called a classical\nbilliard. Lots of analytic results have been worked out for\nclassical billiards so this is makes billiards a very attractive model\nto study. A chaotic billiard is a classical billiard where the\nconditions lead to chaotic behavior of the balls. There is a wealth of\nresults for chaotic billiards, too. Such analytical and computational\nriches have made quantum versions of billiards workhorses for studying\nquantum chaology as will be seen below. One can produce quantum\nbilliards by using Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation to describe\nparticles reflecting off the boundaries (where one specifies that the\nwave function for the particles is zero at a boundary), or one can\nstart with the equations describe a classical billiard and quantize\nthe observables (e.g., position and momentum) yielding quantized\nbilliards.\n\n\nTo organize the discussion, isolated systems, where the energy spectra\nare discrete, will be treated first followed by interacting systems,\nwhere energy spectra are continuous. Although whether the energy\nspectra are discrete or not is not crucial to quantum chaology,\nwhether a quantum system is isolated or not has been argued to be\npotentially important to whether chaos exists in the quantum realm.\n\n",
