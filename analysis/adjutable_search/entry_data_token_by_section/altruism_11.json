    "main_text": "Does altruism exist? || Does egoism exist?\n2.7 Does egoism exist?\n\nOne further point should be made about our reasons for supposing that\nthere is such a thing as altruism. Just as we can ask, \u201cwhat\nentitles us to believe that altruism exists?\u201d so we can ask:\n\u201cwhat entitles us to believe that egoism exists?\u201d Consider\nthe possibility that whenever we act for our own good, we are not\ndoing so only for our own sake, but also for the sake of someone else.\nOn what grounds are we entitled to reject that possibility?\n\nOnce again, the egoist might reply that it is an a priori\ntruth that all of our actions are ultimately motivated only by\nself-interest, but we have seen the weakness of the premises that\nsupport that argument. So, if the hypothesis that sometimes one acts\nonly for one\u2019s own sake is true, it must recommend itself to us\nbecause close observation of human behavior supports it. We must find\nactual cases of someone promoting his own good only for his\nown sake. It is no easier to be confident about such matters than it\nis easy to be confident that someone has acted out of purely\naltruistic motives. We realize that much of what we do for ourselves\nhas consequences for other people as well, and we care to some degree\nabout those other people. Perhaps our ultimate motivation always\nincludes an other-regarding component. It is more difficult to find\nevidence against that suggestion than one might have thought.\n\nTo take matters to an extreme, it might be suggested that our ultimate\nmotivation is always entirely other-regarding. According to this\nfar-fetched hypothesis, whenever we act for our own good, we do so not\nat all for our own sake, but always entirely for the sake of someone\nelse. The important point here is that the denial that altruism exists\nshould be regarded with as much suspicion as this contrary denial,\naccording to which people never act ultimately for their own good.\nBoth are dubious universal generalizations. Both have far\nless plausibility than the common sense assumption that people\nsometimes act in purely egoistic ways, sometimes in purely altruistic\nways, and often in ways that mix, in varying degrees, the good of\noneself and the good of others.\n",
