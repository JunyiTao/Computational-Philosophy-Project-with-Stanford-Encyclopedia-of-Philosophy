One such question is when to accept a\nhypothesis. In typical cases, the evidence is logically\ncompatible with multiple hypotheses, including hypotheses to which it\nlends little inductive support. Furthermore, scientists do not\ntypically accept only those hypotheses that are most probable given\ntheir data. When is a hypothesis likely enough to deserve\nacceptance?\n\n\nBayesians, such as Maher (1993), suggest that this decision be made\non expected utility grounds. Whether to accept a hypothesis is a\ndecision problem, with acceptance and rejection as acts. It can\nbe captured by the following decision matrix:\n\n\n\nstates\n\n\nhypothesis is true\nhypothesis is false\n\n\nacts\naccept\ncorrectly accept\nerroneously accept\n\n\nreject\nerroneously reject\ncorrectly reject\n\n\n\n\nOn Savage\u2019s definition, the expected utility of accepting the\nhypothesis is determined by the probability of the hypothesis, together\nwith the utilities of each of the four outcomes. (We can expect\nJeffrey\u2019s definition to agree with Savage\u2019s on the\nplausible assumption that, given the evidence in our possession, the\nhypothesis is probabilistically independent of whether we accept or\nreject it.) Here, the utilities can be understood as purely\nepistemic values, since it is epistemically valuable to believe\ninteresting truths, and to reject falsehoods.\n\n\nCritics of the Bayesian approach, such as Mayo (1996), object that\nscientific hypotheses cannot sensibly be given probabilities. \nMayo argues that in order to assign a useful probability to an event,\nwe need statistical evidence about the frequencies of similar\nevents. But scientific hypotheses are either true once and for\nall, or false once and for all\u2014there is no population of worlds\nlike ours from which we can meaningfully draw statistics. Nor can\nwe use subjective probabilities for scientific purposes, since this\nwould be unacceptably arbitrary. Therefore, the expected\nutilities of acceptance and rejection are undefined, and we ought to\nuse the methods of traditional statistics, which rely on comparing the\nprobabilities of our evidence conditional on each of the\nhypotheses.\n\n\nExpected utility theory also provides guidance about when to gather\nevidence. Good (1967) argues on expected utility grounds that it is\nalways rational to gather evidence before acting, provided that\nevidence is free of cost. The act with the highest expected utility\nafter the extra evidence is in will always be always at least as good\nas the act with the highest expected utility beforehand. \n\n\nIn epistemic decision theory, expected utilities are used to\nassess belief states as rational or irrational. If we think of belief\nformation as a mental act, facts about the contents of the agent\u2019s\nbeliefs as events, and closeness to truth as a desirable feature of\noutcomes, then we can use expected utility theory to evaluate degrees\nof belief in terms of their expected closeness to truth.  The entry\non epistemic utility arguments for\nprobabilism includes an overview of expected utility arguments for\na variety of epistemic norms, including conditionalization and the\nPrincipal Principle.\n\n",
