    "main_text": "Historical Accounts || Hilbert\n3.2 Hilbert\n\nOther contemporaries of Russell\u2019s also displayed deductivist\nleanings. Resnik classified Hilbert\u2019s work of around 1900 as a\n\u201cdeductivist period\u201d (1980: 105). However, Hilbert at the\ntime endorsed what can now be separated out as deductivism on the one\nhand and some form of proto-structuralism on the other. He made no\ndistinction between the two, as we would today, because he assumed\ncomplete axiomatisations and proof systems were available.\n\nConsider Hilbert\u2019s 1900 \u201cAbout the Concept of\nNumber\u201d. In the introduction, Hilbert declares that he intends\nto apply the axiomatic method, known from geometry, to the concept of\nnumber (1900a: 181). He contrasts the axiomatic method with the ad\nhoc approach usually found in the literature of the time. The\npurpose of his axiomatic approach is to achieve the \u201cfinal\npresentation and logical certainty of the content of our\nunderstanding\u201d (ibid). He begins by setting out eighteen axioms\nfor the real numbers. To give a flavour, the first axiom is\n\n\nFrom the number \\(a\\) and the number \\(b\\) results through\n\u201caddition\u201d a specific number \\(c\\), formally: \\(a + b =\nc\\) or \\(c = a + b\\). (1900a: 18)\n\n\nHilbert then asserts that propositions about the real numbers are only\nvalid (g\u00fcltig) if they can be proven from the set of\naxioms in a finite number of steps (1900a: 184).\n\nThe reason for this insistence is explained in his famous lecture to\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in the same year\n(published as \u201cMathematical Problems\u201d). Here Hilbert\nexpresses the \u201cabsolute conviction\u201d that any mathematical\nproblem, no matter how difficult, must be solvable \u201cthrough a\nfinite number of purely logical steps\u201d (1900b: 261). He\nmaintains that this conviction is shared by all mathematicians and is\na major source of motivation; but he also notes that we have no proof\nthat the finite-derivability claim is true (1900b: 262). Despite the\nabsence of such a proof, he takes this conviction to be the natural\nmodus operandi of the working mathematician. In\n\u201cMathematical Problems\u201d, Hilbert also maintains that, to\nthe extent that new concepts are introduced in mathematics\u2014say,\ndue to their usefulness in scientific explanations\u2014those\nconcepts need to be axiomatized to make them useful for deduction:\n\n\n[Their introduction] gives birth to the task for mathematics to\nresearch the principles associated with the new concept and then to\nfix them in a simple and complete axiom system in such a way that the\nnew concepts and their usability for deduction is in no way\ninferior to the old arithmetical concepts. (1900b: 259, our\ntranslation and emphasis)\n\n\nAt the same time as emphasising the importance of a deductive\nframework, Hilbert endorsed proto-structuralist ideas. He mentions\n\u201cthinking of a system of objects\u201d, saying we \u201ccall\nthose objects numbers\u201d and \u201cdenote them with a,\nb, c\u201d (1900a: 181). In his correspondence with\nFrege one year earlier, for example, Hilbert noted that\n\n\nE.g., instead of points, think of a system of love, law, chimney-sweep\n\u2026 which satisfies all axioms; then Pythagoras\u2019 theorem\nalso applies to these things. Any theory can always be applied to\ninfinitely many systems of basic elements. (Letter from 29 Dec 1899,\nFrege 1976 [1980: 42])\n\n\nHilbert moved fluidly between both deductivism and proto-structuralism\nby relying on the completeness assumption. For example, in his letter\nto Frege dated 29 December 1899, he stated that if the axioms in an\naxiom system do not contradict one another,\n\n\nthen they are true, and the things defined by the axioms exist. This\nfor me is the criterion of truth and existence. (Letter from 29 Dec\n1899, Frege 1976 [1980: 42])\n\n\nNote that Hilbert does not maintain that the axioms are true if they\nhave a model\u2014consistency and model-existence are equivalent only\nif the axiom system is complete.\n\nHilbert at the time, then, was firmly committed to two views. Both\nunderstand mathematical claims as true in virtue of implication from\naxioms. One is that mathematical validity amounts to mathematical\nprovability with a finite number of steps from a finite number of\naxioms. The second is that mathematics is not about specific objects\nbut that mathematical truth (in a particular domain) is defined by the\naxioms.\n\nWe can also observe differences between Russell\u2019s and\nHilbert\u2019s varieties of deductivism. By asserting that\n\n\nall the entities that occur in mathematics can be defined in terms of\nthose that occur in the above twenty premisses,\n\n\nRussell closely links deductivism to the claim that any non-logical\nvocabulary in axioms and theorems is ultimately eliminable (1903\n[2009: xliii]). Thus Russell combines deductivism with a core tenet of\nlogicism, namely that non-logical terms be definable by logical\nones.\n\nFor the turn-of-the-century Hilbert by contrast, numerals and other\nnon-logical terms (as we could call them) in our deductions remain\nprimitive. But although not eliminable, they are generic. Hilbert asks\nus to imagine \u201ca system of things, which we will call\nnumbers\u201d (Hilbert 1900a: 181). The axioms then provide a\n\u201cprecise and complete description of numbers\u201d\n\u201cmutual relations\u201d (Hilbert 1900a: 181). For as he\nmemorably put it, \u201cone must be able to say at all\ntimes\u2014instead of points, straight lines, and\nplanes\u2014tables, chairs and beer mugs\u201d (Kennedy 1972: 133).\nHere Hilbert\u2019s stance effectively derives from Pasch. Pasch had\ncalled his method \u201ca formalism\u201d and maintained that\nmathematical proofs must remain valid if the basic concepts are\nreplaced throughout \u201cby any concepts or by meaningless\nsigns\u201d (Schlimm 2010: 103).\n",
