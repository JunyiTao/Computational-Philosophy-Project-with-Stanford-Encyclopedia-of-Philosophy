    "main_text": "\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the field devoted to building\nartificial animals (or at least artificial creatures that \u2013 in\nsuitable contexts \u2013 appear to be animals) and, for\nmany, artificial persons (or at least artificial creatures that\n\u2013 in suitable contexts \u2013 appear to be\n persons).[1]\n Such goals immediately ensure that AI is a discipline of considerable\ninterest to many philosophers, and this has been confirmed (e.g.) by\nthe energetic attempt, on the part of numerous philosophers, to show\nthat these goals are in fact un/attainable. On the constructive side,\nmany of the core formalisms and techniques used in AI come out of, and\nare indeed still much used and refined in, philosophy: first-order\nlogic and its extensions; intensional logics suitable for the modeling\nof doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning; inductive logic,\nprobability theory, and probabilistic reasoning; practical reasoning\nand planning, and so on. In light of this, some philosophers conduct\nAI research and development as philosophy. \n\nIn the present entry, the history of AI is briefly recounted, proposed\ndefinitions of the field are discussed, and an overview of the field\nis provided. In addition, both philosophical AI (AI pursued as and out\nof philosophy) and philosophy of AI are discussed, via\nexamples of both. The entry ends with some de rigueur\nspeculative commentary regarding the future of AI. \n",
