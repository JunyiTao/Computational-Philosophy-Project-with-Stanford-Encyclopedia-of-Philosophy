If this were true, then it would be\ncontradictory to label something as pseudoscience at one but not\nanother point in time. Hence, after showing that creationism is in\nsome respects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th century,\none author maintained that \u201cif such an activity was describable\nas science then, there is a cause for describing it as science\nnow\u201d (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based on a fundamental\nmisconception of science. It is an essential feature of science that\nit methodically strives for improvement through empirical testing,\nintellectual criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A\nstandpoint or theory cannot be scientific unless it relates adequately\nto this process of improvement, which means as a minimum that\nwell-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are\naccepted. The practical demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for\nthe simple reason that science itself is not timeless.\n\nNevertheless, the mutability of science is one of the factors that\nrenders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult.\nDerksen (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why\ndemarcation is sometimes difficult: science changes over time, science\nis heterogenous, and established science itself is not free of the\ndefects characteristic of pseudoscience.\n",
