    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || Knowledge and Questions\n4.3 Knowledge and Questions\n\nThe interplay between questions and propositions is an important\nfactor in driving reasoning, communication, and general processes of\ninvestigation (Hintikka 2007; Hintikka, Halonen, & Mutanen 2002).\nIndeed, \n\n\n[s]cientific investigation and explanation proceed in part through the\nposing and answering of questions, and human-computer interaction is\noften structured in terms of queries and answers. (from the SEP entry\non\n questions\n by Cross & Roelofsen 2018)\n\n\nBut then, what is the relationship between an agent\u2019s knowledge\nand her questions? Maybe more important: given that different agents\nmight be posing different questions (i.e., they might be interested in\ndifferent issues), what is the relationship between the knowledge of\ndifferent agents?\n\nThe proposal of Boddy (2014) and Baltag, Boddy, and Smets (2018)\nstudies these concerns (then also studying what the \u2018real\u2019\ncommon and distributed knowledge of a group is). Their model (based on\nthe epistemic issue model introduced in van Benthem &\nMinica 2012) assumes that agents have not only their individual\nknowledge, but also their individual issues: the topics that\neach one of them has put on the table, which determine their\nindividual agenda on what is currently under investigation. On the\nsyntactic side, besides the standard knowledge modality \\((K_i\\) for\neach agent i), there is also a modality \\(Q_{i}\\varphi\\), read\nas \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) can be known solely based on learnable\nanswers to i\u2019s questions\u201d. In other words,\n\\(Q_a\\) describes the maximum knowledge agent a can acquire,\ngiven her questions and the answers that are learnable for her. Thus,\nas a principle, if a knows \\(\\varphi\\), she can know it solely\nbased on answers to her question(s): \n\\[\nK_{a}\\varphi \\rightarrow Q_{a}\\varphi\n\\]\n\n\nMore interesting is the relationship between agent a\u2019s\nknowledge and that of other agent b: in order for an agent to\nconsider any potential knowledge, such knowledge must be relevant for\nher in the sense that she can distinguish it as a possible answer to\none of her questions. In other words, \n\n\n[a]gents are therefore only able to coherently represent the knowledge\nof others [\u2026] if the fact that they (the others) possess this\nknowledge [\u2026] is relevant to them. (Boddy 2014: 28) \n\n\nThus, \u201cif b knows something that is relevant to a,\nthen it is relevant to a that b knows this\u201d and\n\n\n\nif b can know (given her issue) anything that is relevant to\na, then this fact (that b\u2019s potential knowledge\nincludes potential knowledge of a) is itself relevant to\na. \n\n\nIn symbols, \n\\[\n    K_{b}Q_{a}\\varphi \\rightarrow Q_{a} K_{b}\\varphi \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad Q_{b} Q_{a}\\varphi \\rightarrow Q_{a}Q_{b}\\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nA more in-depth discussion about the consequences of adding the\nagent\u2019s issues to the picture (including alternative definitions\nfor the group\u2019s distributed and common knowledge) can be found\nin the above references.\n",
