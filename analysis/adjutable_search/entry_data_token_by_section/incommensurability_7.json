For\nexample, he used it to characterize the transition from the Greek\narchaic, aggregate worldview of Homer to the substance world-view of\nthe Pre-Socratics (1975, 261-269), and thereafter in a very broad\nsense, discussing incommensurable frameworks of thought and action\n(1975, 271), incommensurability in the domain of perceptions (1975,\n225, 271), incommensurable discoveries and attitudes (1975, 269) and\nincommensurable paradigms (1981b [1970], 131\u2013161), where such\nincommensurability involves the suspension of some of the universal\nprinciples of the received view. Feyerabend characterized this wider\nnotion of incommensurability as a historical, anthropological thesis\n(1975, 271), but also applied it to different stages of the\ndevelopment of thought and perception in the individual (1975, 274).\nHe also further developed his notion of incommensurability, claiming\nthat it involves major conceptual changes of both \u2018overt\u2019\nand \u2018covert classifications\u2019 (in Whorff\u2019s sense), so\nthat incommensurability is difficult to explicitly define, and can\nonly be shown (1975, 224\u2013225). Still later, Feyerabend argued\nthat \u2018potentially every culture is all cultures\u2019,\napparently retracting a wider, cultural notion of incommensurability\n(Feyerabend 1994).\n",
