However, at the age of 60 (if Pablo de Santa Maria is a\nreliable source) after years of hesitation, he became a Neo-Platonic\nChristian, making him one of the very few philosophers (much less\nphilosopher-rabbis) to change his philosophical opinion (and religion)\nduring the Middle Ages. The majorities of his works are primarily\npolemical, and try to convince his former fellow Jews to become\nChristian, as he did. However, in his polemical writings, Abner built\nan original philosophical critique of both traditional Judaism and the\nAristotelian (and Maimonidean) philosophical interpretation of\nJudaism. Another part of his philosophical aim was a very radical\ninterpretation of Christianity aimed at convincing his Jewish audience\nthat his Christianity was superior to traditional and philosophical\nJudaism. Abner was one of the first philosophical and scientific\ncritics of Aristotle, as well as one of the more radical Neo-Platonic\nthinkers of Christianity during the Middle Ages.

Life\n\nThere are not many sources on the life of Abner. The majority of the\nsources are autobiographical passages in his works (especially\nMostrador de Justicia). Abner was born around 1260, probably\nin the Jewish community of Burgos, one of the major communities in\nCastile. While still Jewish, Abner worked as a book trader, a rabbi,\nand he may have been a physician as well. During this time he was the\nhead of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if\nthis yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of\nstudents that met in his home. We know from a former pupil, Rabbi\nIsaac Pulgar, and from the sources that he utilizes in his works, that\nduring the Jewish period of his life, Abner was a philosopher, being a\npart of the Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy at the\ntime.\n\nIn spite of the majority opinion of modern\n scholars,[1]\n Abner probably was not a Kabbalist before his conversion to\nChristianity. This mistake is based essentially on two sources: the\nfact that some of Abner\u2019s arguments for the Trinity and Incarnation\ncan be interpreted as deriving from Kabbalistic sources, and the\nexistence of another Rabbi Abner (not a common name for Jews of his\ntime), a Kabbalist whom Rabbi Isaac of Acre cited many times. In my\nopinion, Abner\u2019s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based\non Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard\nChristian scriptural\n background.[2]\n Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important\nKabbalistic\n sources.[3]\n His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner\u2019s (the one\nthat Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors\ndo not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources,\nwith Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish\nphilosophical and traditional rabbinic\n corpuses.[4]\n almost all of Rabbi Abner\u2019s sources are taken from the commentary of\nNahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never\nquoted. \n\nThe beginning of Abner\u2019s doubts about Judaism began with the incident\nof a false messiah in Avila in 1295. According to Abner, the Jews of\nthe community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to\nwelcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a\nrainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who\nwitnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled\nin Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing\nexile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of\nfeeling ambivalent (i.e., around 1317) Abner wrote about his first\nrevelation in a\n dream.[5]\n In his dream he saw a man that told him to be \u201ca teacher of\nrighteousness\u201d (mostrador de justicia, not\ncoincidentally the name of Abner\u2019s main book) and to bring his people\nto freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the\nJewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream\nwherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the\nclothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the\nChristian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around\n1320/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the\ncollegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation\nof Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the\nconclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be\nsaved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre\nand that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North\nCastile around 1336\u20131339. There was a public disputation between\nAbner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335\u20131336 on the\nsubject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute\nwas the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish\nprayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner\nprobably died in 1347 or later.\n2. Works\n\nAbner\u2019s works may be divided into three different categories: polemic,\nscientific and philosophic.\n\nPolemic works: Mostradorde Justicia is the earliest\nand most important work of those writings of Abner that have survived.\nOnly a translation (probably by Abner himself) in Castilian exists\ntoday, whereas the original Hebrew was lost. The book starts with a\nbrief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his\nconversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part\nof the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew\n(the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of\npolemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a\nChristian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to\nbelieve in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten\nchapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of\nparagraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of\nthe\n debate.[6]\n\nSummary of the chapters:\n\nI.\n Abner indicated which books could be used as a basis for proof\nduring polemic debates. In this chapter the master and the rebel agree\nthat both sides may bring in proofs from philosophical arguments.\n II.\n Abner\u2019s proof of the giving of a new law upon the coming of the\nMessiah.\n III.\n An explanation and justification for the revelation of a new\nlaw.\n IV.\n The arguments of those who deny that the messiah was to come and\ndie and bring atonement for the sin of Adam; and what refutes those\narguments.\n V.\n The arguments of the rebel which contradict the master\u2019s position\non the Trinity and the Incarnation of the person of the Son in the\nhuman form of the Christ, and the masters answer to those\narguments.\n VI.\n The rebel\u2019s arguments against incarnation of the divinity in the\nhuman form of the Christ and how the master tries to refute those\narguments.\n VII.\n An attempt to prove that the hope that the Jews have in the\ncoming of the prophesied Christ is a false hope, and that Jesus of\nNazareth was the Christ who came according to the time that was\nindicated for the coming of the Christ in the books of the prophets\nand the sages.\n VIII.\n Arguments of the Jews that the Christ has not yet come, which is\nthe basis for their claim that the Christians are the people of Edom\nor Esau, which was to be destroyed and to fall before the coming of\nthe Christ; and an attempt to refute those arguments.\n IX.\n An attempt to prove that the hope that the Jews have for the\ncoming of the Christ at any time is a false hope, and for this reason\nthe Jews are still in exile from the Land of Israel.\n X.\n Abner\u2019s attempt to prove that the Christians, according to the\ncustoms and commandments which they have in their laws, should be\ncalled the Holy Nation of Israel, and that the Jews, according to the\ncustoms and commandments which they have in the laws of the Talmud are\nnot fit to return to the Land of Israel; and the rebel\u2019s attempt to\nrefute those arguments.\n\n\nResponses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book\nsurvived both in the original\n Hebrew[7]\n and in a Castilian\n translation.[8]\n This book is a response to the different letters that Abner\u2019s only\nknown student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and\nChristian\n writings.[9]\n Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book\ncontains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an\nintroduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his\nphilosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2)\nthe Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and\nquotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary\nexistence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof\nof the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and\nother Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which\ntakes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had\nalready come and that Christianity is true.\n\nWhile Abner\u2019s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are\ngenerally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia,\nthe philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of\nthe Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular\nJewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be\nsaved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless\nand are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only\nthe people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence\nafter death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these\nphilosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of\nChristianity. Parts of Abner\u2019s critique of Jewish philosophers in this\nbook most probably influenced Crescas.\n\nLibro de la Ley (Book of the Law). This work\nsurvived only\n fragmentally[10]\n in Castilian. The major argument of Abner in this book is that the\nJewish people forgot the secrets of the Torah, which are manifested by\nthe Christian doctrines, especially the Trinity.\n\nSefer Teshuvot ha-Meshubot (The Book of Responses to the\nApostasies) exists only in\n Hebrew.[11]\n There are three polemic\n letters[12]\n that deal especially with scriptural arguments on the subject of the\ncoming of the\n messiah.[13]\n3. The Trinity and Incarnation\n\nThe two major subjects of the philosophical polemical works of Abner\nare the Trinity and Incarnation. Abner had an original view on the\nTrinity. In his opinion, one can prove philosophically the reality of\nthe\n Trinity.[14]\n He claimed that only the division of the divine source of the world\ncan explain the diversity of the world. The infinite force of God (the\nfather) would burn the finite matter of the world if it were not for\nsome \u201ctransformer\u201d that adapted the divine force to the\nfinitude of matter (the son). Abner distinguished between two parts of\nthe son. The superior son is part of the transcendent divinity. The\ninferior son is the divine essence in all the different parts of the\nworld. The transformer of the divine force and essence is the superior\nson.\n\nRegarding the theory of the divine attributes, Abner also had an\noriginal opinion. He distinguished between the attributes that are the\nessence of God and the attributes that are essential to God. The\nattributes of the essence of God divide themselves only within the\npersonas of the Trinity. The rest of the attributes are only essential\nto God (and could be attributed to any one of the personas). This\ndivision of the divine attributes influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas,who\nlater influenced Spinoza.\n\nAbner\u2019s opinion on Incarnation was also very original. According to\nAbner, the essence of God is in the entire world. The world is\ncomposed only of corrupted matter and of divine essence in different\ndegrees of purity. Even the most corrupted matter has inside itself\nsome divine essence. The divine essence gives the corporeal form to\nmatter and produces in it its dimensions. The uniqueness of a human\nbeing is the capacity to purify one\u2019s matter, thereby reaching a\nhigher degree of divine essence. According to Abner, what made Jesus\nunique was that he was born of the highest matter, enabling him to\nunite with the highest degree of divine essence that a human can\nattain. Abner thought that the superior son does not incarnate in this\nworld. Jesus was only the highest degree of the inferior son that is\npresent in the essences of the entire world.\n\nThe opinion of Abner on Incarnation is closely related to his view of\nthe doctrine of Original Sin. In Abner\u2019s opinion, the reason for the\noriginal sin was Adam\u2019s lack of comprehension. Adam thought that his\nintellect, which is an incarnation of divinity in people, was God, and\nhe therefore wrongly concluded that he was God. In order to fix Adam\u2019s\nerror, humanity needed the Torah of Moses, which emphasized the unity\nof God in an exaggerated form and therefore explained (somewhat\ninaccurately) that God does not incarnate in the World at all. Only\nafter this critical step, humanity was able to understand that, though\nthere is divinity in humans, this divinity is not an independent God,\nbut rather a part of the divine essence in the whole world. The Law of\nMoses that came to purify the world from idolatry has some problems.\nIt does not enable the full emancipation of humanity from sin and\nerror. Abner claimed that the negation of the incarnation of God in\nthe world leads to negating the possibility of life after death. The\npossibility of life after death comes from understanding the\nincarnation of divinity in all humans. Negating life after death\ncauses immorality. The Torah has to put up with all these inaccuracies\nin order to achieve its main goal, which is taking humanity out of the\nsin of idolatry (by believing that God is one). The outcome, though\nbetter than its predecessor, is ultimately a lost situation which\nhumanity cannot overcome on its own. For that reason, God sent Jesus\n(who was born with a higher degree of matter and divine essence). Due\nto the divinity within Jesus, his miracles and his resurrection,\npeople are able to understand that within everything in the world\nthere is some divine essence that is part of the inferior son, and\nthat the origin of all the divinity in the world is the superior son.\nThis understanding enables salvation from the original sin and\nrepresents a true understanding of the relation between God and the\nworld. The role of the sacramentental Mass is to remind us of the\ndivine aspect of Jesus\u2019 essence, as well as of all the miracles that\nJesus performed and to continue their influence in our present\ntime.\n\nWe see that this opinion regarding the Trinity and Incarnation\ncontradict the official dogma of the Catholic Church at the time of\nAbner. In his opinion, the incarnation of divinity in Jesus did not\nbypass the regular process of the emanation of the divine essence in\nthe world. Rather, the manifestation of Jesus represented the pinnacle\nof incarnation of divinity, which, though indeed present in the entire\nworld, yet in Jesus occurred in the purest form possible. This opinion\nof Abner, similar to his other philosophical views, was a part of the\nradical Neo-Platonic interpretation of Christianity. The difference\nbetween him and the other Neo-Platonic Christian philosophers, like\nMaster Eckard, is the different sources from which they were\ninfluenced. Abner did not utilize the traditional Neo-Platonic\nChristian sources, like Dionysius the Areopagite. We do not see in any\npart of his work that he was aware of the existence of these sources.\nOn the other hand, Abner did utilize some Arabic and Jewish sources.\nThe origin of his uncommon position on Christianity is found in his\nopposition to the common Aristotelian-Maimonidean-Averroist trend of\nJewish philosophy. Abner, similar to Spinoza after him, thought that\nthe explanations of these thinkers on the question of the creation of\nthe world by a perfect God were not sufficient and ultimately\ninaccurate. In place of these responses, Abner proposed his radical\ninterpretation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, an\ninterpretation that was uninfluenced by the theological Christian\ntradition. \n4. Determinism\n\nOne of the more important philosophical opinions of Abner was his\ndeterministic\n view.[15]\n Abner devoted his book Ofrenda de Zelos (Minhat\nKena\u2019ot in the original lost Hebrew text), along with other\nworks that have since been lost, to the question of determinism and\nfree\n will.[16]\n In the beginning of this book, Abner describes the opinion of his\nformer pupil Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, who denies God\u2019s foreknowledge of\nhuman decisions. After the explication of this opinion and its\nnegation, Abner explains his deterministic opinion. Abner believed\nthat people have free will in a limited sense, but act in a determined\nway in the broader sense. People are free in their relation to\nthemselves, meaning that if a person is separated from the causes that\ninfluence him or her (e.g., education, society\u2019s influences) while\ndebating between two options, one is then really free to choose either\nof the two options. In this specific case a person can then utilize\nhis or her will and choose freely between the two options. However, if\none takes into account all the causes that influence his or her will,\nwe may conclude that these causes limits that person\u2019s will to only\none of the two options. In the opinion of Abner, people are like wax,\nas follows: Wax may be melted and sculpted into many different shapes.\nHowever, the person who sculpts the wax determines its present form as\nonly one of those options. The same is true about people: In\nthemselves, they have the ability to choose between different\npossibilities, but their relation to the outside world determines\ntheir choices. We can see from this example how strong the determinist\nview of Abner was. It is important to note that Abner defines the will\nof people as an accord between the attractive force and the\nimagination, two forces common to humans and animals.\n\nAbner explains in the same way the meaning of possibility and\naccident. Things are only possible in their relation to themselves. In\nrelation to the entire world and its causality, everything is truly\ndetermined. Accidents are only accidents relative to the seeming\nunlikelihood of their occurrence. However, relative to all the causal\nprocesses of the world, we see that even in the most unusual of\ncircumstances the occurrence of what appears to be an accident in fact\nhad to happen. In short, there are no accidents (according to the\npopular meaning of accident) for Abner.\n\nThis deterministic description of the world (based on rational\narguments) resolves the theological problem of the contradiction\nbetween the free will of people and the foreknowledge of God. In the\nopinion of Abner free will does not really exist. For him, God is the\nfirst cause; He knows all the laws of the world and therefore knows\neverything that He has determined.\n\nThis deterministic description leads to two theological problems. The\nfirst is why God sent commandments to people who cannot truly decide\nwhether to obey them or disobey them. The second question that arises\nis how people can receive reward or punishment for actions and\ndecisions that they do not really have any control over? Abner answers\nthe second question by explaining that forbidden things are naturally\nbad. The punishment of the sinner is not a special act of divine\nprovidence; rather it is the natural consequence of his bad action.\nThis leads us to the answer to the first question. According to Abner,\nthe goal of the Torah is to influence people to do what is right. The\nTorah and prophets (and God who sent them) act in the world in\nconformity to His nature. The only way to influence someone to do\nsomething is to give him enough causes to do it. The Torah is only\nanother cause that influences people to do what is good. Abner\ncompares reward and punishment to a father that obligates his son to\ntake medication. The medicine will always work even if the son takes\nit unhappily. The same is true with regard to all actions of people.\nWhen people do what is right, they believe they will receive a reward,\nwhile if they do what is wrong, they believe they will receive a\npunishment\u2014even if they do not essentially have the choice to do\nanything else. \n\nIt is interesting to note that this philosophical book that Abner\nwrote at the end of his life, more than twenty years after his\nconversion, is almost without Christian\n references.[17]\n In spite of this, the book is full of references to Jewish sources,\nincluding the Talmud and quotations of Jewish authorities like\n Maimonides.[18]\n We see that Abner, even many years after his conversion, wrote to the\nJewish community and was part of the internal Jewish debate about the\nquestion of determinism. In fact, Abner is the first medieval Jewish\nphilosopher to argue for a deterministic explanation of the world. His\nopinion influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (who paraphrased an important\npart of Ofrenda de Zelos in his major philosophical work\nThe Light of the\n Lord[19]),\n and through him, Spinoza. Some Jewish philosophers, like Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar, Rabbi Mosses from Narbonne, and Rabbi Josef Ben Shem\n Tov[20]\n respond explicitly to the determinist opinion of Abner, such that\nthere is no doubt that his opinion had a major influence on the\ninternal Jewish debate on the question of free will throughout the\n14th and 15th centuries. \n5. Critics of the Aristotelian science\n\nAs we stated before, the major work of science of Abner (the New\nPhilosophy) is lost. We can still try to reconstruct some of his\nscientific opinions through some parts of his other works,\nspecifically the existing work Meyasher Aqob, Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar\u2019s brief summary of the lost work, and some scientific passages\nin Mostrador de\n Justicia.[21]\n\nThe first interesting opinion of Abner is his view on prime matter.\nAbner denied a necessary link, which the Aristotelians affirmed,\nbetween bodies and accidents (magnitude, weight, quantity, etc.),\nmaintaining that a body untainted by all these accidents can\nnonetheless have actual existence. He explicated his view in the\ndogmatic context of the question of the rite of\n Mass.[22]\n The rebel\u2019s main philosophical arguments against the Mass are as\nfollows: (1) How can several bodies occupy the same place? (2) How can\nJesus\u2019 body be in the bread and wine without changing them? (3) How\ncan the same body be two different materials at the same time? (4) How\ncan one debase Jesus by eating and digesting him? At the start of his\nanswer Abner emphasizes that the Mass is miraculous. Nevertheless, he\ndoes go on to offer a scientific explanation of transubstantiation.\nFor Abner, everybody has a layer of pure divine existence, to which\nare superadded other forms and accidents; but if the body is stripped\nof all of these accretions it will be reduced to the original divine\nsubstance only. In this state the body will have no boundary,\nquantity, or weight to occupy the universe, and consequently is\ninfinite. This body is the foundation of the entire material world,\nand normally\u2014with the exception of the sacrament of the Mass and\nIncarnation\u2014it does not exist without accidents (at least not in\nthe sublunary world). This matter is identified with the flesh of\nJesus, which has divine existence only, which means that Jesus\u2019 body\nis identified with prime matter.\n\nThe above description eliminates for Abner all of the difficulties\nposed by the rebel. The problem of the co-presence of two bodies in\none place is eliminated, because all bodies, once they have been\nstripped of their form and accidents, incorporate the infinite body of\nJesus, which fills the entire universe. After these forms have been\nremoved, the bread and wine are identified with Jesus\u2019 body. The very\nsame principle eliminates the problem of the simultaneous existence of\nJesus\u2019 body in several places, since his body fills the entire\nuniverse and transcends all definitions of place. Because his body\nalso transcends the definition of quantity, the problem of limited\nquantity is removed as well.\n\nAnother subject about which Abner critiques Aristotelian science is\nthe definition of place and the relation between place and body. In\nthe thought of Aristotle, the definition of place is \u2018the limit\nof the encompassing body\u2019. In his opinion, place has an\nimportant role in movement. The definition of a natural movement is\nthe movement of a body to its natural place in the world. Aristotle\nexplains that both the natural place attracts the body and that the\nbody moves on his own to its natural place.\n\nAbner distinguishes between the physical object and extension or\ndimension. According to Abner, dimension is \u201ca simple and subtle\nquantity detached from all movable bodies\u201d; in other words, it\nis space, independent of any physical body. Dimension is measurable\nper se, and is not linked to what occupies it. Nevertheless, Abner\u2019s\ndefinition of place is still associated with body: \u201cplace\u201d\nis the dimension occupied by a body, and it is the body that turns it\ninto \u201cplace.\u201d According to Abner, the movement of bodies\nis not due to their being attracted to some place where they must rest\nbefore resuming their movement; rather, they move because of the\ninteraction of several forces, quite independent of any particular\nplace. A body that is thrown upward rises, but if it suddenly begins\nto fall because of an opposing force, there would not be a moment of\nrest between the two opposing motions.\n\nThus Abner dismisses Aristotle\u2019s concept that a body is attracted to\nits natural place. Different places are not characterized by different\nqualities (inasmuch as all places are equal and are merely points in\nspace). Hence a body has no cause to move to a particular place and no\nplace is a final cause of its motion.\n\nWe know from Rabbi Isaac Pulgar that Abner also criticized the\nopinions of Aristotle on the possibility of a void and argues for the\nexistence of voids in his lost scientific book The New\nPhilosophy. Because of the influence of Abner on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas, we can assume that his criticism is closely related to the\ncriticism of Crescas in the beginning of the first speech of Or\nHashem\n\nAbner wrote his criticism of Artistotelian science at the beginning of\nthe 14th century, approximately the same time that Ockham\nwrote his criticism of this science. In the writing and the thought of\nAbner we do not see any kind of influence of Ockham or of other late\nscholastics (the only scholastic philosopher that he cites is Thomas\nAquinas and there are no quotations from Christian sources on a\nscientific subject). It is interesting to note that the systematic\ncriticism of Aristotelian science started approximately at the same\ntime in the Jewish milieu (with the writings of Abner) and in the\nChristian milieu, with probably no relation one to the other.\n\nAbner\u2019s criticism of Aristotelian science had an important influence\non Crescas\u2019s thought, and through him to Pico Della Mirandola and\ngeneral Western philosophy.\n6. The influence of Abner\n\nOne must distinguish between two kinds of influence Abner had. Abner\ninfluenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until\nthe end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de\nEspina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria,\nutilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than\nfive Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical\narguments of\n Abner.[23]\n Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no\nphilosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian\nparticipants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish\nsources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in\ntheir content were very different from the official Catholic\ndogma.\n\nThe second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely\nphilosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical\ninfluence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not\nsee that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates\nin any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast,\nin the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact\nuntil the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic\nopinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the\nextensive number of works written on this subject in the\n14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers.\nFor the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The\nmost impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas (died in 1410/1411). Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher\nduring the end of the Middle Ages. Despite their opposite positions in\nthe Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more\nphilosophical anti-Christian\n works),[24]\n Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of\nAbner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of\nthe essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism\nof Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas\nmolded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources.
