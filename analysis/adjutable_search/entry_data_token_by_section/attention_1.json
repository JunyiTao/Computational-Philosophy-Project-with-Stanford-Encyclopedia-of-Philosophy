    "main_text": "Historical Overview || Berkeley: Attention and Abstraction\n1.2 Berkeley: Attention and Abstraction\n\nA quite different explanatory role is assigned to attention in Bishop\nBerkeley\u2019s Principles of Human Knowledge, although here\nagain we find that it is in order to remove an epistemological glitch\nthat the notion of attention is brought in. In the Introduction to\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge Berkeley rejects Locke\u2019s\nclaim that there exist such things as Abstract Ideas. But Berkeley\nretains Locke\u2019s commitment to the core empiricist claim that the\nthinking of thoughts is always a matter of handling ideas received\nfrom experience. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that it is\nnot possible to think about abstractia, but Berkeley realizes that\nthat conclusion is unacceptable. It is, as he says, perfectly possible\nto think about the properties of triangles in general.\n\nIn the second edition of the Principles Berkeley added a\ncouple of sentences to the Introduction that make it clear that it is\nattention and, in particular, the withholding of attention, that is\nsupposed to explain the possibility of thinking about abstractia\nwithout the need to postulate Abstract Ideas. These added sentences\ntell us that:\n\n[It] must be acknowledged that a man may consider a figure merely\nas triangular, without attending to the particular qualities of the\nangles or relations of the sides. So far he may abstract, but\nthis will never prove that he can frame an abstract general,\ninconsistent idea of a triangle. (1710, Introduction to 2nd edn.\n\u00a716. emphasis added)\n\n\nIn these sentences Berkeley is not attempting to elaborate a theory of\nattention. He says nothing more about the idea that attention might\nenable thought about abstractia. It is nonetheless clear that he\nrequires attention to play an important role in his picture of the\nmind.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s idea that attention and abstraction are linked was\ntaken up in the second half of the nineteenth century by William\nHamilton. Hamilton did not, however, think that the link between\nattention and abstraction provided the starting point for an\nexplanation of attention, nor of abstraction. That is because he took\nit that the relationship between the two phenomena was too intimate to\nbe explanatory. He writes that:\n\nAttention and Abstraction are only the same process viewed in\ndifferent relations. They are, as it were, the positive and negative\npoles of the same act. (1876, 88)\n\n",
