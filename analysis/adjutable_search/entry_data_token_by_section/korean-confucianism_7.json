    "main_text": "Confucian Reactions to Early Catholicism || Matteo Ricci and Reactions to Western Theology\n6.1 Matteo Ricci and Reactions to Western Theology\n\nThe time frame of the Horak debate also coincided with Catholic texts\nbeing read by Korean Neo-Confucian philosophers. The most important\ntext from this period was Tianzhu shiyi\n(\u5929\u4e3b\u5be6\u7fa9; K. Ch\u014fnju sir\u016di)\n[The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven], which had a great impact in\nKorea after being read by scholars there (see Ricci 1985). It was\nactually written by Matteo Ricci (1552\u20131610), an Italian Jesuit\nmissionary who had lived for many years (and died) in China. Ricci\nweaved in the mediaeval Scholastic philosophy of his European\ntradition into a newly enlarged tapestry including his newly\ndiscovered Confucian ideas. He retraced the trajectory of\nNeo-Confucianism, revealing its Buddhist and Daoist legacy that has\nbeen carefully coloured over by Zhu Xi, whose ideas also dictated how\nKoreans received the Confucian canon, something that clearly irked the\nKorean scholars. These ideas and messages had serious repercussions in\nKorea, where, as Seoh Munsang (1977: 46\u201347) points out, the\nintellectual milieu had retained Zhu Xi\u2019s orthodoxy where\nmetaphysical speculation was \u201cstill a vital force polarising the\ni and ki schools\u201d.\n\nYi Sugwang (1563\u20131628) provides a short analysis of\nRicci\u2019s text, which is of value as it is the earliest commentary\non the text in Korea. He remarked that Ricci\u2019s God,\nTianzhu (pronounced Ch\u2019\u014fnju in Korean),\nhad created the world, hence was worshiped and praised, something he\ncriticised as he clearly understood Principle to be behind\nall things. He incorrectly indicates that Ricci, like Confucians,\nasserts that human nature is originally good: Ricci had actually\nsuggested that the Confucians had no unanimity of position in this\nregard, as Mencius had said it was good, but Xunzi regarded it as\nevil\u2014a point clearly avoided by Korean Neo-Confucian scholars\nalmost entirely (Yi 2000: 61). Yi Ik (1681\u20131763), who headed one\nof Chos\u014fn\u2019s many scholarly factions, the Namin\n(Southern) faction, in more recent times described as a proponent of\nSirhak \u201cpractical\u201d thought, also compiled a wide\nrange of encyclopedic texts and wrote commentaries on the Confucian\ncanon too. He engaged more intellectually with Ricci\u2019s ideas in\nhis critique entitled Ch\u2019\u014fnju sir\u016di-bal\n(\u5929\u4e3b\u5be6\u7fa9\u8dcb) [Reactions Against\nTianzhu zhiyi] (Kim Shin-ja [ed.] 1987: 22\u201323). Yi Ik,\nwho was also a follower of T\u2019oegye\u2019s metaphysics and wrote\ntreatises on the Four-Seven debate such as Sach\u2019il\nsinp\u2019y\u014f, (\u56db\u4e03\u65b0\u7de8) [New\nTreaty on the Four-Seven Debate], did not accept that\n\u201cGod\u201d had created the world, and outright rejects the idea\nthat this God had incarnated himself as a man. He also examined the\nmoral teachings of another Jesuit, Diego de Pantoja (1571\u20131618),\nand in his commentary on Pantoja\u2019s Qike\n(\u4e03\u514b) [Seven Victories], which described how to overcome\nthe seven deadly sins, he argued that if one removed what was written\nabout God and the devil, the morals could almost be considered\nConfucian. This reflects the non-theistic orientation of\nNeo-Confucianism in Korea, but also highlights how Yi was not about to\noverturn his onto-cosmological inheritance from T\u2019oegye (Yi Ik\nS\u014fngho sas\u014fl: 343).\n\nSome of Yi\u2019s associate Namin scholars were much more\ncritical of Western ideas in general, especially Sin Hudam\n(1702\u20131761) and An Ch\u014fngbok (1712\u20131783). Sin Hudam\nwas particularly scathing of Catholic teachings in his critique\nentitled S\u014fhak py\u014fn (\u897f\u5b78\u8fa8)\n[Critique of Western Learning]. There is a sub-stratum of thought at\nplay in Sin\u2019s text, which hopes to dissuade others from\nbelieving in Jesus as God, or God in the form of a man who spreads\nteachings to the poor. This idea would disengage God from the realm of\ninsensitive Neo-Confucian metaphysics and could potentially wreak\nhavoc for the king and society at large if the social hierarchy\ninscribed universally through Principle were to be\nrejected.\n\nThis foreboding is much more urgent in the writings of a fellow\nNamin scholar An Ch\u014fngbok, as his own son-in-law\nKw\u014fn Ilsin (1736\u20131791) was among the earliest Confucian\nconverts to Catholicism. These were the incentives behind his two\ncritiques of Catholicism: Ch\u2019\u014fnhakko\n(\u5929\u5b78\u8003) [Thoughts on Heavenly Learning], and\nCh\u2019\u014fnhak mundap (\u5929\u5b78\u554f\u7b54)\n[Questions and Answers on Heavenly Learning]. An Ch\u014fngbok draws\nour attention to the importance of the figure of Jesus and his message\nas the focal point of these young Korean Neo-Confucian scholars who\nhad overturned the onto-cosmology of Principle and\nki, which then also had no bearing on one\u2019s human\nnature and mind. In Ch\u2019\u014fnhak mundap, An upholds\nhis traditional Neo-Confucian horizon and suggests that Catholics\nmisused Confucian vocabulary when they discussed sagehood (in relation\nto Jesus), emphasising that Confucius did not discuss the supernatural\nand was concerned with this life (Kim Shin-ja [ed.] 1987:\n28\u201329).\n\nThese Confucians were all toeing the line of orthodox Confucian\nmorality, which was practical (not mystical), and where the onus for\nmorality was on oneself, inscribed into one\u2019s mind and human\nnature. For them, humans decided their own moral fate by mastering\none\u2019s desires, and neither the devil nor God had any part in\nthis. The \u201cthis-worldliness\u201d of the Confucian discourse\nwas something they championed, advocating its benefits for human\naffairs governed by \u201cmindfulness\u201d, and not by any sort of\ninterference from the spirit world. In this sense they were upholding\nthe agnostic stance of Confucius himself in the Analects:\n\n\nIf we are not yet able to serve man, how can we serve spiritual\nbeings? [\u2026] If we do not yet know about life, how can we know\nabout death? (SB-Chan: 36)\n\n",
