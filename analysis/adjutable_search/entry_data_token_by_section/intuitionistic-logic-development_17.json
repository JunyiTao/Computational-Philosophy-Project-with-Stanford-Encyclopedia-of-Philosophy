    "main_text": "Early Partial Formalizations and Metamathematics || Heyting 1930\n4.4 Heyting 1930\n\nHeyting\u2019s (partial) formalization of intuitionistic logic and\nmathematics in Heyting 1930, Heyting 1930A, and Heyting 1930B, is\nperhaps, as far as the parts on logic are concerned, the most\ninfluential intuitionistic publication ever, together with his book\nIntuitionism: An Introduction from 1956.\n\nHeyting\u2019s formalization comprised intuitionistic propositional\nand predicate logic, arithmetic, and analysis, all together in one big\nsystem (with only variables for arbitrary objects). The part concerned\nwith analysis was, not only in its intended interpretation (involving\nchoice sequences) but also formally, no subsystem of its classical\ncounterpart; this explains why it sparked no general interest at the\ntime. (A consequence we noted above is that Brouwer\u2019s strong\ncounterexamples never affected the debate.) Therefore this part of\nHeyting\u2019s formalization was left out of consideration by the\nother participants in the Foundational\n Debate.[25]\n This was different for the parts concerned with logic and arithmetic.\nFormally speaking and disregarding their intended interpretations,\nfrom these one could distill subsystems of their classical\ncounterparts, from which only PEM (or double negation elimination) is\nmissing. No doubt this encouraged many to accord to these systems a\ndefinitive character, which, as Heyting had remarked at the beginning\nof his paper, on the intuitionistic conception of logic they cannot\nhave:\n\n\nIntuitionistic mathematics is a mental activity\n[\u201cDenkt\u00e4tigkeit\u201d], and for it every\nlanguage, including the formalistic one, is only a tool for\ncommunication. It is in principle impossible to set up a system of\nformulas that would be equivalent to intuitionistic mathematics, for\nthe possibilities of thought cannot be reduced to a finite number of\nrules set up in advance. Because of this, the attempt to reproduce the\nmost important parts of formal language is justified exclusively by\nthe greater conciseness and determinateness of the latter\nvis-\u00e0-vis ordinary language; and these are properties that\nfacilitate the penetration into the intuitionistic concepts and the\nuse of these concepts in research. (Heyting 1930: 42 [Mancosu 1998:\n311])\n\n\nHowever, Heyting himself, however, wrote some five decades later,\n\n\nI regret that my name is known to-day mainly in connection with these\npapers [Heyting 1930, 1930A, 1930B], which were very imperfect and\ncontained many mistakes. They were of little help in the struggle to\nwhich I devoted my life, namely a better understanding and\nappreciation of Brouwer\u2019s ideas. They diverted the attention\nfrom the underlying ideas to the formal system itself. (Heyting 1978:\n15)\n\n\nThe fear that the attention might be thus diverted had indeed been\nexpressed in the first of the three papers themselves:\n\n\nSection 4 [on negation] departs substantially from classical logic.\nHere I could not avoid giving the impression that the differences that\ncome to the fore in this section constitute the most important point\nof conflict between intuitionists and formalists (a claim that is\nalready refuted by the remark made at the beginning [quoted above]);\nthis impression arises because the formalism is unfit to express the\nmore fundamental points of conflict. (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998:\n313])\n\n\nFor the full system, including predicate logic and analysis, the\nreader is referred to Heyting\u2019s original papers. Heyting\u2019s\naxioms for intuitionistic propositional logic were: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \n \\tag{1} a &\\rightarrow(a \\wedge a)\\\\\n \\tag{2} (a \\wedge b) &\\rightarrow(b \\wedge a)\\\\\n \\tag{3} (a \\rightarrow b) &\\rightarrow((a \\wedge c)\\rightarrow(b \\wedge c))\\\\\n \\tag{4} ((a \\rightarrow b) \\wedge(b \\rightarrow c)) &\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow c)\\\\\n \\tag{5} \\label{HeytingAxiom5} b &\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\\\\n \\tag{6} (a \\wedge(a \\rightarrow b)) &\\rightarrow b\\\\\n \\tag{7} a &\\rightarrow(a \\vee b)\\\\\n \\tag{8} (a \\vee b) &\\rightarrow(b \\vee a)\\\\\n \\tag{9} ((a \\rightarrow c) \\wedge(b \\rightarrow c)) &\\rightarrow((a \\vee b) \\rightarrow c)\\\\\n \\tag{10} \\label{HeytingAxiom10} \\neg a &\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\\\\n \\tag{11} ((a \\rightarrow b) \\wedge(a \\rightarrow \\neg b)) &\\rightarrow \\neg a\\\\\n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nIn a letter to Oskar Becker, Heyting described the approach used to\nobtain these axioms, as well as those for predicate logic, as\nfollows:\n\n\nI sifted the axioms and theorems of Principia Mathematica\nand, on the basis of those that were found to be admissible, looked\nfor a system of independent axioms. Given the relative completeness of\nPrincipia, this to my mind ensures the completeness of my system in\nthe best possible way. Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is\nimpossible to be certain that one has captured all admissible\nmodes of inference in one formal system. (Heyting to Becker, September\n23, 1933 (draft) [van Atten 2005: 129], original italics, translation\nmine)\n\n\nAs Heyting emphasizes here, the theorems of Principia\nMathematica also had to be looked at, for a theorem might be\nintuitionistically acceptable even when a classical proof given for it\nis\n not.[26]\n It is worth noting that Heyting used this method of crossing out, as\nalso Kolmogorov had, instead of determining the logic directly from\ngeneral considerations on mathematical constructions in\nBrouwer\u2019s sense. (To some extent, Kreisel tried to do that\nsystematically in the 1960s.) \nIn his dissertation on intuitionistic\naxiomatization of projective geometry, Heyting had already gained\nexperience with developing an intuitionistic system by taking a\nclassical axiomatic system as guideline and then adjusting\n it.[27]\n\nIn Mints 2006 (section 2) it has been observed that Russell 1903\n(section 18) anticipated intuitionistic propositional logic by\nidentifying Peirce\u2019s law and using it to separate out the\nprinciples that imply PEM. It seems that Heyting did not realize this\nat the time; among the references given in Heyting 1930,\nRussell\u2019s book does not appear.\n\nHeyting shows the independence of his axioms using a method given by\nBernays (1926); this use of a non-intended interpretation for\nmetamathematical purposes Heyting accepted without hesitation, but he\nremarked that such metamathematics is \u201cless important for us\n[intuitionists]\u201d than the approach where all formulas are\nconsidered to be meaningful propositions (Heyting 1930: 43 [Mancosu\n1998: 312]).\n\nHeyting states Glivenko\u2019s two theorems from 1929, without giving\nproofs.\n\nUnlike Kolmogorov, but like Glivenko (who had been convinced by\nHeyting), Heyting accepted Ex Falso (axiom\n\\ref{HeytingAxiom10} above). He was somewhat more elaborate on this\npoint than they had been:\n\n\nThe formula \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) generally means: \u201cIf \\(a\\)\nis correct, then \\(b\\) is correct\ntoo\u201d. This proposition is meaningful if \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are constant propositions about whose correctness\nnothing need be known \u2026 The case if conceivable that after the\nstatement \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved in the sense specified,\nit turns out that \\(b\\) is always correct. Once\naccepted, the formula \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) then has to remain correct;\nthat is, we must attribute a meaning to the sign \\(\\rightarrow\\) such\nthat \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) still holds. The same can be remarked in the\ncase where it later turns out that \\(a\\) is always\nfalse. For these reasons, the formulas [\\ref{HeytingAxiom5}] and\n[\\ref{HeytingAxiom10}] are accepted. (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998:\n313])\n\n\nThe argument is, however, incomplete. It is uncontroversial that, once\n\\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved, it should remain so when\nafterward \\(\\neg a\\) is proved. But why should \\(a \\rightarrow b\\), if\nit has not yet been proved, become provable just by establishing\n\\(\\neg a\\)? (Johansson asked this in a letter to Heyting in\n 1935;[28]\n see Section 1 of the supplementary document\n Objections to the Proof Interpretation). Clearly, then, further work needed to be done on the\nexplanation of intuitionistic logic.\n\nAfter the publication of Heyting\u2019s series of papers, three roads\ncould be taken, and indeed were (cf. Posy 1992):\n\nto explicate and develop the meaning explanation that had given\nrise to Heyting\u2019s system;\nto engage in metamathematical study of the formal systems\ndistilled from Heyting\u2019s system;\nto find alternative motivations for (parts of) Heyting\u2019s\nsystem that are independent from the intuitionists\u2019, yet also in\nsome sense constructive (e.g., Lorenzen\u2019s dialogue\nsemantics)\n\n\nBy and large, these three roads lead to very different areas, with\ncorrespondingly divergent histories, of which no unified account can\nbe expected. (However, in the Dialectica Interpretation, as proposed\nand understood by G\u00f6del [1958, 1970, 1972], they came close to\none another.) \nFollowing the main theme of the present account, our topic\nwill remain the intuitionistic meaning explanation of logic. But a\nnumber of early highlights of the formal turn are presented in this\nsupplementary document:\n\nThe Turn to Heyting\u2019s Formalized Logic and Arithmetic\n\n",
