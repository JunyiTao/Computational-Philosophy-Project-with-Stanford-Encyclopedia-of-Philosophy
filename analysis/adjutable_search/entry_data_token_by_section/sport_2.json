    "main_text": "What is Sport?\n2. What is Sport?\n\n\nPhilosophical theories of sport take descriptive or normative forms.\nBroadly speaking, descriptive theories attempt to provide an accurate\naccount of sport\u2019s central concepts, and normative theories\nattempt to provide an account of how sport should be. Normative\ntheories of sport are broadly classified as either\n\u2018externalist\u2019 or \u2018internalist.\u2019 Externalist\ntheories of sport understand sport as a reflection of larger social\nphenomena. Heavily influenced by Marxism and structuralism, externalist\nphilosophers take the nature of sport to be determined by principles\nfrom other practices or the larger society. William J. Morgan (1994)\nidentifies three types of externalist theories: \u2018Commodification\ntheory,\u2019 \u2018New Left theory,\u2019 and \u2018Hegemony\ntheory.\u2019 In Commodification theory, sport is understood as a\ncommodity with use- and exchange-value. When sports are commodified,\nthey are viewed not as having inherent characteristics worthy of\nprotection, but solely according to the economic profit that they can\ngenerate (Sandel, 2012; Walsh and Giulianotti, 2007). The main\nproponents of the New Left theory theory are Bero Rigauer (1981),\nJean-Marie Brohm (1978), Rob Beamish (1981), Richard Lipsky (1981), and\nPaul Hoch (1972). They understood sport materialistically by focusing\non the role that sport plays in the genesis and reproduction of social\nhistory, mostly by exploring the connection between labor, economic\ninfrastructure, and sport. Hegemony theories of sport attack the\nreductive and deterministic character of the New Left\u2019s analyses of\nsport. Hegemony theorists such as Richard Gruenau (1983) and John\nHargreaves (1986) explore the role that cultural practices and\nprocesses play in shaping the nature of sporting practices, while\nemphasizing the value of human agency. \n\n\nExternalist accounts of sport tend to be regarded as deflationary\nbecause they deny, or overlook, that sport has independent value. They\nunderstand sport\u2019s value solely in instrumental terms (Ryall,\n2016). Internalist theories of sport do not analyse sport based on\nother social practices or historical processes. Rather, they aim to\nidentify the distinctive values and purposes of sport that\ndifferentiate it from other social practices. Proponents of internalism\nacknowledge the influence on sport of other practices and the larger\nsociety, but internalists argue that sport is a practice with its own\ndistinctive value and internal logic. Thus, the primary goal of\ninternalism is to uncover the intrinsic normative principles of sport.\nA central task within the philosophy of sport has been to develop an\nadequate internalist normative theory of sport. At a minimum, such a\ntheory should articulate sport\u2019s non-instrumental value and it\nshould provide guidance on appropriate standards of both conduct within\nsport, and sporting rules and practices themselves. Internalist views\nare typically classified into the following three categories:\nformalism, conventionalism, and broad internalism (or interpretivism).\nWe examine each in turn now.\n",
