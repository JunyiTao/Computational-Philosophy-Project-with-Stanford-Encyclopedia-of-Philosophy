    "main_text": "AI in the Wild\n5. AI in the Wild\n\nFrom at least its modern inception, AI has always been connected to\ngadgets, often ones produced by corporations, and it would be remiss\nof us not to say a few words about this phenomenon. While there have\nbeen a large number of commercial in-the-wild success stories for AI\nand its sister fields, such as optimization and decision-making, some\napplications are more visible and have been thoroughly battle-tested\nin the wild. In 2014, one of the most visible such domains (one in\nwhich AI has been strikingly successful) is information retrieval,\nincarnated as web search. Another recent success story is pattern\nrecognition. The state-of-the-art in applied pattern recognition\n(e.g., fingerprint/face verification, speech recognition, and\nhandwriting recognition) is robust enough to allow\n\u201chigh-stakes\u201d deployment outside the laboratory. As of mid\n2018, several corporations and research laboratories have begun\ntesting autonomous vehicles on public roads, with even a handful of\njurisdictions making self-driving cars legal to operate. For example,\nGoogle\u2019s autonomous cars have navigated hundreds of thousands of\nmiles in California with minimal human help under non-trivial\nconditions (Guizzo 2011). \n\nComputer games provide a robust test bed for AI techniques as they can\ncapture important parts that might be necessary to test an AI\ntechnique while abstracting or removing details that might beyond the\nscope of core AI research, for example, designing better hardware or\ndealing with legal issues (Laird and VanLent 2001). One subclass of\ngames that has seen quite fruitful for commercial deployment of AI is\nreal-time strategy games. Real-time strategy games are games in which\nplayers manage an army given limited resources. One objective is to\nconstantly battle other players and reduce an opponent\u2019s forces.\nReal-time strategy games differ from strategy games in that players\nplan their actions simultaneously in real-time and do not have to take\nturns playing. Such games have a number of challenges that are\ntantalizing within the grasp of the state-of-the-art. This makes such\ngames an attractive venue in which to deploy simple AI agents. An\noverview of AI used in real-time strategy games can be found in\n(Robertson and Watson 2015). \n\nSome other ventures in AI, despite significant success, have been only\nchugging slowly and humbly along, quietly. For instance, AI-related\nmethods have achieved triumphs in solving open problems in mathematics\nthat have resisted any solution for decades. The most noteworthy\ninstance of such a problem is perhaps a proof of the statement that\n\u201cAll Robbins algebras are Boolean algebras.\u201d This\nwas conjectured in the 1930s, and the proof was finally discovered by\nthe Otter automatic theorem-prover in 1996 after just a few months of\neffort (Kolata 1996, Wos 2013). Sister fields like formal verification\nhave also bloomed to the extent that it is now not too difficult to\nsemi-automatically verify vital hardware/software components (Kaufmann\net al. 2000 and Chajed et al. 2017).\n\nOther related areas, such as (natural) language translation, still\nhave a long way to go, but are good enough to let us use them under\nrestricted conditions. The jury is out on tasks such as machine\ntranslation, which seems to require both statistical methods (Lopez\n2008) and symbolic methods (Espa\u00f1a-Bonet 2011). Both\nmethods now have comparable but limited success in the wild. A\ndeployed translation system at Ford that was initially developed for\ntranslating manufacturing process instructions from English to other\nlanguages initially started out as rule-based system with Ford and\ndomain-specific vocabulary and language. This system then evolved to\nincorporate statistical techniques along with rule-based techniques as\nit gained new uses beyond translating manuals, for example, lay users\nwithin Ford translating their own documents (Rychtyckyj and Plesco\n2012). \n\nAI\u2019s great achievements mentioned above so far have all been in\nlimited, narrow domains. This lack of any success in the unrestricted\ngeneral case has caused a small set of researchers to break away into\nwhat is now called\n  artificial general intelligence\n (Goertzel and Pennachin 2007). The stated goals of this movement\ninclude shifting the focus again to building artifacts that are\ngenerally intelligent and not just capable in one narrow domain. \n",
