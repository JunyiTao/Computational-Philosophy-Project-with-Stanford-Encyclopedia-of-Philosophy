    "main_text": "Change in Substance\n12. Change in Substance\n\nAt the beginning of Book V of the Physics, Aristotle makes a\ndistinction between change (metabol\u0113) and motion\n(kin\u0113sis). Aristotle classifies the changes per\nse from two angles: the terms whence and\nwhither of any change and motion and from the angle of the\ncategories. From the first angle (Phys. V.1,\n224b35\u2013b5), change can take place through four ways:\n\nfrom positive A (hypokeimenon, Arabic\nmaw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bb) to positive B,\nfrom positive A to negative A,\nfrom negative A to positive A,\nfrom negative A to negative B.\n\n\n(4) is not a change at all, because not-A and not-B\nare neither contrary nor contradictory. (2) is passing-away and (3) is\ncoming-to-be, and these two changes are not motion. The only change\nthat is a motion is (1) from positive A to positive\nB. Averroes interprets A (the Latin translation\nreads subjectum) as \u2018being\u2019 (esse), and\nnon subjectum becomes \u2018non-being\u2019 (non\nesse), but immediately he adds:\n\n\nI understand under not being not being in actuality, that is being in\npotentiality, and [that is] not being in general\n(universaliter), that which is characteristic of Prime\nMatter, and not absolute non-being. (LC 211E TC7; MC Wolfson\n514\u2013516)\n\n\nFrom the angle of the ten Aristotelian categories (225b5\u2013b10),\nthere are three kinds of motion: qualitative (how), quantitative (how\nmuch), and local (where). Averroes observes:\n\n\nThe commentators ask here in what manner [Aristotle] places motion\nunder three different genera, although he placed it as a genus in\nitself, namely under the category of being affected. (LC 214K TC9)\n\n\nSome of the commentators voiced the opinion that the category of\nbeing-affected is a genus for motion under the consideration of\n\u201creceiving the motion\u201d, others, that quality, quantity and\nplace are partially moving, partially at rest, and others disagree,\nand do not accept quality, quantity and place as genera for motion.\nAverroes considers it wrong to enter motion into the category of\nbeing-affected because motion is something the movable receives.\nAverroes\u2019 view is summarized in his own words:\n\n\nMotion has a twofold consideration because according to its matter, it\nbelongs to the genus of that toward which it moves, but according to\nits form, namely, according to its being change\n(transmutatio) linked with time, it belongs to the category\nof being-affected. (LC 215B\n TC9)[12]\n\n\nMotion does not take place in substantial change, that is,\ncoming-to-be or passing-away because there is nothing contrary to\nsubstance (Phys. 225b10\u201311). Averroes comments on\n\u201ccontrary\u201d and explains that the contraries here involved\nhave \u201cintermediate\u201d states (mediata), no matter\ntheir form or condition (LC 215F TC10). Averroes refers to the\ncommentaries of Alexander on De generatione et corruptione\nand Themistius (without identifying the work which the latter\ncomments) and their arguments. He develops his point of view:\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine that changes in substance are not motion\nbecause substance has no contrary is well known (famosa) but\nit seems to him more adequate to say: \u201ccoming-to-be and passing-away\nare not motion because they are in something which is potentiality,\nnot in actuality, and motion is in actuality\u201d (216A TC10; MC Wolfson\n518). If there is motion in substantial change, it is only\naccidentally (LC 216C), but motion plays its role in necessitating\nit.\n",
