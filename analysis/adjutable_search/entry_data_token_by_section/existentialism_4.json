    "main_text": "Engagement vs. Detachment || Being-in-the-World\n2.3 Being-in-the-World\nIn Being and Time, Heidegger will expand on this critique\nof detachment and objectivity by developing his own phenomenological\nanalysis of existence or \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d\n(In-der-Welt-sein). Following the core maxim of phenomenology\nintroduced by his teacher Husserl, Heidegger\u2019s philosophy\nattempts to return \u201cto the things themselves,\u201d to not\nexplain but describe how things are given, reveal themselves,\nand make sense to us in our average everyday lives. Employing the word\n\u201cDasein,\u201d a colloquial German term that refers to the kind\nof \u201cexistence\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d unique to humans,\nHeidegger makes it clear he is not interested in a systematic\nexplanation of what we are, as if existence referred to the\nobjective presence of a substance\u2014e.g., a rational animal, an\nego cogito, or an ensouled body. As a phenomenologist, he is\nconcerned with how we are. In his version of phenomenology,\nDasein is viewed not as a substance with what-like characteristics but\nas a self-interpreting, meaning-giving activity. Dasein refers to\n\u201cthe subject\u2019s way of being\u201d (Heidegger 1927\n[1982, 123]), someone who is always already involved and engaged with\nthe equipment, institutions, and practices of a shared world and that\nembodies a tacit understanding of how to be in that world. \nHeidegger\u2019s conception of being-in-the-world articulates\nthree related ideas that will become central to twentieth-century\nexistentialism and phenomenology. First, it offers a thoroughgoing\nrejection of the Cartesian view of the self or \u201cI\u201d as a\ndiscrete mental container of \u201cinner\u201d thoughts and beliefs\nthat is somehow separate and distinct from \u201couter\u201d\nobjects in the world. There is no inner-outer dualism because the self\nis not a disembodied mind or consciousness. It is the activity of\nexisting, a relational activity that is structurally bound up in the\nworld. Thus, \u201cself and world belong together in the single\nentity, the Dasein\u201d (Heidegger 1927 [1982, 297]). Second,\nHeidegger compels us to rethink what we mean by \u201cworld.\u201d\nFrom a phenomenological perspective, the world is not a geometrical\nspace nor is it the sum of objects. It is the relational setting of our\nlives, the shared context of meaning that we are already involved in.\nAnd our involvement in the world allows objects to count and matter to\nus in particular ways. Third, Heidegger suggests that\nbeing-in-the-world is a meaning-giving activity. When we engage with\nand handle objects in the world, we give them meaning; we encounter\nthem as meaningful. What appears to us in the immediacy of\nlived experience is always shaped by the public meanings we grow into.\nThe fact that our existence is \u201cfraught with meaning\u201d\nsuggests that experience has an intentional structure; it is always\ndirected towards objects; it is about or of something\n(Heidegger 1919 [2002, 60]). The experience of hearing, for example, is\nnot a representation of bare sense data because sounds are invariably\ncolored by the context of meaning we are thrown into. We hear\nsome-thing: we hear \u201cthe thunder of the\nheavens, the rustling of the woods, the rumbling of\nthe motors, the noises of the city\u201d (Heidegger 1950\n[1971, 65], emphasis added). Meaning, on this view, is not generated by\ndetached cognitive associations. It emerges against the background of\nour functional involvement in the world, in the way we are situated and\nengaged in a shared network of equipment, roles, institutions, and\nprojects. And this engagement reveals a kind of pre-reflective\ncompetence or practical \u201cknow how\u201d (k\u00f6nnen)\nthat can never be made theoretically explicit.\n",
