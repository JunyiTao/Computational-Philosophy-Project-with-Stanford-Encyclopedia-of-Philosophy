    "main_text": "Kagy\u00fc\n2. Kagy\u00fc\n\nAccording to Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorje, \u0100tisha and his followers\nin Tibet, are the authoritative former masters of the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika. It is this line of reading of the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika that Kagy\u00fc takes it to be authoritative\nwhich the later Kagy\u00fc wholeheartedly embraces as the standard\nposition (Miky\u00f6 Dorje, 2006: 272\u2013273). Karmapa Miky\u00f6\nDorje cliams that it is a characteristic of Kagy\u00fc masters and\ntheir followers to recognise the ancient Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\ntradition to be philosophically impeccable (\u2018khrul med) (2006:\n272).\n\nUnlike the other Tibetan schools, Kagy\u00fc rejects the more dominant\nview that each philosophical school in Indian Buddhism has its own\ndistinctive theory of the two truths. \u201cThere are those who\nadvance various theories proclaiming that the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika on\nup to the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka, for the purpose of\ndistinctive definitions of the two truths, unique rational and unique\ntextual bases. This is true,\u201d says Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorje,\nan indication \u201cof the failure to understand the logic, and the\ndifferentiation between the definition (mtshan nyid) and the defined\nexample (mtshan gzhi)\u201d (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 293). The Indian\nBuddhist philosophical schools only disagree, according to Kagy\u00fc,\non the issue concerning the defined example (mtshan gzhi) of the two\ntruths. The instances of ultimate truth in each lower school are, it\nargues, their philosophical reifications, hence, they are the ones the\nhigher schools logically refute. There is nevertheless no disagreement\nbetween the Indian Buddhist schools as far as the definiendum (mtshon\nbya / lak\u1e63ya) and the definition (mtshan nyid /\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47a) of the two truths are concerned. If they disagree\non these two issues, there would be no commonly agreed definition, but\nthere is a definition of the ultimate which is common to all schools,\neven though there is no commonly agreed defined example to illustrate\nsuch definition (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 293).\n\nWhere the Indian Buddhist philosophical schools party their company,\nKagy\u00fc argues, is their conception of the defined example of the\nultimate. For the realists (dngos smra ba) ultimate truth is a\nfoundational entity (rdzas su yod pa) that withstands rational\nanalysis. The Madhyamaka rejects this and argues that if ultimate\ntruth is a foundational entity, it is not possible to attain an\nawakening to it. If it is possible to attain awakening, then ultimate\ntruth is impossible to be a foundational entity, for the two mutually\nexclude each other. The foundational entity, like the substance of the\nBrahmanical metaphysicians, does not allow modification or change to\ntake place whereas the attainment of awakening is an ongoing process\nof modification and change (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 294).\n\nFrom the position Kagy\u00fc takes, it is clear then, that it does not\nendorse Gelug\u2019s position that the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika has its\nown theory of the two truths which affords a unique framework within\nwhich a presentation of the definition and the defined example of the\ntwo truths can be set out. (See Yakherds 2021 vol. 1 for the Gelugpa\ncritiques)Kagy\u00fc argues that the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s\nproject is purely for pedagogical and heuristic reasons, \u201cfor it\nseeks to assuage the cognitive errors of its opponents\u2014the\nnon-Buddhists, our own-schools such as Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika on up to\nthe Sv\u0101tantrika\u2014who assert philosophical positions based on\ncertain texts\u201d (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 294). The\nnon-Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika philosophical schools equate the definition\nof the ultimate with the defined example, and this is the malady that\nthe Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika seeks to allay.  Therefore the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s role, as Kagy\u00fc sees it, is to point\nout the absurdities in the non-Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika position and to\nshow that the definition of the ultimate and the defined example are\nrather two separate issues, and that they cannot be identified with\neach other (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 294\u201395). The\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika does not, like Nyingma, entertain any position\nof its own, except for the purpose of a therapeutic reason, and for\nwhich \u201cthe Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika relies on the convention as a\nframework for things that need to be cultivated and those that are to\nbe abandoned. For this, our own position does not need to base the\nlinguistic conventions on the concepts of definition and the defined\nexample. Instead [our position],\u201d says Kagy\u00fc,\n\u201cconforms to the non-analytical mundane practice in which what\nneeds to be abandoned and what needs to be cultivated are undertaken\nin agreement with the real-unreal discourses of the conventional\n[truth]\u201d (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 295).\n\nTherefore according to Kagy\u00fc, the position of all Indian Buddhist\nphilosophical schools\u2014be it higher or lower\u2014agree in so\nfar as the definitions of the two truths are concerned. (1)\n\u201c[Ultimate truth] is that which reasoned analysis does not\nundermine and that which withstands reasoned analysis. Conventional\ntruth is the reverse. (2) Ultimate is the non-deceptive nature and it\nexists as reality. Conventional [truth] is the reverse. (3) Ultimate\nis the object of the non-erroneous subject. Conventional [truth] is\nthe object of the erroneous subject\u201d (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006:\n294). Of these three definitions, the first one proposes conventional\ntruth as one that does not withstands reasoned analysis whereas\nultimate truth does indeed withstand the reasoned analysis.\n\u201cConventional [truth] is a phenomenon that is found to exist\nfrom the perspective of the cognitive processes that are either\nnon-analytical (ma dpyad pa) or slightly analytical (cung zad dpyad\npa), whereas ultimate [truth] is that which is found either from the\nperspective of the cognitive process that is thoroughly analytical\n(shing tu legs par dpyad pa) or meditative equipoise\u201d\n(Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 274). Conventional truth is non-analytical in\nthe sense that ordinary beings assume its reality uncritically, and\nbecome fixated to its reifications in virtue of how it appears to\ntheir uncritical minds, rather than how it really is from the critical\ncognitive perspective. When conventional truth is slightly analysed,\nhowever, it reveals that it exists merely as collocations of the\ncodependent causes and conditions (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 273).\nTherefore conventional truth is \u201cone that is devoid of an\nintrinsic reality, rather it is mere name (ming tsam),\nmere sign (rda tsam), mere linguistic convention\n(tha snyad tsam), mere conception (rnam par rtog pa tsam) and\nmere fabrication (sgro btags pa tsam)\u2014one that merely\narises or ceases due to the force of the expressions or the conceptual\nlinguistic convention\u201d (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006: 273). Ultimate\ntruth is defined, on the other hand, as one that is found by\nanalytical cognitive process or by a meditative equipoise of the\nexalted beings, for the reason that when it is subjected to analysis,\nphenomena are fundamentally, by its very nature transcendent of the\nelaborations (spros pa) and all symbolisms (mtshan ma) (Miky\u00f6\nDorje 2006: 273).\n\nOn the second definition \u201cConventional truth is that which does\nnot deceive the perspective to which it appears (snang ngor), or that\nwhich does not deceive an erroneous perspective (\u2018khrul ngor),\nor that which is non-deceptive according to the standard of the\nmundane convention\u201d (Kun Khyen Padkar, 2004: 66). Ultimate\ntruth, on the other hand, is defined as \u201cthat which does not\ndeceive a correct perception (yang dag pa'i mthong ba), or that which\ndoes not deceive reality as it is (gnas lugs la mi bslu ba), or that\nwhich does not deceive an awakened perspective (sang rgyas kyi gzigs\nngor)\u201d (Kun Khyen Padkar, 2004: 74).\n\nThe third definition is based on the two conflicting epistemic\npractices. Here ultimate is defined as an ultimate object from the\nperspective of exalted beings (\u0101rya / \u2018phags pa). The\nultimate reality, although, is not one that is regarded as cognitively\nfound to exist in and of itself inherently (rang gi bdag nyid).\nConventional truth is defined as the cognitive process that sees\nunreal phenomena (brdzun pa mthong ba) from the perspective of the\nordinary beings whose cognitive processes are obscured by the\ncataracts of confusion. Conventional truth is unreal, for it does not\nexist in the manner in which it is perceived by the confused cognitive\nprocesses of the ordinary beings (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006:\n269\u201370). Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorje puts the point in this way.\n\u201cTake a vase as one entity, for instance. It is a conventional\nentity, for it is a reality for the ordinary beings, and it is found\nto be the basis from which arise varieties of hypothetical\nfabrications. The exalted beings,\u201d he argues, \u201chowever, do\nnot see any of these [fabrications], anywhere, whatsoever, and this\nmode of seeing by way of not seeing anything at all is termed\nas the seeing of the ultimate. Therefore the two truths, in\nthis sense, are not distinct. They are differentiated from the\nperspective of the cognitive processes that are either erroneous or\nnon-erroneous\u201d (Miky\u00f6 Dorje, 2006: 274).\n\nAlthough, like Nyingma and Sakya it is the view of Kagy\u00fc to\nmaintain that erroneous cognitive process represents the nature of the\nordinary beings, whereas non-erroneous cognitive processes represent\nthe exalted beings. However, unlike Nyingma and Sakya, Kagy\u00fc\ninsists that the distinctions between the two truths has nothing to do\nwith the perspective of the exalted beings. Everything, it claims, has\nto do with how ordinary beings fabricate things erroneously\u2014one\nmore real than the other\u2014and that it has nothing to do with how\nexalted beings experience things. \u201cEven this distinction is made\nfrom the point of view of the cognitive process of the childish\nbeings. Since all things the childish beings perceive are\ncharacteristically unreal (brdzun pa) and deceptive (bslu ba), they\nconstitute the conventionality. The exalted beings, however, do not\nperceive at all anything in the way in which the childish beings\nperceive and fabricate. So ultimate truth is, according to Kagy\u00fc,\nthat which is unseen and unfound by the exalted beings since it is the\nway things really are. Therefore both the truths are taught for the\npedagogical reasons in accord with the perspective of the childish\nbeings, but not because the exalted beings experienced the two truths\nor that there really exist the two truths (Miky\u00f6 Dorje 2006:\n274). As for the conventional truth, Kagyu divides it into having two\naspects: the conventional in the form of imputed concrete phenomena\nthat are capable to appear concretely as such, and the conventional in\nterms of merely nominal imputations of abstract entities that are\nincapable of concrete appearance (Miky\u00f6 Dorje, see Yakherds\n2021: 153\u201355).\n\nWhat follows from the above discussion is that Kagy\u00fc is monist\nabout truth (Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorje, 2006: 302) in that it claims\nonly one truth and that truth it equates with transcendent wisdom.\nDespite minor differences, Nyingma, Kagy\u00fc and Sagya all emphasize\nthe synthesis between transcendent wisdom and ultimate truth, arguing\nthat \u201cthere is neither separate ultimate truth apart from the\ntranscendent wisdom, nor transcendent wisdom apart from the ultimate\ntruth\u201d (2006: 279). For this reason Kagy\u00fc advances the view\nsimilar to Nyingma and Sakya that the exceptional quality of awakened\nknowledge consists in not experiencing anything conventional or\nempirical from the enlightened perspective, but experiencing\neverything from the other\u2019s\u2014nonenlightened\u2014perspective.\n(Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorje, 2006: 141\u201342ff)\n\nFinally, on the relationship of the two truths, Kagy\u00fc maintains a\nposition which is consciously ambiguous\u2014that they are\nexpressible neither as identical nor distinct. Responding to an\ninterlocutory question, \u201cAre the two truths identical or\ndistinct?\u201d Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9, says, \u201cneither\nis the case.\u201d And he advances three arguments to support this\nposition. First, \u201cFrom a perspective of the childish beings,\n[the two truths] are neither identical, for they do not see the\nultimate; nor are they distinct, for they do not see them\nseparately\u201d (Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9, 2006: 285).\nSecond, \u201cFrom standpoint of the meditative equipoise of the\nexalted beings, the two truths are neither identical, for the\nappearance of the varieties of conventional entities do not appear to\nthem. Nor are they distinct, for they are not perceived as\ndistinct\u201d (Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9, 2006: 285). The\nthird is the relativity argument which says, \u201cThey are all\ndefined relative to one another\u2014unreality is relative to reality\nand reality is relative to unreality. Because one is defined relative\nto the other, one to which it is related (ltos sa) could not be\nidentical to that which it relates (ltos chos). This is because it is\ncontradictory for one thing to be both that which relates (ltos chos)\nand the related (ltos sa). Nor is it the case that they are distinct\nbecause,\u201d according to Kagy\u00fc\u2019s view, \u201cwhen the\nrelated is not established, so is the other [i.e., one that relates]\nnot established. Hence there is no relation. If one insists that\nrelation is still possible, then such a relation would not be relative\nto another\u201d (Karmapa Miky\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9, 2006:\n285\u201386).\n\nSo from these three arguments, Kagy\u00fc concludes that the two\ntruths are neither expressible as identical nor distinct. It argues\nthat \u201cjust as the conceptual images of a golden vase and a\nsilver vase do not become distinct on the account of them not being\nexpressed as identical. Likewise these images do not become identical\non the account of them not being expressed as distinct\u201d\n(Miky\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9, 2006: 286).\n",
