    "main_text": "Spinoza\n2. Spinoza\n\nThe earliest statement of the PSR in Spinoza\u2019s writings appears in his\nfirst published work, the 1663 geometrical exposition of\nDescartes\u2019 Principles of Philosophy (which may or may\nnot reflect Spinoza\u2019s own views at the time). The eleventh axiom of\nPart I of the book states:\n\nNothing exists of which it cannot be asked, what is the cause (or\nreason) [causa (sive ratio)], why it exists.\n\nIn a brief explanatory note to this axiom, Spinoza adds:\n\n\nSince existing is something positive, we cannot say that it has\nnothing as its cause (by Axiom 7). Therefore, we must assign some\npositive cause, or reason, why [a thing] exists\u2014either an\nexternal one, i.e., one outside the thing itself, or an internal one,\none comprehended in the nature and definition of the existing thing\nitself. (Geb.\n I/158/4\u20139)[3]\n\n\nAxiom 7, to which Spinoza appeals in the explanation, is a variant of\nthe \u201cex nihilo, nihil fit\u201d (\u201cfrom nothing,\nnothing comes\u201d) principle, and stipulates that an existing thing\nand its perfections (or qualities) cannot have nothing or a\nnon-existing thing as their cause. Interestingly, however, in another\nwork from this early period of his philosophical writing, the\nTreatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, Spinoza allows\nfor one unique item to be without a cause. In \u00a770 of this\ntreatise, Spinoza argues:\n\n\n[T]hat Thought is also called true which involves objectively the\nessence of some principle that does not have a cause, and is\nknown through itself and in itself. (II/26/33\u20134. Our\nemphasis)\n\n\nIt is not completely clear what \u201cthe principle\n[principium]\u201d at stake is, but given its qualification\nas \u201cknown through itself and in itself\u201d, it may refer to\nGod and indicate Spinoza\u2019s understanding of Descartes\u2019\nrather nuanced view\u2014in his Second Set of Replies\u2014according\nto which God does not need a cause in order to exist, but\nthere is a reason why God does not need a cause (AT VII:\n164\u201365; cf. Carraud 2002: Ch.\n 2).[4]\n\nAccording to some commentators Spinoza states a variant of the PSR\nalready at the opening of his major work, the Ethics. The\nsecond axiom of Part One of the book reads:\n\n\nE1a2: What cannot be conceived [concipi] through another,\nmust be conceived through itself.\n\n\nThe immediate implication of E1a2 is that everything is\n conceived.[5]\n Since, for Spinoza, to conceive something is to explain it (see\nE1p10s, E1p14d and Della Rocca 2008: 5) it seems that E1a2 amounts to\nthe claim that everything is explainable. Other commentators have also\nseen the PSR encoded in E1a3:\n\n\nFrom a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and\nconversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an\neffect to follow.\n\n\nIf we interpret \u201ceffect\u201d narrowly as something with a\ncause, then the second clause is trivial. If we interpret it more\nbroadly as anything that exists, obtains, happens (or whatever the\nrelata of causation are taken to be) has a cause, then the second\nclause contains a statement of a version of the PSR: everything has a\ncause (Garrett 1979 and Lin 2017).\n\nIn E1p11d2, Spinoza states explicitly a variant of the PSR: \u201cFor\neach thing there must be assigned a cause, or reason, both\nfor its existence and for its nonexistence\u201d. Similarly, in\nE1p8s2, Spinoza argues, \u201cif a certain number of individuals\nexists, there must be a cause why those individuals, and why neither\nmore nor fewer, exist.\u201d Spinoza\u2019s insistence that even the\nnon-existence of things must be explainable is crucial. It\nallows him, for example, to argue that were God not to exist, his\nnon-existence must be explainable. Since God is a substance, Spinoza\nargues, his existence or non-existence cannot be caused or explained\nexternally (Spinoza takes substances to be causally independent of\neach other); hence, were God not to exist, his own nature would have\nto be the cause of his non-existence, just as the nature of a\nsquare-circle is the cause of the non-existence of that thing. But\nsince God\u2019s nature is not a contradictory, his nature cannot\ninternally rule out his existence, and hence he must exist\n(E1p11d).\n\nThe scope of Spinoza\u2019s PSR and its role in his system is a\ncontroversial matter. A dominant trend in recent scholarship reads\nSpinoza\u2019s PSR as having unrestricted scope and playing a crucial\nrole in deriving many of his most important doctrines (e.g., Della\nRocca 2008). But this trend has recently been challenged by readers\nwho argue that Spinoza\u2019s PSR is restricted in scope to facts\nabout existence and nonexistence and that he rarely explicitly appeals\nto this principle in deriving his signature doctrines (e.g., Garber\n2015 and Lin 2019).\n\nCommentators who give a prominent role to the PSR in Spinoza\u2019s\nsystem frequently offer rational reconstructions of Spinoza\u2019s\narguments for his doctrines that find a crucial, if implicit, role for\nthe PSR. For example, some think that the PSR is the primary\nmotivation behind Spinoza\u2019s strict necessitarianism. On this reading,\nfor Spinoza, if there are two (or more) possible worlds, it would seem\nthat neither one would have a sufficient reason or cause (for\nif there were such a sufficient reason, this world would be\nnecessitated, and all other worlds would be impossible). In other\nwords, the PSR dictates that there is only one possible world (see\nDella Rocca (2008), 69\u201378, Lin (2011), 23\u201325, and Melamed\n(2021). Other commentators, (e.g., Lin 2019), deny that the PSR plays\nany role in Spinoza\u2019s arguments for necessitarianism, and still\nothers have denied that Spinoza is a necessitarian in the relevant\nsense (e.g. Curley 1969, and Curley and Walski 1999). Moreover, there\nare commentators who, while believing that the PSR is behind\nSpinoza\u2019s necessitarianism, suggest that, occasionally,\nSpinoza\u2019s endorsement of the PSR is in tension with other\nprinciples of his metaphysics, such as the priority of the infinite\n(see Melamed (2012b), and Melamed (2013a), xvii).\n\nSpinoza holds not only that the existence of things must be explained,\nbut he is also committed to the assertion that the essences of all\nthings follow necessarily from God\u2019s essence (E1p25 and E1p16).\nHe is thus committed to the claim that all essences have a cause and\nan explanation.\n\nOther Spinozistic doctrines that some commentators have alleged to\nfollow from his PSR are the Identity of Indiscernibles (E1p4. Although\nsee Lin 2019 for a dissenting view), substance monism (E1p11 and\nE1p14), and the rejection of free will (E1p32 and E2pp48\u201349). It\nhas also been argued that in E1p21d Spinoza implicitly relies on the\nPSR to infer a bold causal principle: a simple cause has one, and only\none, simple effect. Had the cause more than one effect, the difference\nbetween the two effects would be unexplainable insofar as each effect\nis supposed to be fully explained by the same cause. Thus, if we\nexperience a cause bringing about more than one effect, we should\nconclude that that the cause was not simple, but comprised of parts\n(so that the different parts contributed to the causation of the\ndifferent effects. See Melamed (2013a), 117\u2013119, and Melamed\n(2013b), 212\u2013213.\n\nRecently, Michael Della Rocca argued not only that the PSR\n\u201cprovide[s] the key to unlocking many of the mysteries of\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophical system\u201d (2008: 9), but that\nSpinoza requires the reduction of the most basic\nphilosophical concepts to reason or intelligibility. This alleged\n\u201cdouble use of the PSR\u201d stipulates (1) that everything\nmust be explainable, and (2) that it should be (ultimately) explained\nin terms of intelligibility. Hence, according to Della Rocca, Spinoza\nreduces his major philosophical concepts\u2014existence, causation,\nrightness, and power\u2014to intelligibility (2008: 8\u20139). While\nthis is a fascinating and bold reading of Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics,\nit seems to contradict his crucial doctrine of the causal and\nconceptual barrier between the attributes (E1p10 and E2p6). The\nreduction of any non-Thought item to intelligibility (presumably, a\nfeature of the attribute of\n thought[6])\n undermines the barrier between the attributes, and with it the entire\nedifice of Spinoza\u2019s ontology (see Della Rocca 2012:\n12\u201316; Melamed 2012a; and Melamed 2013a: xv and 196 n. 84).\nMoreover, some have noted that Della Rocca\u2019s arguments for\nspecific reductions, for example, the reduction of causation to\nintelligibility requires assumptions that Spinoza explicitly rejects\n(Lin 2019 and Melamed 2013, Ch. 3).\n\nOn the reading according to which Spinoza\u2019s PSR is unrestricted,\nhow would he respond to the Agrippan Trilemma? Clearly, on this\ninterpretation, Spinoza is unsympathetic to any acceptance of brute\nfacts. Yet he allows for some, restricted cases of self-explanation\nand infinite regress of explanation. Let us take a brief look at these\ntwo issues.\n\nSpinoza begins the Ethics with the definitions of causa\nsui (E1d1), and of substance as that which \u201cis conceived\nthrough itself\u201d (E1d3). Positing these reflexive definitions at\nthe outset might have been a calculated methodological move whose aim\nwas to bypass the challenging task of proving the legitimacy of these\nnotions. But since Spinoza considers his definitions as not merely\nstipulative (see TIE \u00a795 and Ep. 60), we may well ask for a\ndefense of the legitimacy of self-explanations.\n\nThe class of truths that Spinoza considers as self-explanatory are\ntruths that follow merely from the essence or\u2014what is\nthe same\u2014the nature of a thing. In E1p11d, Spinoza provides two\nexamples of self-explanation:\n\n\n[T]he very nature of a square circle indicates the reason why it does\nnot exist, viz. because it involves a contradiction\u2026, the\nreason why a substance exists also follows from its nature alone,\nbecause it involves existence.\n\n\nIn contrast, claims Spinoza, the existence (as well as the\nnon-existence) of a triangle (or any other thing that is not a\nsubstance) do no follow merely from the essence of the\ntriangle:\n\n\nThe reason why a circle or triangle exists, or why it does not exist,\ndoes not follow from the nature of these things, but from the order of\nthe whole of corporeal Nature. (E1p11d).\n\n\nThus, consider the following three propositions: (i) The triangle has\nthree angles, (ii) The substance exists, and (iii) The triangle\nexists. Proposition (i) is clearly self-explanatory, since the essence\nof the triangle (which contains the nature of the number three and the\nnature of an angle) is the sufficient reason for its having three\nangles (adding any other information is of no explanatory value).\nSpinoza considers proposition (ii) as self-explanatory as well. Notice\nthat Spinoza does not define substance (in E1d3) as existing by virtue\nof its essence, but rather derives this claim from the definition of\nsubstance (in E1p7 and E1p6). In contrast to (i) and (ii), the\nexistence of a triangle does not follow merely from its essence (since\nit is caused by entities external to the triangle, and therefore has\nto be explained through these external causes).\n\nLet us turn now to the question of the legitimacy of infinite regress.\nIn E1p28, Spinoza openly states that within each attribute there is an\ninfinite causal chain of finite modes:\n\n\nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence;\nand again, this cause also can neither exist nor be determined to\nproduce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an\neffect by another, which is also finite and has a determinate\nexistence, and so on, to infinity. [Italics added]\n\n\nEach link in this causal chain is preceded by infinitely many causes\nand is followed by infinitely many effects. Each link also provides at\nleast part of the explanation for the existence of the\nfollowing link. Is the existence of such an infinite regress\nconsistent with the PSR? Spinoza has no qualms about answering this\nquestion in the positive. We may legitimately ask what is the cause of\neach link in the chain, and the answer would be: the preceding link.\nSpinoza also thinks that we may\u2014indeed, should\u2014ask what is\nthe cause, or reason, for the existence of the entire infinite\nchain? He simply thinks that he can provide a clear answer to the\nlatter question as well: God (or the being which is the ground of its\nown existence). Consider the following passage from Spinoza\u2019s\ncelebrated \u201cLetter on the Infinite\u201d in which he criticizes\nproofs of the existence of God which rely on the impossibility of an\nactual infinity of causes and effects.\n\n\nIn passing I should like to note here that the more recent\nPeripatetics have, as I think, misunderstood the demonstration by\nwhich the Ancients tried to prove God\u2019s existence. For as I find\nit in a certain Jew, called Rab Chasdai, it runs as follows: if\nthere is an infinite regress of causes, then all things that\nare will also have been caused; but it does not pertain to anything\nwhich has been caused, to exist necessarily by the force of its own\nnature; therefore, there is nothing in Nature to whose essence it\npertains to exist necessarily; but the latter is absurd; therefore,\nthe former is also. Hence the force of this argument does not lie\nin the impossibility of there being an actual infinite or an infinite\nregress of causes, but only in the supposition that things which do\nnot exist necessarily by their own nature are not determined to exist\nby a thing which does necessarily exist by its own nature. [Ep.\n12| IV/61/15\u201362/10; italics added]\n\n\nIn this passage, Spinoza follows the late medieval Jewish philosopher\nHasdai Crescas in rejecting the Aristotelian ban on actual infinity\n(see Melamed 2014). For Spinoza (and Crescas) the existence of an\ninfinite regress of causes is perfectly legitimate. Yet, if all the\nitems in this infinite chain are contingent beings (i.e.,\n\u201cthings which do not exist necessarily by their own\n nature\u201d[7]),\n the chain itself remains a contingent being, and there must be a\nreason which explains its instantiation in reality. The ultimate\nreason for the instantiation of such an infinite chain of contingent\nbeings must, claims Spinoza, be a being whose existence is not\ncontingent (for otherwise, the chain will remain merely contingent and\nits instantiation in reality would not be sufficiently explained).\nThus, Spinoza allows for an infinite regress of causes (or\nexplanations) as long as the entire infinite chain is grounded in a\nbeing which exists by virtue of its mere essence.\n",
