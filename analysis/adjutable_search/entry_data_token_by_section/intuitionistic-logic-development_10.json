    "main_text": "Brouwer\u2019s Later Refinements and Applications, 1921\u20131955 || The Classification of Propositions\n3.4 The Classification of Propositions\n\nIn Brouwer 1955, the four possible cases a proposition \\(\\alpha\\) may\nbe in at any particular moment are made explicit:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) has been proved to be true;\n\\(\\alpha\\) has been proved to be false, i.e., absurd;\n\\(\\alpha\\) has neither been proved to be true nor to be absurd,\nbut an algorithm is known leading to a decision either that \\(\\alpha\\)\nis true or that \\(\\alpha\\) is absurd;\n\\(\\alpha\\) has neither been proved to be true nor to be absurd,\nnor do we know an algorithm leading to the statement either that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is true or that \\(\\alpha\\) is absurd.\n\n\nIn a lecture from 1951, Brouwer lists only cases 1, 2, and 4 from the\nabove list, adding that case 3 \u201cobviously is reducible to the\nfirst and second cases\u201d (Brouwer 1981A: 92). That remark\nemphasizes an important idealization permitted in intuitionistic\nmathematics: we may make the idealization that, once we have obtained\na decision method for a specific proposition, we also know its\noutcome.\n\nBrouwer also adds that a proposition for which case 4 holds may at\nsome point pass to another case, either because we have in the\nmeantime found a decision method, or because the objects involved in\nproposition \\(\\alpha\\) in the meantime have acquired further\nproperties that permit to make the decision (as may happen for\npropositions about choice sequences).\n",
