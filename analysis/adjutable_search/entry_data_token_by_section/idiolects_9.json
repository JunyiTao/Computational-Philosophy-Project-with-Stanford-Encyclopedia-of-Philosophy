    "main_text": "E-Languages versus I-Languages || Second Response to the I-language Perspective: Psycholinguistics\n4. Further Reading\n\nFor thoughts on how best to characterize an idiolectal conception of\nlanguage, and views on how such a conception sits with respect to\nChomskian internalism and to conventionalist views, see George 1990\nand Higginbotham 2006.\n\nThe theory of conventions used in Lewis 1975 is developed at length in\nhis earlier book (1969). The resulting theory of language is\nelaborated by Bennett 1976 and criticized in Burge 1975 and Laurence\n1996. Wiggins 1997 and Millikan 2005, like Lewis, see languages as\nessentially social in nature (Chomsky replies to a version of the\nlatter in Antony and Hornstein 2003).\n\nA special issue of the journal Inquiry (see Begby &\nRamberg 2016) contains a handful of useful discussions of\nDavidson\u2019s influential 1986 article. These include Stainton\n2016, which rejects what the author describes as Davidson\u2019s case\nagainst public languages, adding to parallel criticisms of Chomskian\narguments to the same end in Stainton 2011. For work on the\npragmatics/semantics boundary, much of it raising similar issues, see\nStanley 2000, Carston 2002, Borg 2004, Recanati 2004, Cappelen and\nLepore 2005, and Szab\u00f3 2005. In earlier work on\nDavidson\u2019s paper, his anti-conventionalism is discussed by\nHacking 1986, Dummett 1986, Pietroski 1994, and Reimer 2004. Hacking\naddresses the extent to which Davidson\u2019s conclusion undermines\nhis earlier philosophy of language. Dummett attempts to show that the\nnotion of a prior theory presupposes the notion of a linguistic\ncommunity, and hence of a shared language.\n\nMcGilvray 1999 and Smith and Allott 2016 both offer clear introductions to\nChomsky\u2019s philosophy of language and linguistics, including his\nE-/I-language distinction. A shorter account of his views on this\ntopic in particular can be found in Bezuidenhout 2006. Critical\ndiscussion can be found in five collections: George 1989, Otero 1994\n(Volume II), Antony and Hornstein 2003, Barber 2003, and McGilvray\n2005. Chomsky\u2019s own non-technical writing is usually accessible.\nGood starting places would be the second chapter of Chomsky 1986, the\nessays in Chomsky 2000 (some of which also appeared within his 1995a),\nor the early sections of Chapter 1 of his 1995b (co-written with\nHoward Lasnik).\n\nHoff and Shatz 2007 offers an excellent overview of the field of\nlanguage development, including foundational issues, as well as\nsyntactic, semantic and pragmatic topics in infancy, early childhood\nand atypical development.\n",
