    "main_text": "Defining Women || The Analytic Tradition\n1.1 The Analytic Tradition\n\nThe claim that \u201cOne is not born, but rather becomes a\nwoman\u201d signals a distinction between sex, comprising physical\nand biological aspects of bodies, and gender, comprising learned\nbehaviors, attitudes and aspirations. While this distinction is\ncomplex and controversial enough (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender)\n Beauvoir\u2019s claim also raises what are now termed intersectional\nissues. Spelman notes that in parts of The Second Sex\nBeauvoir recognizes that if one is not born but rather becomes a\nwoman, it is not the same to become a white woman as it is to become a\nBlack one and not the same to become a bourgeois woman as it is to\nbecome a proletarian one. Indeed, Beauvoir bemoans the effect this\ndifference has for women\u2019s struggles for freedom and equality.\nWomen \u201clive dispersed among the males,\u201d she writes,\n\u201cattached through residence, housework, economic condition, and\nsocial standing to certain men \u2013 fathers or husbands \u2013\nmore firmly than they are to other women. If they belong to the\nbourgeoisie, they feel solidarity with men of that class, not with\nproletarian women; if they are white, their allegiance is to white\nmen, not to Negro women\u201d (1953, xix). Not only are women\u2019s\nallegiances bound to class and race but their classes and races can\nlead to tensions and conflicts with other women. Among other\nobservations Beauvoir makes, Spelman notes, are that bourgeois women\ncan be hostile to their working class male and female servants; that\nupper-class girls are brought up to believe in their superiority to\nworking class men and that during the American Civil War some white\nSouthern women defended slavery even more fiercely than their male\ncounterparts.\n\nIn other parts of The Second Sex, however, Beauvoir ignores\nthe consequences of intersections of gender with class and race, and\ntalks about women in general. Spelman points to her contrast between\nwomen, on the one hand, and proletarians, aborigines, Blacks and Jews,\non the other, as well as to her ascription of women\u2019s failure\nhistorically to reject their subordinate social position to the\nadvantages they gain from their alliance with \u201ca superior\ncaste.\u201d Here Beauvoir seems to forget that many women are\nproletarians, aborigines, Blacks and Jews and she writes as if all\nwomen shared the same relation to the white bourgeois men she calls\nthe \u201csuperior caste\u201d(1953, xxi). Spelman also notes the\ncontrast Beauvoir sets up between men defined as citizens and women\ndepicted as wives \u201cshut up in the home;\u201d the way she\nrefers appreciatively to August Bebel\u2019s comparison of women and\nthe proletariat in his Women under Socialism; the use she\nmakes of Hegel\u2019s discussion of the relationship between master\nand slave to describe the relationship between men and women; and her\ncomparison of \u201cNegro slavery\u201d with female slavery (Spelman\n1988, 64\u20135).\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s work thus contains a contradiction in its thinking\nabout women: Sometimes it conceives of women as a homogenous group,\nuniformly subordinate to men, and sometimes it conceives of women as\n\u201cdispersed,\u201d with different relations of solidarity with,\nand subordination to, different groups of men. Both conceptions have\nproblems. In conceiving of women as dispersed according to race and\nclass Beauvoir\u2019s work raises the question of what similarities\nin experience, interest or concern might underwrite feminist\nstruggles. Sally Haslanger calls this the commonality problem (2000,\n37). What experiences does a black Sudanese Muslim woman displaced by\nethnic cleansing in Dafur share with the late Queen of England\n(Mikkola 2007, 363)? What connects white middle-class women pursuing\nprofessional careers with, say, poorer women or women of color who may\ntake over their domestic chores (Ehrenreich 2002)? Might interests in\na living wage by female childcare workers not oppose interests of more\nprivileged women in affordable day care (Collins 1998, 223)? Moreover,\nin conceiving of women as a homogeneous group and contrasting them to\nproletarians, aborigines, Blacks and Jews Beauvoir betrays her\nidentification of women in general with a certain group of women,\nnamely those that are not proletarian, aboriginal, Black or Jewish.\nHaslanger calls this the normativity problem (2000, 37). Talk of women\nas a single group falsely generalizes the interests, characteristics\nand concerns of specific women \u2013 mainly those that are\nmiddle-class, European, white and heterosexual \u2013 and makes them\nthe norm for all.\n\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw draws the consequences of this false\ngeneralization for anti-discrimination law (1989), which has the\nresources to deal with discrimination against Blacks or women but not\ndiscrimination against Black women, and for the issue of violence\nagainst Black women (1991). Civil rights groups often downplay\nstatistics about domestic violence in Black neighborhoods because they\ndo not want to feed stereotypes about the violence of Black men.\nFeminists often downplay the same statistics because they do not want\ndomestic violence to appear to be simply a crime against women of\ncolor. Black men thus serve as the norm for civil rights advocates and\nwhite women as the norm for women\u2019s rights advocates. The\npeculiar vulnerability of women of color at the intersection of racism\nand sexism disappears from view.\n\nCrenshaw\u2019s work on intersectionality underscores concerns about\nexclusion already voiced by the Combahee River Collective, founded in\n1974, as well as by writers such as bell hooks (1981, 7), A\u00edda\nHurtado (1989, 849\u201350) and the contributors to such influential\nanthologies as This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga and\nAnzaldua 1981) and All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are\nMen, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women\u2019s Studies (Hull,\nScott and Smith 1982). Recognition of the myriad intersections that\ncomplicate the identity of women also continues to develop,\nencompassing intersections with not only class, race, sexuality and\nnationality but disability, cisgender and so on. (See Bettcher and\nGarry 2009; Hall 2015, Bettcher 2021 and Hypatia\u2019s\nspecial issue on decolonial feminism. 2020). Indeed, some scholars\nworry that putative intersectional analyses have wandered too far from\ntheir roots in Black feminist theory. (See Nash 2018).\n\nThose analytic feminists interested in preserving some notion of women\nas a common identity pursue various strategies. Ann Garry (2011) looks\nto a Wittgensteinian family resemblance analysis. We can give up on\nthe existence of some property, experience, or interest that all women\nshare without giving up on overlapping and crisscrossing\ncharacteristics that become clear within specific social contexts. For\nher part, Haslanger proposes an \u201cameliorative\u201d concept of\nwomen, one that can help with attempts to end sexist oppression. If\ngender cannot be defined in terms of characteristics or concerns\ncommon to members of a particular gender, she thinks it can\nnonetheless be defined \u201cin terms of how one is socially\npositioned, where this is a function of, e.g., how one is viewed, how\none is treated, and how one\u2019s life is structured socially,\nlegally, and economically.\u201d On this account, gender categories\nrepresent hierarchical relations in which one group maintains a\nsubordinate relation to another and the difference between the two\ngroups is marked by \u201csexual difference\u201d (2000, 38).\nThus:\n\nS is a woman iffdf S is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, legal,\npolitical, social, etc.) and S is \u201cmarked\u201d as a\ntarget for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features\npresumed to be evidence of a female\u2019s biological role in\nreproduction (2000, 39).\n\n\nHaslanger acknowledges that this definition excludes some we might\nintuitively think of as women such as women of inordinate privilege\nwhose observed or imagined bodily features do not mark them for\nsubordination. Nevertheless, she thinks that if we tailor our\ndefinition to the feminist purposes of overcoming subordination these\n\u201cwomen\u201d are not the ones who matter (2000, 46).\n\nYet Mari Mikkola claims that the confusion Haslanger\u2019s terms\nwould create by excluding many commonly defined as women \u201cis\nunlikely to help in the task of challenging existing social\nconditions\u201d (2009, 84). Worse, Katharine Jenkins (2016) thinks\nthe definition excludes some trans women and probably includes only\nthose trans women whose gender presentation is respected because they\nare perceived as possessing bodily features associated with a\nfemale\u2019s role in reproduction; consequently they are perceived\nas either cisgender or as having undergone medical interventions that\nhave altered some of their bodily features so that they now are\nunderstood as the same sort of features cis women possess (400).\nJenkins thinks Haslanger\u2019s ameliorative project can be rescued\nby considering gender not only in terms of class, as Haslanger does in\ntalking about gender, but also in terms of identity, as Haslanger does\nin talking about race, where racial identities involve navigating the\nnorms associated with them. Hence, both class as a woman and\npossession of a female gender identity need to be the focus of an\nameliorative inquiry. (415\u20136).\n\nIn a later article (which refers to Judith Butler and Monique Wittig\nand thus indicates the artificial character of any strict separation\nof analytic and Continental schools in feminist philosophy), Haslanger\nconcedes Jenkins\u2019 point. Although she reiterates that her\nconcern in her earlier essay was social function: \u201ca theoretical\nanalysis of the social factors that produced...gendered\nidentities\u201d (2020, 235) she now claims that her earlier account\nof gender did not offer an adequate replacement for identity.\n",
