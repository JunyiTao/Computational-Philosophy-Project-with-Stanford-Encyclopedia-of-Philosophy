    "main_text": "The Conditions of Self-Consciousness || Self-Consciousness and Personhood\n4.1 Self-Consciousness and Personhood\n\nAs was mentioned in\n \u00a71.2,\n Locke characterises a person as \u201ca thinking intelligent Being,\nthat has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self,\nthe same thinking thing in different times and places\u201d (1700:\nII.xxvii.9). On such a view, self-consciousness is essential to\npersonhood. In particular, on Locke\u2019s view it is the capacity to\nreidentify oneself at different times that is important, a claim which\nis in keeping with the central role of memory in his account of\npersonal identity (see Ayers 1991: vol. II, chs. 22\u201325; Thiel\n2011: ch. 4; Weinberg 2011; G. Strawson 2011b; Snowdon 2014: ch. 3;\nentry on\n personal identity).\n As such, Locke considers the capacity for self-conscious thinking to\nbe a necessary condition of personhood. What is less clear is whether,\non this view, self-consciousness is sufficient for personhood. One\nreason for doubt on this score is that since it is concerned with\nself-conscious thought the account provides no reason to suppose that\ncreatures that enjoy non-conceptual self-consciousness are persons. A\nsecond is that the requirement of being able to reidentify oneself\nover time is not one that we need consider met by all self-conscious\ncreatures for, we can suppose, it is possible for a self-conscious\nsubject to lack the conceptual sophistication to understand the past\nand future tense.\n\nAn alternative conception of personhood that also gives a central role\nto self-consciousness can be found in Frankfurt\u2019s claim that it\nis essential to persons to have a capacity for reflective\nself-evaluation manifested in the possession of what he calls\n\u201csecond-order volitions\u201d (Frankfurt 1971: 110).\nSecond-order volitions involve wanting a certain desire to be\none\u2019s will, that is wanting it to move one to action. A subject\nwith second-order volitions has the capacity to evaluate their\nfirst-order desires and this, it would seem, involves being aware of\nthem as (potentially) their own. Thus persons, thought of as subjects\nwith second-order volitions, are self-conscious (for discussion, see\nWatson 1975; Dennett 1976; Frankfurt 1987; Bratman 2007: chs. 5 &\n11).\n\nAn account of persons that would appear to distance that notion from\nself-consciousness is that offered by P.F. Strawson in chapter 3 of\nIndividuals, \n\n\nthe concept of a person is the concept of a type of entity such that\nboth predicates ascribing states of consciousness\nand predicates ascribing corporeal characteristics, a\nphysical situation &c. are equally applicable to a single\nindividual of that type. (1959: 101\u2013102; for discussion, see\nAyer 1963; Hacker 2002) \n\n\nFrankfurt points out that this is inadequate as a definition of\npersonhood since \u201cthere are many entities beside persons that\nhave both mental and physical properties\u201d (Frankfurt 1971: 5).\nIt may be, however, that Strawson\u2019s formulation here is somewhat\nloose, and that his central idea is that persons are those entities\nthat self\u00ad-ascribe both types of predicate, a condition\nthat perhaps rules out at least most non-human animals. After all\nchapter 3 of Individuals, entitled \u201cPersons\u201d, is\nprimarily concerned with the conditions of such self-ascription, with\n\u201cthe use we make of the word \u2018I\u2019\u201d (P.F.\nStrawson 1959: 94).\n\nStrawson\u2019s primary goal is to argue for the claim that the\nconcept of a person is primitive, a position that he contrasts, on the\none hand, with Cartesian dualism and, on the other, with what he calls\nthe \u201cno-ownership view\u201d: a view according to which we\ndon\u2019t really self-ascribe states of consciousness at all, at\nleast not with the use of \u201cI\u201d as subject (cf. Wittgenstein\n1953: \u00a7244; 1958: 76; Anscombe 1975; it is controversial whether\nWittgenstein ever really held this view, for discussion see Hacker\n1990: chs. 5 & 11; Jacobsen 1996; Wright 1998). To say that the\nconcept of a person is primitive is, on Strawson\u2019s account, to\nsay that it is \u201clogically prior\u201d to the concepts\nsubject and body; persons are not to be thought of\nas compounds of subjects and bodies. Strawson argues that the\nprimitiveness of the concept of a person is a necessary condition of\nthe possibility of self-consciousness (P.F. Strawson 1959:\n98\u2013103). His argument is that one can only self-ascribe states\nof consciousness if one is able to ascribe them to others (for more on\nthis theme see\n \u00a74.4).\n This rules out Cartesian dualism, since ascribing states of\nconsciousness to others requires that one be able to identify others,\nand one cannot identify pure subjects of experience or Cartesian egos.\nThe condition that one must be able to ascribe states of consciousness\nto others also rules out the \u201cno-ownership view\u201d because\nsuch a view is inconsistent with the fact that psychological\npredicates have the very same sense in their first and third person\nuses.\n\nClosely related to the no-ownership view are a family of claims about\npersons that Parfit dubs \u201creductionism\u201d (Parfit 1984:\n\u00a779). Two prominent members of this familiar are the claim that\n\n\n\n[a] person\u2019s existence consists in the existence of a brain and\nbody, and the occurrence of a series of interrelated physical and\nmental event, (1984: 211) \n\n\nand that \n\n\n[t]hough persons exist, we could give a complete description\nof reality without claiming that persons exist. (1984: 212)\n\n\n\nParfit\u2019s reductionism, and it\u2019s relation to Buddhist views\nof the self, has been widely discussed (see for example, Stone 1988;\nKorsgaard 1989; Cassam 1989, 1993, 1997: ch. 5; Garrett 1991, 1998:\nch. 2; Siderits 1997; McDowell 1997; Blackburn 1997). As is the case\nwith the \u201cno-ownership view\u201d it has sometimes been argued\nthat reductionism is incompatible with self-consciousness so, since we\nare indisputably self-conscious, reductionism must be false. Against\nthe claim that the (continued) existence of a person consists merely\nin the (continued) existence of brain, body, and interrelated physical\nand mental events that do not presuppose anything about\npersons as such, McDowell (1997) for example, argues from a\nbroadly Evansian position on self-consciousness (see the supplement:\n Evans on First Person Thought)\n that there simply are no such \u201cidentity-free relations\u201d\n(1997: 378) to which a person\u2019s identity could be reducible.\nThat is, there is no way of characterising memory and the other\npsychological phenomena relevant to personal identity without invoking\nthe identity of the person whose memory it is. As McDowell puts it,\n\n\n\n[i]n continuity of \u201cconsciousness\u201d, there is what appears\nto be knowledge of an identity, the persistence of the same subject\nthrough time. (1997: 361) \n\n\nMemory, at least, cannot be employed in a reductive account of persons\n(for discussion of McDowell\u2019s argument see Buford 2009;\nFern\u00e1ndez 2014; for related arguments from self-consciousness\nto the falsity of reductionism, see Cassam 1997: ch. 5).\n",
