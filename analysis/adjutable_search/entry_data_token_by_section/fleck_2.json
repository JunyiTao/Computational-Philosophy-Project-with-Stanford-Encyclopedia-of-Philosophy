    "main_text": "Thought Collectives\n3. Thought Collectives\n\nImmanuel Kant made us aware that while we learn about nature from\nexperience, in order to do this we have to know something before\nexperiencing anything. According to Kant, a priori synthetic\nknowledge is unchangeable and plays an active role in cognition: our\npicture of the world is formed as much by things in themselves as by\nour forms of perception and categories of thought, and we will never\nknow whether and how that picture is similar to what exists\nindependently of our cognitive acts. Fleck adopted Kant\u2019s thesis\non the active role of cognitive a priori: an empty mind would\nneither perceive nor think. So, before a mind starts to experience,\nand on the basis of experience starts to think, it has to be filled\nwith some initial knowledge. But the quantum revolution in physics has\nshown that there is nothing necessary or unchangeable in a\npriori forms and categories. A non-Kantian explanation of the\norigins of cognitive a priori was badly needed.\n\nAccording to Fleck, the basic phenomenon we have to accept in order to\nbuild the edifice of epistemology is the collective mental\ndifferentiation of men (1936, II). People perceive and think\ndifferently, but those differences concern groups rather than\nindividuals. So we speak of various ways of perceiving and thinking\nabout stars and planets by astronomers, by astrologists, by\ntheologians or by mystics. Those people understand each other very\nwell within their groups: an astronomer understands another astronomer\nwell, and an astrologist another astrologist; but between\ngroups\u2014like between an astrologist and an astronomer\u2014there\nis usually no understanding.\n\nCognition is a collective activity. It is confusing just to say that\nan individual X got to know a phenomenon P: one should say that\n\u201cX got to know P in the thought style S from the epoch E\u201d\n(1936, V)\u2014yet the thought style S from the epoch E is a product\nof a certain thought collective to which X belongs. What to a stubborn\nmetaphysician appears as necessary forms of thinking results from the\nsocial nature of cognition:\n\nA truly isolated investigator is impossible (\u2026). An isolated\ninvestigator without bias and tradition, without forces of mental\nsociety acting upon him, and without the effect of the evolution of\nthat society, would be blind and thoughtless. Thinking is a collective\nactivity (\u2026). Its product is a certain picture, which is\nvisible only to anybody who takes part in this social activity, or a\nthought which is also clear to the members of the collective only.\nWhat we do think and how we do see depends on the thought-collective\nto which we belong (1935b).\n\n\nA thought collective is defined by Fleck as a community of\npersons mutually exchanging ideas or maintaining intellectual\ninteraction (1935a, II.4). Members of that collective not only adopt\ncertain ways of perceiving and thinking, but they also continually\ntransform it\u2014and this transformation does occur not so much\n\u201cin their heads\u201d as in their interpersonal space. It is\neasy to observe this phenomenon in everyday life. When a group of\npeople speak about something important, they start to speak about\nthings which would not cross their minds if they were alone and which\nthey would not tell if they were in another group of people. There\narises a thought style characteristic for that group. There\nalso arises a certain collective mood which straightens up\nthe ties among the group members and inclines them to act in a certain\nway.\n\nSome collectives last shortly\u2014even only as long as an individual\nconversation lasts. When social forces connecting people operate for a\nlong time, there arise thought collectives lasting for many\ngenerations. They take forms of religious movements, folk traditions,\nart or science. Long-lasting collectives create social institutions\nwhich enable and regulate the method by which next generations are\nadded to a given collective: educational systems and social rituals\naccompanying the admission of new members.\n\nAll members of small ethnic groups belong to the same thought\ncollective: everybody perceives and thinks in the same way, just like\neverybody performs the same or very similar actions. Within more\ndeveloped societies there are many various collectives: religious,\nartistic, scientific, astrological, and those related to fashion,\npolitics, economy, medicine, quack, sport, etc. When a thought style,\ndeveloped and employed by a collective, becomes sufficiently\nsophisticated, the collective breaks into a small esoteric\ncircle\u2014a group of specialists which \u201care in the\nknow\u201d\u2014and a wide exoteric circle for all those\nmembers, who are under the influence of the style, but do not play an\nactive role in its formation. Members of the first group are those\n\u201cinitiated\u201d\u2014priests and theologians in the case of\nreligion; artists and art critics in the case of art; scientists in\nthe case of science etc. The corresponding exoteric circles for those\ngroups are: lay believers; art-lovers; school teachers of physics,\nchemistry, and biology, and also engineers and all people interested\nin science.\n\nExoteric circles have an access to a proper thought style only through\nesoteric circles\u2014for example through listening to sermons given\nby priests, or reading popular literature written by scientists.\nMembers of exoteric circles trust the initiated. But specialists and\nmembers of esoteric circles are not independent of exoteric circles:\nthis is the \u201cpublic opinion\u201d which justifies the efforts\nof specialists and gives them a stimulus to continue their work.\n\nIn contemporary societies almost everybody belongs to many thought\ncollectives; e.g. a scientist may be also a member of a certain\nchurch, political party, mountain climbing club. An individual usually\nbelongs to distant thought collectives, so that conflicts between\nthought styles coexisting in him/her do not arise. Most of people\nbelong only to exoteric circles; only few become members of any\nesoteric circle, sporadically belonging to more than one. Everybody\nalso belongs to a wide \u201ceveryday life\u201d collective (which\nalso differs from culture to culture).\n\nWithin the esoteric circle Fleck distinguishes the following\nsubgroups: (1) vanguard, \u201cthe group of scientists working\npractically on a given problem\u201d, (2) the main body, \u201cthe\nofficial community\u201d, and (3) the group of stragglers (1935a,\nIV,4). In other places he omits stragglers and introduces a\ndistinction between professionals (specialists sensu stricto)\nand more general specialists (1936, VI).\n",
