    "main_text": "Contextualism\n7. Contextualism\n\nJust as contextualism in epistemology runs orthogonal to the familiar\ndivisions amongst epistemologists (foundationalism, reliabilism,\ncoherentism, etc.), there are contextualists of every persuasion\namongst vagueness theorists. They develop an analogy between the\nsorites paradox and indexical sophistries such as:\n\nBase step: The horizon is more than 1 meter away.\nInduction step: If the horizon is more than \\(n\\) meters away,\nthen it is more than \\(n + 1\\) meters away.\nConclusion: The horizon is more than a billion meters away.\n\n\nThe horizon is where the earth meets the sky and is certainly less\nthan a billion meters away. (The circumference of the earth is only\nforty million meters.) Yet when you travel toward the horizon to\nspecify the \\(n\\) at which the induction step fails, your trip is as\nfutile as the pursuit of the rainbow. You cannot reach the horizon\nbecause it shifts with your location.\n\nAll contextualists accuse the sorites monger of equivocating. In one\nsense, the meaning of \u2018child\u2019 is uniform; the\ncontext-invariant rule for using the term (its\n\u201ccharacter\u201d) is constant. However, the set of things to\nwhich the term applies (its \u201ccontent\u201d) shifts with the\ncontext. In this respect, vague words resemble indexical terms such\nas: \u2018I\u2019, \u2018you\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018now\u2019, \u2018today\u2019, \u2018tomorrow\u2019. When a\ndebtor tells his creditor on Monday \u2018I will pay you back\ntomorrow\u2019 and then repeats the sentence on Tuesday, there is a\nsense in which he has said the same thing (the character is the same)\nand a sense in which he has said something different (the content has\nshifted because \u2018tomorrow\u2019 now picks out Wednesday).\n\nAccording to the contextualists, the rules governing the shifts\nprohibit us from interpreting any instance of the induction step as\nhaving a true antecedent and a false consequent. The very process of\ntrying to refute the induction step changes the context so that the\ninstance will not come out false. Indeed, contextualists typically\nemphasize that each instance is true. Assent is mandatory.\nConsequently, direct attacks on the induction step must fail. One is\nput in mind of Seneca\u2019s admonition to his student Nero:\n\u201cHowever many you put to death, you will never kill your\nsuccessor.\u201d\n\nHans Kamp (1981), the founder of contextualism, maintained that the\nextension of vague words orbits the speaker\u2019s store of\nconversational commitments. He notes that the commitment pressures the\nspeaker to adjust past judgments to current judgments. This backward\nsmoothing undermines the search for a sharp transition. The diagnostic\npotential of this smoothing is first recognized by Diana Raffman\n(1994). Switching categories (e.g., from blue to green) between two\nneighboring, highly similar items in a sorites series, without\ninstalling a boundary, is enabled by a gestalt switch that occurs\nbetween the two judgments. Switching categories comes at a cost,\nhowever; so once the classifier has switched to a new category, she\nwill stay in the new category as long as she can. In particular, if\nshe now reverses direction and goes back down the series, she will\ncontinue to classify as green some items she previously classified as\nblue. This pattern of judgments, hysteresis, has the effect of\nsmoothing out the category shift so that the seeming continuity of the\nseries is preserved. Instead of merely inviting psychologists to\nverify her predictions about hysteresis effects in sorites series,\nRaffman (2014, 146\u2013156) collaborates with two psychologists to\nrun an experiment that confirms them.\n\nStewart Shapiro integrates Kamp\u2019s ideas with Friedrich\nWaismann\u2019s concept of open texture. Shapiro thinks speakers have\ndiscretion over borderline cases because they are judgment dependent.\nThey come out true in virtue of the speaker judging them to be true.\nGiven that the audience does not resist, borderline cases of\n\u2018child\u2019 can be correctly described as children. The\naudience recognizes that other competent speakers could describe the\nborderline case differently. As Waismann lyricizes, \u201cEvery\ndescription stretches, as it were, into a horizon of open\npossibilities: However far I go, I shall always carry this horizon\nwith me\u201d (1945, 124).\n\nAmerican pragmaticism colors Delia Graff Fara\u2019s contextualism.\nConsider dandelion farms. Why would someone grow weeds? The answer is\nthat \u2018weed\u2019 is relative to interests. Dandelions are\nunwanted by lawn caretakers but are desired by farmers for food and\nwine. Fara thinks this interest relativity extends to all vague words.\nFor instance, \u2018child\u2019 means a degree of immaturity that is\nsignificant to the speaker. Since the interests of the speaker shift,\nthere is an opportunity for a shift in the extension of\n\u2018child\u2019. Fara is reluctant to describe herself as a\ncontextualist because the context only has an indirect effect on the\nextension via the changes it makes to the speaker\u2019s\ninterest.\n\nHow strictly are we to take the comparison between vague words and\nindexical terms? Scott Soames (2002, 445) answers that all vague words\nliterally are indexical.\n\nThis straightforward response is open to the objection that the\nsorites monger could stabilize reference. When the sorites monger\nrelativizes \u2018horizon\u2019 to the northeast corner of the\nEmpire State Building\u2019s observation deck, he seems to generate a\ngenuine sorites paradox that exploits the vagueness of\n\u2018horizon\u2019 (not its indexicality).\n\nAll natural languages have stabilizing pronouns, ellipsis, and other\nanaphoric devices. For instance, in \u2018Jack is tired now and Jill\nis too\u2019, the \u2018too\u2019 forces a uniform reading of\n\u2018tired\u2019. Jason Stanley suggests that the sorites monger\nemploy the premise:\n\nIf that1 is a child then that2 is too, and if\nthat2 is too, then that3 is too, and if\nthat3 is too, then that4 is too, \u2026 and\nthen that\\(_i\\) is too.\n\n\nEach \u2018that\\(_n\\)\u2019 refers to the \\(n\\)th element in a\nsequence of worsening examples of \u2018child\u2019. The meaning of\n\u2018child\u2019 is not shifting because the first occurrence of\nthe term governs all the subsequent clauses (thanks to\n\u2018too\u2019). If vague terms were literally indexical, the\nsorites monger would have a strong reply. If vague terms only resemble\nindexicals, then the contextualist needs to develop the analogy in a\nway that circumvents Stanley\u2019s counsel to the sorites\nmonger.\n\nThe contextualist would also need to address a second technique for\nstabilizing the context. R. M. Sainsbury (2013) advises the sorites\nmonger to present his premises in apparently random order. No pair of\nsuccessive cases raises an alarm that similar cases are being treated\ndifferently. Unless the hearer has extraordinary memory, he will not\nfeel pressured to adjust the context.\n\nThe contextualist must find enough shiftiness to block every sorites\nargument. Since vagueness seeps into every syntactic category, critics\ncomplain that contextualism exceeds the level of ambiguity\ncountenanced by linguists and psycholinguists.\n\nAnother concern is that some sorites arguments involve predicates that\ndo not give us an opportunity to equivocate. Consider a sorites with a\nbase step that starts from a number too large for us to think about.\nOr consider an inductive predicate that is too complex for us to\nreason with. One example is obtained by iterating \u2018mother\nof\u2019 a thousand times (Sorensen 2001, 33). This predicate could\nbe embedded in a mind-numbing sorites that would never generate\ncontext shifts.\n\nOther unthinkable sorites arguments use predicates that can only be\ngrasped by individuals in other possible worlds or by creatures with\ndifferent types of minds than ours. More fancifully, there could be a\nvague predicate, such as Saul Kripke\u2019s \u201ckiller\nyellow\u201d, that instantly kills anyone who wields it. The basic\nproblem is that contextualism is a psychologistic theory of the\nsorites. Since arguments can exist without being propounded, they\nfloat free of attempts to moor them to arguers.\n",
