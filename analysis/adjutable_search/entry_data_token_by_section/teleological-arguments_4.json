    "main_text": "Design Inference Patterns || Inferences to the Best Explanation/Abductive Design Arguments: Schema 3\n2.3 Inferences to the Best Explanation/Abductive Design Arguments: Schema 3\n\nSome philosophers of science claim that in a wide variety of\nscientific cases we employ an \u201cinference to the best\nexplanation\u201d\n (IBE).[6]\n The basic idea is that if one among a number of competing candidate\nexplanations is overall superior to others in significant\nrespects\u2014enhanced likelihood, explanatory power and scope,\ncausal adequacy, plausibility, evidential support, fit with\nalready-accepted theories, predictiveness, fruitfulness, precision,\nunifying power, and the like\u2014then we are warranted in\n(provisionally) accepting that candidate as the right explanation\ngiven the evidence in question (Lipton 1991, 58). Some advocates see\ndesign arguments as inferences to the best explanation, taking design\nexplanations\u2014whatever their weaknesses\u2014as prima\nfacie superior to chance, necessity, chance-driven evolution, or\nwhatever.\n\nA general schema deployed in the current case would give us the\nfollowing:\n\n\nSchema 3:\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) exhibit\nexquisite complexity, delicate adjustment of means to ends (and other\nrelevant R characteristics).\nThe hypothesis that those characteristics are products of\ndeliberate, intentional design (Design Hypothesis) would adequately\nexplain them.\nIn fact, the hypothesis that those characteristics are products of\ndeliberate, intentional design (Design Hypothesis) is the best\navailable overall explanation of them.\n\n\nTherefore (probably)\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are products\nof deliberate, intentional design (i.e., the Design Hypothesis is\nlikely true).\n\n\n\nIn arguments of this type, superior explanatory virtues of a theory\nare taken as constituting epistemic support for the acceptability of\nthe theory or for the likely truth of the theory.\n\nThere are, of course, multitudes of purported explanatory, epistemic\nvirtues, including the incomplete list a couple of paragraphs back.\nAssessing hypotheses in terms of such virtues is often contentious.\nThe assessment of \u2018best\u2019 is not only a value-tinged\njudgment, but is notoriously tricky (especially given the ambiguous\nand hard to pinpoint import of the Rs in the present case).\nThere is also the very deep question of why we should think that\nfeatures which we humans find attractive in proposed explanations\nshould be thought to be truth-tracking. What sort of justification\nmight be available here?\n2.3.1 IBE, Likelihood and Bayes\n\nOne key underlying structure in this context is typically traced to\nPeirce\u2019s notion of abduction. Suppose that some\notherwise surprising fact e would be a reasonably expectable\noccurrence were hypothesis h true. That, Peirce\nargued, would constitute at least some provisional reason for thinking\nthat h might be true. Peirce\u2019s own characterization was\nas follows (Peirce 1955, 151):\n\n\nSchema 3:\n\nThe surprising fact, C, is observed.\nBut if A were true, C would be a matter of\ncourse.\n\n\nHence,\n\nThere is reason to suspect that A is true.\n\n\n\nThe measure of C being a \u2018matter of course\u2019 given\nA is frequently described as the degree to which C\ncould be expected were A true. This intuition is\nsometimes\u2014though explicitly not by Peirce\nhimself\u2014formalized in terms of likelihood, defined as\nfollows:\n\nThe likelihood of hypothesis \\(h\\) (given evidence \\(e\\)) =\n\\(P(e | h)\\)\n\n\nThe likelihood of h is the probability of finding evidence\ne given that the hypothesis h is true. In cases of\ncompeting explanatory hypotheses \\(h_1\\) and\n\\(h_2\\) the comparative likelihoods on specified\nevidence can be taken to indicate which of the competitors the\nevidence better supports, i.e.:\n\nLikelihood Principle:\n\n\\( [P(e| h_1) > P(e|h_2)] \\leftrightarrow\\)\n(\\(e\\) supports \\(h_1\\) more than it does \\(h_2\\))\n\n\nHigher likelihood of \\(h_1\\) than \\(h_2\\) on specific evidence does\nnot automatically imply that \\(h_1\\) is likely to be true, or is\nbetter in some overall sense than is \\(h_2\\).  \\(h_1\\) might, in fact,\nbe a completely lunatic theory which nonetheless entails e,\ngiving \\(h_1\\) as high a likelihood as possible. Such maximal\nlikelihood relative to e would not necessarily alter\n\\(h_1\\)\u2019s lunacy. Likelihood thus does not automatically\ntranslate into a measure of how strongly some specific evidence\ne supports the hypothesis \\(h_1\\) in question (Jantzen 2014a,\nChap.  11). Given this limitation, some argue that only a full-blown\nBayesian analysis should be used to assess competing hypotheses. For a\ncontrast between IBE and Bayesianism, see the entry on abduction.\nFor an important recent critique of theistic design arguments in\nBayesian terms, see Sober 2009, the reply in Kotzen 2012, and\nthe response in Jantzen 2014b.\n\nThere are other potential issues here as well. Sober argues that\nwithout additional very specific assumptions about the putative\ndesigner we could specify no particular value for \\(P(e | h)\\) \u2014\ne.g., the likelihood that a designer would produce vertebrate eyes\nwith the specific features we observe. Depending on the specific\nassumptions made we could come up with any value from 0 to 1 (e.g.,\nSober 2003, 38).  Jantzen argues that the same problem applies to any\nlikelihood involving chance as an alternative hypothesis to\ndesign. Chance is equally vague. If we allow the naturalist to fill it\nout in ways that reduce this vagueness, the design theorist should be\naccorded the same benefit (Jantzen 2014a, 184).\n\nThere is also the potential problem of new, previously unconsidered\nhypotheses all lumped together in the catch-all basket. Without\nknowing the details of what specific unconsidered hypotheses might\nlook like, there is simply no plausible way to anticipate the apparent\nlikelihood of a novel new hypothesis. This, on some views, is\nessentially what happened with traditional design arguments. Such\narguments were the most reasonable available until Darwinian evolution\nprovided a plausible (or better) alternative the details and\nlikelihood of which were not previously anticipatable. We should note\nthat the problem of unconsidered hypotheses is an issue for all\nlikelihood arguments, not merely those involving design.\n",
