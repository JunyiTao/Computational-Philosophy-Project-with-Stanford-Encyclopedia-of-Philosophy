Pre-history of Philosophy of Biology\n\nAs is the case for most apparent novelties, closer inspection reveals\na pre-history for the philosophy of biology (Grene & Depew 2004).\nIn the 1950s the biologist J. H. Woodger and the philosopher Morton\nBeckner both published major works on the philosophy of biology\n(Woodger 1952; Beckner 1959), but these did not give rise to a\nsubsequent philosophical literature (though see Ruse 1988). Some\nphilosophers of science also made claims about biology based on\ngeneral epistemological and metaphysical considerations. One of the\nmost famous examples is J. J. C. Smart\u2019s claim that the biology\nis not an autonomous science, but a technological application of more\nbasic sciences, like \u201cradio-engineering\u201d (Smart 1959,\n366). Like engineering, biology cannot make any addition to the laws\nof nature. It can only reveal how the laws of physics and chemistry\nplay out in the context of particular sorts of initial and boundary\nconditions (for more recent discussions of biological laws, see Beatty\n1995; Brandon 1997; Mitchell 1997; Sober 1997; Waters 1998). Even in\n1969 the zoologist Ernst Mayr could complain that books with\n\u2018philosophy of science\u2019 in the title were all misleading\nand should be re-titled \u2018philosophy of physics\u2019 (Mayr\n1969). It is worth noting however that philosophers of science such as\nCarl G. Hempel (1965) and Ernest Nagel (1961) offered accounts of\nfunctional explanation as found in the biological sciences. The\nencouragement of prominent biologists such as Mayr and F. J. Ayala\n(Ayala 1976; Mayr 1982) was one factor in the emergence of the new\nfield. Another factor was that several philosophers of science\nincluding Robert Brandon, Phillip Kitcher, Elisabeth Lloyd, Sahotra\nSarkar, Elliott Sober, and William C. Wimsatt did research at Harvard\nUniversity with the likes of Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, and\nRichard Levins (Callebaut 1993). The first sign of philosophy of\nbiology becoming a mainstream part of philosophy of science was the\npublication of David Hull\u2019s Philosophy of Biological\nScience in the prominent Prentice-Hall Foundations of Philosophy\nseries (Hull 1974). From then on the field developed rapidly. Robert\nBrandon could say of the late 1970\u2019s that \u201cI knew five\nphilosophers of biology: Marjorie Grene, David Hull, Michael Ruse,\nMary Williams and William Wimsatt.\u201d (Brandon 1996,\nxii\u2013xiii) By 1986, however, there were more than enough to fill\nthe pages of Michael Ruse\u2019s new journal Biology and\nPhilosophy. This trend has only increased with the introduction\nof additional journals such as Biological Theory,\nPhilosophy and Practice of Biology, History and\nPhilosophy of the Life Sciences, and Studies in History and\nPhilosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences. \n",
