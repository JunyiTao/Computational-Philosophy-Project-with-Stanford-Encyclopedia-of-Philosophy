But it seems that we\noften have credence changes that do not accompany such as a radical\nrise to certainty, as witnessed by the following case:\n\n\nExample (Mudrunner). A gambler is very\nconfident that a certain racehorse, called Mudrunner, performs\nexceptionally well on muddy courses. A look at the extremely cloudy\nsky has an immediate effect on this gambler\u2019s opinion: an\nincrease in her credence in the proposition \\((\\textsf{muddy})\\) that\nthe course will be muddy\u2014an increase without reaching\ncertainty. Then this gambler raises her credence in the hypothesis\n\\((\\textsf{win})\\) that Mudrunner will win the race, but nothing\nbecomes fully certain. (Jeffrey 1965 [1983: sec. 11.3])\n\n\n\nConditionalization is too inflexible to accommodate this case.\n\nJeffrey proposes a now-standard solution that replaces\nconditionalization by a more flexible process for credence change,\ncalled Jeffrey conditionalization. Recall that\nconditionalization has a defining feature: it preserves the credence\nratios of the possibilities inside new evidence E while the\ncredence in E is raised all the way to 1. Jeffrey\nconditionalization does something similar: it preserves the same\ncredence ratios without having to raise any credence to 1,\nand also preserves some other credence ratios, i.e., the\ncredence ratios of the possibilities outside E. A simple\nversion of Jeffrey\u2019s norm can be stated informally as follows\n(in the style of the tutorial\n section 1.2):\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle of Jeffrey Conditionalization (Simplified\nVersion). It ought to be that, if the direct experiential impact\non one\u2019s credences causes the credence in E to rise to a\nreal number e (which might be less than 1), then one\u2019s\ncredences are changed as follows:\n\nFor the possibilities inside E, rescale their credences\nupward by a common factor so that they sum to e; for the\npossibilities outside E, rescale their credences downward by a\ncommon factor so that they sum to \\(1-e\\) (to obey the rule of\nSum-to-One).\nReset the credence in each proposition H by adding up the\nnew credences in the possibilities inside H (to obey the rule\nof Additivity).\n \n\n\n\nThis reduces to standard conditionalization in the special case that\n\\(e = 1\\). The above formulation is quite simplified; see\n supplement G\n for a general statement. This principle has been defended with a\nDutch Book argument; see Armendt (1980) and Skyrms (1984) for\ndiscussions.\n\nJeffrey conditionalization is flexible enough to accommodate the\nMudrunner Case. Suppose that the immediate effect of the\ngambler\u2019s sky-looking experience is to raise the credence in\n\\(E\\), i.e. \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{muddy})\\). One feature of Jeffrey\nconditionalization is that, since certain credence ratios are required\nto be held constant, one has to hold constant the conditional\ncredences given \\(E\\) and also those given \\(\\neg E\\), such as\n\\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid \\mathsf{muddy})\\) and \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid\n\\neg\\mathsf{muddy})\\). The credences mentioned above can be used to\nexpress \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win})\\) as follows (thanks to Probabilism and\nthe Ratio Formula): \n\\[\\begin{multline}\n        \\Cr(\\mathsf{win}) = \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid \\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{high, held constant} \\wcdot \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{raised} \n    \\\\\n      {}  + \n        \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid \\neg\\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{low, held constant} \\wcdot \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\neg\\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{lowered}.\n    \\end{multline}\\]\n\n\nIt seems natural to suppose that the first conditional credence is\nhigh and the second is low, by the description of the Mudrunner Case.\nThe annotations in the above equation imply that \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win})\\)\nmust go up. This is how Jeffrey conditionalization accommodates the\nMudrunner Case.\n\nAlthough Jeffrey conditionalization is more flexible than\nconditionalization, there is the worry that it is still too inflexible\ndue to something it inherits from conditionalization: the preservation\nof certain credence ratios or conditional credences (Bacchus, Kyburg,\n& Thalos 1990; Weisberg 2009b). Here is an example due to Weisberg\n(2009b: sec. 5):\n\n\n\n\nExample (Red Jelly Bean). An agent with a prior\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}\\) has a look at a jelly bean. The reddish\nappearance of that jelly bean has only one immediate effect on this\nagent\u2019s credences: an increased credence in the proposition\nthat\n\n\\((\\textsf{red})\\)\n there is a red jelly bean.\n\n\nThen this agent comes to have a posterior \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{new}\\). If\nthis agent later learns that\n\n\\((\\textsf{tricky})\\)\n the lighting is tricky,\n\n\nher credence in the redness of the jelly bean will drop. So,\n\n(\\(a\\))\n \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{new}( \\textsf{red} \\mid \\textsf{tricky} ) <\n\\Cr_\\textrm{new}( \\textsf{red} )\\).\n\n\nBut if, instead, the tricky lighting had been learned before\nthe look at the jelly bean, it would not have changed the credence in\nthe jelly bean\u2019s redness; that is:\n\n(\\(b\\))\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}( \\textsf{red} \\mid \\textsf{tricky} ) =\n\\Cr_\\textrm{old}( \\textsf{red} ).\\)\n \n\n\n\nYet it can be proved (with elementary probability theory) that\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{new}\\) cannot be obtained from \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}\\) by a\nJeffrey conditionalization on \\(\\textsf{red}\\) (assuming the two\nconditions \\((a)\\) and \\((b)\\) in the above case, the Ratio Formula,\nand that \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}\\) is probabilistic). See\n supplement H\n for a sketch of proof.\n\nThe above example is used by Weisberg (2009b) not just to argue\nagainst the Principle of Jeffrey Conditionalization, but also to\nillustrate a more general point: that principle is in tension with an\ninfluential thesis called confirmational holism, most\nfamously defended by Duhem (1906) and Quine (1951). Confirmational\nholism says roughly that how one should revise one\u2019s beliefs\ndepends on a good deal of one\u2019s background opinions\u2014such\nas the opinions about the quality of the lighting, the reliability of\none\u2019s vision, the details of one\u2019s experimental setup\n(which are conjoined with a tested scientific theory to predict\nexperimental outcomes). In reply, Konek (forthcoming) develops and\ndefends an even more flexible version of conditionalization, flexible\nenough to be compatible with confirmational holism. For more on\nconfirmational holism, see the entry on\n underdetermination of scientific theory\n and the survey by Ivanova (2021).\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of Jeffrey conditionalization, see the\nsurveys by Joyce (2011: sec. 3.2 and 3.3) and Weisberg (2011: sec. 3.4\nand 3.5).\n\n\n\n",
