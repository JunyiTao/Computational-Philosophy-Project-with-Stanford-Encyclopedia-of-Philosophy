    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (II): The Problem of the Priors || Connection to the Uniqueness Debate\n4.4 Connection to the Uniqueness Debate\n\nThe above approaches to the problem of the priors are mostly developed\nwith this question in mind:\n\n\nThe Question of Norms. What are the correct\nnorms that we can articulate to govern prior credences?\n\n\n\nThe interest in this question leads naturally to a different but\nclosely related question. Imagine that you are unsympathetic to\nsubjective Bayesianism. Then you might try to add one norm after\nanother to narrow down the candidate pool for the permissible priors,\nand you might be wondering what this process might end up with. This\nraises a more abstract question:\n\n\nThe Question of Uniqueness. Given each\npossible body of evidence, is there exactly one permissible credence\nassignment or doxastic state (whether or not we can articulate norms\nto single out that state)?\n\n\n\nImpermissive Bayesianism is the view that says\n\u201cyes\u201d; permissive Bayesianism says\n\u201cno\u201d. The question of uniqueness is often addressed in a\nway that is somewhat orthogonal to the question of norms, as is\nsuggested by the \u2018whether-or-not\u2019 clause in the\nparentheses. Moreover, the uniqueness question is often debated in a\nbroader context that considers not just credences but all possible\ndoxastic states, thus going beyond Bayesian epistemology. Readers\ninterested in the uniqueness question are referred to the survey by\nKopec and Titelbaum (2016).\n\nLet me close this section with some clarifications. The two terms\n\u2018objective Bayesianism\u2019 and \u2018impermissive\nBayesianism\u2019 are sometimes used interchangeably. But those two\nterms are used in the present entry to distinguish two different\nviews, and neither implies the other. For example, many prominent\nobjective Bayesians such as Carnap (1955), Jaynes (1968), and J.\nWilliamson (2010) are not committed to impermissivism, even though\nsome objective Bayesians tend to be sympathetic to impermissivism. For\nelaboration on the point just made, see\n supplement E.\n\n\n",
