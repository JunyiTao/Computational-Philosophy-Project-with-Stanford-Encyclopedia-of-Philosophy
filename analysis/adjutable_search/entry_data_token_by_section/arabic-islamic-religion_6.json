While he believes that there is a\ndefinite proof for God, he is skeptical of the earlier traditional\narguments for God. In most general terms, his concern with earlier\nproofs is that they all proceed from the existence of something other\nthan God and then infer to the existence of God, and yet God is the\nvery ground for the existence of everything else. If anything, God is\nproof of that other. More specifically, Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\ncriticizes the fact that all earlier proofs begin with certain\nconcepts or essences, like necessity and possibility, which are\nmental, and then illicitly infer from concepts of things to their\nexistence, which is extra-mental. This claim is even true for the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument, which begins with the concept of\n\u2018the world\u2019, and then from the assumption that that\nconcept refers and so exists infers the existence of God. For\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 one simply cannot move from mere concepts\nto existence\u2014one must begin with existence itself\u2014and so\nall of these earlier arguments fail.\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s own \u2018proof\u2019 for the\nexistence of God is less a proof for God\u2019s existence than a\npointer that directs one to an experience that one already has and\nthen clarifies that experience. It would be analogous to one who has\nexperienced frogs, toads and salamanders, but then claims that they\nhave never experienced an amphibian. The proof that one has\nexperienced amphibians is to lead them to recognize that their\nexperience of frogs, toads and salamanders is an amphibian-experience.\nIn this vein, Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 draws on the Qur\u2019anic\nverse\u2014\u201cGod (All\u0101h) is witness that there is no god\nbut He\u201d (Qur\u2019an 3.18). He suggests that we all have\nexperienced God, even if we have not recognized that the experience is\nabout God. That is because existence never can be negated or denied.\nFor even if there is non-existence, there is a sense that there\nis something, and while as simple as it might be, that something\nexists. There simply cannot not be existence argues\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, and indeed the experience or knowledge of\nthis existence is present to everyone. Nothing, then, stands above\nexistence (not even non-existence), and yet God just is that existence\nabove which nothing stands. For Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 existence\nis not something static but dynamic, a single reality that varies in\nintensity and modulation (tashk\u012bk). God is existence at\nits greatest intensity and perfection. To be sure, while the\nexperience or belief that there is this existence is basic\nfor everyone, it is not necessary for everyone to experience this\nexistence as God. To be sure, recognizing this existence\nas God might take long practice and training as prescribed by\nSufi masters. Still, one\u2019s experience of this existence as God\nand consequent belief that it is God, which follows upon a knowledge\nby presence, is for Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, properly basic and in\nneed of no further proof.\n",
