    "main_text": "Replacement || Robotics\n4.1 Robotics\n\n\nEarly ventures in robotics took on board the idea that cognition is\ncomputation over symbolic representations. The robot Shakey\n(1966\u20131972) for instance, created at the Artificial Intelligence\nLaboratory at what was then the Stanford Research Institute, was\nprogrammed to navigate through a room, avoiding or pushing blocks of\nvarious shapes and colors. Guiding Shakey\u2019s behavior was a\nprogram, called STRIPS, which operated on symbolically encoded images\nof the blocks, combining them with stored descriptions of\nShakey\u2019s world. As the roboticist Brooks characterizes\nShakey\u2019s architecture, it cycles through iterations of\nsense-model-plan-act sequences (Brooks 1991a). A camera senses the\nenvironment, a computer builds a symbolic model of the environment\nfrom the camera images, the STRIPS program combines the model with\nstored symbolic descriptions of the environment, creating plans for a\ncourse of action. Shakey\u2019s progress was slow\u2014some tasks\nwould take days to complete\u2014and heavily dependent on an\nenvironment carefully structured to make images easier to process.\n\n\nBrooks\u2019s approach to robotics disavows the computational\nprinciples on which Shakey was designed, embracing instead a\nGibsonian-inspired architecture. The result has been robots that\nexhibit far more versatility than Shakey ever displayed\u2014robots\nthat can roam cluttered environments, avoiding obstacles, setting goals\nfor themselves, collecting soda cans for recycling, and more.\nBrooks\u2019s \u201cCreatures\u201d run on what he calls a\nsubsumption architecture. Rather than cycling through\nsense-model-plan-act sequences, Creatures contain arrays of sensors\nthat are connected directly to behavior-generating mechanisms. For\ninstance, the sensors on Brooks\u2019s robot Allen were connected\ndirectly to three different kinds of behavior-generators: Avoid,\nWander, and Explore. When sensors detected an object in Allen\u2019s\npath, the Avoid mechanism would cause Allen to stop its forward\nmotion, turn, and then proceed. The Wander generator would simply send\nAllen along a random heading, while the Explore generator would steer\nAllen toward a selected target. The three kinds of activity\nlayers as Brooks called them, continually compete with each\nother. For instance, if Allen were Wandering and came across an\nobstacle, Avoid would step in and prevent Allen from a\ncollision. Explore could inhibit Wander\u2019s activation in order to\nkeep Allen on course toward a target. From the competitive\ninteractions of the three layers emerged unexpectedly flexible and\nseemingly goal-oriented behavior.\n\n\nAccording to Brooks, his Creatures have no need for representations.\nImplementing an idea from ecological psychology, Brooks says that the\nactivity layers in his robots connect \u201cperception to action\ndirectly\u201d (1991b, 144). A robot designed in this way need not\nrepresent the world because it is able to \u201cuse the world as its\nown model\u201d (1991b, 139). The robot\u2019s behavior evolves\nthrough a continuous loop: the body moves, which changes the\nstimulation its sensors receive, which directly causes new movement,\nand so on. Because nothing stands \u201cin between\u201d the sensory\nsignals and the robot\u2019s behavior, there is no need for something\nthat plays the standard intermediating role of a representational\nstate. The robot does not require, for instance, a model of its\nenvironment in order to navigate through hallways. The move-sense loop\ndoes its job without one.\n\n\nDespite the success of Brooks\u2019s robots in comparison to their\ncomputational ancestors, and the impact Brooks\u2019s ideas have had\non industry (e.g., Roomba vacuum cleaners), whether Brooks\u2019s\ninsights pave the way for a radical, representation-free, cognitive\nscience, as some enactivists like Chemero (2009) and Hutto and Myin\n(2013) believe, is far from certain. A first question concerns whether\nthe behavior of Brooks\u2019s Creatures really proceeds without the\nbenefit of representational states. The sensors with which the\nCreatures are equipped, after all, send signals to the various\nactivity layers so that the layers can respond to objects in the\nenvironment. Moreover, the various layers communicate with each other\nin order to modulate each other\u2019s activities. They are, in\neffect, signaling each other with messages that seem to have a\nsemantics: \u201cgo ahead,\u201d or \u201cstop!\u201d.\n\n\nSkeptics about representation, such as Chemero (2009) and Hutto and\nMyin (2013) focus on the continuous contact that Brooks\u2019s\nCreatures bear to their environments as a reason to deny a role for\nrepresentation. Because a Creature is in constant contact with the\nworld, it does not need to represent the world. But constant contact\ndoes not always obviate a need for representation. Consider, for\ninstance, that an organism might be in constant contact with many\nfeatures of its environment\u2014sunlight, humidity, oxygen, the\ngravitational pull of the moon, and so on. Yet, surely it will be\nsensitive to only some of these features\u2014only some of these\nfeatures will shape the organism\u2019s behavior. A natural way to\ndescribe how some features make a difference to an organism while\nothers do not might appeal to representation\u2014an organism\ndetects some features, represents them, and not others.\nWhether detection of this sort must involve representation will depend\non the theory of representation that one adopts. One might therefore\nsee the success of Brooks\u2019s challenge to representation, and the\nenactivists\u2019 embrace of the challenge, as hostage to a theory of\nrepresentation, the details of which will no doubt themselves be\ncontroversial.\n\n\nAnother response to Brooks\u2019s work doubts whether something like\nthe subsumption architecture, even granting that it makes no use of\nrepresentations, can \u201cscale up\u201d\u2014can produce the more\nadvanced sorts of behavior that cognitive scientists typically\ninvestigate (Shapiro 2007). Matthen (2014) argues that once we move\njust a little beyond the capabilities of Brooks\u2019s Creatures,\nexplanations of behavior will require an appeal to\nrepresentations. For instance, imagine an organism that knows how to\nmove from point A to point B, and from point A to point\nC, and on the basis of this knowledge, \u201cfigures out\u201d\nhow to move from point B to point C (Matthen 2014). It would\nseem that such an organism must possess a representation of the\nrelations between points A, B, and C for such a\ncalculation to be possible.\n\n\nClark and Toribio (1994) describe some cognitive tasks as\n\u201crepresentation-hungry.\u201d Examples include imagining or\nthinking about non-existent entities (e.g., unicorns) or\ncounterfactual states of affairs (what would happen if I sawed through\nthe tree in this direction?). Of necessity, an organism cannot be in\nconstant contact with non-existents. That human beings so readily and\noften entertain such thoughts poses a difficulty for enactivists like\nChemero and Hutto and Myin who see in Brooks\u2019s \u201cworld as\nits own model\u201d slogan a foundation for all or most\ncognition. Because the world contains no unicorns, using the world as\na model cannot explain thoughts about unicorns.\n",
