Situation semantics and implicit domain restrictions\n\nAmong the most innovative ideas in Barwise & Perry 1983 is the\nproposal to exploit the Austinian perspective on utterances to account\nfor implicit quantifier restrictions and so-called\n\u201cincomplete\u201d definite descriptions (see the entry\n descriptions):\n\nSuppose that I am in a room full of people, some of whom are sleeping,\nsome of whom are wide awake. If I say, \u201cno one is\nsleeping,\u201d have I told the truth or not? Again, it depends on\nwhich situation I am referring to. If I am referring to the whole\nsituation including all the people in the room, then what I have said\nis false. However, one can well imagine situations where I am clearly\nreferring only to a part of that situation. Imagine, for example, that\nI am conducting an experiment which requires an assistant to monitor\nsleeping people, and I look around the sleep lab to see if all of my\nassistants are awake and ready to go. Surely, then I may truly and\ninformatively say, \u201cNo one is asleep. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d\n\u2026. The crucial insight needed goes back to Austin \u2026 As\nAustin put it, a statement is true when the actual situation to which\nit refers is of the type described by the statement. (Barwise &\nPerry 1983, 160)\n\n\nA similar example discusses incomplete definite descriptions:\n\nSuppose my wife and I collaborate on cooking for a party. And suppose\nthat at a certain point in the party I say, \u201cI am the\ncook,\u201d referring to l. Is what I said true or not?\n\n\nThe answer is, \u201cIt depends on which situation I am\ndescribing.\u201d First, suppose someone comes up to me and says,\n\u201cThe food at this party is delicious! Who is the cook?\u201d If\nI say \u201cI am the cook,\u201d I have clearly not described things\naccurately. I have claimed to be the person who did the\ncooking for the party. But suppose instead someone comes up to me\neating a piece of my famous cheesecake pastry and says, \u201cWho\nmade this?\u201d Then I may truly say that I am the cook. (Barwise\n& Perry 1983, 159)\n\nOn the Austinian perspective, at least certain kinds of implicit\nrestrictions for quantification domains are a direct consequence of\nthe fact that assertions are about particular actual situations, and\nthat those situations can be smaller or bigger parts of the actual\nworld.\n\nThe Austinian answer to implicit domain restrictions was endorsed and\ndeveloped in R\u00e9canati (1986/87, 1996, 2004a) and Cooper 1996.\nAn influential attack on the situation semantics approach to\n\u201cincomplete\u201d definite descriptions came from Soames 1986,\nwho concluded that \u201cthe analysis of definite descriptions is not\nfacilitated by the kind of partiality that situation semantics\nprovides\u201d (Soames 1986, 368). Soames\u2019 reservations against\nthe Austinian approach to domain restrictions come from two major\npotential counterarguments, both of which are directed against\nparticular implementations of the approach. One of the potential\nproblems discussed by Soames concerns attributive readings of definite\ndescriptions. However, as Soames is careful to note (Soames 1986,\n359), this problem does not necessarily affect possibilistic versions\nof situation semantics. Since Soames\u2019 qualification is not\nelaborated in his article, it might be useful to look at a concrete\nexample illustrating his point. Suppose the two of us observe a bear\ncrossing the road one night in Glacier National Park. Since it is\ndark, we can\u2019t see the bear very well, and I say to you:\n\n(17)\nThe bear might be a grizzly.\n\n\nI am aware that the bear we see is not the only bear in the world, so\nmy assertion relies on an implicit domain restriction. On the\nAustinian view, my assertion is about a particular situation located\nsomewhere in Glacier National Park at a particular time in August\n2006. Call that situation \u201cBear Sighting\u201d. Bear Sighting\nhas a particular bear in it, the bear we see. Call that bear\n\u201cBruno\u201d. On the intended attributive reading, what I want\nto get across to you is not that Bruno may be a grizzly, but that our\nevidence about Bear Sighting is compatible with the assumption that\nthe bear there\u2014whoever he is\u2014is a grizzly. There is a\nlegitimate question whether we can get that reading on the Austinian\napproach to domain restrictions. If Bear Sighting has to give us the\nrestriction for bear, it seems that all it can do is restrict\nthe bears we are talking about to Bruno. But that wouldn\u2019t\nproduce the attributive reading we are after. For that reading, so it\nmight seem, domain restrictions must be properties.\n\nThe above conclusion might look inevitable, but it is not. It is true\nthat on the Austinian view, my utterance of (17) is interpreted as a\nclaim about Bear Sighting. To see that we can nevertheless get the\ndesired interpretation, we need to look at technical details. 18(a)\ngives a plausible interpretation of the possibility modal in (17)\nwithin a possibilistic situation semantics. 18(b) is the\ninterpretation of the whole sentence (17) before the Austinian\ncomponent comes into play:\n\n(18)\n\n\n\na.  \n[[might]]c \n\u03bbp\u03bbs\n\u2203s\u2032[Accc(s)(s\u2032)\n& p(s\u2032)] \n\nb.\n[[(17)]]c\n\u03bbs \u2203s\u2032\n[Accc(s)(s\u2032) &\ngrizzly(\u03b9x\nbear(x)(s\u2032))(s\u2032)] \n\n\n\n(18) assumes an intensional semantics that is based on possible\nsituations. In possible situation semantics, propositions are sets of\npossible situations, or characteristic functions of such sets, and all\npredicates are evaluated with respect to a possible situation. 18(b)\nis the proposition expressed by (17) in context c. That\nproposition is a property that is true of a situation s iff\nthere is a situation s\u2032 that is accessible from\ns and the unique bear in s\u2032 is a grizzly in\ns\u2032. The modal might introduces existential\nquantification over possible situations that are accessible from the\nevaluation situation s (see the entry\n modal logic).\n The kind of accessibility relation is determined by the lexical\nmeaning of the modal in interaction with properties of the utterance\ncontext c (see the entry\n indexicals).\n In our example, the modality is a particular kind of epistemic\nmodality that relates two situations s and s\u2032\nin a context c just in case s and s\u2032\nare equivalent with respect to the information available in\nc, that is, whatever evidence about s is available\nin c isn\u2019t specific enough to distinguish between\ns and s\u2032 (epistemic contextualism).\nEvidence that counts as available for epistemic modals might include\nthe distributed knowledge of the discourse participants (see von\nFintel & Gillies 2011), other available sources of information\nlike ship\u2019s logs or computer printouts (Hacking 1967, von Fintel\n& Gillies 2011), but, interestingly, not necessarily information\nthat happens to be hidden from sight like test results in sealed\nenvelopes (de Rose 1991), babies in wombs (Teller 1972), weather\nconditions behind drawn curtains (Gillies 2001), or details of animals\nobscured by darkness. Suppose the actual bear in Bear Sighting is in\nfact a black bear, and not a grizzly. Since it is night and we\ncan\u2019t see the bear very well, the evidence we have about Bear\nSighting when I utter (17) cannot distinguish the real situation from\nmany merely possible ones, including some where the bear is a grizzly\nand not a black bear. This is what makes my utterance of (17)\ntrue.\n\nWhen I uttered (17), I claimed that the proposition in 18(b) was true\nof Bear Sighting. Applying 18(b) to Bear Sighting yields the desired\nattributive interpretation. Bear Sighting is exploited to provide\nimplicit domain restrictions, but it doesn\u2019t do so directly. We\nare considering epistemic alternatives of Bear Sighting. The epistemic\nalternatives are alternatives of Bear Sighting, hence are partial,\njust as Bear Sighting itself is. They have no more than a single bear\nin them. This suggests that the analysis of definite descriptions\nis facilitated by the kind of partiality that situation\nsemantics provides. Austinian topic situations can give us domain\nrestrictions for attributive definite descriptions.\n\nSoames\u2019 second major objection against the Austinian approach to\ndomain restrictions relates to the fact that there are instances of\ndomain restrictions that can\u2019t seem to come from Austinian topic\nsituations (see also Westerst\u00e5hl 1985). One of Soames\u2019\nexamples is (19) below (Soames 1986, 357), which is a variation of\nBarwise and Perry\u2019s sleep lab example quoted above.\n\n(19)\nEveryone is asleep and is being monitored by a research\nassistant.\n\n\nIf all quantifier domains were provided by Austinian topic situations,\n(19) would seem to make contradictory demands on such a situation.\nAssuming that there is just a single topic situation for utterances of\n(19), we seem to predict that those utterances imply that the research\nassistants are among those who are asleep. But there is no such\nimplication. Soames is aware that proponents of the Austinian approach\nare not committed to the assumption that all domain\nrestrictions are directly provided by Austinian topic situations\n(Soames 1986, footnote 17, 371), and he therefore emphasizes that he\nis only commenting on the particular account of domain restrictions\noffered in Barwise and Perry (1983, 1985). Soames\u2019 objection\ndoes not apply to Cooper 1996, for example, who allows quantifier\ndomains to be determined by different resource situations, which he\ndistinguishes from the Austinian topic situation (his \u201cdescribed\nsituation\u201d). The objection also does not apply to possibilistic\nversions of situation semantics, where every predicate is necessarily\nevaluated with respect to an actual or possible situation. Different\npredicates in one and the same sentence can then be evaluated with\nrespect to different situations (Heim 1990, Percus 2000, Elbourne\n2002, 2005, 2013). A possible interpretation for (19) might be\n(20):\n\n(20)\n\u03bbs \u2200x [\n[person(x)(s\u2032) & s\u2032\n\u2264p s] \u2192\n[asleep(x)(s) & \u2203y\n[research-assistant(y)(s) &\nmonitoring(x)(y)(s)] ] ]\n\n\nWhen the doctor of the sleep lab utters (19), she claims that the\nproposition in (20) is true of a particular situation, call it\n\u201cSleep Lab\u201d. Sleep Lab is the Austinian topic situation,\nbut it is not the situation that picks out the sleepers. The sleepers\nmight be recruited from a contextually salient (possibly scattered)\nsituation s\u2032 that is related to Sleep Lab via the part\nrelation \u2264p and functions as a resource\nsituation for the evaluation of the predicate person\nintroduced by the quantifier phrase everyone. This situation\ncould be the sum of the patients in the lab, for example.\n\nNeither topic nor resource situations have to be posited for the\nexclusive need of domain restriction. In a possibilistic situation\nsemantics resource situations are the kind of entities that the\nevaluation of any predicate routinely depends on. Topic situations,\ntoo, are independently needed: they are the situations that assertions\nand beliefs are about, and they are key players in the semantics of\ntense and aspect. This means that the contribution of topic and\nresource situations to domain restriction comes entirely for free.\nMany instances of domain restrictions can thus be explained without\npositing any special devices. Some of the remaining cases might also\nbe accounted for by independently attested mechanisms including\nsyntactic ellipsis, presupposition projection and conversational\nimplicatures. But there is also exaggeration, taboo related omissions,\nand some such. The implicit domain restriction in the following\nsentence, which appeared on a note posted in a bathroom in York\n(England), might very well fall in the last-mentioned category:\n\n(21)\nPlease do not dispose of anything down the toilet, except toilet\npaper.\n\n\nIt is hard to see how any theory would want to literally prevent any\nkind of pragmatic enrichment processes (R\u00e9canati 1993, 2002,\n2004) from contributing to implicit quantifier restrictions, given\nthat humans are able to \u201cinterpret utterances replete with\nirony, metaphor, elision, anacoluthon, aposiopesis, and on top of all\nof this \u2026identify what a speaker is implying as well\nas saying\u201d (Neale 2004, 123). Implicit domain restrictions are\nlikely to be the byproducts of a number of independently attested\nmechanisms, then.\n",
