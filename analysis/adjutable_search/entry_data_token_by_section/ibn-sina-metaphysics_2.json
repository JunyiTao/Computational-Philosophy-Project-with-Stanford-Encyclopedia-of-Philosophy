    "main_text": "Metaphysics Between Ontology and Theology || The Meaning of the Dual Definition\n2.2 The Meaning of the Dual Definition\n\nAvicenna\u2019s dual characterization of metaphysics results in a\nprofound connection between theology and ontology. Inasmuch as It\nexists, the First Principle partially coincides with the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics, so that theology is included in\nontology: the existence of God is part of existence\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 14, 4\u201310: the Principle is\nthe Principle of part of being). The dual definition of metaphysics\nreflects a twofold way of considering existence or being itself: when\nit is taken as set apart from any condition, and hence taken to be\nabsolute, being is the subject-matter of metaphysical investigation.\nOn the contrary, when it is identified as the being of the Principle,\nit is necessarily defined as uncaused. In fact, the definition of\nmetaphysics as a science and its twofold denomination derive from a\nlogical-predicative distinction: being is either not on condition\nof (min \u0121ayr \u0161ar\u1e6d)\u2014and is hence\nan undetermined common being\u2014or is on condition of not\nand requires that (non-relational) predications be excluded. In more\ntechnical terms (analogous distinctions define quiddity and genus in\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t,V,1 and V,3) being is either not on\nthe condition of adding a determination (l\u0101\nbi-\u0161ar\u1e6di al-ziy\u0101da)\u2014and can therefore be\nunconditionally predicated of everything\u2014or is on the\ncondition of not adding a composition (ma\u02bfa\n\u0161ar\u1e6di l\u0101 ziy\u0101dati tark\u012bb;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 13, 8\u201313; VIII, 4, 347,\n10\u201316; Porro 2011b; Lizzini 2013). In the latter case, being\nconstitutes the divine being which is the research object of\nmetaphysics, i.e., the answer to the questions: does an uncaused\nprinciple exist? And if so, what are its properties? \n",
