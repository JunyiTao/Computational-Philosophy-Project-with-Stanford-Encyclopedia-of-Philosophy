    "main_text": "Equality of Educational Opportunity\u2019s Tensions with Other Values || The Target of Equal Educational Opportunity: Individuals or Groups?\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has provided analysis of key positions in debates about\nequality of educational opportunity. We began by describing the\nreasons for being concerned about equality in this arena and then\nsurveyed debates about the value and distribution of such\nopportunities. As the above discussion highlights, the realization of\nthe ideal of equality of educational opportunity may be frustrated by\ncompeting conceptions of what equality itself entails, and also by\nother important values that are in tension with equalizing education\nopportunities (e.g., respecting family autonomy). Social scientific\nadvances in recent years have clarified our understanding of the\nmechanisms behind children\u2019s unequal access to educational\nopportunities, and the consequences of those inequalities for social\nmobility (e.g., Chetty et al. 2014; Duncan & Murnane 2011). This\nknowledge enables policymakers to target interventions to areas that\nwill be most impactful (e.g., growing recognition of the importance of\nearly childhood education). But value tensions of the sort highlighted\nin this entry will persist, and they warrant ongoing attention by\nphilosophers as our understanding of the causes and consequences of\neducational inequalities sharpens.\n",
