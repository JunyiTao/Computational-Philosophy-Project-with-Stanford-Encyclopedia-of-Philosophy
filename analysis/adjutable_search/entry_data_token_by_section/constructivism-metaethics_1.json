    "main_text": "Varieties of Kantian Constructivism\n2. Varieties of Kantian Constructivism\n\nKantian constructivism is defended in a variety of ways, but its\ndistinguishing feature is that it understands the nature of moral and\nnormative truths based on considerations about the basic features of\nrational agency. On this view, reasons for being moral do not spring\nfrom our interests or desires; instead, they are rooted in our nature\nas rational agents. Insofar as moral obligations are justified in\nterms of rational requirements, they are universally and necessarily\nbinding for all rational beings. Because of its claim about the\nuniversal authority of reason and obligations, Kantian Constructivism\nis regarded as the most ambitious form of metaethical constructivism.\nIn this section, we will consider three main varieties, starting with\nthe constructivist interpretation of Kant\u2019s ethics.\n",
