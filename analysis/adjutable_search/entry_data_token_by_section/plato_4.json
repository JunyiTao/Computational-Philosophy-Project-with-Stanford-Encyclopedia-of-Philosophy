    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s indirectness\n5. Plato\u2019s indirectness\n\nSocrates, it should be kept in mind, does not appear in all of\nPlato\u2019s works. He makes no appearance in Laws, and\nthere are several dialogues (Sophist, Statesman,\nTimaeus) in which his role is small and peripheral, while\nsome other figure dominates the conversation or even, as in the\nTimaeus and Critias, presents a long and elaborate,\ncontinuous discourse of their own. Plato\u2019s dialogues are not a\nstatic literary form; not only do his topics vary, not only do his\nspeakers vary, but the role played by questions and answers is never\nthe same from one dialogue to another. (Symposium, for\nexample, is a series of speeches, and there are also lengthy speeches\nin Apology, Menexenus, Protagoras,\nCrito, Phaedrus, Timaeus, and\nCritias; in fact, one might reasonably question whether these\nworks are properly called dialogues). But even though Plato constantly\nadapted \u201cthe dialogue form\u201d (a commonly used term, and\nconvenient enough, so long as we do not think of it as an unvarying\nunity) to suit his purposes, it is striking that throughout his career\nas a writer he never engaged in a form of composition that was widely\nused in his time and was soon to become the standard mode of\nphilosophical address: Plato never became a writer of philosophical\ntreatises, even though the writing of treatises (for example, on\nrhetoric, medicine, and geometry) was a common practice among his\npredecessors and contemporaries. (The closest we come to an exception\nto this generalization is the seventh letter, which contains a brief\nsection in which the author, Plato or someone pretending to be him,\ncommits himself to several philosophical points\u2014while insisting,\nat the same time, that no philosopher will write about the deepest\nmatters, but will communicate his thoughts only in private discussion\nwith selected individuals. As noted above, the authenticity of\nPlato\u2019s letters is a matter of great controversy; and in any\ncase, the author of the seventh letter declares his opposition to the\nwriting of philosophical books. Whether Plato wrote it or not, it\ncannot be regarded as a philosophical treatise, and its author did not\nwish it to be so regarded.) In all of his writings\u2014except in the\nletters, if any of them are genuine\u2014Plato never speaks to his\naudience directly (see Frede 1992) and in his own voice. Strictly\nspeaking, he does not himself affirm anything in his dialogues;\nrather, it is the interlocutors in his dialogues who are made by Plato\nto do all of the affirming, doubting, questioning, arguing, and so on.\nWhatever he wishes to communicate to us is conveyed indirectly.\n",
