    "main_text": "Humanity and Brotherhood\n6. Humanity and Brotherhood\n\n\nThese two concepts, humanity and brotherhood, feature prominently in\nAfrican social and moral thought and practice. They are among the moral\nor human values that constitute the basic\u2014perhaps the\nultimate\u2014criteria that not only motivate but also justify human\nactions that affect other human beings. In African terms, humanity is\nnot just an anthropological term; it is also a moral term when it comes\nto considering the relations between members of the human species. The\nterm \u2018brotherhood\u2019 has come to refer to an association of\nmen and/or women with common aims and interests. But the notion of\nbrotherhood is essentially a moral notion, for it is about the\nrelations between individual human beings that make for their own\ninterest and well-being. There is some affiliation between humanity and\nbrotherhood in African ethical conceptions: if we are human, we are\n(must be) brothers, in a capacious, comprehensive sense of the word\n\u2018brother\u2019 (to be discussed shortly).\n\n\nWe start our discussion with the Akan maxim:\n\nHumanity has no boundary.\n(Honam mu nni nhanoa)\n\n\n\nThe Akan maxim literally means: \u2018In human flesh there is no\nedge of cultivation\u2014no boundary\u2019 (nhanoa). The\nmaxim can be interpreted as meaning that \u2018all humankind is one\nspecies\u2019, thus, that \u2018Humanity has no boundary.\u2019 When\nthe farmer cultivates his land, he does it up to a limit, an edge (in\nAkan: nhanoa, edge, boundary) where he has to stop, otherwise\nhe would trespass on another farmer's land. There is, thus, a\nlimit to the area of cultivation of land. But this, the maxim invites\nus to realize, is not so in the cultivation of the friendship and\nfellowship of human beings; the boundaries of that form of\ncultivation are limitless. For, humanity is of one kind; all humankind\nis one species, with shared basic values, feelings, hopes, and\ndesires.\n\n\nThis is most probably the reason why in almost all the autochthonous\nAfrican languages (here I exclude African languages, like Hausa and\nSwahili, that have borrowed a substantial number of Arabic words) there\nis really no word for \u2018race.\u2019 There are, instead, the words\n\u2018person\u2019, \u2018human being\u2019, and\n\u2018people.\u2019 So that, where others would speak in terms of\n\u2018the black race\u2019 or \u2018the white race\u2019, Africans\nwould say, \u2018black people\u2019, \u2018white people\u2019, and\nso on. And, instead of \u2018people of mixed race\u2019, they\nwould say, \u2018people of mixed blood.\u2019 The latter expression,\nhowever, is somewhat vague, since it also describes people of dual\nethnic parentage in African societies. But, in terms of the African\nperception of humanity, the important point is that the offspring of\nany \u2018blood mixing\u2019 is a human being and therefore belongs\nto the one human \u2018race\u2019 of which we are all a part. Thus,\neven though the African people traditionally live in small communities\nand are divided into different ethnic or cultural groups and into clans\nand lineages with complex networks of relationships, nevertheless, they\nperceive humanity to embrace all other peoples beyond their narrow\ngeographic or spatial confines, to constitute all human beings into one\nuniversal family of humankind. Even though this family is fragmented\ninto a multiplicity of peoples and cultures, nevertheless, it is a\nshared family\u2014a shared humanity\u2014the relationships among\nwhose members ought to feature a certain kind of morality: the morality\nof a shared humanity\n\n\nThe common membership of one universal human family constitutes\n(should constitute) a legitimate basis for the idea of universal human\nbrotherhood (or unity). This idea is depicted in, for instance, the\nAkan maxim:\n\nA human being's brother is a (or another) human being.\n (Or, \u2018Man's brother is man.\u2019)\n(Onipa nua ne onipa)\n\n\nThe maxim asserts unmistakably that a human being can be related\nonly to another human being, not to a\nbeast. Implicit in the African perception of humanity is the\nrecognition of all persons, irrespective of their racial or ethnic\nbackgrounds, as brothers. This is the reason why in African cultures\nthe word \u2018brother\u2019 is used to cover various and complex\nfamily relationships linked by blood ties. But the word is also used,\nsignificantly, by persons between whom there are no blood ties; thus,\nthe word is used comprehensively. The comprehensive meaning given to\nthe word \u2018brother\u2019 in African cultures is intended,\nindeed, to lift people up from the purely biologically determined\nblood relation level onto the human level, the level where the essence\nof humanity is held as transcending the contingencies of human\nbiology, race, ethnicity, or culture.\n\n\nA practical translation of the idea of brotherhood leads to such\nsocial and moral virtues as hospitality, generosity, concern for\nothers, and communal feeling. Several writers, including European\ntravelers to Africa in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,\nhave remarked upon these virtues as practiced in African social and\nmoral life. A Briton who spent about three decades in Central Africa\nfrom the latter part of the nineteenth century to the early part of the\ntwentieth century made the following observation:\n\nHospitality is one of the most sacred and ancient customs of\nBantuland, and is found everywhere. A native will give his\nbest house and his evening meal to a guest, without the slightest\nthought that he is doing anything extraordinary (Dugald\nCampbell, 1922: 45, emphasis added).\n\n\nAnd a contemporary African writer also notes:\n\nOne of the achievements of our [African] society was the universal\nhospitality on which they [i.e., members of the community and others]\ncould rely (Julius Nyerere, 1968: 5).\n\n\nMost people, including foreign visitors to Africa, often testify, in amazement, to\nthe ethic of hospitality and generosity of the\nAfrican people. That ethic is an expression of the perception of our\ncommon humanity and universal human brotherhood.\n\n\nAs regards the African conception of the worth and dignity of the\nhuman being, there is time to refer only to a couple of Akan maxims.\nOne such maxim is:\n\nThe human being is more beautiful than gold.\n(onipa ye fe sen sika)\n\n\nIn this maxim a human being is depicted as beautiful. That which is\nbeautiful is enjoyed for its own sake, not for the sake of anything\nelse. What the maxim is saying, therefore, is that a human being is to\nbe enjoyed for his or her own sake. To enjoy a human being for his/her\nown sake means you should appreciate his value as a human being and\ndemonstrate that appreciation by showing compassion, generosity, and\nhospitality. It means you should be open to the interests and welfare\nof others and feel it a moral duty to offer help where it is needed. To\nenjoy a human being also means you should recognize the other person as a\nfellow individual whose worth as a human being is equal to yours and\nwith whom you undoubtedly share basic values, ideals, and sentiments.\nThus, the main intent of the maxim is to point out the worth of a human\nbeing and the respect that ought to be given to her by virtue of her\nhumanity. Recognition of the worth of a human being is, according to\nthe maxim, more important than caring for wealth.\n\n\nKenneth Kaunda describes in some detail how the enjoyment of people\nis expressed in practical terms: \n\nOur conversation is a good example of this [enjoyment of people].  We\nwill talk for hours with any stranger who crosses our path and by the\ntime we part there will be little we do not know about each other. We\ndo not regard it as impertinence or an invasion of our privacy for\nsomeone to ask \u2018personal\u2019 questions, nor have we\ncompunction about questioning others in like manner. We are open to\nthe interests of other people. Our curiosity does not stem from a\ndesire to interfere in someone else's business but is an\nexpression of our belief that we are wrapped up together in this\nbundle of life and therefore a bond already exists between myself\nand a stranger before we open our mouths to talk (Kaunda, 1966:\n32). \n\n\nThe value of the human being is expressed also in the following\nmaxim:\n\nIt is the human being that counts: I call upon gold, it answers\nnot; I call upon cloth, it answers not; it is the human being that\ncounts.\n(Onipa ne asem: mefre sika a, sika nnye so, mefre ntama\na, ntama nnye so; onipa ne asem.)\n\n\n\nThe maxim says that it is only the human being that is of\nreal value, for in times of need or distress, if you appeal to gold and\nother material possessions they will not respond; only a human being\nwill. For these reasons, the worth of the human being is of the\nultimate consequence and ought therefore to be given the ultimate\nconsideration. From such maxims one can appreciate why human welfare\nand concern constitute the preoccupation of African ethics.\n",
