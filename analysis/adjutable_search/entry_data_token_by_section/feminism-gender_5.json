    "main_text": "Gender as socially constructed || Gender as feminine and masculine sexuality\n2.3 Gender as feminine and masculine sexuality\n\nCatharine MacKinnon develops her theory of gender as a theory of\nsexuality. Very roughly: the social meaning of sex (gender) is created\nby sexual objectification of women whereby women are viewed and\ntreated as objects for satisfying men\u2019s desires\n(MacKinnon 1989). Masculinity is defined as sexual dominance,\nfemininity as sexual submissiveness: genders are \u201ccreated\nthrough the eroticization of dominance and submission. The man/woman\ndifference and the dominance/submission dynamic define each other.\nThis is the social meaning of sex\u201d (MacKinnon 1989, 113). For\nMacKinnon, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining\ngenders (or masculinity and femininity) we must make reference to\nsocial factors (see Haslanger 1995, 98). In particular, we must make\nreference to the position one occupies in the sexualised\ndominance/submission dynamic: men occupy the sexually dominant\nposition, women the sexually submissive one. As a result, genders are\nby definition hierarchical and this hierarchy is\nfundamentally tied to sexualised power relations. The notion of\n\u2018gender equality\u2019, then, does not make sense to MacKinnon.\nIf sexuality ceased to be a manifestation of dominance, hierarchical\ngenders (that are defined in terms of sexuality) would cease\nto exist.\n\nSo, gender difference for MacKinnon is not a matter of having a\nparticular psychological orientation or behavioural pattern; rather,\nit is a function of sexuality that is hierarchal in patriarchal\nsocieties. This is not to say that men are naturally disposed\nto sexually objectify women or that women are naturally\nsubmissive. Instead, male and female sexualities are socially\nconditioned: men have been conditioned to find women\u2019s\nsubordination sexy and women have been conditioned to find a\nparticular male version of female sexuality as erotic \u2013 one in\nwhich it is erotic to be sexually submissive. For MacKinnon, both\nfemale and male sexual desires are defined from a male point of view\nthat is conditioned by pornography (MacKinnon 1989, chapter 7).\nBluntly put: pornography portrays a false picture of \u2018what women\nwant\u2019 suggesting that women in actual fact are and want to be\nsubmissive. This conditions men\u2019s sexuality so that they view\nwomen\u2019s submission as sexy. And male dominance enforces this\nmale version of sexuality onto women, sometimes by force.\nMacKinnon\u2019s thought is not that male dominance is a result of\nsocial learning (see 2.1.); rather, socialization is an expression of\npower. That is, socialized differences in masculine and feminine\ntraits, behaviour, and roles are not responsible for power\ninequalities. Females and males (roughly put) are socialised\ndifferently because there are underlying power inequalities. As\nMacKinnon puts it, \u2018dominance\u2019 (power relations) is prior\nto \u2018difference\u2019 (traits, behaviour and roles) (see,\nMacKinnon 1989, chapter 12). MacKinnon, then, sees legal restrictions\non pornography as paramount to ending women\u2019s subordinate status\nthat stems from their gender.\n",
