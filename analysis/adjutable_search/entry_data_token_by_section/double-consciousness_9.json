    "main_text": "Du Boisian Double-Consciousness after Souls?\n4. Du Boisian Double-Consciousness after Souls?\n\nCommentators are agreed that while Du Bois names\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d and uses the concept in his own way\nin that 1903 text, the term does not reappear in any of his subsequent\ntexts. That does not mean he abandons the concept, of course, yet most\nof the commentary on the concept focuses on the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text in Souls. There have been some\nattempts to interpret various of his other works in terms of the\nconception, but these tend to focus on his fictional writings, and the\nuse made of these is not primarily to develop the conception but\nrather to show its uses by Du Bois in other contexts. This is\nundoubtedly due both to the canonical status of that 1903 text in\nAfrican-American literature and social criticism and to the fact of\nits very singular use there. More than one writer has asserted that\nthe passage in which Du Bois presents the term is the most-referenced\ntext in all African-American letters.\n\nIt seems problematic, however, to pin a full-blown account of and\ntheoretical reconstruction on one passage in one work, however seminal\nor influential it may have been. So it may be useful to examine\nseveral later texts of Du Bois\u2019s to see if the claim some\ncommentators have made that Du Bois abandons the conception after 1903\ncan be substantiated or rejected. There are discussions in later texts\nthat seem to involve aspects, at least, of the 1903 conception.\n",
