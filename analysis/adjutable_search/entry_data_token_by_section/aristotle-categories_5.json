    "main_text": "The Four-Fold Division || A Recent Debate\n1.5 A Recent Debate\n\nThe way in which I have characterized the concepts of said-of and\npresent-in is, as I have said, natural and relatively straightforward.\nMoreover, it was by far the orthodox interpretation amongst\nAristotle\u2019s Medieval interpreters. I would be remiss, however,\nwere I not to mention the recent debate started by G.E.L. Owen about\nthe said-of/present-in distinction (Owen, 1965a). According to Owen,\nAristotle did not accept the existence of non-substantial particulars.\nInstead, Owen argues, a being that is not said-of but present-in\nprimary substances is an accidental universal of the lowest possible\ngenerality. Hence, Owen denies that the said-of/not-said-of\ndistinction is one between universals and particulars. I shall not\ndiscuss Owen\u2019s interpretation but shall simply note that it has\nspawned a huge deal of scholarly attention. The interested reader can\nfind a discussion of these issues here:\n\nSupplement on Nonsubstantial Particulars\n for\n Aristotle Metaphysics\n\n",
