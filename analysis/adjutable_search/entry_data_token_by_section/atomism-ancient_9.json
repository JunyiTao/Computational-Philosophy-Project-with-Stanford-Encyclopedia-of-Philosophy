    "main_text": "Ancient Greek Atomism || Epicurean Atomism\n2.5 Epicurean Atomism\n\nDemocritus\u2019 atomism was revived in the early Hellenistic period:\nEpicurus (341\u2013270 BCE) founded an atomist school in Athens about\n306 BCE. The Epicureans formed more of a closed community than other\nschools, and promoted a philosophy of a simple, pleasant life lived\nwith friends. The community included women, and some of its members\nraised children. The works of the founder were revered and some of\nthem were memorized, a practice that was thought to have discouraged\nphilosophical innovation by later members of the school, although this\nview has been challenged (Fish and Sanders 2011).\n\nEpicurus seems to have learned of atomist doctrine through\nDemocritus\u2019 follower Nausiphanes. Because Epicurus made some\nsignificant changes in atomist theory, it is often thought that his\nreformulation of the physical theory is an attempt to respond to\nAristotle\u2019s criticisms of Democritus. Even more significant,\nhowever, is the increasing centrality of ethical concerns to\nEpicurus\u2019 atomism, and the importance of the view that belief in\nan atomist physical theory helps us live better lives.\n\nEpicurus takes to heart a problem Democritus himself recognized, which\nis that atomist theory threatens to undermine itself if it removes any\ntrust we can place in the evidence of the senses, by claiming that\ncolors, etc. are unreal. He notoriously said that \u2018all\nperception is true,\u2019 apparently distinguishing between the\ncausal processes which impact our senses, all of which originate with\nthe films of atoms sloughed off by objects, and the judgments we make\non the basis of them, which may be false. Reasoning to truths about\nthings that are not apparent\u2014like the existence of\natoms\u2014depends on the evidence of the senses, which is always\ntrue in that it consists of impacts from actually existing films. For\nparticular phenomena, like meteorological events, Epicurus endorses\nthe existence of multiple valid explanations, acknowledging that we\nmay have no evidence for preferring one explanation over another.\n\nIt may be that Epicurus was less troubled by any such epistemological\nuncertainties because of his emphasis on the value of atomist theory\nfor teaching us how to live the untroubled and tranquil life. Denying\nany divine sanction for morality, and holding that the experience of\npleasure and pain are the source of all value, Epicurus thought we can\nlearn from atomist philosophy that pursuing natural and necessary\npleasures\u2014rather than the misleading desires inculcated by\nsociety\u2014will make pleasure readily attainable. At the same time,\nwe will avoid the pains brought on by pursuing unnatural and\nunnecessary pleasures. Understanding, on the basis of the atomist\ntheory, that our fears of the gods and of death are groundless will\nfree us from our chief mental pains.\n\nEpicurus made significant changes to atomist physical theory. It seems\nthat Democritus did not distinguish clearly between the physical\nuncuttability of atoms and their conceptual indivisibility: this\nraises a problem about how atoms can have parts, as evidenced by their\nvariations in shape or their ability to compose a magnitude, touching\none another in a series on different sides. Epicurus distinguished the\ntwo, holding that uncuttable atoms did have conceptually distinct\nparts, but that there was a lowest limit to these. Different solutions\nto this problem are found in ancient Indian atomism.\n\nEpicurus\u2019 view of the motion of atoms also differs from\nDemocritus\u2019. Rather than talking of a motion towards the center\nof a given cosmos, possibly created by the cosmic vortex, Epicurus\ngrants to atoms an innate tendency to downward motion through the\ninfinite cosmos. The downward direction is simply the original\ndirection of atomic fall. This may be in response to Aristotelian\ncriticisms that Democritus does not show why atomic motion exists,\nmerely saying that it is eternal and that it is perpetuated by\ncollisions. Moreover, although this is not attested in the surviving\nwritings of Epicurus, authoritative later sources attribute to him the\nidea that it belongs to the nature of atoms occasionally to exhibit a\nslight, otherwise uncaused swerve from their downward path. This is\nthought to explain why atoms have from infinite time entered into\ncollisions instead of falling in parallel paths: it is also said, by\nLucretius, to enter into the account of action and responsibility.\nScholars have proposed a number of alternative interpretations as to\nhow this is thought to work.\n\nThe epistemological concerns discussed above required a different view\non the nature of composites and macroscopic, perceptible properties.\nEpicurus rejected Democritus\u2019 eliminativist position that\nperceived properties only exist \u2018by convention\u2019 (Sedley\n1988; O\u2019Keefe 2005). Epicurus\u2019 successor Polystratus\nfurther defended and elaborated a claim about the reality of\nproperties, including relational properties. Moreover, with the\nrecovery of new papyrological evidence, controversy has arisen about\nthe extent to which Epicurus rejected Democritus\u2019 attempt to\naccount for all causal processes by the properties of the atoms and\nvoid alone. Although Epicurus\u2019 ideas have long been known from\nthree surviving letters preserved in the biography by Diogenes\nLaertius, no copy of his longer work On Nature had been\navailable. However, following excavation of the Epicurean library at\nHerculaneum that was buried by a volcanic eruption, some parts of this\nwork are being recovered. Many of the scrolls found are badly damaged,\nhowever, and interpretation of this newly recovered material is\nongoing.\n\nThe Herculaneum library contains much work of the Epicurean Philodemus\n(1st c. BCE). Philodemus wrote extensively, including on the history\nof philosophy, ethics, music, poetry, rhetoric and the emotions. He\nwrote a treatise on the theory of signs: because they are empiricists,\nbelieving that all knowledge comes from our sense experience, later\nEpicureans were concerned about the basis for our knowledge of\nimperceptibles like the atoms, and engaged in an extensive debate with\nthe Stoics about the grounds for inferences to imperceptible\nentities.\n\nAlthough Epicurus\u2019 doctrines teach the value of a quiet life in\na specially constructed Epicurean community and decry the search for\nfame, atomist theory is also regarded as a cure for the troubles\nafflicting others outside the community, and there are certainly\nEpicurean texts written for a wider audience. Besides the letters by\nEpicurus himself summarizing his doctrines, the Epicurean philosopher\nLucretius (d. c. 50 BCE) wrote a long Latin poem advocating\nEpicurus\u2019 ideas to Roman audiences (Sedley 1998). Lucretius\nmakes clear his close allegiance to Epicurus\u2019 own views, and\nprovides more detail on some topics than has survived from\nEpicurus\u2019 own work, such as an extended account of the origins\nof human society and institutions. A less sympathetic contemporary of\nLucretius, Cicero, also wrote a number of Latin works in which an\nEpicurean spokesman presents the doctrines of the school.\n\nDiogenes of Oenoanda propagated Epicurean doctrines in Asia Minor,\ninscribing them on the wall of a Stoa in his home town so as to\nconvert passersby to Epicurean theory. Excavation of these since the\nnineteenth century has also produced new texts. Smith (1993), in his\nlatest edition of the text of the inscriptions, dates them to the\nearly second century CE.\n",
