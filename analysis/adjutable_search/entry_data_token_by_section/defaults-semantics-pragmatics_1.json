    "main_text": "Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics || Default Reasoning\n1.2 Default Reasoning\n\nBe that as it may, default meanings come from default reasoning.\nAccording to Kent Bach (1984), in utterance interpretation we use\n\u2018jumping to conclusions\u2019, or \u2018default\nreasoning\u2019. In other words, speakers know when context-dependent\ninference from the content of the sentence is required and when it is\nnot. When it is not required, they progress, unconsciously, to the\nfirst available and unchallenged alternative. This step is cancellable\nwhen it becomes obvious to the addressee that the resulting meaning is\nnot what the speaker had intended. What is important in this view is\nthe proposed distinction between (conscious) inference and the\nunconscious act of \u2018taking a step\u2019, as Bach (1984: 40)\ncalls it, towards the enriched, default interpretation. Such a move to\nthe default meaning is not preceded by a conscious act of deliberation\nas to whether this meaning was indeed intended by the speaker. Rather,\nit just goes through unless it is stopped by some contextual or other\nfactors that render it implausible.\n\nBach founds his account on the Gricean theory of intentional\ncommunication and therefore he has a ready explanation for the fact\nthat different meanings come with different salience. He makes an\nassumption that intentions allow for different degrees of strength\n(Bach 1987). He also adds that salience has a lot to do with\nstandardisation (Bach 1995; 1998) which consists of interpreting an\nutterance according to a pattern that is established by previous usage\nand as such short-circuits the process of (conscious) inference. In\nshort, \u2018jumping to conclusions\u2019 is performed unconsciously\nand effortlessly.\n\nFor Bach, such default meanings are neither implicatures nor what is\nsaid (or explicatures): they are implicit in what is said, or\nimplicitures. They are a result of \u2018fleshing out\u2019\nthe meaning of the sentence in order to arrive at the intended\nproposition, or \u2018filling in\u2019 some conceptual gaps in the\nsemantic representation that, only after this filling in, becomes a\nfull proposition. An example of \u2018fleshing out\u2019 is given in\n(6b), where the minimal proposition is expanded. \u2018Filling\nin\u2019 is exemplified in (7b), where a so-called propositional\nradical is completed.\n\n(6a)Tom is too young.\n(6b)Tom is too young to drive a car.\n(7a)Everybody likes philosophy.\n(7b)Everybody who reads the SEP likes philosophy.\n\n\nBut default meanings do not exhaust the category membership of the\nimpliciture: implicitures can be a result of default reasoning as well\nas a context-dependent process of inference. Analogous to the\ndistinctions discussed before, default meanings are orthogonal to the\ndistinction between what is said, impliciture, and implicature: the\ndefault/inferential distinction cuts across all three.\n",
