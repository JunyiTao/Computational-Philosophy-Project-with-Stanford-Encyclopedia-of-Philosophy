    "main_text": "Life and Works || Family, Teachers, and Pupils; Date\n1.1 Family, Teachers, and Pupils; Date\n\nArchytas, son of Hestiaeus (see Aristoxenus in Diels-Kranz 1952, chap.\n47, passage A1; abbreviated as DK47 A1), lived in the Greek city of\nTarentum, on the heel of the boot of Italy. The later tradition almost\nuniversally identifies him as a Pythagorean (e.g., A1, A2, A7, A16).\nAristotle and his pupil Eudemus do not explicitly call Archytas a\nPythagorean and appear to treat him as an important independent\nthinker. Plato never refers to Archytas by name except in the\nSeventh Letter, if that is by Plato, and he is not called a\nPythagorean there. In the Republic, however, when Plato\nquotes a sentence which appears in Fr. 1 of Archytas (DK47 B1), he\nexplicitly labels it as part of Pythagorean harmonics (530d). Cicero\n(de Orat. III 34. 139) reports that Archytas was the pupil of\nPhilolaus, and this is not improbable. Philolaus was the most\nprominent Pythagorean of the preceding generation (ca. 470\u2013390)\nand may have taught in Tarentum. Archytas\u2019 achievements in\nmathematics depend on the work of Hippocrates of Chios, but we have no\nevidence that he studied with Hippocrates. The only pupil of Archytas\nwho is more than a name, is Eudoxus (ca. 390\u2013340), the prominent\nmathematician. Eudoxus presumably did not learn his famous hedonism\nfrom Archytas (see DK47 A9), and it is specifically geometry that he\nis said to have studied with Archytas (Diogenes Laertius VIII 86).\n\nArchytas was, roughly speaking, a contemporary of Plato, but it is\ndifficult to be more precise about his dates. Aristotle\u2019s pupil,\nEudemus, presents him as the contemporary of Plato (born 428/7) and\nLeodamas (born ca. 430), on the one hand, and of Theaetetus (born ca.\n415), on the other (A6). Since it would be difficult to call him the\ncontemporary of Theaetetus, if he were born much earlier than 435,\nthis is the earliest he was likely to have been born. On the other\nhand, he could have been born as late as 410 and still be considered a\ncontemporary of Plato. Strabo associates Archytas with the flourishing\nof Tarentum, before a period of decline, in which Tarentum hired\nmercenary generals (A4). Since the mercenaries appear ca. 340, it\nseems likely that Archytas was dead by 350 at the latest. Such a date\nis in accord with other evidence (A5 = [Demosthenes], Erot.\nOr. 61.46), which connects Archytas to Timotheus, who died ca.\n355, and with Plato\u2019s (?) Seventh Letter (350a), which\npresents Archytas as still active in Tarentum in 361. Thus Archytas\nwas born between 435 and 410 and died between 360 and 350.\n\nSome scholars (e.g., Ciaceri 1927\u201332: III 4) have supposed that\nthe speaker of the Roman poet, Horace\u2019s, Archytas Ode (I 28 =\nA3) is Archytas himself and hence have concluded that Archytas died in\na shipwreck. The standard interpretation, however, rightly recognizes\nthat the speaker is not Archytas but a shipwrecked sailor who\napostrophizes Archytas (Nisbet and Hubbard 1970, 317ff.). The ode\ntells us nothing about Archytas\u2019 death, but it is one of many\npieces of evidence for the fascination with Archytas by Roman authors\nof the first century BC (Propertius IV 1b.77; Varro in B8; Cicero,\nRep. I 38.59, I 10.16; Fin. V 29.87; Tusc.\nIV 36.78, V 23.64, de Orat. III 34.139; Amic. XXIII\n88; Sen. XII 39\u201341), perhaps because Pythagoreanism had\ncome to be seen as a native Italian philosophy, and not a Greek import\n(Burkert 1961; Powell 1995, 11 ff.).\n",
