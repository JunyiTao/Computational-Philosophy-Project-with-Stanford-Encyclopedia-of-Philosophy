For\na start, it is thought to reflect politically problematic dualistic\nthinking that undercuts feminist aims: the distinction is taken to\nreflect and replicate androcentric oppositions between (for instance)\nmind/body, culture/nature and reason/emotion that have been used to\njustify women\u2019s oppression (e.g. Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik 1999).\nThe thought is that in oppositions like these, one term is always\nsuperior to the other and that the devalued term is usually associated\nwith women (Lloyd 1993). For instance, human subjectivity and agency\nare identified with the mind but since women are usually identified\nwith their bodies, they are devalued as human subjects and agents. The\nopposition between mind and body is said to further map on to other\ndistinctions, like reason/emotion, culture/nature,\nrational/irrational, where one side of each distinction is devalued\n(one\u2019s bodily features are usually valued less that one\u2019s\nmind, rationality is usually valued more than irrationality) and women\nare associated with the devalued terms: they are thought to be closer\nto bodily features and nature than men, to be irrational, emotional\nand so on. This is said to be evident (for instance) in job\ninterviews. Men are treated as gender-neutral persons and not asked\nwhether they are planning to take time off to have a family. By\ncontrast, that women face such queries illustrates that they are\nassociated more closely than men with bodily features to do with\nprocreation (Prokhovnik 1999, 126). The opposition between mind and\nbody, then, is thought to map onto the opposition between men and\nwomen.\n\nNow, the mind/body dualism is also said to map onto the sex/gender\ndistinction (Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik 1999). The idea is that gender\nmaps onto mind, sex onto body. Although not used by those endorsing\nthis view, the basic idea can be summed by the slogan \u2018Gender is\nbetween the ears, sex is between the legs\u2019: the implication is\nthat, while sex is immutable, gender is something individuals have\ncontrol over \u2013 it is something we can alter and change through\nindividual choices. However, since women are said to be more closely\nassociated with biological features (and so, to map onto the body side\nof the mind/body distinction) and men are treated as gender-neutral\npersons (mapping onto the mind side), the implication is that\n\u201cman equals gender, which is associated with mind and choice,\nfreedom from body, autonomy, and with the public real; while woman\nequals sex, associated with the body, reproduction,\n\u2018natural\u2019 rhythms and the private realm\u201d (Prokhovnik\n1999, 103). This is said to render the sex/gender distinction\ninherently repressive and to drain it of any potential for\nemancipation: rather than facilitating gender role choice for women,\nit \u201cactually functions to reinforce their association with body,\nsex, and involuntary \u2018natural\u2019 rhythms\u201d (Prokhovnik\n1999, 103). Contrary to what feminists like Rubin argued, the\nsex/gender distinction cannot be used as a theoretical tool that\ndissociates conceptions of womanhood from biological and reproductive\nfeatures.\n\nMoi has further argued that the sex/gender distinction is useless\ngiven certain theoretical goals (1999, chapter 1). This is not to say\nthat it is utterly worthless; according to Moi, the sex/gender\ndistinction worked well to show that the historically prevalent\nbiological determinism was false. However, for her, the distinction\ndoes no useful work \u201cwhen it comes to producing a good theory of\nsubjectivity\u201d (1999, 6) and \u201ca concrete, historical\nunderstanding of what it means to be a woman (or a man) in a given\nsociety\u201d (1999, 4\u20135). That is, the 1960s distinction\nunderstood sex as fixed by biology without any cultural or historical\ndimensions. This understanding, however, ignores lived experiences and\nembodiment as aspects of womanhood (and manhood) by separating sex\nfrom gender and insisting that womanhood is to do with the latter.\nRather, embodiment must be included in one\u2019s theory that tries\nto figure out what it is to be a woman (or a man).\n\nMikkola (2011) argues that the sex/gender distinction, which underlies\nviews like Rubin\u2019s and MacKinnon\u2019s, has certain\nunintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments that render the\ndistinction politically unhelpful. First, claiming that gender is\nsocially constructed implies that the existence of women and men is a\nmind-dependent matter. This suggests that we can do away with women\nand men simply by altering some social practices, conventions or\nconditions on which gender depends (whatever those are). However,\nordinary social agents find this unintuitive given that (ordinarily)\nsex and gender are not distinguished. Second, claiming that gender is\na product of oppressive social forces suggests that doing away with\nwomen and men should be feminism\u2019s political goal. But this\nharbours ontologically undesirable commitments since many ordinary\nsocial agents view their gender to be a source of positive value. So,\nfeminism seems to want to do away with something that should not be\ndone away with, which is unlikely to motivate social agents to act in\nways that aim at gender justice. Given these problems, Mikkola argues\nthat feminists should give up the distinction on practical political\ngrounds.\n\nTomas Bogardus (2020) has argued in an even more radical sense against\nthe sex/gender distinction: as things stand, he holds, feminist\nphilosophers have merely assumed and asserted that the distinction\nexists, instead of having offered good arguments for the distinction.\nIn other words, feminist philosophers allegedly have yet to offer good\nreasons to think that \u2018woman\u2019 does not simply\npick out adult human females. Alex Byrne (2020) argues in a similar\nvein: the term \u2018woman\u2019 does not pick out a social kind as\nfeminist philosophers have \u201cassumed\u201d. Instead,\n\u201cwomen are adult human females\u2013nothing more, and nothing\nless\u201d (2020, 3801). Byrne offers six considerations to ground\nthis AHF (adult, human, female) conception.\n\nIt reproduces the dictionary definition of\n\u2018woman\u2019.\nOne would expect English to have a word that picks out the\ncategory adult human female, and \u2018woman\u2019 is the only\ncandidate.\nAHF explains how we sometimes know that an individual is a woman,\ndespite knowing nothing else relevant about her other than the fact\nthat she is an adult human female.\nAHF stands or falls with the analogous thesis for girls, which can\nbe supported independently.\nAHF predicts the correct verdict in cases of gender role\nreversal.\nAHF is supported by the fact that \u2018woman\u2019 and\n\u2018female\u2019 are often appropriately used as stylistic\nvariants of each other, even in\n hyperintensional\n contexts.\n\n\nRobin Dembroff (2021) responds to Byrne and highlights various\nproblems with Byrne\u2019s argument. First, framing: Byrne assumes\nfrom the start that gender terms like \u2018woman\u2019 have a\nsingle invariant meaning thereby failing to discuss the possibility of\nterms like \u2018woman\u2019 having multiple meanings \u2013\nsomething that is a familiar claim made by feminist theorists from\nvarious disciplines. Moreover, Byrne (according to Dembroff) assumes\nwithout argument that there is a single, universal category of woman\n\u2013 again, something that has been extensively discussed and\ncritiqued by feminist philosophers and theorists. Second,\nByrne\u2019s conception of the \u2018dominant\u2019\nmeaning of woman is said to be cherry-picked and it ignores a\nwealth of contexts outside of philosophy (like the media and the law)\nwhere \u2018woman\u2019 has a meaning other than AHF.\nThird, Byrne\u2019s own distinction between biological and social\ncategories fails to establish what he intended to establish: namely,\nthat \u2018woman\u2019 picks out a biological rather than a social\nkind. Hence, Dembroff holds, Byrne\u2019s case fails by its own\nlights. Byrne (2021) responds to Dembroff\u2019s critique.\n\nOthers such as \u2018gender critical feminists\u2019 also hold views\nabout the sex/gender distinction in a spirit similar to Bogardus and\nByrne. For example, Holly Lawford-Smith (2021) takes the prevalent\nsex/gender distinction, where \u2018female\u2019/\u2018male\u2019\nare used as sex terms and \u2018woman\u2019/\u2019man\u2019 as\ngender terms, not to be helpful. Instead, she takes all of these to be\nsex terms and holds that (the norms of) femininity/masculinity refer\nto gender normativity. Because much of the gender critical\nfeminists\u2019 discussion that philosophers have engaged in has\ntaken place in social media, public fora, and other sources outside\nacademic philosophy, this entry will not focus on these\ndiscussions.\n",
