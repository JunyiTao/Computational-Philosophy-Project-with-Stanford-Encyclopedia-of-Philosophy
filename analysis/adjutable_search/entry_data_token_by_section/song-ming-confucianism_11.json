Self-Cultivation\n\nFor many of the Confucians who wrote in the Song-Ming period, the most\nimportant test of a philosophical system was whether it could provide\nor justify a good account of self-cultivation. It was widely accepted\nthat most people were lacking in virtue. Debates about Pattern,\nqi, heartmind, and the foundations of ethics were often\ntreated as being important insofar as they had implications for how we\nought to improve ourselves (Ivanhoe 2016: 22\u201323).\n",
