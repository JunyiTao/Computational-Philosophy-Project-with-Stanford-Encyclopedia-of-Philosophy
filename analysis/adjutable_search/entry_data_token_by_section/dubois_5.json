    "main_text": "The Science of Human Action and Social Reform || Social Laws and Regularities\n3.1 Social Laws and Regularities\n\nIn an early statement (Du Bois, ca. 1897), Du Bois maintains that the\norganization of modern society is a function of social laws and\nregularities that sociology identifies through detailed, statistical\nresearch that \u201cgeneralizes[s]\u201d a \u201cmass of\nfacts,\u201d showing how various social phenomena, including, e.g.,\nthe \u201cdegree of poverty, the prevalence of suicide, [and] the\nextent and kinds of crime,\u201d tend \u201cto a certain rhythm and\nregularity which we call the social group\u201d (ca. 1897, 4).\nKnowledge of these social rhythms, regularities and, sometimes, laws\n(sociology studies \u201chuman action which by its regularity gives\nevidence of the presence of laws\u201d) is the \u201cfirst\nstep\u201d in modern social reform (ca. 1897, 3, 8). Such knowledge\ncan contribute to social reform, Du Bois\u2019s examples suggest, for\nit enables the reformer to explain causally the conditions she wishes\nto transform and rationally to chart plans to alter those conditions:\ne.g., the death rate of children in the slums, the treatment of\nprisoners, and pauperism (ca. 1897,\n 9\u201311).[28]\n Such knowledge, presumably, empowers Du Bois in his capacity as a\nsocial reformer to explain the existence of the Negro problem and\nrationally to identify means to eradicate the Negro problem (see 2.1\nabove and 4.1.1 below).\n",
