    "main_text": "Ancient Greek Atomism || Diodorus Cronus\n2.4 Diodorus Cronus\n\nDiodorus Cronus (late 4th c. BCE), a member of the supposed\nDialectical School, is reported to have offered new arguments that\nthere must be partless bodies or magnitudes. Most reports suggest that\nhis focus was on logical arguments rather than on physical theory: he\nused arguments that depend on positing mutually exhaustive\nalternatives.\n\nPerhaps drawing on an argument of Aristotle\u2019s (Sens. 7,\n449a20\u201331]), Diodorus apparently used the idea that there is a\nsmallest size at which an object at a given distance is visible as the\nbasis for an argument that there are indivisible magnitudes. His\nargument begins from the idea that there is a difference in size\nbetween the smallest size at which a given object is\nvisible\u2014presumably from a given distance\u2014and the largest\nsize at which it is invisible. Unless we concede that, at some\nmagnitude, a body is both invisible and visible (or neither), there\ncannot be any other magnitude intermediate between these two\nmagnitudes. Magnitudes must increase by discrete units.\n\nSextus Empiricus (AM 10.48ff) reports an argument of\nDiodorus\u2019 also concluding that magnitudes have discrete\nintervals. It also denies the existence of moving bodies, insisting\nthat bodies move neither when they are in the place where they are,\nnor when they are in the place where they are not. Since these\nalternatives are presented as exhaustive, the conclusion must be that\nbodies are never moving. However, rather than assert that everything\nis static, Diodorus took the view that bodies must have moved\nwithout ever being in motion: they are simply at one place at\none moment, and at another place at another moment.\n\nAs well as postulating the existence of indivisible smallest bodies\nand magnitudes, Diodorus seems to have supposed that there are\nindivisible smallest units of time. The argument about motion does not\nquite make it explicit that this is what he is committed to, but it is\na reasonable inference: given his insistence that bodies are always at\none place or another at any given time, he might well suppose that\ninfinite divisibility of time would open up the threatening\npossibility of indeterminacy as to whether the change of place has\ntaken place.\n\nFor those who posit indivisibles as a way to escape paradoxes about\ninfinite divisibility, parallel arguments might equally well have been\napplied to the problem of completing tasks in an infinitely divisible\ntime. Sextus Empiricus reports that the Aristotelian Strato of\nLampsacus (d. 268/70 BCE) argued for time atoms, although this is\ncontradicted by other sources. Sorabji (1983) suggests that Strato\nmerely countenanced the possibility that time could be\ndiscrete while space and motion are continuous, without endorsing this\nposition.\n",
