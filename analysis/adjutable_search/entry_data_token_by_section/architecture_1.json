    "main_text": "Introduction || A Word on Terminology\n1.2 A Word on Terminology\n This essay refers generally to the basic creative output of\narchitects, in any (unspecified) form, as \u201carchitectural\nobjects\u201d. This is in parallel with the term \u201cart\nobjects\u201d in use, across aesthetics and philosophy of art, to\nrefer to objects created by artists independent of the artform and\nwithout regard to ontological or other discussions where other terms\nmay evoke one or another particular stance. It may turn out that\n\u201carchitectural object\u201d proves value-laden. Yet this is\nless likely than with common alternatives in the literature:\n\u201carchitectural works\u201d, perhaps wedded to creator intent,\nstatus as extant or integral whole, or aesthetic ranking; or\n\u201cbuildings\u201d, certainly wedded to built, hence concrete,\nstructures.  \u201cBuilt structures\u201d is used here (except in\nhistorical reference) to refer to the generic built output resulting\nfrom architectural design, in recognition of a domain some view as\nbroader than buildings per se.\n",
