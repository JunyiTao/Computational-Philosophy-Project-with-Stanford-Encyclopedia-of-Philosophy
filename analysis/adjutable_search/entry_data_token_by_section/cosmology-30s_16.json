In his scathing\nNature review of Milne\u2019s book, he rejects Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deductivism, his cosmological principle, and, above all,\nhis operationalism: \u201cWhen I visit the Cavendish Laboratory, I do\nnot find its occupants engaged in flashing light-signals at each\nother, but I find practically everyone employing rigid scales or their\nequivalent\u201d (Eddington 1935, p. 636). Whittaker\u2019s review\nwas not so negative as Eddington\u2019s (Whittaker 1935). While the\nsenior physicist rejects Milne\u2019s operationalism and attacks upon\nthe geometrical commitments of relativistic proponents, he is\nconsiderably more forgiving about Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deductivism, and even goes so far as to remark\nMilne\u2019s \u201cbrilliant record in astrophysical\ndiscovery.\u201d Nonetheless, Milne\u2019s break with a tradition\nincluding at least \u201cEinstein, de Sitter, Friedmann,\nLeMa\u00eetre, Weyl, Eddington, H.P. Robertson and others\u201d is\nto be regretted (Whittaker 1935 p. 179). Perhaps, along with\nEddington, Whittaker hopes that soon \u201cProfessor Milne will\nreturn to orthodoxy\u201d (Eddington 1935, p. 636).\n\nBut Whittaker\u2019s view on Milne must be put into the perspective\nhe held on the whole ongoing debate. As he saw it\n\n\u2026a lively debate is in progress at the present moment between\nSir Arthur Eddington and Dr Harold Jeffreys of Cambridge, Professor\nMilne of Oxford, Sir James Jeans, and Professor Dingle of the Imperial\nCollege, the subject being the respective shares of reason and\nobservation in the discovery of the laws of nature. (Whittaker 1941,\np. 160)\n\n\nBut lively debate is far too gentlemanly a description for what now\noccurred. After holding his ire somewhat in check for\u2014as he saw\nit\u2014already far too long, Dingle finally erupted.\n",
