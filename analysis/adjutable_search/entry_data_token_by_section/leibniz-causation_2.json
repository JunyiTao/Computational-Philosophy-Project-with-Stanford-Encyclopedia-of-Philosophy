Why does Leibniz reject Occasionalism?\n\nOccasionalism puts forward a view where God must act for any substance\nthat does not have the causal power itself to act. But since no other\nsubstance besides God has the causal power to act for itself, or even\nin conjunction with other finite substances, God must continually\nintervene in the course of the world. Leibniz sees this as a serious\nproblem for the occasionalist account of causation.\n\nSince occasionalism entails that God must continually intervene in the\ncourse of nature, Leibniz takes this to mean that he must perform\ncontinuous miracles\u2014an occupation not entirely worthy of\nGod\u2019s name. He explains:\n\nLet us see, however, whether the system of occasional causes really\ndoesn\u2019t involve a perpetual miracle. [Pierre Bayle] said that it\ndoes not, because the system holds that God acts only according to\ngeneral laws. I agree that he does, but in my view that isn\u2019t\nenough to remove miracles. Even if God produced them all the time,\nthey would still be miracles, if the word in understood not in the\npopular sense, as a rare and marvelous thing, but philosophically, as\nsomething which exceeds the power of created things. It isn\u2019t\nsufficient to say that God has made a general law, for in addition to\nthe decree there has also to be a natural way of carrying it out. It\nis necessary, that is, that what happens should be explicable in terms\nof the God-given nature of things. (Explanation of Bayle\u2019s\nDifficulties \u00a77 GP iv, 520/WF 205)\n\n\nNote Leibniz\u2019s definition of a miracle as simply an event that\nresults from God and not from finite substances. However, Leibniz\nadds, a world in which God is required to perform continuous miracles\nis a world less perfect, and thereby less praiseworthy, than a world\nthat \u201cunfolds\u201d naturally without the direct intervention\nof God (Theodicy \u00a716). The idea is that the doctrine of\noccasionalism must hold that God did not initially get creation right\n(even if the occasionalist themselves is not willing to make such an\nassertion) and so must continually step in and repair things to get\nthem to go the way God intends. (This is, of course, not to say that\nfor Leibniz there are no miracles whatsoever. He does speak of events\nthat \u201csurpass all the force of creatures\u201d\n(Theodicy \u00a7249 H 280), including the Creation and the\nIncarnation.) Some have called Hendrix\u2019s guitar playing\n\u201cmiraculous,\u201d but this is not because his playing was due only to God.\nHendrix was a real cause. \n\nFor Leibniz, a world of genuinely active substances is more perfect\nthan a world of purely passive or causally inert substances, whose\nactivity is not properly ascribed to them but to God. Ascribing such\nactivity to God alone, Leibniz believes, leads inexorably to\nSpinozism, where God is the only real substance and where any other\nthing is just a mode of God or else must invoke a deus ex machina,\nwhich for Leibniz is an ad hoc solution (Primary Truths C\n521/P 90; GP iv, 515/WF 221). In order to avoid what he thinks is\nunadulterated Spinozism, Leibniz is keen to emphasize that we must be\nable to distinguish the actions of God from the actions of created\nsubstances. (The success of this endeavor of Leibniz\u2019s is\ndebatable, as discussed in the section on divine causation.)\n\nInterestingly, Leibniz also offers a methodological reason for\nrejecting any view that unnecessarily invokes miracles to explain\nphenomena: \u201cIn philosophy we must try to show the way in which things\nare carried out by the divine wisdom by explaining them in accordance\nwith the notion of the subject we are dealing with\u201d (New\nSystem \u00a713 WF 150). \n",
