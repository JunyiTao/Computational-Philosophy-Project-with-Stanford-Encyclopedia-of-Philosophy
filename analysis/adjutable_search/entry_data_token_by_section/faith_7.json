Venturing faith, without belief\n\nSome accounts allow that faith centrally involves practical commitment\nventuring beyond evidential support, yet do not require (or, even,\npermit) that the venturer actually believes the\nfaith-proposition assumed to be true. Such accounts may be described\nas proposing a \u2018non-doxastic\u2019 venture model of faith. F.\nR. Tennant holds a view of this kind: he takes faith to be the\nadoption of a line of conduct not warranted by present facts, that\ninvolves experimenting with the possible or ideal, venturing into the\nunknown and taking the risk of disappointment and defeat. Faith is not\nan attempt to will something into existence but rather treating hoped\nfor and unseen things as if they were real and then acting\naccordingly (Tennant 1943 [1989, 104]). Swinburne refers to this as\nthe \u2018pragmatist\u2019 model of faith (Swinburne 2005,\n147\u20138; Swinburne 2001, 211; compare also Golding 1990, 2003 and\nMcKaughan 2016). The origins of Swinburne\u2019s pragmatist model are\nto be found in a much earlier paper, Swinburne 1969.\n\nWilliam Alston (1996) suggests that faith may involve an active\n\u2018acceptance\u2019 rather than purely receptive belief. A\nclearly non-doxastic venture model results if acceptance is understood\non Jonathan Cohen\u2019s account under which to accept that\np is \u2018to have or adopt a policy of deeming, positing,\nor postulating that p\u2014i.e. of including that\nproposition \u2026 among one\u2019s premisses for deciding what to\ndo or think in a particular context, whether or not one feels it\nto be true that p\u2019 (Cohen 1992, 4, our emphasis). The\nfirmness of faith-commitment is then just the firmness of one\u2019s\n\u2018resolve to use [faith-claims] as a basis for\none\u2019s thought, attitude and behaviour\u2019 (Alston 1996, 17):\nthere is no firm assurance of their truth. Decisive\ncommitment in the absence of such assurance may nevertheless be\npossible, motivated (as Swinburne suggested in the first edition of\nhis Faith and Reason) by the evaluative belief that\n\u2018unless [faith-propositions are true], that which is most\nworthwhile is not to be had\u2019 (Swinburne, 1981, 117). A faith\nventure that lacks belief in the faith-proposition to which commitment\nis made need not, and probably could not, lack cognitive components\naltogether, as this suggestion of Swinburne\u2019s indicates.\n\nAndrei Buckareff (2005) and J. L. Schellenberg (2005, 138\u20139)\npropose non-doxastic (or, \u2018sub-doxastic\u2019) venture models\nof propositional faith, with Schellenberg emphasising the positive\nevaluation that persons of faith make of the truth-claim to which they\ncommit themselves. In response to Daniel Howard-Snyder (2013a)\nSchellenberg allows that faith may in some instances involve belief\nwhile still maintaining that \u2018non-doxastic religious faith\n\u2026 will turn out to be a particularly important way of having\nreligious faith as we head into the future\u2019 (2013, 262). Bishop\n(2005), in response to Buckareff, also agrees that authentic faith\nneed not always be a specifically doxastic venture. There may, then,\nbe an emerging consensus amongst proponents of venture models that\nfaith, at its core, consists in suitably motivated persistent\npractical commitment \u2018beyond the evidence\u2019 to the\npositively evaluated truth of foundational faith-claims which may, but\nneed not, actually be believed to be true.\n\nRobert Audi (2011) has also defended a non-doxastic account of faith,\ncontrasting \u2018fiducial faith\u2019 and \u2018doxastic\nfaith\u2019, and arguing that authentic religious faith need only\namount to the former. Audi\u2019s account is not strictly a\n\u2018venture\u2019 model, however, since he does not take\ncommitment beyond the support of adequate evidence to be essential.\nAudi\u2019s account suggests that religious faith is sui\ngeneris, but capable of being understood through its relations\nwith other psychological states and actions, such as beliefs,\nevaluations and practical commitments. Rational assessment of\nreligious faith, Audi thinks, must avoid treating it as implying\nbelief, while recognising that greater confidence attaches to it than\nto religious hope. For another version of a non-doxastic account of\nfaith, as a person\u2019s \u2018affective orientation or\nstance\u2019, see Jonathan Kvanvig (2013, 2018). The question whether\nfaith entails belief (even if it may not consist purely in beliefs)\nremains a lively focus of debate. For defence of the view that faith\nentails belief, see Malcolm and Scott 2016 and Mugg 2021; for\ncriticism see Howard-Snyder 2019.\n",
