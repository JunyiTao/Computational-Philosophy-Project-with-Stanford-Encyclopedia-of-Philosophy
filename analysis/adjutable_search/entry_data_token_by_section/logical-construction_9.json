    "main_text": "From Logical Constructions to Measurement Theory\n10. From Logical Constructions to Measurement Theory\n\nAt just this time, Norman R. Campbell (1920) introduced the ideas of\nwhat is known as Measurement Theory which can be seen as an\nalternative to the logical construction of physical quantities.\nCampbell proposed the  direct measurement of length, for\nexample, by correlating objects with numbers in a scale, say meters,\nthrough performing a number of operations of laying down meter sticks\nuntil the combination is longer than the given object.\nCampbell\u2019s  direct measurement of weight can be\nperformed by placing the measured object on one pan of a balance\nscale, and adding unit weights, say of one gram each, in the other pan\nuntil the pan no longer tilts to the side of the weighed object. In\neach case there is an operation (concatenating measuring rods or\nadding weights to a pan) and a relation (of overlapping with length or\ntipping the scale with weight). \n\nThe logical construction of an extended object in Russell\u2019s\napproach specifies a class of sensibilia that occupy a given region of\nspace. Measurement would thus attribute a quality to that class.\nCampbell\u2019s account of direct measurement, however, is completely\nnon-committal about the nature of the object of measurement, and\nsimply describes the operations and relations that allow one to assign\nnumbers to the values.\n\nIn his summary of Wiener (1921), Henry Kyburg notes that\nWiener\u2019s suggested treatment of measurement did not change the\ndirection of the theory, that is, away from the notion of measurement\nas the assignment of numbers to physical entities in the manner of\nCampbell (1920). Kyburg\u2019s assessment is at Wiener (1976, 86).\nCampbell\u2019s lengthy 1920 book in which he presents his theory of\nmeasurement does not include any references to previous writers, but\ndoes dedicate the book to Russell and with a qualification: \u201cBut\nfor the general train of thought which inspires the whole I can make\nacknowledgement to my masters, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Mr Bertrand\nRussell; but I fear that the latter (at any rate) will think his pupil\nanything but a credit to him.\u201d (Campbell 1920, vii)\n",
