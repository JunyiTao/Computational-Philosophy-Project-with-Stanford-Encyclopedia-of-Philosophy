    "main_text": "Mind and Language\n2. Mind and Language\n\nAt an abstract level, The Elements of Law, the Elements\nof Philosophy, and Leviathan all share a structure.\nHobbes begins with questions about mind and language, and works\ntowards questions in political philosophy. How exactly the parts of\nthe system are connected has long been debated. But Hobbes thinks at\nleast that we will better understand how individuals interact in\ngroups if we understand how individuals work. Thus the first part of\nThe Elements of Law is titled \u201cHuman Nature\u201d and\nthe second \u201cDe Corpore Politico\u201d (i.e., \u201cAbout the\nBody Politic\u201d). Hobbes did not insist it was necessary to work\nthrough all the issues about individuals before tackling the issues\nabout groups, as he acknowledged when he published the third part of\nthe Elements of Philosophy (De Cive) first. But he\ndid think it helpful. Thus even in Leviathan, with its focus\non political and religious matters, Hobbes starts with a story about\nthe workings of the mind. The first six chapters work through issues\nabout the senses, imagination, language, reason, knowledge, and the\npassions.\n",
