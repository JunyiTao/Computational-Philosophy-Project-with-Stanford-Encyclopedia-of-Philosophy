    "main_text": "\n\nRobert Nozick (1938\u20132002) was a renowned American philosopher\nwho first came to be widely known through his 1974 book, Anarchy,\nState, and Utopia\n (1974),[1]\n which won the National Book Award for Philosophy and Religion in\n1975. Pressing further the anti-consequentialist aspects of John\nRawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice, Nozick argued that respect\nfor individual rights is the key standard for assessing state action\nand, hence, that the only legitimate state is a minimal state that\nrestricts its activities to the protection of the rights of life,\nliberty, property, and contract. Despite his highly acclaimed work in\nmany other fields of philosophy, Nozick remained best known for the\nlibertarian doctrine advanced in Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia.\n",
