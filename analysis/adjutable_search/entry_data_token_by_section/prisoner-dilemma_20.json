    "main_text": "Zero-Determinant Strategies\n21. Group Selection and the Haystack PD\n\nA third mechanism by which players can be made more likely to meet\nthose like themselves is to consider a more sophisticated dynamics of\nevolution that operates on groups of players as well as on the\nindividuals within those groups. There has been a heated debate among\nbiologists and philosophers of biology about the appropriate\n\u201cunits of selection\u201d on which natural selection operates.\nThe idea that in many cases it makes sense to take these units to be\ngroups of individuals (instead of, or in addition to, genes or\nindividuals) has recently been resuscitated as a respectable and\nplausible viewpoint. (See Sober and Wilson or Wilson and Sober for a\nhistory and impassioned defense of this resuscitation.) For cultural\nevolution, the idea is equally plausible\u2014within-group behavior\nmay be in equilibrium, but the equilibria reached by different groups\nmay be different. Less successful groups may imitate, be replaced by,\nor lose members to, more successful groups. Sober and Wilson sometimes\nwrite as if evolutionary game theory is an alternative\nviewpoint to group selection, but it is important to understand that\nthis is only true of simple evolutionary models like those presented\nabove. More sophisticated evolutionary games are possible. Consider,\nfor example, a simple version of the haystack model\noriginally described by John Maynard Smith. Pairs of players from a\nlarge population pair randomly. Each pair colonizes a single haystack.\nThe pair plays a prisoners dilemma and the payoffs to an individual\ndetermine the number of offspring of that individual in the next\ngeneration. (Parents die when the children are born.) For some fixed\nnumber of generations, members of the colony pair randomly with other\nmembers and play the PD. Then the haystacks are torn down, the\npopulation mixes and random pairs colonize next season's haystacks.\nOne simple way to represent the \\(n\\)-generation haystack PD,\nas we might call it, is to view it as a game between the two initial\nfounders of a haystack with the payoff to a founder being set to the\nnumber of living descendants who are using his strategy. (This idea is\nsuggested in Bergstrom and reported in Skyrms 2004.) For example,\nsuppose \\(n=3\\) and the temptation, reward, punishment and sucker\npayoffs are set to 5, 3, 1, 0. Then, if Player One cooperates and\nplayer Two defects, the payoff to Player One will be 0, because a\ncooperator gets 0 offspring in the second, and any subsequent,\ngeneration. The payoff to player Two will be 5 because the defector\nhas five (like-minded) offspring among the second generation and each\nof these has one in the third generation since there are no\ncooperators left to meet. The full payoff matrix for the four\ngeneration haystack PD with payoffs 3,2,1, and 0 is given by the\nmatrix below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(8,8\\)\n\\(0,3\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(3,0\\)\n\\(1,1\\)  \n\n\nAs Skyrms 2004 notes, this matrix characterizes an ordinary stag hunt\ngame, as defined above. In fact, Skyrms' observation is generally\ntrue. For any PD game \\(g\\), if \\(n\\) is sufficiently large, the\n\\(n\\)-generation haystack version of \\(g\\) is a stag hunt. A simple\nargument for this result is given in the following very short\nsupplementary document:\n\nHaystack PDs Become Stag Hunts.\n \n",
