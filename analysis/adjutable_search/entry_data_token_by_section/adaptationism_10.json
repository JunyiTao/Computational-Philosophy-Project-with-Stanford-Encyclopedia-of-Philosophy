Are constraint hypotheses genuine rivals to adaptive hypotheses?\n\n\n One issue in the debate over\nadaptationism and optimality models concerns whether constraint\nhypotheses count as genuine alternatives to adaptive hypotheses.\nGould and Lewontin (1979) view constraint hypotheses as competing with\nadaptive hypotheses as explanations of traits. Advocates of optimality\nmodels (e.g., Maynard Smith 1978, Roughgarden 1998) take the set of\nevolutionary constraints to be a background commitment of any\noptimality model. The constraint set may include developmental\nand genetic constraints on variation and transmission, but it is\nnatural selection that drives evolution and so explains the trait given\nthose constraints. Advocates of optimality models treat\nconstraints as presupposed by adaptive hypotheses. A concern of\nmany critics of adaptationism is that this treatment of constraints\nundervalues their role in explaining evolutionary form and novelty.\n\n\n Developmental processes may limit the spectrum of evolutionary\ntrajectories available to a lineage.  Maynard Smith et\nal. (1985, page 266) defined a developmental constraint as\n\u201ca bias on the production of variant phenotypes or a limitation\non phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character,\ncomposition, or dynamics of the developmental system.\u201d More\nrecently, the definition of constraint has become more nuanced (see,\ne.g., Wagner and Altenberg 1996, Winther 2001).\n\n\n Part of the controversy over\nconstraints can be resolved by distinguishing between \u201cconstraint\non adaptation\u201d and \u201cconstraint on form\u201d (Amundson\n1994). In the former, certain trajectories are less likely\nbecause they require populations to leave local optima or\n\u201cpeaks\u201d in the adaptive landscape. In this case,\nnatural selection limits the potential evolutionary trajectories.\nIn the latter case, certain trajectories are unavailable due to the\nstructure of the current developmental system.\n\n\n Advocates of optimality models often argue\nthat building and testing such models provides the best way to identify\nand discover evolutionary constraints, and that these constraints can\nthen be used to build better optimality models (Amundson 1994, Seger\nand Stubblefield 1996). Many biologists that analyze the\nevolution of development or \u201cevo-devo\u201d use a different set\nof molecular and morphological investigative techniques to uncover\nrobust and important developmental constraints (see, e.g., M\u00fcller\nand Newman 2003, Kirschner and Gerhart 2005). They object that\nthe concept of optimality is a poor tool for answering their research\nquestions. The recognition of two kinds of constraints resolves\nthis dispute. We see then that optimality modeling usually\nentails the incorporation of or the discovery of constraints on\nadaptation, whereas studies of evolution and development investigates\nconstraints on form. A full understanding of evolutionary history\nrequires a synthesis of these approaches.\n\n\n Developmental and genetic constraint\nhypotheses do not invoke causal processes in the same way that adaptive\nhypotheses do. Can such different hypotheses compete with one another?\nThis aspect of the adaptationism debate connects biology to an\nimportant puzzle about the nature of causation and explanation.\nIf explanation amounts to identifying causes, then constraints must be\ncauses to explain evolutionary outcomes. But how can impediments\nhave a causal influence on the evolutionary trajectory of a\nlineage? One possible answer is that they don't have any\ncausal influence\u2014they are merely the background against which\nnatural selection operates. Such a view treats causes as part of\na process, or involving some kind of energy transfer (Dowe 2008).\nThis view of causation vindicates the adaptationist view that the\nconstraint set is presupposed by any respectable adaptive\nhypothesis. For adaptationists, new constraints simply mean that\nwe need to build new models. Testing is then just a matter of\ncomparing different adaptive hypotheses that have different\nconstraints. The other possible answer is that constraints\ndo have a causal influence on evolution because they prevent\nevolutionary trajectories from attaining some outcomes. This view\nis consistent with counterfactual and interventionist approaches to\ncausation, such as the comprehensive one defended by Woodward (2003),\nand vindicates the approach of treating constraints as genuine\nalternatives to adaptive hypotheses.\n\n\n Linking this debate to\nphilosophical ideas about causation can help us evaluate whether\nevolutionary constraints count as genuine alternatives.\nConstraints are defined as biases or limitations on the\nproduction of variation. From the perspective of causation, this\nis a heterogeneous combination. Constraints that bias a lineage\ntowards certain evolutionary trajectories look like productive\nprobabilistic causes, and avoid certain conceptual entanglements that\nface boundaries or limitations. Innovations in the developmental makeup\nof an organism can make new changes and subsequent evolutionary\ntrajectories more likely, a hallmark of a causal factor. This helps\nclarify the importance of evolutionary innovation. Innovations that\nproduce biases may be crucial to explaining major evolutionary\ntransitions, such as the emergence of multicellularity (Sterelny 2008).\nWhen certain changes make new evolutionary outcomes more likely\nthey are part of the explanation of those new outcomes. Such\nbiases count as probabilistic causal influences since they change the\nprobability of a lineage taking certain evolutionary trajectories\n(Hitchcock 2008).\n\n\n Whether boundaries count as causes, and\nthereby explain evolutionary outcomes, is more problematic. A\nprevailing view within evolutionary biology is that constraints must\ncount as causal influences, whatever our account of causation (whether\nit be by prevention or by omission, see Woodward 2003 for discussion).\nGould and Lewontin (1979) adopted this position. Sansom (2003) argued\nthat the debate over the evolutionary importance of constraint amounts\nto an issue about the relative causal contributions of constraint and\nnatural selection to evolutionary outcomes. The causal\ncontribution of constraint can be assessed by using comparative data in\norder to compare evolutionary outcomes of lineages with and without the\nconstraint of interest. If there is a difference, then the\nconstraint has an identifiable causal influence, all other things being\nequal. Pigliucci and Kaplan (2000, 2006) proposed a test protocol\nbased on transition matrices in which probabilities of evolutionary\nchange are specified under natural selection and under one or more\ncompeting constraint hypotheses, so as to test natural selection\nagainst constraint. More philosophical analysis is required to assess\nthe viability of this approach.\n\n\n Whatever the position on whether\nconstraints count as causes, the lesson to be taken from this part of\nthe adaptationism debate is that it is essential to precisely specify\nthe rival evolutionary hypotheses. There are many examples of such\nprecise specification in the biological literature. For example, Frank\n(1985) and Stubblefield and Seger (1990) analyzed the influence on sex\nratio optima of different constraints on the information available to\nparents; Lloyd (2005) described the evidentiary support for\nexplanations of the evolution of the female orgasm. Lloyd's\nanalysis supports Symons' (1979) proposal that the female orgasm\nexists because of a developmental constraint in combination with strong\nselection for the male orgasm. If males fail to achieve orgasm\nthen no reproduction occurs. The tissue responsible for the male\norgasm appears early in human development, long before sexual\ndimorphism occurs, and this tissue is found in both male and female\nsexual organs. This example contains competing hypotheses that have\ncommitments about boundaries and about natural selection. The\nSymons constraint explanation invokes a feature of development and\nindirect selection on a different trait, whereas the adaptive\nhypothesis does not incorporate the developmental constraint and\ninstead, posits a direct role for selection.\n\n\n There is room for reconciliation\nhere. As adaptationists point out, any evolutionary hypothesis\nmust assume some constraints, so the accusation that optimality models\nfail to include constraints is incorrect. But pluralists are\nright to argue that in some cases constraints may play a significant\nrole in the evolution of some trait, and that the correct evolutionary\nexplanation may not even include natural selection for the trait.\n\n\n Constraints are often understood as\nbiases or limitations on potential evolutionary trajectories. How do we\nidentify potential trajectories? This will depend on how biology\nprovides counterfactual information. We cannot appeal solely to\nrealized evolutionary history, since not all potential trajectories\nhave occurred. Evo-devo research on novelty provides one of the\nbest strategies for exploring potential evolutionary trajectories\n(Wagner 2000, 2001a,2001b, Muller and Wagner 2003, Calcott 2009).\nAs the causal mechanisms underlying development are better understood,\nwe will gain a better grasp on the nature of constraints and how they\nexplain evolutionary outcomes.\n",
