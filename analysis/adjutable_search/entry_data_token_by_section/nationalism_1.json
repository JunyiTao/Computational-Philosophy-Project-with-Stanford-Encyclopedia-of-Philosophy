    "main_text": "What is a Nation? || The Concept of a Nation\n1.2 The Concept of a Nation\n\nIn its general form, the issue of nationalism concerns the mapping\nbetween the ethno-cultural domain (featuring ethno-cultural groups or\n\u201cnations\u201d) and the domain of political organization. In\nbreaking down the issue, we have mentioned the importance of the\nattitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their\nnational identity. This point raises two sorts of questions. First,\nthe descriptive ones:\n\n(1a)\nWhat is a nation and what is national identity?\n (1b)\nWhat is it to belong to a nation?\n (1c)\nWhat is the nature of pro-national attitude?\n (1d)\nIs membership in a nation voluntary or involuntary?\n\n\nSecond, the normative ones:\n\n(1e)\nIs the attitude of caring about national identity always\nappropriate?\n (1f)\nHow much should one care?\n\n\nThis section discusses the descriptive questions, starting with\n (1a)\n and\n (1b);the\n normative questions are addressed in\n Section 3\n on the moral debate. If one wants to enjoin people to struggle for\ntheir national interests, one must have some idea about what a nation\nis and what it is to belong to a nation. So, in order to formulate and\nground their evaluations, claims, and directives for action,\npro-nationalist thinkers have expounded theories of ethnicity,\nculture, nation, and state. Their opponents have in turn challenged\nthese elaborations. Now, some presuppositions about ethnic groups and\nnations are essential for the nationalist, while others are\ntheoretical elaborations designed to support the essential ones. The\ndefinition and status of the social group that benefits from the\nnationalist program, variously called the \u201cnation\u201d,\n\u201cethno-nation\u201d, or \u201cethnic group\u201d, is\nessential. Since nationalism is particularly prominent with groups\nthat do not yet have a state, a definition of nation and nationalism\npurely in terms of belonging to a state is a non-starter.\n\nIndeed, purely \u201ccivic\u201d loyalties are often categorized\nseparately under the title \u201cpatriotism\u201d, which we already\nmentioned, or \u201cconstitutional\n patriotism\u201d.[4]\n This leaves two extreme options and a number of intermediates. The\nfirst extreme option has been put forward by a small but distinguished\nband of\n theorists.[5]\n According to their purely voluntaristic definition, a nation is any\ngroup of people aspiring to a common political state-like\norganization. If such a group of people succeeds in forming a state,\nthe loyalties of the group members become \u201ccivic\u201d (as\nopposed to \u201cethnic\u201d) in nature. At the other extreme, and\nmore typically, nationalist claims are focused upon the non-voluntary\ncommunity of common origin, language, tradition, and culture: the\nclassic ethno-nation is a community of origin and culture, including\nprominently a language and customs. The distinction is related\n(although not identical) to that drawn by older schools of social and\npolitical science between \u201ccivic\u201d and \u201cethnic\u201d\nnationalism, the former being allegedly Western European and the\nlatter more Central and Eastern European, originating in\n Germany.[6]\n Philosophical discussions centered on nationalism tend to concern the\nethnic-cultural variants only, and this habit will be followed here. A\ngroup aspiring to nationhood on this basis will be called an\n\u201cethno-nation\u201d to underscore its ethno-cultural rather\nthan purely civic underpinnings. For the ethno-(cultural) nationalist\nit is one\u2019s ethnic-cultural background that determines\none\u2019s membership in the community. One cannot choose to be a\nmember; instead, membership depends on the accident of origin and\nearly socialization. However, commonality of origin has become\nmythical for most contemporary candidate groups: ethnic groups have\nbeen mixing for millennia.\n\nSophisticated, liberal pro-nationalists therefore tend to stress\ncultural membership only and speak of \u201cnationality\u201d,\nomitting the \u201cethno-\u201d part (Miller 1992, 2000; Tamir\n1993,2013; Gans 2003). Michel Seymour\u2019s proposal of a\n\u201csocio-cultural definition\u201d adds a political dimension to\nthe purely cultural one: a nation is a cultural group, possibly but\nnot necessarily united by a common descent, endowed with civic ties\n(Seymour 2000). This is the kind of definition that would be accepted\nby most parties in the debate today. So defined, the nation is a\nsomewhat mixed category, both ethno-cultural and civic, but still\ncloser to the purely ethno-cultural than to the purely civic\nextreme.\n\nLet us now turn to the issue of the origin and\n\u201cauthenticity\u201d of ethno-cultural groups or ethno-nations.\nIn social and political science one usually distinguishes two kinds of\nviews, but there is a third group, combining element from both. The\nfirst are modernist views that see nationalism as born in modern\ntimes, together with\n nation-states.[7]\n In our times the view was pioneered by Ernst Gellner (see his\n 1983).[8]\n Other modernist choose similar starting points with century or two of\n variation.[9]\n The opposite view can be called, following Edward Shils (1957) \u201cprimordialist\u201d.\nAccording to it, actual ethno-cultural nations have either existed\n\u201csince time immemorial\u201d.\n\nThe third, quite plausible kind of view, distinct from both\nprimordialism-ethno-symbolism and modernism, has been initiated by W.\nConnor (1994).[10]\n A nation is a politicized and mobilized ethnic group rather than a\nstate. So, the origins of nationalism predate the modern state, and\nits emotional content remains up to our times (Conversi 2002: 270),\nbut the actual statist organization is, indeed, modern. However,\nnation-state is a nationalist dream and fiction, never really\nimplemented, due to the inescapable plurality of social groups. So\nmuch for the three dominant perspectives on the origin of\nnationalism.\n\nIndeed, the older authors\u2014from great thinkers like Herder and\nOtto Bauer to the propagandists who followed their\nfootsteps\u2014took great pains to ground normative claims upon firm\nontological realism about nations: nations are real, bona\nfide entities. However, the contemporary moral debate has tried\nto diminish the importance of the imagined/real divide. Prominent\ncontemporary philosophers have claimed that normative-evaluative\nnationalist claims are compatible with the \u201cimagined\u201d\nnature of a\n nation.[11]\n They point out that common imaginings can tie people together, and\nthat actual interaction resulting from togetherness can engender\nimportant moral obligations.\n\nLet us now turn to question\n (1c)\n about the nature of pro-national attitudes. The explanatory issue\nthat has interested political and social scientists concerns\nethno-nationalist sentiment, the paradigm case of a pro-national\nattitude. Is it as irrational, romantic, and indifferent to\nself-interest as it might seem on the surface? The issue has divided\nauthors who see nationalism as basically irrational and those who try\nto explain it as being in some sense rational. Authors who see it as\nirrational propose various explanations of why people assent to\nirrational views. Some say, critically, that nationalism is based on\n\u201cfalse consciousness\u201d. But where does such false\nconsciousness come from? The most simplistic view is that it is a\nresult of direct manipulation of \u201cmasses\u201d by\n\u201celites\u201d. On the opposite side, the famous critic of\nnationalism Elie Kedourie (1960) thinks this irrationality is\nspontaneous. A decade and a half ago Liah Greenfeld went as far as\nlinking nationalism to mental illness in her provocative 2005 article\n(see also her 2006 book). On the opposite side, Michael Walzer has\noffered a sympathetic account of nationalist passion in his 2002.\nAuthors relying upon the Marxist tradition offer various deeper\nexplanations. To mention one, the French structuralist \u00c9tienne\nBalibar sees it as a result of the \u201cproduction\u201d of\nideology effectuated by mechanisms which have nothing to do with\nspontaneous credulity of individuals, but with impersonal, structural\nsocial factors (Balibar & Wallerstein 1988\n [1991]).[12]\n\nSome authors claim that it is often rational for individuals to become\nnationalists (Hardin 1985). Can one rationally explain the extremes of\nethno-national conflict? Authors like Russell Hardin propose to do so\nin terms of a general view of when hostile behavior is rational: most\ntypically, if an individual has no reason to trust someone, it is\nreasonable for that individual to take precautions against the other.\nIf both sides take precautions, however, each will tend to see the\nother as increasingly inimical. It then becomes rational to start\ntreating the other as an enemy. Mere suspicion can thus lead by small,\nindividually rational steps to a situation of conflict. (Such negative\ndevelopment is often presented as a variant of the Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma; see the entry on\n prisoner\u2019s dilemma).\n It is relatively easy to spot the circumstances in which this general\npattern applies to national solidarities and conflicts (see also\nWimmer 2013).\n\nFinally, as for question\n (1d),\n the nation is typically seen as an essentially non-voluntary\ncommunity to which one belongs by birth and early nurture and such\nthat the belonging is enhanced and made more complete by one\u2019s\nadditional conscious endorsement. Not everyone agrees: liberal\nnationalists accept the idea of choice of one\u2019s national\nbelonging and of possibility for immigrants to become nationals by\nchoice and intentional acculturation.\n",
