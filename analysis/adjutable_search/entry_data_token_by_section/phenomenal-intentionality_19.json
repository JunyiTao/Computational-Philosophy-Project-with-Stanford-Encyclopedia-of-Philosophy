    "main_text": "Cognitive phenomenology || The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon\n5.3 The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon\n\nSome experiences with a cognitive character seem to make a fairly good\ncase for a minimal amount of proprietary phenomenology of thought. For\nexample, Goldman (1993a) invokes the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon to\nargue that thought has a proprietary phenomenology, an argument he\nattributes to Jackendoff (1987). \n\n\nWhen one tries to say something but can\u2019t think of the word, one\nis phenomenologically aware of having requisite conceptual structure,\nthat is, of having a determinate thought-content one seeks to\narticulate. What is missing is the phonological form: the sound of the\nsought-for word. The absence of this sensory quality, however, does\nnot imply that nothing (relevant) is in awareness. Entertaining the\nconceptual unit has a phenomenology, just not a sensory phenomenology.\n(Goldman 1993a: 24) \n\n\nThe tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon occurs when one cannot think of a\nword, so it involves the absence of verbal phenomenology\ncorresponding to that word. But instances of this phenomenon do\ninvolve some phenomenology. Goldman proposes that this\nphenomenology is non-sensory. \n\nLormand (1996) responds to this suggestion by providing an alternative\naccount of the relevant phenomenology on which it is sensory, which he\nalso takes to be supported by Jackendoff 1987. According to Lormand,\nthe relevant phenomenology involves a sensory phenomenal experience of\na void, which is akin to hearing silence, along with an experience of\neffort, whose phenomenology is also sensory. \n",
