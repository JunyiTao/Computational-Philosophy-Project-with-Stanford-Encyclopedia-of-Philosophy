Developmental change as the mechanism for evolution\n\nThe idea that evolution constitutes changing developmental\nrelationships is central for the field of evolutionary developmental\nbiology (evo-devo). The field describes itself as the science that\nstudies how alterations in development create the variations that\nnature can select (Raff & Kaufman 1983; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff\n1996). In other words, natural selection did not create variation;\ndevelopment creates variation. Development is the artist; natural\nselection is the curator (Gilbert 2006, 2019). Both have creative\nagency; but they are working at different levels. Although this view\nhad been expressed by scientists such as Thomas Huxley, Julian Huxley,\nConrad H. Waddington, and Richard B. Goldschmidt, it gained credence\nthrough more recent discoveries that explained how normal development\ncould occur. Chief among these discoveries was the explication of\ndevelopmental pathways that connected embryonic induction with gene\nexpression. Here, paracrine factors (proteins that influence the\nbehaviors or gene expression patterns of neighboring cells) secreted\nby one set of cells were received by receptors on the membranes of\nother cells. These receptors then activated proteins within the\ncytoplasm, which eventually activated or repressed proteins that entered\nthe nucleus to regulate transcription of particular genes.\n\nThe second major discovery that promoted evo-devo was the discovery of\nmodular enhancers. The above-mentioned transcription factors would\nbind to specific regions of DNA, called enhancers. Most genes have\nmultiple enhancers. Thus, a gene might have a \u2018limb\u2019\nenhancer that activates the expression of the gene in the limb, and an\n\u2018eye\u2019 enhancer that enables the expression of the gene in\nthe eye. Moreover, each enhancer usually binds several transcription\nfactors and could be activated in Boolean <and> or <or>\nfashion. Evolution could occur by creating or deleting enhancers,\nthereby enabling genes to be expressed differently in different\nspecies. King and Wilson (1975) and Jacob (1977) had speculated that\nevolution occurred by changes in gene regulation. This provided a\nmodel for such regulation, and some of the best examples are seen in\nthe divergence of humans from other apes (Geschwind & Konopka\n2012; Pollard et al. 2006). As Haraway (2008) noted, \u201crelationships are the smallest\npossible pattern for analysis\u201d, and the relation between\nenhancer and transcription factor may indicate the \u2018natural\nkinds\u2019 of the biological world (Gilbert & Bard 2014).\nMoreover, the entities defined by enhancer/transcription factor\ninteractions during development are often unexpected and do not mirror\nintuitive boundaries between entities in adults. Activation of genes\nto form the distal rib, for instance, is controlled by a different\nenhancer than that which activates genes in the proximal rib (Guenther\net al. 2008).\n\nThese differences in gene expression could be categorized into four\ncategories (Arthur 2004). One of these categories involves the\nplace of gene expression, where different populations of\ncells express a particular gene in different species. For instance,\nthe gremlin gene in the duck hindlimb webbing protects these\ncells from cell death, enabling webbed feet (Laufer et al, 1997;\nMerino et al. 1999). A second category involves changes in the\ntiming of gene expression, as in the continued expression of\nthe fgf8 gene at the tip of the dolphin forelimbs, thus\nenabling the extension of its flippers (Richardson &\nOelschl\u00e4ger 2002). A third category of change involves\nalterations in the magnitude of gene expression, as in the\ndifferences in Bmp4 gene expression that determine the width\nof finch beaks (Abzhanov et al. 2004). A fourth category focuses on\nthe alterations of the actual protein sequence of regulatory\nproteins, as in the changes of the Antennapedia gene in\ninsects, which restrict insects from forming more than six limbs\n(Galant and Carroll 2002).\n\nThe third discovery was the elucidation of gene regulatory networks\n(GRNs). A GRN is based on paracrine factors, signal transduction\ncascades, and transcription factors. While ignoring\npost-transcriptional gene regulation, this concept attempts to explain\nhow initial conditions (RNAs and proteins within the oocyte, position\nof the embryo within the uterus, etc.) could create the conditions\nwhereby cell types differ, even though their genomes are identical.\nSpearheaded by Eric Davidson (2001, 2006), this approach uses systems\ntheory concepts such as modularity and dissociability to explain how\nthe genes interact in a hierarchical manner to produce different\ncell types (Levine & Davidson 2005) and how the cell types in\nrelated species could differ by the recruitment (co-option) of a\nparticular GRN by altering transcription factor binding. More\ngenerally, the discovery of GRNs has enabled the integration of\ndevelopmental biology with paleontology (Jablonski 2017; Hinman et al.\n2003; Hinman & Cheatle Jarvela 2014) and may also be extended into\nareas of symbiosis and niche construction (Laubichler & Renn\n2015).\n\nA fourth discovery of evolutionary developmental biology was the\nimportance of developmental plasticity for evolution (Nijhout 1990;\nGilbert 2001; Pigliucci 2001). By the end of the 20th century, the\nroles of temperature, sunlight, diet, crowding, maternal behaviors,\nand predation were seen to have major roles in effecting phenotypes in\nplants and animals. Thus, the environment not only selected\nvariations, it helped produce them. Since evo-devo postulated that\nchanges in development cause evolution, and since developmental\nplasticity played a role in development, then it became necessary to\nlook at changes in plasticity as being part of evolution. In the early\nyears of the 21st century, developmental plasticity was seen to play\nroles in evolutionary change (West-Eberhard 2003; Abouheif et al.\n2014; Suzuki & Nijhout 2006; Rajakumar et al. 2018; Levis &\nPfennig 2020), and the notion of \u2018plasticity-first\nevolution\u2019 (or \u2018development-first evolution\u2019)\nintegrated data from numerous sources into a program where the\nphysiological ability to alter one\u2019s phenotype due to\nenvironmental agents could become canalized and genetically fixed by\nselection. The mechanisms by which such plasticity-first evolution was\neffected (unmasking and selection of cryptic genetic variants,\nstress-related inability of molecular chaperones to allow proper\nfolding of mutant proteins, etc.) became a new research program.\n\nA fifth discovery was the realization that one of the major\nenvironmental agents effecting development were symbiotic microbes\n(McFall-Ngai 2002; Gilbert et al. 2012, 2015). The notion of the\nholobiont (i.e. an integrated composite organism composed of microbial\nand host eukaryotic species) organized much of the data to look at the\nroles of microbes in causing both the normal development of the\norganism and variations of normal development (in disease and\nevolution) (Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg 2016; see entry\n biological individuals).\n For instance, in the mouse, the normal development of the immune\nsystem and the gut capillary network depends upon specific bacteria\nobtained during birth. These bacteria induce the expression of\nparticular genes in the eukaryotic cells, and the proteins made by\nthese genes influence cell fate (Hooper et al. 2001; McFall-Ngai et\nal. 2013). In other words, the bacteria can act as an embryonic cell\nwould, regulating gene expression in neighboring cells. Here, the\neukaryotic organism needs and expects these bacteria to be present for\nnormal development.\n\nAs in the other cases of developmental plasticity, the next step was\nto see if changes in developmental symbionts could produce changes in\nevolution (see O'Malley 2015). It was shown that changes in symbionts could provide\nselectable variants for evolution (Zhang et al. 2019), and it could\nprovide the basis for reproductive isolation through cytoplasmic\nincompatibility or mating preference (Brucker & Bordenstein 2013;\nSharon et al. 2010). One of the most interesting possibilities,\nthough, comes from the view that most, if not all, eukaryotic\norganisms are holobionts, and that symbionts open new evolutionary\ntrajectories. Symbiotic microbes, for instance, have long been known\nto be responsible for the plant-digesting enzymes in the stomachs of\nruminants. Without cellulose-digesting bacteria, cows cannot digest\ngrass or grain. Moreover, the microbes help create the rumen after\nthey colonize the digestive system at birth. Thus, these microbes also\ninduce the formation of the organ that houses them, and allows them to\nfunction (Gilbert 2020; Chiu & Gilbert 2020). Developmental\nsymbiosis (sympoiesis) thus has opened evolutionary trajectories for\ncertain mammals. This is an example of both developmental symbiosis\nand niche construction. Niche construction depends on developmental\nplasticity (Laland et al. 2008).\n\nThese five new (or renewed) aspects of developmental biology have\nseveral philosophical implications. Among others, they concern\nontological questions of what developing organisms are and how they\nshould be explained from an integrated perspective of developmental\nevolution.\n",
