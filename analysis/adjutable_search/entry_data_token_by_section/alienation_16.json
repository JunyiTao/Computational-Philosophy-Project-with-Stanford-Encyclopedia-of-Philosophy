    "main_text": "Some (Unresolved) Empirical Issues || Extent\n6.2 Extent\n\nA range of complex empirical and quasi-empirical issues also look to\nbe woven into Marx\u2019s views about the historical extent of\nalienation. Consider the various claims about the\nhistorical location and comparative intensity of alienation that can\nbe found in his writings (and in certain secondary\ninterpretations of those writings). These include: first, that\ncertain systematic forms of alienation\u2014including alienation in\nwork\u2014are not a universal feature of human society (not least,\nthey will not be a feature of a future communist order); second, that\nat least some systematic forms of alienation\u2014presumably\nincluding the alienation that Marx identifies as embodied in religious belief \u2014are widespread in pre-capitalist\nsocieties; and third, that systematic forms of alienation are greater\nin contemporary capitalist societies than in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. There seems no good textual or theoretical reason to\nlumber Marx with the view that less systematic forms of alienation\u2014such as the hypothetical estrangement of Gillian from her sister Hanna (which arose from sibling rivalry, stubbornness, and a chance misunderstanding at a time of family crisis)\u2014could never exist under communism.\n\nTake the last of these assorted empirical claims attributed to Marx \u2013 the comparative\nverdict about the extent or intensity of systematic forms of alienation in capitalist\nsocieties. Its plausibility is scarcely incontrovertible given the\namount of sheer productive drudgery, and worse, in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. Nor is it obvious how one might attempt to substantiate the\nempirical dimensions of the claim. The empirical difficulties of\nmeasuring subjective alienation look considerable enough (especially\ngiven the limitations of historical data), but alienation for Marx is\nfundamentally about the frustration of objective human potentials,\nthose separations that prevent self-realisation, perhaps especially\nself-realisation in work. One suggestion, made in this context, is\nthat the scale of alienation in a particular society might be\nindicated by the gap between the liberating potential of human\nproductive powers, on the one hand, and the extent to which that\npotential is reflected in the lives actually lived by producers, on\nthe other (Wood 2004: 44\u201348). Whatever the appeal of that\nsuggestion, the social scientific details of how one might actually\napply that kind of measure in particular historical cases remain\nunclear.\n",
