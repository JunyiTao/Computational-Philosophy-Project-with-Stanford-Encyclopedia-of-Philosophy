    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cWorld government\u201d refers to the idea of all humankind\nunited under one common political authority. Proposals for a unified\nglobal political authority have existed since ancient times\u2014in\nthe ambition of kings, popes and emperors, and the dreams of poets and\nphilosophers. Recently, some have argued that a world government is\nalready here, or nascent in contemporary conditions of capitalist\nglobalization. There is much debate about whether global institutional\ndevelopments towards a world state are inevitable or contingent,\nstable or subject to reversal, and whether unifying economic and\npolitical developments are to be desired or feared, justified or\nillegitimate, actively promoted or resisted.\n\nProponents of world government offer distinct reasons for why\nit is an ideal or necessary form of political organization. Some are\nmotivated negatively and see world government as functionally\nthe definitive solution to old and new human problems such as\nwar and the development of weapons of mass destruction, global poverty\nand inequality, global financial instability, infectious disease and\npandemics, and environmental degradation and climate change. More\npositively, some have advocated world government as a proper\nreflection of the unity of the cosmos, under reason or God, or as the\nteleological end-state of struggles for recognition or moral freedom\nor the perfection of humanity. Proponents have also differed\nhistorically in their views of the form of government that a\nworld state should take. While medieval thinkers advocated world\ngovernment under a single monarch or emperor who would possess supreme\nauthority over all other lesser rulers, modern proponents of world\ngovernment generally have not advocated a wholesale dismantling of the\nsovereign states system but incremental innovations in global\ninstitutional design to move humanity toward pacific world federalism\nor cosmopolitan democracy.\n\nCritics of world government come from a wide political spectrum, from\nradical and postcolonial to liberal to far right political adherents.\nCritics have offered three main kinds of objections\u2014to do with\nthe feasibility, desirability and necessity of establishing a common\nglobal political authority.\n\nThis entry will, first, outline the historical development of ideas of\nworld government, as well as objections to it, through a selective\ndiscussion of the idea\u2019s history in Western political thought.\nThe entry will focus on Dante\u2019s medieval treatise on the\nnecessity of a world monarch or emperor, and then consider mainly\narguments by Hobbes, Rousseau and Kant that reveal more skepticism\nabout world government as a solution to the problem of war and peace\namong sovereign states. The historical background section will\ncontinue with the revival of ideas of world government in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, prompted by imperial and colonial\nactivity, technological developments, economic globalization, and the\nexperience of two devastating world wars. While debates about world\ngovernment during the Cold War were pervaded by the ideological\ndivision of the world, the section concludes with a discussion of the\nacceleration of neoliberal globalization, following the end of the\nCold War, as well as resistance to it, on the prospects, promise, and\nperils of world state formation.\n\nSecond, the entry will explore debates in contemporary theory. One set\nof debates is located within international relations theory, between\nrealist and neorealist, \u201cinternational society\u201d, liberal\ninternationalist, republican, and constructivist schools, over the\npossibility and desirability of global structural transformation from\nanarchy to hierarchy. A second set of discussions about world\ngovernment is located within contemporary liberal theory, between John\nRawls and his cosmopolitan liberal critics, over the institutional\nimplications of liberal commitments to both normative individualism\nand the value of freedom as collective self-determination. A third set\nof debates among contemporary republican and democratic theorists\nrevolves around the question of whether a world state would fulfill or\ndestroy the conditions necessary to support republican nondomination\nand democratic justice. A related, fourth set of debates involve\ncritical and postcolonial theoretical critiques of the nascent global\nstate emerging from the ascendancy of neoliberalism and persistence of\npatriarchal and racial capitalism.\n\nThere is lively debate between scholars within and between these sets\nof discussions about the feasibility, desirability, and necessity of\nuniting humanity under a world government. In current conditions, it\nis apparent that persistent and pervasive structural inequalities at\nthe global level make health, security, prosperity, human rights,\nglobal justice, and environmental protection unevenly accessible, and\nseriously inaccessible, to a significant portion of the Earth\u2019s\ninhabitants. In the context of the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century, it is uncertain whether world government is a\npolitical institutional project that, even if effectively pursued,\nwould fulfill humanity\u2019s collective aspirations for a\nsustainable peace of justice and freedom, or whether it will\ndisappoint or haunt those who reach out for it.\n",
