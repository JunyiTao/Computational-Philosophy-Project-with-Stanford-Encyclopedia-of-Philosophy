    "main_text": "The phenomenological core of existentialist aesthetics\n2. The phenomenological core of existentialist aesthetics\n\n\nFor the 20th century existentialists, a decisive\nphilosophical inspiration was phenomenology, the philosophical method\ndevised by the German philosopher, Edmund Husserl, during the late\n19th and early 20th centuries, and which his\nfamous student, Martin Heidegger, developed into a combination of\nexistential analysis and deep ontology. Even Camus, who does not define\nhimself as a phenomenologist, and indeed sometimes rejects the tag of\n\u201cexistentialist\u201d (1945), appropriates the notion of\nintentionality, central to Husserl\u2019s phenomenology, in his most\nfamous work, The Myth of Sisyphus (Camus 1942b,\n44\u201350). It follows that existentialist aesthetics and the\nphenomenological approach to aesthetic perception and judgement\n(Ingarden 1962, 1965) are two closely related areas. Mikel Dufrenne\nsituates his work precisely at this intersection (see especially\nDufrenne 1973). However, the existentialists\u2019 approach to\nphenomenology is highly original, and has significant and distinctive\nimplications for aesthetics.\n\n\nWhat does intentionality mean, and why is it such a central notion\nin existentialist thinking about art? Husserl shows that when any type\nof meaning is articulated (in cognitive, moral, affective, aesthetic\nattitudes, etc.), a specific act of consciousness occurs. The\nspecificity of the meaning in question depends on the particular way in\nwhich consciousness \u201cintends\u201d its content in each case,\ni.e., the specific way in which it relates to a given (e.g., an object\nto know, judge, perceive, enjoy, and so on). In other words, different\ntypes of meaning depend on the specific structure of the acts of\nconsciousness that carry them; in particular, they depend on the\nspecific temporality of these mental acts. To give an example that made\nits way into some of the most famous existentialist literary works\n(e.g., in the famous descriptions in Nausea, Sartre\u2019s\nfirst novel): there is a specific temporality involved in perceiving an\nobject in space. The object is not given in an instant, and every\nperception points to a potential new perception which will confirm or\nrevise the previous ones. This temporality of perception implies\nrecourse to memory and a unification of past moments of perception.\nThis emphasis on the way human consciousness \u201cintends\u201d the\nworld in different ways accounts not just for the content of human\nknowledge, but also, more radically, for the relationship of the human\nbeing to reality. It is not just an epistemological but a metaphysical\nposition.\n\n\nThis approach to the basic problem of metaphysics is highly\nsignificant because it circumvents the dualisms of classical\nphilosophy: subject vs. object, impression vs. a priori\nprinciples as the basis of knowledge, freedom vs. determinism, and so\non. The emphasis on intentionality avoids these dualisms because it\nentails, on the one hand, that all meanings are constituted through\nacts of human consciousness, thus insisting on the active role of the\nsubject in the formulation of any meaningful aspect of the world. On\nthe other hand, however, the theory of intentionality also implies that\nthe world already contains the meanings that consciousness reveals,\neither because these meanings are potentialities from the point of view\nof human action (this is Sartre\u2019s view), or simply because these\nmeanings are already in the world (Merleau-Ponty\u2019s view, but also\nthat of Marcel, for whom true knowledge arises from the openness to the\nfullness of Being).\n\n\nThe existentialists explicitly embraced the philosophical solution\nthat phenomenology provided. For example, Sartre\u2019s What is\nLiterature?, the key text of existentialist aesthetics, starts off\nby reformulating the fundamental lesson of Husserlian\nphenomenology:\n\n\nEach of our perceptions is accompanied by the consciousness that\nhuman reality is a \u201crevealer\u201d, that is, it is through human\nreality that \u201cthere is\u201d being, or, to put it differently,\nthat man is the means by which things are manifested. It is our\npresence in the world which multiplies relations. It is we who set up\nthis relationship between this tree and a bit of sky. Thanks to us,\nthat star which has been dead for millennia, that quarter moon, and\nthat dark river are associated in the unity of a landscape. It is the\nspeed of our car and our aeroplane which organises the great mass of\nthe earth. With each of our acts, the world reveals to us a new face.\nBut, if we know that we are directors of being, we also know that we\nare not its producers. If we turn away from this landscape, it will\nsink back into its dark permanence. At least, it will sink back; there\nis no one mad enough to think that it is going to be annihilated\n(Sartre 1948a, 26).\n",
