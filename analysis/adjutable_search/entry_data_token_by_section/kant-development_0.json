Childhood: \u201cThe Starry Sky Above Me and the Moral Law Within Me\u201d\nImmanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in K\u00f6nigsberg, East Prussia\n(now Kaliningrad, Russia), as the eldest son of Anna Regina Kant, n\u00e9e\nReuter, (1697\u20131737) and Johann Georg Kant (1683\u20131746). The\nReuters were shoe- and harness-makers; the Kants were harness-makers\n(Riemer, a guild similar to saddlers).  Originally, the\nReuters were from Nuremberg in Bavaria; the Kants were from\nnot-too-distant Tilsit (now Sovietsk, Oblast Kaliningrad; Russia).\nThe union of Kants and Reuters provided an initial economic, emotional\nand religious stability for Kant during his early years. His\ngrandfather and father were competent businessmen, initially\nflourishing and respected in their strata of society. Anna was\nLutheran fit well into the like-minded K\u00f6nigsberg culture.\nImmanuel\u2019s early childhood seems to have been idyllic. The family\nwas rather well off. The parents got along and loved their son. Johann\nKant appears to have been a gentle and hardworking man. Anna Kant, who\ntook care of the family\u2019s paperwork, was well educated. Little\nImmanuel was her constant company, and her influence on him was\nconsiderable.\nAfter \u201cManelchen\u201d could walk, Anna Kant took him out\nfor walks in the meadows and fields. She taught him what she could, of\nthe seasons, the plants and animals, and the sky. Her little son\nresponded eagerly with questions; and the mother encouraged his\noutdoor curiosity with praise, patience, and more information\n(Wasianski 1804: 247).\nThese details of nature provided a formative background for Kant\u2019s\ninterest in natural philosophy, and the child grew up in an\nencouraging environment for early explorations. K\u00f6nigsberg enjoys a\ncool and gentle climate; typical of high latitudes, the flat Baltic\nterrain has not much biological diversity, and its\nbiomes\u2014meadows, moors, deciduous and conifer forests\u2014are\nnot hostile. At Kant\u2019s time, bears and wolves were common along with\nother local fauna, but these posed no serious threat to Kant\u2019s\nearliest encounters with nature. Walks, as the ones he enjoyed at the\nedge of town, were fun and perfectly safe. For Prussians at the time,\nexcursions into nature also had a spiritual subtext. Like Japanese\nShinto, German tradition invests natural places with meaning. The late\nand superficial conversion of the Baltic lands to Christianity, after\nthe fourteenth century, coupled with the fact that persecution drove\npagan faiths temporarily underground instead of eliminating them\naltogether, allowed the ancient nature-worship to prevail in forms\ninoffensive to the clergy, as in the guise of outdoor walks. Thus\npeople used to attend Sunday service\u2014before heading out for\ntheir Sonntagsspaziergang.\nDuring Kant\u2019s earliest years, the local influence of Pietism grew.\nThis Christian movement, founded by Jakob Spener (1635\u20131705) and\npromoted by August Hermann Francke (1663\u20131727), had spread north\nfrom Dresden, Leipzig, and Halle. It reached K\u00f6nigsberg at the turn of\nthe century, making inroads with the creation of schools and\norphanages. As Luther\u2019s Reformation had been the effort to return\nRoman Catholicism to a purer faith, Pietism tried to purify\nLutheranism, stripping it of dogma and detail. The Protestant Church\navoided a schism in Prussia, but at the price of friction between the\nLutheran mainstream, orthodoxy, and the Pietist firebrands. Pietism\nstressed literal exegesis, quiet humility, and charitable deeds. It\nallowed believers to practice a spirituality of mystical\nintensity\u2014but as the purge of Halle University (1723)\nillustrates, it had a totalitarian streak.\nThe local authorities frowned on the movement, but the Pietists\nenjoyed protection of King Friedrich Wilhelm I (reign 1713\u201340)\nand thus persisted. In 1731, the field chaplain Franz Albert Schulz\ncame to town, rising to become the local leader of the movement. He\nwas appointed to director of the Pietist high school\n(the Collegium Fridericianum) and later to professor of\ntheology. One of his early converts was Immanuel\u2019s mother, who brought\nher children to his bible sessions.\nSchulz\u2019s brand of Pietism differed from either Spener\u2019s or\nFrancke\u2019s and \u201cwas fraught with deep ambiguities, having a\ncomponent that was seen elsewhere as contrary to the basic tenets of\ntrue faith\u201d(Kuehn 2001a: 39). Schulz\u2019s Pietism straddled the\nline between Wolffian, rationalistic philosophy and enthusiastic,\nHalle religious sentiment. It stood for the equality of all to\ninterpret the Bible and a practical faith through charitable acts,\nwhile at the same time endorsing the political ambitions of Frederick\nI. It was a grassroots movement that the emphasized the personal\nnature of religion in contrast to establishment orthodoxy;\npolitically, it allied itself with the common citizen over the\nnobility. In K\u00f6nigsberg it was a divisive influence that was in\nconstant struggle with local authorities. In Kant\u2019s formative years,\nK\u00f6nigsberg was a place of religious upheaval, Pietists vs Orthodox\nLutheranism, and this marked conflict was to inform his position of\nreligious toleration and a separation of religion and philosophy.\nAccording to Kant\u2019s later judgment (Wasianski 1804: 246; tr. Kuehn\n2001a: 31), his mother lived out a positive form of Pietism, blending\nlove, tolerance, and spirituality into a faith that was\n\u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201cnot in the least enthusiastic\u201d\n(\u2018enthusiasm\u2019 or Schw\u00e4rmerei means\nfundamentalism). The child\u2019s formation was apparently not hurt by\nAnna\u2019s piety; instead of turning into an intolerant zealot, as many\nPietist\u2019s \u201centhusiasm\u201d did, she instilled a reverence for\nnature and spiritualism, a plausible sense of right and wrong, and\nalways respected him as a person.\nKant is said to have claimed,\nI will never forget my mother, for she implanted\nand nurtured in me the first germ of goodness; she opened my heart to\nthe impressions of nature; she awakened and furthered my concepts, and\nher doctrines have had a continual and beneficial influence in my\nlife. (Jachmann 1804: 169; tr. Kuehn 2001a: 31)\nLater, he would develop a metaphysics whose claims would anticipate\nscientific discoveries, and an ethics that culminated in the\nCategorical Imperative. His friends chose the dictum from\nthe Critique of Practical Reason (1788) for his\ntombstone:\nTwo things fill the mind with ever new and\nincreasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect\nupon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within\nme. (5:161.33\u20136; tr. Guyer 1992: 1)\nHad it not been for his sensitive and intelligent mother, his life\nmight well have taken an entirely different course.\n",
