In academic and legal contexts, it is\ntypically used in the couplet \u201chuman dignity\u201d to denote a\nkind of basic worth or status that purportedly belongs to all persons\nequally, and which grounds fundamental moral or political duties or\nrights. In this sense, many believe that dignity is a defining ideal\nof the contemporary world, especially in western society. However, the\nconcept of dignity has long been associated with many more meanings,\nsome of which cut in distinctly different directions: rank, station,\nhonor, uniqueness, beauty, poise, gravitas, integrity, self-respect,\nself-esteem, a sacred place in the order of things, supreme worth, and\neven the apex of astrological significance. Some of these connotations\nhave faded with time. But most have enduring influence.\n\nSo, what exactly is dignity? Do its different connotations hang\ntogether in any principled way? Does dignity understood as\n\u201cuniversal human worth\u201d, for example, have any meaningful\nconnection to \u201csocial rank\u201d or \u201cpersonal\nintegrity\u201d? Is dignity primarily a moral concept or a political\nand legal one? Even assuming we can make sense of its different\nmeanings, what does dignity demand of us? What does it mean to\nrecognize or respect it? Does it ground rights? If so, which ones? And\nwhere does the idea of dignity come from? What, in other words, is its\nhistory?\n\nThis entry will take up these questions, but without any pretense of\nbeing exhaustive. The goal is to provide a general guide to existing\ntheory and debate, with a focus on philosophical approaches to human\ndignity, and mostly as it figures into the western tradition. The vast\nliterature makes anything more ambitious than this unrealistic, even\nfor an encyclopedic survey.\n", "toc": [{"#HistPrim": "1.

A Historical Primer\n\nIn the opening sentence of its preamble, the 1948 Declaration of Human\nRights affirms the \u201cinherent dignity\u201d and \u201cequal and\ninalienable rights of all members of the human family\u201d as the\n\u201cfoundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\u201d\n(UN 1948). This claim would surprise our modern ancestors. Until about\n1830\u20131850, neither the English term \u201cdignity,\u201d nor\nits Latin root dignitas, nor the French counterpart\ndignit\u00e9, had any stable currency as meaning \u201cthe\nunearned status or worth of all persons\u201d, let alone the grounds\nof universal rights or equality. Instead, in everything from\nHobbes\u2019s Leviathan (1651) to Samuel Johnson\u2019s\nDictionary (1755) to Webster\u2019s Compendious\nDictionary (1806), \u201cdignity\u201d was primarily used with\na conventional merit connotation\u2014something like the \u201crank\nof elevation\u201d that Johnson officially gave it.\n\nHow did this sea change in meaning come about? The UN Declaration\nmakes clear that dignity\u2019s moral-political meaning had become\nnormalized by 1948. But what happened before 1948 that explains this\ntransformation? These are not easy questions to answer. Although\ntheorists often include historical remarks in their inquiries, they\nare just as often brief and subservient to some further,\nnon-historical point. The result is a great many half-told stories\nabout dignity\u2019s past.\n\nThere are some notable exceptions. For some time, legal theorists have\nbeen etching out the details of dignity\u2019s historical role in law\nand jurisprudence, especially in connection to rights. Second,\ntheological inquiries into human dignity often engage an older history\nof ideas, especially the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola or\nscholastic debates about the biblical doctrine of imago Dei.\nThird, there is a considerable body of literature on the Enlightenment\nluminaire, Immanuel Kant, and his famous claim that humans do not have\na \u201cprice\u201d, only a distinctive and incomparable worth or\nW\u00fcrde\u2014usually translated as \u201cdignity\u201d\n(see, e.g., Korsgaard 1986; Meyer 1987; Hill 1992; Kofman 1982 [1997];\nWood 1999; Kain 2009). Let us turn to these various exceptions, and\ntheir challenges.\n1.1 The legal history of dignity\n\nThe connection between law and dignity strikes many as socially and\nmorally urgent. It is thus unsurprising that some serious history of\nthis connection already exists, especially in relation to rights\ntheory (see, e.g., Eberle 2002 or Barak 2015). Nevertheless, the bulk\nof this history does not look back very far.\n\nFor example, Lewis (2007) gives a wonderful overview of the idea of\ndignity in international law, but his focus is on the writing of, and\nreaction to, the 1945 UN Charter and 1948 Declaration of Human Rights.\nOr consider McCrudden\u2019s impressive 2013 edited volume,\nUnderstanding Human Dignity. The historical chapters of this\nvolume make important contributions, but again the focus is largely\nthe twentieth century. Scott\u2019s chapter (2013), for example,\nbegins by observing that the 1848 French decree to abolish slavery\nmotivates itself from the consideration \u201cthat slavery is an\nassault upon human dignity (la dignit\u00e9 humaine)\u201d\n(2013: 61). She then nicely explores the idea of dignity in the\ncontext of post-slavery Louisiana c.1862\u201396. However, the\nchapter then jumps forward to a comparison with Brazilian society\nc.1970\u20132012. Moyn\u2019s chapter (2013) examines early and\nmiddle twentieth century constitutional debates to show that the\nconcept of dignity labors under poorly appreciated debts to a\nspecifically Christian conception of democracy, and for this reason,\nMoyn argues, we should be skeptical about the long-term utility of\ndignity for secular rights theory. And Goos\u2019s chapter (2013)\noffers a close examination of the role of dignity in German thought,\nbut the focus is on post-World War II interpretation of the German\nGrundgesetz (Basic\n Law).[1]\n\nA longer legal history can be found in McCrudden (2008), whose concise\nreview of dignity reaches back to classical Roman thought. McCrudden\nargues that we can trace the merit connotation of dignity as\n\u201celevated social rank\u201d to the Roman idea of\n\u201cdignitas homini\u201d (2008: 656); but also, and\ncrucially, he argues that we can trace our contemporary\nmoral-political notion of the \u201cbasic worth or status of human\npersons\u201d to this same period, when Cicero introduced the idea of\n\u201cthe dignity of the human race\u201d (see also, Cancik 2002).\nThis claim about Cicero is echoed in Michael Rosen\u2019s 2012,\nDignity: Its History and Meaning, which is another important\nentry into dedicated history that focuses on legal connections.\nRosen\u2019s history is mostly from a bird\u2019s eye view, but,\nlike McCrudden\u2019s, Rosen\u2019s history has the virtue of taking\na long view that stretches back to antiquity. Moreover, Rosen offers\nsome nuanced reflections on eighteenth and nineteenth century\nconnections, including Kant\u2019s influence on the writing of the\nGerman Grundgesetz.\n\nFinally, when it comes to legal history, Darwall (2017) offers a\nsophisticated analysis of dignity\u2019s connections to western\nEnlightenment conceptions of jurisprudence stretching back to the\nsixteenth century. Importantly, however, Darwall\u2019s history\nchallenges McCrudden\u2019s and Rosen\u2019s appeal to Cicero as a\nkey source. We will return to this scholarly disagreement and\nDarwall\u2019s competing proposal below\n (\u00a71.2.2\n and\n \u00a71.2.4).\n1.2 Four Origin Stories\n\nGiven the present popularity of studying dignity, we should not only\nexpect the historical contours of dignity to become clearer in coming\nyears, but also for them to be occasionally redrawn. A few important\nplatitudes have already been challenged.\n1.2.1 The revolutionary platitude\n\nThe western creed of human dignity stems from the wisdom of\neighteenth-century revolutionary thinkers such as Thomas Jefferson,\nAlexander Hamilton, or Gilbert du Motier, the Marquis de Lafayette. At\nthe founding of new liberal states like America, or the reformation of\nexisting ones like England or France, political sages like these\npropounded the inviolable value of individual human beings.\n\nIn reality, one looks in vain for dignity in the founding documents of\nthese new republics. The term appears a few times in the English Bill\nof Rights (1689), but not with our contemporary moral-political\nmeaning. It appears once in the French D\u00e9claration des\nDroits de l\u2019Homme et du Citoyen (1789), but the connotation\nis of the privileges that attend public or political office. And for\nall its fiery rhetoric about equality and the\n\u201cinalienable\u201d rights of man, the US Declaration of\nIndependence does not mention human dignity at all. Nor does the US\nConstitution. In fact, it is not until the Mexican Constitution of\n1917 and the 1919 Weimer Constitution, that the term appears in a\nconstitutional context possibly with its moral-political\nconnotation (McCrudden 2008; Debes 2009 and 2017b). To this corrective\nevidence, we should add the testimony of an entirely different set of\nhistorical voices\u2014from Sojourner Truth, David Walker, Anna\nWheeler, and William Thompson, to Susan B. Anthony, Frederick\nDouglass, James Rapier, and Ida B. Wells\u2014who remind us that the\nrevolutionary platitude was contradicted by the lived reality\nwithin these new republics. These voices decried the\nsystematic oppression and often bloody inhumanity that stained the\nsupposedly egalitarian societies in which they lived.\n1.2.2 The Kantian platitude\n\nThe early modern concept of dignity originates with Immanuel Kant, who\nin his 1785 Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, argued\nthat all persons have an inherent value, or dignity, in virtue of\ntheir rational autonomy. This value commands a distinct kind of moral\nrespect, which we express by abiding by certain limits in our\ntreatment of others. Thus, Kant argued that we have a categorical duty\nto treat persons always \u201cas an end\u201d and \u201cnever merely as\na means\u201d (Groundwork, 4:429).\n\nThis is the greatest dogma about dignity in philosophy. But there are\ngood reasons to rethink it in favor of a more complicated history of\nideas. First, although it is well known that Kant is indebted to\nRousseau in various ways (see especially Beiser 1992), recent\nscholarship suggests that when it comes to his ideas about\n\u201chumanity\u201d and \u201cdignity\u201d, the debt runs deeper\nthan is generally understood (James 2013; Hanley 2017; Sensen 2017).\nSensen also argues that it is a longstanding interpretive mistake to\nthink that Kant grounds the obligation to respect others on\nany \u201cabsolute inner value\u201d that humans possess; and that\n\u201cdignity\u201d is not the name Kant gave to such a value anyway\n(Sensen 2011 & 2017; see also Meyer 1987). Relatedly, Debes (2021)\nargues that contemporary philosophers have greatly overestimated\nKant\u2019s influence on the historical development of our notion of\nmoral respect for persons.\n\nOn top of these corrections, Darwall (2017) argues that the conceptual\nlink between dignity and rights does not originate with Kant.\nAccording to Darwall, only certain conceptions of dignity will support\nthe kind of inferences about respect that could justify using dignity\nto ground human rights. Namely, those conceptions that render dignity\nas a kind of authoritative standing to make\n\u201csecond-personal\u201d claims\u2014that is, claims by one\nperson to another. However, the original insight for this\ncrucial point, Darwall further argues, comes from the natural lawyer\nSamuel Pufendorf (see also Darwall 2012).\n\nWriting a century before Kant, Pufendorf argued that human beings have\nperfect natural rights (rights owed to one another) in virtue of a\ncertain moral \u201cstanding\u201d that we assign to each other as a\nconstitutive part of being sociable. Whenever we address another\nperson directly\u2014e.g., with a claim like \u201cYou must allow me\nto speak\u201d\u2014we implicitly treat them as an accountable,\nresponsible being. Otherwise, why address them at all? And the same is\ntrue when they address us. In other words, according to Pufendorf,\nbeing sociable implicitly involves a reciprocal assumption of\nbasic moral status\u2014us of them, them of us\u2014whenever we\ninteract, and even if the address is one that offends the equal\nstanding of the other. Indeed, this is precisely when\n\u201cdignity\u201d becomes most urgent. Thus, Pufendorf writes:\n\n\nThere seems to him to be somewhat of Dignity\n[dignatio] in the appellation of Man: so\nthat the last and most efficacious Argument to curb the Arrogance of\ninsulting Men, is usually, I am not a Dog but a Man as well as\nyourself. (1672: I.VII.I [2003]: 100)\n\n1.2.3 The imago Dei platitude\n\nThe moralized concept of dignity does not originate in the early\nmodern era. It was celebrated as early as the Renaissance, in Giovanni\nPico della Mirandola\u2019s 1486 Oration on the Dignity of\nMan. Moreover, Pico\u2019s oration is drawn from the older,\nmedieval Christian doctrine of imago Dei (based on Genesis\n1:26 and Wisdom 2:23), which tells us that we are made in \u201cin\nthe image of God\u201d, and that this likeness grounds our\ndistinctive moral worth or status.\n\nThis story about dignity is to Christian theology what the Kantian\ndogma is to philosophy. However, these claims are usually misleading\nif not false. For example, Copenhaver (2017) flatly contradicts the\nclaim that Pico was talking about human dignity in a sense akin to our\ncontemporary moral-political notion. First, Copenhaver notes that the\ntitle of the work, which draws our attention, postdates Pico (who\nnever published it). More substantively, Copenhaver argues that\nPico\u2019s speech was a public failure in large part because it was\nentangled with Kabbalah mysteries for how humans can escape the body\nto increase their status by becoming angels. Finally,\nCopenhaver points out that Pico uses the Latin dignitas only\ntwice; and\n\n\nIn neither case does dignitas belong to humans, except\naspirationally, and neither justifies \u201cdignity\u201d as a\ntranslation, with all the Kantian baggage of the modern English word.\n(2017: 134\u20135)\n\n\nAdding to this reversal of fortunes, Kent (2017) marshals extensive\nevidence from the scholastic tradition against the imago Dei\nplatitude more generally. Although she confirms that both dignity and\nthe doctrine of imago Dei were widely discussed by medieval\nChristian scholars in the Latin West, she convincingly demonstrates\nthat these discussions did not intersect in a way that supports an\ninference to our contemporary moral-political notion of the\n\u201cbasic worth or status of humans\u201d. This said, not all\ninterpretations of the Christian tradition, including the doctrine of\nimago Dei, are beholden to this historical platitude. And the\nimago Dei line of inquiry on dignity has a somewhat different\nlife in the Jewish\n tradition.[2]\n1.2.4 The Ciceronian platitude\n\n\u201cDignity\u201d derives from the Latin dignitas. And\nwhile most Romans used dignitas only in its merit sense, a\nfew, and Cicero in particular, had a proleptic understanding of\ndignitas that anticipated today\u2019s moral-political\nsense.\n\nThis historical view has attracted more attention lately, as evidenced\nby its earlier noted endorsement in McCrudden (2008) and Rosen (2012a)\n(see also, Englard 2000). However, it has been challenged on both\nphilosophical and interpretive grounds. For example, Miriam Griffin\n(2017) carefully demonstrates that the textual support for this view\nis very thin. She argues that straightforward lexical analysis of\nRoman sources offers sparing evidence for connecting dignitas\nto our contemporary moral-political concept. Moreover, even if we\nbranch out to other ancient Roman concepts to see if dignity might be\nhiding under different terminology, we run into a fundamental\nchallenge: \u201cStoics and Roman moralists\u201d, Griffin explains,\n\u201cthink in terms of officia, obligations or duties or\nfunctions that our nature, properly understood, imposes on\nus\u201d. Correspondingly, \u201c[t]he entitlements and\nrights of those at the receiving end of our actions is not a\nprominent aspect of their thinking\u201d (2017: 49).\n\nAdmittedly, Griffin allows that in some cases these obligations or\nduties entail a kind of treatment of others that accords with\nour contemporary notion of human dignity. Still, this result does not\ndepend on any right that persons have in virtue of \u201cthe worth of\na human being per se\u201d (2017: 64; see also Meyer 1987; and Lebech\n2009, especially p. 46 n. 22.)\n\nTo these challenges, Darwall (2017) adds another problem for the\nCiceronian platitude. Borrowing from the exact quotations that\nMcCrudden and Rosen use to defend attributing a moral-political notion\nof human dignity to Cicero, Darwall argues:\n\n\nHuman dignity for Cicero is nothing that could be established\nby conventional patterns of deference. It is the idea, rooted in the\nancient notion of a great chain of being, that distinctive capacities\nfor self-development \u201cby study and reflection\u201d give human\nbeings a \u201cnature\u201d \u201csuperior\u201d to that of\n\u201ccattle and other animals\u201d. Other species are motivated\nonly by sensory instincts, whereas human beings can \u201clearn that\nsensual pleasure is wholly unworthy of the dignity of the human\nrace\u201d, and be guided by this understanding.\n\n[Consequently] nothing in the Ciceronian notion of human dignity\nrequires, or even leads naturally to, basic human rights. The\nproposition, for example, that \u201csensual pleasure\u201d is\n\u201cunworthy\u201d of human dignity is less a thesis about what\nhuman beings are in a position to claim from one another by virtue of\ntheir dignity than it is an ethical standard to which we are to live\nup. (2017: 182\u20133; Cicero quotations cited in McCrudden 2008: 657, and\nRosen 2012a: 12)\n\n\nTo be fair, Darwall\u2019s critique hangs on two assumptions about\nthe concept of dignity: (1) that a satisfactory account of dignity\nwill involve a connection to, if not a grounding for, rights claims;\nand (2) that dignity is in no way an achievement. Both assumptions\nresonate strongly with contemporary moral-political talk of dignity.\nNevertheless, identifying these assumptions should remind us that we\nhave not yet clearly formulated a concept of dignity. So, let us turn\nto that\n task.[3]\n2. Formulating Dignity\n\nThere is no single, incontestable meaning of dignity. In fact, there\nare so many possible meanings that it has become commonplace in the\nliterature to worry about the expansive variety of conceptions, and in\nturn to worry whether dignity is or has become essentially ambiguous.\nAnd while its defenders find ways to mitigate or explain away this\nambiguity, the concept of dignity has its share of detractors. But we\nwill return to skeptical worries at the end of this entry. For now,\nand granting the prima facie force of the ambiguity worry,\nfour broad categories of meaning stand out across context and\nhistory:\n\nDignity as Gravitas: a poise or grace\nassociated with behavioral comportment; e.g., the sophisticated\nmanners or elegant speech of nobility, or outward composure in the\nface of insult or duress.\nDignity as Integrity: the family of ideas\nassociated with living up to personal or social standards of character\nand conduct, either in one\u2019s own eyes or the eyes of\nothers.\nDignity as Status: noble or elevated social\nposition or rank.\nDignity as Human dignity: the unearned worth or\nstatus that all humans share equally (either inherent or\nconstructed).\n\n\nThis \u201cgeneral schema\u201d is rough and ready. Scholars divide\nthe conceptual space in different ways, often advocating intersections\nbetween the foregoing four categories, making elaborations on them, or\nnoting wrinkles within them.\n\nFor example, Kolnai (1976) argues that the primary function of the\nconcept is descriptive, not evaluative. Dignity is a quality of\npersons, which is the fitting object of a set of pro-attitudes related\nto both moral appreciation and aesthetic appreciation. Thus,\nto be dignified is to comport oneself in a way that is not simply a\nreflection of authority, rank, moral uprightness, or a regimented or\nserious adherence to codes of conduct, but instead reflects something\nof \u201cthe beautiful\u201d. As Kolnai puts it, our response to\ndignity is characterized, at least in part, by \u201cour devoted and\nadmiring appreciation for beauty\u201d (1976: 252). Hence the\ndistinction between\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n above (see also Brady 2007).\n\nBy contrast, although Rosen (2012a) notes that the Latin term\ndignitas was once part of a critical vocabulary of classical\nart and rhetoric, used \u201cto characterize speech that was weighty\nand majestic, in contrast to discourse that was light and\ncharming\u201d (2012a: 13), Rosen largely blends categories\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n into a single strand of meaning, which he identifies as\n\u201cdignity as behavior, character or bearing that is\ndignified\u201d (2012a: 54). Rosen then accepts\n (3)\n and\n (4)\n but adds his own further category, which he calls \u201cdignity as\ntreatment\u201d: \u201cTo treat someone with dignity\nis\u2026to respect their dignity\u201d (2012a: 58). As we\nwill see more fully in a moment, this addition reflects a common\nobservation by scholars about a tight connection between dignity and\nits recognition (although, it is not common to claim that the proper\nrecognition of dignity is a separate category of dignity).\n\nMeanwhile, Kateb (2011) stresses the need to distinguish between human\ndignity qua individual humans, and human dignity qua\nhuman species. According to Kateb, both have dignity. But whereas the\ndignity of individuals can be described as a special kind of\n\u201cstatus\u201d\u2014as in category\n (4)\n above\u2014the dignity of the human species requires a further\nconcept, namely, of \u201cstature\u201d. He writes, \u201cIn\ncomparison to other species, humanity has a stature beyond\ncomparison\u201d (2011: 6). To be clear, Kateb does not think that\nthe human species has an existence above and beyond its members: it is\nnot a natural kind. However, he argues that the interdependence of\nhumans is,\n\n\nso extensive, so deep, and so entangled\u2026that for certain\npurposes we might just as well make the human species a unified entity\nor agency, even though we know it isn\u2019t. (2011: 6)\n\n\nCorrespondingly, we can sensibly talk about the \u201cdignity\u201d\nof the species. This conclusion cuts against some positions that\nmaintain dignity \u201cproper\u201d can only belong to individuals\n(Stern 1975; Gaylin 1984; Egonsson 1998).\n\nA more recent schema is offered by Killmister (2020). Killmister\nproposes three \u201cstrands\u201d of dignity: personal, social, and\nstatus. To have personal dignity, Killmister argues, is to take\noneself to be subject to personal \u201cdignitarian\u201d norms. And\nto have social dignity is to be subject to social\n\u201cdignitarian\u201d norms. What are dignitarian norms?\nDignitarian norms are norms that either the person themself, or\nsociety at large, take to be \u201cennobling\u201d to uphold, or\nwhose transgression the person or society consider to be\n\u201cdisgraceful or debasing\u201d (2020: 25, 29). Like Rosen,\nthen, Killmister effectively blends categories\n (1)\n and\n (2),\n while at the same time drawing attention to a different\norganizational distinction one might make, namely, between the\npersonal and the social. As for \u201cstatus dignity\u201d,\nKillmister argues that explaining this category of dignity requires a\ndistinctive concept of respect. And her argument is worth elaborating\nbecause it exemplifies and fleshes out two closely related points\nshared by many existing theories:\n\nthat any satisfactory theory of dignity must explain what it means\nto recognize dignity; and\nthat this recognition is best described as a kind of\nrespect.\n\n\nSo, consider: Dignitarian norms, according to Killmister, can\ntypically be redescribed as articulating the grounds of\nrespect\u2014either self-respect (in the case of personal dignity) or\nrespect from others (in the case of social dignity). Moreover, the\nkind of respect relevant to personal and social dignity, she argues,\nis what Stephen Darwall (1977) influentially named \u201cappraisal\nrespect\u201d. This kind of respect is a positive evaluative\nattitude or feeling, which we express towards\nourselves or others, for some merit of character. In this sense,\nrespect is akin to esteem. Killmister writes:\n\n\nto be highly personally dignified is to be such that, by our own\nlights, we ought to hold ourselves in high esteem\u2026to be highly\nsocially dignified is to be such that, by the light of our community,\nthey ought to hold us in high esteem. (2020: 23)\n\n\nBy contrast, Killmister connects status dignity to what Darwall\ncalled, \u201crecognition respect\u201d. Recognition respect is a\nway of thinking about oneself or others. To recognize-respect\nsomeone (at least as Darwall first explained it) is to give\nappropriate weight to some fact about them in our practical\ndeliberations, and to restrict our choices or actions accordingly.\n\nKillmister thus argues,\n\n\nWe come to have status dignity, when we fall within a\nparticular [social] category, membership in which commands respectful\ntreatment from others in our community. (2020: 22)\n\n\nShe elaborates,\n\n\nstatus dignity does not call on others to esteem us, but\nrather to treat us in ways appropriate to the kind of thing\nwe are. (2020: 23, emphasis added)\n\n\nCorrespondingly, human dignity ends up as \u201can especially\nimportant instance\u201d of status dignity. And all humans deserve\nrecognition respect in virtue of the \u201cfact\u201d of their\nmembership in the category \u201chuman\u201d (2020:\n129\u201330).\n\nThis said, Killmister\u2019s conclusion diverges from Darwall\u2019s\nown account of human dignity, which is tied to a revision he made to\nhis theory of recognition respect, which connected recognition respect\nto the reciprocal \u201cauthority\u201d of second-personal address,\nas discussed in the earlier historical reflection on Pufendorf (see\n \u00a71.2.3\n above; and Darwall 2006, esp. p. 14). Note also that Killmister, like\nKateb, eschews thinking of \u201chuman\u201d as a natural kind, in\nfavor of understanding it as a social kind.\n2.1 Dignity\u2019s defining properties vs. dignity\u2019s grounds\n\nThe previous section offered examples of how the general schema of\ndignity\u2019s meaning gets modified in existing theory, as well as\nhow each category of meaning might be fleshed out. More examples could\nbe given. But to decide between any of them, it seems crucial to ask,\nhow should we formulate the concept of dignity? In other\nwords, instead of simply cataloging first-order views about its\nmeaning, we need to introduce some second-order criteria.\n\nOn the one hand, we need to determine the defining properties\nof dignity: the distinguishing characteristics or explanatory demands\nthat are supposed to apply to any contentful account of dignity. Such\ncriteria might include, for example, that dignity is\n\u201cinherent\u201d; that it is \u201cincommensurable\u201d with\nother values; that it has a \u201cdistinctive normative\nfunction\u201d; that it has an essential connection to rights; and so\non.\n\nOn the other hand, we need to determine what grounds dignity:\nwe need to say what it is about humans, or any being with dignity,\nthat satisfies the defining properties. In other words, we need to\nanswer the question: In virtue of what do we have dignity? The most\ncommon answer to this question, historically speaking, especially when\nit comes to human dignity, involves a claim about autonomy. Or if not\nautonomy tout court, then the \u201ccapabilities\u201d for such\nautonomy (see, e.g., Nussbaum 1995, 2006a, and 2006b). Thus, one\nfinds many variations of the claim that humans have dignity in virtue\nof their capacity for (or exercise of) \u201cchoice\u201d or\n\u201crational agency\u201d\u2014claims that are often tethered to\nthe earlier discussed historical platitude about Kant. This said,\nalternatives to the grounding question about human dignity include\nbrute species membership, sentience, the creative power of humanity,\ncreation \u201cin the image of God\u201d, a politically conferred\nstatus as \u201crights bearer\u201d, the capacity for empathy and\ncaring relationships, the earlier mentioned \u201cpersonality\u201d,\nthe concrete \u201cparticularity\u201d of an individual person, and\nthe possession of \u201cperspective\u201d.\n\nSorting these views is not easy for a few reasons. First, some of the\noperative concepts, such as \u201cautonomy\u201d, are themselves\nhotly disputed. Second, there is no pre-theoretical reason to deny\nmultiple ways of satisfying any given definitional criteria. That is,\nany given proposal for the defining properties of dignity might be\nsatisfied by more than one ground. For example, depending on the\ncriteria, humans might \u201chave\u201d dignity in virtue of both\nautonomy and sentience, or both divine creation and\nour capacity for empathy, and so on. Third, twentieth century\ntheorists rarely took a second-order view on their subject and\nmethods. In turn, they often confused or at least failed to clarify\nwhich of the two foregoing challenges they were trying to tackle,\narticulating dignity\u2019s defining properties or articulating\ndignity\u2019s grounds.\n\nThankfully, twenty-first century formulations of dignity are marked by\nincreasingly conscientious attempts to articulate the defining\nproperties of dignity, and to do so in a way that might guide\ndiscussion about dignity\u2019s grounds. For example, in\n\u201cBedrock Truths and the Dignity of the Individual\u201d,\nIglesias (2001) distinguishes between historically older,\n\u201crestricted\u201d meanings of dignity associated with general\nschema\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3);\n and, on the other hand, what she calls \u201cuniversal\u201d\nmeanings associated with schema\n (4),\n \u201chuman dignity\u201d. She further argues that any satisfactory\nuniversalist account must render human dignity as \n (4a) \n in some sense \u201cinherent\u201d or \u201cintrinsic\u201d; and \n (4b) \n the \u201cgrounds\u201d of basic rights. Regarding the latter, Iglesias\nwrites:\n\n\nThe connection is essential. It is rooted in the concept of the human\nperson, in human self-understanding as constituted by the bedrock\ntruths about what and who we are\u2026The universal meaning of the\nconcept of dignity, as inherent to every human being,\nexpresses the intrinsic good that the human being is. The\ndistinct human rights articulate those basic intrinsic\ngoods proper to, and expressive of, each one\u2019s dignity,\nindividually and in community relationships\u2014as dimensions of our\nvery being. These basic goods\u2014guaranteed as rights\u2014must be\nrecognized, respected, and promoted so that the intrinsic good that\nthe human being is himself or herself, personally and as an\nindividual, may be preserved and assured. Thus, the ground for\nadvocacy and defense of human rights resides on what and who the human\nbeing is, as a human being, namely on his or her dignity.\n(2001: 130)\n\n\nBy comparison, Shultziner (2007) adopts a\n\u201cphilosophical-linguistic\u201d method to distinguish\nmoral-philosophical uses of dignity from political and legal\n\u201cfunctions\u201d of the concept, especially the use of dignity\nto ground specific rights and enforceable duties. Regarding the\nlatter, Shultziner stresses that in real world contexts, the rights\nwhich the concept of dignity is used to ground vary considerably:\n\n\nThere is no fixed and universal content that spouts out of human\ndignity and, hence, its content and meanings are determined separately\nin each legal document in accordance with the political agreement\nachieved at the time. (2007: 78)\n\n\nThis might seem to express skepticism about the possibility of any\ngeneral, stable concept of dignity. In fact, it underlines the point\nof Iglesias\u2019s final criterion\n (4b);\n namely, that a defining property of dignity is the grounding\nconnection to rights. In other words, strictly speaking, Shultziner\nagrees with Iglesias that at least one defining property of\nhuman dignity\u2014in political contexts\u2014is that dignity\ngrounds rights, even though the content of these rights vary greatly\nbecause the grounds of dignity itself vary greatly.\n [4]\n\nAnother example of second-order thinking can be found in Debes (2009),\nwho argues that any satisfactory \u201cformal\u201d account of human\ndignity\u2014by which he means an account of its defining\nproperties\u2014must pick out a \u201cdistinctive\u201d value or\nstatus belonging to humans. And it must be distinctive in the sense\nthat it (a) is not merit based, but instead unearned; (b) is in some\nsense \u201cincommensurable\u201d with other values; and (c) makes\nsense of the basic \u201cnormative function\u201d of the concept.\nRegarding (c), Debes argues that the concept of dignity does not\npurport to be only or even mainly descriptive. Instead, it has a\nnormative purpose or role, namely, \u201cto set off in our\npractical deliberations whatever \u2018dignity\u2019 is applied\nto\u2014to guard or protect what has dignity\u201d (2009:\n61\u20132).\n\nOr consider Waldron (2012), who tracks a confusion in legal\ndiscussions of dignity between (on the one hand) definitional claims\nabout dignity\u2019s defining properties and (on the other hand)\nclaims about dignity\u2019s practical conditions; that is, the\nconditions of its moral, social, or political recognition. Thus,\nWaldron notes the way that various human rights charters claim that\ndignity is \u201cinherent\u201d in the human person; but also\n\u201ccommand us to make heroic efforts to establish\neveryone\u2019s dignity\u201d (2012: 16, emphasis added). Such\nclaims, he writes, may look like an equivocation akin to claiming, as\nRousseau once did, that \u201cMan is born free but everywhere is in\nchains\u201d\u2014a claim that Jeremy Bentham later called\n\u201cmiserable nonsense\u201d. However, Waldron argues that Bentham\nmissed an easy explanation of Rousseau:\n\n\n[A person] might be identified as a free man in a juridical\nsense\u2014that is his legal status\u2014even though he is found in\nconditions of slavery\u2026So, similarly, one might say that every\nhuman person is free as a matter of status\u2014the status accorded\nto him by his creator\u2014even though it is the case that some\nhumans are actually in chains and need to have their freedom\nrepresented as the content of a normative demand. (2012:\n16\u201317)\n\n\nTo be clear, Waldron quickly adds that one might shy away from the\nspecific premise of divine creation as a way of grounding human\nfreedom. That metaphysical premise is only an example. His overarching\npoint is that it is not incoherent to make this kind of\nclaim. Because the operative claim about the status of human\npersons\u2014namely, that they are free\u2014is a claim about a\ndefining property of the concept of \u201cman\u201d (in a juridical\nsense), it follows that we can distinguish this claim from any further\nclaim about what grounds this \u201cfree\u201d status, as well any\nclaim about the worldly conditions that are required for this status\nto be expressed, realized, or recognized.\n\nKeeping this in mind, we can now understand why Waldron thinks that we\nare not necessarily equivocating if we claim that dignity is\ninherent, but nevertheless enjoin others to\nestablish it in practice. He writes,\n\n\nOn the one hand, the term [\u201cdignity\u201d] may be used to\nconvey something about the inherent rank or status of human beings; on\nthe other hand, it may be used concomitantly to convey the demand that\nrank or status should actually be recognized. (2012: 17)\n\n\nImportantly Waldron further argues that dignity finds its proper\nconceptual home not in morality, but in the legal context of rights.\nHe writes, \u201claw is its natural habitat\u201d (2012: 13). This\nis because, he argues, rights articulate, or flesh out, the kind of\nstatus that modern conceptions of dignity typically include or allude\nto; but also, which his own theory depends on. Thus, for Waldron, it\nis historically mistaken and theoretically confused to ground our\ncontemporary concept of human dignity on thick metaphysical\nbases\u2014some inviolable value that \u201cinheres\u201d in\nhumans, whether by dint of divine creation or otherwise. Instead, on\nWaldron\u2019s view, the contemporary notion of human dignity is\nessentially Samuel Johnson\u2019s old idea of \u201celevated\nrank\u201d, albeit refashioned in the modern consciousness\nto apply to all humans.\n\nIn other words, Waldron explains the historical revolution in our\nconcept of dignity as turning on a leveling up of all people\nto the kind of social status once reserved only for the noble elite.\nWe simply reappropriated the term \u201cdignity\u201d to describe\nthis high status, ditching its original \u201csortal\u201d\nconnotation for a new egalitarian one (2012: 57\u201361).\nFurthermore, he claims that all this happened through (or mainly\nthrough) the paradigm of rights. Oversimplifying for sake of argument:\nWaldron thinks that people of lower social rank successfully annexed\nthe rights reserved to those of higher ranks, by reinterpreting those\nrights as human rights. Hence why rights remain the critical\napparatus for fleshing out the kind of status relevant to\n\u201cdignity\u201d, and why the proper home of dignity is law, not\nmorality.\n\nWaldron\u2019s view on dignity has been influential, so a few more\nnotes about it are fitting. First, in making these claims about\ndignity-as-elevated-rank, Waldron partly aligns himself with Appiah\n(2010), although Waldron does not seem to notice this. Second,\nWaldron\u2019s claim about the \u201chome\u201d of dignity is\ncontentious. It is prima facie hard to square with everyday\nclaims about human dignity, which seem evenly spread over moral,\npolitical, and legal contexts. And it contradicts Shultziner (2007),\ndiscussed above. Moreover, Dimock (2012), Herzog (2012), and Rosen\n(2012b) challenge it directly, among others (see, e.g., Bird\n2013).\n\nMost important, however, in the greater context of discussing the\ndefining prosperities of dignity, it is to register Waldron\u2019s\nunderlying suggestion about an \u201cessential\u201d connection\nbetween dignity and rights. As we have seen, this claim finds wide\ntraction in the literature, even in accounts of dignity that are at\nodds with the Appiah-Waldron view of\n\u201cdignity-as-elevated-rank\u201d. For example, considering only\naccounts reviewed so far, Iglesias (2001) made the same claim; Darwall\n(2017) implies it; and both Kateb (2011) and Killmister (2020) endorse\nit in different ways. This raises an obvious question: What exactly is\nthe connection between dignity and rights?\n2.2 Is a connection to rights a defining property of dignity?\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to answer this question in\nanything close to a comprehensive way. (Good starting points include\nMeyer and Parent 1992; Gewirth 1992, Carozza 2008 and 2013;\nand Tasioulas 2013). Instead, let us draw out a few points about the\nconnection between dignity and rights as it bears specifically on\nattempts to make it a defining property of dignity itself. To get at\nthese points, consider a final proposal about the definitional\ncriteria of dignity, from Fitzpatrick (2013):\n\n\nThe primary notion of dignity is the idea of a certain moral\nstatus involving possession of an inherent, unearned form of\nworth or standing\u2014a basic worth or standing that is neither\ndependent on one\u2019s being of use or interest to others nor based\non one\u2019s merits, and which essentially calls for certain forms\nof respect. (2013: 5546)\n\n\nFitzpatrick presents this definition within the context of an\nencyclopedic effort to capture its meaning. As such, he is\nunderstandably aiming at something generic. However, in the light of\nour analysis so far, the tensions in his attempt are manifest, albeit\ninstructive.\n\nFirst, describing dignity as primarily a \u201cstatus\u201d instead\nof a \u201cvalue\u201d aligns with those like Waldron, who make a\nprincipled distinction between their accounts and all kinds of\n\u201cworth\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d conceptions of human\ndignity (see, e.g., Killmister 2020, who emphasizes this distinction;\nand Dan-Cohen 2012, for analysis on its import to Waldron).\nHowever, Fitzpatrick immediately equivocates on this point, redefining\nstatus as, \u201cworth or standing\u201d. Similarly,\nconsider that those like Appiah-Waldron who think human dignity\ndepends on a refashioned idea of high social rank, must, strictly\nspeaking, reject the property of \u201cinherentness\u201d that\nFitzpatrick appeals to. But they might allow for the\nalternative description of \u201cunearned\u201d, especially if this\nis interpreted as historically indexed to the refashioned conception\nof status.\n\nMore important for the question about rights is to consider\nFitzpatrick\u2019s final remark that dignity, \u201ccalls for\ncertain forms of respect\u201d. At first blush, this appeal might\nseem to be merely a refinement of Debes\u2019s (2009) claim that\ndignity has a distinctive \u201cnormative function\u201d. If so, it\nwould be a refinement that is common to many theorists, as we already\nnoted in\n \u00a72.1.\n However, Fitzpatrick immediately connects this generic claim about\nrespect to two specific elaborations of dignity\u2019s normative\nfunction. He writes:\n\n\nIt is in this sense [of an inherent worth or standing that calls for\nrespect] that many hold that all persons possess a fundamental,\ninalienable dignity, which grounds \n [1] \n basic rights\u2026or \n [2] \n the authority to make claims and demands of others. (2013: 5546)\n\n\nBoth claims merit elaboration.\n\nThe first\n claim [1]\n gives voice to the strongest, or at least the most direct way to make\nthe connection to rights a defining property of dignity, by making\ndignity the normative basis of rights. Thus, suppose one asks\nof any given right x, what justifies the claim that\n\u201cx is a human right\u201d? The answer for those who\ntake this line is, \u201cdignity\u201d. Or at least, \u201chuman\ndignity\u201d.\n\nNow, in one sense,\n claim [1]\n is unsurprising given that it has legal reality. For example,\nalthough the claim is only implicit in the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights (1948) as well as the original Charter of the\nUnited Nations (1945), a 1966 amendment to the Charter\nmade it explicit, declaring that rights \u201cderived from the\ninherent dignity of persons\u201d. Moreover, claims like this have\nbecome increasingly common in state constitutions, especially in the\nwest, as well as other international charters and humanitarian\ndeclarations (see, e.g., Schachter 1983, Iglesias 2001, Shultziner\n2007, and McCrudden 2008, for summaries and analysis).\n\nAnd yet, it is important to note that such legal claims are almost\nalways brute assertions. They are not conscientious attempts at\ntheory. More exactly, they do not claim that any adequate theory of\ndignity (as a concept) must account for the grounding\nrelationship between dignity and rights. This is important because,\npace FitzPatrick, or those like James Griffin (2008) who\nadamantly stress dignity as the foundation of rights, some theorists\nchallenge or avoid or even reject\n claim [1].\n This includes skeptics who challenge the viability of any existing\nsubstantive accounts of dignity to ground rights (discussed later).\nBut it also includes some theorists who defend dignity (in one form or\nother). For example, Waldron skirts around the kind of commitment at\nissue in claim [1]. He allows that dignity involves each person\nthinking of themselves, \u201cas a self-originating source of legal\nand moral claims\u201d (2012: 60), but the overarching implication of\nhis argument is that rights articulate the nature of the\n\u201chigh\u201d status humans have been elevated to. Dignity is\nthus not the normative basis of rights on his view. Instead,\nlegal systems, and rights in particular, \u201cconstitute and\nvindicate human dignity, both in their explicit provisions and in\ntheir overall modus operandi\u201d (2012: 67).\n\nKillmister (2020) follows Waldron\u2019s lead, but she is more\nexplicit. \u201c[H]uman rights\u201d, she argues, \u201cform part\nof our articulation of how members of the human kind ought to be\ntreated\u201d (2020: 143). And, like Shultziner (2007), she warns\nagainst attempts to derive the content of rights directly from\ndignity, a warning that further tells against making\n claim [1]\n part of the definitional criteria. Relatedly, Meyer (1989) concludes\nthat insofar as we aim to explain rights, we can never successfully\nexplain dignity: \u201cWhile having and exercising certain rights is\nimportant to our dignity as human beings\u201d, Meyer argues,\n\n\nwhat we commonly regard as essential to human dignity would not be\nexplained even if we were able to delineate all of the relevant rights\nand the particular ways in which each of them expresses or protects\nhuman dignity. (1989: 521)\n\n\nMeyer\u2019s point is enhanced (perhaps even preempted) by\nDonnelly\u2019s (1982) sociological claim that in cultures where\n\u201crights\u201d are or once were a relatively foreign concept,\nhuman dignity is not. If Donnelly is correct, then excepting\nmotivational purposes, rights theory is arguably a non-starter for a\nproper account of dignity\u2019s defining properties (see also,\nHoward 1992, who partly recapitulates Donnelly\u2019s point).\n\nPiling onto this, Schroeder (2012) and Moyn (2013) warn that the\n\u201cnormative basis\u201d version of the connection claim between\nrights and dignity\u2014i.e.,\n claim [1]\u2014leaves\n dignity vulnerable, because our contemporary concept of human dignity\ncarries underappreciated debts to non-secular, theological traditions\n(see also Addis 2013). And Valentini (2017) argues that the\nplausibility of claim [1] depends on which other defining properties\nof dignity we want to defend. Specifically, if dignity is taken to be\ninherent, she argues, then claim [1] becomes not only\n\u201cuninformative\u201d because \u201cthe notion of inherent\ndignity is opaque\u201d; it also becomes counterproductive to the\naims of most rights theories. This is because, she continues, the\ninherentness claim pushes rights debates, \u201cinto deep\nmetaphysical waters\u201d, and distracts us from the main political\nfunction of rights (especially, human rights), namely, to\nconstrain, \u201cthe conduct of powerful actors\u201d (2017:\n862\u20133).\n\nNow consider connection\n claim [2]:\n dignity grounds the authority to make claims in general.\nSome have argued that the first connection\n claim [1],\n which makes dignity the normative basis of rights, is ultimately just\na special case of the second claim [2], about authority. Perhaps most\nwell-known in this respect is Feinberg (1970 [1980]), who, in the\ncourse of arguing that the act or practice of making interpersonal\nclaims is what \u201cgives rights their special moral\nsignificance\u201d, adds this passing remark about dignity:\n\u201cwhat is called \u2018human dignity\u2019 may simply\nbe the recognizable capacity to assert claims\u201d (1970\n[1980: 151]). Admittedly, Feinberg does not unpack the point. And it\nis not perfectly clear if authority per se is part of his conception\nof this \u201ccapacity\u201d. Still, the point seems to resonate\nwith claim [2], especially if we pair Feinberg\u2019s point with\nDarwall\u2019s views about second-personal authority, considered\nearlier. Indeed, Meyer (1989) tries to unpack Feinberg in a way that\nseems to anticipate Darwall\u2019s view. (See also, Forst 2011, who\noffers a similar line of argument to Darwall, which he credits partly\nto Ernst Bloch. But see Sangiovanni 2017, who objects to both Darwall\nand Forst, esp. pp. 50\u201360).\n2.3 Are distinctiveness and fragility defining properties of dignity?\n\nIt is possible to take an even wider view on the defining criteria of\ndignity. For example, consider Etinson (2020), who represents another\ncase of conscientious second-order theorizing. Etinson argues that a\ncomplete theory of dignity should explain not only what\n\u201cgrounds\u201d dignity\u2014\u201cthat is, how and why one\ncomes to possess or lose it\u201d\u2014but also its\n\u201cproper\u201d method\u2014that is, \u201chow inquiry into all\nof this should proceed and be understood\u201d (2020: 356). The\nlatter demand is akin to calling for an articulation of the defining\nproperties of dignity, in the sense that we have been discussing.\nHowever, Etinson adds an important substantive claim about this\nmethod: He agrees that dignity is partly distinguished by something\nlike a distinctive \u201cnormative function\u201d, but sharpens this\nclaim by suggesting that to explain this function, we should focus\nspecifically on the conditions of dignity\u2019s violation. This\nrefinement is important for two broad reasons.\n\nFirst, over its long history, inquiry into human dignity has often\nbeen conjoined with considerations of what it means to harm dignity:\nWhat constitutes disrespect of dignity? Can we lose it? Can it be\ndestroyed? And so on. Call this, the question of dignity\u2019s\n\u201cfragility\u201d. Sometimes, this question is taken up within a\ndirect examination of dignity (see, e.g., Kaplan 1999 or Dussel\n2003). At other times, the motivation is pragmatic. For example, in\nhis reflection on legal appeals to dignity, Schacter (1983)\nwrites:\n\n\nWhen [dignity] has been invoked in concrete situations, it has been\ngenerally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized\neven if the abstract term cannot be defined. \u201cI know it when I\nsee it even if I cannot tell you what it is\u201d. (1983: 849)\n\n\nAnd in some cases, these reflections go the other way around; that is,\nfrom an analysis of a specific kind of dehumanizing harm\n(slavery, torture, rape, genocide; alienation, humiliation,\nembarrassment) to dignity, or one of its close cognates like\n\u201chumanity\u201d (see especially, Neuh\u00e4user 2011; Morawa\n2013; Haslam 2014; Frick 2021; Mikkola\n 2021).[5]\n\nBut whatever the context, it is crucial to distinguish between\nfirst-order encounters with dignity\u2019s fragility, and\nsecond-order efforts that try to draw a connection between a negative\nmethodology centered on the question of fragility and the positive\neffort to articulate the defining properties of dignity. It is the\nlatter claim that Etinson makes, illustrated in the following incisive\npoint:\n\n\nNot all moral wrongs convincingly register as violations of human\ndignity\u2026And this suggests that dignity is normatively\nspecial\u2014that its violation represents a particular type of\nwrong. (2020: 357)\n\n\nEssentially, Etinson is arguing that (1) we should add to the defining\nproperties of dignity, that the value or status \u201cdignity\u201d\npicks out is in some sense \u201cnormatively distinctive\u201d; and\n(2) in order to articulate (positively) what makes it distinctive, we\nmust investigate (negatively) what it means to harm it. Thus, for\nEtinson, dignity does not simply have the normative function to\n\u201cset off\u201d the special status of humans in our practical\ndeliberations; it sets off humans in a special way. And this\n\u201cway\u201d can only be understood through a consideration of\ndignity\u2019s fragility.\n\nThe second reason for underlining this kind of negative methodology\ncomes from Killmister (2020), who also makes second-order claims about\nthe proper method for theorizing dignity. On her view, all the primary\nsenses of dignity in the general schema can be harmed in some way or\nother. Each can be injured, lowered, embarrassed, humiliated,\nthreatened, frustrated, even destroyed. Correspondingly, it is a\ncriterion of any satisfactory theory, that it explains the nature and\nconditions of dignity\u2019s fragility in all its primary\nsenses\n (categories 1\u20134\n in the general schema).\n\nThe emphasis on \u201call\u201d is important. Killmister\u2019s\ntheory stands out for being an attempt to use the criterion of\nfragility to offer a unified theory of dignity. And this raises a\nquestion beyond whether fragility is a defining property of dignity.\nNamely, for any given theory of dignity, does it purport to theorize\ndignity in general, or human dignity in particular? Most\nliterature bearing the term \u201cdignity\u201d in its title will\nsay at some point that it is really or mostly about human dignity. But\nif so, then are such theories in some sense incomplete? Must a\ncomplete theory of human dignity\n (category 4\n in the general schema) reconcile itself with the other primary senses\nof the term\n (categories 1\u20133),\n as Killmister implores?\n\nThe next section attempts to offer some footholds for answering these\nnew questions. But there is one more point to make here, because it is\npertinent to second-order questions about how to formulate dignity.\nPart of what motivates Killmister\u2019s effort at a unified theory\nis an attending argument that theories of dignity should fit with\neveryday ways of speaking about dignity. And everyday talk of dignity,\nshe argues, often refers to the other primary senses of dignity in the\ngeneral schema. Moreover, she claims that all these ways of talking\nare connected by the fragility criterion, as well as some of the other\ndefining criteria we have discussed, especially (A) the idea of a\nnormative function and (B) an essential connection to respect.\nFinally, she treats this \u201cfit\u201d between her account of the\ndefining properties of dignity and everyday talk about dignity as\nimportant evidence for the correctness of her own criteria. Nor is she\nalone in staking evidentiary value on fitness to everyday language.\nFor example, Bird (2013) and Etinson (2020) make similar\n arguments.[6]\n Do we agree? Surely, a good theory of dignity will not run roughshod\nover everyday usage. Still, exactly how beholden should a theory\nbe?\n3. Human Dignity: Touchstones of Analysis\n\nThe conclusion of the last section raised the following question about\nthe conceptual landscape of dignity research: Which of the many points\nbeing made are relevant to theorizing dignity in general, and which\npertain specifically to human dignity? To answer this question, it\nwill help to distill a few enduring themes that characterize the\ndebate over specifically human dignity. These are hardly all the\nthemes that could be identified. Also, because each theme has been\nintroduced in one way or other already, the following is intentionally\ncondensed, with the understanding that any of these leads could be\nfollowed into a forest of nuance.\n3.1 Virtue, Value, Status, and the \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d point reconsidered\n\nOne could take all the existing literature on human dignity and\narrange it into three groups, depending on whether any given argument\nrenders dignity as a kind of (i) virtue or quality of character; (ii)\nvalue or worth; or (iii) status or standing. Our analysis already laid\nout the most important aspects in deciding between these\nclassifications. We also noted that the trend in secular accounts is\nto articulate dignity as a kind of status rather than as a virtue or\nvalue. To this it should be added that virtue accounts make up the\nminority of all modern positions, no doubt because most contemporary\npositions eschew the hierarchical drift that comes with tying dignity\nto virtue.\n\nPerhaps less obvious in the literature, is the agreement to articulate\nwhat is distinctive about dignity, regardless of which way it is\nrendered: virtue, value, or status. This \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d\npoint is pressing, given Etinson\u2019s (2020) argument that a\nnegative analysis of dignity\u2019s fragility is crucial to\nunderstanding what is \u201cspecial\u201d about dignity as a\nnormative concept. On his view, a good theory of dignity will pick out\na \u201cmeaningful distinct set of concerns\u201d (2020: 354), if it\nis to justify using the term at all. The force of this point extends\nbeyond the question of whether fragility is a defining property of\ndignity. But to appreciate fully why, we need to contextualize it. So,\nconsider the following:\n\nThe idea that human beings are morally special or distinctive has\nfound expression in the religion, philosophy, literature, and art of\nall societies, modern and ancient. And connected to that idea and\nthose expressions is an enduring struggle to understand what this\npeculiar \u201cvalue\u201d is. Since antiquity many have leveraged\nthis idea about human distinctiveness into the idea that humans are\nsupremely valuable. The chorus in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone (c. 441 BCE), for example, lauds man as the most\n\u201cwondrous\u201d of all things in the world, a prodigy who cuts\nthrough the natural world the way a sailor cuts through the\n\u201cperilous\u201d surging seas that threaten to engulf him\n(verses 332 ff., cited in Debes 2009 at p. 52). Similarly, the\nJudeo-Christian doctrine of imago Dei trumpets human dominion\nover the earth and the distinctive value of humanity. Excluding God\nand angels, the doctrine implies that humankind is preeminently\nvaluable.\n\nAdmittedly, these are not references to theory, strictly speaking.\nHowever, the historical development of dignity has long been tangled\nup with this kind of widespread attempt to explain human\ndistinctiveness, even if only implicitly or under cognate terms like\n\u201cuniqueness\u201d (e.g., Muray 2007 and Rolston 2008). Indeed,\none might say that the most basic point of the concept of\ndignity, especially as it was molded into the category of \u201chuman\ndignity\u201d, just is to describe the distinctive virtue, value, or\nstatus of humans. From Cicero\u2019s ancient claim about the special\nworth of the \u201chuman race\u201d; to Schacter\u2019s (1983)\nanti-Waldron argument that dignity\u2019s importance outside of legal\ncontexts highlights the need \u201cto treat it as a distinct\nsubject\u201d (1983: 854); to Iglesias\u2019s (2001) attempt to\nexplain our \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d as human beings; to\nKateb\u2019s (2011) claim that human dignity involves the unique role\nhumans have as \u201cstewards\u201d of the earth\u2014in all these\narguments the distinctiveness point is in play. Or consider Simone\nWeil, writing in the shadow of World War II, and who inspired\nIglesias:\n\n\nThere is something sacred in every man, but it is not his person. Nor\nyet is it the human personality. It is this man; no more nor\nless\u2026 The whole of him. The arms, the eyes, the thoughts,\neverything. Not without infinite scruple would I touch anything of\nthis. (first published 1957 [1986: 50\u201351])\n\n\nSimilarly, Malpas (2007) explicitly argues that insofar as we are\ninvestigating human dignity, it seems we are inquiring into what is\ndistinctively valuable about \u201cbeing\u201d human, by which he\nmeans something like the experience of being human.\n\nThis said, we must understand Etinson as arguing that it is not enough\nto claim that what explains the moral distinctiveness of humans is\ntheir \u201cdignity\u201d. We have to say what about human dignity\nitself is distinctive. And we must do so in a way that would\nsubstantiate (in part or in whole) the more general claim of human\ndistinctiveness. After all, Etinson argues, not all kinds of harms to\nhumans count as harms to their human dignity. Not even all harms to\ntheir status are obviously harms to their human dignity. Slapping\nsomeone in the face is certainly an affront to their status in some\nsense, and perhaps even necessarily to their social-status dignity\n ((3)\n in the general schema), but not necessarily to their human\ndignity\n ((4)\n in the general schema). (See also, Valentini 2017.)\n\nSo, what is distinctive about human dignity itself? There is more than\none way to answer this question. Etinson\u2019s own suggestion, as we\nhave seen, is to use a negative normative lens to articulate what\nkinds of harms to humans count distinctively as harms against their\ndignity. But rather than tracing out further particular answers to\nthis question, let us note a few final general observations about the\ndistinctiveness point.\n\nFirst, most theorists of dignity do not explicitly parse out the need\nto explain the distinctiveness of dignity itself, as contrasted with\nhuman distinctiveness in general. However, I submit that explaining\nthe distinctiveness of dignity (itself) is often part of what\nmany theorists take themselves to be doing, however indirectly. In\nother words, explaining dignity\u2019s \u201cdistinct set of\nconcerns\u201d, to use Etinson\u2019s phrase, seems to be\nconstitutive of many theories of dignity. There is no space to\nsubstantiate this contention here, but we risk losing valuable\ninsights about dignity\u2019s distinctiveness if we don\u2019t take\nthis charitable approach.\n\nSecond, it is important not to run together the normative upshot of\nany claim about the grounds of dignity, with a\ndefinitional point about dignity\u2019s distinctiveness. For\nexample, if one thinks humans have dignity in virtue of their rational\nagency, then in one sense, this will entail a kind of\ndistinctiveness. For, it will necessarily inform the substance of\nwhatever rights or duties we think dignity justifies. In other words,\nthe content of such rights and duties will need to be\n\u201cdistinctively\u201d tied to rational agency, and what it means\nto protect, harm, or nurture this agency. Likewise for any other\ncandidate account of dignity\u2019s grounds. Nevertheless, this is\ndifferent than talking about distinctiveness as a defining property of\nhuman dignity. Scholars like Etinson and Killmister are trying to\narticulate the distinctive normative function that defines\ndignity, regardless of its grounds\u2014indeed, which any\nsatisfactory account of dignity\u2019s grounds must be able to\nexplain.\n\nFinally, Debes (2009) adds the following qualification to the\n\u201cdistinctiveness\u201d point:\n\n\nA proper account of dignity must pick out a distinctive value\nbelonging to humans. This is not equivalent to demanding a value that\nbelongs distinctively to humans.\n\n\nThe latter demand (which some theorists do insist on), not only\narbitrarily rules out a shared space of dignity between different\nentities but also risks ruling out the best options for\ndignity\u2019s grounds:\n\n\nFor example, if rationality should after all turn out to be the most\ndefensible basis for a theory of human dignity, we [humans]\nwouldn\u2019t want to yield it simply because we discovered that\nchimps and whales were rational or that Martians really have been\ntrying to communicate with us for millennia. (2009: 61).\n\n3.2 Individuals vs. species\n\nThe conclusion of the last section brings to mind another theoretical\ndividing line in the literature, between those arguing for human\ndignity qua human individual, and those arguing for human\ndignity qua species. Which is it?\n\nSome say, both. For example, Kateb (2011) argues that we must explain\nthe uniqueness of persons and the species: \u201cI am what\nno one else is, while not existentially superior to anyone else; we\nhuman beings belong to a species that is what no other species\nis\u201d (2011: 17). According to Kateb (echoing Cicero), humans are\npartly divorced from the natural order both individually and\ncollectively, in virtue of possessing unparalleled and morally special\ncapacities for self-creation. Moreover, Kateb is clear that the\ndistinctiveness of human dignity also grounds human normative\nsupremacy. Indeed, on his view, human supremacy is one of the defining\nproperties of dignity: \u201cThe core idea of human dignity is that\non earth, humanity is the greatest type of being\u201d (2011:\n3\u20134); we are \u201cthe highest species on earth\u2014so\nfar\u201d (2011: 17).\n\nOf course, such claims are contentious. But if we want to engage them,\nit is important to be clear about whether we are doing so at the\ndefinitional level, or at the level of dignity\u2019s grounds. For\nexample, recall Cicero\u2019s claim that it is in virtue of our\ndistinctive capacities for self-development \u201cby study and\nreflection\u201d, that human beings have a \u201csuperior\u201d\n\u201cnature\u201d to that of \u201ccattle and other\nanimals\u201d. This Ciceronian idea about the grounds of dignity\nshares affinities with many other extant views, including Kant, Pico,\nand obviously Kateb. And we have considered reasons for rejecting this\nline of argument. But even if one accepts it, the present point is\nthat one might not endorse Kateb\u2019s claim about the\n\u201ccore idea\u201d of dignity being essentially about the human\nspecies. That is, one could agree with Kateb about what grounds\ndignity but disagree that part of what defines dignity, is the\nproperty of species superiority. Stern (1975) and Gaylin (1984), for\nexample, agree that the concept of dignity is most essentially about\nhuman worth or status, but argue that this does not imply that the\nhuman species possesses dignity. It only implies that each\nindividual human has dignity.\n\nFinally, any claim about the dignity of the species or collective\nhumanity must confront worries about speciesism, and in turn all the\nobjections of those who think that non-human animals have a purchase\non the normative space of dignity (see, e.g., Rachels 1990; Pluhar\n1995; LaFollette & Shanks 1996; Bekoff 1998; Meyer 2001; Rolston\n2008; Singer 2009; and especially Gruen 2003 [2010], who explores the\nidea of \u201cwild dignity\u201d.)\n3.3 Inherent vs. constructed\n\nIt is common to talk of human dignity as \u201cinherent\u201d. What\nthis means, however, is often unclear. Sometimes it is redescribed to\nmean \u201cintrinsic\u201d, other times \u201cinalienable\u201d.\nIt is also often conjoined with claims that dignity is\n\u201cinviolable\u201d\u2014although this is dubious if\ninviolability is supposed to be entailed by inherentness.\nAfter all, one might agree that human dignity cannot be entirely\ndestroyed because dignity is inherent, but nevertheless allow that\nhuman dignity can be harmed, insulted, frustrated, and humiliated.\n\nThis is not to suggest that all that is inherent is indestructible.\nWhether human dignity can really be destroyed depends entirely on why\none thinks human dignity is inherent. If one thinks that human dignity\nis inherent because we have dignity in virtue of possessing a soul,\nthen they probably do not think dignity can be truly destroyed\n(although they may think it can be degraded; or even, if they\nsubscribe to Christian dogma, that it was in fact degraded by the\n\u201cfall\u201d from grace). On the other hand, if one thinks that\nhuman dignity is inherent because we have dignity in virtue of our\ncapacities for rational agency, then they probably do think dignity\ncan be lost or destroyed, whether by extreme psychological trauma or a\nsharp blow to the head.\n\nIt must also be reiterated that secular theorists of dignity have\nincreasingly turned away from \u201cinherentness\u201d as a defining\nproperty of dignity (see, e.g., Darwall 2006; Debes 2009; Kateb 2011;\nRosen 2012a; Waldron 2012; Valentini 2017; Killmister 2020). The\nreasons for doing so vary. Most reflect suspicion about the\nmetaphysical baggage, especially of the theological kind, that\nhistorically has gone hand in hand with inherentness claims. But there\nare often other reasons. For example, for those that think human\ndignity is defined by the authority or standing to hold others\nresponsible with second-personal claims, dignity only comes into\nexistence within actual second-personal encounters (see, e.g., Meyer\n1989, Darwall 2006, Forst 2011, and perhaps Feinberg 1970 [1980]). Or\nrecall Valentini, who argues that the problem with the metaphysical\nclaims needed to back up inherentness is not simply that they are\n\u201cheavy\u201d, but that they distract us from the core political\nfunction of rights. Meanwhile, for those committed to a negative\nmethodology, like Killmister or Etinson, the starting assumption is\nthat dignity can be destroyed. And while this does not entail\nthat dignity is not inherent, Killmister persuasively argues that such\nfragility strongly tells against inherentness.\n\nAll this raises the question: If not inherent, then what? The simple\nanswer is that on many theories dignity is socially constructed. Of\ncourse, there are many theories about what it means for something to\nbe socially constructed, with many important differences between them.\nThere is, for example, a chasm of difference between claiming that\ndignity is constructed as a constitutive part of second-personal\nrelationships (\u00e0 la Darwall or Forst) and claiming\nthat it is constructed through the transformation of an old idea about\n\u201celevated rank\u201d (\u00e0 la Appiah or Waldron).\nSo, the simple answer must be turned into a complicated one, which we\ncannot do here.\n3.4 Respect: An alternative lens on dignity\n\nA complete theory of human dignity must articulate the demands that\ndignity places on us, morally and politically. Some theories, as we\nhave seen, build this expectation into the defining properties of\ndignity. But even when they do not, there is almost always some\nappeal, positive or negative, to some claim about what it means to\nrecognize dignity, and most often to some claim about\nrespect\u2014which, furthermore, is usually claimed to be\nboth what dignity demands and what it means to recognize dignity. The\nsubject of respect, however, is its own labyrinth. It boasts an array\nof meanings, diverse applications, and extensive commentary. This\nsaid, two very general points about respect stand out in connection to\nhuman dignity.\n\nFirst, the connection between dignity and respect has been made\nconcrete in various political contexts. For example, Schachter (1983)\nnotes that Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights provides that,\n\n\nall persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity\nand with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. (1983:\n848)\n\n\nHe marks a similar provision in Article 5 of the American\nConvention on Human Rights (Ibid). And this connection generates\ndistinct challenges in the political context that reach beyond the\nhuman rights discourse. Schachter explains:\n\n\nIn the political context, respect for the dignity and worth of all\npersons, and for their individual choices, leads, broadly speaking, to\na strong emphasis on the will and consent of the governed. It means\nthat the coercive rule of one or the few over the many is incompatible\nwith a due respect for the dignity of the person. (1983: 850)\n\n\nHowever, Schachter further points out, many political theories\ncontend,\n\n\nthat substantial equality is a necessary condition of respect for the\nintrinsic worth of the human person\u2026In particular, relations of\ndominance and subordination would be viewed as antithetical to the\nbasic ideal [of human dignity]. If this is so, great discrepancies in\nwealth and power need to be eliminated to avoid such relations.\n(ibid)\n\n\nThe question thus becomes, how can we achieve such egalitarian\nobjectives, without the kind of \u201cexcessive curtailment of\nindividual liberty and the use of coercion\u201d that human dignity\nis also thought to eschew (1983: 850)? This question figures\ninto some of history\u2019s most influential political theories, from\nHegel to Rawls. (For an inroad to understanding the Hegelian line, see\nHonneth 2007; for the Rawlsian line, see Bird 2021.)\n\nSecond, as already hinted, the introduction of respect raises its own\ndistinctive challenge, namely, to explain what respect is. To do this,\nmany theorists appeal, explicitly or implicitly, to what we earlier\ncalled \u201crecognition respect\u201d. When we make plans or choose\nto act, we recognize-respect others when we appropriately take account\nof some fact about them, by adapting, revising, or even foregoing our\nplans and choices in the light of that fact. So, which\n\u201cfact\u201d? Well, if we are talking about respecting persons\nas persons, in a moral sense, many theorists have answered\nthat human dignity is the operative fact. Or, if they drill\ndown further, then whatever they end up defending as the\ngrounds of human dignity\u2014whether rational autonomy,\nspecies membership, an immortal soul, etc.\u2014is the relevant\n fact.[7]\n\nHowever, the last few decades have witnessed a wave of new theorizing\nabout respect. And this has consequences for theorizing about human\ndignity. The most notable consequence stems from the field of care\nethics, where empathy, compassion, and caring have been conceived as\ndistinct kinds of respect. Thus, although human dignity did not figure\nexplicitly into early formulations of care ethics, as conceived by\nthose like Noddings (1984) or Held (2006), care ethics has\nincreasingly been developed in ways that does bring dignity to the\nfore, e.g., by those like Dillon (1992), Kittay (2005 and 2011), and\nMiller (2012). Dillon, in particular, gives voice to a profound\nalternative to rationalist paradigms of human dignity, noted\nfrequently in this entry, and associated especially with Kant. She\nwrites:\n\n\n[Care respect] grounds respect for persons in something which,\nconsidered in the abstract, nearly all human beings have and can be\nsaid to have equally - the characteristic of being an individual human\n\u201cme\u201d - a characteristic which each of us values and thinks\nis both morally important and profoundly morally problematic not only\nin others but in ourselves as well, and which pulls our attention to\nthe concrete particularities of each human individual. We are, on the\ncare respect approach, to pay attention not only to the fact that\nsomeone is a \u201cme\u201d but also to which particular\n\u201cme\u201d she is. (Dillon 1992: 118)\n\n\nThe core idea Dillon expresses here about the grounds of dignity\nqua the concrete \u201cparticularity\u201d of an individual\nperson (as she puts it on 1992: 115), traces to Iris Murdoch (1970)\nand Elizabeth Spelman (1978). It also resonates with the thinking of\nSimon Weil, noted above in\n \u00a73.2.\n More generally, Dillon\u2019s argument illustrates how taking the\nconcept of respect as our starting point might lead to very different\nviews about human dignity.\n4. Skeptical Worries\n\nThe conceptual complexity surrounding dignity has sparked a long\nhistory of disagreement about the utility of the concept, with some\nconcluding that it is hopelessly messy or essentially ambiguous. One\nof the more cited versions comes from the Yale bioethicist Ruth\nMacklin, who made this complaint in a widely read 2003 editorial.\n\u201cDignity\u201d, she asserted, \u201cis a useless concept. It\nmeans no more than respect for persons or their autonomy\u201d (2003:\n1419).\n\nMacklin\u2019s claim was not backed by much argument. And judging by\nthe literature, her complaint did nothing to slow down the application\nof dignity in bioethics, where it is now discussed in the context of\neverything from disability studies, elderly care, human research,\ncloning, \u201cchimeras\u201d, enhancement, transhumanism, and\neuthanasia (see the bibliography for leads to each of these). Still,\none does not have to look hard to find Macklin\u2019s allies.\n\nFor example, Rosen (2012a) claims that \u201canimus against dignity\nis widely shared among philosophers, in my experience, and goes back a\nlong way\u201d (2012a: 143). He buttresses his claim by recounting\nthe encouragement of a colleague to give the concept \u201ca good\nkicking\u201d, and by quoting his favorite historical challenges by\nSchopenhauer and Nietzsche, the former of whom called dignity,\n\u201cthe shibboleth of all the perplexed and empty-headed\nmoralists\u201d (1840 [1965: 100] cited in Rosen 2013: 143).\nImportantly, however, for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, the problem\nwasn\u2019t simply the ambiguity of the concept. They thought that\nthe moralized notion of inherent or distinctive human worth garners\nwidespread credence only because it flatters our pride and allows us\nto slip into self-deceptive moral complacency. This deflationary\nhypothesis strikes at the heart of our modern dignitarian ethos.\n\nSo, exactly how widespread is skepticism of dignity? There is no\nsimple answer to this question because it depends greatly on what one\ntakes dignity to be. Even defenders of one conception of dignity often\nexpress skepticism about other conceptions. For example, we already\nnoted the trend away from thick metaphysical claims about dignity,\nwhich make dignity depend on anything like a divinely implanted\n\u201csoul\u201d or Kant\u2019s \u201cnoumenal\u201d idea of the\nself. Rosen calls such views, \u201cinternal kernel\u201d theories,\nand further notes that reservations about these views are often both\nmetaphysical (no such thing exists) and epistemological (we cannot\njustify our belief in such things). The present point, however, is\nthat if one\u2019s skepticism about human dignity in general turns on\nthe specific reservation about internal kernel theories, then one\nshould stay open minded. For, as we have seen, there are many\nalternatives for theorizing dignity that do not depend on such\nmetaphysical commitments.\n\nStill, because there is more than one way to interpret\nSchopenhauer\u2019s claim that dignity is a \u201cshibboleth\u201d,\nit may prove helpful to trace out a little further a few possible\nskeptical lines of argument, albeit briefly. So, here are four ways\nskepticism tends to play out in the existing literature:\n\nRosen suggests that Schopenhauer\u2019s main complaint\nis that \u201cdignity\u201d is an impressive\n\u201cfa\u00e7ade\u201d obscuring the harsh reality behind the\nidea, namely, that the concept lacks the substance to do the work we\nassign to it. More exactly, dignity cannot serve as a foundation for\nmorality, including, serving as the normative basis of rights (Rosen\n2012a: 143). We encountered this line of thinking already in the\nearlier discussion of the connection between dignity and rights.\nEssentially, the complaint is that no extant account of the\ngrounds of dignity (e.g., Kantian rationalist arguments,\nJudeo-Christian imago Dei arguments, etc.) can satisfactorily\nexplain and justify the kind of normative work dignity is supposed to\ndo. See especially, Sangiovanni 2017, who rejects Aristotelian,\nKantian, and imago Dei accounts of dignity as insufficient\nfor the tasks dignity is typically set to, including grounding\nrights.\n\n\nA related but distinctively different way of taking\nSchopenhauer\u2019s objection, is the worry that dignity has been\npolitically manipulated to capitalize on its deceptive\npotential. As Rosen notes, the general point here is not new.\n\u201cThe idea that illusions are essential to the political\norder\u201d, he writes, \u201cruns through the Western tradition of\npolitical thought from Plato\u201d (2012a: 144). However, Rosen\nsuggests that Nietzsche gets the credit for understanding how powerful\nan illusion human dignity, specifically, can be, for such political\npurpose. \u201cSuch phantoms as the dignity of man\u201d, Nietzsche\nwrites,\n\n\nare the needy products of slavedom hiding itself from itself. Woeful\ntime, in which the slave requires such conceptions, in which he is\nincited to think about and beyond himself! (from \u201cThe Greek\nState\u201d, 1871; quoted in Rosen 2012a: 144)\n\n\nIn fact, this skeptical line goes back further than Rosen seems to\nappreciate. Thus, in his 1714, Fable of the Bees, Bernard\nMandeville essentially made the same argument. Speaking conjecturally\nabout the origins of morality, Mandeville writes:\n\n\nMaking use of this bewitching Engine [of flattery], [the Politicians]\nextoll\u2019d the excellency of our Nature above other\nAnimals\u2026Which being done, they laid before them how unbecoming\nit was the Dignity of such sublime Creatures to be solicitous about\ngratifying those Appetites, which they had in common with Brutes, and\nat the same time unmindful of those higher Qualities that gave them\nthe preeminence over all visible Beings. (1714 [1988: 43])\n \nDignity is vacuous. Bracketing any worries about how any\ngiven political institution manipulates the idea of dignity to achieve\nits ends, or how human pride might capitalize on the idea of dignity\nto facilitate self-deception about our personal moral failings,\nperhaps the idea of dignity is simply unnecessary. For example,\nconsider the first sentence of Article One of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights: \u201cAll human beings are born\nfree and equal in dignity and rights\u201d. What would be lost, Rosen\nasks, \u201cif one were just to say, \u2018All human beings are born\nfree and equal in rights\u2019?\u201d (2012a: 149). A slightly\ndifferent version of this complaint is that, because of its\nvacuousness, dignity has become mere dogma. For example, in the legal\ncontext, Theoder Heuss, called dignity a \u201cnon-interpreted\nthesis\u201d in law. And Costas Douzinas argued dignity was an empty\nplaceholder in a \u201chegemonic battle\u201d of competing legal\nideologies (see also, McCrudden 2013a for some analysis of both; also,\nBargaric & Allan 2006).\nDignity is ambiguous. The thrust of this frequent\ncomplaint is that dignity has become a useless concept, not so much\nbecause it is empty, but because it has too many meanings. (A few have\neven claimed that the concept is \u201cessentially\u201d ambiguous,\nthough it is not clear what this is supposed to mean; see, e.g.,\nShultziner 2007 or Rotenstreich 1983.) When focused, this worry comes\nin three forms:\n\nthe ambiguity of meaning makes \u201cdignity\u201d\nincomprehensible;\nthe ambiguity of meaning makes \u201cdignity\u201d susceptible\nto abuse;\nthe ambiguity of meaning conceals objectionable subjective opinion\nor substantive baggage in the concept of \u201cdignity\u201d.\n \n\n\nExamples of all these positions can easily be found. But perhaps the\nbest illustrations once again come from the legal context. Regarding\n (1):\n see, e.g., Bates (2005), who acknowledges the problem but then tries\nto defend dignity. Regarding\n (2):\n see, e.g., Gearty (2014) and Moyn (2013), who argue that the\ncontinuing ambiguity of dignity make it too easily abused in courtroom\ndeliberation and democratic theories of rights. Regarding\n (3):\n see Pinker (2008), who argues that dignity is a subjective\nphenomenon, \u201crelative, fungible, and often harmful\u201d; also\nRosen (2012a) and Moyn (2013), both of whom argue that our modern\nconcept labors under underappreciated debts to Christian theology;\n\nThese are not all the possible reasons for skepticism about dignity,\nonly the most prevalent. And each is usually sharpened in various ways\nthat make the argument cut deeper than what this summary suggests.\nThis said, the merits of these critiques are disputable. Indeed, much\nof the foregoing analysis in this entry suggests strategies of\nresponse to each.\n\nBut perhaps the most fitting way to conclude is with a different kind\nof question entirely. Namely, how ought we respond to such\nskeptical attacks, if at all? Thus, it is hard not to think of\nFrederick Douglass\u2019s warning, delivered in his 1852\n\u201cFourth of July\u201d speech, about the dangers of demanding of\nanyone, that they argue for their equal and basic human worth\nor status\u2014especially when so many people remain not simply\noppressed, but exposed to vitriolic hate in a world that constantly\nproclaims its faith and commitment in the ideal of human dignity.\n\u201cAt a time like this\u201d, Douglass said, \u201cscorching\nirony, not convincing argument, is needed\u201d (1852: 20).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Addis, Adeno, 2013, \u201cThe Role of Human Dignity in a World of\nPlural Values and Ethical Commitments\u201d, <em>Netherlands\nQuarterly of Human Rights</em>, 31(4): 403\u2013444.\ndoi:10.1177/016934411303100403", "Ammicht-Quinn, Regina, Maureen Junker-Kenny, and Elsa Tamez (eds),\n2003, <em>The Discourse of Human Dignity</em>, (Concilium 2003/2),\nLondon: SCM Press.", "Annas, George J., 2004, \u201cAmerican Bioethics and Human\nRights: The End of All Our Exploring\u201d, <em>Journal of Law,\nMedicine &amp; Ethics</em>, 32(4): 658\u2013663.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1748-720X.2004.tb01970.x", "Appiah, Anthony, 2010, <em>The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions\nHappen</em>, New York: W.W.
