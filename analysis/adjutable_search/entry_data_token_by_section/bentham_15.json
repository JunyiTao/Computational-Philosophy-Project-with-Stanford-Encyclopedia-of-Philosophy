It is imperative, therefore, to devise\nmechanisms that will ensure that only by acting in the public interest\ncould they promote their own interests. So, for example, under\nrepresentative democracy the members of the legislature, as the\nrepresentatives of the \u201cconstitutive power\u201d of the people,\ncould be counted on to promote the greatest happiness and hold other\nfunctionaries to account, since elected legislators only serve at the\nwill of their constituents and risk not being re-elected if they fail\nto do their duty (Schofield 1996, 226\u201328; see also Lieberman\n2008). Given the extensive powers Bentham envisaged the thirteen\nministries of the reformed government would possess\u2014far more\npower in the areas of public health, education, and relief of the poor\nand indigent than existed at the time\u2014further safeguards would\nbe required. Refining and expanding the suggestions contained in his\nPlan of Parliamentary Reform, he stipulated that public\nofficials must possess the required \u201cmoral aptitude\u201d (the\ndisposition to promote the greatest happiness), \u201cintellectual\naptitude\u201d (divided into scientific aptitude or knowledge, and\njudicial aptitude or judgement), and \u201cactive aptitude\u201d\n(the conscientious performance of assigned responsibilities) (1990,\n272). Intellectual and active aptitude were to be tested through an\nexamination process, though this would come to naught if the appointed\nofficial did not possess the appropriate moral aptitude\n(1838\u201343, IX, 128). Other devices designed to ensure, encourage,\nand test the required aptitude of public officials include: (1) the\nprecise definition of responsibilities attached to each office,\nagainst which the actions of officials could be judged by either a\nsuperordinate official or the public; (2) the principle of\nsubordination, according to which every official was subordinate to\nanother who could punish him for inefficiency in the performance of\nhis tasks; (3) complete exposure to legal prosecution of all officials\nfor wrong-doing; (4) the elimination of the practice of handing out\nunwarranted titles of honour to party supporters and other favourites;\n(5) complete publicity of government business and the elimination of\nsecrecy; and (6) freedom of the press, speech and association (see\nRosen 1983, Ch. 8).\n",
