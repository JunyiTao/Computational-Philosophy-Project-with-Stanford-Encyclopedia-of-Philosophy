Social or political climate\ncontributes to how (un)trustworthy people tend to be and therefore to\nwhether trust and distrust are justified. For example, a climate of\nvirtue is one in which trustworthiness tends to be pervasive, assuming\nthat virtues other than trustworthiness tend to enhance it (Baier\n 2004).[13]\n A climate of oppression is one in which untrustworthiness is\nprevalent, especially between people who are privileged and those who\nare less privileged (Baier 1986: 259; Potter 2002: 24; D\u2019Cruz\n2019). \u201cSocial trust\u201d, as some call it, is low in these\ncircumstances (Govier 1997; Welch 2013).\n\nSocial or political climate has a significant influence on the default\nstance that we ought to take toward people\u2019s trustworthiness\n(see, e.g., Walker 2006). We need such a stance because we can\u2019t\nalways stop to reflect carefully on when to trust (i.e., assuming that\nsome rational reflection is required for trusting well). Some\nphilosophers say that the correct stance is trust and do so without\nreferring to the social or political climate; Tony Coady takes this\nsort of position, for example, on our stance toward others\u2019\ntestimony (Coady 1992). Others disagree that the correct stance could\nbe so universal and claim instead that it is relative to climate, as\nwell as to other factors such as domain (Jones 1999).\n\nOur trust or distrust may be prima facie justified if we have the\ncorrect default stance, although most philosophers assume that it\ncould only be fully justified (in a truth- or end-directed way) by\nreasons that are internal to us (evidentiary or non-evidentiary\nreasons) or by the causal processes that created the attitude in the\nfirst place. Whichever epistemology of trust we choose, it ought to be\nsensitive to the tension that exists between trusting somebody and\nrationally reflecting on the grounds for that trust. It would be odd,\nto say the least, if what made an attitude justified destroyed that\nvery attitude. At the same time, our epistemology of trust ought to\ncohere as much as possible with common sense, which dictates that we\nshould inspect rather than have pure faith in whatever makes us\nseriously vulnerable to other people, which trust can most definitely\ndo.\n",
