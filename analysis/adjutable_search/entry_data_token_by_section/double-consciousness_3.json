    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk || Color-Line Hegelianism\n2.2 Color-Line Hegelianism\n\nThe first book-length study thematizing Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness was Sandra Adell\u2019s\nDouble-Consciousness/ Double Bind: Theoretical Issues in\nTwentieth-Century Black Literature (1994). Engaging debates over\ntheoretical approaches to Black literature, Adell argues for an\nintertextualism inspired by Derridean deconstruction, and aimed at\ntranscending the \u201cAfrocentric/ Eurocentric\u201d divide. The\nbook begins with a chapter on Du Bois\u2019s \u201cStrivings\u201d\ntext; Adell, following the lead of Joel Williamson\u2019s earlier\narticle, \u201cW.E.B. Du Bois as a Hegelian\u201d (1978), presents\nDu Bois\u2019s text as a reading and use of crucial passages in\nHegel. Du Boisian double-consciousness, she claims, \u201cemerges\nfrom the philosophy of Hegel as it is articulated in the\nPhenomenology of Spirit\u201d (1994: 8). She adduces as\nevidence for the Hegelian reading of Souls Du Bois\u2019s\nstudies with William James and Josiah Royce, references to Hegel in Du\nBois\u2019s Philosophy IV notebook from his time at Harvard, as well\nas his studies with von Trietschke in Berlin \u201c(in the midst of a\n\u2018Hegelian revival\u2019 when he arrived)\u201d (1994: 12).\n\nAdell identifies three \u201cinstances\u201d of the \u201cdoubling\nof consciousness\u201d in Hegel\u2019s text (in the section on\n\u201cSelf-Consciousness\u201d; in \u201cLordship and\nBondage\u201d; and in \u201cThe Unhappy Consciousness\u201d); it is\nthe third of these that, she claims, forms the basic pattern for the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text:\n\nDu Bois\u2019s \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d decontextualizes\nHegel\u2019s \u201cUnhappy Consciousness\u201d \u2026 and opens\nit up to other contexts. In this case, the new context is one upon\nwhich is inscribed the problem of the twentieth century: the problem\nof the color line. (1994: 19)\n\n\nAdell then sketches a reading of the entire text of Souls as\na detailed \u201csociological, psychological, and\nphilosophical\u201d account of \u201cthe Negro\u2019s\nbeing-in-the-world\u201d (1994: 19). Her reading identifies other\nborrowings from German Idealism, noting along the way that\n\nthe title of Du Bois\u2019s text itself, The Souls of Black\nFolk, remarks and reiterates the two concepts \u2013 soul and\nfolk (Volk) \u2013 that are central, not only to\nHerder\u2019s aesthetics, but to that of Hegel as well. (1994: 23)\n\n",
