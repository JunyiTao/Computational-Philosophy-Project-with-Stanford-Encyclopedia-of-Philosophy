    "main_text": "Firms and consumers || Sales\n5.4 Sales\n\nSales are central to business. Perhaps surprisingly, business\nethicists have said relatively little about sales.\n\nAn emerging set of issues concerns refusals to sell. Normally\nbusinesses want to sell their goods and services to everyone. But not\nalways. In 2012, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop declined to\nsell a wedding cake to a same-sex couple because he opposed same-sex\nmarriage on religious grounds. In response, the couple filed a\ncomplaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Should Phillips\nhave sold the wedding cake to the couple? We might say that a\ncommercial transaction is a kind of association, and\npeople\u2014including business owners like Phillips\u2014should be\nfree to associate, or not, with whomever they choose. Or we might say,\nas Phillips did, that his actions were protected by freedom of\nreligion, since they were an expression of his identity, which\nincludes his religious commitments. Alternatively, we might claim that\nPhillips was discriminating against the couple, and his actions were\nwrong for the same reasons discrimination typically is, viz., it\ndenies people opportunities and undermines their dignity (Corvino,\nAnderson, & Girgis 2017).\n\nQuestions can also be raised about the techniques advertisers use to\nsell. These questions are similar to the ones asked about advertising.\nSalespeople are, in a sense, the final advertisers of products to\nconsumers. An early contribution to the ethics of sales is found in\nHolley (1986), who develops a set of obligations for salespeople\nderived from the point of market activity, which he says is to\nefficiently meet people\u2019s needs and wants (cf. Heath 2014). In\nwhat is probably the most sophisticated treatment of the subject,\nCarson (2010) says salespeople have at least the following four\npro tanto duties: (1) provide customers with safety warnings\nand precautions; (2) refrain from lying and deception; (3) fully\nanswer customers\u2019 questions about items; and (4) refrain from\nsteering customers toward purchases that are unsuitable for them,\ngiven their stated needs and desires. Carson justifies (1)\u2014(4)\nby appealing to the golden rule: treat others as you want to be\ntreated. He identifies two other duties that salespeople\nmight have (he is agnostic): (5) do not sell customers\nproducts that you (the salesperson) think are unsuitable for them,\ngiven their needs and desires, without telling customers why you think\nthis; and (6) do not sell customers poor quality or defective\nproducts, without telling them why you think this. For the most part,\n(1)\u2014(4) ask the salesperson not to harm the customer; (5) and\n(6) ask the salesperson to help the customer, in particular, help her\nnot to make foolish mistakes. The broader issue is one of disclosure\n(Holley 1998). How much information we think salespeople are required\nto share with customers may depend on what kind of relationship we\nthink they should have, e.g., to what extent it is adversarial.\n\nFor many products bought and sold in markets, sellers offer an item at\na certain price, and buyers take or leave that price. But in some\ncases there is negotiation over price (and other aspects of the\ntransaction). We see this in the sale of \u201cbig ticket\u201d\nitems such as cars and houses, and in salaries for jobs. While there\nare many ethical issues that arise in negotiation, one issue that has\nreceived special attention is \u201cbluffing\u201d, or deliberately\nmisstating one\u2019s bargaining position. The locus classicus\nfor this discussion is Carr (1968). According to him, bluffing in\nnegotiations is permissible because business has its own distinctive\nset of moral rules and bluffing is permissible according to those\nrules. Carson (2010) agrees that bluffing is permissible in business,\nthough in a more limited range of cases. Carson\u2019s argument\nappeals to self-defense. If you have good reason to believe that your\nadversary in a negotiation is misstating her bargaining position, then\nyou are permitted to misstate yours. A requirement to tell the truth\nin these circumstances would put you at a significant disadvantage\nrelative to your adversary, which you are not required to suffer. An\nimplication of Carson\u2019s view is that you are not permitted to\nmisstate your bargaining position if you do not have good reason to\nbelieve that your adversary is misstating hers.\n",
