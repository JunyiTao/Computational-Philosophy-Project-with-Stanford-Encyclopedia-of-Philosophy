    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nModern philosophical discussions about measurement\u2014spanning from\nthe late nineteenth century to the present day\u2014may be divided\ninto several strands of scholarship. These strands reflect different\nperspectives on the nature of measurement and the conditions that make\nmeasurement possible and reliable. The main strands are mathematical\ntheories of measurement, operationalism, conventionalism, realism,\ninformation-theoretic accounts and model-based accounts. These strands\nof scholarship do not, for the most part, constitute directly\ncompeting views. Instead, they are best understood as highlighting\ndifferent and complementary aspects of measurement. The following is a\nvery rough overview of these perspectives:\n\nMathematical theories of\nmeasurement view measurement as the mapping of qualitative\nempirical relations to relations among numbers (or other mathematical\nentities).\nOperationalists and conventionalists view\nmeasurement as a set of operations that shape the meaning and/or\nregulate the use of a quantity-term.\nRealists view measurement as the estimation of\nmind-independent properties and/or relations.\nInformation-theoretic accounts view measurement\nas the gathering and interpretation of information about a\nsystem.\nModel-based accounts view measurement as the\ncoherent assignment of values to parameters in a theoretical and/or\nstatistical model of a process.\n\n\nThese perspectives are in principle consistent with each other. While\nmathematical theories of measurement deal with the mathematical\nfoundations of measurement scales, operationalism and conventionalism\nare primarily concerned with the semantics of quantity terms, realism\nis concerned with the metaphysical status of measurable quantities,\nand information-theoretic and model-based accounts are concerned with\nthe epistemological aspects of measuring. Nonetheless, the subject\ndomain is not as neatly divided as the list above suggests. Issues\nconcerning the metaphysics, epistemology, semantics and mathematical\nfoundations of measurement are interconnected and often bear on one\nanother. Hence, for example, operationalists and conventionalists have\noften adopted anti-realist views, and proponents of model-based\naccounts have argued against the prevailing empiricist interpretation\nof mathematical theories of measurement. These subtleties will become\nclear in the following discussion.\n\nThe list of strands of scholarship is neither exclusive nor\nexhaustive. It reflects the historical trajectory of the philosophical\ndiscussion thus far, rather than any principled distinction among\ndifferent levels of analysis of measurement. Some philosophical works\non measurement belong to more than one strand, while many other works\ndo not squarely fit either. This is especially the case since the\nearly 2000s, when measurement returned to the forefront of\nphilosophical discussion after several decades of relative neglect.\nThis recent body of scholarship is sometimes called \u201cthe\nepistemology of measurement\u201d, and includes a rich array of works\nthat cannot yet be classified into distinct schools of thought. The\nlast section of this entry will be dedicated to surveying some of\nthese developments.\n",
