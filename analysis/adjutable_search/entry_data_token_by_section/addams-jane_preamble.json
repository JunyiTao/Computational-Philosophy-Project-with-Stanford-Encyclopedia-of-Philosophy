    "main_text": "\n\nJane Addams (1860\u20131935) was an activist, community organizer,\ninternational peace advocate, and social philosopher in the United\nStates during the late 19th century and early 20th century. However,\nthe dynamics of canon formation resulted in her philosophical\nwork being largely ignored until the\n 1990s.[1]\n Addams is best known for her pioneering activism in the social\nsettlement movement\u2014the radical arm of the progressive movement\nwhose adherents so embraced the ideals of progressivism that they\nchose to live as neighbors in oppressed communities to learn from and\nhelp the marginalized members of society. Although her contemporaries\nwidely lauded her activism and accomplishments, commentators typically\nmapped Addams\u2019 work onto conventional gender understandings:\nmale philosophers such as John Dewey, William James, and George\nHerbert Mead were regarded as providing original progressive thought,\nwhile Addams was seen as brilliantly administering their theories.\nRecent work by feminist philosophers and historians has revealed that\nAddams was far more than a competent practitioner. Her dozen published\nbooks, and over 500 articles display a robust intellectual interplay\nbetween experience and reflection in the American pragmatist\ntradition. The near half-century that she lived and worked as the\nleader of the Chicago social settlement, Hull House, allowed her to\nbring her commitment to social improvement, feminism, diversity, and\npeace into reflective practice. These experiences provided the\nfoundation for an engaging philosophical perspective. Addams viewed\nher settlement work as a grand epistemological endeavor, but in the\nprocess, she never forgot her neighbors\u2019 humanity. Addams was a public\nphilosopher who was not afraid to get her hands dirty.\n\nAddams\u2019 philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an\nunwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative\nefforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and\npacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic\nrather than ideological. Addams\u2019 commitment to social cohesion\nand cooperation prompted her to eschew what she perceived as divisive\ndistinctions. Active democratic social progress was so essential to\nAddams that she did not want to alienate any group of people from the\nconversation or the participation necessary for effective inclusive\ndeliberation. Addams carefully varied her rhetorical approach to\nengaging a variety of constituencies, which makes identifying her\nsocial philosophy challenging. Accordingly, Addams did not intend to\nengage in philosophical narratives removed from social improvement,\nnor did she intend to pursue social activism without theorizing about\nthe broader implications of her work. In this respect, through her\nintegration of theory and action, Addams carried pragmatism to its\nlogical conclusion through her integration of theory and action,\ndeveloping an applied philosophy immersed in social action. Thus\nAddams\u2019 writing is replete with examples from her Hull House\nexperience addressing atypical topics for philosophic discourse, such\nas garbage collection, immigrant folk stories, and prostitution. It is\neasy for those steeped in traditional philosophy to dismiss\nAddams\u2019 writings as non-philosophical if the full sweep of her\nprojects and subsequent analysis is not considered. For those who\npersevere, Addams offers a rich social and political philosophy built\non respect and understanding that is refreshing in its faith in the\npotential for collective progress.\n\nIdentifying Jane Addams as a philosopher requires appreciating the\ndynamic between theory and action reflected in her writing.\nFurthermore, Addams was a voracious reader and purveyor of the\nintellectual ideas of her time, such as evolutionary theory.\nTherefore, her writing is nuanced, with references that require a\ncontextual understanding of pertinent ideas of the time. Reading\nAddams, one finds a wellspring of nascent feminist philosophical\ninsight. Addams\u2019 ethical philosophy was guided by the notion of\nsympathetic knowledge that she described as \u201cthe only way of\napproach to any human problem\u201d (NCA 7). Sympathetic knowledge is\na mingling of epistemology and ethics: knowing one another better\nreinforces the common connection of people such that the potential for\ncaring and empathetic moral actions increases. Addams not only\ntheorized about this idea, but she lived it. Sympathetic knowledge\nunderwrote Addams\u2019 approach to the diversity and staggering\npoverty (HHM) that she confronted in the immigrant neighborhood\nsurrounding Hull House and allowed her to develop a precursor to\ncontemporary feminist standpoint epistemology. Addams\u2019\nleadership among the American pragmatists in understanding the poor\nand oppressed resulted in a more radical form of pragmatism than Dewey\nand James, a social philosophy imbued with a class and gender\nconsciousness.\n",
