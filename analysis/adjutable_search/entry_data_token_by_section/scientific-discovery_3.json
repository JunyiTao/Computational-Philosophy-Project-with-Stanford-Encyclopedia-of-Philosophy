Pragmatic logics of discovery\n\nIn the pragmatist tradition, the term \u201clogic\u201d is used in\nthe broad sense to refer to strategies of human reasoning and inquiry.\nWhile the reasoning involved does not proceed according to the\nprinciples of demonstrative logic, it is systematic enough to deserve\nthe label \u201clogical\u201d. Proponents of this view argued that\ntraditional (here: syllogistic) logic is an inadequate model of\nscientific discovery because it misrepresents the process of knowledge\ngeneration as grossly as the notion of an \u201caha\nmoment\u201d.\n\nEarly 20th-century pragmatic logics of discovery can best\nbe described as comprehensive theories of the mental and\nphysical-practical operations involved in knowledge generation, as\ntheories of \u201chow we think\u201d (Dewey 1910). Among the mental\noperations are classification, determination of what is relevant to an\ninquiry, and the conditions of communication of meaning; among the\nphysical operations are observation and (laboratory) experiments.\nThese features of scientific discovery are either not or only\ninsufficiently represented by traditional syllogistic logic (Schiller\n1917: 236\u20137).\n\nPhilosophers advocating this approach agree that the logic of\ndiscovery should be characterized as a set of heuristic principles\nrather than as a process of applying inductive or deductive logic to a\nset of propositions. These heuristic principles are not understood to\nshow the path to secure knowledge. Heuristic principles are suggestive\nrather than demonstrative (Carmichael 1922, 1930). One recurrent\nfeature in these accounts of the reasoning strategies leading to new\nideas is analogical reasoning (Schiller 1917; Benjamin 1934, see also\n section 9.2.).\n However, in academic philosophy of science, endeavors to develop more\nsystematically the heuristics guiding discovery processes were soon\neclipsed by the advance of the distinction between contexts of\ndiscovery and justification.\n",
