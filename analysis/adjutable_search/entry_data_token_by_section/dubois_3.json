    "main_text": "Social Philosophy, The Negro Problem, and Race || What is a Negro? What is a Race? What is Whiteness?\n2.2 What is a Negro? What is a Race? What is Whiteness?\n\nIn \u201cThe Study of the Negro Problems,\u201d Du Bois predicates\nhis analysis of Negro problems on his analysis of social problems\nas such; in another early essay, \u201cThe Conservation of\nRaces\u201d (1897a), he similarly predicates his answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is a Negro?\u201d on an answer to a more\nfundamental question, \u201cWhat is a race?\u201d Du Bois turns to\nthe human sciences to say what a race is, but also to account for the\nexistence of spiritually distinct races. Du Bois\u2019s\nhistorical-sociological definition of race overlaps his\nhistorical-sociological explanation of the existence of\nspiritually distinct races. To put the point more precisely, and in an\nidiom that is familiar to contemporary philosophers, Du Bois holds\nthat the same sorts of historical and social factors construct race\nboth constitutively and\n causally.[7]\n\nWe begin by analyzing Du Bois\u2019s explanation of the\ndistinctiveness of distinct races. We then turn to his definition of\nrace, which he introduces to counter the objection that, because\nspiritually distinct races cannot be identified as races from\nthe perspective of the natural sciences, they cannot be identified as\nraces at all. After considering contemporary philosophers\u2019\nongoing debates about Du Bois\u2019s definition of race in\n\u201cConservation,\u201d we turn to Du Bois\u2019s later\ntreatments of race and the notion of whiteness in Dusk of\nDawn (1940), Black Reconstruction (1935), and \u201cThe\nSouls of White Folk\u201d (in Darkwater (1920)).\n2.2.1 Explaining Race\n\nIn explaining and defining race, Du Bois participates in a\nturn-of-the-century conversation in German philosophy about the\nsubjects and methods that distinguish the human from the natural\nsciences\u2014that is, the Geisteswissenschaften from the\nNaturwissenschaften. Responding to Auguste Comte\u2019s and\nJ.S. Mill\u2019s efforts to reform the human sciences on the model of\nthe natural sciences, German scholars addressed a variety of questions\nas to the human sciences\u2019 cognitive aims, possible\nmethodological autonomy, and dependence on psychology. When Du Bois\narrived in Berlin in 1892, the conversation was well underway and had\nalready benefitted from the significant contributions of Wilhelm\nDilthey and Wilhelm Wundt several years earlier. During the 1890s\nthere were further contributions, in particular the writings of Georg\nSimmel, Wilhelm Windelband, and Heinrich Rickert. Although Du Bois\ninitially presented \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d as an\naddress to the American Negro Academy, the essay was a significant\naddition to the German debate, for it marks Du Bois\u2019s turn from\nthe Naturwissenschaften to the Geisteswissenschaften\nto explain the differences between races and to conceptualize racial\n identities.[8]\n\nAlthough Du Bois\u2019s essay acknowledges, as the \u201cfinal word\nof science, so far,\u201d that physical differences distinguish\n\u201cat least two, perhaps three, great families of human\nbeings\u2014the whites and Negroes, possibly the yellow race\u201d\n(1897a, 52), it more importantly maintains that that there exist\neight, spiritually distinct races. It also maintains that each\nspiritually distinct race, as such, is causally constructed\nby historical and social factors, for it asserts that each spiritually\ndistinct race causally owes its spiritual distinctiveness (its\npeculiar message, which dictates its particular historical role) to\nsuch factors\u2014specifically, to the common histories, laws,\nreligions, habits of thought, and conscious strivings that have caused\nit to be the cohesive, spiritually distinct race it is (1897,\n54\u201356).\n\nDu Bois also holds that the spiritual distinctiveness of a\nsocio-historical race cannot be explained in terms of physical,\nbiological facts. Like Wilhelm Dilthey, whose Introduction to the\nHuman Sciences (1883) had appeared a decade before Du Bois heard\nhim lecture in Berlin, he expressly questions the possibility of\ncausal explanations that reduce spiritual facts and differences to\nbiological facts and\n differences.[9]\n Thus, Du Bois rejects the physio-biological reductionism\ncharacteristic of nineteenth century racial science: the thesis that\nphysical racial differences causally explain the spiritual and\ncultural differences between racial groups. Spiritual differences have\nhistorical and social causes (law, religion, and so on), which Du Bois\ntakes to be causally independent of biological racial facts (1897a,\n 54\u201355).[10]\n2.2.2 Defining Race\n\nHaving sketched a preliminary account of the \u201csubtle\nforces\u201d that have causally divided human beings into spiritually\ndistinct races, Du Bois writes that, while these races \u201cperhaps\ntranscend scientific definition, nevertheless, [they] are clearly\ndefined to the eye of the Historian and Sociologist\u201d (1897a,\n53).\n\nThat spiritually distinct groups may not be readily identified as\nraces if one adopts the perspective of the natural sciences does not\nentail that they cannot be identified as races at all. Reminiscent of\nDilthey, again, Du Bois holds that the natural sciences and the human\nsciences have distinct subject matters (physical facts, on the one\nhand, spiritual facts on the other), and suggests that the former,\nbecause they conceptualize human beings exclusively in physical terms,\ncannot conceptualize them in terms of social and historical facts, and\nthus cannot conceptualize them in terms of the social and historical\nfacts that define spiritually distinct groups as races (Du\nBois\u2019s reason for claiming that social and historical facts\n\u201ctranscend scientific definition\u201d). If, however, one\nadopts the perspective of the human sciences; if, in other words, one\nadopts the conceptual \u201ceyes\u201d of the historian and the\nsociologist, then one sees these social and historical facts standing\n\u201cclearly defined\u201d to one\u2019s point of view. From this\npoint of view, Du Bois proposes, it is possible to identify\nspiritually distinct races as\n races,[11]\n and thus to state a definition of race\u2014or, in other words, to\nspecify the historical and social factors that constitute a group of\nhuman beings as a race.\n\nWhat, then, is race? It is a vast family of human beings, generally of\ncommon blood and language, always of common history, traditions and\nimpulses, who are both voluntarily and involuntarily striving together\nfor the accomplishment of certain more or less vividly conceived\nideals of life (1897a, 53).\n\n\nHere, Du Bois\u2019s distinguishes between the factors that generally\n(usually) characterize a race and the factors that must\nalways characterize a race; that is, the factors that\nconstitute a group of people as a race. Du Bois\u2019s definition\nproposes that a group of human beings counts as a spiritually distinct\nrace if, and only if, the members of the group have a common history,\ncommon traditions and impulses, and common (voluntary and involuntary)\nstrivings; counting as members of a spiritually distinct race does not\nrequire a common blood or a common language, however, although the\nmembers of a spiritually distinct race may indeed speak the same\nlanguage or have the same blood coursing through their veins (see\nLott, 1992\u201393; Gooding-Williams, 1996 and 2009; and Sundstrom,\n2003). Du Bois\u2019s definition asserts that each spiritually\ndistinct race is, as such, constitutively constructed by the\nhistorical and social factors the definition specifies as making a\nrace a race.\n\nIt has not escaped notice that the list of historical and social\nfactors that Du Bois identifies as causally constructing (as\nexplaining) the existence and cohesiveness of spiritually distinct\nraces\u2014common histories, laws, religions, habits of thought, and\nconscious strivings\u2014echoes the list of factors he identifies as\nconstitutively constructing (as defining) a group of human beings as a\nspiritually distinct race\u2014common history, traditions, impulses,\nand strivings (see Gooding-Williams, 2009, 51). To be sure, the lists\nare not identical. Still, we can reasonably assume that Du Bois means\nthem to capture the same content, supposing that the traditions and\nimpulses indicated in the second list include legal and religious\ntraditions as well as persistent habits of thought. Du Bois holds not\nonly that historical and social factors constitutively and causally\nconstruct spiritually distinct races, but, likewise, that the same\nkinds of historical and social factors constitutively and\ncausally construct spiritually distinct races.\n\nWhat, then, is a Negro? To be a Negro, Du Bois replies, is 1) to be a\nmember of one of three biologically distinct races, and 2) to be a\nmember of one of eight constitutively and causally constructed\nspiritually distinct races. The Negro is spiritually distinguished\nfrom other spiritually distinct races by its distinctive message, the\ncontent of which, Du Bois argues, is not yet fully articulated (1897,\n55\u201356).\n2.2.3 Debating Du Bois\u2019s Explanation and Definition of Race\n\nContemporary philosophers have devoted considerable attention to Du\nBois\u2019s explanation and definition of race in \u201cThe\nConservation of Races;\u201d indeed, they have given more attention\nto Du Bois\u2019s definition than to his treatment of any other\nphilosophical issue. Nearly all that attention can be traced to Kwame\nAnthony Appiah\u2019s engagement with Du Bois in \u201cThe\nUncompleted Argument: Du Bois and the Illusion of Race\u201d (Appiah,\n1985), an expanded version of which Appiah published as the second\nchapter (\u201cIllusions of Race\u201d) of In My Father\u2019s\nHouse (Appiah, 1992).\n\nAppiah\u2019s critique of Du Bois (see Appiah, 1985 and Appiah,\n 1992[12])\n argues for three, key claims: 1) that Du Bois\u2019s definition of\nrace fails to state criteria that serve to individuate his eight,\nspiritually distinct races; 2) that, notwithstanding Du Bois\u2019s\nintention to conceptualize race in socio-historical terms, the\ncriteria he in fact uses to individuate spiritually distinct races\ncomprise a physical, biological component\u2014specifically, the idea\nof a common ancestry; and 3) that, notwithstanding his ongoing,\npost-\u201cConservation\u201d efforts to substitute \u201ca\nsociohistorical conception of race for the biological one,\u201d the\nlogic of his argument \u201cleads naturally to the final repudiation\nof race as a term of difference\u201d (Appiah, 1985, 34\u201335).\nAppiah endorses this conclusion, stating that \u201c[t]he truth is\nthat there are no races,\u201d and that \u201cthe notion [of race]\nthat Du Bois required, and that underlies the most hateful racisms of\nthe modern era, refers to nothing in the world at all\u201d (Appiah,\n1992, 45).\n\nFor the most part, philosophical criticism of Appiah\u2019s reading\nof Du Bois has targeted his analysis of Du Bois\u2019s definition and\nhis antirealism about race. In an early response to Appiah, Lucius\nOutlaw (1996, 28) argues that Du Bois\u2019s definition of race is\nthe articulation of a cluster concept, and not, as Appiah presumes,\nthe statement of a set of conditions individually necessary and\njointly sufficient to constitute a group of people as a\n race.[13]\n In addition, Outlaw (1996, 21\u201322, 28) defends, and attributes\nto Du Bois, a version of racial realism, according to which biological\nancestry and physical characteristics play a role in defining\nrace.\n\nOther critics of Appiah\u2019s reading of Du Bois have been less\ninclined than Outlaw to defend or to attribute to Du Bois a definition\nof race involving biological characteristics; rather they have tended\nto argue that, Appiah\u2019s arguments to the contrary, Du Bois\nsucceeded in advancing a plausible, non-biological, socio-historical\ndefinition of race. Paul Taylor (2000), for example, takes issue with\nAppiah\u2019s claim that Du Bois\u2019s appeal to \u201ccommon\nhistory\u201d as a criterion of individuation is circular, arguing\nthat Appiah misconstrues Du Bois\u2019s understanding of what it\nmeans for two individuals to have a history in\n common.[14]\n Ronald Sundstrom (2003) also defends Du Bois\u2019s socio-historical\ndefinition, arguing that, on a metaphysical pluralist reading, it can\ndo the work of individuation that Appiah says it cannot do. For Taylor\nand Sundstrom, Du Bois was a racial realist who cogently defended the\nthesis that race is a social kind.\n\nMore recently, Chike Jeffers and Robert Bernasconi have productively\nre-oriented the philosophical discussion of \u201cConservation\u201d\naway from debates stemming from Appiah\u2019s interpretation of the\n essay.[15]\n On Bernasconi\u2019s account, these debates have tended to\nanachronism, and so tended to overlook the context-specific intentions\nanimating Du Bois\u2019s essay. In Jeffers\u2019s view, the\nAppiah-inspired debates have missed a key distinction shaping Du\nBois\u2019s social constructionism.\n\nAccording to Bernasconi, recent philosophical discussions of Du\nBois\u2019s explanation and definition of race \u201chave tended to\ndistort its meaning by imposing an alien question on it\u201d (2009,\n519). Rather than read \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d in\nlight of contemporary arguments about racial eliminativism (about\nwhether, in Appiah\u2019s words, race should be repudiated as a term\nof difference) and the proper referent of the concept of race,\nBernasconi places Du Bois\u2019s essay in its immediate political and\nhistorical setting. Specifically, he emphasizes Du Bois\u2019s\nengagements with the thought of Edward Wilmot Blyden, Alexander\nCrummell and Frederick Douglass and argues that the intended point of\nthe essay was \u201cto give hope to blacks at a time when scientists\nwere questioning their future on the basis of suspicions about the\nimpact of race mixing on their capacity to survive the struggle for\nexistence\u201d (2009,\n 536).[16]\n With Bernasconi\u2019s intervention, debate about Du Bois\u2019s\n1897 essay has turned to the metaphilosophical question of the\nrelative value of anachronistic (presentist) and antiquarian\n(historicist) approaches to the study of the history of African\nAmerican philosophy (see, e.g., Taylor, 2013 and Gooding-Williams,\n2017).\n\nAccording to Jeffers (2013), the Appiah-inspired discussion of Du Bois\nhas ignored the distinction Du Bois draws between political and\ncultural versions of the thesis that race is constitutively\n constructed.[17]\n The political version of the thesis, which Du Bois rejects, Jeffers\nargues, holds that \u201c\u2018racialized\nsubordination\u2019\u2026constitutes its [race\u2019s] very\nexistence\u201d (2013,\n 413).[18]\n The cultural version, which Du Bois endorses, Jeffers argues, holds\nthat the cultural factors mentioned in Du Bois\u2019s definition\n(traditions, ideals of life, and so on) constitutively construct races\nas \u201cdistinct cultures\u201d (2013, 411). Jeffers\ndescribes the cultural version of socio-historical constructionism\nthat he attributes to Du Bois as Du Bois\u2019s \u201ccultural\ntheory of\n race.\u201d[19]\n\nJeffers advances criticisms of Du Bois\u2019s definition of race and,\nunlike most other philosopher commentators, of his causal explanation\nof the existence of spiritually and culturally distinct races.\nRegarding the latter, he questions the reliability of Du Bois\u2019s\ngeneral, historical account of the genesis of the social factors to\nwhich Du Bois attributes the existence of these races (Jeffers, 2013,\n417). Regarding the former, he adduces an important conceptual point:\nnamely, that Du Bois neglects to justify the assumption that the\nhistorical and social facts that define and distinguish the\nspiritually distinct groups that the historian and the sociologist\nidentify as races should be thought to constitute (constitutively to\nconstruct) those groups as races. Perhaps they serve simply\nto constitute them as cultural entities, or, as Du Bois himself\nsometimes writes, as nations (Jeffers, 2013, 416). Absent that\nassumption, neither the historian nor the sociologist is entitled to\nidentify the clearly defined, spiritually distinct groups he or she\nobserves as races. And, absent that assumption, Du Bois is\nhardly entitled to present the definition that he bases on what the\nhistorian and the sociologist observe as answering the question,\n\u201cWhat, then, is a\n race?\u201d[20]\n\nNotwithstanding his criticisms of Du Bois, Jeffers, following Outlaw\n(1996), endorses and defends Du Bois\u2019s \u201cstrong commitment\nto the preservation and cultivation of black cultural\ndifference\u201d (Jeffers, 2013,\n 419).[21]\n Jeffers has also shown that Du Bois maintains that commitment\nthroughout his intellectual career (Jeffers, 2017).\n2.2.4 Rethinking Race\n\nPhilosophers interested in Du Bois\u2019s thinking about race in\nwritings he essayed after the publication of \u201cThe Conservation\nof Races\u201d have tended to focus on Dusk of Dawn (1940).\nIn this connection, both Paul Taylor (2000, 2004a, 2004b, and 2014)\nand Robert Gooding-Williams (2014) have elaborated detailed accounts\nof the notion of race that Du Bois sketches in the book he subtitled\n\u201cAn Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept.\u201d In a\nrelated vein, Joel Olson (2004), Shannon Sullivan (2006), Terrance\nMacmullen (2009), Robert Gooding-Williams (2021), and Ella Myers\n(2022) have examined Du Bois\u2019s conceptualization of whiteness,\ngiving particular attention to the the development of Du Bois\u2019s\nthought during the interwar period\u2014roughly from the 1920\npublication of \u201cThe Souls of White Folk\u201d (see chapter 2 of\nDarkwater (1920)) through the publication of Dusk of\nDawn twenty years later. Olson reads Dusk of Dawn as\nadvancing an argument Du Bois initiates in Black\nReconstruction (1935), and Sullivan and Macmullen read it as\nadvancing an argument that Du Bois initiates in \u201cThe Souls of\nWhite Folk.\u201d Gooding-Williams focuses on exclusively on\n\u201cThe Souls of White Folk.\u201d Myers provides the most\ncomprehensive scholarly treatment to-date of Du Bois\u2019s\nconceptualization of whiteness during the interwar period, with\ndetailed, individual chapters on\u201cThe Souls of White Folk,\u201d\nBlack Reconstruction, and Dusk of Dawn.\n2.2.4.1 Riding Jim Crow in Georgia\n\nIn chapter 6 of Dusk of Dawn, entitled \u201cThe White\nWorld,\u201d Du Bois imagines a dialogue between himself and a\nfictional interlocutor, Roger Van Dieman. Near the conclusion of the\nexchange, Du Bois says that \u201c[r]ace is a cultural, sometimes an\nhistorical fact,\u201d to which Van Dieman responds \u201cBut what\nis this group [the black race] and how do you differentiate it\u201d\n(1940, 77). Du Bois rejoins his interlocutor, remarking that he\nrecognizes \u201cit [the black race] quite easily and with full legal\nsanction; the black man is a person who must ride Jim Crow in\nGeorgia\u201d (1940, 77).\n\nHere, Du Bois seems to reject biological concepts of race, and while\nhe asserts that race is a cultural and sometimes an historical fact,\nhis reference to the Jim Crow car suggests that he is no longer\nconceptualizing the Negro or any race as a group united by a distinct\nspiritual message. But if the cultural and sometimes historical fact\nof race is neither a biological nor a spiritual fact, what sort of\nfact is it?\n\nOn Taylor\u2019s account, Du Bois means to answer this question by\nproposing that race is an institutional fact. Following John\nSearle (1995), Taylor understands institutional facts, like marriage\nand money, to be ontologically subjective and epistemologically\nobjective (2000, 110; 2004a, 109; 2004b, 91). Realizing that\n\u201ccollective intentionality can bring certain facts into\nbeing\u201d (2000, 110), Taylor\u2019s Du Bois understood race to be\nconstitutively constituted by human mental states (2004,\n 109).[22]\n2.2.4.2 Du Bois, Genealogy, Race\n\nGooding-Williams interprets Dusk of Dawn as defending a\ngenealogical concept of race. Taking Du Bois\u2019s subtitle as\nindicative of his larger philosophical aims, he argues that Du\nBois\u2019s essay toward the autobiography of a race concept is a\nmode of conceptual analysis that historicizes the concept of race. Due\nto the affinity of Du Bois\u2019s philosophical strategy to Friedrich\nNietzsche\u2019s approach to the analysis of concepts,\nGooding-Williams describes that strategy as\n\u201cgenealogical.\u201d\n\nNietzsche thought that making sense of the concept of punishment must\nbe a matter of unpacking the dense, synthesis of meanings (purposes,\nfunctions) that, over time, have been willfully interpreted into and\nforcibly imposed on specific procedures for inflicting harm\n(Nietzsche, 1998, 50\u201354). More generally, he understood that\nconceptual analysis can take the form of genealogy\u2014that is, of\nhistorical inquiry that separates the distinct meanings that have been\njoined together and even conflated through episode after episode of\nreinterpreting one and the same, more or less stable set of phenomena\n(procedures, complexes of habits, feeling, ways of perceiving, and so\n forth).[23]\n In sum, Nietzsche held that historically formed concepts, like our\nnotion of punishment, \u201care like ropes held together by the\nintertwining of strands, rather than by a single strand running\nthrough the whole thing\u201d (Clark, 1994, 22). To analyze such\nconcepts, he argued, \u201cis not to find necessary and sufficient\nconditions for their use but to disentangle the various strands that\nhave become so tightly woven together by the process of historical\ndevelopment that they seem inseparable\u201d (Clark, 1994, 22)\n\nOn Gooding-Williams\u2019s account, Du Bois 1) treats differences in\nthe color of men as the more or less stable set of phenomena\nundergirding the concept of race, and 2) characterizes the concept of\nrace as an intricate web of manifold and often conflicting\ninterpretations of those differences formed over the course of his\nlifetime. Autobiography, a narrative form of historical inquiry, is\nthe vehicle through which Du Bois genealogically analyzes that web of\ninterpretations, for to reconstruct the story of his life is, in his\nview, to disentangle these interpretations, one from the other, in\norder to show that and how they have been exemplified in his life\n(Gooding-Williams, 2014,\n 166\u2013167).[24]\n\nThus, Du Bois worries that what he has called a \u201crace\nconcept\u201d is not, strictly speaking, a concept, for he sees that\nit is not the sort of concept that can be defined by specifying a set\nof non-contradictory and hence logically coherent conditions for its\nproper application. Contradiction can inhabit the race concept,\nbecause Du Bois, like Nietzsche, allows that historically formed\nconcepts may comprise discordant interpretations of the meaning of one\nand the same set of phenomena. The race concept is\n\u201cillogical,\u201d but is not for that reason without the\nefficacy characteristic of \u201cforces,\u201d \u201cfacts,\u201d\nand \u201ctendencies\u201d (Du Bois, 1940, 67). Indeed, the efficacy\nof the concept is such that, internal inconsistencies notwithstanding,\nit has dominated Du Bois\u2019s life. Du Bois\u2019s exemplification\nof the race concept is his subjection to it. Reminiscent, again, of\nNietzsche, he holds that historically formed concepts can function as\nmechanisms of power and control (Gooding-Williams, 2014,\n 167).[25]\n2.2.4.3 The Power, Moral Psychology, and Gratifications of Whiteness\n\nAccording to Joel Olson (2004), Du Bois\u2019s understanding of\nwhiteness belongs to the political theory of race he begins to sketch\nin Black Reconstruction. Specifically, Du Bois conceptualizes\nwhiteness as a privileged position of social standing that has 1)\nafforded white workers a public and psychological wage compensating\nthem for their low economic wages; and 2) formed the basis of a\ncross-class, political alliance uniting white workers and capitalists\nagainst black workers (black slaves included). More generally, he\nmaintains that whiteness has historically functioned as a mechanism of\npower for recruiting white workers to police and reinforce the\neconomic exploitation of black workers. On Olson\u2019s account, Du\nBois explains the \u201csplendid failure\u201d of Reconstruction and\nthe genesis of the American racial order through his analysis of the\ncross-class political alliance of white workers and capitalists\n(Olson, 16, 30).\n\nIn Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois further develops his understanding\nof whiteness by interpreting racial oppression as, in Olson\u2019s\nwords, \u201ca political problem of dark and white worlds arrayed\nagainst each other, with the white world determined to subordinate the\ndark one\u201d (Olson, 22). Placing the conceptual opposition between\nwhite and dark (or non-white) worlds at the center of his analysis, Du\nBois especially emphasizes the role whiteness plays in legitimizing\nthe \u201cdomination of white Europe over black Africa and yellow\nAsia\u201d (Du Bois, 1940, 48; see, also, Du Bois, 1940, 85\u201387;\nand Olson 26, 155, fn.60).\n\nAccording to Gooding-Williams (2021), \u201cThe Souls of White\nFolk\u201d can be read as Du Bois\u2019s central contribution to the\nmoral psychology of white supremacy; that is, as his account of the\naffective, motivational, and cognitive dispositions that constitute\nwhite supremacism as a morally vicious character\ntrait\u2014including, e.g., the dispositions passionately to hate\nblack folk; to slander and murder black folk; and to believe that\nwhite folk are inherently better than black\n folk.[26]\n In \u201cThe White World\u201d chapter of Dusk of Dawn, Du\nBois complicates this earlier psychological portrait of the white\nsupremacist, stressing the deeply ingrained persistence of her or his\nracist behavior. Du Bois argues, for example, that \u201cthe present\nattitude and action of the white world\u2026is a matter of\nconditioned reflexes; of long followed habits, customs and folkways;\nof subconscious trains of reasoning and unconscious nervous\nreflexes\u201d (Du Bois, 1940, 87). Productively building on Du\nBois\u2019s moral psychology, Shannon Sullivan (2006) and Terrance\nMacmullen (2009) have recently brought Du Bois into conversation with\nJohn Dewey to develop pragmatist, habit-centered accounts of the\nworkings of white privilege.\n\nConsidering Du Bois\u2019s middle-period (roughly 1920\u20131940) oeuvre\nas a whole, Ella Myers has recently and persuasively argued that Du\nBois analyzes whiteness in multiple registers (material,\npsychological, affective, libidinal and spiritual)\u2014thus, not\nexclusively in the political theoretical and moral psychological terms\nthat Olson, Gooding-Williams, Sullivan and McMulllen highlight. On\nMyers account, we can fruitfully read Du Bois as arguing that\nwhiteness affords white citizens any number of\n\u201cgratifictions,\u201d including but not restricted to\nracialized self-esteem, the pleasures derived from anti-black\nviolence, and a sense of entitlement lived as a sort of existential\nfaith (Myers 2022).\n",
