    "main_text": "Ideas || Extensional relations between ideas: the logic of classes\n4.2 Extensional relations between ideas: the logic of classes\n\nOf the two main parts of Bolzano\u2019s formal logic, the extensional\nlogic of ideas (the logic of classes) and the extensional logic of\npropositions, the first part comes from a long tradition beginning\nwith Boethius (and derived from Aristotelian syllogistic) and ending\n\u2014 in Bolzano\u2019s times \u2014 with Gergonne. Bolzano did\nnot take his logic of classes from Gergonne or Euler, the most\ninfluential authors in their time, but rather from a small booklet\nentitled Outline of Logic (Grundri\u00df der Logik)\nby a now completely forgotten logician, J.G.E. Maa\u00df, published\nin 1793.\n\nIn TS, \u00a7\u00a7 94\u2013108, Bolzano defines a system of\nrelations between the extensions of ideas, and proves various theorems\nabout these relations. To begin with, ideas \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are\nsaid to be compatible just in case there is at least one\nobject that stands under all of them; otherwise, they are called\nincompatible. In the case in which not only some but all objects\nrepresented by \\(A\\) are also represented by \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is said to\nbe included in \\(B\\). If the converse also holds, i.e., if\n\\(A\\) is included in \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) included in \\(A\\), the ideas\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are called equivalent (or\ninterchangeable). He defines two further special cases:\nfirst, compatibility where neither \\(A\\) is included in \\(B\\), nor\n\\(B\\) in \\(A\\); Bolzano calls this relation overlapping or\nlinking. Second, we have the relation of\nsubordination, which is inclusion without reciprocity.\n\nThree kinds of incompatibility are distinguished: mutual exclusion,\ncontradiction and contrariety. Ideas \\(A\\), \\(B\\), C, \u2026\nare said to exclude each other iff they are pairwise\nincompatible. The ideas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are contradictory iff \\(B\\)\nhas \u201can extension that includes everything that does not stand\nunder the idea \\(A\\)\u201d (TS II, \u00a7103, 477), i.e. if\n\\(B\\) is equivalent to non-A. They are contrary,\nfinally, iff they are incompatible but not contradictory.\n\nAs all these relations are derived from compatibility and its\nnegation, it is possible to represent them in the form of a\ngenealogical tree (see \u0160ebest\u00edk 1992: 174). Simplifying\nsomewhat, we can define Bolzano\u2019s relations for pairs of ideas\nin the language of set theory as shown below. (Here, we depart from\nBolzano by also admitting universal ideas such as \u201csomething in\ngeneral\u201d [Etwas \u00fcberhaupt], along with objectless\nideas and the empty set as their extension (for Bolzano, an objectless\nidea has no extension, and there are no empty collections)). \n\n\n\\(A \\textrm{ is } \\textit{compatible} \\textrm{ with } B \\)\n\\( =_{\\textrm{df}} \\)\n\\(Ext(A) \\cap Ext(B) \\not= \\emptyset\\) \n\n\\(A \\textrm{ is }\\textit{incompatible}\\textrm{ with } B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(Ext(A) \\cap Ext(B) = \\emptyset\\) \n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{included}\\textrm{ in } B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is compatible with \\(B\\) and \\(Ext(A) \\subseteq\nExt(B)\\) \n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{equivalent}\\textrm{ to }B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is included in \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is included in \\(A\\)\n\n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{subordinate}\\textrm{ to }B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is included in but not equivalent to \\(B\\) \n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{contradictory}\\textrm{ with } B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is incompatible with \\(B\\) and \\( Ext(A) \\cup Ext(B) =\n\\textrm{universal class}\\) \n\n\\(A\\) is contrary to \\(B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incompatible but not contradictory.\n\n\n",
