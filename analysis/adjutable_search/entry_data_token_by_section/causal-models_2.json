    "main_text": "Basic Tools || Variables, Logic, and Language\n2.1 Variables, Logic, and Language\n\nVariables are the basic building blocks of causal models.\nThey will be represented by italicized upper case letters. A variable\nis a function that can take a variety of values. The values of a\nvariable can represent the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, a\nrange of incompatible events, a property of an individual or of a\npopulation of individuals, or a quantitative value. For instance, we\nmight want to model a situation in which Suzy throws a stone and a\nwindow breaks, and have variables S and W such that:\n\n\\(S = 1\\) represents Suzy throwing a rock; \\(S = 0\\) represents\nher not throwing\n\\(W = 1\\) represents the window breaking; \\(W = 0\\) represents the\nwindow remaining intact.\n\n\nIf we are modeling the influence of education on income in the United\nStates, we might use variables E and I such that:\n\n\\(E(i) = 0\\) if individual i has no high school education;\n1 if an individual has completed high school; 2 if an individual has\nhad some college education; 3 if an individual has a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree; 4 if an individual has a master\u2019s degree; and 5 if an\nindividual as a doctorate (including the highest degrees in law and\nmedicine).\n\\(I(i) = x\\) if individual i has a pre-tax income of\n$x per year.\n\n\nThe set of possible values of a variable is the range of that\nvariable. We will usually assume that variables have finitely many\npossible values, as this will keep the mathematics and the exposition\nsimpler. However, causal models can also feature continuous variables,\nand in some cases this makes an important difference.\n\nA world is a complete specification of a causal model; the\ndetails will depend upon the type of model. For now, we note that a\nworld will include, inter alia, an assignment of values to\nall of the variables in the model. If the variables represent the\nproperties of individuals in a population, a world will include an\nassignment of values to every variable, for every individual in the\npopulation. A variable can then be understood as a function whose\ndomain is a set of worlds, or a set of worlds and individuals.\n\nIf X is a variable in a causal model, and x is a\nparticular value in the range of X, then \\(X = x\\) is an\natomic proposition. The logical operations of negation\n(\u201cnot\u201d), conjunction (\u201cand\u201d), disjunction\n(\u201cor\u201d), the material conditional\n(\u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d), and the biconditional\n(\u201cif and only if\u201d) are represented by\n\u201c\\({\\sim}\\)\u201d, \u201c&\u201d, \u201c\\(\\lor\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\supset\\)\u201d, and \u201c\\(\\equiv\\)\u201d\nrespectively. Any proposition built out of atomic propositions and\nthese logical operators will be called a Boolean\nproposition. Note that when the variables are defined over individuals\nin a population, reference to an individual is not included\nin a proposition; rather, the proposition as a whole is true or false\nof the various individuals in the population.\n\nWe will use basic notation from set theory. Sets will appear in\nboldface.\n\n\\(\\mathbf{\\varnothing}\\) is the empty set (the set that has no\nmembers or elements).\n\\(x \\in \\bX\\) means that x is a member or element of the\nset \\(\\bX\\).\n\\(\\bX \\subseteq \\bY\\) means that \\(\\bX\\) is a subset of \\(\\bY\\);\ni.e., every member of \\(\\bX\\) is also a member of \\(\\bY\\). Note that\nboth \\(\\mathbf{\\varnothing}\\) and \\(\\bY\\) are subsets of \\(\\bY\\).\n\\(\\bX \\setminus \\bY\\) is the set that results from removing the\nmembers of \\(\\bY\\) from \\(\\bX\\).\n\\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) are the universal and existential\nquantifiers, respectively.\n\n\nIf \\(\\bS = \\{x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\}\\) is a set of values in the range of\nX, then \\(X \\in \\bS\\) is used as shorthand for the disjunction\nof propositions of the form \\(X = x_i\\), for \\(i = 1,\\ldots\\), n.\nBoldface represents ordered sets or vectors. If\n\\(\\bX = \\{X_1 , \\ldots ,X_n\\}\\) is a vector of variables, and \\(\\bx =\n\\{x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\}\\) is a vector of values, with each value \\(x_i\\)\nin the range of the corresponding variable \\(X_i\\), then \\(\\bX = \\bx\\)\nis the conjunction of propositions of the form \\(X_i = x_i\\).\n",
