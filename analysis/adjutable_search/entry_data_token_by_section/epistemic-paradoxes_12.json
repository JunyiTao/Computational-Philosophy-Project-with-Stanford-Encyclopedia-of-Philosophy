Dynamic Epistemic Paradoxes\n\nThe above anomalies (losing knowledge without forgetting, disagreement\namongst equally well-informed ideal reasoners, rationally changing\nyour mind without the acquisition of counter-evidence) would be more\ntolerable if reinforced by separate lines of reasoning. The most\nfertile source of this collateral support is in puzzles about updating\nbeliefs.\n\nThe natural strategy is to focus on the knower when he is stationary.\nHowever, just as it is easier for an Eskimo to observe an arctic fox\nwhen it moves, we often get a better understanding of the knower\ndynamically, when he is in the process of gaining or losing\nknowledge.\n",
