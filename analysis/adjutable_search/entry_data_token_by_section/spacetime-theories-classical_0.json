This is a platitude but still a crucial feature of the\nworld, and one which causes many philosophical perplexities \u2013\nsee for instance the entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes.\n For Aristotle, motion (he would have called it\n\u2018locomotion\u2019) was just one kind of change, like\ngeneration, growth, decay, fabrication and so on. The atomists held on\nthe contrary that all change was in reality the motion of atoms into\nnew configurations, an idea that was not to begin to realize its full\npotential until the Seventeenth Century, particularly in the work of\nDescartes. (Of course, modern physics seems to show that the physical\nstate of a system goes well beyond the geometrical configuration of\nbodies. Fields, while perhaps determined by the states of bodies, are\nnot themselves configurations of bodies if interpreted literally, and\nin quantum mechanics bodies have \u2018internal states\u2019 such as\nparticle spin.)\n\nNot all changes seem to be merely the (loco)motions of bodies in\nphysical space. Yet since antiquity, in the western tradition, this\nkind of motion has been absolutely central to the understanding of\nchange. And since motion is a crucial concept in physical theories,\none is forced to address the question of what exactly it is. The\nquestion might seem trivial, for surely what is usually meant by\nsaying that something is moving is that it is moving relative\nto something, often tacitly understood between speakers. For instance:\nthe car is moving at 60mph (relative to the road and things along it),\nthe plane is flying (relative) to London, the rocket is lifting off\n(the ground), or the passenger is moving (to the front of the speeding\ntrain). Typically the relative reference body is either the\nsurroundings of the speakers, or the Earth, but this is not always the\ncase. For instance, it seems to make sense to ask whether the Earth\nrotates about its axis West-East diurnally or whether it is instead\nthe heavens that rotate East-West; but if all motions are to be\nreckoned relative to the Earth, then its rotation seems\nimpossible.\n\nBut if the Earth does not offer a unique frame of reference for the\ndescription of motion, then we may wonder whether any arbitrary object\ncan be used for the definition of motions: are all such motions on a\npar, none privileged over any other? It is unclear whether anyone has\nreally consistently espoused this view: Aristotle, perhaps, in the\nMetaphysics. Descartes and Leibniz are often thought to have\ndone so; however, as we\u2019ll see, those claims are suspect.\nPossibly Huygens, though the most recent and thorough reconstruction\nof his position (Stan 2016) indicates not. Mach at some moments\nperhaps. If this view were correct, then the question of whether the\nEarth or heavens rotate would be ill-formed, those alternatives being\nmerely different but equivalent expressions of the facts.\n\nHowever, suppose that, like Aristotle, you take ordinary language\naccurately to reflect the structure of the world. Then you could\nrecognize systematic everyday uses of \u2018up\u2019 and\n\u2018down\u2019 that require some privileged standards \u2013 uses\nthat treat things closer to a point at the center of the Earth as more\n\u2018down\u2019 and motions towards that point as\n\u2018downwards\u2019. Of course we would likely explain this usage\nin terms of the fact that we and our language evolved in a very\nnoticeable gravitational field directed towards the center of the\nEarth; but for Aristotle, as we shall see, this usage helped identify\nan important structural feature of the universe, which itself was\nrequired for the explanation of weight. Now a further question arises:\nhow should a structure, such as a preferred point in the universe,\nwhich privileges certain motions, be understood? What makes that point\nprivileged? One might expect that Aristotle simply identified it with\nthe center of the Earth, and so relative to that particular body;\nhowever, we shall soon see that he did not adopt that tacit convention\nas fundamental. So the question arises of whether the preferred point\nis somewhere picked out in some other way by the bodies in the\nuniverse \u2013 the center of the heavens perhaps? Or is it picked\nout quite independently of the arrangements of matter?\n\nThe issues that arise in this simple theory help to frame the debates\nbetween later physicists and philosophers concerning the nature of\nmotion; in this article, we will focus on the theories of Descartes,\nLeibniz, and Newton. In the companion entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: post-Newtonian theories,\n we study the approaches followed by Mach, Einstein, and certain\ncontemporary researchers. We will see that similar concerns pervade\nall these works: is there any kind of privileged sense of motion: a\nsense in which things can be said to move or not, not just relative to\nthis or that reference body, but \u2018truly\u2019? If so, can this\ntrue motion be analyzed in terms of motions relative to other bodies\n\u2013 to some special body, or to the entire universe perhaps? (And\nin relativity, in which distances, times and measures of relative\nmotion are frame-dependent, what relations are relevant?) If not, then\nhow is the privileged kind of motion to be understood, as relative to\nspace itself \u2013 something physical but non-material \u2013\nperhaps? Or can some kinds of motion be best understood as not being\nspatial changes \u2013 changes of relative location or of place\n\u2013 at all?\n",
