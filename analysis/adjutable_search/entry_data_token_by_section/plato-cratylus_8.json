    "main_text": "The Tool Analogy (386e\u2013390e) || Creating (and Evaluating) Names\n4.2 Creating (and Evaluating) Names\n\nSocrates proceeds to argue that names are like drills or shuttles not\nonly insofar as they are subject to an objective or natural standard:\nPrecisely because they are subject to such a standard, they are also\nsimilar to ordinary tools insofar as they need to be created by a\nskilled expert. This expert is a lawgiver or nomoth\u00eates\n(388d\u2013389a). A lawgiver, Socrates explains, will create a\nnaturally suitable name only if he looks \u201cto that thing itself\nwhich is a name\u201d (390a). The thought is probably that the\nlawgiver\u2019s creative efforts need to be guided by knowledge of\nhow to produce a linguistic device that enables a competent user to\nperform the action of naming. Socrates adds that the lawgiver needs to\nfulfil a second condition: He needs to embody \u201cthe form of the\nname appropriate to each in syllables of whatever sort\u201d (390a).\nWhat does this mean? In making a parallel claim about shuttle\nproduction, Socrates\u2019 point is that there are different specific\nversions of the action for which shuttles are made\u2014separating\nlinen warp and weft, e.g., or separating woolen warp\nand weft\u2014and that the carpenter needs to create a naturally\nsuitable tool for one of these specific action types (389b\u2013c).\nSocrates must thus be assuming that there are different specific\nversions of naming, and that the lawgiver needs to create a suitable\ntool for one of these versions. Given that naming has been defined as\nthe action of picking out a kind, it is not difficult to see what the\nversions of naming might be: If A and B are\ndifferent kinds, picking out A and picking out B\nwill certainly be different versions of naming. Hence, Socrates\u2019\nclaim is that the lawgiver needs to make sure that his product is a\nsuitable tool for picking out a specific kind.\n\nAll of this sounds rather complicated. But while the details of\nSocrates\u2019 argument are indeed obscure at times, the big picture\nis clearer. Socrates proceeds from the idea that names are tools for\npicking out kinds to the idea that an individual name needs to be\nsuited for picking out a specific kind and must be created\naccordingly. And even though he does not say this in so many words,\nthere can be no doubt that he thus arrives at the following\ncharacterization of correct names:\n\n(NAT)\nA correct name for a given kind is a linguistic device that has\nbeen created from letters and syllables in a way that guarantees that\nit is suited for picking out this kind (or, equivalently, the way of\nbeing shared by its members).\n\n\nAs Socrates hastens to point out (390a\u2013e), an expert\ndialectician is responsible for ascertaining whether a name fulfils\nthe standard described by\n (NAT).\n It is clear, then, that while there are many humdrum contexts in\nwhich names are used, their true purpose is to make possible\ndialectical inquiries.\n",
