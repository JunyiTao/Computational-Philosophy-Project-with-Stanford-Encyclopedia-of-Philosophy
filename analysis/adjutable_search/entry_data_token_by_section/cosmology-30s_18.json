Thus,\nemotionally-loaded terms such as \u201cparalysis of reason\u201d,\n\u201cintoxication of the fancy\u201d, \u201c\u2018Universe\u2019\nmania\u201d, and the like frequently appear, these to be topped only\nby references to \u201cdelusions\u201d, \u201ctraitors\u201d, and,\nof course, \u201ctreachery\u201d, each associated with one or more\nof the guilty parties (Dingle 1937, p. 786).\n\nAbove and beyond his extreme language, Dingle makes certain\nsubstantive claims bearing directly upon central philosophical\nquestions. The issue, as he sees it, is nothing more than the question\n\u201cWhether the foundation of science shall be observation\nor invention\u201d (Dingle 1937, p. 786). As always, talk about\n\u2018foundations\u2019 is philosophical talk. The two opposing\npositions Dingle here calls \u201cfoundational\u201d involve views\non both method and epistemology, suitably tangled together. Dingle\ndelineates the opposed alternatives as follows. The way of true\nscience, he claims, shows that \u201cthe first step in the study of\nNature should be sense observation, no general principles being\nadmitted which are not derived by induction therefrom\u201d (Dingle\n1937, p. 784). Stated more explicitly, Dingle here argues that\nauthentic science is empiricist in epistemology\n(scientific knowledge is founded in sensory observation), and\ninductivist in method (general principles are reached\nvia inductive logic). Opposed to this view, he argues, is \u201cthe\ndoctrine that Nature is the visible working-out of general principles\nknown to the human mind apart from sense perception\u201d (Dingle\n1937, p. 787). As representative of this latter view Dingle cites\nMilne, and refers in particular to Milne\u2019s claim that \u201cit\nis, in fact, possible to derive the laws of dynamics\nrationally\u2026without recourse to experience\u201d (Milne 1937,\np. 329). Obviously, Dingle is here arguing against the view,\nMilne\u2019s view, that authentic science may be\nrationalist in epistemology (scientific knowledge is\nfounded in pure theoretical reasoning apart from sense perception),\nand hypothetico-deductive in method (general\nprinciples are justified by their deductively implying correct\nobservations).\n\nAlong with Milne, Dingle indicts Eddington, and, by implication,\nDirac, all three of whom, Dingle believes, are guilty of inventing\nscientific hypotheses by free mental imaginings rather than by strict\nimmersion in observations and observational data.\n",
