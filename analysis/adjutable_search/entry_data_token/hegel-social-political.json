The Place of Hegel\u2019s Social and Political Thought\n\nHegel\u2019s social and political thought has been a subject of\nseveral debates in terms of its form and content.\n1.1 Conservativism and Progressive Readings\n\nOne such debate concerned whether or not his views endorsed a\ndangerous conservativism, sometimes described as quietest or\nreactionary. His double-saying (Doppelsatz) in the Preface to\nthe Philosophy of Right that the \u201cthe rational is actual\nand actual is rational\u201d was read by some as saying that the\nabsolutist Prussia that Hegel lived under was somehow rational and so\njustified (Haym 1857). Yet, the more detailed comments found in the\nmain body of the Philosophy of Right consistently favour the\naims of the Prussian Reform era which were opposed by the newly\nascendant reactionaries after 1819 making it difficult to situate this\nwork politically at that time.\n\nThis position was taken even further to some extremes by Karl Popper\n(1966) who claimed that Hegel was \u201cthe father of modern\nhistoricism and totalitarianism.\u201d This view looked selectively at\ndifferent remarks we can find in the PR about how the state is\n\u201cthe march of God in the world\u201d found not in Hegel\u2019s\nown text, but in the published lecture note \u201cAdditions\u201d (or\nZus\u00e4tze) by his students included in most editions of the\nPR today (\u00a7258 Addition). Moreover, it was motivated by a\nphilosophical and political stance that had little, if anything, to do\nwith what is actually found in Hegel\u2019s work. \n\nThis \u201cconservative\u201d reading of Hegel was challenged\nlater by a more \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation that highlighted\nthe reforms and divergences both cultural and political between Prussia\nand the PR that make clear that Hegel did not support an\nauthoritarian government, but a new form of democratic institutions\ncomplete with jury trials that was more progressive (Avineri 1972, Knox\n1970). Hegel held a lifelong admiration for the French Revolution\ntoasting the fall of the Bastille throughout his adult life.\n\nToday, most commentators agree that Popper and others were wrong to\nclaim Hegel endorsed some view of authoritarianism. At the same time,\nHegel\u2019s social and political philosophy is more ideologically\nmoderate than the conservativism versus progressivism debate had often\nadmitted.  While he did advocate for more democratic and progressive\nelements than a reality at his time, Hegel did also defend the\ntraditional family and constitutional monarchy. Perhaps purposefully,\nHegel\u2019s thought is notoriously difficult to categorize given his\ninterest to overcome and transform ordinary distinctions with a\nvirtual consensus today that his work resists tidy classification as\nconservative, progressive or anything else.\n1.2 Metaphysical and Non-Metaphysical Readings\n\nA second long-standing debate among Anglo-American commentators has\nconcerned the relation of Hegel\u2019s social and political thought to\nhis logic and wider philosophical system. For many decades, the\nnon-metaphysical reading has been the dominant approach. The central\nposition was summed up by Z. A. Pelczynski (1964: 136\u201337) who said:\n\u201cHegel\u2019s political thought can be read, understood, and\nappreciated without having to come to terms with his metaphysics\n\u2026 some intellectual curiosity may be unsatisfied when\nmetaphysics is left out; a solid volume of political theory and\npolitical thinking will still remain.\u201d The non-metaphysical\nreading follows a broadly analytic philosophical post-Kantian\ninterpretation which sees Hegel as accepting, and even extending,\nKant\u2019s critical philosophy (Neuhouser 2000, Pinkard 1994, Pippin\n2012). This work is notable for typical focusing attention on the\nPR grasping it philosophically separately from other parts of\nHegel\u2019s system which are sometimes deemed to be overly dark with\navoidable metaphysical commitments (Knowles 2002, Wood 1990).\n\nIn contrast, the metaphysical reading counters that\nanti-metaphysical interpretations take a one-sided approach to\nHegel\u2019s work (Beiser 2005, Rosen 1984, Taylor 1975). Hegel\nconceived his PR to be a part of a wider system. Isolating any\none text from its wider context may appear to inoculate any such\nreading from metaphysical claims elsewhere in Hegel\u2019s system.\nHowever, only a reading that grasps the full metaphysical foundations\nof his thought will do justice to his self-understanding (Houlgate\n2005).\n1.3 Systematic and Non-Systematic Readings\n\nMore recently, scholars have focused on a core contention between\nmetaphysical and non-metaphysical readings about what relation, if any,\nHegel\u2019s PR has to his wider philosophical system. Most\nnon-metaphysical readings interpret the PR independently of\nHegel\u2019s system whereas all metaphysical readings attempt to\nsituate the PR within Hegel\u2019s system. Viewing the debate\nfrom this perspective, the core contention is not about the place of\nmetaphysics but the interpretive place of any work within the\nsystem.\n\nA non-systematic reading interprets Hegel\u2019s PR\nexplicitly separately from his wider system. This view has few\nadherents. It runs clearly against Hegel\u2019s own self-understanding\nstated in the PR\u2019s Preface where he says the PR\n\u201cis a more extensive, and in particular a more systematic,\nexposition of the same basic concepts which, in relation to this part\nof philosophy, are already contained in a previous work designed to\naccompany my lectures, namely my Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical\nSciences\u201d (PR, p. 9). The PR is explicit\nthat it serves as an elaboration of the section \u201cObjective\nSpirit\u201d within his philosophical system, and so a part of it.\n\nThe now orthodox view is the systematic reading which accepts that\nHegel\u2019s logic and system have explanatory force in interpreting\nthe PR (Brooks 2013). There is no denying their connection,\nonly its character and strength. There remain differences about how\nmuch the system does or should figure as well as related metaphysical\nissues (Wood 2017). For example, there is a\nconsensus that Hegel\u2019s political philosophy should be understood\nwithin its systematic context, but there remains disagreement about\nwhether we need to accept his arguments for the wider philosophical\nsystem in order to accept his contributions to political philosophy.\nThis entry will broadly follow the dominant systematic reading, but\nacknowledges there is not a consensus on how strongly a justificatory\nrole the system plays for his political thought.\n1.4 The Philosophy of Right\n\nHegel\u2019s main work of social and political thought was the\nPR. It was published in 1821 when Hegel taught in Berlin. This\nentry surveys his primary contributions in this work, but with\nreference to his other texts and political writings.\n\nHegel says the PR \u201cis a more extensive\u201d\nexposition of \u201cObjective Spirit,\u201d a section within his\nphilosophical system called his Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical\nSciences (see PM). The relevant sections of\nthe Encyclopaedia were intended to accompany the lectures that\nbecame published as the Philosophy of Right. The full\nEncyclopaedia begins with an examination of logic and then\napplies itself to an understanding of nature and the human spirit,\nwhere the latter incorporates analyses of psychology, art, history,\nreligion and philosophy in addition to social and political\nthought.\n\nHis approach to form and content is unique. The PR is\nmostly divided into numbered sections (\u00a7). These are occasionally\nsupplemented by later Remarks (R) where Hegel elaborated further in a\nlater edition or Additions (A) which took the form of edited lecture\nnotes of what Hegel had said by his students when teaching the\nPR. Hegel argues his positions in a dialectical way that is\nnot linear and designed to show how seemingly different perspectives\ncan have their opposition somehow dissolve within a new and higher\nperspective.\n\nFor example, our first apperception of some thing or object of\nthought might be as a pure being. As it is pure, it may appear to lack\ndeterminations \u2013 and so be nothing. In this way, Hegel holds that\nour thought has moved from pure being to pure nothingness. But yet what\nwe apperceive is a something and so this is seen as helping overcome\nthe false opposition of pure being and nothingness to a new, higher\ncategory of becoming as what is before is taking further shape as we\nsharpen our grasp of it. This dialectical method is infused throughout\nthe PR and Hegel says he has \u201cpresupposed a\nfamiliarity\u201d with his approach found in his logic and wider\nsystem (PR, p. 10, see SL, EL).\n\nSimilarly, the PR moves from basic building blocks that\nhave a somewhat \u201cpure\u201d nature not yet grounded in reality\nto their negation and then brought together in a higher, concrete\nreality. After an introduction establishing the PR as\nprimarily a work concerned with freedom, the PR is divided\ninto three parts. The first pure part is Abstract Right covering\nproperty and punishment followed by an opposite in Morality covering\nissues of conscience and moral responsibility. They become unified in a\nfinal part Ethical Life providing a more concrete reality that examines\nthe family, civil society, law, the state and ending with war and\ninternational relations. Each part shall be discussed in turn.\n2. Freedom and Right\n\nHegel conceives the PR primarily as a philosophy of\nfreedom. This is made clear in the PR\u2019s Introduction,\nwhich starts by declaring that \u201cthe subject-matter of the\nphilosophical science of right is the Idea of right \u2013 the concept\nof right [Recht] and its actualization\u201d\n(PR \u00a71). The PR\u2019s aim to provide a\nphilosophical account of \u201cright\u201d and its realization in the\nworld.\n\nHegel admits the existence of right is presupposed from his\nphilosophical system, of which the PR elaborates one part\n(PR \u00a72). The PR\u2019s Introduction proceeds to\nsummarise the dialectical argument for the free will discussed at\ngreater length elsewhere in Hegel\u2019s philosophical system. Our\nwill \u201cdetermines itself\u201d (PR \u00a74 Addition).\nThe challenge is determining whether or not its content is a product of\nfreedom or mere arbitrariness. We must be able to discern the bare\npursuit of being a slave to our passions like, for Hegel, the animal\nworld from the rational world of human beings. Hegel sees the\nPR as an examination into how \u201cthe free will which wills\nthe free will\u201d can be known in form and content (PR\n\u00a727).\n\nHegel defines \u201cright\u201d [Recht] as the existence\nof the free will in the world (PR \u00a729). So a philosophy\nof right is necessarily a philosophy of freedom that seeks to\ncomprehend freedom actualized in how we relate to each other and\nconstruct social and political institutions.\n\nFollowing his dialectical method, Hegel approaches the development\nof our comprehension of right through these stages: Abstract Right,\nMorality and Ethical Life. We progress from one stage to the next in a\ndistinctive way where apparent contradictions arising in each stage are\ndissolved through attaining a higher stage, where this cycle is\nrepeated and progress made since the beginning remains present where\nwhat was abstract and opaque at first becomes more concrete as we\nadvance to the end of this work. This multi-layered, dialectical nature\nof Hegel\u2019s argument does give his philosophical work an added\ncomplexity, but also a richness that close study rewards \u2013 while\nthis entry only focuses on the broad outlines of his arguments.\n3. Property\n\nThe first substantive stage is Abstract Right. Somewhat misleading\nits sections are entitled \u201cProperty,\u201d\n\u201cContract\u201d and \u201cWrong\u201d giving the false\nimpression that Hegel is discussing actual possession of property, its\nsale or punishment for breach of contract. Typically for Hegel, he uses\ncommon terminology in uncommon ways.\n\nWe must recall the main aim of Hegel\u2019s project is to\nunderstand how the free will wills the free will, and not mere\narbitrariness. This requires Hegel to find some ground for helping\ndecide when the free will wills freely, versus when it does not. Hegel\nfirst turns to taking possession of property. It is noticeable that\nHegel\u2019s account is aimed at using property possession as a first\nstep towards finding this ground rather than for building an economic\nsystem. For example, Hegel says that \u201cwhat and how much I possess\nis\u2026purely contingent as far as right is concerned\u201d\n(PR \u00a749). This is because Hegel does not intend to\ndevelop a full theory of property yet, but rather to locate a ground\nfor the free will\u2019s freedom.\n\nThe importance of property at this stage is its development of our\nself-consciousness (Benhabib 1984). For Hegel, I give my free will an\nexternal existence that others can engage with. My ownership of\nproperty is not determined by me alone, but something determined\n\u201cwithin the context of a common will\u201d shared between two\npersons (PR \u00a771).\n\nHegel calls the mutual recognition between two persons about\nproperty ownership a \u201ccontract\u201d (PR \u00a771\u201375).\nThis is no ordinary contract. The context in Abstract Right is a\nhypothetical space of two persons. There is no money or sale of goods.\nThe \u201ccontract\u201d is not a written agreement. All common\nterminology, but given different usages.\n\nThe key point, for Hegel, is that only the free will of an\nindividual can ground the free will of another (Stillman 1980).\nSomething is mine when mutually recognized as my possession by another.\nThis is the first appearance of right where the activity of my free\nwill in taking possession is free, and not mere arbitrariness. It is\nthis agreement between two individuals forming a kind of contract which\nis so important for Hegel. This is because mutual recognition becomes a\nvehicle for how we can develop further a more concrete understanding of\nfreedom as right in the world. If such recognition was under threat,\nthis would unsettle how we can ground our free will in a free will of\nanother.\n4. Punishment\n\nThis failure of mutual recognition is taken up next at the end of\nAbstract Right in a section entitled \u201cWrong\u201d\n[Unrecht]. This section has been widely interpreted by many\nscholars to offer a clear retributivist theory of crime and punishment\n(Cooper 1971, Primoratz 1989). At first glance, it is easy to see\nwhy.\n\nHegel distinguishes three kinds of wrongs. The first is\nunintentional (PR \u00a784\u201386). This is where both individuals\nare adhering to what they believe has been mutually recognized, but one\nis unwittingly incorrect. This kind of wrong is thought to be\nunpunishable \u2013 and the reason is because both sides see\n\u201cthe recognition of right as the universal and deciding\nfactor\u201d (PR \u00a785). One side is in error, but there\nis a strict appeal to the proper recognition of right.\n\nThe second kind of wrong is deception (PR \u00a787\u201389).\nThis is more serious than unintentional wrongs because while both\nparties claim to each other that they appeal to right, one side does so\ninsincerely. Thus deception has a different and more serious character\nthan unintentional wrongs.\n\nThe third and final kind of wrong is described as\n\u201ccrime\u201d (PR \u00a790). This is where one party\nmakes no appeal at all to right. The wrong [Unrecht] that they\nseek is to deny an appeal to right. This is a direct and tangible\nthreat to mutual recognition as one party is not merely insincere, but\nacts regardless of right \u2013 and to that extent acts arbitrarily,\nand so unfreely.\n\nHegel describes crime as an infringement of right, of mutual\nrecognition (PR \u00a795 Remark). This requires what Hegel\ncalls punishment as \u201cthe restoration of right\u201d whereby what\nwas infringed is reasserted and reaffirmed (PR \u00a799). For\nexample, the punishment of theft sends a message to the thief and wider\ncommunity that this crime should not have happened \u2013 and in\npunishing the crime Hegel believes it can help to restore the right\nviolated.\n\nHis theory of punishment is widely characterized as retributivist\nand it is easy to see why. In this section, Hegel is critical of\ndeterrence and rehabilitation approaches claiming \u201cthey take it\nfor granted that punishment in and for itself is just\u201d\n(PR \u00a799 Remark). Indeed, Hegel says the cancellation of\ncrime \u201cis retribution\u201d (PR \u00a7101).\n\nBut this commonly held view is controversial for several reasons.\nHegel may call this third kind of wrong \u201ccrime,\u201d but this\nview of crime is understood in a specific way (Nicholson 1982). There\nis no state or laws, no police or judiciary (Stillman 1976). A\nhypothetical scenario lacking prisons is hardly any complete theory of\npunishment. In fact, there is neither judge nor jury in Abstract Right\nto say who is right or wrong. This is because, when we view this\nsection in its systematic context, Hegel is drawing attention to\ncertain foundational ideas about wrongs more generally (e.g., that they\nare of three kinds) and how we should respond (e.g., that crimes can\ndeserve punishment) without yet giving his full view at this point in\nthe PR.\n\nHowever, Hegel does foreshadow his later and more substantive\ndiscussion of punishment with a non-retributivist character at this\npoint (Brooks 2017a). He highlights how determinations of crimes\n\u201csuch as danger to public security\u201d have relevance in\ndetermining what punishment is ultimately justified (PR\n\u00a796 Remark). While he says crimes \u201cmore dangerous in\nitself\u201d are a more serious infringement of right, Hegel is clear\nfrom the start that consequentialist factors are relevant to the\ndetermination of punishment related to crime\u2019s impact on society\nalthough he says little more at this point (PR \u00a796\nRemark). Hegel also rejects the view he is offering a\nfull theory of punishment at this point claiming \u2013 in the absence\nof laws and courtrooms \u2013 any action taken by an individual\nagainst another to punish takes the form of \u201crevenge\u201d which\n\u201cbecomes a new infringement\u201d creating new problems\n(PR \u00a7102). It is important to note at this point that\nthese sections discussing commonly used concepts like property and\ncontract as well as crime and punishment in uncommon ways all reappear\nwhen Hegel turns his attention to the final part of Ethical Life.\n5. Morality\n\nWhen Hegel concludes Abstract Right, he seeks to resolve a tension.\nAbstract Right had been focused purely on the external appearance of\nright through taking possession and forming a contract through mutual\nrecognition. In reasserting and restoring right through\n\u201cpunishment,\u201d we do not merely honour the\nuniversality of right for us all but this move \u201cis also\nat the same time a further advance in the inner determination of the\nwill by its concept\u201d (PR \u00a7104). While we have\ndiscussed taking ownership and wrongs in relation to the mutual\nrecognition of external property, this points us forward to our having\nto grasp the particularity of our inner ownership of right.\nThis perspective leads Hegel to open a new, second stage he calls\nMorality, but again using common terms in uncommon ways.\n\nThe main point about Hegel\u2019s theory of morality is he\nredefines it in an unusual way. For Hegel, \u201cthe moral point of\nview\u201d is a purely abstract and hypothetical exercise that is\nlogically prior and separate to how morality is related to the world\n(PR \u00a7105). Hegel focuses on the\nindividual\u2019s power of choice. To this end, Hegel is a champion,\nnot an enemy, of individual liberty as he is clear that there must be\nspace for subjective freedom.\n\nThe problem with our individual power of choice is that we may well\nbe mistaken about what we choose (PR \u00a7140 Remark).\nRecalling our separateness from others in Morality, he says we may\nintend good but our only guide is our individual conception of the good\n(PR \u00a7140 Addition). A more substantive guide awaits\nreflecting about ourselves acting in relation to others concretely in\nEthical Life.\n\nOtherwise, the danger arising from such pure, inward abstraction is\nthat morality is an \u201cabstract universality \u2026 without\ncontent\u201d (PR \u00a7135). Thus, for Hegel, moral\nphilosophy of any kind is by its nature empty.\n\nPerhaps no area of the PR has attracted more controversy\nthan Hegel\u2019s so-called \u201cemptiness charge\u201d against\nKant: Kant is accused of offering no more than an empty formula of\n\u201cduty for duty\u2019s sake\u201d where our task is to avoid\ncontradicting a set formula (PR \u00a7135, see Hoy 1989,\nFreyenhagen 2012, Stern 2012). Hegel\u2019s criticisms centre on\nKant\u2019s Formula of Universal Law stating we should \u201cact only\nin accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same\ntime will that it become a universal law\u201d (Kant 1997, 4:421).\nUndoubtedly, Kant does offer Hegel some ammunition for this criticism.\nFor example, Kant says \u201cAll I need for morality is that freedom\ndoes not contradict itself and hence can at least be thought; I do not\nneed to have any further insight into it\u201d (Kant 1996, B xxix). At\nfirst glance, it might appear Kantian morality is about following a\nformula and no more.\n\nBut, of course, as Kant\u2019s defenders are correct to point out,\nHegel\u2019s criticism is unfair and misses its mark (Wood 1989). In\nfact, Kant purposefully offers multiple versions of his formula to help\ndraw our considerations of morality away from a purely rationalist\nexercise and bring it \u201cnearer to feeling\u201d (note 15). Our\nanthropology matters for Kant and he does not see our living ethically\nas merely living without contradiction.\n\nWe should recall that Hegel\u2019s emptiness charge might be made\nagainst moral philosophy. This is because Hegel has redefined morality\nas a purely hypothetical armchair exercise that by itself is\n\u201cwithout content\u201d (PR \u00a7135). Of course, this\nis not how the targets of Hegel\u2019s criticism conceive of morality\n\u2013 and, to some degree, Hegel is using his own redefinition of\nmorality to critique how others understand the same term defined\ndifferently.\n\nA more appropriate comparison might be drawn in relating\nKant\u2019s principled approach with Hegel\u2019s comments about the\nrelation of religion to the state (PR \u00a7270 Remark). Hegel\nclaims a religious point of view can help furnish individuals with\nethical principles and help us lead a more ethical life (PR\n\u00a7270 Addition). This kind of formulaic thinking in PR to\nhelp guide individuals to ethical, law abiding behaviour is perhaps\ncloser to the kind of moral project that Kant was engaged in where\nthere are clearer areas of commonality than in Hegel\u2019s critique in\nMorality (Brooks 2013).\n\nAs should be clear, Morality can only make so much progress in\nindividual abstraction. What is required is a transition bringing\ntogether the universality of Abstract Right enveloping us all\nand providing a foundation in mutual recognition with the\nparticularity of Morality where we both outwardly and inwardly\ngrasp the development of right. This bridge is to the concrete\nindividuality found in comprehending right \u2013 not in\nabstraction \u2013 but now in the world and its institutions.\n6. Ethical Life\n\nHegel\u2019s concept of \u2018Ethical Life\u2019\n[Sittlichkeit] plays a pivotal role in his political and legal\nthought. It is here that Hegel takes other concepts considered earlier\nfound in Abstract Right (such as contract, property and punishment) and\nMorality to grasp them anew but now in their social \u2013 and more\n\u201cconcrete\u201d context. The following discussion retains an\nabstract character insofar as Hegel discusses institutions that existed\nat his time \u2013 like the family, civil society and the state\n\u2013 but in ways meant to bring out the rational within the actual\n(and actual within the rational) (see Stern 2006). For example, core\nideas about what constitutes a wrong from his discussion of punishment\nreturn, but with a deeper and evolved understanding of their place in a\nsocial context that brings out a different character and complexity to\nhis views \u2013 which is intended to unpack the character and\ncomplexity of the inner rationality that Hegel believes we can discern\nin the world.\n\nEthical Life is divided into three parts where each builds off of\nthe analysis thus far into the nature of Abstract Right and Morality,\nbut where each part, in turn, develops after the other. This ordering\nis not chronological, but dialectical. We are not a member of civil\nsociety or the state after we join a family, but the concepts of the\nformer are further developments from the latter as the following\nsections bear out.\n7. Family\n\nHegel begins his discussion of the first emergence of right embodied\nin the world through the sphere of Family. As we should expect, Hegel\nuses common terminology in uncommon ways again.\n\nIn Abstract Right, separate abstract individuals connect together\nthrough mutual recognition by acknowledging the ownership of property.\nIn Ethical Life, the Family is a sphere where concrete individuals come\ntogether bound in a love for each other (PR \u00a7158). This\nconnection is not purely arbitrary, like animals seeking only to\nsatisfy their needs and then seek another. For Hegel, the Family is a\nconnection that, at least in principle, aims at a permanence he calls\n\u201cmarriage\u201d (PR \u00a7161).\n\nThese marriages are not defined in contractual terms, but ethical. A\ncontract is an agreement that different parties can enter or exit on\nmutual consent. Any shared commitment or unity has a temporary\ncharacter. This is little better than the kind of mutual recognition we\nsaw in Abstract Right.\n\nHowever, in marriage, a more substantive unity is created that is a\npermanent bond unlike most contracts. This does not mean that Hegel\nforbids divorce. The termination of a marriage is seen as an\nunfortunate possibility born from marriage\u2019s foundation in our\nfeelings, like love, which can be unstable over time (PR\n\u00a7163 Addition).\n\nWhile divorce is permitted, arranged marriages are not (PR\n\u00a7162). This is because marriage is a further development of our\nfreedom \u2013 and it requires our being able to choose a life\npartner. In this way, marriage is an advance of our mutual recognition\nfrom a contract where we agree ownership of some thing to where we\nchoose to create a unity with another longer term.\n\nFor Hegel, the Family achieves unity through its creation of\nchildren (PR \u00a7173 Addition). To this extent, he plainly\nendorses the traditional family model (see Haldane 2006). However, this\nis done on very non-traditional grounds. What guides\nHegel\u2019s thinking is his logic which brings together opposites in\na creative unity producing some new, higher concept (PR\n\u00a7165). Likewise, Hegel saw men and women as embodying different\nfeatures with their sexual union able to create children, not unlike\nthe universal and particular giving birth to the concrete individual\n(PR \u00a7165).\n\nThese views have rightly been subjected to widespread criticism by\nfeminists and others (Halper 2001, Knowles 2002, Ravven\n1988, Stone 2002). A common argument is that Hegel\u2019s\njustification of the Family is a poor defence of privileging men over\nwomen on the basis of his controversial dialectical method. Only men\nhave the opportunity to engage outside the home in civil society and\nfully participate in the state. These critics claim that such a\nprivilege should not be reserved for men alone for many, often obvious,\nreasons. It is also argued that his broad views about the essence of\nmarriage as a permanent bond built on love can be achieved by\nnon-traditional families, too. It is worth pointing out that\nHegel\u2019s talk of the Family is of an ideal. Hegel fathered a child\noutside of wedlock who he supported throughout his life. He sees\nhimself as revealing the full development of right wherever it may take\nus, and what it requires from us or our institutions may be different\nfrom how we find them.\n8. Civil society\n\nHegel\u2019s civil society is primarily the place of work, as well\nas where he situates law and the legal system (see Sect. 5). Whereas\nthe Family is ideally a relation of unity from a natural law for each\nother, this gives way to the pursuit of the particular individual\nwithin the system of needs (PR \u00a7182). The Family is a\nsphere where it is all for one and one for all. In civil society, the\nneeds of all are met where I make my particular contribution in a\npro-market economic vision accepting a natural division of labour\n(PR \u00a7189, 198).\n\nHegel sees the world of work as a home away from home, or\n\u201csecond family\u201d (PR \u00a7252). Instead of\nfamilial love, there is a kind of brotherly love fostered through an\nindividual\u2019s connection to a corporation, grouped by the kind of\ntrade all are engaged in which educates and supports its member.\n\nInterestingly, Hegel sees market relations in modern society as a\nfoundation for the acquisition by free individuals of social identities\nincluding social solidarity. We develop our sense of selves through our\neconomic activities and the myriad of interconnections we forge with\nothers in an extra-familial but non-political way.\n\nA key problem is the problem of poverty. If possession of property\nis essential for the development of my sense of right and satisfaction\nof needs, a capitalist economic system which, Hegel accepts, makes\npoverty for at least some unavoidable raises a serious concern about\nwhether Hegel\u2019s ideal social and political philosophy is ideal\nfor all its citizens.\n\nThe problem of poverty is more than a concern about material needs.\nHegel describes those in poverty as forming a \u201crabble\u201d\nsaying \u201cpoverty in itself does not reduce people to a rabble; a\nrabble is created only by the disposition associated with poverty, by\ninward rebellion against the rich, against society, the government,\netc\u201d (PR \u00a7244, Addition). Thus we can understand\nthe rabble as having a conviction about their alienation that may be\nmore likely to find among those who are poorer, but not exclusively\nthem. To be in poverty is to be alienated and see one\u2019s state as\na separate, unfriendly other (Brooks 2020). While Hegel was a strong\nbeliever that through work we could develop our freedom to become\nreconciled to our social and political work, he lacks any convincing\nsolution to how the problem of poverty might be overcome short of\nchanging the economic system (Plant 1972).\n9. Law\n\nPart of Hegel\u2019s examination of civil society concerns law and\nthe administration of justice. Hegel\u2019s theory of law has been\nnotoriously difficult to characterize. This is likely, in part, because\nHegel uses common terms in an uncommon ways.\n\nHegel clearly accepts a strong link between morality and law\nsuggesting he endorses some variety of natural law. Like other natural\nlawyers, Hegel claims \u201cwhat is law [Gesetz] may differ\nin content from what is right in itself\u201d (PR \u00a7212).\nSomething can be lawful yet unjust \u2013 and this having a higher\nstandard of justice by which he can assess posited law is a common\nfeature of natural law jurisprudence.\n\nBut what is different is that, traditionally, natural lawyers have\ndeveloped their understanding of the standard of moral justice to be\napplied to an assessment of law prior to that assessment. For example,\nthe moral standard would be worked out first and then applied\nafterwards. This leads some critics of natural law to claim that this\napproach uses extralegal standards and reasoning to assess law and so\nreally engaging in moral philosophy rather than legal thought.\n\nHegel\u2019s perspective is unique (Brudner 2017). He accepts the\npositivist view that our understanding of law must be centred on the\nlaw itself rather than extralegal considerations. He says \u201cwhat\nis legal [gesetzm\u0101\u00dfig] is \u2026 the\nsource of cognition of what is right [Recht], or more\nprecisely, of what is lawful [Rechtens]\u201d\n(PR \u00a7212 Remark). So we start first from a close look at\nthe law before us \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 and not develop some\nnormative standard separately beforehand. For Hegel, we do not\ncomprehend this standard separately from the law, but immanently within\nit.\n\nHe says: \u201cthe scope of the law [Gesetz] ought on the\none hand to be that of a complete and self-contained whole, but on the\nother hand, there is a constant need for new legal determinations\n[gesetzlicher Bestimmungen]\u201d (PR\n\u00a7216). Hegel is claiming the law aspires to be a complete whole\nand, where we find gaps or inconsistencies, our task is to work out how\nthese can be addressed within the law as a self-contained whole in\nlanguage echoing Ronald Dworkin\u2019s (1977) use of legal principles\na century later. Thus, Hegel looks to the law for the ethical\nprinciples that can be used to continually reform our legal system into\nthe complete whole it aspires to be. This\n\u201cnatural law internalism\u201d discerns its principles from\nwithin the law rather than from outside it (Brooks 2017b).\n\nThe development of law is crucially not a project for professionals\nalone. Hegel makes a powerful case for the right to trial by jury\n(PR \u00a7228 Remark). His argument is that\nwithout a jury of ordinary citizens there is no guarantee that a\ncitizen would have a reasonable chance of understanding the charges,\nevidence and outcome, especially if convicted and punished. This is\nbecause the law is a technical language which risks becoming the\nexclusive property of a professional class. The best guarantee of\nlaw\u2019s publicity and connection to a public view of right is to\nensure a jury is convinced \u2013 if they can understand the trial and\ncome to a view, then Hegel finds it reasonable to expect the defendant\non trial can, too.\n\nIt is here that Hegel revisits the justification of punishment. We\nnow consider crime and punishment not in abstraction, but their\nconcrete reality. Hegel begins by noting that the \u201coutward\nexistence\u201d of a crime and its impact may not change the nature of\na crime in its concept, but it does impact how we respond. This\nsuggests that the same kind of crime can be punished more or less\nseverely based, at least in part, on the circumstances. Such a view is\nstarkly at odds with most retributivists where punishment should only\nbe considered in relation to what an offender deserved on account of\nhis moral responsibility for an offence.\n\nHegel makes clear that a crime\u2019s \u201cdanger to civil\nsociety is a determination of its magnitude\u201d where circumstances\nimpact in how we determine whether to punish, how much to punish and\nwhat form this might take. He notes \u201ca penal code is therefore\nprimarily a product of its time and of the current condition of civil\nsociety\u201d (PR \u00a7218 Remark). He adds that\n\u201cpunishments are not unjust in and for themselves, but are\nproportionate to the conditions of their time\u201d (PR\n\u00a7218 Addition). So the same crime committed in different\ncircumstances would be punished differently. For example, a crime\ncommitted during civil war poses a greater threat to civil society than\nwhen at peace \u2013 and so the former would see the crimes punished\nmore harshly. There is no difference in the offender or her\nresponsibility. While desert matters, it is not the only factor which\ndoes.\n\nThese comments make clear a non-retributivist picture. This is\nconsistent with a passage in his Science of Logic\n(SL), the text Hegel claims is presupposed as the foundation\nfor the PR:\n\nPunishment, for example, has various determinations: it is\nretributive, a deterrent example as well, a threat used by the law as a\ndeterrent, and also it brings the criminal to his senses and reforms\nhim. Each of these different determinations has been considered the\nground of punishment, because each is an essential\ndetermination, and therefore the others, as distinct from it, are\ndetermined as merely contingent relatively to it. But the one which\nis taken as ground is still not the whole punishment itself\n(SL, p. 465)\n\nHegel\u2019s argument is clearer here. Desert grounds punishment:\nonly the deserving can be liable to be punished. But it does not have a\nmonopoly on the amount or form that punishment can take. This picture\nis consistent with Hegel\u2019s comments in the PR where the\noutward existence of punishment may be different depending on\ncircumstances. It should be unsurprising to find that Hegel, who\nrepeatedly defends various groupings of three in his work would seek to\ncombine retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation in a new format\n\u2013 taking common concepts in uncommon ways. This was not lost on\nhis earliest interpreters in the UK, as British Idealists like Green,\nBradley and others held similar three-in-one views on punishment and\nrejected traditional accounts of retributivism (Brooks 2003,\n2011). This view has been called the \u201cunified theory of\npunishment\u201d (Brooks 2017a).\n10. The State\n\nHegel\u2019s final section of \u201cEthical Life\u201d is the state.\nThe love for others based on feeling in the family and then on the\nsatisfaction of needs in civil society is transformed to a patriotic\nlove for fellow citizens in support of a shared community, embodied by\nthe modern state (see PR \u00a7268). Moreover, the individual\npursuit of the satisfaction of needs leads to the development of the\nstate.\n\nFor Hegel, it is only in the state that the family develops into\ncivil society and where civil society gains greater\n\u201cactuality\u201d (PR \u00a7256\u201357). The state is where\nour \u201cconcrete freedom\u201d is realized as we conceive of\nourselves in our full social and political reality (PR\n\u00a7260). It is only here that the individual is conceived at once as\na member of a family, as a part of civil society and as a citizen of a\nstate. While the stage where our freedom is realized most concretely,\nit is not the case that individual freedom is somehow a problem \u2013\nour individual freedom has greatest actuality when mutually recognized\nby others in law. Hegel reflects that \u201cit has often been said\nthat the end of the state is the happiness of its citizens. This is\ncertainly true, for if their welfare is deficient, if their subjective\nends are not satisfied, and if they do not find that the state as such\nis the means to this satisfaction, the state itself stands on an\ninsecure footing\u201d (PR \u00a7265 Addition). Hegel\u2019s\nstate is a community where individuals and their individuality are\nmeant to flourish.\n\nHegel\u2019s conception of the state\u2019s composition is\ncontroversial. He seeks to unify the three traditional models of\ngovernment \u2013 aristocracy, democracy and monarchy \u2013 under a\nnew form of representative government with a constitutional monarch\n(Deranty 2001). Hegel proposes an Estates Assembly with the natural\naristocracy of the agrarian class in one chamber and representatives\nfrom different trades in another. Hegel believed that representing a\nlocality based on geography was arbitrary and lacking substance. He\nclaimed a stronger ethical relation could be formed through\nrepresentation of people through their work.\n\nHegel\u2019s state is headed by a hereditary monarch (\u00a7273\nRemark, Brudner 1981, Redding 1994). He claims the state requires\nsomeone to provide unity as an individual to the individual state, a\nsomeone to declare the state confirms a law as its law or agrees\ntreaties with foreign countries. An elected monarch or president as\nhead of state is objectionable because such a person would represent\nthe interests of supporters. This would create a barrier for the\nmonarch to truly speak with one voice on behalf of the country \u2013\nand so the monarch should be above such partisanship. A hereditary\nmonarch would provide some basis for there being a head of state that\ncould represent all and provide the unity required.\n\nWhile virtually no commentator is convinced by Hegel\u2019s\njustification of constitutional monarch, the orthodox view is that the\nmonarch is a rubber stamp (Yack 1980). Hegel remarks that \u201cin a\nfully organized state \u2026 all that is required in a monarch is\nsomeone to say \u2018yes\u2019 and to dot the \u2018I\u2019; for\nthe supreme office should be such that the particular character of its\noccupant is of no significance\u201d (PR \u00a7280 Addition).\nSome have drawn comparisons with the UK\u2019s constitutional\nmonarchy, where laws require the Assent of Her Majesty The Queen but\nwhere this is automatically done when requested by Parliament for\nexample (Findlay 1958).\n\nThe real power is behind the throne and held by an educated\ngoverning cabinet [Ministerium], often referred to as the\nbureaucracy. It is these advisors to the monarch who propose new laws,\nvia the responsible cabinet minister. These ministers, and not the\nmonarch, are answerable to the legislature whose role is to consider\nproposals and either enact or reject them.\n\nThere is reason to doubt this picture (Brooks 2007). The monarch\ncannot act arbitrarily. In being \u201cbound by the concrete content\nof the advice he receives,\u201d he must be able to discern this\ncontent (PR \u00a7279 Addition). And Hegel is critical of the\nUK\u2019s constitutional monarchy post-Civil War noting that\n\u201csince 1692 there has never been a case of the king\u2019s\nvetoing a parliamentary decree\u201d with the consequence that it\n\u201creduces him virtually to a cipher\u201d and he should be more\nactive on state matters \u2013 and, presumably, making his own\njudgements whether to support proposed legislation or not in\nrecommending it for approval to the legislature (LNR \u00a7133\nRemark). While the ministers advising him should be of rough\nequality making little difference who is in which role, the monarch has\nfull discretion to hire and fire anyone at will from an eligible pool.\nMoreover, it is the monarch advised by his relevant minister who agree\ntreaties and decide all matters of war and peace (PR\n\u00a7329). Given the monarch cannot be removed from office, this gives\nhim considerable powers in foreign affairs raising questions about how\nrelatively powerless, if at all, he really is.\n11. War and International Relations\n\nThe state has an \u201cimmediate actuality\u201d in terms of its\ninternal organization as discussed above, but it further determines\nitself internationally in relation to other states (PR\n\u00a7259). This part of the PR is the least worked out and\ndetailed.\n\nHegel accepts a broadly Westphalian and realist view of\ninternational relations whereby the primary actors are states each\nprioritizing the pursuit of their individual welfare (PR\n\u00a7336, Smith 1983). States interact with each other like\nindividuals in an anarchic global space. Without any governing global\nauthority, states can come into conflict with each other. He says\n\u201cwars must be regarded as necessary because independent peoples\nexist alongside one another\u201d (LNR \u00a7160 Remark).\nThis is not a justification or glorification of war, but a recognition\nthat states are in a state of nature where war is occasionally\nunavoidable (see LNR \u00a7162 Remark). States should aim to\nenable other states \u201cto live at peace with it\u201d and\n\u201cwar is that of something which ought to come to an end\u201d\n(PR \u00a7338).\n\nBut it is also the case that Hegel saw war as testing the relative\nhealth of states where those most rationally organized should triumph\nover less well ethically structured states. Combined with his rejection\nof Kant\u2019s proposals for perpetual peace, it has led some to\nquestion whether or not war plays a positive, and troubling, role in\nhis philosophy (Avineri 1961, Black 1973, Shelton 2000, Walt 1989).\nHegel also comments that \u201cmodern wars are accordingly waged in a\nhumane manner, and all persons do not confront each other in\nhatred\u201d which can give the impression that modern wars are of an\nimproved ethical quality than past wars \u2013 when the opposite\nappears true (PR \u00a7338 Addition).\n\nThe only judge of relative rights and wrongs in the international\nsphere is \u201cworld history as the world\u2019s court of\njudgement\u201d (PR \u00a7340). The PR then\ntransitions to the start of an account of the philosophy of history in\nthe next part of his system, which presupposes all parts preceding it\nnot least the PR itself.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\nEnglish Translations of Key Texts</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[EL], \n<em>The Encyclopaedia Logic: Part 1 of the Encyclopaedia of\nPhilosophical Sciences with the Zus\u00e4tze</em>, translated by T.
