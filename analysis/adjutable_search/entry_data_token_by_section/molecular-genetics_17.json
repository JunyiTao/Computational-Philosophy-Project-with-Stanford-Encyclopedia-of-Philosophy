Keller (2000) points out that the idea flounders on an\nambiguity. Does DNA provide the \u201cprogram\u201d or the\n\u201cdata?\u201d Others have argued that \u201cinformation\u201d\nfor development flows from a vast number of \u201cresources,\u201d\nnot just genetic resources. Oyama (1985) suggests that it is a mistake\nto think information is contained within static entities such as\nDNA. She believes that information exists in life-cycles. Other\ncriticisms challenge applications of particular conceptions or\ntheories of information, including applications of the causal and\nteleosemantic conceptions. \n\n\n Griffiths (2001) distinguishes between two ways to conceive of\ninformation, causal and intentional, and then argues that under either\nconception, information is not restricted to DNA. Causal theories of\ninformation, based on Dretske's (1981), are related to the Shannon\nmathematical theory of information (1948). Dretske distinguishes\nbetween a source variable and background or channel conditions. On\nGriffiths' (2001) reading of Dretske's theory, a source variable,\nX, carries information about variable Y if the value\nof X is correlated with the value of Y. Griffiths\ndescribes the causal interpretation of this idea as follows:\n\n\n\nThere is a channel between two systems when the state of one is\nsystematically causally related to the other, so that the state of the\nsender can be discovered by observing the state of the receiver. The\ncausal information is simply the state of affairs with which it\nreliably correlates at the other end of the channel. Thus, smoke\ncarries information about fire and disease phenotypes carry\ninformation about disease genes. (Griffiths 2001, p. 397)\n\n\n\nTo capture the conventional ideas about genetic information under this\ntheory, genes are treated as source variables and environments are\ntreated as channel conditions. It follows that genes carry information\nabout phenotypes because phenotypic values reliably correlate with\ngenotypic values. But as Griffiths points out, nothing stops one from\ntreating environmental conditions as source variables and genes as\nchannel. Under this application of the causal theory, environmental\nconditions carry information about phenotypes. Griffiths and others\nhave concluded that the idea that genes provide the information while\nother causal factors merely provide material cannot be sustained under\ncausal theories of information.\n\n\nGriffiths argues that the idea that genes and DNA provide all the\ninformation fares no better under intentional theories of information.\nIntentional theories are aimed at capturing the sense of\n\u201csemantic information\u201d that human thoughts and utterances\nallegedly contain (Godfrey-Smith 1999). The version of intentional\ntheory favored by philosophers of biology is teleosemantic. According\nto teleosemantic theories, a signal represents whatever it was\nselected to represent (in the process of evolution).  Under this idea,\none might say that DNA contains information about development because\nDNA's effects on development were selected for in the process of\nevolution. But as Griffiths and Gray (1997) point out, this idea\napplies to a wide range of entities involved in development, not just\nDNA. \n\n\nWeber (2005) challenges Maynard Smith's (2000) teleosemantic\naccount. Maynard Smith draws an analogy between information in a\nprogrammed computer and information in DNA. Computers execute\nalgorithms programmed by human beings and organisms express DNA that\nhas been programmed by natural selection. The information programmed\nin a computer is intentional in that one could determine the\nintentions of the human programmer by analyzing the algorithm. Maynard\nSmith argues that the information programmed in DNA by natural\nselection is intentional in the same sense. Weber offers two arguments\nagainst this view. First, he points out that DNA might contain\nnucleotide sequences that have arisen from chance mutations that\nhappen to be beneficial. If natural selection has not yet operated on\nthem, then Maynard Smith's teleosemantic theory implies they do not\ncontain information. Yet, causally, such a nucleotide sequence would\ninfluence development in the same way as sequences that have been\nselected for. Weber's second criticism of Maynard Smith's account\nstems from a closer examination of the intentionality associated with\ncomputer programs. Weber claims that intentional states associated\nwith computers are actually states of the human engineers who write\nthe programs, not states of the computers themselves: \"A computer\nprogram is a string of symbols that acquires a meaning only in the\ncontext of a community of engineers who understand what the program\ndoes and what it can be used for\" (Weber 2005, p. 252). The analogue\nto human programmers in Maynard Smith's account is natural\nselection. But natural selection does not have intentional\nstates. Hence, Weber concludes, the teleosemantic approach fails to\nsave the idea that DNA contains information in the intentional\nsense.\n\n\nIt is tempting to think that information talk is impotent in this\ncontext and indeed, some philosophers have argued that such talk is\nmisleading and should be abandoned (e.g., Sarkar 1996,\nWeber 2005, and possibly Rosenberg 2006). But others have taken the\nview that more careful thinking about concepts of information could\nlead to important insights (see next section).\n",
