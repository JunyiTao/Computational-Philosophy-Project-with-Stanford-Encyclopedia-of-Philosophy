    "main_text": "Practical reason\u2019s first principles || Context: the open horizon of human life as a whole\n2.2 Context: the open horizon of human life as a whole\n\nEthical standards, for which practical reason\u2019s first principles\nprovide the foundations or sources, concern actions as choosable and\nself-determining. They are thus to be distinguished clearly, as\nAristotle already emphasized, from standards which are practical,\nrational, and normative in a different way, namely the technical or\ntechnological standards internal to every art, craft, or other system\nfor mastering matter. Aquinas locates the significant and irreducible\ndifference between ethics and all these forms of \u201cart\u201d in\nthree features: (i) Moral thought, even when most unselfishly\nconcerned with helping others through the good effects of physical\neffort and causality, is fundamentally concerned with the problem of\nbringing order into one\u2019s own will, action, and character,\nrather than the problem of how to bring order into the world beyond\none\u2019s will. (ii) Correspondingly, the effects of morally\nsignificant free choices (good or evil) are in the first instance\nintransitive (i.e., effects on the will and character of the acting\nperson). Only secondarily are they transitive effects on the world,\neven when that person\u2019s intentions are focused, as they normally\nshould be, on the benefits of those external effects. (iii) Whereas\nevery art and technique has a more or less limited objective (end)\nwhich can be accomplished by skillful deployment of the art, moral\nthought has in view an unlimited and common (shared) horizon or point,\nthat of \u201chuman life as a whole [finis communis totius\nhumanae vitae]\u201d (ST I-II q. 21 a. 2 ad 2), for\neach of one\u2019s morally significant choices (for good or evil) is\na choice to devote a part of one\u2019s single life to a purpose\nwhich could have been any of the whole open-ended range of purposes\nopen to human pursuit for the sake of benefiting all or any human\nbeing(s).\n",
