Philosophy and Metaphysics\n\nWithin this classification of sciences, philosophy is meant to be the\nultimate science responsible for the issues common to all sciences,\ni.e. to the natural and human sciences as a whole, but which are not\nspecifically handled by any per se. That is why philosophy is\nconsidered the most general science of all sciences, and is defined\n\u201cas the science of the most general laws of the mental and of\nthose of reality in general\u201d (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 91). Stumpf\nreiterates this position in his autobiography:\n\nHowever one may formulate the difference between mind and nature,\neverybody distinguishes them in some manner. The philosopher, however,\nlooks for what they may have in common. Thus philosophy is primarily\nthe science of things in general, or metaphysics, to which the gateway\nis epistemology. But if philosophers since olden times have generally\nregarded psychology as belonging to their proper field is due to the\nfact that psychical elements have been much more prominent than the\nphysical in forming fundamental metaphysical conceptions. It is\ntherefore to the point to define philosophy as the science of the most\ncommon laws of the psychical, and of the real in general (or\nconversely). This is the only way through which we can justify the\ninclusion of logic, ethics, aesthetics, the philosophy of law,\npedagogy, and other branches in the domain of the philosophical\nsciences; the connecting link is always essentially psychology, which\nmust not therefore forget \u2013 when absorbed in experimental detail\n\u2013 the nobler phenomena of mental life that cannot be\ninvestigated in this manner and the great general questions. (Stumpf,\n1924, p. 414\u2013415)\n\n\nPhilosophy thus understood is first philosophy insofar as its main\ntask is to investigate the laws that provide the cohesion and unity\nbetween mind and nature. It is closely related to metaphysics or to\nwhat Stumpf also calls \u201cmetapsychics\u201d to the extent that\nit presupposes psychology as much as physics. But unlike traditional\nmetaphysics, which is thought of a priori, Stumpf\u2019s\nview of metaphysics, as he repeatedly imparted since his first\nlectures on metaphysics in W\u00fcrzburg, is based on experience\ninsofar as it is continuous with the empirical sciences and proceeds\ninductively, i.e. according to a bottom-up approach. (D. Fisette,\n2015c)\n\nStumpf\u2019s contribution to metaphysics has been the subject of\nrecent studies, (K. Schuhmann, 1999; D. Jacquette 2000\u20132001; R.\nRollinger, 2008b; R. Martinelli, 2011, 2015) and his lectures on\nmetaphysics delivered in Halle in the late 1880s has been recently\npublished. (C. Stumpf, 2015) He distinguished following Brentano four\nmain branches of metaphysics: transcendental philosophy, which focuses\non the justification of our knowledge of the external world, ontology\nwhose domain includes, in addition to the categories, the topic of\npsychophysical relations and that of causality among other things;\nthirdly, theology which is concerned with the evidence of the\nexistence of a foundation of the world, and finally, cosmology which\ndeals namely with issues related to the actual infinite.\n\nStumpf focuses particularly in his writings on two specific topics\nrelated to the domain of ontology (D. Jacquette, 2000\u20132001, R.\nMartinelli, 2015), namely the categories and psychophysical relations.\nIn Erkenntnislehre, he examines the categories of thing\n(substance), cause, necessity (legality), truth, reality, equality,\nand number (Stumpf 1939\u20131940, p. 13) and claims that these\nGrundbegriffe or categories have their origin in (internal\nand external) perception. This is primarily the case for the concept\nof necessity which is at the heart of his critique of psychologism.\nStumpf agrees with Hume and J. S. Mill that we cannot observe\nnecessary relations in nature, but he argues that internal perception\nprovides us with many cases of necessary relations such as\nmathematical axioms, or in the perception of three consecutive sounds\nwhere one of them is necessarily intermediate (as to the pitch)\nbetween the other two. (Stumpf, 1939, p. 48) The concept of necessity,\nas the concept of causality, is formed through a process of\nabstraction and can then be used, hypothetically, to explain natural\nevents based on causal laws. Moreover, we also find in Stumpf an\noriginal account of tropes which influenced the young Husserl. (R.\nRollinger, 2015)\n\nThe second metaphysical topic to which Stumpf attaches great\nimportance in his writings is that of psychophysical relations. Unlike\nmost of his contemporaries, including Brentano and Husserl, Stumpf\nunequivocally rejects the doctrine of psychophysical parallelism\naccording to which the physical and the psychological are aspects of\none and the same reality and advocates, following Lotze, a form of\ninteractionism that rejects monism in favour of dualism. The position\nthat Stumpf defends in \u201cLeib und Seele\u201d and in his two\nstudies on Spinoza, may be summed up by the following excerpt taken\nfrom his posthumous book:\n\nThe discredited dualism however, according to which everything in the\nworld, including the mental and physical, stands in thoroughgoing\ninteraction (directly or indirectly), now appears as the true monism.\nAccording to interactionism, the world, despite the diversity of its\nparts, is a unified organic whole. Thus the parallelistic view proves\nto be impractical and contradictory, and the theory of interaction\ntherefore remains, for the time being, the best guide through the maze\nof this great problem. (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, p. 822)\n\n\nOne of Stumpf\u2019s arguments in favour of interactionism and\nagainst parallelism is Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution (Stumpf,\n1910, p. 78\u201379) to which he attaches great importance since the\n1880s (E. Valentine, 2000) In an article entitled \u201cDer\nEntwicklungsgedanke in der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Philosophie,\u201d\nStumpf compares the bearing of Darwin\u2019s theory on science to\nthat of the Copernican revolution in astronomy. (Stumpf, 1899a)\nStumpf\u2019s interest in Darwin\u2019s theory is clearly expressed\nin his work on psychophysical relations, the origins of music, animal\npsychology as well as in those on child development.\n\nIn his lecture on metaphysics as in his paper \u201cLeib und\nSeele,\u201d Stumpf\u2019s main target is Mach\u2019s phenomenalism\nand neutral monism, which amounts to reducing physical objects and\nsubjectivity to functional relations between sensations (or elements)\nand inevitably leads, according to Stumpf, to idealism and solipsism.\nStumpf published in 1919 a very interesting study on Spinoza\u2019s\nparallelism in which he proposes an original and unorthodox\ninterpretation of Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. He argues that\nSpinoza\u2019s parallelism, if understood correctly, has nothing to\ndo with the psychophysical parallelism which was dominant at that time\nsince Fechner. According to Stumpf, the heart of Spinoza\u2019s\nparallelism rests on the distinction between act (or mental state) and\nthe immanent object towards which it is directed. (Stumpf 1919b, p.\n19) This act-content parallelism has its source in Aristotle and has\nbeen inherited by Brentano and Husserl via many philosophers\nfrom Thomas Aquinas to Descartes and Spinoza. Stumpf argues that this\ninterpretation is consistent with Spinoza\u2019s pantheism insofar as\nthe distinction between the act and its immanent content has been\ntransposed to God in Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. For since\nGod\u2019s intellect is considered by Spinoza as the only possible\nsubject, intentional acts and contents are then necessarily two of his\nnumerous modes or attributes. (see R. Martinelli, 2011) Despite his\ncritique of psychophysical parallelism, Stumpf advocates, like\nSpinoza, a form of pantheism that is consistent with his deterministic\nand mechanical conception of nature. In Erkenntnislehre,\nStumpf recalls that pantheism is a view that he adopted in 1876 in the\ncourse of several discussions with Brentano on theism and this was the\nposition that he already advocated in his lectures on metaphysics in\nW\u00fcrzburg and later in Halle. Stumpf\u2019s main argument against\ntheism is its inability to satisfactorily resolve the problem of evil\nin the world. However, as Stumpf pointed out in\nErkenntnislehre (1939\u20131940, p. 681, 798, 17), in his\nlast writings, Brentano seems to adopt a form of pantheism similar to\nthat of Spinoza.
