    "main_text": "Pedagogy || Character\n5.2 Character\nWe have so far been discussing the ideal of the many-sidedness; the\nmany-sided person and the person of character is one and the same,\nthough regarded from different perspectives (PS I: 199; SW II: 89; cf.\nSW IV, esp. \u201cP\u00e4dagogisches Gutachten usw.\u201d:\n519, ff). Herbart is particularly concerned with moral\ncharacter, and its virtues of stability, hardness\n(H\u00e4rte), and invulnerability. He wants to show that a\nmany-sided interest serves moral character, and how pedagogy devoted\nto the former contributes to moral education (Weiss 1928: 211). For\nHerbart, (moral) character, like all spiritual (geistig)\naspects of human life, is not a natural given, but a gradual\nacquisition. Psychologically speaking, it is the will that in the\nyoung child is stamped through repeated interaction with the outer\nworld, settling into \u201cuniform and stable [ways] in which [it\npursues] certain goals while excluding others\u201d; thus, the will\nbecomes character (Weiss 1928: 211; cf. SW II: 90).\nCharacter has distinct objective and subjective sides (SW II:\n90\u20131).  Objectively, character depends on the child\u2019s\nsusceptibility to formation and its individuality. Although the child\nis not born with \u201ca\u201d character (which term is reserved for\nsettled traits), yet he is born with certain dispositions, including a\n\u201cdisposition to stability of character\u201d (SW II: 91). This\nmanifests itself in what Herbart calls the will\u2019s\n\u201cmemory\u201d, i.e., the fact that under like stimuli, the will\nwill will like actions (SW II: 91\u20132). In this respect, there\nseems to be something predictable, hence \u201cobjective\u201d in\nhuman character. Although this stability is but relative, and one\nspontaneously finds himself choosing or forsaking, avoiding this or\npursuing that, yet\n\n\nwhere there is a memory of the will, the choice [in a given situation]\nwill be made of itself. The preponderance of wishes will involuntarily\norganize itself [and manifests itself in] choice. (SW II: 92; SW\nV: 203)\nIn different individuals, their inclinations and naturally\ndiffering intensity will cause the stability of simple willing to\nvary: \u201cevery individuality is and remains a chameleon\u201d (SW\nII: 93). Nonetheless, they originate in a \u201cunified source and\npoint of reference\u201d that constitutes the \u201cessential core\nof individuality\u201d (Weiss 1928: 213). Hence while choice only\noccurs in accordance with an individual, particular standard, it\nremains the precondition for the consolidation of character itself. It\nis out of simple willing and the psychological character to which it\ngradually gives rise that the \u201cmatter\u201d is gathered, as it\nwere, with which one has to work, and from which he ultimately\n\u201cmust secure the demands that he makes of himself\u201d:\n\u201cBeing is what gets a person started; demands follow\nafter\u201d (PS I: 198).\nOn the other hand, these demands typify the higher, subjective\naspect of character, \u201chigher\u201d because marked by reflective\nintelligence, an apperceptive distinction between willing and the\nobjects of will, between I and not-I. Thus the ego now identifies the\nnatural or simple will as its \u201cown\u201d will: the natural\nstability of the simple will becomes a willed or conscious stability.\nIn addition, the reflective effort to grasp oneself leads to\na demand regarding the objects towards\nwhich conscious willing is directed. That is, the will must\nadapt itself to changes in the object: it perceives a demand\nthat one must \u201cprecisely orient oneself in view of\ncircumstances\u201d, and to do so differently as circumstances\nshift. Hence the stability of character must be tempered with\nflexibility (Motivit\u00e4t); in the \u201cprecision of this\nflexibility lies the art of characterful living\u201d (PS I:\n201; 351, f.; cf. esp. 198).  Individual willing settles into\ncharacter through the struggle that arises in the individual\u2019s\nattempt to defend the ego and the will\u2019s stability. Because the\nstability of character is only relative, and shifts over the years,\nits true principle can only consist in being oriented towards\na realm of purposes (Zwecke) or ultimate values\n(Werte) (Weiss 1928: 216).\n",
