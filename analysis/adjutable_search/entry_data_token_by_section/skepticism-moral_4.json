    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Skepticism || A Regress\n3.3 A Regress\n\n\nThe next argument develops a skeptical regress. This form of argument,\nwhich derives from Sextus Empiricus (Outlines of Scepticism),\nis sometimes used to support the more general skeptical claim that no\nbelief about any topic is justified. Nonetheless, it might seem to\nhave special force within morality if supposedly foundational moral\nbeliefs are especially problematic in some way.\n\n\nThe argument\u2019s goal is to rule out all of the ways in which a\nperson might be justified in believing something. It starts with a\ndefinition:\n\nA person S is inferentially justified in believing\na claim that p if and only if what makes S justified\nis (at least in part) S\u2019s ability to infer p\nfrom some belief of S.\n\n\n\nNotice that what matters for this way of being justified is not whether the person actually bases the moral belief on an occurrent inference but only whether the person is able to infer that moral belief. This ability is usually understood to be present when the person has other beliefs that fit into a structure that the person could use to infer the moral belief.\n\n\nThere are, then, only two ways to be justified:\n\n(1) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified either\ninferentially or non-inferentially.\n\n\n\nThe moral skeptic denies both possibilities in turn. First:\n\n(2) No person S is ever non-inferentially justified in\nbelieving any moral claim that p.\n\n\n\nMoral intuitionists and some moral contextualists deny premise (2),\nbut moral skeptics argue that too many beliefs would be justified if\npeople did not need to be able to provide any reason or inference to support their moral\nbeliefs. If Thelma could be non-inferentially justified in believing\nthat eating meat is morally wrong, then Louise could also be\nnon-inferentially justified in believing that eating meat is\nnot morally wrong, and Nick could be non-inferentially justified in\nbelieving that it is morally wrong to eat vegetables. Conflicting\nbeliefs can sometimes both be justified, but it seems less plausible\nto hold that such conflicting moral beliefs are all justified without\nany ability to support the belief with any inference when each believer knows that other people disagree. If\nsuch conflicting beliefs are not justified in the absence of a\nreason, and if such conflicts are pervasive enough to undermine all\nnon-inferential justification, then premise (2) is true.\n\n\nAnother way to argue for premise (2) invokes science. Psychologists\nhave found that many moral judgments are subject to a variety of\ndistorting influences, including framing effects and certain\nmisleading emotions. Biologists then suggest that moral judgments\nevolved in ways that seem independent of their truth. Such indications\nof unreliability are supposed to show that moral judgments are not\njustified without inference (Sinnott-Armstrong 2006, Chapter 9,\npp. 184\u2013219; but see replies by Beaulieu 2009, van Roojen\n2013, and May 2018). That would support premise (2).\n\n Premises (1) and (2) together imply an intermediate conclusion:\n\n(3) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified\ninferentially.\n\n\n\nThis means that, to be justified, S must be able to infer\np from some other beliefs held by S. \nOf course, S does not have to draw any actual inference, \nbut S still needs to hold some other beliefs that could be used to justify that belief. \n\n\nBut which\nother beliefs? There are three main possibilities:\n\n(4) If any person S is inferentially justified in believing\nany moral claim that p, then S must be justified by an\ninference with either (a) no normative premises or (b) some normative\npremises but no moral premises or (c) some moral premises.\n\n\n\nTo the first possibility, moral skeptics respond with a variation on\nthe maxim that you can\u2019t get \u201cought\u201d from \u201cis\u201d:\n\n(5) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by an inference with no normative premises.\n\n\n\nNaturalists in moral epistemology deny (5) when they try to derive a\nconclusion that an act is morally wrong from purely non-normative\nfeatures of the act. However, moral skeptics retort that such\nderivations always depend on a suppressed premise that all acts with\nthose features are morally wrong. Such a suppressed premise seems\nmoral and, hence, normative. If so, the naturalist\u2019s inference\ndoes not really work without any normative premises. Naturalists\nstill might invoke inferences to the best moral explanation, but then\nmoral skeptics can deny that any moral hypothesis provides the best\nexplanation independently of prior moral assumptions (see above).\n\n\nThe next possibility is to justify a moral conclusion with an\ninference whose premises are not moral but are normative in another\nway. This approach, which is adopted by contractarians among others,\ncan be called normativism. Normativists usually start with\npremises about rationality and impartiality that are each supposed to\nbe normative but morally neutral. If rational impartial people under\nrelevant circumstances would agree to certain moral standards, this\nis supposed to show that the corresponding moral beliefs are true or\njustified.\n\n\nOne problem for this general approach is that different theories of\nrationality, impartiality, and relevant circumstances are all\nquestionable and lead to contrary moral beliefs. This suggests that\nsuch theories are not morally neutral, so these derivations do not\navoid moral premises. Other arguments from non-moral norms to moral\nconclusions run into similar problems. Moral skeptics conclude\nthat:\n\n(6) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by an inference with some normative premises but\nno moral premises.\n\n\n\nPremises (4)\u2013(6) imply another intermediate conclusion:\n\n(7) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified by an\ninference with some moral premise.\n\n\n\nIn short, moral beliefs must be justified by moral beliefs.\n\n\nThis creates a problem. Although the justifying beliefs must include\nsome moral beliefs, not just any moral beliefs will do:\n\n(8) No person S is ever justified in believing a moral\nclaim that p by an inference with a moral premise unless\nS is also justified in believing that moral premise\nitself.\n\n\n\nPremise (8) is denied by some contextualists, who claim that, even\nif a moral belief is not justified, if it is shared within a certain\nsocial context, then it may be used to justify other moral beliefs (cf. Wellman 1971, Timmons 1999).\nHowever, moral skeptics reply that social contexts are often corrupt,\nand no social context by itself can show that a moral belief is true,\nreliable, or, hence, justified in the relevant way.\n\n\nBut then how can moral premises be justified? Given (7)\u2013(8), the\nmoral premises must be justified by inferring them from still other\nmoral beliefs which must also be justified by inferring them from still\nother moral beliefs, and so on. To justify a moral belief thus requires\na chain (or branching tree) of justifying beliefs or premises, which must\nhave one of two forms:\n\n(9) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified by a chain of\ninferences that either goes on infinitely or circles back to include\np itself as an essential premise.\n\n\n\nThe first of these two alternatives is almost never defended, since\nmost accept:\n\n(10) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by a chain of inferences that goes on\ninfinitely.\n\n\n\nMoral skeptics also deny the other possibility:\n\n(11) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by a chain of inferences that includes p\nas an essential premise.\n\n\n\nAny argument that includes its conclusion as a premise will be\nvalid. However, anyone who doubts the conclusion will have just as much\nreason to doubt the premise. So, according to skeptics, nothing is\ngained when a premise just restates the belief to be justified.\n\n\nPremise (11) is opposed by moral coherentists (e.g. Brink 1989, Sayre-McCord 1996, \nSinnott-Armstrong 2006, Chapter 10, pp. 220\u2013251). Recent coherentists\nemphasize that they do not infer a belief from itself in a linear way.\nInstead, a moral belief is supposed to be justified because it coheres\nin some way with a body of beliefs that is coherent in some\nway. Still, moral skeptics deny that coherence is enough to make a\nmoral belief justified. One reason is that the internal coherence of a\nset of beliefs is not evidence of any relation to anything outside the\nbeliefs. Another reason is that every belief \u2014 no matter how\nridiculous \u2014 can cohere with some body of beliefs that is\ninternally coherent. Because so many incompatible systems seem\ncoherent, moral skeptics deny that coherence alone is sufficient to\nmake beliefs justified.\n\n\nNow the moral skeptic can draw a final conclusion. (9)\u2013(11)\nimply:\n\n (12) No person is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim.\n\n\n\nThis is dogmatic skepticism about justified moral beliefs.\n\n\nMany opponents find this conclusion implausible, but the regress\nargument is valid. Hence, its conclusion cannot be avoided without\ndenying one of its premises. Different opponents of moral skepticism\ndeny different premises, as indicated. However, it remains to be\nseen whether any of these responses to the regress argument is\ndefensible in the end.\n",
