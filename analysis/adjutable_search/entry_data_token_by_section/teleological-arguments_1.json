Design Inference Patterns\n\nThe historical arguments of interest are precisely the potentially\nproblematic ones\u2014inferences beginning with some empirical\nfeatures of nature and concluding with the existence of a designer. A\nstandard but separable second step\u2014the natural theology\nstep\u2014involves identifying the designer as God, often via\nparticular properties and powers required by the designing in\nquestion. Although the argument wielded its greatest intellectual\ninfluence during the 18th and early 19th centuries, it goes back at\nleast to the Greeks and in extremely clipped form comprises one of\nAquinas\u2019s Five Ways. It was given a fuller and quite nice early\nstatement by Hume\u2019s Cleanthes (1779 [1998], 15).\n\nThe question remains, however, about the formal structure of such\narguments. What sort of logic is being employed? As it turns out, that\nquestion does not have just a single answer. Several distinct answers\nare canvassed in the following sections.\n",
