    "main_text": "Biography: History and Legends\n1. Biography: History and Legends\n\nThere is very little historically reliable information available about\nthe life of \u015a\u0101ntideva. The Tibetan historians But\u00f6n and\nTaran\u0101tha tell us that \u015a\u0101ntideva was a prince from\nSaur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, a western coastal region that now forms\npart of the Indian state of Gujarat. But royal birth was a standard\nfeature of Indian Buddhist hagiographies, possibly because the\nhistorical Buddha himself was the son of a r\u0101ja, so there is some\nreason to be skeptical of this aspect of his biography. \n\nScholars of Indian history before the second millennium are often\nfrustrated by our lack of reliable and precise chronological\ninformation; and so it is for the dates of \u015a\u0101ntideva. One\ncrucial piece of information we do have is that another Indian author,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, quotes a passage from\n\u015a\u0101ntideva in a text that must have been composed by 763 CE.\nWe may conclude that \u015a\u0101ntideva must have lived and written\nbefore that date, and so that his life would likely have occurred in\nthe late seventh to the mid-eighth centuries CE. This was a period\nduring which Buddhism was still quite popular in North India, but had\nentered a phase of decline from which it would not be able to recover.\nNevertheless, highly original and valuable intellectual and spiritual\ndevelopments continued to occur within the Buddhist tradition at this\ntime. \n\nTwo major works are unanimously attributed to \u015a\u0101ntideva. The\nmost widely read is his great philosophical poem, the\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra (often abbreviated as\nBCA). This text immensely popular in Tibet; His Holiness the\nDalai Lama describes it as his favorite religious work, and numerous\nTibetan religious rituals quote from, or are influenced by, the\nBCA. Moreover, the work appears to have had a significant\nimpact on the now-extinct Buddhist tradition of Indonesia. The\nBCA has been translated into several modern languages,\nincluding Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, German, Hindi, Newari, and\nSpanish, for a total of at least twenty-seven contemporary\ntranslations (as surveyed by G\u00f3mez 1999: 4\u20135). Of the\nEnglish translations, Wallace and Wallace (1997) is notable for its\naccuracy and precision and Crosby and Skilton (1995, henceforth\nC&S) for its beauty and clarity.\n\nLess famous than the BCA, but almost as valuable and\nintellectually rich, is the \u015aik\u1e63\u0101-samuccaya\n(henceforth \u015aS), an anthology of quotations from the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras with commentary by \u015a\u0101ntideva.\nThis text contains a number of passages of ethical and philosophical\ninterest in \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s own voice, as well as numerous\nbeautiful and moving poems and a wide variety of scriptural materials\ndrawn from over a hundred s\u016btras. The \u015aS contains\ninstructions for how to behave while begging for food and while doing\nwork assignments in the monastery; it is thus an important witness to\nthe daily life of Indian Buddhist monks in the first millennium CE.\nTextual scholars have often relied on the \u015aS as a\ncrucial source, as it preserves passages in Sanskrit from dozens of\ns\u016btras that have been lost in their original language and are\npreserved, if at all, only in translation into such languages as\nTibetan and Chinese. The \u015aS was translated into Chinese,\nbut appears not to have been read very often in that language; its\nmain influence was in Tibet. There are two complete translations of\nthe \u015aS into English (Bendall & Rouse 1922, and in\nSS-G), as well as a very precise and careful translation limited to\nthe verses by \u015a\u0101ntideva that appear in the text (Harrison\n2013).\n\nTwo major versions of the BCA exist and were known in Tibet,\none much shorter than the other. It was the longer version, of about a\nthousand verses, that was regarded as canonical in Tibet (see\nBut\u00f6n 2013: 259); this longer version is the one most often cited\nand translated today. Some highly respected scholars (including\nHarrison in his 2007) argue that the shorter version of about seven\nhundred verses, sometimes known as the\nBodhisattva-cary\u0101vat\u0101ra or BsCA, was\nwritten first, followed by the \u015aS. Later on, someone,\nprobably \u015a\u0101ntideva himself but possibly another author,\nadded the additional verses to form the BCA as we know it\nnow. This chronology makes sense and is supported by some evidence,\nbut we may never know for sure whether it is correct.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s two works have quite different structures.\nThe BCA is organized into chapters and verses, and will be\ncited accordingly here: so BCA III.24 is the twenty-fourth\nverse of the third chapter. The \u015aS also contains many\nverses, including twenty-seven \u201croot verses\u201d that express\nimportant themes of the book, and numerous others composed by\n\u015a\u0101ntideva or quoted from sources; but these verses are\nscattered unevenly through a quite long prose text. The now-standard\nway to cite passages from the \u015aS uses page numbers from\nthe nearly complete Sanskrit manuscript discovered by Bendall; so a\npassage found at \u015aS 36 would be one that was originally\nfound on page 36 of that manuscript. Vaidya\u2019s edition of the\nSanskrit \u015aS provides the reader with these standard page\nnumbers, and so do both complete English translations.\n\nThe BCA is associated with a famous legend of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s life, recounted by But\u00f6n (2013:\n258\u2013259) and often retold in Tibetan religious contexts.\nAccording to this account, the master \u015a\u0101ntideva was a\nstudent monk at the great monastic university of N\u0101land\u0101,\nwhose ruins can still be seen in the modern Indian state of Bihar.\nUnfortunately, to all outward appearances, \u015a\u0101ntideva was not\nputting any effort into the central activities expected of\nN\u0101land\u0101\u2019s students: the study and recitation of\nBuddhist religious and philosophical texts. He came to be known as a\nbhusuku, a kind of Sanskrit acronym derived from words\nmeaning \u201ceat\u201d, \u201csleep\u201d, and\n\u201cdefecate\u201d\u2014as that was all anyone had seen him do.\n\n\nIn an attempt to encourage their apparently lazy student to return to\nhis proper path, some of the monks in authority at N\u0101land\u0101\ndecided to teach him a lesson. They assigned him to recite a text at\nan upcoming religious festival; and, just to humiliate him even more,\nbuilt him an elaborate throne from which to speak.\n\nOn the day of the festival, \u015a\u0101ntideva ascended the throne\nand asked the audience whether they would like to hear something old\nor something new; or in other words, whether he should recite\nsomething he had memorized, or an original composition of his own.\nPerhaps in amusement, the monks asked for something new, and\n\u015a\u0101ntideva began the first-ever recitation of the\nBCA. No doubt the audience would have been surprised to hear\ntheir lazy fellow-student present one of the greatest works of poetry\never composed in the Sanskrit language. During the recitation, while\nseated in meditation posture, the master began to levitate above the\nthrone. At the recitation of verse IX.34, he vanished, and the\nremainder of the text was recited by a disembodied voice from the sky.\nIX.34 reads:\n\n\nWhen neither entity nor nonentity remains before the mind, since there\nis no other mode of operation, grasping no objects, it becomes\ntranquil.\n\n\nBut what would it mean to be in a state in which \u201cneither entity\nnor nonentity remains before the mind\u201d, and why should this\nstate, often associated with the term \u201cemptiness\u201d\n(Sanskrit \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), be a highly valued goal of\nspiritual practice? These are remarkably difficult questions; the next\nsection offers the reader some preliminary groundwork that may help in\nengaging with them. Before we can even begin to try to understand\nemptiness, though, we must examine the key Buddhist teaching of no\nself.\n",
