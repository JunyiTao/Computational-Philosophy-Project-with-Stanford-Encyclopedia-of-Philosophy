    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance || Post-Structuralism\n7.1 Post-Structuralism\n\nThe legacy is most clearly present in the European philosophies that\nproceeded it. Existentialism\u2019s critique of foundationalism and\nthe authority of reason as well as its rejection of universalism,\nessentialism, and \u201cgrand narratives\u201d (or metanarratives)\nall had a decisive impact on post-structural philosophies in France.\nNietzsche and Heidegger in particular served as decisive influences on\nthe project of \u201cde-centering the subject\u201d in Jacques\nDerrida\u2019s method of deconstruction and in Michel Foucault\u2019s\ngenealogy of power, demonstrating how the subject is not the privileged\ncenter or origin of truth and knowledge. The subject is, rather, shaped\nin advance by sociohistorical structures, an overlapping network of\nnorms and practices, linguistic conventions, and shared meanings, and\nthis shaping takes place in a way that we are never fully\nconscious\n of.[14]\nThe\nindividual, on this view, is more of a placeholder or crossing point in\nthese anonymous structures, where the subject exists as \u201cthe\ninscribed surface of events [\u2026] totally imprinted by\nhistory\u201d (Foucault 1977, 148). Of course, existentialists reject\nthe idea that this historical imprinting or \u201cdecentering\u201d\nis total or absolute. They are, after all, still committed to the value\nof freedom and authenticity, but they recognize that freedom is never\nunconditioned. Beyond the philosophies of Heidegger and Nietzsche, we\nsee this recognition in Merleau-Ponty\u2019s conception of mediated\nfreedom, in Sartre\u2019s postwar account of\n\u201cfreedom-in-situation,\u201d and in what Beauvoir calls\n\u201cla force des choses\u201d (the power of\ncircumstances). The recognition of historicity as an impersonal force\nthat structures our identity had such an impact on Foucault\u2019s\nwork that he once remarked: \u201cMy entire philosophical development\nwas determined by my reading of Heidegger\u201d (Foucault 1985, cited\nin Dreyfus 1995, 9).\n",
