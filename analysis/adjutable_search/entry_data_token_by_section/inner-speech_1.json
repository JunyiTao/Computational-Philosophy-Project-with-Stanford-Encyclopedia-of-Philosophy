    "main_text": "Inner Speech and Thought\n2. Inner Speech and Thought\n\nA second question about inner speech is how it relates to thought. It\nseems that there must be some relationship, but it is an open\nquestion what that relationship is. In general, there are three views\nabout the nature of the relationship: (1) inner speech episodes\nexpress thoughts; (2) inner speech episodes\nfacilitate thoughts; and (3) inner speech episodes (at least\nsometimes) are thoughts of a certain kind.\n\nThe views are not mutually exclusive: one can certainly hold that\ninner speech is related to thought in multiple ways.\n",
