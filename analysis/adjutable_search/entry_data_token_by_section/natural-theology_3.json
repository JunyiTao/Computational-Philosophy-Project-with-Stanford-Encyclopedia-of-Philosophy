    "main_text": "A priori arguments || The argument from possibility\n2.3 The argument from possibility\n\nA third sort of a priori proof argues from facts about the\nmere possibility of something (or of some collection of things) to the\nexistence of a \u201cground of possibility\u201d that somehow\nexplains them. An early version of such an argument can be found in\nAugustine and the Neo-Platonic tradition, but the canonical\npresentations of this sort of \u201cpossibility proof\u201d are in\nLeibniz\u2019s Monadology (1714) and, much more elaborately,\nin Kant\u2019s book-length treatise called The Only Possible\nBasis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763). Note\nthat if truths about what is possible are necessary truths, as they\nindeed seem to be, then this might be a more specific version of the\nargument from necessary truths (see\n 2.2).\n\nKant\u2019s version of the argument is based on the claim that there\nare real possibilities that are not grounded in the principle of\nnon-contradiction, but that nevertheless must have a ground or\nexplanation (Kant 1763 [AK 2: 63ff]). If they are not grounded in the\nprinciple of non-contradiction, then they are not grounded in\nGod\u2019s thinking them rather than their negations, which is how\nLeibniz had proposed that all such possibilities are grounded. Put the\nother way around, Kant thinks that some impossibilities are\ngrounded not in the law of non-contradiction, but in a\nnon-logical kind of \u201creal repugnance\u201d between two or more\nof their properties. Kant maintains, for instance, that it is\nimpossible for a material being to be conscious, even though no\nlogical contradiction exists between material and\nconscious (Kant 1763 [AK 2: 85\u20136]). It follows that\nthis impossibility is not grounded in divine thought, for God can\nthink any proposition that does not involve a contradiction. So facts\nabout some real possibilities and real impossibilities can only be\ngrounded in a necessary being that somehow exemplifies\n(rather than merely thinking) every combination of fundamental\nproperties whose joint exemplification is really possible. That being,\nof course, is supposed to be God. (For discussion, see Fisher and\nWatkins 1998; Adams 2000; Chignell 2009, 2012, 2014; Stang 2010; Abaci\n2014; Yong 2014; Hoffer 2016; Abaci 2019; Oberst 2018, 2020).\n\nOne way out of this argument is simply to claim that some real\npossibilities are primitive or ungrounded. This appears to be an\noption for Kant in his critical period insofar as he is no longer\ncommitted to rationalist principles such as the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (see Abaci 2019). Still, even in his critical period\n(i.e., after 1770 or so), Kant never repudiated the earlier\nproof\u2014and supposedly claimed in a lecture from the 1780s that it\n\u201ccan in no way be refuted\u201d (Kant LPT [AK 28: 1034]). This\nsuggests that in his critical period Kant still held that God\u2019s\nexistence is the only available ground for real possibility, but that\nthe explanatory point may justify at most a kind of theoretical belief\n(Glaube) rather than full demonstrative knowledge (see\nChignell 2009, Stang 2016, and Oberst 2020).\n3. A posteriori Arguments\n3.1 The classical cosmological argument\n\nAn a posteriori argument involves at least one premise whose\njustification essentially appeals to some sort of empirical fact or\nexperience. The main demonstrative a posteriori argument is\nwhat Kant dubbed \u201cthe cosmological argument\u201d. It is\nmotivated by the familiar question \u201cWhy is there something\nrather than nothing?\u201d and goes from the empirical fact of the\nexistence of something (or of the cosmos as a whole, perhaps) to the\nexistence of a first cause or ground of that cosmos that is, at least\nin part, not identical to that cosmos. Cosmological arguments are\nfound across almost every philosophical tradition, and find prominence\nin the West in the writings of Aristotle, Avicenna,\nal-Gh&amacr;z&amacr;li, Maimonides, Aquinas, Locke, Leibniz, Samuel\nClarke, and David Hume. Here we will start with Avicenna, but then\nfocus largely on the early modern period.\n\nAvicenna (980\u20131037), whose Arabic name is Ibn Sina, sets out\ncosmological arguments in a number of works, but a detailed version is\nfound in his Remarks and Admonitions (Kitab al-Isharat wa\nl-Tanbihat) (Avicenna [ISR]; Mayer 2001). He begins with a claim\nabout contingently existing things: since it is possible for a\ncontingent thing either to exist or not to exist, whether it exists or\nnot hangs in the balance. But then, if a contingent thing does exist,\nthere must be something external to it, a cause, that accounts for its\nexisting rather than not. This establishes a principle crucial to the\nargument: \u201cthe existence of every contingent is from other than\nit.\u201d\n\nAvicenna next considers the aggregate of all the existing contingent\nindividual things, the existence of each of which is accounted for by\nits causal antecedents. He then proposes and evaluates four options\nfor accounting for the aggregate\u2019s existence. The first is that\nthe existence of the aggregate does not require a cause. However,\ngiven the principle that the existence of any contingent thing must\nhave a cause, the aggregate would then have to exist necessarily. But\nthe aggregate\u2019s existing necessarily is ruled out by the fact\nthat all of the individuals in it are contingent things. On the second\noption, the cause of the existence of the aggregate is \u201cthe\nindividuals all together.\u201d But then the aggregate would cause\nitself to exist, which is ruled out by the principle that the\nexistence of any contingent thing requires a cause other than it. The\nthird option is that the cause of the aggregate is one of the\nindividuals in it. But all of those individuals are caused to exist by\nother things in the aggregate, so no one individual is qualified to be\nthe cause of the existence of the entire aggregate. The only remaining\noption is that the existence of the aggregate has a cause external to\nthe aggregate. Because all of the contingently existing things are in\nthe aggregate, the cause must be a necessarily existing thing (Mayer\n2001). Avicenna is fully aware that the argument shouldn\u2019t end\nhere, since it must be shown that the necessarily existing thing is\nGod, and he provides a number of considerations in favor of this claim\n(Adamson 2013).\n\nAvicenna\u2019s cosmological argument from the contingency of the\nworld contrasts with another major type of argument for God\u2019s\nexistence in Islamic natural theology, one that aims to demonstrate\nthe existence of God from the beginning of the world in time.\nAl-Ghazali (1056-1111), in The Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers, develops this type of argument in two steps. The\nfirst aims to establish, against a prominent Aristotelian tradition,\nthat the world is not eternal but has a beginning in time. The second\nstep reasons that for any being that begins to exist at a time, there\nmust be something that determines that it comes to exist at that time.\nAnd thus, because the world begins to exist at a time, there must be\nsomething which determines that it comes to exist at that time. As\nal-Ghazali puts it, \u201cevery being which begins has a cause for\nits beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it\npossesses a cause for its beginning.\u201d He then argues that it\nmust be God who by free choice determines that the world comes to\nexist at the time it does, and we can thus conclude that God exists.\nThese argumentative themes are characteristic features of the\nAsh\u2019arite theological tradition in Islam; in recent times,\nal-Ghazali\u2019s argument has been defended by William Lane Craig\n(1979).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s cosmological argument (Leibniz 1697 [PE]:\n149\u201355; 1714 [PP]: 646, [PE]: 218\u201319) does not assume or\nattempt to establish that the world, the collection of all actual\ncontingent beings, has a beginning in time, and in this respect it\nmore closely resembles Avicenna\u2019s argument than\nal-Ghazali\u2019s. Leibniz argues as follows: suppose that in fact\nthe world has no beginning in time, and that each being in the world\nhas an explanation in some previously existing being(s). Two demands\nfor explanation might still arise: Why is there a world at all rather\nthan none? and: Why does this world exist and not some other world?\nNeither explanation can be provided by appealing solely to entities\nwithin the world (or within time). Leibniz\u2019s conclusion is that\nthere must be a being that is not merely hypothetically, but\nabsolutely necessary, and whose own explanation is contained\nwithin itself. This being is God. (A similar cosmological argument is\nadvanced around the same time by Samuel Clarke (1705), see also the\nentry on\n Samuel Clarke).\n\nDavid Hume puts forward three main objections to the type of\ncosmological argument offered by Leibniz and Clarke (Hume 1779, Part\nIX, and the entry\n Hume on religion).\n The first is that the notion of (absolutely) necessary existence\nitself is problematic. Suppose that some being is absolutely\nnecessary\u2014then its nonexistence should be absolutely\ninconceivable. But, says Hume, for any being whose existence we can\nconceive, we can also conceive its nonexistence, and thus it\nisn\u2019t a necessary being. Hume anticipates the objection that if\nwe truly understood the divine nature, we would be unable to conceive\nGod\u2019s nonexistence. He replies that an analogous point can be\nmade about matter: for all we know, if we truly understood the nature\nof matter, we would be unable to conceive its nonexistence. This would\nshow that the existence of matter is not contingent after all, and\nthat it does not require an external explanation. Thus, by parity, the\ncosmological argument does not establish that God is the necessary\nbeing who is responsible for the rest of the cosmos.\n\nHume\u2019s second objection is that God cannot be the causal\nexplanation of the existence of a series of contingent beings that has\nno temporal beginning, since any causal relation \u201cimplies a\npriority in time and a beginning of existence\u201d (Hume 1779, Part\nIV). In reply, it seems quite possible to conceive of a non-temporal\ncausal relation, and thus to conceive of God, from outside of time,\ncausing a series of contingent beings that has always existed. Indeed,\nthis view is common in the theological tradition. Moreover, as Kant\nalong with numerous contemporary metaphysicians argue, we can\ncoherently conceive of a relation of simultaneous causation.\nIf this is right, then even a God who is in time could ground the\nexistence of a series of contingent beings with no temporal beginning.\n\n\nHume\u2019s third objection is that in a causal series of contingent\nbeings without a temporal beginning, each being will have a causal\nexplanation by virtue of its predecessors. Since there is no first\nbeing, there will be a causal explanation for every contingent being\non the basis of previously existing contingent beings. However, if\neach individual contingent being has a causal explanation, then the\nentire causal series has an explanation. For wholes are nothing over\nand above their parts:\n\n\ndid I show you the particular causes of each individual in a\ncollection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very\nunreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the\nwhole twenty. (Part IV) \n\n\nA reply to this last objection might be that even if one has explained\nin this way the existence of each individual in the contingent series,\none still has not answered the two questions mentioned earlier: Why is\nthere a world at all rather than none? and: Why does this world exist\nand not some other world? (for further discussion, see Rowe 1975;\nSwinburne 2004; Pruss 2006; O\u2019Connor 2008).\n\nKant, too, objects to the cosmological argument, but mainly on the\ngrounds that it delivers an object that is inadequate to the classical\nconception of God. Any effort to turn the ultimate ground into the\nmost perfect of all beings, Kant says, will have to smuggle in some\nsort of ontological argument (see Pasternack 2001; Forgie 2003; Proops\n2014; and the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion).\n\nIn general, objections to the cosmological argument (both historical\nand contemporary) take one of the following forms:\n\nnot every fact requires explanation, and the fact that the\ncosmological arguer is pointing to is one of those;\neach being in the cosmos has an explanation, but the cosmos as an\nentire series does not require an additional explanation,\nover and above the explanations of each member of the series;\nthe sort of explanation required to explain the empirical data\ncited by the cosmological arguer does not amount to a supernatural\nexplanation (e.g., the Big Bang could suffice);\nthe sort of explanation required to explain the empirical data\ncited by the cosmological arguer is not going to deliver anything as\naugust as the God of traditional religious doctrine but rather, in\nHume\u2019s terms, a somewhat \u201cmediocre deity\u201d.\n\n3.2 Teleological or design arguments\n\nThe Greek word \u201ctelos\u201d means \u201cend\u201d or\n\u201cpurpose\u201d. The a posteriori arguments in natural\ntheology that are referred to as \u201cteleological\u201d claim that\nthe natural world displays some sort of purposive or end-directed\ndesign, and that this licenses the conclusion that the natural world\nhas a very powerful and intelligent designer (see the entry on\n teleological arguments for God\u2019s existence).\n Earlier authors dubbed this sort of non-demonstrative, inductive\nargument a \u201cphysico-theological\u201d argument (see, e.g.,\nWilliam Derham 1713). \n\nTeleological arguments can be found in numerous traditions and time\nperiods, including the classical Greek and Roman context (see Sedley\n2008) and the Indian philosophical tradition (see Brown 2008). In the\nwest the argument is primarily associated with William Paley\n(1743\u20131805), although in fact this type of argument was\ndiscussed by numerous early modern figures before him (see Taliaferro\n2005, DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015). The fact that Paley\u2019s 1802 book\nwas called Natural Theology is no doubt part of why natural\ntheology as a whole is sometimes equated with the a\nposteriori investigations of nature for the purposes of\nsupporting religious theses. In the analogy that made Paley\u2019s\nargument famous, the relationship between a watch and a watch-maker is\ntaken to be saliently similar to the relationship between the natural\nworld and its author. If we were to go walking upon the heath and\nstumble upon a watch, a quick examination of its inner workings would\nreveal, with a high probability, that \u201cits several parts were\nframed and put together for a purpose\u201d by what must have been\n\u201can intelligence\u201d (1802: 1\u20136). Likewise with the\nuniverse as a whole. Earlier teleological arguments can be found\nin the works of post-Cartesian atomists like Pierre Gassendi,\nCambridge Platonists like Walter Charleton and Henry More, and\nmechanists like Robert Boyle. Charleton, for instance, argues in his\nThe Darkness of Atheism Dispelled by the Light of Nature: A\nPhysico-Theological Treatise  (1652) that the modern rejection of\nAristotelianism establishes an even greater need to appeal to a\ndesigner to explain how inert atoms under mechanical laws can be\nfashioned into an intelligible and purposive order (see Leech 2013).\n\n\nA different kind of teleological argument is developed by George\nBerkeley (1685\u20131753), for whom natural, physical objects do not\nexist independently of minds, but consist solely in ideas. Given the\nregularity, complexity, and involuntariness of our sensory ideas,\ntheir source (Berkeley argues) must be an infinitely powerful,\nbenevolent mind that produces these ideas in us in a lawlike fashion.\nGod\u2019s existence can also be demonstrated from the harmony and\nbeauty that the ideas of the world display (Berkeley 1710: \u00a7146).\nSince according to Berkeley our ordinary experience is a type of\ndirect divine communication with us, our relationship with God is in\nthis respect especially intimate. Thus he frequently remarks, quoting\nSt. Paul, that \u201cin God we live and move and have our\nbeing\u201d (Acts 17:28).\n3.2.1 Hume on the teleological argument\n\nHume\u2019s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion pre-date\nPaley, of course, but they feature an especially influential and\nelegant critical discussion of teleological arguments (1779), a\ndiscussion of which Paley was no doubt aware. (In fact, Paley may have\nrestyled his argument as an inference-to-best explanation in an effort\nto avoid some of Hume\u2019s criticisms.)\n\nHume\u2019s assault on the teleological argument begins by\nformulating it as follows (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010):\n\nNature is a great machine, composed of lesser machines, all of\nwhich exhibit order (especially adaptation of means to ends).\n[premise]\nMachines caused by human minds exhibit order (especially\nadaptation of means to ends). [premise]\nNature resembles machines caused by human minds. [by (1),\n(2)]\nIf effects resemble each other, their causes resemble each other\nas well. [premise]\nThe cause of nature resembles human minds. [by (3), (4)]\nGreater effects demand greater causes (causes adequate to the\neffects). [premise] \nNature is much greater than machines caused by human minds.\n[premise]\nThe cause of nature resembles but is much greater than human\nminds. [by (5), (6), (7)]\nThe cause of nature is God. [by (8)]\nTherefore, God exists. [by (9)]\n\n\nHume\u2019s objections to this argument include the claims that the\nanalogies on which it is dependent are not exact, and thus that there\nare alternative explanations for order and apparent design in the\nuniverse. One response to these objections is that the teleological\nargument should be conceived as an argument to the best\nexplanation, on the model of many scientific arguments. In that case\nthe analogy need not be exact, but might still show that a theistic\nexplanation is best (and again, Paley himself may have recognized\nthis). Hume, in the voice of his character Philo, concedes\n\n\nthat the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of\nart is evident; and according to all the rules of good reasoning, we\nought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their causes\nhave a proportional analogy. (Part XII)\n\n\nBut Philo also affirms that we cannot infer any important similarities\nbetween humans and the author of nature beyond intelligence, and in\nparticular we cannot infer some of the divine attributes that are most\nimportant for sustaining traditional theistic religion (Part V). Most\nsignificantly, given the evil that there is in the universe, we cannot\nconclude that its designer has the moral qualities traditional\nreligion requires God to have (Part X). Thus, again, we are left with\na rather \u201cmediocre deity\u201d.\n\nOne of Hume\u2019s neglected objections to the teleological argument\nis that it generates an absurd infinite regress (Part IV). If order\nand apparent design in the material universe are explained by divine\nintelligence, what explains the order and apparent design that give\nrise to intelligence in the divine mind? By dint of the reasoning\nemployed in the teleological argument, it would have to be a\nsuper-divine intelligence. But what explains the order and apparent\ndesign that give rise to super-divine intelligence? An absurd infinite\nregress results, and to avoid it one might well suppose the material\nworld \u201ccontain[s] the principle of order within itself\u201d.\n\n\nTo this Hume has the theist Cleanthes reply that\n\n\neven in common life, if I assign a cause for any event, is it any\nobjection that I cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer\nevery new question which may incessantly be started?\n\n\nThis seems right: in scientific theorizing it is no decisive objection\nagainst an explanation that it contains entities that are themselves\nnot fully explained. Crucial to the value of scientific explanations\nis that they supply an explanatory advance, and we can\nreasonably believe that a theory does so without our having in hand\ncomplete explanations for all of the entities it posits. \n3.2.2 The teleological argument from fine-tuning\n\nIn recent decades, some natural theologians have developed an\ninductive argument for the existence of God that appeals to the fact\nthat the fundamental features of the universe are fine-tuned for the\nexistence of life. According to many physicists, the fact that the\nuniverse can support life depends delicately on various of its\nfundamental characteristics, notably the values of certain constants\nof nature, the specific character of certain fundamental laws, and\naspects of the universe\u2019s conditions in its very early stages.\nThe core claim of the argument is that without an intelligent\ndesigner, it would be improbable that the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions were fine-tuned for life.\n\nWilliam Lane Craig (see e.g., Craig 1990, 2003) develops a version of\nthis argument, which proceeds as follows. The world is conditioned\nprincipally by the values of the fundamental constants:\n\na: the fine structure constant, or electromagnetic\ninteraction;\nmn/me: proton to electron mass ratio; \naG: gravitation;\naw: the weak force; and\nas: the strong force.\n\n\nWhen one imagines these constants being different, one discovers that\nin fact the number of observable universes, that is to say, universes\ncapable of supporting intelligent life, is very small. Just a slight\nvariation in any one of these values would render life impossible. For\nexample, if the strong force (as) were increased as much as\n1%, nuclear resonance levels would be so altered that almost all\ncarbon would be burned into oxygen; an increase of 2% would preclude\nformation of protons out of quarks, preventing the existence of atoms.\nFurthermore, weakening the strong force by as much as 5% would unbind\ndeuteron, which is essential to stellar nucleosynthesis, leading to a\nuniverse composed only of hydrogen. It has been estimated that the\nstrong force must be within 0.8 and 1.2 its actual strength or all\nelements of atomic weight greater than four would not have formed. Or\nagain, if the weak force had been appreciably stronger, then the Big\nBang\u2019s nuclear burning would have proceeded past helium to iron,\nmaking fusion-powered stars impossible. But if it had been much\nweaker, then we should have had a universe entirely of helium. Or\nagain, if gravitation aG had been a little greater, all stars\nwould have been red dwarfs, which are too cold to support life-bearing\nplanets. If it had been a little smaller, the universe would have been\ncomposed exclusively of blue giants, which burn too briefly for life\nto develop. This gives us reason to believe that there is an\nintelligent designer who fine-tuned the universe as we actually find\nit.\n\nThe debate surrounding the fine-tuning argument is technically complex\n(a detailed summary is available in the entry on\n fine-tuning).\n Here we discuss some of the most pressing issues.\n\nAs noted, a core claim of the argument as widely understood is that\nthe fine-tuning for life of the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions would be deeply improbable without an intelligent designer\nof the universe. One question concerns the notion of probability at\nwork in this claim. Contemporary accounts usually appeal to an\nepistemic notion of probability (e.g., Monton 2006), by contrast with\nphysical and logical alternatives. On this reading, the core claim is\nthat fine-tuning for life without an intelligent designer is\nimprobable in the sense that we should not expect it without such a\nbeing, or that without such a being we should be surprised that there\nis such fine-tuning.\n\nGiven this understanding of the core improbability claim, some critics\n(e.g., Carlson and Olsson 1998) have argued that the fine-tuning at\nissue requires no explanation. Any specific sequence of heads and\ntails in a long series of coin tosses is improbable in this sense;\nthat is, any one sequence would be one we wouldn\u2019t and\nshouldn\u2019t expect. But no specific sequence requires an\nexplanation other than that it was randomly generated. So why should\nthe finely-tuned actual array of constants, laws, and initial\nconditions require an explanation other than an appeal to randomness?\nMany, however, disagree, and argue that the availability of\nexplanatory hypotheses with intuitive pull, such as an intelligent\ndesigner or a multiverse (discussed below), indicates that a more\nsubstantive explanation for fine-tuning is required (e.g., Leslie\n1989).\n\nA number of critics press the objection that we should not be\nsurprised that we observe features of the universe that are required\nfor our own existence. If the constants, laws, and initial conditions\nwere incompatible with our existence, we would not be here to observe\nthis. In Elliot Sober\u2019s (2003) analysis, what\u2019s at work\nhere is the observer selection effect, which tends to result in a\ncertain bias. In this case, our observations are biased toward\nfine-tuning because we would not have existed to make these\nobservations had the universe not been fine-tuned for life. But any\nbias resulting from an observer selection effect should be factored\nout and set aside, and this is so for the fine-tuning at issue.\n\nCritics of this line of reasoning cite examples in which it appears to\ngoes awry. In John Leslie\u2019s (1989) example, you are dragged\nbefore a firing squad of 100 trained marksmen. The command is given;\nyou hear the deafening sound of the guns. But then there you are,\nsurprised to be observing the aftermath, and that you are still alive.\nNow consider the hypothesis that the marksmen intended to miss, which\nseems a reasonable option for explaining why you\u2019re still alive.\nBut notice that this case features an observation selection effect\nanalogous to the one Sober proposes for fine-tuning: you can\u2019t\nobserve the aftermath unless you survive the firing squad. On\nSober\u2019s recommendation, observation selection effects should be\nfactored out and set aside. But on this recommendation your still\nbeing alive wouldn\u2019t require an explanation, and we\nwouldn\u2019t have reason to accept the explanation that the marksmen\nintended to miss. So, according to the critics, there must be\nsomething wrong with Sober\u2019s analysis. Leslie contends you\nshould in fact be surprised that you observe that you are still alive.\nThat you are alive is in the relevant sense epistemically improbable,\nand requires an explanation. Similarly, we should be surprised that we\nobserve that the universe is fine-tuned for life, and this also\nrequires an explanation. One way to account for Leslie\u2019s\ncontention is that the epistemic probability of fine-tuning should be\njudged from the point of view of a reasoner who brackets or sets aside\nthat she is alive (and that there is any life at all), and then asks\nwhether we should expect that the universe is fine-tuned for life, or\nwhether this should be surprising (see Howson 1991, Collins 2009, and\nKotzen 2012 for views of this sort). Similarly, in the firing-squad\ncase, I should judge whether my surviving is epistemically probable\nfrom a point of view in which I bracket or set aside that I am still\nalive, and then ask whether I should expect that I am still alive or\nwhether this should be surprising.\n\n\nLeslie (1989) proposes that the hypothesis of multiple universes,\ni.e., of the multiverse, would provide an explanation for fine-tuning\nfor life. Here is his analogy (which involves guns again, oddly). You\nare alone at night in an extremely dark forest when a gun is fired\nfrom far away and you are hit. If you assume that there is no one out\nto get you, this would be surprising. But now suppose that you were\nnot in fact alone, but instead part of a large crowd (which you do not\nsee because it\u2019s so dark). In that case, Leslie suggests, you\nwould be less surprised at being shot, since it seems at least\nsomewhat likely that a gunman would be trying to shoot someone in the\ncrowd. Leslie suggests that this story supports the multiverse\nexplanation for the universe being fine-tuned for life.\n\nRoger White (2000) contends that there is a problem with\nLeslie\u2019s account. While the multiverse hypothesis would explain\nwhy there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned for\nlife, since it would raise the probability of that hypothesis, it\nwould not similarly explain why this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. He contends that supposing that the gunman was firing at\nrandom, being part of a large crowd explains\u2014raises the\nprobability\u2014that someone or other is shot, but\nnot that you are shot. By contrast, the hypothesis that the\ngunman was aiming at you, as opposed to firing at random, does explain\nin this way that you are shot. Similarly, the multiverse hypothesis\nexplains that there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned\nfor life, but not that this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. By contrast, in White\u2019s view the hypothesis of an\nintelligent designer does explain why\u2014raises the\nprobability\u2014that this universe is fine-tuned for life. White\nargues:\n\n\nPostulate as many other universes as you wish, they do not make it any\nmore likely that ours should be life-permitting or that we should be\nhere. So our good fortune to exist in a life-permitting universe gives\nus no reason to suppose that there are many universes (White 2000:\n274; see Rota 2005 for another theistic response to the multiverse\nhypothesis).\n See the\n fine-tuning\n entry for more detail on this exchange, and on other issues raised in\nthe debate.\n\n3.3 Arguments from religious experience\n\nArguments for the existence of God from a special kind of experience\nare often called \u201carguments from religious experience\u201d.\nSome philosophers and theologians have argued that our ordinary human\ncognitive faculties include what John Calvin called a special\n\u201csense of divinity\u201d that, when not impeded or blocked,\nwill deliver immediately justified beliefs about supernatural entities\n(Plantinga 1981, 1984). Some such thinkers, then, might construe an\nargument from religious experience as belonging to the category of\nnatural religion or natural theology. Others, however, insist that\n\u201ccharacteristic of the Continental Calvinist tradition is a\nrevulsion against arguments in favor of theism or Christianity\u201d\n(Wolterstorff 1984: 7; see also Sudduth 2009). In any case, most\nauthors who write about religious experience generally construe it as\ncaused by something other than our ordinary faculties and their\nintersubjectively available objects, and thus do not think of it as\none of the topics of natural theology (see Davis 1989, Alston 1991,\nKwan 2006).\n\nSee the entry on\n religious experience\n for expansive discussion of this issue.\n4. \u201cRamified\u201d Natural Theology\n\nSome supporters of natural religion or natural theology seek to use\nour ordinary cognitive faculties to support theses that are more\nrobust and specific than those of generic or\n\u201cperfect-being\u201d theism. This project has recently been\ndubbed \u201cramified\u201d natural theology by Richard Swinburne\n(see Holder 2013). A few of these efforts involve a priori\nargumentation: an ancient argument for the Trinity (found in St.\nAugustine (De Trinitate, c. 399\u2013419, Book IX), and\nRichard of St. Victor (De Trinitate, c. 1162\u20131173,\nIII.1\u201325)) is that any supreme being would have to be a\nsupremely loving being, and any omnipotent supremely loving being\nwould ultimately have to emanate from itself something that is both\nother and yet just as supreme and lovable as itself, and that a third\nsuch person would be necessary as a kind of product of that love\nbetween the first two. Marilyn McCord Adams\u2019s books on theodicy\n(Adams 2000, 2006) and Eleonore Stump\u2019s Gifford Lectures (Stump\n2010) constitute an effort to consider the a priori problem\nof evil from within the context of a ramified (and thus in this case\nmore robustly Christian) kind of natural theology.\n\nBut most ramified natural theology is inductive in spirit: thus Hugo\nGrotius divides his De veritate religionis Christianae (1627)\ninto a first book that deals with classical natural theology but then\nlater books that deal specifically with the truth of Christianity.\nJohn Locke (1695) argued for the \u201cReasonableness of\nChristianity\u201d using a broadly historical, probabilistic\napproach. William Paley (1794) further developed this approach, and\nmuch more recently Swinburne argued for the conclusion that\nBayesian-style reasoning justifies belief in the resurrection of Jesus\nwith a probability of 97% (Swinburne 2003). Numerous other\nphilosophers (and also many natural scientists) appeal to historical\nand scientific data as well as empirical and statistical principles of\nreasoning to support the authenticity of various biblical claims, the\nprobability of various miracle stories, and so forth (see e.g., Olding\n1990; Polkinghorne 2009; Gauch Jr. 2011). Note that this is a way of\nappealing to the content of sacred texts and special revelation which\nis consistent with the methods of natural theology: the prophetic or\nhistorical claims of those texts are evaluated using public evidence\nand accepted canons of inductive reasoning. Still, even optimistic\nnatural theologians like Locke, Paley, Swinburne, and these others\ncount as hybridists insofar as they think there are some important\ndoctrines about the divine that cannot be justified by our natural\ncognitive faculties. Thus even they will at some point be willing (in\nKant\u2019s famous phrase) to \u201cdeny knowledge in order to leave\nroom for faith\u201d (1787, Bxxx).",
