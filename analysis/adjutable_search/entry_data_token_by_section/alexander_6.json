In a\nlate series of papers, including Spinoza and Time\n(1921a) and \u201cLessons from Spinoza\u201d (1927), Alexander\nreconstructs his system as a \u201cgloss\u201d of Spinoza.\n\nAlexander argues that philosophy and physics has only just begun to\n\u201cTake time seriously\u201d and, had Spinoza been aware of\nthese developments, his ontology would ultimately have resembled\nAlexander\u2019s. Alexander particularly refers to the thesis that\nspace and time should be combined into the four dimensional manifold\nspacetime.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s Ethics argues there is only one substance, and\nthis substance is identical with God and nature. The substance has an\ninfinite number of attributes, including spatial extension, and it\nsupports an infinity of dependent modes. Alexander argues that his\nsystem is similar to Spinoza\u2019s except that he understands the\nsingle substance\u2014Motion\u2014to have only two attributes, space\nand time.\n\n\nIn our gloss upon Spinoza the ultimate reality is full of Time, not\ntimeless but essentially alive with Time, and the theatre of incessant\nchange. It is only timeless in the sense that taken as a whole it is\nnot particularised to any one moment of duration, but comprehends them\nall\u2026 Reality is Space-Time or motion itself, infinite or\nself-contained and having nothing outside itself. (Alexander 1921a:\n39)\n\n\nAlexander argues his gloss solves problems\nin Spinoza\u2019s original system. He also praises Spinoza for\nsuccessfully combining religious values and naturalism (Alexander\n1927: 14). Alexander concludes one of his pieces on this topic by\nsaying that he takes pride in the similarity between his system and\nSpinoza\u2019s (Alexander 1921a: 79). Alexander was corresponding at\nthis time with the Spinoza scholar Harold Joachim.\n\nThere is very little secondary literature on this aspect of\nAlexander\u2019s thought, although Thomas (2013) has argued Alexander\nis best understood through Spinoza.\n",
