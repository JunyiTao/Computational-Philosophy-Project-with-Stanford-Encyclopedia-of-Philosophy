    "main_text": "Einstein\n2. Einstein\n\nEinstein\u2019s Special Theory of Relativity (STR) is notionally\nbased on a principle of relativity of motion; but that principle is\n\u2018special\u2019 \u2013 meaning, restricted. The relativity\nprinciple built into STR is in fact nothing other than the Galilean\nprinciple of relativity, which is built into Newtonian\n physics.[3]\n In other words, while there is no privileged standard of velocity,\nthere is nevertheless a determinate fact of the matter about whether a\nbody has accelerated or non-accelerated (i.e., inertial) motion. In\nthis regard, the spacetime of STR is exactly like Galilean spacetime\n(discussed in the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 5). In terms of the question of whether all motion can be\nconsidered purely relative, one could argue that there is nothing new\nbrought to the table by the introduction of Einstein\u2019s STR\n\u2013 at least, as far as mechanics is concerned. (See the entry on\n space and time: inertial frames\n for a more detailed discussion.)\n",
