    "main_text": "\n\n\nAnd if I claim to be a wise man,\n\nWell, it surely means that I don't know.\n\n\u2014Kansas\n\n\nIt is possible to direct doubt at oneself over many things. One can\ndoubt one\u2019s own motives, or one\u2019s competence to drive a\ncar. One can doubt that one is up to the challenge of fighting a\nserious illness. Epistemic self-doubt is the special case where what\nwe doubt is our ability to achieve an epistemically favorable state,\nfor example, to achieve true beliefs. Given our obvious fallibility,\nepistemic self-doubt seems a natural thing to engage in, and there is\ndefinitely nothing logically problematic about doubting someone\nelse\u2019s competence to judge. However when we turn such doubt on\nourselves, incoherence seems to threaten because one is using\none\u2019s judgment to make a negative assessment of one\u2019s\njudgment. Even if this kind of self-doubt can be seen as coherent,\nthere are philosophical challenges concerning how to resolve the inner\nconflict involved in such a judgment, whether one\u2019s initial\njudgment or one\u2019s doubt should win, and why.\n\nSome ways of doubting that we are in a favorable epistemic state are\neasy to understand and unproblematic. Socrates was confident that he\ndid not know the answers to his most important questions. He believed\nhe did not have the answers, or the right kind of grasp of answers,\nthat would be required for knowledge of what, for example, piety,\nvirtue, and justice are. This recognition led him to avoid endorsing\nor believing particular answers to his questions, and motivated him to\ngo around town asking others for their answers and making awkward\nobservations about their replies. Though the authorities prosecuted\nhim for this, his offense was not an epistemic irrationality; the\nbelief states he had\u2014doubt about himself that he knew the\nanswers, and lack of confidence in particular answers\u2014fit\ntogether sensibly. Moreover, as Socrates told his interlocutors, his\nacknowledgment that he did not know had the salutary effect of making\nit possible for him to find out. If he were sure that he already knew,\nthen he would not have motivation to look for the answer.\n\nNot all epistemic self-doubt is so evidently constructive. Socrates\ncould hope to find his answers in the future in part because his doubt\nwas not directed at his faculties for gaining knowledge, and the\nmatters on which he believed himself ignorant were specific and\nlimited. This left him confident of his tools, and still in possession\nof a lot of knowledge to work with in seeking his answers. For\nexample, it was possible for Socrates to be both sure he did not know\nwhat virtue was and yet confident that it was something beneficial to\nthe soul. In contrast, Descartes in his Meditations set out\nto rid himself of all beliefs in order to rebuild his edifice of\nbelief from scratch, so as to avoid all possibility of erroneous\nfoundations. He did so by finding reason to doubt the soundness of his\nfaculty of, for example, sense perception. Instead of casting doubt on\nhis empirical beliefs one by one, he would doubt the reliability of\ntheir source and that would blanket all of them with suspicion,\nloosening the hold that even basic perceptual beliefs had on his mind.\nDescartes\u2019 epistemic self-doubt was extreme in undermining trust\nin a belief-forming faculty, and in the wide scope of beliefs that\nwere thereby called into question. As in the case of Socrates though,\nhis belief states fit together sensibly; as he convinced himself he\nmight be dreaming, thus undermining his trust that he was in a\nposition to know he had hands, he was also shaken out of his belief\nthat he had hands.\n\nThe cases of Socrates and Descartes illustrate that judgments about\none\u2019s own epistemic state and capacity can provide reasons to\nadjust one\u2019s beliefs about the way things are. Less dramatic\ncases abound in which rationality\u2019s demand for some kind of fit\nbetween one\u2019s beliefs (first-order beliefs) and one\u2019s\nbeliefs about one\u2019s beliefs (second-order beliefs) can be seen\nin the breach. Suppose I am a medical doctor who has just settled on a\ndiagnosis of embolism for a patient when someone points out to me that\nI haven\u2019t slept in 36 hours (Christensen 2010a). On reflection I\nrealize that she is right, and if I am rational then I will feel some\npressure to believe that my judgment might be impaired, reduce\nsomewhat my confidence in the embolism diagnosis, and re-check my\nwork-up of the case or ask for a colleague\u2019s opinion.\n\nThough it seems clear in this case that some reconsideration of the\nfirst-order matter is required, it is not immediately clear how strong\nthe authority of the second-order might be compared to the first order\nin coming to an updated belief about the diagnosis, and there are\nclear cases where the second order should not prevail. If someone\ntells me I have unwittingly ingested a hallucinogenic drug, then that\nimposes some prima facie demand for further thought on my part, but if\nI know the person is a practical joker and he has a smirk on his face,\nthen it seems permissible not to reconsider my first-order beliefs.\nThere are also cases where it is not obvious which order should\nprevail. Suppose I\u2019m confident that the murderer is #3 in the\nline-up because I witnessed the murder at close range. Then I learn of\nthe empirical literature saying that eyewitnesses are generally\noverconfident, especially when they witnessed the event in a state of\nstress (Roush 2009: 252\u20133). It seems I should doubt my\nidentification, but how can it be justified to throw out my\nfirst-order evidence that came from directly seeing that person, in\nperson and close up? An adjudication of some sort between the first\norder and the higher order is required, but it is not obvious what the\ngeneral rules might be for determining the outcome of the conflict, or\nwhat exactly would justify them.\n\nQuestions about epistemic self-doubt can be organized into five\nover-arching questions: 1) Can the doubting itself, a state of having\na belief state and doubting that it is the right one to have, be\nrational? 2) What is the source of the authority of second-order\nbeliefs? 3) Are there general rules for deciding which level should\nwin the tug of war? If so, what is their justification? 4) What does\nthe matching relation this adjudication is aiming at consist in? 5) If\nmismatch between the levels can be rational when one first acquires\nreason to doubt, is it also rationally permitted to remain in a\nlevel-splitting state\u2014also known as epistemic akrasia\n(Owens 2002)\u2014in which the self-doubting conflict is\nmaintained?\n\nFor convenience, approaches to modeling doubt about one\u2019s own\nability to judge and to the five questions above can be separated into\nfour types, which are overlapping and complementary rather than\ninconsistent. One approach is through seeing the self-doubting subject\nas believing epistemically unflattering categorical statements about\nthe relation of her beliefs to the world. Another is through\nconditional principles, asking what a subject\u2019s credence in\nq should be given that she has a particular credence in\nq but thinks she may be epistemically inadequate or\ncompromised. A third approach is to construe doubt about one\u2019s\njudgment as a matter of respecting evidence about oneself and\none\u2019s evidence (higher-order evidence). A fourth approach ties\ntogether the first order and second order by using the idea that we\nshould match our confidence in p to our expected reliability.\nThat is, treating ourselves like measuring instruments we should aim\nto be calibrated.\n",
