    "main_text": "Justice and Public Health || Justice and Stigma\n2.5 Justice and Stigma\n\nAs we noted in sections 2.3 and 2.4, not all issues of justice in\npublic health are captured by challenges in the setting of priorities\nor the allocation of resources. What to do about individual\nresponsibility is one such issue; another is whether some public\nhealth interventions unfairly stigmatize certain groups. There are\nlots of ways to think about stigmatization, but at its core to\nstigmatize is to deem some characteristic or behavior of others as\nfalling short of communal norms of desirability (see Courtwright 2011;\nBayer 2008; Burris 2008; Link and Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, and Link\n2013). Typically, stigmatization has a distinctive set of negative\nconsequences, especially loss of social status and social\nisolation. Many claim that to stigmatize someone is morally wrong\nbecause of the harms stigmatization causes. Depending on your account\nof justice, stigmatization can also be unjust, particularly when the\nstigmatizing actor is the state or some other powerful institutions or\nagents.  Stigmatizing by powerful actors can reinforce structural\npatterns of disadvantage and unfair power relations, and it can also\nfail to treat members of stigmatized groups as moral equals (Powers\nand Faden 2019, 35\u201336).\n\nConcerns about stigmatization in public health can emerge in a range\nof public health policies, including when some groups are identified\nas \u201cat increased risk\u201d for diseases that have socially\ncontentious associations and are themselves stigmatizing. For example,\nalthough itself unfair, in some contexts, people with mental illness\nand AIDs continue to be shunned and worse. Being labeled as at\nincreased risk for these illnesses carries with it the potential for\nstigmatizing effects. Questions about targeting public health\ninterventions become all the more complex when the stigmatizing\neffects would be borne by already disadvantaged groups. On the one\nhand, tailoring a public health program to those who are poor or\nmembers of disadvantaged gender or racial groups can sometimes serve\nequity concerns and be efficient if, for example, the health problem\nthe intervention targets occurs disproportionately in these groups. On\nthe other hand, however, if the health problem is itself associated\nwith stigma or shame, targeting these already disadvantaged groups may\nreinforce existing invidious stereotypes, thereby undermining other\ncritical concerns of justice, such as equality of social respect\n(Powers and Faden 2008). Thus, in cases where interventions will\nincidentally stigmatize already disadvantaged groups, public health\nauthorities face a different kind of efficiency vs. equity challenge\nfrom those already mentioned. They may need to decide whether a\ncommitment to justice requires foregoing a more efficient, targeted\nprogram in favor of a relatively inefficient, universal program that\nmay produce not only less improvement in health for the population as\na whole but also less improvement in health for the disadvantaged\ngroups (thus failing to narrow unjust inequalities) in order to avoid\nexacerbating existing disrespectful social attitudes (Faden, Kass, and\nPowers 1991).\n\nAnother context in which stigma concerns emerge is in public health\neducation campaigns. The methodology for these campaigns often entails\nnot only informing the public about the health risks or benefits of\nparticular behaviors but also changing public attitudes in ways that\ndispose the public to feel more negatively about those who engage or\nfail to engage in them. One way of interpreting what is going on is\nthat an aim of the public health campaign is to shift public values\ntowards the stigmatizing of unhealthy behaviors or ways of life. Some\ncontributors to the public health ethics literature endorse measures\nthat are intended to stigmatize certain unhealthy conduct such as\ncondomless sex, smoking, or various unhealthy eating habits\n(Courtwright 2011; Kim and Shanahan 2003; Brown-Johnson and Prochaska\n2015) or even certain conditions, such as obesity (Callahan 2013). The\nargument in defense of public health implementing interventions that\nintentionally stigmatize turns on several assumptions, including that\nthe public health problem of concern (e.g. obesity) constitutes an\ninjustice and that intentional stigmatization will be very if not\nuniquely effective in reducing the problem and its associated unjust\neffects.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sort of argument is extremely controversial and\nhas led to heated debates. Some object on empirical grounds; for\nexample, that there is insufficient evidence that intentional\nstigmatization is effective at reducing the prevalence of health\nproblems (Goldberg and Puhl 2013) or that there is some evidence to\nsuggest that stigmatization can actually increase the prevalence of a\nconcerning behavior (Goldberg and Puhl 2013; Burris 2008.). Still\nothers object because of the psychological or social harm that is\ncaused to individuals who have the relevant condition or engage in the\nconcerning behavior (Burris 2008; Goldberg and Puhl 2013) or that any\nuse of stigmatization is dehumanizing and morally unacceptable for\nthat reason (Burris 2008). A related objection is that stigmatization\nis reductive; it treats someone as nothing more than a particular\n\u2018spoiled social identity\u2019 \u2013 those who smoke\ncigarettes are thought of as smokers; individuals with obesity are\njust viewed as obese (Burris 2008; Nussbaum 2004).\n\nYet another line of objection engages victim-blaming concerns similar\nto those raised against policies that would penalize those who engage\nin unhealthy behaviors. This objection challenges the arguments in\ndefense of stigma as a public health tool by highlighting that the\nindividuals and groups to be stigmatized are the ones subject to the\ninjustice. In particular, there are significant concerns about whether\nstigmatization involves victim-blaming, encourages a culture of\nvictim-blaming, punishes individuals who are unhealthy because they\nare unjustly socially disadvantaged or for other reasons that are\ncompletely outside their control. As with the debate about individual\nresponsibility, there are often discussions about the underlying\ncauses of the relevant behavior that public health interventions aim\nto prevent. For example, if unjust social structures are a root cause\nof obesity in some group, then encouraging the use of stigmatizing\nmessaging or changing social norms to encourage feelings of shame in\nthose who are or might become obese amounts to shaming people for\nbeing subject to other injustices (Goldberg and Puhl 2013). Similarly,\nto the extent that genetic or metabolic considerations are a root\ncause of obesity in some people, then stigmatizing interventions are\nalso unjust.\n\nAlthough some continue to defend stigmatization in public health\ndespite these objections (Callahan 2013), others have provided more\nmoderate defenses of various stigmatizing measures by emphasizing that\nthere can be morally important differences between different targets\nof stigmatization. So, for instance, campaigns aimed at stigmatizing\ncondom-less sex seem from a justice perspective to be relatively\nunproblematic. This kind of campaign targets a wide range of people\nand groups and does not tightly track social disadvantage. Nor does it\ndehumanize people who have certain illnesses or lifestyles or reduce\nthem to some single feature or condition. Stigmatizing obesity, on the\nother hand, does engage important concerns about justice. Obesity is a\nmedical condition and a bodily characteristic of people rather than a\nbehavior, and even if effective, stigmatizing obesity causes\nsignificant harm to people who are already stigmatized for their size\nin many social contexts (Courtwright 2013).\n",
