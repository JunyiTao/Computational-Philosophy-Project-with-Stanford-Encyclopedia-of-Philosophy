    "main_text": "Controversies\n8. Controversies\n\nHumboldt\u2019s cross-sectional profile of Chimborazo\u2014the\nTableau physique\u2014shows the zone occurrence of plant\nlife at different altitudes. It thus served as the foundation for\nHumboldt\u2019s law of vegetational distribution, which claims that\nchanges in plants in relation to latitude match those by altitude.\nSome have argued that Humboldt learned this practice of depicting\nvegetation at different altitudes from the South American scientists\nhe met\u2014in particular, the Colombian Francisco Jos\u00e9 de\nCaldas (1768\u20131816).\n\nCaldas joined Humboldt\u2019s party in 1801 for several weeks, and it\nappears that this period was fruitful for Humboldt and Bonpland, as\nwell as for Caldas. From Humboldt and Bonpland, Caldas learned the\nformal elements of botany (Appel 1994). Caldas, in turn, taught\nHumboldt about the novel method he developed to measure air-pressure\nin relation to vegetation, and it is likely that he also shared with\nHumboldt maps he made in order to depict visually the distribution of\nvegetation.\n\nWhile Humboldt acknowledges Caldas\u2019s innovative method of\nmeasuring air-pressure, he does not discuss Caldas\u2019s maps. This,\nas some have contended, may have to do with Humboldt\u2019s desire to\npresent his own maps\u2014in particular, the Tableau\nphysique\u2014as entirely original (Serje 2005). Accordingly,\nthe question has arisen concerning Humboldt\u2019s originality. In\nother words, the question, in Jorge Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra\u2019s\nwords, is: \u201chow derivative was Humboldt?\u201d\n(Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra 2006). \n\nOne answer to this question, given by Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra,\nconsiders the extent to which Caldas himself was original. For it\nappears that Caldas\u2019 way of presenting the relation between\nvegetation, climate, and altitude, and depicting it on maps, was a\nwidespread practice in late eighteenth-century South America,\nparticularly in the Andes, which were regarded as a\n\u201cmicrocosm\u201d of the universe. The assumption was that\nstudying Andean vegetation in relation to latitude would yield\nknowledge about other similar environments (Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra\n2006). Thus, while the fact that Humboldt does not acknowledge his\ndebts is problematic, these debts may not be specifically to\nCaldas\u2014but to South American researchers and mapmakers more\ngenerally, whose practices most likely provided inspiration for\nHumboldt\u2019s own. \n\nAnother questionable aspect of Humboldt\u2019s thinking came to the\nfore following the publication of Mary Louise Pratt\u2019s\ninfluential study on imperialistic modes of knowing, seeing, and\npresenting. As Pratt sees it, Humboldt\u2019s vision of South\nAmerica, as presented in Ansichten der Natur, problematically\nerases the peoples living in South America by focusing entirely on a\npresentation of nature. Accordingly, Pratt contends, Humboldt\u2019s\nwriting directly or indirectly supported an imperialist agenda of\nterra nullius. Pratt writes: \n\n\nThree images in particular, all canonized by Humboldt\u2019s\nViews, combined to form the standard metonymic presentation\nof the \u201cnew continent\u201d: superabundant tropical\nforests\u2026snow-capped mountains\u2026and vast interior plains.\n\n\n\nTo this she adds: \n\n\nWhat is shared with scientific travel writing is the erasure of the\nhuman\u2026 The human inhabitants of the Llanos are absent.\n(Pratt 1992: 125) \n\n\nPratt\u2019s analysis has, however, come under criticism, above all\nfor its failure to consider Humboldt\u2019s other works. Most\nrelevant in this regard are the Essai politique sur le royaume de\nNouvelle-Espagne, which, as Nicolaas Rukpe notes, was the work\nthat brought Humboldt to prominence and made him a household name\n(Rupke 1999), and the Essai politique sur l\u2019ile de\nCuba. The latter includes a chapter on slavery, which details the\nsituation of slaves on Cuban plantations, and decries their treatment,\nwhile the Essai politique sur le royaume de Nouvelle-Espagne\nincludes detailed descriptions of the cultures of the Indigenous\npeoples of South America, and seeks to reconstruct these cultures\nprior to contact. Humboldt\u2019s presentation of pre-contact\nIndigenous Americans, as Lee Schweninger has shown, reveals them to be\ndeeply cultured, possessing a clear sense of their own history, with\nsophisticated writing systems and arts comparable to the best European\nworks (Schweninger 2016). Or, in Humboldt\u2019s words, Indigenous\nAmerican pre-contact arts and writing systems \u201care strikingly\nsimilar to many monuments of the most civilized nations\u201d\n(Nouvelle-Espagne 1: 82; KNS 1: 235).\n\nFurthermore, while Pratt is right to note that Ansichten der\nNatur does not offer a detailed examination of the human\ninhabitants, strewn throughout the text are remarks that\u2014like\nthe one above\u2014emphasize the creativity of Indigenous Americans\nand compare their cultures favorably to European culture (Schweninger\n2016).\n",
