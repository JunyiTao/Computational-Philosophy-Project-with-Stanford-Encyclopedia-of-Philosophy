    "main_text": "Alternative Non-deductive Methods || Probabilistic Proofs\n3.4 Probabilistic Proofs\n\nThere is a small, but growing, subset of mathematical methods which\nare essentially probabilistic in nature. In the context of\njustification, these methods do not deductively imply their conclusion\nbut rather establish that there is some (often precisely specifiable)\nhigh probability that the conclusion is true. Philosophical discussion\nof these methods began with Fallis (1997, 2002), while Berry (2019) is\na useful recent contribution to the debate. \n\nOne type of probabilistic method links back to the earlier discussion\nof experimental mathematics in that it involves performing experiments\nin a quite literal sense. The idea is to harness the processing power\nof DNA to effectively create a massively parallel computer for solving\ncertain otherwise intractable combinatorial problems. The most famous\nof these is the \u2018Traveling Salesman\u2019 problem, which\ninvolves determining whether there is some possible route through the\nnodes of a graph connected by unidirectional arrows that visits each\nnode exactly once. Adleman (1994) shows how the problem can be coded\nusing strands of DNA which can then be spliced and recombined using\ndifferent chemical reactions. The appearance of certain longer DNA\nstrands at the end of the process corresponds to the finding of a\nsolution path through the graph. Probabilistic considerations come in\nmost clearly in the case where no longer DNA strands are found. This\nindicates that there is no path through the graph, but even if the\nexperiment is carried out correctly the support here falls short of\nfull certainty. For there is a small chance that there is a solution\nbut that it fails to be coded by any DNA strand at the start of the\nexperiment.\n\nThere are also probabilistic methods in mathematics which are not\nexperimental in the above sense. For example, there are properties of\ncomposite (i.e. non-prime) numbers which can be shown to hold in\nrelation to about half of the numbers less than a given composite\nnumber. If various numbers smaller than N are selected at\nrandom and none of them bear this relation to N, then it\nfollows that N is almost certainly prime. The level of\nprobability here can be precisely calculated, and can be made as high\nas needed by picking more \u2018witness\u2019 numbers to test.\n\nNote that these sorts of probabilistic methods contain plenty of\npurely deductive reasoning. Indeed, in the second example, the fact\nthat the probability of N being prime is .99 is established\npurely deductively. Nonetheless, there is general consensus in the\nmathematical community that such methods are not acceptable\nsubstitutes for deductive proof of the conclusion. Fallis (1997, 2002)\nargues that this rejection is not reasonable because any property of\nprobabilistic methods that can be pointed to as being problematic is\nshared by some proofs that the mathematical community does accept.\nFallis\u2019s focus is on establishing truth as the key epistemic\ngoal of mathematics. However it seems plausible that one major reason\nfor mathematicians\u2019 dissatisfaction with probabilistic methods\nis that they do not explain why their conclusions are true.\nIn addition, Easwaran argues, against Fallis, that there is a\nproperty, which he terms \u2018transferability\u2019, that\nprobabilistic proofs lack and acceptable proofs have (Easwaran 2009;\nJackson 2009). Fallis (2011) is a reply to some of these\nobjections.\n\nOn the other hand, there may be cases where the bare truth or falsity\nof a claim is important even in the absence of accompanying\nexplanation. For example, one could imagine a situation in which an\nimportant and interesting conjecture\u2014say the Riemann\nHypothesis\u2014is being considered, and a probabilistic method is\nused to show that some number is very likely a counterexample to it.\nIt is interesting to speculate what the reaction of the mathematical\ncommunity might be to this situation. Would work on trying to prove RH\ncease? Would it continue until a rigorous deductive proof of the\ncounterexample is constructed?\n",
