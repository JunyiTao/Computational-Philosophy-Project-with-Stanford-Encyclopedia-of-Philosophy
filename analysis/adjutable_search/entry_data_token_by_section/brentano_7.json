Brentano\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nEven though Brentano worked on problems in metaphysics and ontology\nthroughout his life, he hardly published on these topics during his\nlifetime. The impact of his views is due to the fact that from his\nearly lectures at the University of W\u00fcrzburg on he discussed them\nwith his students, both in class and (especially in later years) in\ncorrespondence. \n\nEven though Brentano\u2019s views have underwent considerable changes\nover the years, his general attitude can be characterized as sober,\nparsimonious, and (in the current use of the term) nominalistic; at no\npoint did he admit the existence of universals, he rather relied on\nmereological principles to account for classical problems in ontology.\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s early metaphysics, which is the result of his\ncritical reading of Aristotle, is a form of conceptualism. He does\ndistinguish between substance and accidents, but argues that both are\nbut fictions cum fundamentum in re. With this, he wants to\nsuggest that they do not have actual existence, but that we can make\njudgments about real things that are correct and contain references to\nsubstances and accidents. This view is closely connected to his\nepistemic notion of truth, according to which the question of whether\na judgment is true does not depend on its corresponding to reality,\nbut rather on whether it can be judged with evidence. Brentano\nelucidates the relation between a thing and its properties on the\nbasis of the mereological notions of \u201clogical part\u201d and\n\u201cmetaphysical part,\u201d the former of which account for\nabstract, repeatable properties, the latter for the concrete\nproperties of a thing. Both are not considered to be denizens of\nreality in a narrow sense, but rather fictions that have a foundation\nin reality. (For a reconstruction and discussion of the details of\nBrentano\u2019s early ontology, cf. Chrudzimski 2004).\n\nAfter the introduction of the notion of intentionality in his\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874), Brentano\nstruggled to account for the ontological status of the intentional\nobject. When he first introduces the notion, suggesting, as we have\nseen above, that \u201c[e]very mental phenomenon includes something\nas object within itself\u201d (PES, 88), he seems to be\ninterested primarily in presenting a psychological thesis and does not\nseem to be overly worried with its ontological implications; at this\npoint, the talk of an \u201cimmanent object\u201d might have been a\nmere fa\u00e7on de parler(cf. Chrudzimski and Smith, 2003,\n205). Soon Brentano finds himself in the need, however, to address\nthis question and, as a result, to enrich the domain of objects in his\nontology. He seems to admit that next to concrete things there are\nirrealia, that is, objects that to not really exist but have\nthe status of thought-objects or, as he puts it, entia\nrationis, that do not have an essence and do not stand in causal\nrelations. Brentano does not systematically elaborate his ontological\nposition in this period, we rather find a bundle of ideas of which he\ndid not seem to be fully convinced. This underlines that the\nformulation of these views was not made with the intention to make a\ncontribution to ontology, but rather to reply to concerns that have\nemerged from his introduction of the notion of intentionality. \n\nIn his late philosophy, from 1904 on, Brentano rediscovers the virtue\nof ontological parsimony and takes up the main insights of his\nconceptualist period, developing (and radicalizing) them to a form of\n reism,\n according to which the only items that exist are individual things\n(res). \u201cWhile young Brentano tried to ontologically\nplay down certain ways of speaking, late Brentano tried to eliminate\nthem from philosophical discourse\u201d (Chrudzimski 2004, 177) [my\ntranslation. \u201cDer junge Brentano versuchte gewisse\nRedeweisen ontologisch zu bagatellisieren, der sp\u00e4te\nBrentano versuchte sie aus dem philosophischen Diskurs zu\neliminieren\u201d] . He abandons the notion of\nirrealia, which he now regards as linguistic fictions, and\ncontinues to deny the existence of universals or abstract entities.\nInstead, he conceives both substances and accidents as real things\nthat are related to one another by a particular mereological relation:\nan accident does not only ontologically depend on the substance, it\nalso contains the substance as a part without, however, containing any\nsupplementary part. A white table, accordingly, is an accident that\ncontains the table as a part. If we were to paint it red, the white\ntable would cease to exist and the red table would come into existence\n\u2013 the continuity between the two being guaranteed by the table,\nwhich was part of the white table and is now part of the red table.\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s ontology is known to a broader audience only through\nposthumously published works that were edited by his late students\nOskar Kraus and Alfred Kastil, who considered his late position most\nimportant and accordingly put less emphasis on Brentano\u2019s\nearlier phases. Only recently the development of Brentano\u2019s\nviews on ontology has gained more attention, mainly through the work\nof scholars who were able to study unpublished manuscripts in the\narchives (cf., for example, Chrudzimski 2004). This underlines once\nmore the need of a critical edition of Brentano\u2019s entire\nNachlass, which would make it possible for a broader audience\nto critically assess the development of Brentano\u2019s views in\nontology. \n",
