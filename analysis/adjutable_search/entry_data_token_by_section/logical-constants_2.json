    "main_text": "A Davidsonian approach\n3. A Davidsonian approach\n\n\nThe Quinean approach identifies the logical constants as the\nexpressions that play a privileged, \u201cstructural\u201d role in a systematic\ngrammatical theory for a language. An alternative approach, due to\nQuine\u2019s student\n Donald Davidson,\n identifies the logical constants as the expressions that play a\nprivileged, \u201cstructural\u201d role in a systematic theory of\nmeaning for a language. A Davidsonian theory of meaning takes\nthe form of a\n Tarskian truth theory.\n Thus, it contains two kinds of axioms: base clauses that\nspecify the satisfaction conditions of atomic\n sentences,[6]\n and recursive\nclauses that specify the satisfaction conditions of complex\nsentences in terms of the satisfaction conditions of their proper\n parts.[7]\n For example:\n\n\nBase Clauses:\n\nFor all assignments \\(a\\), Ref(\u201cBill Clinton\u201d, \\(a\\)) =\nBill Clinton.\nFor all assignments \\(a\\), Ref(\u201cHilary Clinton\u201d, \\(a\\)) =\nHilary Clinton.\nIf \\(\\upsilon\\) is a variable, then for all assignments \\(a\\),\nRef(\\(\\upsilon\\), \\(a\\)) = \\(a(\\upsilon)\\), the value \\(a\\) assigns to \\(\\upsilon\\).\nFor all terms \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\sigma\\), and all assignments \\(a\\),\n\\(\\cq{\\tau \\text{ is taller than } \\sigma}\\)\n is satisfied by \\(a\\) iff Ref(\\(\\tau\\), \\(a\\)) is taller than\nRef(\\(\\sigma\\), \\(a\\)). \n\nRecursive Clauses:\n\nFor all assignments \\(a\\) and all sentences \\(\\phi, \\psi\\),\n  \\(\\cq{\\phi \\text{ or } \\psi}\\)\n  is satisfied by \\(a\\) iff \\(\\phi\\) is satisfied by \\(a\\) or \\(\\psi\\)\n  is satisfied by \\(a\\).\nFor all assignments \\(a\\), all sentences \\(\\phi, \\psi\\), and all\n  variables \\(\\upsilon\\),\n  \\(\\cq{[\\text{Some}~\\upsilon : \\phi]~\\psi }\\)\n is satisfied by \\(a\\) iff there is an assignment\n \\(a'\\) that differs from \\(a\\) at most in the value it\n assigns to \\(\\upsilon\\), satisfies \\(\\phi\\), and satisfies \\(\\psi\\). \n\n\n\nDavidson suggests that \u201c[t]he logical constants may be identified as\nthose iterative features of the language that require a recursive\nclause in the characterization of truth or satisfaction\u201d (1984, 71).\n(In our example, \u201cor\u201d and \u201csome\u201d.) \n\n\nThis criterion certainly gives reasonable results when applied to\nstandard truth theories like the one above (although the sign for\nidentity once more gets counted as nonlogical). But as Davidson goes on\nto observe, \u201c[l]ogical form, in this account, will of course be\nrelative to the choice of a metalanguage (with its logic) and a theory\nof truth\u201d (1984, 71). Different truth theories can be given for the\nsame language, and they can agree on the truth conditions of whole\nsentences while differing in which expressions they treat in the\nrecursive clauses. Here are two examples (both discussed further in\nEvans 1976).\n\n\n1. We might have recursive clauses for \u201clarge\u201d and other gradable\nadjectives, along these lines:\nFor all assignments \\(a\\), terms \\(\\tau\\), and\n  sentences \\(\\phi\\),\n  \\(\\cq{\\tau \\text{ is a large } \\phi }\\)\n is satisfied by \\(a\\) iff Ref(\\(\\tau\\), \\(a\\))\n is a large satisfier of \\(\\phi\\) on \\(a\\). (cf. Evans 1976,\n 203)\n\n\nWe would in this case have to use a metalanguage with a stronger\nlogic, one that provides rules for manipulating \u201clarge satisfier of\n\\(\\phi\\) on \\(a\\).\u201d (As Evans notes, all we would really need in\norder to derive T-sentences would be a rule licensing the derivation\nof\n\\(\\cq{\\tau \\text{ is a large satisfier of } \\phi \\text{ on } a}\\)\nfrom\n\\(\\cq{\\phi \\equiv \\psi}\\) and\n\\(\\cq{\\tau \\text{ is a larger satisfier of } \\psi \\text{ on } a}\\).) But\nsuch a metalanguage cannot be ruled out without begging the question\nabout the logicality of \u201clarge.\u201d\n\n\n2. We might assign values to \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, and the other\ntruth-functional connectives in the base clauses, allowing us\nto get by with a single generic recursive clause for truth-functional\nconnectives:\n\n\nBase: For all assignments \\(a\\), Ref(\u201cor\u201d, \\(a\\))\n= Boolean disjunction (the binary truth function that takes the value\nTrue when either argument is True, and False otherwise).\n\nRecursive: For all assignments \\(a\\), sentences \\(\\phi,\n\\psi\\), and truth-functional connectives \\(@\\), \\(\\cq{\\phi @ \\psi }\\)\nis satisfied\nby \\(a\\) iff Ref(\\(@, a\\))(Val(\\(\\phi, a\\)), Val(\\(\\psi,a\\))) = True\n(where Val(\\(\\phi, a\\)) = True if \\(\\phi\\) is\nsatisfied by \\(a\\), False if \\(\\phi\\) is not satisfied by\n\\(a\\)). (cf. Evans 1976, 214)\n\n\n\nThis approach requires a stronger metatheory than the usual\napproach, since it requires quantification over truth functions. But it\nis not clear why this is an objection. It is still possible to derive\nT-sentences whose right sides are no more ontologically committed than\nthe sentences named on their left sides, like\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u201cSnow is white or grass is green\u201d is } \\mathrm{true} \\\\\n\\text{ iff snow is white or grass is green}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSo it is hard to see how the use of functions here is any more\nobjectionable than Davidson\u2019s own appeal to sequences or assignments of\nvalues to variables.\n\n\nIn sum, the problem with Davidson\u2019s truth-theoretic proposal is much\nlike the problem discussed above with Quine\u2019s grammatical proposal.\nWithout further constraints on the theory of meaning (or, in Quine\u2019s\ncase, the grammar), it does not yield a definite criterion for logical\nconstancy. I do not mean to suggest that either Davidson or Quine was\ndeluded on this score. As we saw above, Quine appeals to pragmatic\nconsiderations to pick out a favored language and grammatical\nregimentation. No doubt Davidson would do the same, arguing (for\nexample) that the advantages of using a simple and well-understood\nlogic in the metalanguage outweigh any putative advantages of treating\n\u201clarge\u201d and the like in recursive clauses.
