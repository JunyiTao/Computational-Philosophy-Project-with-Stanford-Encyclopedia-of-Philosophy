    "main_text": "The grounds of law\n1. The grounds of law\n\n\nInterpretivism is a thesis about the fundamental or constitutive\nexplanation of legal rights and obligations (powers, privileges, and\nrelated notions) or, for short, about the grounds of law. In\nthe relevant sense, some fact grounds another when the latter obtains\nin virtue of the former; and the relation between the two facts is\nexplanatory in a non-causal, metaphysical sense of constitutive\ndetermination. (See Fine 2012 and other essays in Correia and\nSchnieder 2012). Consider the fact that, if you buy a mobile phone at\na store in London and it turns out to be defective, you have a right,\nwhich is enforceable through the courts, to have it replaced or\nrepaired by the seller, provided the defect existed when the phone was delivered and became apparent not later than two years from delivery. In virtue of what does the right obtain? What\nmakes it the case, more abstractly, that any legal right or obligation\nobtains?  What makes the proposition that some right or obligation\nexists true, if it is true? (Dworkin 1986; Stavropoulos 2017.)  What sorts of nonlegal\nfacts do legal rights and obligations depend upon in this fundamental\nway, and what is the character of the relation of dependence that\nholds between legal rights and obligations and the nonlegal facts in\nvirtue of which they obtain?  What is the order in which the relevant\nfactors appear within the fundamental explanation?\n\n\nLegal rights and obligations vary when certain institutional and other nonmoral social facts vary; and cannot vary as long as such facts remain the same. The class of relevant facts most prominently includes institutional practice, the actions or practices of political institutions and ultimately the actions and psychology of the agents that operate within such institutions. You came to have the right to have the defective phone replaced or repaired by the seller and under the conditions mentioned when certain facts of this kind obtained: most directly, when the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted a certain Directive and the UK Parliament adapted its own legislation to give effect to it. You did\u2019t have that specific right under the specific conditions before these actions were taken, and there is no guarantee you will retain the right now that the UK has completed its withdrawal from the EU and may take unilateral action to modify or abolish it. You couldn\u2019t have come to have the right or, once you did, to lose it, unless some facts of that character obtained. Your right is therefore contingent upon and varies with the actions and practices of political institutions. The task for theories of law is to offer an account of legal rights and obligations that explains these relations. Legal positivism is an account of legal rights and obligations that appeals, at the fundamental level, exclusively to institutional and other nonmoral social considerations. Interpretivism is a kind of natural law or \u201cnonpositivist\u201d theory since it claims that, in addition to institutional practice (and perhaps other nonmoral social factors), certain moral facts necessarily play some role in the explanation. It makes a number of related distinctive claims within that approach.\n\nFirst, interpretivism says that the explanation of rights and\nobligations in which both moral principles and institutional practice\nplay some role is a kind of interpretation.  Interpretation\nin the relevant sense is the study of normatively significant objects\nor of the actions of producing such objects and the practices within\nsuch production takes place. It is a familiar point from literary and\nother kinds of interpretation in the arts that an interpretation may\nimpute to its object a certain content that consists in or reflects\nits normative significance or impact, without thereby imputing the\ncontent to the psychology of the agent who produced the object; it is also a familiar point that an interpretation\u2019s success does not depend on such \nendorsement. In the case of law, an interpretation so understood may\ncorrectly identify, say, the change in rights and obligations that\nobtained in virtue of some enactment, even though the enactment\u2019s having\nthat impact was not considered and endorsed, in some specified sense,\nby the enacting institution.\n\nSecond, interpretivism says that interpretation identifies\nsome moral principles which justify, in some specified sense,\nthe enactment\u2019s having the impact in question. The point\ngeneralizes. For institutional practice as a whole, or for any individual\naction or attitude or other aspect of the practice, certain moral principles\njustify its having the impact on the law that it does have. The\nprinciples thereby make it the case that it has it.\n\nThird, for interpretivism, the justifying role of principles\nis fundamental: for any legal right or obligation, some moral\nprinciples ultimately explain how it is that institutional and other\nnonmoral considerations have roles as determinants of the right or\nobligation. In the order of explanation, morality comes first.\n\n\nThe relevant notion of justification has two aspects. First, the\nprinciples and therefore the moral facts that they reflect give\nreasons why any aspect of institutional practice or other\nnonmoral consideration bears on legal rights and obligations. The principles therefore explain why any such consideration is\nlegally relevant. Second, the principles thereby determine how any such consideration bears on rights and obligations. An interpretivist might say that certain principles of fairness or\nprocedural justice give enactments some role in determining rights and\nobligations. The precise role depends on the precise reasons why\nenactments should have it. An appeal to principles of fair notice\nmight give, other things equal, a central role specifically to the plain meaning of\nthe text of enactments. But on the hypothesis that democratically\nconstituted assemblies have justified power to shape rights and\nobligations as they choose, some conception of such assemblies\u2019\nlinguistic intentions, or of their intention to affect the law in some\nparticular way by the relevant enactment, might be given priority. There may be\nspecial cases. An interpretivist might say that, because fair notice\nis essential to the permissibility of criminal punishment, criminal\nstatutes affect the law only as narrowly construed. An interpretivist\nmight further say that, in all cases, certain more specific moral\nprinciples control \u201cthe operation and effect\u201d of all laws\n(as the Riggs v. Palmer court famously said, 115 NY 506\n(1889)).\n\n\nSimilar hypotheses would be germane to cases or institutional practice\nin general. For example that, because government ought to treat\nmorally like alike when it exercises its coercive power, judicial\ndecisions should stand; such that past decisions partly determine what\nrights and duties now obtain in circumstances similar to those of precedent cases in their morally relevant respects. Or, more abstractly,\nthat, because government has a duty to bring its action under a\ncoherent scheme of principle when it recognizes and enforces claims\nagainst some person, its institutional practice affects rights and\nobligations as certain principles dictate: namely the principles which\ntogether justify the practice\u2019s having that role. In\nthese examples, the moral facts that the principles express explain\nwhy and how the institutional action in question affects legal rights\nand duties and therefore the principles\u2019 role is to assign to\ninstitutional practice, or any of its aspects, their own role\nin the explanation.\n\nFourth, since in these explanations the mechanism, through\nwhich institutional practice determines rights and obligations,\nfollows from some moral principles that give the practice that very\nrole, the rights and obligations so determined have genuine moral\nforce.  For other conceptions of law, the question of the moral force\nof rights and obligations in law is separate from and must come after\nthe question of how institutional practice constitutes them\n(Stavropoulos 2012). We first ask how the practice determines rights\nand obligations, which is a conceptual or otherwise nonmoral question\nthat aims to identify the legally relevant aspects of institutional\npractice. Since our investigation is nonmoral, these must be\nunderstood as the factors that determine the content of legal rights\nand obligations, though not their force. We then ask the moral\nquestion, left open by the initial investigation, whether rights and\nobligations so determined truly bind. (Typically, the\nquestion takes the form of whether we have an obligation to obey the\nlaw.) The appropriate moral question is therefore severely constrained\nby the answer to the first, nonmoral one. We should ask what would\nhave to be true if the institutional factors already identified as\nlegally relevant were to constitute genuine moral rights and\nobligations. And of course there is no guarantee that what would have\nto be true would be true as often as one might suppose, or that it\ncould be true at all. Perhaps legal rights and obligations are rarely\nor never morally ratified.\n\n\nThis approach separates the metaphysical investigation of grounds from\nthe moral investigation of force. Considered from this perspective, a\nmoral explanation of how institutional practice determines rights and\nobligations of the sort offered by interpretivism may seem to belong\nin the second part of a complete account of the phenomenon of law, the\npart that concerns whether legal rights and obligations, nonmorally\nidentified, have genuine moral force.\n\n\nHowever, interpretivism is a thesis about the grounds of legal\nobligation which purports to compete with the two-stage and other\nsuch theses, not a thesis merely about the force of the obligations\nthat institutional practice constitutes in some nonmoral way. Rather,\ninterpretivism builds moral investigation into the metaphysical one.\nThe moral explanation that it offers assumes no nonmoral prior account\nof grounds and leaves no residual question whether legal\nobligations have moral force.\n\n\nThat said, there is an important distinction between two ways of\nunderstanding the interpretivist claim that institutional practice and\nmoral facts both play roles in the explanation of legal rights and\nobligations.\n\n\nOn the first way of understanding the claim, institutional practice\nconstitutes by itself part of the law; moral facts constitute by\nthemselves another part; and the final content of the law is some\nfunction of the two parts. On the second, institutional practice is\none factor in the explanation but does not constitute any part of the\nlaw. Rather, morality and institutional practice both figure in the\nconstitutive explanation of the law in the sense that the practice\ndetermines the content of the law as certain moral facts dictate and\nin virtue of those facts.\n\n\nAs we will see, a different version of interpretivism corresponds to\neach way of reading the claim that institutional practice and morality\ntogether ground legal rights and obligations. The first\nversion, hybrid interpretivism, which understands\ninstitutional practice as an independent ground, may give rise to a\nconcern of moral bias in the approach to the metaphysical problem. For\nit is reasonable to suspect that this kind of interpretivist sets out\nwith the goal of finding moral force in the law, and\nthe purpose of combining the institutional base with a moral overlay\nis to secure such force. On the second version, pure\nor nonhybrid interpretivism, which reflects the\nsecond reading of the distinction, there is no scope for such\nbias. For according to that version morality mandates the constitutive\nrole that the theory assigns to institutional practice; while there is\nno nonmorally predefined route through which the practice is supposed\nto determine any obligations.\n\n\nIt will help to develop these claims in comparison to the orthodox\nview about how institutional practice affects legal rights and obligations.\n",
