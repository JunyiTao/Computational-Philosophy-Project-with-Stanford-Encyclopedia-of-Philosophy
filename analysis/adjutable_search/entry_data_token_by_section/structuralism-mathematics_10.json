    "main_text": "Conclusion || The Varieties of Mathematical Structuralism\n4.2 Structuralism Beyond Mathematics\n\nAnother relevant aspect that is not explored in the present entry,\nalthough it should be mentioned at least briefly before closing,\nconsists of debates about \u201cstructuralism\u201d outside the\nphilosophy of mathematics. There are two main areas in which one can\nfind such debates (although they have reverberated further). The first\nis the philosophy of physics, where structuralist positions have\nplayed a significant role as well (including one called\n\u201cstructural realism\u201d, which comes in both an\n\u201contic\u201d and an \u201cepistemic\u201d form).  The second\nconsists of several parts of the humanities and social sciences,\nprimarily linguistics and anthropology, but also psychology,\nsociology, etc. There too, \u201cstructuralism\u201d (and\n\u201cpost-structuralism\u201d) has been a major topic, indeed for a\nrelatively long period. In both cases, there are ties to mathematical\nstructuralism, although sometimes these ties are only loose.\n\nAt a basic level, the debate about structuralism in the philosophy of\nphysics concerns how to think about the \u201cobjects\u201d of\nmodern physics, given the revolutionary changes quantum mechanics and\nrelativity theory have brought with them. More particularly, it\nconcerns the suggestion to refer to \u201cstructures\u201d in this\nconnection (cf. French 2014, Ladyman 2007 [2019], etc.), in a way that\nis closely related to the philosophy of mathematics. At another level,\nthis debate concerns how to conceive of what, if anything, remains\nconstant through theory changes in the ontology of physics\n(cf. Worrall 1989, and see the\n entry on structuralism in physics\nin this encyclopedia). Third, there are debates about representation \nin science that are related to structuralism (cf. van Frassen 2008). While \nthere are several points of contact one could pursue further (e.g., concerning\n\u201cstructural indiscernibles\u201d \nand versions of \u201cset-theoretic versus \ncategory-theoretic structuralism\u201d in the context \nof physics), we refrain from doing so here.\n\nThe structuralism introduced into linguistics by Ferdinand de Saussure\nand Roman Jakobson, then adopted by other thinkers in the humanities\nand social sciences\u2014most prominently by Claude Levi-Strauss in\nanthropology and by Jean Piaget in psychology (cf.  Levi-Strauss 1958\n[1963], Piaget 1968 [1970], also Caws 1988)\u2014does have ties to\nmathematical structuralism as well. However, they are looser than in\nthe case of the philosophy of physics. In addition, the kind of\npsychological determinism often associated, or even identified, with\nstructuralism in the humanities and social sciences (and criticized in\npost-structuralism) has no analogue on the side of mathematics (or\nphysics).  Still, these connections are not totally uninteresting\n(starting with contacts between Levi-Strauss and mathematicians in the\nBourbaki group, cf. Dosse 1991\u201392 [1997]). Hence they might be\nworth exploring further too, in this case not so much to derive\nbenefits for the philosophy of mathematics, but to understand the\nhistory of structuralism in human thought more fully. \n",
