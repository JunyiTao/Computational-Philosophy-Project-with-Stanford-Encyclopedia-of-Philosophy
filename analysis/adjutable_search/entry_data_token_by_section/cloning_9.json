    "main_text": "Human Reproductive Cloning || Harm to Others\n3.3 Harm to Others\n\nOther concerns related to cloning focus on the potential harmful\neffects of cloning for others. Sometimes these concerns are related to\nthose about the wellbeing of the clone. For example, McGee\u2019s\nconcern about confused family relationships not only bears on the\nclone but also on society as a whole. However, since I have already\nmentioned this concern, I will, in the remainder of this entry, focus\non other arguments\n3.3.1 Adoption and the Importance of Genetic Links\n\nIt is often claimed that the strongest reason for why reproductive\ncloning should be permissible, if safe, is that it will allow\ninfertile people to have a genetically related child. This position\nrelies on the view that having genetically related children is morally\nsignificant and valuable. This is a controversial view. For example,\nLevy and Lotz (2005) and Rulli (2016) have denied the importance of a\ngenetic link between parents and their children. Moreover, they have\nargued that claiming that this link is important will give rise to bad\nconsequences, such as reduced adoption rates (and, in Rulli\u2019s\ncase, a failure to fulfil one\u2019s duty to adopt) and diminished\nresources for improving the life prospects of the disadvantaged,\nincluding those waiting to be adopted. Levick (2004, 185) and Ahlberg\nand Brighouse (2011) have also advanced this view. Since, according to\nthese authors, these undesirable consequences would be magnified if we\nallowed human cloning, we have good reason to prohibit it. In\nresponse, Strong (2008) has argued that this effect is uncertain, and\nthat there are other, probably more effective, ways to help such\nchildren or to prevent them from ending up in such a situation.\nMoreover, if cloning is banned, infertile couples may make use of\ndonor embryos or gametes rather than adoption. Rob Sparrow (2006) has\npointed out another potential problem for those who defend\nreproductive cloning for the reason that it will overcome infertility\nby providing a genetically related child. According to Sparrow,\ncloning just doesn\u2019t provide the right sort of genetic relation to\nmake those who use the technology the parents of the child.So, in\norder to justify reproductive cloning one then has to emphasise the\nimportance of the intention with which the parents bring the cloned\nchild into the world, rather than the genetic relationship with the\nchild. And this emphasis works to undermine the justification for\nreproductive cloning in the first place.\n3.3.2 Genetic Diversity\n\nAnother concern is that because cloning is an asexual way of\nreproducing it would decrease genetic variation among offspring and,\nin the long run, might even constitute a threat to the human race. The\ngene pool may narrow sufficiently to threaten humanity\u2019s\nresistance to disease (AMA 1999, 6). In response, it has been argued\nthat if cloning becomes possible, the number of people who will choose\nit as their mode of reproduction will very likely be too low to\nconstitute a threat to genetic diversity. It would be unlikely to be\nhigher than the rate of natural twinning, which, occurring at a rate\nof 3.5/1000 children, does not seriously impact on genetic diversity.\nFurther, even if millions of people would create children through\ncloning, the same genomes will not be cloned over and over: each\nperson would have a genetic copy of his or her genome, which means the\nresult will still be a high diversity of genomes. Others argue that,\neven if genetic diversity were not diminished by cloning, a society\nthat supports reproductive cloning might be taken to express the view\nthat variety is not important. Conveying such a message, these authors\nsay, could have harmful consequences for society.\n3.3.3 Eugenics\n\nSome see the increase in control of what kind of genome we want to\npass on to our children as a positive development. A major concern,\nhowever, is that this shift \u2018from chance to choice\u2019 will\nlead to problematic eugenic practices.\n\nOne version of this concern states that cloning would, from the\noutset, constitute a problematic form of eugenics. However, critics\nhave argued that this is implausible: the best explanations of what\nwas wrong with immoral cases of eugenics, such as the Nazi eugenic\nprograms, are that they involved coercion and were motivated by\nobjectionable moral beliefs or false non-moral beliefs. This would not\nnecessarily be the case were cloning to be implemented now (Agar 2004;\nBuchanan 2007). Unlike the coercive and state-directed eugenics of the\npast, new \u2018liberal eugenics\u2019 defends values such as\nautonomy, reproductive freedom, beneficence, empathy and the avoidance\nof harm (Agar, 2004). Enthusiasts of so-called \u2018liberal\neugenics\u2019 are interested in helping individuals to prevent or\ndiminish the suffering and increase the well-being of their children\nby endowing them with certain genes. \n\nAnother version of the eugenics concern points out the risk of a\nslippery slope: the claim is that cloning will lead to objectionable\nforms of eugenics\u2014for example, coercive eugenics\u2014in the\nfuture. After all, historical cases of immoral eugenics often\ndeveloped from earlier well intentioned and less problematic practices\n(for a history of eugenics as well as an analysis of philosophical and\npolitical issues raised by eugenics, see Kevles 1985 and Paul 1995).\nAccording to Sandel (2007, Ch.5), for example, \u2018liberal\neugenics\u2019 might imply more state compulsion than first appears:\njust as governments can force children to go to school, they could\nrequire people to use genetics to have \u2018better\u2019\nchildren.\n\nA related concern expressed by Sandel (2007, 52\u20137) is that\ncloning, and enhancement technologies in general, may result in a\nsociety in which parents will not accept their child for what it is,\nreinforcing an already existing trend of heavily managed,\nhigh-pressure child-rearing or \u2018hyper-parenting\u2019. Asch and\nWasserman (2005, 202) have expressed a similar concern; arguing that\nhaving more control over what features a child has can pose an\n\u201caffront to an ideal of unconditioned devotion\u201d. Another\nconcern, most often expressed by disability rights advocates, is that\nif cloning is used to have \u2018better\u2019 children, it may\ncreate a more intolerant climate towards those with a disability or a\nserious disease, and that such practices can express negative\njudgments about people with disabilities. This argument has also been\nadvanced in the debate about selective abortion, prenatal testing, and\npreimplantation genetic diagnosis. Disagreement exists about whether\nthese effects are likely. For example, Buchanan et al. (2002, 278)\nhave argued that one can devalue disability while valuing existing\ndisabled people and that trying to help parents who want to avoid\nhaving a disabled child does not imply that society should make no\nefforts to increase accessibility for existing people with\ndisabilities.\n",
