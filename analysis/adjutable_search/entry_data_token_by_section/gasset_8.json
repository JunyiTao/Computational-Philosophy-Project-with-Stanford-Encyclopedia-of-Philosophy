Ontological Factors Confronting Transcendental Phenomenology\n\nIn 1925, Ortega presented Husserl\u2019s phenomenological approach to his\nstudents at the University of Madrid, wherein he projected his program\nto study the \u201crestatement of the problem of Being\u201d for a\nseries of publications. Specifically, Ortega oriented himself towards\nthe possible adoption of a systematic method within which the problem\nof \u201cBeing\u201d might have resolved the issue of human reality\nfor him in the development of his thought. \u201cIn 1925\u201d, he\nrecounted:\n\nI stated my theme\u2014some of my students would be able to\nremember\u2014saying literally: 1st, it is necessary to\nrenew, from its roots, the traditional problem of Being;\n2nd, this has to be done with the phenomenological method\ninsofar and only insofar as this means synthetic or intuitive\nthinking, and not merely conceptual-abstract thinking as is the\ntraditional logical way of thinking; 3rd, but it is\nnecessary to integrate the phenomenological method, adapting to it a\ndimension of systematic thinking which, as is known, it does\nnot posses;4th, and finally, in order that a systematic\nphenomenological thinking may be possible, it is necessary to start\nout from a phenomenon which may be a system by and in\nitself. This systematic phenomenon is human life and from its\nreflection and analysis one must set out. (Obras, VIII: 273).\n\n\nIn this account of his quest for \u201csynthetic thinking\u201d,\nOrtega proceeded to explain how he\n\n\nabandoned Phenomenology at the very moment of accepting it. Instead of\nwithdrawing from consciousness, as has been done since Descartes, we\nbecome firm in the radical reality which is for every one his [or her]\nlife. (Obras, VIII: 273)\n\n\nIn this manner, by 1925, Ortega\u2019s ambivalence towards adopting a\nphenomenological method became apparent in his search for a coherent\nmethod of analysis. He was willing to retain the\n\u201csynthetic\u201d (or \u201cintuitive\u201d) function of\nphenomenological analysis provided that this function in turn becomes\nintegrated into the systematic phenomenon of \u201chuman life\u201d.\nThrough this connection, the phenomenological method of analysis, and\nthe analysis of human life experiences, performed interchangeable\nfunctions for Ortega in the systematic apprehension of the traditional\nproblem of being. This explains the positive side of the ambivalence\nwhich prompted him to approach and accept phenomenology. However, on\nthe other side of the ambivalence, he avoided phenomenology where the\nemphasis appears to be on the abstract in the tradition of\nidealism. His critical response to Husserl\u2019s Formal and\nTranscendental Logic (1929) [1969] identified this tendency\nin phenomenology.\n\nSeveral European thinkers who were influenced in one way or another by\nconcepts of the phenomenological movement, but were not necessarily\nmembers of the movement, became dissatisfied with the alleged\nsolipsistic standpoint of Husserl\u2019s transcendental phenomenology in\nthe Formal and Transcendental Logic. Ortega was one of these\nthinkers, although he did not explicitly express any dissatisfaction\nwith what he perceived as the solipsistic implications of the\ntranscendental idealism in the latter work until twelve years later.\nAs indicated earlier, Husserl expressed dissatisfaction as well in his\nCrisis, saying that his transcendental epoch\u00e9\nmay have been misread by others. Indeed, Husserl insisted that his\nefforts attempted to point away from the solipsistic path of the\n\u201cCartesian way\u201d. In two lectures delivered at the Sorbonne\nin 1929, Husserl introduced ideas which transformed his earlier\nposition on transcendental phenomenology from a world of isolated\nideas into a world community of intersubjective individuals. The\nobservations and insights made in the lectures were amplified later in\nhis Cartesian Meditations (1933) and Crisis. In\nthese later writings, Descartes\u2019 ego lost its abstract, absolute\nstatus as it became correlative to the world of experience (1933\n[1964: 1\u20138, 157]; 1936 [1970: 154\u201355, 188, 257\u201363]).\nIn his Notes on Thinking (1941), Ortega found Husserl\u2019s\napproach to the problem of genesis of reason to be \u201ctantamount\nto being absolute\u201d, particularly where Husserl expounded his\n\u201cgenetic phenomenology\u201d as \u201cconsciousness of\u201d\nreality, thereby designating \u201cconsciousness of itself\u201d as\nbeing \u201cimmediate to itself\u201d. He criticized further the\nanalysis and definitions of reason given by Husserl in Formal and\nTranscendental Logic as not incorporating \u201cthe themes of\nhumanity, life and the functional character of reason\u201d.\nAccordingly, \u201cthe phenomenological attitude as formulated in\nFormal and Transcendental Logic is diametrically opposed to\nthe attitude that I call living reason\u201d. He opposed this\ntendency toward transcendental idealism in Formal and\nTranscendental Logic but refused to completely reject\nphenomenology (Obras, V: 545).\n\nOur discussion thus far makes manifest Ortega\u2019s ambivalence toward\nphenomenology. After he learned of Husserl\u2019s Crisis of European\nSciences, Ortega did not argue that his later general position\nand that of phenomenology were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d.\nIndeed, in a long footnote at the conclusion of Notes on\nThinking, Ortega invited a comparison between himself and\nHusserl. In 1935, Husserl presented a series of four lectures in\nPrague on \u201cPhilosophy in the Crisis of European Mankind\u201d,\nall of which were incorporated into theCrisis. At the time of\nhis Cartesian Meditations and Crisis of European\nSciences, Husserl proclaimed that scientific knowledge can be\nunderstood only to the extent that we first understand the notion,\nLebenswelt. The Crisis became famous for its\nthematic treatment of the concept, life-world. The study of\nthe lived world, the experience of it,\nand \u201cego-and-life-relatedness\u201d, became the\nprimary consideration of phenomenology. Lebenswelt philosophy\nis primarily engaged in the elaboration of the broader question posed\nin Logical Investigations: what is meant by\n\u201ctruth\u201d? Truth has been defined here as lived experience\nof truth\u2014that is, evidence. Evidence is revealed exclusively in\npresent experience, and thereby truth is always and exclusively tested\nin present experience as one cannot relive the flux of experience.\nThere is no absolute truth, as postulated by either dogmatism or\nskepticism. Rather, truth defines itself in process, as revision,\ncorrection, and self-surpassing. This dynamic process occurs at the\nheart of the living present. Consequently, as individuals living in\nthe world, we respond correctly to the question of truth by describing\nthe experience of the true and insisting on the genetic development of\nthe \u201cego\u201d: truth consists not as an object but as a\nmovement, and exists only insofar as this movement is actually\ncarried out by the ego. Also, in regard to the life-world, the\ninnovative contribution of Crisis lies in Husserl\u2019s attempt\nto provide a thematic account of history, the historicity of the\nlife-world and subjectivity within the overall framework of\ntranscendental phenomenology. History, however, as Husserl came to\nunderstand it, consists from the outset, in \u201cnothing other than\nthe living moment of being-with-one-another and in-one-another of\noriginal meaning-constitution and meaning-sedimentation\u201d. This\nhas also been referred to as \u201cintentional history\u201d.\nFurthermore, the concepts of history, the historicity of the\nlife-world, are made possible by the inner historicity of every human\nbeing living in it. History thereby exhibits an historical\n\u201ca priori\u201d itself which, for him, assures\nobjectivity of history. The historical a priori itself\npresupposes a certain idealization in that the \u201cinsights of\nprinciple\u201d are historical. History becomes mastered not\nby an a-historical apriorism, but by a transcendental stance which\ndemonstrates that the process of constitution developed in history may\nbe, in its essential structure, deciphered in reflective thinking by\nthe reflecting ego, like the constitution of modern science. Thus, the\ntruths of science are founded neither in Divine Providence, as\nDescartes thought, nor on the a priori conditions of\npossibility, as Kant thought. Rather, they are grounded in lived\nexperiences on which the truth of the theoretical consciousness is\nbased (Husserl 1936 [1970: 349\u201351, 369\u201378, 389\u201395]).\nHusserl perceived the historical world to be pre-given as a\nsocio-historical world. As he expresses it,\n\nto live is always to live-in-certainty-of-the-world \u2026 wakefully\nin the world \u2026 we are conscious of fellow men on our\nhorizon\u2026. Like me, every human being \u2026 has his fellow\nmen and always, continuing himself, civilization in general, in which\nhe knows himself to be living (Husserl 936 [1970: 142, 358, 372]).\n\n\nOrtega found this kind of reflection on the historical manner of\nbeing, and the life-world, compatible with his own notion of\n\u201chistorical reason\u201d presented in History as a\nSystem. Upon insisting that he arrived at this position\nindependently of Husserl, Ortega made clear his favorable response to\nthe innovative contribution made by Husserl in the Crisis.\n\u201cPersonally\u201d, Ortega commented concerning his reaction to\nthe 1935 publication,\n\n\nthis leap of the phenomenological doctrine has been extremely\nsatisfactory for me because it consists in nothing less than a resort\nto \u201chistorical reason\u201d. (Obras, V: 546\u20137,\nn.1)\n\n\nTherefore, Husserl\u2019s later works, particularly Cartesian\nMeditations and the Crisis, which were attempts to\nresolve the difficulties inherent in transcendental phenomenology and\nrepresentative of his phenomenological philosophy, were not\ndiametrically opposed to the themes of human life. Nor did they\nneglect the importance of postulating the epistemological and\nontological functions of the experience of human life. The orientation\nof these later writings has contributed to the theory that Husserl\nperceived the Crisis as the \u201cdefinitive\u201d\nintroduction to phenomenology.\n\nClearly, Husserl\u2019s idea of Lebenswelt was the kind of notion\nthat Ortega discussed in his own philosophy of human life. But this\naffinity in thought does not negate minor differences between the two\nthinkers. Discussions in Cartesian Meditations of the problem\nof other people, or intersubjectivity, and of the world as a world\nessentially inhabited by \u201cothers\u201d was conceivably the part\nof Heidegger\u2019s philosophy which had the profoundest effect on the\ndevelopment of Existential Phenomenology and Ortega\u2019s thought. Ortega\ntook issue with a small point on the role of the notion\n\u201canalogical transposition\u201d concerning the\n\u201cOther\u201d, which was made in the fifth meditation, yet he\ndid not consider this point to be diametrically opposed to his notion\nof human life. \u201cHusserl\u201d, he remarked at one point in his\nMan and People (1939\u201340),\n\n\nwas the first who clearly defined the radical and not merely\npsychological problem that I call \u201cThe Appearance of the\nOther\u201d. Husserl\u2019s development of the problem is, in my opinion,\nmuch less successful than his definition of it, although there are\nmany admirable discoveries in his development. (Obras, VII:\n160\u201361)\n\n\nMan and People feature essays which Ortega developed and\npresented in several lectures and courses over a period of\napproximately twenty years. In The Origin of Philosophy, in a\nfootnote, Ortega referred to the occasion in which he presented for\nthe first time his concept of a \u201cnew sociology\u201d under the\ntitle, \u201cMan and People\u201d in Valladolid in 1934\n(Obras, IX: 355, n.1). The first chapter was published as\n\u201cBeing in and Beside One\u2019s Self\u201d by Espasa-Calpe\nArgentina, Buenos Aires, 1939 (Obras, V: 291\u2013315; 7:,\n72\u201373, 79). In a Prologue to his Ideas and Beliefs,\nOrtega announced in 1940 the forthcoming appearance of two major\nworks: a philosophical exposition, Dawn of Historical Reason,\nand the corpus of his social doctrine, Man and People. In the\nFall, 1940, at the University of Argentina, and four years later, at\nthe University of Lisbon, Ortega presented lectures under the\ntitle, \u201cHistorical Reason\u201d.  These variegated\nexpositions were compiled and published posthumously in 1979. In 1929,\nOrtega wrote an essay titled \u201cThe Perception of One\u2019s\nFellowman\u201d (Obras, VI: 153\u2013163) that may explain\nhis attempt to distinguish his concept of \u201cthe other\u201d from\nHusserl\u2019s notion of the \u201cappearance of the other\u201din\nMan and People in view of the inevitable comparisons made\nbetween the two.\n\nThe foregoing discussion should not suggest an absence of shared\nviewpoints between Ortega and Husserl, and Husserl\u2019s intellectual\ninfluence on Ortega. Although Ortega disagreed with Husserl\u2019s notion\nof \u201canalogical transposition\u201d, he did view the latter\u2019s\nphenomenological approach to knowledge as having been \u201cthe\ngreatest influence of this last half-century\u201d. Ortega also\nconsidered the notion of the appearance of the other\u2014that is,\nthe other\u2019s presence both as an object (i.e., the physical structure\nof its body) and as a subject (i.e., as an alter ego that experiences\nthe same world that is experienced by the \u201cI\u201d)\u2014and\nlife experience as analyses which helped avert solipsism and the\nenclosure of the \u201cI\u201d within itself. Through this\nconnection, Ortega aligns himself with Husserl\u2019s repudiation of the\nCartesian distinction between the interior (in the mind) and the\nexterior (in the world) (Obras, V: 545). Although Ortega\u2019s\nown independence of thought remains controversial, his intellectual\ndevelopment exhibits a consistent emphasis on discerning the boundary\ndrawn between extra-historical and historical coherence in\ntranscendental phenomenology. Ortega discussed, in his later writings,\nsuch phenomenological notions as actions which are directed toward\nobjects when the \u201cI\u201d encounters its environment; ego/alter\nego interaction in the world of intersubjective communities as the\nrealm of lived experiences; and the position of entering the\ntranscendental attitude of phenomenological reduction in order to\napprehend the alter ego, all of which are notions similar to those\ndiscussed by Husserl. In these authoritative writings, his criterion\nof \u201copenness to experience\u201d led him to an acceptance of\nhistorical variegation, and to the principle that a human being\u2019s\nrelation to the world consists in a total relation of one entity among\nother entities.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of this characterization of phenomenology, Ortega\nreached back to \u201cI am I and my circumstances\u201d as his\nstarting point of analysis. For Ortega, the individual ego is\nconscious of itself through the awareness of both its physiological\nfeatures and behavioral gestures, and those of \u201cothers\u201d in\nreciprocal human interaction, a consciousness of self that proceeds\nthrough self-analysis of the inner essence of the being of the\n\u201cI\u201d and the \u201cI\u2019s\u201d awareness of other selves as\nsimilar beings in the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of the world of\nlived experience. In short, he attempted to characterize the nature of\nan individual\u2019s experience of one\u2019s world and oneself. There is\nan attempt to distinguish between the facts that one\u2019s relationship to\nan organism is different from one\u2019s relation to a person qua being,\nand that one\u2019s actions toward an organism are different from the way\nthat one acts toward a person. \u201cLiving\u201d, he said,\n\u201cis to reach outside of oneself, devoted ontologically, to what\nis other, be it called world or circumstances\u201d\n(Obras, V: 545).\n",
