    "main_text": "Medieval Empiricism || A Cognitive Empiricism\n4.3 A Cognitive Empiricism\n\nI shall conclude this discussion by returning to the strong form of\ngenetic empiricism that I have called \u201ccognitive\nempiricism\u201d: the idea that the mind has no access to sources of\nknowledge that are independent of the senses. It is clear that\nadvocates of the doctrine of divine illumination would not count as\ncognitive empiricists. But what about those who rejected this\ndoctrine? One might question whether even they were cognitive\nempiricists, for the same reason one might ask this question of\nAristotle. While recognizing that all factual knowledge dervives from\nthe senses, they attributed to the mind a remarkable ability to grasp\nthe universals embedded in the singular objects of sense perception.\nWhat we see in the work of William of Ockham is a downgrading of this\npower, which goes hand-in-hand with a rethinking of the idea of\nuniversals. Ockham\u2019s work thus laid the foundations on which\nearly modern empiricists would build.\n\nThe power of the mind to grasp universals was traditionally attributed\nto what was called the \u201cagent intellect,\u201d the intellect as\nactive or productive. The idea of the agent (or active) intellect is\none of the most complex and contested aspects of medieval\nepistemology. It has its origins in some cryptic remarks made by\nAristotle (DA 430a10\u201319), in which he distinguishes\nbetween two aspects of the mind. There is the mind as \u201cthat\nwhich becomes all things\u201d (nous t\u014di panta\nginesthai) and there is the mind as \u201cthat which makes all\nthings\u201d (ho \u2026 t\u014di panta poiein). Behind\nthese descriptions is the idea that the mind \u201cbecomes\u201d the\nobject of its knowledge, in the sense of taking on its intelligible\nform without the matter in which it was originally embodied. The mind\nas passive\u2014as that which becomes all things\u2014stands in\nrelation to the mind that makes all things in the same way that prime\nmatter, which is pure potential, stands in relation to its shaping\nprinciple. Aristotle describes the mind as active or\nproductive\u2014the nous poi\u0113tikos, to use a phrase\ncoined by his commentators\u2014in terms that suggest something\nimmaterial: it is \u201cseparable, unmixed, and impassible.\u201d\nThis may be because it is not so much a substance, as an operation or\nfunction; indeed Aristotle describes the nous poi\u0113tikos\nas \u201cby nature activity\u201d (t\u0113i ousiai \u2026\nenergeia).\n\nAs that last interpretive remark suggests, this passage demands\ncommentary and commentators disagreed about how it was to be\nunderstood. (For a classic survey, see Brentano 1992.) Broadly\nspeaking, there were two views. The first held that the agent\nintellect was separate from each human mind, such that the\nintelligible forms \u201cflow\u201d from this immaterial entity into\nthe mind to produce an act of understanding. This was the view held,\nin two quite different forms, by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna) and Ibn\nRushd (Averro\u00ebs) (1126\u20131198). Such a view implies that\nthere is only one agent intellect, common to all human beings, which\nmay or may not be identified with God himself. (When it is identified\nwith God, this view closely resembles the Augustinian doctrine of\ndivine illumination.) The alternative idea, vigorously defended by\nAquinas, held that both the agent intellect and the potential\nintellect are aspects of the human mind. Even among those who held\nthat latter view, there were different ways in which the agent\nintellect was thought to produce knowledge. In some versions of the\ndoctrine (such as Aquinas\u2019s) the agent intellect was thought to\nabstract the intelligible forms from the images produced by the\nsenses. In other versions, the input of the senses was little more\nthan the occasion on which the agent intellect drew on its own innate\nresources, in the process of which the mind could be thought of as\nenlightened by God. Thomas of York (d. ca. 1260), for instance spoke\nopenly in this context of innate ideas and of a knowledge that came\n\u201cfrom above and not from the senses\u201d (Bowman 1973:\n265).\n\nThe second of these views, in particular, seems incompatible with both\na tabula rasa and a cognitive empiricism. So it is not\nsurprising that the development of a more thoroughgoing cognitive\nempiricism went hand-in-hand with with an effective abandonment of the\nidea of the agent intellect.\n\nThe work of the agent intellect had seemed essential because of a\nwidely held view regarding the object of knowledge. This held that\nwhile the senses deal with particular individuals, the intellect can\ngrasp only their universal properties. As Aquinas writes, citing\nAristotle (APo. 87b37\u201339), \u201csense has to do with\nparticulars, whereas intellect has to do with universals\u201d\n(sensus particularium, intellectus \u2026 universalium)\n(Aquinas In DA 2.5 [sect. 284]). (The idea that the intellect\nhas direct knowledge only of universals seems distinctively\nAristotelian; it was not shared by other ancient philosophical schools\n[Normore 2007: 114].) Aquinas\u2019s reason for holding this view is\nthat the intellect, as an immaterial substance, cannot directly grasp\nmaterial singulars. Intellectual knowledge therefore requires the work\nof the agent intellect, abstracting the immaterial intelligible forms\nfrom the perceptible forms grasped by the senses. We do, of course,\nknow singular objects, for all the objects of sensation are,\nultimately, singulars. But in Aquinas\u2019s view, the intellect\nknows these objects only indirectly, by directing its attention back\nto the images yielded by the senses and linking these with the\nassociated general concept (Aquinas ST 1a 86.1).\n\nWilliam of Ockham, on the other hand, holds what Aquinas expressly\ndenies: that \u201cthe singular object is that which is first known,\nin a manner simple and proper to itself\u201d (Ockham Quodl.\nI qu. 13). He holds, too, that the immateriality of the intellect is\nno barrier to this, since the relation involved is a merely\nintentional one (Ockham Ord. I dist. 3, qu. 6; In\nPhys. 1.1 [sect. 2]). Ockham, however, goes further in denying\nthe very existence of universals. All Aristotelians, of course, denied\nthat universals exist extra rem (distinct from singular\nobjects). But Christian Aristotelians such as Aquinas continued to\nregard the similarities between individuals of a given kind as the\nproduct of a common idea, which existed ante rem (before the\nexistence of particular objects) in the mind of God (Aquinas\nST 1a 15.2). As aspects of the divine mind, these were\nthought to share in the divine nature. Indeed they were nothing less\nthan \u201cthe divine essence as imitable outside itself\u201d\n(Klocker 1980: 357). This gave the natural kinds discoverable by\nscience a metaphysical grounding. While paying lip service to the\nAugustinian notion of ideas in the divine mind, Ockham reduced these\nto the ideas God has of individual objects in the act of creating\nthem. These ideas refer, in the first instance, to the creatures\nthemselves: the only reason for positing them is that when God creates\nhe knows what he is doing (Deus est rationabiliter operans)\n(Ockham Ord. I dist. 35, qu. 5). It follows, as Ockham\nwrites, that\n\n\nno universal \u2026 exists in any way outside the mind and anything\nthat can be predicated of many is by its nature in the mind either\npsychologically [subiective] or logically\n[obiective], and \u2026 no universal is of the essence or\nnature [de essentia seu quidditate] of any substance. (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2, qu. 8)\n\n\nThis means that the features that unite entities of a kind, which are\nexpressed in the general propositions of science, no longer have a\nmetaphysical foundation. While this view is generally described as\n\u201cnominalist,\u201d it is more accurately characterized as\n\u201cconceptualist,\u201d since the \u201cnames\u201d to which\nuniversals were reduced were nomina mentalia (mental names),\nor (as we would say) concepts (Maurer 1999: 63\u201364). But with\nthis qualification in mind, I shall continue to refer to it as\n\u201cnominalist.\u201d\n\nWhat implications does this have for the idea of the agent intellect?\nDespite his nominalism, Ockham continues to believe that there are\nreal similarities lying behind our classificatory schemes, rejecting\nthe idea that these are entirely matters of convention (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2 qu. 8). But although real similarities exist,\nthey are not expressions of common essences or natures. Coupled with\nthe idea that the mind has an immediate grasp of singular objects, it\nfollows that a special faculty was not longer required in order to\nabstract the universal from the particular. It was enough for the mind\nto be able to identify similarities among particular individuals.\n(Note that the status of these similarities then became a problem,\nwhich Ockham may never satisfactorily have resolved [Goddu 1984:\n92\u201393].) So it comes as no surprise to discover that Ockham\ndenies any real distinction between the agent intellect and the\npotential intellect. \u201cThe same intellect,\u201d he writes,\nsimply \u201chas different names\u201d (Ockham Ord. I dist.\n3, qu. 6). Since there was now no distinctive task for the agent\nintellect to perform, Ockham could wield his famous razor to abandon\nthe idea that it represented a distinct power of the mind (Ockham\nRep. II qu. 20).\n\nThere is another dimension to the empiricism of this period, which is\na new emphasis on experience as a means of discovering causal\nrelations. Any Aristotelian, of course, would have agreed that we know\nof causal relations by means of experience. But what we find in the\nwork of Scotus and Ockham is a particular focus on this idea, coupled\nwith descriptions of how one may isolate particular causes. Historians\nhave long associated this with a renewed emphasis on God\u2019s\nabsolute power and the idea that the order of the world depends\nentirely on his will, which makes that order radically contingent and\ndiscoverable only a posteriori (Foster 1934: 464\u201365;\nHenry 2009: 88). It is, however, difficult to find a contemporary\nexpression of this idea and it has recently been contested (Harrison\n2002: 63\u201364). Nor should one overstate the degree of novelty in\nthe thought of Scotus and Ockham. Grosseteste had already outlined the\nidea of a controlled experiment (Lewis 2013: sect. 11), which itself\nhad been anticipated in the work of Galen\n (sect. 3.3.1).\n Interestingly, Grosseteste\u2019s example had also been a medical\none: he notes that we can come to know that scammony (convulvulus\nscammonia) purges red bile by administering it \u201cafter all\nother causes purging red bile have been isolated and excluded\u201d\n(Grosseteste In APo. 1.15; Crombie 1953: 74). It is true,\nhowever, that more detailed accounts of how to isolate causal\nrelations are found only in the late thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies. Scotus outlined several such methods (Vos 2006:\n312\u201319), all of which involved separating out possible causes\nand testing them by seeing in which cases the effect follows. At one\npoint, for example, Scotus writes:\n\n\nHow, from perceptible effects, does one arrive at knowledge of the\ncause? I respond, by dividing thus: in [a situation of type] A are\npresent [factors] B, C, D, if you wish to know which of D, B, or C is\na cause, consider the case where you find B without C. If then D\nfollows B and not C, then in [a situation of type] A, B is the cause\nof D. (Scotus In Met. I qu. 4)\n\n\nOckham picks up on this idea. He does not deny that we can know of\nsome causes by simple reasoning, on the basis of self-evident or\nwell-established metaphysical principles. We can know, for instance,\nthat the will causes its own acts (Ockham Ord. I dist. 1, qu.\n3) or that there exists a first conserving cause of this world (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2, qu. 10]). But when it comes to the discovery\nof causes within the natural world, we must rely on observation. If a\ncausal agent is of a very specific kind (in Ockham\u2019s terms,\nknown by way of its species specialissima), just one\nobservation will suffice. A single observation of a particular kind of\nherb curing a particular illness, for example, can safely be\ngeneralized. It can be generalized on the basis of the principle that\n\u201call agents of the most specific kind will bring about effects\nof the same nature\u201d (Ockham Ord. I prol. qu. 2). If the\nsuspected cause is of a more generic kind, then many instances will be\nneeded (Ockham Ord. I prol. qu. 2). But in either case, the\nprocess is thoroughly empirical: it involves the isolation of causal\nfactors by way of experience. As Ockham writes,\n\n\nalthough I do not intend to make any general claim about the nature of\nimmediate [secondary] causes, I shall say what suffices for something\nto be an immediate cause, namely that when it is present there occurs\nthe effect, and when it is not present \u2026 the effect does not\noccur. And everything that has this character with respect to another\nis the cause of that other \u2026 That this is sufficient for one\nthing to be the cause of another, seems manifest. Because if not,\nthere remains no way of knowing something to be the cause of something\nelse. (Ockham Ord. I dist. 45, qu. 1)\n\n\nIt is tempting to see this as a reduction of the idea of causation to\nthat of the regular association of kinds of events. One could even\nargue that such a view would be a logical consequence of Ockham\u2019s\nnominalism (Klocker 1980: 351). But Ockham\u2019s point here seems to\nbe epistemological, not metaphysical: this is how we discover a cause\n(Adams 1979: 23). It follows that the only kind of cause we can\ndiscover is that which produces a novel (and therefore observable)\neffect. Without such an effect, there would (once again) be no way of\nknowing something to be a cause (Ockham Sum. II 3). Coupled\nwith the effective abandonment of the idea of the agent intellect,\nthis brings us very close to a thoroughgoing cognitive empiricism.\n",
