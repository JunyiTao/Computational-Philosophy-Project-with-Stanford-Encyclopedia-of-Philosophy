    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of mind || Type-identity theories\n3.1 Type-identity theories\n\nType-identity theory claims that for types of some domain\nD1, (e.g., psychology) there are types of a domain\nD2 (e.g., neuroscience) such that for any member\nx of D1, there is a member y of\nD2 such that x=y. This aspect is\nrevealed in the theory\u2019s name\u2014it is type-identity\ntheory. It is not just the items falling under the types that are said\nto be identical but also the types themselves; e.g., being a pain is\nsaid to be the very same type as being a certain pattern of neural\nfiring. However, just to claim that for any type x of some\ndomain D1, there is a type y of a domain\nD2 such that x=y does not make you a\ntype-identity theorist. Rather, it is a specific reductionist as well\nas a naturalist stance that accompany these identity-claims that make\nthem proper \u201ctype-identity\u201d claims.\n\nThe main concern was to defend this position against various\ncounterarguments. The question of what exactly makes this position\nreductive did not receive considerable attention. Primarily,\nthis theory is a monistic theory; but monism is not identical to\nreductionism. Herbert Feigl gives the following characterization of\ntype-identity theory when answering the question of \u201cwhether the\nmental and the physical can in some sense be identified\u201d:\n\n\n[I]t is proper to speak of \u201cidentification [\u2026]\u201d.\nConcepts of molar behavior theory like habit strength, expectancy,\ndrive, instinct, memory trace, repression, superego, etc., may yet be\nidentified in a future psychophysiology with specific types of\nneural-structure-and-process patterns. (Feigl 1967: 77)\n\n\nThis quote suggests a connection between type-identity theories and\nmodels of theory-reduction: It suggests that reduction, understood as\nan inter-theory relation, is closely related to type-identity theory.\nThe idea seems to be this: Within a future psychophysiology, the fact\nthat mental types are identical to physiological types might be\nrevealed, and the nature of mental states will ultimately be given in\nterms of psychophysiology, rather then in terms of psychology. Similar\npositions have been held by Place (1954, 1956, 1960), who primarily\nspeaks of constitution rather than identity, whereas Smart explicitly\nstated this thesis in terms of identity (Smart 1959).\n",
