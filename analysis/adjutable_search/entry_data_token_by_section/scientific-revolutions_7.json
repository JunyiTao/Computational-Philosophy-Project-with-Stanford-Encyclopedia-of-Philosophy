Kuhn asks (p. 60), \u201cWhy is progress a perquisite\nreserved almost exclusively for the activities we call science\u201d\nand not for art, political theory, or philosophy? Early critics took\nhim to deny scientific progress, because he rejected the traditional\ncorrespondence theory of truth and the related idea of cumulative\nprogress toward a representational truth waiting out there for science\nto find it. For Kuhn the internalist, the technical goals of science\nare endogenously generated and change over time, rapidly during\nrevolutions. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, Kuhn regarded revolutions as\nthe most progressive components of his model of science.\nUnfortunately, he was not able to articulate fully in what that\nprogress consists, given the issues of truth, incommensurability and\nKuhn loss, a problem that those who reject convergent scientific\nrealism still face. However, problem-solving know-how and success,\nincluding predictive precision, are major components of his answer.\n\u201c[T]he unit of scientific achievement is the solved\nproblem....\u201d (p. 169). In a retreat from his most radical\nstatements, Kuhn responded to critics by saying that we do possess a\ngeneral set of scientific values that enables us, usually pretty\neasily, to order scientific works in historical time according to the\ndegree in which they realize these values. A new paradigm, he says,\nmust always treat successfully a serious anomaly left by the old one\nas well as opening up new questions for fruitful investigation.\n\nKuhn\u2019s emphasis on scientific practices, relative to the\nphilosophical state of play in the 1960s, takes up some of the slack\nleft by the rejection of strong realism. His emphasis on skilled\npractice may have been influenced by Michael Polanyi\u2019s\nPersonal Knowledge (1958), with its \u201ctacit\nknowing\u201d component, although Kuhn denied that he found\nPolanyi\u2019s account appealing (see, e.g., Baltas et al., 2000, pp.\n296f).\n\nIf there have been so many revolutions, then why did the world have to\nwait for Kuhn to see them? Because, he said, they are largely\ninvisible. For, after a revolution, the winners rewrite the history of\nscience to make it look as if the present paradigm is the brilliant\nbut rational sequel to previous work. The implication is that only\nsomeone of Kuhn\u2019s historical sensitivity could be expected to\nnotice this. (Skeptical critics reply that Kuhn invented the problem\nfor which he had a solution.) Indeed, in his large book on the history\nof the early quantum theory (Kuhn 1978), he moved the origin of the\nquantum theory revolution forward five years, from Planck in 1900 to\nEinstein and Ehrenfest in 1905. Revisionist historiography by whiggish\nscientists, he claimed, had smoothed out the actual history by\ncrediting Planck with a solution that he actually rejected at the time\nto a problem that he did not then have\u2014and by diminishing the\ntruly radical contribution of Einstein. Kuhn\u2019s move again raises\nthe question whether the authors of a revolution must knowingly break\nfrom the received research tradition.\n",
