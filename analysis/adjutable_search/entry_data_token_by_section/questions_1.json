    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Questions, answers, and presuppositions\n1.1 Questions, answers, and presuppositions\n\nFamiliar considerations from the philosophy of language make it clear\nthat one should distinguish interrogative sentences from their\ncontents and distinguish both of these from the speech acts that can\nbe performed via the utterance of interrogative sentences. For\nexample, Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) understand a question to be an\nabstract thing for which an interrogative sentence is a piece of\nnotation. This parallels the distinction between propositions and the\ndeclarative sentences that express them. The structure and composition\nof a question (understood as the abstract content of an interrogative\nsentence) vary from theory to theory. The speech act of asking a\nquestion is standardly regarded, e.g., by Searle (1969, 69), as a\nspecial case of the illocutionary act of requesting. Searle\ndistinguishes requesting information (asking a real question) from\nrequesting that the hearer display knowledge (asking an exam\nquestion). \u00c5qvist (1965) connects questions with speaker\nknowledge rather than hearer knowledge by proposing that to ask a\nquestion is to command the hearer to cause the speaker to know the\nquestion\u2019s answer.\n\nAs is already clear, an important concept in many theories of\nquestions is that of an answer, sometimes called a direct\nanswer. Many theorists agree that an answer is a piece of\nlanguage or semantic object that, as Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) put\nit, \u201ccompletely, but just completely, answers the\nquestion.\u201d A sentence or proposition need not be true to be a\ndirect answer. Whether each question can be associated with a definite\nset of direct answers is a controversial matter, however. Most authors\nrequire answers to be sentences or propositions, so that answers to a\nquestion are the kind of thing that is true or false. Tichy (1978) is\na striking exception and argues that answers can be of any logical\ntype. Consider this example:\n\n(1) Who was the\nPresident of the USA in 1978?\n  a.\nJimmy Carter was the\nPresident of the USA in 1978. \n  b.\nGerald Ford was the\nPresident of the USA in 1978. \n  c.\nJimmy Carter\n\n  d.\nGerald Ford\n\n  e.\nSomeone over three\ninches tall was the President of the USA in 1978. \n\n\nMost theorists would say that (1a) is the correct answer to (1), that\n(1b) is an answer but not the correct answer, and that (1c\u2013e)\nare not answers to (1) at all. Tichy would say that, among\n(1a\u2013e), only (1c\u2013d) are answers, and (1c) is the correct\nanswer. Braun (2006) would count (1a\u2013b) as answers and include\n(1e) as both an answer and a correct answer. What these different\ntheoretical interpretations of the notion of an answer show is there\nis no univocal pre-theoretical notion of an answer. The notion should\nrather be seen as a technical one, which can differ from one theory to\nanother. Some theorists make explicit what they understand answers to\nbe, but some leave this implicit. This can be problematic: without\nexplication of which pre-theoretical construct the technical notion of\nan answer in a given theory is intended to capture, the theory cannot\nbe evaluated empirically.\n\nA second important basic concept connected with questions is that of a\npresupposition. Belnap and Steel (1976, 5) define a question\nas presupposing a statement if and only if the truth of the statement\nis a logically necessary condition for there being a true (i.e.,\ncorrect) answer to the question. For example, (1a) presupposes the\nfollowing:\n\n(2) The USA had exactly\none President in 1978.\n\n\nTo deny a presupposition of a question is to give a corrective\nanswer to the question, but most theorists join Belnap and Steel\nin not counting corrective answers as direct answers.\n",
