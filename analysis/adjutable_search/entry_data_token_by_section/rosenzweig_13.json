    "main_text": "The Star of Redemption || Speech-Thinking\n3.4 Speech-Thinking\n\n\nThe second part of the Star is also home to\nRosenzweig\u2019s account of \u201cspeech-thinking,\u201d the\ncenterpiece of his contribution to the \u201cnew thinking\u201d in\nthe Star. Here Rosenzweig understands himself to be working\nout a form of the \u201cnarrative\u201d or \u201chistorical\u201d\nthinking which Schelling described, in the preface to his Ages of\nthe World, as the necessary complement to the philosophy of\nreason. Rosenzweig presents speech as more deeply linked to temporal\nexperience than is rational thought, and hence as a tool eminently\ncapable of grasping and articulating the relations of creation,\nrevelation, and redemption which we experience in time. We express our\nexperience of time through the tenses of language. We grasp the things\nof the world through our naming of them and in the stories we tell\nabout them. I articulate my own selfhood by calling myself\n\u201cI\u201d, and I experience my most intimate personal\nrelationships through a personal address to others as\n\u201cYou,\u201d or through calling them by their first names. In\nsong, moreover, Rosenzweig suggests we have a form of speech in which\nwe articulate the supreme hopes we anticipate for our future.\n\n\nIn the second part of the Star, Rosenzweig suggests that we\ncan grasp through speech the relations into which God, world, and the\nself enter, first and foremost, because speech in fact accompanies the\nwhole of the course that leads from creation to redemption. As that\nwhich makes us human, Rosenzweig claims, the power of speech is\nimplicit in every human being since creation; and yet the complete\nfulfillment of speech in a universal language that would be equally\neach person\u2019s own and at once common to all, can only be imagined\nas part of the redemptive future of humankind. In between creation and\nredemption, language both unites and divides people from one another:\nwe all share speech, but speech is different in every mouth. Within the\ncourse of the systematic relations between God, world, and self that\nstretches from creation to redemption, Rosenzweig thus understands\nlanguage as a tool of unification that does not reduce different\nindividuals to that which is the same: speech only unites those who\nrecognize or understand each other.\n\n\nRosenzweig thus views speech as the unifying thread whose genesis\naccompanies the relational advance of God, world, and self from\ncreation through revelation to redemption, and thus as an\n\u201corganon\u201d at our disposal for grasping these relations.\nEach step in the genesis of speech accompanies one of the relations we\nexperience along the path God, world, and self take towards their\nultimate unification in the \u201cAll.\u201d Rosenzweig presents the\ngeneration of the grammatical building blocks of narrative as\nintegral to creation, the relation between God and the world which we\nexperience as past. He presents the revelatory relation between God and\nthe self as a dialogue between an \u201cI\u201d and a\n\u201cYou\u201d always experienced as present; and he shows how\nboth the divine \u201cI\u201d and the self as\n\u201cYou,\u201d are constituted as such through such reciprocal\ndialogic exchange. And Rosenzweig depicts the redemptive bringing\ntogether of the worldly objects of narrative and the persons of\ndialogue in the communal song that anticipates the ultimate\nunity of redemption.\n\n\nThe speech-thinking of the second part of the Star seeks to\nshow that relations between particular beings are best grasped through\nspeech. But more importantly, Rosenzweig demonstrates in his\n\u201cspeech thinking\u201d that these relations occur\nthrough speech. Speech, Rosenzweig suggests, is the tool through which\nwe come to recognize ourselves as selves, and which at once unites us\nwith others along our path towards redemption. Speech, for Rosenzweig,\nis thus not only a tool for grasping relations. It is a tool for\nrealizing the path to the \u201cAll\u201d through relations.\n\n\nBy the end of the second part of the Star, Rosenzweig has\nset forth the course of his system, along which particular beings enter\ninto relations that will ultimately bring about their unification\nwithin the \u201cAll.\u201d Rosenzweig celebrates this achievement,\nat the end of the book\u2019s second part, by presenting the reader\nwith the geometric image that he suggests is constructed out of the\nelements in their relations. Depicting God, world, and self as three\npoints equidistant from one another, he shows, yields a single\ntriangle. The relations between each of the elements, furthermore,\nsuggest three further points, each one between those two elements which\nunite through it. The image befitting the system, Rosenzweig thereby\nproclaims, is not the \u201ccircle\u201d which has steered\nphilosophical thinking from Anaximander to Hegel, but rather the\nsix-pointed star formed by the three elemental points coupled with the\nthree points of relation into which the elements enter: the star of\nredemption.\n\n\nBefore turning to survey the third and final part of the\nStar, we should note here the situation Rosenzweig\u2019s\nreader finds herself in by the time she arrives at the end of the\nsecond part of the book. By this point in the Star, the reader\nhas been asked to see herself as situated in the middle of the course\nleading to the unification of the \u201cAll\u201d. As a result, the\nbook directs a certain challenge to the reader to take up her role in\nthe systematic advance towards the redemptive unity which Rosenzweig\nenvisions. Because the unity of the \u201cAll\u201d is projected as\nfuture, that is, the reader is called on to do her part to realize in\nactuality the very system of the \u201cAll\u201d which she may come\nto know through reading the Star.\n",
