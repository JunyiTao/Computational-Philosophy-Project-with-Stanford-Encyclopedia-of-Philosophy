    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Lying || Untruthfulness Condition\n1.2 Untruthfulness Condition\n\n\nAccording to the untruthfulness condition, lying requires that a\nperson make an untruthful statement, that is, make a\nstatement that she believes to be false. Note that this\ncondition is to be distinguished from the putative necessary condition\nfor lying that the statement that the person makes be false\n(Grotius 2005, 1209; Krishna 1961, 146). The falsity condition is not\na necessary condition for lying according to L1.\nStatements that\nare truthful may be false. If George makes the\nstatement to Hillary (with the intention that Hillary believe that statement\nto be true), \u201cThe enemy has weapons of mass destruction,\u201d\nand that statement is false, he is not lying if\nhe does not believe that statement to be false.\nStatements that are untruthful may be true. In Jean-Paul\nSartre\u2019s short-story, The Wall, set during the Spanish\nCivil War, Pablo Ibbieta, a prisoner sentenced to be executed by the\nFascists, is interrogated by his guards as to the whereabouts of his\ncomrade Ramon Gris. Mistakenly believing Gris to be hiding with his\ncousins, he makes the untruthful statement to them that \u201cGris is\nhiding in the cemetery\u201d (with the intention that they believe\nthis statement to be true). As it happens, Gris is hiding in the\ncemetery, and the statement is true. Gris is arrested at the cemetery,\nand Ibbieta is released (Sartre 1937; cf. Siegler 1966: 130).\nAccording to L1, Ibbieta lied to his interrogators, although the\nuntruthful statement he made to them was true, and he did not deceive\nthem about the whereabouts of Gris (Isenberg 1973, 248; Mannison 1969,\n138; Lindley, 1971; Kupfer 1982, 104; Faulkner 2013).\n\n\nIf a person makes a truthful statement with the intention to deceive\nanother person, then she is not lying, according to the untruthfulness\ncondition. For example, if John and Mary are dating, and Valentino is\nMary\u2019s ex-boyfriend, and one evening \u201cJohn asks Mary,\n\u2018Have you seen Valentino this week?,\u2019\u201d and\n\u201cMary answers: \u2018Valentino\u2019s been sick with\nmononucleosis for the past two weeks,\u2019\u201d and\n\u201cValentino has in fact been sick with mononucleosis for the past\ntwo weeks, but it is also the case that Mary had a date with Valentino\nthe night before\u201d (Coleman and Kany 1981, 31), then Mary is not\nlying to John, even if she is attempting to deceive John. This is what\nis called a palter (see Schauer and Zeckhauser 2009; they\nillegitimately add that a palter must succeed in deceiving),\nor a false implicature (Adler 1997), or an attempt to\nmislead (Saul 2012b; Webber 2013).\n\n\nIn addition to palters not being lies, a double bluff is not\na lie either according to the untruthfulness condition. If one makes a\ntruthful statement, intending one\u2019s addressee to believe that\nthe statement is false, then one is not lying. Consider the following\njoke about two travelers on a train from Moscow (reputed to be Sigmund\nFreud's favorite joke) (Cohen 2002, 328):\n\nTrofim: Where are you going? \nPavel: To Pinsk.\nTrofim: Liar! You say you are going to Pinsk in order to make me\nbelieve you are going to Minsk. But I know you are going to\nPinsk.\n\n\nPavel does not lie to Trofim, since his statement to Trofim is\ntruthful, even if he intends that Trofim be deceived by this double\nbluff.\n\n\nOne implication of the untruthfulness condition is that if a person\nmakes a statement that she believes to be neither true nor false, then\nshe cannot be lying (Siegler 1966, 133; cf. Strawson 1952, 173). For\nexample, if a person begging for money says \u201cAll my children need\nmedical attention,\u201d but believes that this proposition is neither\ntrue nor false, because he has no children, then he is not lying, even\nif he is attempting to deceive (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 155\u20136; but\nsee Siegler 1966, 135).\n It is a matter of debate as to whether it is possible to lie using\nmetaphors. For example, if a gardener who has had a very bad crop of\ntomatoes says \u201cWe\u2019ve got tomatoes coming out of our\nears,\u201d intending to deceive about his having a bumper crop, then\nthis untruthful statement made with an intention to deceive is\ntypically not considered a lie, because the untruthful statement is\nmetaphorical (Saul 2012, 16). Nevertheless, some argue that it is\npossible to lie using metaphors (Adler 1997, 444 n. 27; Griffiths\n2004, 36; Dynel 2011, 149).  If literally false metaphorical\nstatements can be truthful statements, according to the beliefs of the\nspeaker, and hence, can be untruthful statements, according to the\nbeliefs of the speaker, then the deceptive gardener is lying in this\nexample according to L1.\n",
