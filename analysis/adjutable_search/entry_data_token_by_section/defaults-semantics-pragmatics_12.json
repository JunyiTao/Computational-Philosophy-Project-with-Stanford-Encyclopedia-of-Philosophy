    "main_text": "Defaults and Accountability\n6. Concluding Remarks and Future Prospects\n\nThis comparison of various selected approaches to default\ninterpretations in semantics and pragmatics allows for some\ngeneralizations. Firstly, it is evident from the surveyed literature\nthat, contrary to the assumptions of some experimental pragmaticists,\nthere is no one, unique \u2018default model\u2019 of utterance\ninterpretation. Instead, default (and salient) meanings are recognised\nin many approaches to utterance interpretation but they are defined by\ndifferent sets of characteristic features. Next, in the present state\nof theorizing, data-based analyses and experimenting, while the\nrationale for default interpretations is strong, some of the\nproperties of such interpretations are still in need of further\ninvestigation. For example, the discussions of locality of defaults\nand their subdoxastic arrival are in need of empirical support before\nthey can be taken any further. In other words, a \u2018fluid\ncharacter\u2019 is in need of empirical identification \u2013 and\neven more so when we add the dynamic perspective of interactively\nachieved, co-constructed meanings.\n\nMoreover, the principle and method for delimiting a default\ninterpretation as distinguished from an inferential interpretation is\nstill a task for the future. The existence of a shortcut through\ncostly inference is an appealing and hardly controversial thesis but\nthe exact properties of such meanings are still subject to\ndisputes.\n\nNext, the automatic arrival at context-dependent meanings has to be\ndiscussed as part of the debate between the direct access view and the\nmodular view of language processing. Direct access predicts that\ncontext is responsible for activating relevant senses to the extent\nthat the salience of the particular sense of a lexical item does not\nplay a part. According to the modular view, lexical meanings that are\nnot appropriate for the context are also activated, only to be\nsuppressed at a further stage of processing. With the rise of theories\nthat sit between these polar views, the question of the compatibility\nof the salience in the lexicon and the default status of utterance\ninterpretations requires more attention. What can be attributed to the\nlexicon and what to the context of utterance remains an unresolved\nquestion.\n\nFinally, whether we approach defaults through distributional\ncomputational semantics, theoretical truth-conditional semantics,\npost-Gricean pragmatics, or some version of a combined view, progress\nin research on defaults in human reasoning will necessarily require\nprogress in technology. No matter how powerful our theories are, they\nwill have to be tested either on large corpora, or through\nneuroimaging: more traditional methods of psycholinguistic experiments\nor small databases will always leave a wide margin of doubt as to\n\u2018is it really how human reasoning works\u2019? If there are big\ngeneralizations to be made regarding how we jump to conclusions, these\nwill have to be modern equivalents of the 19th century\nphenomenological ideas, founded on intentionality of mental states,\ninformativeness of acts of communication, all predicted by assumed\nefficiency (but not necessarily cooperation), but with access to\nmodern methods of empirical corroboration (or falsification).\n\nIn this context, can we safely assume that the concept of default\nmeaning will sail with the most successful approaches to human\ncommunication, or is it in need of precisification now, when it is so\ndiversely used (and sometimes misused)? Conceptual engineering is\noften a risky business. But going along with the common-sense use is\nnot so: meanings that \u2018spring to mind\u2019 are default\nmeanings \u2013 it is just that for some purposes we want to talk\nabout meanings and associations that spring to mind in the context\nof a particular discourse, and for others, in the language\nsystem alone. This degree of flexibility, further justified by\ndiverse objectives in employing the concept \u2013 as diverse as,\nsay, making an interlocutor accountable for a strongly conveyed but\n\u2019unsaid\u2019 insult on the one hand, and devising algorithms\nfor training machines to use language to communicate on the other, is\nprobably not so difficult for theorists of meaning to live with.\n",
