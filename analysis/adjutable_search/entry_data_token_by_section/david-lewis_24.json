    "main_text": "Other Writings || Bayesian Philosophy\n7.3 Bayesian Philosophy\n\nThis subsection is largely about two pairs of papers:\n\u201cProbabilities of Conditionals and Conditional\nProbabilities\u201d (1976b) and its sequel (1986h), and \u201cDesire\nas Belief\u201d (1988b) and its sequel (1996a). The papers have more\nin common than merely having a common naming convention.\n(They\u2019re not even Lewis\u2019s only sequels; \u201cLucas\nAgainst Mechanism\u201d (1969b) also has a sequel (1979d).) In both\ncases Lewis aims to defend orthodox\n Bayesian epistemology\n against some challenges. And in both cases the argument turns on\nprinciples to do with updating. Lewis was throughout his career a\nBayesian; he frequently said that the ideal epistemic agent was a\nBayesian conditionaliser and expected utility maximiser. And he\ndefended this position with some gusto.\n\nThe conditionals papers concern a position that was gaining popularity\nbefore Lewis showed it was untenable. The position in question starts\nwith the idea that a speaker can properly say Probably,\nif p, q if and only if their subjective probability\nof q given p is high. And the position then offers\nan explanation of this purported fact. The English word\n\u2018if\u2019 is a binary connective which forms a sentence to be\nwritten as p \u2192 q, and it is true in virtue of\nthe meaning of this connective that Pr(q |\np) = Pr(p \u2192 q). So, assuming\n\u2018probably\u2019 means something like subjective probability\nProbably, if p, q means that the subjective\nprobability of p \u2192 q, and, assuming the agent\nis coherent, that is true just in case the subjective probability of\nq given p is high.\n\nLewis doubted several aspects of this story. He briefly notes in\n\u201cAdverbs of Quantification\u201d that he didn\u2019t think the\n\u2018if\u2019 in Probably, if p, q is a\nbinary connective. But the more telling objection was his proof that\nthere could not be a connective \u2192 such that for all p,\nq, Pr(q | p) =\nPr(p \u2192 q). Lewis first argued for this\nin (1976b), and showed how to weaken some of the assumptions of the\nargument in (1986h). The effect of Lewis\u2019s position was to\nessentially end the hope of analysing English \u2018if\u2019 in\nterms of a binary connective with these probabilistic properties.\n\nThe desire papers (1988a, 1996b) are also about the Humean view that\nmotivation requires both a belief and a desire. Lewis aims to attack\nthe anti-Humean position that some beliefs, in particular beliefs that\na certain thing is good, can play the functional roles of both beliefs\nand desires. He argues that this is not, in general, possible. And the\nargument is that beliefs and desires update in different ways. Or, at\nleast, that anyone who updates their beliefs by conditionalisation and\nupdates their valuation functions in a plausible way, will not be able\nto preserve a perfect correlation between their desire for a\nproposition being true and their belief in that proposition\u2019s\ngoodness.\n\nBoth of these papers rely on the idea that conditionalisation is a\ngood way to update beliefs. Neither, by the way, rely on the idea that\nconditionalisation is the only rational way to update beliefs; the\narguments go through given merely the permissibility of\nconditionalising. Many Bayesians hold something stronger, namely that\nconditionalisation is the way to update beliefs. One widely\nused argument in favour of this position is a so-called \u2018Dutch\nBook\u2019 argument. This argument shows that if you plan to follow\nany strategy for revising beliefs other than conditionalisation, and\nyou do follow that strategy, then someone who knows the strategy that\nyou\u2019re going to follow can produce a series of bets that will\nseem favourable to you when each is offered, but which will\ncollectively lead to a sure loss. It is also true that if you do\nupdate by conditionalisation, there is no similar Dutch Book that can\nbe made, but Lewis did not prove this. (It is Theorem V in Skyrms\n(1987).) The Dutch Book argument for conditionalisation was introduced\nto the literature by Paul Teller (1976), who credited it to Lewis.\nLewis\u2019s own version of the argument did not appear until 1999,\nin Papers in Metaphysics and Epistemology, under the title\n\u201cWhy Conditionalize?\u201d (1999b). This was something he had\nwritten as a course handout in 1972, and which had been very widely\ncirculated, and, via Teller\u2019s paper, very influential on the\ndevelopment of Bayesian epistemology.\n\nLewis was an early proponent of one of the two major views about the\nSleeping Beauty puzzle, which is nicely described in Sorensen\n2009:\n\nSleeping Beauty is an ideal reasoner who knows she will be given a\nsleeping pill that induces limited amnesia. She knows that after she\nfalls asleep a coin will be flipped. If it lands heads, she will be\nawakened on Monday and asked: \u201cWhat is the probability that the\ncoin landed heads?\u201d. She will not be informed which day it is.\nIf the coin lands tails, she will be awaken on both Monday and on\nTuesday and asked the same question each time. The amnesia insures\nthat, if awakened on Tuesday she will not remember being woken on\nMonday. What will her answer be to the questions?\n\n\nThe puzzle was introduced to the philosophical community by Adam Elga\n(2000), who argued that when Beauty woke up, her credence in Heads\nshould be 1\u20443. Lewis argued that the\ncorrect answer was 1\u20442. The core of his\nargument was that before Beauty went to sleep, her credence in Heads\nshould be 1\u20442. That was agreed on all\nsides. Moreover, nothing happened that surprised Beauty. Indeed,\neverything happened exactly as she expected it would. Lewis argued\nthat \u201cOnly new relevant evidence, centred or uncentred, produces\na change in credence\u201d (2001c: 174), and that Beauty got no new\nevidence. This idea has featured heavily in subsequent work defending\nthe 1\u20442 answer to the Sleeping Beauty\npuzzle.\n\nThe Sleeping Beauty puzzle is important for another reason. As the\nquote above indicates, the puzzle is usually set up in terms of sets\nof centered worlds, following the work of Lewis we described in\nsection 4.5. The work generated by the puzzle has been one of the\nreasons that that work, in particular (1979b), has received a large\namount of attention in recent years.\n\n",
