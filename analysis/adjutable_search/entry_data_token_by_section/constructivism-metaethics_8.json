    "main_text": "Constructivism About Moral Principles || Constructivism About Right and Wrong\n5.1 Constructivism About Right and Wrong\n\nThomas Scanlon defends a restricted constructivist account of\njustification for a specific class of moral judgments of right and\nwrong (Scanlon 1998: 11\u201312, chapter 4, \u00a77.2; 2008,\n2014>: 94\u201398). In contrast to Korsgaard and O\u2019Neill,\nScanlon rejects Kantian constructivism as a broad metaethical view\nabout all normative truths. Part of his argument is that moral matters\ncannot be resolved by appealing to the bare structure of rationality\n(the constitutive norm of practical reason) and instead, need to be\naddressed by engaging in substantive arguments (Scanlon 2003b:\n14\u201315, Scanlon 2014: 90\u2013104), although this is something\nthat many Kantians would concede. His aim is to elucidate the truth of\nclaims concerning right and wrong in terms of their being entailed\nfrom the point of view of a certain contractual situation.\n\nScanlon\u2019s method of construction is the contractualist formula\naccording to which an act is wrong if its performance under the\ncircumstances would be prohibited by any set of principles that no one\ncould reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced, general\nagreement. This test of rejectability specifies the content of moral\nprinciples, and tells us why it is rational for us to adopt them. The\ncorrectness of moral principles is explained in terms of a\nhypothetical agreement among the relevant set of individuals specified\nin terms of their motivation and the process of reasoning they employ.\nThere are no correct moral principles independently of the rational\nagreement that the criterion of rejectability specifies. The property\nof being right is constituted by what a group of reasonable agents,\nunder certain specified conditions, would find non-rejectable (Scanlon\n1998: 380 n 48).\n\nThe test of rejectability is compatible with several kinds of\ndisagreement about right and wrong, in particular, with disagreement\nabout the standards for assessing conduct, and about the reasons for\nsupporting these standards. To acknowledge the latter sorts of\ndisagreement does not lead to relativism: it does not entail that\nthere is no answer to the question of which side is correct about the\nreasons people have or that all answers are equally valid.\n\nScanlon argues that the constructivist account of general normativity\nis exposed to the objection of bootstrapping, because it tries to\njustify the normativity of reasons by a method that already assumes\nthe normativity of reason (Scanlon 2014: 96\u2013104). Thus, unlike\nKorsgaard and Street, Scanlon holds that truths about reasons for\naction are not true in virtue of being arrived at through some\nspecified procedure of \u201cconstruction\u201d. We can arrive at\nconclusions about reasons by engaging in normative reasoning, (for\nexample employing the method of reflective equilibrium.) But the steps\nin reasoning of this kind involve making substantive judgments about\nwhat reasons we have. Because it requires such judgments as inputs,\nreasoning of this kind is not a process through which all facts about\nreasons are constructed (Scanlon 2014: 102\u2013103).\n\nAccording to Scanlon, in order for there to be truths about reasons,\nit is not necessary for these normative facts to have a kind of\nmetaphysical reality that good normative reasoning might not\nguarantee. There is no question \u201cexternal\u201d to ordinary\nfirst-order normative thinking about whether such facts really exist,\njust as there is no such \u201cexternal\u201d question about\nmathematical facts (Scanlon 2014: 16\u201326.) In this regard,\nScanlon\u2019s view bears some deep similarities with Rudolph\nCarnap\u2019s theory (Carnap 1956). Scanlon\u2019s normative realism\nis thus less \u201crobust\u201d than what some other realists such\nas David Enoch believe is required (Scanlon 2014: 14, compare Enoch\n2011a: 112\u2013113).\n",
