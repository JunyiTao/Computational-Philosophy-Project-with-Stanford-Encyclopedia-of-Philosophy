    "main_text": "Logic || The Basis of Bolzano\u2019s Logic and of his Whole Philosophy\n3.3 The Basis of Bolzano\u2019s Logic and of his Whole Philosophy\n\nSomething could be true even if nobody knew that it were so. We\ntherefore need a concept of truth that does not require of every truth\nthat someone knows it. For this concept Bolzano introduced the term\n\u2018Wahrheit an sich\u2019 (\u2018truth in\nitself\u2019). If something is a truth and no human being knows\nthat it is, then \u2014 for Bolzano \u2014 it must be a \u201ctruth\nin itself\u201d. A \u201ctruth in itself\u201d (Wahrheit an\nsich) is nothing but a true proposition, i.e., a proposition that\nhas the property of being true. Bolzano takes the proof that there is\nat least one \u201ctruth in itself\u201d to be fundamental not only\nfor logic and for philosophy in general, but for any science. Bolzano\noffers therefore several arguments such as the following ones for the\nclaim that there must be \u201ctruths in themselves\u201d: (i) There\nare obviously truths that are unknown and therefore (so Bolzano)\n\u201ctruths in themselves\u201d. E.g. one of the two propositions\n\u201cThere are winged snakes\u201d or \u201cThere are no winged\nsnakes\u201d must be true, but we do not know which one (WL I, 108);\nand one of the propositions stating of a specific tree at a specific\nmoment that it bears a certain number of blossoms must be true, even\nif nobody knows which one (WL I, 112). (ii) The Pythagorean theorem or\nthe Copernican theory that the earth rotates around the sun have not\nbecome true by their discoveries but have always been true, i.e.\n(according to Bolzano), they are \u201ctruths in themselves\u201d\n(Zimmermann 1847, 71 f., 136). (iii) If no thinking being existed, it\nwere true that there exists no thinking being, but this (according to\nBolzano) could only be a \u201ctruth in itself\u201d (Bolzano 1839,\n150). There is one proof for the existence of a \u201ctruth in\nitself\u201d or a true proposition, however, which Bolzano takes to\nbe decisive. It is an improved version of the traditional refutation\nof scepticism by self-application (RW I, 35, WL I, 145). Before we\npresent and discuss this proof, a terminological remark seems to be in\norder: The word \u2018truth\u2019 (as well as the German word\n\u2018Wahrheit\u2019) is ambiguous insofar as it denotes the\nproperty of being true on the one hand and a bearer of this property\n(a true proposition, a true sentence, a true judgment etc.) on the\nother hand (WL I, 108 f.). Only the latter can be meant, however, as\nsoon as the word \u2018truth\u2019 is preceded by the indefinite\narticle (\u2018a truth\u2019) or if it is put into the plural form\n(\u2018truths\u2019). It is in such clear cases only that we will\nallow the word \u2018truth(s)\u2019 without epithet to be used in\nthe sense of Bolzano\u2019s \u2018truth in itself\u2019 or\n\u2018truths in themselves\u2019, but otherwise we will use\n\u2018true proposition(s)\u2019 instead to avoid confusion. In\ngeneral we will therefore reserve the word \u2018truth\u2019 for the\nproperty of being true. That being said, we can now turn to\nBolzano\u2019s alleged proof for the existence of true\npropositions:\n\nThere is no true proposition (assumption of reductio),\ni.e.: No proposition is true.\nThe sense of (1), i.e., of \u2018There is no true\nproposition\u2019, is a proposition.\nThe proposition which is the sense of (1) is not true (from (1)\nand (2)).\nIt is not the case that there is no true proposition (from (3) and\n(1) \u2014 in contradiction to (1)).\nThere is a (i.e., at least one) true proposition (from\n(1)\u2013(4) by reductio).\n\n\nThe improvement of Bolzano\u2019s version of this traditional proof\nconsists in Bolzano\u2019s explicitly mentioning premise (2) as\nindispensable for the deduction (WL I, 145, 151; cf. also WL IV, 282\nf.), thus making clear that the proof would not go through if this\npremise were not accepted. The inference of (4) from (3) and (1) is\nvindicated by Bolzano\u2019s explication of propositional negation\n(see section 3.4). Bolzano is not content with having proven\n(allegedly) that there is at least one true proposition; he wants even\nto prove by mathematical induction that there are more and even\ninfinitely many true propositions (see section 11.2).\n\nThe above derivation is an illustrative example of Bolzano\u2019s\nimportation of proof methods from mathematics \u2014 such as the\nmethods of indirect proof and of mathematical induction \u2014 into\nphilosophy. (For certain reservations concerning these methods cf. WL\nIV, 269\u2013285.) Nevertheless, this alleged proof for the existence\nof a true proposition does not reach its goal for a simple reason: The\nproof is in no way peculiar for truths in the sense of true\npropositions as Bolzano needs to have it. If successful at\nall, it would work in the same way also for proving the existence of\ntrue judgments or true sentences (understood as linguistic entities).\nA proof for the existence of at least one truth in itself,\ni.e., a true proposition, requires premise (2). In premise\n(2), however, the existence of a proposition is already presupposed\nsince it is shorthand for what can be explicitly stated as: There is a\n(i.e., at least one) proposition which is the sense of (1). Thus, if\nwe take the derivation as a proof for the existence of at least one\ntrue proposition, we will succumb to an obvious petitio\nprincipii. By \u2014 correctly \u2014 requiring the addition of\npremise (2) to be necessary for the formal correctness of the proof,\nBolzano unwittingly displayed its failure due to an informal fallacy.\nBolzano himself, however, was convinced that he had correctly and\nsuccessfully proven that there are \u201ctruths in\nthemselves\u201d. From this it follows that there must be\npropositions, since \u201ctruths in themselves\u201d are a certain\nkind of propositions (WL I, 111 f.). And since in every proposition\nideas are contained as its parts, a further consequence is that there\nare also ideas. For every proposition there is also another\nproposition that is its propositional negation. The propositional\nnegation of a true proposition is a false proposition. Therefore,\namong propositions there must also be false ones. They are often\noverlooked because a special name such as \u2018falsehood in\nitself\u2019 was never introduced \u201cofficially\u201d for them\nand is at least not customary.\n\nAs far as the ontological status of propositions and ideas is\nconcerned, Bolzano stresses again and again their objectivity, i.e.,\ntheir independence from thinking in general and from the minds and\nmental phenomena of thinking beings by which they are\n\u201cgrasped\u201d in particular. Bolzano does not only accentuate\nthe objectivity of propositions and ideas, but he also lays particular\nemphasis on their being not real (wirklich), whereby\n\u2018real\u2019 means, in Bolzano\u2019s terminology, the same as\nefficacious (wirksam, which derives etymologically from the\nverb \u2018wirken\u2019 from which also \u2018wirklich\u2019 is\nderived). The realm of reality includes everything in space and time\nand herewith all material objects and events of the physical world\n(i.e., Popper\u2019s World 1) as well as all mental (or\n\u201cpsychical\u201d) phenomena of our inner world (i.e., World 2).\n(In addition, Bolzano includes in his realm of reality also God who is\noutside of space and time.) Propositions and ideas belong to a\n\u201cthird realm\u201d (World 3) outside of Bolzano\u2019s realm\nof reality which encompasses World 1 and World 2. Unfortunately,\nBolzano uses the nouns \u2018Existenz\u2019\n(\u2018existence\u2019) and \u2018Sein\u2019\n(\u2018being\u2019) synonymously with\n\u2018Wirklichkeit\u2019 (\u2018reality\u2019);\nhe therefore states again and again that there are (es\ngibt) propositions and ideas but they do not exist and\nthey do not have being. This peculiar \u2014 if not odd\n\u2014 terminology has caused numerous misunderstandings, not only\nabout Bolzano\u2019s views but also for Bolzano himself,\ne.g., in his discussion about Kant\u2019s dictum that being\nis not a real predicate. (Despite Bolzano\u2019s terminological\nconvention, we will here use the English word \u2018existence\u2019\nin general in the broad sense of Bolzano\u2019s \u2018es\ngibt\u2019.)\n\nIt is not only for this terminological reason that Bolzano\u2019s\ncharacterization of the ontological status of propositions and ideas\nremains in the last analysis nebulous and has therefore repeatedly\nevoked criticism. One must of course add, for the sake of doing\njustice to Bolzano, that no other advocate of such a World 3 \u2014\nincluding Husserl, Popper and even Frege \u2014 has done better than\nhe had done and has succeeded in saying anything clearer about this\nthan what can already be found in Bolzano\u2019s work. Despite all\nthese deficiencies, Bolzano\u2019s unproven assumption or postulation\nof propositions and ideas turned out to be extremely fruitful for his\nown research.\n",
