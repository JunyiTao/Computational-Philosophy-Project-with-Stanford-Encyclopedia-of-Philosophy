    "main_text": "Generics and Logical Form || Deriving Generic vs. Existential Interpretations\n1.3 Deriving Generic vs. Existential Interpretations\n\nHow exactly might the distinction between stage level and individual\nlevel predicates give rise to existential vs. generic readings of bare\nplurals? The original proposal is due to Greg Carlson (1977), however\nCarlson himself later came to reject the basics of his account\n(Carlson 1989). More recent discussion can be found in Diesing (1992),\nChierchia (1995), Kratzer (1995), Cohen and Erteschik-Shir (1997,\n2002), Kiss (1998), and others.\n\nIn Carlson\u2019s original account, he proposed that stage level\npredicates are lexically represented with existential quantifiers.\nThese quantifiers range over realizations of individuals.\nCarlson\u2019s metaphysical outlook was as follows: the set of\nindividuals is composed of both objects (by which he meant regular,\neveryday concrete items) and kinds. Both objects and kinds have\nrealizations. A realization of an object is a temporal slice thereof.\nA realization of a kind is either an object that belongs to\nthe kind, or a temporal slice of such an object. Kinds are directly\ndenoted by bare plurals, on Carlson\u2019s view\u2014that is, bare\nplurals are singular referring terms, like names.\n\nConsider now the predicate \u201cis smoking\u201d. This is a stage\nlevel predicate; on Carlson\u2019s view only stages (temporal slices)\nof objects are ever smoking. Natural language, however, does not\nsupply temporal slices as objects of predication, but rather\nindividuals\u2014at least on the surface. To resolve this mismatch,\nthe predicate \u201cis smoking\u201d would have to be lexicalized\nas \n\\[ \\lambda x \\exists y(R(y,x) \\mathbin{\\&} \\textrm{smokes}(y)) \\]\n\n\n\u201cR\u201d here means \u201cis a realization of\u201d,\nin Carlson\u2019s sense. The predicate can be applied to an object,\nsuch as John, to yield: \n\\[ \\exists y(R(y, j) \\mathbin{\\&} \\textrm{smokes}(y)) \\]\n\n\nThus (setting aside tense), \u201cJohn is smoking\u201d is true iff\nsome realization (i.e., temporal stage) of John is engaged in smoking.\nThe predicate can also be applied to kinds, as in \u201cstudents are\nsmoking\u201d: \n\\[ \\exists y(R(y, s) \\mathbin{\\&} \\textrm{smokes}(y)) \\]\n\n\nHere \u201cs\u201d picks out the kind student, and\nthe sentence is true iff there are some realizations of the kind that\nare engaged in smoking. (Recall that the realizations of the kind\nstudent include both the particular individual\nstudents and the temporal stages of those individual\nstudents.) Thus we obtain the existential reading of the bare plural\nin virtue of the lexical representation of stage level predicates.\n\nIndividual level predicates hold of individuals, not stages, and so\nare directly predicated of their subjects. There is no inherent type\nmismatch here, and so individual level predicates are lexicalized\nwithout any such built-in quantifiers. As a first pass attempt at a\nsemantic formalization, Carlson took all individual level predicates\nto be directly applicable to kinds, so \u201cCats like Bob\u201d\nwould have as a logical form simply \u201c\\(\\textrm{Like}(c,\nb)\\)\u201d. Carlson went on to note that this approach meets with\ndifficulties when faced with sentences such as \u201cCats like\nthemselves\u201d. \u201c\\(\\textrm{Like}(c, c)\\)\u201d is does not\ncapture the appropriate truth conditions, since it corresponds only to\n\u201ccats like cats\u201d, and not to \u201ccats like\nthemselves\u201d.\n\nTo deal with this, he introduces a monadic predicate operator \\(G'\\)\nto take object-level predicates to kind-level predicates. \u201cCats\nlike themselves\u201d would be formalized as \u201c\\(G'(\\lambda x\n(\\textrm{Like}(x, x))(c)\\)\u201d, which is to be understood as true\niff the object level predicate \u201c\\(\\lambda x (\\textrm{Like}(x,\nx))\\)\u201d holds with sufficient regularity of the realizations of\nthe kind. Carlson took no stand on what this sufficient regularity\namounts to, other than to say that it is not the job of semantics to\ntell us when an item satisfies a predicate containing\n\u201c\\(G'\\)\u201d, anymore than it is the job of semantics to tell\nus when an item satisfies any predicate. Semantics tells us\nthat \u201cJohn is red\u201d is true iff John satisfies \u201cis\nred\u201d, which in turn holds iff John is red. Semantics does\nnot tell us whether John is red, nor how to go about\ndetermining whether John is red. Whether an item has a property is not\na question for semantics.\n\nCarlson later came to reject this account of the logical form of\ngenerics\u2014in particular, he came to reject the idea that there is\na one-place predicate operator such as \\(G'\\), and instead embraced\nthe idea that any generic operator should instead be two-place (1989).\nThis point is taken up below in the section on the logical form of\ncharacterizing generics. First, though, it is helpful to draw a\ndistinction between two different kinds of generics.\n",
