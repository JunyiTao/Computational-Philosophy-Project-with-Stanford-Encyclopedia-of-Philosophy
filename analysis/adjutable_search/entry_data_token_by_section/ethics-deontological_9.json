Doing\nthis holds out the promise of denying sense to the otherwise damning\nquestion, how could it be moral to make (or allow) the world to be\nworse (for they deny that there is any states-of-affairs\n\u201cworseness\u201d in terms of which to frame such a question)\n(Foot 1985). To make this plausible, one needs to expand the coverage\nof agent-relative reasons to cover what is now plausibly a matter of\nconsequentialist reasons, such as positive duties to strangers.\nMoreover, deontologists taking this route need a content to the\npermissive and obligating norms of deontology that allows them to\nmimic the outcomes making consequentialism attractive. This requires a\npicture of morality\u2019s norms that is extremely detailed in content, so\nthat what looks like a consequentialist balance can be generated by a\ncomplex series of norms with extremely detailed priority rules and\nexception clauses (Richardson 1990). Few consequentialists will\nbelieve that this is a viable enterprise.\n",
