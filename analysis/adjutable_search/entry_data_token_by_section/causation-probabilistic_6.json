    "main_text": "Motivation and Preliminaries || Further Reading\n1.6 Further Reading\n\nPsillos 2009 provides an overview of regularity theories of causation.\nLewis 1973 contains a brief but clear and forceful overview of\nproblems with regularity theories. The entry for\n scientific explanation\n contains discussions of some of these problems.\n\nH\u00e1jek and Hitchcock 2016b is a short introduction to probability\ntheory geared toward philosophical applications. Billingsley 1995 and\nFeller 1968 are two standard texts on probability theory. The entry\nfor\n interpretations of probability\n includes a brief introduction to the formalism of probability theory,\nand discusses the various interpretations of probability. Galavotti\n2005 and Gillies 2000 are good surveys of philosophical theories of\nprobability. H\u00e1jek and Hitchcock 2016a includes essays covering the\nmajor interpretations of probability. \n\nThe Introduction of Eells 1991 provides a good overview of the\ndistinction between general and actual causation.\n\nBennett 1988 is an excellent discussion of facts and events in the\ncontext of causation. Ehring 2009 is a survey of views about causal\nrelata. See also the entries for\n the metaphysics of causation,\n events,\n facts,\n and\n properties.\n",
