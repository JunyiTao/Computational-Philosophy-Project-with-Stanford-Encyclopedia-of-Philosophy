Objections to Functionalism\n\nThe previous sections were by and large devoted to the presentation of\nthe different varieties of functionalism and the evaluation of their\nrelative strengths and weaknesses. There have been many objections to\nfunctionalism, however, that apply to all versions of the theory. Some\nof these have already been introduced in earlier discussions, but\nthey, and many others, will be addressed in more detail here.\n",
