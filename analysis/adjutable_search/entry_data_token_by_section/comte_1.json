    "main_text": "Biography\n2. Biography\n\nComte was born in Montpellier on January 20, 1798 (\u2018le 1er\npluvi\u00f4se de l\u2019an VI\u2019, according to the Revolutionary\ncalendar then in use in France). Having displayed his brilliance in\nschool, he was ranked fourth on the admissions list of the\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris in 1814. Two years later, the\nBourbons closed that institution, and its students were dismissed. In\nAugust 1817, Auguste Comte met Henri de Saint-Simon, who appointed him\nas his secretary to replace Augustin Thierry. The young Comte was thus\ninitiated into politics and was able to publish a great number of\narticles, which placed him very much in the public eye. (The most\nimportant of these articles were republished by him in 1854 and remain\nthe best introduction to his oeuvre as a whole.) In April 1824, he\nbroke with Saint-Simon. Shortly afterward, in a civil wedding, he\nmarried Caroline Massin, who had been living with him for several\nmonths. In April 1826, Comte began teaching a Course of Positive\nPhilosophy, whose audience included some of the most famous\nscientists of the time (Fourier, A. von Humboldt, Poinsot). It was\nsuddenly interrupted because of a \u2018cerebral crisis\u2019 due to\noverwork and conjugal sorrows. Comte was then hospitalized in the\nclinic of Dr. Esquirol. Upon leaving, he was classified as \u2018not\ncured\u2019. He recovered gradually, thanks to the devotion and\npatience of his wife.\n\nThe resumption of the Course of Positive Philosophy in\nJanuary 1829, marks the beginning of a second period in Comte\u2019s\nlife that lasted 13 years and included the publication of the six\nvolumes of the Course (1830, 1835, 1838, 1839, 1841, 1842).\nIn addition, during this period, more and more of his ties with the\nacademic world were severed. After being named tutor in analysis and\nmechanics at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1832, in 1833 he sought\nto create a chair in general history of science at the Coll\u00e8ge\nde France, but to no avail. Two unsuccessful candidacies for the rank\nof professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique led him in 1842 to\npublish a \u2018personal preface\u2019 to the last volume of the\nCourse, which put him at odds with the university world\nforever. The two years that followed mark a period of transition. In\nquick succession, Comte published an Elementary Treatise on\nAnalytic Geometry (1843), his only mathematical work, and the\nPhilosophical Treatise on Popular Astronomy (1844), the fruit\nof a yearly course, begun in 1830, for Parisian workers. The\nDiscourse on the Positive Spirit, also from 1844, which he\nused as the preface to the treatise on astronomy, marked a sharp\nchange of direction by its emphasis on the moral dimension of the new\nphilosophy: now that the sciences had been systematized, Comte was\nable to return to his initial interest, political philosophy. Public\nrecognition of the positivist Comte, as opposed to the saint-simonian,\ntwenty years earlier, came with \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9\u2019s\narticles in Le National.\n\nThe year 1844 also marked his first encounter with Clotilde de Vaux.\nWhat followed was the \u2018year like none other\u2019 that launched\nwhat Comte himself called his \u2018second career\u2019. The main\ntheme of the second career was the \u2018continuous dominance of the\nheart\u2019. An abundant correspondence testifies to Comte\u2019s\npassion, who, in spite of a heavy teaching load, found the time to\nstart working on the System of Positive Polity, which he had\nannounced at the end of the Course. After Clotilde\u2019s\ndeath, in April 1846, Comte began to idolize her, to such an extent\nthat it became a true cult. A few months later, his correspondence\nwith Mill, begun in December 1841, came to an end. The next year,\nComte chose the evolution of Humanity as the new topic for his public\ncourse; this was an occasion to lay down the premises of what would\nbecome the new Religion of Humanity. He was an enthusiastic supporter\nof the revolution of 1848: he founded the Positivist Society, modelled\nafter the Club of the Jacobins, and published the General View of\nPositivism, conceived of as an introduction to the\nSystem to come, as well as the Positivist Calendar.\nIn 1849, he founded the Religion of Humanity.\n\nThe years 1851\u20131854 were dominated by the publication of the\nfour-volume System of Positive Polity, which was interrupted\nfor a few months in order for him to write the Catechism of\nPositive Religion (1852). Relieved of all his duties at the\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique, Comte now lived off of the\n\u2018voluntary subsidy\u2019 begun by the followers of his in\nEngland and now also granted to him from various countries. In\nDecember 1851, Comte applauded the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by\nNapoleon III, who put an end to the parliamentary\n\u2018anarchy\u2019. Littr\u00e9 refused to follow Comte on this\npoint, as on the question of religion, and broke with him shortly\nafter. Soon disappointed by the Second Empire, Comte shifted his hopes\nto Czar Nicholas I, to whom he wrote. In 1853, Harriet Martineau\npublished a condensed English translation of the Course of\nPositive Philosophy.\n\nDisappointed by the unenthusiastic response his work got from the\nworkers, Comte launched an Appeal to Conservatives in 1855.\nThe next year, he published the first volume of a work on the\nphilosophy of mathematics announced in 1842, under the new title of\nSubjective Synthesis, or Universal System of the Conceptions\nAdapted to the Normal State of Humanity. Increasingly occupied by\nhis function as High Priest of Humanity, he sent an emissary to the\nJesuits in Rome proposing an alliance with the\n\u2018Ignacians\u2019.\n\nComte died on September 5, 1857, without having had time to draft the\ntexts announced up to 35 years before: a Treatise of Universal\nEducation, which he thought he could publish in 1858, a\nSystem of Positive Industry, or Treatise on the Total Action of\nHumanity on the Planet, planned for 1861, and, finally, for 1867,\na Treatise of First Philosophy. He is buried in the\nP\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery, where his Brazilian followers erected a\nstatue of Humanity in 1983.\n",
