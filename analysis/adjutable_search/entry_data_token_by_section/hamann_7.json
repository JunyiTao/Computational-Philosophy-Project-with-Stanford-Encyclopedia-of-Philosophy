    "main_text": "Language\n8. Language\n\nLanguage is one of Hamann\u2019s most abiding philosophical concerns.\nFrom the beginning of his work, Hamann championed the priority which\nexpression and communication, passion and symbol possess over\nabstraction, analysis and logic in matters of language. Neither logic\nnor even representation (in Rorty\u2019s sense) possesses the rights\nof the first-born. Representation is secondary and derivative rather\nthan the whole function of language. Symbolism, imagery, metaphor have\nprimacy; \u201cPoetry is the mother-tongue of the human race\u201d\n(N II, 197). To think that language is essentially a passive system of\nsigns for communicating thoughts is to deal a deathblow to true\nlanguage.\n\nFor all Hamann\u2019s emphasis in his earlier writings on passion and\nemotion, he does not equate language with emotional expression. This\nbecame clear in his engagement with the writing of his younger friend\nHerder on the origin of language. Language has a mediating\nrelationship between our reflection, one another, and our world; and\nas it is not simply the cries of emotion of an animal, so too it is\nnot a smothering curtain between us and the rest of reality. Language\nalso has a mediating role between God and us. Hamann\u2019s answer to\na debate of his time, the origin of language \u2014 divine or\nhuman?\u2014is that its origin is found in the relationship between\nGod and humanity. Typically he has the \u2018Knight of the\nRose-Cross\u2019 express this in the form of a \u2018myth\u2019,\nrather than attempting to work out such a claim logically and\nsystematically. Rewriting the story of the Garden of Eden, he\ndescribes this paradise as:\n\nEvery phenomenon of nature was a word,\u2014the sign, symbol and\npledge of a new, mysterious, inexpressible but all the more intimate\nunion, participation and community of divine energies and ideas.\nEverything the human being heard from the beginning, saw with its\neyes, looked upon and touched with its hands was a living word; for\nGod was the word. (NIII, 32: 21\u201330)\n\n\nThis makes the origin of language as easy and natural as child\u2019s\nplay.\n\nBy the end of his life, because of his engagement with Kant, the most\nurgent question among the relationships that constitute language is\nthe relationship of language to thinking or \u2018reason\u2019. In\nhis view, the central question of Kant\u2019s first\nCritique, the very possibility of a priori knowledge\nand of pure reason, depends on the nature of language. In a passage\nfull of subtle allusions to Kantian passages and terms, he writes:\n\nIndeed, if a chief question does remain: how is the power to think\npossible?\u2014The power to think right and left,\nbefore and without, with and above experience?\nthen it does not take a deduction to prove the genealogical priority\nof language\u2026. Not only the entire ability to think rests on\nlanguage... but language is also the crux of the misunderstanding\nof reason with itself. (N III, 286:1\u201310)\n\n\nLanguage is forced to take part in the \u2018purification of\nphilosophy\u2019, as he describes it in his Metacritique of Kant: the\nattempt to expunge experience and tradition from rational reflection.\nLanguage itself is the final victim in this threefold\n\u2018purification\u2019. It is for this reason however that\nlanguage can constitute the cure for philosophy. Language is the\nembodiment of experience and tradition; as long as the ability to\nthink rests on language, neither \u2018reason\u2019 nor\n\u2018philosophy\u2019 can be pure of the empirical, of experience,\nand of the experience of the others to whom we relate. It itself, for\nHamann, embodies a relation: it itself is a \u2018union of\nopposites\u2019, of the aesthetic and the logical, the bodily and the\nintellectual; it unites the divisions Kant\u2019s Critique\ncreates.\n\nFor Hamann, in contrast to Kant, the question is therefore not so much\n\u2018what is reason?\u2019 as \u2018what is language?\u2019, as\nhe writes in a letter. This is the ground of the paralogisms and\nantinomies that Kant raises in his Critique. Sharing Hume\u2019s\nempiricism and Berkeley\u2019s suspicion of universals and abstract\nterms, he concludes: \u201cHence it happens that one takes\nwords for concepts, and concepts for the\nthings themselves\u201d (ZH 5, 264:34\u2013265:1). Language\nthen has a fundamental role to play in unmasking the\nphilosopher\u2019s tendency to \u2018prosopopoeia\u2019. The\nrelation of language to reason he certainly did not feel had solved,\nhowever, as he wrote to a friend:\n\nIf only I was as eloquent as Demosthenes, I would have to do no more\nthan repeat a single word three times. Reason is language\u2014Logos;\nI gnaw on this marrowbone and will gnaw myself to death over it. It is\nstill always dark over these depths for me: I am still always awaiting\nan apocalyptic angel with a key to this abyss. (ZH 5, 177:16\u201321)\n\n",
