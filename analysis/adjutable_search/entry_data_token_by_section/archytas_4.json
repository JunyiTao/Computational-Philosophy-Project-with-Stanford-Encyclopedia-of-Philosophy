    "main_text": "Life and Works || The Authenticity Question\n1.5 The Authenticity Question\n\nMore pages of text have been preserved in Archytas\u2019 name than in\nthe name of any other Pythagorean. Unfortunately the vast majority of\nthis material is rightly regarded as spurious. The same is true of the\nPythagorean tradition in general; the vast majority of texts which\npurport to be by early Pythagoreans are, in fact, later forgeries.\nSome of these forgeries were produced for purely monetary reasons; a\ntext of a \u201crare\u201d work by a famous Pythagorean could fetch\na considerable sum from book collectors. There were characteristics\nunique to the Pythagorean tradition, however, that led to a\nproliferation of forgeries. Starting as early as the later fourth\ncentury BC, Pythagoras came to be regarded, in some circles, as the\nphilosopher par excellence, to whom all truth had been revealed. All\nlater philosophy, insofar as it was true, was a restatement of this\noriginal revelation (see, e.g., O\u2019Meara 1989). In order to\nsupport this view of Pythagoras, texts were forged in the name of\nPythagoras and other early Pythagoreans, to show that they had, in\nfact, anticipated the most important ideas of Plato and Aristotle.\nThese pseudo-Pythagorean texts are thus characterized by the use of\ncentral Platonic and Aristotelian ideas, expressed in the technical\nterminology used by Plato and Aristotle. Some of the forgeries even\nattempt to improve on Plato and Aristotle by adding refinements to\ntheir positions, which were first advanced several hundred years after\ntheir deaths. The date and place of origin of these pseudo-Pythagorean\ntreatises is difficult to determine, but most seem to have been\ncomposed between 150 BC and 100 AD (Burkert 1972b; Centrone 1990;\nMoraux 1984); Rome (Burkert 1972b) and Alexandria (Centrone 1990) are\nthe most likely places of origin. Archytas is the dominant figure in\nthis pseudo-Pythagorean tradition, probably because of his connection\nto Plato (Zhmud 2019). In Thesleff 1965\u2019s collection of the\npseudo-Pythagorean writings, forty-five of the two-hundred and\nforty-five pages (2-48), about 20%, comprising some 1,200 lines, are\ndevoted to texts forged in Archytas\u2019 name. On the other hand,\nthe fragments likely to be genuine, which are collected in DK, fill\nout only a hundred lines of text. Thus, over ten times more spurious\nthan genuine material has been preserved in Archytas\u2019 name. It\nmay well be that the style and Doric dialect of the pseudo-Pythagorean\nwritings were also based on the model of Archytas\u2019 genuine\nwritings.\n",
