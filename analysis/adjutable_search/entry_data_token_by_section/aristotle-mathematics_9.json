    "main_text": "Aristotle's Treatment of Mathematical Objects || X Qua (h\u00eai) Y\n7.4 X Qua (h\u00eai) Y\n\n\nThe word Aristotle uses is commonly translated with the English word\n\u2018qua\u2019 which itself translates the Latin relative\npronoun \u2018qua\u2019, but with one important grammatical\ndifference. The English adverb is normally followed by a noun\nphrase.\n\n\nAs a relative adverbial pronoun in the dative case, the Greek word\ncaptures all possible meanings of the dative, including,\n\u2018where\u2019, \u2018in the manner that\u2019,\n\u2018by-means-of-the-fact-that\u2019, or\n\u2018in-the-respect-that\u2019. Some have suggested translating it\nwith the word \u2018because\u2019, although it is arguable that the\nEnglish word at best intersects with the appropriate Greek meaning\n(perhaps \u2018just or precisely because\u2019 works better. Hence,\n\u2018X qua Y\u2019 should be understood\nas elliptic for:\n\u2018X in the respect that X is\nY\u2019\n\n\nor \n\u2018X by means of the fact that X is\nY\u2019 (or \u2018X precisely because X is\nY\u2019).\n\n\nHere \u2018X\u2019 is normally a noun phrase referring to\nan entity in any ordinary way, e.g., arithmetic studies Leopold\nqua unit, this man qua unit, this musician\nqua unit.\n\n\nIn the context of a scientific claim, \u2018X\nby-means-of-the-fact-that or in-the-respect-that X is\nY is F\u2019 maintains that \u2018Y is\nF\u2019 is a theorem, where Y is the most universal\nor appropriate subject for F, and that X is\nF in virtue of the fact that X is Y. For\nexample, Figure ABC qua triangle has internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles, but qua right triangle has sides\nAB2 + BC2 = AB2.\n\n\n\nIn the case where we examine or study an object X\nqua Y or X in-the-respect-that X is\nY, we study the consequences that follow from something's\nbeing an Y. In other words, Y determines the logical\nspace of what we study. If X is a bronze triangle (a\nperceptible magnitude), to study X qua bronze will be\nto examine bronze and the properties that accrue to something that is\nbronze. To study X qua triangle is to study the\nproperties that accrue to a triangle. Unless it follows from\nsomething's being a triangle that it must be bronze, the property of\nbeing bronze will not appear in one's examination.\n\n\nNote that there is no necessity that \u2018qua\u2019\noperators be of the form \u2018qua Y\u2019, where\nY is a noun phrase. For example, Aristotle says (De\nanima iii.4.429b25-6) that two things affect and are affected\n\u201cqua something in common belongs to both.\u201d\nSimilarly, as evidence that \u2018qua\u2019 does not in\nthese contexts always mean \u2018because\u2019 (usually, the context\nis too ambiguous to precisely decide whether it means\n\u2018because\u2019 or \u2018in the respect that\u2019), consider\nNicomachean Ethics i.3.1102b8-9, \u201cSleep is an inactivity\nof the soul qua it is called good or bad,\u201d but certainly\nnot because it is.\n\n\nWith only one or two possible exceptions, it seems that whenever\nAristotle speaks of F(X) qua\nG(X), G(X) must be true. We can\nstudy a perceptible triangle qua triangle because it is a\ntriangle. For convenience, we can call this principle\nqua-realism.\n\nThe Account of Mathematical Objects with\n\u2018Qua\u2019. We begin with perceptible\nmagnitudes. These are volumes, surfaces, edges, and corners. They\nchange in position and size. They are made of some material and are the\nquantities of substances and their interactions. The volumes, surfaces,\nand edges have shape. Times and corners do not. Different sciences\ntreat different perceptible magnitudes qua different\nthings.\n\n\nMoreover, since there are many perceptible magnitudes, there will be\nenough, qua line, to prove any theorem that involves lines.\nThe plurality problem is trivially solved.\n\n\nThe separability problem is solved because if we examine X\nqua Y, we will talk about Y as if it is a\nseparate entity, as a subject, and will pay no attention to the way in\nwhich we captured Y through a description\n\u2018X\u2019, in the sense that only the residue of the\nqua-filter are studied. The science will speak of Y.\nThis too will not interfere with mathematical practice and so will not\nviolate non-revisionism.\n\n\nIn Metaphysics vi.1, Aristotle argues that physics concerns\nthings which have change, but are substances, that at least some of the\nthings that mathematics is about do not change and are eternal but are\nnot substances (exceptions would probably include stars and spheres in\nmathematical astronomy and bodies in mathematical kinematics), while\nfirst philosophy or theology is about things which are substances but\ndo not change and are eternal. We can now characterize the way in which\nmathematical objects are eternal and lack change. Namely, generation\nand change are not among the predicates studied by geometry or\narithmetic. Hence, it is correct to say that qua lines,\nperceptible lines lack generation, destruction, and change (with\nappropriate provisos for kinematics and mathematical astronomy).\n\n\nWhether the precision problem is also solved and how it is solved is\nmore controversial. On the ancient and medieval interpretation, the\nproblem of precision is solved by allowing mental representations to be\nas precise as one chooses. The contemporary interpretation of\nconsidering Aristotle's mathematical objects as physical object treated\nin a special way has a more difficult task. There are five ways in\nwhich Aristotle may attempt to solve the precision problem.\n\nMany scholars today seem to hold to a view that for Aristotle if\none can speak of X qua Y, then X\nmust be Y precisely. This means that any theorem about\ntriangles will only hold of the rare perfect triangles, wherever they\nmay be (a thesis once suggested by Descartes).\nTo increase the number of instances of exact triangles in the\nontology, some scholars turn to Met. xiii.3, where Aristotle\nnotes that being is said in two ways, the one in actuality and the\nother materially, he may be pointing to the fact that mathematical\nentities exist in continua as potentialities. Hence, a perfect line\nexists potentially in the sand, even if the one I have drawn is\nnot. (Some have also seen support for this in Met. ix.9.)\nHence, although there may be no actual triangles right now, at least\nthere are an infinity of potential ones. The difficulty is that the\nargument is not about precision. It concerns an objection to Aristotle\nthat man\nqua man is indivisible, but geometry studies man qua\ndivisible. Since man is not divisible, the principle of\nqua-realism, that if one can study X qua\nY then X is Y, is violated. Aristotle says\nthat man is in actuality indivisible (you cannot slice a man in two and\nstill have man or men), but is materially divisible. It is enough that\nX is Y materially or in actuality to study X\nqua Y. Nonetheless, the solution to the puzzle could\npoint to an Aristotelian solution to the problem of precision.\nAlternatively, it is arguable that Aristotle allows that\n\u2018X is Y\u2019 may be true only imprecisely.\nFor example, I may study a triangle in a diagram ABC\nqua triangle, but ABC is only a triangle imprecisely.\nMany Hellenistic treatises involving applied sciences set up convenient\nbut false premises for the purposes of mathematical manipulation,\nincluding, notably, Aristotle's own account of the rainbow (Meteorology\niii.5). Hence, an appeal to potentialities to get more exact triangles\nwill do nothing to eliminate these apparent violations of\nqua-realism.\nIn providing his hierarchy of precision in sciences, Aristotle may\nthink that from filtering out more properties one gets greater\nprecision. One finds more precise straight lines in geometry than in\nkinematics. Besides the obscurity of the position, it is not clear that\nhe intends any such thing (see Section 7.2 above).\nOne possibility is that Aristotle thinks that if a description has\nmore properties removed from consideration, the entity studied is more\nprecise in that there will be instances materially or actually that\nexactly exhibit satisfy qua-realism. For example, there are\nprecise instances of units or of corners or points so that arithmetic\nand geometry are precise, while astronomy might not be so precise,\nsince the planets are imprecisely points, but are studied qua\npoints.\n\n\n\nOur difficulty is that while Aristotle raises the problem of\nprecision, he does not explicitly explain his solution to it.\n",
