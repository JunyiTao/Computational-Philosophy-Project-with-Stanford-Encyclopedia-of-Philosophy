    "main_text": "Foundational Theories of Meaning\n3. Foundational Theories of Meaning\n\nWe now turn to our second sort of \u201ctheory of meaning\u201d:\nfoundational theories of meaning, which are attempts to specify the\nfacts in virtue of which expressions of natural languages come to have\nthe semantic properties that they have.\n\nThe question which foundational theories of meaning try to answer is a\ncommon sort of question in philosophy. In the philosophy of\n action (see entry)\n we ask what the facts are in virtue of which a given piece of\nbehavior is an intentional action; in questions about\n personal identity (see entry)\n we ask what the facts are in virtue of which x and y\nare the same person; in ethics we ask what the facts are in virtue of\nwhich a given action is morally right or wrong. But, even if they are\ncommon enough, it is not obvious what the constraints are on answers\nto these sorts of questions, or when we should expect questions of\nthis sort to have interesting answers.\n\nAccordingly, one sort of approach to foundational theories of meaning\nis simply to deny that there is any true foundational theory of\nmeaning. One might be quite willing to endorse one of the semantic\ntheories outlined above while also holding that facts about the\nmeanings of expressions are primitive, in the sense that there is no\nsystematic story to be told about the facts in virtue of which\nexpressions have the meanings that they have. (See, for example,\nJohnston 1988.)\n\nThere is another reason why one might be pessimistic about the\nprospects of foundational theories of meaning. While plainly distinct\nfrom semantics, the attempt to provide foundational theories is\nclearly in one sense answerable to semantic theorizing, since without\na clear view of the facts about the semantic contents of expressions\nwe won't have a clear view of the facts for which we are trying to\nprovide an explanation. One might, then, be skeptical about the\nprospects of foundational theories of meaning not because of a general\nprimitivist view of semantic facts, but just because one holds that\nnatural language semantics is not yet advanced enough for us to have a\nclear grip on the semantic facts which foundational theories of\nmeaning aim to analyze. (See for discussion Yalcin (2014).)\n\nMany philosophers have, however, attempted to provide foundational\ntheories of meaning. This section sets aside pessimism about\nthe prospects for such theories and lays out the main attempts to give\na systematic account of the facts about language users in virtue of\nwhich their words have the semantic properties that they do. It is\nuseful to separate these theories into two camps.\n\nAccording to the first sort of view, linguistic expressions inherit\ntheir contents from some other sort of bearer of content. So, for\nexample, one might say that linguistic expressions inherit their\ncontents from the contents of certain mental states with which they\nare associated. I\u2019ll call views of this type mentalist\ntheories. Mentalist theories are discussed in\n \u00a73.1,\n and non-mentalist theories in\n \u00a73.2.\n",
