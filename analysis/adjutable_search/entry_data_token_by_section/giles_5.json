    "main_text": "Between Philosophy and Medicine\n6. Ethics and Political Theory\n\n\nIn the debate on the respective roles of intellect and will in the\ndetermination of human action Giles\u2019 position underwent an evolution,\nwhile he seems to be in search of an intermediate position, a sort of\ncompromise between the theory of Henry of Ghent and that of Geoffrey\nof Fontaines. Giles maintains, in fact, that will is a passive potency\nand can not \u201cmove\u201d itself, but always needs an object, a\n\u201cbonum apprehensum\u201d. This starting point however, does not\nrule out its freedom, because will, even if is moved\n\u201cmoved\u201d by its object, can determine itself and other\npotencies with regard to action. This view of Giles\u2019 is consistent\nwith his mature interpretation of the relationship existing between\nknowledge and will in the sinner. Committing a sin implies an\nignorance of the real good, but this ignorance is not the primary\ncause of the wrong behavior, because it is an effect of the will,\nwhich, affected by malicia, corrupts the judgment of the\nreason (Macken 1977, Eardley 2003, Pini 2006, Eardley 2016, but see\nalso Cross 2016).\n\n\nGiles of Rome exerted considerable influence also in other fields of\nethics, such as the theory of virtues. The most developed expression of\nhis position is not to be found in a Commentary on Aristotle, but\nrather in his De regimine principum, the most successful\n\u201cmirror of princes\u201d of medieval political thought, which is\nstill conserved in more than 300 manuscripts in its original Latin\nversion, to which many translations in European vernaculars must be\nadded. Written most probably between 1277 and 1280 the De\nregimine is acknowledged to be one of the most successful attempts\nat mediating Aristotle\u2019s practical philosophy, and in particular his\n\u201cethical and political language\u201d to the Latin West. Giles\nwas the first to structure a mirror of princes in three books along the\nlines of a scheme \u2014 ethica-oeconomica-politica \u2014 which\nplayed an important role in the reception of Aristotle\u2019s moral and\npolitical philosophy in the Middle Ages (Lambertini 1988). The author\ntakes great care to give the impression that he is mainly relying on\nAristotle\u2019s text, providing numerous quotations from the\nNichomachean Ethics, from the Politics and from the\nRethoric. Scholars should not overlook, however, that his\nreception of Aristotle is not as direct as it can seem and that Giles\nis deeply influenced by a tradition in the interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s practical philosophy. In this tradition Aquinas plays a\nvery important role for Giles, so that, while Aristotle is the\nauthority who is quoted on almost every occasion, it is the unnamed\nAquinas who, with his Sententia libri Politicorum, De\nregno, Summa Theologiae, exerts a really decisive\ninfluence on De regimine. While discussing particular topics,\nGiles skillfully adapts Aristotle to his own purposes. This emerges\nwith clarity in the first book, devoted to ethics, where Giles\u2019\nclassification of virtues is heavily dependent on the Summa\nTheologiae and, therefore, on Aquinas\u2019 reinterpretation of the\nAristotelian heritage. For example, Giles here defines\nprudentia as a virtus media, sharing the nature of\nmoral as well as of intellectual ones, a doctrine which can by no\nmeans be traced back to the Stagirite (Lambertini 1991, 1992, 1995,\n2000). In the second book Giles deals with the ethics of man as head\nof the family, covering many topics, from children rearing and\neducation to the rule over servants. To this purpose, he exploits a\nwide range of sources, and also medicine authors (Lambertini 1988,\nMartorelli Vico 2008). As Giles wrote his De regimine, the\npseudo-Aristotelian Oeconomica were not yet available in\ntraslation to the Latin West; still, he managed to discuss also\neconomic topics, as far as they are relevant for the household of a\nroyal family or for a high-class household in general. Here he condemns\nusury, criticizes other economic practices as not suitable for a\nprince, and insists on the primary role agricolture should play\n(Lambertini 2015) \n\n\nThe most famous example of this selective attitude towards\nAristotle\u2019s works, however, belongs rather to the field of political\ntheory. In the third book of De regimine Giles wants to prove\nthat monarchy is the absolutely best form of government. The first\narguments he puts forward in favor of monarchy are not taken from\nAristotle\u2019s Politics, but from Aquinas\u2019 De regno.\nThen some arguments against monarchy which could be read in the\nPolitics are presented as objections that Aristotle puts forth\nfor subsequent refutation. At the end, Giles states squarely that\nAristotle supports monarchy as the absolutely best form of monarchy and\ncorroborates his assertion with an argument, which, in the\nPolitics, actually goes in the opposite direction (Lambertini\n1990). One could provide several other examples to show that\nthe De regimine succeeded in presenting itself as a\nsimplified exposition and explanation of Aristotle\u2019s thought in\npractical philosophy, but at the same time transmitted to Giles\u2019\nreaders a strongly biased interpretation of the Stagirite. The fact\nthat the De regimine was often used as a tool to have easier\naccess to Aristotle\u2019s political theory deeply influenced, therefore,\nthe way the Latin West read and understood\nAristotle\u2019s Politics in the Late Middle Ages (e.g. Lambertini\n2017).  Recent codicological studies on the diffusion of De\nregimine\u2019 manuscripts do in fact show that many possessors\nof the manuscripts most probably used them for study (See Opera\nOmnia I.1/11, Catalogo dei manoscritti, De regimine;\nBriggs 1999). Giles\u2019 De regimine was also translated into\ndifferent vernaculars (Perret 2011, Papi 2016).  Graham McAleer (1999)\npointed to the fact that Giles\u2019 Commentary on the Sentences has been\nalmost neglected as a source for Giles\u2019 political philosophy. Studying\ndistinction 22 and 44 of the II book, he found that in these texts\nGiles\u2019 account of the origin of political authority among human beings\nafter the Fall diverges from what one can read in De regimine\nprincipum and reveals a profound influence by Augustine, while\nAristotle does not play the important role he had in Giles\u2019 mirror for\nprinces. One should also take into consideration that\nGiles\u2019 Ordinatio of the second book was completed in 1309,\nthat is at least 25 years after De regimine and could witness\nto an evolution in Giles\u2019 thought. As a matter of fact, the much\nearlier reportatio does not tackle such issues at all\n(Lambertini 2014).\n\n\nWhile in the De regimine Giles carefully avoids any\nreference to the thorny problem of the relationship between secular and\necclesiastical power, his later writings which are relevant for\npolitical theory deal first and foremost with ecclesiological problems.\nThis holds true for his treatise De renuntiatione papae\n(1297\u20131298) where Giles defends the lawfulness of Celestine\u2019s\nabdication against the arguments put forward by the Colonna cardinals\nin their first appeal against Boniface VIII. From the point of view of\nthe history of political thought it is relevant that Giles argues that\npapal power, although of divine origin, is conferred on a particular\nindividual by a human act, namely, by the election of the cardinals.\nHere Giles is countering the Colonna arguments that papal dignity\ncannot cease to reside in a pope until he dies, because the pontificate\ndepends on God\u2019s will, and stresses the fact that divine intention in\nthis case becomes effective through the mediation of human agents, that\nis, through the consent of the electors and of the elected. A\njurisdiction which is given by the consent of men, however, can also be\nremoved by their consent through a reverse procedure. This does not\namount to saying that the pope can be deposed (except in case of\nheresy), because, according to Giles, the pope is above the law and has\nno earthly authority above him. He can however, depose himself, that\nis, abdicate. Just as for his election the consent of his electors and\nof the elected was necessary, so also for the removal of the pope from\noffice his consent is decisive (Eastman 1989, 1990, 1992). In this way\nGiles could dismiss arguments against the validity of Celestine\u2019s\nabdication without admitting the possibility that the pope can be\ndeposed, e. g., by the Council, as Boniface\u2019s adversaries\nmaintained.\n\n\nMuch better known than De renuntiatione is Giles\u2019 De\necclesiastica potestate, a treatise also composed in defense of\nBoniface VIII. Most probably in 1302, Giles systematically expounded in\nthis work the views on the relationship between regnum and\nsacerdotium he had already put forward in a re-discovered\nsermon held at the papal curia (Luna 1992, Lambertini 2006). The main\ntenet of his fully fledged argumentation is that the pope, supreme\nauthority of the Church but also of the whole of mankind, is the only\nlegitimate origin of every power on earth, be it exercised \u2014 as\njurisdiction \u2014 on persons, or \u2014 as property \u2014 on\nthings. In his plenitude of power, the pope possesses an absolute\nsupremacy both in the ecclesiastical and in the temporal sphere, and\ndelegates the exercise of the temporal \u201csword\u201d to lay\nsovereigns only in order to fulfill most properly his higher religious\nduties. Any authority that does not recognize its dependence on the\npapal power is but usurpation. In Giles\u2019 view, there is no space even\nfor a partially autonomous temporal order. Coherently, Giles maintains\nthat no property rights are valid if they are not legitimated by papal\nauthority.  Interestingly enough, such a claim is also supported by\nhis account of the origin of property, according to which property is\nnot a natural institution, but only the consequence of human\nagreements, which lack any legitimacy unless they are recognized by\nthe supreme religious power (Miethke 2000, Homann 2004, Kr\u00fcger\n2007). Scholarly discussion about De ecclesiastica potestate\nis still open. Karl Ubl (2004) argues with strong arguments against\nprevious assumptions, that Giles wrote in reaction to John of\nParis\u2019 De regia potestate et papali. While previous\nscholarship stressed the affinity in form and content between De\necclesiastica potestate and the famous Bull Unam\nsanctam, Francisco Bertelloni (2004) holds that one should not\noverlook profound differences between the concepts of papal power that\ninspire the two texts.\n",
