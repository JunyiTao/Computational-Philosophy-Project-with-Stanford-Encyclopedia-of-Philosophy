    "main_text": "Theory and Theoretical Virtues\n2. Theory and Theoretical Virtues\n\n\nThere is agreement that theories play some kind\nof systematizing role, and that one function is to examine\nimportant concepts relevant to morality and moral practice and the\nconnections, if any, between them. For example, one very common view\nin the middle of the 20th century, attributed to John\nRawls, was to view moral theory as primarily interested in\nunderstanding the \u2018right\u2019 and the \u2018good\u2019 and\nconnections between the two (Rawls). Priority claims are often a\ncentral feature in the systematizing role of moral theory. Related to\nthis is the issue of explanatory, or theoretical, depth. That\nis, the deeper the explanation goes, the better.\n\nTheories also strive for simplicity, coherence,\nand accuracy. The fewer epicycles the theory has to postulate\nthe better, the parts of the theory should fit well together. For\nexample, the theory should not contain inconsistent principles, or have\ninconsistent implications. The theory should cover the phenomena\nin question. In the case of moral theories, the phenomena in\nquestion are thought to be our considered moral intuitions or\njudgements. Another coherence condition involves the theory cohering\nwith a person\u2019s set of considered judgments, as well.\n\nOne last feature that needs stressing, particularly for moral\ntheories, is applicability. One criticism of some normative\nethical theories is that they are not applicable. For example,\nVirtue Ethics has been criticized for not providing an account of what\nour moral obligations are \u2013 appealing to what the\nvirtuous person would do in the circumstances would seem to set a very\nhigh bar or doesn\u2019t answer the relevant question about how we\nshould structure laws guiding people on what their social obligations\nare. Similarly, objective consequentialists, who understand\n\u201cright action\u201d in terms of actual consequences have been\ncriticized for rendering what counts as a right action in a given\ncircumstance unknowable, and thus useless as a guide to action. \nBoth approaches provide responses to this worry, but this supports the\nclaim that a desideratum of a moral theory is that it be\napplicable.\n",
