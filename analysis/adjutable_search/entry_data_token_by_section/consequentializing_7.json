    "main_text": "Objections to Consequentializing || There Is Nothing Uniquely Compelling about Act-Consequentialism\n4.1 There Is Nothing Uniquely Compelling about Act-Consequentialism\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, even those who refuse to accept utilitarianism\nfind that there is, nonetheless, something quite compelling about it:\nits act-consequentialism. But what\u2019s so compelling about\nact-consequentialism? Let\u2019s call whatever it is \u201cthe\nCompelling Idea\u201d. For earnest consequentializing to succeed,\nthis so-called Compelling Idea must be both genuinely compelling and\nsomething that all and only act-consequentialist theories share. Both\nclaims have been denied. So, let\u2019s look at various proposals for\nthe Compelling Idea and see if any of them are both genuinely\ncompelling and unique to act-consequentialism.\n\nOne proposal is as follows.\n\nBest Option: It is always morally permissible for you to\nperform your morally best option\u2014that is, the best option in\nterms of whatever morally matters (Hurley 2017).\n\nAlthough this seems to be a genuinely compelling idea (but see\nPortmore 2019 for some doubts), it is not at all unique to\nact-consequentialism. For, arguably, most, if not all, moral theories\nendorse it (Hurley 2017: 40). So, the earnest consequentializer must\nlook elsewhere. Perhaps, then, the Compelling Idea concerns the best\noutcome as opposed to the best option.\n\nBest Outcome: It is always morally permissible for you to\nperform the option that would bring about the best outcome (Scheffler\n1982 [1994]; Ewing 1948: 188).\n\nUnlike\n Best Option,\n this idea is undoubtedly unique to act-consequentialism, but some\nargue that it isn\u2019t compelling\u2014or, at least, not\nuncontroversially so (see Hurley 2017). After all, many find it\nintuitive to think that certain types of acts (e.g., breaking a\npromise) are wrong even if they bring about the best outcome. For\ninstance, deontologists believe that there are agent-centered\nrestrictions that prohibit you from performing certain act-types even\nin some situations in which your performing an instance of one of\nthese act-types would prevent two or more others from each performing\na morally comparable instance of this act-type (see Scheffler 1985:\n409). So, as we saw above, even if there\u2019s something\nintrinsically bad about acts of this type, the outcome in which you\nperform an instance of this act-type would, other things being equal,\nhave to be better than the outcome in which two or more others each\nperform a morally comparable instance of this act-type. So, if the\nCompelling Idea is to be genuinely compelling even to those who\nendorse agent-centered restrictions, it better not appeal to\nthe best outcome. For the best outcome is the\noutcome with the most good, the good being what\u2019s desirable from\na universal point of view rather than what\u2019s desirable from the\nagent\u2019s point of view. And this has led some earnest\nconsequentializers to appeal instead to the following.\n\nBest-Relative-to: It is always morally permissible for you to\nperform the option that would bring about the outcome that\u2019s\nbest-relative-to you (Sen 1983; Smith 2003).\n\nThe problem with this proposal is that the better-relative-to relation\nseems to be a purely theoretical notion. In which case, it would be\nimpossible for us to have any pre-theoretical grasp on claims\ninvolving it, such as\n Best-Relative-to\n (M. Schroeder 2007). And if that\u2019s right, then\nBest-Relative-to cannot be something that we find\ncompelling\u2014at least, not pre-theoretically. Of course, some\nbelieve that we can avoid this worry by defending, via a certain\nconception of the good, the idea that what\u2019s best-relative-to\nsomeone is just what that someone has most reason to desire (see,\ne.g., Smith 2003). Others, though, have sought to avoid the\ncontroversy by instead appealing to the following.\n\nMost Reason to Desire: It is always morally permissible for\nyou to perform the option that would bring about the outcome that you\nhave most reason to desire\u2014or, in other words, the outcome that\nyou ought, or that it is fitting for you, to prefer to every available\nalternative (Portmore 2007).\n\nOne advantage of this proposal is that it explains why utilitarianism\nand ethical egoism\n\n\nhave something deep in common that is the source of their common\nappeal, as demonstrated by Sidgwick [1907]. (M. Schroeder 2007:\n290)\n\n\nFor the two theories share a commitment to\n Most Reason to Desire\n in that they are both act-consequentialist theories, broadly\nconstrued. That is, they both hold that whether an agent ought to\nperform an act is determined solely by whether that agent ought to\nprefer its outcome to those of the available alternatives. It\u2019s\njust that whereas the ethical egoist holds that agents ought always to\nprefer that they themselves have more hedonic utility, the utilitarian\nholds that agents ought always to prefer that there is more hedonic\nutility overall.\n\nMost Reason to Desire\n also seems to be what Philippa Foot (1985) had in mind. Foot\nsaid,\n\n\nWhat is it\u2026that is so compelling about [act-]consequentialism?\nIt is, I think, the rather simple thought that it can never be right\nto prefer a worse state of affairs to a better. It is this thought\nthat haunts us. (1985: 198)\n\n\nBut, of course, act-consequentialism is not a theory about what it is\nright to prefer, but rather a theory about what it is right\nto do. Nevertheless, we can charitably interpret Foot as\nassuming that the Compelling Idea is\n Most Reason to Desire.\n This idea in conjunction with her claim that it can never be right to\nprefer a worse state of affairs to a better one entails the thought\nthat it is always morally permissible to bring about the best outcome,\nand this is the thought that she sought to debunk by arguing that we\nhave no grasp of the notion of the best outcome except as the outcome\nmost favored by benevolence from among those actions permitted by\njustice. The problem, though, is that Foot is wrong about its never\nbeing right to prefer a worse state of affairs to a better one. For,\nas Jamie Dreier has pointed out,\n\n\nit is perfectly intelligible and pretty plausible that it is fitting\nfor me to prefer, say, the safety of my children to the safety of\nyours, and for you conversely to prefer your children\u2019s safety\nto mine. (2011: 101)\n\n\nSo, even if we should accept Foot\u2019s assumption that\n Most Reason to Desire\n is the Compelling Idea, we should reject her assumption that it can\nnever be right to prefer a worse outcome to a better outcome. After\nall, the outcome in which my less gifted child is saved is, other\nthings being equal, worse than the one in which your more gifted child\nis saved (that is, it should, other things being equal, be\ndispreferred from a universal point of view), but I should,\nnevertheless, prefer it from my own point of view.\n\nAlthough\n Most Reason to Desire\n is quite compelling, it is not unique to act-consequentialism. For it\nturns out that consequentializing is a double-edged sword in that it\ncan just as easily be employed to render non-consequentialism\ncompatible with Most Reason to Desire as it can be used to\nrender act-consequentialism compatible with commonsense deontic\nverdicts (Sachs 2010). For in showing that there is a ranking of\noutcomes that renders act-consequentialism compatible with some\nnon-consequentialist theory\u2019s deontic verdicts, the\nconsequentializer also shows that there is a ranking of outcomes (the\nvery same one) that renders this non-consequentialist theory\ncompatible with Most Reason to Desire. As Benjamin Sachs\npoints out,\n\n\nall the non-consequentialist has to do in order to make her theory\ncompatible with the Compelling Idea is accept the fruits of the\nconsequentialist\u2019s labor. (2010: 261)\n\n\nBut although this works so long as we hold that the Compelling Idea is\nsomething like\n Most Reason to Desire,\n it doesn\u2019t work if we think that the Compelling Idea includes a\nclaim about what, on act-consequentialism, grounds the\ndeontic statuses of actions. Consider that Sachs\u2019s objection\nrests on the assumption that the best version of non-consequentialism\nis compatible with the Compelling Idea if the best version of\nact-consequentialism is compatible with the Compelling Idea. And, as\neven he admits, this assumption holds only if the Compelling Idea\ndoesn\u2019t include a claim about what, on act-consequentialism,\ngrounds the deontic statuses of actions (Sachs 2010: 266\u20139). So,\nif the earnest consequentializer wants to avoid Sachs\u2019s\nobjection, they need only to adopt something like the following\nproposal.\n\nReasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses: An\nact\u2019s deontic status is grounded in the agent\u2019s reasons\nfor preferring its outcome to those of the available alternatives.\nConsequently, it is always morally permissible for an agent to perform\nthe option that would bring about the outcome that they ought (or that\nit is fitting for them) to prefer to every available alternative\n(Portmore 2011: 5).\n\nLike\n Most Reason to Desire,\n this proposal has the advantage of accounting for the thought that\nthe Compelling Idea is something that both utilitarianism and ethical\negoism hold in common. What\u2019s more, it seems quite attractive to\nmany\u2014or, at least, to those who accept a teleological conception\nof action. On this conception, actions are attempts to affect how the\nworld goes. And, thus, whenever one acts intentionally, one acts with\nthe aim of making the world go a certain way. The aim needn\u2019t be\nanything having to do with the causal consequences of the act. The aim\ncould be nothing more than to perform the act in question. One could,\nfor instance, run merely with the aim of running. But the fact remains\nthat, for every intentional action, there is some end at which the\nagent aims. Thus, it\u2019s natural to suppose that the reasons for\nperforming an action derive from the reasons for desiring the ends\nthat it would achieve. And, so, one has most reason to act in whatever\nway will make the world go as one ought to prefer that it goes (see\nMill 1861 [1991]: Ch. 1; Portmore 2019: 262\u20133; Thomson 2003: 8;\nWood 2017: 266). After all, wouldn\u2019t it be odd to think that one\nisn\u2019t permitted to do what would best achieve the aims that one\nought to want to achieve? In any case, given\n Most Reason to Desire\u2019s\n inclusion of the claim that an act\u2019s deontic status is grounded\nin the agent\u2019s reasons for preferring its outcome to those of\nthe available alternatives (which earnest consequentializers take to\nbe definitive of act-consequentialism), it is at least unique to\nact-consequentialism.\n\nSo, if\n Reasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses\n is indeed compelling, then there is something uniquely compelling\nabout act-consequentialism. And, in that case, the earnest\nconsequentializer is off and running. But, some\u2014such as Paul\nHurley (2018)\u2014deny that it is compelling. But even if he is\ncorrect, this poses no problem for either notational\nconsequentializers or pragmatic consequentializers, for neither\ninsists on there being something uniquely compelling about\nact-consequentialism. So, this would be a worry for only earnest\nconsequentializers.\n",
