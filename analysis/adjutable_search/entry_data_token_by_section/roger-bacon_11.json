    "main_text": "Bacon\u2019s Later Philosophy: Language Study and Science in the Service of both Moral Philosophy and Theology || Opus maius/Parts One and Two\n5.2 Opus maius/Parts One and Two\n\nBefore presenting the seven parts of the Opus maius, it is\nimportant to note a factor that is absent from the scholarship, that\nis, how Bacon\u2019s Islamic sources structure this major work. These\nsources, of course, are integrated with his Greek and Latin sources.\nMost important here for the architecture of the latter work is the\nDe scientiis of Alfarabi. The division of the sciences and\nthe reduction of the linguistic and natural sciences to moral\nphilosophy is strongly influenced by this text. Part four and the\nlatter section of Part six on prognostication, and Part seven, IV, is\ninfluenced by Abu Ma\u2019shar\u2019s Introduction to Astronomy and\nby his Book of Conjunctions. Part five on Perspectiva is a masterpiece\nof synthesis of most of the major Greek and Muslim texts on Optics.\nEspecially important are the texts of Ptolemy, Alkindi, and Ibn\nal-Haytham. This synthesis clearly influences Bacon\u2019s new\nunderstanding of an experimental science. And yet in addition to this,\none must note that Ptolemy in his Almagest, Optics and\nAstrology influences Bacon\u2019s understanding of method in the\nsciences as it impacts the integration of reason and experience. And\nin the third part of the Scientia experimentalis,Bacon is influenced\non the important commentary on Ptolemy\u2019Astrology, namely, the\nCentiloquium by Abu Ja\u2019far IbnYusuf Ibn Ibrahim. But\nsince Bacon\u2019s De multiplication specierum is\nacknowledged by him as the key to his Optics, one must note the\nstructural presence of the De Radiis attributed to Al-Kindi.\nThis work provides the basis for his doctrine of species that will be\nspelled out for the geometry of vision in the Perspectiva. Since the\nOpus maius and related later works are intended as sketch for\na grand linguistic, scientific, philosophical and theological work,\none must note the important openness that Bacon has for the science,\nphilosophy and theology received from the Muslim and Jewish worlds.\nThis is very different from the Anti-Arabism and the intermittent\nAnti-Judaism that would become a central part of Western Renaissance\nculture after 1300.\n\nPart one examines \u201cthe causes of error\u201d in education and\nis critical of some theological limits on science. These causes are:\nbelief in unworthy authority; long custom; uncritical popular opinion;\nconcealment of academic ignorance in a display of rhetorical wisdom.\nThe polemic is presented as one of conflict among the canon lawyers\nand theologians at Paris concerning the reception of Aristotle and\nrecent works on Greek and Arabic sciences, especially\nastronomy/astrology. This is Roger Bacon\u2019s appeal to the Wisdom\nof the Ancients\n\nPart two contains the pre-Cartesian view of truth and wisdom as a\nresult of a universal revelation to the Hebrews that was transmitted\nthrough the Greeks, Romans, and Islam to medieval Christianity. This\nview would be influential in Philosophy up to the age of Francis Bacon\nand Descartes. Roger Bacon links it to a doctrine of illumination\ntaken from Augustine, Avicenna, and the commentary on the\nPseudo-Ptolemy: Centiloquium. He contrasts the tradition of\nthe great philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the mythical\ntraditions from ancient times.\n5.3 Opus maius/Part Three: On Language, De signis and Compendium Studii philosophiae\n\nPart three deals with language study, grammar, semantics, and\nsemiotics, and contains Bacon\u2019s general theory of signs. The\n1978 discovery by the late Jan Pinborg and his colleagues of De\nSignis, a missing section of part three, led to intense study of\nBacon\u2019s semiotics and the philosophy of language in his later\nworks. Bacon\u2019s proposals are radical. \n\nBacon\u2019s concerns with language in his later works transgress the\ndisciplinary boundaries of the medieval university. First, he demands\nthat the universities study the Wisdom languages, i.e., Hebrew, Greek,\nLatin in one list, or Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, and Chaldean in another.\nHe wrote Greek and Hebrew grammars (GGHG). Bacon takes Latin as a\nmodel for a natural language, the \u201cmother language\u201d of the\nWest. For Bacon, this language is dependent on Greek and Hebrew. He\ndistinguishes the \u201cvulgar language\u201d or \u201clanguage of\nthe laity\u201d from the \u201clanguage of learning\u201d of the\nclergy. For him, vulgar language cannot be used in learning; it does\nnot have an adequate technical vocabulary. \n\nBacon\u2019s relative originality consists in the fact that he brings\ntogether the semantic and semiotic concerns of both Arts and Theology\nor, as one might say, Aristotle and Augustine, into a creative\nsynthesis. From Augustine, he carries over significant elements of\nStoic Logic. From these concerns, he develops his own novel theory of\nthe sign. In the Communia naturalium, Bacon notes that he had\nto develop a new logic needed to deal with his new interests in the\nsciences. Indeed, Bacon uses the words signification and its\ncognates in a manner quite different from the traditional\nposition.\n\nThe commonly used medieval definition of a sign was substitutional or\nrepresentational: \u201cA sign is that which shows itself to the\nsenses and presents something else to the intellect.\u201d This\ndefinition is similar to that of Augustine in De dialectica\n(p. 86): \u201cA sign is something which is itself sensed and which\nindicates to the mind something beyond the sign itself.\u201d[3]  In this case, the parts of our language are given by either God or the human so that the thoughts of the speaker can be communicated to the mind of the hearer. The expressions in language stand for the\nthoughts of the speaker and represent them to the hearer. In De\nsignis, Bacon provides the following definition: \u201cFor the\nsign is that which, offered to the senses or to the\nintellect, represents itself to that intellect, since not every\nsign is offered to the senses as the common definition of sign\nsupposes. However, on the testimony of Aristotle, another kind is\noffered only to the intellect.\u201d He states that the passiones\nanime (concepts/species) are signs of things, and such\npassiones are habits of the soul and species\n(representations/intentions) of the thing existing for the soul, and\ntherefore, \u201cthey are offered only to the intellect so that they\nrepresent external things to that intellect\u201d ([DS], 82). Some\ninterpreters claim that Bacon\u2019s definition of sign is close to\nthat of to that of Augustine in De doctrina Christiana:\n\u201cFor a sign is something that apart from the impression it gives\nto the senses, also causes something else from itself to be present to\nthe\n mind.\u201d[4]\n Augustine gives the examples of animal tracks leading us to think of\nthe animal, smoke leading us to think of fire, human expressions\nleading to our understanding the mood of a person, and soldiers\nanswering the call of the trumpet in battle and then knowing where to\nmarch.\n\nOne can see that Bacon in a manner uncommon for his times relates\nAugustine\u2019s definition of sign to the inferential notion of sign\nin the works of Aristotle. And so one can also see how Bacon,\ninfluenced by Kilwardby and Fischacre, unites the different concerns\nof the philosopher and the theologian.\n\nBacon continues and states: \u201cThe sign is in the predicament of\nrelation.\u201d This may sound innocent, but in Bacon\u2019s account\nit has the effect of transforming the traditional relation between a\nsign and its meaning, either a thing or a concept. The theologians\nwere aware of a twofold relation: that of sign to thing signified and\nsign to the perceiver of the sign. For the majority of theologians,\nthe first relation is an essential and permanent relation; the latter\nis accidental and non-permanent. Bacon reverses this. He remarks,\n\n\nThe sign is in the predicament of relation and is spoken of\nessentially in reference to the one for whom it signifies. For it\nposits that thing in act when the sign itself is in act and in potency\nwhen the sign itself is in potency. But unless some were able to\nconceive by means of this sign, it would be void and vain. Indeed, it\nwould not be a sign, but would have remained a sign only according to\nthe substance of a sign. But it would not be a definition of the sign,\njust as the substance of the father remains when the son is dead, but\nthe relation of paternity is lost. ([DS], 81)\n\n\nAnd so it is not sufficient that a sign have reference to what it\nsignifies (accusative) in order to be a sign; it is also required that\nit have an interpreter (dative) for whom it signifies. In medieval\ntheology, the thing signified (accusative) has priority, and was true\neven if there were no interpreters. The notion of this two-way\nrelation is found in Bonaventure, Rufus, and Fishacre among others,\nand the thing signified holds ontological priority over the\nrelationship of sign to perceiver. \n\nFor Bacon, the communicative relation to a hearer is basic, and the\nrelation to the thing signified is important but secondary in the\nwhole context of communication. The common theological teaching held\nthat the relation of sign to thing signified is primary and\nfundamental. Once a name has been instituted, it does not change\n(Maloney 1983b). And so, the name \u2018Caesar\u2019 can be used of\nboth the living and the dead Caesar. Against Rufus and Bonaventure,\nBacon held that this introduced ambiguity into language. Even in the\ncase of ordinary signs such as that of a tavern, they remain a sign\nonly potentially if there are no customers or staff.\n\nBacon\u2019s own classification of signs introduces distinctions that\nreflect an integration of Augustine and Aristotle:\n\n1.\nNatural Signs\n    \n1.1\nSignifying by concomitance, inference, and consequence\n        \n1.1.1 Necessarily\n1.1.2 Probability\n\n1.2\nSignifying by configuration and likeness\n1.3\nCause and effect\n\n2.\nIntentional Signs purposefully generated\n     \n2.1\nSignifying conventionally by means of a concept\n          \n2.1.1\nLinguistic signs by way of imperfect deliberation: interjections\n2.1.2\nLinguistic signs by way of perfect [completed] deliberation: other parts of speech\n2.1.3\nNon-linguistic signs (language of gestures, monk-signs, sign-boards)\n\n2.2\nSignifying naturally, in the mode of affect\n\n2.2.1\nProducts of the sensitive soul: animal sounds\n2.2.2\nProducts of the rational soul: groans, exclamations, cries of\n pain[5]\n\n\n\n\nThe distinction between 1 and 2 is taken from Augustine\u2019s De\ndoctrina Christiana. Bacon himself claims that he worked out the\ntypology himself prior to finding it in Augustine\u2019s great work\non interpretation. Modern scholars, however, believe that he must in\nsome way have borrowed it from Augustine (Maloney 1995). The\ndistinction between 2.1 and 2.2 is taken from the Aristotelian\ntradition as handed down by Boethius. Type 1 signs occur naturally as\npart of the agency of nature. Type 2 are signs only because they have\nbeen willfully created as such by deliberation; included here are\nlinguistic and non-linguistic signs. However, Type 2.2 are designated\n\u2018natural\u2019 in a sense that is different from Type 1. These\nsounds and groans are products of nature and happen instinctively but\nin an \u201canimate\u201d action.\n\nInterjections are a problem. They are parts of language, conventional\nsigns, and so conceptual, yet they are emitted suddenly and often due\nto pain. They are similar in a way to the groans of animals (Type\n2.2). This discussion is common to writers on grammar and logic from\nthe 1240s, especially in the works of Richard Kilwardby and similar\nauthors.\n\nThe signs in 1.1 on natural consequence indicate that Bacon has\nintegrated not only Aristotle and Augustine but also the work of\nAverroes on the Rhetoric of Aristotle. Thomas S. Maloney has\nargued that Aristotle\u2019s De anima plays an important role\nin Bacon\u2019s distinction between signs by nature and signs by\nintention (Maloney 1983a). Bacon provides an analysis of ambiguity and\nequivocation in the De signis and Compendium studii\ntheologiae (Maloney 1984).\n5.2.1 Bacon and the Semiotic Triangle\n\nIn the traditional semiotic triangle inherited from Plato and\nAristotle, the sign is a symbol and symptom of the passiones\nanimae (concepts/species) in the soul and the latter in turn have\na relation of similitude to extra-mental things. And so the relation\nof sign to thing is indirect. Bacon gets rid of the mediation of\nconcepts/species and has the sign refer directly to the object. In\nthis way, Bacon substitutes an extensional relation for an intensional\nrelation. Words can directly refer to individual things, be\nthey single objects in the world, mental objects, or philosophical\nconcepts. Primarily, then, words refer strictly to the present object.\nReference to past or future objects will require the extension of\nunivocal terms by means of analogy or metaphor. Simply because a sign\nexists, it will not follow from that alone that the object of the sign\nexists. As we saw above, without the interpreter of the sign, a sign\nis a sign in name only or potentially. Bacon does not deny the\nexistence of the concept/species, but notes that a second imposition\nof meaning is required to name it. As Umberto Eco puts it,\n\u201cBacon definitely destroys the semiotic triangle that was\nformulated since Plato, by which the relationship between words and\nreferents is mediated by the idea, or by the concept, or by the\ndefinition\u201d (Eco 1989, 61). The relation of sign to concept is\nreduced to that of a symptom, which is no longer a symbol. Here one\ncan see the preparation of the ground for the semiotics of William of\nOckham and late medieval nominalism.\n5.4 Opus maius/Parts Four, Five and Six: Mathematics and Philosophy of Nature (De multiplicatione specierum, Perspectiva, Scientia Experimentalis)\n\nParts four, five, and six of the Opus maius present the main\nthemes of Bacon\u2019s contribution to scientific education. It is\nimportant to see his main contribution to science as one who advocated\n\u201cscientific education\u201d in an Arts Faculty that was\npredominantly dedicated to linguistic arts. Bacon had a very wide\nreading knowledge of most of the newly translated work from Greek,\nJewish, and Islamic Philosophy and Science. His major claim to fame in\nscience is that he is the first Latin Western thinker to comprehend\nand write on most of the ancient sources of optics. In brief, he\ninitiates the tradition of Optics/Perspectiva in the Latin\nworld. This tradition would be formulated as teaching text by his\ncontemporaries Pecham and Witelo. Bacon\u2019s optics was also read\nand commented on in 14th century Italy by, especially by Lorenzo\nGhiberti. It was known to and used by Leonardo Da Vinci. And it was\npart of the tradition of learning that led to Kepler and Descartes. In\nhis Perspectiva and De scientia experimentali, Bacon\noutlines a sketch for a scientific method, one that takes optics as\nthe model for an experimental science. In fact, he succeeded in his\nendeavor in that Perspectiva was added to the four\ntraditional university subjects of the quadrivium: arithmetic,\ngeometry, astronomy, music.\n\nOpus maius, Part four, deals with mathematics and the\napplications of mathematics. Bacon presents reasons for a reduction of\nlogic to mathematics (a kind of reversal of modern logicism) and sees\nmathematics as the key to an understanding of nature (Perler 2005).\nClearly, he is proclaiming the \u201cusefulness\u201d of mathematics\nfor knowledge; he is not doing mathematical theory. And the branch of\nmathematics that is important here is geometry. He applies it in\ndetail in the optical works edited by Lindberg. Following his\nabbreviation of the De multiplicatione specierum in part four\nof the Great Work, which shows how mathematics might be applied to\nphysics, he deals with the application of astronomy/astrology to human\naffairs, the uses of mathematics in religious rites as in chronology,\nmusic, symbolism, calendar reform, and geographical knowledge, and a\nresume of astrology (Rutkin, 2019). It used to be thought that Bacon\nwas a Platonist in his view of the absolute priority of mathematics.\nMore recently, that view has been seriously qualified. He does not\nreduce physics to mathematics. Indeed, his explicit work on\nmathematics, the Communia mathematica, is not an exercise in\nmathematics, but a presentation of the \u201ccommon notions\u201d\nthat are important for a variety of mathematical practices. Bacon\nhimself acknowledges those who were better mathematicians, namely,\nJohn of London, Pierre de Maricourt, and Campanus of Novara (Molland\n1997). In general, Bacon is more interested in how mathematics can\ncontribute to knowledge of the world as an aid to missionary activity.\nHe sent a map of the world to the Pope. \n\nBacon was very interested in the applications of astronomy/astrology\nto human events. Federici Vescovini (2011) has now provided the\nessential context and linkage between medieval magic and philosophy,\nenabling scholars to grasp the dimensions of fate and freedom as\nunderstood by medieval philosophers and theologians. Although\ncommitted to freedom of the will, Bacon held to a deterministic notion\nof causation in nature based on the Introductorium Maius in\nAstronomiam of the Islamic authority on Astrology, Abu Ma\u2019\nShar (Albumassar), on the De radiis of al-Kindi, and on the\nCentiloquium by Pseudo-Ptolemy (Ahmed Ibn Yusuf). And since\nhe held to a doctrine of universal radiation in nature, he had to\naccount for the influence of the heavens on the human body and hence\nindirectly on the human mind. Much of the polemic in his later works\nconsists of a justification of this interest in an astrologically\nnecessitated universe in the face of traditional theological\nobjections. These works play a big role as background for his natural\nphilosophy in De multiplicatione specierum. He was also\ninterested in alchemy. It was his determined interest in some of these\nareas of study that led to disagreement with his superiors in the\nFranciscan Order, specifically, Bonaventure.\n5.4.1 The Philosophy of Nature\n\nBacon\u2019s treatise De multiplicatione specierum, his\nmajor later work on physics, written before 1267, is closely related\nto the study of light, vision, and perception in the\nPerspectiva. David C. Lindberg (DMP, Introduction) has noted\nthat Bacon takes Grosseteste\u2019s physics of light, a development\nof Al-Kindi\u2019s universal radiation of force, out of its\nmetaphysical background and develops a universal doctrine of physical\ncausation.\n\nLindberg had already traced the history of the emanation theory of\nlight from Plotinus to Bacon. Lindberg notes the influence of\nal-Kindi\u2019s work on the rays of the stars but does not cited\ndetailed evidence. What Bacon achieves is a comprehensive theory of\nphysical force divorced from psychological, moral, and religious\ninterpretation. As Lindberg puts it (DMP, Introduction), in this work,\nBacon does not formally examine divine illumination of the intellect,\nuniversal hylomorphism, the plurality of forms (properly qualified),\nand the separability of soul. He restricts himself to presenting a\nfull theory of the physics of light. Species is the first effect of\nany natural agent. As Lindberg puts it (DMP, Introduction),\n\u201cThis is a complete physical and mathematical analysis of the\nradiation of force--and, thus, of natural causation.\u201d\n\nThe use of \u2018species\u2019 in this account is not that of\nPorphyry\u2019s logic or the perceptual notion of likeness. It\nis\u201cthe force or power by which any object acts on its\nsurroundings.\u201d It denotes \u201cal-Kindi\u2019s universal\nforce, radiating from everything in the world to produce\neffects.\u201d As Bacon himself notes,\n\n\nspecies [force, power] is the first effect of an agent\u2026the\nagent sends forth a species into the matter of the recipient, so that,\nthrough the species first produced, it can bring forth out of the\npotentiality of matter [of the recipient] the complete effect that it\nintends ([DMS], 6\u20137). This is a universal theory of natural\ncausation as the background for his philosophy of vision and\nperception. Most importantly, species is a univocal product of the\nagent. The first immediate effect of any natural action is\ndefinite, specific, and uniform. This production is not the imparting\nor imposition of an external form. The effect of the species is to\nbring forth the form out of the active potency of the recipient\nmatter. (DMS, 6\u20137)\n Al-Kindi\u2019s De radiis, his optics, and\nthat of Ibn Al-Haytham form the background to this teaching on\nspecies.\n\n\nThis also leads to an attempt to provide separate domains for material\nand spiritual being. Bacon is adamant on this point: spiritual and\nmaterial being are entirely separate. Natural causation occurs\n\u201cnaturally,\u201d according to regular processes or laws of\nnature. There is no \u201cspiritual being\u201d in the material\nmedium as was commonly taught by other scholastic philosophers. That\nis, Bacon objected to the use of the term \u2018spiritual being in\nthe medium\u2019. No, for Bacon, universal causation is corporeal and\nmaterial, and matter itself is not just pure potentiality but is\nrather something positive in itself. So, in terms of\nexplaining \u2018spiritual/intentional being\u2019 in the medium,\nBacon is of the view that the introduction of such terms muddy the\nwaters, especially if you are trying to come up with a comprehensive\ndoctrine of physical force. Hence, the general philosophy of nature\nprepares the theoretical ground for the specific application of\nmathematics to matters of vision and perception. It also allows for\nand requires a metaphorical extension of these terms to moral and\nreligious domains.\n\nRecent scholarship on Bacon\u2019s philosophy of nature, especially\nthat of Yael Raizman-Kedar (Raizman-Kedar, 2009; Raizman-Kedar,\ndissertation, University of Haifa, 2009) places great emphasis on the\nimportance of the concept of species for Bacon\u2019s\naccount of perception and mind. She is correct to note that Bacon\nplaces a kind of natural activity in the mind via species. This leads\nin her view to natural species having a direct role in intellectual\nactivity as such. One could speak of the direct presence of material,\ncorporeal species in the intellect itself (see section 5.2 above for\nBacon\u2019s complex discussion of the role of signs in animal and\nhuman knowing). Here, and also in the Perspectiva, we can see\nthe importance of the cogitative sense, as it takes on an\nadministrative role in animals analogous to reason in human beings.\nBut in this life, for Bacon, human beings cannot know things in the\nworld without the presence of species in the mind. Species as the\nexpression of universal agency act naturally in nature and in the mind\nin a certain limited sense. Yet, Raizman-Kedar claims, \u201cthe very\nsame species issued by physical objects operate qua material\nspecies within the intellect as well.\u201d She also claims that the\nconcept of divine illumination plays a secondary role in the\nacquisition of knowledge, and that Bacon\n\n\nregarded innate knowledge as dispositional and confused, the\nspecies, representing their agents in essence, definition,\nand operation, arrive in the intellect without undergoing a complete\nabstraction from matter and retaining the character of agents acting\nnaturally. In this way, Bacon sets the intellect as separate from the\nnatural world not in an essential way, but rather in degree\n(my italics), thus supplying a theoretical justification for the\nability to access and know nature. (Raizman-Kedar, 2009, 131; after\n2012 the author writes as Kedar)\n\n\nRaizman-Kedar correctly stresses the central role of species\n(material/corporeal) in the acquisition of intellectual knowledge of\nmaterial particular things in the world. Further, she carefully\ndistinguishes between the role of hearing and sight in the knowledge\nprocess.\n\nHackett (2018c) raises questions about this conclusion. He points to a\nsignificant problem with the translation of a central passage in\nPerspectiva in support of this position. Further, by placing\nBacon alongside his confr\u00e8re, one can see that the doctrine of\ndivine illumination plays a central role in both pure intellectual\nknowledge, moral knowledge and knowledge of the natural world. Yes,\nthe material species are a necessary but not a sufficient element in\nthe acquisition of pure intellectual knowledge. Without the\nilluminative process within from above, pure intellectual vision is\nblocked. It is not at all clear that one can claim that Bacon is a\nmaterial monist. Bacon\u2019s separation of the account of physical\nspecies in the DMP could lead one to think he has to be a material\nmonist, even with regard to species in the medium, sense, and reason.\nAnd there is one sense in which this is true. But in the end, as he\nstates in both the DMP and the PRSP, matter and spirit are two\nentirely separate kinds of substance. Hence, at a deep level, Bacon is\na substance dualist (medieval version).\n5.4.2 The Perspectiva and De speculum comburentibus (1266\u201367)\n\nIn his Perspectiva and related works, Bacon presents his\nmodel for a careful and detailed application of mathematics to the\nstudy of nature and mind. In imitation of the De aspectibus\nof Alhacen (Ibn al-Haytham), he provided an application of geometry to\nvision that within the terms of reference of his times was successful.\nBut he is critical of both Alhacen and Ptolemy. He sees himself as\nanswering some of the optical problems not solved by either\nauthor.\n\nBacon\u2019s approach to vision and perception, however, is not an\nexercise in modern mathematical optics. It should be seen as the\nsketch of a physics of light as the basis for a philosophy of\nperception and mind. The account of visual perception in terms of\nnatural philosophy, medicine, and philosophy of mind is found in Parts\none and a section of Part two. The account of Perspectiva\nsets out a consideration of direct, reflected, and refracted rays, and\nat the end of Part three concludes with the application of geometrical\nmodels for moral and religious considerations. The analysis of natural\nvision provides analogies and descriptions for an understanding of\ndivine influence.\n\nPart one and also distinctiones one and two of Part two deal\nwith the structure of the eye, problems of vision, and visual errors.\nThe aim is psychological and epistemological, that is, Bacon sets out\nthe conditions for certifiable/verifiable and certain perception. The\ntheory of the eye is taken from the Galenic tradition handed down in\nConstantine the African\u2019s translation of Hunyan Ibn Isaq and\nfrom Avicenna and Alhacen. For this tradition, vision occurs when the\ncrystalline humor is altered by the intromission of visual species\nfrom the object. Vision is completed when the species proceeds through\nthe vitreous humor to the optic nerve and through this to the common\nnerve. It is here that a common visual judgment is made. Throughout\nthe text, Bacon makes reference to the kind of visual knowledge\npossessed by animals, especially in the context of a discussion of the\ncogitative sense. Bacon follows Ibn al-Haytham and imposes a\ngeometrical model on the eye, enabling him to give a geometrical\naccount of radiation through the eye. How then does one avoid\nconfusion in vision and gain verifiable clarity? For Bacon, the\nperpendicular ray is primary; the other rays are treated as cases of\nindirect vision, refracted in the rear surface of the crystalline\nhumor.\n\nBacon is next concerned with optical illusions, inverted images,\nmagnification, vision of distant objects, the moon illusion, and such\nmatters. He seeks in a rational and experimental manner to solve the\npuzzles found in Ptolemy, Alhacen, and others. Still, he is a child of\nhis sources, which do not provide him with the more advanced data and\nmathematical method that arose only later, in the seventeenth century.\nBut they do provide him with a functional qualitative geometry of the\neye and vision based on the best Greek and Islamic science. Bacon is\ncommitted to an intromission theory of vision, though he combines it\nwith an extramissionist theory that avoids the anthropomorphisms of\nearlier extramissionist theories. He uses the latter theory mainly to\nemphasize the active role of the eye in vision.\n\nIn Parts two and three, he is to some extent successful in applying\ngeometry to problems of direct, reflected, and refracted vision. He\nmoved the study of these matters to a new level. The geometrical\narguments are worked out with careful diagrams and various appeals are\nmade to \u201cexperimental\u201d conditions. What are these\nconditions? Some of them are simple thought-experiments or even\nreports of actual experiments from earlier writers. It seems clear,\nhowever, that Bacon himself did experimental work with pinhole images,\nlenses, and discrete observations. This does not lead to a pure\ngeometrization of nature, however, and he inevitably falls back on\nphysical, perceptual, and metaphysical arguments. One might argue that\nhe lacks the notion of infinity that is present in modern\ngeometry.\n\nBacon introduces another important item for science. He refers to the\n\u201claws of reflection and refraction\u201d as leges communes\nnature. In his account of nature in Communia naturalium\nand the later works in general, Bacon\u2019s view is that a general\nlaw of nature governs universal force. This universal law of nature is\nimposed on a world of Aristotelian natures. This notion would have a\nsignificant future in experimental science. This concept of a\nuniversal law of nature has been highlighted by M. Schramm (1998). It\nhas now been taken up by Yael Raizman-Kedar and Professor Giora Hon,\nwho are studying the development of universal laws of nature from\nRoger Bacon to the Early Modern Period.\n\n\nBacon ends Part three with an account of how a better understanding of\nnatural phenomena could lead to a more accurate knowledge of the\nnatural phenomena mentioned in Scripture. He finds in visual phenomena\nsignificant metaphors and analogies for use in moral and religious\nteaching. A solution to David C. Lindberg\u2019s queries about\nBacon\u2019s attempt to combine elements of the intromissionist and\nextramissionist theories of vision is addressed here. At one level, it\nseems to be an akward combination of two conflicting theories of\nvision. This combination can be understood when one notes that Bacon\nis making use of the important issue of grace and free will issue as\nthe moral-religious background for his discussion of vision. In other\nwords, genuine theological concerns influence the manner in which\nBacon constructs his analysis of vision in the Perspectiva.\nThus, the analyses of Ptolemy and Alhacen had to be synthesized within\na definite theological framework.\n\nDirect evidence of Bacon\u2019s influence here in making science\navailable for an educated public is seen in the use of his work by\nPierre de Limoges in his influential text, De oculo morali\n(On the Moral Eye), written at Paris between 1275 and 1289. MS Paris,\nBN Lat. 7434, owned by Pierre de Limoges, contains an early copy of\nBacon\u2019s Perspectiva. All of this suggests Pierre de\nLimoges,(magnus theologus et astronomus) as a very early\nreader of Bacon\u2019s works (Newhauser 2001). Both are genuinely\ncommitted to theimprovement of the task of the preacher. Here, we see\nthe priority for Bacon of preaching over theology, or rather, the\nlatter is in service to the former (Johnson 2009).\n5.4.3 On the Nature of Experimental Science: De scientia experimentali (1266\u201367)\n\nPresupposing the Perspectiva, in De scientia\nexperimentali and in related works on the halo and on burning\nmirrors Bacon situates this new scientific practice as a desired area\nof study in the medieval university. It is consequent on the study of\nPerspectiva. Starting from Aristotle\u2019s account of\nempeiria (experience), Bacon argues that logical argument\nalone, even when it originates from experience, is not sufficient for\nthe \u201cverification of things\u201d. Even arguments that have\ntheir origins in experience will need to be verified by means of an\nintuition of the things in the world. He distinguishes scientific\nargument from moral and religious mystical intuition, although he does\nallow for the notion of a revealed intuition in science. It is this\nelement that clearly separates Bacon\u2019s practice from that of\nmodern science. Just as in his concern with the certification of\nlanguage to gain individual reference, so too in science, Bacon\nclearly wishes to have a way of certification for knowledge of the\nindividual.\n\nHis aim is to provide a method for science, one that is\nanalogous to the use of logic to test validity in arguments. This new\npractical method consists of a combination of mathematics and detailed\nexperiential descriptions of discrete phenomena in nature. It would be\ndistinguished from the conjurations of magic and from moral and\nreligious belief. It would also be different from philosophy of nature\nand from broad optical knowledge. These two areas are important for\nexperimental science, but they constitute general principles, so that\nin themselves and without experiment, they do not provide access to\nminute, detailed experiments. Nevertheless, for his description of the\nfirst example of an experimental science, the study of the rainbow,\nBacon depends on the accounts handed on by Aristotle, Seneca, and\nAvicenna. He is not uncritical of these accounts.\n\nOne source for Bacon\u2019s methodology in an experimental science\nhas been overlooked by the scholarship. It is clear to all that Bacon\nmade much use of and privileged Ptolemy\u2019s Optics. What has been\nmissed is that Bacon was also influenced by Ptolemy\u2019s\nmethodology in the introductory chapter to the Almagest. The\ncombination there of experience and geometrical reason is in some\nrespects different and more detailed than in Aristotle\u2019s\nscientific methodology. And so even as Bacon uses Aristotle\u2019s\ntexts, he is employing the methodological assumptions of Ptolemy. \n\nFurther, Bacon\u2019s very close connection of experience and reason\nis influenced by his concerns with medical matters. (Roger Bacon,\nDe erroribus medicorum). This text provides a wider\ndiscussion of Chapter one of Opus maius, Part six. \n\nThe context for Bacon\u2019s writing on topics from the\nMeteorology of Aristotle came from the presence in Paris of\nthe new translation of this work from Greek into Latin. With the\nrecent critical edition of the Aristoteles Latinus version of\nthe Meteorology, it is clear that Bacon is deliberately\noffering a criticism of William of Moerbeke\u2019s translation. Bacon\ncontends that the translations are not adequate and that the\ntranslator did not know the required sciences, especially\nPerspectiva, proposing instead a more accurate mathematical\nanalysis of the phenomenon of the rainbow.\n\nBacon\u2019s own important contribution is to be found in his\ncalculation of the measured value of 42 degrees for the maximum\nelevation of the rainbow. This was probably done with an astrolabe,\nand in this, Bacon advocates the skillful mathematical use of\ninstruments for an experimental science. That Bacon had mathematical\ncompetence in this field can be seen in his account of the halo in the\nOpus tertiium (OQHI) and in his complex arguments in De\nspeculis comburentibus. Bacon takes up Grosseteste\u2019s theory\nof refraction and tries to work out the difficulties in the latter. It\nwould appear at first glance that Bacon is rejecting the notion of\nrefraction out of hand (Lindberg 1966), but in fact he is only\ndemonstrating that refraction as formulated by Grosseteste did not\nmake experimental or rational sense. Bacon knew the rules governing\nthe geometry of refraction. Important here is his emphasis on the role\nof individual drops of water for the process of reflection and\nrefraction. The new research on the De iride of Grosseteste\nby Cecilia Panti and the other editors of the Oxford/Durham Robert\nGrosseteste project will shed much light on these matters. A correct\naccount of the rainbow would be summarized some forty years after\nBacon in the De iride of Theodoric of Freiberg (d. c. 1307)\n[TFT], with his account of a single reflection and double refraction\nin single drops of water. \n\nA second task for experimental science is the discovery by\n\u2018experience\u2019 alone of instruments (e.g., the armillary\nsphere), new medical cures, chemical discovery, and military\ntechnologies. An important item here is the discovery of magnetism. It\nwould seem that Bacon is reporting on the actual experimental work of\nMagister Petrus Peregrinus (fl. 1260\u201377), author of De\nmagnete, who is lauded in the Opus tertium as the only\nworthwhile \u201cexperimentalist\u201d at Paris (see Silvia Nagel\n2012). Bacon has been lauded down the centuries for his medical\nlearning, but recent scholarship has limited the number of works\nattributed to Bacon. Still, it is important to note that he did draw\non medical practice to set out rules and procedures. Here, the recent\nresearch of Agostino Paravicini-Bagliani (1991, 2000) shows that Bacon\nshared these interests with other outstanding scholars such as Peter\nof Spain (Pope John XXI). The very concept of the \u2018prolongation\nof life\u2019 so forcefully proposed by Bacon in his later works\nfound very receptive readers at the Papal Curia in Viterbo. The Papal\nCuria had by 1266 become a center for medical and scientific study.\nThe third task is that of the prognostication of the future on the\nbasis of astronomical/astrological knowledge. This section, depending\non Pseudo-Ptolemy, Centiloquiium and Abu Ma\u2019shar notes\nthat this revelatory divination is earier and more available than the\nmore complex regular astronomy that requires constant observation and\nthe skillful uses of Tables and Instruments. These are not always\nreadily available. \n\nThe conclusion to the De scientia experimentali is important.\nBacon presents the ideal of the \u201cphilosophical\nchancellor\u201dwho will organize science and its technological\nproducts for the benefit of Res publica Christiana. In this,\nhe is influenced by the important \u201cMirror of Princes\u201d from\nthe Islamic World, the Sirr-al-\u2018asrar (Secretum\nsecretorum) (OHI, V). Stewart C. Easton (1952) proposed that this\nwork was the guiding vision for Bacon\u2019s reform of science.\nWilliams (1994) has argued that Bacon completed the edition of this\nwork after his return to Oxford ca. 1280 or a few years before that\ndate. Still, there is much cross reference between this work and\nBacon\u2019s writings in Paris ca. 1266\u201371.\n\nDavid C. Lindberg (1997) has given a succinct summary of Bacon\u2019s\nmodel for an experimental science [RBS]. He sees four main aspects.\nFirst, Bacon\u2019s perspectival theories were not his own creation.\nHe took the best available materials from Greek and Islamic scholars\nand produced his own synthesis. Second, there is much evidence that\nBacon himself did mathematical work and experiments with visual\nphenomena such as pinhole images and measurement of the visual field.\nThird, as seen above, Bacon correctly calculated the maximum degree of\nelevation for the rainbow. Fourth, the experiments in Bacon,\nespecially in the Perspectiva served \u201ctheoretically\nsignificant functions\u201d by supplying observational data that\nrequired explanation in terms of a given optical theory. The usual\nrole of experiment in Bacon is to \u201cconfirm, refute, or challenge\ntheoretical claims.\u201d\n\nOne might have expected Bacon to have given equal treatment to\nastronomy, but in this field he was a child of his time. He reports on\nthe accounts of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Alfraganus (OHI, IV). He\ndiscusses the pros and cons in scholastic, but does not advance the\nfield as he did for Perspectiva. \n5.5 Opus maius/Part Seven: Moralis philosophia\n\nBacon\u2019s Moralis philosophia (= Opus maius, VII\n= RBMP) comprises the philosophy of religion, social philosophy, a\ntheory of the virtues, an astrological-sociology of religion and\ncultures, and an account of argument and rhetoric.\n\nBacon describes the object of moral inquiry as follows: \u201cThis\nscience is preeminently active, that is, operative, and deals with our\nactions in this life and the other life\u201d ([RBMP], 3). It is\nfocused on human action. Of course, many human actions deal with\nissues that are the concern of the natural and linguistic sciences.\nBacon notes that these sciences are active and operative but concerned\n\u201c\u2026with artificial and natural works which refer to the\nspeculative intellect, and they are not concerned with those things\nwhich refer to the practical intellect, which is called practical\nbecause it exercises operations of good and evil\u201d ([RBMP],\n3). These works of the human being (operabilia) are\n\u201c\u2026more difficult to know than the objects of speculative\nknowledge.\u201d These include \u201c\u2026the highest truths\nconcerning God and divine worship, eternal life, the laws of Justice,\nthe glory of peace, and the sublimity of the virtues\u201d ([RBMP],\n247). For Bacon, the human ability to deal with these topics is\naffected by a certain corruption of the human will. \n\nMoral science has two parts. The first is speculative, dealing with\nultimate moral truths. The second deals with the process of moral\npersuasion: \u201cThe practical part is related to the first part as\nthe curing of the sick and the conserving of health, which are treated\nin practical medicine, are related to that part of medicine which\nteaches what health is\u2026\u201d ([RBMP], 248).\n\nPart one deals with the object and method of morals science and with\nan outline of a philosophical anthropology based on Platonic,\nAristotelian, and Stoic texts in which Bacon argues for an Augustinian\nview of the place of human beings in the world. This includes a\nsection on metaphysical proof for God\u2019s existence. And the\nancient source texts are treated as testifying to the universal\nreligion of Christianity. Part two is a very brief outline of the\nstructure of social life, taken from Avicenna.\n\nPart three, the most substantial in the book, is concerned with virtue\nand vice. Bacon\u2019s own text for this part of the Opus\nmaius still exists and one can see his personal editorial remarks\nin the margins. He did not have time to write a formal treatise, and\nso he presents an anthology of texts from Seneca and excerpts from\nCicero with comment. This is preceded by a brief resume of Aristotle\non the virtues. But it is clear that Bacon favors the image of the\nStoic wise person as his model for virtue. Bacon places great emphasis\non magnanimity as a virtue for the Prince and Prelate. Magnanimity of\nthe greatest of the natural virtues. And it must not be confused with\nChristian humility. This distances Bacon from Bernard of Clairvaux and\nBonaventure. For Bacon, Christian humility has its own distinctive\nrole reflecting the relation of the human to the cosmos and to God.\nAbove all, Bacon is concerned with reproducing as much of the\nAristotelian and Stoic accounts of virtues as possible, and he is\nconcerned with making the Dialogues of Seneca known to Pope\nClement IV. In particular, he is most of all concerned with\nSeneca\u2019s De ira, which he regards as a fundamental text\nfor the moral instruction of princes and prelates. Certainly, Bacon,\nas he does in the Secretum secretorum, presents himself as a\nmoral advisor to Princes. \n\nPart four provides an astrological sociology of human nations or\n\u201csects\u201d, relying on the moral/political account of\nal-Farabi and on the astrological views of Abu Ma\u2019shar\n(Albumassar). Bacon had a wide knowledge of the world including the\ncustoms of the Mongols, and so he compares Mongol, Jewish, Arab, and\nPagan civilizations.\n\nPart five deals with the role of rhetoric in moral persuasion. Bacon\nis convinced that rhetoric is closely connected with logic, and\nbelieved that the university system failed by teaching only grammar\nand logic (linguistics). The omission from the university curriculum\nof rhetoric and poetics, as found in Aristotle and as interpreted by\nal-Farabi and Averroes, was in Bacon\u2019s view a mistake. He knows\nthe latest translations and remarks:\n\n\nBut al-Farabi has presented to us the meaning of this kind of\nargument, and Avicenna, al-Ghazali, and Averroes have done likewise.\nBecause of this, one ought to present an account of the nature of\npoetic argument, and it falls to logic alone to compose such\na book, since the composition of argumentation pertains to\nlogic alone\u2026The appropriate presentation of this\nargument is found in [my] Moralis philosophia, and in its\nuse, and likewise in theological proofs and doctrines; and in such\nmoral matters, this kind of argument moves a [person] much more than\ndoes a demonstrative argument since it has much greater power. And I\nhave already composed a treatise on this [rhetorical-poetic] argument\nin my works on logic, and I have shown there what is proper\nto this science. ([OHI, XVI], 16\u201317)\n\n\nHe continues and notes that according to Aristotle and al-Farabi, this\nargument makes use of appropriate language so that the self can be led\nto virtue and to overcome of vice. He then links up the Greek and\nIslamic sources with the regular sources in the Latin tradition such\nas Cicero, Seneca, and Augustine. And he distinguishes carefully\nbetween demonstrative, dialectical, and rhetorical forms of\nargument.\n5.6 Bacon\u2019s Political Philosophy: the Secretum secretorum\n\nBacon devoted considerable time to the study of this work, the Latin\ntranslation of the Arabic work on statecraft in the tradition of\nMirrors for Princes entitled Sirr-al-\u2018asrar. He worked on\nthe text at Paris and completed the edition of this text with\nintroduction and notes at Oxford after his return there from Paris c.\n1280. This is the most important text on government and the education\nof the Prince prior to the writing of The Prince by\nMachiavelli. The work is divided into four parts. Part one begins with\nthe letter of Alexander to Aristotle and deals with the king\u2019s\nmaintenance of the kingdom. It deals with virtues, largesse, and\ngifts. It is an account of the behavior expected of a King. Part two\ndeals with health care, medicine, and the origins of the sciences.\nPart three deals with alchemy and with the human emotional structure.\nPart four deals with physiognomy and anthropology. Bacon\u2019s\nintroduction is substantial, consisting of seven chapters. It is\nclosely connected with his account of astrology in Opus maius,\npart four, and with scientia experimentalis in part six. His\nsources are mostly Islamic and include the De radiis and De\naspectibus of al-Kindi and the introduction to astrology of Abu\nMa\u2019shar. Bacon proposes a kind of statistical predictive\nastrology, and so has to deal explicitly with the issue of freedom and\ndeterminism. He objects to a kind of infallibilist necessitarianism\nand thinks that provided \u201cpossibility\u201d and\n\u201ccontingency\u201d can be guarded, one can predict what can\nhappen in nature and in human society (due to the effects of the\nelements on temperament) in a general manner. Thus, the ruler will\nhave need of the astrologer who will function as a kind of doctor,\npsychologist, sociologist, and political theorist. This is a far cry\nfrom a contemplative ethics. It is significant that in the work\nentitled Errores philosophorum ascribed to Giles of Rome, a\ncontemporary of Bacon at Paris, many of Bacon\u2019s sources are\nseverely criticized. In the De regimine principium (1280s),\nGiles, unlike Bacon, provides a moral education for the prince that is\nentirely based on Greek and Latin sources, especially on\nAristotle.\n\nThe idea of secrecy and secret books associated with Roger Bacon\ncontinued into the Renaissance (Kavey 2007), with the depiction of\nRoger Bacon on stage in a drama by Robert Greene.\n6. Conclusion\n\nIt will be clear from this account that Roger Bacon was an important\nteacher of the Arts at Paris in the 1240s. He was ahead of his time in\nthe vigorous manner in which he integrated the new Aristotle with the\ntraditional Latin traditions of grammar and logic. He taught for a\nlong period in the Arts. He later called himself an expert in the\nphilosophy of Aristotle as interpreted by Avicenna and Averroes. And\nwe should also add Avicebron (Solomon Ibn Gabirol). By 1248\u201349 he\nseems to have become an independent scholar. He then, it would seem,\nreturned to England, where, under the influence of Adam Marsh, friend\nof Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, he was attracted to\ninterests associated with both scholars: language study including the\nlearning of ancient languages, experimental concerns such as optics\nand experimental science, and a renewed critical study of the text of\nScripture. When Bacon returned to Paris in the 1250s, he was to oppose\nwhat had become a profound change in the methodology of university\nlearning, that is, the introduction of the\n\u201cSentence-Method\u201d into the study of theology. For Bacon,\nthis was a destruction of practices that he associated with Robert\nGrosseteste. Taking up the flag of the Bishop of Lincoln (d. 1253), he\nbecame the great critic of the Parisian mode of doing philosophy and\ntheology. As we saw above, Bacon was already by 1266 very concerned\nwith the new heterodox interpretations of Aristotle found in the\nFaculty of Arts. His later works for Pope Clement IV must be read in\nthe context of the Parisian debates on Latin Averroism\n(1266\u20131277).\n\nThe later Roger Bacon has a good knowledge of the geography and\nhistory of the world and an awareness of geo-politics. In this\ncontext, he devoted much time to the important work on the education\nof the Prince, the Secretum secretorum. He may have returned to\nOxford c. 1280, if not before. There, he completed his edition, with\nnotes and introduction, of this work. In his last work, the\nCompendium studii theologiae (c. 1292), he repeats some of the\nmain arguments from the 1260s against Richard Rufus of Cornwall. Roger\nBacon sets out themes in his philosophy of language, philosophy of\nnature, and moral philosophy and theology that would influence\nfourteenth century writers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham,\namong others. Jeremiah Hackett examines the influence of Roger Bacon\non the philosophy of mind in John Pecham (Hackett 2018c).\nBacon\u2019s influence on the fourteenth century has been documented\nby Katherine H. Tachau (1988). He is much more important for the\nphilosophy of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries than has\nhitherto been recognized. The editors of Peter of John Olivi on matter\nhave noted the appropriation by Olivi of Bacon\u2019s teaching on\nmatter. Doninique Demange and Yael Kedar have demonstrated Peter John\nOlivi\u2019s critical appropriation of Bacon\u2019s theory of Vision\nand his natural philosophy (Demange & Kedar, 2020). Jeremiah\nHackett (2018a) has suggested that in the early to mid-1260s, Olivi\nmay have been the Iuvenis Johannes, Bacon\u2019s star student.\nRecently, Mattia Montovani has written a very important study on the\nimportance of Bacon\u2019s theory of vision for the new Cartesian\ndiscussions of vision in the early 17th century. It is a study of\nmajor significance for the influence of Bacon on early modern\nphilosophy. (Montovani 2020) As noted above, the newly formed\nRoger Bacon Research Society will in the near future do much\nto further the study of the scientific, philosophical and theological\nworks of Roger Bacon.
