The measurement of most psychological attributes, such as\nintelligence, anxiety and depression, does not rely on homomorphic\nmappings of the sort espoused by the Representational Theory of\nMeasurement (Wilson 2013: 3766). Instead, psychometric theory relies\npredominantly on the development of abstract models that are meant to\npredict subjects\u2019 performance in certain tasks. These models are\nconstructed from substantive and statistical assumptions about the\npsychological attribute being measured and its relation to each\nmeasurement task. For example, Item Response Theory, a popular\napproach to psychological measurement, employs a variety of models to\nevaluate the reliability and validity of questionnaires. Consider a\nquestionnaire that is meant to assess English language comprehension\n(the \u201cability\u201d), by presenting subjects with a series of\nyes/no questions (the \u201citems\u201d). One of the simplest models\nused to calibrate such questionnaires is the Rasch model (Rasch 1960).\nThis model supposes a straightforward algebraic relation\u2014known\nas the \u201clog of the odds\u201d\u2014between the probability\nthat a subject will answer a given item correctly, the difficulty of\nthat particular item, and the subject\u2019s ability. New\nquestionnaires are calibrated by testing the fit between their\nindications and the predictions of the Rasch model and assigning\ndifficulty levels to each item accordingly. The model is then used in\nconjunction with the questionnaire to infer levels of English language\ncomprehension (outcomes) from raw questionnaire scores (indications)\n(Wilson 2013; Mari and Wilson 2014).\n\nThe sort of statistical calibration (or \u201cscaling\u201d)\nprovided by Rasch models yields repeatable results, but it is often\nonly a first step towards full-fledged psychological measurement.\nPsychologists are typically interested in the results of a measure not\nfor its own sake, but for the sake of assessing some underlying and\nlatent psychological attribute, e.g., English language comprehension.\nA good fit between item responses and a statistical model does not yet\ndetermine what the questionnaire is measuring. The process of\nestablishing that a procedure measures the intended psychological\nattribute is known as \u201cvalidation\u201d. One way of validating\na psychometric instrument is to test whether different procedures that\nare intended to measure the same latent attribute provide consistent\nresults. Such testing belongs to a family of validation techniques\nknown as \u201cconstruct validation\u201d. A construct is an\nabstract representation of the latent attribute intended to be\nmeasured, and \n\n\nreflects a hypothesis [\u2026] that a variety of behaviors will\ncorrelate with one another in studies of individual differences and/or\nwill be similarly affected by experimental manipulations. (Nunnally\n& Bernstein 1994: 85) \n\n\nConstructs are denoted by variables in a model that predicts which\ncorrelations would be observed among the indications of different\nmeasures if they are indeed measures of the same attribute. Such\nmodels involve substantive assumptions about the attribute, including\nits internal structure and its relations to other attributes, and\nstatistical assumptions about the correlation among different measures\n(Campbell & Fiske 1959; Nunnally & Bernstein 1994: Ch. 3;\nAngner 2008).\n\nIn recent years, philosophers of science have become increasingly\ninterested in psychometrics and the concept of validity. One debate\nconcerns the ontological status of latent psychological attributes.\nDenny Borsboom has argued against operationalism about latent\nattributes, and in favour of defining validity in a manner that\nembraces realism: \u201ca test is valid for measuring an attribute if\nand only if a) the attribute exists, and b) variations in the\nattribute causally produce variations in the outcomes of the\nmeasurement procedure\u201d (2005: 150; see also Hood 2009, 2013;\nFeest 2020). Elina Vessonen has defended a moderate form of\noperationalism about psychological attributes, and argued that\nmoderate operationalism is compatible with a cautious type of realism\n(2019). Another recent discussion focuses on the justification for\nconstruct validation procedures. According to Anna Alexandrova,\nconstruct validation is in principle a justified methodology, insofar\nas it establishes coherence with theoretical assumptions and\nbackground knowledge about the latent attribute. However, Alexandrova\nnotes that in practice psychometricians who intend to measure\nhappiness and well-being often avoid theorizing about these\nconstructs, and instead appeal to respondents\u2019 folk beliefs.\nThis defeats the purpose of construct validation and turns it into a\nnarrow, technical exercise (Alexandrova and Haybron 2016; Alexandrova\n2017; see also McClimans et al. 2017).\n\nA more fundamental criticism leveled against psychometrics is that it\ndogmatically presupposes that psychological attributes can be\nquantified. Michell (2000, 2004b) argues that psychometricians have\nnot made serious attempts to test whether the attributes they purport\nto measure have quantitative structure, and instead adopted an overly\nloose conception of measurement that disguises this neglect. In\nresponse, Borsboom and Mellenbergh (2004) argue that Item Response\nTheory provides probabilistic tests of the quantifiability of\nattributes. Psychometricians who construct a statistical model\ninitially hypothesize that an attribute is quantitative, and then\nsubject the model to empirical tests. When successful, such tests\nprovide indirect confirmation of the initial hypothesis, e.g. by\nshowing that the attribute has an additive conjoint structure (see\nalso Vessonen 2020).\n\nSeveral scholars have pointed out similarities between the ways models\nare used to standardize measurable quantities in the natural and\nsocial sciences. For example, Mark Wilson (2013) argues that\npsychometric models can be viewed as tools for constructing\nmeasurement standards in the same sense of \u201cmeasurement\nstandard\u201d used by metrologists. Others have raised doubts about\nthe feasibility and desirability of adopting the example of the\nnatural sciences when standardizing constructs in the social sciences.\nNancy Cartwright and Rosa Runhardt (2014) discuss\n\u201cBallung\u201d concepts, a term they borrow from Otto Neurath\nto denote concepts with a fuzzy and context-dependent scope. Examples\nof Ballung concepts are race, poverty, social exclusion, and the\nquality of PhD programs. Such concepts are too multifaceted to be\nmeasured on a single metric without loss of meaning, and must be\nrepresented either by a matrix of indices or by several different\nmeasures depending on which goals and values are at play (see also\nBradburn, Cartwright, & Fuller 2016, Other Internet Resources).\nAlexandrova (2008) points out that ethical considerations bear on\nquestions about the validity of measures of well-being no less than\nconsiderations of reproducibility. Such ethical considerations are\ncontext sensitive, and can only be applied piecemeal. In a similar\nvein, Leah McClimans (2010) argues that uniformity is not always an\nappropriate goal for designing questionnaires, as the open-endedness\nof questions is often both unavoidable and desirable for obtaining\nrelevant information from\n subjects.[20]\n The intertwining of ethical and epistemic considerations is\nespecially clear when psychometric questionnaires are used in medical\ncontexts to evaluate patient well-being and mental health. In such\ncases, small changes to the design of a questionnaire or the analysis\nof its results may result in significant harms or benefits to patients\n(McClimans 2017; Stegenga 2018, Chap. 8). These insights highlight the\nvalue-laden and contextual nature of the measurement of mental and\nsocial phenomena.\n",
