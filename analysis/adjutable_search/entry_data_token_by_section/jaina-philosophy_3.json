This is due to the fact that Jaina practices aim at the\npractitioner\u2019s liberation from wrong conceptions\n(mithy\u0101tva). In the Treatise on What There Is,\nthe self is defined in the following way:\n\n\nTS 2.8. The defining characteristic of the self is experience\n(upayoga).\n\n\n\nThis definition is further commented in the Commentary on the\nTreatise on What There Is\n(Tattv\u0101rthas\u016btrabh\u0101\u1e63ya [TSBh]), written\nin Sanskrit by Um\u0101sv\u0101ti (400\u2013450 CE), by dividing this\nexperience into cognition (j\u00f1\u0101na) and\nindeterminate perception (dar\u015bana) (TSBh 2.9.1).\n\nThis stress on epistemic abilities is not typical of Jainism. Indeed,\nin most South Asian philosophico-religious traditions, the divine, the\nabsolute, is usually primarily knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na),\nconsciousness (cit), insight (praj\u00f1\u0101),\nthe subject of experience (puru\u1e63a) or the seer\n(dra\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b). Therefore, Jaina conceptions of\nthe self (\u0101tman, j\u012bva) as ultimately\nunobstructed consciousness are no exception here.\n\nNor is the fact that our spiritual progress consists in a progress\nwhich is virtuous and epistemic at the same time. To explain, karma is\nin Jainism conceived as a subtle type of matter that fills all cosmic\nspace. Its specific property is to develop the consequences of our\nvirtuous, respectively unethical, acts. And then, due to passions\nwhich act as a glue, karmic matter sticks to the self and obstructs\nits potency. Let us think of someone\u2019s reflection in a mirror as\na type of expression of herself. Now, imagine that the mirror is red,\nwith the pun that the Sanskrit expression\n\u201cr\u0101ga\u201d means both \u201cred object\u201d\nand \u201cattachment, passion.\u201d In such a situation, the person\nwill have a red, therefore distorted, vision of herself. Jaina\nthinkers teach us that karmic matter function likewise, it has the\nshape of one\u2019s impetus towards objects and, doing so, it impedes\none\u2019s epistemic competence, as she approaches things as part of\na given limited project she has. From this, getting rid of specific\nintentions, acting in an equanimous virtuous way is also burning karma\nis also acquiring the means to see things in a less distorted way.\nThat is to say things as they are instead of things as I\nintend them to be. This is this removal of wrong habits that\nenables right knowledge and right sight to take place, and that\nexplains that the acquisition of higher faculties of knowledge is\nensured by renunciation from passions and the corresponding\ndestruction of karmic bondage.\n\nIn general, within a framework that admits the karma theory:\n\nThe acquisition of higher epistemic abilities is ensured by moral\nbehavior and the corresponding destruction of karma. In this dynamic,\ntheories of karma blur the distinction between epistemology and\nsoteriology.\nMetaphysical investigations focus on the world qua\nknowable. For example, Jainas derive the expression\n\u201cloka\u201d, \u201cthe universe\u201d, not from the\nSanskrit etymology \u201copen space\u201d, but from the root\n\u201clok-\u201d, \u201cto see\u201d, inasmuch as the\nuniverse is conceived as \u201cthat which is seen by the omniscient\none\u201d (Dundas 2002). In general, theories of karma blur the\ndistinction between epistemology and metaphysics.\nEven a clod of earth exists as earth because it has\nearned its particular niche in the wider system of life processes due\nto its previous deeds. In consequence, the world of nature cannot be\nseparated from the moral order. In general, theories of karma blur the\ndistinction between metaphysics and soteriology.\n\n",
