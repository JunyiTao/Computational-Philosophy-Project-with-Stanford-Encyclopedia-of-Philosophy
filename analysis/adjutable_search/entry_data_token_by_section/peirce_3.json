    "main_text": "Pragmatism, Pragmaticism, and the Scientific Method\n4. Pragmatism, Pragmaticism, and the Scientific Method\n\n\nProbably Peirce\u2019s best-known works are the first two articles in a\nseries of six that originally were collectively entitled\nIllustrations of the Logic of Science and published in\nPopular Science Monthly from November 1877 through August\n1878. The first is entitled \u201cThe Fixation of Belief\u201d and\nthe second is entitled \u201cHow to Make Our Ideas Clear.\u201d In\nthe first of these papers Peirce defended, in a manner consistent with\nnot accepting naive realism, the superiority of the scientific method\nover other methods of overcoming doubt and \u201cfixing\nbelief.\u201d In the second of these papers Peirce defended a\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d notion of clear concepts.\n\n\nPerhaps the single most important fact to keep in mind in trying to\nunderstand Peirce\u2019s philosophy concerning clarity and the proper\nmethod of fixing belief is that all his life Peirce was a practicing\nphysical scientist: already mentioned is the fact that he worked as a\nphysical scientist for 32 years in his job with the United States\nCoast and Geodetic Survey. As Peirce understood the topics of\nphilosophy and logic, philosophy and logic were themselves also\nsciences, although not physical sciences.  Moreover, he understood\nphilosophy to be the philosophy of science, and he understood logic to\nbe the logic of science (where the word \u201cscience\u201d has a\nsense that is best captured by the German\nword Wissenschaft).\n\n\nIt is in this light that his specifications of the nature of\npragmatism are to be understood. It is also in this light that his\nlater calling of his views \u201cpragmaticism,\u201d in order to\ndistinguish his own scientific philosophy from other conceptions and\ntheories that were trafficked under the title\n\u201cpragmatism,\u201d is to be understood. When he said that the\nwhole meaning of a (clear) conception consists in the entire set of\nits practical consequences, he had in mind that a meaningful\nconception must have some sort of experiential \u201ccash\nvalue,\u201d must somehow be capable of being related to some sort of\ncollection of possible empirical observations under specifiable\nconditions. Peirce insisted that the entire meaning of a meaningful\nconception consisted in the totality of such specifications of\npossible observations. For example, Peirce tended to spell out the\nmeaning of dispositional properties such as \u201chard\u201d or\n\u201cheavy\u201d by using the same sort of counterfactual\nconstructions as, say, Karl Hempel would use. Peirce was not a simple\noperationalist in his philosophy of science; nor was he a simple\nverificationist in his epistemology: he believed in the reality of\nabstractions, and in many ways his thinking about universals resembles\nthat of the medieval realists in metaphysics. Nevertheless, despite\nhis metaphysical leanings, Peirce\u2019s views bear a strong family\nresemblance to operationalism and verificationism.  In regard to\nphysical concepts in particular, his views are quite close to those\nof, say, Einstein, who held that the whole meaning of a physical\nconcept is determined by an exact method of measuring it.\n\n\nThe previous point must be tempered with the fact that Peirce\nincreasingly became a philosopher with broad and deep sympathies for\nboth transcendental idealism and absolute idealism. His Kantian\naffinities are simpler and easier to understand than his Hegelian\nleanings. Having rejected a great deal in Kant, Peirce nevertheless\nshared with Charles Renouvier the view that Kant\u2019s (quasi-)concept of\nthe Ding an sich can play no role whatsoever in philosophy or\nin science other than the role that Kant ultimately assigned to it,\nviz. the role of a Grenzbegriff: a boundary-concept, or,\nperhaps a bit more accurately, a limiting concept. A supposed\n\u201creality\u201d that is \u201coutside\u201d of every logical\npossibility of empirical or logical interaction with \u201cit\u201d\ncan play no direct role in the sciences. Science can deal only with\nphenomena, that is to say, only with what can \u201cappear\u201d\nsomehow in experience. All scientific concepts must somehow be\ntraceable back to phenomenological roots. Thus, even when Peirce calls\nhimself a \u201crealist\u201d or is called by others a\n\u201crealist,\u201d it must be kept in mind that Peirce was always\na realist of the Kantian \u201cempirical\u201d sort and not a\nKantian \u201ctranscendental realist.\u201d His realism is similar\nto what Hilary Putnam has called \u201cinternal realism.\u201d (As\nwas said, Peirce was also a realist in quite another sense of he word:\nhe was a realist or an anti-nominalist in the medieval sense.)\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s Hegelianism, to which he increasingly admitted as he\napproached his most mature philosophy, is more difficult to understand\nthan his Kantianism, partly because it is everywhere intimately tied\nto his entire late theory of signs (semeiotic) and sign use\n(semeiosis), as well as to his evolutionism and to his rather puzzling\ndoctrine of mind.  There are at least four major components of his\nHegelian idealism.  First, for Peirce the world of appearances, which\nhe calls \u201cthe phaneron,\u201d is a world consisting entirely of\nsigns. Signs are qualities, relations, features, items, events,\nstates, regularities, habits, laws, and so on that have meanings,\nsignificances, or interpretations. Second, a sign is one term in a\nthreesome of terms that are indissolubly connected with each other by\na crucial triadic relation that Peirce calls \u201cthe sign\nrelation.\u201d The sign itself (also called the representamen) is\nthe term in the sign relation that is ordinarily said to represent or\nmean something.  The other two terms in this relation are called the\nobject and the interpretant.  The object is what would ordinarily\nwould be said to be the \u201cthing\u201d meant or signified or\nrepresented by the sign, what the sign is a sign\nof. The interpretant of a sign is said by Peirce to be that\nto which the sign represents the object. What exactly Peirce\nmeans by the interpretant is difficult to pin down. It is something\nlike a mind, a mental act, a mental state, or a feature or quality of\nmind; at all events the interpretant is something ineliminably\nmental. Third, the interpretant of a sign, by virtue of the very\ndefinition Peirce gives of the sign-relation, must itself be a sign,\nand a sign moreover of the very same object that is (or: was)\nrepresented by the (original) sign. In effect, then, the interpretant\nis a second signifier of the object, only one that now has an overtly\nmental status. But, merely in being a sign of the original object,\nthis second sign must itself have (Peirce uses the word\n\u201cdetermine\u201d) an interpretant, which then in turn is a new,\nthird sign of the object, and again is one with an overtly mental\nstatus. And so on. Thus, if there is any sign at all of any object,\nthen there is an infinite sequence of signs of that same object. So,\neverything in the phaneron, because it is a sign, begins an infinite\nsequence of mental interpretants of an object.\n\n\nBut now, there is a fourth component of Peirce\u2019s idealism: Peirce\nmakes everything in the phaneron evolutionary. The whole system\nevolves. Three figures from the history of culture loomed exceedingly\nlarge in the intellectual development of Peirce and in the cultural\natmosphere of the period in which Peirce was most active: Hegel in\nphilosophy, Lyell in geology, and Darwin (along with Alfred Russel\nWallace) in biology. These thinkers, of course, all have a single\ntheme in common: evolution. Hegel described an evolution of ideas,\nLyell an evolution of geological structures, and Darwin an evolution\nof biological species and varieties. Peirce absorbed it all.  Peirce\u2019s\nentire thinking, early on and later, is permeated with the\nevolutionary idea, which he extended generally, that is to say, beyond\nthe confines of any particular subject matter. For Peirce, the entire\nuniverse and everything in it is an evolutionary product. Indeed, he\nconceived that even the most firmly entrenched of nature\u2019s habits (for\nexample, even those habits that are typically called \u201cnatural\nlaws\u201d) have themselves evolved, and accordingly can and should\nbe subjects of philosophical and scientific inquiry. One can sensibly\nseek, in Peirce\u2019s view, evolutionary explanations of the existence of\nparticular natural laws.  For Peirce, then, the entire phaneron (the\nworld of appearances), as well as all the ongoing processes of its\ninterpretation through mental significations, has evolved and is\nevolving.\n\n\nNow, no one familiar with Hegel can escape the obvious comparison: we\nhave in Peirce an essentially idealist theory that is similar to the\nidealism that Hegel puts forward in the Phaenomenologie des\nGeistes. Furthermore, both Hegel and Peirce make the whole\nevolutionary interpretation of the evolving phaneron to be a process\nthat is said to be logical, the \u201caction\u201d of logic\nitself. Of course there are differences between the two\nphilosophers. For example, what exactly Hegel\u2019s logic is has been\nshrouded in mystery for every Hegelian after Hegel himself (and some\nphilosophers, for example Popper, would say for every Hegelian\nincluding Hegel). By contrast Peirce\u2019s logic is reasonably clear, and\nhe takes great pains to work it out in intricate detail; basically\nPeirce\u2019s logic is the whole logical apparatus of the physical and\nsocial sciences.\n\n\nOne implication of the unending nature of the interpretation of\nappearances through infinite sequences of signs is that Peirce cannot\nbe any type of epistemological foundationalist or believer in absolute\nor apodeictic knowledge. He must be, and is, an anti-foundationalist\nand a fallibilist.  From his earliest to his latest writings Peirce\nopposed and attacked all forms of epistemological foundationalism and\nin particular all forms of Cartesianism and a\npriorism. Philosophy must begin wherever it happens to be at the\nmoment, he thought, and not at some supposed ideal foundation,\nespecially not in some world of \u201cprivate references.\u201d The\nonly important thing in thinking scientifically to apply the\nscientific method itself. This method he held to be essentially public\nand reproducible in its activities, as well as self-correcting in the\nfollowing sense: No matter where different researchers may begin, as\nlong as they follow the scientific method, their results will\neventually converge toward the same outcome. (The pragmatic, or\npragmaticistic, conception of meaning implies that two theories with\nexactly the same empirical content must have, despite superficial\nappearances, the same meaning.)  This ideal point of convergence is\nwhat Peirce means by \u201cthe truth,\u201d and\n\u201creality\u201d is simply what is meant by \u201cthe\ntruth.\u201d That these Peircean notions of reality and truth are\ninherently idealist rather than naively realist in character should\nrequire no special pleading.\n\n\nConnected with Peirce\u2019s anti-foundationalism is his insistence on the\nfallibility of particular achievements in science. Although the\nscientific method will eventually converge to something as a limit,\nnevertheless at any temporal point in the process of scientific\ninquiry we are only at a provisional stage of it and cannot ascertain\nhow far off we may be from the limit to which we are somehow\nconverging. This insistence on the fallibilism of human inquiry is\nconnected with several other important themes of Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophy. His evolutionism has already been discussed: fallibilism\nis obviously connected with the fact that science is not shooting at a\nfixed target but rather one that is always moving. What Peirce calls\nhis \u201ctychism,\u201d which is his anti-deterministic insistence\nthat there is objective chance in the world, is also intimately\nconnected to his fallibilism. (Tychism will be discussed below.)\nDespite Peirce\u2019s insistence on fallibilism, he is far from being an\nepistemological pessimist or sceptic: indeed, he is quite the\nopposite. He tends to hold that every genuine question (that is, every\nquestion whose possible answers have empirical content) can be\nanswered in principle, or at least should not be assumed to be\nunanswerable. For this reason, one his most important dicta, which he\ncalled his first principle of reason, is \u201cDo not block the way\nof inquiry!\u201d\n\n\nFor Peirce, as we saw, the scientific method involves three phases or\nstages: abduction (making conjectures or creating hypotheses),\ndeduction (inferring what should be the case if the hypotheses are the\ncase), and induction (the testing of hypotheses). The process of going\nthrough the stages should also be carried out with concern for the\neconomy of research. Peirce\u2019s understanding of scientific method,\nthen, is not very different from today\u2019s idea of scientific\nmethod which, seems to have been derived historically both from\nWilliam Whewell and Peirce (see Niiniluoto 1984, 18; Ambrosio 2016;\nand Wagenmakers, Dutilh, & Sarafoglou 2018, 423). Today\u2019s\nunderstanding sees the scientific method as the method of constructing\nhypotheses, deriving consequences from these hypotheses, and then\nexperimentally testing these hypotheses (guided always by the\neconomics of research). Also, as was said above, Peirce increasingly\ncame to understand his three types of logical inference as being\nphases or stages of the scientific method. For example, as Peirce came\nto extend and generalize his notion of abduction, abduction became\ndefined as inference to and provisional acceptance of an explanatory\nhypothesis for the purpose of testing it. Abduction is not always\ninference to the best explanation, but it is always inference to some\nexplanation or at least to something that clarifies or makes routine\nsome information that has previously been \u201csurprising,\u201d in\nthe sense that we would not have routinely expected it, given our\nthen-current state of knowledge. Deduction came to mean for Peirce the\ndrawing of conclusions as to what observable phenomena should be\nexpected if the hypothesis is correct. Induction came for him to mean\nthe entire process of experimentation and interpretation performed in\nthe service of hypothesis testing.\n\n\nA few further comments are perhaps in order in connection with\nPeirce\u2019s idea of the economy (or: the economics) of research. Concern\nfor the economy of research is a crucial and ineliminable part of\nPeirce\u2019s idea of the scientific method. He understood that science is\nessentially a human and social enterprise and that it always operates\nin some given historical, social, and economic context.  In such a\ncontext some problems are crucial and paramount and must be\nattended-to immediately, while other problems are trivial or frivolous\nor at least can be put off until later. He understood that in the real\ncontext of science some experiments may be vitally important while\nothers may be insignificant. Peirce also understood that the economic\nresources of the scientist (time, money, ability to exert effort,\netc.) are always scarce, even though all the while the \u201cgreat\nocean of truth,\u201d which lies undiscovered before us, is\ninfinite. All resources for carrying out research, such as personnel,\nperson-hours, and apparatus, are quite costly; accordingly, it is\nwasteful, indeed irrational, to squander them. Peirce proposed,\ntherefore, that careful consideration be paid to the problem of how to\nobtain the biggest epistemological \u201cbang for the buck.\u201d In\neffect, the economics of research is a cost/benefit analysis in\nconnection with states of knowledge. Although this idea has been\ninsufficiently explored by Peirce scholars, Peirce himself regarded it\nas central to the scientific method and to the idea of rational\nbehavior.  It is connected with what he called \u201cspeculative\nrhetoric\u201d or \u201cmethodeutic\u201d (which will be discussed\nbelow).\n",
