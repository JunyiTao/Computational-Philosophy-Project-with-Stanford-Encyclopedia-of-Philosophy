    "main_text": "Some varieties of definition\n1. Some varieties of definition\n\nOrdinary discourse recognizes several different kinds of things as\npossible objects of definition, and it recognizes several kinds of\nactivity as defining a thing. To give a few examples, we speak of a\ncommission as defining the boundary between two nations; of the\nSupreme Court as defining, through its rulings, \u201cperson\u201d\nand \u201ccitizen\u201d; of a chemist as discovering the definition\nof gold, and the lexicographer, that of \u2018cool\u2019; of a\nparticipant in a debate as defining the point at issue; and of a\nmathematician as laying down the definition of \u201cgroup.\u201d\nDifferent kinds of things are objects of definition here: boundary,\nlegal status, substance, word, thesis, and abstract kind. Moreover,\nthe different definitions do not all have the same goal: the boundary\ncommission may aim to achieve precision; the Supreme Court, fairness;\nthe chemist and the lexicographer, accuracy; the debater, clarity; and\nthe mathematician, fecundity. The standards by which definitions are\njudged are thus liable to vary from case to case. The different\ndefinitions can perhaps be subsumed under the Aristotelian formula\nthat a definition gives the essence of a thing. But this only\nhighlights the fact that \u201cto give the essence of a thing\u201d\nis not a unitary kind of activity.\n\nIn philosophy, too, several different kinds of definitions are often\nin play, and definitions can serve a variety of different functions\n(e.g., to enhance precision and clarity). But, in philosophy,\ndefinitions have also been called in to serve a highly distinctive\nrole: that of solving epistemological problems. For example, the\nepistemological status of mathematical truths raises a problem.\nImmanuel Kant thought that these truths are synthetic a\npriori, and to account for their status, he offered a theory of\nspace and time\u2014namely, of space and time as forms of,\nrespectively, outer and inner sense. Gottlob Frege and Bertrand\nRussell sought to undermine Kant\u2019s theory by arguing that\narithmetical truths are analytic. More precisely, they attempted to\nconstruct a derivation of arithmetical principles from definitions of\narithmetical concepts, using only logical laws. For the Frege-Russell\nproject to succeed, the definitions used must have a special\ncharacter. They must be conceptual or explicative of meaning; they\ncannot be synthetic. It is this kind of definition that has aroused,\nover the past century or so, the most interest and the most\ncontroversy. And it is this kind of definition that will be our\nprimary concern. Let us begin by marking some preliminary but\nimportant distinctions.\n",
