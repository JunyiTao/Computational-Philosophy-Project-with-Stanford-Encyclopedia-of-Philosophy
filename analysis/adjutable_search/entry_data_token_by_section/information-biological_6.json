    "main_text": "Genetic programs\n7. Genetic programs\nTalk of genetic \u201cprograms\u201d is common both in popular\npresentations of biology, and in biology itself. Often, the idea is\njust a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the\norderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of\ndevelopment. In its overall results, development is astonishingly\nstable and predictable, despite the extraordinary complexity of\nintracellular and intercellular interactions, and despite the fact\nthat the physical context in which development takes place can never\nbe precisely controlled. So when biologists speak, for example, of\n\u201cprogrammed cell death\u201d, they could just as well say that\nin an important class of cases, cell death is predictable, organised,\nand adaptive.\nThere are attempts to draw closer and more instructive parallels\nbetween computational systems and biological development. In\nparticular, Roger Sansom has made a sustained and detailed attempt to\ndevelop close and instructive parallels between biological development\nand connectionist computational models (Sansom 2008b,a, 2011). This\nview has the merit of recognising that there is no central control of\ndevelopment; organisms develop as a result of local interactions\nwithin and between cells. However, the most promising ideas about\nprogram-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an\napparently close analogy between processes within cells, and\nthe low-level operation of modern computers. One crucial kind\nof causal process within cells is cascades of up and down-regulation\nin genetic networks. One gene will make a product that binds to and\nhence down-regulates another gene, which is then prevented from making\na product that up-regulates another\u2026 and so on. What we have\nhere is a cascade of events that can often be described in terms of\nBoolean relationships between variables. One event might only follow\nfrom the conjunction of another two, or from a disjunction of\nthem. Down-regulation is a kind of negation, and there can be double\nand triple negations in a network. Gene regulation networks often have\na rich enough structure of this kind for it to be useful to think of\nthem as engaged in a kind of computation. Computer chip\n\u201cand-gates\u201d, neural \u201cand-gates\u201d and genetic\n\u201cand-gates\u201d have genuine similarities.\nWhile talking of signalling networks rather than programs, Brett\nCalcott has shown that positional information in the developing\nfruitfly embryo depends on this kind of Boolean structure, with limb\nbud development depending on the cells that differentiate into limb\nbuds integrating one positive with two negative signals, so the buds\ndevelop in a regular pattern on the anterior midline of the embryo.\nCalcott shows that thinking of development in terms of these\nsignalling networks with their Boolean structures has real explanatory\nvalue, for it enables us to explain how positional information, for\nexample, can easily be reused in evolution. Wing spots on fruitflies\ncan evolve very easily, for the networks that tell cells where they\nare on the wing already exist, so the evolution of the wingspot just\nneed a simple mutational change that links that positional information\nto pigment production (Calcott 2014). Ron Planer agrees that gene\nregulation has this Boolean structure, and that we can, in effect,\nrepresent each gene as instantiating a conditional instruction. The\n\u201cif\u201d part of the conditional specifies the molecular\nconditions which turn the gene on; the \u201cthen\u201d part of the\nconditional specifies the amino acid sequence made from the gene. As\nwith Calcott, Planer goes on to point out that these conditional\ninstructions can be and often are, linked together to build complex\nnetworks of control. Even so, Planer argues that while these are\nsignalling networks, they should not be thought of as computer\nprograms. For example, the combinations of instructions have no intrinsic order; we\ncan represent each of the genes as a specific conditional instruction,\nbut there is nothing in the set of instructions itself that tells us\nwhere to begin and end (Planer 2014).\n",
