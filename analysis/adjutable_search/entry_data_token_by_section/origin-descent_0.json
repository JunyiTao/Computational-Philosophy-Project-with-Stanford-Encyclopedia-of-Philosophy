    "main_text": "The Origins of Darwin\u2019s Theory || Historiographical Issues\n1.1 Historiographical Issues\n\nCharles Darwin\u2019s version of transformism has been the subject of\nmassive historical and philosophical scholarship almost unparalleled\nin any other area of the history of science. This includes the\ncontinued flow of monographic studies and collections of articles on\naspects of Darwin\u2019s theory (Richards and Ruse 2016; Ruse 2013a,\n2009a,b, 2008; Ruse & Richards 2008; Hodge & Radick 2003\n[2009]; H\u00f6sle & Illies [eds] 2005; Gayon 1998; Bowler 1996;\nDepew & Weber 1995; Kohn 1985a). The continuous production of\npopular and professional biographical studies on Darwin provide ever\nnew insights (Ruse et al.  2013a; Johnson 2012; Desmond & Moore\n1991, 2009; Browne 1995, 2002; Bowlby 1990; Bowler 1990). In addition,\nmajor editing projects on Darwin\u2019s manuscripts and\nCorrespondence, now completed through 1878, continue to reveal details\nand new insights into the issues surrounding Darwin\u2019s own\nthought (Keynes [ed.] 2000; Burkhardt et al. [eds] 1985\u2013; Darwin\n1836\u20131844 [1987]). The Cambridge Darwin Online website (see Other Internet Resources) serves as an international\nclearinghouse for this worldwide Darwinian scholarship.\n\nA long tradition of scholarship has interpreted Darwin\u2019s theory\nto have originated from a framework defined by endemic British natural\nhistory, a British tradition of natural theology defined particularly\nby William Paley (1743\u20131805), the methodological precepts of\nJohn Herschel (1792\u20131871), and the geological theories of\nCharles Lyell (1797\u20131875). His conversion to the uniformitarian\ngeology of Charles Lyell and to Lyell\u2019s thesis of gradual change\nover time during the voyage of the HMS Beagle (December\n1831\u2013October 1836) has been seen as fundamental in his formation\n(Norman 2013; Herbert 2005; Hodge 1983a). Complementing this\npredominantly anglophone historiography has been the\nsocial-constructivist analyses emphasizing the origins of\nDarwin\u2019s theories in British Political Economy (Young, 1985:\nchps. 2, 4, 5). Recently, it has been argued that a primary generating\nsource of Darwin\u2019s inquiries was his involvement with the\nBritish anti-slavery movement, a concern reaching back to his\nrevulsion against slavery developed during the Beagle years\n(Desmond & Moore 2009).\n\nA strain of revisionist historiography, on the other hand, has\nde-emphasized some of the novelty of Darwin\u2019s views; questions\nhave been raised regarding the validity of the standard biographical\npicture of the early Darwin; new emphasis has been placed on\nDarwin\u2019s relations to the German Romantic movement, to British\nand Scottish medical developments, and to his early formation in\nScottish science and philosophy (R.J. Richards 1999, 2002; Desmond\n1989; Manier 1978). Such revisions to a long-standing historiography\nin the understanding of the genesis of Darwinian theory are indebted\nto the wealth of manuscripts and correspondence that have become\navailable since the 1960s and which are now electronically accessible\nat the Darwin Online \u201cPapers and Manuscripts\u201d section (see\nOther Internet Resources).\n\nThese materials have drawn attention to previously ignored aspects of\nDarwin\u2019s biography. In particular, the importance of his\nEdinburgh period from 1825\u201327, largely discounted in importance\nby Darwin himself in his late Autobiography, has been seen as\ncritical for his subsequent development (Desmond & Moore 1991;\nHodge 1985). As a young medical student at the University of Edinburgh\n(1825\u201327), Darwin developed a close relationship with the\ncomparative anatomist Robert Edmond Grant (1793\u20131874) through\nthe student Plinian Society, and in many respects Grant served as\nDarwin\u2019s first mentor in science in the pre-Beagle\nyears (Desmond & Moore 1991, chp. 1). Through Grant he was exposed\nto the transformist theories of Jean Baptiste Lamarck and the\nCuvier-Geoffroy debate centered on the Paris Mus\u00e9um\nnationale d\u2019histoire naturelle (see entry on \nevolutionary thought before Darwin,\nSection 4). This Scottish period also developed in Darwin an abiding\ninterest in invertebrate zoology that would later emerge in full in\nhis important work on the barnacles (Stott 2004; Love 2002; Sloan\n1985).\n\nSimilarly, there has been a new appreciation of the importance of\nDarwin\u2019s work in physiological botany and entomology during his\nstudies in Cambridge from 1827\u201331 under the guidance of his\nmentor John Stevens Henslow (1795\u20131861), who exposed him to the\nphysiological botany of Swiss botanist Alphonse De Candolle\n(1806\u201393). Through Henslow he was also led to the writings of\nJohn Herschel, Alexander von Humboldt (1769\u20131859), and Charles\nLyell. Deeper understanding is now possible concerning Darwin\u2019s\nwork in geology at Cambridge with Adam Sedgwick (1795\u20131873). All\nof this has considerably deepened the understanding of his scientific\nand intellectual preparation for the theoretical work that transpired\nduring the voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle (Sloan 2003b\n[2009]). Some scholars now interpret Darwin\u2019s initial\nreflections on transformism to have developed from lines of thought\nstimulated by Humboldt\u2019s version of German philosophy of nature\nas much as from the traditional sources usually assumed in Lyell,\nHerschel and British natural theology (R.J.  Richards 2005, 2002:\nchp. 14). This scholarly work, while not rejecting the importance of\ntraditional British sources, has revealed the multiplicity of origins\nof Darwin\u2019s reflections that display the interaction of British\ntraditions with Continental developments in life science and\nphilosophy, including those of German origin (R.J.  Richards 2002;\nSloan 2003a, 2007).\n\nThe continued scholarly interest in the origins of Darwin\u2019s\ntheory reflects not only the concerns of historians of science, but\nalso those who see a continued relevance of Darwin\u2019s own\nwritings as sources of creative reflection for contemporary work in\nevolutionary biology (Gayon 2003). This phenomenon, however, presents\ndifficulties for the historical understanding of Darwinism.\nParticularly within anglophone philosophy of biology, the emphasis on\nthe lines of the development of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory\nthat have led to the consensus position achieved in the so-named\n\u201cSynthetic\u201d theory of evolution of the 1930s (Smocovitis\n1996; Mayr & Provine [ed.] 1980; Provine 1971), has tended to\nobscure the complex history of Darwin\u2019s own theoretical\nreflections and the history of Darwinian theory since 1859 (Depew\n& Weber 1995; Bowler 1983).\n\nThese internal complexities in the heritage of Darwin\u2019s works\nhave shaped Darwinism into more than one tradition, with pre-existing\nsocial and intellectual contexts playing a critical role in the\ninterpretation of Darwin\u2019s achievement. French biology, for\nexample, still pays greater respect to Lamarck than is true in\nanglophone literature (Laurent [ed.] 1997). Several commentators\ncurrently seek to de-emphasize the contrasts between the presumably\nfailed theories of Lamarck and those of Darwin that figure largely in\nBritish and American literature, or else see some greater\ncompatibility between a \u201cmolecularized\u201d understanding of\nevolution and Lamarckianism (Gissis & Jablonka [eds] 2011). The\nlong heritage of Kantianism and German Idealism has influenced lines\nof the German interpretations of Darwin up to the present (H\u00f6sle\n& Illies [eds] 2005). The general importance of prior social and\nintellectual context in the reception of Darwin\u2019s work is a\ntopic of active research that will be summarized in greater detail\nbelow.\n",
