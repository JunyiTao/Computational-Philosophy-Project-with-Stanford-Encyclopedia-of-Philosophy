    "main_text": "\n\nNatural language sentence-linking words (like \u201cand\u201d,\n\u201cor\u201d) have traditionally had aspects of their use\nsimulated by corresponding connectives in various systems of formal\nlogic. (In fact we use the word \u201cconnective\u201d more\ngenerously, so that there don\u2019t have to be two or more sentences\nlinked, allowing us to consider the analogues of words like\n\u201cnot\u201d and \u201cnecessarily\u201d as connectives too.)\nAmong the questions this enterprise has raised are the following.\n(1) Which such naturally occurring sentence connectives call for a\ntreatment of this kind? (Which of them should be counted as\n\u2018logical constants\u2019?) (2) Do the aspects of their use\nwhich are simulated in that process exhaust what we might think of as\ntheir meanings, or is there typically some mismatch here? Of\ncourse this second question depends on the particular formal treatment\ngiven, since different logics may disagree on the formal principles\naccorded to their representatives\u2014for example in the case of\n\u201cif\u201d, but according to one famous line of thought\n(developed by H. P. Grice) when we focus specifically on their\ntreatment in classical propositional logic, any such apparent\ndiscrepancies can be explained away by appeal to pragmatic principles\nregulating ordinary cooperative conversation, and do not reflect\ndifferences of meaning (semantic differences).\n\nNeither question (1) nor question (2) will be addressed here. Instead,\nthis entry focusses on the properties of\u2014and relations\nbetween\u2014the formal representatives of these connectives.\nExamples of such properties include truth-functionality and a\nreplacement property called congruentiality, and of such relations\nwhat we call the subconnective relation\u2014relating one\nconnective to another when (roughly speaking) every logical principle\nholding for the first of a pair of connectives also holds for the\nsecond. In fact, all of these concepts are subject to a further\nrelativity. For instance a connective is or is not congruential\naccording to a given logic, with a similar relativity in the\ncase of whether one connective is a subconnective of another. On the\nother hand, as truth-functionality is defined below, a connective is\nor is not truth-functional with respect to a class of\ntruth-value assignments\u2014and various interesting further\nrelations give rise to a corresponding logic-relative version of this\nconcept depending on the different ways a class of truth-value\nassignments is linked to a logic (which in turn depends on how we\nthink of a logic\u2014as an ordinary consequence relation, for\nexample, or as a \u2018multiple conclusion\u2019 consequence\nrelation: see further note 1 below). For some other properties, the\nfurther relativity is a bit different. For example, whether a given\nconnective is uniquely characterized\u2014in the sense of\nbeing governed by rules which when reduplicated to govern a new\nconnective render compounds formed from the same component sentences\nusing the original and the new connective completely\ninterchangeable\u2014is relative not just to a logic but to a\nparticular proof system (set of rules systematizing the logic).\n\nSection 1 introduces the idea of formal sentential languages as\n(absolutely free) algebras, their primitive connectives having the\nstatus of the fundamental operations of these algebras, and explains\nthe notion of a consequence relation on such a language. At a more\ngeneral level, Galois connections are also introduced, and a simple\nobservation made concerning what we call binary relational\nconnections, to be applied in later sections. Section 2 introduces the\nfundamental idea of a valuation for a language (a bivalent truth-value\nassignment to its formulas). Truth-functionality and a generalization\nthereof called pseudo-truth-functionality (of a connective with\nrespect to a class of valuations) are explained, as well as the idea\nof sequents and sequent-to-sequent rules. We then move to a more\ngeneral conception of sequents as originally conceived, allowing a set\nof formulas to play the conclusion role rather than just a single\nformula, as well as to the associated idea of generalized consequence\nrelations, emphasizing Carnap\u2019s motivation for making this\ngeneralization. That motivation can be summarised with reference to\none connective. We take negation as our example. Consider the\nconsequence relation determined by the class of all valuations on\nwhich the usual negation truth-function connective is associated with\nthe negation connective. This can be regarded as the classical logic\nof negation, at least if logics are identified with consequence\nrelations. Now, there are additional valuations consistent with this\nconsequence relation on which the negation truth-function is\nnot associated with the negation connective. (The terminology\nof a valuation\u2019s being consistent with a consequence relation is\nadapted from Dana Scott. A precise definition appears in Section 2.)\nBut when we consider instead generalized consequence relations, the\nanalogous discrepancy does not arise. Section 2 includes a statement\nof a result of D. Gabbay which isolates precisely the truth-functions\nfor which such discrepancies do not arise (roughly: generalizations of\nthe conjunction truth-function and various projection functions), as\nwell as of a result of W. Rautenberg showing that despite this\nexpressive weakness in the apparatus of consequence relations, they\nare sufficiently discriminating\u2014without the need to pass to\ngeneralized consequence relations\u2014to distinguish the logical\nproperties of any two truth-functions (of the same arity).\n\nSection 3 picks up the theme of sequent-to-sequent rules,\nconcentrating on semantic analysis in the style of J. W. Garson of\nsuch rules, and also on the existence and uniqueness of connectives\nsatisfying given rules (a topic introduced by H. Hi\u017c). These last\ntwo are seen to be connected with what we call cut-inductivity and\nid-inductivity of specifically sequent-calculus rules, via, in the\nformer case, a proposal identifying the existence of a connective\n(with prescribed logical behaviour, given the perspective provided by\na logic not explicitly providing such a connective) with conservative\nextension (of the given logic by rules for the new connective\ndetailing that behaviour). This proposal was made by N. D. Belnap;\nsome problems for conservative extension as a sufficient condition for\ngranting the existence or intelligibility of a new connective with\nsuch-and-such logical properties are noted. Section 4 collects several\ncases of interest in which one might wonder about the existence of\nconnectives with various such properties. For instance (this being\nExample 3 out of a total of seven) one might ask if it makes sense to\nhave a 1-ary connective with the property that two applications of\nthis connective are equivalent to a single application of (classical)\nnegation.
