    "main_text": "Monotheism and Prophetic Messianism\n10. Cohen\u2019s Influence\n\nThe range of Cohen\u2019s influence is wide. Few figures are as\nimportant for Jewish ethics and philosophy of religion in the\ntwentieth century, and in the last four decades religion scholars\nhave devoted considerable attention to understanding Cohen\u2019s\nsignificance as a religious thinker and public intellectual. More\nrecently, historians of philosophy in the analytic tradition have\nbegun to appreciate the importance of Cohen\u2019s neo-Kantianism as\na source not only of influential interpretations of Kant, but of the\ntopics and methods characteristic of philosophy of science in the\ntwentieth century.\n\nIn Jewish religious thought, Cohen\u2019s influence is highly\nvisible, and substantive doctrines he developed in the Ethics of\nPure Will and the Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of\nJudaism are still topics of debate. Martin Buber\u2019s 1923\nI and Thou was explicitly indebted to, and a response to,\nCohen\u2019s Religion. Inspired by Cohen (see \u00a78\nabove), Buber elaborated an account of a relationship between the\n\u201cI\u201d and the \u201cThou.\u201d Like Cohen, for Buber this\nrelation is the central part of how an individual establishes a\nprofoundly personal relationship with God. Also like Cohen, Buber\nthinks establishing that relationship with God is essential to\nstrengthening the ethical bonds in one\u2019s community. But unlike\nCohen, Buber thought the I-Thou relationship was essentially beyond\nlanguage\u2019s ability to express\u2014a view strikingly at odds\nwith Cohen\u2019s rationalist philosophical tendencies.\n\nMore recently, religious ethicists have been interested in\nCohen\u2019s view that monotheism expresses a universalist morality,\nand that it expressed for the first time in history the idea that all\nhumanity must be subject to the same ethical laws. The religion\nscholar Wendell Dietrich (Dietrich 1986) identifies this view as\n\u201cethical monotheism,\u201d and sees Cohen as the first in a\ntrajectory of religious philosophers who argue that the concept of a\nunique God is necessary for\u2014or whose essential content is\nrevealed to us as (Gibbs 2001)\u2014ethical laws and the freedom to\nlive according to them. Avi Bernstein-Nahar (1998 and 2006) argues\nthat Cohen\u2019s ethics, and perhaps his ethical monotheism in\nparticular, provide the intellectual basis for a Jewish identity that\ncan be shared by various Jewish communities that might otherwise have\nlittle in common. On this view, Cohen\u2019s ethics thus have a\ncentral role to play in Jewish education.\n\nCohen\u2019s influence on Anglo-American analytic philosophy is less\nvisible. Perhaps the only area of Anglo-American philosophy where a\nsubstantive doctrine of Cohen\u2019s is still respected is Kant\ninterpretation. Before Cohen\u2019s Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience, interpretations of Kant were\noverwhelmingly\u2014some have claimed\nexclusively\u2014psychologistic in one way or another (see \u00a72\nabove). Some of those interpretations attributed to Kant a form of\nidealistic transcendental psychology, what Hegel called\n\u201csubjective idealism.\u201d Others attributed to Kant some form\nof empirical psychologism. But Cohen denies that Kant is interested in\nhow the mind\u2014either the transcendental mind or the empirical\nmind\u2014operates to synthesize the knower\u2019s representations.\nFor Cohen, Kant is interested in knowledge considered as if laid out\n\u201cin printed books\u201d (Cohen 1877, 27).\n\nCohen is thus at the head of a tradition of anti-psychologistic\ninterpretations of Kant that includes Kant scholars such as Peter\nStrawson and, more recently, Henry Allison. It would overstate\nCohen\u2019s influence to suggest that he directly inspired, say,\nStrawson\u2019s interpretation of Kant. But the anti-psychologistic\nphilosophical environment in which Strawson produced his Kant\ninterpretation owed a great deal to Cohen\u2019s influence. (Cf. Edel\n1993 for a discussion of Cohen\u2019s anti-psychologism in relation\nto the tradition of analytic philosophy to which Strawson belongs.)\nFurther, as English-language Kant interpretation became more\nsophisticated over the second half of the twentieth century and\nengaged more seriously with existing German literature, historians of\nphilosophy like Allison found themselves at home in a much longer\nGerman tradition of anti-psychologistic Kant interpretation going back\ndirectly to Cohen. That anti-psychologistic tradition dominated\nAnglo-American Kant interpretation for the latter decades of the\ntwentieth century and is still the majority view today.\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to limit a survey of Cohen\u2019s\ninfluence on contemporary analytic philosophy to the doctrines of his\nthat are still alive today. Arguably his most profound influence on\nanalytic philosophy has not been to give us particular philosophical\ndoctrines, but to contribute to the basic shape, the basic orientation\nof an entire major subdiscipline of philosophy. Nowhere is this more\nevident than in history and philosophy of science (cf. Patton\n2005).\n\nRecent history of philosophy of science has become increasingly aware\nof neo-Kantianism\u2019s influence on philosophy of science in the\ntwentieth century. It is thus worth taking seriously Cohen\u2019s\nrole in shaping twentieth-century philosophy of science. His\ncommitment to the transcendental method lead him to a view of\nepistemology, and theoretical philosophy more generally, as\nessentially a philosophically critical account of the historical\ndevelopment of concepts in the mathematically-precise natural\nsciences. This view of a historically-oriented philosophy of science\nis nowhere more clear in Cohen\u2019s work than in his Principle\nof the Infinitesimal Method. There are two significant points\nabout the view he expresses there. First, for Cohen, the theory of\nknowledge begins by accepting a body of existing science, and then\ngives a philosophical reconstruction of important concepts and\ndevelopments in that science\u2019s history. Second, Cohen thinks the\nprincipal topic of the theory of knowledge is mathematically-precise\nnatural science\u2014paradigmatically mathematics and physics.\nCohen\u2019s disciple, Ernst Cassirer, would carry out this program\nin, among other writings, three books on the history and philosophy of\nphysics.\n\nBut philosophers far beyond the Marburg School were influenced by\nCohen\u2019s insistence that the philosophical reconstruction of\nscientific theories is the principal method of the theory of\nknowledge, and that its principal topic is mathematically-precise\nnatural science. Logical positivist philosophy of science took up\naspects of Cohen\u2019s project, including its central concern with\nmathematics and physics. Like Cohen, positivists also thought\nphilosophy should accept existing bodies of science as a starting\npoint, and should seek to reconstruct that science\u2019s theories\nand methods, even though they thought modern logic was the proper tool\nfor carrying out their reconstructions. (Cf. Richardson 2006 and\nFerrari 2018 for discussions of Cohen\u2019s philosophy in relation\nto logical empiricism.) Recent scholarship on logical positivism, and\nespecially on Rudolf Carnap, has emphasized its intellectual debts to\nMarburg School neo-Kantianism. (Cf. Friedman 1999 and 2000; Richardson\n1998 and especially 2006.) Conversely, a French tradition of\nphilosophy of science emphasized a different aspect of Cohen\u2019s\nproject. The neo-Kantian Emile Meyerson, and his intellectual heirs,\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9 and ultimately Thomas Kuhn, emphasized a more\ndeeply historical reconstruction of scientific theories and methods.\nFinally, more recent philosophy of science has seen a turn back to\nviews even more explicitly inspired by Marburg School doctrines: most\nprominently, Michael Friedman has defended the view that in\nreconstructing scientific theories, philosophy should seek to\narticulate the \u201cconstitutively a priori\u201d principles in\nthose theories\u2014that is, principles that are constitutive of the\npossibility of experience in precisely Cohen\u2019s sense (Friedman\n2001; cf. Giovanelli 2018). More generally, although twentieth-century\nhistory and philosophy of science did not always take seriously\nCohen\u2019s substantive doctrines, it was nevertheless affected\nprofoundly by his vision of philosophy as the reconstruction of\nhistorical developments in mathematically-precise natural science.\n",
