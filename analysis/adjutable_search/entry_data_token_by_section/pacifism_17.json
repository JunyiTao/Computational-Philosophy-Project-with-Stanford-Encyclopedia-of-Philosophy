    "main_text": "Religious and Cultural Basis || Religion and Virtue Ethics\n5.1 Religion and Virtue Ethics\n\nPacifism that is absolutist and deontological is often grounded in\nreligious belief. Christian philosopher Stanley Hauerwas has claimed\nthat pacifism is a theological position because it is as much about\neschatological faith as it is about ethics and politics (Hauerwas\n2006). A variety of religions have supported pacifist positions.\nHindus, Jains, and Buddhists share a concern for ahimsa or\nnonviolence as a basic moral virtue. Likewise, Christians also find a\ncommitment to nonviolence at the heart of their tradition. One reason\nthat absolutist and deontological pacifism appears to require a\nreligious foundation is that the commitment to peace can lead to\nsuffering in the \u2018real\u2019 world of political life. But for\nsome religious believers the world of political life is only an\napparent world and not the real world at all. In the Buddhist\ntradition, the world of dependent arising is a world of appearances in\nwhich suffering is ubiquitous. One of the ways to overcome this\nsuffering is to see through the veil of maya and the illusions of this\nworld. Ahimsa or nonviolence is a virtue that renounces the ubiquitous\nviolence of the \u2018real\u2019 world. In a different way, the\nChristian tradition holds that the \u2018city of God\u2019 or divine\nprovidence is a mysterious reality that is infinitely more important\nthan the reality of the \u2018city of Man.\u2019\n\nThe structure of this sort of religious belief is closely related to\nthe absolute, deontological, and transformational nature of religious\npacifism. In Christian pacifism, it is God\u2019s commandments as\narticulated by Jesus that necessitate a commitment to pacifism. Of\ncourse, this is a contentious point; and some deny that Christianity\nrequires pacifism (see Fiala 2007). But Christian pacifists maintain\nthat Christians should refuse to kill regardless of the consequences\nin the \u2018real\u2019 world. Related to this is the faith that God\nwill provide both the strength to endure suffering and a final reward\nfor those who remain committed to principles of nonviolence. Even\nthough pacifism may seem imprudent or even idiotic from the standpoint\nof consequentialism or political realism, these consequences have no\nlasting significance from the standpoint of Providence. Indeed,\nreligious pacifists are not averse to the pain that they might suffer\nas a result of their refusal to take part in violence because they\nbelieve that this suffering will be redeemed in the larger structure\nof divine justice.\n\nA further variety of religious pacifism is closely connected with the\nideas of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics emphasizes the cultivation of\nvirtues over the course of a lifetime. Virtue ethicists are reluctant\nto judge actions in isolation from the total context of an\nindividual\u2019s life. Religious pacifism has a virtue ethics\ncomponent when the commitment to peace is conceived as a lifelong\nproject of personal transformation. In the Christian tradition this is\nunderstood as a project in which human beings learn to imitate Jesus\nin order to become closer to God. The Christian model of virtue is\nJesus, and Jesus\u2019 practice of nonviolence culminated in his\ncrucifixion. Christian martyrs have looked to this paradigm for\nmillennia.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that virtue ethics need not be\nreduced to a merely religious idea: there are important non-religious\narticulations of virtue ethics. And there are authors who defend\nversions of pacifism based upon claims grounded in humanistic virtue\nethics. David K. Chan has argued, for example, that while virtuous\nindividuals would generally be averse to killing, they would not be\nabsolute pacifists (Chan 2017 and 2012). A different argument for\npacifism, based in virtue ethics, has been made by Trivigno (2013),\nwho argues that training soldiers to kill turns them into bad\npersons.\n\nA similar idea about the practical impact of violence or nonviolence\nis found in the Indian traditions. Gandhi\u2019s practice of\nself-renunciation (brahmacharya) including his vow of poverty\nand his fasts were closely tied to his commitment to ahimsa.\nFor Gandhi, nonviolence is part of a total practice of virtue. In the\nBuddhist tradition this is developed for example, in Thich Nhat\nHanh\u2019s (1987) idea of \u201cbeing peace.\u201d The virtue\napproach emphasizes that pacifism is a lifelong project that requires\ndiscipline and practice. This is true because we are not born\nvirtuous. Rather, we learn to cultivate the virtue of peacefulness by\ngradually learning habits that help us control and resist anger,\nhatred, pride, competitiveness and the other emotions that lead to\nviolence. In the Christian tradition this is linked to the idea of\noriginal sin: we are born in violence and have to learn to overcome\nviolence. Theological questions arise in Christianity about whether\nhuman beings can overcome violence by themselves or whether grace is\nneeded in order to cultivate the virtue of peace.\n\nIt is possible to develop a version of virtue-pacifism from a\nnon-religious standpoint. In the ancient world, some versions of\nStoicism and Epicureanism come close to this. Stoics, for example,\nemphasize the virtue of tranquility or undisturbedness. One attains\nthis state by learning proper discipline and by cultivating the other\nvirtues that are essential for reigning in hubris. Hubris is wanton\nviolence or pride run amok. Since Plato, the Greek tradition has\nclaimed that justice, courage, moderation, and wisdom were needed to\novercome hubris. It is conceivable that these virtues would conjoin in\na sort of peacefulness. Indeed, one can see the roots of nonviolent\nsocial protest in Socrates\u2019 nonresistance to the Athenian state.\nIt should be noted, however, that although Socrates refused to carry\nout unjust orders, he did serve the state in battle.\n\nA non-religious version of virtue-pacifism can be found in the ideas\nof 20th Century humanists such as William James. At the\nbeginning of the 20th Century, James acknowledged that war\nand military service did produce certain virtues, such as courage and\ndiscipline. But James hoped that there could be a non-military way of\nproducing these virtues. This was the basic idea behind his proposal\nfor a \u201cmoral equivalent to war,\u201d which was an attempt to\nfind a way to produce virtues without connecting them to militarism\n(James 1910).\n",
