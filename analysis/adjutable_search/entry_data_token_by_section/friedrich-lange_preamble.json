    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Albert Lange (b. 1828, d. 1875) was a German philosopher,\npedagogist, political activist, and journalist. Lange is a significant\nfigure among the mid nineteenth century German intellectuals who were\nconcerned to think through the impact of developments in natural\nscience for politics, philosophy, and pedagogy.\n\nLange played a significant role in the German labour movement and in\nthe development of social democratic thought. He articulated a\nsocialist Darwinism that was an alternative to early social Darwinism.\nHis work The History of Materialism and Critique of its\nContemporary Significance was a classic text in materialism and\nthe history of philosophy well into the twentieth century. The\n\u201cmaterialism controversy\u201d (see Beiser 2014a, chapter 9,\nand 2014b, chapter 2) centered on the impact of materialist science\nand philosophy on religion and metaphysics. Lange\u2019s response to\nthe materialism controversy had an influence on the neo-Kantian\nmovement and on Friedrich Nietzsche, among others. Lange was one of\nthe originators of \u201cphysiological neo-Kantianism\u201d and an\nimportant figure in the founding of the Marburg school of\nneo-Kantianism. His work in logic, culminating in Logical\nStudies, derived the syllogistic from diagrammatic reasoning, and\nwas admired by Ernst Schr\u00f6der and John Venn.\n\nLange\u2019s sympathetic critique of materialism, his philosophical\nnaturalism, and his political activism unite his diverse achievements,\nand distinguish him among nineteenth century philosophers.\n",
