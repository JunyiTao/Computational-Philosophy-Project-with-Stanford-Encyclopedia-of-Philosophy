    "main_text": "A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism || Tacit Consent\n4.8 Tacit Consent\n\n\nLocke, in part desiring to avoid these obvious difficulties or\nirrational and immoral failures of consent, introduced the notion of\ntacit consent (Locke 1990). The possibility of tacit consent allows\nthat one may consent without having to go through the usual motions\nassociated with expression of consent. For example, at a board meeting,\none consents tacitly to the chairman's scheduling a meeting if one says\nnothing when the chair asks for objections to the proposal. And that\ntacit consent is valid to the extent that the failure to object is\nunderstood as a kind of consent and is voluntary.\n\n\nThe main problem with tacit consent is the problem of\ninterpretation. How does one interpret the actions of another so as to\nthink of them as consenting though they did not explicitly do so?\nTheorists differ on the constraints that must be placed on the\ninterpretation of the behaviors of others. Simmons argues that for\nbehavior to count as tacit consent it the behavior must be explicitly\nunderstood by all to be a kind of consent, it must be clear how when to\nperform the act or omission that constitutes tacit consent, it is not\ndifficult to consent and the costs of dissent are not prohibitive. But\nit is not obvious that Locke had this in mind. Locke thought that the\nmere residing in a territory and voluntarily benefiting from the\nactions of a minimally just state were sufficient conditions of tacit\nconsent. One might think that Locke thought the following. If a person\nvoluntarily resides in a territory over which the state has\njurisdiction and that person benefits from the establishment of the\nrule of law and all the other amenities the state provides then that\nperson must know or ought to know that the state's provision of these\nbenefits depends on the obedience of the members of the society. But if\nthe person now continues to reside voluntarily in the state, that\nperson must know that others expect obedience from him unless he is\nunder some special exemption. He must know or ought to know, in other\nwords, that others can reasonably interpret his voluntary residence as\ncommitting him to obedience to the laws of the state. So, we have\nadequate reason to interpret a person's continued voluntary residence\nas a form of consenting to abide by the laws of the state.\n",
