    "main_text": "Solidarity in Practice\n2. Solidarity in Practice\n\nSo far, we have discussed the nature of solidarity in general. In this\nsection, we review the social and political practices in which the\nterm has primarily figured. Whatever account of the general concept we\nthink is best should aid us in illuminating each of these contexts (by\nsuccessfully describing, evaluating, and guiding them). In the\nfollowing, however, we remain neutral between different accounts of\nthe general concept. Furthermore, we only cover a sample of such\ncontexts. There are many more practices in which solidarity has found\na place. We focus on what strike us as the historically most important\nand influential ones.\n",
