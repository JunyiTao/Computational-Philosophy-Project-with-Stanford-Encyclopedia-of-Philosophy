    "main_text": "General Strategies for Combining Modal Systems || Complexity Issues\n3.4 Complexity Issues\n\nSo far, this text has described different ways in which a multi-modal\nsystem can emerge. We have briefly discussed how a single modal system\ncan give rise to a multi-modal one by providing either syntactic or\nsemantic definitions of new concepts\n (section 2),\n and also how two or more modal systems can be combined in order to\nproduce a multi-modal one\n (section 3).\n As the provided examples have shown (and the examples in\n section 4\n will continue to do), the addition of modalities allows us to\nestablish and/or find significant relationships between the involved\nconcepts, thus providing a better understanding of what each one of\nthem is.\n\nBut there is also another side to this coin. By adding modalities to a\nsystem, one increases its expressivity, and this may also have the\nundesirable consequence of raising its\n computational complexity.\n Indeed, a modal language allows us to describe a certain class of\nmodels. If the language is fairly simple, then deciding whether a\ngiven formula is true in a given world of a given model (the\nmodel-checking problem) and deciding whether a given formula\nis true in all worlds of all models in a given class (the\nvalidity problem) are simple tasks. Now suppose a more\nexpressive language is used. It is then possible to distinguish models\nthat were, from the first language\u2019s perspective, the same (see,\ne.g., the appendix on the non-definability of distributed and common\nknowledge within \\(\\cL_{\\left\\{ \\oK{1}, \\ldots, \\oK{n} \\right\\}}\\)).\nHowever, intuitively, we might then need to make a stronger effort to\nsee those differences: we might need more time to make the\ncalculations, and we might need more space to save intermediate\nresults. In a single sentence, expressivity and complexity go hand in\nhand, and an increase in the first typically produces an increase in\nthe second.\n\nThe simplest example of this phenomenon is given by the relationship\nbetween the two best-known logical languages, the propositional and\nthe first-order predicate one, when used to describe first-order\nmodels. The validity problem for the propositional language, which can\nbe understood as one that only allows us to talk about the properties\n(i.e., monadic predicates) of a single object and their Boolean\ncombination, is decidable: there are effective procedures\nthat can answer the validity question for any given propositional\nformula. The first-order predicate language can see much more (all\nobjects of the domain, together with their properties and their\nn-ary relations, among others), but this comes at a price: its\nvalidity problem is undecidable, as there is no effective\nprocedure that can answer the validity question for all its\nformulas.\n\nIn the modal realm there are also such cases, some of them in which\nseemingly harmless combinations produce dramatic results. An example\nof this can be found in Blackburn, Rijke, and Venema (2001: Section\n6.5), where it is shown that the fusion of two decidable systems, a\nPDL-like system (with sequential composition and intersection\nas the syntactic constructors) and a system with the global modality\n(Goranko & Passy 1992), crosses the border into undecidability.\nEven if the new multi-agent system turns out not to be undecidable,\nits complexity might be such that solving its validity problem for\nrelatively small instances is, for all practical purposes, impossible.\nAn example of such case is the basic multi-agent epistemic logic, with\nno requirements on the accessibility relations. The validity problem\nfor formulas in \\(\\cL_{\\left\\{ \\oK{1}, \\ldots, \\oK{n} \\right\\}}\\) is\n PSPACE:\n the space (and thus time) required to decide whether any given\n\\(\\varphi\\) is valid is given by a polynomial function. However,\nadding the common knowledge operator makes the validity problem for\nformulas in \\(\\cL_{\\left\\{ \\oK{1}, \\ldots, \\oK{n}, C \\right\\}}\\)\nEXPTIME (sometimes also called\n EXP):\n the required time is now given by an exponential\n function.[14]\n\nA major methodological issue is then to strike a proper balance\nbetween expressive power and computational complexity, with the best\nmulti-modal systems being those that manage to achieve a good\ncompromise in this sense. We end this section noticing briefly that,\nin the case of the combination of modal logics, complexity\ndepends deeply on the assumed bridge axioms. A famous example of this\nis the landmark paper by Halpern & Vardi (1989) on the complexity\nof (96!) epistemic and temporal logics over interpreted\nsystems, all of them differing on the used language (single or\nmultiple-agents, common knowledge or lack of) and the assumed bridge\nprinciples (the aforementioned perfect recall and no\nlearning, synchronicity, unique or multiple initial\nstate).\n",
