F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on metaphysics as a science and Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee aims to revive the sciences of the ancients,\nespecially the philosophical disciplines practiced by Plato and\nAristotle, to replace the (as he thinks) non-demonstrative disciplines\nof his contemporaries, and to resolve their otherwise interminable\ndisputes. This centrally includes a project of reviving scientific\nmetaphysics, because metaphysics (rather than physics or other\nsciences) offers the hope of a scientific demonstration that God\nexists and has no partner or contrary, and a scientific resolution of\nthe kal\u00e2m issues about God\u2019s attributes and acts,\nand the relation of God\u2019s acts to creatures and their\n acts.[1]\n Perhaps metaphysics can also determine whether the human soul, or\nsome part of it, survives death, and thus can resolve the\nkal\u00e2m issue about our \u201creturn\u201d to God. But\nalso, apart from whatever metaphysics may say about immortality,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks, following Aristotle, that the highest\nhuman happiness consists in the contemplation of God, so that\nmetaphysics will describe the content of our possible\nhappiness after death, and will come as close as we can come to\nanticipating it in this life.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee did not write any one systematic work on\nmetaphysics, corresponding to Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\nalthough his Book of Letters and On the One and\nUnity, taken together, stand in a close relation to some parts\nand aspects of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, and parts of\nhis Principles of the Opinions of the People of the Perfect\nCity and On the Political Constitution stand in close\nrelations to other parts and aspects of the Metaphysics\n(other parts of these treatises are closer to other Greek models).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s starting-point in trying to revive\nthe science of metaphysics and to reconstruct and imitate its\nclassical texts (above all Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics) is\nhis discussion of the \u201caim\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d\n[Arabic ghara\u1e0d = Greek skopos] of metaphysics.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes over late ancient philosophers\u2019\nassumptions that each of Aristotle\u2019s treatises is devoted to\nteaching some one science, and that each science (and the treatise\nteaching it) has some one \u201caim\u201d, such that everything the\nscience treats is somehow related to that aim. Thus the\n\u201caim\u201d of medicine is health: the science of medicine also\ndiscusses, for instance, anatomy and pathology and pharmacology, but\nonly because they are somehow related to health. Much of\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s discussion of Aristotle\u2019s texts\npicks up late ancient discussions of what science each text transmits,\nthe \u201caim\u201d of the science and the text, how those sciences\nfunction together to attain the human good and what role each text can\nplay in that larger undertaking. In order to reconstruct what\nAristotle would say now, instead of what he said in Greek in the\nMetaphysics, if he were addressing a different linguistic and\nreligious community in a different historical situation,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee must start by understanding the aim of\nmetaphysics as a science and how each book of the Metaphysics\nis directed toward attaining that aim. He gives surveys of the Greek\nsciences in his Enumeration of the Sciences and\nAttainment of Happiness, and of Aristotle\u2019s works in\nthe Philosophy of Aristotle, all of which include brief\ndiscussions of metaphysics; he also has a brief discussion of\nmetaphysics and its relation to some other sciences in his Book of\nLetters, and he writes an entire short treatise On the aims\nof the Sage in each book of the treatise which is called the Book of\nLetters, that is, the determination of Aristotle\u2019s aim in his\ntreatise the Metaphysics (for short, On the Aims of the\nMetaphysics). In the bulk of the Book of Letters and\nOn the One and Unity he is not talking about\nmetaphysics as a science or about Aristotle\u2019s text, but rather\nimitating Aristotle in practicing this science. Some of On the\nAims of the Metaphysics is also imitating Aristotle, since, in\ndescribing the distinction between the different theoretical sciences\n(physics, mathematics, metaphysics) and the different things that\nmetaphysics considers, he is imitating Aristotle\u2019s discussion in\nMetaphysics VI,1.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee starts On the Aims of the\nMetaphysics by saying:\n\n\nOur intention in this book is to indicate the aim that is contained in\nthe treatise of Aristotle called Metaphysics, and [to\nindicate] its primary divisions. For many people have followed their\nfancy that the meaning and content of this treatise is the account of\nthe Creator (glory be to Him and be He exalted!) and the intelligence\nand the soul and the other things that are related to these, and that\nthe science of metaphysics and the science of\n theology[2]\n are one and the same. And thus we find that most of those who\ninvestigate [this treatise] are confused and go astray, since we find\nthat most of the account in it lacks this aim, indeed we do not find\nin it any special discussion of this aim except what is in the\neleventh book, which bears the sign lam [L or\n \u039b].[3]\n\n\nHere F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is referring to the discussion, which\nArabic writers had inherited from late ancient Greek commentators,\nabout the aim of the Metaphysics, or equivalently about what\nthe science of metaphysics is about: Aristotle himself does not use\nthe word or phrase\n \u201cmetaphysics\u201d,[4]\n but he speaks both of \u201cwisdom\n [sophia]\u201d[5]\n and of \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d, and Greek and Arabic\ncommentators assume that \u201cwisdom\u201d and \u201cfirst\nphilosophy\u201d are different names for the same science, and that\nthe Metaphysics as a whole is dedicated to this science,\nwhich can therefore also be called \u201cmetaphysics\u201d. For two\nreasons, there is an inherited problem about what this science is\nabout. The first reason is that Aristotle in different places says\ndifferent, not obviously compatible, things about what this science is\nabout: notably, in the Metaphysics I,1\u20132 he says that\nwisdom is the science of first causes and principles; in\nMetaphysics VI,1 and in several texts outside the\nMetaphysics he says that first philosophy is the science of\ndivine things (which he calls \u201ctheology\u201d) or the science\nof eternally unchangeable separately existing\n things;[6]\n in Metaphysics IV,1\u20132 he says that there is a science\nof being as such and its attributes, and in Metaphysics VI,1\nhe apparently identifies that science with first philosophy or\ntheology; and in Metaphysics IV,2 he also identifies the\nscience of being as such with the science of substance. So the\ncommentators try in different ways to reconcile these different things\nthat Aristotle says about wisdom or first philosophy. The second\nreason that there is a problem is that what Aristotle actually\ndoes in the different books of the Metaphysics does\nnot obviously fit with what he says that wisdom or first\nphilosophy will do. If, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says here,\n\u201cmost people\u201d have concluded that \u201cthe meaning and\ncontent of this treatise is the account of the Creator \u2026 and\nthe intelligence and the soul and the other things that are related to\nthese\u201d\u2014i.e., an account of things that can be argued to be\neternal and separable from matter\u2014this is not because (as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee puts it here) they have simply\n\u201cfollowed their fancy\u201d, or because they have confused\nGreek metaphysics with Islamic kal\u00e2m. Rather, it is\nbecause Aristotle repeatedly says that first philosophy is a\nscience of separate eternally unchanging things. The problem is that,\nas F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, most of the Metaphysics\noutside of Book XII (indeed, outside of roughly the second half of\nBook XII) does not seem to be talking about such things, except\ninasmuch as Metaphysics XIII\u2013XIV try to refute other\nphilosophers\u2019 candidates for separate eternally unchanging\nthings, namely Platonic Forms and mathematical objects. So\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s problem in On the Aims of the\nMetaphysics will not be simply to find a way of reconciling the\ndifferent things Aristotle says about wisdom or first\nphilosophy and show how these can all be referring to the same\nscience, but also to say what Aristotle actually does in each\nbook of the Metaphysics and to show how it contributes to\nthis science.\n\nIn his Enumeration of the Sciences F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ngives a description of \u201cthe divine science\u201d (corresponding\nto Aristotle\u2019s word \u201ctheology\u201d in\nMetaphysics VI,1, and his description of wisdom as\n\u201cdivine science\u201d in Metaphysics I,2), crowning\nhis previous descriptions of mathematics and physics. Here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says the divine science is divided into three\nparts. The first part investigates \u201cbeings and the things that\nbelong to them inasmuch as they are beings\u201d: this reflects\nAristotle\u2019s programmatic declaration in Metaphysics\nIV,1. The second part, says F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, investigates\n(i.e., establishes) the principles of the particular sciences, and\nalso investigates (i.e., refutes) false opinions of earlier\nphilosophers about the principles of these sciences, among which\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee mentions the opinion that mathematical\nobjects are separately existing substances: the latter would reflect\nMetaphysics\n XIII\u2013XIV,[7]\n but F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is probably also thinking of the\nrefutation in Metaphysics IV,3\u20138 of people who deny the\nprinciple of noncontradiction. (There is little support in Aristotle\nfor the idea that metaphysics establishes principles of other\nsciences, except for universal axioms like noncontradiction and\nexcluded middle, but this idea can be found in late ancient\ncommentators. Aristotle does accept cases where one science can\nestablish principles that are assumed in another science\u2014for\ninstance, number theory establishes principles that are assumed in\nmathematical music theory, and geometry establishes principles that\nare used in astronomy and optics\u2014and Porphyry says that\nmetaphysics is related to physics in this\n way.)[8]\n The third part of the \u201cdivine science\u201d\u2014and here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has much more to say\u2014shows that there\nare beings which neither are bodies nor exist in bodies, that these\nbeings are not one but many, and not infinitely but finitely many, and\nthat they do not all share the same degree of perfection, but rather\nsome are superior and others inferior. This then leads to the\nconclusion that these beings separate from bodies culminate in some\nfirst being which has nothing prior to it and thus has no further\ncause of its existence. And, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, this\nscience shows that this being also has no partner (nothing sharing its\ndegree of perfection) and no contrary; that there is no multiplicity\nin it in any way, and that it is one, being, and true in a stronger\nsense than everything else; and that it is the first cause which\nbestows being, unity and truth on everything else. Then,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, this science shows that this being\ndeserves the name \u201cGod\u201d, and satisfies the rest of the\ndivine attributes; and then it shows how other beings arise from God\nand how they form an ordered hierarchy (some beings arise from God\ndirectly, others indirectly through these), explains how God acts on\nother things, and refutes the false opinion that God is responsible\nfor evils. The description of this third part of the \u201cdivine\nscience\u201d reads like an analytical table of contents for much of\nwhat F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does in his Principles of the\nOpinions of the People of the Perfect City and Political\nRegime, but it is not closely related to anything in Aristotle.\nAt best, it is an enormously expanded version of some things that\nAristotle covers very quickly in Metaphysics XII,6\u201310:\nXII,6 shows that there are separate incorporeal substances, XII,7\njustifies the name \u201cgod\u201d, XII,8 argues that there is a\nfinite multiplicity of such substances but only one first among them,\nand then XII,10 identifies this first principle with the good itself\nand argues (very sketchily) that it is the cause of good order in the\ncosmos and that there is no evil principle contrary to it. Aristotle\ndoes not seem to say in Metaphysics XII that the first\nprinciple is one, being, and true in a stronger sense than everything\nelse, or that it bestows being, unity and truth on everything else\n(the best support for this view might be Metaphysics II,1\n993b23\u201331). But the more serious problem is that\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee here just gives a list of the things that the\nscience will investigate or prove, without explaining why these tasks\nall belong to the same science, and without explaining what principles\nthe science can draw on to demonstrate all these conclusions. His\naccount here looks like a wish-list of what he would like the science\nto do, especially as a Greek scientific alternative to Islamic\nkal\u00e2m, but it does not explain how a science can do all\nthis. Rather than solving the inherited problem of how a single\nscience can meet the different descriptions that Aristotle gives of\nwisdom or first philosophy, he aggravates the problem by adding more\nthings that the science must\n do.[9]\n\nIn On the Aims of the Metaphysics, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntries to resolve the tension between \u201contological\u201d and\n\u201ctheological\u201d descriptions of metaphysics (science of\nbeings universally, vs. science of God or of separate immaterial\nsubstances), and the tension between Aristotle\u2019s mostly\n\u201ctheological\u201d descriptions of his task and his\nmostly \u201contological\u201d practice in the\nMetaphysics, in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes up Aristotle\u2019s contrast,\nin Metaphysics IV,1 and VI,1, between metaphysics and the\n\u201cparticular sciences\u201d such as physics and the mathematical\ndisciplines, each of which takes some one genus of beings and\ninvestigates what can be said of the things in that genus. By\ncontrast, says F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee,\n\n\nuniversal science is that which investigates what is common to all the\nthings that are, such as being and unity, and its kinds and its\nattributes, and things which are not accidents [proper to] any of the\nsubjects of the particular sciences, [i.e., things] like priority and\nposteriority and potency and act and the perfect and the deficient and\nwhat is like these, and the common principle of all the things that\nare: this is the thing that must be called by the name of\n God.[10]\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that there can be only one such\nuniversal science, because sciences are individuated by their\nsubject-domains: if there are two sciences, such that the\nsubject-domain of one includes something that is not within the\nsubject-domain of the other, then at least the second science is not a\nuniversal science; so any two universal sciences would have the same\nsubject-domain, and would therefore be the same science. So a\nuniversal science, if there is one, would be a science of being as\nsuch, and also of unity if (as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says,\nfollowing Aristotle in Metaphysics IV,2) unity is coextensive\nwith being, and also of any attributes (more literally\n\u201cconsequences\u201d) of being or unity, i.e., predicates that\ncan be shown to apply to every existing thing just because it exists\nor because it is one. (Since F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee cites pairs like\n\u201cthe perfect and the deficient\u201d, he apparently means to\ninclude, not just attributes that apply to all beings, but also pairs\nof attributes that apply disjunctively to all beings, in something\nlike the way that even and odd apply disjunctively to all numbers.)\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not argue here that there is a universal\nscience, beyond saying that \u201cit does not belong to any of [the\nparticular sciences] to investigate what is common to all the things\nthat are\u201d. Perhaps his view is that there is at least something\nto investigate here, namely \u201cwhat, if anything, is common to all\nthe things that are?\u201d. If that investigation yields no answer,\nor a negative answer, then there is no universal science; if we\ndiscover, for some value of P, that P belongs\nuniversally to all the things that are, then that proposition and the\narguments for it belong to the universal science, so there is a\nuniversal science. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is not assuming that being\nis univocal and so constitutes a single genus. He says in On the\nAims that Aristotle in Metaphysics V investigates\nwhether the terms for being and its attributes are univocal or not,\nand in his Book of Letters (see \n  Section 3 below) he says that\nbeing is not univocal, but is said of substances primarily and of\nother things derivatively. So if all beings have some attribute\nP, it will be because substances are P primarily,\nand other beings are P because substances are; but this is\nstill enough for \u201call beings are P\u201d to be a\ntheorem of the universal science.\n\nWe have seen that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee lists God as one of the\nthings investigated by the universal science. God is investigated by\nthe science that \u201cinvestigates what is common to all the things\nthat are\u201d because God is \u201cthe common principle of all the\nthings that are\u201d: he belongs to all beings in common, not\nbecause he is an attribute predicated of all beings, but because he is\na cause of all beings. More precisely, he is a cause of all beings\nqu\u00e2 being: that is, he is a cause, to the things that\nare, of the fact that they are, rather than of other facts\nabout them. As F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says a bit further down,\n\n\nthe divine science must enter into this science, since God is the\nprinciple of being simpliciter, not of one being as\ndistinguished from another being. And the division which gives the\nprinciple of being must be the divine science, since these concepts\nare not proper to physics but are higher than physics in generality.\nSo this science is higher than the science of nature, and\nafter the science of nature, and for this reason it should be\ncalled the science of metaphysics [lit. the science of what is after\nnature].\n\n\nHere F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is taking a stand on an issue that was\ncontroversial among Aristotelians, by saying that we do not come to\nknow God through the science of physics, even though Aristotle argues\nin his Physics 8 that the eternal circular motions are caused\nby eternally unmoved movers. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is saying that\nthe right way to come to know God is as a cause of existence rather\nthan as a cause of motion. On the face of it, this could be taken in\ntwo ways. (a) Perhaps F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee means that God is both\na cause of existence (to everything) and a cause of motion (to the\nthings that move, i.e., to bodies rather than to incorporeal\nsubstances), but that the right way to gain scientific knowledge of\nGod is to know him as the cause of existence.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s reason might be that, when we know\nabout God that he is a first cause of motion (an unmoved mover), we do\nnot thereby know what God is, since what God is must\napply only to God, and there are many unmoved movers, of the many\ncircular motions in the heavens. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\npoint may be that there is only one first cause of existence (although\nmany first causes of motion), and knowing about God that he is a first\ncause of existence gives us knowledge of what God is. (b) In\nfact, however, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that the first cause of\nexistence is prior to the first cause of motion in a stronger sense:\nknowing the first cause of motion does not give us knowledge of God,\nbecause God is not a cause of motion at all. On\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s account in the Perfect City\nand Political Regime, God is not the first of the unmoved\nmovers, but is rather a cause of existence to the unmoved movers and\nthus indirectly to everything else. So an ascent to the first cause of\nmotion does not get us to God at all, but only to some lower being:\nonly a study of the causes of being will get us to God.\n\nSo far, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s description of metaphysics is\nontological: theology is part of metaphysics, because theology is part\nof the study of being, namely the study of the first cause of\nexistence. This allows F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to reconcile\nAristotle\u2019s saying in Metaphysics VI,1 that first\nphilosophy is a science of being qu\u00e2 being with his saying in\nthe same chapter that first philosophy is theology. Unfortunately,\nthis solution seems to conflict with something else Aristotle says in\nthe same chapter, namely that\n\n\nphysics is about things that are inseparate but not unmoved, some of\nmathematics about things that are unmoved, but probably not separate\nbut rather existing in matter, whereas first philosophy is about\nthings that are both separate and unmoved.\n (1026a13\u201316)[11]\n\n\nThis seems to mean, not just that the study of things that are\nseparate and unmoved belongs to first philosophy, but that first\nphilosophy is defined as the science of things that are\nseparate and unmoved. How then is first philosophy the science of\nbeing and its universal attributes? One possible answer would be that\nfirst philosophy is by definition the science of God (or perhaps the\nscience of separate unmoved things including God), and that it studies\nbeing and its universal attributes instrumentally, because starting\nwith them and investigating their causes is the only way we have to\ncome to knowledge of God. (This might imply that those aspects of the\nstudy of being and its universal attributes which are not useful for\ndrawing conclusions about God would not belong to first\nphilosophy.) But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives a different answer, by\nreinterpreting what Aristotle means by \u201cseparate\u201d. This is\nthe second way that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to resolve\nthe tension between ontological and theological descriptions of\nmetaphysics.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee infers from the universality of the science\nhe has described, including its investigation of God as the cause of\nexistence universally, that\n\n\nthis science is higher than the science of nature, and after\nthe science of nature, and for this reason it should be called the\nscience of metaphysics [i.e., literally, the science of what is after\nnature].\n\n\nBut, as he admits, mathematics too \u201cis higher than the science\nof nature since its subjects are abstracted from matters\u201d: so\nwhy doesn\u2019t it count as metaphysics? Aristotle in\nMetaphysics VI,1 says that mathematics falls short of being\nfirst philosophy because its objects, although unchanging, do not\nexist separately but rather are thought in abstraction from the things\nthey really exist in, whereas the objects of first philosophy are not\nmerely thought in abstraction but really exist\nseparately. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes this up, and, like all\nancient and medieval interpreters, takes \u201cabstraction\u201d and\n\u201cseparation\u201d to mean abstraction and separation from\nmatter. It makes sense to say that God exists really separated\nfrom matter and triangles don\u2019t. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nthinks that the objects of metaphysics include not only God but also\nbeing and unity. Why should being and unity be any more\n\u201cseparate\u201d than triangles are? Here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee reinterprets the notion of separation.\nSome of the objects of metaphysics, like God, \u201care\nthings that have no existence at all in natural things\u201d. But\nothers, like being and its universal attributes, \u201care things\nthat exist in natural things but are imagined as abstracted from\nthem\u201d, and are to that extent like mathematical objects; but,\nunlike mathematical objects, they\n\n\ndo not exist per se in these [natural] things in such a way\nthat their existence could not be divested from them: these are the\nthings whose subsistence is in natural things but which exist both in\nnatural things and in non-natural things.\n\n\nSo because being and its universal attributes are attributes of\nnatural things but are also attributes of separately existing\nimmaterial things, they too can be said to be \u201cseparate\u201d\nfrom natural things and from matter.\n\nRecall that in the Enumeration of the Sciences\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee describes metaphysics as investigating three\nthings\u2014being and its attributes, the principles of the\nparticular sciences, and separate incorporeal beings (especially\nGod)\u2014but he does not explain why the three investigations fall\nunder a single science or what premisses the science can draw on to\nresolve the questions. In On the Aims of the Metaphysics he\ntries to explain how these investigations fit together. The science\nstarts by studying its primary subject, namely being and unity; then,\n\u201csince the science of opposites is the same\u201d, their\nopposites, non-being and multiplicity; then it divides being and unity\nand their opposites into their main species, or rather\nquasi-species\u2014\u201cquasi\u201d because substances, qualities,\nand the other categories are each called \u201cbeing\u201d in a\ndifferent sense, whereas if being were a genus and they were its\nspecies it would be said of them all in the same\n sense.[12]\n Then the science investigates the attributes and principles of being\nand unity and their opposites,\n\n\nand these things are divided and subdivided until the subjects of the\nparticular sciences are reached, and this science terminates and there\nare manifested in it the principles of all the particular sciences and\nthe definitions of their subjects.\n\n\nBecause being and unity are not univocal, we cannot just\nstraightforwardly investigate their attributes and causes, but once\nthey have been analyzed into their different senses, we can\ninvestigate the attributes and causes of each sense of being or unity\nin the same way that any other science investigates the attributes and\ncauses of some given genus. A given effect, say substantial being, may\nhave different kinds of causes (for instance, both a formal cause and\na material cause), and these different kinds of causes may not all\nconverge on a first principle which is a cause in all these ways at\nonce (there will not be a single first principle that is both a formal\nand a material cause). Some chains of causes may proceed upwards\nad infinitum without reaching a first principle (like the\nchain of my ancestors, if the world and species within it are\neternal); and chains of causes of some kind may lead to many first\ncauses which have no further causes of that kind, rather than to a\nsingle first cause (each animal has a soul as a first formal cause\nwhich has no higher formal cause, but there will be as many such\nsouls, not a single soul which is a first formal cause of all\nanimals). Nonetheless, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims that there is a\nsingle first cause of all beings, which does not itself have a cause\nof any kind; if so, such a thing would deserve the name\n \u201cGod\u201d.[13]\n If the science can show that there is such a single first principle,\nthe science would then try to deduce what this principle must be like\nin order to be a cause of all beings, and in order not to have any\nfurther cause itself, and would then try to deduce how it must acts in\norder to cause the existence of other things, some directly and others\nindirectly. Here in On the Aims F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says\nthat Aristotle does all these things in Metaphysics XII:\n\n\nThe eleventh book [i.e., Book XII, Lambda] is about the principle of\nsubstance and [thereby] of all existence, the existence [of this\nprinciple] and the confirmation that it is knowing by its essence and\ntrue by its essence, and about the separate beings which are after it,\nand about how the existence of beings depends on it.\n\n\nBut that is all that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says here, and he never\ngives any more detailed discussion of how he thinks Aristotle does\nthis in Metaphysics XII. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee himself\ntries to deliver on this promise in his Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime, which we will turn to after discussing his\nanalysis of being and unity and other equally universal concepts in\nhis Book of Letters and On the One and Unity.\n",
