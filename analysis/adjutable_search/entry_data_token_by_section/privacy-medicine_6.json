    "main_text": "Informational Privacy || Professional Norms\n1.6 Professional Norms \n\nThe duty of confidentiality is a core consensus norm within health\ncare (Currie 2005). One important manifestation of this consensus in\nthe U.S. has been the development of the \u201ccertificate of\nconfidentiality\u201d whereby researchers declare that\nconfidentiality is of especial interest to their subjects (Wolf and\nZandecki 2006, Wolf et al. 2004). The technological age has given rise\nto the call for health care providers, even those who work alone or in\nsmall groups, to be aggressive in the adoption of responsible\ninformation practices. All would agree that office practices can and\nshould be designed to protect the identity of clients and the privacy\nof conversations. Common understandings are that practitioners should\nbe judicious in the collection of information; they should store\ntreatment notes and records in a secure manner; they should share\ninformation only with consent or as required by law; and they should\nprotect sensitive information in its online and off-line forms using\nlocks, passwords, encryption and other appropriate devices. Sensitive\ninformation that is no longer needed should not be retained\nindefinitely.\n\nHealth Care providers are ascribed ethical obligations to avoid\ncasually discussing confidential patient matters in social media or in\ne-mail that may not be entirely private or secure (Chretien et al.\n2011). They must avoid discussing patient matters on mobile phones in\npublic places, such as in office corridors, hospital lobbies and on\ntrains. Confidentiality can be violated by unauthorized recordings and\ndisclosure of medical photographs. Photography plays a role in medical\nspecializations including dermatology and plastic surgery, giving\nraise to concerns about ethical uses of graphic images of\npatients\u2019 faces and bodies. At a minimum informed consent would\nappear to be required for making and disclosing photographs on whose\nbasis a person could be identified. Ethically imperative consent was\nnot obtained in a notorious U.S. case: it came to light in 2013 that a\nphysician affiliated with Johns Hopkins University Hospital secretly\nvideotaped hundreds of his obstetrics and gynecology patients with\npornographic intent (Allen 2015). Videotaping has come to play a\nroutine role in family therapy and is not considered unethical by\ntypical practitioners (AAMFT 2001). Many clinicians believe the\ntherapeutic and training benefits of videotaping outweigh the risks of\nunauthorized use or disclosure. Even if unauthorized use or disclosure\nwere not a concern, an ethical question would remain. Should\nbehavioral health clients be called upon to create recordings which\ninherently sacrifice the privacy of their homes, communications and\nexpressions of emotions?\n\nPhysicians are debating whether to increase the use of video and\naudio-taping in routine clinical practice, surgery and research, and\nbioethicists are weighing in (Blaauw et al. 2014; Makary 2013). Should\noffice visits be recorded as part of the standard medical record? On\nthe one hand, recordings would address the problem of faulty memory\nand incomplete encounter notes. Recordings could document informed\nconsent procedures and provide evidence to avert or support\nmalpractice suits. On the other hand, recordings could inhibit\npatients and increase their discomfort. Recording practices might\nencourage physicians to be less attentive to the patients in front of\nthem on the theory that they can always \u201cgo back to the\ntape\u201d for details.\n",
