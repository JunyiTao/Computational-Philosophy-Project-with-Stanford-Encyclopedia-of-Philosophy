    "main_text": "What Is Drift, and Can It Be Distinguished from Natural Selection? || Other Accounts of Drift\n2.4 Other Accounts of Drift\n\nOther accounts of drift are not so easily classified. For example,\nTimothy Shanahan (1992) argues that conceptually, random drift and\nnatural selection are the ends of a continuum. However, to reach this\nconclusion, Shanahan must reject heritability as a necessary condition\nfor natural selection. As evolutionary biologist John Endler has\nargued, this has the effect of trivializing natural selection to the\nclaim that \u201cthere are differences among different\nphenotypes\u201d (Endler 1986: 13).\n\nGrant Ramsey (2013) develops a concept he calls\n\u201cdriftability\u201d, which locates drift in individual\norganisms rather than in a population. Ramsey points out that the\npossible lives that an organism can lead is a large and heterogeneous\nset; thus, the actual life that any particular organism leads will\nprobably not be a representative sample (which he seems to equate to\nan average) of the set. Differences within the set of will lead to\ndifferent evolutionary outcomes; this intra-organismic heterogeneity\nwithin the set of possible lives of an organism is driftability.\n\nPeter Godfrey-Smith (2009) characterizes drift as changes where two\nparameters, the smoothness of fitness landscapes and dependence of\nreproductive character on fitness differences, are low. (However, when\nhe needs to explicate why drift has special importance in small\npopulations and why it can be mathematically described in particular\nways, he appeals to indiscriminate sampling. Perhaps, then,\nindiscriminate sampling is at the core of Godfrey-Smith\u2019s view\nof drift).\n\nAgain, these accounts, which seem to deviate significantly from\nbiological usage and practice, raise meta-philosophical issues about\nhow we ought to go about characterizing a scientific concept like\n\u201cdrift\u201d. How far can the definition of a term deviate from\nscientific usage and practice and still be considered to be a\ndefinition of the same thing?\n\nOne could also be a pluralist about drift, arguing that there is\nreason to accept more than one definition of drift, although it is\nunclear if anyone has actually endorsed this position. Marshall Abrams\nseems to come the closest, stating:\n\n\nIf random drift is anything, it is not one thing\u2026The term\napplies to many effects on populations or organisms which are said to\nbe due to \u201cchance,\u201d and to factors which are thought to\nhelp to produce such effects.
