Lobachevskian geometry\n\n\nEuclid (fl. 300 BCE) placed at the head of his Elements a\nseries of \u2018definitions\u2019 (e.g., \u201cA point is that which has\nno part\u201d) and \u2018common notions\u2019 (e.g., \u201cIf equals be added\nto equals, the sums are equal\u201d), and five \u2018requests\u2019.\nSupposedly these items conveyed all of the information needed for\ninferring the theorems and solving the problems of geometry, but as a\nmatter of fact they do not. However, the requests\n(aitemata)\u2014usually called \u2018postulates\u2019 in\nEnglish\u2014must at any rate be granted or Euclid's proofs will not\ngo through. Some of them are plainly practical:\n1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point. 3.\nTo draw a circle with any center and any radius.\n\n\nHowever, the fifth one sounds more like a statement of fact.  Euclid's\ntext can be rendered in English as follows: \u201cIf a straight line\n[c] falling on two straight lines [a and b]\nmakes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles,\nthe two straight lines [a and b], if produced\nindefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the\ntwo right angles\u201d (terms in brackets added for clarity). This\nsounds far-fetched. Still, it can be readily paraphrased as a recipe\nfor constructing triangles, (See Figure 1.) Every triangle is formed\nby three coplanar straight lines that meet, by pairs, at three\npoints. Given any segment PQ, draw a straight line a\nthrough P and a straight line b through Q,\nso that a and b lie on the same plane; verify that\nthe angles that a and b make with\nPQ on one of the two sides of PQ\nadd up to less than two right angles; if this condition is satisfied,\nit should be granted that a and b meet at a point\nR on that same side of PQ, thus forming the\ntriangle PQR. This request is known as \u201cEuclid's\nPostulate\u201d. If the request is rejected\u2014say, because we\nbelieve that the world is finite and there is no room in it to\naccommodate vertex R if the interior angles in question add up\nto very little less than two right angles\u2014then much of Euclid's\nsystem of geometry will not go through.\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\nIn the darker ages that followed, Euclid's sense of mathematical\nfreedom was lost and philosophers and mathematicians expected geometry\nto rest on self-evident grounds. Now, if a is perpendicular\nand b is almost perpendicular to PQ,\na and b approach each other very slowly on one side\nof PQ and it is not self-evident that they must\neventually meet somewhere on that side. After all, the hyperbole\nindefinitely approaches its asymptotes and yet, demonstrably, never\nmeets them.  Through the centuries, several authors demanded\u2014and\nattempted\u2014a proof of Euclid's Postulate. John Wallis\n(b.\u00a01616, d.\u00a01703) derived it from the assumption that there\nare polygons of different sizes that have the same shape. But then\nthis assumption needs proof in turn. Girolamo Saccheri (b.\u00a01667,\nd.\u00a01733) tried reductio. He inferred a long series of\npropositions from the negation of Euclid's Postulate, until he reached\none which he pronounced \u201crepugnant to the nature of the straight\nline\u201d.  But Saccheri's understanding of this \u201cnature\u201d was\nrooted in Euclidean geometry and his conclusion begged the\nquestion.\n\n\nIn the 1820's, Nikolai I. Lobachevsky (b.\u00a01793, d.\u00a01856)\nand Janos Bolyai (b.\u00a01802, d.\u00a01860) independently tackled\nthis question in a radically new way. Lobachevsky built on the negation\nof Euclid's Postulate an alternative system of geometry, which he\ndubbed \u201cimaginary\u201d and tried inconclusively to test for\nvalidity at the astronomical scale by calculating the sum of the\ninternal angles of triangles formed by stars on the sky. Bolyai excised\nthe postulate from Euclid's system; the remaining rump is the \u201cabsolute\ngeometry\u201d, which can be further specified by adding to it either\nEuclid's Postulate or its negation. From the 1790's Carl Friedrich\nGauss (b.\u00a01777, d.\u00a01855) had been working on the subject in\nthe same direction, but he refrained from publishing for fear of\nscandal. Since Lobachevsky was the first to publish, the system of\ngeometry based on the said \u201cabsolute geometry\u201d plus the negation of\nEuclid's Postulate is properly called Lobachevskian\ngeometry.\n\n\nThe construction introduced above to explain Euclid's Postulate can\nalso be used for elucidating its negation. Draw the straight\nline a through point P at right angles with the\nsegment PQ. If Euclid's Postulate is denied, there\nare countless straight lines through Q, coplanar\nwith a, that make acute angles with PQ but\nnever meet a.  Consider the set of real numbers which are the\nmagnitudes of these acute angles. Let the greatest lower bound of this\nset be \u03bc.  Evidently, \u03bc > 0. There are exactly two straight\nlines through\nQ, coplanar with a, that make an angle of size \u03bc with\nPQ. (See Figure 2.) Call them b1\nand b2. Neither b1 nor\nb2 meets a, but a meets every\nline through Q that is coplanar with a and makes\nwith PQ an angle less than \u03bc. Gauss, Lobachevsky\nand Bolyai\u2014unbeknownst to each other\u2014coincided in calling\nb1 and b2 the\nparallels to a through Q. \u03bc is called the angle\nof parallellism for segment PQ. Its size depends on\nthe length of PQ, and decreases as the latter\nincreases.\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that the angle of parallellism for PQ is one\nhalf a right angle. In this case, b1 and\nb2 make a right angle at Q and we thus\nhave two mutually perpendicular straight lines on the same plane as a,\nwhich fail to meet a.\n\n\nLobachevsky's geometry abounds in surprising theorems (many of which\nhad already been found by Saccheri). Here are a few: The three interior\nangles of a triangle add up to less than two right angles. The\ndifference or \u201cdefect\u201d is proportional to the triangle's area. Hence,\nin Lobachevskian geometry, similar triangles are congruent. Moreover,\nif a triangle is divided into smaller triangles, the defect of the\nwhole equals the sum of the defects of the parts. Since the defect\ncannot be greater than two right angles, the area of triangles has a\nfinite maximum. If a quadrilateral, by construction, has three right\nangles, the fourth angle is necessarily acute. Thus, in Lobachevskian\ngeometry there are no rectangles.\n\n\nThere is a simple formal correspondence between the equations of\nLobachevskian trigonometry and those of standard spherical\ntrigonometry. Based on it, Lobachevsky argued that any contradiction\narising in his geometry would inevitably be matched by a contradiction\nin Euclidean geometry. This appears to be the earliest example of a\npurported proof of relative consistency, by which a theory is shown to\nbe consistent lest another theory \u2014 whose consistency is\ntypically taken for granted \u2014 be inconsistent.\n\n\nLobachevskian geometry received little attention before the late\n1860s. When philosophers finally took notice of it, their opinions were\ndivided. Some regarded it as a formal exercise in logical deduction,\nwith no physical or philosophical significance, which employed ordinary\nwords\u2014such as \u2018straight\u2019 and\n\u2018plane\u2019\u2014with a covertly changed meaning. Others\nwelcomed it as sufficient proof that, contrary to the influential\nthesis of Kant, Euclidean geometry does not convey any prerequisites of\nhuman experience and that the geometrical structure of physical space\nis open to experimental inquiry. Still others agreed that Non-Euclidean\ngeometries were legitimate alternatives, but pointed out that the\ndesign and interpretation of physical experiments generally presupposes\na definite geometry and that this role has been preempted by Euclid's\nsystem.\n\n\nNo matter what philosophers might say, for mathematicians\nLobachevskian geometry would probably have been no more than an odd\ncuriosity, if a niche had not been found for it within both projective\nand differential geometry, the two main currents of nineteenth-century\ngeometrical research (\u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5).\n",
