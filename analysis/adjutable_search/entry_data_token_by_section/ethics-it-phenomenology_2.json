Firstly, it does not take\ninto account that the technology does not simply appear but is the\noutcome of complex and socially situated development and design\npractices. In this development and design process many alternative\noptions become excluded in favour of the technology that is now\navailable\u2014obviously with important social and normative\nimplications. In other words there are many cultural, political and\neconomic forces that shape the particular options suggested as well as\nthe way the selected options become designed and implemented (Bijker,\nPinch, and Hughes 1987). It is not only technology that\n\u2018impacts\u2019 on society; technology itself is already the\noutcome of complex and subtle social processes and practices\u2014in\nother words it is socially constructed in a very direct and\nsignificant manner. In short: our current technologies were not\ninevitable, things could have been substantially otherwise. Moreover,\nthey argue that when we look at the actual uses of particular\ntechnologies we discover that users use them in many diverse and often\nunexpected ways\u2014leading to many and diverse unintended\nconsequences. Both in its design and in its actual use there is an\nongoing reciprocal relationship in which society and technology\nco-construct each other; they act through and upon each other.\nTechnology is not simply passive tools, waiting for us to use them.\nThey circumscribe our possibilities and enact significant\n\u2018scripts\u2019 (Latour, 1991) that shape us as much as we shape\nthem. As Latour (2005, 107) suggests, technologies (as actors) make us\ndo things but \u201cnot by transporting a force that would remain the\nsame throughout as some sort of faithful intermediary, but by\ngenerating transformations manifested in many unexpected events\ntriggered in the other mediators that follow them along the\nline.\u201d The degree to which the technology/society distinction is\nuseful at all (ontologically or analytically) varies between the\ndifferent constructivist authors\u2014for example, Brey (1997)\nidentifies three different strands of constructivist approaches. Those\nwho support this view claim that it is very difficult to make general\nstatements about the \u2018impact\u2019 of a technology in some\ngeneral terms. One can, at most, speak of some general trends for\nwhich many exceptions will invariably exist. For the proponents of the\nthis constructivist view it is important to understand, through\ndetailed descriptive accounts, the particular ways in which\ntechnologies emerge and become embedded in particular social\npractices. Examples of such studies can be found in the work of Bijker\n(1995), Law (1991) and Latour (1991). \n",
