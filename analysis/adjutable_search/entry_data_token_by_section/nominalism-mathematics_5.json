    "main_text": "Five Problems || The problem of taking mathematical discourse literally\n2.4 The problem of taking mathematical discourse literally\nA related benefit of platonism is that it allows one to take\nmathematical discourse literally, given that mathematical terms\nrefer. In particular, there is no change in the syntax of mathematical\nstatements. So, when mathematicians claim that \u2018There are\ninfinitely many prime numbers\u2019, the platonist can take that\nstatement literally as describing the existence of an infinitude of\nprimes. On the platonist view, there are obvious truth-makers for\nmathematical statements: mathematical objects and their corresponding\nproperties and relations (Benacerraf 1973).\nWe have here a major benefit of platonism. If one of the goals of\nthe philosophy of mathematics is to provide understanding of\nmathematics and mathematical practice, it is a significant advantage\nthat platonists are able to take the products of that\npractice\u2014such as mathematical theories\u2014literally and do\nnot need to rewrite or reformulate them. After all, the platonist is\nthen in a position to examine mathematical theories as they are\nactually formulated in mathematical practice, rather than discuss a\nparallel discourse offered by various reconstructions of mathematics\ngiven by those who avoid the commitment to mathematical objects (such\nas the nominalists).\nThe inability to take mathematical discourse literally is indeed a\nproblem for nominalists, who typically need to rewrite the relevant\nmathematical theories. As will become clear below, it is common that\nnominalization strategies for mathematics change either the syntax or\nthe semantics of mathematical statements. For instance, in the case of\nmodal structuralism, modal operators are introduced to preserve verbal\nagreement with the platonist (Hellman 1989). The proposal is that each\nmathematical statement S is translated into two modal\nstatements: (i) if there were structures of the suitable\nkind, S would be true in these structures, and (ii) it's\npossible that there are such structures. As a result, both the syntax\nand the semantics of mathematics are changed. In the case of\nmathematical fictionalism, in order to preserve verbal agreement with\nthe platonist despite the denial of the existence of mathematical\nobjects, fiction operators (such as, \u2018According to\narithmetic\u2026\u2019) are introduced (Field 1989). Once again,\nthe resulting proposal changes the syntax (and, hence, the semantics)\nof mathematical discourse. This is a significant cost for these\nviews.\n",
