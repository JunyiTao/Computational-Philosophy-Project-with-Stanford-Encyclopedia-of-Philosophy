    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Possible Worlds\n4.5 Possible Worlds\n\nIt is a very widely held view among contemporary philosophers that we\nneed to appeal to entities known as possible worlds in order\nto account for various phenomena. There are dozens of phenomena that\nphilosophers have thought should be explained in terms of possible\nworlds, but to name just one, it is often argued that semantic theory\nis best carried out in terms of possible worlds. Consider, for\nexample, the attempt to state the truth conditions of sentences of the\nform \u2018It is necessary that S\u2019 and \u2018It is\npossible that S\u2019 (where S is any sentence). It\nis widely believed that the best theory here is that a sentence of the\nform \u2018It is necessary that S\u2019 is true if and only\nif S is true in all possible worlds, and a sentence of the\nform \u2018It is possible that S\u2019 is true if and only\nif S is true in at least one possible world. Now, if we add\nto this theory the premise that at least one sentence of the form\n\u2018It is possible that S\u2019 is true \u2014 and this\nseems undeniable \u2014 then we are led to the result that possible\nworlds exist.\n\nNow, as was the case with numbers, properties, and sentences, not\neveryone who endorses possible worlds thinks that they are abstract\nobjects; indeed, one leading proponent of the use of possible worlds\nin philosophy and semantics \u2014 namely, David Lewis (1986) \u2014\nmaintains that possible worlds are of the same kind as the actual\nworld, and so he takes them to be concrete objects. However, most\nphilosophers who endorse possible worlds take them to be abstract\nobjects (see, e.g., Plantinga (1974, 1976), Adams (1974), Chisholm\n(1976), and Pollock (1984)). It is important to note, however, that\npossible worlds are very often not taken to constitute a new kind of\nabstract object. For instance, it is very popular to maintain that a\npossible world is just a set of propositions. (To see how a set of\npropositions could serve as a possible world, notice that if you\nbelieved in full-blown possible worlds \u2014 worlds that are just\nlike the actual world in kind \u2014 then you would say that\ncorresponding to each of these worlds, there is a set of propositions\nthat completely and accurately describes the given world, or is true\nof that world. Many philosophers who don't believe in full-blown\npossible worlds maintain that these sets of propositions are good\nenough \u2014 i.e., that we can take them to be possible\nworlds.) Or alternatively, one might think of a possible world as a\nstate of affairs, or as a way things could be. In so\ndoing, one might think of these as constituting a new kind of abstract\nobject, or one might think of them as properties \u2014 giant,\ncomplex properties that the entire universe may or may not possess.\nFor instance, one might say that the actual universe possesses the\nproperty of being such that snow is white and grass is green and San\nFrancisco is north of Los Angeles, and so on.\n\nIn any event, if possible worlds are indeed abstract objects, and if\nthe above argument for the existence of possible worlds is cogent,\nthen this would give us another argument for platonism.\n",
