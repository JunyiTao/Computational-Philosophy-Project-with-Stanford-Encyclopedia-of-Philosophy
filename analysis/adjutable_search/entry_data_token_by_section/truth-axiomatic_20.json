    "main_text": "Non-classical approaches to self-reference || Axiomatising Kripke\u2019s theory\n5.2 Axiomatising Kripke\u2019s theory\nKripke\u2019s (1975) theory in its different guises is based on partial\nlogic. In order to obtain models for a theory in classical logic, the\nextension of the truth predicate in the partial model is used again as\nthe extension of truth in the classical model. In the classical model\nfalse sentences and those without a truth value in the partial model\nare declared not true. KF is sound with respect to these classical\nmodels and thus incorporates two distinct logics. The first is the\n\u2018internal\u2019 logic of statements under the truth predicate\nand is formulated with the Strong Kleene valuation schema. The second\nis the \u2018external\u2019 logic which is full classical logic. An\neffect of formulating KF in classical logic is that the theory cannot\nbe consistently closed under the truth-introduction rule\n\n\n If \\(\\phi\\) is a theorem of KF, so is\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\).\n\n\nA second effect of classical logic is the statement of the excluded\nmiddle for the liar sentence. Neither the Liar sentence nor its\nnegation obtains a truth value in Kripke\u2019s theory, so the disjunction\nof the two is not valid. The upshot is that KF, if viewed as an\naxiomatisation of Kripke\u2019s theory, is not sound with respect to its\nintended semantics. For this reason Halbach and Horsten (2006) and\nHorsten (2011) explore an axiomatization of Kripke\u2019s theory with\npartial logic as inner and outer logic. Their suggestion, a\ntheory labelled PKF (\u2018partial KF\u2019), can be axiomatised as\na Gentzen-style two-sided sequent calculus based on Strong Kleene\nlogic (see the entry on many-valued\nlogic). PKF is formed by adding to this calculus the\nPeano\u2013Dedekind axioms of arithmetic including full induction and\nthe compositional and truth-iteration rules for the truth predicate as\nproscribed by Kripke\u2019s theory. The result is a theory of truth that is\nsound with respect to Kripke\u2019s theory.\n\nHalbach and Horsten show that this axiomatization of Kripke\u2019s\ntheory is significantly weaker than it\u2019s classical cousin KF. The\nresult demonstrates that restricting logic only for sentences with the\ntruth predicate can hamper also the derivation of truth-free theorems.\n\n",
