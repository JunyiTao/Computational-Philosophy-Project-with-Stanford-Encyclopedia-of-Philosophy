    "main_text": "The Nature of Imagination\n1. The Nature of Imagination\n\nA variety of roles have been attributed to imagination across various\ndomains of human understanding and activity\n (section 3).\n Not surprisingly, it is doubtful that there is one component of the\nmind that can satisfy all the various roles attributed to imagination\n(Kind 2013). Nevertheless, perhaps guided by these roles, philosophers\nhave attempted to clarify the nature of imagination in three ways.\nFirst, philosophers have tried to disambiguate different senses of the\nterm \u201cimagination\u201d and, in some cases, point to some core\ncommonalities amongst the different disambiguations\n (section 1.1).\n Second, philosophers have given partial taxonomies to distinguish\ndifferent types of imaginings\n (section 1.2).\n Third, philosophers have located norms that govern paradigmatic\nimaginative episodes\n (section 1.3).\n",
