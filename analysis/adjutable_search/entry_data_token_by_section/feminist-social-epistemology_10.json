    "main_text": "Epistemic Values, Ethics, and Democracy || Epistemologies of Ignorance\n4.2 Epistemologies of Ignorance\n\n\nFeminist epistemologists alongside critical race theorists have played\na prominent role in the development of epistemologies of ignorance, an\narea closely related to the work on epistemic injustice and epistemic\noppression. They have argued that epistemologists need to attend to\nthe role of ignorance as well as knowledge if they are to adequately\nunderstand the influence of power relations on epistemic matters.\nHermeneutical injustice offers an obvious example of how some forms of\nknowledge important to marginalized groups may be difficult or even\nimpossible to access as a result of systems of power relations that do\nnot support the development of the necessary conceptual resources for\nthat knowledge. Specific pockets of ignorance result from these\nsystematic power relations. Epistemologies of ignorance maintain that\nignorances are often not simply benign gaps in knowledge that have yet\nto be filled. Rather, ignorances can be actively constructed and can\nserve purposes of domination (Sullivan and Tuana 2007; Tuana and\nSullivan 2006). On this line of reasoning, the production of ignorance\nneeds to be understood as a substantive practice itself (Alcoff\n2007).\n\n\nOne of the goals of epistemologies of ignorance is to understand the\ncomplexity of the relations of ignorance and knowledge, mapping out\nvarious kinds of ignorances and developing normative frameworks to\nhelp understand when ignorances are problematic, and when epistemic\nagents should be held epistemically responsible for their\nignorances. Dotson notes that the ignorances to be concerned about are\nthose that are both reliable and pernicious (harmful) (Dotson\n2011). Clearly, not all forms of ignorance will be pernicious, nor\nwill they all be avoidable. Cynthia Townley has also argued for the\npositive value of ignorance in our epistemic practices, recognizing\nthat our rich relations of epistemic dependence require trust, which\nitself requires ignorance and a commitment to refrain from remedying\nit (2011, 23).  Furthermore, the specific epistemic relationships we\ndevelop with others require that certain forms of knowledge be shared\nwith some, but not others, calling into question any idea that the\nonly epistemic value is the acquisition of knowledge for oneself and\nothers (Townley 2003, 2011; Grasswick 2011). Feminists have also noted\nthe importance of \u201cstrategic ignorance\u201d through which the\noppressed can use \u201cdominant misconceptions as a basis for active\ncreative responses to oppression\u201d (Bailey 2007, 88). For\nexample, the oppressed may act in ways that conform to the\nexpectations of their dominators, pretending to lack intelligence\nperhaps, allowing access to information and resources that may help\nthem either resist or at least survive. Or the oppressed may engage in\nstrategic \u201crefusals to understand\u201d when such understanding\nwould conform to dominant constructions of their experience that\nundermine their agency (Pohlhaus 2011). Such work that draws attention\nto the complex roles of ignorance in our epistemic practices broadens\nthe range of epistemic values under consideration beyond the\nacquisition of truth to include consideration of how our ignorances\ncan at times be well placed. At the same time, it emphasizes the\nethical dimensions of the epistemic relationships with others that are\nso crucial to our knowing capacities.\n\n\nWhile there are various forms of ignorance to be investigated\n(Townley 2011), one that has occupied a good deal of feminist attention\nis \u201cinvested ignorance\u201d (Townley 2011) in which the\nignorance is \u201csystematically produced and sustained to\nmisrepresent reality in ways that not coincidentally sustain patterns\nof\u2026 privilege\u201d (Townley 2011, x). In their analyses of\ninvested ignorance, many feminists have built upon Charles\nMills\u2019s work on racial ignorance, in which he argues that whites\n(or other dominant groups) have a positive interest in misrepresenting\nthe world in ways that help support their dominant position (Mills\n1997, 2007). Mills conceptualizes whites as engaged in a kind of cognitive\ndysfunction that serves their purposes by preventing them from\nunderstanding the social relations of domination in which they are\nengaged, making it easier to maintain that domination. His work\nconnects closely with feminist standpoint theory in providing both an\nexplanation of the patterns of belief-forming practices that can result\nin an ignorance of the social relations of domination on behalf of the\nprivileged, and an explanation of the potential lack of motivation to\ncorrect such ignorance (Alcoff 2007).\n\n\nYet another line of investigation that has proved important for\nfeminist epistemologists concerns the mapping of the ways in which\nparticular culturally-embedded ignorances track the interests of\nmarginalized groups. For example, Nancy Tuana has examined the history\nof the science of female sexuality, arguing that structures of power\nhave played out in both constructing and maintaining the relative\nignorance of female sexuality compared with the knowledge of male\nsexuality (Tuana 2004). She has also argued that the women\u2019s health\nmovement of the 1970s that sought to make available to women knowledge\nof their bodies and expose those sexist and androcentric practices\nthat maintained an ignorance of their bodies is best understood as not\nonly a political resistance movement but an epistemological resistance\nmovement (Tuana 2006).  Given the feminist theme of the situated\nnature of knowing, feminists have argued that whatever knowledge is\nproduced, it is always both perspectival and limited. Work such as\nTuana\u2019s draws attention to the political forces that help direct the\nresearch and production of knowledge, shaping patterns of knowledge\nand ignorance.  Rather than simply focusing on the production of\nknowledge itself, an obvious question posed by feminists on such a\nsituated approach is: \u201cknowledge for whom?\u201d Issues of\nresponsibility concerning what kind of knowledge communities undertake\nto produce, and correspondingly what ignorance those same communities\nactively produce are unavoidable (Code 1991, 2006; Heldke\n2001). Whereas many epistemologists have noted that our epistemic\ngoals are best characterized not as the generation of truths per se,\nbut rather as the generation of significant truths (Kitcher 1993),\nfeminists working from a situated approach recognize that \u201cwhat\nis significant?\u201d can only be answered with reference to the\nquestions asked and the interests behind those questions (Anderson\n1995b). Feminists further note that differently located persons may\nhave quite different interests at stake concerning what questions need\nto be asked, what knowledge needs to be produced, and what ignorances\nmatter (Grasswick 2010). Questions then arise concerning to whom\nknowers take themselves to be accountable with respect to their\nchoices of knowledge and ignorance production (McHugh 2011; Code\n2011). For many feminist social epistemologists, the goal is to\ndevelop epistemic practices that don\u2019t simply generate an\nabundance of knowledge, but that generate sound and ethical patterns\nof knowledge and ignorance.\n\n\nThe development of epistemologies of ignorance has proved to be a\nfruitful framework through which feminists can articulate the\ncomplexities of the weaknesses of current (and past) epistemic\npractices and understand in detail the effects of power relations on\nthose practices. Recognizing the role of ignorance reframes their\nconception of epistemic goals, broadening them to include not just the\nacquisition of truths, but the development of reliable and significant\nknowledge for differently located people, with patterns of knowledge\nand ignorance that support healthy epistemic relations between\npeople.\n\n\nMany of the recent feminist analyses of epistemic injustice and\nepistemic ignorance combine to draw attention to another important\nfeature of our social epistemic relations: trust and\ntrustworthiness. Because of our epistemic dependence on each other,\ninquirers need to trust others for knowledge, and often must trust\nacross social locations. Structural features of epistemic injustice\nand invested ignorance create challenges for determining how to trust\nresponsibly (Grasswick 2014), and how to be a trustworthy knower for\nthose situated differently from oneself. Medina provides account of\nhow racial ignorance produces systematic distrust across racial lines\n(through racial insensitivity) and considers how one could become\naware of such insensitivities (Medina 2016). Recent work on implicit\nbias explores just how difficult it can be for a knower to become\naware of how they are perpetuating epistemic injustices (Brownstein\nand Saul 2016). How are we to respond to such challenging epistemic\nconditions? Feminists have taken different approaches. Daukas argues\nthat within social networks of inquiry, being trustworthy is a central\nvirtue (and requires being trustworthy in one\u2019s own inquiry, and being\na good judge of others\u2019 trustworthiness) (Daukas 2006). Yet\nFrost-Arnold argues that trustworthiness is more complex; in some\ncases, taking on the role of a trickster by betraying the trust of the\ndominant might be epistemically virtuous on the part of the\nmarginalized, when doing so disrupts the networks of trust that\nexclude the oppressed (Frost-Arnold 2014). Turning to the world of\nsocial media, Frost-Arnold also argues for the epistemic potential of\na strategy of \u201chopeful trust,\u201d wherein, in spite of the odds of\nexperiencing testimonial injustice and other wrongs, a marginalized\nperson posts about her interpretation of her experiences, in hopes of\nchallenging the ignorance of the dominant (Frost-Arnold 2016). These\nworks offer examples of how feminists tend to approach the role of\nepistemic trust and trustworthiness differently from other social\nepistemologists: by attending explicitly to the relevance of social\npositions and existing networks of trust wrought as they are with\nproblematic features of epistemic injustice and invested ignorance\nthat infect epistemic processes, and must be grappled with.\n",
