    "main_text": "Theories of the Right to Secede || Ascriptivist Theories\n2.3 Ascriptivist Theories\n\n\nAscriptivist theories, like their plebiscitary counterparts, hold\nthat secession rights are ultimately grounded in the value of\nself-determination and thus need not only be conferred on those who\nhave suffered severe injustice. Unlike plebiscitary theorists, however,\nproponents of ascriptivist views do not extend the right of\nself-determination to just any group. They argue instead that\nself-determination extends only to those groups that can be\ndistinguished by certain defining features- such as nationality,\nreligion, ethnicity, or other identities shared by the individuals that\nconstitute each group (Margalit and Raz 1990; Moore 1997; Miller 1995;\nMiller 1998). Though various ascriptivist theories insist on different\ncriteria that are used define the \u201cpeople\u201d or\n\u201cnation\u201d in question, they share the underlying claim that\nthe right to secede is motivated by the right to some kind of\nnational self-determination grounded in the unique moral\nclaims of individuals belonging to particular identity\n groups.[8]\n\n\n\nThis approach to unilateral secession has a long pedigree, reaching\nback at least to Nineteenth Century nationalists such as Mazzini, who\nproclaimed that every nation should have its own state. Critics of the\nascriptivist variant of primary right theory (Buchanan 1991, Gellner\n2008) argue that it would legitimize virtually unlimited unilateral,\nforcible border changes because it confers an entitlement to its own\nstate on every nation (or \u201cpeople\u201d or distinct society).\nFor reasons noted above this appears to be not only unfeasible, but a\nrecipe for increasing ethno-national conflict.\n\n\nHowever, those who advocate for the ascriptivist view reply that it\ndoes not require every nation (or distinct people) to exercise its\nunilateral right to secede and have conjectured that were their theory\ngenerally accepted not every group upon which it confers this\nentitlement would choose to secede. Nevertheless, given the historical\nrecord of ethno-nationalist conflict, the worry remains that\ninstitutionalizing the principle that every nation is entitled to its\nown state would exacerbate ethno-national violence, along with the\nhuman rights violations it inevitably entails. Thus, the moral costs of\nincorporating the ascriptivist version of primary right theory into\ninternational law may appear prohibitive\u2014especially if there are\nless risky ways to accommodate the legitimate interests of nations,\nsuch as better compliance with human rights norms and recourse to\nintrastate autonomy arrangements.\n\n\nThere are variants of the ascriptivist theory that go some distance\ntoward allaying the worry that acceptance of the theory would add fuel\nto the fires of ethno-national conflict by qualifying the unilateral\nright of secession for nations (or distinct peoples) in various ways.\nFor example, the ascriptivist may hold that there is a presumption in\nfavor of each nation or distinct people having a right to its own state\nif it so desires, or a prima facie unilateral right to secede\nfor all such groups, but acknowledge that the international legal\nsystem is justified in requiring some groups to settle for autonomy\narrangements short of full independence to avoid dangerous instability\nor to accommodate similar claims by other groups to the same territory.\nThis way of responding to the worry about adding fuel to ethno-national\nconflicts comes at a price: What was originally billed as a unilateral\nright of every nation as such to its own state now looks more like a\nhighly defeasible presumption in favor of independence for nations. And\nunless a fairly concrete account of the conditions under which the\npresumption is not defeated is provided, it is hard to know what the\npractical implications of this qualified ascriptivist view are. What is\nneeded is an account of how the putative presumption in favor of\nstatehood for nations is to be weighed against competing claims and\nvalues. So far, proponents of ascriptivist theories have not provided\nthis.\n\n\nEarlier, we observed that critics of the ascriptivist version of\nprimary right theories tend to focus on the potential costs in terms of\nexacerbated ethno-national conflict of incorporating the view into\ninternational law. However, it is not enough to note the potential\ncosts of acceptance of the ascriptivist theory and its incorporation\ninto international law. It is also necessary to understand the putative\nbenefits of having a system in which the rights of nations to their own\nstates are acknowledged. Accordingly, David Miller has usefully\ndistinguished two ways in which ascriptivist theories can be supported:\nby arguments to show that nations need states or by arguments to show\nthat states need to be mono-national (Miller 1995).\n\n\nThe first type of argument has two variants: One can argue that\nnations need to have their own states, either (1) in order to be able\nto protect themselves from destruction or from forces that threaten\ntheir distinctive character, or (2) in order for co-nationals to have\nthe institutional resources to be able to fulfill the special\nobligations they owe one another as members of an \u201cethical\ncommunity\u201d, in Miller\u2019s phrase. Both of these\nconsiderations can, under certain circumstances, weigh in favor of some\nform of political self-determination for nations, but it is not clear\nthat either is sufficient to ground a general right of all nations to\nfull independence and hence a unilateral right to secede. Indeed,\nMiller marshals them in support of a weaker conclusion: that nations\nhave a \u201cstrong claim\u201d to self-determination but does not\nspecify when the claim constitutes a full-fledged right.\n\n\nThe second type of justification for the view that nations are\nentitled to their own states also has two variants: The first, which\ndates back at least to John Stuart Mill\u2019s Considerations\nOn Representative Government (Mill [1861] 1991), asserts that\ndemocracy can only flourish in mono-national states, because states in\nwhich there is more than one nation will be lacking in the solidarity,\ntrust, or shared sentiments and values that democracy requires. The\nsecond, advanced by David Miller, asserts that states need to be\nmononational in order to achieve distributive justice, because\ndistributive justice requires significant redistribution of wealth\namong citizens and the better off will only be willing share their\nwealth with their less fortunate fellow citizens if they see them as\nco-nationals (Miller 1995). Both forms of the \u201cstates need to be\nmononational\u201d argument raise very interesting questions about the\nmotivational conditions necessary if crucial state functions are to be\nsuccessfully performed.\n\n\nMill apparently based his judgment that multination states are\nincompatible with democracy on historical experience. However, some\nwould argue that there are cases of multinational democratic states:\nCanada, Belgium, and perhaps Switzerland (depending upon whether one\nregards the last as multinational or merely multi-ethnic). One might\nalso add the United States, since most Indian tribes have a legal\nstatus that approaches sovereignty.\n\n\nOf course, modern proponents of Mill\u2019s argument would be quick\nto point out that the continued existence of Belgium and Canada are in\ndoubt due to nationalist secession movements. (However, at present the\nsecession of Quebec seems very unlikely). On the other hand, it could\nbe argued that Mill\u2019s generalization is prematurely pessimistic:\ngenuine democracies are a very recent phenomenon and until even more\nrecently there have been almost no serious attempts, even on the part\nof democratic states, to recognize the claims of nations within states,\nthrough various forms of autonomy \n arrangements.[9]\n So as a\njustification for acknowledging a right to independent statehood for\nall nations, with the risk of instability and violence this might\nentail, Mill\u2019s pessimism about multinational democracies may seem\nto some to be premature. The most reasonable strategy would seem to be\nto do more to ensure that states respect the human rights of their\nminorities and to encourage intrastate autonomy agreements rather than\ngiving up on the idea of multinational states.\n\n\nThe second version of the \u201cstates need to be\nmono-national\u201d argument also faces serious objections. First,\nwhether or not nationalism will facilitate or instead block large-scale\nredistribution of wealth will depend upon the character of the\nnationalism in question. Nationalist solidarity may not extend to\nwillingness to redistribute wealth. As socialists from Marx onward have\nobserved, the privileged minority has often been quite adept at\nappealing to nationalism to counteract the redistributive impulse.\nSecond, even in cases where nationalist sentiment facilitates\nredistribution, one must ask: what else does it facilitate? Miller\nappears to argue from the fact that a morally pristine, highly\nidealized nationalism would facilitate distributive justice (or\ndemocracy) to the conclusion that nations as such are entitled to their\nown states or at least to a presumption thereof. But there are many\nhistorical instances in which the national unity that Miller assumes\nwill be harnessed for the pursuit of distributive justice has been\nferociously directed toward conquest and against non-nationals and\ndissenting members of the nation itself.\n",
