    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Offense\n3.8 Offense\n\nAs we have seen, Mill distinguishes between merely offensive and\ngenuinely harmful behavior. Whereas genuinely harmful behavior can be\nregulated, merely offensive behavior cannot (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10,\n12; V 5). However, in his discussion of drunkenness, Mill does at one\npoint allow that offenses against others may be prohibited, at least\nwhen they involve acts of public indecency.\n\n\nAgain, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the\nagents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, if\ndone publicly, are a violation of good manners and, coming thus within\nthe category of offenses against others, may be rightly prohibited. Of\nthis kind are offenses against decency; on which it is unnecessary to\ndwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our\nsubject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case\nof many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so.\n(V 7)\n\n\nThe immediate context is otherwise paternalistic restrictions with\ndrink. But when drinking that is otherwise purely self-regarding is\ndone in public, it becomes offensive and, Mill here claims, regulable.\nIt seems impossible to square this with Mill\u2019s blanket\nprohibition on offense regulation. Why this exception for public\noffenses? Mill\u2019s answer is that when done in public, the conduct\ncomes \u201cthus within the category of offense against\nothers.\u201d But if publicity is relevant because it makes the\nconduct offensive, then Mill\u2019s real appeal is to offense. But\nthen this exception threatens to swallow the rule.\n\nMill may not have a consistent view about offense. It is instructive\nin this context to consider briefly the views of Joel Feinberg, who\nsees himself articulating a Millian position in his important\nfour-volume work Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\n(1984\u201388). Feinberg understands his own defense of Millian\nprinciples as involving a modified Millian categorical approach. His\nmain modification of Millian principles is to permit some forms of\noffense regulation. In Offense to Others (1985), Feinberg\nbegins by focusing on nuisance. Many offensive things are\nnuisances; they cause passing disagreeable mental states or\nsensations. But even if many nuisances are just the price one has to\npay to live in a free society, it is common for the law to regulate\nnuisance. Feinberg thinks that some nuisances\u2014especially public\nnuisances\u2014can justify regulation. To determine when offense\n(nuisance) regulation is permissible and when it is not, Feinberg\nemploys a balancing test in which we must weigh the\nseriousness of the offense (e.g., its magnitude and avoidability)\nagainst the importance of the agent\u2019s interests being regulated\n(e.g., their importance and the existence of alternative avenues of\nexpression).\n\nThe details of Feinberg\u2019s balancing test are complex and\npotentially controversial. But most liberal societies do in fact allow\nfor some nuisance regulation. If one is going to consider modifying\nMill\u2019s categorical approach so as to allow the prevention of\nprofound nuisance, then one must employ some such balancing test and\nallow restriction only when the offense is hard to avoid, the\nexpressive interests of the offenders are modest, and offenders have\nalternative avenues of expression. Since Mill\u2019s own position on\noffense regulation is not fully consistent, it is hard to say how big\na modification this would make in his liberal principles.\n",
