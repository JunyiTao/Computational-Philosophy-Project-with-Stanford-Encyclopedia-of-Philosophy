Classical Ecological Genetics, Population Size, and Natural Selection\n\nThe founding ecological geneticists dismissed any significant role for\nrandom genetic drift in evolution (see the entry on\n genetic drift).\n The theoretical interaction of random genetic drift and natural\nselection for single genes with constant effects can be seen in\n Figure 1.  Fisher in his evolutionary theory\n assumed that natural populations achieved or sustained very large\n sizes as seen in his correspondence with S. Wright (letter from\n R. A. Fisher to S. Wright, August 13, 1929, as quoted in Provine\n 1986: 255) where he stated that \u201cI believe N must\n usually be the total population on the planet, enumerated at sexual\n maturity\u201d. Similarly, according to his intellectual biographer\n W. Ewens: \n\n\nFisher never paid much attention to the concept [effective population\nsize] as he should have \u2026 and used extremely high population\nsizes (up to \\(10^{12})\\) in his analyses, surely far too large in\ngeneral. (2000: 33) \n\n\nFor such extremely large population sizes, the threshold between\nselection and drift (see\n Fig. 1),\n which is determined by the effective population size, \\(N_e\\), is too\nlower to matter evolutionarily. That is, the strength of random\ngenetic drift, which is proportional to (1/\\(2N_e)\\), is very, very\nweak and even genes with very small values of \\(s\\) have their\nevolutionary fate determined entirely by selection. This is the\nessence of \u201cFisherian gradualism\u201d\u2014very\nsmall selective forces given sufficient time can have effects on\nadaptation similar to those of genes with much larger effects acting\nover a shorter time period. With very large \\(N_e\\), the domain of\nrandom genetic drift is greatly restricted even as that of natural\nselection is expanded (see\n Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The interaction of Random\nGenetic Drift and Natural Selection. The strength of selection is\nmeasured by the selective effect, \\(s\\), of a single gene and the\nstrength of random genetic drift is indicated by \\((1/2N_e)\\), where\nthe population has effective size, \\(N_e\\). When \\(s\\) exceeds\n\\((1/2N_e)\\), then the evolutionary fate of a gene is determined\nprimarily by Natural Selection. When \\(s\\) is less than \\((1/2N_e)\\),\nthen the evolutionary fate of a gene is determined primarily by Random\nGenetic Drift. Thus, the evolutionary domains of natural selection\n(upper) and random genetic drift (lower) are separated by the wavy\nboundary determined by the effective population size. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHowever, ecological geneticists did not entirely dismiss\nrandom genetic drift as a significant evolutionary force for the same\nreasons that Fisher did. Field observations conducted with the\nmark-recapture methods developed by ecological geneticists documented\ngeneration-to-generation fluctuations in population size up to or\nexceeding an order of magnitude in most natural populations studied\nlong term. Thus, small local population sizes were not seen as unusual\nby ecological geneticists. Indeed, Ford believed that \n\n\n\u2026 organisms automatically generate their own cycles of\nabundance and rarity and that the changes in selection pressure with\nwhich these are associated many greatly increase the speed of\nevolution; (Ford 1975: 36) \n\n\nDespite the not infrequent occurrence of small population sizes where\ndrift would be expected to be most efficacious, random genetic drift\nwas still considered an irrelevant evolutionary force in ecological\ngenetics because natural selection was viewed as being particularly\nstrong during periods of population decline. That is, the strength of\nnatural selection was negatively correlated with population density.\nThus, as population size and \\(N_e\\) declined owing to environmental\nstress, natural selection gained in strength so that the boundary\nbetween domains\n (Fig. 1)\n always favored selection. The smallest populations showed little\nphenotypic variation, which was seen as evidence that they were the\nmost fit or most finely adapted populations. Thus, the lack of\nphenotypic variation in small populations was owing to it having been\neliminated by natural selection during the immediately prior period of\ndecline. Conversely, under periods of population increase,\nenvironmental stresses were minimal, so that natural selection was\nweaker and more permissive of variation. This concept of relaxed\nselection provided Ford with a cause for the increase in observations\nof rare phenotypic variants in large and growing natural populations.\nIf selection pressure increases inversely to population size, then the\nrole of random genetic drift in evolution must be greatly\nrestricted.\n\nIn addition, Ford (1975: 38) believed that ecological genetic research\nhad clearly demonstrated that the selective advantage of a gene in\nnature \u201c\u2026 quite commonly exceeds 25 per cent and is\nfrequently far more\u2026\u201d. Referring to\n Figure 1,\n this means that the range for values of \\(s\\) in natural populations\nlies significantly above 0.01, placing genes, even in very small\npopulations, firmly in the domain governed by natural selection.\n\nFurthermore, Ford considered that not only the strength but also the\nnature of selective pressures must frequently change with density\nbecause \n\n\n\u2026 an organism has not the same adaptive requirements when\nabundant as when rare, or when the plant and animal forms which\nimpinge on it are so. (Ford 1975: 39) \n\n\nIndeed, he thought that the fluctuating selection pressure caused by\nvariations in abundance \u201cinvalidates\u201d Wright\u2019s\nShifting Balance Theory of Evolution, which he referred to as\n\u201cfar-fetched\u201d. Interestingly, Ford and his colleagues\nbelieved that genetic subdivision of the sort postulated by Wright\nwould promote rapid evolution but for reasons very different from\nWright\u2019s and by different genetic mechanisms (natural selection\ninstead of random genetic drift, local selection, and interdemic\nselection). Ford (1975: 40\u201344) argued that subdivision of a\nlarge, geographically extensive population into relatively small\ngroups promotes rapid evolution because, \n\n\n\u2026 when populations occupy a series of restricted habitats they\ncan adapt themselves independently to the local environment in each of\nthem, while when spread over a larger area they can be adjusted [by\nnatural selection] only to the average of the diverse conditions which\nobtain there. This, however, requires that the adaptations should not\nbe constantly broken down by a trickle of immigrants from one small\ncolony to another. \n\n\nHere, he proposes a trade-off between specialized adaptation to local\nconditions in the absence of migration and generalized adaptation to\nglobal conditions in the presence of migration. In modern terms, this\nis called genotype-by-environment interaction, where the selective\neffect, \\(s\\), of a gene changes with change in the environment. A\ngene might be adaptive in one environmental context (i.e., \\(s \\gt\n0)\\) but maladaptive in another (i.e., \\(s \\lt 0)\\). Migration between\nlocal environments mixes the adaptive and maladaptive responses to\nselection and reduces the average magnitude of gene frequency change.\nIn this sense, genotype-by-environment interaction for fitness is\nviewed as an evolutionary constraint because it limits the rate of\ngene frequency change. The restraint can be removed simply by stopping\ngene flow and the mixing of genes across different local environments.\nThus, the fixed selective effect illustrated in\n Figure 1,\n must be considered an average of variable selective effects\nacross environments. Clearly, large local effects of opposite sign\nmust be averaged when there is gene flow among habitats and the\naveraging tends to reduce the magnitude of a gene\u2019s selective\neffect. Ford also suggests that the genetic mechanism involves\n\u201cgene complex[es] balanced to fit their own local\nenvironment\u201d. That is, he claimed interactions among genes, or\nepistasis, contributes to local adaptation. Thus, Ford invokes\ngenotype-by-environment interactions for fitness as well as gene-gene\ninteractions for fitness in his cases of rapid evolution, although\nboth reduce the average selective effect of a gene. This\nargument also runs counter to his assertion that the adaptive\nadvantage of a gene is typically 25 percent in natural populations.\nBoth kinds of interaction change the depiction of the threshold\nseparating natural selection from random genetic drift\n (Fig. 1);\n in fact they tend to raise it and thereby increase the domain of\nrandom genetic drift. Before turning to interaction effects, I will\nexamine a representative discussion of ecological genetics of random\ngenetic drift using data from a natural population.\n",
