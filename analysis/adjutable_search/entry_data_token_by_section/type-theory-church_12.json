    "main_text": "Automation || Early Proof Assistants\n4.2 Early Proof Assistants\n\nEarly computer systems for proving theorems of Church\u2019s type\ntheory (or extensions of it) include HOL (Gordon 1988; Gordon &\nMelham 1993), TPS (Andrews et al. 1996; Andrews & Brown 2006),\nIsabelle (Paulson 1988, 1990), PVS (Owre et al. 1996; Shankar 2001),\nIMPS (Farmer et al. 1993), HOL\nLight (Harrison 1996), OMEGA (Siekmann et al. 2006), and \u03bbClam\n(Richardson et al. 1998). See\n Other Internet References\n section below for links to further info on these and other provers\nmentioned later. \n\nThe majority of the above systems focused (at least initially) on\ninteractive proof and provided rather limited support for additional\nproof automation. Full proof automation was pioneered, in particular,\nby the TPS project. Progress was made in the nineties, when other\nprojects started similar activities, respectively, enforced theirs.\nHowever, the resource investments and achievements were lacking much\nbehind those seen in first-order theorem proving. Significant progress\nwas fostered only later, in particular, through the development of a\ncommonly supported syntax for Church\u2019s type theory, called TPTP\nTHF (Sutcliffe & Benzm\u00fcller 2010), and the inclusion, from\n2009 onwards, of a TPTP THF division in the yearly CASC competitions\n(kind of world championships for automated theorem proving; see\nSutcliffe 2016 for further details).\n",
