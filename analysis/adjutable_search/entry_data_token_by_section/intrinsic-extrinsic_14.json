    "main_text": "Attempts at Analysis || Contractionist Theories\n3.5 Grounding Theories\n\nOver the last few years, there have been a number of attempts to\nanalyse intrinsicality in terms of metaphysical grounding, a prominent\ninstance of which is that of Rosen (2010). Other accounts of\nintrinsicality in terms of grounding include those of Witmer, Butchard\nand Trogdon (2005), Trogdon (2009), Bader (2013), and Witmer (2014).\nFor a discussion of the first two of these accounts, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nMore on Grounding Theories of Intrinsicality.\n \n\nThe state of affairs of it being the case that \\(A\\) is grounded by\nthe state of affairs of it being the case that \\(B\\) iff \\(A\\) in\nvirtue of it being the case that \\(B\\), where the relevant notion of\n\u201cin virtue\u201d is meant to be a metaphysically explanatory\none. Grounding is supposed to be a metaphysical analogue of causation:\njust as causation is what connects the explanans of an explanation\nwith its explanandum in causal explanation, grounding is meant to be\nwhat connects the explanans of an explanation with its explanandum in\nmetaphysical explanation. An example of a metaphysical explanation\nwould be an explanation of why a certain type of act is wrong in terms\nof more fundamental moral facts.\n\nRosen\u2019s account presupposes Russellianism about facts, according\nto which facts are structured out of things, properties and operators\nin the same kind of way sentences are built up out of names,\npredicates and operator expressions. Given this background,\nRosen\u2019s analysis can be stated as follows:\n\n\\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\): (i) if\nthe ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a fact with\nconstituent \\(y\\), then \\(y\\) is part of \\(x\\); and (ii) if the\nnegation of the ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a fact\nwith constituent \\(y\\), then \\(y\\) is part of \\(x\\)\n\n\nGiven the negation of the ascription of being Obama to Clinton is\ngrounded by the negation of the ascription of identity to Obama and\nClinton (a claim plausibly required by Rosen\u2019s account) the\naccount classifies being Obama as non-intrinsic since Obama is not\npart of Clinton. The analysis also classifies intuitively\nnon-intrinsic indiscriminately necessary properties, such as the\nproperty of being such that there is a number, as non-intrinsic. Being\nsuch that there is a number is classified as non-intrinsic by the\naccount since, for example, its ascription to Obama is grounded by the\nfact that 2 is a number, which has a constituent, namely the number 2,\nthat is not part of Obama. These consequences of the account suggest\nthat it is best thought of as an account of the distinction between\nlocal and non-local properties.\n\nMarshall (2015) has given the following objection to Rosen\u2019s\naccount. (The objection is meant to generalise to all attempts to\nanalyse intrinsically in terms of grounding, including the attempts of\nWitmer, Butchard and Trogdon (2005), Trogdon (2009), Bader (2013) and\nWitmer (2014). For an objection that is meant to apply to\nRosen\u2019s account, but not Bader\u2019s account, see Bader\n2013:fn. 53.) According to the objection: a) there is nothing\nincoherent in supposing that a state of affairs that is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\) might ground a state of affairs that is intrinsically\nabout something that is wholly distinct from \\(x\\), and b) on a number\nof popular metaphysical theories, there are such grounding\nrelationships. If there are such grounding relationships, however,\nRosen\u2019s account fails.\n\nTo consider an example of such a grounding relationship, let us assume\nthat standard set theory is necessarily true, and that existence is a\nlocal property. (If one thinks that existence is not a local property,\nperhaps because one thinks that existence is the non-local\nquantificational property of being such that, among all the things\nthere are, there is something that is identical to one, replace\nexistence with the property of being such that, among all the parts of\none, there is something identical to one, which is intuitively local.)\nLet us also assume the common (though not universal) view that members\nof sets are not literally parts of those sets. (See Lewis (1986a) for\nan example of a prominent theory of sets that denies members of sets\nare parts of those sets.) Given these assumptions, it is plausible\nthat the fact that \\(\\{Obama\\}\\) exists is grounded by the fact that\nObama exists. However, if this is correct, then, since the fact that\nObama exists has a constituent that is not part of \\(\\{Obama\\}\\), it\nfollows that Rosen\u2019s account falsely classifies existence as a\nnon-local property.\n\nBorrowing from the recent account of Witmer (2014) (which is similar\nto Rosen\u2019s account), we might attempt to fix Rosen\u2019s\naccount by replacing parthood in the account with ontological\ndependence, where the relation of ontological dependence is defined by\n(20).\n\n(20)\n \\(x\\) ontologically depends on \\(y\\) iff the fact that \\(y\\)\nexists at least partly grounds the fact that \\(x\\) exists.\n\n\nApplying this modification to Rosen\u2019s account results in\n(21).\n\n(21)\n \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\):\n(i) if the ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a fact with\nconstituent \\(y\\), then \\(x\\) ontologically depends on \\(y\\); and (ii)\nif the negation of the ascription of \\(F\\) to \\(x\\) is grounded by a\nfact with constituent \\(y\\), then \\(x\\) ontologically depends on\n\\(y\\).\n\n\nThis modified version of Rosen\u2019s account appears to correctly\nclassify existence as a local property given the above metaphysical\ntheses. Given these metaphysical theses, however, it arguably ends up\nclassifying too many properties as local. For example, given the above\ntheses, it appears to classify the property of having a member as a\nlocal property. It does this, since, given the above metaphysical\ntheses, necessarily, if \\(x\\) has a member, then the fact that \\(x\\)\nhas a member is plausibly grounded by the fact that \\(y\\) is a member\nof \\(x\\), where \\(y\\) is some member of \\(x\\), and where \\(x\\) is\nontologically dependent on \\(y\\). Provided members of sets\naren\u2019t parts of those sets, however, the property of having a\nmember appears to be just as non-local as the property of having\nsomething be two meters away from one. \n",
