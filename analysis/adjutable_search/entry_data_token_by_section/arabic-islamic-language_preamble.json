    "main_text": "\nArabic logic is a philosophical tradition which has lasted from the\nmid-eighth century down to today. For many years, western study of\nArabic logic tended to concentrate on the early parts of its history,\nespecially on the Greek antecedents of Arabic logic, and on the\nwritings of the foundational philosophers, Alfarabi (d.\u00a0950),\nAvicenna (d.\u00a01037) and Averroes (d.\u00a01198). Recently,\nhowever, there have been notable excursions beyond these areas of\ntraditional concentration, and I make a special effort in this entry\nto mention the contributions of post-twelfth-century logicians to the\nphilosophical resolution of disputed\n points.[1] \nSection 1 of this entry gives some historical context for a vast\narray of logical works, and section 2 provides a number of texts as\nsamples of the philosophical arguments they contain. The philosophical\nassessment of the arguments is a task that is now underway in the\nsecondary literature, and I refer to some of these assessments in the\nnotes. My primary interest, however, is in presenting a set of texts\nwhich illustrate the trajectory of arguments carried on through a\nformative period of the discipline.\nMy own preferred term for the material I cover is \u201cArabic\nlogic.\u201d The term as I use it refers to a tradition of logic\nrooted in the texts translated from Greek into Arabic in a movement\nbeginning in the eighth century CE. The tradition gradually settled on\na set of technical terms with which to translate and discuss the\nAristotelian corpus and its associated late antique commentaries; it\nalso came to agree on what were the major problems in the corpus which\ndemanded resolution. Focussed at first on these problems, a continuous\nline of discussions has evolved and carried forward in one form or\nanother down to today.\nArabic logic can be said to be Islamic in two senses, both\u2014in\nmy opinion\u2014of limited significance. First, it is as a result of\nthe Muslim conquests from the seventh century on that Arabic came to\nbe the primary language of learning. Beyond determining the language\ninto which the founding texts of the movement were translated,\nhowever, the religion of the conquerors played no significant role in\nthe development of the subject. Secondly, the tradition of Arabic\nlogic after the thirteenth century was to find a place in the madrasa\neducation and, as a result, had to jostle with various Islamic\ndisciplines treating grammar, rhetoric and forensic argument; in the\nprocess, Arabic logic gave up its claims to deal with dialectical,\nrhetorical and poetical discourse. But by the time Arabic logic was\nestablished in the curriculum of the institutions of learning, most of\nthe formal aspects of what was forever after to be called\n\u201clogic\u201d (mantiq) had already crystallised.\nBeing conducted in Arabic is\u2014on my\nunderstanding\u2014neither necessary nor sufficient for a logic to be\nconsidered Arabic logic. The problematic of Arabic logic has been\nadopted and its register of technical terms calqued or translated into\nother languages such as Persian, Turkish, Hebrew and Urdu. To take one\nof many possible examples, Nas\u00eer al-D\u00een\nal-T\u00fbs\u00ee's As\u00e2s al-Iqtib\u00e2s, though\nwritten in Persian, was apt for exact rendition in Arabic in the\nfifteenth century precisely because it was Arabic logic written in\nanother language. By the same token, other traditions of logic have\nbeen conducted in Arabic but are not, on my usage, Arabic logic. The\nmodern logic in the tradition inaugurated by Frege taught in most\nmodern Arab universities, often in Arabic, is not Arabic logic. So\ntoo, if it is true that eighteenth-century Maronites wrote logical\ntreatises in Arabic based solely on the logic they had studied in\nRome, they were writing Latin logic in Arabic, not Arabic logic.\n\n",
