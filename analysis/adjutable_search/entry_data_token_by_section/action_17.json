    "main_text": "The Ontology of Actions || Making, Acting, and the Varieties of Agency\n5.4 Making, Acting, and the Varieties of Agency\n\nNearly all contemporary philosophers treat intentional action\nas a unified category. Despite the many differences between moving a\nfinger, running, hammering a nail, fixing a fridge, eating a sandwich,\nacting justly, keeping a promise, and marrying someone, all of these\nare treated as equally belonging to a single type: acting. The\nassumption is supported by natural language. After all, these are all\nlegitimate answers to the question \u201dWhat are you\ndoing?\u2019.\n\nAristotle provides us with an alternative view that has had immense\ninfluence in philosophy. Throughout his writings, Aristotle\ndistinguishes between \u201cmaking\u201d or \u201cproducing\u201d\n(po\u00ed\u00easis) on the one hand, and\n\u201cacting proper\u201d (praxis) on the other (an early\nversion of the distinction appears in Plato\u2019s Charmides\n163a\u2013c). The two are distinguished by their success conditions\n(EE 5.2/NE 6.2 1139b1\u20134; EE 5.5/NE\n6.5 1140b6\u20137). The success conditions for makings are external\nto them: one succeeds at making insofar as something external to the\nmaking obtains (the product). By contrast, the success conditions for\nproper actions are the actions themselves. This is why we pursue them\nfor their own sake (ib.). By this standard, the activities of\nhammering a nail, or fixing a fridge count as makings, because the\nhammering is successful insofar as something external takes place: a\nnail is hammered in a wall, or a fridge is fixed. Precisely because\nthe success conditions are external, it is possible to succeed at\nmaking something by luck (EE 5.4/NE 6.4\n1140a17\u201320). By contrast, Aristotle would regard acting justly,\nkeeping a promise, or marrying someone as proper actions. To succeed\nat these actions consists in doing the actions well. A coerced\nmarriage is not a successful marriage. Hence, these actions cannot be\ndone by luck. This distinction underlies the aforementioned\ndistinction between two forms of human excellence in the practical\nsphere: skill (techn\u00ea) is excellence at making\n(EE 5.4; NE 6.4 1140a6\u201323), and practical\nwisdom (phron\u00easis) is excellence at acting proper\n(EE 5.5/ NE 6.5 1140a25\u201330 et passim).\n\nAlthough the distinction is barely mentioned in analytical philosophy,\nit has influenced other traditions, such as the Marxist one. From his\nearliest writings, Marx accepts an Aristotelian threefold analysis of\nlabour in terms of the labourer, the process of labouring, and its\nproduct. Marx implicitly rejects the distinction between action proper\nand production, in favour of a dichotomy of his own between different\nforms of productions. This is because for Marx the characteristic\nactivity of the human species is conscious free labouring: an activity\nthat has no end beyond itself (it does not seek anything beyond the\nliving activity that such labouring consists in) (Marx 1844a; 1844b;\n1867). This is what Aristotle took as the distinguishing feature of\nproper actions, done for their own sake. One of Marx\u2019s central\ncriticisms of capitalist societies is that it prevents humans from\nengaging in such an activity. In capitalist societies, the labourer,\nthe labour process, and the product all become commodities that serve\nas mere means for the enjoyment of the owner of labour and product\n(\u201cthe capitalist\u201d). Members of capitalist societies are,\nin this sense, alienated (Marx 1844b; 1867). As such, capitalist\nsocieties make it impossible for humans to engage in their most\nfundamental life activity of free production, an activity that the\nMarxist tradition came to designate as \u201cpraxis\u201d (Petrovic\n1983), reappropriating the quite different Aristotelian notion.\n\nPerhaps the most influential modern version of a distinction among\ntypes of practical activity is drawn by Arendt (1998). Arendt\ndistinguishes between three kinds of practical activities: labour,\nwork, and action. The most basic of these is labour, which\nArendt conceives as simply an extension of our animal lives: a\n\u201cmetabolism\u201d (Marx\u2019s phrase) between the human\nanimal and the world, characterized by a cycle of consumption and the\nproduction of goods to be consumed, and aiming at meeting our basic\nbiological needs (p.69). Since this is a cycle, Arendt suggests that\nthere is no sense of speaking here of means and ends: there is no fact\nof the matter as to whether the production of goods is for the sake of\nconsumption, or the consumption for the sake of production (p.145;\n155). Means and ends enter at the next level of practical activity,\nwork (the Aristotelian po\u00ed\u00easis). Like\nAristotle, Arendt takes the aim of working to be the finished work,\nthe product, whether it be a work of art, like a painting, a tool,\nlike a knife, or a way to safeguard living, like a house. The central\nimportance of work lies in its ability to produce lasting products\nthat lie beyond the activity of the producer (p.136; 144). Arendt\ncontends that these products can begin to shape an objective\nworld of objects that stands against the humans who produce\nthem. However, the world does not emerge in its fullness except by way\nof the third level of practical activity, action (the\nAristotelian praxis). Action is the means by which humans\nreveal themselves in the public sphere, a revelation needed to give\nreality to a personality that otherwise remains entirely unactualized\nin subjectivity. It is thus essentially communicative, and depends on\nother humans to whom one might make herself known (pp.38\u201349; 95;\n202\u20137); and it depends, given its essential ephemeral nature,\nfor its permanence in the continued existence of a polity that may\npreserve words and deeds in more enduring forms, like sculptures and\ntales. Ungoverned by either the natural laws of labor, or by the norms\narising from a particular aim, action is for Arendt unproductive,\nfree, and unpredictable. It is the distinguishing activity of human\nbeings as such (p.177; 204\u20136).\n\nThe three-fold distinction serves as the basis for Arendt\u2019s\ncriticisms of both ancient writers, including Aristotle, and modern\nwriters, including Marx. She criticizes Aristotle both for\ninconsistently assimilating action too much to work/production in his\nanalysis of benefaction as producing a work (ergon) (p.196),\nand for subordinating it to theory (22\u201323). She criticizes\nMarx\u2019s subsumption of practical activity in general under labour\nfor its failure to provide meaning. She notes that Marx ends in the\nparadoxical position of concluding that that the aim of labour is\nfreedom from labour, even though this is the activity he takes as\ndefinitive of humanity. In other words, Marx ends up concluding that\nthe aim of human life is to do away with human life (p.89; 103; 105).\nFor Arendt, however, this is not merely a theoretical deficiency, but\na manifestation of a broader social tendency that goes back to Plato:\nthe tendency to try to make action proper into that which is\nnot\u2014whether work or labour\u2014to control what is essentially\nunpredictable and free.\n\nThe problems of subsuming practical activity in general to making find\nechoes in some contemporary thinkers. For example, Thompson (2008),\nfollowing Baier (1970) and Mueller (1979), criticizes attempts like\nCasta\u00f1eda\u2019s (1970) and Chisholm\u2019s (1970) of\nconstruing actions in terms of a schemas such as \u2018bringing it\nabout that p\u2019; such propositional complexes, according\nto critics, threaten to undermine the practical form of the thought\nthey mean to capture (cf. Hornsby 2016, Wilson 1980, pp.111\u2013117 for\nfurther discussion). Arendt herself thought that this tendency\nunderlay the attraction of utilitarianism, but she argued that, like\nMarxism, that view was incapable of ever giving further meaning to our\npractical endeavours (p.105). Korsgaard concludes with equal severity\nthat given a distinction between praxis and po\u00ed\u00easis,\n\u201cutilitarianism is not a moral theory, for utility is a property\nof [productions], not actions\u201d (2009, p.18n26).\n\nRegardless of what one thinks of these arguments, it is evident that\nthe question whether practical activity comes in varieties, as\nAristotle and Arendt thought, is potentially of enormous\nsignificance.\n",
