    "main_text": "Art as Experience || Against \u201cThe Museum Conception of Art\u201d\n2.2 Against \u201cThe Museum Conception of Art\u201d\n\nDewey\u2019s critique of a position that he calls \u201cthe museum\nconception of art\u201d is one of the most famous parts of his\naesthetic theory. It is for him a textbook example of the kind of\ncompartmentalizing attitude toward art which his naturalism seeks to\novercome. In Dewey\u2019s rendering, the museum conception of art by\nand large corresponds to the modern idea of fine art which emerged in\nthe eighteenth century and which received its most theoretically\ndeveloped account in Charles Batteux\u2019s The Fine Arts Reduced\nto a Single Principle (Les Beaux Arts r\u00e9duits \u00e1\nun m\u00eame principe, 1746). Around this time, the different\narts were gradually seen to form a unified group separate from the\nsciences, religion, and most importantly from the practical arts. The\nidea of the autonomy of art surfaced. Art was considered a\nself-regulating field for which the different art institutions, which\nwere emerging simultaneously, provided a setting. As opposed to the\npractical arts, such as embroidery and shoe making, whose value\ndepended on the external goals they served, the fine arts were\nconsidered to have their own intrinsic measures of value, which could,\nmoreover, be realized in full only within the spaces of the developing\nart institutions.\n\nThe museum conception also represents a more general tendency Dewey\nsees in philosophical theory, \u201cthe philosophical fallacy\u201d.\nWith this term Dewey refers to a set of preconceptions underlying\ninquiry which frame research and guide its progress before any\nconscious inquiry has even taken place. In aesthetics, the fallacy\nhas, in Dewey\u2019s view, taken the form that art and the aesthetic\nmust necessarily be something separate from ordinary everyday\nmodes of experience and activity. This is an assumption to which any\naesthetic inquiry must fit itself. As in other fields of philosophy,\nthe cure to the fallacy in the case of aesthetics is to look at\nexperience more carefully, in particular at the ways in which\naesthetic experience emerges from the common patterns of all\nexperience, which Dewey\u2019s naturalism examines.\n\nDewey thinks there are historic reasons why the idea of art as\nsomething essentially autonomous from other areas of life became so\ndominant. He traces these back to the rise of nationalism and\ncapitalism. Both of these developments, in his view, reinforced the\ninclination to set art \u201cupon a remote pedestal\u201d apart from\nother activities and modes of experience (AE: 11). The\nconception of art connected to nationalist and imperialist tendencies\nrendered museums into \u201cthe beauty parlor[s] of\ncivilization\u201d, (AE: 346) where each nation exhibited\nits greatest artistic achievements and, as in some cases, also its\nartistic loot. Artworks received \u201ca holier-than-thou\u201d\naura, which reinforced their esoteric character as something opposed\nto everyday life (AE: 15). Dewey also refers, in an unusually\nspiteful tone, to \u201cthe nouveaux riches\u201d of his time, whom\nhe thinks collected expensive artworks merely for the sake of\nbuttressing their social statuses with little care for their artistic\nvalue and for engaging with them aesthetically. All this meant for\nDewey that works of art were in danger of becoming mere stale\n\u201cart products\u201d instead of artworks that actually\ndo something \u201cwith and in experience\u201d (AE:\n9).\n\nDewey believes that there have been no winners in this development:\nart is concealed or \u201cwrapped\u201d, to follow the terminology\nof contemporary Deweyan, Richard Shusterman (Shusterman 1992), in a\nrealm of its own separate from people\u2019s everyday needs, values,\nand attitudes. To achieve a genuine aesthetic experience required\nleaving this everyday package behind and entering the confined\nsettings of the museum and other institutions of art. In Dewey\u2019s\nview, the resulting discrepancy between aesthetics and more mundane\nareas of life is not restricted to theory. It has \u201cdeeply\u201d\naffected \n\n\nthe practice of living, driving away esthetic perceptions that are\nnecessary ingredients of happiness, or reducing them to the level of\ncompensating transient pleasurable excitations. (AE: 16) \n\n\nThe result has been an \u201cesoteric idea of fine art\u201d\n(AE: 90) and a conception of the everyday as something\ninherently unaesthetic.\n\nThe many examples of non-Western art Dewey discusses in Art as\nExperience are especially important parts of his argument for\nrestoring the continuity between art and life, releasing it from the\nyoke of the museum conception of art. For the ways aesthetic practices\nand artifacts are incorporated into the very center of daily life and\ncommon rituals in many such cultures show that aesthetically\nsignificant objects do not require any special institutional setting.\nAccording to Dewey, such everyday objects as \u201cdomestic utensils,\nfurnishings of tent and house, rugs, mats, jars, pots, bows,\nspears\u201d were essential parts of the life of a community and had\na key role for example in \n\n\nthe worship of gods, feasting and fasting, fighting, hunting, and all\nthe rhythmic crises that punctuate the stream of living. (AE:\n14) \n\n\nArt then for Dewey is a far older phenomenon than the modern concept\nof fine art; it has its origins already in the world of \u201carchaic\nman\u201d and should be seen as \n\n\nan extension of the power of rites and ceremonies to unite men,\nthrough a shared celebration, to all incidents and scenes of life.\n(AE: 275).\n\n",
