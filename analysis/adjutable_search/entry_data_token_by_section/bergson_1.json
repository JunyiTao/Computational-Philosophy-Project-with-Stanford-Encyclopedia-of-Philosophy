    "main_text": "The concept of multiplicity\n2. The concept of multiplicity\n\nThe concept of multiplicity has two fates in the Twentieth Century:\nBergsonism and phenomenology (Deleuze, 1991, pp. 115\u2013118). In\nphenomenology, the multiplicity of phenomena is always related to a\nunified consciousness. In Bergsonism, \u201cthe immediate data of\nconsciousness\u201d (les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la\nconscience) are a multiplicity. Here, two prepositions,\n\u201cto\u201d and \u201cof,\u201d indicate perhaps the most basic\ndifference between Bergsonism and phenomenology. Of course, this\nphrase is the title of Bergson\u2019s first work, Essai sur les\ndonn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience. The standard\nEnglish title of this work is Time and Free Will: An Essay on the\nImmediate Data of Consciousness. It is the text that Sartre\nclaimed attracted him to philosophy.\n\nTime and Free Will has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for\nwhom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time. Bergson\nthinks that Kant has confused space and time in a mixture, with the\nresult that we must conceive human action as determined by natural\ncausality. Bergson offers a twofold response. On the one hand, in\norder to define consciousness and therefore freedom, Bergson proposes\nto differentiate between time and space, \u201cto un-mix\u201d them,\nwe might say. On the other hand, through the differentiation, he\ndefines the immediate data of consciousness as being temporal, in\nother words, as the duration (la dur\u00e9e). In the\nduration, there is no juxtaposition of events; therefore there is no\nmechanistic causality. It is in the duration that we can speak of the\nexperience of freedom.\n\nFor Bergson, we must understand the duration as a qualitative\nmultiplicity \u2014 as opposed to a quantitative multiplicity. As the\nname suggests, a quantitative multiplicity enumerates things or states\nof consciousness by means of externalizing one from another in a\nhomogeneous space. In contrast, a qualitative multiplicity consists in\na temporal heterogeneity, in which \u201cseveral conscious states are\norganized into a whole, permeate one another, [and] gradually gain a\nricher content\u201d (Time and Free Will, p. 122). Bergson\neven insists that the word \u2018several\u2019 is inappropriate to\nqualitative multiplicity because it suggests numbering. In Time\nand Free Will, Bergson provides examples of a quantitative\nmultiplicity; the example of a flock of sheep is perhaps the easiest\nto grasp (Time and Free Will, pp. 76\u201377). To constitute\na quantitative multiplicity, which is always done out of a practical\nor utilitarian interest, one ignores the content of the space the\nitems occupy, which results in the space being homogeneous. In the\ncase of the flock of sheep, one ignores the fact that the pasture in\nwhich they are feeding is beautiful and the fact that the sheep are\nnot strictly identical to one another. One focuses on what they have\nin common. What one is interested in is the total number of sheep, be\nit for meat or wool production. We are able to enumerate them because\neach sheep occupies a discernable location within the field, because\nthey are juxtaposed to one another. Of course, the enumeration of the\nsheep is represented by a symbol, a number. Similarly, a calendar or a\nclock is a homogeneous form of time.\n\nThe idea of qualitative multiplicities is difficult to understand,\nalthough it is the heart of Bergson\u2019s thinking. Normally, we\nwould think that if there is heterogeneity, there has to be\njuxtaposition. But, in qualitative multiplicities, there is\nheterogeneity and no juxtaposition. Qualitative multiplicities are\ntemporal; qualitative multiplicity defines the duration. As with\nquantitative multiplicities, Bergson gives us many examples. But\nperhaps, the most significant example is the feeling of sympathy\nbecause, in the 1903 \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d\nBergson defines intuition as sympathy. Here, in Time and Free\nWill, he calls it a moral feeling (Time and Free Will,\n18\u201319). Our experience of sympathy begins, according to Bergson,\nwith us putting ourselves in the place of others, in feeling their\npain. But, Bergson continues, if this were all, the feeling would\ninspire in us abhorrence of others, and we would want to avoid them,\nnot help them. But then, one realizes that, if one does not help this\npoor wretch, it is going to turn out that no one will come to my aide\nwhen I need help. There is a \u201cneed\u201d to help the suffering.\nFor Bergson, these first two phases are \u201cinferior forms of\npity.\u201d In contrast, true pity is not so much fearing pain as\ndesiring it. It is as if nature committed a great injustice and what\nwe want is not to be seen as complicitous with it. As Bergson says,\n\u201cThe essence of pity is thus a need for self-abasement\n[s\u2019humilier], an aspiration downward\u201d into pain.\nBut, this downward aspiration develops into an upward movement into\nthe feeling of being superior. One feels superior because one comes to\nrealize that one can do without certain sensuous goods. In the end\nhowever, one feels humility, humble since one no longer needs and\ndesires such sensuous goods. By denying ourselves of these goods, we,\nin a way, reestablish justice. Later in the 1932 Two Sources of\nMorality and Religion, Bergson shows that the feeling of sympathy\nin fact progresses to the point of love for all things. In any case,\nthe feeling of sympathy is \u201ca qualitative progress.\u201d It\nconsists in a \u201ctransition from repugnance to fear, from fear to\nsympathy, and from sympathy itself to humility.\u201d There is a\nheterogeneity of feelings here. The feelings are continuous with one\nanother; they interpenetrate one another, and there is even an\nopposition between inferior needs and superior humility. If we tried\nto juxtapose the feelings, that is, separate them spatially, the\nfeelings would have a different nature than when they interpenetrate.\nThere would be no progress from one to the other. They would be\nisolated psychic states. Therefore, for Bergson, a qualitative\nmultiplicity is heterogeneous (or differentiated), continuous (or\nunifying), oppositional (or dualistic) at the extremes, and, most\nimportantly, temporal or progressive (an irreversible flow). Bergson\nalso calls the last characteristic of temporal progress mobility; this\ncharacteristic truly distinguishes duration from space, which is an\n\u201cimmobile medium\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 180).\nFinally, because a qualitative multiplicity is heterogeneous and yet\ninterpenetrating, it is inexpressible. The continuous and\nheterogeneous multiplicity of consciousness is given immediately, that\nis, without the mediation of symbols (Bergson 1992, 162). For Bergson\n\u2014 and perhaps this is his greatest insight \u2014 freedom is\nmobility. Because Bergson connects duration with mobility, in the\nsecond half of the Twentieth Century (in Deleuze and Foucault, in\nparticular), the Bergsonian concept of qualitative multiplicity will\nbe dissociated from time and associated with space (Deleuze 1986).\n\nIn \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d Bergson gives us three\nimages to help us think about the duration and therefore qualitative\nmultiplicities (The Creative Mind, pp. 164\u201365). The\nfirst is that of two spools, with a tape running between them, one\nspool unwinding the tape, the other winding it up. (During his\ndiscussion of Bergson, Heidegger focuses on this image in his 1928\nThe Metaphysical Foundations of Logic.) Duration resembles\nthis image, according to Bergson, because, as we grow older, our\nfuture grows smaller and our past larger. The benefit of this image is\nthat it presents a continuity of experiences without juxtaposition.\nYet, there is a drawback: because a tape moves between the two spools,\nthe image presents the duration as being homogeneous, as if one could\nfold the tape back over its other parts, as if the tape were\nsuper-posable, implying that two moments in consciousness might be\nidentical. Yet, as Bergson says, \u201cno two moments are identical\nin a conscious being\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 164).\nDuration, for Bergson, is continuity of progress and heterogeneity;\nmoreover, thanks to this image, we can also see that duration implies\na conservation of the past. Indeed, for Bergson and this is the center\nof his truly novel idea of memory, memory conserves the past and this\nconservation does not imply that one experiences the same\n(re-cognition), but difference. One moment is added onto the old ones,\nand thus, when the next moment occurs, it is added onto all the other\nold ones plus the one that came immediately before. In comparison,\ntherefore to the past collection of moments, it cannot be the same as\nthe one immediately before, because the past is \u201clarger\u201d\nfor the current moment than it was for the previous moment. Although\nBergson does not say this, one might say that Tuesday is different\nfrom Monday because Monday only includes itself and Sunday, while\nTuesday includes itself, Monday, and Sunday. This first image,\ntherefore, implies that duration is memory: the prolongation of the\npast into the present. We shall return to the question of memory\nbelow.\n\nThe second image of qualitative multiplicity is the color spectrum. We\nsaw in the first image of the spools that there is constant difference\nor heterogeneity. The color spectrum helps us understand this, since a\ncolor spectrum has a multiplicity of different shades or nuances of\ncolor. Here we have heterogeneity, but there is a drawback to this\nimage as well. We lose the characteristic of continuity or unity since\nthe spectrum has colors juxtaposed. As Bergson says, \u201cpure\nduration excludes all idea of juxtaposition, reciprocal exteriority\nand extension\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 164).\n\nBergson\u2019s third image is an elastic band being stretched.\nBergson tells us first to contract the band to a mathematical point,\nwhich represents \u201cthe now\u201d of our experience. Then, draw\nit out to make a line growing progressively longer. He warns us not to\nfocus on the line but on the action which traces it. If we can focus\non the action of tracing, then we can see that the movement \u2014\nwhich is duration \u2014 is not only continuous and differentiating\nor heterogeneous, but also indivisible. We can always insert breaks\ninto the spatial line that represents the motion, but the motion\nitself is indivisible. For Bergson, there is always a priority of\nmovement over the things that move; the thing that moves is an\nabstraction from the movement. Now, the elastic band being stretched\nis a more exact image of duration. But, the image of the elastic is\nstill, according to Bergson, incomplete. Why ? Because, for him, no\nimage can represent duration. An image is immobile, while duration is\n\u201cpure mobility\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 165).\nLater, in Creative Evolution, Bergson will criticize the new\nart of cinema for presenting immobile images of movement. As Deleuze\nwill show in his cinema books, however, Bergson does not recognize the\nnovelty of this artform. Cinema does provide moving images. In any\ncase, in \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d Bergson compares\nall three images: \u201cthe unrolling of our duration [the spool] in\ncertain aspects resembles the unity of a movement which progresses\n[the elastic], in others, a multiplicity of states spreading out [the\ncolor-spectrum].\u201d Now we can see that duration really consists\nin two characteristics:\u00a0 unity and multiplicity. This double\ncharacteristic brings us to Bergson\u2019s method of intuition.\n",
