    "preamble": "\n\nThe study of gender in Confucian philosophy is a complicated task,\nsince there is no conceptual equivalent of \u201cgender\u201d in the\nChinese linguistic construct. Instead of deriving from a set of\nnatural dispositions or bodily functions, man and woman in the\nConfucian textual tradition are kinship- and ritual-dependent. The\nprocess of genderization where a person becomes a socially\nrecognizable \u201cman\u201d (nan \u7537) or\n\u201cwoman\u201d (n\u00fc \u5973) is concomitant with\nthe process of ritualization where gender differentiation is embedded\nin various familial/social roles marked along the lines of\n\u201cinside\u201d (nei \u5167) and \u201coutside\u201d\n(wai \u5916). The sphere of nei, when it is\ncoupled with woman, denotes a restrictive ritual and physical boundary\nthat is mainly concerned with household management and familial roles\nof wife and mother. Women of talents and virtues who are able to\ntransgress the restrictive ritual boundary of nei into the\nexpansive realm of wai are few and far between.\n\nBeyond examining the \u201cstandard\u201d canonical Confucian texts,\nthe incorporation of historical records of women\u2019s biographies\nsuch as the biographies of \u201cexemplary women\u201d\n(lien\u00fc \u5217\u5973) and the didactic texts for\nwomen such as the Four Books for Women (N\u00fcsishu\n\u5973\u56db\u66f8) in the discussion of gender is necessary,\nsince Confucianism\u2014the inexact translation of its Chinese\ncounterpart, Ru \u5112\u2014is not a study of a singular\nthinker; rather it is a family of thoughts with an extensive and\ndiverse textual tradition. This uniquely women-centric literary genre\nnot only provides us with a wealth of women\u2019s biographical\nrecords and perspectives but also offers a rare window into the\nemergence of gender-based consciousness legitimizing both female\nreadership and female authorship, despite the fact that advanced\nliteracy is ritually reserved for men only. This is one of the\nparadoxical fallouts from these conservative didactic texts that aim\nat fostering female dependency and compliance to patrilineage.\n\nThe prioritization of patrilineage underpins the Chinese family system\nand is codified in various ritual practices. The marriage rite, for\ninstance, has two different meanings for men and women. For women,\nmarriage is an occasion of exodus from her natal family and hence her\npersonhood/womanhood hinges on her ability to fully integrate into her\nhusband\u2019s patrilineage. For men, marriage serves two ritual\nfunctions: ensuring the continuity of sacrificial services in his\nancestral hall, and posterity. And since only patrilineage counts,\nhaving a male heir is of utmost importance not just for men, but also\nfor new brides and mothers-in-law alike who oftentimes participate in\ngender oppressive practices in order to amass sufficient resources, to\nproduce or acquire the coming of a male heir. Footbinding, although\nunconnected to Confucian philosophy textually, nonetheless is a\npopular entrance into the study of gender oppression in pre-modern\nChina. The familiar exoticization of footbinding is a clear case of\n\u201corientalism\u201d seeing non-western cultures as barbaric and\noppressive to the so-called \u201cthird-world\u201d women.\n\nDismissing the ethical valence of non-western traditions as devoid of\nfeminist potential, if not outright anti-feminist, is a common\nsentiment in feminist discourse inter-culturally. This is true in the\ncontemporary feminist engagement with Confucian philosophy as well.\nPushbacks against this feminist caricature of Confucianism from the\nChinese-comparative communities began to surface around the mid-1990s,\nfirst focusing on the positive comparison between care ethics and\nConfucian ren \u4ec1, and then expanding into possible\nConfucian applications to various contemporary issues such as\nabortion, same-sex marriage, elder care, etc. Building on this\npositive feminist engagement with Confucian philosophy, here proposed\nis a hybrid feminist theory\u2014Confucian feminism\u2014using\nConfucian terms, methods, and concerns as a theoretical basis to\naddress women\u2019s issues, experiences, and concerns in the\ncontemporary world. This hybrid feminist theory is a forward-looking\nproject intended to spur further positive feminist engagement with\nConfucian philosophy in order to formulate diverse and viable\nconceptual tools for women to envision their own liberatory future\nbeyond the confine of the western philosophical canon.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. \u201cGender\u201d in Translation\n\nThe trouble with the study of gender in Confucian philosophy begins\nwith the concept of \u201cgender\u201d as an analytic category for\nfeminist theorizing. The term \u201cxingbie\n\u6027\u522b\u201d (natural differences) or \u201cshehui\nxingbie \u793e\u6703\u6027\u522b\u201d (societally\nconstructed natural differences) now used to translate\n\u201cgender\u201d is a neologism introduced during the 1990s as a\nlocal, internal response to the importation of western feminist\ntheories (Spakowski 2011: 31\u201354; Dai 2019: ch. 12; S. Y. Chan\n2023). Whatever the concept of \u201cgender\u201d stands for in\ncontemporary feminist discourse, it does not have a clear, ready-made\nChinese counterpart in its linguistic memories, ancient or modern.\nPrior to the 1990s, the term \u201cn\u00fcxing\n\u5973\u6027\u201d (woman/female nature) is the closest\napproximation used to designate a sense of universal\n\u201cwomanhood\u201d or the \u201cfemale sex\u201d outside their\nkinship roles. And, just like the later variants of\n\u201cxingbie\u201d and \u201cshehui\nxingbie\u201d used to translate the concept of\n\u201cgender\u201d, \u201cn\u00fcxing\u201d is also a\nneologism constructed during the 1920s by the May Fourth Movement as\npart of their modernization project to mark the end of the indigenous\nrepresentation of \u201cwomen\u201d as fun\u00fc\n\u5a66\u5973 (married women and young maidens) (C. S. Chan 1988:\n19\u201339; Barlow 1989, 1994a,\n 1994b).[1]\n\nAccording to the earliest etymological dictionary, Discussing\nWriting and Explaining Characters (Shouwen jiezi), the\ncharacter n\u00fc \u5973 was defined synonymously as\nfu \u5a66 (married women). The overlapping of\nn\u00fc \u5973 and fu \u5a66 points to the\nprioritization of kinship roles in the process of genderization.\nGenerally speaking, n\u00fc refers to daughters or young\nmaidens, a life-stage before becoming fu. The synonymy of\nn\u00fc \u5973 and fu \u5a66 (as well as\nnan \u7537 and zhangfu \u4e08\u592b, i.e.,\nhusband) as defined by the Shouwen jiezi, hence, can be seen\nas a linguistic clue to the Chinese conception of nann\u00fc\n\u7537\u5973 (man/woman), who are essentially fufu\n\u592b\u5a66 (husband/wife) in waiting.\n\nThe concept of \u201cwomen\u201d or \u201cgender\u201d as a\nkinship-neutral discursive category hence is absent in the Chinese\nintellectual traditions including Confucianism. The lack of an\nindigenous linguistic equivalent of \u201cgender\u201d or\n\u201cwomen\u201d, to some (as it is for the May Fourth thinkers in\nthe 1920s as well as for some contemporary feminists who seek to bring\nChinese women\u2019s movements into the fold of the global feminist\nmovements), serves as an indication of the conceptual inadequacy, if\nnot backwardness, of Chinese society to articulate gender and to\ncontribute to this very modern project of feminist\ndiscourse/movements. But, for others, the imposition of western\nconceptual paradigms distorts the subject matter at hand and\nconsequently misconstrues the roots of gender oppression as well as\nits possible solutions in the study of gender in Confucianism (Hall\n& Ames 1998: 79\u2013100; 2000: 75\u201396; Rosenlee 2006). This\nlinguistic trouble of \u201cgender\u201d serves to highlight the\nconceptual chasm in the inter-cultural discourse of\n\u201cConfucianism\u201d, which itself is also a much debated\ninexact translation of Ru \u5112 (Jensen 1997; Standaert\n1999; Barrett 2005; Csikszentmihalyi 2020; Richey 2023)\n2. Yin-Yang \u9670\u967d Correlative Cosmology\n\nMen and women in Confucian philosophy are properly\n\u201cgendered\u201d when they are ritualized to embody a series of\nfamilial/social roles; their genderization is not derivative from a\nset of kinship-neutral inborn traits, as the way \u201cman\u201d or\n\u201cwoman\u201d as a conceptual category functions in the\ncontemporary western discourse. Nevertheless, the equivocation of\nyin/yang \u9670\u967d and femininity/masculinity has\nbecome a popular analytic entrance into the study of gender in\nConfucian philosophy. Numerous scholars have attributed gender\noppression and the misogynistic strains in Confucian philosophy to the\ncorrelation of yin with women and yang with men.\nDong Zhongshu\u2019s Luxurious Dews of the Spring and Autumn\n(Chunqiu fanlu; 2nd century BCE\ntext)\u2014especially Ch. 43: \u201cYang the Venerable,\nYin the Lowly\u201d and Ch. 53: \u201cBasic Meaning\u201d\nwhere one finds the exaltation of yang and the devaluation of\nyin\u2014is named as the culprit transforming the supposedly\nmore egalitarian, textual presentation of gender relations in the\npre-Han era to the decisively patriarchal bent of Han Confucianism\n(Csikszentmihalyi 2003: 163\u201364; R. Wang 2005; Pang-White 2018:\n8\u201310). On the flip side, the Daoist texts that consistently\nfavor yin over yang are said to suggest the\npossibility of a matriarchal past or at least a maternal matrix\n(Needham 1956: 105; Chen 1969: 401\u201305; Wawrytko 2000:\n163\u201398; Lee 2014: 57\u201377). Such theoretical postulation of\na matriarchal past based on the textual presence of a favorable\nyin over yang, however alluring, runs the risk of\nover-interpretation as well as the risk of oversimplification of the\nissue of gender relations as a matter of yin-yang\ncosmology.\n\nYin-yang\u2014as most prominently a Daoist concept, but also\nbroadly shared in many different schools of thought including\nConfucianism\u2014unlike the western oppositional binary of\nfemininity-masculinity, is not primarily, exclusively, nor invariably\na gender-based concept (Rubin 1982; Graham 1986; Black 1989). Rather,\nyin-yang\u2014that functions as an organizational cosmic\nschema\u2014is applicable to gender, but itself is cross-gender and\nbeyond gender. Yin and yang exist only in relation\nto one another internally as the way warmth-coldness only exist\nrelative to one another. Furthermore, when using yin-yang as\nan organizational schema, achieving balancing harmony is always the\ngoal, not domination nor subordination of one to the other. And hence\nyin-yang at its face value cannot even function as a\ntheoretical explanation for gender oppression where women are\nsubordinated to and dominated by men. The focus on the\nyin-yang cosmology yields little that is useful in the study\nof gender in Confucian philosophy.\n3. Nei-wai \u5167\u5916 and Gendered Differentiation\n\nSince being a man or a woman is concomitant with one\u2019s\nembodiment of familial/social roles through ritual learnings, the\ninterrogation of how these roles are inscribed ritually would be a\nmuch more fruitful way into the study of gender in Confucian\nphilosophy. Ritualization marks not only the beginning of the process\nof genderization, but more fundamentally the beginning of\nhumanity/civility. The concept of xing \u6027\u2014a\nstand-in for human nature or animal nature\u2014is not what sets one\nclass of people apart from the other, or humans from\n animals.[2]\n As Confucius said in the Analects, \u201cBy nature we are\nsimilar; learned habits set us apart\u201d (17.2; for other\ntranslations see Ames & Rosemont 1998). Similarly, according to\nthe Xunzi,\n\n\nAs regards to raw material, nature, awareness and capability,\njunzi and petty persons are equal [\u2026] Rather, it is\nthe way they employ these to make decisions make them different.\n(Xunzi 4.9; for other translations see Knoblock & Zhang\n1999)\n\n\nSages and the rest of us are of the same kind (lei \u985e),\nand there is little distinguishing difference between humans\n(ren \u4eba) and birds/beasts (qinshou\n\u79bd\u7378), since raw materials and in-born propensities are\npossessed in common by humans and animals\n alike.[3]\n Ritual (li \u79ae) differentiation (bie \u522b)\nis that slight differentiation separating humans from animals.\nAccording to the Xunzi,\n\n\nThe reason why humans are human is [\u2026] because they have the\nability to make distinctions. Whereas birds/beasts have father and\nson, they don\u2019t have the affection between father and son; and\nwhereas birds/beasts have male and female (pinmu\n\u725d\u7261), they don\u2019t have the differentiation between\nman and woman (nann\u00fc \u7537\u5973). Hence, the way\nof humanity cannot be without distinctions. (Xunzi 5.9)\n\n\nThe most important distinction that humans make, as the same passage\ngoes on to say, is ritual differentiation (Xunzi 5.10).\n3.1 Nei-wai as Gendered Spheres\n\nRitual differentiation gives rise to role differentiation, and among\nthem, gender role differentiation (nann\u00fc zhibie\n\u7537\u5973\u4e4b\u5225 or fufu youbie\n\u592b\u5a66\u6709\u5225) is foundational. As it is said in\nthe Book of Rites (Liji),\n\n\nFrom the distinction between man and woman came the righteousness\nbetween husband and wife. From the righteousness between husband and\nwife came the affection between father and son. From the affection\nbetween father and son came the rectitude between ruler and minster.\nHence it is said, \u201cThe marriage rite is the root of other ritual\nobservances\u201d. (Liji, \u201cHunyi\u201d\nchapter; for other translations see Legge 1885)\n\n\nGender role differentiation, in turn, is marked along the spatial\nbinary of inside-outside (nei-wai \u5167\u5916).\nAccording to the Book of Changes (Yijing),\n\n\nIn the Family (Jiaren \u5bb6\u4eba) hexagram, a\nwoman\u2019s correct place is in the nei and man in the\nwai, that men and women occupy their correct places is the\ngreat righteousness of heaven and earth [\u2026] Let the father be\nthe father, the son son, the brothers brothers, the husband husband,\nthe wife wife, then the way of family will be correct; when the family\nis correct then the world will be secured. (Yijing,\n\u201cJiaren\u201d hexagram,\n\u201cTuanzhuan\u201d commentary; for other translations\nsee Legge 1882)\n\n\nGender role differentiation corresponding to the spatial binary of\nnei-wai, hence, lays the groundwork for all other\nhuman relations\u2014be familial or political\u2014to follow.\n\nThe nei-wai binary - much like the yin-yang binary -\nis correlative, overlapping, as well as cross- and beyond-gender. But\nunlike the cosmic concept of yin-yang, nei-wai is\nprimarily a spatial concept demarcating both ritual and physical\nboundaries. This inside-outside spatial demarcation doesn\u2019t mean\nthat nei is inferior to wai. On the contrary,\nnei is the focused center on which one anchors in order to\nproceed to or retract from the wai. Even though the\nnei-wai spatial boundary is ever shifting and overlapping\ndepending on one\u2019s proximity to the focused center (Yu 1986; Ko\n1994; Ames 1994; Hay 1994), whatever counts as nei is\nnecessarily and invariably encircled by the expansive sphere of\nwai. The sphere of nei is necessarily and invariably\na defined inside marking whatever outside of it as wai.\nHence, the spatial concept of nei-wai, when it is coupled\nwith gender role differentiation, draws a much more restrictive\nsphere\u2014both ritually and physically\u2014for women compared to\na more expansive sphere for men where advanced literary learning,\nnon-familial roles, and service to the wider world including\nofficialdom are located.\n\nAccording to the Book of Songs (Shijing), the gender\nmarking of nei-wai signifying the spheres of domesticity and\nofficialdom respectively begins as soon as a child is born: a boy is\nclothed in robes, placed on couches to sleep and given [official]\nscepters to play with, whereas a girl is clothed in wraps, laid on the\nground to sleep, and given [weaving] tiles to play with\n(Shijing, Song 189 \u201cSigan\u201d; for other\ntranslations see Legge 1876). Similarly, in the Liji, the\nbirth of a boy is signaled by placing a bow (i.e., archery as one of\nthe six arts in the Confucian educational curriculum for men) on the\nleft side of the door, whereas a girl\u2019s birth is marked by a\nhandkerchief (i.e., weaving/embroidering as part of women\u2019s work\nin the four womanly virtues, side \u56db\u5fb7) on the\nright side of the door. Children are to begin their self-conscious\nembodiment of these gender roles at age seven when boys and girls\ncease to sit together nor eat together on the same mat, and at age\nten, their educational curricula begin to diverge widely: a boy is to\nventure out seeking worthy mentors to broaden his education befitting\nhis anticipated expansive responsibilities both as a husband and as a\nscholar-knight (shi \u58eb), whereas a girl is engaged in\nhomebound training for an enclosed, domestic life befitting her\nanticipated role as a congenial, pleasant, understanding, and\ncompliant wife (Liji, \u201cNeize\u201d\nchapter).\n3.2 The Ritual Confinement of Nei\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that to say a woman is marked as a person\nof nei training for her anticipated domestic roles of wife\nand mother is not the same as to say that these familial roles are\nsomehow insignificant ethically in Confucian philosophy. On the\ncontrary, the highest accolade for a benevolent ruler is called\n\u201cthe father and mother of the people\u201d (minzifumu\n\u6c11\u4e4b\u7236\u6bcd) indicative of parental\n parity.[4]\n The Confucian reverence for the role of mother is best shown in the\nenduring maternal icon of Mengmu (mother of Mencius) perpetuated in\ncountless didactic texts for women. Furthermore, the marriage rite,\nthat commences the spousal relationship, as proscribed in the\nLiji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d chapter, dignifies\nthe bride by requiring the groom to perform the job of a servant\nstanding by the carriage and handing the bride the strap to assist her\nin mounting. This ritual gesture is meant to convey the reverence that\nthe husband owes to the wife, since spousal affection is built on\nmutual respect and a harmonious household is foundational to a secured\nworld. As explained in the Liji, \u201cwith respect there\ncomes affection; it is with this spousal affection that the sage kings\nare able to secure the world\u201d (Liji,\n\u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\n chapter).[5]\n\nFurthermore, unlike many of the canonical thinkers in the western\nintellectual tradition from Socrates down to Kant where the inherent\ninferiority of women\u2014not in terms of the roles that women play,\nbut their in-born nature as such (e.g., the \u201cRe-Reading the\nCanon\u201d series of the Pennsylvania State University\nPress)\u2014are explicitly stated, Confucian philosophy offers no\nsuch articulation of women\u2019s in-born inferior nature, moral or\notherwise. Much of the depiction of virtuous women in the antiquity\nperiod, such as Liu Xiang\u2019s Exemplary Women\u2019s\nBiographies (Lien\u00fc zhuan; c. 18 BCE), consistently\napplies the same moral and intellectual accolades to women as they do\nto men. In other words, women in Confucian philosophy are not inferior\nby nature, nor are their gender roles indicative of their inferior\nnature.\n\nMuch of the gender hierarchy in Confucianism is derived from the\ngender markings along the spatial as well as ritual boundary of\nnei-wai. Once again, this is not to say that nei is\ninferior to wai; being associated with nei does not\nautomatically make women inferior to men, nor does the gender\nassociation of woman with nei devalue nei (Goldin\n2009: 371\u201374). But using nei-wai as a mark of gender\ndifferentiation does dictate which sphere one should inhabit.\nGender-based hierarchy is, first and foremost, embedded in the spousal\nrelationship, since the role of a wife is to follow and the\nhusband\u2019s is to lead. As the same Liji passage on the\nmarriage rite quoted earlier goes on to say,\n\n\nIn passing the front door gate, the man precedes and the woman\nfollows, and with this the right relation between husband and wife\ncommences. (Liji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\nchapter)\n\n\nTo follow and to lead indicate more than just complementary role\ndifferentiations; they indicate power differentials as well: the one\nwho leads takes charge and the one who follows cannot initiate or\ndictate the direction of the union. Wifely subordination is both\nfunctional and gender-based. In marriage\u2014just as in any\ninstitution\u2014there are inevitable role differentiations, but the\nspousal hierarchy is gender-based, instead of capacity, merit, or age\nbased. As a person of nei, a woman can only express her\nlife\u2019s work through ritualized familial roles (i.e., daughter,\nwife, and mother); there are no non-familial roles available to her\nwithout first being mediated and thereby legitimated by the men of her\nkin. That meditating requirement constricts what is deemed possible\nfor a woman to be a properly gendered person.\n\nUnlike men, women have no non-familial roles\u2014such as friend\n(you \u53cb), scholarly knight (shi \u58eb),\nruler (jun \u541b), or minster (chen\n\u81e3)\u2014available to them. For instance, even to make friends\nand maintain friendship outside one\u2019s kin pose quite a challenge\nfor women, since the notion of \u201cfriend\u201d (you\n\u53cb) and \u201ctravel\u201d (you* \u6e38) are\nsynonymous at\n times.[6]\n For a woman to travel outside the bound of her household, it not only\nraises logistic challenges, but more importantly, requires additional\njustifications for her ritual transgression. The ritual requirements\nfor women not to traverse the bounds of the domestic are dictated in\nvarious\n Classics.[7]\n To transgress that\u2014or any ritual boundary\u2014compelling,\ncircumstantial justifications are required. Hence the gender marking\nof nei makes all non-familial roles prima facie out\nof reach for women.\n\nThe famed case of Confucius as a traveling scholarly knight spending\ndecades wandering around different states to propagate his moral\nvisions and collecting friends and disciples along the way was beyond\nthe reach for any equally talented and virtuous woman. There was\nsimply no legitimate, ethical, or normative route for women to partake\nin governance exercising political authority, except through marriage\nand only in service of patrilineage such as occupying the position of\na dowager or as the kin of a high ranking official. And even then, it\nwas problematic and precarious at best. As shown in the\nAnalects 8.20, Confucius discounted King Wu\u2019s wife as\namong the ten capable ministers (chen \u81e3) that King Wu\nboasted to have. Or, as recorded in the Analects 6.28,\nConfucius felt compelled to explain himself with a dramatic appeal to\ntian \u5929 as his witness of ritual propriety to Zilu who\nwas displeased by the encounter between Confucius and Nanzi\u2014a\npowerful concubine of Duke Ling of Wei (r. 534\u2013492\nBCE)\u2014audaciously calling herself a little\n lord![8]\n3.3 Traversing the Nei-Wai Boundary: The Case of Ban Zhao\n\nBan Zhao (c. 45\u2013117 CE) was the first and foremost Confucian\nwoman scholar-official\u2014one of the few exceptions where women\nwere able to have remarkable achievements in the wai\ncomparable to their male counterparts, despite the structural\nlimitations of nei. Ban Zhao came from a long line of erudite\nfamilies: both of her great-great-grandfather and great-grandfather\nheld imperial scholarly degrees; her grandfather and great-uncle were\ncourt scholar-officials, and so were her father and eldest brother;\nher second brother was a famed frontier governor-general granted the\nrank of marquis and her son was also a court official granted the rank\nof marquis. Lastly, her great aunt, her mother, her younger\nsister-in-law, and her daughter-in-law were equally erudite. Ban Zhao\nwas given an advanced education immersed in classical learning by both\nof her father and mother, and after the death of her eldest brother,\nshe was summoned by Emperor He (r. 89\u2013105 CE)\u2014though\nwithout the official title\u2014to complete the imperial account of\nthe History of Han. Serving as a de facto grand\nimperial scholar, Ban Zhao was in charge of the instruction of not\nonly the palace women and princesses, but also her ten male colleagues\nin the imperial library, including Ma Rong who later became a famed\nscholar as well as his brother Ma Xu (Swann 1932 [2001: 17]). After\nthe emperor\u2019s death, Ban Zhao also served as a close advisor to\nEmpress Dowager Deng (r. 106\u2013121 CE) who was then the de\nfacto ruler since the reigning emperor was still an infant (Swann\n1932 [2001: 43]; Pang-White 2018: 32). No other virtuous and talented\nwoman outside the royal family had managed to achieve the same\nposition ever since.\n\nBeyond the political, the pristine preservation of Ban Zhao\u2019s\nAdmonition for Women (Nujie; c.106 CE) is equally\nimpressive, considering the scarcity of women\u2019s records in\nantiquity. Furthermore, this treatise despite its overall conservative\nbent, is probably the earliest extant text in human history advocating\nfor equal education for women (Swann 1932 [2001: xvii]). Ban\nZhao\u2019s advocacy for women\u2019s education, in turn, provided a\nhistorical precedent and a much needed justification for virtuous and\ntalented women to engage in classical learning that was ritually\nreserved for men. Indeed, for many subsequent generations of women\nfrom empresses to widowed commoners, Ban Zhao held the esteemed\nposition as the first teacher for women as Confucius was for men\n(Swann 1932 [2001]; Pang-White 2018).\n\nAs remarkable as it was, Ban Zhao\u2019s ascendancy in the realm of\nwai was first and foremost made possible through her familial\nluck, not through the socially sanctioned venues available to many men\nof talents. Being born into a long line of erudite families that could\nspare precious resources to educate her for no apparent social\nutility, and being widowed at a young age allowed Ban Zhao to\nvirtually live a life of letters and governance as her male\ncounterparts did. Without such familial luck, it would be unthinkable\nfor women to leave a mark in the realm of wai without\nincurring significant social costs. This is one of the many inevitable\nfallouts from the nei-wai gender marking that generates\nstructural impediments for women to leave their marks in the realm of\nliterary culture and state governance.\n\nThe outward expansion of one\u2019s virtuous influences in a\nconcentric fashion from self, family, state, to the world at large in\norder to bring about the idyllic state of \u201cgreat harmony\u201d\n(datong \u5927\u540c) is the highest spiritual goal of\nConfucianism (Liji, \u201cLiyun\u201d chapter).\nAfter all, Confucius spent decades leaving his family behind and\nrisking his own life instructing rulers and disciples alike all in an\neffort to moralize the world around him beyond his own family. Being\nthus confined to the realm of nei, denied all non-familial\nroles, and deprived of all normative routes to operate and excel in\nliterary culture and state governance, a woman\u2019s moral\npersonhood, thus construed, is essentially curtailed and dependent on\nthe men of her kin.\n4. Female Dependency and Didactic Texts for Women\n\nAs a person of nei, ritually speaking, a woman is without\nrank, title, or name of her own. And hence it is by necessity that a\nwoman throughout her life cycle is dictated by the doctrine of\n\u201cthree-fold following/dependency\u201d (sancong\n\u4e09\u5f9e): when young, she follows her father, when married,\nher husband, when widowed, her sons. The advantage of translating\ncong \u5f9e as following/dependency instead of obedience is\nthat the principle of generational seniority is one of the mitigating\nfactors in the Chinese gender system where not only is the position of\nmother accorded with accolades textually and ritually, but also is in\nactual possession of a tremendous amount of power over the sons\nhowever grand the sons\u2019 social stations may be: emperors,\ngenerals, prime ministers, or famed scholars.\n\nThe iconic maternal model of Mengmu\u2014the widowed mother of\nMencius\u2014is a case in point. As recorded in the Exemplary\nWomen\u2019s Biographies (Lien\u00fc zhuan) 1.11,\nMencius was displeased with his wife for what he perceived as her lack\nof ritual propriety in their private quarter; instead of sending her\ndaughter-in-law back to her natal family, Mengmu reprimanded Mencius\nfor his own lack of ritual propriety by entering their private quarter\nwithout first announcing himself as the instigating cause of this\nfamilial discord (for translation see Kinney 2014). It is clear from\nthis famed tale of Mengmu that the widowed mother continued to\nexercise her maternal authority over the adult son, overriding his\ndecisions even on his spousal relations. Nonetheless, even a revered\nwidowed mother is still ritually a person without rank, title, or name\nof her own. The iconic case of Mengmu is after all memorialized as the\nmother of Mencius who went on to achieve great literary and political\nfame!\n4.1 Sancong \u4e09\u5f9e and Side \u56db\u5fb7\n\nA woman\u2019s dependency on men throughout her entire life cycle is\ncodified ritually, textually, but also by necessity, given the fact\nthat no other socially sanctioned venues to the realm of wai\nare open to her. The teaching of sancong \u4e09\u5f9e\nfirst appears in the Liji and is widely circulated in the\nlater Confucian\n texts.[9]\n As explained in the Liji in conjunction with the marriage\nrite:\n\n\nWomen are the ones who follow others; when they are young they follow\ntheir fathers and elder brothers, when they are married they follow\ntheir husbands, and when their husbands die they follow their sons.\n\u201cHusband\u201d denotes supporter. A husband uses wisdom to lead\nothers. (Liji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\nchapter)\n\n\nTo be compliant was generally advised as the way of married women. As\nrecorded in the Mencius, \u201cTo look upon compliance\n(shun \u9806) as their correct course is the way of married\nwomen\u201d (3B2; for other translations see Lau 1970 [2003]).\n\nSince marriage is the only socially sanctioned venue open to women, to\nsuccessfully navigate the marriage life is essential for women; the\nteaching of \u201cfour [womanly] virtues\u201d (side\n\u56db\u5fb7) is meant to explicitly spell out four essential\nareas for women\u2019s self-cultivation, much like the teaching of\n\u201cfive social relations\u201d (wulun \u4e94\u502b)\nfor men as they journey outward from family, state, to the world at\nlarge (Mencius 3A4; Zhongyong, Ch. 20;\nDaxue). The teaching of side was first introduced in\nthe Liji as an intensive three-month training curriculum for\nthe bride-to-be in the context of the marriage rite; the betrothed\nyoung maiden is to be instructed on four areas of being a wife:\nvirtue, speech, comportment, and work (Liji,\n\u201cHunyi\u201d chapter). And Ban Zhao\u2019s\nN\u00fcjie then provided a clear summation and explanation of\nwhat each area consists of.\n\nThe basic tenet of side is diligence and sincerity; these\nfour areas of self-cultivation are achievable ideals for women in much\nthe same way as the virtue of ren \u4ec1 is an achievable\nideal for Confucius. As Ban Zhao wrote,\n\n\nThese four are women\u2019s utmost virtues, therefore one cannot be\nwithout them. With intentional sincerity, they are easy to accomplish.\nConfucius is said to have commented: \u201cIs ren far? If I\ndesire ren, ren is here. This is what it\nmeans\u201d. (N\u00fcjie, Ch. 4:\n\u201cFuxing\u201d; also see Analects 7.30)\n\n\nThe parity of side for women and ren as the highest\nConfucian ideal (for men) is clear. Even though the virtue of\nren is non-gendered in Confucian texts, the necessary\nconcentric expansion of one\u2019s moral cultivation from family,\nstate, to the world at large is not accessible to women, and hence in\neffect, the highest achievable moral ideal for women is side,\nthat focuses on practical training in the areas of ritual propriety,\ncautious speech, modest comportment, and household management in the\nroles of wife and mother.\n4.2 Women\u2019s Education and N\u00fcshishu \u5973\u56db\u66f8\n\nThe cultivation of women\u2019s domestic roles in the nei as\non par with men\u2019s expansive moral cultivation in the\nwai is propagated partly through the literary genre of the\n\u201cdidactic texts for women\u201d that are written for, of, and\nby women. Ban Zhao\u2019s N\u00fcjie (c. 106 CE) is the\ninaugurating text, which, by and large, focuses on the limited\ndomestic roles and ritual trainings for women emphasizing modesty,\npleasing compliance, spousal fidelity, resourcefulness, and diligent\nservitude to patrilineage. The overall conservative bent of this\nliterary genre contrasts greatly with the emergence of gender-based\nconsciousness as its natural fallout from a literary genre that gives\njustifications to not only female readership, but also female\nauthorship and hence also provides justifications for advanced\nliterary education for women as well.\n\nIn order to advocate for an equal educational curriculum for women,\nBan Zhao in Chapter two of the N\u00fcjie appealed to the\ntextual authority of the Liji to lay claim that girls at age\neight should begin their literary education and by age fifteen should\nbe given advanced classical education, despite the contrary was stated\nin the cited text. In the Liji, \u201cNeize\u201d\nchapter, two separate educational curricula for boys and girls are\nexplicitly laid out: girls are to learn only basic literacy of numbers\nand objects, and by age ten while boys begin their classical education\nwith outside mentors, girls cease to venture out. Instead, girls\nshould focus on the domestic trainings of cooking, weaving, and food\npreparation in addition to mastering pleasing speech and compliance.\nServing equivalently as the grand imperial scholar, Ban Zhao would be\nhighly unlikely ignorant of the ritual injunction stated in the\nLiji; Ban Zhao\u2019s textual subversion for the sake of\nequal education for women was then obviously intentional. The\nradicality of Ban Zhao\u2019s advocacy for educational parity,\nhowever, was clothed under the conservative rhetoric of husbandly\nleadership and wifely servitude: husband should lead the wife with\nvirtue and wife should serve the husband with virtue, and hence both\nshould be equally educated (N\u00fcjie, Ch. 2; for\ntranslation see Swann 1932 [2001]; Pang-White 2018). Setting aside the\nmany possible reasons for Ban Zhao\u2019s conservatism, the irony\nthat women should be given advanced education on par with men so that\nthey can serve men better is not lost here.\n\nNonetheless, Ban Zhao\u2019s advocacy for educational parity itself\nbecame a historical precedent and a much needed justification for many\nvirtuous and talented women in subsequent generations to continue\npursuing a life of literary learning and authorship in a society where\nthere were no legitimate venues available for women to apply their\nadvanced education beyond the domestic realm of nei. Unlike\nmen, these women of talents required additional justifications for\nthem to cross the ritual boundary into the realm of wai. The\nliterary genre of women\u2019s didactic texts\u2014its\nconservativism notwithstanding\u2014provided that safe passage for\nlearned and talented women to cross into the wai without\nleaving the nei nominally.\n\nThe authors of the Four Books for Women\n(N\u00fcsishu) compiled by Wang Xiang during the late Ming\nare cases in point. All five women authors lived an extraordinary life\non par with their male counterparts: Ban Zhao\u2019s\nN\u00fcjie of Han (c.106 CE), Song Ruoxin and Song\nRuozhao\u2019s The Analects for Women\n(N\u00fclunyu) of Tang (c.820/825 CE), Empress\nRenxiaowen\u2019s Instructions for the Inner Quarter\n(Neixun) of Ming (c.1405 CE), and Woman Liu\u2019s\nConcise Selections of Model Women (N\u00fcfan jielu)\nof Ming (c.1580\n CE).[10]\n In a sense, one of the safest ways for women to exercise their\nsocially deemed superfluous literary talents was to author\nconservative didactic texts which provided a deflecting cover for\ntheir extraordinary lives.\n\nBan Zhao, as noted earlier, lived an exceptional life of scholarship\nand state governance that was beyond the reach of not only women in\nthe nei, but also most men of letters. Song Ruoxin and Song\nRuozhao of Tang declined marriage proposals, instead choosing a life\nof scholarly work and were appointed by the emperor as\n\u201cscholar-officials/teachers\u201d (xueshi\n\u5b78\u58eb/xiansheng \u5148\u751f) instructing\nprinces, princesses, and consorts alike. Empress Renxiaowen lived a\nlife of the highest level of literary learning by virtue of her royal\nposition, but also had her literary works including Neixun\npreserved and propagated by the Emperor\u2019s royal edict, making\nthem available to the wider audience. Woman Liu, unlike all the\nprevious authors, did not come from a prominent family, but was\nwidowed at a young age and lived a long life of her own accord\nimmersed in literary learning for sixty years, writing the most\nself-assertive didactic text among the N\u00fcsishu and had\nher writings preserved by her son Wang Xiang, the editor of the\nN\u00fcsishu (Pang-White 2018).\n\nThe impact of this uniquely women-centric literary genre of the\ndidactic texts for women obviously went beyond its overall\nconservative content. Its subversive effect on virtuous and talented\nwomen was made clear not only through the kind of life that these\nwomen authors had, but also through the emergence of gender-based\nconsciousness that asserted not only the importance of women\u2019s\nwork in the nei, but also women\u2019s own authority over\ntheir own domain. Instead of looking to men for intellectual guidance,\nvirtuous and talented women became the historical precedents for other\nwomen.\n4.3 Gender-based Consciousness\n\nThe emergence of gender-based consciousness is the natural fallout\nfrom this uniquely women-centric literary genre made for women, of\nwomen, and by women. Ban Zhao\u2019s N\u00fcjie as the\ninaugurating text for this literary genre and the kind of life that\nBan Zhao lived became inspirational models for other equally talented\nand virtuous women. Song Ruoxin and Song Ruozhao who self-consciously\ninvoked Ban Zhao as their interlocutor in their original draft of the\nN\u00fclunyu\u2014intended as a parity to the Confucian\ncanonic text of Lunyu\u2014are clear examples of this sort.\nInstead of looking to Confucius as their intellectual guide, the two\nSong sisters took Xuan Wenjun (c. 4th century CE)\u2014a\nlearned woman held the position of instructor in the state academy\nteaching over one hundred students\u2014as Confucius, and took Ban\nZhao as their Yen Hui (i.e., Confucius\u2019s favorite disciple) in\ntheir imagined dialogical instructions to provide domestic counsels to\nwomen (Jiutangshu, Ch. 56, paragraph 33), seemingly invoking\na women-centric intellectual genealogy.\n\nEmpress Renxiaowen composed Neixun with a view to supplant\nBan Zhao\u2019s seven brief chapters of N\u00fcjie in order\nto offer a comprehensive text for women\u2019s education; this is\nanother example of women\u2019s affirmation of their own intellectual\nauthority over the domain of nei. Furthermore, Empress\nRenxiaowen equated her own effort in writing the Neixun as a\nstandard text for women\u2019s education with the famed Confucian\nscholar\u2019s (i.e., Zhu Xi; 1130\u20131200 CE) compilation of the\nElementary Learning (Xiaoxue) as a standard text for\nmen (Neixun, Preface), making women\u2019s education\ncomparable to men\u2019s.\n\nThe self-assertiveness of a women-centric genealogy and women\u2019s\nown intellectual authority is most clearly illustrated in the\nN\u00fcfan jielu, the last text of the N\u00fcsishu.\nUnlike Ban Zhao\u2019s N\u00fcjie, Woman Liu\u2019s\nN\u00fcfan jielu was not overly concerned with household\nmanagement nor immersed in excessive humble rhetoric of lowliness.\nInstead, Woman Liu appealed to past virtuous and talented women from\nempresses, female generals, concubines, to servants as historical\nprecedents to illustrate the importance of nei and\nfurthermore to advocate for the priority of nei over\nwai, women over men, daughters over sons (N\u00fcfan\njielu, Ch. 1, Ch. 3, Ch. 9, and Ch. 11). Woman Liu\u2019s\naudacious claim of female priority is part of this subversive effect\nof the didactic texts for women, which paradoxically are meant to\npropagate female servitude and compliance to patrilineage.\n5. Patrilineage and Gender Oppression\n\nVirtuous and talented women who are able to leave their marks in the\nwai are indeed few and far between. Women for the most part\nin Confucian philosophy are exalted for their unyielding devotion and\ndiligent servitude to patrilineage throughout their life cycle as\ndaughters, wives, or mothers. Since there is no other socially\nsanctioned venue for women to leave their marks in history, the only\nsocial accolade for women comes in the form of their exceptional\ndevotion and servitude to patrilineage. The literary genre of\nbiographies of \u201cexemplary women\u201d (lien\u00fc\n\u5217\u5973) compiled by Confucian court historians is a case in\npoint.\n\nLiu Xiang\u2019s Lien\u00fc zhuan \u5217\u5973\u50b3\n(c. 18 BCE) is the inaugurating text for the\n\u201clien\u00fc\u201d literary tradition that later became\na standard feature in each dynastic history from the Han to the last\ndynasty of the Qing (for the \u201clien\u00fc\u201d entry\nin dynastic histories, see Judge and Ying 2011, Appendix B). Liu\nXiang\u2019s Lienu zhuan is a collection of commentarial\nbiographies of women from early antiquity onward and was originally\ncomposed as an admonition to Emperor Cheng (r. 33\u20137 BCE) to\nrecognize the importance as well as the precarious influences of\npalace women. The text was organized under six distinct sets of\nvirtues\u2014\u201cmaternal rectitude\u201d (muyi\n\u6bcd\u5100), \u201cworthy and enlightened\u201d\n(xianming \u8ce2\u660e), \u201cbenevolent and\nwise\u201d (renzhi \u4ec1\u667a), \u201cprincipled and\nrighteous\u201d (jieyi \u7bc0\u7fa9) and\n\u201cpersuasive and communicative\u201d (biantong\n\u8faf\u901a), plus one chapter on the \u201cdeprived and\nfavored\u201d (niebi \u5b7d\u5b16). As shown above,\nwomen in antiquity were not strictly praised for their gender roles\nper se since among the six sets of virtues enumerated in the text,\nonly the virtue of muyi \u6bcd\u5100 (maternal rectitude)\nis gender-role specific. And yet women\u2019s unyielding devotion and\ndiligent servitude to patrilineage still formed part of their social\nmemorialization in other non-gender specific categories of virtue.\n5.1 Lien\u00fc zhuan \u5217\u5973\u50b3 and Gendered Virtues\n\nFemale servitude to patrilineage is so pervasive that it shapes even\nthe way in which a virtuous and talented woman is memorialized even if\nthe enumerated virtues under which she is celebrated are non-gender\nspecific. For instance, even under the non-gendered virtue of\n\u201cpersuasive and communicative\u201d (biantong) where\nwomen in early antiquity were celebrated as skillful rhetoricians\nturning a precarious situation in their favor through the sheer power\nof persuasion, the narratives of these skillful women rhetoricians\nwere still told in the context of or their servitude to\npatrilineage.\n\nTake for example the opening biography of Ch. 6, Lien\u00fc\nzhuan 6.1: \u201cGuan Zhong of Qi\u2019s Concubine,\nJing\u201d. Jing was a skillful rhetorician who successfully helped\nGuan Zhong (c. 720\u2014645 BCE)\u2014the famed prime minister of\nQi\u2014decipher the opaque speech of Ning Qi. Guan Zhong was under\nthe Duke\u2019s directive to gauge Ning Qi\u2019s intention to\nserve, and yet during their encounter Ning Qi only uttered the phrase\n\u201cHow vast, the white water\u201d which had vexed Guan Zhong for\nfive days. Upon seeing Guan Zhong\u2019s vexation, Jing, the\nconcubine, offered her help to lessen his burden, but was quickly\ndismissed as nothing that she would understand. Jing was obviously\nerudite, since she was able to place Ning Qi\u2019s speech of\n\u201cHow vast, the white water\u201d in the context of an old\nOde signaling Ning Qi\u2019s willingness to serve the Duke.\nThe story ended with a praise of Guan Zhong\u2019s recommendation of\nNing Qi to the Duke who then was able to secure the means to good\ngovernance. It is clear that even though Jing was as erudite as Ning\nQi, one was offered the position of a minister and the other remained\na lowly concubine who had to persuade Guan Zhong not to take her lowly\nstatus as the ground to dismiss her ability to help him in the first\nplace. The most a talented woman could do was to be of service to the\nmen of her kin who then were memorialized for their achievements in\nthe wai.\n5.2 Marriage and Womanhood\n\nThe prioritization of patrilineage underpins the Chinese family system\nand is codified in various ritual practices. For instance, the\nmarriage rite has two different meanings for men and women. As\nexplained in the White Tiger Hall (Baihutong), the\nterm \u201cmarriage\u201d (jiaqu \u5ac1\u5a36) is in\nfact a compounded term: jia \u5ac1 for women and\nqu \u5a36 for men. For a woman, to get married\n(jia \u5ac1) is to seek an external completion so as to\nfind a suitable home, and for a man, to qu \u5a36 is to\nacquire [a bride] (Baihutong, \u201cJiaqu\u201d\nchapter; for other translations see Tjan 1949 [1952]; also\nsee Shuowen jiezi). In other words, in the family system of\npatrilineage, marriage for the groom is an occasion of\nacquisition for his family contiguous to his existing\nidentity, whereas for the bride an occasion of exodus from her own\nnatal family in search for a new home, an external completion to her\npersonhood/womanhood.\n\nA successful integration into the husband\u2019s patrilineage is\nindeed essential to a woman\u2019s life ritually and by necessity. In\nthe Confucian textual tradition, marriage is consummated, however, not\nthrough the physical intimacy between the husband and wife, but\nthrough the ritual completion of ancestor worship. According to the\nLiji, the purpose of marriage is twofold: first is to secure\nthe sacrificial service in the ancestral temple, and second to\ncontinue the lineage (Liji, \u201cHunyi\u201d\nchapter). To secure her service to the ancestral hall marks the\npriority of the marriage institution and hence also marks the\nbeginning of a consummated marriage through which a new bride\nestablishes herself as part of this new patrilineage.\n\nA new bride becomes a wife in the fullest sense only after she has\npartaken in the ancestral rites; otherwise, she is not yet a member of\nher new patrilineal family. As explained in the\nBaihutong,\n\n\nTo take in a wife without first announcing it in the ancestral temple,\nit will be inauspicious [\u2026] Once a wife has been here for three\nmonths, she is now allowed to partake in the ancestral worship\n[\u2026] If she dies before partaking in the ancestral worship, her\nbody is to be interred with her natal family; this is to show that she\nis not yet a wife in the fullest sense. (Baihutong,\n\u201cJiaqu\u201d chapter; also see Liji,\n\u201cZengziwen\u201d chapter)\n\n\nIn addition, according to the customary law of \u201cThree grounds a\nwife cannot be expelled\u201d (sanbuchu\n\u4e09\u4e0d\u51fa) as stated in the Family Sayings of\nConfucius (Kongzi jiayu), a wife\u2019s participation\nin the three-year mourning ritual for the in-laws constitutes one of\nthe three compelling grounds that overrides the customary law of\n\u201cSeven reasons for expelling a wife\u201d (qichu\n\u4e03\u51fa), one of which is childlessness (Kongzi\njiayu, \u201cBenmingjie\u201d chapter; for other\ntranslations see Kramers\n 1950).[11]\n In sum, for a woman to establish herself as part of this new\npatrilineage, she must retrospectively observe the ancestral rites or\nprospectively provide a male heir.\n5.3 Wifely Fidelity and Widowhood\n\nNon-gender specific virtues as enumerated in Liu Xiang\u2019s\nLien\u00fc zhuan dissipated from the subsequent dynastic\nhistorical accounts of exemplary women\u2019s biographies; women in\nthe post-Han era were praised specifically for adhering to their\ngender roles, such as wifely fidelity, widow chastity, and maternal\nrectitude (Raphals 1998: Appendix 5). The power of these historical\naccolades for women obviously reinforced the limited roles and social\nvenues available for women. One way for women to garner social\naccolades is through observing spousal fidelity, and there is a long\ntradition in Confucian texts that teach the virtue of wifely fidelity.\nAccording to the Liji,\n\n\nFaithfulness is the requisite in all service of others, and\nfaithfulness is the virtue of a wife. Once mated, she will not change\nfor her entire life; therefore, when her husband dies, she will not\nremarry. (Liji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\nchapter)\n\n\nSimilarly, as stated in the Baihutong in the context of the\nwifely duty to remonstrate with the husband:\n\n\nwhen the remonstration is not taken, the wife cannot thus leave the\nhusband. Once mated, the wife cannot change for her entire life. There\nis no justification for deserting one\u2019s husband.\n(Baihutong, \u201cJianzheng\u201d chapter)\n\n\nWifely fidelity to patrilineage is cumulated in the observance of\nwidowhood, and since the Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE) onward,\nwidowhood had been recognized as one of the many honored deeds by the\nimperial court with a \u201ctestimonial of merit\u201d that elevated\none\u2019s entire household. The cult of widowhood reached its height\nduring the Qing dynasty (1644 to 1912 CE) where widowhood became a\nreligious expression that enshrined chaste widows at the state and\ncounty\u2019s expense (Mann 1987: 37\u201356). Considering the fact\nthat a woman is ritually without rank, title, or name of her own, for\nher to earn an imperial merit\u2014which at times comes with monetary\nawards\u2014is itself an impressive achievement. But as impressive as\nthis might seem, social accolades for women, unlike those for men,\nmust be mediated through patrilineage; she is exemplary because of her\nservitude to the men of her kin.\n\nWithout that kinship tie, it would be nearly impossible for a woman to\nacquire social recognition. One only needs to compare the biographies\nof \u201cexemplary women\u201d (lien\u00fc\n\u5217\u5973) with the \u201cexemplary [men\u2019s]\nbiographies\u201d (liezhuan \u5217\u50b3)\u2014both are\nstandard entries in each dynastic historical records compiled and\nwritten by Confucian court historians\u2014and it is clear that there\nwas no such kinship meditation needed for men of virtue, even though\nmany of them were recorded to have benefited from their mothers\u2019\ninstructions. Men are exemplary mainly because of their own doings,\nwhereas women are memorialized, if and only if, they are tied to\npatrilineage as filial daughters, faithful wives, chaste widows, or\ndevoted mothers.\n\nIn prioritizing the perpetuation of patrilineage, women often\nparticipate in gender oppressive practices such as female infanticide,\nchild bride, and concubinage. It is in the wife\u2019s interest that\nher new family has a male heir through which she anchors her place in\nthe family, since her failure to produce children is one of\nthe seven grounds for her expulsion from the marriage. Through\nwhatever means necessary, a wife must ensure that there is sufficient\nfamily resources for her to produce or procure the coming of a male\nheir. Perpetuating patrilineage is also codified into the very\npractice of filiality (xiao \u5b5d). As shown in this famed\nsaying of Mencius,\n\n\nThere are three unfilial things, and to have no posterity is the\ngreatest. King Shun married without informing his parents was because\notherwise he would have no posterity. An exemplary person considers\nthis so treating what he did as if he had informed them.\n(Mencius 4A26)\n\n\nNot to inform one\u2019s parents of one\u2019s marriage is a serious\nritual infraction, but the imperative to perpetuate one\u2019s\nlineage overrides that ritual requirement. The perpetuation of\npatrilineage, hence, is of utmost importance.\n6. Contemporary Feminist Discussions\n\nA systematic examination of gender relations using gender as a\ncategory of analysis is a mark of feminist theorizing. In the\nphilosophical community, this often involves critical re-reading of\nthe canon shedding light on the overt display of misogyny textually,\nhistorically, and culturally in noted canonical thinkers from Plato to\nthe twentieth century (e.g., the \u201cRe-Reading the Canon\u201d\nseries of the Pennsylvania State University Press). But beyond the\ncritical interrogation of the canon\u2019s misogyny, feminists also\nengage in the effort of re-appropriation of the canon for the purpose\nof constructing liberating solutions for gender-based oppression\n(Schott 2003: Ch.1). However, in the theoretical space, feminist\nconsciousness and westernization are more or less synonymous, since\npositive feminist theorizing is largely reliant on western canonical\ntexts. Non-western intellectual traditions, if they are included at\nall, are used as an example of moral depravity to demonstrate the\nplights of \u201cthird-world\u201d women.\n6.1 \u201cThird-world\u201d Women and Multiculturalism\n\nAround the 1970s, there was a surge of interest in studying the lives\nof women outside the western sphere in order to construct a global\nhistory of women. By going beyond the western sphere, feminists\nintended to provide an empirical proof of the urgency and the ubiquity\nof gender oppression, while expanding their sphere of concern to\ninclude their less fortunate sisters in the \u201cthird-world\u201d.\nIn cross-cultural studies, the status of \u201cthird-world\u201d\nwomen is usually measured on a sliding scale of universal victimhood\nwith western women being the most liberated, the most\ngender-conscious, and the most self-determined (Mohanty 1984, 2003;\nMohanty, Russo, & Torres 1991; Narayan 1997). Western feminists\nsee gender-based oppression faced by non-western women as\n\u201csimilar but much worse\u201d, treating non-western\ncultures/traditions as the worsening factors aggravating the suffering\nof \u201cthird-world\u201d women.\n\nA multicultural approach to gender studies is said to be bad for\n\u201cthird-world\u201d women, since, unlike the west, non-western\ncultures/traditions are said to be deeply entrenched in their\npatriarchal past, and unlike western feminists,\n\u201cthird-world\u201d women with their \u201cfalse\nconsciousness\u201d have no agency of their own (Okin 1994: 5 &\n11; 1999: 22). The only solution to universal patriarchy then seems to\nbe a whole-sale importation of western thought and way of life to the\nrest of the world. For \u201cthird-world\u201d women are said to be\nbetter off, if their indigenous cultures are preferably changed by\nmodeling after the western liberal culture or simply \u201cto become\nextinct\u201d (Okin 1999: 22).\n\nIn the western imagination, footbinding remains as the favorite\nexample of Chinese patriarchy and moral depravity focusing on the\nexotic, highly sexualized nature of the practice (Levy 1966; Jackson\n1997; Dworkin 1974; Greenhalgh 1977; Daly 1978\n [1990]).[12]\n The familiar exoticization of footbinding is a clear case of\n\u201corientalism\u201d seeing non-western cultures as barbaric and\noppressive to the so-called \u201cthird-world\u201d women (Said\n1978). Even though there is no textual basis connecting Confucian\nphilosophy to the practice of footbinding that has persisted for a\nthousand years, the prolonged co-existence of the practice and\nConfucian teaching to some makes Confucian philosophy suspect by\nassociation.\n6.2 Care Ethics and Confucian Ren \u4ec1\n\nSeeing non-western cultures/traditions as deeply entrenched in\npatriarchy of a by-gone era that should be left behind for good is a\ncommon sentiment in feminist encounters inter-culturally. And this is\ntrue in the feminist engagement with Confucian philosophy as well.\nFrom the turn of the twentieth century to the mid-1990s, the\nengagement between feminism and Confucian philosophy, as Terry Woo\nputs it, has been mostly a one-sided affair: feminists criticizing\nConfucianism for its victimization of women (Woo 1999: 110). The\ncommon caricature of Confucian philosophy as synonymous with\npatriarchy inevitably leads to the sentiment that Confucian philosophy\nis incompatible with feminist theorizing. Pushbacks from the\nChinese-comparative communities against this feminist caricature began\nin the mid-1990s, centering on the positive comparison between care\nethics and Confucian ren \u4ec1 on the ground that both\nshare the emphasis on caring relations and relational personhood (Li\n1994; Hall & Ames 1998: 79\u2013100; 2000: 75\u201396; and two\nspecial issues of the Journal of Chinese Philosophy: Lai\n[ed.] 2000 and Gu [ed.] 2009).\n\nSome care ethicists have voiced specific concerns regarding the\nincorporation of non-western intellectual traditions into feminist\ntheorizing, in that its distinctive \u201cfeminist\u201d as well as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d character is being adulterated by such\nincorporation (Held 2006: 22; Noddings 2010:\n 140).[13]\n \u201cIndigenous\u201d feminism that frames traditions in a\nprogressive idiom is dismissed as a \u201ccultural recovery\u201d\nproject, seen as easily coopted and swept away by the nationalistic\nefforts. The development of \u201cindigenous\u201d feminism is,\nhence, framed by some as \u201cTrojan horses\u201d from the\nconservative right that would only lead to further oppression of women\non the ground (Dalmiya 2009: 205\u2013207). Curiously, no such\nout-pouring worries are voiced when western intellectual\ntraditions/canonical thinkers are routinely incorporated into\ncontemporary feminist theorizing.\n6.3 Comparative Feminist Studies on Confucianism\n\nA quick survey of the content of publications in feminist journals\nsuch as Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy\u2014whose\njournalistic mission is to propagate feminist\nphilosophy\u2014illustrates the lopsided dependency on western\ncanonical texts for feminist theorizing. Few publications outside the\nChinese-comparative philosophical communities have explored any\nfeminist potential in non-western intellectual traditions including\nConfucianism to address women\u2019s issues, concerns and experiences\nin the contemporary world. Non-western philosophies, if included at\nall, in feminist theorizing serve more as negative examples\nillustrating how else things could possibly go wrong for\n\u201cthird-world\u201d women, instead of serving as positive\nconceptual resources for women\u2019s liberation from gender-based\noppression.\n\nDespite the lack of positive engagement from the feminist communities\nwith Confucian philosophy, the Chinese-comparative communities,\nnevertheless, persist. Around the mid-2010s, the Chinese-comparative\ncommunities began to go beyond the issue of compatibility between care\nethics and Confucian ren and took a step further to\narticulate positive Confucian approaches to address women\u2019s\nconcerns, issues, and experiences in the contemporary world, such as\nabortion, same-sex marriage, mothering, ecofeminism, domestic\nviolence, elder care, etc. (Butnor & McWeeny 2014; Olberding 2015;\nPang-White 2016; Foust & Tan 2016; Yuan 2019). The field of\ncomparative feminist philosophy exploring the feminist potential in\nConfucianism is the latest attempt to reconceptualize the complex\nconnection between gender and Confucian philosophy laying the\nfoundation for an inclusive, transnational, transcultural feminist\ntheory.\n7. Confucian Feminism: A Hybrid Feminist Theory\n\nConsidering how routinely canonical western philosophers\u2014some\nwith egregious connections to misogyny, white supremacy, Nazism, or\npedophilia, personally or textually (Park 2013; Oltermann 2014; Zack\n2017; Kirkpatrick 2019; Chrisafis 2019; Rosenlee 2020a,b)\u2014are\nextensively integrated into contemporary feminist theorizing, it\nprompts the question: why not Confucian philosophy? In the following,\nwe will look at a theoretical construction of a hybrid theory of\nConfucian feminism by using characteristic Confucian concepts,\nmethods, and concerns to navigate women\u2019s issues, concerns, and\nexperiences in the contemporary world. Confucian feminism proposed\nhere is not just a historical study of women\u2019s lives in the\nConfucian textual tradition. Rather, it is a forward-looking project\nintended to formulate a feminist theory based on a distinct Confucian\nframework\u2014a feminist theory that is Confucian\u2014on par with\nother feminist theories such as liberal feminism, social feminism,\netc. in the pantheon of feminism.\n7.1 Rectification of Nei-Wai\n\nSexism is undeniably a shared human experience in most societies.\nDifferent intellectual traditions might have framed the degree and the\nways in which women are lesser differently\u2014let it be lesser in\nintellect, will, or sphere of influence\u2014but women\u2019s lesser\nstatus is plain. Women in Confucian philosophy are lesser, first and\nforemost, in their sphere of influence; the womanly sphere of\nnei\u2014even though it is indispensable to the expansive\nsphere of wai\u2014is restrictive and mostly concerned with\nthe functional aspects of household management. Confucius\u2019s\nfamous saying that one does not need to leave home to get involved in\nstate governance is true to a certain extent (Analects 2.21),\nbut part of the process of self-cultivation to achieve moral\nperfectibility is to expand one\u2019s sphere of influence\nconcentrically from family, state, to the world at large.\n\nA woman, confined to the realm of nei, is essentially a\nfunctional vessel for household management, a sort of thing that\nConfucius said a well-rounded exemplary person should not be\n(Analects 2.12). The structural impediment derived from the\nconfinement of nei will need to be addressed in Confucian\nfeminism, since any viable feminist theory, first of all, will need to\nbe able to deal with the gender-based division of labor that confines\neach gender to a set of prescriptive roles and duties regardless of\none\u2019s actual capacities or unique circumstances. The\nnei-wai distinction as applied to gender, as noted earlier,\nis derived from the functional differentiation (bie \u522b)\nin the spousal relationship as in fufu youbie\n(\u592b\u5a66\u6709\u522b). Hence, in order to address the\nproblem of the confinement of nei, the spousal relationship\nas articulated in the Confucian five core social relations\n(Mencius 3A4; Zhongyong, Ch. 20; Daxue)\nwill also need modification as well.\n\nOne possible replacement for the spousal relationship within the\nConfucian framework would be friendship (you \u53cb), which\nis anchored in the virtue of trust (xin \u4fe1). Unlike the\nspousal relationship, friendship is not primarily, distinctively, nor\ninvariably gender-based; furthermore, the excellence of Confucian\nfriendship is marked by friends\u2019 mutual commitment to moral\nperfectibility, instead of a functional distinction based on gender or\na fulfillment of some sort of external obligations/duties. Lastly,\ngiven the long overlapping usage of friendship and familial\nrelationships from antiquity onward, east and west, this substitution\nis not inappropriate textually or historically (Rosenlee\n 2015).[14]\n7.2 Friendship as Spousal Relationship\n\nReplacing spousal relationship with friendship will enable us to\naddress the many problematics associated with the gender-based\ndivision of labor; furthermore, we will be able to accommodate the\nexpanded institution of marriage to include same-sex couples. This new\nconceptual paradigm of marriage is both Confucian and feminist. It is\nfeminist, since it discards gender-based restrictions/hierarchy in the\ndivision of labor. It is also Confucian, since it utilizes one of the\nfive Confucian social relations (father-son, husband-wife, siblings,\nruler-minister, friends). Friendship is a corridor bridging the\nfamilial and the world at large, in much the same way, marriage serves\nas a pathway through which two strangers become family. The\nidyllically enduring spousal bond till death do us part is also\ncharacteristic of true friendship in good times and bad. In sum,\nfriendship and spousal relationship are not only compatible, but also\noftentimes mirror one another in form and in content.\n\nThe advantage of using our Confucian friendship-based model of\nmarriage is that it provides us with a flexible approach to household\nmanagement and child-rearing as an alternative to the 50/50 equal\nsplit prevalent among liberal feminists (Okin 1989) or the call for\nthe abolition of the institution of family and marriage advocated by\nsome radical feminists (Allen 1984 [1993]; Card 1996, 2007). Compared\nto the liberal 50/50 equal split, the Confucian friendship model is\nmuch more attainable and, unlike the radical call for abolition, the\nConfucian model addresses instead of evading the problems of family\nand marriage. For the vast majority of women (and men) who continue to\nopt to enter the marriage institution and to propagate, the call for\nabolition provides no applicable guidance. Furthermore, the liberal\ntemplate of absolute equality in intimate relationships is not\nattainable since favors done for one\u2019s loved ones are not\nusually tracked on a scoresheet. Nor is this desirable. In a good\nrelationship of any kind, there must be a sense of reciprocity, but\nunlike in a contractual transaction, in a good marriage or friendship,\nreciprocity is not marked by numerical equality.\n\nFor what is especially appealing about friendship is the penetrating\nunderstanding that two good friends have of one another, and that\nfaithful understanding of one another is what enables friends to\ntranscend the temporal needs to repay in kind and in a timely manner\nthat an ordinary dealing in everyday life demands. Friends are\nfaithful to one another, not in a sense of blind obedience, but in a\nway that insists on the enduring goodness in one another, both actual\nand potential. By being faithful to one another in this way, friends\nnot only see what is good in one another, but also help realize what\nelse is possible through thick and thin. Looking at marriage in this\nway, to mandate a 50/50 equal split makes marriage seem not only\ntransactional, but also contrary to what is required in an enduring\nfriendship.\n7.3 Relational Personhood and Dependency Care\n\nIt is important to note that the Confucian friendship model is not a\nreplica of the contemporary peer friendship model that is morally\nneutral and is underpinned by an autonomous concept of the self\n(English 1979 [1989]; Dixon 1995). As many contemporary scholars have\nargued, unlike the liberal model of individualism, Confucianism offers\na relational conception of the self whose personhood is deeply\nentrenched in the intertwining of the self and other (Ivanhoe 2007;\nAmes 2011; Rosemont 2015). The Confucian relational personhood is,\nfirst and foremost, grounded in the parent-child relationship, and\nthat Confucian emphasis on the parent-child relationship not only fits\nright into the ongoing feminist discourse on care ethics but also is\nahead of the growing consensus among philosophers that the liberal\nconcept of an autonomous self is a deeply flawed one.\n\nMost feminists, even those anchored in the liberal tradition, have\nbegun to theorize a more robust concept of the self that is relational\nand embodied (Mackenzie 2014). And most feminists have looked past the\n\u201cMan of Reason\u201d as a guide for moral and political theory\n(Lloyd 1984, 2002). In particular, feminists with the rise of care\nethics have begun to take the activity of caring as meriting ethical\ninsights that have long been discarded to the realm of the sentiment,\npersonal, or pre-moral. In contrast, Confucianism not only exalts the\nmoral valence of caring relations, but more importantly recognizes the\npolitical dimension of caring, a critical step that was lacking in the\nearly development of care ethics (Card 1990; Friedman 1993: Ch. 6;\nYuan 2002).\n\nConfucianism understands that interdependency is an existential given\nand hence providing care to vulnerable others in Confucianism is not\nonly a moral response, but also a characteristic political response of\na ren-based benevolent state. For the way of Confucians,\naccording to the competing school of Mo (Mojia), is\ncharacterized by the parental devotion of caring for the newborn\ninfant (Mencius 3A5). Remarkably, in Confucian philosophy,\nthe discussion of caring for the newborn infant occurs not in the\ncontext of the so-called \u201cwomanly sphere\u201d, but instead in\nthe context of state governance.\n\nThe metaphor of caring for the newborn infant in state governance is\nfirst derived from the Book of Documents\n(Shujing):\n\n\nif the king tended to the people as if he were tending to his own\nnewborn infant, then the people would be tranquil and orderly.\n(Shujing, \u201cKangzhao\u201d chapter; for other\ntranslations see Legge 1879).\n\n\nAnd the way to tend to the newborn infant is to be responsive and\nsincere. As the same passage is further elaborated in the Great\nLearning (Daxue):\n\n\nIn the \u201cKangzhao\u201d [of Shujing] it is said,\n\u201cAct as if you were watching over an infant\u201d. If one is\nreally responsively sincere, though one may not exactly hit the mark,\none will not be far from doing so (for other translation see Legge\n1885, Liji, \u201cDaxue\u201d chapter).\n\n\nProviding good care for the most vulnerable is an integral part of\nConfucian political discourse. A kingly state, according to the\nMencius, takes caring for those without the care of a\nfamily\u2014the widower, the widow, the childless, and the\norphan\u2014as its first political consideration (Mencius\n1B5). Similarly, according to the Xunzi in the discussion of\nthe regulation of a king:\n\n\nThose who have one of the Five Illnesses (wuji\n\u4e94\u75be) should be raised up and gathered in so that they can\nbe cared for. They should be given official duties commensurable with\ntheir abilities and employment adequate to feed and clothe themselves\nso that all are included and not even one of them is overlooked.\n(Xunzi 9.1)\n\n\nAccording to the later commentary, the \u201cFive Illnesses\u201d\nhere refers to physical or mental disabilities (Watson 1963: n3,\n34).\n\nUnlike the liberal bifurcation of the family and the state or the\nprivate and the public, the Confucian model provides a relational\nalternative to address the issue of dependency care that has long been\nadvocated by care ethicists (Noddings 1984; Kittay 1999; Held 2006).\nFor, in Confucianism, caring for others is not just constitutive of\none\u2019s moral personhood, but more importantly a political ideal\nthat grounds the state authority in its demonstrated capacity to\nprovide good care for the most vulnerable\u2014the young, the old,\nthe sick, and the disabled\u2014as if one were caring for one\u2019s\nown family. In other words, to care for those who cannot care for\nthemselves beginning in one\u2019s family and then concentrically\nradiating to the world at large has both ethical and political\nimportance in Confucian philosophy.\n7.4 Ren as Feminist Care\n\nSome early critics of care ethics have pointed out that by advocating\nfor a care-based approach to ethics by itself doesn\u2019t make it\nfeminist, since it might well exacerbate the demand for caring labor\non women (Card 1990; Friedman 1993; Yuan 2002). In Confucian feminism,\nthis imbalance in caring labor is addressed through the substitution\nof the gender-based division of labor in marriage on the basis of\nnei-wai with friendship. Without gender-based hierarchy or\nthe gender-based division of labor on the basis of nei-wai,\nthis Confucian model not only provides a flexible arrangement for both\nmen and women to assume different caring responsibilities, but also\nguards against a one-sided demand for self-sacrifice. Since a mutual\ncommitment to moral perfectibility is the anchor of Confucian\nfriendship, exploitation and moral degradation characteristic in many\noppressive relationships would also be contrary to a friendship-based\nmarriage where caring labor is performed for the sake of propelling\neach other to moral perfectibility, not for the sake of fulfilling the\ngender-based division of labor or gender-based hierarchy.\n\nOnce the gender-based division of labor and hierarchy is removed from\nthe performance of caring labor, Confucian feminism can move forward\nwith its moral affirmation of the importance of caring for others,\nespecially those who cannot care for themselves. This pronouncement is\nfeminist because not only is it morally sound, but because, as a\nfeminist, one should be committed to creating a more caring and\nequitable world not just for oneself but for those who need it most.\nNo feminist, as Eva Kittay argues, would, could, or should advocate\nfor voluntary abandonment of the old, the young, the sick, or the\ndisabled, let it be under the pretext of the pursuit of equality or\nfairness (Kittay 2002: 238). If feminists abandon those who cannot\nhelp themselves, then the focus on one\u2019s liberation from\ngender-based oppression rings hollow.\n\nAs in Confucianism where morality is deeply embedded in the\ncultivation of one\u2019s relational personhood, feminism should also\nlive up to the basic moral decency of being responsive to the needy,\nfirst, in one\u2019s family and then concentrically radiating to the\nworld at large. There should be no chasm between being a feminist and\nbeing a morally responsive person to those who cannot care for\nthemselves from near to afar. Confucian feminism\u2014a hybrid\naccount of a feminist theory in a Confucian framework\u2014is\ncommitted to creating an ever more inclusive and compassionate world\nthrough a ren-based self-cultivation and through a\nren-based political governance.\n\nThe caricature of Confucianism as synonymous with patriarchy and a\nbackwater ideology need not persist. With the rise of the field of\ncomparative feminist studies on Confucianism, it is now also possible\nto imagine a hybrid Confucian-feminist theory to address women\u2019s\nissues, concerns, and experiences. This tentative theoretical\nconstruct of Confucian feminism is here to serve as a facilitator to\nspur further positive engagement between the Chinese-comparative\ncommunities and the feminist communities to not only expand the range\nof our understanding of gender oppression in the lives of women, but\nalso provide women with viable conceptual tools going beyond the\nconfine of the western philosophical canon to articulate their own\nvision of a liberating future.\n",
