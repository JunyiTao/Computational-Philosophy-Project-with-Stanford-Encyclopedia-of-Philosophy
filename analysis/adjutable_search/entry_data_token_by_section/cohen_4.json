Pure Thinking, Generation, and Origin\n\nHowever, Cohen would not remain satisfied with his account of\ncalculus\u2019 foundational concepts and their significance for a\nphilosophical theory of knowledge. His final major work in\nepistemology was the 1902 Logic of Pure Knowledge, the first\npart of his projected System of Philosophy. In that book,\nCohen claims that there is an important connection between the\nconcepts of infinitesimals and infinities, and something he now calls\n\u201cpure thinking.\u201d For Cohen, thinking is pure just\nin case it is independent of any and all influences that are external\nto thought or reason. Nothing is given to pure thinking\n\u2013 not the data of sensible intuition, not the activity of a\nFichtean I, not the Absolute. Cohen claims that the infinitesimal\ncalculus is the paradigmatic example of \u201cthe triumph of pure\nthinking\u201d (Cohen 1902, 35). But more than that, he thinks an\nanalysis of the infinite is precisely what first raises the\nphilosophical question of pure thinking \u2013 that is, the question\nof how pure thinking functions to let mathematical natural science\nrepresent objects (Cohen 1902, 35).\n\nThe concept of pure thinking, and the closely related concepts of\ngeneration and origin, are central to Cohen\u2019s\nproject in the Logic. All three concepts have to do with the\nprinciples that, on Cohen\u2019s view, define what an object is for\nmathematical natural scientific theories. In Kant\u2019s Theory\nof Experience, Cohen had been content to identify and exhibit\nsynthetic a priori principles as \u201cpresent\u201d in experience.\nBut now in the Logic, he is concerned with the question of\nthose principles\u2019 foundation \u2013 that is, with their\n\u201corigin.\u201d Cohen now argues that pure thinking\ngenerates those principles from itself. Or in his preferred\nidiom, pure thinking is \u201cgeneration.\u201d\n\nOn its face, the concept of pure thinking is obscure. Likewise for\nCohen\u2019s claim that pure thinking generates out of itself the\nprinciples that explain mathematical natural science\u2019s objective\nvalidity. However, we can start to understand these ideas by recalling\ntwo of the commitments that underpin all of Cohen\u2019s theoretical\nphilosophy: first, his idealism, that is, his insistence that a priori\nlaws of human knowledge determine what counts as an object for us; and\nsecond, his methodological rationalism, that is, his commitment to an\nunending search for reasons and his unwillingness to accept anything\nas given or brute.\n\nFor Cohen in the Logic, the principles that constitute the\nobject of mathematical natural scientific knowledge must be generated\nby pure thinking, since only then can we have a priori knowledge of\nthat object (Beiser 2018, 196\u20137). But Cohen\u2019s\nmethodological rationalism gives us another way to understand why\nthose principles must be generated by pure thinking. To say that pure\nthinking is independent of any influences external to thought or\nreason is to say that pure thinking makes a rational demand: it can\naccept no representations that are given, brute, or unexplained. When\nCohen asserts that pure thinking generates the principles\nthat constitute the object of mathematical natural science, he means\nthat no part of that object has its source outside of pure thinking\nand thus no part of it can be left as given or unexplained. For Cohen,\nthen, pure thinking is not so much a species of cognitive content so\nmuch as it is a methodological demand. (See Beiser 2018, [Ch. 11] for\na detailed account of pure thinking as regulative.)\n\nOne striking consequence of Cohen\u2019s conception of pure thinking\nis something he is at pains to emphasize, namely, a decisive break\nwith Kant on a point central to Kant\u2019s system. In the\nLogic, Cohen rejects Kant\u2019s view that (in human\nknowledge) there is a faculty of sensible intuition that is\nindependent of the faculty of understanding. In effect, Cohen now\ndecisively rejects Kant\u2019s claim that sensible intuition is the\ncapacity that immediately relates objects to the knower (Kant\n1781/1787 [1998], A19/B33). From Cohen\u2019s perspective, that view\nis now unacceptable, because it posits a faculty of sensibility that\nis forever external to pure thinking, and thus forever given or\nunexplained. Further, since on Cohen\u2019s view a philosophical\naccount of knowledge does not appeal to an independent faculty of\nsensible intuition, Cohen insists that the project he had previously\ncalled the \u201ccritique of knowledge\u201d now becomes the\n\u201clogic of pure knowledge.\u201d (Cohen\u2019s view in the\nLogic appears somewhat similar to so-called\n\u201cconceptualist\u201d interpretations of Kant in the\ncontemporary Kant literature. [For example, Longuenesse 1998, Ch. 8\nand Friedman 2012.] So how radically one thinks Cohen\u2019s\nLogic breaks with Kant will depend on one\u2019s views of\nthe conceptualist interpretation of Kant. I leave it as an open\nquestion how much Cohen\u2019s views in the Logic differ\nfrom the conceptualist interpretation of Kant.)\n\nNotwithstanding that decisive break with Kant, other parts of the\nLogic still reflect Cohen\u2019s Kantianism. For Cohen, pure\nthinking generates the pure principles of knowledge through judgment\n\u2013 the epistemic structure that, he thinks (following Kant),\nrelates different concepts to one another. Consequently, in the\nLogic Cohen aims above all to articulate the twelve different\ntypes of foundational judgments that, he thinks, make it possible for\nmathematical natural scientific theories to represent objects. To be\nsure, Cohen\u2019s twelve types of judgment partly reflect the\nsection of the first Critique that Kant called the table of\nthe functions of judgment. At the same time, even here Cohen does not\nmerely reproduce Kant\u2019s doctrine. Perhaps most significantly,\nCohen abandons Kant\u2019s account of the three possible\n\u201cqualities\u201d of judgment and replaces it with his own\naccount of the judgments of origin, identity, and contradiction. For\nCohen, these judgments express the most foundational moments in the\norigin of pure thinking. Moreover, he develops his accounts of them at\nleast partly from reflection on the concepts of the infinite,\ninfinitesimals, and continuity. This should hardly be surprising,\ngiven his claim that pure thinking\u2019s function in knowledge is\nfirst revealed by an analysis of the infinite.\n\nCohen never gave up the view that the concepts of the infinite,\ninfinitesimals, and continuity were central to a philosophical account\nof pure thinking and knowledge. Yet his account of those mathematical\nconcepts was never convincing to mathematicians and philosophers of\nmathematics in the analytic tradition. Gottlob Frege complained that\nCohen\u2019s views in the Principle of the Infinitesimal\nMethod were too unclear to be intelligible (Frege 1885 [1984]).\nBertrand Russell objected that Cohen failed to understand that\nmathematicians now had a formal treatment of continuity and limits\nthat freed them of any commitment to infinitesimals (Russell 1903, Ch.\n41). Even Cassirer, Cohen\u2019s own student, abandoned Cohen\u2019s\naccount of infinitesimals, likely in response to Russell\u2019s\nobjections. Consequently, Cassirer also abandoned many of the details\nof Cohen\u2019s theory of knowledge in the Logic. (See\nGiovanelli 2016 for an account of how even Cohen\u2019s allies were\nunpersuaded by Cohen\u2019s account of the infinitesimal concept and\nits centrality to his account of knowledge. Edgar forthcoming argues\nthat Russell in particular failed to understand the philosophical\nsignificance of Cohen\u2019s account of the infinitesimal concept and\nits place in his theory of knowledge.)\n",
