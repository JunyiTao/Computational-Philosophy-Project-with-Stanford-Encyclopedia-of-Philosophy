    "main_text": "\n\nDescartes has been heralded as the first modern philosopher. He is\nfamous for having made an important connection between geometry and\nalgebra, which allowed for the solving of geometrical problems by way\nof algebraic equations. He is also famous for having promoted a new\nconception of matter, which allowed for the accounting of physical\nphenomena by way of mechanical explanations. However, he is most\nfamous for having written a relatively short work, Meditationes de\nPrima Philosophia (Meditations On First Philosophy),\npublished in 1641, in which he provides a philosophical groundwork for\nthe possibility of the sciences. \n",
