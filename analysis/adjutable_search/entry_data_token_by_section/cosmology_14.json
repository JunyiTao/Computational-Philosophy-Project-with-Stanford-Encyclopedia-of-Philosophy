    "main_text": "Origins of the Universe || Singularity Theorems\n3.2 Singularity Theorems\n\nThe singularity theorems proved in the 60s (see, in particular,\nHawking & Ellis 1973) show that the universe is finite to the past\nin a broad class of cosmological models. Past singularities, signaled\nby the existence of inextendible geodesics with bounded length, must\nbe present in models with a number of plausible features. (Geodesics\nare the curves of extreme length through curved spacetime, and freely\nfalling bodies follow timelike geodesics.) Intuitively, extrapolating\nbackwards from the present, an inextendible geodesic reaches, within\nfinite distance, an \u201cedge\u201d beyond which it cannot be\nextended. There is not a uniquely defined \u201ccosmic time\u201d,\nin general, but the maximum length of these curves reflects the finite\nage of the universe. The singularity theorems plausibly apply to the\nobserved universe, within the domain of applicability of general\nrelativity. There are various related theorems differing in detail,\nbut one common ingredient is an assumption that there is sufficient\nmatter and energy present to guarantee that our past light cone\n refocuses.[31]\n The energy density of the CMB alone is sufficient to justify this\nassumption. The theorems also require an energy condition: a\nrestriction on the types of matter present in the model, guaranteeing\nthat gravity leads to focusing of nearby geodesics. (In eqn.\n(\\(\\ref{eq:Ray}\\)) above, this is the case if \\(\\rho_{\\textit{grav}}\n> 0\\) and \\(\\Lambda=0\\); it is possible to avoid a singularity with\na non-zero cosmological constant, for example, since it appears with\nthe opposite sign as ordinary matter, counteracting this focusing\neffect.)\n\nThe prediction of singularities is usually taken to be a deep flaw of\n GR.[32]\n One potential problem with singularities is that they may lead to\nfailures of determinism, because the laws \u201cbreak down\u201d in\nsome sense. This concern only applies to some kinds of singularities,\nhowever. Relativistic spacetimes that are globally hyperbolic have\nCauchy surfaces, and appropriate initial data posed on such surfaces\nfix a unique solution throughout the spacetime. Global hyperbolicity\ndoes not rule out the existence of singularities, and in particular\nthe FLRW models are globally hyperbolic in spite of the existence of\nan initial singularity. The threat to determinism is thus more\nqualified: the laws do not apply \u201cat the singularity\nitself\u201d even though the subsequent evolution is fully\ndeterministic, and there are some types of singularities that pose\nmore serious threats to determinism.\n\nAnother common claim is that the presence of singularities establish\nthat GR is incomplete, since it fails to describe physics \u201cat\nthe\n singularity\u201d.[33]\n This is difficult to spell out fully without a local analysis of\nsingularities, which would give precise meaning to talk of\n\u201capproaching\u201d or being \u201cnear\u201d the singularity.\nIn any case, it is clear that the presence of a singularity in a\ncosmological model indicates that spacetime, as described by GR, comes\nto an end: there is no way of extending the spacetime through the\nsingularity, without violating mathematical conditions needed to\ninsure that the field equations are well-defined. Any description of\nphysical conditions \u201cbefore the big bang\u201d must be based on\na theory that supersedes GR, and allows for an extension through the\nsingularity.\n\nThere are two limitations regarding what we can learn about the\norigins of the universe based on the singularity theorems. First,\nalthough these results establish the existence of an initial\nsingularity, they do not provide much guidance regarding its\nstructure. The spacetime structure near a \u201cgeneric\u201d\ninitial singularity has not yet been fully characterized. Partial\nresults have been established for restricted classes of solutions; for\nexample, numerical simulations and a number of theorems support the\nBKL conjecture, which holds that isotropic, inhomogeneous models\nexhibit a complicated form of chaotic, oscillatory behavior. The\nresulting picture of the approach to the initial singularity contrasts\nsharply with that in FLRW\n models.[34]\n It is also possible to have non-scalar singularities (Ellis &\nKing 1974).\n\nSecond, classical general relativity does not include quantum effects,\nwhich are expected to be relevant as the singularity is approached.\nCrucial assumptions of the singularity theorems may not hold once\nquantum effects are taken into account. The standard energy conditions\ndo not hold for quantum fields, which can have negative energy\ndensities. This opens up the possibility that a model including\nquantum fields may exhibit a \u201cbounce\u201d rather than collapse\nto a singularity. More fundamentally, GR\u2019s classical spacetime\ndescription may fail to approximate the description provided by a full\ntheory of quantum gravity. According to recent work applying loop\nquantum gravity to cosmology, spacetime collapses to a minimum finite\nsize rather than reaching a true singularity (Ashtekar & Singh\n2011; Bojowald 2011). On this account, GR fails to provide a good\napproximation in the region of the bounce, and the apparent\nsingularity is an artifact. Classical spacetime \u201cemerges\u201d\nfrom a state to which familiar spacetime concepts do not apply. There\nare several accounts of the early universe, motivated by string theory\nand other approaches, that similarly avoid the initial singularity due\nto quantum gravity effects.\n",
