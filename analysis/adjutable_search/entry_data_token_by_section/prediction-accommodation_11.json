    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || The Akaike Approach\n6.7 The Akaike Approach\n\nHitchcock and Sober (2004) provide an original theory of weak\nheuristic predictivism that is based on a particular worry about\naccommodation. On the assumption that data are noisy (i.e. imbued with\nobservational error), a good theory will almost never fit the data\nperfectly. To construct a theory that fits the data better than a good\ntheory should, given noisy data, is to be guilty of\n\u201coverfitting\u201d\u2014if we know a theorist built her theory\nto accommodate data, we may well worry that she has overfit the data\nand thus constructed a flawed theory. If we know however that a\ntheorist built her theory without access to such data, or without\nusing it in the process of theory construction, we need not worry that\noverfitting that data has occurred. When such a theory goes on to make\nsuccessful predictions, Hitchcock and Sober moreover argue, this\nprovides us with evidence that the data on which the theory was\ninitially based were not overfit in the process of constructing the\ntheory. \n\nHitchcock and Sober\u2019s approach derives from a particular\nsolution to the curve-fitting problem presented in Forster and Sober\n1994. The curve fitting problem is how to select an optimally\nsupported curve on the basis of a given body of data (e.g., a set of\n\\([X,Y]\\) points plotted on a coordinate graph). A well-supported\ncurve will feature both \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 with the data\nand simplicity (intuitively, avoiding highly bumpy or irregular\npatterns). Solving the curve-fitting problem requires some precise way\nof characterizing a curve\u2019s simplicity, a way of characterizing\ngoodness of fit, and a method of balancing simplicity against goodness\nof fit to identify an optimal curve. \n\nForster and Sober cite Akaike\u2019s (1973) result that an unbiased\nestimate of the predictive accuracy of a model can be computed by\nassessing both its goodness of fit and its simplicity as measured by\nthe number of adjustable parameters it contains. A model is a\nstatement (a polynomial, in the case of a proposed curve) that\ncontains at least one adjustable parameter. For any particular model\nM, a given data set, and identifying \\(L(M)\\) as the likeliest\n(i.e. best data fitting) curve from M, Akaike showed that the\nfollowing expression describes an unbiased estimate of the predictive\naccuracy of model M:\n\n\n\\[M \\approx \\log [ \\textrm{Pr}(\\textrm{Data} \\mid L(M)) ] - k.\\]\n\n\n\nThis estimate is deemed a model\u2019s \u2018Akaike Information\nCriterion\u2019 (AIC) score\u2014it measures goodness of fit in\nterms of the log likelihood of the data on the assumption of \\(L(M)\\).\nThe simplicity of the model is inversely proportion to k, the\nnumber of adjustable parameters in the model. The intuitive idea is\nthat models with a high k value will provide a large variety of\ncurves that will tend to fit data more closely than models with a\nlower k value\u2014and thus large k values are more\nprone to overfitting than small k values. So the AIC score\nassesses a model\u2019s likely predictive accuracy in a way that\nbalances both goodness of fit and simplicity, and the curve-fitting\nproblem is arguably solved. \n\nHitchcock and Sober (2004) consider a hypothetical example involving\ntwo scientists, Penny Predictor and Annie Accommodator. Working\nindependently, they acquire the same set of data D\u2014Penny\nproposes theory Tp while Annie proposes Ta. The critical\ndifference however was that Penny proposed Tp on the basis of\nan initial segment of the data D1\u2014thereafter she\npredicted the remaining data D2 to a high degree of accuracy\n\\((D = D1 \\cup D2)\\). Annie however was in possession of all the data\nin D prior to proposing Ta and in proposing this theory\naccommodated D. Hitchcock and Sober ask whether there might be\nreason to suspect that Penny\u2019s theory will be more predictively\naccurate in the future, and in this precise sense be better confirmed.\n\n\nHitchcock and Sober argue that there is no one answer to this\nquestion\u2014and then present a series of several cases. Insofar as\npredictivism holds in some and not others, their account of\npredictivism is clearly a local (rather than global) account. In cases\nin which Penny and Annie propose the same theory, or propose theories\nwhose AIC scores can be computed and directly compared, there is no\nreason to regard facts about how they built the theory to carry\nfurther significance. But if we do not know which theories were\nproposed, or by what method they were constructed, the fact that Penny\npredicted data that Annie accommodated can argue for Penny\u2019s\ntheory having a higher AIC score than Annie\u2019s, and thus carry an\nepistemic advantage.\n\nInsofar as predictivism holds in some cases but not the others, the\nquestion whether predictivism holds in actual episodes of science\ndepends on which cases such actual episodes tend to resemble, but\nHitchcock and Sober \u201ctake no stand on how often the various\ncases arise\u201d (2004: 21). \n\nAlthough their account of predictivism is tailored initially to the\ncurve-fitting problem, it is by no means limited to such cases. They\nnote that it is natural to think of a model as analogous to the\nontological framework of a scientific theory where the various\nontological commitments can function as \u2018adjustable\nparameters\u2019\u2014for example, the Ptolemaic and Copernican\nworld pictures both begin with a claim that a certain entity (the sun\nor the earth) is at the center, and these models are articulated by\nproducing models with adjustable parameters.\n\nFor critical discussion of Sober and Hitchcock\u2019s account, see\nLee 2012, 2013 and Douglas & Magnus 2013: 582\u2013584. Peterson\n(2019) argues that Sober and Hitchcock's approach can be extended to\nissue methodological recommendations involving methods of cross\nvalidation and replication in psychology. \n",
