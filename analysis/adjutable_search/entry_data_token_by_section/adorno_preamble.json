    "main_text": "\n\n\nTheodor W. Adorno was one of the most important philosophers and\nsocial critics in Germany after World War II. Although less well known\namong anglophone philosophers than his contemporary Hans-Georg\nGadamer, Adorno had even greater influence on scholars and\nintellectuals in postwar Germany. In the 1960s he was the most\nprominent challenger to both Sir Karl Popper's philosophy of science\nand Martin Heidegger's philosophy of existence. J\u00fcrgen Habermas,\nGermany's foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno's student\nand assistant. The scope of Adorno's influence stems from the\ninterdisciplinary character of his research and of the Frankfurt\nSchool to which he belonged. It also stems from the thoroughness with\nwhich he examined Western philosophical traditions, especially from\nKant onward, and the radicalness to his critique of contemporary\nWestern society. He was a seminal social philosopher and a leading\nmember of the first generation of Critical Theory.\n\n\nUnreliable translations hampered the initial reception of Adorno's\npublished work in English speaking countries. Since the 1990s,\nhowever, better translations have appeared, along with newly\ntranslated lectures and other posthumous works that are still being\npublished. These materials not only facilitate an emerging assessment\nof his work in epistemology and ethics but also strengthen an already\nadvanced reception of his work in aesthetics and cultural theory.\n",
