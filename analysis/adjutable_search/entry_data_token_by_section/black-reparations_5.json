    "main_text": "Reparations for Slavery\n6. Reparations for Slavery\n\n\nThis entry focuses on making a case for reparations for contemporary\nU.S. blacks for the enslavement of their U.S.-enslaved ancestors,\npartly because slavery was one of the most horrific experiences that\nsaid blacks have endured in the U.S., and the one for which the\nimmediate victims of the experience most clearly deserve reparations;\nand partly because making the case in question nevertheless presents\npeculiar, difficult, and particularly interesting philosophical\nproblems. As we will see, much of that case will depend on the argument\nthat the injustices U.S. blacks endured after emancipation have caused\nsome of the injuries of the slaves to persist into the present. But\nthere is no reason to suppose that these injustices did not themselves\ncause damages to their victims, quite apart from causing the damages of\nslavery to persist, and that these damages may also deserve\nreparations. In fact, there is good reason to suppose that arguments to\nthat effect may be more important politically than slave-based\narguments for black reparations.\n\nStevens\u2019s argument for slave reparations was simply that the\nslave holders had committed serious harmful transgressions against the\nslaves, who consequently had rights for reparation against their\nmasters that could plausibly be satisfied by some of their\nmasters\u2019 land. Today, few would challenge that argument, at least\npublicly. The argument that many challenge today is that present day\nU.S. blacks have rights to reparations from contemporary U.S. citizens\nor the U.S. government because generations ago the U.S. government\npermitted many U.S. citizens to enslave several blacks. That argument\nseems to get no support from the undeniable fact that enslaved black\nancestors had rights to reparations from their respective masters.\nPeople do not have rights to reparations for the wrongful harms\nothers suffer. Two arguments, the harm argument and the\ninheritance argument, each attempt to circumvent this difficulty.\n\nThe harm argument relies on the idea that the transgressions of\nslavery initiated an unbroken chain of harms linked as cause and effect\nthat began with the slaves and continues among U.S. blacks to the\npresent day. Therefore, since the transgressions of slavery harm\npresent day U.S. blacks they have rights to reparations against those\nwho committed those transgressions. It differs crucially from the\ninheritance argument because it assumes that slavery\u2019s\ntransgressions against the slaves have harmed present day U.S. blacks\nbut the inheritance argument does not. The inheritance argument relies\non the idea that present-day U.S. blacks have inherited the rights to\nreparation that was owed their enslaved ancestors and was never\npaid.\n",
