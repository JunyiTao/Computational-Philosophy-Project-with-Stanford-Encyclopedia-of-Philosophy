Kant\ncredited Hume with waking him from his \u201cdogmatic slumber\u201d,\nand he describes the Critique of Pure Reason, arguably the\nmost important work of modern philosophy, as the solution to the\n\u201cHumean problem in its greatest possible amplification\u201d\n(Prol 4:260\u201361). Much of the focus has been on their respective\nviews in metaphysics and epistemology. Yet, as Thomas Nagel remarks,\ncontemporary moral philosophy also \u201ccontinues to be dominated by\nthe disagreement between these two giants\u201d (Nagel 2012).\nComparing Hume and Kant therefore provides opportunity to clarify and\nassess two of the modern era\u2019s most influential approaches\nto moral philosophy. Comparing their views also illuminates the\nlandscape of eighteenth-century ethical thought. There are fundamental\ndisagreements between them, but Kant and Hume share some central\nassumptions about morality, and Kant was directly influenced by the\nsentimentalist tradition to which Hume belongs (especially Francis\nHutcheson\u2019s version). The influence was most positive and pronounced\nearly in Kant\u2019s career, but it lingered long after he made a decisive\nbreak with this tradition.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, this article assumes familiarity with\nHume\u2019s and Kant\u2019s main contributions to moral philosophy.\nThe aim here is not to summarize their views or provide an exhaustive\ncomparison. Instead, the task is to examine several key areas where we\ncan reasonably see Kant as responding to or influenced by Hume, or\nwhere comparisons between their views are particularly fruitful.\n", "toc": [{"#MoraPhilSubjMatt": "1.

Moral Philosophy and its Subject Matter\n\nHume and Kant operate with two somewhat different conceptions of\nmorality itself, which helps explain some of the differences\nbetween their respective approaches to moral philosophy. The\nmost important difference is that Kant sees law, duty, and obligation\nas the very heart of morality, while Hume does not. In this respect,\nKant\u2019s conception of morality resembles what Bernard Williams\ncalls \u201cthe moral system\u201d, which defines the domain of\nmorality primarily in terms of an unconditionally binding and\ninescapable form of obligation (Williams 1985: 193\u201394). Kant\nbelieves that our moral concerns are dominated by the question of what\nduties are imposed on us by a law that commands with a uniquely moral\nnecessity. Like most eighteenth-century philosophers, he also believes\nthat our moral lives are preoccupied with the question of how to be\nvirtuous over a lifetime, but he defines virtue in terms of the more\nfundamental concepts of law, obligation, and duty. By contrast, these\nconcepts play a role in Hume\u2019s understanding, but they are far less\ncentral. For Hume, the broader and somewhat looser notion of\n\u201cpersonal merit\u201d lies at the heart of morality (EPM\n9.1.1). Our moral concerns are dominated by the question of which\nmotives are virtuous, and we answer this question by looking to the\nresponses of our fellow human beings, who\u2014when viewing things\nproperly\u2014approve of those motives and character traits that are\nuseful or immediately agreeable (EPM 9.1.13). These are the terms that\ncharacterize duty and obligation for Hume, rather than the other way\naround.\n\nTwo other differences are important to note. First, Kant draws a\nbright line between moral and non-moral phenomena, such as prudence,\npolitics, or aesthetics. Morality\u2019s normative standards and the\nnature of its demands distinguish it sharply from the non-moral. For\nHume, the line between the moral and non-moral is far blurrier. He\nfrequently assimilates moral judgment to \u201ctaste\u201d or\njudgments about beauty and deformity (Gill 2007), and he explicitly\nargues against the strict separation of moral virtues from other\npersonal qualities such as a quick wit or even good looks (T\n3.3.4\u20135). According to Hume, the strict separation of moral and\nnon-moral virtues marks one way in which modern moral thought is\ninferior to ancient ethics. He also seems to suspect that it reflects\nan unhealthy fixation on responsibility and guilt inherited from\nChristianity (Darwall 2013: 8\u20139).\n\nA second important difference is closely related to the first. For\nKant the moral is distinguished from the non-moral not only by a\nspecial form of obligation but also by its elevation above the rest of\nlife. Morality itself has a unique status or \u201cdignity\u201d, as\ndoes the rational being from whose autonomous will the law springs (G\n4:435). The proper response to both is a correspondingly unique form\nof reverence or \u201crespect\u201d, which morality demands equally\nfrom each of us. Kant believes that in the moral domain we take\nourselves\u2014often only implicitly\u2014to be\n\u201cpersons\u201d, elevated above mere \u201cthings\u201d such\nas machines or other animals. One of our chief moral concerns is to\nprotect this status, which requires respecting the rational autonomy\nat its source and avoiding behavior or patterns of thought and desire\nthat dishonor or degrade persons by treating ourselves or others as\nmere things. This concern looms large in Kant\u2019s conception of\nmorality, and it has a profound influence on his approach to moral\nphilosophy (Anderson 2008). We see it, for example, in his discussions\nof respect for persons and his characterization of ethical virtue as\n\u201clove of honor\u201d (cf. Denis 2014). We see it also in the\npriority given to duties to self (cf. Denis 2010a), as well as\nKant\u2019s claim that a person throws herself away and makes herself\nan object of \u201ccontempt\u201d when she lies to herself or\ngrovels before others, for example (MM 6:420). Hume does not see\nthings this way. For Hume, the domain of morality is not particularly\npure, special, or elevated. It sometimes shows us at our most\nbenevolent or most magnanimous, but morality is continuous with the\nrest of life, including politics and the pursuit of wealth and status\nin modern commercial society. Moral virtue is undoubtedly pleasing to\nus, sometimes powerfully so, but it does not command a unique\nform of respect or reverence. Neither do the rules and ideals of\nmorality, which spring from the same propensities, ideas, and passions\nthat drive the rest of human behavior. Notions of honor and dignity\nmay figure into Hume\u2019s view of morality but they are far from\ncentral. Morality has us far more concerned with promoting pleasure\nand utility.\n\nHume and Kant both believe that philosophy should offer a theory of\nmorality\u2019s foundation. When it comes to morality\u2019s foundation,\nthey seem to agree on two things. First, morality\u2019s foundation\ncannot be found in religion. Second, it cannot be found in\nmind-independent facts about the world. Yet they disagree about the\nrest of the story. Hume locates the foundation of morality in human\nnature, primarily in our emotional responses to the behavior of our\nfellow human beings. By contrast, Kant locates the foundation of\nmorality in the rational nature that we share with all possible finite\nrational beings. He argues that morality\u2019s foundation lies in\nthe \u201cautonomy\u201d of the rational will. Kant\u2019s notion\nof autonomy is one of the more central, distinctive, and influential\naspects of his ethics. He defines autonomy as \u201cthe property of\nthe will by which it is a law to itself (independently of any property\nof the objects of volition)\u201d (G 4:440). According to Kant, the\nwill of a moral agent is autonomous in that it both gives itself the\nmoral law (is self-legislating) and can constrain or motivate itself\nto follow the law (is self-constraining or self-motivating). The\nsource of the moral law is not in the agent\u2019s feelings or\ninclinations, but in her \u201cpure\u201d rational will, which Kant\nidentifies as the \u201cproper self\u201d (G 4:461). A heteronomous\nwill, on the other hand, is governed by something other than itself,\nsuch as an external force or authority.\n\nThese rival conceptions of morality and its foundation correspond to\ntwo very different approaches to moral philosophy. Hume\u2019s\napproach could be called naturalistic, empirical, or experimental. His\nmoral philosophy is part of his larger endeavor to provide a\nnaturalistic explanation of human nature as a whole. Hume\u2019s\napproach relies on and reflects his philosophy of mind, which is\nempirical in its approach. He treats ethics, together with psychology,\nhistory, aesthetics, and politics, as the subject of his \u201cmoral\nscience\u201d. Hume often seems more interested in explaining\nmorality as a natural phenomenon than in setting out a normative\nethical theory, treating moral action as part of the same physical\nworld in which we explain things in terms of cause and effect (EHU\n8.1.20\u201322). On this view, everything we do is open to empirical\ninvestigation and explanation. In fact, Hume often compares humans\nwith other animals, tracing the bases of human morality to features of\nthe mind that human beings and other animals have in common (T\n2.1.12).\n\nIn sharp contrast with Hume, Kant insists on the need for an a\npriori investigation of morality\u2019s foundation. His detailed\ntreatment of virtue and moral judgment draws heavily on observations\nand ideas about human nature. But Kant makes explicit that morality\nmust be based on a supreme moral principle, which can only be\ndiscovered a priori, through a method of pure moral\nphilosophy (G 4:387\u201392). By \u201cpure\u201d or a\npriori moral philosophy, Kant has in mind a philosophy grounded\nexclusively on principles that are inherent in and revealed through\nthe operations of reason. According to Kant, the a priori\napproach is required because morality\u2019s commands are\nunconditional. We could never discover a principle that commands all\nrational beings with such absolute authority through Hume\u2019s method. An\nempirical approach, he argues, can tell us how people do act, but it\ncannot tell us how we ought to act. Once equipped with the supreme\nprinciple of morality, however, one still requires an understanding of\nhuman beings in order to apply it (MM 6:217). This is important for\nKant. One can say little about what the supreme moral principle\nrequires in concreto without knowing such things as the sorts\nof ends people may be inclined to adopt and the conditions under which\nhuman agency will characteristically thrive or wither. As noted below\nand throughout, this is one area of Kant\u2019s moral thinking that was\nsignificantly influenced by Hume and his fellow sentimentalists.\n2. Kant\u2019s Relationship to Hume and British Moral Philosophy\n\nHume exerted a profound influence on Kant\u2019s theoretical philosophy.\n(See, e.g., Guyer 2008, Kuehn 2017, Kuehn 1987b, and Kuehn 1983.) Kant\nreports that his \u201clabor\u201d in the Critique of Pure\nReason was fundamentally a response to \u201cthat Humean\nskeptical teaching\u201d (CPrR 5:32). But the impact of Hume\u2019s\nmoral philosophy was far less direct. On the one hand, Kant\u2019s early\nethical writings are filled with positive appraisals of moral sense\ntheory or sentimentalism, and his own views reveal a significant debt\nto this tradition. On the other hand, Kant seems to associate the best\nof this tradition with Hutcheson more than with Hume (Kuehn 2001:\n182). However, Hume exerted a powerful influence on Kant\u2019s\nanthropological writings and lectures (Louden 2017), and the\nanthropological side of Kant\u2019s enterprise shaped his thinking about\nthe application of a priori moral philosophy to real human\nbeings.\n\nSentimentalism\u2019s positive influence on Kant\u2019s work was strongest\nduring the early part of his career (e.g., Walschots 2017 and Sensen\n2017). The influence is most pronounced in two of his published works\nfrom the 1760s. In Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful\nand Sublime (1764), Kant notes and analyzes the various feelings\nof pleasure or displeasure, and attraction and aversion, people feel\nto different traits and temperaments in themselves and others (and to\ndifferent types of literature, objects in nature, etc.). His remarks\nabout morality convey a commitment to some form of sentimentalism,\nhowever idiosyncratic. He claims, for example, that the principles of\nmorality are \u201cnot speculative rules, but the consciousness of a\nfeeling that lives in every human breast and that extends much further\nthan to the special grounds of sympathy and complaisance\u201d (OFBS\n2.217). He describes this as \u201cthe feeling of the beauty and the\ndignity of human nature\u201d, proclaiming that one can \u201cbring\nabout the noble attitude that is the beauty of virtue\u201d only when\na person \u201csubordinates\u201d her particular inclinations\n\u201cto such an enlarged\u201d feeling of the beauty and dignity of\nhuman nature (OFBS 2.217). Kant advances similar claims in another\nwork from the period, Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the\nPrinciples of Natural Theology and Morality (1763), where he\ndistinguishes between the faculty for representing truth and the\nfaculty for experiencing the good, identifying the latter with\nfeeling. \u201cJust as there are unanalyzable concepts of\nthe true,\u201d Kant argues, \u201cso too there is an unanalyzable feeling\nof the good\u2026 One of the tasks of the understanding is to\nanalyze and render distinct the compound and confused concept of the\ngood by showing how it arises from simpler feelings of the good\u201d (I\n2:299).\n\nOther indications of sentimentalism\u2019s influence can be found in\nKant\u2019s notes and lectures from that period. For example, in the\nannouncement of his lectures for the winter semester of\n1765\u20131766, he asserts that \u201cthe distinction between good and\nevil in actions, and the judgment of moral rightness, can be known,\neasily and accurately, by the human heart through what is called\nsentiment, and that without elaborate necessity of proofs\u201d (WS 2:311).\nIn the same announcement, he states his intention to develop and\nclarify \u201cthe attempts of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson and Hume, which,\nthough imperfect and defective, have nevertheless come farthest in the\ndiscovery of the first principles of all morality\u201d (WS 2:311).\nSimilarly, in notes that appear to come from between 1764 and 1768,\nKant writes, \u201c[t]he rules of morality proceed from a special,\neponymous feeling, upon which the understanding is\nguided\u2026\u201d (NF 19:93 #6581).\n\nAs Kant\u2019s views developed over the 1760s, his view of sentimentalism\ngrew more negative. By the late 1760s, he was arguing that this\ntradition could not possibly provide an adequate account of moral\nobligation. Morality imposes unconditional requirements, and he became\nincreasingly convinced that sentimentalism could not explain or\njustify such requirements. Arguments for this conclusion became\ncentral to Kant\u2019s later writings and lectures. In several works,\nKant creates taxonomies of misguided, heteronomous ethical theories\nbased on material determining grounds\u2014in contrast to his theory\nof autonomy, in which the moral motive constitutes an objective,\nformal determining ground (see Wood 2005b [Other Internet Resources];\nIrwin 2009: chapters 68 and 71; and Schneewind 2009). Kant\ndistinguishes among these theories based on their accounts of the\nbasis of moral obligation or the fundamental moral principle (G\n4:441\u201344; CPrR 5:39\u201341; C 27: 252\u201354; M\n29:621\u201325). Such theories may assume either subjective\n(empirical) or objective (rational) determining grounds for the moral\nprinciple; and within each of these categories, there are theories\nthat assume these determining grounds are external, and others that\nassume they are internal. Objective, internal grounds include\nperfection (e.g., Wolff and the Stoics). Objective, external grounds\ninclude the will of God (e.g., Crusius). Subjective, external grounds\ninclude education (e.g., Montaigne) or civil constitution (e.g.,\nMandeville). Subjective, internal grounds can include physical\nfeeling, such as self-love (e.g., Epicurus) or self-interest (e.g.,\nHobbes), or moral feeling (e.g., Hutcheson) (CPrR 5:40; C 27:253).\nThus, Kant locates moral sense theories among those theories that\nassume a subjective, empirical, internal determining ground of moral\nfeeling as the principle of morality (cf. M 29:621).\n\nFrom the Groundwork on, Kant\u2019s objections to sentimentalism\nconcentrate on what he takes to be its fatal flaw. No empirical\nprinciples can ground moral laws because such laws bind all rational\nbeings universally, necessarily, and unconditionally. The authority of\nempirical principles, by contrast, depends on contingent aspects of\nhuman nature (G 4:442\u201343). Furthermore, variance in moral\nfeelings makes them an inadequate standard of good and evil (G 4:442).\nMoral feelings cannot be the source of the supreme moral principle\nbecause the supreme moral principle holds for all rational beings,\nwhereas feelings differ from person to person (M 29:625). If duty were\ngrounded in feeling, morality would bind some people (e.g., the\ntender-hearted) more strongly than others. Even if people were in\ncomplete agreement regarding their moral feelings, the agreement would\nbe a contingent matter, and thus an inadequate ground for the moral\nlaw, as Kant understands it. Indeed, if morality were grounded in\nfeeling, it would be arbitrary: God could have constituted us so that\nwe would get from vice the pleasurable, calm feelings of approval that\nwe now (allegedly) get from virtue (M 29:625). So for Kant, the\ncontingency of the ground of obligation offered by moral sense\ntheories renders those theories inadequate; only a priori\ndetermining grounds will do.\n\nAs these criticisms indicate, Kant\u2019s mature thinking vehemently\nrejects sentimentalism\u2019s approach to the foundation of morality. Yet\nthe influence of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume lingered long after\nKant came to believe that morality\u2019s true foundation lies in the\nautonomy of the will. In his notes, Kant remarks that while moral\nsense theories cannot justify our moral judgments, or provide the\nstandards that should guide them, such theories do offer compelling\nempirical explanations of how we actually judge action (NF 19:117\n#6626). In the same vein, he suggests that even if one rejects moral\nsense \u201cas a principle for the judgment of moral action,\u201d\none might still accept it as a theory \u201cof the mind\u2019s\nincentives to morality\u201d (M 29:625). Kant also continues to\nendorse some version of his earlier claim in Observations\nthat some of our feelings indicate a \u201csusceptibility of the soul\nwhich\u2026 makes it fit for virtuous impulses\u201d (OFBS 2:208).\nWe see this in the Metaphysics of Morals, for instance, where\nKant claims that moral feeling, conscience, love of one\u2019s\nneighbor, and self-respect all \u201clie at the basis of morality, as\nsubjective conditions of receptiveness to the concept of\nduty\u201d (MM 6:399; see Guyer 2010). The lingering influence of\nsentimentalism can also be seen in his emphasis on the obligation to\n\u201csympathize actively\u201d with others, and in the claim that\nwe have \u201can indirect duty to cultivate the compassionate natural\n(aesthetic) feelings in us, and to make use of them as so many means\nto sympathy based on moral principles and the feeling appropriate to\nthem\u2026. For this [compassion] is still one of the impulses that\nnature has implanted in us to do what the representation of duty alone\nmight not accomplish\u201d (MM 6:457).\n3. Reason and Emotion in Morality\n\nKant, as discussed above, underwent a decisive change of mind about\nthe views of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume. Early in his career, he\nendorsed core aspects of their approach, but Kant\u2019s mature work\nis organized around the idea that reason, rather than feeling\nor emotion, is the highest authority in the moral domain. In this\nrespect, many features of his moral philosophy are fundamentally\nopposed to Hume\u2019s. We can see this opposition in their\nrespective accounts of moral judgment and moral motivation. A careful\nlook at these topics, however, also highlights sentimentalism\u2019s\nresidual influence on Kant.\n\nAccording to Hume, moral judgments typically concern the character\ntraits and motives behind human actions. To make a moral judgment is\nto detect, by means of a sentiment, the operation of a virtuous or\nvicious quality of mind. The sentiment here is a\n\u201cpeculiar\u201d kind of feeling\u2014namely, a feeling of\napproval (love, pride) or disapproval (hatred, humility) (T 3.3.1.3).\nWe call the traits that elicit our approval \u201cvirtues\u201d, and\nthose that elicit our disapproval \u201cvices\u201d. Sentiments of\napproval and disapproval are passions, but they tend to be \u201csoft\nand gentle\u201d and therefore easily mistaken for thoughts or ideas\n(T 3.1.2.1). The real story is that \u201cmorality\u2026 is more\nproperly felt than judg\u2019d of\u201d (T 3.1.2.1). Reason and\nexperience are required for determining the likely effects of a given\nmotive or character trait, so reason does play an important role in\nmoral judgment. Yet reason\u2019s role is subordinate. It is one\nthing to say that a given trait tends to be useful or conducive to\npleasure and quite another to say that it is \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d. The moral value of a trait is conferred by the\nsentiment of approval, which \u201cgilding and staining all natural\nobjects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises, in\na manner, a new creation\u201d (EPM App. I.21). Hume argues, however,\nthat only those sentiments experienced from a \u201cgeneral point of\nview\u201d count as genuinely moral (T 3.1.2.4). For example, a\nperson might hate or envy the courage of her enemy but this is not\nnecessarily a moral response. The moral sentiment is\nexperienced when she considers her enemy\u2019s courage from a\n\u201cgeneral point of view\u201d (T 3.1.2.4). When a person\nconsiders things from this point of view, she looks upon them as a\n\u201cjudicious spectator\u201d, who is disinterested but still\nemotionally responsive to the scene she beholds (Cohon 2008:\n126\u201358). Rather than eliminating her sentiments, the judicious\nspectator enlarges them by means of sympathy, which enables her to\nresent the misery of others or rejoice in their happiness. (On\nsympathy, see Owen 2009 and Taylor 2015: 189\u201394.)\n\nKant offers a very different account of moral judgment. He focuses on\nthe first-person judgments an agent (not a spectator) must make about\nhow to behave. In his view, the primary question is what the moral law\npermits, forbids, or requires. Passion or sentiment cannot answer such\na question. Instead, answering it requires an operation of\nreason by means of which the agent determines whether her\nprinciple or \u201cmaxim\u201d of conduct conflicts with the moral\nlaw. Because she is an imperfect and finite rational being, the law\npresents itself to her as a \u201ccategorical imperative\u201d (CI).\nIt is an imperative because it commands and constrains us; it is\ncategorical because it commands and constrains us with ultimate\nauthority and without regard to personal preferences or any\nempirically contingent ends (G 4:413\u201320). The two best known\nformulations of the CI are the formula of universal law (FUL), which\ncommands, \u201cact only in accordance with that maxim through\nwhich you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw\u201d (G 4:421), and the formula of the end in itself (FEI),\nwhich commands, \u201cSo act that you use humanity, whether in\nyour own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time\nas an end, never merely as a means\u201d (G 4:429). Scholars\ndisagree about the relationship between these two formulations of the\nCI, as well as their relationship to the other formulations Kant\nprovides. There is also disagreement about whether FUL or FEI has\nprimacy in deliberation and moral judgment. Kant claims that FUL is\nthe standard everyone actually employs in moral judgment (G 4:402;\nCPrR 5:69), and some scholars defend its primacy (e.g., Engstrom\n2009). Others argue in favor of FEI, emphasizing, in particular, its\nrole in the Metaphysics of Morals, where FEI seems to play\nthe fundamental role in guiding judgment about specific ethical duties\n(e.g., Wood 1999).\n\nSome passages from Kant\u2019s work seem to suggest that moral\njudgment requires no experience, no knowledge of human nature and\nlocal custom, and no emotional sensitivity. A rational being equipped\nwith the correct formal procedure has all she needs. Yet such passages\nare misleading when read in isolation. This is not Kant\u2019s view\nof how human beings do, or even should, make moral judgments (Wood\n2008: 56). First, application of the CI typically requires auxiliary\nor subordinate \u201cprinciples of application\u201d, which must be\ntaken from our empirical knowledge of human nature (MM 6:217). Second,\nKant frequently emphasizes that no formal procedure could specify all\nthe principles for applying higher-order principles. Principles of\napplication help us apply higher order principles to concrete\ncircumstances, but there is no substitute for experience and\n\u201cjudgment\u201d, which is a knack or uncodifiable talent\n(A138/B172). The need for judgment explains why the practice of\ncasuistry is \u201cwoven into ethics\u201d (MM 6:411). Furthermore,\nthe wider the duty, the more latitude for individual judgment and\nexperience (MM 6:390). Finally, Kant believes that moral judgment\nrequires emotional sensitivity and an understanding of social\nconvention. For example, without these, one might be unable to\ndetermine whether a particular act of beneficence is more\ncondescending than kind (MM 6:453), or to prevent friendly banter from\nsliding into disrespectful mockery (MM 6:467). Proper moral judgment\nin such circumstances requires attunement to the feelings of others,\nbut also facility with the social conventions that shape the dynamics\nof personal interaction.\n\nKant and Hume fundamentally disagree on the question of reason\u2019s\nauthority. Hume assigns reason to a subordinate role, while Kant takes\nreason to be the highest normative authority. However, it is important\nnot to misunderstand the nature of their opposition. Hume offers an\nempirical explanation of the moral judgments made in \u201ccommon\nlife\u201d, which he takes to be part of his broader science of human\nnature. This is his focus. By contrast, though Kant makes observations\nabout the \u201ccommon\u201d use of reason in morality (e.g., G\n4:399), this is not his focus. He says relatively little about what is\ngoing on in our heads or the surrounding social environment when we\nmake moral judgments. As noted above, Kant at least entertained the\npossibility that sentimentalism provides the best empirical\nexplanation of our patterns of approval and disapproval (NF 19:117\n#6626). What Kant insists on is that such responses can be justified\nonly by pure reason, which is the only faculty capable of\nunderstanding the unconditional necessity of the moral law\u2019s\ncommands. Emotion or feeling plays a crucial role in guiding our\napplication of the law to particular maxims in concrete circumstances,\nbut feeling\u2019s role is fully subordinate to reason\u2019s\n(Sensen 2017: 135\u2013137).\n\nA similar contrast between Hume and Kant can be found in their\nrespective accounts of moral motivation. Hume famously claims that\n\u201cReason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and\ncan never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem\u201d (T 2.3.3.4). The claim is not that reason has no role in\nhuman action, but rather that its role is entirely subordinate to\npassion. Hume offers three main arguments for this claim in A\nTreatise of Human Nature. There is considerable debate about how\nthese arguments work, the precise nature of Hume\u2019s famous\nanti-rationalism, and whether his position changed from the\nTreatise to the second Enquiry. (See, e.g., Milgram\n1995; Radcliffe 1997 and 2018; Cohon 2008: chapters 2 and 3; and Irwin\n2008: chapter 26.)\n\nAccording to the first argument, \u201creason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will\u201d (T 2.3.3.1). Abstract (or\ndemonstrative) reasoning, which involves a priori inferences\nand judgments pertaining to relations of ideas, cannot influence the\nwill, but only assist us in our pursuit of an end we already have. For\nexample, probable reasoning helps us discover causal relations among\nobjects of experience conducive to the realization of pre-selected\nends, but such information about cause and effect can never motivate\naction on its own: \u201cIt can never in the least concern us to\nknow, that such objects are causes, and such others effects, if both\ncauses and effects be indifferent to us\u201d (T 2.3.3.3). In order\nto be motivated to act, we must first anticipate pleasure or pain from\nsomething. That anticipated pleasure or pain gives rise to feelings of\ndesire or aversion for the object in question. Probable reasoning\nallows us to discern the causes of this object; our positive or\nnegative feelings about the object then spread to the causes of it;\nand we are then motivated to pursue or to avoid them. Simply believing\nthat one thing causes another will not motivate action (T\n2.3.3.2).\n\nA second argument, which builds on the first, aims to show that reason\n\u201ccan never oppose passion in the direction of the will\u201d (T\n2.3.3.1). The only thing that can oppose an impulse to action\ngenerated by one passion is a contrary impulse. Reason, then, could\ncounteract an impulse to action generated by a passion if and only if\nreason could itself generate a contrary impulse. But from the first\nargument, we know that that reason cannot generate such an impulse.\n\u201cThus it appears, that the principle, which opposes any passion,\ncannot be the same with reason, and is only called so in an improper\nsense\u201d (T 2.3.3.4). Hume goes on to say that whatever we feel in\nus running contrary to an impulse to act that we mistake for reason\nmust be something else, such as a calm passion (e.g., a general\nappetite for the good, benevolence, or aversion to evil; T\n2.3.3.8).\n\nThe third argument claims that a passion is an \u201coriginal\nexistence\u201d, not an idea, or a mental copy of another object.\nContradiction to truth and reason \u201cconsists in the disagreement\nof ideas, consider\u2019d as copies, with those objects, which they\nrepresent\u201d (T 2.3.3.5). Therefore, a passion cannot be contrary\nto truth and reason. Passions cannot, strictly speaking, be evaluated\nas reasonable or unreasonable, despite our practice of calling\npassions unreasonable or irrational when they depend in some way on\npoor reasoning or false beliefs. Later in the Treatise, Hume\nextends this argument to volitions and actions as well (T 3.1.1.9). We\nmight view Kant\u2019s conflict in conception and contradiction in\nwill tests of the formula of universal law to constitute refutations\nof the latter argument (G 4:421\u201324; see Guyer 2008: ch. 5).\n\nHume draws important anti-rationalist moral conclusions from this line\nof thought. One obvious implication is that reason cannot be the\nmotive to moral action; if reason cannot motivate any action,\nit cannot motivate moral action. A second further conclusion is that\nmorality and its basic principles cannot be grounded in reason. This\none follows both from his views about the \u201cinertness\u201d of\nreason generally, and from his assumption that morality has real\nmotivational power: \u201cMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent\nactions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The\nrules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of reason\u201d (T\n3.1.1.6).\n\nKant never directly addresses the above arguments, but he clearly\nrejects Hume\u2019s claim that reason is motivationally\n\u201cimpotent\u201d or enslaved to the passions. It is a central\nfeature of his moral philosophy that pure reason can be\n\u201cpractical\u201d\u2014that reason can \u201cof itself,\nindependently of anything empirical, determine the will\u201d (CPrR\n5: 42). He says of right actions that they \u201cneed no\nrecommendation\u201d from emotion or personal inclination. Such\nactions \u201crepresent the will that practices them as the object of an\nimmediate respect, and nothing but reason is required to\nimpose them upon the will\u201d (G 4:435). Moreover, in the first\nsection of the Groundwork, Kant repeatedly emphasizes the\nspecial form of \u201cmoral worth\u201d that attaches to right\nactions that are performed simply because they are right\u2014i.e.,\nactions motivated from \u201cfrom duty\u201d or \u201cfrom respect\nfor the law\u201d (G 4:396\u2013401; see Timmermann 2009a).\n\nDespite his emphasis on the motivational efficacy of pure reason,\nKant\u2019s discussion of respect makes clear that feeling plays an\nimportant role in human moral motivation (see Guyer 2008: ch. 5; and\nGuyer 2010). Early in the Groundwork, Kant describes respect\nin a manner that makes it sound like a felt aspect of the law itself:\n\u201can action from duty is to put aside entirely the influence of\ninclination, and with it every object of the will; hence there is left\nfor the will nothing that could determine it the except objectively\nthe law and subjectively pure respect for this\npractical law\u201d (G 4:400). However, his subsequent account makes\nrespect sound more like a separate feeling that arises from\nreason:\n\n\nBut although respect is a feeling, it is not one received by means of\ninfluence; it is, instead, a feeling self-wrought by a\nrational concept and therefore specifically different from all\nfeelings of the first kind, which can be referred to inclination or\nfear. What I cognize immediately as a law for me, I cognize with\nrespect, which signifies merely consciousness of the subordination of\nmy will to a law without the mediation of other influences on any\nsense. Immediate determination of the will by means of the law and the\nconsciousness of this is called respect, so that this is\nregarded as the effect of the law on the subject, and not as\nthe cause of the law. (G 4:401 n; also see 460)\n\n\nEven though we cannot know (or \u201cmake intelligible a\npriori\u201d) how a thought or judgment about the morality of an\naction \u201ccan itself produce a sensation of pleasure or\npain\u201d, Kant thinks that this somehow does happen; it must, if\nmoral considerations are to be motivating in beings like us. The\nphenomenology of respect is unusual, as it involves both pain and\npleasure (or something like it). There is the humiliation an agent\nfeels when the moral law strikes down her self-conceit; but respect\nalso feels invigorating and ennobling, since the moral law comes from\nthe agent\u2019s own reason and represents her higher self and\nvocation (CPrR 5:73).\n\nHowever one interprets the phenomenology, respect seems to function as\nan intermediary between reason and the will. This raises questions\nabout the consistency of Kant\u2019s view, since he argues repeatedly\nthat pure reason can, and should, determine the will\n\u201cimmediately\u201d. For this and other reasons, scholars are\ndivided on how to interpret Kant\u2019s treatment of respect.\nAccording to an \u201cintellectualist\u201d line of interpretation,\nrespect is the effect of pure reason\u2019s motivational\ninfluence on the will. In other words, we grasp the law by means of\nreason, are moved to act accordingly, and feel respect as a result of\nbeing so moved. According to an \u201caffectivist\u201d approach,\nhowever, respect is the proximate cause of reason\u2019s\ninfluence on the will. In other words, our rational grasp of the\nlaw\u2019s demand produces a feeling of respect or reverence, which\nthen moves the will (or higher faculty of desire). Vexingly, both\ninterpretations have a strong textual basis and both have been\ndefended with great skill and insight. (For an excellent discussion of\nthe issues, see Frierson 2014: ch. 4; see also Sensen 2017, especially\n129\u2013134. On the various forms of respect and the different roles\nthey play, see Williamson 2018.)\n\nIn the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant argues that additional\nfeelings also play a role in motivating virtuous conduct. He lists\nmoral feeling, conscience, love of human beings, and respect (for\noneself) as special kinds of feelings of which we are made aware only\nthough consciousness of the moral law (MM 6:399). Kant describes these\nas \u201cmoral endowments\u201d that \u201clie at the basis of\nmorality\u201d or the \u201csubjective conditions of\nreceptivity to the concept of duty\u201d (MM 6:399). Since our\ncompliance with duty presupposes our having these feelings, there is\nno duty for us to have them. However, because of their\nindispensability to human morality, there is a duty to cultivate them.\nAdditionally, Kant clearly sees moral value in some sensibly-grounded\n(\u201cpathological\u201d) feelings (MM 6:456\u201357, 458; also M\n29:626; NF 19:77 #6560). Speaking of sympathy, which is perhaps the\nbest example of this sort of feeling, Kant says \u201cit is\u2026 an\nindirect duty to cultivate the natural\u2026 feelings in us, and to\nmake use of them as so many means to sympathy based on moral\nprinciples and the feeling appropriate to them\u201d (MM 6:457).\n\nSympathy allows us better to understand others\u2019 needs, helps us\nto communicate our concern for them, and can act as an additional\nincentive to facilitate our promotion of our happiness helping others.\nSuch sensibly-grounded feelings can work with rationally-grounded\nfeelings to motivate action. We may cultivate sympathetic feelings\nfrom respect for the law, and then find these feelings prompting us to\nact in certain ways. In this context, where the focus is on virtue,\nKant sounds closer to Hume than he is often taken to be. Indeed,\naccording to one prominent interpretation, careful consideration of\nthis and other relevant material highlights at least a few \u201cdeep\naffinities\u201d between Kant on Hume on motivation and practical\nreason (Guyer 2008: 164). Yet the affinities should not be overstated.\nKant\u2019s view of sympathy is appreciative but wary, and sympathy for him\ndoes not play the prominent role it plays for Hume. (On Kant\u2019s view of\nthe upsides and downsides of sympathy, see Sorensen 2018. Cf.\nSayre-McCord 2015 on sympathy\u2019s role in Hume\u2019s theory of moral\njudgment.)\n\nDespite several surprising similarities, Kant and Hume clearly\ndisagree on the basic question of whether pure reason, to use\nKant\u2019s expression, can be motivationally efficacious. Kant\nthinks it can, while Hume does not. However, one must interpret this\ndisagreement with care. First, Kant\u2019s account of respect makes\nclear that feeling or emotion is involved even when pure reason\nmotivates action. The \u201caffectivist\u201d interpretation of\nrespect, in particular, suggests that Kant and Hume may agree that\nreason cannot motivate action without the intervention of feeling.\n(For a similar point about the French and British moral rationalists\nHume probably read, see Radcliffe 2019.) The crucial difference\nbetween them is that Kant believes pure reason capable of producing a\nmotivationally efficacious feeling (respect), while Hume believes\nnothing of the sort. The opposition between them is even starker if\nthe \u201cintellectualist\u201d interpretation of Kantian respect is\ncorrect. Second, Kant\u2019s account of virtue makes it clear that\nfeelings such as love and sympathy often play an important moral role\nin the motivation of human action. Indeed, feelings appear to be\nindispensable for human beings and should therefore be cultivated and\nstrengthened through deliberate practice.\n\nOne must also keep track of the level at which these two philosophers\ndisagree. Consider, for example, the reason why Hume would adamantly\nreject Kant\u2019s attribution of a special form of \u201cmoral\nworth\u201d to actions done \u201cfrom duty\u201d. According to\nHume,\u201cno action can be virtuous, or morally good, unless there be\nin human nature some motive to produce it, distinct from a sense of\nits morality\u201d (T 3.2.1.7). To avoid circularity, there must be a\nmotive to virtuous action that does not itself refer to the moral\ngoodness of the act (T 3.2.1.4). For Hume, the only time one would\nhave to rely on one\u2019s sense of the goodness of an act to\nmotivate oneself to do it is when one is deficient in the natural\nfeelings that ordinarily prompt people to act morally (e.g., natural\naffection, generosity, gratitude). The two philosophers do not\nnecessarily disagree on the empirical question of what\nactually motivates people. Note that Hume seems to countenance the\npossibility of being motivated directly by the sense of an\naction\u2019s moral goodness. Kant, in fact, seems comparatively\nskeptical; he expresses doubt that there have ever been human actions\nmotivated from duty alone (e.g., G 4:406\u2013407). They disagree\nsharply, however, on the normative question at issue. Kant\nbelieves that the most morally admirable actions are performed\n\u201cfrom duty\u201d alone. These are the only actions that have\ntrue \u201cmoral worth\u201d. By contrast, Hume believes that such\nactions indicate a character flaw. Indeed, if a person finds she is\nmoved to act only by the sense that the action is good, she may very\nwell reproach herself for a lack of generosity or gratitude, for\nexample, and consequently form a desire to change her character.\n4. Virtues and Vices\n\nHume and Kant both treat the concepts of virtue and vice as central to\nhuman morality. But they differ on the basic nature of virtue, and\nthey offer different catalogues of the virtues and vices. Kant\u2019s\ndiscussions reflect his consistent emphasis on freedom, dignity,\nrationality, and purity of motive. Hume\u2019s reflect his emphasis\non utility, pleasure, and the inherently social nature of the mind.\nCorrespondingly, the notion of internal struggle is central to\nKant\u2019s account, while Hume portrays virtue in comparatively\nrelaxed and genial terms. Relatedly, Hume is far more comfortable with\nthe bourgeois virtues integral to successful participation in modern\ncommercial and political society (cf. EPM 9.1.2). By contrast, Kant is\nwarier of society\u2019s influence on the individual, more insistent\non the need to resist the power of what Rousseau calls\namour-propre.\n\nFor Hume, the concepts of virtue and vice apply primarily to character\ntraits or \u201cmental qualities\u201d, and secondarily to occurrent\nmotives and actions. According to Hume, a character trait is a virtue\nif, and only if, it \u201cgives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment\nof approbation\u201d (EPM App. I.10). Vices, by contrast, are those\ntraits that generate a displeasing sentiment of disapproval.\nHume\u2019s definition builds on his account of moral judgment, and\nit makes virtue dependent on the responses of a\n\u201cjudicious\u201d spectator who contemplates things from a\ngeneral point of view. The trait of prudence, for example, is a virtue\nbecause it tends to be pleasing to such a spectator. As Hume\nputs it, the defining mark of a virtue is that it has the \u201cpower\nof producing love or pride\u201d when surveyed from the general point\nof view (T 3.3.1.3). In other words, a trait is a virtue only insofar\nas it tends to provoke the moral sentiment of approval in a properly\nsituated spectator. If it did not tend to provoke this response, it\nwould not be a virtue. Note how this marks a significant departure\nfrom Aristotelian conceptions of virtue, which says instead that a\ncharacter trait\u2019s goodness is a function of the role it plays in\nthe agent\u2019s own flourishing (Cohon 2008: 161).\n\nHume operates with a capacious catalogue of virtues and vices. His\naccount in the Treatise is organized around the distinction\nbetween \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cartificial\u201d virtues,\nwhich is easily misunderstood. The question is not whether some\nvirtues are fake or phony and others are authentic. The question is\nwhether some depend on social conventions and others do not.\nOrganizing his catalogue by means of this distinction allows Hume to\nsteer a middle path between those who see morality as entirely\nconventional (e.g., Bernard Mandeville) and those who believe it\nsprings directly from features of human nature that exist\nindependently of social convention (e.g., Francis Hutcheson).\nAccording to Hume, some virtues do depend on social convention but\nothers do not (Cohon 2008: 162\u2013163). In both cases, he seeks to\nexplain why people tend to develop such traits and why they tend to be\npleasing to judicious spectators. Hume drops the artificial-natural\ndistinction from the second Enquiry, but his investigations\nthere are motivated by the same questions and the resulting view also\nsteers a middle course between figures such as Mandeville and\nHutcheson.\n\nAccording to the Treatise, artificial virtues include\njustice, fidelity to promises, allegiance to government, and chastity.\nHume devotes much discussion to justice, which he treats as a\nparamount and paradigmatic artificial virtue. Hume understands justice\nprimarily as honesty with respect to property or conformity to\nconventions of property (T 3.2.2.28). Establishing a system of\nproperty allows us to avoid conflict and enjoy the possession and use\nof various goods. The social value of conventions involving property\nseems obvious. Yet one reason that justice receives such attention\nfrom Hume is that it poses a problem about moral motivation and moral\napproval. Hume claims that there must be a natural (non-moral) motive\nfor morally good actions. Otherwise they could only be done because\nthey are morally good, which would be circular, since our judgment of\nacts as morally good reflects our approval of the motives and traits\nthat give rise to the acts in question (T 3.2.1.7, 3.2.1.17). But this\nposition makes it hard to see how justice can be a virtue; for it is\nhard to find the requisite natural, nonmoral motive for it.\nSelf-interest is the natural motive that justifies our establishing\nrules regarding property (T 3.2.2.24); but self-interest is neither\nalways satisfied by just acts, nor approved in the way that traits we\ncall virtues generally are (T 3.2.1.9\u201310). Benevolence cannot be\nsuch a motive either, since it sometimes favors bending or suspending\nthe rules of justice, and benevolence lacks the power to motivate just\nconduct when it\u2019s difficult (e.g., T 3.2.1.12). Hume himself says that\n\u201ca sympathy with public interest is the source of\nthe moral approbation, which attends that virtue\u201d\n(T 3.2.2.24). But since sympathy with the public interest itself seems\nneither nonmoral nor inherent in human nature, this claim redescribes\nthe problem rather than solves it. Hume must ground sympathy for the\npublic interest in more obviously natural sentiments, and explain its\ndevelopment from them (e.g., as self-interest, corrected or redirected\nthrough education or the contrivances of politicians). Otherwise, Hume\nmust abandon his claim that all morally good actions\u2014even those\nassociated with artificial virtues\u2014have non-moral, natural\nmotives. (See Gauthier 1979; Mackie 1980: ch. 5; and Darwall 1995:\n302\u2013316.)\n\nThe natural virtues are good independently of social convention.\nHume\u2019s generous list of natural virtues includes beneficence,\nprudence, temperance, frugality, industry, assiduity, enterprise,\ndexterity, generosity, and humanity (T 3.3.1.24). In the second\nEnquiry, he distinguishes among virtues useful to others,\nvirtues useful to oneself, virtues immediately agreeable to oneself,\nand virtues immediately agreeable to others. Among qualities useful to\nothers are justice, fidelity, honor, allegiance, chastity, along with\nthe other \u201csocial virtues\u201d of humanity, generosity,\ncharity, affability, lenity, mercy, and moderation (EPM 5.2.44). Among\nqualities useful to ourselves are discretion, caution, enterprise,\nindustry, assiduity, frugality, economy, good sense, prudence,\ndiscernment (EPM 6.1.21). Among qualities contrary to our own\nwell-being are indolence, negligence, \u201cwant of order and\nmethod\u201d, obstinacy, fickleness, rashness, and credulity (EPM\n6.1.1). Qualities immediately agreeable to oneself include\ncheerfulness, tranquility, benevolence, and delicacy of taste.\nQualities immediately agreeable to others include good manners,\npoliteness, wit, ingenuity, decency, cleanliness, and a graceful or\ngenteel manner. What holds all these varied traits together as virtues\nis their evoking the sentiment of approval in spectators, itself\ngrounded in sympathy.\n\nLike Hume, Kant takes virtue to be central to human morality. But his\nbasic conception of virtue differs from Hume\u2019s, as does his\ncatalogue of particular virtues and vices. According to Kant, virtue\nis the form in which a being with an imperfect or non-holy will\nexpresses her supreme commitment to morality. Virtue is such a\nbeing\u2019s continually cultivated capacity to master her\ninclinations so as to fulfill her duties; a capacity whose cultivation\nand exercise is motivated by respect for the moral law (Denis 2006;\nBaxley 2010; Wilson 2015a). Several related claims are integral to\nKant\u2019s view. First, virtue is a general disposition to do\none\u2019s duty out of respect for the moral law (CPrR 5:128, 160; C\n27:300). Second, virtue is a kind of strength. More specifically,\nvirtue is \u201ca moral strength of the will\u201d (MM 6:405) or\n\u201cmoral strength in adherence to one\u2019s duty\u201d (Ant\n7:147). Third, virtue presupposes opposition and entails internal\nstruggle. Virtue\u2019s primary opponent is the \u201cradical evil\nin human nature\u201d\u2014a propensity to adopt maxims that\nprioritize self-love (and inclinations generally) over the moral law\n(Rel 6:29, 35\u201337, 57 n., 58). It is because of radical evil that\nvirtue implies struggle and demands strength. The fundamental task of\nthe virtuous person is to achieve the proper ordering of her\nincentives, giving the moral law undisputed priority over self-love.\nFinally, virtue is moral self-constraint \u201cbased on inner\nfreedom\u201d (MM 6:408), which is the capacity to act on the\nautonomously chosen principles of morality, even in the face of\ntemptation (MM 6:394, 405). Virtue both expresses and promotes inner\nfreedom. The greater one\u2019s moral strength and self-constraint,\nthe more one acts on reason rather than inclination or impulse (MM\n6:382 n).\n\nKant\u2019s catalogue of virtues and vices is organized by his system\nof duties. These duties are grounded in the moral law, the supreme\nprinciple of morality, which impresses itself on us as a categorical\nimperative. All duties must ultimately derive from this supreme moral\nprinciple. But in the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of particular duties of virtue is based more directly on\nwhat he calls the \u201csupreme principle of the doctrine of\nvirtue\u201d. This principle enjoins us to \u201cact in accordance\nwith a maxim of ends that it can be a universal law for\neveryone to have\u201d (MM 6:395). As Kant explains,\n\n\nIn accordance with this principle a human being is an end for himself\nas well as for others, and it is not enough that he is not authorized\nto use either himself or others merely as a means (since he could then\nstill be indifferent to them); it is in itself his duty to make the\nhuman being as such his end. (MM 6:395)\n\n\nDuties of virtue pertain to the ends, principles, and attitudes of\nagents. They aim to protect each agent\u2019s inner freedom, and they\ncannot be compelled by the state or any other external force. It is\nbecause duties of virtue alone are subject only to internal compulsion\nthat Kant calls them \u201cdirectly ethical duties.\u201d Among\nthese duties are the perfect duties to oneself to avoid vices of\nsuicide, self-mutilation, gluttony, drunkenness, sexual\nself-degradation (duties to oneself as an animal and moral being),\nlying, avarice, and servility (duties to oneself as a moral being\nonly); the imperfect duties to oneself concerning the promotion of the\nobligatory end of one\u2019s own natural and moral perfection, along\nwith duties to foster self-knowledge, compassion for animals, and\nappreciation of the beautiful in nature; the perfect duties to others\nto avoid the vices of arrogance, defamation, and ridicule (duties of\nrespect), and the imperfect duties to promote the end of others\nhappiness by means of beneficence, sympathy, and gratitude, as well as\nby avoiding malice, envy, and ingratitude (duties of love and vices\nopposed to them). Kant does not claim to derive these duties from the\ncategorical imperative or the supreme principle of virtue alone.\nRather, in moving from general principles of morality to moral duties,\nhe draws on a variety of considerations regarding human nature and\nother aspects of the natural world.\n\nHume and Kant share several influences, so there are unsurprising\nareas of overlap. First, like most eighteenth-century philosophers,\nboth regard the pursuit of virtue as central to human morality.\nSecond, Kant sides with Hume and Hutcheson against the psychological\negoism associated with Pufendorf, Hobbes, Locke, and Mandeville\n(Wilson 2015b; on this debate within British moral philosophy, see\nCrisp 2019 and Maurer 2019). Third, they both accept of versions of\nGrotius\u2019s influential distinction between perfect and imperfect\nduties, though their uses of the distinction differ (see Schneewind\n1990). Fourth, their respective conceptions of virtue are secular by\nhistorical standards. Neither recognizes duties to God, for example,\nand neither counts piety, hope, or monkish self-abasement among the\nvirtues (e.g.,\u00a0EPM 9.1.3 and\u00a0C 27:379\u201380).\n\nImportant differences stand out against this backdrop of agreement.\nHume defines virtue in terms of the moral sentiments of a judicious\nspectator who views things from a common point of view. Kant, by\ncontrast, defines virtue in terms of duty, obligation, and law. He\nthinks of virtue as moral strength, which is measured by an\nagent\u2019s ability to defeat those inclinations that oppose the\ndemands of the moral law (MM 6:405\u2013407). Hume\u2019s theory of\nvirtue has a place for duty and law, but these are not the fundamental\nconcepts in terms of which everything else must be explained or\njustified. Moreover, while Hume certainly recognizes virtues such as\nstrength of mind, fortitude, and courage, they are not central to his\nview of virtue as such. Their status as virtues depends on the moral\nsentiments of a judicious spectator, as well as the exigencies and\nconventions of a particular age (EPM \u201cA Dialogue\u201d.40). For\nKant, such factors are irrelevant to the basic question of what\ndetermines virtue and vice.\n\nA few additional differences are worth noting. First, unlike Hume,\nKant insists on the unitary nature of virtue: \u201cin its Idea\n(objectively) there is only one virtue (as moral strength of\none\u2019s maxims)\u201d (MM 6:447; cf. MM 6:395 and 406). Second,\nHume maintains that the concepts of virtue and vice can apply to\nthings outside our control, such as traits and motives that spring\ninvoluntarily from our basic temperament. For example, wit, good\nmemory, and other \u201cmental abilities\u201d are virtues because of their\npower to garner the approval of a judicious spectator, even if they\nspring from temperament, upbringing, or other factors outside the\nagent\u2019s control (T 3.3.4.1\u20135). Kant, by contrast, restricts the\napplication of virtue concepts to traits, behaviors, and attitudes\nthat are voluntarily adopted and cultivated as a matter of principle.\nEach virtue and each vice has its own maxim (MM 6:404). For example,\nbeing \u201cnaturally\u201d witty is not virtuous; neither is cultivating wit\nfor the sake of social status or power. For Kant, wittiness is not an\nethical virtue unless it is voluntarily cultivated for morally\nadmirable reasons. Third, Kant and Hume view justice quite\ndifferently. Justice is central to Hume\u2019s picture of morality, but\nKant does not treat it as an ethical virtue at all. For Kant, justice\nis a matter of right or law (Recht), which regulates actions\nbut not their underlying motives and ends. Furthermore, Hume treats\njustice as an \u201cartificial\u201d virtue, but Kant would reject the\nartificial-natural distinction altogether. On his view, ethical\nvirtues are neither artificial nor natural in Hume\u2019s sense. Finally,\ntheir conceptions of moral vice are quite different. For Hume a vice\nis a mental quality that provokes disapproval from a judicious\nspectator. A person\u2019s vices do not necessarily say anything\nabout the quality of her will as a whole or her fundamental attitude\ntoward the demands of morality. But Kant holds that vice is a\npropensity to act contrary to the moral law (Rel 6:37), and it implies\na genuine \u201ccontempt for moral laws\u201d (C 27:463).\nAs he puts it, \u201cit is when an intentional transgression has\nbecome a principle that it is properly called a vice\u201d\n(MM 6:390).\n5. Freedom and Necessity\n\nHume and Kant both believe that freedom is essential to morality.\nMoreover, both believe that a philosophical theory and vindication of\nhuman morality requires reconciling freedom with universal causal\nnecessity (determinism). However, they offer different conceptions of\nfreedom, different ways of reconciling it with necessity, and\ndifferent views about why this reconciliation matters for morality.\nScholars agree that Hume is a \u201ccompatibilist\u201d, but there\nis no consensus on the correct label for Kant\u2019s position.\n\nHume defends compatibilism in section eight of Enquiry concerning\nHuman Understanding and Book Two of the Treatise\n(2.3.1\u20132). In the Treatise, Hume distinguishes between\ntwo conceptions of freedom or liberty: \u201cliberty of\nindifference\u201d and \u201cliberty of spontaneity\u201d.\nAccording to the idea of indifference, liberty implies \u201ca\nnegation of necessity and causes\u201d (T 2.3.2.1). For illustration,\nconsider the Anglican bishop John Bramhall\u2019s claim that genuine\nliberty is \u201ca liberty from necessity, or rather from\nnecessitation, that is, a universal immunity from all inevitability\nand determination\u201d (1645 [1999: 1]). On this view, a person is\nfree when, and only when, her action is not necessitated by\nany antecedent causes. Hume rejects this idea as\nunintelligible (T 2.3.1.18) and destructive to morality and religion\n(T 2.3.2.5). By contrast, he characterizes spontaneity as that idea of\nliberty \u201cwhich is oppos\u2019d to violence\u201d (T 2.3.2.1).\nTherefore, the liberty of spontaneity is freedom from violence, but\nnot freedom from necessity per se. \u201cViolence\u201d\nhere refers to various forms of unwanted interference with the\nexecution of one\u2019s will, as when a person is forced to sign a\ndocument or locked in a cell from which she wants to escape. These are\ncases where we lack the liberty of spontaneity. But a person has such\nliberty whenever she is able to do what she wants to do. In such\ncases, her actions are causally necessitated, just like any other\nevent in nature; but they are caused by motives that spring from her\nown character. According to Hume, this is the form of liberty at issue\nin religion, morality, law, and common life. Hence, spontaneity is the\nonly form of liberty \u201cwhich it concerns us to preserve\u201d (T\n2.3.2.1).\n\nThe liberty of spontaneity, as just described, is perfectly compatible\nwith causal necessity. There are two main reasons people often believe\notherwise. First, we tend to conflate the two ideas of liberty. In\ncases where we enjoy the liberty of spontaneity, our experience\nsuggests that we also enjoy something more. We recognize, of course,\nthat \u201cwe were influenc\u2019d by particular views and\nmotives\u201d, yet we find it difficult to \u201cperswade ourselves\nwe govern\u2019d by necessity, and that \u2019twas utterly\nimpossible for us to have acted otherwise\u201d (T 2.3.2.1). This is\nbecause \u201c[w]e feel that our actions are subject to our will on\nmost occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to\nnothing\u201d (T 2.3.2.2). Yet the assumption that our will is\nsubject to nothing is a mistake caused by the blind spots of\nintrospection. An outside observer, whether a friend or a scientist,\n\u201ccan commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and\neven where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he\nperfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and\ntemper\u201d (T 2.3.2.2).\n\nThe second source of resistance to compatibilism stems from confusion\nabout necessity. People are prone to think that necessity rules out\nliberty because they conflate necessity with compulsion or force. They\nbelieve that when A causes B, A compels or forces B. Hume holds that\nthis is a mistake, however. Causal necessity is nothing more than the\n\u201cconstant conjunction\u201d of similar objects and a customary\ninference of the mind from the one to the other (EHU 8.1.5). For\nexample, experience shows that the vibration of a particular string is\nconstantly conjoined with a particular sound. As a result, the mind\ndevelops the habit of immediately inferring the sound from the\nvibration (EHU 7.2.29). We believe that the sound is causally\nnecessitated by the vibration, but the necessity is a product of the\nimagination, which associates the idea of the sound with the\nperception of the vibration. This feeling that there is a\nnecessary connection between them is the whole of the matter (EHU\n7.2.28). So defined, causal necessity no longer poses an obvious\nthreat to liberty. It makes sense to follow Bramhall\u2019s\ndefinition of liberty as \u201cliberty from necessity\u201d if one\nthinks that necessitation involves force or compulsion. But causes do\nnot force or compel their effects. If one can accept this point, then\na definition like Bramhall\u2019s seems less tempting, and necessity\nper se no longer poses a threat to liberty. The only real\nthreat is necessitation by external forces, as when a person is forced\nto do something she does not want to do.\n\nBroadly speaking, the scholarship offers two ways of interpreting\nHume\u2019s compatibilism. According to the most common approach,\nHume\u2019s arguments concern the logic of the concepts at issue. On\nthis reading, Hume analyzes the concepts of liberty and necessity to\nshow that, properly understood, they do not conflict. We can be\nrationally justified in holding a person responsible for her action\neven though all human actions are caused. The only question is whether\nshe, rather than some other person or external force, is the\ncause of her action. According to Paul Russell\u2019s naturalist\napproach, however, Hume\u2019s view is not primarily a piece of a\npriori reasoning about the logic of our concepts or the rational\njustification of attributions of moral responsibility. Above all it is\nan empirical explanation for why we sometimes feel that people are\nresponsible for their conduct. Hume\u2019s concern is with the\ncognitive processes that cause such attributions (Russell 1995: ch.\n4). He starts with the occasions in common life when we hold people\nresponsible for their behavior, and then asks, what happens in the\nmind on such occasions? On the standard reading, Hume\u2019s\ntreatment of liberty is a fairly self-contained set of compatibilist\narguments, quite detachable from his larger project. On the naturalist\nreading, it is deeply connected to his theory of the passions and\nmoral judgment, which makes it an integral part of his \u201cscience\nof man.\u201d\n\nHume claims that liberty, understood properly, is \u201cessential to\nmorality\u201d (EHU 8.31). The above interpretations provide two\ndifferent explanations for why this is the case. The standard approach\nsays that Hume\u2019s compatibilism is about the logic of our\nconcepts and the justification of our judgments. Our judgments about\nresponsibility entail judgments about the causal antecedents of\naction, and such judgments are consistent with determinism. On this\nview, the liberty of spontaneity is essential to morality because\nattributions of responsibility, which permeate morality (as well as\nlaw and religion), are unjust and unreasonable without it. According\nto the naturalist approach, liberty is essential for a different\nreason. The naturalist reading emphasizes that, on Hume\u2019s view,\nattributions of responsibility are made via feelings of\napproval and disapproval, not judgments (T 2.3.2.6; Russell 1995:\n60\u20134). They are, in his terminology, impressions or sentiments\nrather than ideas. These sentiments are partially caused by beliefs\nabout the source of the behavior to which we are responding. We would\nnot feel approval or disapproval unless we had been led to think of\nthe person as the cause of the action. If we believed that her action\nwas either compelled or uncaused, we would neither approve nor\ndisapprove of her. Our responses or thoughts would be about\nsomething else. Hume\u2019s claim, on the naturalist reading, is that\nin approving or disapproving of the agent\u2014in feeling gratitude\nor resentment, for example\u2014we hold her responsible, and in\nholding her responsible we believe that her conduct is free. Hume does\nnot argue that the latter justifies attributions of responsibility.\nHis claim is that it causally contributes to such attributions. They\nare made by means of feelings of approval and disapproval, which are a\ncore feature of human morality as we know it. Therefore, the idea of\nliberty, properly reconciled with necessity, is essential to\nmorality.\n\nLike Hume, Kant seeks to reconcile freedom with a commitment to causal\ndeterminism. Yet the two philosophers operate with different\nconceptions of causal necessity and very different conceptions of\nfreedom. For present purposes, it is important to focus on the latter.\nHume concentrates on the liberty of spontaneity, the only idea of\nfreedom \u201cwhich it concerns us to preserve\u201d. His treatment\nlooks downstream from the will to its execution in action. A person\nhas liberty when her action is caused by her will, which Hume equates\nwith an occurrent motive or desire (T 2.3.1.2). The question of what\nultimately moves the will is irrelevant. Such causes are found in the\nperson\u2019s character and circumstances, and they determine her\nwill with the same necessity that determines everything else in\nnature. Kant, by contrast, looks upstream to what determines the will:\n\u201cIt is here a question only of the determination of the will and\nof the determining ground of its maxims as a free will, not of its\nresult\u201d in bodily action (CPrR 5:45). One way of putting it is\nto say that Hume\u2019s account concerns the freedom of action, while\nKant\u2019s concerns freedom of the will. Both are concerned with the\nfreedom of the person or agent, but Kant thinks the person is not\ntruly free unless her will is free. This is the first point about the\nmain difference between Kant and Hume.\n\nThe second point is that Kant, unlike Hume, believes that the will is\nnot free unless it can be determined by pure reason. This is why he\nrepeatedly insists that the main question concerning freedom is\nwhether pure reason \u201ccan be an immediate determining ground of\nthe will, that is, of the causality of a rational being with respect\nto the reality of objects\u201d (CPrR 5:44\u201345). Furthermore,\nKant holds that this is a question of whether the will can be\ndetermined \u201cindependently of anything empirical\u201d (CPrR\n5:42). For when pure reason determines the will, the latter\u2019s\n\u201cground\u201d must be found in \u201cthe intelligible order of\nthings\u201d rather than in empirical order (CPrR 5:49). This is why\nKant thinks that \u201cthe concept of a being that has free\nwill\u201d involves the concept of a \u201cnoumenal\u201d cause\n(CPrR 5:55). Note that Kant\u2019s idea of noumenal causation is not\nequivalent to what Hume calls the liberty of indifference, which\nimplies a complete absence of causes or necessitation. To appreciate\nthe point, contrast Kant\u2019s view with what Bramhall calls\n\u201cliberty from necessitation\u201d or \u201cimmunity from all...\ndetermination.\u201d Unlike Bramhall, Kant seems to think that the will is\nfree if, and only if, it is necessitated. But the will must\nbe necessitated by the right sort of thing and in the right way:\nnamely, by pure reason rather than by an antecedent event whose causal\nimpact on the will could be described by an empirical law. That is,\nthe will is free if and only if can be determined by pure reason,\nwhich lies outside the realm governed by empirical laws.\n\nKant\u2019s conception of freedom has profound implications for the task of\nreconciling freedom with causal determinism. He maintains that all\nevents, including human actions, are causally determined by antecedent\nevents in accordance with empirical laws. But he also seeks to show\nthat this does not rule out free will (A536\u2013537/B564-565). On\nthe contrary, one and the same event can be both \u201ca mere effect\nof nature\u201d but also an \u201ceffect of freedom\u201d\n(A543/B571). Kant demonstrates this possibility by distinguishing\nbetween two different \u201cworlds\u201d and arguing that we belong\nto both. On the one hand, we belong to the \u201cphenomenal\u201d\nworld, where all our actions can be explained in terms of antecedent\nevents (whether physical or psychological). On the other hand,\nconsidered as a \u201cthing in itself\u201d, each of us belongs to\nthe \u201cnoumenal\u201d world, which is not subject to \u201cthe\ntemporal order in accord with empirical laws\u201d (A534/B562). We\ncannot know whether we belong to the noumenal world, but\nKant\u2019s theoretical philosophy secures room for this possibility,\nand his moral philosophy tries to show that when we become aware of\nmorality\u2019s categorical demands, we think of ourselves as members\nof this noumenal or \u201cintelligible world\u201d (G 4:457-58).\n\nWe can see here that Kant seeks to reconcile freedom and natural\nnecessity by means of \u201ctranscendental idealism.\u201d Indeed, the question\nof whether natural necessity rules out freedom is a\n\u201ctranscendental problem,\u201d and only transcendental\nphilosophy can solve it (A535/B563, A557/B585). The appeal to\ntranscendental idealism is controversial, of course. Some scholars of\nKant\u2019s ethics understand him to be making a metaphysical (or\nontological) claim when he distinguishes between noumenal and\nphenomenal worlds (e.g. McCarty 2009). Others understand Kant to be\ndistinguishing between only different standpoints we take, identifying\nthe noumenal world with the practical standpoint that we take when we\nthink of ourselves as autonomous, responsible beings, and the\nphenomenal world with the theoretical standpoint we take when we think\nof ourselves as part of the natural, deterministic, empirical world\n(see Beck 1960: 191\u201394; Korsgaard 1996a, esp. chs. 6\u20137).\nBoth raise concerns. Many find the notion of two worlds metaphysically\ncumbersome (at best); but others question whether the two standpoints\napproach is robust enough for Kant\u2019s purposes. (See Irwin 1984, esp.\n37\u201338; Allison 1990; Guyer 1992: 103\u2013107; and Wood 2005a:\n99\u2013100.)\n\nKant has several reasons for thinking that freedom is essential to\nmorality. First, freedom is necessary for moral responsibility. When\nwe hold a person responsible for blameworthy conduct, for example, we\n\u201cimpute\u201d the ability to have refrained from such conduct\nand blame the person for her failure to exercise this ability\nproperly. The judgment of \u201cblame is grounded on the law of\nreason, which regards reason as a cause that\u2026 could have and\nought to have determined the conduct of the person to be other than it\nis\u201d (A555/B583). Second, Kant holds that \u201cwhat is\nessential to any moral worth of actions is that the moral law\ndetermine the will immediately\u201d (CPrR 5:71). If a\nperson\u2019s will were necessitated by her circumstances and\nempirical character, as Hume maintains, it would be impossible to\nrespond properly to the moral law, which demands a kind of purity of\nthought and motive that Hume would not countenance. Third, freedom is\nessential to morality in that freedom is the ground of a special\nstatus or \u201cdignity\u201d that morality commands us to respect\nin ourselves and others. One important but unorthodox line of\ninterpretation suggests a fourth reason for thinking that freedom is\nessential to morality. According to this view, Kant holds (in at least\nsome places) that freedom is our most fundamental value, the source\nfrom which all other moral value derives. This is \u201cthe real\nbedrock of Kant\u2019s moral thought\u201d (Guyer 2000: 203). On\nthis view, in fact, we are commanded to obey the moral law because it\n\u201cis the necessary means for the realization of human\nfreedom\u201d (Guyer 2016: 38).\n\nWhen comparing Hume and Kant, it is a mistake to ask simply which\nphilosopher has the best account of freedom or does the best job of\nreconciling freedom and necessity. They disagree about both causal\nnecessity and the question of which idea of freedom \u201cit concerns\nus to preserve\u201d. As a result, they focus on somewhat different\ntopics. Hume concentrates on what happens downstream from the will,\nthat is, on how motives determine action. But Kant\u2019s attention\nis focused on what happens upstream\u2014on the question of what\ndetermines the will. It seems fair to say that from Kant\u2019s\nperspective, Hume\u2019s notion of liberty is thin gruel, no better\nthan \u201cthe freedom of a turnspit\u201d (CPrR 5:97) or the\nfreedom exhibited by a self-moving clock (CPrR 5:96). It also seems\nfair to say that from Hume\u2019s perspective, Kant\u2019s notion of\nfree will is, at best, a misguided fiction.\n\nOne important question is whether morality requires the sort of\nfreedom Kant has in mind. Hume would deny that it does, but this is\npartly because his view of morality itself is so different from\nKant\u2019s. The issue here is not just about free will. It is about\nwhich conception of morality is most plausible. If Kant has convincing\ngrounds for insisting on the unique nature of moral obligation or\njudgments of \u201cmoral worth\u201d, this puts some pressure on\nHume to take Kant\u2019s notion of free will more seriously. Another\nimportant question is how to interpret Kant\u2019s actual position,\nwhich is the subject of controversy. Standard textbooks classify Kant\nas a libertarian (incompatibilist) about free will, but those who\nstudy Kant most intensively often disagree about the nature of his\nview. Some argue that Kant offers a form of incompatibilism (e.g.,\nPereboom 2006; Allison 1990; Watkins 2005), while others maintain that\nhe is some sort of compatibilist, however unorthodox (e.g., Bennett\n1984; Hudson 1994). According to one influential interpretation, Kant\nendorses \u201cnot only the compatibility of freedom and determinism,\nbut also the compatibility of compatibilism and incompatibilism\u201d\n(Wood 1984: 74). These scholarly debates bear on the question of how\nKant\u2019s view compares to Hume\u2019s, as does the question of\nwhether the naturalist or traditional interpretation best captures\nHume\u2019s own position. Finally, when comparing Kant and Hume on\nthe question of freedom, one must recognize that there is a modest and\nskeptical side to Kant\u2019s view that Hume would applaud. For Kant,\nfree will is an \u201cinscrutable faculty\u201d (CPrR 5:47), whose\noperations lie beyond the reach of human cognition. It is impossible\nto know whether we actually have free will (CPrR 5:72; G\n4:459). Indeed, Kant\u2019s significant debt to Hume is evident in\nthe former\u2019s claim that \u201call human insight is at an end as soon\nas we have arrived at basic powers or basic faculties\u201d (CPrR\n5:46). Here we find profound agreement between the two philosophers\nabout the limits of human insight.\n6. Religion and Morality\n\nDiscussions of religious themes can be found in most of Hume\u2019s\nand Kant\u2019s major works. Their treatments of the subject differ\nsignificantly, but they have a few important things in common,\nespecially on the question of how religion relates to morality. Above\nall, both philosophers advocate a secularized approach to moral\nphilosophy. That is, both argue for the independence of morality from\nreligion and the importance of keeping the two distinct. They both\nexpress deep concern about the corrupting influence of false religion,\nincluding \u201centhusiasm\u201d and \u201csuperstition\u201d. And\nthey both seek to undermine a good deal of Christian theology,\nincluding traditional arguments for the existence of God. There are\nalso significant disagreements, however. Generally speaking, Hume is\nfar more alert to religion\u2019s potential costs, such as\nintolerance, violence, and distraction from whatever happiness is\navailable in this life. Kant, by contrast, seems far more attuned to\nthe benefits of religion, especially its attempts to address the human\nneed for ultimate answers or consolation in the face of death and\nsuffering.\n\nOn Hume\u2019s view, the foundation of morality has nothing to do\nwith God. This is evident from his distinctive version of\nsentimentalism. He argues that morality, much like our aesthetic\nresponses to beauty, is \u201cfounded entirely on the peculiar fabric\nand constitution of the human species\u201d (EPM 1.3). This claim is\nmade in the context of arguing against a form of moral rationalism\nthat locates the foundation of morality in immutable truths\ndiscoverable by reason (Schneewind 2010). Against rationalists like\nSamuel Clarke, Hume claims that morality is a distinctly and entirely\nhuman phenomenon; there are no grounds for believing that human beings\nexist in any kind of moral community with God or that God is\nanswerable to the moral norms that bind us (Schneewind 2010). For\npresent purposes, there are two additional points to appreciate.\nFirst, Hume\u2019s claim entails a rejection of the idea that moral\ndistinctions between good and evil are instituted by divine command,\nas argued by voluntarists such as Pufendorf, Luther, or Calvin.\nSecond, Hume\u2019s version of the above claim differs from the\nversion found in Hutcheson. On Hutcheson\u2019s view, human nature is\nessentially good and its goodness reflects the wisdom and benevolence\nof God. When we behave virtuously, we further the purposes for which\nwe were created. Hume, by contrast, rejects Hutcheson\u2019s equation\nof the natural with the good (T 3.1.2.10), and he rejects his\npredecessor\u2019s underlying teleology (Gill 2006:\n194\u2013208).\n\nHume frequently draws attention to the moral and political costs of\nreligion. He never argues that religion is inherently destructive, but\nhe consistently claims that it tends to distort and corrupt morality.\nWere it not for religion\u2019s influence, Hume claims, we would\nnever approve of qualities such as \u201ccelibacy, fasting, penance,\nmortification, self-denial, humility, silence, solitude, and the whole\ntrain of monkish virtues\u201d (EPM 9.1.3). The \u201cdelusive\nglosses of superstition and false religion\u201d can cause us to\napprove of such qualities despite the fact that they are neither\nuseful nor agreeable (EPM 9.1.3). Similarly, Hume emphasizes the\ndifference between moral and religious sources of motivation. When a\nperson pays a debt or restores a loan, for example, \u201chis divinity is\nnowise beholden to him; because these acts of justice are what he was\nbound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no\ngod in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give himself a sound\nwhipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the service\nof God. No other motive could engage him to such austerities\u201d (NHR\n14.6). Hume often blames these distortions of morality on particular\nforms of Christianity, such as Catholicism and sectarian offshoots of\nCalvinism and Lutheranism. But in some places Hume comes close to\nfaulting any religion that represents God as\n\u201cinfinitely superior to mankind\u201d (NHR 10.2), arguing that,\n\u201c[t]he more tremendous the divinity is represented, the more\ntame and submissive do men become to his ministers\u201d (NHR 14.8).\nHe clearly believes that monotheistic religions tend to focus human\nattention on the one God rather than on the enjoyment of life on\nearth. Monotheism also tends to promote intolerance, factionalism, and\neven violence.\n\nLike Hume, Kant holds that the foundation of morality is independent\nof religion. The main difference between them is that Hume locates\nthat foundation in human nature, while Kant \u2014depending on the\ninterpretation\u2014locates it in the structure of practical reason,\nthe nature of rational beings, or the supreme value of freedom. On\nKant\u2019s view, morality is not only independent of religion; it is\nalso more fundamental. One way that he gives priority to morality is\nby arguing that belief in God follows from a moral commitment, and by\ndenying that recognition of the moral law follows from or must be\ngrounded in recognition of God\u2019s authority. A second way in\nwhich Kant treats morality as fundamental is by denying that we have\nany duties to God. All that God commands us to do is what morality\nrequires: our duties to ourselves and others. A third point is that\nKant insists that children not be taught about religion until they are\nfamiliar with basic moral concepts and principles; otherwise, they may\nthink, for example, that the reason one should act rightly is to hope\nfor God\u2019s favor and to avoid God\u2019s punishment. He argues\nthat Christianity is superior to other ecclesiastical faiths because\nof the centrality of ethics within it from its inception (Rel 6:167).\nBut all ecclesiastical faiths are liable to corruption, and none is\nthe ideal form for religion to take. Ideally, we will dispense with\ndistinct ecclesiastical faiths, along with their revealed texts and\ndoctrinal statutes and observances, in favor of a universal, pure\nreligion of reason, dedicated to morality.\n\nWhile Kant holds that morality\u2019s foundation is independent of\nreligion, the two are more closely connected for him than they are for\nHume. Compared with Hume, Kant is far less antagonistic to religion,\nand he consistently tries to preserve a place for religious belief\nwithin the strictures of his moral philosophy. Indeed, this is an\nimportant aspect of his approach to morality. Kant\u2019s\n\u201cmoral theism\u201d is one of his most significant\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion and the question of\nreligion\u2019s relation to morality. Moral theism is belief in God\nfounded on morality. By belief (or faith) [Glaube], Kant\nmeans something different from knowledge [Wissen] (A 822/B\n850; WOT 8:140\u201341). Believing and knowing both involve holding\nsomething to be true. When one knows something, one holds it to be\ntrue on grounds that are \u201csubjectively and objectively\u201d\nsufficient, whereas when one believes something, one holds it to be\ntrue on grounds that are subjectively but not objectively sufficient\n(A 822/B 850). Here, Kant takes objective sufficiency to imply valid\ntheoretical grounds, such as evidence or theoretical argument; he\ntakes subjective sufficiency, by contrast, to imply valid practical\ngrounds. Thus, belief entails having valid practical reasons for\nholding something to be true, while lacking valid theoretical reasons\nfor doing so. Indeed, when it comes to belief in God, Kant does not\nthink that knowledge is possible (CPJ 5:471\u201372).\n\nKant\u2019s position contains a distinctly moral conception of God.\nIn addition to the attributes of omniscience, omnipresence, and\nomnipotence, he ascribes to God the moral attributes of holiness,\nbenevolence, and justice (LPDR 28:1073\u201374). God is not only\nauthor and executor of the moral law, but also as its\n\u201cpersonification\u201d (C 27:322; V 27:530, 723; LPDR 28:1076,\n1091). Kant also says that all moral requirements can be seen\nas divine commands (CPrR 5:129; Rel 6:153). God knows and cares\nabout our virtue and well-being. In particular, he cares about the\nrealization of the highest good, in which people attain maximal virtue\nand, consequently, maximal happiness. This is a God who has created\nthe world, has incorporated morality into the world, and has a moral\nplan for the world (CPrR 5:125; CPJ 5:450). Belief in God allows us to\nretain our faith that some of our moral actions will produce the\nintended good consequences, and that if we strive our best to promote\nthe highest good, God will complete the task (C 27:310, 321\u201322;\nCPJ 5:450\u201353; Rel 6:74\u201377, 192, 201\u2013202).\n\nThe relation between God and the highest good is the basis of\nKant\u2019s main argument for belief in God. (See Wood 1970.) The\nargument, most clearly articulated in the Critique of Practical\nReason, goes like this (CPrR 5:110\u201314, 124\u201346). The\nmoral law issues categorical demands through each agent\u2019s own\nreason. If the moral law sets forth an end for us to promote, we must\npromote it. For our promotion of this end to be rational, the end must\nbe one that we can rationally view as possible for us to promote\nthrough our own agency. The moral law gives rise to the highest good\n(i.e., virtue and conditioned, proportionate happiness), as practical\nreason\u2019s ultimate end. Thus, we must promote it. Yet it is not\nclear that we are capable of effecting the highest good, given the\nlimitations of our agency and the conditions and workings of the\nnatural world. If the realization of the highest good is not possible,\nhowever, then we cannot rationally promote it as an end; indeed, we\ncannot even make sense of it as an end. But if we do not promote the\nhighest good, we flout the moral law. Now, suppose that there were a\nsupreme, eternal, all powerful, all knowing ruler of the universe\n(i.e., God); he could bring to completion our imperfect strivings for\nthe highest good. Thus, if we postulate the existence of God, we can\nview the highest good as possible, and can rationally follow\nmorality\u2019s command to promote it. There is no reason not to\npostulate God\u2019s existence, since his non-existence cannot be\nproven, and since belief in him does not conflict with any necessary\nbeliefs (CPrR 5:135\u201343). In addition, since belief in God is\nnecessary for seeing the highest good as possible, we must believe in\nGod (CPrR 5:125\u201326, 142\u201346). Thus, belief in God is\ngrounded in the necessity of seeing the highest good as possible, and\nso for the rational compliance with morality. Thus, Kant says that\nbelief in God is morally necessary, and that morality leads\nineluctably to religion (CPrR 5:125). We do not, however, have a duty\nto believe in God. Postulating God\u2019s existence is a theoretical\nexercise of reason, which cannot be morally commanded (CPrR 5:125,\n144). Rather, our duty to promote the highest good gives rise to\n\u201ca need of reason\u201d to assume the possibility of the\nhighest good. From this need emerges the necessity of postulating\nGod\u2019s existence.\n\nKant\u2019s practical argument differs profoundly from his\ncontemporaries\u2019 speculative or theoretical arguments for God\u2019s\nexistence. His approach grounds the necessity of believing in God in\neach person\u2019s practical reason, required to \u201corient\nourselves in thinking\u201d (WOT 8:136\u201337). According to Kant,\nbelief in God is \u201ca postulate\u201d of practical reason, that is,\n\u201ca theoretical proposition which is not as such demonstrable,\nbut which is an inseparable corollary of an a priori unconditionally\nvalid practical law\u201d (CPrR 5:122). Although practical arguments\ncannot provide knowledge of God\u2019s existence, they can provide\n\u201cmoral certainty\u201d of God\u2019s existence (A\n828\u201330/B 856\u201358; CPrR 5:134, 143; LPDR 28:1011\u201312).\nMoral certainty in God\u2019s existence is stronger than the sort of\nconfidence one could obtain from any theoretical argument.\n\nHume\u2019s influence on Kant regarding the intersection of religion\nand morality is evident, though difficult to measure. It is also hard\nto tell how much of the influence came directly from Hume\u2019s\nwritings. Hume is not often cited regarding religion in Kant\u2019s\nmajor works. Kant\u2019s Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine\nof Religion, however, suggest familiarity with Hume\u2019s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion, a work which Kant\ncould have read in its entirety in 1781 (Wood 1978: 14\u201315), and\nperhaps in part when it first came out, since Hamann translated the\nfirst and last parts of it for him (Kuehn 2001: 121). Kant explicitly\ndiscusses Hume\u2019s Dialogues in the section on the\nphysiotheological proof, which is what Kant calls the argument from\ndesign (see LPDR 28:1063\u20134). Furthermore, in the Danzig\nmanuscript of these lectures, Kant cites Hume within his argument\nagainst the cosmotheological proof (Ak 28:1266; Wood 1978: 83n31).\nKant was clearly also familiar with Hume\u2019s The Natural\nHistory of Religion. In \u201cA History of Natural Theology,\naccording to Meiners\u2019 Historia doctrinae de uno vero\nDeo\u201d, Kant refers briefly to Hume\u2019s account of\npolytheists as tolerant in section 9 of The Natural History of\nReligion (LPDR 28:1125).\n\nFinally, it is interesting to note that many philosophers and other\nintellectuals in K\u00f6nigsberg in the late 1750s and early 1760s\nseem to have attributed to Hume a view of religion that has\nsignificant parallels with Kant\u2019s mature view. Hamann and others\nsaw Hume\u2019s skepticism as necessary for purging religion of its\ntraditional arguments and clearing the way for true religion. One\nsource for this view of Hume is the conclusion of book I of the\nTreatise, which Hamann translated into German (with some\nalterations and excisions to hide its origin) and published\nanonymously in 1771 under the title \u201cNight Thoughts of a\nSceptic\u201d (Kuehn 2001: 198\u2013201). Another source is the end\nof the Dialogues, where Philo says, \u201cTo be a\nphilosophical skeptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most\nessential step towards being a sound, believing Christian\u201d (DR\n89). This statement is out of line with Philo\u2019s previous\nassertions and arguments, and it comes as a surprise at this point in\nthe text. But, some, including Hamman, take Philo\u2019s remark as an\nexpression of Hume\u2019s fideism. Whether the interpretation of Hume is\ncorrect, Philo\u2019s remark finds deep resonance in Kant. He is no\nfideist, but Kant does hold that purging the traditional \u201cproofs\u201d from\nphilosophical theology helps us recognize that morality itself offers\na better argument for God\u2019s existence \u2013\u2013 one which\nprovides the moral certainty sought by finite rational beings such as\nourselves.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": "</h3>\n<h4 id=\"HumeDavi\">Hume, David</h4>\n<p>\nHume\u2019s main works of moral philosophy are the following.</p>\n<dl class=\"sentag tag4em\">\n<dt>[EPM]</dt>\n<dd> <em>An Enquiry\nconcerning the Principles of Morals</em>, Tom L.
