    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || Identifiability of Causal Structure\n4.4 Identifiability of Causal Structure\n\nIf we have a set of variables \\(\\bV\\) and know the probability\ndistribution P on \\(\\bV\\), what can we infer about the causal\nstructure on \\(\\bV\\)? This epistemological question is closely related\nto the metaphysical question of whether it is possible to\nreduce causation to probability (as, e.g., Reichenbach 1956\nand Suppes 1970 proposed).\n\nPearl (1988: Chapter 3) proves the following theorem:\n\n\n(Identifiability with time-order)\nIf\n\nthe variables in \\(\\bV\\) are time-indexed, such that only earlier\nvariables can cause later ones;\nthe probability P assigns positive probability to every possible\nassignment of values of the variables in \\(\\bV\\);\nthere are no latent variables, so that the correct causal graph\n\\(\\bG\\) is a DAG;\nand the probability measure P satisfies the Markov and Minimality\nConditions with respect to \\(\\bG\\);\n\n\nthen it will be possible to uniquely identify \\(\\bG\\) on the basis of\nP.\n\n\nIt is relatively easy to see why this holds. For each variable\n\\(X_i\\), its parents must come from among the variables with lower\ntime indices, call them \\(X_1 ,\\ldots ,X_{i-1}\\). Any variables in\nthis group that are not parents of \\(X_i\\) will be nondescendants of\n\\(X_i\\); hence they will be screened off from \\(X_i\\) by its parents\n(from MCScreening_off). Thus we can start with the\ndistributions \\(\\Pr(X_i\\mid X_1 ,\\ldots ,X_{i-1})\\), and then weed out\nany variables from the right hand side that make no difference to the\nprobability distribution over \\(X_i\\). By the Minimality Condition, we\nknow that the variables so weeded are not parents of \\(X_i\\). Those\nvariables that remain are the parents of \\(X_i\\) in \\(\\bG\\).\n\nIf we don\u2019t have information about time ordering, or other\nsubstantive assumptions restricting the possible causal structures\namong the variables in \\(\\bV\\), then it will not always be possible to\nidentify the causal structure from probability alone. In general,\ngiven a probability distribution P on \\(\\bV\\), it is only possible to\nidentify a Markov equivalence class of causal structures.\nThis will be the set of all DAGs on \\(\\bV\\) that (together with MC)\nimply all and only the conditional independence relations contained in\nP. In other words, it will be the set of all DAGs \\(\\bG\\) such that P\nsatisfies MC and FC with respect to \\(\\bG\\). The PC algorithm\ndescribed by SGS (2000: 84\u201385) is one algorithm that generates\nthe Markov equivalence class for any probability distribution with a\nnon-empty Markov equivalence class.\n\nConsider two simple examples involving three variables \\(\\{X, Y,\nZ\\}\\). Suppose our probability distribution has the following\nproperties:\n\nX and Y are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on Z\nY and Z are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on X\nX and Z are dependent unconditionally, but\nindependent conditional on Y\n\n\nThen the Markov equivalence class is: \n\n\\[\nX \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\\\\nX \\leftarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\\\\\nX \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\n\\]\n\n\nWe cannot determine from the probability distribution, together with\nMC and FC, which of these structures is correct.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the probability distribution is as\nfollows:\n\nX and Y are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on Z\nY and Z are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on X\nX and Z are independent unconditionally, but\ndependent conditional on Y\n\n\nThen the Markov equivalence class is: \n\n\\[\nX \\rightarrow  Y \\leftarrow  Z\n\\]\n\n\nThis is the only DAG relative to which the given probability\ndistribution satisfies MC and FC.\n",
