    "main_text": "\n\nWe think of a boundary whenever we think of an entity demarcated from\nits surroundings. There is a boundary (a line) separating Maryland and\nPennsylvania. There is a boundary (a circle) isolating the interior of\na disc from its exterior. There is a boundary (a surface) enclosing\nthe bulk of this apple. Sometimes the exact location of a boundary is\nunclear or otherwise controversial (as when you try to trace out the\nborders of a desert, the edges of a mountain, or even the boundary of\nyour own body). Sometimes the boundary lies skew to any physical\ndiscontinuity or qualitative differentiation (as with the border of\nWyoming, or the boundary between the upper and the lower halves of a\nhomogeneous sphere). But whether sharp or blurry, natural or\nartificial, for every object there appears to be a boundary that marks\nit off from the rest of the world. Events, too, have boundaries\n\u2014 at least temporal boundaries. Our lives are bounded by our\nbirths and by our deaths; the soccer game began at 3pm sharp and ended\nwith the referee\u2019s final whistle at 4:45pm. It is sometimes\nsuggested that even abstract entities, such as concepts or sets, have\nboundaries of their own (witness the popular method for representing\nthe latter by means of simple closed curves encompassing their\ncontents, as in Euler circles and Venn diagrams), and Wittgenstein\ncould emphatically proclaim that the boundaries of our language are\nthe boundaries of our world (1921: prop. 5.6). Whether all this\nboundary talk is coherent, however, and whether it reflects the\nstructure of the world or simply the organizing activity of our mind,\nor of our collective practices and conventions, are matters of deep\nphilosophical controversy.\n",
