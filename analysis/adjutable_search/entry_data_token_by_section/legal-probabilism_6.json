    "main_text": "The Strength of Evidence\n2. The Strength of Evidence\n\nThe posterior probability of a hypothesis given the evidence should\nnot be confused with the strength (or probative value, weight) of the\nevidence in favor of the hypothesis. The strength of an item of\nevidence reflects its impact on the probability of the hypothesis.\nSuppose the prior probability of \\(H\\) is extremely low, say\n\\(\\Pr(H)=.001\\), but taking evidence \\(E\\) into account brings this\nprobability up to 35%, that is, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)=.35\\). This is a\ndramatic upward shift. Even though the posterior probability of \\(H\\)\ngiven \\(E\\) is not high, \\(E\\) strongly favors \\(H\\). This section\nexamines how probability theory helps to assess the strength of\nevidence.\n",
