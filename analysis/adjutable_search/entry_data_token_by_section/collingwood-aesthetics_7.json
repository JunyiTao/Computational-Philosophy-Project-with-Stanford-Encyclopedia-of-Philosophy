    "main_text": "Language\n5. Language\n\nThat Collingwood has a theory of language might seem tangential to his\ntheory of art, but in fact it is integral to it. For\nCollingwood\u2019s approach to it comes not from the theory of\nreference and truth as in Frege or Russell, but from the point of view\nwhich regards language as fundamentally or in the first instance\nexpressive behaviour. Concepts of referential semantics\u2014as a\n\u2018symbolism\u2019 in Collingwood\u2019s\nterminology\u2014become applicable only later, with a certain degree\nof sophistication is attained. \u2018In its original or native state,\nlanguage in imaginative or expressive \u2026 It is imaginative\nactivity whose function is to express emotion.\u2019 (225). Of course\n\u2018imaginative\u2019 must be understood in the broader sense just\ndescribed, denoting all consciousness of ideated analogues of\nsensation or feeling. From this angle, we can speak of the\n\u2018totality of our motor activities\u2019 as a \u2018parent\norganism\u2019 (247), from which every type of \u2018language\n(speech, gesture, and so forth)\u2019 is an \u2018offshoot\u2019\n(246).\n\nAt the most fundamental level, at the \u2018psychic\u2019 level as\nCollingwood calls it, various sorts of bodily activity are said to\npsychically express an underlying emotional charge on a sensum;\ncringing or flinching express fear, for example. At this stage\nconsciousness of the imagination is not involved\u2014only sensa;\nthis level is shared with animals, and is \u2018completely\nuncontrollable\u2019 (234). With the consciousness of ideas comes\n\u2018emotions of consciousness\u2019, which require language for\ntheir expression. A cry from a child, for example, may be either\npsychic or imaginative, depending whether it is involuntary or\nvoluntary. If it is voluntary, it is the work of the conscious\nimagination, and thus in the most rudimentary sense linguistic.\n\nIt is essential to Collingwood\u2019s view that there are not,\nparadoxical as it sounds, any unexpressed emotions. A psychical\nemotion, on one hand, simply has its being in its expression; an\nemotion of fear must show up somewhere, whether by cringing, shying or\nflinching, an increase in pulse or blood pressure, a tightness of the\nchest, or something else bodily or physiological. On the other hand,\nif someone tries but fails to express an emotion, the emotion at most\nremains \u2018shut up\u2019 in the psychic level; in order to be\nconscious of the emotion, \u2018the same consciousness which\ngenerates these emotions converts them from impressions into ideas\ngenerates also and simultaneously their appropriate linguistic\nexpression.\u2019(238). There is no other way to be conscious of an\nemotion; to express an emotion is to be conscious of it.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s remarks about the relation between speaker and\nhearer are of special interest not just to aestheticians but to\nphilosophers of mind interested in knowledge of other minds. A\nvoluntary cry is underpinned by a self-conscious imaginative act; and\nhowever rudimentary it is, self-consciousness is at once the\nconsciousness of others. \u2018[A]s persons\u2019, writes\nCollingwood, \u2018they construct a new set of relations between\nthemselves, arising out their consciousness of themselves and one\nanother; these are linguistic relations.\u2019 (248).\n\nThe relation of the listener and speaker to an expressive act is\ntotally symmetric:\n\nThe hearer, therefore, conscious that he is being addressed by another\nperson like himself \u2026 takes what he hears exactly as if it were\nspeech of his own: he speaks to himself with the words that he hears\naddressed to him, and thus constructs in himself the idea which those\nwords express. At the same time, being conscious of the speaker as a\nperson other than himself, he attributes that idea to this other\nperson. Understanding what some one says to you is thus attributing to\nhim the idea which his words arouse in yourself; and this implies\ntreating them as words of your own. (250).\n\n\nRemember, again, that we are talking of the expressive\ndimension of language, not the referential dimension (about which more\nin a moment). To understand another person\u2019s emotions is\nprecisely to adopt the person\u2019s expressive language as\none\u2019s own, imaginatively experiencing the ideas as if they were\none\u2019s own (that is, as if they expressed one\u2019s own\nemotion; of course the ideas, as analogues of sensation, are\nnecessarily one\u2019s own). This aspect of Collingwood, of the\nnecessary publicity of language and meaning, can be stressed as a\npotential way out of the threat of the seeming privacy of the work of\nart as mentioned above, in connection with p. 134 of the\nPrinciples.\n\nThere is however one evident mistake in Collingwood\u2019s\npresentation. Sensa are, as we\u2019ve seen, fleeting. But no idea\n\u2018can be formed as such in consciousness except by a mind whose\nsense-emotional experience contains the corresponding impression\n\u2026 at that very moment.\u2019 (251). This cannot be right. To\nunderstand Othello, we don\u2019t have to actually have an impression\nof jealousy; we only need to have the idea. In fact, by what we said\nin section IV, there are no impressions (sensa) of jealousy at all;\njealousy is an emotion of consciousness. The solution, which as far as\nI can see is consistent with everything else Collingwood says, is\nsimply to erase the requirement that the listener must undergo\nanything at the psychical level, the level of sensa, coevally\nwith expression (we leave open the question of whether it must have\nhappened to one in the past).\n\nEarlier, we said that thought involving relations is the domain of\nthought in its \u2018secondary\u2019 role, the realm of intellect.\nThoughts delivered by the imagination are \u2018seamless\u2019:\n\nThus what I imagine, however complex it may be, is imagined as a\nsingle whole, where relation between the part are present simply as\nqualities of the whole.\n\n\n\u2018Analytical thought\u2019\u2014intellect, thought in its\nsecondary role\u2014may begin with the same experience, but instead\nof being \u2018an indivisible unity it becomes a manifold, a network\nof things with relations between them\u2019 (253). Collingwood also\ncharacterises the intellect as the domain of concepts, and of\ngeneralisation (273, 281).\n\nNow one might be tempted to suppose that thoughts as grasped by the\nintellect are roughly the same as propositions, in the sense intended\nby analytical philosophers. But Collingwood holds that the proposition\nis \u2018a fictitious entity\u2019 (266), and devotes a long passage\nto excoriating that tendency in philosophy. Every actual episode of\nthought is performed with its own particular degree and character of\nemotion; there is no such thing as the thought shorn of its emotional\nhusk. All mental activity has some emotional character, including\nintellectual activity. The cry of \u2018Eureka\u2019 said to have\naccompanied Archimedes\u2019 discovery of a principle of hydrostatics\nis but an extreme example. Thus language is expressive of\nemotion even in its scientific use. This applies even to mathematical\nsymbols and technical symbols. Insofar as they are used, they\nautomatically acquire the expressive character of the underlying\nthoughts. Thus Collingwood says: \u2018Symbolism is thus intellectual\nlanguage; language, because it expresses emotions; intellectualized,\nbecause adapted to the expression of intellectual emotions\u2019\n(269). In \u2018poeticizing\u2019 such language, Collingwood does\nnot intend to demean it; presumably the aim is to do justice to the\nrarefied air of pure intellect:\n\nThe progressive intellectualization of language, its progressive\nconversion by the word of grammar and logic into a scientific\nsymbolism, thus represents not a progressive drying-up of emotions,\nbut its progressive articulation and specialization. We are not\ngetting away from an emotional atmosphere into a dry, rational\natmosphere; we are acquiring new emotions and new means of expressing\nthem. (269)\n\n\nNevertheless, Collingwood\u2019s account of language, needless to\nsay, is radical; he is quite serious in his denial of the possibility\nof what earlier I called a theory of the purely referential dimension\nof language, which generalizes about truth-conditions of sentences in\nabstraction from their use:\n\n\u2026 we are concerned with a modification of language, not a\ntheory of it. Its assumptions are neither certainly nor probably, nor\never possibly, true. They are, in fact, not assumptions, but\nproposals; and what they propose is the conversion of language into\nsomething which, if it could be realized, would not be language at\nall. (262)\n\n",
