Over the course of\nthe last three centuries BCE, Chinese understandings of the physical\nworld developed to reflect, and mirror, political consolidation (Sivin\n1995, 2007). These new ideas of cosmic order\u2014correspondence\nbetween microcosm (the body) and macrocosm (the cosmos)\u2014appeared\nin new representations of the body, the state, and the cosmos that were\nbased on systematic applications and correlations of the ideas of\nyin-yang and wuxing. They are prominent in Warring\nStates politico-philosophical writings such as the Springs and\nAutumns of Master L\u00fc (L\u00fc Shi chunqiu) of\nL\u00fc Buwei (291?-235 BCE) and the Luxuriant Dew of the Springs\nand Autumns (Chunqiu fanl\u00fc), attributed to Dong\nZhongshu (179\u2013104 BCE).\n\n\nTheories of qi, yin-yang and wuxing also\ninform medical works. New systematic medical theories based on\nthese ideas were systematized in a cosmological framework in the\nHuang Di neijing, a complex and multi-layered text, probably\ncompiled in the first century BCE (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003, Yamada\n1979). It presents a systematic cosmology that analogizes the\nbody, the state, and the cosmos in systems of \u201ccorrelative\ncosmology\u201d (Graham 1986b, Sivin 1995, Lloyd and Sivin 2002). It\ndescribes relations and analogies between the body (including the\nemotions), the state and the cosmos in terms of yin-yang and\nwuxing. For example, the Huang Di neijing describes\ncorrespondence between the articulations of the body and the cosmos,\nspecifically between heaven and earth and the upper and lower parts of\nthe body:\n\nHeaven is round, earth is square; people\u2019s heads are round,\ntheir feet are square and thereby correspond to them. Heaven has the\nsun and moon, people have two eyes; Earth has nine regions, people have\nnine orifices. Heaven has wind and rain, people have joy and anger;\nHeaven has thunder and lightning, people have the notes and sounds.\nHeaven has four seasons, people have four limbs. Heaven has five tones,\npeople have the five depots; Heaven has six pitches, people have six\npalaces. Heaven has winter and summer, people have cold and hot\n[ailments]. Heaven has ten days, people have the hands\u2019 ten\nfingers \u2026 Heaven has yin and yang; people have man and wife. The\nyear has 365 days; the body has 360 joints (Huang Di neijing ling\nshu 71.2, 446, cf. Wong Ming 1987, 336\u2013338 (French). There\nis no good English translation of this text.).\n\n\nTheories of yin-yang, qi and wuxing also inform\nWarring States and Han astrocalendrics, observational astronomy and the\nstudy of astronomical portents, and in the so-called \u201ccorrelative\ncosmologies\u201d of many Han dynasty texts.\n",
