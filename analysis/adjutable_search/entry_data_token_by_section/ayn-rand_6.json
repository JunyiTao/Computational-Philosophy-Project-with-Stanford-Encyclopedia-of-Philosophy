    "main_text": "Ethics || Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n2.4 Happiness as the Ultimate Value\n\nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically \u201csuccessful\nstate of life\u201d (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a\npositive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an\nemotion that meets certain normative standards: \u201ca state of\nnon-contradictory joy\u2014a joy without penalty or guilt\u201d,\nachievable only by \n\n\nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but\nrational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.\n(1961b: 32) \n\n\nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation: \n\n\nthe feeling of one\u2019s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the\nfeeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this\nkind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105\u20136) \n\n\nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an\nobjectively worthwhile state of life.\n\nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the\nactivity of maintaining one\u2019s life through the rational pursuit\nof rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential\nto happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness.\nJust as even great misfortunes don\u2019t throw Aristotle\u2019s\nvirtuous individual into misery, they don\u2019t throw Rand\u2019s\nheroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous\nindividual\u2019s pain \u201conly goes down to a certain\npoint\u201d (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the\nconviction that she is worthy and\ncapable of\n happiness.[5]\n\nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand\u2019s\nnovels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated\nintellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in\ncertain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition\nof certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their\nsouls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus\non or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive,\nemotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world.\nTheir actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right\nbut a wholehearted \u201clove of rectitude\u201d (1957 [1992]:\n512).\n\nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a\nbasically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the\nreason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false\nmind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently\nirrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments: \n\n\nestimates of that which furthers man\u2019s values or threatens them\n\u2026 lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or\nloss. (1961b: 27) \n\n\nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit\nreasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as\nour reason, because they are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by our reason.\nHence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a\nconflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the\n former.[6]\n\nEudaimonists argue that Rand\u2019s vision of a virtuous and\nhappy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of\neudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements\ninconsistent with this vision. The chief objection\nto eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in\nterms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of\nhappiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense\n(usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such\nobjections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014).\n",
