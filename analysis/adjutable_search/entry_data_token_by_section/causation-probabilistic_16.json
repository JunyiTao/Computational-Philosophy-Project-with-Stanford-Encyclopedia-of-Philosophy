    "main_text": "Causal Modeling || Graphical Causal Models\n3.1 Graphical Causal Models\n\nEvery causal model involves a set of variables \\(\\bV\\). The variables\nin \\(\\bV\\) may include, for example, the education-level, income, and\noccupation of an individual. A variable could be binary, its values\nrepresenting the occurrence or non-occurrence of some event, or the\ninstantiation or non-instantiation of some property. But as the\nexample of income suggests, a variable could have multiple values or\neven be continuous.\n\nA probabilistic causal model also includes a probability measure P. P\nis defined over propositions of the form \\(X = x\\), where X is\na variable in \\(\\bV\\) and x is a value in the range of\nX. P is also defined over conjunctions, disjunctions, and\nnegations of such propositions. It follows that conditional\nprobabilities over such propositions will be well-defined whenever the\nevent conditioned on has positive probability. P is usually understood\nto represent some kind of objective probability.\n\nCausal relationships among the variables in \\(\\bV\\) are represented by\ngraphs. We will consider two types of graphs. The first is\nthe directed acyclic graph (DAG). A directed graph\n\\(\\bG\\) on variable set \\(\\bV\\) is a set of ordered pairs of variables\nin \\(\\bV\\). We represent this visually by drawing an arrow from\nX to Y just in case \\(\\langle X, Y\\rangle\\) is in\n\\(\\bG\\). Figure 3 shows a directed graph on variable set \\(\\bV = \\{S,\nT, W, X, Y, Z\\}\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nA path in a directed graph is a non-repeating sequence of\narrows that have endpoints in common. For example, there is a path\nfrom X to Z, which we can write as \\(X \\leftarrow T\n\\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\). A directed path is a path in\nwhich all the arrows align by meeting tip-to-tail; for example, there\nis a directed path \\(S \\rightarrow T \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\). A\ndirected graph is acyclic, and hence a DAG, if there is no\ndirected path from a variable to itself. The graph in\n Figure 3\n is a DAG.\n\nThe relationships in the graph are often described using the language\nof genealogy. The variable X is a parent of Y\njust in case there is an arrow directed from X to Y.\n\\(\\PA(Y)\\) will denote the set of all parents of Y. In\n Figure 3,\n \\(\\PA(Y) = \\{T, W\\}\\). X is an ancestor of Y\n(and Y is a descendant of X) just in case there\nis a directed path from X to Y. However, it will be\nconvenient to deviate slightly from the genealogical analogy and\ndefine \u2018descendant\u2019 so that every variable is also\na descendant of itself. \\(\\DE(X)\\) denotes the set of all descendants of\nX. In\n Figure 3\n \\(\\DE(T) = \\{T, X, Y, Z\\}\\).\n\nAn arrow from Y to Z in a DAG represents that Y\nis a direct cause of Z. Roughly, this means that the\nvalue of Y makes some causal difference for the value of\nZ, and that Y influences Z through some process\nthat is not mediated by any other variable in \\(\\bV\\). Directness is\nrelative to a variable set. We will call the system of direct causal\nrelations represented in a DAG such as\n Figure 3\n the causal structure on the variable set \\(\\bV\\).\n\nA second type of graph that we will consider is an acyclic\ndirected mixed graph (ADMG). An\nADMG, will contain double-headed arrows, as well as single-headed\narrows. A double-headed arrow represents a latent common\ncause. A latent common cause of variables X and Y is a\ncommon cause that is not included in the variable set \\(\\bV\\). For\nexample, suppose that X and Y share a common cause\nL (Figure 4(a)). An ADMG on the variable set \\(\\bV = \\{X, Y\\}\\)\nwill look like Figure 4(b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\n(b)\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nWe only need to represent missing common causes in this way when they\nare closest common causes. That is, a graph on \\(\\bV\\) should\ncontain a double-headed arrow between X and Y when there\nis a variable L that is omitted from \\(\\bV\\), such that if\nL were added to \\(\\bV\\) it would be a direct cause of\nX and Y. Double-headed arrows do not give rise to\n\u201cgenealogical\u201d relationships: in\n Figure 4(b),\n X is not a parent, ancestor, or descendant of Y.\n\nIn an ADMG, we expand the definition of a path to include\ndouble-headed arrows. Thus, \\(X \\leftrightarrow Y\\) is a path in the\nADMG shown in\n Figure 4(b).\n Directed path retains the same meaning, and a directed path\ncannot contain double-headed arrows. An ADMG cannot include a directed\npath from a variable to itself.\n\nWe will adopt the convention that both DAGs and ADMGs represent the\npresence and absence of both direct causal relationships and\nlatent common causes. For example the DAG in\n Figure 3\n represents that T is a direct cause of Y, that T\nis not a direct cause of Z, and that there are no latent common\ncauses of any variables.\n",
