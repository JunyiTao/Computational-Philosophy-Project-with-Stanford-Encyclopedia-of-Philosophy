    "main_text": "Does Justice Require Universal Access to Health Care? || Access to a Decent Minimum of Health Care\n3.3 Access to a Decent Minimum of Health Care\n\nA different kind of argument in favor of universal access to a decent\nminimum of health care does not turn on support of general principles\nof justice (fair equality of opportunity, treating peoples as equals,\nor a right to a decent minimum of economic welfare), but rather on a\npluralism of moral considerations plus an argument for state\ncoordinated (coerced) beneficence (Buchanan 1984). In his discussion,\nBuchanan first dismisses various accounts that try to ground a\nuniversal right to a decent minimum of care, but here we shall\nconcentrate on the positive argument supporting the idea of universal\naccess through a legal entitlement to such care despite the absence of\nany moral right to it.\n\nThe argument can be sketched as follows:\n\nThere are a set of special rights to a decent minimum of care that\nare held by these groups: members of groups, such as African Americans\nand Native Americans, that are owed compensation for long-standing\ninjustice done to them; individuals harmed in their health by private\nor corporate actions, such as polluting public spaces or exposing\nworkers to toxins; members of groups that have made exceptional\nsacrifices for the good of society as a whole, such as wounded\nveterans.\nAccess to some forms of preventive services derive from a Harm\nPrevention Principle that justifies the use of public funds for\ncertain public health measures plus a constitutional argument that\nrequires equal protection from harms that the public acts to\nprevent.\nAccess to some forms of beneficial services is justified by such\nprudential considerations as the importance of some forms of health\ncare to producing a productive work force and a citizenry fit for\nnational defense.\nTogether these considerations would justify a legal entitlement to\nsome forms of health care.\nIn addition, there are two arguments for state enforced\nbeneficence that can be used to support a legal entitlement to a\ndecent minimum of care: Assuming there is a duty of charity to assist\nthose in need of health care, then\n\n\nEnforcing contributions can lead to producing the public good of a\ndecent minimum of health care for all whereas not enforcing\ncontributions would lead many to choose alternative ways of maximizing\nthe good they can produce through individual actions, undermining the\nproduction of the public good;\nEnforcing contributions produces an assurance that others will\ncontribute to the decent basic minimum and that ones own contribution\nto it therefore is worth making since others will do the same.\n \n\n\nSome points of clarification are in order. First, it remains unclear\njust how the special rights argued for combine to produce a decent\nminimum for all. Only some people hold them, and it is not fully clear\nwhat these rights entitle their bearers to. Second, it is unclear that\nwhen we add the entitlements of these special rights bearers to the\ncontent of what follows from the Harm Prevention Principle or the\nprudential considerations, we end up with what people would call a\ndecent minimum of care. How the broader entitlements of the special\nrights bearers (if they are broad) get combined with the care that\nought to universally be provided according the Harm Prevention\nPrinciple and the prudential considerations? No clear account is\noffered. Put another way, these pluralist considerations might suffice\nto establish some legal entitlements by some people to some forms of\ncare, but it is not obvious that what emerges is a universal legal\nentitlement to a decent minimum of care.\n\nThird, the arguments for enforcing beneficence seems to imply that\nthere is a collective duty to engage in beneficent actions, whereas\nthe duty the argument explicitly mentions is an individual duty of\nbeneficence. The fact that individuals might fail to produce certain\npublic goods through individual (unenforced) beneficence is a\nlimitation that enforced coordination overcomes, but it is not a\nfailure that results from their not discharging their duty. To treat\nit as if it is seems to presuppose a collective responsibility to do\nas much good as possible.\n",
