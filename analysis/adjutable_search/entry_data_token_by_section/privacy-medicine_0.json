    "main_text": "Informational Privacy\n1. Informational Privacy\n\nThis section will highlight philosophical issues relating to\ninformational privacy and medicine. In medical contexts, the\n\u201cprivacy\u201d at issue is very often\n\u201cconfidentiality\u201d (DeCew 2000). Health care professionals\nacknowledge ethical duties to keep medical information private (APA\n2017; AAMFT 2015). Physicians, nurses, hospitals, pharmacists, and\ninsurers are required by law and professional codes to practice\nconfidentiality. Since the 1990s, in policy discussions of health\npolicy and reform, concerns about confidentiality have often been\nprominent (Sharpe 2005; Schwartz 1995). Confidentiality practices\nremain salient in medical settings, even as members of the general\npublic display more relaxed attitudes about voluntarily sharing health\nand medical information. \n\nA few preliminary points about informational privacy and medicine bear\nemphasis at the start\u2014one about public attitudes, a second about\nprofessional responsibility, a third about law and policy, and a\nfourth about the significance of disparities and big data analytics to\nmeaningful medical privacy.\n\nFirst, while information-sharing has grown more common in recent\ndecades\u2014due, inter alia, to social media, big data,\nprecision medicine, and increased infectious disease, new drug\nmarketing and other health surveillance\u2014individuals commonly\nkeep some health concerns to themselves, whether out of personal\npreference, ethical reserve, etiquette, fear or shame (Allen 2016;\nRosenberg 2000; Buss 1980; Westin 1967). When they share what they\nconsider sensitive health concerns with others, most individuals\nemploy culturally appropriate discretion and reserve (Nissenbaum 2009;\nGoffman 1959, 1963). Because of such privacy practices, families,\nfriends, employers, employees, co-workers, doctors, researchers and\ngovernments may not acquire all the medical information they want,\nwhen they want it (Currie 2005; Etzioni 2000). At the same time,\nindividuals who want medical privacy may feel they lack meaningful\ncontrol over what happens to their personal information. The rise of\nsocial media, smart phones, wearable health monitoring devices,\npersonal possession of electronic copies of medical records, consumer\nDNA testing and precision medicine represent diverse opportunities for\nintended and unintended disclosures of health-related images and\ninformation. The practical ability of individuals to control and\nprotect their health privacy is partly a function of effective data\nsecurity, their knowledge of contemporary medical data management\npractices and social-economic privileges (Bridges 2017; Marx 2007).\nChildren, along with adults in active military service, judged\nmentally incompetent, dependent on government entitlement programs or\nincarcerated, lack substantial control over their medical privacy\n(Annas et al. 2013). In the context of medical emergencies, infections\ndiseases and epidemics, competent adult civilians not in custody may\nbe denied the choice to keep their medical information private. \n\nSecond, many medical professionals, hospitals, insurers and other\nentities with access to health information regard maintaining the\nconfidentiality of medical communications and the security of medical\ninformation as paramount professional responsibilities (Daly et al.,\n2015; Presidential Commission 2016). This sensibility extends to\nsocial work, mental health and pharmacy records. Moreover, clinical\nhealth care providers and bio-medical researchers generally seek to\naccommodate patients\u2019 reasonable expectations of privacy and are\nrequired to do so by state and national laws (Allen 2011; Presidential\nCommission 2009). That said, encouraging patients to embrace sharing\nhealth information to improve research, clinical practices and their\nown care is an emergent trend (Juengst et al. 2016).\n\nThird, societies impose major privacy and private choice-related legal\nobligations on their members (Waldman 2018; Allen 2016; Westin 1967).\nLegal obligations of privacy and confidentiality bind persons and also\nbind health care providers, insurers, health-data processors, health\nresearchers, public health officials and government (Mello at al.\n2016; DHHS 2015; GAO 2001). Thus in a number of legal systems,\ndisclosing a private medical fact or breaching medical confidentiality\ncan result in civil liability (Allen and Rotenberg 2016; Solove 2004,\n2008). The law imposes obligations to respect informational privacy\n(e.g., confidentiality, anonymity, secrecy and data security);\nphysical privacy (e.g., modesty and bodily integrity); associational\nprivacy (e.g., intimate sharing of death, illness and recovery);\nproprietary privacy (e.g., self ownership and control over personal\nidentifiers, genetic data, and biospecimens); and decisional privacy\n(e.g., autonomy and choice in medical decision-making) (Allen 2016).\nYet privacy is not everything in the eyes of the law, nor is it a\nsufficient or absolute ethical good (Allen 2003). In the context of\nemergencies and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 global\npandemic, symptom checking, disclosures, surveillance and contact\ntracing that diminish privacy may be encouraged and legally permitted\nor mandated. The desire of health officials and researchers for health\ndata concerning chronic health problems, such as diabetes, hepatitis\nand drug addiction, has prompted them to seek or legally obtain\notherwise confidential health records.\n\nFourth, the traditional emphasis in academic and policy discussions of\nprivacy on informed consent and choice grounded in individual freedom,\ncan neglect the ways in which health disparities and societies\u2019\nstructural injustices contribute to poor health, constrain choice and\nreduce opportunity (Skinner-Thompson, 2021; Obasagie and Darnovsky\n2018; Shepherd and Wilson 2018; Bridges 2017). Moreover, the rise of\nbig data and artificial intelligence in the digital economy have made\nit increasingly difficult for any individual to exercise meaningful\ncontrol over the collection, manipulation and use of medically-related\nand other personal information about them (Kasperbauer 2020; Velez,\n2020; Allen 2016; Cato et al. 2016; van der Sloot 2017).\n",
