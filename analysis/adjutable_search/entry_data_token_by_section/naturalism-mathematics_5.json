    "main_text": "Elucidating Methodological Naturalism || Authoritative\n3.1 Authoritative\n\n\nHow should we understand the claim that some set of standards ought\nto be authoritative in the philosophy of mathematics? We may preserve\ngenerality by referring to X-standards, the instances of interest to us\nbeing \u2018scientific\u2019, \u2018mathematical\u2019 or\n\u2018scientific-cum-mathematical\u2019. Here are some\n(non-exhaustive) readings of the authority claim:\n\n\n\nBiconditional Naturalism: accept p iff p is\nsanctioned by X-standards\n\n\nTrumping Naturalism: accept p if p is sanctioned by\nX-standards.\n\n\nEmphasis\nNaturalism: In assessing whether p, give more emphasis to\nX-standards.\n\n\nCompatibility Naturalism: do not accept p if p is\nincompatible with X-standards.\n\n\n\nThe biconditional reading is the strongest of the four. It expresses\nthe thought that valid standards just are X-standards. In contrast with\nbiconditional naturalism, the trumping version apparently allows that a\nstatement in the philosophy of mathematics may be acceptable even if\nX-standards do not sanction it. For instance, Burgess and Rosen express\ntheir naturalism as follows:\n\n\nThe naturalists' commitment is \u2026 to the comparatively modest\nproposition that when science [understood to include mathematics]\nspeaks with a firm and unified voice, the philosopher is either\nobliged to accept its conclusions or to offer what are recognizably\nscientific reasons for resisting them (1997, 65).\n\n\nThis is naturally glossed as a trumping version of\nscientific-cum-mathematical naturalism. It seems to allow that if\nmathematics and science do not speak with a firm voice on a question,\nwe may accept the verdict of some other discipline.\n\n\nEmphasis Naturalism is a vaguer doctrine. Various versions arise depending on\nhow much emphasis is placed on X-standards. A modest version captures the position of naturalistically-inclined but not outright naturalist philosophers. We recover biconditional naturalism when X-standards are emphasised to the point where no others matter.\n\n\nCompatibility naturalism is not as strong as trumping\nnaturalism. If p is sanctioned by X-standards then\ncompatibility naturalism enjoins the non-acceptance of\n\u00acp but it does not necessarily enjoin the acceptance\nof p. Non-acceptance of \u00acp falls short of\nacceptance of p since there is always the option to suspend judgment on\np. The compatibility view is generally accepted by most contemporary\nphilosophers. To take an example from outside the philosophy of\nmathematics, most philosophers would reject a philosophy of time that\nclashes with the theory of relativity (in this case X = science).\nWithin the philosophy of mathematics, most philosophers would reject a\nphilosophy of mathematics that implies, for instance, that complex\nanalysis should be jettisoned (in this case X could be science,\nmathematics, or mathematics-cum-science).\n\n\nVarious weaker methodological theses are sometimes labelled\n\u2018naturalist\u2019, for instance the rejection of Cartesian\nfoundationalism, but here we understand the term more robustly. Which\nof the above variants is the right way to develop naturalism depends\nof course on how naturalism is motivated (section 4).\n",
