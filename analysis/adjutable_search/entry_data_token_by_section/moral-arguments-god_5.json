    "main_text": "Practical Moral Arguments for Belief in God\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt seems clear that no version of the moral argument constitutes a\n\u201cproof\u201d of God\u2019s existence. Each version contains\npremises that many reasonable thinkers reject. However, this does not\nmean the arguments have no force. One might think of each version of\nthe argument as attempting to spell out the \u201ccost\u201d of\nrejecting the conclusion. Some philosophers will certainly be willing\nto pay the cost, and indeed have independent reasons for doing so.\nHowever, it would certainly be interesting and important if one became\nconvinced that atheism required one to reject moral realism\naltogether, or to embrace an implausible account of how moral\nknowledge is acquired. For those who think that some version or\nversions of the arguments have force, the cumulative case for theistic\nbelief may be raised by such arguments.\n",
