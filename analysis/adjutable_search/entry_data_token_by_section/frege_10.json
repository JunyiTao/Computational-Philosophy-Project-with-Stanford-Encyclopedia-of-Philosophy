    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language || Frege\u2019s Puzzles\n3.1 Frege\u2019s Puzzles\n\nFrege\u2019s seminal paper in the philosophy of language is\n\u2018\u00dcber Sinn und Bedeutung\u2019 (\u2018On Sense and\nReference\u2019, 1892a). In this paper, Frege considered two puzzles\nabout language and noticed, in each case, that one cannot account for\nthe meaningfulness or logical behavior of certain sentences simply on\nthe basis of the denotations of the terms (names and descriptions) in\nthe sentence. One puzzle concerned identity statements and the other\nconcerned sentences with subordinate clauses such as propositional\nattitude reports. To solve these puzzles, Frege suggested that the\nterms of a language have both a sense and a denotation, i.e., that at\nleast two semantic relations are required to explain the significance\nor meaning of the terms of a language. This idea has inspired research\nin the field for over a century and we discuss it in what follows.\n(See Heck and May 2006 for further discussion of Frege\u2019s\ncontribution to the philosophy of language.)\n3.1.1 Frege\u2019s Puzzle About Identity Statements\n\n\nHere are some examples of identity statements:\n\\(117+136 = 253\\).\n\n The morning star is identical to the evening star.\n\n Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens.\n\n Bill is Debbie\u2019s father.\n\n\nFrege believed that these statements all have the form\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, where \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 are either names or descriptions that\ndenote individuals. He naturally assumed that a sentence of\nthe form \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 is true if and only if the object \\(a\\)\njust is (identical to) the object \\(b\\). For example, the sentence\n\u2018\\(117+136 = 253\\)\u2019 is true if and only if the number \\(117+136\\)\njust is the number \\(253\\). And the statement \u2018Mark Twain is Samuel\nClemens\u2019 is true if and only if the person Mark Twain just is\nthe person Samuel Clemens.\n\n\nBut Frege noticed (1892a) that this account of truth can\u2019t be\nall there is to the meaning of identity statements. The statement\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 has a cognitive significance (or meaning) that\nmust be different from the cognitive significance of\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. We can learn that \u2018Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain\u2019 is true simply by inspecting it; but we can\u2019t learn\nthe truth of \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 simply by\ninspecting it \u2014 you have to examine the world to see whether the\ntwo persons are the same. Similarly, whereas you can learn that\n\u2018\\(117+136 = 117+136\\)\u2019 and \u2018the morning star is\nidentical to the morning star\u2019 are true simply by inspection,\nyou can\u2019t learn the truth of \u2018\\(117+136 = 253\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018the morning star is identical to the evening star\u2019 simply\nby inspection. In the latter cases, you have to do some arithmetical\nwork or astronomical investigation to learn the truth of these\nidentity claims. Now the problem becomes clear: the meaning of\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 clearly differs from the meaning of\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, but given the account of the truth described in\nthe previous paragraph, these two identity statements appear to have\nthe same meaning whenever they are true! For example, \u2018Mark\nTwain = Mark Twain\u2019 is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Mark Twain. And \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel\nClemens\u2019 is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Samuel Clemens. But given that Mark Twain\njust is Samuel Clemens, these two cases are the same case, and that\ndoesn\u2019t explain the difference in meaning between the two\nidentity sentences. And something similar applies to all the other\nexamples of identity statements having the forms\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019.\n\n\nSo the puzzle Frege discovered is: how do we account for the\ndifference in cognitive significance between \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 when they are true?\n3.1.2 Frege\u2019s Puzzle About Propositional Attitude Reports\n\n\nFrege is generally credited with identifying the following puzzle\nabout propositional attitude reports, even though he didn\u2019t quite\ndescribe the puzzle in the terms used below. A propositional attitude\nis a psychological relation between a person and a proposition. Belief,\ndesire, intention, discovery, knowledge, etc., are all psychological\nrelationships between persons, on the one hand, and propositions, on\nthe other. When we report the propositional attitudes of others, these\nreports all have a similar logical form:\n\n \\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) desires that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) intends that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) discovered that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\)\n\n\n\nIf we replace the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 by the name of a person\nand replace the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 with a sentence that\ndescribes the propositional object of their attitude, we get specific\nattitude reports. So by replacing \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 by\n\u2018John\u2019 and \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 by \u2018Mark Twain\nwrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019 in the first example, the\nresult would be the following specific belief report:\n\n John believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nTo see the problem posed by the analysis of propositional attitude\nreports, consider what appears to be a simple principle of reasoning,\nnamely, the Principle of Identity Substitution (this is not to be\nconfused with the Rule of Substitution discussed earlier). If a name,\nsay \\(n\\), appears in a true sentence \\(S\\), and the identity sentence\n\\(n=m\\) is true, then the Principle of Identity Substitution tells us\nthat the substitution of the name \\(m\\) for the name \\(n\\) in \\(S\\)\ndoes not affect the truth of \\(S\\). For example, let \\(S\\) be the true\nsentence \u2018Mark Twain was an author\u2019, let\n\\(n\\) be the name \u2018Mark Twain\u2019, and let \\(m\\) be\nthe name \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019. Then since the identity\nsentence \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 is true, we can\nsubstitute \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nwithout affecting the truth of the sentence. And indeed, the resulting\nsentence \u2018Samuel Clemens was an author\u2019 is true. In other\nwords, the following argument is valid:\n\n Mark Twain was an author.\n\n Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens.\n\n Therefore, Samuel Clemens was an author.\n\n\nSimilarly, the following argument is valid.\n\n \\(4 \\gt 3\\)\n\n \\(4 = 8/2\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(8/2 \\gt 3\\)\n\n\n\nIn general, then, the Principle of Identity Substitution seems to take\nthe following form, where \\(S\\) is a sentence, \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are\nnames, and \\(S(n)\\) differs from \\(S(m)\\) only by the fact\nthat at least one occurrence of \\(m\\) replaces \\(n\\):\n\nFrom \\(S(n)\\) and \\(n=m\\), infer \\(S(m)\\).\n\n\n\nThis principle seems to capture the idea that if we say something\ntrue about an object, then even if we change the name by which we refer\nto that object, we should still be saying something true about that\nobject.\n\n\nBut Frege, in effect, noticed the following counterexample to the\nPrinciple of Identity Substitution. Consider the following\nargument:\n\n John believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens.\n\n Therefore, John believes that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry\nFinn.\n\n\n\nThis argument is not valid. There are circumstances in which the\npremises are true and the conclusion false. We have already described\nsuch circumstances, namely, one in which John learns the name\n\u2018Mark Twain\u2019 by reading Huckleberry Finn but\nlearns the name \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 in the context of learning\nabout 19th century American authors (without learning that the name\n\u2018Mark Twain\u2019 was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens). John may\nnot believe that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry\nFinn. The premises of the above argument, therefore, do not\nlogically entail the conclusion. So the Principle of Identity\nSubstitution appears to break down in the context of propositional\nattitude reports.  The puzzle, then, is to say what causes the\nprinciple to fail in these contexts. Why aren\u2019t we still saying\nsomething true about the man in question if all we have done is\nchanged the name by which we refer to him?\n",
