    "main_text": "\n\nMarriage, a prominent institution regulating sex, reproduction, and\nfamily life, is a route into classical philosophical issues such as\nthe good and the scope of individual choice, as well as itself raising\ndistinctive philosophical questions. Political philosophers have taken\nthe organization of sex and reproduction to be essential to the health\nof the state, and moral philosophers have debated whether marriage has\na special moral status and relation to the human good. Philosophers\nhave also disputed the underlying moral and legal rationales for the\nstructure of marriage, with implications for questions such as the\ncontent of its moral obligations and the legal recognition of same-sex\nmarriage. Feminist philosophers have seen marriage as playing a\ncrucial role in women\u2019s oppression and thus a central topic of\njustice. In this area philosophy courts public debate: in 1940,\nBertrand Russell\u2019s appointment to an academic post was withdrawn\non the grounds that the liberal views expressed in Marriage and\nMorals made him morally unfit for such a post. Likewise, debate\nover same-sex marriage has been highly charged. Unlike some\ncontemporary issues sparking such wide interest, there is a long\ntradition of philosophical thought on marriage.\n\nPhilosophical debate concerning marriage extends to what marriage,\nfundamentally, is; therefore, Section 1 examines its definition.\nSection 2 sets out the historical development of the philosophy of\nmarriage, which shapes today\u2019s debates. Many of the ethical\npositions on marriage can be understood as divided on the question of\nwhether marriage should be defined contractually by the spouses or by\nits institutional purpose, and they further divide on whether that\npurpose necessarily includes procreation or may be limited to the\nmarital love relationship. Section 3 taxonomizes ethical views of\nmarriage accordingly. Section 4 will examine rival political\nunderstandings of marriage law and its rationale. Discussion of\nmarriage has played a central role in feminist philosophy; Section 5\nwill outline the foremost critiques of the institution.\n",
