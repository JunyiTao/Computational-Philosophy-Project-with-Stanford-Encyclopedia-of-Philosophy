Related Views\n\nThe view that a quantum state describes physical reality is sometimes\ncalled \\(\\psi\\)-ontic, by contrast with a \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic view that\nit represents an agent\u2019s incomplete information about an\nunderlying physical state. When Harrigan and Spekkens (2010)\noriginally defined these terms they applied them only to what they\ncalled ontic models of quantum theory. But others have since used them\nmore broadly to classify alternative views of quantum states outside\nof the ontological models framework. QBists and pragmatists are not\nthe only ones to adopt a view that is neither \\(\\psi\\)-ontic nor\n\\(\\psi\\)-epistemic in these broader senses. Other views share the\npragmatist thought that quantum states aren\u2019t a function of any\nagent\u2019s actual epistemic state because quantum state assignments\nare required to conform to objective standards of correctness. This\nsection covers two such views.\n",
