    "main_text": "Eastern Han (25\u2013220CE) || Politics of Reclusion: Wang Fu\n3.4 Politics of Reclusion: Wang Fu\n\nThe work of Wang Fu (82\u2013167 CE) represents one of the strains of\nConfucian thought that began to gain new ground in the Eastern Han as\nthe dynasty went into decline leading toward the series of\ncatastrophes that would end with the collapse of the Han in the late\nsecond and early third centuries CE. The tradition of social criticism\nhad long been part of Confucian scholarship, but Wang Fu\u2019s work\nQianfulun (Discourses of a Hermit) revived the theme of\nConfucian reclusion, a controversial idea, though one suggested in\ntexts such as the Analects itself. Perhaps the most famous\nexample of such reclusion (in Wang\u2019s time and our own) was that\nof the Warring States Period scholar Qu Yuan (c. 340\u2013278 BCE),\nthe subject and purported author of the poems of the Han period\ncompilation Chuci (Songs of Chu). Qu Yuan, faced with the\ndecline of society past the point of reformation, went into exile in\nthe distant wilds, composing his laments including the famous poem\nLi Sao (compiled in the Chuci), and eventually\ncommitting suicide by drowning himself in the river as a final act of\nrighteous protest (see Berkowitz 1992; Schneider 1980).\n\nWang Fu\u2019s Qianfulun is in part a revival of the\napproach of Confucian disengagement, offering a solution to the\ntension between social concern and personal virtue. Early Confucians,\nhundreds of years before Wang Fu\u2019s time, stressed the importance\nof strong commitment to the development and moral rectification of\nsociety as a whole. The morally developed person, according to these\nthinkers, has a commitment to the community that is not contingent on\nthe goodness of the community. This must be the case for all of the\ncommunities that one is part of and that make up vital facts about who\none is\u2014the state, the village, the family. One cannot abandon or\nturn one\u2019s back on a corrupt or vicious family, but instead must\nput their effort into trying to rectify this community. To do less\nthan this would be a failure of one\u2019s humanity. We find many\npassages in the early texts committing to such a view (for example\nAnalects 4.18). At the same time, we find an alternative\nresponse developed in these same texts, including the\nAnalects (8.13; 15.6) and Xunzi (32.7). The\ncommitted and morally developed person has a responsibility to take an\nactive role in the community when the times (shi \u6642)\nare such that either the moral way prevails or it is possible that one\ncan bring it about. But when the times are such that the moral way is\nabandoned and it is impossible to bring it about, the morally\ndeveloped person should stay away from taking an active role, lest\nthey become morally soiled.\n\nIn the late Han, the theme of disengagement and reclusion due to\nmorally corrupted government, which had been popular in the Warring\nStates but had declined through the years of the earlier Western and\nEastern Han, was revived, with thinkers like Wang Fu at the forefront\nof this movement. Wang Fu\u2019s advocacy of retreat from society is,\nlike those of the Confucian recluses of the past, ultimately aimed at\nrestoring virtue to society. Wang recognized that when a community\npasses a certain threshold of viciousness and disorder, it is not\npossible for the individual to transform it. The only possible outcome\nin such a case, if the individual engages with the society, is for the\nindividual to be transformed, to become vicious and disordered like\nthe community. Despite the loftiest intentions and the most developed\ncharacter, one cannot withstand the transformative power of the\ncommunity. Thus, remaining within a corrupt community with the\nintention of changing it would lead only to the corruption of the\nindividual rather than the moral salvation of the community.\n\nWang Fu\u2019s response is to advocate continuation of the work of\nattempting to morally rectify the community, from the outside, through\nsuch activity as scholarship and writing. Even if this is for the\nbenefit of future generations rather than one\u2019s own, one\u2019s\nresponsibility to the community and commitment to it should not\ndiminish even when one is forced to withdraw from society due to its\nviciousness. While the theme of Confucian reclusion is perhaps the\nmost important aspect of Wang Fu\u2019s work, we find a number of\nother standard Confucian ideas developed in the Qianfulun,\nincluding views on rulership, virtues, learning, ritual, and even some\nfurther development of the correlative metaphysics of the earlier\nHan.\n",
