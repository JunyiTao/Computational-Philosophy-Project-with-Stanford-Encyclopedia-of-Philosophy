    "main_text": "Social and Societal Implications || Applications and Ethical Issues\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nSystems and synthetic biology are often described as distinguishable\nin their emphasis on analysis versus synthesis, but the ties to\nengineering approaches are complex and multi-faceted in both fields.\nSystems and synthetic biology have been addressed together in this\nentry because many scientific and philosophical issues overlap. Both\napproaches draw inspiration from engineering, mathematics, physics,\nand computer science, but in various different ways and towards the\ndifferent aims of understanding, predicting, and modifying biological\nsystems. Accordingly, both approaches provide excellent sources for\nphilosophical discussions of interdisciplinary integration,\nparticularly the implications of the increasing embedding of\nmathematical and computational approaches in biology. Some practices\nencourage philosophers to revisit classical philosophical topics such\nas reductionism and scientific explanation, but systems and synthetic\nbiology also broaden the scope of philosophical topics to include\ndata-intensive practices and modeling strategies towards the aims of\ndesign and control.\n\nSince this entry has examined the philosophical implications of both\nsystems biology and synthetic biology, much attention has been given\nto the implications of engineering approaches, including the quest for\nso-called design principles. It is, however, important to note that\nsystems biology and synthetic biology cover a broad spectrum of\nresearch practices, some of which are more strongly inspired by\nchemistry or physics than engineering. This entry should thus be taken\nas an attempt to only cover some ground of the vast philosophical\nlandscape that these research fields reach into. With the rapid\ndevelopment of both approaches and their explicit aim to address grand\nscientific and societal challenges, exciting times lie ahead for\nphilosophy of biology.\n",
