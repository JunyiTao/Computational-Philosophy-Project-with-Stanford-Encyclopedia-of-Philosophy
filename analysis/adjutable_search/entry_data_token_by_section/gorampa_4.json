    "main_text": "Gorampa\u2019s Madhyamaka || The Role of Logic\n2.3 The Role of Logic\n\nGorampa\u2019s understanding of the relationship between the two\ntruths and the use of negation in the tetralemma reinforce his\nunderstanding of the ways in which a practitioner should proceed on\nthe Buddhist path toward awakening. Through the logic of the\ntetralemma, Gorampa demonstrates that the final goal of awakening is\nbeyond conceptual thought.\n\nConceptual thought comes from ignorance, so by eradicating ignorance,\none eradicates conceptual thought. In other words, since an awakened\nbeing is completely free from ignorance, she has no concepts\nwhatsoever. This claim is quite controversial for obvious reasons:\nbuddhas are understood as consisting of perfect wisdom, and are\ndescribed in scriptures as omniscient beings. How, then, can a buddha\nhave no concepts at all, but still be considered omniscient?\n\nTsongkhapa and his fellow Gelugpa opponents criticize Gorampa for this\nvery reason. They contend that Gorampa\u2019s philosophy negates too\nmuch \u2013 it \u201coverpervades\u201d (khyab che ba). They\nargue that if the final goal of awakening is really a complete\nelimination of concepts, then one ought to be able to attain awakening\nby simply falling asleep or otherwise becoming unconscious. Gorampa\ncontends, however, that in order to successfully eliminate all\nconcepts in their entirety, it is absolutely essential that one begins\nby using logic and reasoning. The end result is indeed nonconceptual,\nbut it differs from the quietism that is a result of simply\nnot-thinking, without any prior analysis.\n\nThe issue underlying this debate concerns the status of conceptual\ncontent in the minds of fully awakened buddhas. Gorampa contends,\nciting Candrak\u012brti, that fully awakened buddhas have no\nconceptual content whatsoever; they have completely eliminated\nignorance in its entirety, and therefore do not actively engage in the\nconventional world. They do not conceive of things as existent,\nnonexistent, both, or neither. In fact, they do not conceive of things\nat all. They do, however, appear to be omniscient from the\nperspective of ordinary beings, and because of their previous karma\nand the compassion that they have cultivated on the path to\nenlightenment, they continue to function in the world for the benefit\nof ordinary unenlightened beings for a period of time.\n\nThe implications of Gorampa\u2019s view are significant. While\nTsongkhapa\u2019s model stresses the eradication of only certain\nkinds of concepts \u2013 e.g., concepts relating to the ultimate\nexistence of things \u2013 Gorampa\u2019s model shows that\nall concepts must be eliminated, first through the logical\nreasoning of the tetralemma, and then through subsequent meditative\npractices. Because Gorampa is not concerned with the preservation of\ncertain kinds of concepts, he is more tolerant of variations in styles\nof argumentation that might be used to arrive at a state of freedom\nfrom conceptual proliferations.\n",
