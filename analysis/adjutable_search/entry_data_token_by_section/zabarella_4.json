    "main_text": "The Regressus-Method\n5. The Regressus-Method\n\n\nThe so-called regressus-method is a model for combining\ncomposition and resolution: the idea of this combinatory process is\nfound in the Aristotelian tradition from Averroes on, and it was\nvitally revived among the Italian Aristotelians and medical authors.\nAccording to this method, the natural philosopher should first infer\nfrom the known effect the existence of the cause of this very effect.\nSometimes he may use induction, but usually resolution, which was also\ncalled demonstratio quia or demonstration from the fact. Then\nin the second step, in the so-called demonstratio propter\nquid or demonstration from the reasoned fact (or composition),\nthe natural philosopher should infer from the cause to the effect. The\neffect is now known through its cause, and hence in a scientific\nmanner (Risse 1983). The crucial problem with this procedure is how to\navoid mere circular reasoning, or rather, how to make sure that the\ncause, whose existence is demonstrated in the first step, is indeed\nthe cause of this very effect. From the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury, it had become clear that it was necessary to introduce a\nthird, intermediary step, which involved some kind of intellectual\nconsideration (negotiatio intellectus) (Kessler 1998,\np. 838).\n\n\nZabarella also had to face the question, how the intellect in fact\nmade this mental consideration. He solves the problem in terms of his\npsychology of knowledge and calls this third step a mental examination\n(examen mentale). Since for him the task of this intermediary\nstep is to make distinct the confused knowledge of the cause that was\nacquired through the first step, he refers to his work on the agent\nmind (Liber de mente agente) in which he develops an account\nof the transformation of confused into distinct knowledge through the\nanalysis of a given whole in terms of its parts. He presents this\nprocess as the specific ability of the human mind. Thus once more\nmethod as a means of acquiring knowledge is based on the cognitive\nstructure of knowing subject rather than on the ontological structure\nof the object of knowledge. In his commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics Zabarella identified Aristotle\u2019s proofs that the\nplanets are near and that the moon is a sphere as instances of the\nregressus-method. Other examples of the same method he\nanalyzed are Aristotle\u2019s proof of the existence of \u201cfirst\nmatter\u201d (materia prima) from substantial change and his\nproof of an \u201ceternal first mover\u201d (primus motor\naeternus) from local motion (Wallace 1999, p. 338).\n\n\nThe interminable discussion of the methodology of arts and sciences in\nthe sixteenth century may be seen as an attempt to defend the\nscientific status of either the recently found autonomous sciences,\nlike natural philosophy, or, on the other hand, the empirically based\nproductive arts. The discussions of orders and methods, resolutions,\ncompositions and the regressus-method are, therefore, not\nmerely further elaborations of an old Aristotelian tradition, but also\nexpressions of opinions in a lively debate concerning the changing\nrelationships between various arts and sciences in sixteenth-century\nItalian universities (Mikkeli 1997, p. 228).\n",
