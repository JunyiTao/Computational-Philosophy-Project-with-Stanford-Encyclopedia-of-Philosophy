    "main_text": "Ethical Philosophy || Moral Cosmic Synthesis\n3.2 Moral Cosmic Synthesis\n\nIn his watershed essay, A Treatise on Humanity\n(Renshuo), Zhu Xi discourses on the classical Confucian\nteaching of humanity (ren) in a unified cosmic and human\nperspective. In concluding, he criticizes alternative accounts of\nhumanity, i.e., Confucius\u2019 spirit of humaneness, on various\nconceptual and ethical\n grounds.[13]\n Following the early Han tradition, Zhu opens by associating humaneness with\ncosmic creativity. In its most basic manifestation, humaneness is\ncharacterized as the impulse of \u201cheaven and earth\u201d (the\ncosmos) to produce things. By extension, this impulse yields the cycle\nof seasons and the pervasive fecundity of nature. Advocates of this\ndoctrine had found confirmation in the rich, productive Chinese soil\nand temperate climate, which supported their assumption that nature\nwas generally fertile and afforded the right conditions for human\nflourishing. Pervasive, the impulse to produce appears in each and\nevery one of the myriad creatures while in human beings it is refined\ninto the virtue of \u201chumaneness\u201d, which, when fully\nrealized, involves one\u2019s caring attitude and dedicated\nresponsibility toward others. Zhu Xi moreover correlates\n\u201corigination, growth, flourishing and firmness\u201d, the\nfourfold initial stages of creativity and production in the cosmos and\nhuman nature first mentioned in early commentaries on the Book of\nChange, with humaneness, appropriateness, ritual conduct and\nwisdom, the four cardinal virtues enunciated by Confucius. Zhu Xi thus\nportrays the fully cultivated person as at once a complement to heaven\nand earth, a vital participant in cosmic creativity, and a catalyst\nfor the flourishing and self-realization of others. On this basis, he\ngoes on to formulate the definition of ren (humanity,\nhumaneness) for the subsequent tradition: \u201cthe essential\ncharacter of mind\u201d and \u201cthe essential pattern of\nlove\u201d. The virtue of humaneness thus grounds the disposition of\nmind as commiserative and describes the core of moral self-realization\nas love for others (other-directed concern), to be appropriately\nmanifested.\n\nIn the closing argument of the Treatise on Humanity, Zhu Xi\nstresses that while the stillness and activity phases of the emotions\nprovide emotive stage setting for one\u2019s dedicated cultivation,\nrealization, and practice of humaneness, what is crucial is the\nprofound insight that,\n\n\nIf one could but truly practice love and maintain it (italics\nadded), one would possess the well-spring of all virtues and the root\nof all good deeds. (based on Chan 1963, 212\u2013227, edited) \n\n\nUnder this premise, Zhu cites Confucius\u2019 advice to Yan Hui,\n\u201cMaster the self by practicing ritual propriety\u201d\n(Analects XII.1). For Zhu Xi, one masters oneself to rein in\none\u2019s na\u00efve self-centeredness by paying ritual respect to\nothers, which in turn spurs a change in the axis of one\u2019s moral\nconcern to other people, especially those with whom one is related and\ndaily interacts. What is important, then, is the moral-ethical\naxis of one\u2019s motivations. But, how is one to sustain and\nmanifest this humanity consistently in attitude and practice? Zhu Xi\ndoes not appeal to philosophic reflection but recommends mindful\n(jing) daily cultivation and practice, i.e., being calm and\nfocused, respectful in personal life, diligent in conducting affairs,\nand dedicated to upholding interpersonal\n relations.[14]\n Moreover, he considers that the emotions play a fundamental role in\nethical cultivation and performance. After stressing serving\none\u2019s parents with filiality and one\u2019s elder brother with\nfraternal respect, Zhu Xi urges: \u201cBe loving in dealing with all\nthings\u201d, which goes well beyond standard filtered and restrained\n\u201cgraded\u201d Confucian love.\n\nHumaneness is not just a matter of being thoughtful and considerate and paying one\u2019s due respect to others ; Zhu Xi underscores the rigors of conducting oneself sincerely and authentically with humaneness, citing Confucius\u2019 examples of not only ministers who had declined official posts to maintain their\nintegrity but of times when the exemplary person is willing to\nsacrifice his or her own life to fulfill humanity (Analects\n15.8). Nonetheless, the animating spirit of Zhu Xi\u2019s\nTreatise remains: \u201clove people gently and benefit\nthings\u201d, as reflected in Mencius\u2019 four incipient ethical\nimpulses and Confucius\u2019 four cardinal\n virtues.[15]\n",
