    "main_text": "Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages || Early Christian Views of Music: Augustine and Boethius\n2.1 Early Christian Views of Music: Augustine and Boethius\n\nSaint Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430), philosopher and Father of\nthe Church, devoted to music his treatise De Musica. Although\nmostly technical in character, the book is an early statement of the\nmedieval view of music as first and foremost a science, rather than a\npractical occupation. Augustine defines music as \u201cthe science of\nmensurating well\u201d (scientia bene modulandi\u2014this\nlast word is at times rendered as \u2018modulation\u2019), that is,\nthe discipline concerned with the attainment of measure and proportion\n(De Musica, book I, 2).\n\nAn almost identical definition of music is found in Cassiodorus\n(485\u2013c. 585) who states that \u201cMusic indeed is the\nknowledge of apt modulation\u201d (Institutiones, 5), as\nwell as in Isidore of Seville\u2019s (560\u2013636)\nEtymologiarum:\n\n\nMusic is an art of modulation consisting of tone and song called music\nby derivation from the Muses. (Etymologiarum, book III,\n15)\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s attitude toward the sensory pleasure derived from\nmusic was conflicted. On the one hand, he recognizes music\u2019s\npower in worship. On the other hand, he is aware that this could also\nlead the faithful to stray away from the religious content of the\nexperience (Confessions, II).\n\nThe philosopher Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (c.\n480\u2013525/26), normally referred to simply as Boethius, had a\nfundamental role in shaping medieval musical thinking. Through\ncommentated translations of Greek authors and original expositions of\ntheir views, Boethius allowed classical Greek philosophical ideas to\nsurvive into the Middle Ages. He did so in the field of music by\nwriting De Institutione Musica. In this work, Boethius\nsummarizes music theory as found in the Greek treatises he knew. The\nbook also distinguishes between three types of music: musica\nmundana, humana, and instrumentalis. Musica\nmundana is the harmony of the cosmos, a Pythagorean concept that\nfound widespread acceptance over the course of the Middle Ages, though\nit was recast in Christian terms. Musica humana is described\nonly briefly by Boethius, though it is clear that it is the harmony\nbetween the various elements that compose the human body. Some modern\naccounts of Boethius\u2019s thought identify musica humana\nwith singing, but this is incorrect, though it is true that later\nmedieval thinkers used the term in such a way (see Dyer 2007: 59; 64;\n69). Finally, musica instrumentalis is sounding music, vocal\nand instrumental. While this is undoubtedly regarded today as the core\nof music, Boethius considers it as music only in a derivative sense.\nBoethius\u2019s tripartite division is repeated and accepted by\nnumerous medieval writers on music.\n\nBoethius also takes from Greek Antiquity the Platonic view that music\nmay arouse emotions and influence human character. He observes that\nthis sets music apart from other mathematical disciplines (De\nInstitutione Musica, book I, 1).\n",
