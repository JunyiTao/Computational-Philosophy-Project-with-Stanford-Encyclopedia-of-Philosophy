    "main_text": "Princely Moderation\n5. Princely Moderation\n\nJohn applies his principle that virtue is by definition a mean between\nexcess and deficiency emphatically to the ruler. The moral qualities\nof the community as a whole are inextricable linked, in John\u2019s\nview, to the moral characteristics of its royal head. By dint of his\npersonal character, the good prince\u2014the king\u2014assures the\ncoherence and well-being of the polity he rules; by contrast, a\nvicious prince\u2014the tyrant\u2014will reduce his subjects to\nslaves of his own private desires. Given the definition of virtue that\nJohn posits, the actions of a king must themselves and by definition\nbe moderate. According to the Policraticus, the moderation\nexercised by the good ruler necessarily unifies and balances the\nrelationship that his people enjoy with one another. Employing a\nmusical metaphor, he asks,\n\n\nHow much more care should be taken by princes to be moderate\u2014at\none time by the vigour of justice, at another by the forgiveness of\nmercy\u2014so that subjects are made to be of a single mind \u2026\nand the works of peace and charity create one perfect and great\nharmony out of pursuits which appear discordant? (PC: 51)\n\n\nThis does not mean that the king is the absolute arbiter of his\nsubjects\u2019 morals. Rather, the good prince should instruct by\nexample, adopting that \u201ctranquil moderation of mind\u201d so\nvalued in the magistrates of antiquity (PC: 54). While never\nencouraging vice, John\u2019s preferred ruler would tolerate\u2014or\nat least not punish hastily and harshly\u2014those evils committed by\nmembers of the community that do not endanger public order or\nreligious orthodoxy. John cautions that \u201cthe amount of the\naffection, with which subjects are embraced [by the king] like\nbrothers in the arms of charity must be confined to the limits of\nmoderation\u201d, lest his people lose respect for him and believe\nthat they can perform all manner of wickedness without fear of\nconsequence (PC: 49). Yet, the Policraticus protests against\nthe ruler \u201cwho is too excessively inclined towards the punishing\nof the faults of subjects\u201d (PC: 54). While the king should\nrapidly take action against those \u201cflagrant crimes\u201d that\n\u201cone is not permitted to endure or which cannot faithfully be\nendured\u201d, he should also demonstrate mildness and patience\ntoward those acts of his subjects \u201cwhich honor and religion can\nsecurely endure\u201d (PC: 140). Special royal virtue, the art of\ngovernance, consists in the moderate use of the authority that God has\nbestowed.\n\nAlthough John regards the king as \u201cthe minister of God\u201d\nand the servant of divine law, the good ruler must restrain himself\nwith the bridle of law and hold back his will, while maintaining\nhumility in his relations with his subjects, since he is defined by\nmoderation in all his deeds and decrees (PC: 28\u201329,\n46\u201349). A good ruler will display such restraint despite his\ndivinely mandated power, according to John, because the king\u2019s\ningrained moral character\u2014the result of a careful program of\ninstruction\u2014necessarily guides him to seek justice and to\nrespect divine dictates. It bears emphasis that John\u2019s\nconception of the nature of political power is an entirely\npersonalized one: The incumbent makes the office. The king\u2019s\ndisposition to follow the path of moderation is reinforced by the\nrewards that he receives: Honored among men, he guarantees a peaceful\nreign and safe succession; beloved of God, he will receive the gift of\nsalvation. \u201cKings can both flourish and abound with the most\nsweet worldly things\u201d, John proclaims, \u201cand yet can pick\nthe most useful fruits of eternity\u201d (PC: 55). Nor does he\nsuppose that such desserts pertain only to the most righteous of\nrulers:\n\n\nTo refuse evil is a great thing in them [princes], even if they do no\ngreat goodness, provided that they do not permit their subjects to\nindulge in evil. (PC: 55)\n\n\nThe king who refrains from misusing his great powers and who pursues\npolicies that maintain the harmonious order of the community assures\nhappiness (temporal and eternal) for himself, his progeny, and his\nsubjects.\n\nThe opposite of the king is the tyrant, who is characterized by the\nimmoderate application of political power over those subject to him.\nIf the ruler seeks excessive domination, if he attempts to use his\npower to enslave the community, then he is a tyrant. That is, the\ntyrant is a person possessing a wholly self-interested and willful\ncharacter whose ambition for the supreme governmental office has been\nfulfilled. What renders him a tyrant is, strictly speaking, neither\nhis moral qualities nor the power he exercises, but the conjunction\nand combination of the two. A tyrant claims a monopoly of\ndiscretionary authority over all those under his control, so that the\nmaintenance of his full license requires the absence of true freedom\nfor others. The Policraticus insists that \u201cas long as\nall, collectively and individually, are borne along at the will of a\nsingle head, they are deprived of their own free will\u201d (FCP:\n184). Nor does John believe that the victim of the tyrant ought\n\u201cto make a virtue of necessity by uniting consent and necessity\nand by gracefully embracing that which is incumbent upon him\u201d\n(FCP: 184), as this preserves the mere semblance of liberty. John\ninstead advocates positive measures to protect the community from its\ntyrant\u2014in the last instance, by tyrannicide (discussed below).\nThe good government of the king, typified by rule in accordance with\nthe virtuous mean, is regarded by the Policraticus to be the\nsole guarantee of the freedom necessary for the exercise of moral\ngoodness in society.\n",
