This\ninheritance commits Luk\u00e1cs to a number of methodological claims\nwhich put him into stark opposition not only to social democrats like\nEduard Bernstein but also, perhaps unintentionally, to the orthodoxy\nof the Soviet party.\n\nIn his essay \u201cWhat is Orthodox Marxism?\u201d (1919b),\nLuk\u00e1cs contrasts his method with social democratic economic\ndeterminism. He describes Marxism as a purely methodological\ncommitment to Marx\u2019s dialectics rather than as depending on any\nbelief regarding the truth of Marx\u2019s economic theory. In his essay\non Luxemburg, Luk\u00e1cs even goes so far as to claim that\n\u201cit is not the primacy of economic motives in historical\nexplanation that constitutes the decisive difference between Marxism\nand bourgeois thought, but the point of view of totality\u201d (1921:\n27).\n\nThis primacy of the social totality not only affects the Marxist\nmethod, but also the conception of practice and the underlying social\nontology: by insisting on a foundational role of practice in the\nsocial totality, Luk\u00e1cs makes political action rather than\nlabor into the foundation for overcoming reification (Feenberg 1998).\nWithin his social ontology, Luk\u00e1cs is finally committed to the\nclaim that the totality of historical processes, rather than\nindividual facts, are the foundation of objective reality (1923a: 184;\nfor the resulting view of history, see Merleau-Ponty 1973), leading\nhim to a rejection of all \u201ccontemplative\u201d epistemologies\n(such as Lenin\u2019s) which rely on the idea of a simple correspondence\nbetween thoughts and facts (1923a: 199ff; see also Lichtheim 1970:\n62\u201365; in addition, it follows from the premise that only the\nperspective of the social totality solves the epistemological problems\nof classical philosophy that Luk\u00e1cs must reject Engels\u2019 claim\nthat the experimental method is a model for the type of defetishizing\npraxis that can overcome the subject-object divide, see\n1923a: 131\u2013133). This ontology of pure processuality finally\nentails a normative conception of society that is critical towards all\nforms of institutional rationalization which are rejected as forms of\nalienation across the board. At the same time, in insisting that the\nemancipated society must be capable of presenting itself as a totality\nfor its subjects, Luk\u00e1cs is unable to discover any resources\nfor progress in the differentiation of social spheres (Arato and\nBreines 1979: 155).\n",
