George Berkeley was arguably the first rule-consequentialist.\nHe wrote, \u201cIn framing the general laws of nature, it is granted\nwe must be entirely guided by the public good of mankind, but not in\nthe ordinary moral actions of our lives. \u2026 The rule is framed\nwith respect to the good of mankind; but our practice must be always\nshaped immediately by the rule\u201d (Berkeley 1712: section 31).\n",
