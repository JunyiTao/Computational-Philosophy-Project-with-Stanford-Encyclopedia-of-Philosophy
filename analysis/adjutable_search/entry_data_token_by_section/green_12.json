    "main_text": "Idealist Politics || Rights and the Common Good\n4.1 Rights and the Common Good\n\nGreen\u2019s Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation discuss a number of issues in political philosophy and\njurisprudence, including the adequacy of social contract\njustifications of the nature and limits of state authority, the nature\nof rights, the right to private property, and the justification of\npunishment. Most relevant to understanding Green\u2019s distinctive\nperfectionist conception of liberalism is his conception of\nrights.\n\nGreen\u2019s focus on political obligation concerns the nature and\nlimits of the state\u2019s enforceable demands on its\ncitizens (LPPO \u00a7\u00a71, 12). Social contract theory\nseeks to anchor political obligation in agreement, whether actual or\nhypothetical. Green discusses the social contract theories of Spinoza,\nHobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Though critical of social contract theory\nin general, he is especially critical of Hobbes and expresses sympathy\nwith important elements in Locke and Rousseau.\n\nGreen\u2019s criticisms of social contract theory reflect his\nconception of rights. According to Green, rights are claims that\nindividuals possess to those powers that are socially recognizable as\ncontributing to a common good (LPPO \u00a7\u00a725\u201326,\n113\u2013115, 138, 143). In particular, Green thinks that my rights\nagainst others to certain normative powers are conditional on my\nrecognition that others possess rights to these same powers against me\n(LPPO \u00a7138). Green rejects the idea of natural rights as\nrights prior to society but accepts the idea of natural rights as\nprior to and independent of the positive rights established by\npolitical association (LPPO \u00a7\u00a79, 16, 30).\n\nThis conception of rights leads Green to be skeptical of attempts to\nexplain how rights might emerge from a pre-social state of nature.\nHobbes is Green\u2019s primary target here, because Hobbes views the\nstate of nature as an anti-social condition involving the war of all\nagainst all (Leviathan XIII 8\u20139) and claims that\nindividual rights, or at least individual rights to anything other\nthan non-interference, are possible only when individuals agree to\nleave the state of nature and transfer powers to a sovereign\n(Leviathan XIII 10, 13; XIV 1; XV 3). Green is skeptical in\ntwo ways. First, he doesn\u2019t see how agreement could establish\npolitical obligation if there are no moral duties in the state of\nnature (LPPO \u00a746). If the sovereign is necessary to make\npromises binding, then we can\u2019t explain how the sovereign could\nhimself arise out of binding pre-political compact. Second,\nGreen\u2019s conception of rights leads him to deny the Hobbesian\nclaim that rights and duties depend on the existence of the sovereign.\nRights depend on the common good, and there are facts about the common\ngood prior to political association and positive right.\n\nGreen\u2019s criticisms of Hobbes apply less clearly to Locke and\nRousseau. Locke\u2019s state of nature, though pre-political, is not\nanti-social, and Locke recognizes duties and rights in the state of\nnature (Treatises II.ii.6; II.i.14; II.iii.16\u201321;\nII.vi.57). For Locke, the transition from the state of nature to civil\ngovernment is to facilitate the more reliable and efficient protection\nof natural rights, the protection of property, and the promotion of\nthe public good, all of which are moral demands within the state of\nnature (Treatises II.vii.85; cf. LPPO\n\u00a7\u00a755\u201358).\n\nGreen has even more in common with Rousseau. Rousseau sees the problem\nof political obligation as one of reconciling political association\nand its constraints with individual autonomy. The state of nature is a\npre-political state but one in which individuals are socially\ninterdependent. The problem is to\n\n\nFind a form of association which defends and protects with all common\nforce the person and goods of each associate, and by means of which\neach one, while uniting with all, nevertheless obeys only himself and\nremains as free as before. (Social Contract I.vi.4)\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is for individuals to submit to\nconstraints embodied in forms of association and institutions that are\nregulated by the general will (SC I.vi.9; II.i.1). The\ngeneral will is distinct from the will of all (SC I.vi.7;\nII.iii2) and concerns the common good\u2014those basic interests of\nmoral persons that must be respected and protected for all\n(SC II.iii.1\u20132; II.iv.5; II.xi.1\u20132). Green agrees\nwith Rousseau that the general will, understood as the common good, is\na source of rights and that these rights are conditional on a kind of\nmutual recognition among members of\n society.[8]\n\nGreen disagrees with those strands in social contract theory that see\nconsent to live in political society as the source of rights. He\nthinks that rights are grounded in the common good and mutual\nrecognition and so predate any social contract. In assessing\nGreen\u2019s criticisms of social contract theory, one must assess\nGreen\u2019s own conception of rights. Are rights grounded in the\ncommon good, and do rights require social recognition in some way?\n\nIt seems we do need to ground rights in some way. Grounding them in\nthe common good seems promising, though we won\u2019t know what\nrights this conception supports without knowing more about the content\nof the common good. Insofar as the common good is one in which people\npartake equally insofar as they are moral persons, this conception\nseems likely to support a conception of equal rights to those\nconditions necessary for developing and exercising moral powers of\npersons as agents. These claims about the content of the common good\nare reflected in Green\u2019s brand of perfectionist liberalism.\n\nMust such rights be socially recognized? Even if social recognition\nallows Green to distinguish natural and legal right, we might wonder\nif he can distinguish between natural rights and duties and rights and\nduties recognized by positive morality (see, e.g., Ross 1930:\n50\u201352). The social recognition thesis may seem to preclude\nmaking sense of minority rights or unrecognized rights. Green\naddresses this issue and makes two replies, which clarify the social\nrecognition thesis (LPPO \u00a7\u00a7137\u2013147). First,\nhe does not claim that particular rights need to be the object of\nsocial recognition. It is rather that rights must be contributory to a\ncommon good that is the object of mutual recognition. My claim to\nrespect and rights are conditioned on my recognition that others have\nthe same claim to respect and rights, because we are equally moral\npersons (LPPO \u00a7\u00a7138; cf. Hinton 2001). Still, this\nclaim might suggest that individuals lack rights if others do not\nrecognize them as equal moral persons, and this might seem to imply a\nform of moral conventionalism or parochialism, which would be at odds\nwith Green\u2019s own cosmopolitanism. For this reason, it is\nimportant that Green insists that the sort of social recognition that\nrights require is potential, rather than actual,\nrecognition.\n\n\nThe condition of its [a right\u2019s] being so claimable is that its\nexercise should be contributory to some social good which the public\nconscience is capable of appreciating, not necessarily one which in\nthe existing prevalence of private interest can obtain due\nacknowledgement, but still one of which men in their actions and\nlanguage show themselves to be aware. (LPPO \u00a7143)\n\n\nIn this way, Green recognizes that slaves have natural rights to\nfreedom that are violated, even in societies in which slavery is\nsocially condoned (LPPO \u00a7140). Provided that others are\ncapable of recognizing someone\u2019s common humanity, their failure\nto do so is no obstacle to the recognition of the rights of\nothers.\n",
