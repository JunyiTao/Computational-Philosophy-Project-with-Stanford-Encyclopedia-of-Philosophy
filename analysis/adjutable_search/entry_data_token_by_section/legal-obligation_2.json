    "main_text": "Obligations to the Law\n3. Obligations to the Law\n\nIt may affirm our confidence in the obligation-correlative view to\nknow that from earliest times philosophical reflection on political\nauthority has focused on the obligation to obey. The passive\nobligation of obedience is certainly not all we owe the law (Parekh\n1993: 243; Green 2002: 543\u2013547) but many have taken it to be\nlaw\u2019s minimum demand. This gives rise to a puzzle. As Robert\nPaul Wolff puts it:\n\n\nIf the individual retains his autonomy by reserving to himself in each\ninstance the final decision whether to co-operate, he thereby denies\nthe authority of the state; if, on the other hand, he submits to the\nstate and accepts is claim to authority then \u2026 he loses his\nautonomy. (R. P. Wolff 1970: 9)\n\n\nWolff resolves the dilemma in favour of autonomy, and on that basis\ndefends anarchism.\n\nSome of Wolff\u2019s worries flow from the \u201csurrender of\njudgement\u201d itself\u2014how can it ever be rational to act\nagainst reason as one sees it? Others flow from the fact that it is a\nsurrender to the law. On the first point, it is relevant to\nnotice that promises and contracts also involve surrender of judgement\nand a kind of deference to others (see Soper 2002: 103\u2013139), yet\na rational anarchist needs such voluntary commitments to substitute\nfor authoritative ordering. A principled objection to every surrender\nof judgement is thus self-defeating. Moreover, there seem to be cases\nin which by surrendering judgement on some matters one can secure more\ntime and resources for reflection and decision on things that are more\nimportant, or with respect to which one has greater capacity for\nself-direction. A partial surrender of judgement may therefore enhance\nthe agent\u2019s autonomy overall.\n\nThis suggests that Wolff\u2019s concern is better understood as\nscepticism about whether it is justifiable to surrender one\u2019s\njudgement wholesale to the law. Some philosophers have queried the\nintelligibility of this doubt; they say that it is of the\nnature of law that there is an obligation to obey it, at\nleast in its central case (Fuller 1958 [2000: 100]; Finnis 1979:\n14\u201315). Some go so far as to conclude that it is therefore\nabsurd to ask for any ground of the duty to obey the law: law\nis that which is to be obeyed (McPherson 1967: 64). We need a way into\nthis circle, and the best entrance is in specifying the nature of law\nin away compatible with various theories of its nature. Three features\nare especially important (drawing on Hart 1961 [1994: 193\u2013200];\nRaz 1975 [1990: 149\u2013154]; and Lyons 1984: 66\u201368). First,\nlaw is institutionalized: nothing is law that is not\nconnected with the activities of institutions such as legislatures,\ncourts, administrators, police, etc. Second, legal systems have a\nwide scope. Law not limited to the affairs of small\nface-to-face groups such as families or clans, nor does it only attend\nto a restricted domain of life such as baseball. Law governs\nopen-ended domains of large, loosely structured groups of strangers\nand it regulates their most urgent interests: life, liberty, property,\nkinship, etc. But although law necessarily deals with moral matters,\nit does not necessarily do so well, and this is its third central\nfeature: law is morally fallible. This is acknowledged by\nboth positivists and natural lawyers, whose slogan \u201can unjust\nlaw is not a law\u201d was never intended to assert the infallibility\nof law.\n\nThe question of political obligation, then, turns on whether there is\nare moral reasons to obey the mandatory requirements of a\nwide-ranging, morally fallible, institutionalized authority. This\nobligation purports to be comprehensive in that it covers all legal\nobligations and everyone whose compliance the law requires. It is not\nassumed to bind come what may, though it is to be one genuine\nobligation among others. Some philosophers also consider that it\nshould bind people particularly to their own states, i.e., the states\nof which they are residents or citizens, and that an argument that\ncould not show that one had more stringent duties to obey one\u2019s\nown country than a similarly just foreign one would be in that measure\ndeficient (Simmons 1979: 31\u201335; Green 1988: 227\u2013228).\nFinally, it is common ground the obligation exists only when a\nthreshold condition of justice is met.\n",
