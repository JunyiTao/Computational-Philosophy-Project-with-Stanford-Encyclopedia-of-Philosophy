    "main_text": "Physics\n9. Ethics\n\nPlato inherited from Socrates the conviction that knowledge of\ngoodness has a salvific effect upon human life. That knowledge\nremained elusive to Socrates. As Plato continues the Socratic quest,\nhe expands the scope of the search beyond ethical matters. In the\nPhaedo, as we saw earlier, the character Socrates expresses\nthe conviction that goodness is the true cause (aitia) of the\nbeneficent arrangement of the natural world, though the nature of\ngoodness continues to elude him as well. The causal supremacy of\ngoodness is recognized in the metaphysical and epistemological roles\nassigned to the Republic\u2019s form of the Good, and it is\nthe understanding of that form that constitutes the culmination of the\neducation of the philosophical statesman, the paragon of the virtuous\nand happy person. What remains to be articulated is a conception of\nhow cosmic goodness is manifested in the universe so that human beings\nwill recognize it, understand it, and emulate it in order that their\nlives may become truly virtuous and\n happy.[31]\n\nWe saw above that in its dramatic context, the Timaeus is the\nsecond of a series of three or possibly four (see Critias\n108a\u2013b) speeches exchanged by four or possibly five (see\nTimaeus 17a) friends during one of the yearly Athenian\nPanathenaic festivals. It is sandwiched between Socrates\u2019\nRepublic-like speech, which is briefly summarized at the\nbeginning of the Timaeus (17c\u201319b), and Critias\u2019\nspeech, the unfinished sequel to the\n Timaeus,[32]\n which was intended to recount and celebrate the great victory of\nancient, prehistoric Athens over the vast military might of\n Atlantis.[33]\n The stated thematic purpose of Timaeus\u2019 discourse is to provide\nan account of human nature in the context of the nature of the\nuniverse as a whole. Conjoined with Socrates\u2019 previous account\nof education (\u00e0 la Republic) this account will provide\nthe basis for Critias\u2019 forthcoming account of human virtue in\naction, as displayed by the deeds of the ancient Athenians\n (27a7\u2013b1).[34]\n If we take this stated purpose seriously, we will expect the entire\ncosmological account to culminate in human psychology and ethics. And\nthat is indeed what we find.\n\nIn the passage that may fairly be taken as the climax of\nTimaeus\u2019 discourse (90a2\u2013d7), human beings are urged to\ndevote their utmost attention to the cultivation and preservation of\nthe well being of their immortal, rational souls. The well being of a\nrational soul consists in its being well ordered (eu\nkekosm\u00eamenon, 90c5), and so the goal of human life, given\nthe fact that the soul\u2019s revolutions were thrown off course\naround the time of birth (43a6\u201344b1), is to realign\n(exorthounta, 90d3) those revolutions with those of the\nuniverse at large. Such realignment is achieved by a study of the\nrevolutions and harmonies of the universe and, once achieved, restores\nthe soul to its original condition and thereby brings to fulfillment\n\u201cthat most excellent life offered to humankind by the gods, both\nnow and forevermore\u201d (90d5\u20137).\n",
