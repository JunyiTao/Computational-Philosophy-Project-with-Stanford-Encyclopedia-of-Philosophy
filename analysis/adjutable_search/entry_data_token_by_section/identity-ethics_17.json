    "main_text": "Methodological Alternatives\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nAs should by now be obvious, the relation between personal identity\nand ethics is complex and by no means established, and this is true\nfor several reasons. First, it is still unclear what the correct\ntheory of personal identity is, or even what the right sense of\n\u201cidentity\u201d (reidentification or characterization) is\nthat's to be deployed. Second, there is a question about the priority\nrelation between identity and ethics. In other words, should we\nestablish the true theory of identity before applying it to ethics,\nshould we constrain or construct our theory of identity in light of\nour ethical concerns, or should we try to build up theories of both\nidentity and our ethical concerns in light of one another (via a sort\nof reflective equilibrium)? Third, it is unclear what the precise type\nof relation is that we should expect between identity and ethics,\ni.e., should it be a justificatory relation or an explanatory\nrelation? If the former, how exactly do we bridge the is/ought gap\nbetween descriptive metaphysics and normativity? If the latter, what\nprecisely is to be explained, and how would appeals to identity help?\nFourth, are we right to think of there being the \u2013 a\nsingle \u2013 relation between identity and ethics at all? (See\nD. Shoemaker 2007 and 2016; Schechtman 2014, Ch. 3)\n\n\nThis last point deserves much more discussion than it has previously\nreceived. It has generally been assumed that if there is a relation\nbetween identity and our practical concerns, it is some sort of\nunivocal relation, running from a single (correct) theory of personal\nidentity to all of our person-related practical concerns\n(whether it's a grounding relation, an explanatory relation, a\nrevealed relation, or something else). But why should we think this is\nthe case?  Instead, why not think that some practical concerns are\ngrounded by one relation and other concerns are grounded by\nanother?\n\n\nHere is just one way in which this might be true. My concern about\nanticipation of survival seems to depend on a belief about some future\nperson bearing a certain sort of psychological relation to me.\nAlternatively, what grounds compensation might be a biological\nrelation. The possibility of compensation, after all, may not be\nrestricted to benefits and burdens distributed solely to psychological\ncreatures: As mentioned earlier, I may deserve compensation as an\nadult for what happened to me as a fetus, and this may be\nrendered coherent only with respect to my being a biological human\norganism. Finally, consider moral responsibility. It seems\nplatitudinous that I can be responsible only for my own actions, but\nthis suggests that what's at issue is the  ownership relation\nof moral agents to their actions, i.e., the issue of what makes some\npast action properly attributable to me, a robust Lockean person (see Jaworski and Shoemaker 2018). But\nthis relation may best be grounded by something like a narrative\nconception of personal identity, one that answers to the\ncharacterization question, not the reidentification question.\n\n\nThese sketches suggest the possibility, then, of a  plurality\nof relations between identity and ethics. If so, perhaps the way to\nproceed is to focus on one specific person-related practical concern\nat a time and work out its precise relation to identity (if any)\nbefore moving on to others. While this approach may not diminish the\ncomplexity of the relation(s) between identity and ethics, perhaps it\nwill at least provide the kind of settled views in some limited areas\nwhich we have thus far been missing.\n",
