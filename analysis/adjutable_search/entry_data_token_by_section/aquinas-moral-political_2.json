    "main_text": "Interpretations and method || Is the identification of \u201cman\u2019s last end\u201d foundational for Aquinas?\n1.2 Is the identification of \u201cman\u2019s last end\u201d foundational for Aquinas?\n\nAlong with very many other Thomistic commentators, McInerny and\nO\u2019Callaghan 2005 and Celano 2003 treat Aquinas\u2019 moral\nphilosophy as founded, like his moral theology, upon his determination\nof what felicitas (= perfecta beatitudo and\nAristotle\u2019s eudaimonia) truly is, a determination made\nin the opening quaestiones of the Second Part of his\nSumma Theologiae, where he elaborately argues that complete\nbeatitudo or felicitas consists in an\nuninterruptible vision of God (and, in God, of the other truths we\nnaturally desire to know), something possible for us only in a life\n\u2013 in many respects another life \u2013 after death. But it is\npossible to regard Aquinas\u2019 argument in those\nquaestiones as dictated by the needs of a specifically\ntheological pedagogy, as open to telling objections, and as detachable\nfrom (or at least as methodologically posterior to) the working and\nsound foundations of his moral philosophy and his treatment of\nspecific moral issues \u2013 detachable, that is to say, in a way\nthat Aquinas would not need to regard as inappropriate in the\ndifferent context of today\u2019s discourse. This article will treat\nAquinas\u2019 ethics and political theory as detachable from his\ntheology of life\u2019s ultimate point, and will take seriously his\nemphatic and reiterated thesis that, apart from the divinely given and\nsuper-natural opportunity of perfecta beatitudo (a gift about\nwhich philosophy as such knows nothing), the only ultimate end and\nbeatitudo (fulfillment) for human beings is living in a\ncompletely reasonable, morally excellent (virtuosus) way.\nThat thesis entails that philosophy\u2019s main account of morality\nneed and should contain no claim about what perfect happiness consists\nin.\n\nDespite surface appearances, Aquinas is conscious of Aristotle\u2019s\nfailure to settle whether it is contemplation or political\npraxis that is the essence of human fulfillment. He therefore\nattempts, more intently than Aristotle did in any surviving work, to\nidentify what the first principles of ethics and politics are, and to\ndo so without any premises or presuppositions about a unitary\n\u201clast end of human existence\u201d.\n\nMoreover, when Aquinas does refer to beatitudo as fundamental\nto identifying the principles of practical reason and the natural\n(because reasonable) moral law, he in the same breath emphasizes that\nthis is not to be thought of as the happiness of the deliberating and\nacting individual alone, but rather as the common flourishing\nof the community, ultimately the whole community of humankind:\n\nThe ultimate end of human life is felicitas or\nbeatitudo\u2026 So the main concern of law [including the\nnatural (moral) law] must be with directing towards\nbeatitudo. Again, since every part stands to the whole as\nincomplete stands to complete, and individual human beings are each\nparts of a complete community, law\u2019s appropriate concern is\nnecessarily with directing towards common felicitas \u2026\nthat is, to common good. (ST I-II q. 90 a. 2.)\n\nThe \u201ccomplete community\u201d mentioned here is the political\ncommunity, with its laws, but the proposition implicitly refers also\nto the community of all rational creatures, to whose common good\nmorality (the moral law) directs us.\n1.2.1 Philosophy and theology in Aquinas\u2019 theory of morality and politics\n\nDetaching Aquinas\u2019 philosophy from his theology is compatible\nwith distinctions he firmly delineates at the beginning of his two\nmature theological syntheses, the Summa contra Gentiles and\nthe Summa Theologiae. (i) There are truths, he says, which\nare accessible to natural reason, that is, to ordinary experience\n(including the specialized observations of natural scientists),\ninsight, and reflection; and these include practical truths about good\nand evil, right and wrong. (ii) Many of those truths of natural reason\nare confirmed, and even clarified, by divine revelation, that is, the\npropositions communicated directly or inferentially in the life and\nworks of Christ, as transmitted by his immediate followers and\nprepared for in the Jewish scriptures accepted by those followers as\nrevelatory. (iii) Some of the truths divinely revealed could not have\nbeen discovered by natural, philosophical reason, even though, once\naccepted, their content and significance can be illuminated by the\nphilosophically ordered reflection which he calls theology.\n\nThe philosophical positions in ethics and politics (including law)\nthat are explored in this article belong to categories (i) and (ii).\nThe moral and political norms stated, for example, in the biblical\nDecalogue are, in Aquinas\u2019 view, all knowable independently of\nthat revelation, which confirms and perhaps clarifies them. But the\npropositions that he holds about what the true last end or ultimate\ndestiny of human beings actually is belong to category (iii) and\ncannot be affirmed on any philosophical basis, even though philosophy,\nhe thinks, can demonstrate that they are neither incoherent nor\ncontrary to any proposition which philosophy shows must be\naffirmed.\n",
