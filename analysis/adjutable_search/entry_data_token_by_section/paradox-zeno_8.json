Two More Paradoxes\n\nTwo more paradoxes are attributed to Zeno by Aristotle, but they are\ngiven in the context of other points that he is making, so Zeno\u2019s\nintent cannot be determined with any certainty: even whether they are\nintended to argue against plurality and motion. We will discuss them\nbriefly for completeness.\n",
