    "main_text": "Objections\n4. Objections\n\nThere have been many objections to the indispensability argument,\nincluding Charles Parsons\u2019 (1980) concern that the obviousness\nof basic mathematical statements is left unaccounted for by the\nQuinean picture and Philip Kitcher\u2019s (1984, pp. 104\u2013105)\nworry that the indispensability argument doesn\u2019t explain\nwhy mathematics is indispensable to science. The objections\nthat have received the most attention, however, are those due to\nHartry Field, Penelope Maddy and Elliott Sober. In particular,\nField\u2019s nominalisation program has dominated recent discussions\nof the ontology of mathematics. \n\nField (2016) presents a case for denying the second premise of the\nQuine-Putnam argument. That is, he suggests that despite appearances\nmathematics is not indispensable to science. There are two parts to\nField\u2019s project. The first is to argue that mathematical\ntheories don\u2019t have to be true to be useful in applications,\nthey need merely to be conservative. (This is, roughly, that\nif a mathematical theory is added to a nominalist scientific theory,\nno nominalist consequences follow that wouldn\u2019t follow from the\nnominalist scientific theory alone.) This explains why mathematics\ncan be used in science but it does not explain why it\nis used. The latter is due to the fact that mathematics makes\ncalculation and statement of various theories much simpler. Thus, for\nField, the utility of mathematics is merely pragmatic \u2014\nmathematics is not indispensable after all.\n\nThe second part of Field\u2019s program is to demonstrate that our\nbest scientific theories can be suitably nominalised. That is, he\nattempts to show that we could do without quantification over\nmathematical entities and that what we would be left with would be\nreasonably attractive theories. To this end he is content to\nnominalise a large fragment of Newtonian gravitational theory.\nAlthough this is a far cry from showing that all our current\nbest scientific theories can be nominalised, it is certainly not\ntrivial. The hope is that once one sees how the elimination of\nreference to mathematical entities can be achieved for a typical\nphysical theory, it will seem plausible that the project could be\ncompleted for the rest of\n science.[5]\n\n\nThere has been a great deal of debate over the likelihood of the\nsuccess of Field\u2019s program but few have doubted its\nsignificance. Recently, however, Penelope Maddy, has pointed out that\nif\n P1\n is false, Field\u2019s project may turn out to be irrelevant to the\nrealism/anti-realism debate in mathematics.\n\nMaddy presents some serious objections to the first premise of the\nindispensability argument (Maddy 1992; 1995; 1997). In particular, she\nsuggests that we ought not have ontological commitment to all\nthe entities indispensable to our best scientific theories. Her\nobjections draw attention to problems of reconciling naturalism with\nconfirmational holism. In particular, she points out how a holistic\nview of scientific theories has problems explaining the legitimacy of\ncertain aspects of scientific and mathematical practices. Practices\nwhich, presumably, ought to be legitimate given the high regard for\nscientific practice that naturalism recommends. It is important to\nappreciate that her objections, for the most part, are concerned with\nmethodological consequences of accepting the Quinean doctrines of\nnaturalism and holism \u2014 the doctrines used to support the first\npremise. The first premise is thus called into question by undermining\nits support.\n\nMaddy\u2019s first objection to the indispensability argument is that\nthe actual attitudes of working scientists towards the components of\nwell-confirmed theories vary from belief, through tolerance, to\noutright rejection (Maddy 1992, p. 280). The point is that naturalism\ncounsels us to respect the methods of working scientists, and yet\nholism is apparently telling us that working scientists ought not have\nsuch differential support to the entities in their theories. Maddy\nsuggests that we should side with naturalism and not holism here. Thus\nwe should endorse the attitudes of working scientists who apparently\ndo not believe in all the entities posited by our best\ntheories. We should thus reject\n P1.\n\nThe next problem follows from the first. Once one rejects the picture\nof scientific theories as homogeneous units, the question arises\nwhether the mathematical portions of theories fall within the true\nelements of the confirmed theories or within the idealized elements.\nMaddy suggests the latter. Her reason for this is that scientists\nthemselves do not seem to take the indispensable application of a\nmathematical theory to be an indication of the truth of the\nmathematics in question. For example, the false assumption that water\nis infinitely deep is often invoked in the analysis of water waves, or\nthe assumption that matter is continuous is commonly made in fluid\ndynamics (Maddy 1992, pp. 281\u2013282). Such cases indicate that\nscientists will invoke whatever mathematics is required to get the job\ndone, without regard to the truth of the mathematical theory in\nquestion (Maddy 1995, p. 255). Again it seems that confirmational\nholism is in conflict with actual scientific practice, and hence with\nnaturalism. And again Maddy sides with naturalism. (See also Parsons\n(1983) for some related worries about Quinean holism.) The point here\nis that if naturalism counsels us to side with the attitudes of\nworking scientists on such matters, then it seems that we ought not\ntake the indispensability of some mathematical theory in a physical\napplication as an indication of the truth of the mathematical theory.\nFurthermore, since we have no reason to believe that the mathematical\ntheory in question is true, we have no reason to believe that the\nentities posited by the (mathematical) theory are real. So once again\nwe ought to reject\n P1.\n\nMaddy\u2019s third objection is that it is hard to make sense of what\nworking mathematicians are doing when they try to settle independent\nquestions. These are questions, that are independent of the standard\naxioms of set theory \u2014 the ZFC\n axioms.[6]\n In order to settle some of these questions, new axiom candidates have\nbeen proposed to supplement ZFC, and arguments have been advanced in\nsupport of these candidates. The problem is that the arguments\nadvanced seem to have nothing to do with applications in physical\nscience: they are typically intra-mathematical arguments. According to\nindispensability theory, however, the new axioms should be assessed on\nhow well they cohere with our current best scientific theories. That\nis, set theorists should be assessing the new axiom candidates with\none eye on the latest developments in physics. Given that set\ntheorists do not do this, confirmational holism again seems to be\nadvocating a revision of standard mathematical practice, and this too,\nclaims Maddy, is at odds with naturalism (Maddy 1992, pp.\n286\u2013289).\n\nAlthough Maddy does not formulate this objection in a way that\ndirectly conflicts with\n P1\n it certainly illustrates a tension between naturalism and\nconfirmational\n holism.[7]\n And since both these are required to support P1, the objection\nindirectly casts doubt on P1. Maddy, however, endorses naturalism and\nso takes the objection to demonstrate that confirmational holism is\nfalse. We\u2019ll leave the discussion of the impact the rejection of\nconfirmational holism would have on the indispensability argument\nuntil after we outline Sober\u2019s objection, because Sober arrives\nat much the same conclusion.\n\nElliott Sober\u2019s objection is closely related to Maddy\u2019s\nsecond and third objections. Sober (1993) takes issue with the claim\nthat mathematical theories share the empirical support accrued by our\nbest scientific theories. In essence, he argues that mathematical\ntheories are not being tested in the same way as the clearly empirical\ntheories of science. He points out that hypotheses are confirmed\nrelative to competing hypotheses. Thus if mathematics is confirmed\nalong with our best empirical hypotheses (as indispensability theory\nclaims), there must be mathematics-free competitors. But Sober points\nout that all scientific theories employ a common mathematical\ncore. Thus, since there are no competing hypotheses, it is a mistake\nto think that mathematics receives confirmational support from\nempirical evidence in the way other scientific hypotheses do.\n\nThis in itself does not constitute an objection to\n P1\n of the indispensability argument, as Sober is quick to point out\n(Sober 1993, p. 53), although it does constitute an objection to\nQuine\u2019s overall view that mathematics is part of empirical\nscience. As with Maddy\u2019s third objection, it gives us some cause\nto reject confirmational holism. The impact of these objections on P1\ndepends on how crucial you think confirmational holism is to that\npremise. Certainly much of the intuitive appeal of P1 is eroded if\nconfirmational holism is rejected. In any case, to subscribe to the\nconclusion of the indispensability argument in the face of\nSober\u2019s or Maddy\u2019s objections is to hold the position that\nit\u2019s permissible at least to have ontological commitment to\nentities that receive no empirical support. This, if not outright\nuntenable, is certainly not in the spirit of the original Quine-Putnam\nargument.\n",
