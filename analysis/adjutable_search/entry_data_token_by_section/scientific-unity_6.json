    "main_text": "Epistemological Unities || Antireductionism\n3.2 Antireductionism\n\nSince the 1930s, the focus was on a syntactic approach, with physics\nas the paradigm of science, deductive logical relations as the form of\ncognitive or epistemic goals such as explanation and prediction, and\ntheory and empirical laws as paradigmatic units of scientific\nknowledge (Suppe 1977; Gr\u00fcnbaum and Salmon 1988). The historicist\nturn in the 1960s, the semantic turn in philosophy of science in the\n1970s and a renewed interest in special sciences has changed this\nfocus. The very structure of hierarchy of levels has lost its\ncredibility, even for those who believe in it as a model of autonomy\nof levels rather than as an image of fundamentalism. The rejection of\nsuch models and their emendations have occupied the last four decades\nof philosophical discussion about unity in and of the sciences\n(especially in connection to psychology and biology, and more recently\nchemistry). A valuable consequence has been the strengthening of\nphilosophical projects and communities devoting more sustained and\nsophisticated attention to special sciences, different from\nphysics.\n\nThe first target of antireductionist attacks has been Nagel\u2019s\ndemand of extensional equivalence. It has been dismissed as an\ninadequate demand of \u201cmeaning invariance\u201d and\napproximation, and with it the possibility of deductive connections.\nMocking the positivist legacy of progress through unity, empiricism\nand anti-dogmatism, these constraints have been decried as\nintellectually dogmatic, conceptually weak and methodologically overly\nrestrictive (Feyerabend 1962). The emphasis is placed, instead, on the\nmerits of the new theses of incommensurability and methodological\npluralism.\n\nA similar criticism of reduction involves a different move: that the\ndeductive connection be guaranteed provided that the old, reduced\ntheory was \u201ccorrected\u201d beforehand (Shaffner 1967). The\nevolution and the structure of scientific knowledge could be neatly\ncaptured, using Schaffner\u2019s expression, by \u201clayer-cake\nreduction\u201d. The terms \u201clength\u201d and\n\u201cmass\u201d\u2014or the symbols \\(l\\) and \\(m\\)\u2014for\ninstance, may be the same in Newtonian and relativistic mechanics, or\nthe term \u201celectron\u201d the same in classical physics and\nquantum mechanics, or the term \u201catom\u201d the same in quantum\nmechanics and in chemistry, or \u201cgene\u201d in Mendelian\ngenetics and molecular genetics (see, for instance, Kitcher 1984). But\nthe corresponding concepts, it is argued, are not. Concepts or words\nare to be understood as getting their content or meaning within a\nholistic or organic structure, even if the organized wholes are the\ntheories that include them. From this point of view, different wholes,\nwhether theories or Kuhnian paradigms, manifest degrees of conceptual\nincommensurability. As a result, the derived, reducing theories\ntypically are not the allegedly reduced, older ones; and their\nderivation sheds no relevant insight into the relation between the\noriginal, older one and the new (Feyerabend 1962; Sklar 1967).\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, the positivist model collapsed the\ndistinction between synchronic and diachronic reduction, that is,\nbetween reductive models of the structure and the evolution, or\nsuccession, of scientific theories. By contrast, historicism, as\nembraced by Kuhn and Feyerabend, drove a wedge between the two\ndimensions and rejected the linear model of scientific change in terms\nof accumulation and replacement. For Kuhn, replacement becomes partly\ncontinuous, partly non-cumulative change in which one world\u2014or,\nless literally, one world-picture, one paradigm\u2014replaces another\n(after a revolutionary episode of crisis and proliferation of\nalternative contenders) (Kuhn 1962). This image constitutes a form of\npluralism, and, like the reductionism it is meant to replace,\nit can be either synchronic or diachronic. Here is\nwhere Kuhn and Feyerabend parted ways. For Kuhn, synchronic pluralism\nonly describes the situation of crisis and revolution between\nparadigms. For Feyerabend, history is less monistic, and pluralism is\nand should remain a synchronic and diachronic feature of science and\nculture (Feyerabend, here, thought science and society inseparable,\nand followed Mill\u2019s philosophy of liberal individualism and\ndemocracy).\n\nA different kind of antireductionism addresses a more conceptual\ndimension, the problem of categorial reduction:\nMeta-theoretical categories of description and interpretation for\nmathematical formalisms, e.g., criteria of causality, may block full\nreduction. Basic interpretative concepts that are not just variables\nin a theory or model are not reducible to counterparts in fundamental\ndescriptions (Cat 2000; the case of individuality in quantum physics\nhas been discussed in Healey 1991; Redhead and Teller 1991; Auyang\n1995; and, in psychology, in Block 2003).\n3.3 Epistemic roles: From demarcation to explanation and evidence. Varieties of connective unity. Aesthetic value\n\nUnity has been considered an epistemic virtue and goal, with different\nmodes of unification associated with roles such as demarcation,\nexplanation and evidence. It can also be traced to synthetic cognitive\ntasks of categorization and reasoning\u2014also applied in the\nsciences\u2014especially through relations of similarity and\ndifference (Cat 2022b).\n\nDemarcation. Certain models of unity, which we may call\ncontainer models, attempt to demarcate science from non-science. The\ncriteria adopted are typically methodological and normative, not\ndescriptive. Unlike connective models, they serve a dual function of\ndrawing up and policing a boundary that (1) encloses and endorses the\nsciences and (2) excludes other practices. As noted above, some\ndemarcation projects have aimed to distinguish between natural and\nspecial sciences. The more notorious ones, however, have aimed to\nexclude practices and doctrines dismissed under the labels of\nmetaphysics, pseudo-science or popular knowledge. Empirical or not,\nthe applications of standards of epistemic purity are not merely\nidentification or labeling exercises for the sake of carving out\nscientific inquiry as a natural kind or mapping out intellectual\nlandscapes. The purpose is to establish authority and the stakes\ninvolve educational, legal and financial interests. Recent\ncontroversies include not just the teaching of creation science, but\nalso polemics over the scientific status of, for instance, homeopathy,\nvaccination and models of plant neurology and climate change.\n\nThe most influential demarcation criterion has been Popper\u2019s\noriginal anti-metaphysics barrier: the condition of empirical\nfalsifiability of scientific statements. It required the logically\npossible relation to basic statements, linked to experience, that can\nprove general hypotheses to be false with certainty. For this purpose,\nhe defended the application of a particular deductive argument, the\nmodus tollens (Popper 1935/1951). Another demarcation\ncriterion is explanatory unity, empirically grounded. Hempel\u2019s\ndeductive-nomological model characterizes the scientific explanation\nof events as a logical argument that expresses their expectability in\nterms of their subsumption under an empirically testable\ngeneralization. Explanations in the historical sciences too must fit\nthe model if they are to count as scientific. They could then be\nbrought into the fold as bona fide scientific explanations even if\nthey could qualify only as explanation sketches.\n\nSince their introduction, Hempel\u2019s model and its weaker versions\nhave been challenged as neither generally applicable nor appropriate.\nThe demarcation criterion of unity is undermined by criteria of\ndemarcation between natural and historical sciences. For instance,\nhistorical explanations have a genealogical or narrative form, or else\nthey require the historian\u2019s engaging problems or issuing a\nconceptual judgment that brings together meaningfully a set of\nhistorical facts (recent versions of such decades-old arguments are in\nCleland 2002, Koster 2009, Wise 2011). According to more radical\nviews, natural sciences such as geology and biology are historical in\ntheir contextual, causal and narrative forms; as well, Hempel\u2019s\nmodel, especially the requirement of empirically testable strict\nuniversal laws, is satisfied by neither the physical sciences nor the\nhistorical sciences, including archeology and biology (Ereshefsky\n1992).\n\nA number of legal decisions have appealed to Popper\u2019s and\nHempel\u2019s criteria, adding the epistemic role of peer review,\npublication and consensus around the sound application of\nmethodological standards. A more recent criterion has sought a\ndifferent kind of demarcation: it is comparative rather than absolute;\nit aims to compare science and popular science; it adopts a broader\nnotion of the German tradition of Wissenschaften, that is,\nroughly of scholarly fields of research that include formal sciences,\nnatural sciences, human sciences and the humanities; and it emphasizes\nthe role of systematicity, with an emphasis on different forms of\nepistemic connectedness as weak forms of coherence and order\n(Hoyningen-Huene 2013).\n\nExplanation. Unity has been defended in the wake of authors\nsuch as Kant and Whewell as an epistemic criterion of explanation or\nat least fulfilling an explanatory role. In other words, rather than\nmodeling unification in terms of explanation, explanation is modeled\nin terms of unification. A number of proposals introduce an\nexplanatory measure in terms of the number of independent explanatory\nlaws or phenomena conjoined in a theoretical structure. On this\nrepresentation, unity contributes understanding and confirmation from\nthe fewest basic kinds of phenomena, regardless of explanatory power\nin terms of derivation or argument patterns (Friedman 1974; Kitcher\n1981; Kitcher 1989; Wayne 1996; within a probabilistic framework,\nMyrvold 2003; Sober 2003; Roche and Sober 2017; see below).\n\nA weaker position argues that unification is not explanation on the\ngrounds that unification is simply systematization of old beliefs and\noperates as a criterion of theory-choice (Halonen and Hintikka\n1999).\n\nThe unification account of explanation has been defended within a more\ndetailed cognitive and pragmatist approach. The key is to think of\nexplanations as question\u2013answer episodes involving four\nelements: the explanation-seeking question about \\(P, P\\)?, the\ncognitive state \\(C\\) of the questioner/agent for whom \\(P\\) calls for\nexplanation, the answer \\(A\\), and the cognitive state \\(C+A\\) in\nwhich the need for explanation of \\(P\\) has disappeared. A related\naccount models unity in the cognitive state in terms of the\ncomparative increase of coherence and elimination of spurious\nunity\u2014such as circularity or redundancy (Schurz 1999).\nUnification is also based on information-theoretic transfer or\ninference relations. Unification of hypotheses is only a virtue if it\nunifies data. The last two conditions imply that unification yields\nalso empirical confirmation. Explanations are global increases in\nunification in the cognitive state of the cognitive agent (Schurz\n1999; Schurz and Lambert 1994).\n\nThe unification\u2013explanation link can be defended on the grounds\nthat laws make unifying similarity expectable (hence\nHempel-explanatory), and this similarity becomes the content of a new\nbelief (Weber and Van Dyck 2002 contra Halonen and Hintikka 1999).\nUnification is not the mere systematization of old beliefs. Contra\nSchurz, they argue that scientific explanation is provided by novel\nunderstanding of facts and the satisfaction of our curiosity (Weber\nand Van Dyck 2002 contra Schurz 1999). In this sense, causal\nexplanations, for instance, are genuinely explanatory and do not\nrequire an increase of unification.\n\nA contextualist and pluralist account argues that understanding is a\nlegitimate aim of science that is pragmatic and not necessarily\nformal, or a subjective psychological by-product of explanation (De\nRegt and Dieks 2005). In this view explanatory understanding is\nvariable and can have diverse forms, such as causal-mechanical and\nunification, without conflict (De Regt and Dieks 2005). In the same\nspirit, Salmon linked unification to the epistemic virtue or goal of\nexplanation and distinguished between unification and\ncausal-mechanical explanation as forms of scientific explanatory\nunderstanding (Salmon 1998).\n\nExplanation may also provide unification of different fields of\nresearch through explanatory dependence so that one uses the\nother\u2019s results to explain one\u2019s own (Kincaid 1997).\n\nThe views on scientific explanation have evolved away from the formal\nand cognitive accounts of the epistemic categories. Accordingly, the\nsource of understanding provided by scientific explanations has been\nmisidentified according to some (Barnes 1992). The genuine source for\nimportant, but not all, cases lies in causal explanation or causal\nmechanism (Cartwright 1983; Cartwright 1989; see also Glennan 1996;\nCraver 2007). Mechanistic models of explanation have become entrenched\nin philosophical accounts of the life sciences (Darden 2006; Craven\n2007). As an epistemic virtue, the role of unification has been traced\nto the causal form of the explanation, for instance, in statistical\nregularities (Schurz 2015). The challenge extends to the alleged\nextensional link between explanation on the one hand, and truth and\nuniversality on the other (Cartwright 1983; Dupr\u00e9 1993;\nWoodward 2003). In this sense, explanatory unity, which rests on\nmetaphysical assumptions about components and their properties, also\ninvolves a form of ontological or metaphysical unity. (For a\nmethodological criticism of external, metaphysical perspectives, see\nRuphy 2016.)\n\nSimilar criticisms extend to the traditionally formalist arguments in\nphysics about fundamental levels; there, unification fails to yield\nexplanation in the formal scheme based on laws and their symmetries.\nUnification and explanation conflict on the grounds that in biology\nand physics only causal mechanical explanations answering\nwhy-questions yield understanding of the connections that contribute\nto \u201ctrue unification\u201d (Morrison\n 2000;[2]\n Morrison\u2019s choice of standard for evaluating the epistemic\naccounts of unity and explanation and her focus on systematic\ntheoretical connections without reduction has not been without\ncritics, e.g., Wayne 2002; Plutynski 2005; Karaca\n 2012).[3]\n\nMethodology. Unity has long been understood as a\nmethodological principle, primarily, but not exclusively, in\nreductionist versions (e.g., for the case of biology, see Wimsatt\n1976, 2006). This is different from the case of unity through\nmethodological prescriptions. One methodological criterion appeals to\nthe epistemic virtues of simplicity or parsimony, whether\nepistemological or ontological (Sober 2003). As a formal probabilistic\nprinciple of curve-fitting or average predictive accuracy, the\nrelevance of unity is objective. Unity plays the role of an empirical\nbackground theory.\n\nThe methodological role of unification may track scientific progress.\nUnlike in the case of the explanatory role of unification presented\nabove, this account of progress and interdisciplinarity relies on a\nunifying role of explanation: as in evo-devo in biology, unification\nis a process of advancement in which two fields of research are in the\nprocess of unification through mutual explanatory relevance, that is,\nwhen results in one field are required to pose and address questions\nin the other, raising explananda and explanations (Nathan 2017).\n\nHeuristic dependence involves one influencing, accommodating,\ncontributing to and addressing the other\u2019s research questions\n(for examples relating chemistry and physics see Cat and Best\n2023).\n\nEvidence. As in the relation of unification to explanation,\nunification is considered an epistemic criterion of evidence in\nsupport of the unified account (for a non-probabilistic account of the\nrelation between unification and confirmation, see Schurz 1999). The\nresulting evidence and demonstration may be called synthetic evidence\nand demonstration. Synthetic evidence may be the outcome of synthetic\nmodes of reasoning that rely on assumptions of similarity and\ndifference, for instance in cases of robustness, cross-checking and\nmeta-analysis (Cat 2022b).\n\nLike probabilistic models of explanation, recent formal discussions of\nunity and coherence within the framework of Bayesianism place unity in\nevidentiary reasoning (Forster and Sober 1994, sect. 7; Schurz and\nLambert 2005 is also a formal model, with an algebraic approach). More\ngenerally, the probabilistic framework articulates formal\ncharacterizations of unity and introduces its role in evaluations of\nevidence.\n\nA criterion of unity defended for its epistemic virtue in relation to\nevidence is simplicity or parsimony (Sober 2013, 2016). Comparatively\nspeaking, simpler hypotheses, models or theories present a higher\nlikelihood of truth, empirical support and accurate prediction. From a\nmethodological standpoint, however, appeals to parsimony might not be\nsufficient. Moreover, the connection between unity as parsimony and\nlikelihood is not interest-relative, at least in the way that the\nconnection between unity and explanation is (Sober 2003; Forster and\nSober 1994; Sober 2013, 2016).\n\nOn the Bayesian approach, the rational comparison and acceptance of\nprobabilistic beliefs in the light of empirical data is constrained by\nBayes\u2019 Theorem for conditional probabilities (where \\(h\\) and\n\\(d\\) are the hypothesis and the data respectively): \n\\[ \\P(h \\mid d) = \\frac{\\P(d \\mid h) \\cdot \\P(h)}{P(d)} \\]\n\n\nOne explicit Bayesian account of unification as an epistemic,\nmethodological virtue, has introduced the following measure of unity:\na hypothesis \\(h\\) unifies phenomena \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) to the degree\nthat given \\(h, p\\) is statistically/probabilistically relevant to (or\ncorrelated with) \\(q\\) (Myrvold 2003; for a probabilistically\nequivalent measure of unity in Bayesian terms see McGrew 2003; on the\nequivalence, Schupbach 2005). This measure of unity has been\ncriticized as neither necessary nor sufficient (Lange 2004;\nLange\u2019s criticism assumes the unification\u2013explanation\nlink; in a rebuttal, Schupbach 2005 rejects this and other assumptions\nbehind Lange\u2019s criticism). In a recent development, Myrvold\nargues for mutual information unification, i.e., that hypotheses are\nsaid to be supported by their ability to increase the amount of what\nhe calls the mutual information of the set of evidence statements (see\nMyrvold 2017). The explanatory unification contributed by hypotheses\nabout common causes is an instance of the information condition.\n\nEvidentiary unification may contribute to the unification of different\nfields of research in the form of evidentiary dependence: Evidentiary\ndependence involves the appeal to the other\u2019s results in the\nevaluation of one\u2019s own (Kincaid 1997).\n\nAesthetic value. Finally, epistemic values of unity may rely\non subsidiary considerations of aesthetic value. Nevertheless,\nconsideration of beauty, elegance or harmony may also provide\nautonomous grounds for adopting or pursuing varieties of unification\nin terms of simplicity and patterns of order (regularity of specific\nrelations) (McAllister 1996; Glynn 2010; Orrell 2012). Whether\naesthetic judgments have any epistemic import depends on metaphysical,\ncognitive or pragmatic assumptions.\n\nUnification without reduction. Reduction is not the sole\nstandard of unity, and models of unification without reduction have\nproliferated. In addition, such models introduce new units of\nanalysis. An early influential account centers around the notion of\ninterfield theories (Darden and Maull 1977; Darden 2006). The\northodox central place of theories as the unit of scientific knowledge\nis replaced by that of fields. Examples of such fields are genetics,\nbiochemistry and cytology. Different levels of organization correspond\nin this view to different fields: Fields are individuated\nintellectually by a focal problem, a domain of facts related to the\nproblem, explanatory goals, methods and a vocabulary. Fields import\nand transform terms and concepts from others. The model is based on\nthe idea that theories and disciplines do not match neat levels of\norganization within a hierarchy; rather, many of them in their scope\nand development cut across different such levels. Reduction is a\nrelation between theories within a field, not across fields.\n\nInterdependence and hybridity. In general, the higher-level\ntheories (for instance, cell physiology) and the lower-level theories\n(for instance, biochemistry) are ontologically and epistemologically\ninterdependent on matters of informational content and evidential\nrelevance; one cannot be developed without the other (Kincaid 1996;\nKincaid 1997; Wimsatt 1976; Spector 1977). The interaction between\nfields (through researchers\u2019 judgments and borrowings) may\nprovide enabling conditions for subsequent interactions. For instance,\nMaxwell\u2019s adoption of statistical techniques in color research\nenabled the introduction of similar ideas from social statistics in\nhis research on reductive molecular theories of gases. The reduction,\nin turn, enabled experimental evidence from chemistry and acoustics;\nsimilarly, different chemical and spectroscopic bases for colors\nprovided chemical evidence in color research (Cat 2014).\n\nThe emergence and development of hybrid disciplines and theories is\nanother instance of non-reductive cooperation or interaction between\nsciences. Noted above is the post-war emergence of interdisciplinary\nareas of research: the so-called hyphenated sciences such as\nneuro-acoustics, radioastronomy, biophysics, etc. (Klein 1990, Galison\n1997) On a smaller scale, in the domain of, for instance, physics, one\ncan find semiclassical models in quantum physics or models developed\naround phenomena where the limiting reduction relations are singular\nor catastrophic, such as caustic optics and quantum chaos (Cat 1998;\nBatterman 2002; Belot 2005). Such semiclassical explanatory models\nhave not found successful quantum substitutes and have placed\nstructural explanations at the heart of the relation between classical\nand quantum physics (Bokulich 2008). The general form of pervasive\ncases of emergence has been characterized with the notion of\ncontextual emergence (Bishop and Atmanspacher 2006) where\nproperties, behaviors and their laws on a restricted, lower-level,\nsingle-scale domain are necessary but not sufficient for the\nproperties and behaviors of another, e.g., higher-level one, not even\nof itself. The latter are also determined by contingent contexts\n(contingent features of the state space of the relevant system). The\ninterstitial formation of more or less stable small-scale syntheses\nand cross-boundary \u201calliances\u201d has been common in most\nsciences since the early twentieth century. Indeed, it is crucial to\ndevelopment in model building and growing empirical relevance in\nfields ranging anywhere from biochemistry to cell ecology, or from\neconophysics to thermodynamical cosmology. Similar cases can be found\nin chemistry and the biomedical sciences.\n\nConceptual unity. The conceptual dimension of cross-cutting\nhas been developed in connection with the possibility of cross-cutting\nnatural kinds that challenges taxonomical monism. Categories of\ntaxonomy and domains of description are interest-relative, as are\nrationality and objectivity (Khalidi 1998; his view shares positions\nand attitudes with Longino 1989; Elgin 1996, 1997). Cross-cutting\ntaxonomic systems, then, are not conceptually inconsistent or\ninapplicable. Both the interest-relativity and hybridity feature\nprominently in the context of ontological pluralism (see below).\n\nAnother, more general, unifying element of this kind is Holton\u2019s\nnotion of themata. Themata are conceptual values that are a\npriori yet contingent (both individual and social). They are forming\nand organizing presuppositions that factor centrally in the evolution\nof the science and include continuity/discontinuity, harmony,\nquantification, symmetry, conservation, mechanicism and hierarchy\n(Holton 1973). Unity of some kind is itself a thematic element. A more\ncomplex and comprehensive unit of organized scientific practice is the\nnotion of the various styles of reasoning, such as\nstatistical, analogical modeling, taxonomical, genetic/genealogical or\nlaboratory styles; each is a cluster of epistemic standards,\nquestions, tools, ontology, and self-authenticating or stabilizing\nprotocols (Hacking 1996; see below for the relevance of this account\nof a priori elements to claims of global disunity\u2014the account\nshares distinctive features of Kuhn\u2019s notion of paradigm).\n\nAnother model of non-reductive unification is historical and\ndiachronic: it emphasizes the genealogical and historical identity of\ndisciplines, which has become complex through interaction. The\ninteraction extends to relations between specific sciences, philosophy\nand philosophy of science (Hull 1988). Hull has endorsed an image of\nscience as a process, modeling historical unity after a\nDarwinian-style pattern of evolution (developing an earlier suggestion\nby Popper). Part of the account is the idea of disciplines as\nevolutionary historical individuals, which can be revised with the\nhelp of more recent ideas of biological individuality: hybrid unity\nas an external model of unity as integration or coordination of\nindividual disciplines and disciplinary projects, e.g., characterized\nby a form of occurrence, evolution or development whose tracking and\nidentification involves a conjunction with other disciplines, projects\nand domains of resources, from within science or outside science.\nThis diachronic perspective can accommodate models of discovery, in\nwhich genealogical unity integrates a variety of resources that can be\nboth theoretical and applied, or scientific and non-scientific (an\nexample, from physics, the discovery of superconductivity, can be\nfound in Holton, Chang and Jurkowitz 1996). Some models of unity below\nprovide further examples.\n\nA generalization of the notion of interfield theories is the idea that\nunity is interconnection: Fields are unified theoretically\nand practically (Grantham 2004). This is an extension of the original\nmodes of unity or identity that single out individual disciplines.\nTheoretical unification involves conceptual, ontological and\nexplanatory relations. Practical unification involves heuristic\ndependence, confirmational dependence and methodological integration.\nThe social dimension of the epistemology of scientific disciplines\nrelies on institutional unity. With regard to disciplines as\nprofessions, this kind of unity has rested on institutional\narrangements such as professional organizations for\nself-identification and self-regulation, university mechanisms of\ngrowth and reproduction through certification, funding and training,\nand communication and record through journals.\n\nMany examples of unity without reduction are local rather than global.\nThese are not merely a phase in a global and linear project or\ntradition of unification (or integration), and they are typically\nfocused on science as a human activity. From that standpoint,\nunification is typically understood or advocated as a piecemeal\ndescription and strategy of collaboration (see Klein 1990 on the\ndistinction between global integration and local interdisciplinarity).\nCases are restricted to specific models, phenomena or situations.\n\nMaterial unity. A more recent approach to the connection\nbetween different research areas has focused on a material level of\nscientific practice, with attention to the use of instruments and\nother material objects (Galison 1997; Bowker and Star 1999). For\ninstance, the material unity of natural philosophy in the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries relied on the circulation,\ntransformation and application of objects in their concrete and\nabstract representations (Bertoloni-Meli 2006). The latter correspond\nto the imaginary systems and their representations, which we call\nmodels. The evolution of objects and images across different theories\nand experiments and their developments in nineteenth-century natural\nphilosophy provide a historical model of scientific development, but\nthe approach is not meant to illustrate reductive materialism, since\nthe same objects and models work and are perceived as vehicles for\nabstract ideas, institutions, cultures, etc., or are prompted by them.\nOn one view, objects are regarded as elements in so-called trading\nzones (see below) with shifting meanings in the evolution of\ntwentieth-century physics, such as with the cloud chamber which was\nfirst relevant to meteorology and next to particle physics (Galison\n1997). Alternatively, material objects have been given the status of\nboundary objects, which provide the opportunity for experts\nfrom different fields to collaborate through their respective\nunderstandings of the system in question and their respective goals\n(Bowker and Star 1999).\n\nGraphic unity. At the concrete perceptual level, recent\naccounts emphasize the role of visual representations in the sciences\nand suggest what may be called graphic unification of the\nsciences. Their cognitive roles, methodological and rhetorical,\ninclude establishing and disseminating facts and their so-called\nvirtual witnessing, revealing empirical relations, testing their fit\nwith available patterns of more abstract theoretical relations\n(theoretical integration), suggesting new ones, aiding in\ncomputations, serving as aesthetic devices etc. But these uses are not\nhomogeneous across different sciences and make visible disciplinary\ndifferences. We may equally speak of graphic pluralism. The\nrates in the use of diagrams in research publications appear to vary\nalong the hard\u2013soft axis of pyramidal hierarchy, from physics,\nchemistry, biology, psychology, economics and sociology, and political\nscience (Smith et al. 2000). The highest use can be found in physics,\nintuitively identified by the highest degree of hardness understood as\nconsensus, codification, theoretical integration and factual\nstability, to the highest interpretive and instability of results.\nSimilarly, the same variation occurs among sub-disciplines within each\ndiscipline. The kinds of images and their contents also vary across\ndisciplines and within disciplines, ranging from hand-made images of\nparticular specimens to hand-made or mechanically generated images of\nparticulars standing in for types, to schematic images of geometric\npatterns in space or time, or to abstract diagrams representing\nquantitative relations. Importantly, graphic tools circulate like\nother cognitive tools between areas of research that they in turn\nconnect (Galison 1997; Daston and Galison 2007; Lopes 2009; see also\nLynch and Woolgar 1990; Baigrie 1996; Jones and Galison 1998; Galison\n1997; Cat 2014; Kaiser 2005).\n\nDisciplinary unity and collaboration. The relation between\ndisciplines or fields of research has often been tracked by relations\nbetween their respective theories or epistemic products. But\ndisciplines constitute broader and richer units of analysis of\nconnections in the sciences characterized, for instance, by their\ndomain of inquiry, cognitive tools and social structure (Bechtel\n1987).\n\nUnification of disciplines, in that sense, has been variously\ncategorized, for instance, as interdisciplinary,\nmultidisciplinary, crossdisciplinary or\ntransdisciplinary (Klein 1990; Graff 2005; Kellert 2008;\nRepko 2012). It might involve a researcher borrowing from different\ndisciplines or the collaboration of different researchers. Neither\nmodality of connection amounts to a straightforward generalization of,\nor reduction to, any single discipline, theory, etc. In either case,\nthe strategic development is typically defended for its heuristic\nproblem-solving or innovative powers, as it is prompted by a problem\nthat is considered complex in that it does not arise or cannot be\nfully treated within the purview of one specific discipline unified or\nindividuated around some potentially non-unique set of elements such\nas scope of empirical phenomena, rules, standards, techniques,\nconceptual and material tools, aims, social institutions, etc.\nIndicators of disciplinary unity may vary (Kuhn 1962; Klein 1990;\nKellert 2008). Interdisciplinary research or collaboration\ncreates a new discipline or project, such as interfield research,\noften leaving the existence of the original ones intact.\nMultidisciplinary work involves the juxtaposition of the\ntreatments and aims of the different disciplines involved in\naddressing a common problem. Crossdisciplinary work involves\nborrowing resources from one discipline to serve the aims of a project\nin another. Transdisciplinary work is a synthetic creation\nthat encompasses work from different disciplines (Klein 1990; Kellert\n2008; Brigandt 2010; Hoffmann, Schmidt and Nersessian 2012; Osbeck et\nal. 2011; Repko 2012). These different modes of synthesis or\nconnection are not mutually exclusive.\n\nModels of interdisciplinary cooperation and their corresponding\noutcomes are often described using metaphors of different kinds:\ncartographic (domains, boundaries, trading zone, etc.),\nlinguistic (pidgin language, communication, translation,\netc.), architectural (building blocks, tiles, etc.),\nsocio-political (imperialism, hierarchy, republic,\norchestration, negotiation, coordination, cooperation, etc.) or\nembodied (cross-training). Each selectively highlights and\nneglects different aspects of scientific practice and properties of\nscientific products. Cartographic and architectural images, for\ninstance, focus on spatial and static synchronic relations and simply\nconnected, compatible elements. Socio-political and embodied images\nemphasize activity and non-propositional elements (Kellert 2008\ndefends the image of cross-training).\n\nIn this context, methodological unity often takes the form of\nborrowing standards and techniques for the application of formal and\nempirical methods. They range from calculational techniques and tools\nfor theoretical modeling and simulation of phenomena to techniques for\nmodeling of data, using instruments and conducting experiments (e.g.,\nthe culture of field experiments and, more recently, randomized\ncontrol trials across natural and social sciences). A key element of\nscientific practice, often ignored by philosophical analysis, is\nexpertise. As part of different forms of methodological unity, it is\nkey to the acceptance and successful appropriation of techniques.\nRecent accounts of multidisciplinary collaboration as a human activity\nhave focused on the dynamics of integrating different kinds of\nexpertise around common systems or goals of research (Collins and\nEvans 2007; Gorman 2002). The same perspective can accommodate the\nrecent interest in so-called mixed methods, e.g., different forms of\nintegration of quantitative and qualitative methods and approaches in\nthe social sciences (but mixed-method approaches do not typically\ninvolve mixed disciplines).\n\nAs teamwork and collaboration within and between research units has\nsteadily increased, so has the degree of specialization (Wutchy et al.\n2007). Between both trends, new reconfigurations keep forming with\ndifferent purposes and types of institutional expression and support;\nfor example, STEM, Earth sciences, physical sciences, mind\u2013brain\nsciences, etc., in addition to hybrid fields mentioned above. Yet,\nin educational research and funding, disciplinarity has acquired\nnew normative purchase in opposite directions: while funding agencies\nand universities promote interdisciplinarity, university\nadministrations encourage both disciplinary competition and more\nversatile adisciplinarity (Griffiths 2022). In the face of defenses of\ndifferent forms of interdisciplinarity (Graff 2015), there is also a\nrenewed attention to the critical value of autonomy of disciplines, or\ndisciplinarity, as the key resource in division of labor and\ncollaboration alike (Jacobs 2013).\n\nThe social epistemology of interdisciplinarity is complex. It develops\nboth top-down from managers and bottom-up from practitioners\n(M\u00e4ki 2016; M\u00e4ki and MacLeod 2016), relying on a variety of\nkinds of interactions with heuristic and normative dimensions\n(Boyer-Kassem et al. 2018). More generally, collaborative work\narguably provides epistemic, ethical and instrumental advantages,\ne.g., more comprehensive relevant understanding of complex problems,\nexpanded justice to interests of direct knowledge users and increased\nresources (Laursen et al. 2021). Yet, collaboration relies on a\nplurality of values or norms that may lead to conflicts such as a\nparalyzing practical incoherence of guiding values and moral\nincoherence and problematic forms of oppression (Laursen et al.\n2021; see more on the limits of pluralism below).\n\nEmpirical work in sociology and cognitive psychology on scientific\ncollaboration has led to a broader perspective, including a number of\ndimensions of interdisciplinary cooperation involving identification\nof conflicts and the setting of sufficient so-called common ground\nintegrators. These include shared (pre-existing, revised and newly\ndeveloped) concepts, terminology, standards, techniques, aims,\ninformation, tools, expertise, skills (abstract, dialectical, creative\nand holistic thinking), cognitive and social ethos (curiosity,\ntolerance, flexibility, humility, receptivity, reflexivity, honesty,\nteam-play) social interaction, institutional structures and\ngeography (Cummings and Kiesler 2005; Klein 1990; Kockelmans 1979;\nRepko 2012). Sociological studies of scientific collaboration can in\nprinciple place the connective models of unity within the more general\nscope of social epistemology, for instance, in relation to\ndistributive cognition (beyond the focus on strategies of consensus\nwithin communities).\n\nThe broad and dynamical approach to processes of interdisciplinary\nintegration may effectively be understood to describe the production\nof different sorts and degrees of epistemic emergence. The integrated\naccounts require shared (old or new) assumptions and may involve a\ncase of ontological integration, for instance in causal models.\nSuggested kinds of interdisciplinary causal-model integration are the\nfollowing: sequential causal order in a process or mechanism cutting\nacross disciplinary divides; horizontal parallel integration of\ndifferent causal models of different elements of a complex phenomenon;\nhorizontal joint causal model of the same effect; and vertical or\ncross-level causal integration (see emergent or top-down causality,\nbelow) (Repko 2012; Kockelmans 1979).\n\nThe study of the social epistemology of interdisciplinary and\ncollaborative research has been carried out and proposed from\ndifferent perspectives that illuminate different dimensions and\nimplications. These include historical typology (Klein 1990), formal\nmodeling (Boyer-Kassem et al. 2018), ethnography (Nersessian 2022),\nethical, scientometrics and multidimensional philosophical\nperspectives (M\u00e4ki 2016). Other approaches aim to design and\noffer tools that facilitate collaboration such as the Toolbox Dialogue\nInitiative (Hubbs et al. 2020). The different forms of plurality and\nconnection also ultimately inform the organization of science in the\nsocial and political terms of diversity and democracy (Longino 1998,\n2001). In terms of cooperation and coordination, unity, in this sense,\ncannot be reduced to consensus (Rescher 1993; van Bouwel 2009a; Repko\n2012; Hoffmann, Schmidt and Nersessian 2012.)\n\nA general model of local interconnection, which has acquired\nwidespread attention and application in different sciences, is the\nanthropological model of trading zone, where hybrid languages\nand meanings are developed that allow for interaction without\nstraightforward extension of any party\u2019s original language or\nframework (Galison 1997). Galison has applied this kind of\nanthropological analysis to the subcultures of experimentation. This\nstrategy aims to explain the strength, coherence and continuity of\nscience in terms of local coordinations of intercalated\nlevels of symbolic procedures and meanings, instruments and\narguments.\n\nAt the experimental level, instruments, as found objects, acquire new\nmeanings, developments and uses as they bridge over the transitions\nbetween theories, observations or theory-laden observations.\nInstruments and experimental projects in the case of Big Science also\nbring together, synchronically and interactively, the skills,\nstandards and other resources from different communities, and they\nchange each in turn (on interdisciplinary experimentation see also\nOsbeck et al. 2011). Patterns of laboratory research are shared by\nthe different sciences, including not just instruments but the general\nstrategies of reconfiguration of human researchers and the natural\nentities researched (Knorr-Cetina 1992). This includes statistical\nstandards (e.g., statistical significance) and ideals of\nreplication. At the same time, attention has been paid to the\ndifferent ways in which experimental approaches differ among the\nsciences (Knorr-Cetina 1992; Guala 2005; Weber 2005) as well as to how\nthey have been transferred (e.g., field experiments and randomized\ncontrol trials) or integrated (e.g., mixed methods combining\nquantitative and qualitative techniques).\n\nInterdisciplinary research has been claimed to revolve shared boundary\nobjects (Gorman 2002) and to yield evidentiary and heuristic\nintegration through cooperation (Kincaid 1997). Successful\ninterdisciplinary research, however, does not seem to require\nintegration, e.g., evolutionary game theory in economics and biology\n(Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff 2016). Heuristic cooperation has also led to new\nstable disciplines through stronger integrative forms of problem\nsolving. In the life sciences, for instance, computational,\nmathematical and engineering techniques for modeling and data\ncollection in molecular biology have led to integrative systems\nbiology (MacLeod and Nersessian 2016; Nersessian 2022). Similarly,\nconstraints and resources for problem-solving in physics, chemistry\nand biology led to the development of quantum chemistry (Gavroglu and\nSim\u00f5es 2012; see also the case of nuclear chemistry in Cat and\nBest 2023).\n4. Ontological unities\n4.1 Ontological unities and reduction\n\nSince Nagel\u2019s influential model of reduction by derivation, most\ndiscussions of the unity of science have been cast in terms of\nreductions between concepts and the entities they describe, and\nbetween theories incorporating the descriptive concepts. Ontological\nunity is expressed by a preferred set of such ontological units. In\nthis regard, it should be noted that the selection of units typically\nrelies on assumptions about classification or natural order such as\ncommitments to natural kinds or a hierarchy of levels.\n\nIn terms of concepts featured in preferred descriptions, explanatory\nor not, reduction endorses taxonomical monism: a privileged set of\nfundamental kinds of things. These privileged kinds are often known as\nso-called natural kinds; although, as it has been argued, monism does\nnot entail realism (Slater 2005) and the notion admits of multiple\ninterpretations, ranging from the more conventionalist to the more\nessentialist (Tahko 2021; see a critique in Cat 2022a). Natural\nkindness has further been debated in terms, for instance, of the\ncontrast between so-called cluster and causal theories. Connectedly,\npluralism does not entail anti-realism (Dupr\u00e9 1993), nor does\nrealism entail monism or essentialism (Khalidi 2021). Without\nadditional metaphysical assumptions, the fundamental units are\nambiguous with respect to their status as either entity or property.\nReduction may determine the fundamental kinds or level through the\nanalysis of entities.\n\nA distinctive ontological model is as follows. The hierarchy of levels\nof reduction is fixed by part-whole relations. The levels of\naggregation of entities run all the way down to atomic particles and\nfield parts, rendering microphysics the fundamental science (Gillett\n2016). The focus of recent accounts has been placed on the relation\nbetween the causal powers at different levels and how lower-level\nentities and powers determine higher-level ones. Discussions have\ncentered on whether the relation is of identity between types or\ntokens of things (Thalos 2013; Gillette 2016; Wilson 2021; see more\nbelow) or even if causal powers are the relevant unit of analysis\n(Thalos 2013).\n\nA classic reference to this compositional type of account is Oppenheim\nand Putnam\u2019s \u201cThe Unity of Science as a Working\nHypothesis\u201d (Oppenheim and Putnam 1958; Oppenheim and Hempel had\nworked in the 1930s on taxonomy and typology, a question of broad\nintellectual, social and political relevance in Germany at the time).\nOppenheim and Putnam intended to articulate an idea of science as a\nreductive unity of concepts and laws reduced to those of the most\nelementary elements. They also defended it as an empirical\nhypothesis\u2014not an a priori ideal, project or\nprecondition\u2014about science. Moreover, they claimed that its\nevolution manifested a trend in that unified direction out of the\nsmallest entities and lowest levels of aggregation. In an important\nsense, the evolution of science recapitulates, in the reverse, the\nevolution of matter, from aggregates of elementary particles to the\nformation of complex organisms and species (we find a similar\nassumption in Weinberg\u2019s downward arrow of explanation). Unity,\nthen, is manifested not just in mereological form, but also\ndiachronically, genealogically or historically.\n\nA weaker form of ontological reduction advocated for the biomedical\nsciences with the causal notion of partial reductions:\nexplanations of localized scope (focused on parts of higher-level\nsystems only) laying out a causal mechanism connecting different\nlevels in the hierarchy of composition and organization (Schaffner\n1993; Schaffner 2006; Scerri has similarly discussed degrees of\nreduction in Scerri 1994). An extensional, domain-relative approach\nintroduces the distinction between \u201cdomain preserving\u201d and\n\u201cdomain combining\u201d reductions. Domain-preserving\nreductions are intra-level reductions and occur between \\(T_1\\) and\nits predecessor \\(T_2\\). In this parlance, however, \\(T_2\\)\n\u201creduces\u201d to \\(T_1\\). This notion of\n\u201creduction\u201d does not refer to any relation of explanation\n(Nickles 1973).\n\nThe claim that reduction, as a relation of explanation, needs to be a\nrelation between theories or even involve any theory has also been\nchallenged. One such challenge focuses on \u201cinter-level\u201d\nexplanations in the form of compositional redescription and\ncausal mechanisms (Wimsatt 1976). The role of biconditionals or even\nSchaffner-type identities, as factual relations, is heuristic (Wimsatt\n1976). The heuristic value extends to the preservation of the\nhigher-level, reduced concepts, especially for cognitive and pragmatic\nreasons, including reasons of empirical evidence. This amounts to\nrejecting the structural, formal approach to unity and reductionism\nfavored by the logical-positivist tradition. Reductionism is another\nexample of the functional, purposive nature of scientific practice.\nThe metaphysical view that follows is a pragmatic and non-eliminative\nrealism (Wimsatt 2006). As a heuristic, this kind of non-eliminative\npragmatic reductionism is a complex stance. It is, across levels,\nintegrative and intransitive, compositional, mechanistic and\nfunctionally localized, approximative and abstractive. It is bound to\nadopting false idealizations, focusing on regularities and stable\ncommon behavior, circumstances and properties. It is also constrained\nin its rational calculations and methods, tool-binding and\nproblem-relative. The heuristic value of eliminative, inter-level\nreductions has been defended as well (Poirier 2006).\n\nThe appeal to formal laws and deductive relations is dropped for sets\nof concepts or vocabularies in the replacement analysis\n(Spector 1978). This approach allows for talk of entity reduction or\nbranch reduction, and even direct theory replacement, without the\noperation of laws, and it circumvents vexing difficulties raised by\nbridge principles and the deductive derivability condition\n(self-reduction, infinite regress, etc.). Formal relations only\nguarantee, but do not define, the reduction relation. Replacement\nfunctions are meta-linguistic statements. As Sellars argued in the\ncase of explanation, this account distinguishes between reduction and\nthe testing for reduction, and it highlights the role of derivations\nin both. Finally, replacement can be in practice or in theory.\nReplacement in practice does not advocate elimination of the reduced\nor replaced entities or concepts (Spector 1978).\n\nAs indicated above, reductive models and associated organization of\nscientific theories and disciplines assume an epistemic hierarchy\ngrounded on an ontological hierarchy of levels of organization of\nentities, properties or phenomena, from societies down to cells,\nmolecules and subatomic elements. Patterns of behavior of entities at\nlower, more fundamental levels are considered more general, stable and\nexplanatory.\n\nLevels forming a hierarchy are discrete and stratified so that\nentities at level n strongly depend on entities at level \\(n-1.\\) The\ndifferent levels may be distinguished in different ways: by\ndifferences in scale, by a relation of realization and, especially, by\na relation of composition such that entities at level n are considered\ncomposed of, or decomposable into, entities at level \\(n-1.\\)\n\nThis assumption has been the target of criticism (Thalos 2013;\nPotochnik 2017). Neither scales, realization nor decomposition can fix\nan absolute hierarchy of levels. Critics have noted, for instance,\nthat entities may participate in causal interactions at multiple\nlevels and across levels in physical models (Thalos 2013) and\nacross biological and neurobiological models (Haug 2010; Eronen\n2013).\n\nIn addition, the compartmentalization of theories and their concepts\nor vocabulary into levels neglects the existence of empirically\nmeaningful and causally explanatory relations between entities or\nproperties at different levels. If they are neglected as theoretical\nknowledge and left as only bridge principles, the possibility of\ncompleteness of knowledge is jeopardized. Maximizing completeness of\nknowledge requires a descriptive unity of all phenomena at all levels\nand anything between these levels. Any bounded region or body of\nknowledge neglecting such cross-boundary interactions is radically\nincomplete, and not just confirmationally or evidentially so; we may\nrefer to this problem as the problem of cross-boundary\nincompleteness at either intra-level or horizontal\nincompleteness and, on a hierarchy, the problem of inter-level or\nvertical incompleteness (Kincaid 1997; Cat 1998).\n\nIf levels cannot track, for instance, same-level causal relations,\neither their causal explanatory relevance is derivative and contextual\n(Craver 2007), their role is cognitive and pragmatic as in the role as\nconceptual coordinate systems or, more radically, altogether\ndispensable (Thalos 2013; Potochnik 2017). As a result, they fail to\nfix a corresponding hierarchy of fields and subfields of scientific\nresearch defended by reductionist accounts.\n\nThe most radical form of reduction as replacement is often called\neliminativism. The position has made a considerable impact in\nphilosophy of psychology and philosophy of mind (Churchland 1981;\nChurchland 1986). On this view the vocabulary of the reducing theories\n(neurobiology) eliminates and replaces that of the reduced ones\n(psychology), leaving no substantive relation between them (which is\nonly a replacement rule) (see also\n eliminative materialism).\n\nFrom a semantic standpoint, one may distinguish different kinds of\nreduction in terms of four criteria, two epistemological and two\nontological: fundamentalism, approximation, abstract hierarchy and\nspatial hierarchy. Fundamentalism implies that the features\nof a system can be explained in terms only of factors and rules from\nanother realm. Abstract hierarchy is the assumption that the\nrepresentation of a system involves a hierarchy of levels of\norganization with the explanatory factors being located at the lower\nlevels. Spatial hierarchy is a special case of abstract\nhierarchy in which the criterion of hierarchical relation is a spatial\npart-whole or containment relation. Strong reduction satisfies the\nthree \u201csubstantive\u201d criteria, whereas weak reduction only\nsatisfies fundamentalism. Approximate reductions\u2014strong and\nhierarchical\u2014are those which satisfy the criterion of\nfundamentalism only approximately (Sarkar 1998; the merit of\nSarkar\u2019s proposal resides in its systematic attention to\nhierarchical conditions and, more originally, to different conditions\nof approximation; see also Ramsey 1995; Lange 1995).\n\nThe semantic turn extends to more recent notion of models that do not\nfall under the strict semantic or model-theoretic notion of\nmathematical structures (Giere 1999; Morgan and Morrison 1999). This\nis a more flexible framework about relevant formal relations and the\nscope of relevant empirical situations. It is implicitly or explicitly\nadopted by most accounts of unity without reduction. One may add the\nprimacy of temporal representation and temporal parts, temporal\nhierarchy or temporal compositionality, first emphasized\nby Oppenheim and Putnam as a model of genealogical or diachronic\nunity. This framework applies to processes both of evolution and\ndevelopment (a more recent version is in McGivern 2008 and in Love and\nH\u00fctteman 2011).\n\nThe shift in the accounts of scientific theory from syntactic to\nsemantic approaches has changed conceptual perspectives and,\naccordingly, formulations and evaluations of reductive relations and\nreductionism. However, examples of the semantic approach focusing on\nmathematical structures and satisfaction of set-theoretic relations\nhave focused on syntactic features\u2014including the axiomatic form\nof a theory\u2014in the discussion of reduction (Sarkar 1998; da\nCosta and French 2003). In this sense, the structuralist approach can\nbe construed as a neo-Nagelian account, while an alternative line of\nresearch has championed the more traditional structuralist semantic\napproach (Balzer and Moulines 1996; Moulines 2006; Ruttkamp 2000;\nRuttkamp and Heidema 2005).\n4.2 Ontological unities and antireductionism\n\nFrom the opposite direction, arguments concerning new concepts such as\nmultiple realizability and supervenience, introduced\nby Putnam, Kim, Fodor and others, have led to talk of higher-level\nfunctionalism, a distinction between type-type and token-token\nreductions and the examination of its implications. The concepts of\nemergence, supervenience and downward causation are related\nmetaphysical tools for generating and evaluating proposals about unity\nand reduction in the sciences. This literature has enjoyed its chief\nsources and developments in general metaphysics and in philosophy of\nmind and psychology (Davidson 1969; Putnam 1975; Fodor 1975; Kim\n1993).\n\nSupervenience, first introduced by Davidson in discussions of\nmental properties, is the notion that a system with properties on one\nlevel is composed of entities on a lower level and that its properties\nare determined by the properties of the lower-level entities or\nstates. The relation of determination is that no changes at the\nhigher-level occur without changes at the lower level. Like\ntoken-reductionism, supervenience has been adopted by many as the poor\nman\u2019s reductionism (see the entry on\n supervenience).\n A different case for the autonomy of the macrolevel is based on the\nnotion of multiple supervenience (Kincaid 1997; Meyering 2000).\n\nThe autonomy of the special sciences from physics has been defended in\nterms of a distinction between type-physicalism and\ntoken-physicalism (Fodor 1974; Fodor countered Oppenheim and\nPutnam\u2019s hypothesis under the rubric \u201cthe disunity of\nscience\u201d; see the entry on\n physicalism).\n The key logical assumption is the type-token distinction, whereby\ntypes are realized by more specific tokens, e.g., the type\n\u201canimal\u201d is instantiated by different species, the type\n\u201ctiger\u201d or \u201celectron\u201d can be instantiated by\nmultiple individual token tigers and electrons. Type-physicalism is\ncharacterized by a type-type identity between the\npredicates/properties in the laws of the special sciences and those of\nphysics. By contrast, token-physicalism is based on the token-token\nidentity between the predicates/properties of the special sciences and\nthose of physics; every event under a special law falls under a law of\nphysics and bridge laws express contingent token-identities between\nevents. Token-physicalism operates as a demarcation criterion for\nmaterialism. Fodor argued that the predicates of the special sciences\ncorrespond to infinite or open-ended disjunctions of physical\npredicates, and these disjunctions do not constitute natural kinds\nidentified by an associated law. Token-physicalism is the only\nalternative. All special kinds of events are physical, but the special\nsciences are not physics (for criticisms based on the presuppositions\nin Fodor\u2019s argument, see Sober 1999).\n\nThe denial of remedial, weaker forms of reductionism is the basis for\nthe concept of emergence (Humphreys 1997; Bedau and Humphreys\n2008; Wilson 2021). Different accounts have attempted to articulate\nthe idea of a whole being different from or more than the mere sum of\nits parts (see the entry on\n emergent properties).\n Emergence has been described beyond logical relations, synchronically\nas an ontological property and diachronically as a material process of\nfusion, in which the powers of the separate constituents lose their\nseparate existence and effects (Humphreys 1997). This concept has been\nwidely applied in discussions of complexity. Unlike the\nearliest antireductionist models of complexity in terms of holism and\ncybernetic properties, more recent approaches track the role of\nconstituent parts (Simon 1996). Weak emergence has been opposed to\nnominal and strong forms of emergence. The nominal kind simply\nrepresents that some macro-properties cannot be properties of\nmicro-constituents. The strong form is based on supervenience and\nirreducibility, with a role for the occurrence of autonomous downwards\ncausation upon any constituents (see below). Weak emergence is linked\nto processes stemming from the states and powers of constituents, with\na reductive notion of downwards causation of the system as a resultant\nof constituents\u2019 effects (Wilson 2021); however, the connection\nis not a matter of Nagelian formal derivation, but of so-called\nuniversality classes (Batterman 2002; Thalos 2013), self-organization\n(Mitchell 2012) and implementation through computational aggregation,\ncompression and iteration. Weak emergence, then, can be defined in\nterms of simulation: a macro-property, state or fact is weakly\nemergent if and only if it can be derived from its macro-constituents\nonly by simulation (Bedau and Humphreys 2008) The denial of remedial,\nweaker forms of reductionism is the basis for the concept of\nemergence (Humphreys 1997; Bedau 2008); see the entry on\n simulations in science).\n\nComputational models of emergence or complexity straddle the boundary\nbetween formal epistemology and ontology. They are based on\nsimulations of chaotic dynamical processes such as cellular automata\n(Wolfram 1984, 2002). Their supposed superiority to combinatorial\nmodels based on aggregative functions of parts of wholes does not lack\ndefenders (Crutchfield 1994; Crutchfield and Hanson 1997; Humphreys\n2004, 2007, 2008; Humphreys and Huneman 2008; Huneman 2008a, 2008b,\n2010).\n\nConnected to the concept of emergence is top-down or\ndownward causation, which captures the autonomous and genuine\ncausal power of higher-level entities or states, especially upon\nlower-level ones. The most extreme and most controversial version\nincludes a violation of laws that regulate the lower level (Meehl and\nSellars 1956; Campbell 1974). Weaker forms require compatibility with\nthe microlaws (for a brief survey and discussion see Robinson 2005; on\ndownward causation without top-down causes, see Craver and Bechtel\n2007; Bishop 2012). The very concept has become the subject of some\ninterdisciplinary interest in the sciences (Ellis, Noble and\nO\u2019Connor 2012).\n\nAnother general argument for the autonomy of the macrolevel in the\nform of non-reductive materialism has been a cognitive type of\nfunctionalism, namely, cognitive pragmatism (Van Gulick 1992). This\naccount links ontology to epistemology. It discusses four pragmatic\ndimensions of representations: the nature of the causal interaction\nbetween theory-user and the theory, the nature of the goals to the\nrealization of which the theory can contribute, the role of indexical\nelements in fixing representational content, and differences in the\nindividuating principles applied by the theory to its types (Wimsatt\nand Spector\u2019s arguments above are of this kind). A more\nontologically substantive account of functional reduction is\nRamsey\u2019s bottom-up construction by reduction:\ntransformation reductions streamline formulations of theories in such\na way that they extend basic theories upwards by engineering their\napplication to specific context or phenomena. As a consequence, they\nreveal, by construction, new relations and systems that are\nantecedently absent from a scientist\u2019s understanding of the\ntheory\u2014independently of a top or reduced theory (Ramsey 1995). A\nweaker framework of ontological unification is categorial\nunity, wherein abstract categories such as causality,\ninformation, etc., are attached to the interpretation of the specific\nvariables and properties in models of phenomena.\n5. Disunity and pluralism\n\nA more radical departure from logical-positivist standards of unity is\nthe recent criticism of the methodological values of reductionism and\nunification in the sciences and also its position in culture and\nsociety. From the descriptive standpoint, many views under the\nrubric of disunity are versions of positions mentioned above. The\ndifference is mainly normative and a matter of emphasis, scope and\nperspective. Such views reject global or universal standards of\nunity\u2014including unity of method\u2014by emphasizing disunity\nand endorsing different forms of epistemological and ontological\npluralism.\n5.1 The Stanford School\n\nAn influential picture of disunity comes from related works by members\nof the so-called Stanford School such as John Dupr\u00e9, Ian\nHacking, Peter Galison, Patrick Suppes and Nancy Cartwright. Disunity\nis, in general terms, a rejection of universalism and uniformity, both\nmethodological and metaphysical. Through their work, the rubric of\ndisunity has acquired a visibility parallel to the one once acquired\nby unity, as an inspiring philosophical rallying cry.\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, members of the school have\ndefended, from analysis of actual scientific practice, a model of\nlocal unity such as the so-called trading-zone, (Galison 1998), a\nplurality of scientific methods (Suppes 1978), a plurality of\nscientific styles with the function of establishing spaces of\nepistemic possibility and a plurality of kinds of unities (Hacking\n1996; Hacking follows the historian A.A. Crombie; for a criticism of\nHacking\u2019s historical epistemology see Kusch 2010).\n\nFrom a metaphysical point of view, the disunity of science can be\ngiven adequate metaphysical foundations that make pluralism compatible\nwith realism (Dupr\u00e9 1993; Cartwright 1983, 1999). Dupr\u00e9\nopposes a mechanistic paradigm of unity characterized by determinism,\nreductionism and essentialism. The paradigm spreads the values and\nmethods of physics to other sciences that he thinks are scientifically\nand socially deleterious. Disunity appears characterized by three\npluralistic theses: against essentialism\u2014there is always a\nplurality of classifications of reality into kinds; against\nreductionism\u2014there exists equal reality and causal efficacy of\nsystems at different levels of description (that is, the microlevel is\nnot causally complete, leaving room for downward causation); and\nagainst epistemological monism\u2014there is no single methodology\nthat supports a single criterion of scientificity, nor a universal\ndomain of its applicability, leaving only a plurality of epistemic and\nnon-epistemic virtues. The unitary concept of science should be\nunderstood, following the later Wittgenstein, as a family-resemblance\nconcept. (For a criticism of Dupr\u00e9\u2019s ideas, see Mitchell\n2003; Sklar 2003.)\n\nAgainst the universalism of explanatory laws, Cartwright has argued\nthat laws cannot be both universal and exactly true, as Hempel\nrequired in his influential account of explanation and demarcation;\nthere exist only patchworks of laws and local cooperation. Like\nDupr\u00e9, Cartwright adopts a kind of scientific realism but\ndenies that there is a universal order, whether represented by a\ntheory of everything or a corresponding a priori metaphysical\nprinciple (Cartwright 1983). Theories apply only locally, where and to\nthe extent that their interpretive models fit the phenomena studied,\nceteris paribus (Cartwright 1999). Cartwright\u2019s\npluralism is not just opposed to vertical reductionism but also\nhorizontal imperialism, or universalism and globalism. She explains\ntheir more or less general domain of application in terms of causal\ncapacities and arrangements she calls nomological machines\n(Cartwright 1989, 1999). The regularities they bring about depend on a\nshielded environment. As a matter of empiricism, this is the reason\nthat it is in the controlled environment of laboratories and\nexperiments, where causal interference is shielded off, that factual\nregularities are manifested. The controlled, stable, regular world is\nan engineered world. Representation rests on intervention (cf. Hacking\n1983; for criticisms see Winsberg et al. 2000; Hoefer 2003; Sklar\n2003; Howhy 2003; Teller 2004; McArthur 2006; Ruphy 2016).\n\nDisunity and autonomy of levels have been associated, conversely, with\nantirealism, meaning instrumentalist or empiricist heuristics. This\nincludes, for Fodor and Rosenberg, higher-level sciences such as\nbiology and sociology (Fodor 1974; Rosenberg 1994; Huneman 2010). It\nis against this picture that Dupr\u00e9\u2019s and\nCartwright\u2019s attacks on uniformly global unity and reductionism,\nabove, might seem surprising by including an endorsement, in causal\nterms, of\n realism.[4]\n Rohrlich has defended a similar realist position about weaker,\nconceptual (cognitive) antireductionism, although on the grounds of\nthe mathematical success of derivational explanatory reductions\n(Rohrlich 2001). Ruphy, however, has argued that antireductionism\nmerely amounts to a general methodological prescription and is too\nweak to yield uncontroversial metaphysical lessons; these are in fact\nbased on general metaphysical commitments external to scientific\npractice (Ruphy 2005, 2016).\n5.2 Pluralism\n\nUnlike more descriptive accounts of plurality, pluralism is a\nnormative endorsement of plurality. The question of the metaphysical\nsignificance of disunity and anti-reductionism takes one straight to\nthe larger issue of the epistemology and metaphysics (and aesthetics,\nsocial culture and politics) of pluralism. And here one encounters the\nfamiliar issues and notions such as conceptual schemes, frameworks and\nworldviews, incommensurability, relativism, contextualism and\nperspectivalism about goals and standards of concepts and methods (for\na general discussion see Lynch 1998; on perspectivalism about\nscientific models see Giere 1999, 2006; Rueger 2005; Massimi and McCoy\n2020).\n\nIn connection with relativism and instrumentalism, pluralism has\ntypically been associated with antirealism about taxonomical\npractices. But it has been defended from the standpoint of realism\n(for instance, Dupr\u00e9 1993; Chakravartty 2011). Pluralism about\nknowledge of mind-independent facts can be formulated in terms of\ndifferent ways to distribute properties (sociability-based pluralism),\nwith more specific commitments about the ontological status of the\nrelated elements and their plural contextual manifestations of powers\nor dispositions (Chakravartty 2011; Cartwright 2007).\n\nFrom a more epistemological standpoint, pluralism applies widely to\nconcepts, explanations, virtues, goals, methods, models and kinds of\nrepresentations (see above for graphic pluralism), etc. In this sense,\npluralism has been defended as a general framework that rejects the\nideal of consensus in cognitive, evaluative and practical matters,\nagainst pure skepticism (nothing goes) or indifferentism (anything\ngoes), including a defense of preferential and contextual rationality\nthat notes the role of contextual rational commitments, by analogy\nwith political forms of engagement (Rescher 1993; van Bouwel 2009a;\nCat 2012).\n\nConsider at least four distinctions\u2014they are formulated\nabout concepts, facts, and descriptions, and they apply also to\nvalues, virtues, methods, etc.:\n\nVertical vs. horizontal pluralism. Vertical pluralism is\ninter-level pluralism, the view that there is more than one level of\nfactual description or kind of fact and that each is irreducible,\nequally fundamental, or ontologically/conceptually autonomous.\nHorizontal pluralism is intra-level pluralism, the view that there may\nbe incompatible descriptions or facts on the same level of discourse\n(Lynch 1998). For instance, the plurality of explanatory causes to be\nchosen from or integrated in biology or physics has been defended as a\nlesson in pluralism (Sober 1999).\nGlobal vs. local pluralism. Global pluralism is pluralism\nabout every type of fact or description. Global horizontal pluralism\nis the view that there may be incompatible descriptions of the same\ntype of fact. Global vertical pluralism is the view that no type of\nfact or description reduces to any other. Local horizontal and\nvertical pluralism is about one type of fact or description (Lynch\n1998). It may also concern situated standpoints informed by, among\nothers, social differences (Wylie 2015).\nDifference vs. integrative pluralism. Difference\npluralism has been defended in terms of division of labor in the face\nof complexity and cognitive limitations (Giere 2006), epistemic\nhumility (Feyerabend 1962 and his final writings in the 1990s; Chang\n2002), scientific freedom, empirical testability and theory choice\n(Popper 1935; Feyerabend 1962) and underdetermination.\n\n\nUnderdetermination arguments concern choices from a disjunction of\nequivalent types of descriptions (Mitchell 2003, 2009) or of\nincompatible partial representations or models of phenomena in the\nsame intended scope (Longino 2002, 2013). The representational\nincompatibility may be traced to competing values or aims, or\nassumptions in ceteris paribus laws.\n\nCritiques of difference pluralism point to different consequences such\nas failure to address complex and boundary phenomena and problems\nin, for instance, the life and social sciences (Gorman 2002;\nMitchell 2003; 2008); detrimental effects of taxonomic instability\n(Sullivan 2017) and so-called intraconcept variability (Cunningham\n2021) in the mind-brain sciences. When the variability characterizes\nwhat are taken to be the same concepts and terminology, several\ncontexts of detrimental effect have been identified: (1) science\neducation, (2) collaborative research, intra- and cross-disciplinary\n(e.g., the practical and moral problems of value conflicts mentioned\nabove), (3) clinical practice, and (4) metascientific research\n(Cunningham 2021).\n\nIntegrative, or connective, types of pluralism are the conjunctive or\nholistic requirement of different types of descriptions, methods or\nperspectives (Mitchell 2003, 2009; contrast with the more isolationist\nposition in Longino 2002 and her essay in Kellert, Longino and Waters\n2006; Longino 2013).\n\nTo a merely syncretistic or tolerant, non-interactive pluralism, a\nrecent body of literature has opposed a dynamic, coordinated,\ninteractive disciplinary kind of pluralism (Chang 2012; Wylie 2015;\nSullivan 2017). The former requires only respectful division of labor;\nthe latter may involve either a limited cross-fertilization through\ncommunication and assimilation\u2014borrowing or co-optation\u2014or\na more robust, integrative epistemic engagement. The latter may\ninvolve, for instance, communicative expertise\u2014also known as\ninteractional expertise\u2014without having contributory expertise\nin the other practice, exchange and collaboration on the same\nproject.\n\nBorrowing and cross-fertilization across divides and over distances\nconcern more than theories and change the respective practices,\nprocesses and products. They extend to data, concepts, models,\nmethods, evidence, heuristic techniques, technology and other\nresources. To mention one distinction, while theoretical integration\nconcerns concepts, ontology, explanations, models, etc., practical\nintegration concerns methods, heuristics and testing (Grantham 2004).\nThus, accounts including different versions of taxonomical pluralism\nrange from the more conventional and contingent (from Elgin 1997 to\nastronomical kinds in Ruphy 2016) and the more grounded in contexts of\npractices (categorization work in Bowker and Star 1999; life sciences\nand chemistry in Kendig 2016) and the interactive (Hacking\u2019s\ninteractive kinds in the human sciences) to the more metaphysically\nsubstantive. Some methodological prescriptions of pluralism rely on\npluralism in metascientific research including history (Chang\n2012).\n\nConnective varieties of pluralism have been endorsed on grounds of\ntheir epistemic value. Considerations of empirical adequacy and\npredictive power can be traced back to Neurath, the explanatory and\nmethodological value of cross-fertilization, the epistemic benefits of\na stance of openness to new kinds of facts and ways of inquiry and\nlearning (Wylie 2015) and evidential value.\n\nFrom the standpoint of evidence, we find second-order varieties of\nmixed evidence patterns\u2014triangulation, security and\nintegration\u2014that connect different kinds of evidence to provide\nenhanced evidential value. The relevant plurality or difference\nrequires independence, a condition to be explicated in different ways\n(Kuorikoski and Marchionni 2022). Regarding triangulation, enhanced\nevidence results from multiple theory-laden but theoretically\nindependent lines of evidence in, for instance, microscopy (Hacking\n1983), archeology (Wylie 1999) and interdisciplinary research in the\nsocial sciences, for example, neuroeconomics in support of existence\nclaims about phenomena and descriptions of phenomena but not to more\ngeneral theories about them (Kuorikoski and Marchionni 2016).\n\nConnective forms of pluralism have been modeled in terms of relations\nbetween disciplines (see above) and defended at the level of social\nepistemology by analogy with political models of liberal democracy and\nas a model of social governance between the extremes of so-called\nconsensual mainstreaming and antagonistic exclusivism (van Bouwel\n2009a). Through dialogue, a plurality of represented perspectives\nenables the kind of critical scrutiny of questions and knowledge\nclaims that exposes error, bias, unexamined norms of justification and\nacceptance and the complexity of issues and relevant implications. As\na result, it has been argued, pluralism supports a corresponding\nstandard of critical objectivity (Longino 2002; Wylie 2015).\n\nInternal vs. external pluralism. From a methodological\nstandpoint, an internal perspective is naturalistic in its reliance on\nthe contingent plurality of scientific practice by any of its\nstandards. This has been defended by members of the so-called\nMinnesota School (Kellert, Longino and Waters 2006) and Ruphy (2016).\nThe alternative, which Ruphy has attributed to Dupr\u00e9 and\nCartwright, is the adoption of a metaphysical commitment external to\nactual scientific practice.\n\n\nAs a matter of actual practice, pluralism has been identified as part\nof a plurality of projects and perspectives in, for instance,\ncognitive and mind-brain sciences, where attitudes towards a plurality\nof ways of researching and understanding cognition vary (Milkowski and\nHohol 2021). These attitudes include (1) lamenting the variability of\nmeaning and systems of classification (Sullivan 2007; Cunningham\n2021); (2) embracing complementarity between hierarchical mechanistic\nand computational approaches\u2014in the face of, for instance,\nmodels with propositional declarative and lawlike statements and\ncomputational models with software codes; (3) seeking integration with\nmutual consistency and evidential support; (4) seeking reduction\nprivileging neural models; and (5) seeking grand unification that\nvalues simplicity and generality over testability.\n5.3 Metapluralism\n\nThe preference for one kind of pluralism over another is typically\nmotivated by epistemic virtues or constraints. Meta-pluralism, or\npluralism about pluralism, is obviously conceivable in similar terms,\nas it can be found in the formulation of the so-called pluralist\nstance (Kellert, Longino and Waters 2006). The pluralist stance\nreplaces metaphysical principles with scientific or empirical\nmethodological rules and aims that have been \u201ctested\u201d.\nLike Dupr\u00e9\u2019s and Cartwright\u2019s metaphysical\npositions, its metascientific position must be empirically tested.\nMetascientific conclusions and assumptions cannot be considered\nuniversal or necessary, but are local, contingent and relative to\nscientific interests and purposes. Thus, on this view, complexity does\nnot always require interdisciplinarity (Kellert 2008), and in some\nsituations the pluralist stance will defend reductions or\nspecialization over interdisciplinary integration (Kellert, Longino\nand Waters 2006; Cat 2012; Rescher 1993).\n6. Conclusion: Why unity? And what difference does it really make?\n\nFrom Greek philosophy to current debates, justifications for adopting\npositions on matters of unification have varied from the metaphysical\nand theological to the epistemic, social and pragmatic. Whether as a\nmatter of truth (Thalos 2013) or consequence, views on matters of\nunity and unification make a difference in both science and\nphilosophy, and, by application, in society as well. In science they\nprovide strong heuristic or methodological guidance and even\njustification for hypotheses, projects, and specific goals. In this\nsense, different rallying cries and idioms such as simplicity, unity,\ndisunity, emergence or interdisciplinarity, have been endowed with a\nnormative value. Their evaluative role extends broadly. They are used\nto provide legitimacy, even if rhetorically, in social contexts,\nespecially in situations involving sources of funding and profit. They\nset a standard of what carries the authority and legitimacy of what it\nis to be scientific. As a result, they make a difference in scientific\nevaluation, management and application, especially in public domains\nsuch as healthcare and economic decision-making. For instance,\npointing to the complexity of causal structures challenges traditional\ndeterministic or simple causal strategies of policy decision-making\nwith known risks and unknown effects of known properties (Mitchell\n2009). Last but not least is the influence that implicit assumptions\nabout what unification can do have on science education (Klein\n1990).\n\nPhilosophically, assumptions about unification help choose what sort\nof philosophical questions to pursue and what target areas to explore.\nFor instance, fundamentalist assumptions typically lead one to address\nepistemological and metaphysical issues in terms of only results and\ninterpretations of fundamental levels of disciplines. Assumptions of\nthis sort help define what counts as scientific and shape scientistic\nor naturalized philosophical projects. In this sense, they determine,\nor at least strongly suggest, what relevant science carries authority\nin philosophical debate.\n\nAt the end of the day, one should not lose sight of the larger context\nthat sustains problems and projects in most disciplines and practices.\nWe are as free to pursue them as Kant\u2019s dove is free to fly,\nthat is, not without the surrounding air resistance to flap its\nwings upon and against. Philosophy was once thought to stand for the\nsystematic unity of the sciences. The foundational character of unity\nbecame the distinctive project of philosophy, in which conceptual\nunity played the role of the standard of intelligibility. In addition,\nthe ideal of unity, frequently under the guise of harmony, has long\nbeen a standard of aesthetic virtue, although this image has been\neloquently challenged by, for instance, John Bailey and Iris Murdoch\n(Bailey 1976; Murdoch 1992). Unities and unifications help us meet\ncognitive and practical demands upon our life as well as cultural\ndemands upon our self-images that are both cosmic and earthly. It is\nnot surprising that talk of the many meanings and levels of\nunity\u2014the fundamental level, unification, system, organization,\nuniversality, simplicity, atomism, reduction, harmony, complexity or\ntotality\u2014can place an urgent grip on our intellectual\nimagination.",
