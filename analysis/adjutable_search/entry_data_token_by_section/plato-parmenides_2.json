Socrates\u2019 Speech: The Theory of Forms 128e\u2013130a\n\n\nSocrates then objects to Zeno\u2019s argument by denying premise\n(2). His lengthy objection depends on the theory of forms\narticulated in Plato\u2019s middle period\ndialogues.\n\n\nOne of the main principles of this theory is Causality\n(Phaedo 100c4\u20136, 100d7\u20138, 100e5\u20136,\n101b4\u20136, 101c4\u20135):\n\n\n(Causality) Things that are F\n(other than the F) are F by virtue of partaking of\nthe F.\n\n\nAnother crucial principle is Separation (Phaedo 75c11\u2013d2,\n100b6\u20137; Republic 476b10, 480a11):\n\n\n(Separation) The F is itself by itself, at\nleast in the sense of being separate from, and hence not identical\nwith, the things that partake of it.\n\n\nAccording to Separation, like things are like by partaking of a\nseparate form of likeness and unlike things are unlike by partaking of\na separate form of unlikeness. Although the properties of being\nlike and being unlike are contraries, they are not\ncontradictories. As Socrates emphasizes, it is possible for\nsensible things to partake of both likeness and unlikeness, and hence\nbe both like and unlike.\n\n\nSocrates does not explain how this is supposed to be possible, but\nwe can extract an explanation from what he says later in his speech\nabout the properties of being one and being many, and from what the\nPhaedo tells us about the properties of being tall and\nshort. At Parmenides 129c, Socrates claims that he\nhimself is one (being one among the seven persons who are present) and\nmany (in having many parts: right/left, front/back, upper/lower).\nAt Phaedo 102b ff., Socrates points out that Simmias is taller\nthan Socrates (and hence tall), but that Simmias is also shorter than\nPhaedo (and hence short). Thus, Simmias is both tall and\nshort. Clearly Socrates envisages the possibility of sensible\nthings being both like in one way and unlike in another. For\nexample, Socrates is like Plato (in that each is a philosopher) and\nunlike Meletus (in that one, but not the other, is a poet). Being\nlike Plato, Socrates is like. Being unlike Meletus, Socrates is\nunlike. Hence Socrates is both like and unlike. The general\nprinciple here is Impurity-S:\n\n\n(Impurity-S)   Sensible things are impure\ninasmuch as they can (and, in fact, often do) have contrary properties.\n\n\n\nIt follows from Impurity-S that premise (2) of Zeno\u2019s argument\nis false. But Socrates is willing to grant that Zeno is not\nentirely mistaken. He insists that although it is far from\nsurprising to be told that sensible things have contrary properties, he\nwould be astonished to learn that forms have contrary\nproperties. Socrates, then, holds that forms are pure,\nin the following sense:\n\n\n(Purity-F) Forms\ncannot have contrary properties.\n\n\nAccording to Purity-F, not only is it the case that the one cannot\nbe both one and many and the like cannot be both like and unlike, but\nit is also the case that the one cannot be both like and unlike and the\nlike cannot be both one and many. (Notice that Purity-F and\nImpurity-S together entail Non-Identity, the claim that no form is\nidentical to any sensible thing. A similar form of argument\nappears at Phaedo 74b\u2013c, a passage in which Socrates argues\nthat whereas sensible things that are equal are also unequal, the equal\nis not unequal, and hence the equal is not identical to any equal\nsensible thing.)\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 speech therefore articulates some of the basic elements\nof the theory of forms, namely Causality and Separation, along with\nImpurity-S and Purity-F. The theory to which Socrates alludes is\nricher than his brief description of it suggests. As the dialogue\nproceeds, the interlocutors invoke a number of additional middle period\nprinciples. One principle that plays an important role in the\nsequel is One-over-Many (see Republic 596a6\u20137):\n\n\n(One-over-Many) For any\nplurality of F things, there is a form of F-ness by\nvirtue of partaking of which each member of the plurality is\nF.\n\n\nIt is from this principle that Plato infers, by means of the Third\nBed Argument (Republic 597c1\u2013d3), the principle of\nUniqueness:\n\n\n(Uniqueness)\nFor any property F, there is exactly one form of F-ness.\n\n\n(Notice that the conjunction of One-over-Many and Uniqueness entails\nCausality.) The sequel also depends on yet another important\nmiddle period principle, Self-Predication:\n\n\n(Self-Predication) For\nany property F, the F is F.\n\n\nFor example, the beautiful is beautiful (Euthydemus 301b5,\nCratylus 439d5\u20136, Hippias Major\n292e6\u20137). It is clear that the point generalizes to all\nproperties, including the property of being large (see Phaedo\n100c4\u20136, 102e5\u20136).  (Notice that Purity-F and\nSelf-Predication together entail the principle that the F\ncannot possess the property that is contrary to F, instances\nof which appear throughout the middle dialogues (Hippias\nMajor 291d1\u20133, Phaedo 102e5\u20136) and in\nSocrates\u2019 speech (Parmenides 129b1\u20133, 129b6\u2013c1).)\nAnd finally, the sequel also repeatedly refers to the principle of\nOneness:\n\n\n(Oneness) Each form is\none.\n\n\nOneness and Uniqueness are different principles: to say that a form\nis one is to say not that it is unique, but rather\nthat it is something that can be counted. For Plato infers the\noneness of the beautiful from the fact that the beautiful and the ugly\nare two, the oneness of the large from the fact that the large and the\nsmall are two, and so on (Republic 475e9\u2013476a6,\n524b3\u20139). Thus the sense in which each form is one is similar to\nthe sense in which Socrates is one, in being one among many\n(Parmenides 129c8\u2013d2).\n",
