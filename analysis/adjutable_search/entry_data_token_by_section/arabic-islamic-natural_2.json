    "main_text": "The Atomism of Kal\u0101m || Change and Causality\n1.3 Change and Causality\n\nAt least among those theologians who posited both atoms and accidents\nin their ontology, most changes were explained in terms of one\naccident\u2019s being replaced by its contrary or at least by something\nacting like a contrary. In this case the atom changes, not the\naccident, which in fact is annihilated by its contrary. Although\naccident-replacement was the most general account of change, changes\nthat involve one type of body coming from another type of body (as for\nexample when fire is produced from burning wood or a spark is produced\nfrom striking stones together) presented a special case that needed a\ndifferent analysis of change. Many theologians explained this sort of\nchange in terms of a theory of latency (kum\u016bn), which\nmaintained that the fire atoms were already present in the wood or\nstone, albeit latent in them, and then were made manifest through the\naction of burning or striking.\n\nConcerning the more prominent sort of change, namely,\naccident-replacement, two further questions were debated: one,\n\u201cDoes change form a single kind or not?\u201d and two,\n\u201cWhere does locomotion occur, that is to say, do the initial\natoms prior to the motion or the subsequent atoms after the motion\nreceive the accident of motion?\u201d One argument used to show that\nthere are several kinds of motion observed that a single kind cannot\nbring about contradictory things, as for example, a fire does not\nproduce cooling and heating; however, motions do bring about\ncontraries such as being to the right or being to the left or being\nblack and being white. Thus motion cannot form a single kind. An\ninteresting response to this line of thought, which itself constituted\nan argument that motion forms a single kind, was the following. When a\nperson determines to move, say to the right, then at the next moment\nthere is both a motion and together with the motion a state of being\nto the right, and so there is a rightward motion. Similarly, should\none choose to move to the left, there would be both a motion together\nwith a state of being to the left, and so a leftward motion. Motion\nthen can be analyzed into both a motion and a particular state or\nmanner of being that accompanies the motion (where perhaps the\naccompanying state is understood as the result of the motion, although\nit is not explicitly described as such). The motion considered in\nitself is different from both the accompanying state (or result) as\nwell as the composite of the state and motion. Motions considered in\nthemselves, then, are similar with respect to being motion, but differ\nwith respect to the state or manner of being that accompanies the\nmotions, and so motion considered apart from the accompanying state is\na single kind.\n\nThe second issue debated by Muslim theologians concerning motion was\nwhether motion should be thought to occur in the first or second\nmoment, as for example whether there is motion at the very moment that\none determines to move rightward or at the moment when one is to the\nright. There were no less than three answers given to this question:\none was that the accident of motion occurs at the initial location of\nthe moving body; another located the motion in some second location;\nand finally one maintained that motion requires the body\u2019s being at\ntwo locations at two different moments. Those who maintained that the\naccident of motion occurs at the initial locations claimed that motion\nis the force of a body that necessitates its being in the second\nlocation. Since the force must be initially present in the body if it\nis to move to the second place, and motion is identified with this\nforce, the accident of motion must be present while the body is still\nin the initial place. Those who maintained that the accident of motion\noccurs in the second location did so on the basis of a linguistic\nanalysis of the term \u2018motion\u2019; for \u2018motion\u2019\nmeans there is a passage or transference of a body; however, there has\nbeen no passage or transference of a body while it is still in its\ninitial location. Thus the accident of motion must occur in the second\nlocation. Ab\u016b H\u0323udhayl (d. 841), who held that motion is different from\neither the state or composite of state and motion, maintained that\nmotion requires two places and two moments; \u2018The body\u2019s motion\nfrom the first place to the second place occurs in [the body] and [the\nbody] is in the second place at the exact moment it is in [motion],\nwhich is the transference and emergence of [the body] from the first\nplace \u2026 and so local motion inevitably involves two places and\ntwo moments\u2019 (al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b 1980, 355).\n\nAssociated with issues concerning motion and change was that of\ncausality, namely, \u201cWhat or who is the agent that brings about\nchange?\u201d Many of the earlier theologians subscribed to a theory\nof engenderment (tawallud), which preserved a degree of\ncausal efficacy for humans, whereas most later theologians adopted an\noccasionalist worldview, which reserved all agency for God and God\nalone. For the earlier theologians causal agency required a full\nknowledge (\u02bfilm) that one is acting as well as the\nknowledge of what results from that action. Thus causal agency is\nlimited to God and humans. That humans had the power to engender\ncertain actions was assumed by most of the earlier theologians. The\nquestion, then, was whether humans had the power to engender action\nsolely in themselves or in other things as well. One of the arguments\nused by those who thought humans could engender effects in things\nother than themselves came from the knowledge criterion for agency. It\ntook as an example that when a person beats another, he knows the\nbeating of the other, in which case the knowledge is of the action of\nthe one beating the other (al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b 1980, 401\u2013402).\nGeneralized, the argument seems to be that if one knows that one is an\nagent (and again it was taken for granted by the early theologians\nthat humans are agents), then one must know the effects of his action,\nand yet one knows that the effects of certain actions are in others,\nas in the case of beating and so causing pain. In contrast, others\nargued that humans only engender actions within themselves, and it is\nGod who brings about the effect in others, as for example, a human may\nproduce the action of willing to throw a stone, but it is God who\nactually causes the stone to move. One way of defending this thesis\nwas to observe that God creates bodies all at once and that at each\nmoment He recreates them (Ibid, 404). The assumption seems to be that\nsince God recreates bodies, human or otherwise, at every moment, no\nbody survives between two moments such that an action willed in the\nhuman body at one moment could be causally efficacious on some other\nbody at a second moment; for in one sense any purported efficacy of\nwhat was willed at one moment is wholly disconnected with the events\nof some second moment.\n\nThis latter argument taken to its logical conclusions, however,\nvirtually entails occasionalism, that is, the view that at each moment\nGod recreates the world, its atoms and accidents as well as all\nactions, whether that of a human or not, and so it is God alone who is\noccasioning the events that occur in our world. Indeed later\ntheologians would embrace such an occasionalist worldview. Their\npreferred argument for occasionalism, however, was not the one\nsketched above, but one based on the notion of possibility\n (istit\u0323\u0101\u02bfa).[3]\n The argument roughly was that a creature only performs some action if\nit possesses the possibility to perform that action. Whenever the\ncreature possesses this possibility, the possibility is either\nactualized or not. On the one hand, to affirm a non-actualized\nexisting thing, such as an un-actualized possibility, is tantamount to\naffirming a non-existing existing thing, which is a patent\ncontradiction. On the other hand, if the possibility is actualized,\nthen the creature must be performing the correlative action, and will\nalways be doing so when it possesses the actualized possibility, but\nof course created things sometimes act and sometimes do not. Therefore\nthe possibility for a creature to perform any given action must be\ncreated for it at any time it acts, and it is God who is constantly\ncreating the possibility to act, and so in effect the correlative\naction, at every moment something acts. In short, all agency must\nbelong to God and God alone.\n",
