    "main_text": "Early Responses\n4. Early Responses\n\nEarly responders to Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle can be\nroughly divided into three categories: those who misunderstood the\nprinciple (e.g., Born and Rosenfeld), those who embraced and developed\nit (e.g., Kramers and van Vleck), and those who seemed to understand\nit, but nevertheless mistrusted it (e.g., Sommerfeld, Pauli, and\nHeisenberg).\n\nIt is unclear how well many of Bohr\u2019s contemporaries understood\nwhat he meant by the correspondence principle. For example, even\nL\u00e9on Rosenfeld, one of Bohr\u2019s closest students and\ncollaborators, recalls Bohr\u2019s annoyance over his failure to have\ncorrectly understood the substance of this principle (Rosenfeld [1973]\n1979, p. 690). This is perhaps not entirely surprising given the\nturbidity of Bohr\u2019s writings. Bohr himself was quite conscious\nof the fact that his dense writing style often led others to\nmisunderstand him. In a letter to Arnold Sommerfeld, Bohr laments,\n\nIn the last few years I have often felt myself scientifically\nvery lonesome, under the impression that my efforts to develop the\nprinciples of the quantum theory systematically to the best of my\nability have been received with very little understanding\u2026 I\nunderstand quite well how little the matters are clarified as yet, and\nhow helpless I am at expressing my thoughts in easily accessible\nform. (Bohr to Sommerfeld, April 30, 1922; BCW 3, p. 39)\n\n\nIndeed one quickly sees a wide variety of different interpretations of\nthe correspondence principle emerging in the physics\nliterature\u2014a variety of interpretations that persists to this\nday. Hence, it is important to distinguish Bohr\u2019s own views on\nthe correspondence principle from what the correspondence principle\ncame to mean to the broader physics community (for a detailed account\nof how the correspondence principle drove research and discussions in\nthis period, see J\u00e4hnert 2019). Both Hendrik Kramers and John van\nVleck, for example, used and extended the term \u201ccorrespondence\nprinciple\u201d to cover a wide range of correspondence-type\narguments that were important in the development of quantum mechanics\n(see, for example, Duncan and Janssen 2007; 2019).\n\nAmong those who seemed to correctly understand the core of\nBohr\u2019s correspondence principle, even fewer embraced it. Indeed\nmany of Bohr\u2019s contemporaries were distrustful of the principle,\ndespite their willingness to opportunistically make use of it to\nobtain concrete results when other methods failed. Into this third\ncategory fall three of the most important contemporaneous critics of\nthe correspondence principle: Arnold Sommerfeld, Wolfgang Pauli, and\nWerner\n Heisenberg.[7]\n",
