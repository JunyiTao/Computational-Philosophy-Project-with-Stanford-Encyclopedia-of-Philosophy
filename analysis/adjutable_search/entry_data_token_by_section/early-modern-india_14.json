    "main_text": "Philosophical Psychology || Doubt (sa\u1e43\u015baya)\n5.3 Doubt (sa\u1e43\u015baya)\n\nThe concept of doubt has an important theoretical role in Ny\u0101ya,\nfor a state of doubt is claimed to be a necessary precondition for any\nphilosophical enquiry. Doubt is one of the sixteen topics listed under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.1, which determine the content of\nthe entire text. In particular, a doubt is the first step in a\nproperly formulated inference: is there a fire on the\nmountain?\u2014Yes, because there is smoke there. The Manual of\nReason gives a very precise definition of a doubt (TS 71): a\ncognition of two incompatible qualifiers in the same qualificand, for\nexample the cognition \u201cIs this (dimly perceived or distant\nobject) a person or a tree-stump?\u201d Schematically, then, a doubt\nis a cognition whose content is of the form \u201cx is\nF or not-F?\u201d.\n\nTwo points are worth noting. (i) Although doubts are classified as\nnon-true (apram\u0101) cognitions, they are not false. A\nfalse cognition is one whose content is \u201cx is\nF\u201d when in fact x is not F. (ii)\nDoubts are distinguished from other cognitions by virtue of having a\nspecial type of content, rather than by being propositional attitudes\nof a special kind. The Ny\u0101ya do not here say that we can take one\nof a series of attitudes towards the same proposition, believing,\ndisbelieving, doubting, etc. Yet if the only thing which distinguishes\na doubt is its having a content of the form specified in TS 71, then\nwhat differentiates the doubt that x is F from the\nbelief that x is both F and not-F?\nVardham\u0101na replies by drawing a distinction between actually\nhaving a contradictory belief and merely believing that one has a\ncontradictory belief. The former is supposedly impossible, the\nsupposedly contradictory belief that x is both F and\nnot-F is really a belief that I have a belief whose\nqualificand is x and whose qualifiers are F and\nnot-F. Since there are no genuine contradictory beliefs,\nthere are no beliefs with the same content as doubts.\n",
