    "main_text": "Placing Newton in the history of natural philosophy\n1. Placing Newton in the history of natural philosophy\n\nTraditionally, Newton would be characterized as a mathematician for\nhis work on the calculus and as a scientist for his work in physics.\nHis celebrated talent in mathematics is perhaps equaled not only by\nhis profound theorizing concerning the physical world, but also his\ninfluential experimental methods. Indeed, Newton is remarkable for the\nfact that his work as a theoretician is matched by his work as an\nexperimentalist\u2014either aspect of his oeuvre would be\nsufficient to secure his place in the history of modern science. So in\nthe popular imagination, and in the history books, Newton is seen as\none of the greatest scientists of the modern period, on a par with few\nothers (perhaps Darwin or Einstein). This view will continue to\ndominate our understanding of Newton in the twenty-first century.\n\nIf we attempt to understand Newton\u2019s work from an historical\npoint of view, however, a more complex conception emerges. When Newton\npublished his principal works, he was not contributing to a\nwell-established field, he was helping to create modern mathematical\nphysics. This meant that few of his ideas, methods, or approaches,\nwhether in mathematics or in experimental physics, could be taken for\ngranted. From his first papers in the early 1670s, on optics, until\nhis last days working on the third and final edition of his magnum\nopus the Principia decades later, philosophers,\nmathematicians and experimenters challenged Newton\u2019s approach.\nThis frequently upset Newton, who had a famous, lifelong aversion to\nintellectual debate and controversy. But in a sense, it helped to\nensure the importance of Newton\u2019s ideas for philosophy.\nObviously, Newton never wrote a philosophical text on the order of\nDescartes\u2019s Meditations, Locke\u2019s Essay,\nor Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. He never produced what the\nlumi\u00e8res who studied him would have called a\n\u201csystem\u201d of philosophy. But the intense controversies\nproduced by his mathematical, empirical and philosophical methods and\nideas continually prompted him to broach philosophical topics (Janiak\n2015). As a result, he was widely considered a leading philosopher\nthroughout the Enlightenment. In the first modern history of\nphilosophy, Brucker\u2019s Historia Critica Philosophiae,\nNewton plays a central role in discussions of the modern era (Volume\n4.2: 639-55). He is also a central figure in D\u2019Alembert\u2019s\ndiscussion of the emergence of modern science and philosophy: Newton\nis listed along with Bacon, Descartes, Locke and Leibniz as a key\nfigure in the Preliminary Discourse (80-83).\n\nThe eighteenth-century tendency to discuss Newton\u2019s\nphilosophy, rather than his science, may have an odd\nring to modern ears. In this case, however, the evolution of the\nEnglish language tracks a substantive intellectual development. As a\nmatter of historical fact, the category of the scientist\u2014along\nwith that word in English\u2014is a nineteenth-century invention.\nSpecifically, at a meeting of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science in June of 1833, the Cambridge philosopher\nWilliam Whewell coined the word \u201cscientist\u201d. Whewell said\nthat just as the practitioners of art are called\n\u201cartists\u201d, the practitioners of science ought to be called\n\u201cscientists\u201d, indicating that they should no longer be\ncalled\n philosophers.[1]\n Indeed, before the early nineteenth century, people like Newton were\ncalled \u201cphilosophers\u201d, or more specifically,\n\u201cnatural philosophers\u201d. During the seventeenth century,\nand well into the eighteenth (at least until 1750, if not later),\nfigures like Newton worked within the century\u2019s old tradition of\nnatural\n philosophy.[2]\n The modern disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology and so on, had\nnot yet been formed. (The words \u2018physics\u2019 in\nEnglish, \u2019physique\u2019 in French, and \u2018physica\u2019\nin Latin were often used, but had a very broad meaning, like\n\u201cnatural philosophy.\u201d) Philosophers who studied nature\ninvestigated such things as planetary motions, the nature of matter,\nand the possibility of a vacuum, but they also discussed many aspects\nof human beings, including the psyche, and how nature reflects its\ndivine creator (Hatfield 1996). As the title of Newton\u2019s magnum\nopus, Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\n(Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), suggests, he\nintended his work to be in dialogue with Descartes\u2019s\nPrincipia Philosophiae (Principles of Philosophy,\n1644). Descartes\u2019s Principles is a complex text that\nincludes discussions of everything from the laws of nature to the\nnature of God\u2019s causal influence on the world. Descartes had\nfamously promised that his physics required nothing more than the\nprinciples of geometry and pure mathematics (Principles, Part\nTwo, \u00a764). Although Descartes was a great mathematician, the\nauthor of a major work in geometry in 1637, Newton thought nonetheless\nthat he had not lived up to this promise, so he would assuredly\nintroduce mathematical principles for natural philosophy.\nJust as Descartes had sought to replace Aristotelian or\n\u201cScholastic\u201d methods and doctrines in natural philosophy,\nNewton sought to replace Descartes\u2019s. It is therefore more\nhistorically accurate and more illuminating to interpret Newton within\nthe historical stream of natural\n philosophy.[3]\n\nAs is well known, natural philosophy in the Aristotelian traditions of\nthe thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries involved an analysis of\nAristotle\u2019s ideas about the natural world, especially within the\nChristianized context of the medieval period. Philosophers studying\nnature were often actually studying texts\u2014such as commentaries\non Aristotle\u2014rather than conducting experiments or engaging in\nobservations, and they often did not employ mathematical techniques.\nTraditionally, natural philosophy in Aristotelian circles was not\nconceived of as a mathematical discipline (unlike, say, optics or\nastronomy); instead, it focused especially on the natures of objects\nand on causation. In the seventeenth century, natural philosophers\nlike Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, and Newton began to reject not only\nthe doctrines of the Aristotelians, but their techniques as well,\ndeveloping a number of new mathematical, conceptual and experimental\nmethods. Newton respected Descartes\u2019s rejection of Aristotelian\nideas, but argued that Cartesians did not employ enough of the\nmathematical techniques of Galileo, or the experimental methods of\nBoyle, in trying to understand nature. Of course, these developments\nhave often been regarded as central to the Scientific Revolution.\nDespite the centrality of these changes during the seventeenth\ncentury, however, the scope of natural philosophy had not\ndramatically changed. Natural philosophers like Newton expended\nconsiderable energy trying to understand, e.g., the nature of space,\ntime and motion, but they regarded that endeavor as a component of an\noverarching enterprise that also included an analysis of the divine\nbeing. Newton was a natural philosopher\u2014unlike Descartes, he was\nnot a founder of modern philosophy, for he never wrote a treatise of\nthe order of the Meditations. Nonetheless, his\ninfluence on philosophy in the eighteenth century was\nprofound, extending well beyond the bounds of philosophers studying\nnature, encompassing numerous figures and traditions in Britain, on\nthe Continent, and even in the New\n World.[4]\n Newton\u2019s influence has at least two salient aspects.\n\nFirst, Newton\u2019s achievement in the Opticks and in the\nPrincipia was understood to be of such philosophical import\nthat few philosophers in the eighteenth century ignored it. Most of\nthe canonical philosophers in this period sought to interpret various\nof Newton\u2019s epistemic claims within the terms of their own\nsystems, and many saw the coherence of their own views with those of\nNewton as a criterion of philosophical excellence. Early in the\ncentury, Berkeley grappled with Newton\u2019s work on the calculus in\nThe Analyst (1734) and with his dynamics in De Motu\n(1721), and he even mentioned gravity, the paradigmatic Newtonian\nforce, in his popular work Three Dialogues between Hylas and\nPhilonous (1713). When Berkeley lists what philosophers take to\nbe the so-called primary qualities of material bodies in the\nDialogues, he remarkably adds \u201cgravity\u201d to the\nmore familiar list of size, shape, motion, and solidity, thereby\nsuggesting that the received view of material bodies had already\nchanged before the second edition of the Principia had\ncirculated widely. Remarkably, in that same year Roger Cotes, the\neditor of the second edition of Newton\u2019s Principia, had\nargued in his editor\u2019s preface that gravity should indeed be\nconsidered a primary quality along with the more familiar mechanist\nproperties that had been the subject of so much discussion in previous\nyears. (Newton himself approached the topic more cautiously.) For his\npart, Hume interpreted Newtonian natural philosophy in an empiricist\nvein and noted some of its broader implications in his Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1739) and Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1750). Newton\u2019s work also served as the\nimpetus for the extremely influential correspondence between Leibniz\nand the Newtonian Samuel Clarke early in the century, a correspondence\nthat proved significant even for thinkers writing toward the\ncentury\u2019s end. Unlike the vis viva controversy and\nother disputes between the Cartesians and the Leibnizians, which died\nout by the middle of the century, the debate between the Leibnizians\nand the Newtonians remained philosophically salient for decades,\nserving as an impetus for \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\ninfluential work during the French Enlightenment, Foundations of\nPhysics (1740), and also as one of the driving forces behind\nKant\u2019s development of the \u201ccritical\u201d philosophy\nduring the 1770s, culminating in the Critique of Pure Reason\nin 1781. In addition, Newton\u2019s work spawned an immense\ncommentarial literature in English, French, and Latin, including John\nKeill\u2019s Introduction to Natural Philosophy (1726),\nFrancesco Algarotti\u2019s Newtonianism for the Ladies\n(1738), Henry Pemberton\u2019s A View of Sir Isaac\nNewton\u2019s Philosophy (1728), Voltaire\u2019s Elements\nof the Philosophy of Newton (1738), Willem Gravesande\u2019s\nMathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy (1747), Colin\nMacLaurin\u2019s An Account of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s\nPhilosophical Discoveries (1748), and many more besides.\nMoreover, two subsequent Continental editions of Newton\u2019s text\ncontained substantial philosophical engagements not only with his own\nideas, but with those of his potential rivals like the great\nmathematician Johan Bernoulli and also Leibniz. The famous\n\u201cJesuit\u201d (or \u201cGeneva\u201d) edition of\nPrincipia mathematica published by Fathers Le Seur and\nJacquier in 1739-1744 in three volumes engaged substantially with\nLeibnizian ideas (Guicciardini 2015). And \u00c9milie Du\nCh\u00e2telet wrote an extensive \u201canalytical\ncommentary\u201d as part of her complete French translation of the\nPrincipia, published posthumously in 1759. Part of the idea\nwas to translate Newton\u2019s old \u201cgeometric\u201d approach\nto physics into the new language of analysis, a project that was\nintertwined with numerous philosophical issues. Newton\u2019s ideas\nand methods in mathematics, physics and philosophy therefore continued\nto be of substantial importance well into the Enlightenment.\n\nA second aspect of Newton\u2019s influence involves thinkers who\nattempted in one way or another to articulate, follow, or extend, the\nNewtonian \u201cmethod\u201d in natural philosophy when treating\nissues and questions that Newton ignored. Euclidean geometry and its\nmethods were seen as a fundamental epistemic model for much of\nseventeenth-century philosophy\u2014as is well known,\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations attempts to achieve a type of\ncertainty he likens to that found in geometry, and Spinoza wrote his\nEthics according to the \u201cgeometrical method\u201d.\nPropositions deduced from axioms in Euclidean geometry were seen as\nparadigm cases of knowledge. We might see Newton\u2019s work as\nproviding eighteenth-century philosophy with one of its primary\nmodels, and with a series of epistemic exemplars as well. But part of\nphilosophy\u2019s task was to articulate precisely what the new\nNewtonian method involved. David Hume is perhaps clearest about this\naspect of Newton\u2019s influence: his Treatise of 1739 has\nthe subtitle, \u201cAn Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method\nof Reasoning Into Moral Subjects\u201d, and there can be little doubt\nthat he meant (at least in part) the method of the Opticks\nand the Principia (DePierris 2012). Indeed, as Hume\u2019s\ntext makes abundantly clear, various eighteenth-century philosophers,\nincluding not only Hume in Scotland but Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the\nContinent, were taken to be, or attempted to become, \u201cthe Newton\nof the\n mind\u201d.[5]\n For Hume, this meant following what he took to be Newton\u2019s\nempirical method by providing the proper description of the relevant\nphenomena and then finding the most general principles that account\nfor them. Of course, one aspect of Hume\u2019s work is to provide an\nanalysis of the concept of causation that is far more extensive than\nanything found in Newton, which has a substantial impact on what\ncounts as an \u201caccount\u201d of a phenomenon. This method would\nallow us to achieve the highest level of knowledge attainable in the\nrealm of what Hume calls \u201cmatters of\n fact\u201d.[6]\n\nDespite the influence of Newton\u2019s \u201cmethod\u201d on\neighteenth-century philosophy, it is obvious that the\nPrincipia\u2019s greater impact on the eighteenth century is\nto have effected a branching within natural philosophy that led to the\ndevelopment of mathematical physics on the one hand, and philosophy on\nthe other (Cohen and Smith, 2002, 1-4). And yet to achieve an\nunderstanding of how Newton himself approached natural philosophy, we\nmust carefully bracket such historical developments\u2014they did not\nsolidify until sometime after 1750, a generation after Newton\u2019s\ndeath. Indeed, if we resist the temptation to understand Newton as\nworking within a well established discipline called mathematical\nphysics, if we see him instead as a philosopher studying nature, his\nachievement is far more impressive, for instead of contributing to a\nwell-founded field of physics, he had to begin a process that would\neventually lead aspects of natural philosophy to be transformed into a\nnew field of study. This transformation took many decades, involving a\nseries of methodological and foundational debates about the proper\nmeans for obtaining knowledge about nature and its processes. Newton\nhimself not only engaged in these debates from his very first\npublication in optics in 1672, but his work in both optics and in the\nPrincipia generated some of the most significant\nmethodological discussions and controversies in the late seventeenth\nand early eighteenth centuries. These debates concerned such topics as\nthe proper use of hypotheses, the nature of space and time, the best\nunderstanding of the forces of nature, and the appropriate rules for\nconducting research in natural philosophy. Newton\u2019s achievement\nwas in part to have vanquished both Cartesian and Leibnizian\napproaches to natural philosophy; in the later eighteenth century, and\nindeed much of the nineteenth, physics was a Newtonian enterprise more\nthan anything. But this achievement, from Newton\u2019s own\nperspective, involved an extensive, life-long series of philosophical\ndebates. Those debates focused on numerous substantive issues, but\nalso included extensive discussions of the proper methodology in\nnatural philosophy.\n",
