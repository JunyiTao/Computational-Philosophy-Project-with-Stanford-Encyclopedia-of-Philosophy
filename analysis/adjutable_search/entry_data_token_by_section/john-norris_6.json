    "main_text": "Religious, Practical and Political Views\n5. Concluding Notes\n\nNorris integrates the thought of his predecessors\u2014Descartes,\nMalebranche, Suarez, Augustine, Aquinas and Plato\u2014in a manner\ncentering on the Christian God. God is truth, love and the aim of all\nreligious and practical life. Norris\u2019 ambition of completing\nMalebranche\u2019s project is reflected in his arguments to establish the\nexistence of the divine ideas and their locus in the mind of God, or\nthe intelligible world. His detailed discussion of the eternal truths\nis a further expansion upon Malebranche\u2019s philosophy. The defense of\nDescartes\u2019 real distinction proof is enlightening because it renders\ntransparent the assumption of abstractive knowledge that might have\naided contemporary readers\u2019 understanding of the proof. If Norris did\nnot venture further into the philosophical, political and scientific\ndebates of his own time, the explanation lies in his advice to never\nstudy out of vanity. Worldly knowledge, such as knowledge of history\nor languages, is a waste of one\u2019s time. Norris was dedicated to the\ncause of knowledge for Christianity\u2019s sake, and he saw his own work,\nas well as his predecessors\u2019, as attempting to realize fully knowledge\nof the Pauline Doctrine, stated at Acts 17:28, that in God\n\u201cwe live, move and have our being.\u201d\n",
