    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nAnselm was born in 1033 near Aosta, in those days a Burgundian town on\nthe frontier with Lombardy. Little is known of his early life. He left\nhome at twenty-three, and after three years of apparently aimless\ntravelling through Burgundy and France, he came to Normandy in 1059.\nOnce he was in Normandy, Anselm\u2019s interest was captured by the\nBenedictine abbey at Bec, whose famous school was under the direction\nof Lanfranc, the abbey\u2019s prior. Lanfranc was a scholar and\nteacher of wide reputation, and under his leadership the school at Bec\nhad become an important center of learning, especially in dialectic.\nIn 1060 Anselm entered the abbey as a novice. His intellectual and\nspiritual gifts brought him rapid advancement, and when Lanfranc was\nappointed abbot of Caen in 1063, Anselm was elected to succeed him as\nprior. He was elected abbot in 1078 upon the death of Herluin, the\nfounder and first abbot of Bec. Under Anselm\u2019s leadership the\nreputation of Bec as an intellectual center grew, and Anselm managed\nto write a good deal of philosophy and theology in addition to his\nteaching, administrative duties, and extensive correspondence as an\nadviser and counselor to rulers and nobles all over Europe and beyond.\nHis works while at Bec include the Monologion\n(1075\u201376), the Proslogion (1077\u201378), and his four\nphilosophical dialogues: De grammatico (probably\n1059\u201360, though the dating of this work is much disputed), and\nDe veritate, De libertate arbitrii, and De casu\ndiaboli (1080\u201386).\n\nIn 1093 Anselm was enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury. The previous\nArchbishop, Anselm\u2019s old master Lanfranc, had died four years\nearlier, but the King, William Rufus, had left the see vacant in order\nto plunder the archiepiscopal revenues. Anselm was understandably\nreluctant to undertake the primacy of the Church of England under a\nruler as ruthless and venal as William, and his tenure as Archbishop\nproved to be as turbulent and vexatious as he must have feared.\nWilliam was intent on maintaining royal authority over ecclesiastical\naffairs and would not be dictated to by Archbishop or Pope or anyone\nelse. So, for example, when Anselm went to Rome in 1097 without the\nKing\u2019s permission, William would not allow him to return. When\nWilliam was killed in 1100, his successor, Henry I, invited Anselm to\nreturn to his see. But Henry was as intent as William had been on\nmaintaining royal jurisdiction over the Church, and Anselm found\nhimself in exile again from 1103 to 1107. Despite these distractions\nand troubles, Anselm continued to write. His works as Archbishop of\nCanterbury include the Epistola de Incarnatione Verbi (1094),\nCur Deus Homo (1095\u201398), De conceptu virginali\n(1099), De processione Spiritus Sancti (1102), the\nEpistola de sacrificio azymi et fermentati (1106\u20137),\nDe sacramentis ecclesiae (1106\u20137), and De\nconcordia (1107\u20138). Anselm died on 21 April 1109. He was\ncanonized in 1494 and named a Doctor of the Church in 1720.\n",
